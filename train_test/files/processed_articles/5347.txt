    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe objective of the study wasto identify factors associated with use of services for adolescent mental health problems in\nan Australian community-based sample. Logistic regression analysis was conducted on data collected from 636 parents and\ntheir adolescent child to identify individual and family variables predicting parent report of service use for mental health\nproblems in the adolescent 12 months later. The services most reported by parents to have been accessed were school-\nbased ones. Multivariate analysis found that the following were associated with service use 12 months later: the adolescent\nbeing female, parent report of peer problems and hyperactivity, single-parent household, the parent being Australian born,\nand prior service use by the adolescent. Parental overcontrol was associated with reduced likelihood of service use at follow-\nup. No association was found between service use at follow-up and parent gender, socioeconomic status, number of siblings,\nparent psychopathology, family social connectedness, and prior service use by the parent. No association was also found for\nfamily environment factors, parental attachment, or for the adolescent's emotional competence or use of social support. The\nresults indicate that families provide a potential target for interventions aimed at increasing use of professional services for\nadolescent mental health problems.\n",

Increasing autonomy and individuation from the fam-\nily are defining features of adolescence as a developmental\nperiod (Allison & Sabatelli, 1988), resulting in reduced\ndependence on the family unit. Yet, research shows that ado-\nlescents continue to depend on parents as a primary source of\nsupport and advice throughout this developmental phase\n(Steinberg, 2001). It is evident that pre-adolescent children\noften rely upon a significant adult (usually a parent) to facili-\ntate service use should they experience a mental health prob-\nlem (Kazdin, Holland, & Crowley, 1997). However, this\nreliance is likely to reduce as a young person matures into\nadolescence. Nonetheless, family and parent factors (herein\nreferred to in combination as family factors for simplicity)\nare still likely to be influential in this process, although\nwhich of these factors and how has yet to be established.\nA demonstrated gap between mental health service need\nand service use has resulted in a body of literature examining\nwhat factors in addition to need influence whether a young\nperson receives mental health services (Logan & King, 2001;\nRickwood, Deane, & Wilson, 2007). Proposed models of the\nprocess of accessing mental health services for a child and/or\nadolescent derive from existing models of adult help-\nseeking, adapted to incorporate features of the family\n(Costello, Pescosolido, Angold, & Burns, 1998; Logan &\nquite diverse and often somewhat complex, these models iden-\ntify a number of common factors. To varying degrees, they\nderive from the behavioral model of health service use devel-\noped by Andersen and colleagues (Andersen, 1995; Andersen\n& Newman, 1973). The Andersen model classifies individual\ndeterminants of service use into three broad categories:\n1Deakin University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia\n2University of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia\nCorresponding Author:\nSiobhan Ryan, School of Psychology and Centre for Mental Health and\nWellbeing Research, Deakin University, 221 Burwood Highway, Burwood,\nEmail: sr@deakin.edu.au\nFactors Associated With Service Use for\nYoung Adolescents With Mental Health\nProblems: Findings From an Australian\nLongitudinal Study\nSiobhan M.

As many of these variables are\nknown risk factors for the development of mental health\nproblems in young people (Fergusson, Horwood, & Lynskey,\nindirect influence that these factors have on the development\nof the problems for which help is being sought.\nThere is some existing Australian research investigating\npredictors of service use for adolescent mental health prob-\nSawyer, Miller-Lewis, & Clark, 2007); however, these stud-\nies have a number of limitations, such as investigation of\nonly a small number of predictors (Lyneham & Rapee, 2007;\nSawyer et al., 2007), and investigation of help-seeking for a\nrange of problems rather than mental health problems spe-\ncifically (Fallon & Bowles, 2001). A significant portion of\nthis literature has also assessed help-seeking intentions of\nyoung people as the outcome variable (Rickwood, Deane,\nWilson, & Ciarrochi, 2005), which is only weakly correlated\nwith actual help-seeking behavior (Wilson & Deane, 2005).\nNeed-Related Variables Included in Models of\nService Use for a Young Person\nModels of service use for young people emphasize the\nimportance of the parents' perception of need in this process\n1996). Parent perception of need is very important in young\nchildren because they are unlikely to have an understanding\nof what emotional or behavioral symptoms may possibly\nbenefit from professional intervention, or knowledge of pro-\nfessional services appropriate and/or available (Costello et\nhave some understanding relating to mental health. The\ndegree to which parents'perception of need prevails over the\nperception of the adolescents in influencing the professional\nhelp-seeking process for the adolescent has yet to be clearly\nestablished (Costello et al., 1998). Parents potentially could\nbe the initiator of help-seeking from professional services\nonce they perceive a need in their adolescent child, or they\nmay be influential in encouraging the adolescent to seek help\nindependently (Logan & King, 2001). The presence of iden-\ntifiable antecedents to psychological distress, such as nega-\ntive life events, also has the potential to generate perception\nof need in either the adolescent or other family members.\nPredisposing Factors Included in Models of\nService Use for a Young Person\nSociodemographic factors.In addition to sociodemographic\ncharacteristics of the young person such as age and sex, mod-\nels of service use for young people also include socioeco-\nnomic characteristics of the family such as ethnic background\nand income. Adolescent girls have been shown to be more\nwilling to access professional services for mental health\nproblems than adolescent boys (Rickwood et al., 2005).\nHowever, once the presence of mental health symptoms has\nbeen controlled for, an effect for the sex of a young person on\nmental health service use has not been demonstrated (Angold\nteristics of the family, such as the parents' income and edu-\ncation, are identified by the models proposed by Costello\naccessing help for children and adolescents. Logan and\nKing's (2001) model identifies the family's instrumental\nresources (e.g., money, time, available transport) as influen-\ntial in parent facilitation of service use for adolescent mental\nhealth problems. Low socioeconomic status (SES) has been\nshown to be associated with service use in other countries,\nonce mental health symptoms of the young person were\nPredisposing\nfactors\nEnabling &\ninhibiting\nfactors\nNeed factors\nService use for an\nadolescent for\nmental health\nproblems\nFamily\nParent report of\nmental health\nsymptoms in the\nadolescent\nParent awareness\nof bullying\nIndividual\nAdolescent report\nof mental health\nsymptoms\nAdolescent report\nof negative life\nevents\nAdolescent report\nof being bullied\nFamily\nFamily\nenvironment\nParent-child\nrelationship quality\nParenting approach\nIndividual\nEmotional\ncompetence\nUse of social\nsupports\nFamily\nParent gender\nSocioeconomic\nstatus\nCultural\nbackground\nParent\npsychopathology\nParent previous\nservice use\nHousehold\nstructure\nNo. of children in\nthe household\nSize of social\nnetwork\nIndividual\nGender\nPrevious service\nFigure 1.

An Australian study, however,\nfailed to find a significant association between parent educa-\ntional achievement or household income and use of services\nfor adolescent mental health problems (Sawyer et al., 2007).\nBeing from an ethnic minority group has been identified\nas a potential barrier to use of professional services by young\npeople (Rickwood et al., 2007), and has been shown to pre-\ndict lower use of services for young people in a number of\ncountries. Studies from the United States have shown that\nbeing from an ethnic minority is associated with reduced use\nof mental health services for young people (Zahner &\ntion has not always been demonstrated (Cohen & Hesselbart,\nalso found that ethnicity was associated with service use for\nyoung people (Ford et al., 2008), and two studies from the\nNetherlands also failed to find an effect for ethnicity (Douma,\nDekker, Ruiter, Verhulst, & Koot, 2006; Verhulst & van der\nEnde, 1997). To our knowledge, no studies have investigated\nwhether ethnic background is associated with service use for\nan adolescent in an Australian community-based sample\nwhile controlling for mental health symptoms.\nFamily illness variables.The models proposed by Costello et\nhistory of psychopathology, with the Logan and King model\nsuggesting the family history of service use operates inde-\npendently of family history of psychopathology. Srebnik et\nal. (1996) also include parent psychopathology, but differ in\nspecifying it as need-related, in that its influence is exerted\nthrough the parents' perception of the young person's behav-\nior as problematic. Indeed, the presence of mental health\nsymptoms in a parent has been shown to predict service use\nfor a young person (Feehan et al., 1990; Mojtabai & Olfson,\n2008), as has a family history of use of mental health ser-\nvices (Zimmerman, 2005). These associations, however,\nhave not been consistently demonstrated once mental health\nsymptoms in the young person are controlled for (Jensen,\nSocial structure variables.Predisposing variables relating to\nsocial structure can be further broken down to those within\nthe family and those relating to the social networks within\nwhich the family is embedded (Costello et al., 1998). A fam-\nily's social structure can influence the help-seeking process\nthrough the availability of social supports as well as through\nthe transmission of social norms. Family size and structure\nare included in the models by Costello et al. (1998) and Sreb-\nnik et al. (1996). Structural features of the family shown to\nincrease the likelihood of service use for a young person\ninclude being from a single-parent household (Ford et al.,\nThe size of a family's social network can also be identified as\na factor that could predispose the family to accessing ser-\nvices for an adolescent (Costello et al., 1998).\nEnabling and Inhibiting Factors Included in\nModels of Service Use for a Young Person\nFamily environment variables. All three identified models of ser-\nvice use for young people include factors relating to the family\nenvironment or parent\u00adchild relationship; however, again they\ndiffer in how they propose these factors exert their influence.\nrize factors of environment of the family or parent\u00adchild rela-\ntionship quality as need variables, in that they impact a parent's\nability to recognize when the young person is experiencing a\nproblem. Alternately, the model proposed by Costello et al.\n(1998) categorizes these characteristics of the family as enabling\nvariables, because a function of the family unit is to provide\nsocial and instrumental support to its members. This approach is\nmore in line with Andersen's original model, which views\nsocial relationships as enabling resources (Andersen, 1995). As\nthere is no established guideline regarding what problems expe-\nrienced by an adolescent are best managed within the family\nand which would benefit from professional help, these decisions\nare guided by family norms (Costello et al., 1998; Srebnik et al.,\n1996). Existing studies investigating the influence of family\nenvironment and parent\u00adchild relationship quality on service\nuse have produced conflicting results (Ezpeleta et al., 2002;\nFord et al., 2008; Zwaanswijk, Van der Ende, Verhaak, Bens-\nCoping style of the young person. The model by Costello et al.\n(1998) includes the coping style of both the young person\nand the parent as influential in the help-seeking process.\nAustralian research focused on ascertaining barriers and\nenablers to adolescent help-seeking has identified the adoles-\ncent's emotional and social competence as important in this\nprocess (Rickwood et al., 2005). Emotional competence\nrefers to an individual's ability to recognize and describe\nemotions in themselves and others, as well as their capacity\nto understand emotions and manage them effectively\n(Salovey & Mayer, 1989). Low emotional competence has\nbeen shown to be associated with reduced willingness to\nseek help from professional sources for emotional problems\n(Ciarrochi, Wilson, Deane, & Rickwood, 2003). This asso-\nciation was found by another study to be mediated by the\nadolescent's level of social support (Ciarrochi, Deane, Wil-\nson, & Rickwood, 2002), which has been shown previously\nto be associated with help-seeking by adolescents for emo-\ntional problems (Rickwood & Braithwaite, 1994). Therefore,\nin addition to the availability of social resources as indicated\nby the social structure, an adolescent's capacity to recognize\nwhen use of social supports may be beneficial, as well as the\nadolescent's capacity to use these supports appropriately,\nmay potentially enable or inhibit use of professional services\nfor mental health problems.\n4 SAGE Open\nSummary\nIn summary, a large number of family factors are identified\nas influential by models of service use for a young person for\nmental health problems. However, whether these factors play\na role in service use for adolescents specifically has yet to be\nestablished. Furthermore, very little research has been con-\nducted using an Australian sample, in which characteristics\nof the mental health care system differ from those in other\ncountries. The current study seeks to address these gaps in\nthe existing literature by evaluating family and individual\nfactors identified by models of service use for young people\nin an Australian community-based longitudinal study of\nadolescents.\nBased on existing evidence, as well as proposed models\nof service use for young people, it was hypothesized that ser-\nvice use would be predicted by the adolescent being female,\nparent report of mental health problems in the adolescent,\nlower SES, single-parent household, the adolescent having\nfewer siblings, being from an ethnic minority, parent psycho-\npathology, adolescent use of social supports, and previous\nservice use by family members. As current evidence regard-\ning the association between factors relating to the family\nenvironment and service use is contradictory, and investiga-\ntion of the impact of the family's level of social support on\nservice use is preliminary (Bussing et al., 2003), examination\nof the impact of these factors on service use at follow-up by\nthe current study was exploratory.\nMethod\nData used for the current study was collected as part of a\nlongitudinal evaluation of a school-based intervention\n(Australian Clinical Trial Registry Number\n(RFI) was designed to support young adolescents and fami-\nlies to promote the young person's psychological well-being\nduring his or her high school years. More detailed descrip-\ntion of this program and the evaluation study can be found\nelsewhere (Toumbourou, Gregg, Shortt, Hutchinson, &\nwere approached to participate, 24 of which agreed.\nParticipating schools were randomized into either the inter-\nvention or control group. All students in Year 7 in 2004 were\ninvited to participate in the study, with new students joining\nthis cohort in Year 8 in 2005 also invited to participate at\nWave 2. The adolescents completed surveys in class time.\nParents and carers (hereafter referred to in combination as\n\"parents\") were also invited to participate via a mail-out sur-\nvey. Ethical approval was obtained from the University of\nMelbourne's Human Research Ethics Committee, as well as\nfrom relevant education bodies. Parents gave written consent\nfor their adolescent and themselves and adolescents provided\nwritten consent for each time point that data were collected.\napproximately 1 year after Wave 1. Further waves of data\nwere collected for the initial RFI evaluation, but were not\nanalyzed for the current study.\nParticipants\nOf the 4,404 adolescents eligible to participate in the study,\nsurveys for both waves were returned by 1,160 parents. Data\nanalyzed for the current study were from a subgroup of 636\nparent\u00adchild dyads for whom complete data were available\nat both Waves 1 and 2 of the study. The average age of the\nparticipants were female. Further descriptive statistics on the\nsample can be seen in supplemental file 1a.\nQuestionnaires\nSeparate survey packages were provided to parents and ado-\nlescents who were similar for the two waves of the current\nstudy. The parent and adolescent survey packages included\nquestions regarding demographics, the adolescent's emo-\ntional and behavioral problems, and a range of parenting and\nfamily environment variables. Adolescents also responded to\nquestions relating to a range of individual competencies\nidentified in existing literature as associated with use of ser-\nvices for mental health problems. An overview of included\nscales can be seen in supplemental file 1a.\nThe outcome variable for the current study was parent\nresponse at Wave 2 to the question: \"In the last 12 months,\nhas your Year 8 adolescent received professional assistance\nfor any emotional or behavioral problems (e.g., problems\nwith attention, anger, fears, worries, sadness)?\" A follow-up\nopen-ended question was asked to parents responding \"yes\"\nto this first question: \"If yes, please describe.\" Predictor vari-\nables were drawn from Wave 1 data from both parents and\nadolescents.\nDemographic information gathered from parents included\ntheir gender, age, and relationship to the child (parent or\ncarer). Parents also provided information about the structure\nof the household (i.e., whether both parents of the adolescent\nlived in the house, or whether the family was a step-family,\nsingle-parent family, or other), the annual household income,\nthe highest level of education of the parent and any partner,\nand whether or not they were born in Australia as an indica-\ntor of ethnicity. Although indigenous status as an additional\nindicator of cultural background was assessed in the survey,\ntoo few participants identified either themselves or a family\nmember as being of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander\ndescent to allow for meaningful comparisons to be made\n(Toumbourou et al., 2013). Demographic information gath-\nered from adolescents included their gender, age, and the\nnumber of siblings they have.\nEmotional and behavioral problems in the adolescent\nwere reported by parents on the Strengths and Difficulties\nRyan et al. 5\nThe Emotional Symptoms, Conduct Problems, Hyperactivity,\nand Peer Problems subscales were included in the current\nstudy. The adolescents completed the Conduct Problems\nsubscale of the self-report version of the SDQ as a measure\nof behavioral problems, and the Center for Epidemiologic\nStudies\u00adDepression scale (CES-D; Radloff, 1977), as an\nindicator of emotional problems. The adolescents also\nresponded to the question, \"Have you been bullied recently\n(teased or called names, had rumors spread about you, been\ndeliberately left out of things, threatened physically, or actu-\nally hurt)?\" on a 4-point scale as an indicator of the degree to\nwhich they had recently been bullied. Negative life events\nwere assessed by adolescents reporting whether or not they\nhad experienced 1 of 12 adverse events in the previous 6\nmonths (see supplemental file 1b for a summary).\nThe adolescent's perception of family conflict and paren-\ntal attachment were assessed with scales drawn from the\nCommunities That Care (CTC) survey, which has been vali-\ndated previously (Arthur, Hawkins, Pollard, Catalano, &\nBaglioni, 2002; Glaser, Horn, Arthur, Hawkins, & Catalano,\n2005). Parental attachment combined the two subscales of\nAttachment to Mother and Attachment to Father for the cur-\nrent analysis. Parental overcontrol measured with a scale\ndeveloped for the RFI adapted from the Parental Bonding\nInstrument (Parker, Tupling, & Brown, 1979), assessing the\ndegree to which the adolescent felt that his or her parents\nexert excessive psychological and behavioral control over\nthem (see supplemental file 1b).\nAdolescent emotional competence and use of social sup-\nports were assessed with scales developed for the RFI, which\ndrew items from existing scales. The emotional competence\nassessed the degree to which the adolescent is able to effec-\ntively manage negative emotions, with items drawn from the\nSelf-Efficacy Questionnaire for Children (Muris, 2001) and\nthe emotional control scale of the CTC. The Social Support\nScale was made up of items from the \"Seeking Social\nSupport\" subscale of the Self-Report Coping Strategies sub-\nscale, with one item omitted (Kochenderfer-Ladd & Skinner,\n2002). This scale measured the degree to which the adoles-\ncent used seeking social support as a strategy for coping with\nproblems (see supplemental file 1b for descriptions of these\ntwo scales).\nParent report of the family environment was measured\nwith the Cohesion and Conflict subscales of the Family\nEnvironment Scale\u00adThird Edition (FES-III; Moos & Moos,\n2002). The FES-III is a measure of the socio-environmental\ncharacteristics of a family, with the Cohesion subscale\nassessing the degree of support, commitment, and help fam-\nily members provide to one another, and the Conflict sub-\nscale assessing the amount of expressed anger or conflict\nwithin the family. Parents also completed a shortened ver-\nsion of the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS;\nLovibond & Lovibond, 1996) adapted for the RFI study as a\nmeasure of mental health symptoms in the parent. Parents\nwere also asked \"If in the last 12 months have either you (or\nyour spouse/partner) sought professional assistance for any\nemotional problems (e.g., anxiety, depression, anger) or\nproblems in your relationships (marital relationship, family\nrelationships)?\" to assess prior service use by a parent.\nAdolescent and parent perception of the family's level of\nsocial connectedness were measured with scales developed\nfor the RFI that assessed the degree to which the family is\ninvolved with community groups outside of the family (see\nsupplemental file 1b).\nStatistical Analysis\nLogistic regression was used to examine the association\nbetween adolescent-and parent-reported predictor variables\nat Wave 1 and parent report of professional service use for\nthe young person's emotional and/or behavioral problems in\nthe past 12 months at Wave 2. Univariate analysis was con-\nducted for all predictor variables, then multivariate analysis\nwas conducted with all predictor variables run in the model\nsimultaneously. Odds ratios and confidence intervals were\ngenerated to provide comparison of relative effects, with\ninterquartile odds ratios calculated for continuous predictor\nvariables to allow for comparison with categorical variables.\nInterquartile odds ratios provide an estimate of the relative\nlikelihood of those upper and lower quartiles of the distribu-\ntion of continuous variables, thereby compensating for the\nscale-dependent characteristic of the statistic (Mackinnon,\nParent report of household income and education level\nwere combined to generate a single variable of SES for anal-\nysis. This variable was an average of standardized scores for\nparent and spousal education and four levels of household\nincome. The household structure variable was also dichoto-\nmized to parent\u00adparent versus \"other\" for analysis. Because\ntwo parents returned surveys for 54 of the adolescents, a\nmultiple regression was run adjusting for clustering at the\nfamily level to control for multiple responders. This analysis\nadjusted for family clustering produced findings that\nreflected those of the model unadjusted for family clustering.\nResults described here are from the unadjusted analysis.\nStatistical analysis was conducted using STATA version 11.\nResults\nIn all, 59 of the 636 parents in the sample reported accessing\nservices for their adolescent's emotional or behavioral prob-\nlems at Wave 2. Of this number, 58 gave an answer to the\nfollow-up question asking for details, with responses describ-\ning the source of help accessed, giving a brief description of\nthe problems the adolescent was experiencing, or both. Two\nparents reported accessing more than one source of help, and\n13 described more than one type of problem for which help\nwas accessed. Table 1 provides a summary of responses\ngiven by parents.\n6 SAGE Open\nBivariate correlations between all variables included in\nthe analysis indicated that multicollinearity was not present\nin the data, and the correlation matrix for all variables can be\nseen in supplemental file 2. Results from the univariate and\nmultivariate regressions are shown in Table 2. Hosmer\u00ad\nLemeshow goodness-of-fit tests were non-significant for all\nmodels, indicating that the models were an appropriate fit for\nthe data (Fagerland, Hosmer, & Bofin, 2008).\nOnce all predictor variables were included in the model,\nfactors that were significantly associated with increased use\nof services for an adolescent were the adolescent being\nfemale, parent report of hyperactivity and peer problems,\nbeing from a single-parent family, the parent beingAustralian\nborn, and use of services for the adolescent in the previous\nyear. Adolescent report of high parental overcontrol was\nassociated with reduced odds of receiving services once the\ninfluence of all other variables was taken into account.\nNeed factors for which no significant association was\nfound with service use at Wave 2 in the multiple regression\nmodel were adolescent report of depressive symptoms,\nbehavioral problems, being bullied and negative life events,\nand parent report of emotional and conduct in the adolescent.\nNo association was found between service use at follow-up\nand predisposing factors of sex of the parent, SES, number of\nsiblings, parent psychopathology (DASS score), family\nsocial connectedness, and previous use of mental health ser-\nvices by the parent. No association was found for enabling\nfactors of the family environment, adolescent attachment to\nparents and family conflict, the adolescent's emotional com-\npetence or use of social support, parent report of family con-\nflict and cohesion, parent and adolescent report of social\nconnectedness, parent use of services in the previous year,\nSES, and exposure to the RFI.\nDiscussion\nResults from the current study demonstrate that, of a large\nnumber of predisposing, enabling, and need-related variables\ninvestigated, the adolescent being female, parent report of\nhyperactivity, and peer problems, prior service use by the\nadolescent, being from a single-parent family, and the parent\nbeing Australian born predicted service use at 12-month fol-\nlow-up. Adolescent report of parent overcontrol was also\nfound to be associated with a reduced likelihood that the ado-\nlescent would receive services once other variables were\ncontrolled for. School-based services were the predominant\nTable 2.

This finding supports those of previous studies\nthat have found that the impact of a young person's mental\nhealth problems on the parent is an important predictor of\nciation found here between the parent's report of peer prob-\nlems and use of services indicates that parents may be more\nlikely to recognize when their adolescent child is experienc-\ning mental health problems when there is an identifiable\nantecedent to them. This influence, however, may be more\nprominent in a school setting, considering that school-based\nservices were the predominant professional source of help.\nThat adolescent report of bullying does not retain signifi-\ncance in the full model also suggests that parents continue to\nhave the predominant influence in the decision to access help\nfor an adolescent of this age.\nOf predisposing variables examined in this study, the ado-\nlescent being female, being from a single-parent family,\nbeing from the dominant ethnic group, and previous service\nuse by the adolescent were found to increase the likelihood\nof professional help-seeking. The finding of greater service\nuse by females is consistent with previous research showing\nthat they are more willing to seek help and may also indicate\nthat parents are more predisposed to seek services for them.\nAlthough the association between being from a single-\nparent family and service use for young people is relatively\nestablished (Verhulst & van der Ende, 1997; Zahner &\nunderpinning this association have yet to be examined\nempirically. One hypothesis is that when there are less social\nresources available within the family, the family is more\nlikely to seek out professional help. That no association was\nfound between the level of social connectivity of the family\nand service use suggests that this association is unlikely to be\nmediated by the availability of informal help sources to the\nfamily. Furthermore, as measures of the adolescent's social\ncompetence and use of social support for coping were not\nrelated to service use, it is likely that service use by single-\nparent families is driven more by the parent than the\nadolescent.\nBeing from an ethnic minority is an established barrier to\nservice use; however, this is the first study to our knowledge\nto demonstrate that this in an Australian community-based\nsample using service use behavior as an outcome measure.\nResearch from the United States suggests that the influence of\nculture operates through beliefs about mental health (Lau &\nTakeuchi, 2001); however, other factors that may contribute\nto this association include English language difficulties, lack\nof awareness of services available, and a perception that ser-\nvices are unlikely to be able to accommodate diverse cultural\nbeliefs and practices. Interestingly, only the adolescent's his-\ntory of service use, and not the parent's, predicted profes-\nsional help-seeking, suggesting that knowledge of adult\nmental health problems and services does not necessarily\ngeneralize to understanding about adolescent mental health\nproblems and appropriate help sources. This result, however,\nmay be a reflection of the substantial use of school-based\nsources reported in the current study.\nThe only enabling variable identified as associated with\nservice use was the adolescent's report of parent overcontrol.\nAlthough this factor has been shown to be associated with an\nincreased risk for adolescent emotional problems (McLeod,\nWeisz, & Wood, 2007), this is the first known study finding\nthat this variable is a predictor of lower service use. This\nfinding identifies parental overcontrol as an important focus\nfor early intervention and prevention efforts for mental health\nproblems in adolescents. It also highlights the importance of\ndeveloping a clear representation of how an overcontrolling,\nor more importantly an \"appropriately controlling,\" parent-\ning style is operationalized to inform such interventions.\nThe current study has a number of limitations that should\nbe acknowledged. First, reliance solely upon parent report of\nservice use means that any service use initiated by the ado-\nlescent or other referral source that may have occurred with-\nout the parent's knowledge is not counted. The study would\nhave also benefited from a more detailed measure of service\nuse, including systematic assessment of types of help\naccessed for the adolescent's problems, as well as the types\nof problems for which help was sought. Another limitation is\nthe lack of uniformity in parent-and adolescent-reported\nmeasures. Validated, parallel measurement tools designed\nfor multiple informants of family environment and parenting\nfactors, as well as for the adolescent's mental health symp-\ntoms would have improved the quality of this study.\nFurthermore, although the current study used a community-\nbased sample, the small proportion of eligible parents who\nparticipated in the study limits generalizability. Despite these\nlimitations, the findings improve understanding of profes-\nsional help-seeking in the Australian context, by using a\ncommunity sample and a diverse range of predictor vari-\nables. Use of a longitudinal design is also a strength of the\ncurrent study.\nIn conclusion, findings from the current study indicate\nthat, as proposed by existing models of service use for men-\ntal health problems in young people, factors relating to the\nfamily are important. These findings suggest that the family\nis a valuable potential target for interventions aimed at\nimproving service use.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nA potential conflict is noted in that Professor Toumbourou holds\nintellectual property responsibility for the Resilient Families\nintervention.\n8 SAGE Open\nFunding\nThe data collection was completed with funding from the National\nHealth and Medical Research Council (Project Grant Nos. 251721), the\nAlcohol Education and Rehabilitation Foundation, and the Grosvenor\nSettlement Philanthropic Trust.
