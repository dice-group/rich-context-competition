To\nfurther develop a detailed picture of the public health impli-\ncations, we used 2 national data sets to examine trends in the\nprevalence of nonmedical use of prescription opioids, pre-\nscriptionopioidusedisorders,frequencyofuse,anddrugover-\ndose deaths involving prescription opioids. Because nonel-\nderly adults are the main population at risk of chronic\nnonmedical use of prescription opioids and related morbid-\nityandmortality,11 thisstudyfocusedonadultsaged18through\nMethods\nData Sources\nFirst, we examined data of adults who participated in the\n(NSDUH), which are conducted by the Substance Abuse and\nMental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). They pro-\nvided nationally representative data on nonmedical use of pre-\nscription opioids and use disorders among the civilian, non-\ninstitutionalized population aged 12 years or older in the\nUnited States. Excluded from NSDUH were persons without a\nhousehold address (eg, homeless persons not living in shel-\nters), active-duty military personnel, and institutional resi-\ndents. The data collection protocol of the NSDUH was ap-\nproved by the institutional review board at the Research\nTriangle Institute (RTI) International. Written informed con-\nsent was obtained from each study participant. The annual\nresponse rate 2 for in-person household surveys by the Ameri-\ncan Association for Public Opinion Research.13 Details regard-\ning NSDUH data collection are provided elsewhere.12\nCauseofDeathFilesfromtheNationalVitalStatisticsSystem.14\nDrugoverdosedeathswerethoseassignedanunderlyingcause\nofdeathusingtheInternationalClassificationofDiseases,Tenth\ntent). Prescription opioid overdose deaths were those as-\nanalyses. We limited analyses to drug overdose deaths among\nadults aged 18 through 64 years in the United States.\nMeasures\nThe NSDUH defined 12-month nonmedical use of prescrip-\ntion opioids as use in the prior 12 months without a prescrip-\ntion or as use with a prescription simply for the experience or\nfeeling caused by opioids.12 If respondents reported using pre-\nscription opioids nonmedically in the past year, they were\nasked to state the number of days they used them nonmedi-\ncally. Consistent with previous work,11,15,16 we defined fre-\nquent users as those with 100 days or more of nonmedical opi-\noid use in the past year and highly frequent users as those with\n200 days or more. For persons reporting nonmedical prescrip-\ntion opioid use, NSDUH collected sources of the medications,\nincluding given by a friend or a relative for free, prescribed by\n1 or more physicians, stolen from a friend or a relative, bought\nfrom a friend or a relative, and bought from a drug dealer or\nstranger.

Similarly, we estimated trends in the rates of\noverdose deaths involving prescription opioids between\nregression models were applied to assess the unadjusted\nannual prevalence, to test for differences between the 2003\nPREDMARG and PRED_EFF statements in SUDAAN,19,20\nNonprescription Opioid Use in the United States Original Investigation Research\n \nDownloaded From: http://jama.jamanetwork.com/ by a Labtiva Inc.

For drug overdose death\nrates, 2-tailed z tests (with a significance level of .05)21 were\nused to test differences between the 2003 rate and the rate in\ntion was used to reduce chances of type I errors of testing\noverall trends. For each outcome, if the overall trend did not\nmeet the statistical significance threshold after the Bonfer-\nroni correction, differences between the 2003 estimate and\nthe estimates in other years were not reported.\nBivariable and multivariable logistic regression modeling\nwere applied to assess unadjusted and model-adjusted rela-\ntive risk (using PREDMARG and PRED_EFF statements in\nSUDAAN19,20) for prescription opioid use disorders among\nnonmedical opioid users. Because major depressive episodes\nwere unavailable in the 2003 NSDUH and because the source\nwithout them. This study used SUDAAN software to account\nfor the complex sample design and sampling weights of\nNSDUH data. Moreover, bivariable and multivariable zero-\ntruncated negative binomial regression models were applied\nto examine factors associated with the number of days of\nnonmedical use of prescription opioids among nonmedical\nusers. Stata statistical software22,23 was used for a zero-\ntruncated negative binomial regression function that\naccounts for the complex sample design and sample weights\nof NSDUH. Multicollinearity (using variance inflation factors)\nand potential interaction effects between examined factors\nwere assessed and were not identified in final multivariable\nmodels. Furthermore, for the prevalence of prescription opi-\noid use disorders among nonmedical opioid users, we con-\nducted tests for interaction effects for specific subgroup com-\nparisons (eg, between non-Hispanic whites and non-Hispanic\nblacks, between non-Hispanic whites and Hispanics, etc).

For\nexample, users with sedative use disorders were at the high-\nest risk of both intensity outcomes, which may help explain\nthe increasing morbidity and mortality due to prescription\nopioid and benzodiazepine use.29 Users who were disabled\nfor work and users with Medicaid health insurance coverage\nwere at higher risk of both intensity outcomes, which were\nconsistent with previous studies showing that these popula-\ntions were more likely to be prescribed and to use prescrip-\ntion opioids in higher-risk ways and were at increased risk\nof opioid-related mortality.30 These results can be incorpo-\nrated into clinician training programs to facilitate effective\nidentification and interventions for high-risk nonmedical\nusers of prescription opioids. Moreover, clinicians can use\nprescription drug\u00admonitoring programs31,32 to identify pat-\nterns of inappropriate receipt of prescription opioids and\nscreen and treat patients with prescription opioid use disor-\nders as well as other associated specific substance use disor-\nders, nicotine dependence, and depression.\nReceiving treatment for substance use disorders is par-\nticularly critical.
