The ester bonds\nthat enable the polymerization of BPA can be\nbroken, particularly under exposure to heat,\nBPA has long been described as a weak\nestrogen due to its low affinity for nuclear estro-\ngen receptors, but recent studies have shown\nthat BPA is equipotent with estradiol in its abil-\nity to initiate rapid nongenomic responses from\nmembrane surface receptors (Quesada et al.\ncause human health effects is a matter of some\ndebate; the potential for harm to infants and\nthe fetus is currently considered more likely\nthan harm to adults [National Toxicology\nThe Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention (CDC) estimates that 93% of\nAmericans  6 years of age have detectable\nurine levels of BPA (parent BPA and con-\ndata from the National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES) (Calafat\net al. 2008b). The median BPA for all ages\nwas 2.7 ng/mL, with the lowest creatinine-\ncorrected levels found in males, Mexican\nAmericans, and subjects with higher income.\nExposure is thought to be almost exclu-\nsively from food (NTP 2008). For example,\nWilson et al. (2007) examined exposure to\nBPA and other phenols in 275 young chil-\ndren 1.5\u00ad5 years of age. They concluded that\n99% of BPA exposure was dietary based on\nmeasurements of BPA levels from a variety\nof sources such as food, air, and house dust.\nBecause their preliminary survey did not find\nBPA in tap water, it was not subsequently\nmeasured in the main study (Wilson N, per-\nsonal communication). Miyamoto and Kotake\n(2006) modeled Japanese exposures and con-\ncluded that 95% of adult male BPA intake\nwas from food and drink, excluding water.\nIn human adults, BPA is generally described\nas rapidly metabolized, with elimination thought\nto be virtually complete within 24 hr of expo-\nsure. This conclusion is based primarily on three\nhuman experimental studies of acute exposures,\nalthough animal studies have generally led to\nsimilar conclusions (Vandenberg et al. 2007).\nHuman pharmacokinetics after single\nexposures were first reported by V\u00f6lkel and\ncolleagues (2002). In this study, they gave six\nvolunteers deuterium-labeled BPA (5 mg)\nby mouth and followed elimination in both\nblood and urine for 42 hr. Urine levels, mea-\nsured every 6 hr, peaked 6 hr after administra-\nreported a urinary elimination half-life of\ndata in the construction of a physiologically\nbased pharmacokinetic model.\nIn their second acute exposure study,\nV\u00f6lkel et al. (2005) gave a much smaller dose\nof labeled BPA (25 \u00b5g) to six volunteers, and\nfollowed blood and urine levels for 7 hr. Urine\nwith a reported urinary elimination half-life\ndeuterium-labeled BPA to one subject and\nmeasured urine BPA levels for 26.5 hr. Urine\nreturned to near baseline (2.2 ng/mL) in this\nsubject by 5 hr. They subsequently dosed 25\nsubjects with 50 \u00b5g BPA, and found that, on\naverage, 76% of administered BPA was elimi-\nnated in the urine within 5 hr.\nIf the rapid BPA clearance seen in these\nacute exposure studies also occurs in the\nchronic exposures experienced by the general\npopulation, and if BPA exposure is almost\nentirely through non-water dietary intake,\nthen BPA levels in the population should be\ninversely related to fasting time. Fasting time,\nin this context, is analogous to the time after\ndosing in an experimental pharmacokinetic\nstudy. At the start of fasting, BPA exposure\nshould essentially stop and BPA elimination\nshould follow rapidly. Therefore, participants\nwith long fasting times before urine collection\nshould have substantially lower BPA urine\nlevels than those with shorter fasting times.\nIn this exploratory study, we present evi-\ndence that these NHANES BPA data are not\nconsistent with the current consensus that\nBPA exposures are both rapidly cleared and\nalmost entirely related to food intake.

If this is correct, BPA levels in fasting individuals should decrease with increased fasting time.\nObjectives: We set out to investigate the relationship between urine BPA concentration and fast-\ning time in a population-based sample.\nMethods: We modeled log BPA urine concentration as a function of fasting time, adjusted for\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey. We estimated the BPA \"population-based half-life\"\nResults: The overall pop\u00bd for the 0- to 24-hr interval was 43 hr [95% confidence interval (CI),\nwith fasting time, with a pop\u00bd of 4.1 hr (95% CI, 2.6\u00ad10.6 hr). However, within the fasting time\ndid not significantly predict highest (> 12 ng/mL) or lowest (below limit of detection) BPA levels.\nConclusions: Overall, BPA levels did not decline rapidly with fasting time in this sample. This\nsuggests substantial non\nfood exposure, accumulation in body tissues such as fat, or both. Explaining\nthese findings may require experimental pharmacokinetic studies of chronic BPA exposure, further\nexamination of BPA levels and effects in fat, and a search for important non\nfood sources.\nKey words: bisphenol A, exposure assessment, NHANES, pharmacokinetics.

We used data from the\nNHANES, conducted by the CDC National\nCenter for Health Statistics (Hyattsville, MD),\nis a multistage, stratified, clustered sample of the\ncivilian, noninstitutionalized U.S. population.\nData are acquired through standardized\nexaminations at mobile examination centers\nthroughout the United States, with 30 counties,\nor groups of contiguous counties, surveyed\nduring each 2-year period. Certain subgroups\nare sampled at a higher rate than other\ndemographic groups, including older adults,\nMexican Americans, non-Hispanic blacks,\nand low-income persons. A CDC institutional\nreview board approved the study protocol, and\ninformed written consent was obtained from all\nsubjects. Detailed methods have been published\nthird subsample of participants  6 years of\nage (n = 2,567) was selected for urinary BPA\nmeasurements. We excluded ages < 18 (34%)\nbecause mean fasting times were substantially\nshorter than those of adults, and because\nadjustment for body mass index (BMI) is \ncom-\nplex in children and adolescents. We excluded\nthose  85 years of age (2%) to reduce \npharma-\ncokinetic variability and effects of comorbidity.\nWe also excluded participants who reported\nfasting times > 24 hr (1%) to reduce regression\nleverage of these fasting time outliers. This left\n1,469 participants with complete data for the\nmeasures described below.\nFasting time. Except for insulin-dependent\ndiabetics, all adults were asked to fast, although\nfailing to fast adequately (refusal or mistake)\ndid not disqualify participants. Appointment\nslips, given to subjects in advance, indicated\nthat once fasting started, subjects should:\na) \"not eat or drink anything except water\"\nand b) have \"no coffee, tea, food, dietary sup-\nplements, mints, cough drops, gum, snacks, or\nbeverages, and no nicotine for at least 3 hours\"\n(CDC 2004b). Participants who attended the\nmorning session were asked to fast 9.5 hr (over-\nnight). Afternoon and evening session subjects\nAt each mobile examination center, phle-\nbotomists assessed subject fasting compliance.\nFasting time was calculated by CDC (in hours\nand minutes) using the participant's response\nat the time of blood and urine collection to\nthe question \"When was the last time you ate\nor drank anything other than plain water?\"\nHowever, phlebotomists were also instructed\nto consider consumption of \"diet soda, black\ncoffee or tea with saccharine or Equal\" as\nequivalent to plain water, and thus these items\nwere permitted during \"fasting.\" Subjects were\nalso asked whether, since fasting began, they\nhad consumed coffee/tea with cream/sugar,\nalcohol, gum, mints, lozenges, cough drops,\nantacids, laxatives, antidiarrheals, or dietary\nsupplements. Consumption of these items was\nrecorded, but without modifying the overall\nBPA measurement. One spot urine sample\nwas collected from each participant and ana-\nlyzed by CDC using HPLC and tandem mass\nspectroscopy to determine BPA concentration\n(sum of BPA parent compound plus conju-\ngated metabolites; nanograms per milliliter).\nSamples below the limit of detection (LOD;\n0.4 ng/mL) were coded as LOD divided by the\nDetailed BPA analysis methods have been\npublished, including the quality control sys-\ntem that was used to prevent contamination\nduring collection, handling, and analysis of\nWe log-transformed BPA in regres-\nsion analyses to normalize its distribution.\nDifferences in urine dilution were corrected\nusing urine creatinine. In regressions, this cor-\nrection was performed by adding to the model\nthe function of urine creatinine that provided\nthe best model fit (urine creatinine and creati-\nnine square root). For descriptive statistics, cre-\natinine-corrected BPA was calculated as BPA\ndivided by urine creatinine.\nBPA levels by fasting hour. To estimate the\nhour-by-hour trajectory of BPA in the popula-\ntion, we fit linear regression models in which\nfasting time was represented by 23 dummy vari-\nables, each representing a 1-hr interval from 1\nto 24 hr with 0\u00ad1 hr as the reference group. To\nplot these results, we used the regression model\nto predict BPA by hour for a \"standard person\"\nhaving the median of continuous variables and\nmode of categorical variables. Because creati-\nnine correction in our regressions was achieved\nby including urine creatinine as a covariate,\nthe model predicts BPA rather than creatinine-\ncorrected BPA. Hence predicted BPA results\nare given in nanograms per milli\nliter rather than\nmicrograms per gram creatinine.\nBPA population-based half-lives. Plots of\nlog concentration versus time are commonly\nused to assess toxicant elimination in experi-\nmental pharmacokinetic studies. Under first-\norder kinetics, in which elimination rate is\nproportional to internal concentration, the plot\nof log concentration vs. time is a straight line\nunless the toxicant distributes from a central\ncompartment (e.g., blood) to a peripheral com-\npartment with a slower elimination rate (e.g.,\nfat). The elimination half-life is computed as\nIn our study, we adapted this approach to\na food-based population exposure by regressing\nlog BPA concentration against fasting time, in\nwhich each data point represents an individual\nparticipant. As in experimental kinetics, we\ncalculated the half-life as \u00adln(2)/slope, except\nthat in our population-based approach, the\nslope was represented by the fasting time coeffi-\ncient from adjusted linear regressions described\nbelow. We computed the 95% confidence\ninterval (CI) of the half-life from the lower and\nupper bounds of the regression coefficient CI\nBecause we are using pharmacokinetic con-\ncepts in a nonstandard epidemiologic manner,\nwe wish to carefully distinguish between experi-\nmentally determined kinetics and population-\nbased observations from which kinetics must be\ninferred. To this end, we use the term \"half-life\"\nin its conventional pharmacokinetic sense and\nthe term \"population-based half-life\" (pop\u00bd) for\nderived kinetics seen in these population data.\nIn addition to examining the slope over\nthe entire fasting interval (0\u00ad24 hr), we also\nsubdivided this time period into three sub-\nintervals. We selected cut points that would\nmaximize the slope of the regression line (e.g.,\nresult in the shortest pop\u00bd) during the period\nwhen rapid excretion should be occurring. This\nwas done by fitting regressions to explore a\nrange of intervals from fasting time > 2\u00ad5 hr\nto < 6\u00ad10 hr, in half-hour increments (e.g.,\nThe sharpest slope was found from 4.5\u00ad8.5\nhr.

We performed mul-\ntiple linear regression analyses, adjusted for\nfasting time, urine creatinine, sex, age, race,\nBMI, income, and examination session. Age\nwas computed as age in months divided by 12.\nRace was categorized as Mexican American,\nwhite, black, and other/mixed. Income was\nrepresented by the poverty income ratio, the\nratio of family income to the poverty line,\nadjusted for family size (continuous, minimum\n= 0; top-coded at 5). The examination session\nattended was coded as morning, afternoon, or\nevening, with the exact time of visit omitted\nby CDC to help ensure privacy. We also used\nlogistic regression, with covariates as above,\nto identify predictors of low BPA levels (BPA\n< LOD; n = 114) as well as the highest BPA\nTo assess the effects of hepatic and\nrenal function, we also repeated these\nanalyses, adding to the model the liver\nenzyme -glutamyl transferase, and glomeru-\nlar filtration rate, a measure of renal func-\ntion. We estimated the glomerular filtration\nrate using the four-variable equation from the\nModification of Diet in Renal Disease study\nIn complex surveys such as NHANES, sur-\nvey design variables are available to enable an\nanalyst to make estimates consistent with those\nthat would result from a random sample of the\nU.S. population (Lee and Forthofer 2005).\nSample weights adjust for oversampling and\nsurvey imperfections such as nonresponse bias.\nSurvey cluster variables are used to account for\nthe multilevel sampling strategy, in which, for\ninstance, people from a given neighborhood\nor county are expected to be more similar to\neach other than to people from other parts of\nthe country.\nIn this study, we have omitted survey\ndesign variables from our analyses because this\napproach is most favorable to the standard view\nof BPA as a rapidly cleared exposure. Survey\nvariables generally have the effect of increasing\nstandard errors and reducing power--in this\ncase, reduced power to detect a slope of BPA\nconcentration versus time that should be decid-\nedly different from zero if the standard view is\ncorrect. By choosing not to use the weights and\nother design adjustments, we retain the sta-\ntistical power found in a convenience sample\nanalysis, but lose the ability to generalize to the\nU.S. population as a whole.

(2000), for example, found\nsubstantial migration of BPA from PVC hoses\ninto room temperature water. BPA migration\nproduced substantial BPA levels within 24 hr\n(median 329 ng/mL). Because PVC pipe is\napproved for use in residential water supply\nlines in many cities, BPA exposure from this\nsource (by ingestion or inhalation) deserves\ninvestigation. A sizable fraction of this BPA\nwould be chlorinated, however (Yamamoto and\nYasuhara 2002). Chlorinated BPA species were\n2007a) or in the children\u00b4s study by Wilson\net al.

(2007) describe other potential sources,\nsuch as dental sealants, dust, air, sewage\neffluents, and landfill leachates.\nAlthough acute, single-dose human\nexperiments give compelling evidence that most\nBPA is rapidly excreted, frequent exposures\ncould result in accumulation if BPA distributes\nto tissues that release BPA slowly.

(2007) measured BPA in adi-\npose tissue and found, for all subjects, a mean\nof 3.2 ng BPA/g fat and 8.2 ng chlorinated\nBPA/g fat. Olea et al. (2008) found substan-\ntially greater levels in children. Their mean levels\nchlorinated BPA ng/g fat (Olea N, personal\ncommunication). The BPA concentrations\nfrom these human studies are much greater\nthan those recently shown to reduce the pro-\nduction of adiponectin in human adipose tissue\nexplants (Hugo et al. 2008). Low adiponectin\nhas been correlated with insulin resistance and\nvascular inflammatory states (Hajer et al. 2008),\nwhereas total urine BPA (BPA and conjugated\nmetabolites) has been correlated with cardio-\nvascular disease and diabetes (Lang et al. 2008).\nThus BPA accumulation in fat, if common,\ncould have important health implications.\nOur analysis has several limitations: exclu-\nsion of children and the very elderly, self-\nreported fasting time, non-use of complex\nsurvey variables, and the question of BPA\ncontamination or measurement error.\nBecause we limited our examination to adults\n18\u00ad85 years of age, these results do not necessar-\nily apply to children or to those > 85 years of\nage. Although neonates have some capacity to\nmetabolize BPA (Calafat et al. 2008a), neonates\nand young infants have immature glucuronida-\ntion capacity generally (Alcorn and McNamara\n2003), which is the primary means by which\nhumans metabolize BPA. In the elderly, changes\nin body composition and a decline in renal\nfunction may affect volume of distribution and\nThe accuracy of self-reported fasting time\nappears acceptable. Results did not change\nsubstantially after excluding fasting subjects\nwith higher than expected serum glucose (i.e.,\nrisk of fasting time exaggeration), or those at\nrisk of \"other-than-water\" dietary BPA expo-\nsure during fasting. Although subjects who\nreported adequate fasting were compensated\n$30 more than those who did not, \"adequate\"\nfasting was defined as 9.5 hr for the morning\nexamination session and 6 hr for the afternoon\nand evening sessions. Because longer fasting\ntimes than these provided no additional com-\npensation, we do not believe intentional exag-\ngeration is a satisfactory explanation of our\nresults beyond these fasting time minimums.\nBecause we did not use complex sur-\nvey variables in our primary analyses, these\nresults cannot be precisely generalized to the\nentire U.S. population. However, because we\nadjusted for the demographic covariates related\nto oversampling, the complex survey analy-\nsis method proposed by Korn and Graubard\n(1991) would produce regression coefficients\n(and thus population-based half-lives) very sim-\nilar to ours. The difference is that their method,\nlike other such survey methods, increases the\nstandard errors and would make it more dif-\nficult to detect a BPA decline with slope dif-\nferent from zero. Our smaller standard errors\nare thus more similar to those found in typical\ncross-sectional studies, except that NHANES\nTable 3.

A positive slope (increasing BPA with time) translates to \"doubling time\" and a negative pop\u00bd.

Population-based half-\nlife could be inflated by measurement error in\npopulation data, and its variance by differences\nin exposure. Nevertheless, a large discordance\nbetween the measured population-based rate\nand the rate predicted by current assumptions\nmay be a clue that the assumptions are either\nincomplete or incorrect. Although, in our study,\nwe used this approach to examine a food-based\nexposure, it could also be applicable whenever a\nsignificant population exposure can be abruptly\nterminated, such as when a pesticide is banned.\nRisk assessments for BPA have been based\nin part on evidence that food is the primary,\nand almost exclusive, exposure source, and that\nrapid and complete BPA elimination occurs after\nexposure (European Chemicals Bureau 2003;\nEuropean Food Safety Authority 2006; NTP\n2008). The persistence of population BPA levels\ndespite extended fasting appears to contradict\nthis evidence.   to resolve this contradic-\ntion could include experimental pharmaco\nkinetic\nstudies of chronic BPA exposure, continued\nsearch for important non\nfood sources, and fur-\nther investigation of BPA in human adipose tis-\nsue and its effects on adipokine production.
