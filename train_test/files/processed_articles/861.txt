Domestic violence was defined as\nreporting that both partners were physi-\ncally violent during arguments.\nResults--It was found that non-employed\nrespondents are not at greater risk of\nfamily violence in comparison with em-\nployed respondents, after controlling for\nalcohol misuse, income, education, age,\nand other factors; however, employed per-\nsons receiving welfare benefits are at\nsignificantly higher risk. Alcohol misuse,\nwhich remains a predictor of violence\neven after controlling for other factors,\nincreases the risk of family violence while\nsatisfaction with social support from fam-\nily and friends decreases it.\nConclusion--These results underscore the\nimportant eVect of alcohol misuse on\ndomestic violence, and the need to moni-\ntor the potential impact of welfare reform\non domestic violence.\nFamily violence has been recognised as a pub-\nlic health problem for almost a decade,1 and the\nhealth care cost associated with treatment of\nfamily violence injuries in the United States has\nbeen estimated as high as $857 million\nlence Survey data, Straus and Gelles found an\nannual incidence of marital aggression of\nhomicides were the result of intrafamilial\nviolence.4 Estimates are that as many as 2 to 4\nmillion women a year are physically battered by\ntheir intimate partners.5 Men are as likely as\nwomen to resort to physical aggression during\nmarital conflicts but women are more likely to\nreport injury from such interchanges.6\nFamily violence has been associated with\ngender and power issues7\u00ad9; structural and\nsociodemographic characteristics such as age,\nsocioeconomic status, unemployment, cohabit-\ning status, and partnership stability10\u00ad13; alcohol\nresearch on family violence has produced\nresults that are diYcult to integrate conceptu-\nally or empirically. Most of this research has\nbeen on small select samples and cross\nsectional.\nThe role of alcohol in violence is especially\nalcohol use may aggravate marital diYculties\nleading to separation or divorce,17 and alcohol\nproblems may have an indirect eVect on earn-\nings and marriage.20 21 One longitudinal study,\nhowever, found that alcohol consumption was\nsignificantly related to physical aggression six\nmonths immediately before and after marriage,\nbut the eVects washed out at 18 months.22\nOthers have suggested that structural factors\nsuch as unemployment may disrupt commu-\nnity and social relationships leading to greater\nrisk behaviour such as alcohol consumption.13\nUnemployment, however, has been inconsist-\nently related to both alcohol intake13 23 and vio-\nlent incidents.24 Job loss has been found to be\nrelated to an increase of negative behaviours\nbetween partners,24 but again the relation\nbetween job loss and violence is not clear cut.\nWhile small increases in lay oVs are associated\nwith more violent incidents, large increases are\nassociated with reduced incidence.25\nEmployment in itself does not necessarily\nprotect couples from marital violence. Stressful\nwork experiences have also been found to be\nassociated with wife abuse.26 In addition, it has\nbeen suggested that an increase of female\nemployment and transitions towards diVerent\nforms of relationships may generate tensions\nthat could increase the likelihood of marital\nviolence.27 This is particularly relevant given\nour fast changing economy and increasing\nemployment demands on young parents,28 29\nincluding those receiving welfare benefits.\nThere is evidence that welfare reform\naccounted for 44% of the employment rate\nResponsibility and Work Opportunity Recon-\nwill force more women with young children to\nwork. In the current policy debate, not only is\nthere little concern with the impact of welfare\nreform on women's health,32 but little thought\nhas been given to a potential for increased\ndomestic violence.\nIncreasingly social scientists note the\nimportance of taking context into account\nwhen explaining outcomes and the necessity of\nlooking at the way in which family, work, and\ncommunity factors interrelate to explain atti-\ntudes and behaviours.33\u00ad36 Research on violence\nCornell University,\nDepartment of Policy\nAnalysis and\nManagement, and\nGraduate School of\nMedical Sciences,\nMedical College and\nSloan-Kettering\nDivisions, USA\nE Rodriguez\nThe Health\nInstitute/Division of\nClinical Care Research\nof the New England\nMedical Center and\nthe Department of\nMedicine of Tufts\nUniversity School of\nMedicine, USA\nK E Lasch\nCornell Institute for\nSocial and Economic\nResearch, Cornell\nUniversity, USA\nP Chandra\nThe Health\nInstitute/Division of\nClinical Care Research\nof the New England\nMedical Center, USA\nJ Lee\nCorrespondence to:\nHall, Cornell University,\nAccepted for publication\nwww.jech.com\nshould also consider the impact of social and\nThe goal of this study is to contribute to our\nunderstanding of the complex and important\nissue of family violence. Using panel data from\nand Households (NSFH), we attempt to\ndisentangle the eVects of employment, partner-\nship instability, and alcohol use in the risk of\ndomestic violence.\nFigure 1 summarises our explanatory model.\nWe take advantage of longitudinal data and\ncontrolling for individual and household char-\nacteristics and prior problems with alcohol\nmisuse, violent arguments, and joblessness\ninfluence of current alcohol misuse, and\nemployment status on current violence (1992\nvariable). Our explanatory model draws from a\nsociostructural approach, in the sense that vio-\nlent arguments are seen as arising from chang-\ning and increasing demands placed on the\nfamily,26 38 and from a social learning approach\nthat considers the influence of variables such as\noccupational status on the onset of violence.26\nWe broaden the employment status variable to\ninclude working and receiving welfare.\nMethods\nDATA\nThe 1987 NSFH survey consisted of inter-\nover-sample of minorities and households con-\ntaining single parent families, stepfamilies,\nrecently married couples, and cohabiting\noriginal sample, which represents an attrition\nrate of 23%. We analysed possible diVerences\nbetween respondents to the 1992 survey and\nthose who were lost to follow up after the 1987\ninterview. There were no significant diVerences\nin attrition rates by gender, age, ethnic group,\nand marital status between those who were\nre-interviewed and those lost to follow up. We\nlimited our study to respondents older than 16\nyears of age in 1987, and who were not retired\nindividuals were included in our analyses.\nMEASURES\nIn this study we focus on violent arguments in\nwhich both partners participate. About 60% of\nrespondents who engaged in violent arguments\nin 1992 reported that both partners used\nrespondents who reported having violent argu-\nments only 25 reported being the only\nperpetrator of violence, and 71 said that only\nthe spouse or partner used violence. We\nconsidered these two groups to be too small to\ninclude in our analysis and excluded them. We\nexplored possible reporting diVerences be-\ntween the three variants of family violence--\nthat is, spouse/partner violent, respondent vio-\nlent, and both mutually violent. In general,\nthose who reported that only the partner used\nphysical violence were, on average, older (mean\nwho also reported being active participants in\nviolent arguments.\nAs noted in a previous analysis of the NSFH,\nwomen were as likely as men to commit violent\nacts, but women were more likely to report\nbeing injured than men.39 Here we focus on\npredictors of violent interchanges not on their\npossible consequences.\nOur dependent variable, family violence, was\nmeasured by the question: In the past year, did\nboth respondent and partner become physi-\ncally violent during an argument? We investi-\ngated potential diVerences between respond-\nents and non-respondents to this question in\nterms of gender, alcohol drinking patterns,\nrace/ethnicity, and total number of children in\nthe household. The number of non-\nrespondents was small (n=171) and no signifi-\ncant diVerences were observed between\ngroups.\nWe constructed an employment situation\nvariable from several variables that asked about\nrespondents' employment and sources of\nincome in 1992. Respondents were divided\ninto four categories: (a) full time employed, (b)\npart time employed, (c) working while receiv-\ning welfare benefits, and (d) non-employed.\nGiven the few episodes of violence reported by\nretired people (only 2 of 327 retired respond-\nFigure 1 Explanatory model.\nFixed personal\ncharacteristics\nOther individual and\nhousehold characteristics\nEmployment status\nAlcohol drinking\nDissatisfaction with\nsocial relationships\nAge\nSex\nRace/ethnicity\nEducation\nFamily income\nNumber of children\nBackground risk\nfactors\nReporting violent\nChange of partner\nHaving a mental or\nphysical condition that\ncould limit the ability\nof working for pay\nReporting having\nproblems with alcohol\nLength of time\nunemployed and looking\nFamily violence, employment status, welfare benefits, and alcohol drinking 173\nwww.jech.com\nents reported violence), this group was not\nincluded in our analysis. Of all 1055 non-\nemployed respondents only 76 were looking for\nwork, and of those only six reported violent\narguments, which did not allow us to look at\nthem separately. In addition, 208 non-\nemployed respondents were receiving some\ntype of social or welfare benefits. Preliminary\nanalysis showed that they were not statistically\ndiVerent from other non-working people, and\nwe kept them together to increase the statistical\npower of our model.\nWe used the total number of drinks that the\nrespondent had in the past 30 days as our\nmeasure of alcohol drinking in 1992. Covari-\nates we controlled for were the respondent's\ngender, age, race/ethnicity, partnership stabil-\nity, years of education, total household income,\nnumber of children in the household, satisfac-\ntion with friends and family, and having a\nmental or physical condition that could limit\nthe ability to work for pay. Partnership stability\nwas measured as three diVerent types of\npartnership: (a) respondents that were in stable\nrelationships (that is, married or living together\nrespondents that have a diVerent partner than\nthe one they had in 1987; and (c) new couples\n(that is, those who were not married or living\ntogether in 1987). Besides taking into consid-\neration partnership stability, we explored\nwhether other partner characteristics such as\nhaving had problems with alcohol or drugs\ncould have an impact on predicting family vio-\nlence. However, very few respondents indi-\ncated that their partners or other family mem-\nbers have had problems with drugs or alcohol\nin 1987, and we were not able to include this\nvariable in our analysis.\nOther background factors included in our\nmodel were number of weeks unemployed and\nlooking for work in 1991, reporting engaging in\nviolent arguments in 1987, and having alcohol\nWe conducted logistic regression analyses to\nexamine the relations of interest using SAS.40\nIn all our analyses, we weight the survey\nresponses to account for the over-sampling of\nspecial populations in the survey, including\nAfrican American, single parent families, fami-\nlies with step children, cohabiting couples and\nrecently married persons. The weights were\nprepared by the NSFH researchers.41 We used\nBox-Cox transformation of the income, and\nalcohol intake variables, a frequently used pro-\ncedure that smoothes out the eVect of outlier\nvalues and approximates the variables to a nor-\nmal distribution. The transformations were\nsuYcient to produce reasonable residual plots\n(see tables for details on the transformations\nused). We examined the correlations among all\nvariables, performed diagnostic tests for col-\nlinearity, and no problems were found.\nWe did not replace any missing values of the\ndependent variable. For the categorical inde-\npendent variables we added an additional\ngroup of \"no response or not applicable\" where\nnecessary, in order to include all respondents in\nour analysis. For the continuous independent\nvariables we replaced missing values by imput-\ning them with the predicted value estimated for\nthe age, gender, ethnic, marital status, and\nemployment situation group of the respondent.\nFirstly, we conducted logistic regression in\nour full model described in figure 1. To have\nsuYcient cell size to examine interaction eVects\nbetween employment situation and social sup-\nport, alcohol use, and number of children, we\nthen dropped some of the variables that were\nnon-significant in our first analysis, and created\na shorter model. Our reduced model controls\nfor age, sex, income, education, and prior\nviolence (1987), while analysing the impact of\ncurrent employment status, alcohol drinking,\nsatisfaction with relationships, and number of\nchildren in the household. We then ran three\nseparate models with interactions for satisfac-\ntion with relationships, alcohol misuse, and\nnumber of children.\nResults\nTable 1 presents a description of our sample.\narguments in which both partners were physi-\ncally violent toward each other. As shown in\ntable 1, women were slightly more likely than\nmen to report the occurrence of violent\narguments.\nThe average household income and years of\neducation are lower among those who report\nviolent arguments than among those who do\nnot report them. Respondents who engage in\nviolent arguments have more children, and\nreport more alcohol drinking and weeks of\nunemployment in 1991 than respondents who\ndo not report violence. The average age of\nrespondents engaging in violent arguments is\n33 years (SD 6.7), while the average age of\nthose not resorting to violence is 40 years (SD\nFull time employed people are less likely and\nthose working while receiving welfare benefits\nare more likely to report violence relative to\nother employment status groups.

Table 1 includes a description of the\nsample by gender group, and the possible\nimplications of not analysing them separately\nare considered in the discussion section.\nTable 2 presents the results of our first logis-\ntic regression analyses using the full model\ndescribed in figure 1. Significant predictors for\nviolent arguments include number of children\nin the household, alcohol drinking in 1992, and\nprevious (1987) history of engaging in violent\narguments. The risk of violence was greater for\npeople who were working while receiving\nwelfare relative to the referent (full time\nemployed).\nTwo factors significantly reduce the likeli-\nhood of engaging in violent arguments: age and\nsatisfaction with relationships with family\n(other than spouse) and friends. Higher\nincome and education are also associated with\nless likelihood of reporting violence, but the\nconfidence intervals are relatively wide.\nMen and women are not significantly diVer-\nent in reporting having arguments in which\nboth partners were physically violent. Other\nfactors that are not statistically significant in\npredicting violence include race/ethnicity, part-\nnership stability, having a physical or mental\nlimitation that could restrict the ability of\nworking for pay, the numbers of week of unem-\nployment while looking for work in 1991, and\nprevious (1987) history of having alcohol\nproblems.\nTable 3 presents the results of our reduced\nmodel where we dropped variables that did not\nattain significance in the full model, and three\nseparate models that include reduced model\nvariables and interaction eVects for employ-\nment status and satisfaction with relationships\nor alcohol misuse or number of children. In our\nreduced model we find that people working\nwhile receiving welfare are almost four times\nmore likely to report violence than other work-\nTable 1 Sample characteristics\nCharacteristics of respondents\nComplete sample Women respondents Men respondents\nViolent\narguments:\n(both partners)\nNo violent\narguments\nViolent\narguments:\n(both partners)\nNo violent\narguments\nViolent\narguments:\n(both partners)\nNo violent\narguments\nEmployment status in 1992 Number (%) Number (%) Number (%) Number (%) Number (%) Number (%)\nHousehold characteristics\nSex\nEthnicity\nMean (SD) Mean (SD)\nTable 2 Multiple logistic regression model of association between family violence and\nemployment status, adjusted for sociodemographic diVerences (long model)\nFactor Odds ratio\n95% Confidence intervals\nLower Upper\nEmployment history\nHousehold characteristics\nSex\nEthnicity\nWhite 1 -- --\nPhysical condition\nAny health condition limiting working for pay?\nNo 1 -- --\nDid respondent had alcohol problems in 1987?\n*Income in thousands of dollars **0.25.

Number of alcohol drinks,\nand number of children in the family are again\nsignificant risk factors for violent arguments,\nand satisfaction with social relationships sig-\nnificantly protects against violence.\nColumns 2 to 4 of table 3 summarise our\nanalyses that include interaction eVects. We\nrun interactions of employment status with the\nother three factors significantly associated with\nviolence and of theoretical interest to us--\nsatisfaction with relationships, alcohol drinks\nand number of children in the family in\nseparate, parallel models. Relative to full time\nworkers a higher number of children signifi-\ncantly increases the risk of violence for the\nnon-employed. Relative to full time workers\nmore alcohol drinks slightly increases the risk\nof violence for the non-employed. Numbers of\nchildren and alcohol drinks does not signifi-\ncantly increase the risk of violence for those\nworking while receiving welfare relative to full\ntime workers. Satisfaction with relationships\ndoes not significantly interact with employ-\nment status to predict violence. We do not\ninclude a model with all main and interaction\neVects because of cell size considerations. Thus\nwe cannot simultaneously compare the modify-\ning eVects of alcohol drinks, satisfaction with\nrelationships and number of children on the\nrelationship between employment status and\nviolence.\nDiscussion\nIn this study we focus on arguments in which\nboth partners engage in physical violence,\nwhich represent about 60% of cases of family\nviolence in the NSFH. People who are only\nrecipients of violence by their partners may\nhave diVerent characteristics than those who\nreact violently, and should be studied sepa-\nrately. In addition, it should be noted that our\nsample included respondents who were in a\nand those who were in a new or diVerent rela-\ntionship in 1992. Respondents that were not in\na relationship in 1992 could not be included in\nthe analysis. Generalisations to the whole US\npopulation should be made cautiously.\nThe greatest strength of this study is that it is\nbased on a national probability sample thereby\nreducing sample selection bias and includes a\nrich set of important variables to permit exam-\nination of potential confounders. Our study\npresents a number of important findings. In\ncontrast with popular perception we find that\nrace/ethnicity is not a significant factor in pre-\ndicting violent arguments when other factors\nare accounted for. Partnership instability has\nnot been controlled for in previous studies of\nalcohol and family violence; however, we find\npartnership instability to not be a risk factor for\nviolence, after controlling for other factors.\nAs previously reported in the literature, alco-\nhol use is positively associated with violent\narguments in the same year. Alcohol use five\nyears earlier seems not to aVect current\nviolence. Prior research has not clarified the\nmodifying eVect of alcohol misuse on the rela-\ntion between unemployment and violence. We\ndo find that alcohol interacts with non-\nemployment to predict violence; alcohol use,\nmoreover, does not increase the risk of violence\namong other employed groups in relation to\nthe full time employed. It should be noted that\nwe used a measure of alcohol intake widely\nused in the alcohol research literature (that is,\nnumber of drinks in the past 30 days).42 Many\nof our other variables of interest report events\nin the past 6 or 12 months, which may possibly\nlimit the usefulness of the alcohol variable. We\nTable 3 Reduced model, and interactions.

Our\nexclusion criteria, and the factors we control\nfor in our model, should eliminate most of the\ndiVerences among the various groups of people\nincluded in our model, but uncontrolled\nvariables determining both resources and\noutcomes may still exist. People who have anti-\nsocial personality characteristics are also likely\nto drink in large amounts43\u00ad45; making causal\ninterpretations diYcult because of potential\nconfounding of characteristics of people most\nlikely to be violent with the circumstances\nunder which they drink and become violent.\nNeither personality characteristics nor circum-\nstances can explain alcohol related violence\nwithout consideration of the purposes served\nby drinking and the properties of alcohol in\nrelation to violence.46 Personality characteris-\ntics are not included as variables in our study,\nbut we control for previous history of both vio-\nlence and alcohol problems. Those who\nreported violent arguments in 1987 are almost\nsix times more likely to report violence in 1992.\nUnder-reporting is an additional limitation\nof most studies of family violence because it is\na sensitive issue about which people may be\nhesitant to speak openly. The possible reasons\nfor under-reporting in the NSFH data have\nbeen previously discussed.39 The NSFH placed\nthe violence questions in the middle of a\nlengthy interview, and kept the questions\ngeneral rather than specific. In addition, the\nquestions referred to violence only in the con-\ntext of disagreements, while violent abuse\ncould occur without being prompted by a disa-\ngreement, and sexual violence was not in-\ncluded in the definition. When we analysed the\nsmall number of missing responses to the\nviolence questions we did not find evidence of\ndiVerences between respondents and non-\nrespondents regarding, age, sex or marital sta-\ntus.\nSample size considerations did not allow us\nto run models separately for men and women\ntaking into account who was the perpetrator of\nthe violence. In future research it would be\nuseful to study men and women separately to\nbetter understand the possible relation be-\ntween women employment patterns, age of\nchildren in the household, and other determi-\nnants that could influence the permanence of\nwomen in violent relationships. In future stud-\nies it would also be useful to include additional\ninformation on partners' characteristics.\nLarger sample sizes, new methods of diminish-\ning underreporting, and/or diVerent method-\nological approaches will be necessary to build\non this line of research.\nIn conclusion, perhaps the most important\nfindings of this study are the increased risk of\nviolence if working and receiving welfare and\nthe inhibiting eVect of satisfaction with social\nrelationships on violence. In view of recent\nwelfare reform strategies our findings are\nparticularly relevant. Our results indicate that,\nrelative to the employed, people working while\nreceiving welfare could be at greater risk for\nviolence.\nOne plausible explanation for the increased\nrisk for respondents receiving welfare while\nworking is that the additional stress associated\nwith working in low skills jobs when coping\nwith poverty and child care issues puts people\nat a higher risk of family violence. Recent\nresearch shows that working couples with small\nchildren tend to work more hours than others,\nand they report the lowest quality of life among\nworking couples (P Moen et al, Annual\nMeeting of the American Association of\nScience, Anaheim, California, January 1999).\nHowever, we find that more children slightly\nincreases the risk of violence only for the\nunemployed relative to full time workers. This\nsuggests that job conditions, for example, low\nskill or less secure; personality characteristics;\nstigma related to receiving welfare; or some\nother unmeasured characteristic may explain\nthis very intriguing result.\nAt any rate, this study suggests we should\ncontinue to take a comprehensive approach to\nproblems of domestic violence. We have identi-\nfied a group who is particularly at risk for fam-\nily violence, which makes it critical to monitor\nthe impact of welfare reform on family\nviolence.\nThe data were generously provided by the Center for Demogra-\nphy and Ecology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
