Unaided screening is inaccurate and reflects\ncommon misperceptions about the safety of oral contra-\nceptives. Over-the-counter provision of this method\nlikely would be safe, especially for younger women and if\nindependent blood pressure screening were encouraged.\nEvidence from the 2002 National Survey of Family\nGrowth suggests that contraceptive use among\nwomen at risk of unintended pregnancy has declined\nin recent years.1 Limited access may contribute to\ncontraceptive nonuse, and the prescription require-\nment for hormonal methods may further deter initia-\ntion and continuation.2 The public health benefits of\nover-the-counter access to oral contraceptives have\nbeen debated for years,3 and a recent study demon-\nstrated the acceptability and feasibility of pharmacist\nprovision of hormonal methods.4\nOne criterion for determining whether combined\noral contraceptives could be provided safely over-the-\ncounter is demonstrating that women can screen\nthemselves for medical contraindications to use.

Another study used data from the Mexican\nNational Health Survey and compared the health\nprofiles and contraindications to oral contraceptive\nuse among women obtaining pills from pharmacies\nand those who received pills from a public or private\nclinic.6 Although women who obtained pills from\nclinics had a lower prevalence of contraindications to\npill use than those who purchased their pills directly\nfrom pharmacies, the differences between these\ngroups were not statistically significant. Furthermore,\nthe authors' analysis from the Mexican National\nSurvey of Reproductive Health showed that the ma-\njority of women (69.2%) who currently purchased oral\ncontraceptives at pharmacies had begun use under\nmedical supervision through a private doctor or pub-\nlic clinic.6\nIn a recent study from Washington state, Shotor-\nbani et al demonstrated that women's responses to a\nmedical eligibility checklist for hormonal contracep-\ntives were just as accurate as a provider's formal\nevaluation.7 In an item-by-item analysis, agreement\nassessment and the provider's assessment of whether\nshe had a given contraindication. Furthermore, the\nauthors showed that where women and providers\ndisagreed, women were more likely to report contra-\nindications than were providers. Of note, fewer than\n5% of the women in this study were judged to be\ncontraindicated to hormonal contraceptive use.7\nAlthough these studies demonstrate the general\neffectiveness of women to screen themselves for con-\ntraindications to oral contraceptive use, the popula-\ntions studied were restricted to women already using\nhormonal contraception or accessing family planning\nservices. Therefore, it is possible that women who had\nalready screened themselves out of oral contraceptive\nuse were not included. In this study, we surveyed both\noral contraceptive users and nonusers to reduce the\npossibility of selection bias.\nThe purpose of this study was to estimate the\naccuracy of a woman's self-assessment regarding\nwhether she was contraindicated to oral contracep-\ntive use among a convenience sample in the general\npopulation. The self-assessment first was performed\nunaided and then repeated using a simple medical-\nscreening checklist. The gold standard to which\nthese assessments were compared was an assess-\nment by a nurse practitioner.\nThis study was part of the Border Contraceptive\nAccess Study, a 5-year project examining oral contra-\nceptive use along the U.S.\u00adMexican border. Between\nMay and July 2006, bilingual (English/Spanish) fe-\nmale interviewers approached women in two shop-\nping malls and an outdoor flea market in El Paso,\nTexas, and invited them to participate in the study.\nWomen between 18 and 49 years of age and able to\ncomplete the interview in English or Spanish were\neligible to participate. Information on refusal to par-\nticipate was not collected, but study staff reported that\nvery few women declined to participate in the survey.\nInterviewers asked women about basic sociode-\nmographic information as well as about their current\ncontraceptive use. Women who were not current\nhormonal contraceptive users were asked whether\nthey thought the pill would be an appropriate birth\ncontrol choice given their medical history and regard-\nless of their intent to use this method. We assumed\nthat current hormonal contraceptive users would con-\nsider pill use safe for them and therefore did not ask\nthem the question.\nNext, all women were given a checklist of medi-\ncal contraindications to combined oral contraceptive\nuse and were asked to check whether they had one or\nmore of the listed conditions. The checklist was based\non the World Health Organization (WHO) Medical\nEligibility Criteria for relative and absolute contrain-\ndications to combined oral contraceptives (category 3\nand 4 contraindications)8 and was based on an instru-\nment that previously had been validated.7 We did not\ninclude conditions that are considered category 2\ncontraindications because the WHO states that in\nsituations with limited clinical judgment it is reason-\nable to use the method when an individual has such a\ncontraindication. The questions included in the\nchecklist are listed in the Box.\nImmediately after completing the questionnaire,\nwomen were screened by a nurse practitioner who\nwas blinded to the woman's responses in the inter-\nview. One of five female nurse practitioners evaluated\neach woman who completed a questionnaire. The\nclinician's screening instrument included, in addition\nto background demographic information, a medical\nhistory that focused on WHO category 3 and 4\ncontraindications. The nurse practitioner also mea-\nsured and recorded the respondent's blood pressure\neither manually or using an automated Omron HEM-\n705CP blood pressure monitor (Omron Healthcare,\nInc., Bannockburn, IL). Blood pressure was measured\ntwice, and the mean systolic and mean diastolic\nmeasurements were recorded. Based on this informa-\ntion, the nurse practitioner determined whether the\nrespondent was contraindicated to oral contraceptive\nuse or not. If the provider felt that additional tests or\nevaluation were necessary before prescribing pills, the\nrespondent was classified as contraindicated.\nFor their participation, women received a $5\u00ad$10\ngift card valid for use at the shopping center or flea\nmarket. The study was approved by the institutional\nreview boards of the University of Texas at Austin\nand the University of Texas at El Paso. We obtained\nverbal informed consent from all participants.\nQuestionnaire data were entered into a Microsoft\nAccess (Redmond, WA) database and analyzed using\nStata 9.2 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX). Univa-\nriable descriptive statistics were generated to char-\nacterize the study participants and to describe the\noverall distribution of responses. We used the\npoint-estimate and 95% confidence interval (CI) to\nmeasure the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and\nnegative predictive values of the self-assessments\n(with and without the contraindication checklist).\nNinety-five percent CIs for the sensitivity and\nspecificity measurements were calculated according\nto the efficient-score method.9 The McNemar 2\ntest was used to assess whether participants were\nequally likely to incorrectly self-report a contrain-\ndication as to incorrectly self-report eligibility for\npill use. We used logistic regression to model the\noutcome variable of interest (participant\u00adprovider\nagreement) and to estimate agreement among sub-\ngroups defined by age, language preference, edu-\ncation, parity, and contraceptive use.\nBased on data from the 1998 National Health\nInterview Survey, we estimated that approximately\n15% of women of reproductive age in the general\npopulation are contraindicated for oral contraceptive\nuse.10 For this study, we sought to estimate whether\n1% of the population or more might falsely believe\nthat oral contraceptives are appropriate for them\nwhen, in fact, they are medically contraindicated. We\ndetermined that a sample size of 1,200 would give us\nRESULTS\nA total of 1,271 women agreed to participate.

According to the McNemar 2 test, there was no\nsignificant difference between the proportion incorrectly\nself-reporting a contraindication using the checklist and\nthe proportion incorrectly self-reporting eligibility for\npill use.

Overall, self-\nscreening or clinician-screening data were missing for\nthree participants. Participants for whom data were\nmissing were excluded from analyses requiring those\nresponses.\nAgreement between the respondent's self-screen\nand the clinician screen was 98% or higher for each of\nthe individual contraindications except for two. In the\ncase of hypertension, 9% of the respondents were found\nto be hypertensive (systolic blood pressure 140 mm Hg\nor higher or diastolic blood pressure 90 mm Hg or\nhigher) and did not know this to be the case. With\nregard to migraine headaches, 6% of the respondents\nbelieved their condition made them ineligible to use the\npill, but the nurse practitioner did not assess their\nmigraine as one involving aura, which is the true\ncontraindication.\nWe used logistic regression models to assess the\nassociation between selected demographic character-\nistics (including age, education, language spoken at\nhome, recruitment site, parity, and contraceptive use)\nand respondents' incorrect self-assessment of one or\nmore contraindications to pill use. The coefficients in\nthese models indicate that women age 35 and older\nhad significantly higher odds of incorrectly self-re-\nporting that they were eligible for pill use compared\nwith younger women (P.05).

Shortridge and\nMiller examined the prevalence of contraindications to\ncombined oral contraceptives in the U.S. general popu-\nlation using data from the National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES) and found that 16% of\nfecund females aged 10 to 51 were contraindicated to\noral contraceptives.11 Only nine contraindicated dis-\neases were recorded in the NHANES dataset, and\nseveral prevalent conditions such as migraine with aura\nwere not identifiable. The study from Washington\nfound that, among women presenting to a family\nplanning clinic, 4.6% were contraindicated to hor-\nmonal contraceptive use.7 Although it is certainly\nsurprising that the prevalence of contraindications is\n10-fold larger in our sample, there are important\ndifferences between our study and the report from\nWashington. Eighty-eight percent of the women in\nthe Washington study were seeking hormonal contra-\nception, and 90% were between the ages of 15 and\n30.7 Our population was older, which increases the\nlikelihood of being contraindicated to oral contracep-\ntives, and a smaller proportion was using hormonal\ncontraception, suggesting they were less likely to have\nbeen previously screened for contraindications. The\nprevalence of contraindications reported here is closer\nto that reported using data from a national health survey\nin Mexico,6 although, like the report based on the\nNHANES data, that study was not able to include\nmigraine with aura as a contraindication.\nA simple question asking a woman whether she\nthought the pill was medically safe for her served as a\npoor screening test for being contraindicated to oral\ncontraceptive use. Using a medical checklist of contra-\nindications, women were more accurate in their self-\nassessments. One way to evaluate screening tests,\nknown as Youden's J, involves adding the positive\npredictive and negative predictive values and subtract-\ning one.12 This value for the initial self-screening ques-\ntion is 0.13, indicating poor accuracy that scarcely\nimproves on a coin toss, whereas it is 0.72 for screening\nusing the medical checklist, indicating much better--\nalthough not perfect--accuracy. However, it is important\nto remember that a screening test's positive and negative\npredictive values are dependent on the prevalence of\nthe condition in the population screened.13 The popula-\ntion studied here had a high prevalence of contraindi-\ncations, and it may be that self-screening using the\nmedical checklist would have lower positive and nega-\ntive predictive values in a population with a lower\nprevalence of contraindications.\nThe main conditions that contributed to being\ncontraindicated to oral contraceptives were hyperten-\nsion, migraine with aura, and smoking over age 34. It\nis important to note that only the first condition is\npossibly unknowable to the woman. In the case of\nmigraine with aura, we found that women were more\nlikely to self-screen themselves out of oral contraceptive\nuse when, in fact, the nurse practitioner assessed that the\nrespondent's headaches did not contraindicate pill use, a\nfinding that has been reported previously.7\nSome women were found to be better at self-\nscreening than others. Younger women were better\nthan older women, largely because older women\nwere more likely to have unrecognized hypertension.\nMore educated women also were found to be more\naccurate self-screeners. Interestingly, a study of data\nfrom Mexico found that women who obtained oral\ncontraceptives over-the-counter were more educated\nthan those who obtained pills from a clinic.6 Our\nfindings that Spanish speakers were more accurate at\nself-screening also merits further investigation.\nHow accurate does self-screening need to be to be\nconsidered \"good enough\"? It is unlikely that any\nscreening assessment for contraindications will be 100%\nsensitive and specific, and even clinician screening ap-\npears to be flawed. The study based on data from the\nNHANES found that 6% of current pill users in the\nUnited States actually were contraindicated for use11\neven though the prescription requirement mandates\nclinician screening. Another study using mystery clients\nTable 4. Accuracy of Self-Screening Using Checklist Compared With Provider Screening for\nContraindications to Use of Oral Contraceptives\nRespondent's Self-Screening Using Checklist*\nProvider\nContraindicated Eligible for Pill Use Total\nData are n (%, 95% confidence interval [CI]).\n* Self-screening checklist refers to women's yes/no answers to the medical checklist of possible contraindications to pill use. Women were\nclassified as self-contraindicated if they checked \"yes\" to any of the items on the list.\nin Mexico found that few women seeking pills were\nappropriately screened for contraindications using evi-\ndence-based criteria.14 Although our study reports on a\ndifferent population, our finding that 6.6% of women\nincorrectly thought they were appropriate for pill use\nwhen, in fact, they were contraindicated is remarkably\nsimilar to the proportion of pill users incorrectly\nscreened by clinicians in the NHANES study.11\nThis study had several limitations. The convenience\nsample used here was not representative of the general\npopulation, and the results may not be generalizeable to\nother populations. In particular, it is likely that the\npopulation from which this sample was drawn is less\nlikely to undergo routine health maintenance screening\nand therefore more likely to have unrecognized hyper-\ntension. In addition, although we aimed to evaluate the\naccuracy of self-screening in the general population, our\nresults cannot be extrapolated to a population seeking\nhormonal contraception, which likely is younger and\nhas a lower prevalence of contraindications. Further-\nmore, several factors likely led to the over-diagnosis of\ncontraindications. The nurse practitioners used a study\ninstrument that forced them to evaluate for the presence\nof every category 3 or 4 contraindication, and this\nevaluation was likely much more rigorous that the\ntypical evaluation of a woman seeking contraception in\na clinic. In addition, a diagnosis of hypertension cannot\nbe based on a single measurement, and at least some\ncases of elevated blood pressure may have been \"white\ncoat\" hypertension. Finally, most of the nurse practitio-\nners had minimal experience prescribing hormonal\ncontraception and generally erred toward requesting fur-\nther evaluation (which led to a participant being catego-\nrized as contraindicated) if they were not confident that\noral contraceptive use was safe for a given condition.\nOverall, these findings suggest that women can,\nby and large, accurately self-screen for contraindica-\ntions to pill use using a checklist of contraindications.\nMoreover, women who are likely to seek contracep-\ntion--especially younger women--are able to identify\nconditions that might make oral contraceptive use\ndangerous. If anything, self-screening may eliminate\nmore people as appropriate candidates than clinician\nscreening. In an over-the-counter environment, how-\never, women who want to use the pill and find that\nthey are contraindicated by self-screening likely\nwould seek the counsel of a clinician rather than\ndeciding definitively that the method is dangerous for\nthem. It is also possible that a truly contraindicated\nwoman who is very motivated to use oral contracep-\ntives might ignore the results of her self-screening and\nuse the method regardless, much as a woman might\nconceal elements of her medical history, such as\nsmoking, from a clinician to obtain a prescription for\npills. An actual-use study of oral contraceptives pro-\nvided in a simulated over-the-counter setting is\nneeded to answer these remaining questions.\nREFERENCES\n1.
