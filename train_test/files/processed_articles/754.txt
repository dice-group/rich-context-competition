KasP\n'Institute for Health, Health Care Policy, and Aging Research, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, New Jersey,\ndepartment of Epidemiology and Public Health, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut.\nDoes religious involvement influence changes in physical health? We perform a longitudinal analysis of the effect\nof religious participation on functioning over a 12-year follow-up period, in a large, prospective, representative\nsample of elderly persons from New Haven, Connecticut, a religiously diverse community. To examine the possi-\nbility that disability or changes in disability may be affecting religious involvement, we perform a second longitudi-\nnal analysis of changes in religious practices. Finally, we ask whether psychosocial correlates explain the effect of\nreligious involvement on disability. Findings are (a) that attendance at services is a strong predictor of better func-\ntioning, even when intermediate changes in functioning are included, (b) that health practices, social ties, and in-\ndicators of well-being reduce, but do not eliminate these effects, and (c) that disability has minimal effects on sub-\nsequent attendance. The findings illustrate the short- and long-term importance of religious participation to the\nhealth and well-being of elderly people, and suggest a particular significance for religious participation in the lives\nof disabled elders.\nWHAT is known about the relationship between reli-\ngion and health over time? One of the most common\nfindings in the sociology of religion is that attendance at\nreligious services declines in old age. Cross-sectional\n(Ainlay, Singleton, and Swigert, 1992), retrospective (Bahr,\nage-period-cohort analyses (Ploch and Hastings, 1994)\nshow that attendance at religious services declines among\nelderly persons, beginning at about age 70.\nDiscussion of these findings assumes, or the data even\ndemonstrate (Ainlay, Singleton, and Swigert, 1992; Levin\nand Markides, 1985), that the declining pattern is due to the\npoorer health of the most aged respondents. The causal\nmodel of the relationship between health and attendance at\nreligious services that underlies these studies is one in\nwhich poor health precedes, and causes a decline in, reli-\ngious observances. Such studies often conclude that mea-\nsurement of religious involvement in old age is incomplete\nif it focuses solely on attendance at religious services, for\nwhich a certain level of functional ability is presumably\nnecessary. The small study by Mindel and Vaughan (1978)\nis cited so often because it was the first to distinguish be-\ntween organizational (attendance at services) and nonorga-\nnizational dimensions of religious practice (praying, listen-\ning to religious programs or music, etc.) and to show that\nthey were differentially associated with health impairment.\nSomewhat at odds with this research tradition in the so-\nciology of religion is the increasingly substantial body of\nwork in religion and health which includes, but is not lim-\nited to, elderly populations. Recent reviews of research on\nreligion and physical and mental health have appeared in\nKoenig (1995), a special issue of the Journal of Social\nstudies in this field have been cross-sectional, and are thus\ninconclusive with respect to causal direction, all find that\nthe evidence is relatively strong that mental and physical\nhealth are better among sample subjects with current reli-\ngious involvement. Our theoretical framework for the lon-\ngitudinal analyses in this article draws on the classical\nmany dimensions of religion are beneficial for the many di-\nmensions of human health, physical and mental. As the\nclassical sociological theorists understood a century ago,\nreligious groups regulate and integrate the individuals who\nmake them up, and offer a view of life that may be particu-\nlarly comforting in old age. The results in the first article\nprovided solid empirical support for this theoretical posi-\ntion. As we argued and demonstrated in the first of these\ntwo articles, elderly people who attend religious services\ntake better care of themselves in the sense of several pre-\nventive practices, they have more opportunities for socializ-\ning with family and friends, and they have a more positive,\noptimistic outlook on life.\nWe would also trace the intellectual lineage of the sec-\nond of these articles to the large population studies of so-\ncial networks and mortality that began to appear in the late\n1986). None of these studies had a focus on religion, but all\nof them included at least one item on attendance or mem-\nbership; membership in religious groups was treated con-\nceptually as a form of social network tie. In each study, re-\nligious attendance or membership was an independent\npredictor of mortality from all causes, although not always\nin all gender and race subgroups. The study undertaken\nhere has a similar design in that it is a large, prospective\nstudy of a representative sample with extensive health sta-\ntus data at baseline and follow-up, and also with somewhat\nlimited measures of religious involvement.\nFour other studies are particularly relevant to the present\neffort. The first use of the religious involvement items later\nemployed in the New Haven Established Populations for\nthe Epidemiologic Study of the Elderly (EPESE) sample\nwas a study by Zuckerman, Kasl, and Ostfeld (1984),\nwhich showed lower mortality rates among religious el-\nderly persons in poor health when they were compared with\nothers who were less devout. Colantonio, Kasl, and Ostfeld\n(1992) showed, in the same EPESE sample employed here,\nthat religious involvement was associated with lower in-\ncidence of stroke, but this association disappeared when\nadditional predictor variables were considered. Our 1992\nstudy (Idler and Kasl, 1992) of the same population showed\nthat public religious involvement had an effect on both\nfunctioning and depression up to three years later. Most re-\ncently, similar measures of religious involvement were used\nby Oxman, Freeman, and Manheimer (1995) in a study\nwhich showed that cardiac patients who felt they received\nno strength and comfort from religion had a higher risk of\ndeath in the 6 months following surgery than those who did\nperceive such comfort.\nHypothesis 1: Religious involvement will be associated with\nbetter functioning over time when initial levels of function-\ning are held constant.\nNotwithstanding our theoretical framework, we do not\nwish to disregard the plausible and empirically demon-\nstrated pattern of disability's effect on subsequent atten-\ndance at religious services. Thus, in the first article, we ex-\namined the 1982 health and disability status determinants\nof both attendance and subjective religiousness. Our find-\nings (in Table 2 of that article) were that attendance at ser-\nvices was strongly associated cross-sectionally with lower\nlevels of disability, and conversely, that subjective religious\nfeelings were weakly associated with higher levels of dis-\nability. These two views, often referred to as causation vs\nselection, are not mutually exclusive. Evidence supporting\nboth causal directions could be found in longitudinal obser-\nvational data; it would be evidence that the relationship be-\ntween religion and health is layered with complexity and\nmay evolve over time in people's lives. One way of ad-\ndressing these issues is by looking at change in religious in-\nvolvement over time; another way is by differentiating or-\nganizational and nonorganizational aspects of religious\ninvolvement. Selection effects may keep disabled people\nfrom attending services, but they should have no diminish-\ning effect on subjective feelings of religiousness.\nHypothesis 2: Disability will be associated with short-term,\nbut not long-term, declines in attendance at religious services.\nWe have chosen functional ability as our outcome mea-\nsure, rather than disease-specific morbidity criteria, for\nseveral reasons. Conveniently, annual follow-ups were\navailable; measuring changes in functioning was a central\ngoal of the EPESE studies. The design of the EPESE stud-\nies has proven to be foresighted; these measures are as-\nsuming an acknowledged role as summary measures of\nhealth status in older populations in that they capture the\ncumulative effects of pathologies, impairments, and their\ncomorbid interactions with each other (Pope and Tarlov,\nfunctioning over time in population samples are appearing\nwith increasing frequency, from the Alameda County\nStudy (Strawbridge et al., 1992), the National Long-Term\nCare Surveys (Boaz, 1994; Manton, Corder, and Stallard,\n1993), the Longitudinal Retirement History Study (Mad-\ndox and Clark, 1992), the Longitudinal Study of Aging\n(Crimmins and Saito, 1993), and the EPESE studies\n(Guralnik et al., 1993). Two findings from these studies are\nimportant for our study design. First, most find that, de-\nspite a general downward trend in functioning for elderly\nsamples followed over time, there are significant minori-\nties that improve in functioning (Boaz, 1994; Crimmins\nterns of functional disability vary for many subgroups in\nthe population, both in baseline levels and in change over\nStrawbridge et al., 1992). These findings suggest that mul-\ntiple endpoints over a long follow-up period would be the\nmost sensitive to change -- which could be improvement\none year, and deterioration the next. They also underscore\nthe importance of taking baseline measures into account,\nand of carefully examining relationships within subgroups.\nBoth of these observations are critical to our focus on\nbaseline-disabled elderly persons.\nFew of these studies have included psychosocial vari-\nables, or even health practices (LaCroix et al., 1993, is an\nexception), as predictors of change in functioning. How-\never, given the now generally accepted role that social ties\nplay in predicting mortality (House, Landis, and Umberson,\n1988), it would appear fruitful, from the point of view of\ndisability research, to pursue these ideas. Our central hy-\npothesis for this study is that religious involvement, which\npromotes individual well-being through regulation, integra-\ntion, and the provision of meaning, will be positively asso-\nciated with better functional ability over 12 years, even\nwhen baseline functioning and health status are taken\ninto account.\nWhile we were interested in examining findings for spe-\ncific subgroups, our intent was more to confirm the overall\nfindings in these subgroups than to search for differences.\nBoth levels of functioning and levels of religiousness could\nbe expected to differ among men and women, Whites and\nBlacks, the young-old and the oldest-old, and Protestants,\nRoman Catholics, and Jews; however, we hypothesize a\ngeneral effect within the sample and do not expect to see\ndifferences by subgroup, with the exception of the group\nwhich already had some measurable disability at the start of\nthe study. While much of the literature appears to presume\nthat disabled elderly people are often unable to attend wor-\nship services, our findings in the cross-sectional analyses\nwere that disabled elderly persons who did attend services\nhad substantial benefits. Because some of these benefits --\nin the form of more social ties and higher levels of well-\nbeing -- accrued especially to the disabled respondents in\nthe sample, our third hypothesis is that there will be stronger\neffects of religious attendance on disability for those who al-\nready have some loss of functioning at the start of the study.\nHypothesis 3: There will be stronger beneficial effects of\nreligious attendance on subsequent disability for those who\nalready have some disability at baseline (interaction effect).\nOur three remaining hypotheses could contribute to our\nunderstanding of mechanisms in the religion-health rela-\ntionship. First, we theorized in the first article that religious\ngroups control the behavior of their members. We found\nempirically that greater attendance at religious services was\nindeed associated with higher levels of physical activity,\nless alcohol use, and a greater likelihood of never having\nsmoked. These baseline correlations could be taken as evi-\ndence of confounding in the relationship: If poorer health\npractices have already resulted in poorer health status, then\nabsence from services could simply be a function of both of\nthese. On the other hand, the alternate causal arguments are\nthat better lifelong health habits promoted by religious\ngroups could preserve health in old age (primary preven-\ntion), or that religious groups could provide assistance and\nsocial support to those changing habits of alcohol consump-\ntion, for example (secondary prevention). Our data do not\nallow us to disentangle those relationships that evolved dur-\ning adulthood and middle age; we can only adjust for these\nfactors at baseline and look at their relationships prospec-\ntively. This said, Hypothesis 4 is that we expect better\nhealth practices among the religiously-involved to explain\npart of the effect of religiousness on functioning.\nHypothesis 4: Some of the effect of religious attendance\non functioning will be explained by the better health prac-\ntices of thefrequent attenders.\nHypothesis 5 is that supportive, integrating social ties,\nwhich are also strongly associated with religious atten-\ndance, and to a lesser degree, subjective religiousness,\nwill partly explain the effect of religiousness on function-\ning. The higher levels of social engagement in daily ac-\ntivities and yearly holiday celebrations of the religiously-\nactive, and their greater density and intensity of kinship\nand friendship networks, act as barriers against social iso-\nlation and loneliness. Like the health practices, their role\ncould be one of primary prevention or secondary preven-\ntion, or both.\nHypothesis 5: Some of the effect of religious attendance on\nfunctioning will be explained by the larger and more active\nsocial networks offrequent attenders.\nHypothesis 6 is that higher levels of well-being among\nthe actively-religious will also be partly explanatory. We\nsaw that attendance at religious services was associated\nnegatively with most of the components of depressive feel-\nings, and positively with optimism, and again the associa-\ntion was particularly strong among the currently disabled.\nIf religious group participation acts to maintain feelings of\nhope, and reduces enervating sadness, it may facilitate re-\ncovery by giving the disabled participant more motivation\nfor rehabilitation and return to full functioning.\nHypothesis 6: Some of the effect of religious attendance on\nfunctioning will be explained by the higher levels of well-\nbeing of thefrequent attenders.\nIn sum, the hypotheses predict a strong longitudinal as-\nsociation between greater religious involvement at the in-\nception of the study, and better functional ability measured\nrepeatedly during the course of the follow-up. We expect\nthis association to be pronounced among, but not limited to,\nthe already-disabled, and we expect that the greater re-\nsources of the religiously-active, i.e., their better health\npractices, more extensive social ties, and higher levels of\nsubjective well-being, will partially explain the effect.\nMETHOD\nSample and Study Design\nThe New Haven site of the EPESE project has been de-\nscribed in detail in other publications (Cornoni-Huntley et\nal., 1986) and in the preceding article. Our additional de-\nscription here emphasizes the longitudinal aspects of the\ndesign. Annual interviews were conducted by telephone or\nnot known to be deceased). Less than 1 percent of the sur-\nviving sample was not traced for the 1994 follow-up. For\nthis longitudinal analysis, we use the annual measures of\nfunctioning, creating multiple endpoints for 1983 through\nvided by respondents or their proxies. Attrition due almost\nentirely to mortality causes the sample size with complete\ndata for the dependent variable to decline annually to N =\ntive study of a heterogeneous sample with close follow-up\nover an extended period, high response rates, and multiple\nmeasures of health status.\nCross-tabulations of survival status at the time of the\n1994 follow-up show that attrition from the sample came\nprimarily from groups one would expect to have a higher\nrisk of mortality: the one-third of the sample with the high-\nest disability scores, those aged 75 and older, and males.\nFor each of these tables (not shown), Mantel-Haenszel chi\nsquares had p-values of less than .001. There were no dif-\nferences in mortality by religious affiliation; Catholics,\nProtestants, Jews, and others all had approximately equal\nrisk. Frequent attendance at services in 1982 was strongly\nbut subjective religiousness was not (M-H \\2 P = -376).\nThese bivariate, unadjusted associations tell us that losses\nto the sample will come primarily from the most disabled,\nbut also that our primary independent variable (attendance\nat services) is associated with retention in the sample.\nMeasures\nFunctional disability. -- The construction of the 1982\nscale has been previously described. We created additional\nscales for all years of follow-up with identical methods.\nCharacteristics of these scales are shown in Table 1. Means\nfor the seven years of follow-up range from just over 20, to\nalmost 42, out of a possible maximum of 150. Cronbach's\nProxies provided some reports of disability; hence, the\nsample sizes are larger for the disability measures than for\nthe religiousness measures. The 1994 disability measures\nhave the largest number of proxies reporting (13.5%).\nOther variables. -- All other variables in the analysis are\nscored as in the preceding article. We have included in Table\n1 descriptive statistics for the later measures of religious in-\nThe items in those years were identical to those in 1982.\nAnalysis\nAs in the preceding article, all multivariate regression anal-\nyses were performed with SUDAAN to adjust for the com-\nplex, stratified, and clustered nature of the study design. First,\nreligious involvement, disability, the set of health status co-\nvariates, and demographic factors from the 1982 survey. We\nthen examined the alternative causal process by regressing the\nfollow-up religion measures on the same set of independent\nvariables. Returning to the analysis of follow-up disability as\nthe dependent variable, we tested a series of interactions be-\ntween attendance and a number of important characteristics,\nincluding sex, age, denomination and, particularly, baseline\ndisability. Then we asked if any of the behavioral or psy-\nchosocial correlates of religious involvement in 1982 might\nhelp explain any of its effect on disability. As a final step, we\nexamined post-baseline change in disability by introducing\nlater measures of disability as covariates. All coefficients re-\nported in Tables 2 to 6 are unstandardized; they can be inter-\npreted directly as units of change in the dependent variable at-\ntributable to one unit of change in the independent variable.\nRESULTS\nTable 1 shows that mean functioning levels decline over\nthe period; the average score more than doubles. Indeed,\nthere is a linear increase in scores from one year to the next.\nThis finding is in agreement with other longitudinal studies\nof functioning (Maddox and Clark, 1992; Strawbridge et\nal., 1992). The standard deviations in Table 1, however, re-\nflect a great deal of individual variation in scores in the\nsample, and these increase over time.\nTable 1 also shows the bivariate relationships between\ndisability values for each of the years of the study, and\nthe baseline measures of religious involvement.\nAttendance at services in 1982 is consistently and nega-\ntively associated with disability over the follow-up pe-\nriod; subjective religiousness has no significant associa-\ntion. The association with attendance declines over the\nperiod as the measures become more distant from each\nother; nevertheless, attendance in 1982 is still signifi-\ncantly correlated with lower levels of disability 12 years\nlater.\nThe table also shows that 1982 attendance and subjec-\ntive religiousness are well correlated with the later mea-\nsures of the same concepts. The bivariate correlations of\n.43 to .60 for the measure of attendance at services, and\n.61 to .63 for the measure of subjective religiousness, sug-\ngest moderate stability in religious practices and beliefs.\nDespite the attrition in the sample due to mortality, and the\npreviously noted increasing levels of disability among sur-\nvivors, 40 percent of the sample report attending services\nthis figure drops only to 38 percent in 1994. It is interest-\ning that the decline in functioning in the sample is steeper\nthan the decline in attendance, suggesting that in older age\na particular level of disability may diminish somewhat as a\nbarrier to attendance.\nTable 1.

(Hypothesis 1)\nOur analysis in Table 2 takes each annual measure of dis-\nability as its dependent variable. Disability in 1982 is in-\ncluded in each model to partial out the level of functioning\nat the start of the study; it is highly correlated with disabil-\nity levels in each of the following years. As Table 2 shows,\nattendance at religious services is strongly associated with\nchanges in disability that take place through the follow-up\nperiod. The associations are statistically significant through\n1988, and although the size of the coefficient does not\nchange much by 1994 (in fact, it is just about the average\nfor the preceding years), the coefficient no longer reaches\nstatistical significance. Note that until 1988, the association\nactually appears to grow in strength as the follow-up period\nlengthens. Subjective religiousness, on the other hand, is\nnot significantly related to disability levels in any year, and\nthe coefficients vary a good deal. The affiliation categories\nalso were tested in these models, with Roman Catholics the\nreference category; as in the attrition analyses, no signifi-\ncant effects were found (in any year), and these models are\npresented without them.\nWith respect to the other variables, many of the health\nstatus measures are associated with change in disability; the\nmodels, which originally included all health status measures\nin Table 1 of the preceding article, have been trimmed to in-\nclude just those that are significantly associated with disabil-\nity in one or more years of follow-up. Stroke victims (those\nwith remaining difficulties), diabetics (those on medication),\nrespondents reporting amputations of the leg, those report-\ning symptoms of congestive heart failure or angina, and\nthose with impaired cognitive function all have poorer func-\ntional ability during at least some period of the follow-up.\nprovements in functioning, an unusual association that has\nbeen noted in these data before (Idler and Kasl, 1992).\nThe demographic factors show expected associations.\nAge is related to increasing disability over the period, as is\nbeing female. In several of the follow-up years, higher lev-\nels of education are related to lower disability, as is being\nmarried. Neither race nor low income is related to disability\nin any year of follow-up.\nThe sizes of the regression coefficients for religious atten-\ndance and their associated significance levels do not diminish,\nbut vary somewhat without an obvious trend. The one excep-\ntion is the coefficient for 1994, which is no longer significant.\nOverall, in the full sample, we see a persistent relationship of\nreligious attendance, but not subjective religiousness, to better\nfunctioning that appears to last for at least 6 years.\nDoesfunctional disability affect attendance?

As Table 3\nshows, functional disability in 1982 is not related to change\nin attendance in any of the years, once baseline levels of at-\ntendance, other measures of health status, and sociodemo-\ngraphics are controlled. As the waves of data measuring re-\nligion were 3 years apart, we wondered if this was not too\nlong a period for an effect to be detected; we then added\nadditional measures of disability for the year just prior to\nthe religion measure, and here we do see effects. Disability\ndoes appear to have a strongly significant short-term nega-\ntive effect on attendance, but it is one that cannot be de-\ntected 3 years later. We would also note that the addition of\nthese post-baseline disability measures adds little or noth-\ning to the R2 for these models.\nWith respect to the other variables in the model, by far the\nlargest effects are from previous levels of attendance, as one\nwould anticipate from the high correlations between waves\nin Table 1. Subjective religiousness also has strong effects\nthroughout the follow-up period. The few other variables\nthat have an effect are: an inexplicable positive effect of\nnon-leg amputations; a negative effect of age (note that this\nis independent of disability); race (Whites are less likely\nthan Blacks to be attending by the end of the period); and\neducation (a consistently positive effect). Overall, it appears\nthat later attendance patterns in the sample are primarily ex-\nplained by previous attendance patterns and subjective reli-\ngiousness and only fleetingly by changes in disability.\nWe also conducted a longitudinal analysis of change in\nsubjective religiousness (not shown). The results were simi-\nlar to Table 3, in that both attendance and subjective feelings\nwere the strongest predictors of later feelings, but they were\ndissimilar in that 1982 disability had small but significant\neffects on higher levels of religious feeling in 1988 and\n1994. Interim measures of disability had no effect. Together,\nthese results underscore the differences between attendance\nand subjective religiousness, but they provide little or no\nsupport for the reverse causal model. We conclude that,\nwhile the effect of new disability on declining attendance is\ndetectable, it is overshadowed by the consistency, size, and\nsignificance of the evidence in the other direction.\nIs the effect of attendance on disability a general one in the\npopulation studied or is it limited to certain subgroups?\n(Hypothesis 3)\nTo evaluate the possibility that the effects may be concen-\ntrated in a particular subgroup, we tested models with interac-\nStroke + difficulties'\"\nStroke only\"\nDiabetes + medications'\nDiabetes onlyc\nBroken bones\nAmputation of legd\nOther amputation1*\nNumber Rx meds\nCongestive heart failure\nAngina\nCognitive function\nAge\nWhite\nLow income\nMarried\nEducation\nSex (male)\nIntercept\nMultiple R2\nN\nAttendance\nAttendance\nAttendance\nAttendance\n_ QJ***\nAttendance\nAttendance\n\"Ordinary least squares regression models with standard errors adjusted for complex sample design, unstandardized coefficients.\nbCompared to reference category of No stroke.\n'Compared to reference category of No diabetes\n\"Compared to reference category of No amputation.\n\"Compared to reference category of Minor or no cognitive impairment.\ntion effects for attendance by sex, affiliation (White\nProtestants vs all others), age (continuous), and baseline dis-\nability (continuous). We also tested main effect models in the\nsubset of the sample who survived to 1988. Our tests showed\nno significant effects for interactions of attendance with sex,\naffiliation, or age, but they did show associations that were\nsignificant or borderline significant for 4 of the 7 years of fol-\nlow-up for the disability interaction. In Table 4 we illustrate\nthese findings with a stratified analysis for three equal-sized\ndisability groups. The first group, with disability scores of 0,\nshows effects in just 2 years; these effects must represent pre-\nvention of decline for attenders, because their condition could\nnot improve. The group with moderate disability (scores of 1\nto 21) shows effects in 4 of 7 years, and a notably strong ef-\nfect for 1994. The most disabled group (with scores of 22 to\n150) has the largest coefficients and strongest significance\nlevels of the three groups. The results provide support for\nHypothesis 3, that the effects of attendance on subsequent dis-\nability will be greater for those with some existing disability,\nalthough the effects are not absent in any group.\nTable 4 also shows the subgroup of 1988 survivors. They\necho the bivariate findings we presented in the attrition\nanalyses. Although just over half of the sample survives to\n1988, we see a persistent effect among this subset of the\nsample, with relatively large coefficients.\nDo any of the behavioral or psychosocial factors associ-\nated with religiousness explain its effect on disability?\nTable 5 tests Hypotheses 4, 5, and 6. In an intermediate\nstep, we tested each of the health practice, social activities,\nand well-being measures that were significantly associated\nwith either of the religion measures in Tables 2, 3, and 4\n(preceding article), one by one as independent variables in\nthe full models. Our reasoning was that only variables that\nwere associated with religiousness at Time 1 could serve as\nexplanatory variables. Of course, this criterion did not\nshrink our pool of candidate mediating variables by very\nmuch; only self-rated health and negative affect were\nclearly not associated with either indicator of religiousness.\nWe found that physical activities, leisure activities, close\nfriends, friend contact, close kin, kin contact, interpersonal\ndistress, and optimism were all associated with disability in\nthe longitudinal models. Because we wanted to combine\nthese factors to test the hypotheses, and because the two\npairs of social contact/closeness variables were highly cor-\nrelated with each other, we chose to use only the friend and\nkin closeness measures, rather than the contact measures,\nwhich had had weaker effects.\nThe three hypotheses are tested separately and then in a\ncombined model. The results are abridged to show just the\ncoefficients for religiousness and the candidate mediating\nvariables; they can be compared directly to the first two\nlines of Table 2 (this article). The test of the health practices\nhypothesis contains only the measure of physical activity,\nas alcohol use, obesity, and smoking were not related to\nfollow-up disability. Physical activity has lasting effects\nthat remain strong throughout the period, even until 1994. It\nalso consistently reduces the size of the coefficients for reli-\ngious attendance, but by minimal amounts, usually less\nAttendance\nSubjective religiousness\nMultiple R2\nN\nModerate Disability\nAttendance\nSubjective religiousness\nMultiple R2\nN\nSevere Disability\nAttendance\nSubjective religiousness\nMultiple R2\nN\nAttendance\nSubjective religiousness\nMultiple R2\nN\nDisability\nDisability\nDisability\n--\nDisability0\nDisability0\nDisability\nDisability\n\"Ordinary least squares regression models with standard errors adjusted for complex sample design, unstandardized coefficients.\n\"All models also include: 1982 disability (except within first panel) to covary within category, stroke, diabetes, broken bones, amputation, age, Rx, con-\ngestive heart failure, angina, cognitive function, White, low income, marital status, education, sex.\ncFull sample models for these years showed Attendance X Disability interaction terms significant at p =.01 and p = .002.

Thus, a modest amount of the variance in\ndisability initially explained by attendance at religious ser-\nvices is due to the higher levels of physical activity of fre-\nquent attenders, providing some support for Hypothesis 4.\nCertainly physical activity is a strong predictor of better\nfunctioning over the long run.\nClose friends and kin, and leisure activities, in combina-\ntion, provide a test of Hypothesis 5. Leisure social activities\nin 1982 are a strong predictor of functioning during the pe-\nriod, and number of close kin is to a lesser extent. Number\nof close friends has no main effect. Activities and kin re-\nduce the size of the attendance coefficients somewhat, by as\nsignificance. Thus, we can say that the better functional\nability of the more religious respondents is to some extent\ndue to their higher levels of activity overall, and their larger\nand closer family, but not friendship, networks. Never-\ntheless, a significant effect of religiousness remains, even\nafter social activities have been considered.\nHypothesis 6 is that better well-being among the\nreligiously-active will partly explain their better function-\ning. Optimism and the CES-D scale were the only two\nwell-being indicators that were associated with religious-\nness, and also predicted change in functioning. When intro-\nduced together, only optimism is significantly associated\nwith later functioning, in both the short-term and the long-\ncoefficients for religious attendance very little. While opti-\nmism is clearly a predictor of better functioning, it does lit-\ntle to help explain the effect of religiousness.\nAs a final step, we introduced all the mediating variables\nthat had been significant in the three hypothesis-testing\nmodels, to see if together they would eliminate the effect of\nreligiousness. These results are shown in the bottom panel.\nCoefficients for religiousness are reduced in all years, and\neffects become nonsignificant in two years, marginal in an-\nother one. However, some robust effects remain through\n1988. Thus, while we successfully identify some of the\nmechanisms of attendance at worship services, the higher\nassociated levels of physical and leisure activities, close\nkin, and optimism do not eliminate the effect of religious\nattendance on disability.\nDo the effects persist even after adjusting for post-baseline\nchanges in functioning?\nFinally, we were interested in the persistence of the ef-\nfects of attendance in a different way from that seen in\nTable 2. Specifically, we wondered whether introducing\npost-baseline measures of disability would eliminate the ef-\nfect of attendance on disability in the years following. Table\n6 shows all possible combinations of intermediate measures\nand later follow-ups. Again, these coefficients are abridged\nfrom the complete models, given in Table 2. The first panel\nshows results for all later years when 1983 disability re-\nplaces 1982 disability in the model. The significant, even\nlarger, coefficients for attendance tell us that 1982 reli-\ngiousness continues to have an effect on changes in disabil-\ndisability are themselves influenced by baseline attendance,\nand yet our analysis controls for this influence. The second,\nthird, fourth, and fifth panels tell us that the effect persists\nwhen we move the starting time for change, even to change\nnot persist into 1994, although again the size of the coeffi-\ncients does not decline much. These very consistent find-\nings were something of a surprise. Our interpretation rests\non the fact that religious attendance is relatively stable over\nthe period, especially through 1988, as we saw in Table 1.\nThe sample size shrinks every year due to mortality, aver-\nage disability levels of the survivors increase, and yet a vir-\ntually constant proportion are attending services once a\nweek. It appears as if religious attendance has defined a tra-\njectory that is consistent when viewed from many windows.\nDISCUSSION\nCould Social Selection Explain These Findings?\nMany of the studies in the field of religion, health, and\naging that find better health associated with religious practices\nhave been open to the interpretation that elderly people who\nhave fewer disabilities and better health are simply able to\ncontinue attending services or, in other words, that selection,\nand not causation, is responsible for the association. As we\nnoted in the beginning of the first article, we intended to make\nan argument that religious involvement precedes changes in\nhealth and functioning and that this is compatible with a\ncausal interpretation of the role of religious involvement.\nThe primary finding of the study is that attendance at re-\nligious services has long-term effects on functioning that\npersist strongly through 1988 and are reduced in signifi-\ncance, if not size, by 1994. The models in Table 2 contain\nthe baseline level of the respondent's functioning, sociode-\nmographic characteristics known to be associated with\nchange in functioning, and a quite extensive set of health\nstatus covariates which might be expected to cause deterio-\nrating function in the future. Thus, these are causal models\nthat consider numerous possible confounders, and this is\none argument against the possibility that it is selection, and\nnot causation, at work. Our longitudinal models take not\nonly current levels of disability into account, but also the\nexistence of conditions and symptoms, as well as the more\nor less advantaged social locations of respondents.\nA second argument in favor of causation is that we tested\nthe selection scenario straight-on, and found small, short-\nterm effects only. New disability that was measured at the\nimmediately prior round of interviews (one year prior), and\nreflected change since the baseline, did have a negative ef-\nfect on later attendance at services, but 1982 disability had\nno effect on any attendance measure, including 1983 atten-\ndance. One might argue that the effects we did see would\nhave been stronger if we had had measures for disability\nthat came even closer to the measurement of attendance,\nbut this is at most an argument for short-term selection, and\nthe long-term picture in Table 3 is clear.\nThe third finding underscoring the causal interpretation\nwas presented in Table 6, which showed that, even when in-\ntermediate changes are removed from the model, atten-\ndance continues to predict later changes. The focus on the\nTable 6.

Overall, our results suggest that they explain\nsome but not all of the effect. The combination of activities,\nclose family relationships, and optimism does reduce the ef-\nfect of religious attendance in the short term. We might say\nthat the effects of religious attendance in the early follow-up\nperiod are largely due to the greater optimism and higher\nlevels of leisure activities of the religious attenders.\nHowever, even when these factors are included in the mod-\nels, a significant effect of religious attendance reappears in\n1985, after which the effects of leisure activities and opti-\nmism are marginal at most. Physical activity, and to a lesser\nextent, family closeness, remain predictors of disability\nthroughout the follow-up, but the effects of attendance per-\nsist as well until 1988, so we cannot entirely attribute the ef-\nfect of religious activities to physical activity or family ties,\neither. Our conclusion is that attendance at religious services\nplays an independent role in predicting the course of disabil-\nity that is not accounted for by prior disability or health sta-\ntus, or by the differing participation rates of various demo-\ngraphic or religious groups, or by better health practices, or\nby the substantial group of psychosocial factors with which\nreligious involvement is clearly associated.\nLimitations\nThis study has the strengths and the weaknesses of an\nanalysis of a large, regional longitudinal data set. It al-\nlows us to establish time order, to measure health status\nand disability with considerable detail, and to generalize\nto the population of the area from which it comes.\nHowever, it has a number of limitations related to sam-\npling, measurement, and analysis. First, it has rather few\nindicators of religious involvement, and for this analysis\nwe have primarily relied on a single item indicator of a\nsingle construct, the organizational aspects of religious-\nness. Moreover, it relies on data from a single commu-\nnity, a small metropolitan area in the northeastern United\nStates, whose respondents are diverse with respect to\nRoman Catholics, Jews, and African Americans, but\nwhich had few elderly Hispanic or Asian Americans. A\nthird limitation is the age restriction: All respondents\nwhose lifelong religious experiences stretch back into an\nearlier era. These findings provide us with little basis for\ngeneralizing to more recent cohorts or other parts of the\ncountry, or for speculating about other dimensions of reli-\ngious experience which might play a role. Finally, we\nhave taken a relatively simple approach to modeling;\nmore sophisticated approaches such as reciprocal effects\nmodeling or structural equation modeling could perhaps\nmore fully exploit these longitudinal data.\nConclusions\nReligion is a very important aspect of many elderly peo-\nple's lives, although it is often ignored in gerontological re-\nsearch. National data show that elderly people are highly\nlikely to say religion is \"very important\" in their life (76%),\ncompared with just 44 percent of those under 30 (Princeton\nReligion Research Center, 1994). Our findings from the\nfirst article showed that, particularly for disabled respon-\ndents, religious attendance appeared to be a kind of lynch-\npin that connected observant respondents to other networks\nof friends and relatives, to holiday celebrations, and to\nother social and cultural activities. It is not a scarce re-\nsource, but a widely available one in this community, and it\nis all the more important because it appears to make other\nresources available.\nOur focus on religion in the lives of disabled elderly per-\nsons has been a fortuitous one in several respects. Two-\nthirds of the sample reported some amount of difficulty\nwith at least one disability item, so the disabled represent a\nmajority of the sample. In the first article, we saw that reli-\ngious attendance made a special difference for this group in\nterms of social activities and well-being. And in this article\nwe saw somewhat stronger prospective effects of religious\nattendance on disability for the already-disabled. The latter\nfinding strengthens the causal interpretation of the data, and\nthe first article directs our attention in certain ways as we\nthink about the mechanisms of causation. Future work in\nthis field might profitably focus on the meaning of religious\ninvolvement for disabled elderly persons, particularly the\nmanifold dimensions of the experience of attendance at re-\nligious services. Worshipping together with the religious\ncongregation may offer the disabled elderly person a route,\nthrough prayer, or receiving the sacraments, or appreciation\nof the beauty of the place, to a transcendent state in which\nthe body and its frailties don't matter that much. The moti-\nvation to return to this state, and to the accompanying so-\ncial support and pleasant pastimes that religious groups\nprovide, may be a strong factor influencing the recovery of\nelderly people with new disabilities. In any event, our find-\nings tell us that future work in this field should not neglect\nthe role of traditional, organizational religion in favor of\nnonorganizational or subjective dimensions of religion.\nWe began our two articles with a question about how the\nlives of religious and nonreligious elderly people differed.\nWe found in the first report that they differed with respect\nto almost everything we looked at, including physical activ-\nity, smoking, alcohol use, friendship and family ties, social\nactivities and holiday celebrations, depression, and opti-\nmism. In every instance those who attended services more\nalso did better in these other areas. Now we can add that at-\ntendance at services presages better disability outcomes as\nwell, partly because of these corollary benefits, but also be-\ncause of something which is apparently unique to the\nexperience of attendance at religious services. Religious in-\nvolvement appears to invigorate everyday life in the pres-\nent, and to be a source of help for troubles in the future.\nThe abundance of this resource in American communities,\nits overwhelming importance to the majority of current co-\nhorts of elderly persons in the U.S., and its apparent effects\non a fundamental measure of functioning in daily life\nshould make it incumbent upon gerontologists to turn their\nattention to this often-overlooked aspect of the lives of el-\nderly people.\n"
