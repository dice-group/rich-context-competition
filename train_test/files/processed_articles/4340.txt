    "abstract": "Abstract\nTwo studies compared perceptions of status for occupations based on the gender and race of the workers. In total, 387\ncollege students participated in this research. Across studies, results indicated that participants did not differentially value\noccupations based on the gender or race of the workers in terms of prestige ratings or salary estimates. However, participants\njudged that occupations required more education when described as having predominantly male workers rather than female\nworkers. In addition, the participants showed different levels of interest in the positions depending on the occupational\ngender. These results are compared with similar studies conducted 20 years ago, in which participants showed more overt\nforms of devaluing occupations associated with women.\n",

Early research in this area\ncentered on how written work produced by women was val-\nued less than the same work produced by men (e.g., Goldberg,\nhighly competent women (Lott, 1985). Studies published in\nwere more likely to be positively evaluated than female can-\ndidates (Bronstein, Black, Pfennig, &White, 1986; Heneman,\nreotypes affected the evaluation of male and female supervi-\nPublic opinions regarding work and gender have become\nmore egalitarian since the 1980s, but perceptions of work are\nnot yet gender neutral.

Results indicated that\nalthough 54% reported no preference with respect to the gen-\nder of their boss, of those who expressed a preference,\napproximately 67% were in favor of male supervisors. Thus,\nthe majority explicitly reported no bias with respect to the\ngender of a manager, yet approximately 31% of the sample\nstill preferred to work for a male.\nIn addition to looking at the perceived value of work, com-\npetence of candidates, or supervisory preferences, an exami-\nnation of salaries has been used to study the perceived worth\nof women's work compared with men's. The long-standing\ngender gap in pay in the United States indicates the higher\nstatus accorded men's work (Gibelman, 2003). Across educa-\ntional levels and occupations in the United States, women earn\nless than men (U.S. Census, 2011). For example, aggregated\nacross occupation, education, and race, the mean full-time,\nyear-round income for males 25 years of age or older in 2011\nwas US$67,398, and the comparable mean for women was\ndegree or higher, the mean full-time, year-round income for\nThe data 20 years ago conveyed a similar, but more\nextreme, story: The mean full-time, year-round income for\nlor's degree or higher in 1991, the mean for males was\nCensus, 2011) There are, of course, various reasons for the\ngender differential, including factors such as work history.\nHowever, in 1984, Shepela and Viviano wrote that at least\npart of such a salary differential is due to a sexist perception\nof differences in competence when men's and women's work\nis judged. \"Women are paid less because they are in women's\njobs, and women's jobs are paid less because they are done\nargued that women's labor is not valued less because of the\nnature of the work itself; it is valued less precisely because\nwomen are doing it.\n1Ramapo College of New Jersey, Mahwah, NJ, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nDonna Crawley, Ramapo College of New Jersey, 505 Ramapo Valley\nEmail: dcrawley@ramapo.edu\nGender and Perceptions of Occupational\nPrestige: Changes Over 20 Years\nDonna Crawley1\n Keywords\noccupations, occupational status, prestige, gender, sex roles\n2 SAGE Open\nConsistent with this argument, Lips (2013) has presented\ncompelling analyses indicating that the human capital model\nof occupational status is inadequate to completely explain\nthe gender pay gap. Examinations of investments in work,\ndefined by variables such as work history, education, years\nof experience, and various occupational behaviors, are insuf-\nficient in explaining the salary gaps by gender. Furthermore,\nmany of these variables are influenced by gendered social\nnorms and pressures. Social stereotypes, overt gender dis-\ncrimination, the gendered nature of the workplace, and the\ngendered nature of networks are all factors that contribute to\na continuing gender difference in occupational achievement\nreotypes about women and men that play a role in how male\nand female work is perceived (cf. Williams, Paluck, &\nWhile narrower than 20 years ago, the pay gap and thus\nsome status gap still exist today. When taken together, the\nresearch related to women in the workplace presents a pic-\nture of social progress for women, albeit without equality.\n(2009) presented evidence that although there is greater gen-\nder equality in socioeconomic and occupational status, there\nhas also been a slowing down, if not a stall, in the progress of\nwomen in achieving socioeconomic parity with men.\nIf it is true that occupations associated with women are\nperceived as lower in status precisely because the workers\nare women, then several expectations would be logical. First,\ngender neutral occupations, those without pre-existing gen-\nder stereotypes, should be perceived as having less social\nstatus if the workers are predominantly female. Furthermore,\ntraditionally male occupations should become less \"valu-\nable\" when women enter the field in large numbers. Finally,\nmen should show low interest in entering traditionally female\noccupations, but women should show an interest in crossing\noccupational gender boundaries.\nInterestingly, this appears to have occurred in the field of\npsychology. Fewer than 30% of PhD degrees in psychology\nchology, women earn less than their male colleagues,\ning to a 2009 study of doctoral-level salaries in psychology\nby years in the field, men earned more at every level of expe-\nrience. However, the difference was most notable for those\nwho had worked in the field for 20 years or more. In that\ncohort, women earned an average of 18% less than their male\ncounterparts. The gender differential for those with fewer\nthan 5 years of experience was smaller, with women earning\nan average of 6% less than men (Center for Workforce\nOver the years, this salary difference has elicited concerns\nabout the \"feminization of psychology\" as more women have\nentered the field (Cynkar, 2007; Ostertag & McNamara,\noften seems to be related to a loss in prestige for that field and\nan accompanying lowering of salaries, the possible \"decline\nof the field\" of psychology was discussed 21 years ago at\nthe 1991 American Psychological Association (APA) confer-\nence in San Francisco and was addressed by a 1995 APATask\nForce (Cynkar, 2007). According to Dorothy Cantor, chair of\nthat Task Force, as salaries in psychology declined in the\n1980s due to a variety of economic factors, men left the field\nand women filled in the gaps (Cynkar, 2007). Thus, lowered\nsalaries led to men leaving the field and opened the door to\nwomen, and in turn as women entered the field, the status and\nsalaries were lowered further. (For analyses of the gender gap\nin pay within other academic fields, see Travis, Gross, &\nThere have been varied experimental findings in psychol-\nogy about differences in occupational prestige as a function\nof the gender of the workers. For example, in 1974 Touhey\n(1974) demonstrated that traditionally masculine occupa-\ntions (lawyer, professor, scientist, architect, and physician)\ntended to decrease in perceived prestige when it was expected\nthat women would be entering that profession in greater\nnumbers. Similarly, Liben, Bigler, and Krogh (2001) found\nthat children rated a novel job presented with male workers\nas more prestigious than the same job when presented with\nfemale workers. Vervecken, Hannover, and Wolter (2013)\ndemonstrated that children's perceptions of occupations, and\ntheir interest in the occupations, are impacted significantly\nby the forms of gendered language used to describe the occu-\npation. When an occupation is described only in masculine\nterms, girls are less likely to express interest, and both girls\nand boys expect less success by women in the field.\nIn the early 1990s, my students and I conducted two stud-\nies investigating perceptions of salary worth, along with rat-\nings of prestige, for an occupation based on the gender of the\nmajority of workers (Crawley & Poran, 1992). In one study,\ncollege student participants read an occupational description\nfor public relations, which had been pretested and rated as\ngender neutral (M = 5.30 on a 10-point scale with 1 as femi-\nnine and 10 as masculine, n = 20) and moderate in prestige\nThe description was constant across conditions except for a\nstatement about the gender of the majority of workers. Each\nof the participants was randomly assigned to read one of the\njob descriptions, and then rate on 10-point scales how presti-\ngious the occupation appeared to be and how much respect\nhe or she had for the occupation. Finally, the participant indi-\ncated what salary a worker who had been in the field for\n7 years was worth. Although there were no significant effects\nof worker gender on ratings of occupational prestige or\nrespect per se, the occupation was judged as worth US$5,880\nper year more in salary when the workers were men\nAsecond study with the same design used the occupation of\nmental health casework. We created this job description to be\nambiguous in terms of the educational level and status of the\nworkers, although we did not pretest the description. Again,\nthere were no significant effects of worker gender on ratings of\nprestige or respect, but the occupation was judged to be worth\nUS$5,230 more in yearly salary when the workers were pri-\nstudents seemed to believe that identical work was worth less,\nand should be paid less, when women did the work.\nOne possible critique of using estimated salary levels as a\ndependent measure in this type of research, however, is that\nparticipants may simply be aware of gender gaps in wages,\nand may reflect reality when they give different salary esti-\nmates for occupations (Furnham & Wilson, 2011). However,\nWilliams et al. (2010) investigated the expectation that men\nwill make more money than women, and argued that when\nparticipants allot a higher salary to men, the difference is not\nsolely a reflection of actual differences in salary within soci-\nety. They found significant differences in salary estimations\nfor male and female targets, and their results indicated that at\nleast part of the differential estimations was due to an implicit\nstereotype that links males and wealth.\nGendered Interest in Occupations\nAnother measure of perceptions of gendered work has been\ncareer interest in occupations. Across time periods, research\nhas shown that males and females, adolescent and adult,\nexpress more interest in gender-congruent occupations than\nin crossing gender boundaries (Church, Teresa, Rosebrook,\nRatnasingam, & Wheeler, 2012). Furthermore, in the views\nof both men and women, it is more acceptable for women to\ncross gendered occupational boundaries than men (DiDonato\nof expressed interest is more pronounced among individuals\nwho endorse traditional gender values for themselves; self-\nidentified gender \"atypical\" males and females are more\nAlthough societal gender roles in the workplace have become\nless rigid over time, gendered expectations persist and differ-\nences in occupational interest by gender are not likely to\nchange in the near future (Rudman & Phelan, 2010).\nRace and Occupational Status\nOccupational prestige is, of course, affected by demographic\nvariables other than gender. The literature on race and personal\noccupational status is vastly complex, with a multitude of fac-\ntors influencing occupational segregation, work status, and pay\ndifferentials (Alonso-Villar, Del Rio, & Gradin, 2012;\nMcDonald, Lin, & Ao, 2009). Gender, immigration status, lan-\nguage proficiency, cultural assimilation are but a few factors\nthat interact with race in affecting individuals' socioeconomic\nstatus and the prestige of racially segregated occupations. For\nexample, across occupations, significant differences in socio-\neconomic status exist by gender and race and the interaction of\nthe two, moderated by educational attainment in the United\nStates (Lemelle, 2002). In his analysis of occupational status\nfor Black, White, and Hispanic men and women, Lemelle\n(2002) found that economic status was higher for Whites than\nfor Blacks or Hispanics among people without college educa-\ntions, but the pattern was modified for those who had attended\ncollege. Also, although the socioeconomic index that Lemelle\nused was generally higher for males than for females among\nWhites, the reverse was true for Blacks and Hispanics, across\neducational levels. In addition, Kim and Tamborini (2006)\nfound different patterns of racial discrimination depending on\nthe labor market under scrutiny. Race was less of a predictor of\noccupational status within technical fields, although still pre-\ndictive for occupations based on social skills.\nClearly, data indicate that some racial minority groups,\nacross educational levels and occupations, have lower socio-\neconomic status than Whites in the United States, but the rela-\ntionship between race and occupational status is moderated by\nmany variables, including gender, education, and type of occu-\npation. Research has also found that while there are stereotypes\nabout the types of work-related abilities that various racial\ngroups have, and overall levels of expected competence\ntypes differ by gender as well. Therefore, once again, the rela-\ntionship between racial characteristics and occupational\nprestige is complex. While jobs with a high proportion of some\nminority groups may be judged as having lower status and have\nlower salaries, based on past research, it is not clear whether\n\"race neutral\" jobs would be judged as lower in status if\ndescribed as predominantly occupied by a given racial minority\ngroup than if described as predominantly White. Certainly,\ngender and the nature of the occupation should interact with\nrace in affecting perceptions of occupational prestige.\nHypotheses\nThe current studies were designed to replicate our research\non gender and occupational status now that 20 years have\npassed, using the same type of methodology, with students at\nthe same college. How much of a difference has 20 years\nmade in college student attitudes? Do students still perceive\nthat occupations are worth less when women constitute the\nmajority of the workers? The research design also includes\noccupational race as a variable to investigate the impact of\nthe race of workers on perceptions of occupations, either as\nmain effects or in interaction with gender.\nBased on the past research on gender, race, and occupa-\ntional status, along with evidence of changing gender norms\nand the narrowing of the gender pay gap, it is expected that\ndifferences in perceptions of occupations by occupational gen-\nder will not appear on overt measures of status, such as pres-\ntige ratings. However, occupational gender is expected to\naffect salary estimates, beliefs about educational requirements,\n4 SAGE Open\nand interest in the occupation. Also, occupational race should\ninteract with occupational gender in affecting perceptions of\noccupational prestige.\nHypothesis 1 (H1): There will be a significant main effect\nfor occupational gender on estimates of starting salaries.\nParticipants will give higher estimates of starting salary\nwhen the occupation is described as male-dominated.\nHypothesis 2 (H2): There will be a significant main\neffect for occupational gender on estimates of educational\nrequirements. Participants will estimate that the occupa-\ntion requires a higher educational achievement when the\noccupation is described as male-dominated.\nHypothesis 3 (H3): There will be a significant interaction\nbetween occupational gender and participant gender on\ninterest in the occupation. Male participants will prefer\ngender-congruent occupations, while female participants\nwill be less affected by occupational gender.\nHypothesis 4 (H4): There will be a significant interaction\nbetween occupational race and occupational gender for\nsalary estimates. Salary estimates will be higher for White\nmale occupations than White female conditions, but that\npattern will not be true for other racial groups.\nHypothesis 5 (H5): There will be a significant interaction\nbetween occupational race and occupational gender for\nestimates of educational requirements. Higher educa-\ntional requirement will be estimated for White male occu-\npations than White female occupations, but that will not\nbe true for other racial groups.\nMethod\nParticipants. A sample of 267 college students, 63 males and\nof whom identified themselves as White participated in this\nresearch. These students attended a public liberal arts college\nin the northeastern United States, the same college at which\nthe comparable research was done 20 years ago (Crawley &\nPoran, 1992). The majority of incoming students at this col-\nlege (56.6%) identify themselves as \"middle of the road\"\npolitically, with 25.3 identifying as liberal and 18.1% con-\nservative (Institutional Research, 2012). Education and intel-\nligence have been found to be negatively correlated with\nacceptance of traditional gender roles (Judge & Livingston,\n2008). Thus, this college sample is likely to endorse rela-\ntively liberal views regarding gender.\nMaterials and procedure.We created a questionnaire that\nincluded a job description for an Abstract Checker, a position\nin the insurance industry. We used the occupation of Abstract\nChecker, a real--but little known--job title because it was\nnot commonly recognized, and had no immediate gender ste-\nreotype when tested on a separate college sample (M = 5.30\non a 10-point scale from Very Feminine to Very Masculine,\nn = 30). With respect to occupational race, the majority of the\ntest sample indicated that they expected the job to either have\nthe same ratio of African Americans, Latinos, Asians, and\nWhites as in the general population (46.67%) or more Whites\n(40.00%). The job description also tested as moderate in\nThe description included job responsibilities along with\nsome information on the demographics of the people work-\ning in the field. A manipulation check was done on a college\nsample of 20 to test comprehension and memory for the\ndemographic information. Results indicated that 90% of par-\nticipants correctly recalled the dominant racial group, and\n75% reported the gender correctly. See Appendix A for a\ncopy of the job description.\nAfter reading the job description, participants indicated\ntheir perceptions of occupational worth by completing a\nseries of dependent measures. Respondents gave estimates of\nthe education needed to work in the field by checking off one\nof seven choices ranging from \"No Educational Requirement\"\nto \"Post-Doctoral Work.\" Participants also estimated the\nprobable starting salary by naming a figure between\nfield on a 10-point scale, from \"No Interest At All\" to \"Very\nHighDegreeofInterest,\"andcompleteda22-itemPerceptions\nof Occupational Status Survey (POSS). This survey measures\noverall occupational status as a single dimension and has\nbeen shown to have both convergent validity and internal reli-\nability. Overall scores on the POSS significantly differenti-\nated between occupations that have been ranked differently in\nother research (Goyder, 2005), such as \"cashier\" and \"veteri-\nnarian.\" Cronbach's alpha for the scale ranged from .80 to .92\nacross five samples and three different occupations (Crawley\n& Cardinale, 2008; see Appendix B for a copy of the POSS.)\nThe demographic information on the fictitious job\ndescription was manipulated to create six versions in a 2\n(gender of the majority of workers) \u00d7 3 (race of the majority\nof workers) design. Although the main focus of the research\nwas on gender, we examined the impact of three racial group-\nings on the descriptions as well: African American and\nLatino; White; and Asian. We solicited participants from\nundergraduate classes and via a subject pool at the college.\nEach participant was randomly assigned to read one version\nof the questionnaire and completed the form individually. At\nthe top of the questionnaire, a consent statement appeared,\nand after completing the survey, each participant was fully\ndebriefed. The surveys took approximately 5 to 10 min to\ncomplete; all data were kept completely anonymous.\nResults\nANOVA and chi-squared analyses were done on completed\nsurveys. Due to missing data on some items, the sample size\nfor each analysis was slightly different. Results indicated\nthat there were no effects of occupational gender or race on\noverall prestige as measured by mean scores on the POSS\naction. Similarly, there were no significant effects of occupa-\ning salary estimate for Abstract Checker when the workers\nwere predominantly males was US$40,260, and the mean for\nthe predominantly female version was US$39, 236. See\nTable 1 for data on salary and POSS scores and the correla-\ntions between the dependent measures.\nThere were no main effects of occupational gender or race\non estimates of required level of education; however, the pat-\ntern of results by occupational gender was different for the\nWhite worker condition than for the other occupational race\nconditions. The responses regarding educational level were\nanalyzed as nominal data. Responses regarding educational\nlevel were put into two categories for analysis--Less than a\nBachelor's Degree or Bachelor's Degree and Above. As\nshown in Figure 1, for the White occupational gender condi-\ntion, participants more frequently chose Bachelor's Degree\nor a higher degree when the workers were predominantly\nmale than when they were mostly female, 2(1, N = 110) =\noccupational gender condition, 39 (61%) estimated that at\nleast a Bachelor's Degree was required. For the female occu-\njudgment. There were no significant differences by occupa-\ntional gender when the workers were described as predomi-\nnantly African American and Latino or Asian.\nFinally, there were no significant patterns related to inter-\nest in the occupation by occupational gender or participant\ngender, nor did participant gender affect any of the other\ndependent variables.\nConclusion. These results indicate that there were no differences\nin perceptions of prestige based on occupational gender or race.\nSimilarly, there were no effects of occupational gender or race\non salary ratings, in contrast to the findings on gender reported\nin 1992; neither H1 nor H4 were supported in this sample. How-\never, the degree of education thought to be required for this\noccupation was directly affected by the gender of the workers\nwhen the workers were described as White. No significant pat-\nterns for educational requirement by gender appeared for the\nother racial conditions for this occupation. Thus, there was an\ninteractive effect between occupational gender and race with\nrespect to educational estimates, supporting H5.\nIn an attempt to replicate these findings with another\noccupation, we conducted Study 2. In this case, we created a\njob title (Point of Sales Systems Coordinator) and a job\ndescription in the retail sales industry that do not actually\nexist. This occupation was created to be ambiguous in status\nand gender neutral, as verified during pretesting. The overall\ndesign for this replication was also simplified into a 2 \u00d7 2\ndesign; we reduced the number of worker racial groups to\ntwo--White or African American and Latino.\nMethod\nParticipants. A sample of 120 college students participated. The\nsample included 30 males and 79 females, with 11 respondents\nnot indicating gender; 63% identified themselves as White.\nTable 1.

Each participant read one of four ver-\nsions of a job description for a Point of Sales Systems Coordi-\nnator, an occupation fabricated for this 2 \u00d7 2 design. The basic\noccupational job description was rated as gender neutral\nin prestige (M = 3.67 on a 10-point scale). The majority of the\ntest sample (56.67%) expected the same racial mix as in the\ngeneral population, although 26.67% expected more White\nworkers and 13.33% expected more Latinos. Each version of\nthe description had the same duties listed, but was manipu-\nlated in terms of the percentage of women and men who\nworked in the field, and in terms of the dominant racial group\nworking in the field. The occupation was described as having\nworkers who were predominantly male or female, and pre-\ndominantly White, or African American and Latino.\nAfter reading the job description, participants completed\na series of dependent measures, including estimations of the\neducation needed to work in the field by checking off one of\nseven educational categories, as in Study 1. Participants also\nestimated starting salary in an open-ended item and com-\npleted the POSS. Finally, respondents rated their possible\ninterest in the field.\nResults\nTen participants did not complete the POSS, thus the sample\nsize for the prestige analysis was 110. These 10 participants\nwere among the 11 not indicating gender. Similar to the\nresults of Study 1, data analyses performed on completed sur-\nvey items indicated no main effects of occupational gender or\nrace on the occupational prestige (POSS) scores ( = .91),\np = .20 for race. With respect to salary estimates, data from\nthree participants were discarded as their salary estimates on\nthis open-ended item were more than three standard devia-\ntions above the mean, and thus were considered outliers; one\nother respondent did not respond to the item. Based on the\nremaining sample of 116, there were no main effects for occu-\nthe predominantly male occupation was US$37,166, whereas\nthe mean for the female worker condition was US$34,707.\nThere were no significant interactions for the prestige scores,\np = .08. See Table 2 for data on salary and POSS scores and\nthe correlations between the dependent measures.\nThe estimated level of education required for the occupa-\ntion, however, was significantly affected by occupational\ngender. Educational estimate was analyzed as a nominal\nvariable, condensing the responses into two categories--\nLess than a Bachelor's Degree or Bachelor's Degree and\nAbove. Chi-squared analyses indicated that participants were\nmore likely to indicate that at least a Bachelor's Degree was\nneeded if the occupation was done primarily by male than by\nregardless of occupational race, as illustrated in Figure 2. Of\nthe 60 participants in the male occupational gender condi-\ntion, 34 (57%) estimated that at least a Bachelor's Degree\nwas required. For the female occupational gender condition,\nFinally, there was no overall difference in interest in the\np = .55, but there was a significant difference between male\nThere was also a significant interaction between occupational\n.05. Female participants were mildly interested in the occupa-\ntion, regardless of worker gender (M = 3.05 with male workers\nand M = 3.64 with female workers), whereas male participants\nwere significantly more interested in the occupation if most of\nthe workers were male (M = 5.19 with male workers and M =\n3.33 with female workers), as shown in Figure 3.\nConclusion\nParticipants did not report different perceptions of prestige or\nsalary for the fictitious occupation of Point of Sales System\nCoordinator based on the gender or race of the workers.\nSimilar to Study 1, there was no overt sexism or racism\nexhibited in how the occupation's prestige was rated, nor\nwere there differences in salary estimates. Once again, H1\nand H4 were not supported. However, as with Study 1, a\nsubtle effect was found in that the participants perceived that\nthe occupation required a higher educational level when it\nwas a male-dominated field, in this case regardless of the\nracial composition of the workers, as predicted in H2. In\naddition, male and female participants showed a different\nlevel of interest in the occupation depending on the gender\ncongruence of workers in support of H3.\nDiscussion\nThere are several consistent findings across the two studies\ndescribed above. First, it appears that there was no overt dis-\ncrimination in terms of ratings of prestige or difference in\nsalary estimates based on the race or gender of the workers in\nany of the occupations. Although differences regarding sal-\nary were found with nearly identical methodologies at the\nsame college in the early 1990s, such differences among\ncollege students were not apparent in this cohort; see Table 3\nfor the comparisons across time and occupations. The only\nconsistent area in which participants exhibited different per-\nceptions of an occupation based on gender was in judgments\nof the educational requirements.\nWhen a field was described as predominantly done by\nmen, most notably White men, respondents assumed that a\nhigher level of education was needed to be hired. Interestingly,\nit is not the case that participants simply reflected the existing\ndemographic differences in educational achievement in their\nestimates. The participants were from a state college, and\ntheir estimates do not match the actual statistical data on edu-\ncational achievements by race and gender for the state. Nor\ndo the estimates reflect the gender ratios at the college in\nwhich these studies were conducted. Participants did not look\nat the students around them at the college, see which gender\nwas more likely to be earning a bachelor's or master's degree,\nand make estimates about educational hiring requirements\naccordingly. In fact, the majority of students (57.4%) earning\nbachelor's and master's degrees at the college are female\n(Ramapo College, 2012). Thus, the inclination to perceive\nthat a \"male\" occupation probably requires more education\nthan a \"female\" occupation appears to be based on a stereo-\ntype associating education with men in general.\nIn addition, in Study 2, male participants showed different\ninterest in the occupation depending on the gender of\nthe workers. Although female participants did not differenti-\nate very much based on worker gender, male participants\nwere more likely to be interested in male-dominated fields\nthan in female-dominated occupations. This is consistent\nwith past research findings and with the idea that there is\nmore social stigma to men being interested in \"feminine\"\noccupations, and less stigma to women expressing interest in\nfields more typically associated with men (cf. Miller &\nThe finding that interest in occupations is still influenced\nby the gendered nature of the job, while overt ratings of\noccupational prestige and salary are not is also consistent\nwith research on implicit versus explicit measures of atti-\ntudes. Many researchers have demonstrated subtle reactions,\nFigure 3. Mean ratings of interest in the occupation of Point of\nSales Systems Coordinator on a 10-point scale.\nNote. There was a significant interaction between occupational gender and\nparticipant gender on interest (p = .01).\nTable 3. Mean Judgments of Salary Worth by Occupational\nGender Across 20 Years.\nOccupational gender\n Male Female Difference p value n\n Mental health\ncasework\nCurrent data (in US$)\n Point of sales system\ncoordinator\n8 SAGE Open\ndue to automatic processes and implicit biases, in cases\nwhere overt, consciously discriminatory behaviors are absent\nor weak. Implicit and explicit attitudes often manifest very\ndifferently in terms of cognitive decision-making and behav-\nior (Banaji, & Greenwald, 1995; Dovidio, Kawakami, &\nIn a meta-analysis, Greenwald, Poehlman, Uhlmann, and\nImplicit Association Test (IAT) and explicit attitude measures.\nTheir results indicate predictive utility for both types of mea-\nsures with respect to relevant behaviors and physiological\nresponses; however, there were more variable predictive out-\ncomes for the explicit measures. In addition, for socially sensi-\ntive attitudes, such as racial judgments, the predictive validity\nof explicit measures was diminished. Thus, for topics for\nwhich participants might be motivated to control their self-\npresentation, explicit measures were less effective.\nIn the studies reported here, the participants did not show\novert sexism or racism in their ratings of occupational pres-\ntige. They did not estimate that women's occupations might\nbe worth less in salary than men's work, as was the case\n20 years ago. Decisions about salary and prestige require\nsome reasoned thought, and college students can consciously\nalter any biases they might feel. As stated earlier, these col-\nlege students are likely to hold gender equality as a conscious\nvalue. However, participants did employ some gender ste-\nreotypes regarding educational requirements and interest.\nThese are more subtle measures, without obvious sexist\novertones. For example, interest in an occupation can be\nviewed as influenced by many factors, including the proba-\nbility of success in the field, comfort level, and other cogni-\ntive and emotional reactions to the occupation. Thus, college\nstudents are less likely to cognitively guard against biased\nresponses on these types of measures, and implicit stereo-\ntypes and biases may come through.\nLimitations and Future Research\nAlthough the comparison over 20 years is enhanced by using\nthe same type of sample, the method necessarily limits the\ngeneralizability of the findings. These samples were drawn\nfrom a liberal public college which draws students from pri-\nmarily politically liberal geographical regions. While some\nresearchers also have found diminishing gaps in perceptions\nof occupational prestige by occupational gender (Goyder,\nGuppy, & Thompson, 2003), other researchers continue to\nfind obvious gaps (e.g., Williams et al., 2010). Continued\nresearch is needed to reconcile conflicting results. In addi-\ntion, past research findings on race and occupational status\nhave provided varying patterns with respect to the impact of\nracial identity on aspects of occupational prestige and suc-\ncess. The results of the current studies suggest that occupa-\ntional race and occupational gender interact in affecting\nperceptions of status, but not in consistent ways across\noccupations.\nOne promising avenue for continued research on gender,\nrace, and occupational prestige is the use of techniques to\nmeasure implicit gender and race stereotyping with respect\nto occupations. The IAT and other indirect measures to study\nsubtle, unconscious biases in perceptions of occupations are\nlogical, especially with participants who explicitly endorse\nliberal attitudes about gender and race (cf. Matheus, 2011;\nWhat then can be concluded from the current research?\nHave gender biases in perceptions of occupational prestige\nchanged in the past 20 years? In some regard, the answer is\nyes. In the early 1990s, the wage gap was wider, average\neducational achievement was lower for women, there were\nfewer women in visible positions of authority, and research\nshowed that college students displayed overt gender biases\nwhen judging the worth of gendered occupations. By 2011,\nthere were still wage gaps, but there has been progress in\nterms of women's presence in the societal power structure. In\nturn, college students' current perceptions of occupational\nstatus are less overtly influenced by the gender of the rele-\nvant labor force, although gendered perceptions of some\naspect of occupational attainment, such as personal interest\nand educational requirements, still exist. Hopefully, the next\n20 years will see gender biases in occupational perceptions\nmuted even further.\nAppendix A\nJob Description for Abstract Checker\nSummary\nExtends services to clients and related networks within an insurance company.\nDuties and Responsibilities\nAssist clients in day-to-day settlements\nAssure computations on premiums and interest accrued\nCalculate premiums and commissions\nAssure that data are accurate, in anticipation of audits\nNotify appropriate departments on changes in settlements\n"
