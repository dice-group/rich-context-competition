We analyzed new BP medication pre-\nscriptions for patients with uncontrolled hypertension\nusing the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey\nMethods. NAMCS is an annual, nationally representa-\ntive survey of all visits to nonfederal employed office-\nbased physicians who are primarily engaged in direct pa-\nwe identified visits by nonpregnant adults with an es-\ntablished hypertension diagnosis and elevated office BP\nof 140/90 mm Hg or greater, seen by physicians who usu-\nally manage BP, including general and family practition-\ners, internists, or cardiologists. NAMCS records at most\n8 medications; we excluded patients taking 8 \"contin-\nued\" medications because additional \"new\" (ie, ninth)\nmedications could not be assessed at these visits.\nWe measured new BP medication prescription (pres-\nence of a BP medication marked as \"new\" vs \"contin-\nued\" on the medication list) in our sample. We then\nconducted multivariate regression to determine the in-\ndependent association between new BP medication pre-\nscription and age, sex, race/ethnicity, payer, systolic\nand diastolic BP, patient-described visit reason, number\nof \"continued\" BP medications, comorbidities, physi-\ncian specialty and degree, primary and established care\nstatus, and survey year. Finally, we selected the stron-\ngest predictors from our regression model and plotted\ntheir association with new BP medication prescription.\nAll analyses were survey weighted and conducted using\nStata 11 statistical software (StataCorp).\nwere made by nonpregnant adults with diagnosed hy-\npertension and a measured office BP, who were cur-\nrently using less than 8 medications and seeing physi-\ncians who usually manage BP. Of these, 7153\nsample) had an elevated BP. Among these visits, 19.5%\nwere prescribed a new BP medication.\nIn multivariable regression (eTable 1, eTable 2, and\neFigure; http://www.archinternmed.com), the stron-\ngest predictors of new medication prescription were de-\ntient stated BP to be a visit reason (OR, 2.57 [95% CI,\nAfter dichotomizing BP elevation to stage 1 (systolic BP\nmm Hg) or stage 2 (systolic BP 160 mm Hg or dia-\nstolic BP 100 mm Hg),2 we plotted the likelihood of\nnew BP medication prescription by BP elevation, pa-\ntient identification of BP as a visit reason, and number\nof current BP medications (Figure). New BP medica-\ntion prescription exceeded 50% only among visits in which\nuntreated patients with stage 2 BP elevation identified\nBP as a visit reason.\nNew medication prescription did not increase from\nComment. Among patients with diagnosed hyperten-\nsion who were seeing physicians who manage BP, nearly\n60% had well-controlled hypertension. Among those with\nuncontrolled hypertension, however, new BP medica-\ntion was prescribed at just 19.5% of visits--with no im-\nwere substantially more common when patients identi-\nfied hypertension as a visit reason, but remained under\n50%, except among previously untreated patients with\nstage 2 BP elevation. Our findings are consistent with stud-\nies in more specific clinical settings4,5 and demonstrate\nthat the low likelihood of new BP medication prescrip-\ntion for uncontrolled hypertension is a national problem.\nWe also found that patient self-identification of BP as\na visit reason more than doubled the odds of new medi-\ncation prescription. Empowering patients to discuss BP\nwith their physicians through previsit forms, patient por-\ntals, education, and incentives may be a way to achieve\nbetter BP control, as shown in other studies.6,7\nOur analysis has several limitations. Most impor-\ntantly, NAMCS does not record medication dose; thus,\nour study speaks only to new medication prescription,\nnot to overall intensification. If NAMCS physicians es-\ncalated medication dose without adding a new medica-\ntion in the same ratio to overall intensification as in other\nstudies (1:3),5 the likelihood of intensification overall in\nour sample would have been 26%. However, new medi-\ncation prescription was often the only option (eg, among\nuntreated patients) or the best option (eg, low-dose com-\nbination therapy for stage 2 BP elevation, which tends\nto lower BP more effectively, with less adverse effects,\n\u00a92012 American Medical Association.

In addition, NAMCS does not\nrecord the reasons new medications are or are not pre-\nscribed; many (eg, white coat hypertension, patient pref-\nerence, nonadherence, regimen complexity, and acute\ncompeting concerns) might be clinically appropriate.\nDespite these limitations, our analysis suggests that\nmissed opportunities for new BP medication prescrip-\ntion are common in the United States. Taking advan-\ntage of these opportunities could result in improved BP\ncontrol among US patients.\nAuthor Affiliations: Divisions of Hospital Medicine (Dr\nKhanna) and General Internal Medicine (Dr Pletcher),\nand Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics (Dr\nPletcher), University of California, San Francisco; The\nHeart Institute and Hypertension Center of Excellence,\nCedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California (Dr\nVictor); Division of General Internal Medicine, San Fran-\ncisco General Hospital, San Francisco (Dr Bibbins-\nDomingo); and Departments of Medicine and Health Ser-\nvices, University of California, Los Angeles (Dr Shapiro).\nCorrespondence: Dr Khanna, Division of Hospital Medi-\ncine, University of California, San Francisco, 533 Par-\nAuthor Contributions: Study concept and design: Khanna,\nVictor, Shapiro, and Pletcher.
