The use of, and changes in the use of, formal (paid) and informal care by elderly persons who are chron-\nically disabled and living in the community was studied.\nMethods. Estimates were made of the sources and volume of home care use for persons reporting chronic disability\nvey data, and age.\nResults. The analyses showed changes over time in the sources of home care services. Generally, the combined use\nof both paid and informal home health care increased, whereas the use of either source of care alone decreased. The\namount spent on formal care increased with disability level and age.\nDiscussion. Use of formal sources of care by community disabled elderly residents increased, likely because of\nchanges in the Medicare home health care benefits in 1989. Increased use of home health care was associated with the\nconcurrent use of informal care.\nXPANDING public financing for home-based long-\nterm care (LTC) for disabled elderly persons is an issue\nthat has been debated for almost two decades. Limited pub-\nlic funding is currently available for home care, largely\nthrough Medicare and Medicaid, and only under specific\ncircumstances. Public spending for home care is a fraction\nof the spending for nursing home care, even though the ma-\njority of elderly persons needing LTC reside in the commu-\nnity and prefer home care. The majority of home care re-\nceived by disabled elderly persons is provided by family\nmembers (Manton, Stallard, & Corder, 1995), many of\nwhom incur substantial personal and economic costs.\nThe rapid growth of the elderly population is likely to in-\ncrease future LTC demand. How future LTC requirements\nwill be met is important for elderly persons and their fami-\nlies. It will be helpful to know who is receiving home care,\nwhat the sources of payments are, and how much out-of-\npocket costs are incurred. To examine national trends and\npatterns of use of home care, and sources of payment, we\nCare Surveys (NLTCS) and described the use and payment\npersons.\nLTC encompassing a range of health, social, and residen-\ntial services compensates for disabilities caused by physical,\ncognitive, or mental impairments. Physical disabilities can\nbe measured in terms of dependencies in activities of daily\nliving (ADLs) or in instrumental activities of daily living\n(IADLs; Katz, Ford, Moskowitz, Jackson & Jaffe, 1963;\nLawton & Brody, 1969). ADL dependencies result in need\nfor assistance in personal care functions. Five ADLs are\nwidely used--bathing, dressing, transferring from bed or\nchair, toileting, and eating. Dependency in IADLs reflects\ndifficulties performing household chores such as preparing\nmeals, shopping for groceries, and managing money. Some\nIADLs reflect cognitive as well as physical impairments.\nApproximately three quarters of disabled older persons\nreside in community settings and receive LTC from infor-\nmal sources such as spouses and other family members (Liu &\nManton, 1994). A smaller proportion of disabled older persons\nreceive LTC from informal sources and paid caregivers.\nThe roles of informal and paid caregivers differ depending\non the circumstances of the disabled older person. Paid care\nmight substitute for informal care in some situations and\ncomplement informal care in others (Greene, 1983). In a\nsmall proportion of cases, disabled older persons use only paid\nassistance, for example, when the informal care network is\nfragile and only small amounts of home-based LTC are\nneeded. Whether disabled persons receive home-based care\nfrom informal sources only, both informal and paid sources, or\nonly paid sources reflects the type and level of disability,\nstrength of the informal caregiver network, financial resources,\nand availability of services.\nLong-Term Care Expenditures\nnursing homes and $30 billion for home-based care (Levit et\nfinanced 45%; state and local sources, particularly Medicaid,\npaid 14%. Individuals paid 20% out of pocket. All other\nsources (e.g., private insurance) financed the balance.\nMedicaid limits coverage to people who are poor by wel-\nfare program standards or who become poor by incurring\nhealth care expenses. Medicaid's LTC expenditures are\nE\nmostly for nursing home care; in 1996 Medicaid's LTC ex-\npenditures for elderly persons were $31 billion--82% for\nnursing homes. The remaining expenditures were incurred\nfor home health, personal, and other home and community-\nbased care. Because states have not been uniform in their\nprovision of home and community-based services under\nMedicaid, access to services varies greatly (Coughlin, Ku, &\nMedicare focuses on coverage of acute health care costs,\nalthough liberalization of eligibility and coverage policies\nhas resulted in sometimes long periods of service use for\nsome beneficiaries. To qualify for home health services, a\nperson must be in need of skilled nursing care or therapy\nservices on an intermittent basis. Most chronically disabled\npeople do not need skilled care but rather nonmedical sup-\nportive care and assistance with self-care functions.\nThree other programs--the Social Services Block Grant\n(SSBG), the Older Americans Act, and the Supplemental\nSecurity Income (SSI) program--provide support for com-\nmunity-based LTC for impaired elderly persons. Because\nfunding for these programs is limited, their ability to pro-\nvide LTC is also limited. Some states use \"state-only\" funds\nto support home and community-based LTC.\nPolicy Context for Home Care\nPublic policy interest in home care evolved because of\nthe financial burden to federal and state governments of\nMedicaid spending for nursing home care, the impoverish-\ning consequences of use of nursing home care by disabled\nelderly persons, and the preference by elderly persons for\nhome care. Some analysts believe that expanded home- and\ncommunity-based LTC could be a lower cost alternative to\nnursing home care, especially for post-acute-care problems\n(e.g., Stewart, Vandenbroek, Pearson, & Horowitz, 1999).\nResearch and demonstration projects conducted to test\ncommunity-based LTC as a substitute for nursing home\ncare have had mixed findings. Research in the 1980s gener-\nally found that home-based care did not significantly reduce\nnursing home use (Kemper, Applebaum, & Harrigan, 1987).\nRecent research suggests, however, that states have saved\nmoney using home- and community-based LTC (Alecxih,\nLutzky, & Corea, 1996; U.S. General Accounting Office,\n1994). Research also found that expanded community-based\ncare improved the quality of life of disabled older persons,\nas well as of family caregivers. Some studies also reported\nsignificant improvements in the health and functioning (Stew-\nof older persons. Medicare home health care costs have in-\nshowed large declines in the rates of nursing home use\n(Manton, Corder, & Stallard, 1997). The rate of growth of\nMedicare home health costs was addressed in the Balanced\nPolicy makers have been slow to embrace home care be-\ncause of a fear of rapid expenditure growth (Wiener & Han-\nley, 1992). Because of the popularity of home-based LTC,\nthere has been concern about \"woodwork effects\" (i.e., in-\nduced demand) if such services were made available. The\noverriding issue, as yet unresolved, is whether the public or\nprivate sectors, or a combination, should be financing LTC.\nDifferent positions have been taken on who should provide\nfinancing. Some proposals would establish a new social in-\nsurance program for LTC or include LTC in a national\nhealth insurance program. Others would provide tax incen-\ntives for the purchase of private LTC insurance. Other pro-\nposals include new public funding for care but do not cover\nall disabled people or all expenses.\nAs strategies for reforming the financing and provision of\nLTC evolve, data on the disabled population and its use of\nLTC will be helpful in informing policy makers about the\nbeneficiaries of various reform options. In this article we\npresent data on a subset of all persons requiring LTC: dis-\nabled older community residents.\nMETHODS\nWe used data from the NLTCS, which were designed to\nmeasure the prevalence of chronic disability and institution-\nalization in the U.S. elderly, Medicare-enrolled population,\nand changes experienced by those individuals (Manton et\nveys. The three surveys used the same survey methodology\nand instruments (Manton et al., 1997). Data were drawn\nfrom lists of Medicare-eligible persons aged 65 and older\nfor 173 primary sampling units (PSUs). Because of the two-\nstage sample design, only persons with chronic disability\nwere given detailed community interviews. To assume that\nall persons aged 65 and older are represented in each year,\nwe gathered an age-in sample of 5,000 persons who passed\nsons and persons aged 95 and older were also drawn. Com-\nparisons could be made between years to determine trends\n1994 elicited information on persons identified as chroni-\ncally disabled (i.e., having a disability that lasted, or was ex-\npected to last, at least 90 days) according to 9 ADL or 11\nIADL questions. Of relevance for policy initiatives, the\nNLTCS collected data on the five \"core\" ADLs--bathing,\ndressing, transferring, toileting, and eating. A study by\nWiener and Hanley (1992) suggested that ADLs can be rel-\natively well measured in a variety of national surveys.\nAnother set of questions in each NLTCS referred to care-\ngivers of disabled elderly persons. Data collected included\nthe relation of the caregiver to the disabled person, whether\nthe caregiver was paid, sources of payment if the caregiver\nwas paid, and how much the disabled person paid out of\nmany hours of care disabled persons received in the preced-\ning week from caregivers. Comparable data were not avail-\nIn addition to data on disability levels and caregiver pro-\nfiles, information about prior use of health care, income, liv-\ning arrangements, and demographic characteristics was col-\nlected in the NLTCS. These data are useful in estimating\nhow disabled subgroups' use of home-based LTC differed.\nFINDINGS\nWe first describe the population of disabled elderly per-\nsons, their disability status, and their informal and paid\ncaregivers. Second, we describe disabled elderly persons\nwho received paid home care and sources of payment.\nThird, we describe persons paying home-based services out\nof pocket, the amounts paid, and the relation between char-\nacteristics of those persons and out-of-pocket payments.\nDisabled Elderly Persons\nresiding in institutions and in the community, according to\ntheir disability level, are shown in Table 1. The number of\nelderly persons in the United States increased from 27 mil-\nthree years, 16\u00ad18% of the total elderly population was dis-\nabled and residing in the community; 5\u00ad6% resided in insti-\ntutions. The number of disabled elderly community resi-\ndents increased from 4.8 million to 5.3 million between\n1994. Despite the aging of the population aged 65 and older,\nthe institutional population increased little between 1989\nBecause the number of elderly persons increased steadily, the\nresident disabled elderly persons has to be due to a declining\npopulation disabled and residing in the community or in in-\nstitutions declined. The decline of the elderly disabled popu-\nestimates from other surveys, for example, Crimmins, Saito,\nand Reynolds (1997), the Survey of Income and Program\nParticipation (SIPP; U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1991),\nFreedman and Martin (1998), and the Medicare Current\nBeneficiary Survey (MCBS; Adler, 1994). All of these surveys\nA shift toward paid caregivers.--To analyze trends in\ntypes of caregivers assisting disabled elderly people between\nformal helpers, and both paid and informal helpers.

That\nis, the more severely disabled a person was, the less likely\neither informal or paid care, by itself, could meet the needs\nof that person. In 1994, 28% of disabled elderly persons had\nboth informal and paid assistance, and 55% of persons with\nfive ADLs received combined assistance.\nThe data clearly indicate that paid care increased between\nbased LTC. The increase is due to many factors, such as\nhigher incomes, worse health, and less availability of infor-\nmal caregivers. Policy changes in publicly financed home\nservices under Medicaid and Medicare (e.g., expansion of\nhome- and community-based care services under Medicaid\nand liberalization of coverage requirements under Medi-\ncare's home health benefit) could account for increases in\nicaid expenditures for community-based care increased dra-\ning grew at an annual rate of 24.6%. Such increases slowed\nin the early 1990s, but expenditure growth still remained\nSimilarly, Medicare home health care expenditures in-\nmately 25% per year. The growth in Medicare home health\ncare expenditures was due, in large part, to liberalization in\nTable 1.

The number of helper hours received\nwas related to ADL dependency. In 1994, two thirds of per-\nsons with only IADL dependencies received fewer than 25 h\nof help in a week, whereas only one fifth of persons with\nfive ADL dependencies received that amount of help.\nNearly half of persons with five ADLs (44%) received more\nthan 57 h of help in a week.\nIn 1989, persons with three ADLs received an average of\n35 h of assistance in a week. Those with five ADLs aver-\naged 83 h. In contrast, persons with only IADL dependen-\ncies received only 14 h of assistance in a week, and half of\nthem received fewer than 8 h. One study found Medicaid\nhome care recipients with three or more ADLs received ap-\nproximately the same total hours of care regardless of the\namount of informal family contributions--in 1995, an aver-\nage of 65 h per week (Hokenstad, Ramirez, Haslanger, &\nmedians decreased, particularly for persons with high levels\nof ADL dependency. The reasons for this decrease are not\nclear, but declines in the proportion of people with unpaid\ncaregivers could be one cause, if unpaid caregivers provided\nmore hours of assistance, on average, than did paid caregivers.\nSources of Paid Care\nThe proportion of disabled elderly persons who received\nhelp from paid caregivers increased, on average, from one\nIncreased participation by most payment sources.--\nInformation on how frequently each payment source was\nmentioned by disabled persons with paid helpers in 1982,\nhelp (e.g., nursing and ADL assistance).

As ex-\npected, out-of-pocket payments increased with ADL depen-\ndency, from $128 for persons with IADL or one ADL de-\npendency to $544 for persons with three or more ADLs.\nTable 7 also presents the payment at selected percentile levels\nfor disability groups.

A review of the group with three or more\nADLs shows, compared with the overall 1994 average of\n$576 of out-of-pocket expenses in a month, persons aged 75\nand older spent $631 a month. Unmarried individuals spent\n$756. This is consistent with such persons not having infor-\nmal assistance from a spouse, who would generally be an\nimportant caregiver.

One might expect use of nursing home care to\nbe associated with worse health beyond that controlled for\nby ADL level. On the other hand, persons with prior nursing\nhome stays might have received more home care from other\nsources, such as Medicare or Medicaid, offsetting the need\nfor out-of-pocket payments.

For example, about 15% of Medicare skilled\nnursing facility patients subsequently receive Medicare home\nhealth services (Medicare Payment Advisory Commission,\n1998). Finally, urban residency was associated with higher\nout-of-pocket payments, because of higher prices.\nDISCUSSION\nThe projected growth of the U.S. elderly and oldest-old pop-\nulations when baby boom cohorts reach older ages foreshadows\nincreasing LTC demand. Our finding, and its replication in\nother surveys, that disability rates among elderly persons de-\nclined in recent years suggests that future LTC demand may be\nmuch less than it would be otherwise. It will be important, how-\never, to closely monitor future changes in disability prevalence.\nAlong with recent declines in disability rates, we identi-\nfied recent changes in the sources and amounts of home care\nreceived by the disabled elderly population. Such patterns are\nimportant because they indicate how use of currently available\npublic and private resources has been changing. Maintaining a\ndisabled elderly person in his or her own home or other non-\ninstitutional setting often requires a combination of payer\nsources to meet costs, in addition to the predominant presence\nwe identified four trends.\nThe proportion of disabled elderly persons who relied on\nonly paid or only informal helpers declined between 1989\nand 1994. The proportion of those using both sources in-\ncreased. Increases in the proportion of people relying on\nboth sources of care were large among disabled persons\nwith the highest levels of ADL dependencies (i.e., five\nADLs). Changes in family demographics, increasing oppor-\ntunity costs of informal caregivers, and increasingly more\ncomplex clinical profiles of disabled elderly persons in the\ncommunity might explain this trend. For example, competing\nneeds of informal caregivers, who tend to be women, and\nthe increasing role of women in the economic workplace\nmay account for some of the increase in reliance on combined\nuse of both informal and paid caregivers. Consistent with\nthis notion, a study of New York City Medicaid home care\nusers found the vast majority of family caregivers are female\nand children of the home care recipients. Approximately\nDespite the increased use of paid sources, our analysis did not\nindicate a diminished role of informal caregivers. Other studies\nhave indicated that informal care continues to be an important\nsource of care, even for people eligible for program services.\nFor example, individuals with families who contribute to their\ncare received about 40% of their total assistance (Medicaid\nhome care plus family care) from family members.\ncoverage increased, and Medicaid coverage declined. Medicare\ncoverage of nursing helpers leveled off, but Medicare coverage\nfor ADL and IADL helpers increased. This is consistent\nwith Medicare home health use changes--more visits per\nperson and more visits by aides who perform ADL or IADL\nservices. It is also consistent with the rapid expansion in\nMedicare home health spending after 1989 that resulted from a\nliberalization of coverage guidelines (Scanlon, 1997).\nCoverage by Medicaid might have declined during this\nperiod because of states' increased interest in maximizing\nMedicare financing for services that might otherwise have\nbeen paid by Medicaid. Several studies have found that\nMedicare and Medicaid expenditures were inversely related\n(Cohen & Tumlinson, 1997; Kenney, Rajan & Soscia,\nintended to reduce Medicare home health spending. As the\nprovisions take effect in coming years, it will be important\nto monitor the extent to which Medicaid responds to Medi-\ncare reductions, as well as to determine if the 1997 Bal-\nanced Budget Act provisions result in increased burdens for\ndisabled elderly persons and their families.\nThird, the number of hours of home care per week, either in\nterms of combined paid and informal care or of only paid care,\nregardless of their ADL or IADL dependency. Although we do\nnot have a clear explanation for this trend, one possibility might\nbe the increasing availability and use of technical and mechani-\ncal aides, such as personal emergency response systems, mi-\ncrowave ovens, and grab bars. Reductions in paid helper hours\nper week might have been due to the shift in reliance on fi-\nnancing from Medicaid, which is more LTC oriented, to Medi-\ncare, which limits coverage to conditions that require skilled\ncare or supervision (e.g., Stewart et al., 1999).\nFourth, only small changes in out-of-pocket payments were\nobserved, with the possible exception of the most disabled\nTable 8. Average Out-of-Pocket Payments in a Month by Selected Characteristics of Disabled Persons and Disability Levels\nCharacteristic All Persons IADL or 1 ADL 2 or More ADLs 3 or More ADLs All Persons IADL or 1 ADL 2 or More ADLs 3 or More ADLs\nNotes: ADL  activities of daily living; IADL  instrumental activities of daily living. Data are from the 1989 and 1994 waves of the National Long Term Care\nSurvey. Dollar amounts are inflation adjusted to the 1994 Consumer Price Index.\npersons and those at the high end of the spending distribution,\nDespite the growth of Medicare home care, about 20% of the\ndisabled elderly persons spent money out of pocket for home-\nbased care to compensate for ADL and IADL dependencies.\nIn 1994, for example, persons with three or more ADLs\npaid $576 a month. Persons with the highest out-of-pocket\npayments tended not only to have the most disability, but\nalso to have other characteristics that made them vulnerable.\nPersons with three or more ADLs who lived alone or had\nbeen hospitalized in the preceding 12 months had higher\nthan average out-of-pocket payments for home care.\nIn sum, in our descriptive analysis of trends in home care\nand amounts of care. Although the possibility or extent of\nsubstitution between sources was beyond the scope of our\nanalysis, the findings do suggest that coverage by different\nsources is fluid and changes can occur in relatively short periods\nof time. These results further suggest that changes in the\npolicies of one program could impact significantly the im-\nportance of that program (e.g., Medicare) as well as those of\nother funding sources (e.g., Medicaid). On the other hand, our\nfindings do provide continuing support to the importance of\nfocusing home care support on the most severely disabled\nelderly persons. They are the most likely to use paid services,\nto use the most hours of paid care, and to pay the most money\nout of pocket for such care. The most severely disabled elderly\npersons and their families are also most likely to be nega-\ntively impacted by contractions in publicly supported home\ncare, as envisioned in the 1997 Balanced Budget Act pro-\nvisions to constrain Medicare spending for home health.\nIn conclusion, our findings indicate the continuing impor-\ntance of home care services for disabled older persons. As\nthe number and proportion of older Americans increase in\nthe coming decades, policy discussions addressing expan-\nsion of publicly financed home care services are also likely\nto increase. The way in which home care services will be\nexpanded and the magnitude of potential expansions will re-\nflect philosophical, political, and budgetary considerations.\nGiven the continuing concern that the popularity of home\ncare services will induce \"woodwork effects,\" any proposed\nexpansion in services will likely be accompanied by rules\nconstraining eligibility, coverage, and reimbursements. In\nthis regard, current policies governing Medicaid's home\ncare services and ongoing debate on the management of\nMedicare's home health benefit will provide important\nguidance for those designing future program features.\n"
