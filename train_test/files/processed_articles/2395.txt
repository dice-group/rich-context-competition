Provide recommendations for researchers on the use of the Big Five personality battery in the National\nSocial Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP), and ensure that the battery does proxy the Big Five. Also, describe the\nlevels of Big Five traits across gender and age.\nMethod. We used an Exploratory Structural Equation Model (ESEM) to analyze NHSAP's personality battery, com-\nparing NSHAP with the National Longitudinal Study of Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) and the Health and\nRetirement Study (HRS).\nResults. ESEM revealed a 5-factor structure in the NSHAP battery, but with considerable cross-loadings. When these\ncross-loadings were not included in the model, model fit notably worsened. Reliabilities of Big Five scales were compa-\nrable to the HRS and MIDUS, even though NSHAP's battery is shorter. Women were considerably more Agreeable than\nmen, although this gender gap closed among the oldest in the sample (80 years or older).\nDiscussion.Researchers will be able to make use of NSHAP's personality battery to examine a range of social,\nbiological, and psychological factors at older ages, in light of individuals' general traits. We recommend models which\nallow for cross-loadings.\nKey words: Big Five--Factor analysis--NSHAP--Personality traits.\nThe purpose of this paper is to analyze variation\nin National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project\n(NSHAP's) battery of personality items. We will show that\nthe variation in these items is primarily explained by five\nfactors which correspond closely to what have been identi-\nfied as the Big Five, a commonly used model of person-\nality (John, Naumann, & Soto, 2008; Marsh, Nagengast,\nFollowing this analysis, we provide recommendations to\nresearchers on how to use this battery in research on aging,\ntraits, health, and social connectedness. The presence of the\nBig Five in NSHAP provides researchers with a new and\nunique opportunity to link personality traits and social fac-\ntors together in terms of how they produce good health at\nolder ages, and this paper provides researchers with meth-\nodological guidance for such analyses.\nPersonality traits describe characteristic differences in\nindividuals' thinking, emotion, and behavior in relation to\nbody of literature has linked differences in personality traits\ntodifferencesinphysicalandmentalhealth(Hampson,2012;\nOzer & Benet-Mart\u00ednez, 2006; Shannahan, Hill, Roberts, &\nEccles, 2012). The effect of Conscientiousness on mortal-\nity is comparable to that of socioeconomic status (Roberts,\nKuncel, Shiner, Caspi, & Goldberg, 2007), and there is a\nstrong and positive association between Extraversion and\nsubjective well-being (Ozer & Benet-Mart\u00ednez, 2006).\nOverall, research has shown that personality matters across\na range of social, psychological, and physical domains\n(Hampson, 2012; Hampson, Goldberg, Vogt, & Dubanoski,\ndescribe the way that a person interacts with his or her envi-\nronment, the features of this environment will be conse-\nquential for how personality does or does not contribute to\nperspective, which sees personality and the environment in\nterms of dynamic relationships, may be enriched by data\non the characteristics of individuals' social environments,\nlinked to data on personality traits (Lodi-Smith & Roberts,\nThe present paper describes nationally representa-\ntive data on personality traits, available from the NSHAP,\nwhich may be uniquely valuable to researchers interested\nin integrated, interdisciplinary models of the aging process\nbecause of its rich set of measures on networks, neigh-\nborhoods, social support, and marital quality (Cornwell,\nLindau, Laumann, Levinson, & Waite, 2003). Our aim is\nIveniuk ET AL.\nto provide researchers with a validation of these meas-\nures within the NSHAP sample, since they were modified\nfrom previous versions, and also to recommend methods\nfor using these measures in future papers. The first wave\nof NSHAP produced a number of findings related to older\nadults' social networks, psychological well-being, and\nphysical health (Cornwell et al., 2008; Cornwell & Waite,\nnot include measures of psychological traits. NSHAP Wave\n2 includes a personality battery, adapted from the Midlife\nDevelopment Inventory (MIDI), that proxies the Big Five\nThe Big Five\nTheBigFivetraitsare:Opennesstoexperience,orseeking\nvariety in types of experiences; Conscientiousness, or being\nnorm-abiding and delaying gratification; Extraversion, or\nbeing lively and sociable; Agreeableness or being com-\nmunally oriented and altruistic; and finally Neuroticism or\nemotional instability, which entails a vulnerability to nega-\ntive affect (John et al., 2008). These traits can be abbrevi-\nated into the mnemonic acronym \"OCEAN.\"\nThe Big Five is perhaps the most well-validated taxo-\nnomic system for personality, vis-a-vis four important crite-\nria. First, while there may be traits that are beyond or outside\nof the Big Five, many other traits are nested within the Big\nFive as subscales or sub-dimensions of the space of possi-\nthe Big Five components can be found across social status,\nethnicity, gender, language, or culture, (Costa & McCrae,\nThird, Big Five traits have strong interrater reliability, as\nwell as agreement between self-ratings and outside observ-\ners (Costa & McCrae, 1992a). Fourth, Big Five traits are\nhighly stable over the life course, especially at older adult-\nhood, meaning it is plausible to assume for most of the\nNSHAP sample that their traits have been stable for some\ntime before they were interviewed (Cobb-Clark & Schurer,\ngests that test\u00adretest correlations of Big Five traits asymp-\ntotically approach 1.0 as age increases, and the gap between\ntest and retest decreases (Roberts & DelVecchio, 2000).\nThe Big Five is therefore an integrated taxonomic system\nfor classifying individuals according to personality traits,\nallowing researchers to proxy factors which are temporally\n(and perhaps causally) prior to some outcome of interest.\nMethod\nThe second wave of NSHAP was collected in 2010\u00ad\nwave interviewed 3,005 older adults, with a response rate\nof 75.5%. Seven hundred and forty-four respondents were\nnot reinterviewed at W2, for various reasons including\ndeath and poor health. This left 2,261 returning respond-\nents. However, the second wave also instituted a partner\nmodule, where 955 spouses or cohabiting romantic part-\nners of respondents were given the same survey instru-\nment as W1 returning respondents. Some respondents who\ndeclined to participate in W1, and who were not coded as\nhostile by the interview team in W1, were also contacted\nagain to see if they would reconsider participating in the\nsurvey. Altogether, including partners and new respond-\nents, interviews were completed with 3,377 respondents\nin W2. The data collection process at both waves involved\na 90-min in-person interview, which captured the major-\nity of biological, psychological, and social measures.\nFollowing this, the respondent was given a leave-behind\nquestionnaire, to return on their own time, which included\nthe MIDI. The NSHAP MIDI is a list of 21 adjectives\nthat the respondent is asked to use to rate themselves, on\na four-point scale, ranging from \"not at all\" to \"a little,\"\n\"some,\" and \"a lot.\" In households where both partners\nparticipated, both were asked to fill out the leave-behind\nquestionnaire.\nIt is worth describing how the MIDI compares with other\npersonality batteries that also measure the Big Five, since\nthere are multiple instruments which purport to capture these\nsame traits (Costa & McCrae, 1992b; Gosling, Rentfrow, &\nity batteries as part of a omnibus in-home survey creates a\nproblem, because these batteries tend to be quite long (Costa\n& McCrae, 1992b), and therefore burdensome. Shortening\nthese batteries can also lead to severe problems with reliabil-\nity and validity (Gosling et al., 2003). The MIDI is relatively\nshort, but according to previous analyses of its factor struc-\nture, long enough that it accurately taps the traits of inter-\nest, according to numerous previous tests of the measure's\nvalidity (Lachman & Weaver, 1997; Zimprich, Allemand, &\nLachman, 2012). The developers of the MIDI carried out a\npilot study of 574 men and women, and then selected a list\nof adjectives with high item-to-total correlations and factor\nloadings for use in the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS)\nstudy (Goodwin & Gotlib, 2004). The NSHAP team further\nmodified the MIDI to shorten it further, in order to fit it into an\nalready lengthy leave-behind questionnaire. The differences\nbetween the MIDUS MIDI, Health and Retirement Study\n(HRS) MIDI, and the NSHAP MIDI battery are shown in\nany of the MIDI questions (84.3%). The adjective with the\nleast amount of missing data was \"responsible,\" which 2,754\npeople answered, and the adjectives with the most missing\ndata were \"nervous\" and \"warm,\" tied with 2,688 nonmissing\nvalues each. After dropping those cases which had missing\navailable (NSHAP Wave 2: Waite, Linda J., Kathleen Cagney,\nWilliam Dale, Elbert Huang, Edward O.

National Social Life, Health, and\nAging Project (NSHAP):Wave 2 and Partner Data Collection.\nResults\nFactor Structure of the NSHAP MIDI\nWe now turn to an analysis of the MIDI factor struc-\nture. We carried out an Exploratory Structural Equation\nModeling (ESEM) analysis on the MIDI personality bat-\ntery, in order to ascertain that a Big Five factor structure\nexisted within these adjectives after they had been modi-\nfied by the NSHAP investigative team. We chose ESEM\nbecause other authors have argued that confirmatory factor\nanalyses (CFAs) are not adequate to the complex structure\nAll analyses were carried out using MPlus v.6.2 statisti-\ncal software using mean and variance-adjusted weighted\nbecause WLSMV is appropriate for binary or ordinal out-\ncome variables in an ESEM context (Muth\u00e9n & Muth\u00e9n,\nExploratory factor analyses (EFAs) using Maximum\nLikelihood produced very similar results, with only five fac-\ntors having eigenvalues over 1.0. EFA with WLSMV pro-\nduced identical results, which is expected, since ESEM is\nEFA in an SEM framework (Asparouhov & Muth\u00e9n, 2009).\nWLSMV handles missing data by computing pairwise\npolychoric correlations between all variables in the data\nset, rather than restricting the analysis to individuals with\ncomplete information on every variable, and this procedure\nhas been shown to be more efficient than listwise deletion\nFactor scores can therefore be estimated even for those who\ndid not answer some of the items, though with less preci-\nsion. Latent factors predicted manifest, measured adjectives\nusing ordinal probit links--which assumes that each vari-\nable reflects an underlying, normally distributed variable--\nand the factor analysis underwent a varimax rotation. The\nroot mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA) was\ncomparative fit index (CFI) and Tucker\u00adLewis index (TLI)\nChi-squared statistics comparing the fitted model to a satu-\nrated model were significant up to 10 factors, which is not\nsurprising given the chi-squared test of model fit is sensitive\nto sample size, and therefore is almost always significant\nwith large samples (Ullman & Bentler, 2003). Although the\nfit is less than perfect, a five-factor solution fits the data\nreasonably well, and is commensurate with the expectation\nthat the MIDI does proxy the Big Five. We therefore chose\na five-factor solution.\nTable 2 shows the varimax-rotated factor loadings. Cells\nwere left blank if factor loadings were not significant at\np < .05; entries are bolded for the largest factor loading\nin each row. Note as well that there are two exceptions to\nthe expected factor structure. First, \"active,\" which is sup-\nposed to load on to Extraversion, loads more strongly on\nto Conscientiousness. This may be because at older ages\n\"staying active\" is a phrase that is often associated with\nexercise, and as such, may be more readily understood as\nan expression of conscientiousness (Mitka, 2001). Second,\n\"warm\" seems to load on to Extraversion, although it\nhas a very similar, and almost as large, factor loading on\nAgreeableness, its expected factor. For the most part,\nthough, the factor structure presents as expected. Splitting\nthe sample by gender also produced very similar results. We\ntherefore hold that the MIDI appropriately captures the Big\nFive in NSHAP.\nResearchers could also carry out a CFA, which con-\nstrains factor loadings to zero if the adjective does not load\non its theoretically specified latent factor (i.e., the adjec-\ntive \"active\" could be constrained to only load on the\nTable 1.

We then calculated a chi-squared\ntest comparing the fit of two, nested models to each other,\none with cross-loadings, and one without. The chi-squared\ntest was significant at p < .001, meaning we can confidently\nreject the null hypothesis that allowing for cross-loadings\ndoes not improve model fit. Furthermore, the constrained\nEFA-in-CFA had notably worse model fit according to the\ntherefore concluded that factor scores from a model which\nallows for cross-loadings, were a better fit to the data, and\nmore useful to researchers. (Previous studies have also\nshown that the MIDI factor structure is largely invariant\nacross age groups, recommending it for use among older\nComparison of Factor Scores Versus Scales\nWe compared the factor scores from this analysis to scales\nconstructed from the adjectives; when we say \"scores\" we\nmean predicted values of the latent variables produced\nfrom the factor analysis in Table 2, while \"scales\" are the\nunweighted average of the adjectives that theoretically load\nonto the latent factors (see Table 1). Alpha reliabilities for\nthese scales were generally good and comparable to alphas\nfrom other nationally representative surveys that employ\nthe MIDI. In Table 3, we show the results from calculat-\ning the alpha values for personality scales from the second\nwave of the MIDUS study, as well as the 2010 wave of the\nHRS. We used the entire sample of each survey's wave\nto compute these results. We can see that Neuroticism in\nNSHAP had the lowest alpha value, and was lower than\nexpected given the alphas in MIDUS and HRS, however,\nit is still within an acceptable range. Note the difference\nfrom MIDUS and HRS, suggesting that shortening the\nscale may have led to this drop in reliability. We also tested\nthe correlations between the more restricted scales, used\nin NSHAP, and the fuller scales using data from the 2010\nwave of the HRS. Looking at Table 1, we can see that the\nscales for Openness, Conscientiousness, and Agreeableness\nare shorter in NSHAP than they are in HRS.\nWe also looked at the intercorrelations within scales,\nand the correlation between scores and scales; these are\nshown in Table 4. This table contains two separate corre-\nlation matrixes. The first panel shows correlations among\nthe scales, and one result is that the scales are all intercor-\nrelated. It is possible that the varimax-rotated factor scores\nand the scales do not capture the same latent construct. This\ncould be the case since some adjectives, like \"active\" and\n\"warm,\" do not load on to the factor that we would theoreti-\ncally expect. In order to test this, panel 2 correlates scores\nwith scales. We can see that all correlations along the diago-\nnal--that is, between a score and its scale counterpart--are\ngreater than .90, and in the case of Neuroticism, the correla-\ntion is almost perfect. This may be because Neuroticism is\nthe most distinct factor from the other four, in that it has the\nmost minimal cross-loading with other factors. One reason\nfor this might be that the neuroticism scale is composed of\nthree negative items and one positive item, whereas all the\nother scales are composed of positive items.\nGiven the high correlation between scales and scores for\nthe same construct, as well as potential problems arising from\ncollinearity among scales, we recommend the use of factor\nscores. Fitting an SEM with WLSMV, or some other proce-\ndure capable of assuaging problems with missing data, could\nalso prove useful when computing factor scores. In addition\nto the method presented here, a researcher could employ\nTable 3.

Regardless, whenever pos-\nsible, it seems preferable to use factor scores.\nAge and Gender\nA great deal of research on personality is focused on the\nquestion of age differences in personality, and as such, it\nprovides us with heavily replicated findings concerning\nage trajectories in personality traits (Roberts, Walton, &\nSrivastava & John, 2003). In older adulthood, individuals\nshould be largely stable in terms of their personality traits\n(Roberts & DelVecchio, 2000), although some evidence\nTable 4.

Lines were produced\nusing the command in Stata. Lines also possess 95% confi-\ndence interval (CI) bars, in order to call attention to gender\ndifferences that are significant at p < .05. Point estimates\nwere calculated using NSHAP W2 sampling weights, and\nCI bars were computed using settings within Stata, using\nthe command to obtain correct variance estimates for the\nindividuals who returned the leave-behind questionnaire.\nIndividuals who fell outside the W2 returning respond-\nents' age range--that is, 64\u00ad90--were excluded from the\nanalysis. Otherwise, all respondents were included, mean-\ning these figures do include partners. Finally, note that the\ny-axes all have the same range, in order to further facilitate\ncomparisons between these graphs. Recall that the factor\nscores are standardized, and as such are centered on zero\nfor the whole sample of men and women at every age. Also,\nnote that these are estimated factor scores, since the true\nvalues of the latent construct are unknown.\nNumerous personality traits do show age-related declines,\nalthough the change is most dramatic for Openness. Men\nand women also generally have similar levels of the Big\nFive traits over the age range in NSHAP, with one important\nexception: women were generally much more agreeable\nthan men, and in the youngest age group, their point esti-\nmate for Agreeableness is more than a full standard devia-\ntion higher than for men. This gap begins to close in the\nmiddle age category, and for the oldest old in the NSHAP\nsample, there is no longer a significant difference. Both\nmen and women contribute to closing this gap, although\nmen more so. This pattern of convergence seems to be\nunique to Agreeableness in the sample. Other traits, such as\nOpenness and Neuroticism, seem to show the widest gender\ngaps in the middle age category. For Conscientiousness and\nExtraversion, the gender gap never appears significant.\nDiscussion\nSeveral patterns emerged in our analyses. We found\nthat women generally had higher Agreeableness than men,\nwhich is commensurate with previous studies that have\nshown that women generally score higher on Agreeableness\nWe also described age trends in Agreeableness, Openness,\nExtraversion, and Conscientiousness. However, we cannot\nuse these results to say that any of these traits change with\nage. The MIDI battery was added to the second wave of the\nNSHAP survey, and we are not able to compare the results of\nthis analysis to results fromW1. The language above has tried\nto refrain, therefore, from discussing age differences in terms\nof age-related changes. Without longitudinal data on these\nmeasures, we cannot separate cohort, period, and age-related\neffects. The patterns that we describe in Agreeableness and\nOpenness are, however, in accord with studies describing\nthe relationship between personality traits and age (Roberts\nthat there are age-related differences between individuals in\nthe NSHAP sample in personality scores, especially in men's\nAgreeableness. The large gap between men and women\non this trait suggests that gender may be an important con-\nfounder in any multivariate analysis predicting some out-\ncome using Agreeableness. The converse may also be true:\ngender differences in health behaviors, attitudes, psychologi-\ncal well-being, and quality of life may be partially attribut-\nable to differences in Agreeableness.\nAnother important methodological consideration aris-\ning from our analysis is that if a researcher estimates factor\nscores, and then uses them as predictors in some regres-\nsion analysis, then this assumes that the scores are produced\nwithout error, and that the score produced by the factor anal-\nysis is an accurate depiction of the individual's position in\nthe trait space. Simultaneously, estimating latent traits and\npredicting outcomes using those traits (i.e., fitting a SEM)\nwould be a solution to this issue. Scales, similarly, should\nbe approached with caution, considering the alpha values\nof the scales are modest, implying that they are less reliable\nthan factor scores in proxying the underlying traits; the con-\nsiderable number of cross-loadings are likely responsible for\nthese low alpha values, since the true trait is seemingly not a\nfunction of the theoretically specified adjectives alone (e.g.,\nboth Extraversion and Agreeableness affect how highly one\nrates oneself on the adjective \"warm\"). Alternative mod-\neling strategies such as bifactor and general factor models,\nmay provide additional information about the properties of\nthe MIDI battery, as well as substantial insights into person-\nality processes and structure. In any event, it seems prefer-\nable to use factor scores instead of scales.\nConclusions\nIn this article, we offered recommendations for the use of\nthe MIDI in multivariate analyses using NSHAP. We con-\ncluded that factor scores rather than averaged scales would be\nmore appropriate for such analyses, for several reasons. First,\nthe MIDI factor structure contains a considerable number of\ncross-loadings, and without taking these cross-loadings into\naccount, model fit suffers considerably; this corresponds with\nfindings from a similar analysis carried out on the MIDI in\nMIDUS (Zimprich et al., 2012). Secondly, fitting a model to\nthe data using WLSMV allows for less missing data, mean-\ning multivariate analyses using factor scores will not be as\nreduced in sample size, compared with analyses that used\naveraged scales. Third, regressions predicting some conse-\nquential outcomes could be combined with an ESEM or CFA\nin a single model, meaning factor scores would not need to be\nestimated, and factors could be related to this consequential\noutcome directly. Fifth, there may be less attenuation when\nusing the scores as covariates, due to the shrinkage involved\nPersonality Measures in the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project\nin estimating the factor scores, depending on how scores are\nestimated. However, both scores and scales are likely to be\nuseful in multivariate analysis, and the range of variables\ncontained in NSHAP offer a unique opportunity to describe,\nand theorize, interactions between persons and environments\nthrough the medium of personality traits.\nFunding\nThis work was supported by the National Institutes of Health includ-\nBehavioral and Social Sciences Research for the National Health, Social\nresponsible for the data collection.
