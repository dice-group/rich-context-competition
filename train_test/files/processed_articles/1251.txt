Bone mineral status of preterm infants was compared\nwith children who were born at term gestation. The average follow-up was\n7 years. A sample of children who were born prematurely was recalled from\nan infant nutrition study. Children born at term gestation who had similar\nbody weight for age were recruited from the community. Bone mineral\nevaluation was conducted in a group of 20 children born prematurely with\nbirth weight less than 1.5 kg and in 15 children born at term gestation. Body\nweight for age was similar between the groups. All children were born of\nappropriate size for gestational age at birth. All children had their body\nweight and height measured. Comparisons for growth assessment status were\nmade with the NHANES III database and published standards. Dietary intakes\nand food frequency were analyzed. The bone mineral status was measured at\ntwo sites, lumbar spine and distal third radius bone.\nResults: The average age was 7 years, with a range of 5 to 9 years.\nCompared with the reference population, children who were born\nprematurely on the average had lower weights, heights and body mass\nindex.

Causes of\nosteopenia of prematurity include calcium, phosphorus and\nvitamin D deficiency, liver and renal disorders, and medications\nsuch as steroids and diuretics.1,2 Many of these preterm infants\nsuffer poor growth and fractures.3 However, the long-term\nconsequences of osteopenia are important, as more preterm infants\nare surviving. During infancy, preterm infants grow more slowly\nand are smaller than term infants, but by early childhood the\nmajority of preterm children are reported to have normal weights\nand heights.4,5 This study was performed to evaluate preterm\ninfants' growth and bone mineralization after the age of 5 years.\nMethods\nSubjects\nA total of 20 children who were born prematurely with a birth weight\nless than 1.5 kg were studied. These children participated in a\nprevious infant feeding study where 9 children received their mother's\nmilk and 11 children received formula during the neonatal period.6\nAs body weight is the major predictor in bone mineralization, a\nconvenience sample of 15 children who were born at term gestation\nand whose body weight for age was within 2 kg of the preterm\nchildren was selected and served as the control group for the bone\nmineral evaluation. All children were of appropriate size for\ngestational age at birth. Informed consent with Health Insurance\nPortability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) authorization was obtained\nfrom the parents of all children who participated in this study. The\nprotocol was approved by the University's Institute Review Board.\nProcedure\nAll children were evaluated at the University of Utah Medical\nCenter. All children had their weights and heights measured by\nstandard methods. Weights were measured using an electronic\nscale that was certified annually. Height was determined using a\nfootboard. A medical history was completed that included a record\nof any fracture and chronic use of any medication such as loop\ndiuretics and steroids. The hospital record of the children born\nprematurely was reviewed for medications that might affect bone\nmineralization. A 3-day dietary record and food frequency\nCorrespondence: Dr GM Chan, Department of Pediatrics, 2N106, University of Utah Health\nE-mail: gchan@hsc.utah.edu\nwww.nature.com/jp\nquestionnaire were collected and analyzed by our dietitian. The\nbone mineral measurements were also recorded.\nTo assess growth, the children who were born prematurely were\ncompared with the weight and height database from the 1996\nNational Center for Health Statistics National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Surveys (NHANES) III controlling for age, gender and\nThe bone mineral status was evaluated blindly at two sites,\nlumbar spine and distal third radius bone. The lumbar spines of L2\nthrough L4 were studied using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry\n(XR-26, Norland Corporation, Fort Atkinson, WI, USA), whereas the\ndistal radius bone mineral content was analyzed by single-photon\nabsorptiometry (Lunar Radiation Corporation, Madison, WI, USA)\nThe measurement of the radius and lumbar spine bone mineral by\nabsorptiometry method is accurate (less than 2% error) and precise\n(less than 2%).

Intergroup differences between\nmeasures of bone mineral content and density were analyzed\nby independent sample t-test and between categorical variables,\nby w2 test. Simple linear regression was used to determine any\nrelation between variables. Differences and relationships were\nconsidered significant if P<0.05.\nPreterm vs NHANES III controls. NHANES III weight and height\ndata for males and females aged 5 to 9.99 years of age were\nimported into a SYSTAT11 plotting and statistical analysis. The\nweight, height and body mass index of all children were plotted\non gender-specific cross-sectional growth charts derived from 10,\n50 and 90 percentile values provided by NCHS on the internet\n(http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/about/major/nhanes/growthcharts/\ndatafiles.htm).8 Log-likelihood w2 goodness-of-fit (G2) analyses\nwere conducted where the null hypothesis was 50% of the preterm\nwas considered as the level of statistical significance.\nResults\nSubjects\nAll children were healthy and free from any chronic diseases.\nAll children were Caucasian and were growing appropriately.\nThe gender distribution between the two groups was similar with\neight males in the preterm group and six males in the term group.\nNo medications (that is, steroids or diuretics) were used in either\ngroup.

However, the\nlumbar bone mineral content and density were lower in the\nbetween dietary intakes and bone mineral measurements. Three of\nthe preterm children had a history of fracture, whereas none of the\nterm children reported any fractures. All the fractures were located\non the forearm after an accidental fall and occurred when the\nchildren were about 6 years of age. For the children born\nprematurely, there were no differences in bone mineralization\nbetween those who had received human milk or formula during\nthe neonatal period (Table 3).\nDiscussion\nFrom our study, children who were born prematurely with\nvery-low-birth-weights had significantly lower body weight and\nbody mass index, and females were shorter in height compared\nwith a national reference derived from NHANES III.

The issue\nwhether the bone mineralization problems of preterm infants\ncontinue has been evaluated at different ages and by measuring\ndifferent bone sites. During the first year of life, several\ninvestigators report that the forearm bone mass of preterm infants\nis lower than that of term infants,2,17,18 but the preterm child\nmay resolve this difference in bone mineralization by 2 years of\nage.18\u00ad20 However, another study of adolescents with a mean\nage of 15 years who were born at extremely low birth weight\n<1000 g reports significantly lower total body mineral content\nbut not density compared with control adolescents.13 Total bone\nmineral content is the measurement of the weight of hydroxapatite\nor calcium whereas bone density is the bone mineral content\ndivided by the area. In the prematurely born males aged 4 to\n16 years, the bone mineral content of the forearm was less than in\ncontrol term males. But by statistically adjusting for weight and\nheight, this difference in the bone mineral content became less\nsignificant.21 In another study of older adolescents born\nprematurely and weighing less than 1500 g, their whole-body\nbone mineral content was lower than those born at term\ngestation, but again after adjusting for the smaller body size,\nthe bone mineralization was appropriate.22 In our study, the\ncomparison group was children who were born at term\ngestation and matched by body weight to the preterm children\nat the time of the study. From our analyses, the bone\nmineralization in the preterm children was low in the lumbar\nspine compared with term children. The lumbar bones represent\nmainly trabecular bones that are more metabolically active\nthan cortical or compact bones. Trabecular bone responds to\nvitamin D and parathyroid hormone activity.23 Our forearm\nmeasurements, which contain a mixture of both trabecular\nand compact bones, showed a tendency for lower bone mineral\ncontent in the preterm children.\nOur findings of low lumbar spine mineralization in preterm\nchildren are different from those reported in two Japanese\nstudies.24,25 In the first study, 40 preterm infants' lumbar spine\nbone mineral densities were compared with term infants. During\nthe first several months of life, the lumbar bone mineral density\nwas considerably lower than that of term infants.23 In a follow-up\nstudy from the same group, 21 preterm children aged 3 to 4 years\nwere found to have normal bone mineral content and densities in\nlumbar spinal bones.25 However, only two preterm children with\nlow gestational ages were followed for 8 to 12 months, and their\nlumbar spinal bone mineral densities were still lower than those of\nterm children. Unfortunately, dietary intakes of calcium, phosphate\nand vitamin D were not reported in this study. However, these\nsubjects had higher birth weights than our subjects. The Japanese\nmean birth weight was 1764 g, whereas our subject's mean birth\nThe cause of the low bone mineralization in the preterm\nchildren remains uncertain. The problem might be due to the\nyoung prematurity (less than 1500 g birth weight) of the children\nin our study. Other investigators believe that the bone mineral\nstatus in preterm children is caused by dietary programing during\nan early critical period.16,26 During the neonatal period, preterm\ninfants probably ingested lower amounts of nutrients compared\nwith term infants. Although the childhood dietary calcium intake\nwas similar between the two groups, children born prematurely\nmight require higher intakes to achieve their peak bone mass. In\nour study, preterm children suffered three fractures compared with\nnone in the term group. It is a matter of concern that the preterm\nchildren's forearm bone mineral status tend to be lower than that\nof term children. Children with low bone mineralization from\ninadequate dietary calcium and phosphate intakes are susceptible\nIn summary, children who were born prematurely with birth\nweights less than 1500 g have decreased growth and lower lumbar\nspinal bone mineral content and density relative to term-matched\ncontrols at 5 to 9 years of age.\nReferences\n1 Steichen JJ, Gratton TL, Tsang RC.
