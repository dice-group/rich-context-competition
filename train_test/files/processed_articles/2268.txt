Higher education scholars have written\nextensively about the rise of occupational-professional programs (Brint et al. 2005; Turner\nand Bowen 1990), the responsiveness of universities to market signals and donor prefer-\nences in the development of new business and technology fields (see, e.g., Engell and\nand the response of universities to the changing demographic characteristics of students\nand faculty as an influence on the development of new ``culture and identity'' fields, such\nas ethnic studies and women's studies (see, e.g., Boxer 1998; Frank et al. 1994; Rojas\nIn this paper, we examine the institutionalization of high-growth fields in US four-year\ncolleges and universities during the period, 1970\u00ad2006.

Murphy\nUniversity of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA\ninstitutional locations of early adopters of these fields. From a sociological perspective, we\nbelieve early adopters are more important than the first innovators of new fields. Inno-\nvations that do not penetrate beyond a few schools are destined to fail, except perhaps as\nvery small niche cultures. Only when a field has a foothold in a broader stratum of\ninstitutions is its future in academe relatively secure. The characteristics of early adopting\ninstitutions are therefore important for understanding how the structure of academically\nlegitimated knowledge changes over time. Yet the existing literature on academic change\nhas not paid close attention to the types of institutions that are early adopters of new fields.\nWe will show that the mechanisms by which new fields diffuse within the US system\nhave much to do with competition effects within geographical contexts and with the\ndominant role played by large, high-enrollment institutions that have the capacity to staff\nnew fields and to attract students to them. Special theories about status dynamics are\nnecessary, however, to fill out the analysis of diffusion of new arts and sciences fields.\nThese fields are fostered particularly by wealthier institutions with long traditions in the\narts and sciences and, in the case of socially incorporative fields (such as women's studies\nand ethnic studies), also by public sector institutions.\nAnalytical perspectives on early adoptors\nOur study is organized as a comparison of the explanatory power of four analytical per-\nspectives. We develop hypotheses drawn from the literatures on organizational ecology,\ninter-institutional stratification, demographic composition, and historical traditions. We do\nnot investigate all prominent perspectives on organizational change. With the exception of\ntwo fields (computer/information science and communications), those discussed in this\npaper show only partial diffusion through the system of US higher education during the\nperiod of our study. Consequently, neo-institutional theory, which emphasizes the wide-\nspread diffusion of dominant models through isomorphic processes (DiMaggio and Powell\n1983), has little applicability to the topic of our analysis (cf. Morphew and Huisman 2002).\nOrganizational ecology\nOrganizational ecology explanations are based on the premise that the behavior of indi-\nvidual organizations is shaped by opportunities and constraints in their environment, and\nby the differential capacities of individual organizations to exploit opportunities and sur-\nvive challenges (Hannan and Freeman 1989). For purposes of our analyses, we will treat\necological niches as the geographical areas in which organizations compete.\nOne key insight of organizational ecology is that niches have ``carrying capacities'' that\nplace upper limits on the density (i.e. number of) organizations that can be sustained\n(Carroll and Hannan 2000: 222\u00ad7). For this reason, larger places have the potential to\nsupport more activities. Adoption rates, then, should be higher in geographical areas with\nlarger populations, all else being equal. A second insight is that founding (and failure) rates\nof organizations (or programs) are density dependent. When there are very few other\norganizations in a niche that display a feature, adoption rates are likely to be low because\norganizations face great uncertainty about whether carrying capacity for a program exists.\nThe success of early adopters, however, demonstrates that carrying capacity is present in\nthe niche, and legitimates offering a competitive program. Hence, rate of new adoption\nshould be a positive function of the number of organizations that have already founded a\nprogram. As the number of institutions in a niche offering a program increases toward the\ncarrying capacity, competition for students and other resources grows, increasing barriers\nto entry and decreasing expected marginal returns to offering the program. This dual\ndynamic, legitimation and competition, suggests that the probability that an institution adds\na program will be a quadratic function of the density of that program in its niche--\nincreasing with density and decreasing with density squared (Carroll and Hannan 2000:\nThe capacity of an organization to exploit new niche space, or to succeed despite\ncompetition in a crowded one, can be a function of individual organizational characteristics\nas well as the density of competing organizations. For higher education institutions, a\nprimary adaptive characteristic of interest is size (Blau 1994, Chap. 3). From an ecological\nperspective, size is an indicator both of organizational carrying capacity and potential\nstudent demand for new fields. Larger organizations have the capacity to hire and organize\nfaculty in ways that allow for the adoption of new fields and a heightened opportunity to\ngenerate effective demand for courses and majors from their larger student bodies. For\nthese reasons, we expect that larger institutions will be more likely to adopt new programs.\nAssuming the ceteris paribus condition in these and all succeeding hypotheses, we test\nthe following hypotheses:\nH-1 Institutions located in larger population areas will be more likely to be early adopters\nof new fields.\nH-2 Institutions located in geographical areas in which a low proportion of institutions\nhave adopted a new field will be more likely to adopt the field.\nH-3 Institutions located in geographical areas in which a high proportion of institutions\nhave adopted a new field will be less likely to adopt the field.\nH-4 Larger institutions will be more likely to adopt new fields.\nInter-institutional stratification\nSince Veblen (1899), sociologists and economists have recognized a distinction between\nluxury and non-luxury goods. Social scientists have translated this distinction into\nexpectations about educational stratification. For Collins (1977, 2000), lower-status\ninstitutions tend to focus on practical training in courses of study closely connected to jobs\nand occupations, while higher-status institutions tend to focus on esoteric fields of study\ndistant from the labor market, the knowledge of which is embodied in complex linguistic\ncodes and modes of appreciation that require many years of study to understand and are\nmore likely to be found in families endowed with high levels of cultural capital (see also\nBourdieu 1984, 1988). Drawing on this work, we expect financially less secure and socially\nless elite higher education institutions to be more likely to adopt new occupational-pro-\nfessional fields, while financially more secure and socially more elite institutions will be\nmore likely to adopt new fields in the liberal arts and basic science disciplines.\nTwo primary indicators of institutional status in US higher education are wealth and\nselectivity. Wealthy institutions have large endowments and high operating budgets per\nstudent to support their educational and co-curricular missions. Selective institutions admit\nonly the most qualified of the many thousands of students who apply for admissions each\nyear. They are, in this respect, exclusive clubs to which the great majority of applicants\nwill not be admitted (Frank 1999; Karabel 2005) and consequently we expect them to focus\nto a greater degree on status fields than practical fields. Moreover, students attending high-\nstatus institutions are likely to have the resources and opportunities to delay training for\ntheir future jobs and occupations until graduate school, freeing them to study the liberal\nHighest degree offered is another, more functional, source of status differentiation.\nDoctoral-granting institutions play different roles and gain higher prestige in the academic\nsystem than masters' and baccalaureate granting institutions, because, in addition to their\nundergraduate teaching responsibilities, their faculties are the producers of new knowledge\nand are active in the production of the next generation of scholars and scientists. Doctoral-\ngranting universities have shown a particularly strong historical emphasis on fields con-\nDiamond 1997). We expect doctoral-granting research universities to be associated with\nearly adoption of new science and technology fields, and bachelor's degree granting\ninstitutions to be more likely to focus on well-established fields of study.\nWe test the following hypotheses:\nH-5 Lower-status institutions will be more likely to adopt new occupational-professional\nfields.\nH-6 Higher-status institutions will be more likely to adopt new liberal arts and basic\nscience fields.\nH-7 Doctoral-granting institutions will be more likely to adopt new science and tech-\nnology fields.\nDemographic composition\nTwo arguments have been made about demographic composition as a source of curricular\nchange. The first has focused on the elective affinity between the life experiences of\nstudents from non-traditional groups and the rise of new curricula associated with those life\nexperiences. This approach has linked the life experiences of lower SES students to\npreferences for more practical, job-relevant curricula (see, e.g., Cross 1971; Trow 1974)\nand the life experiences of female students to preferences for study in the arts, social\nservices, and other historically sex-segregated fields (Jacobs 1996). A second argument is\nbased on accommodation to political pressures for representation. Recent literature has\npointed to the tendency of administrators to accommodate to the pressures of social\nmovement organizations and changing faculty values by offering new curricula attuned to\nthe interests of mobilized groups and progressive-minded faculty members (Boxer 1998;\nIn higher education, racial-ethnic minorities and women are two groups of special\ninterest. Since 1970, their numbers have grown dramatically as a proportion of under-\ngraduate students enrolled in higher education institutions (US Department of Education,\nNational Center for Education Statistics 2008: Table 226). Because members of racial-\nethnic minorities more often come from immigrant and working class backgrounds, we\nexpect that higher proportions of these students will be associated with early adoption of\nnew occupational-professional fields, Because women have historically pursued (and been\nlimited to) sex-typed occupations, we expect that higher proportions of women students\nwill be associated with early adoption of sex-segregated fields in which women are more\nnumerous (such as those in the arts and social services) and perhaps also reduced support\nfor traditionally male fields (such as those in engineering and physical sciences). Following\nthe second argument, we expect higher proportions of women and minorities to be asso-\nciated with the adoption of women's studies and ethnic studies, respectively.\nWe test the following hypotheses:\nH-8 Institutions enrolling higher proportions of minority students will be associated with\nearly adoption of new occupational-professional fields.\nH-9 Institutions enrolling higher proportions of female students will be associated with\nearly adoption of historically female-dominated fields.\nH-10 Institutions enrolling higher proportions of female students will be associated with\nearly adoption of women's studies.\nH-11 Institutions enrolling higher proportions of under-represented minority students\nwill be associated with early adoption of ethnic studies.\nHistorical traditions\nHistorical traditions are often cited as forces encouraging the reproduction of existing\nstructures and as value-based restraints on change. Sociologists have emphasized the\nimportance of values embedded in leaders (Selznick 1957), organizational sagas (Clark\nreproduction.\nTwo historical traditions are particularly important in US higher education. Liberal\narts colleges and universities have been closely connected to the training of elites from\nthe time of the colonial colleges (Baltzell 1964; Horowitz 1987). Today, not all insti-\ntutions with commitments to the liberal arts and basic sciences are high-status; instead,\nsmall religiously-affiliated colleges are among the most likely to maintain these com-\nmitments (Brint et al. 2009). We expect that institutions with historical commitments to\nthe liberal arts and basic sciences model will be more likely to welcome new arts and\nsciences fields.\nPublic universities in the land-grant tradition have had the opposite orientation from\nliberal arts colleges; they were constituted to provide practical training for men and women\nin agricultural and industrial occupations and were intended to be open to students from all\nsocial strata (Nevins 1962). Over time, the land grant tradition has become generalized\nthroughout the public sector insofar as public universities present themselves as addressing\nthe needs of the state and the economy for educated labor (Brint 2007; Geiger and Sa\n2008). We consequently expect that public universities, as compared to private institutions,\nwill be particularly receptive to new occupational-professional fields, and particularly\nreceptive to new science and technology fields.\nWhile historical traditions predispose institutions to maintain value commitments,\nbrand-new institutions have no such loyalties. Following Stinchcombe (1965), we expect\nthat absence of historical traditions will predispose institutions born after the beginning\ndate of the time series to be more receptive to the high-growth fields of the era.\nWe test the following hypotheses:\nH-12 Institutions historically committed to the liberal arts and sciences tradition will be\nassociated with early adoption of new fields in the arts and sciences.\nH-13 Public control will be associated with early adoption of new occupational-pro-\nfessional fields, and particularly with early adoption of new science and technology fields.\nH-14 Institutions born during the period of the study will be associated with early\nadoption of new fields.\nData and methods\nStudy population\nWe examined the adoption of fields in the core institutions in the US higher education\nsystem. We define ``core institutions'' as 4-year colleges and universities which offer a\nrange of baccalaureate degrees, rather than degrees in only a small set of related programs.\nWe therefore do not include specialized institutions, such as art schools, business colleges\nand seminaries. We also do not include for-profit institutions. The number of institutions in\nto 1465, while the number of the baccalaureate degrees core institutions awarded annually\nDefining established and emerging growth fields\nWe examine the characteristics of institutions that offered undergraduate degrees in two\ntypes of high-growth fields during the period: (1) those that had become established by the\nend of the period and (2) those that had not yet become established, but had experienced\ncomparable levels of growth. We refer to these as newly established and emerging fields,\nrespectively.\nWe are interested in fields that demonstrated significant growth during our period of\nobservation and, at the same, diffused relatively widely during the period. We define newly\nestablished fields as those that were offered by 20 percent or fewer institutions in\npercent threshold a good marker that a field has ``arrived'' in academe, or, as some would\nsay, reached the ``take-off'' point to sustainability (Rostow 1963). We define emerging\nfields as those that grew to include at least 10 percent more institutions during the study\nperiod, but continued to be offered at fewer than 20 percent of institutions by the last year\nin the study. We examine emerging fields because they showed the same minimal levels of\ngrowth during the period and, although not yet fully established, show sufficient growth to\nsuggest that they may become established fields of the future.\nOur field categorizations are based on HEGIS/IPEDS degree files, coded at 5 year\nHigher Education General Information Survey (HEGIS) during the first two panel years.\nThis data was collected in the Integrated Post-Secondary Educational Data System\n(IPEDS) in the last six panel years. From the initial HEGIS coding scheme, which existed\nperiod, the number of fields represented at the bachelor's level grew from 319 to 935.\nThese changes required extensive work to align fields between the five categorizing\nschemes. We aggregated categories from later periods to match as closely as possible those\nused in earlier periods, using HEGIS and IPEDS crosswalks.1 In addition, we aggregated\n1 During the early years of our time series, for example, multi-disciplinary studies were exclusively focused\non engineering specialties. This category expanded in later years of the series, but the coding in earlier years\nprevents direct comparisons. We were therefore unable to analyze the institutional locations of this 15th\nhigh-growth field, multi-/interdisciplinary studies, due to the federal government's exclusive classification\nof engineering subspecialties as interdisciplinary during the first years of the series.\nclosely connected fields so as to improve the statistical power of our analyses. For\nexample, in the earlier period, all forms of sales and marketing were treated as an\nundifferentiated field. By the end of the period, a wide range of marketing degrees had\nbeen defined. We consequently aggregated all marketing fields (e.g., fashion marketing,\ntravel and tourism marketing, automobile marketing, and marketing, general) to form a\nsingle ``marketing'' category.2\nDependent variables\nWe are interested in defining the types of institutions that provide the organizational base\nfor new academic fields. Our unit of analysis is consequently the institution. We focus on\ndefining the characteristics of early adopters of newly-established fields and adopters of\nemerging fields, and we use logistic regression and correspondence analysis to distinguish\nthe characteristics of early adopters from those of late and/or non-adopters.3\nWe define early adopters as the first 20 percent of institutions (\u00b12 percent) to offer\ndegrees in the field. We measure early adoption from the date at which this 20 percent\nthreshold was reached. The early adoption date, therefore, varies from field to field, as\nindicated in Table 1. We chose the 20 percent threshold partially on practical grounds.\nDuring our panel years, we were able to define a 20 percent threshold (\u00b12 percent) for all\nnewly-established fields. We were not able to define a lower or higher threshold as pre-\ncisely. Statistical and conceptual issues also influenced our choice of threshold. Statisti-\ncally, the 20 percent threshold is preferable to lower thresholds because it allows for more\nrobust analysis with lower standard errors around parameter estimates.4 Conceptually,\nhigher thresholds, such as 25 percent, seemed to us to define groups of institutions larger\nthan that implied by the term ``early adopters.''\nFor the newly-established fields, we compare the characteristics of early adopters to\nthose of late and non-adopters, using the threshold year as the reference point. We examine\nthe explanatory power of variables linked to each of the four interpretive frameworks--\norganizational ecology, inter-institutional stratification, demographic composition, and\nhistorical traditions--based on the hypotheses stated above. All measurements are taken at\nthe date the field reached 20 percent diffusion. For emerging fields, we focus on whether or\nexplanatory power of variables linked to each of the four interpretive frameworks.\nTable 1 provides an overview of 14 newly established5 (panel A) and six emerging (panel\nB) fields during the period of our study.\n2 A table of correspondence is available on request.\n3 We do not pool the data or use general estimating equations to predict diffusion patterns, because we are\nnot interested in explaining diffusion curves. The speed of diffusion is a separate topic. The fields in this\nstudy include a few that diffused rapidly (e.g. computer/information science and communications) during\nthe period and a few that showed only a slow rise to the 20 percent threshold or just beyond (e.g. applied\ndesign and international relations).\n4 Findings for emerging fields (see below) suggest that the same general pattern of organizational effects\nwould have emerged had we adopted a 15 percent threshold for the newly-established fields.\n5 Communications is a borderline case. It had been adopted by just over 20 percent of institutions in\n1970\u00ad1971. We include it because it is very close to our threshold and is one of the fastest-growing fields\nduring the period.\nNine of the 14 newly-established fields during the period were occupational-profes-\nsional; they are typically oriented to training students for employment in occupations.6 In\norder of their rates of institutionalization during the period, these fields were: computer/\ninformation science, parks and recreation, criminal justice, marketing, social work, man-\nagement information systems, nursing, applied design, and banking and finance. State-\nbased and social service fields (criminal justice, social work, nursing, and parks and\nrecreation) were as numerous as business and technology fields (computer science, mar-\nketing, management information systems, and banking/finance). We also see the influence\nof gender in these fields. Three of the fields (nursing, social work, and applied design) have\nbeen female-dominated fields.\nArts and sciences fields, while less numerous, were not entirely absent. Five of the 14\nwere arts and sciences fields--that is, they expose students to a basic field of knowledge.\nIn order of their rates of institutionalization during the period, these fields were\n% Schools\nSchools % of\nSchools\nSchools % of\nSchools\n6 Our classification of arts and sciences versus occupational-professional fields is based on the typology\ncommunications,7 general studies, environmental science, cell and molecular biology, and\ninternational relations. General studies is a special case; although nominally arts and\nsciences, it has become used by colleges and universities as a multi-option ``catch-all''\nmajor, often taken by students who struggle to succeed in traditional majors.\nIn addition, four of the six emerging fields were occupational-professional. In order of\ntheir rates of institutionalization, these were: international business, computer engineering,\nhealth administration, and public policy/public administration. Here too state-based fields\n(health administration and public policy/public administration) were as numerous as business\nor technology fields (international business and computer engineering). Two new culture and\nidentity fields (women's studies and ethnic studies) were among the emerging fields.\nEach of the occupational-professional fields creates a perceived pathway into primary\nsector occupations, whether in business, the state, or the health care system. The repre-\nsentation of arts and sciences fields demonstrates the continued relevance of the idea that,\nas culture producing institutions, colleges and universities have some autonomy from state\nand economy, and the substance of these fields helps to delineate the contemporary content\nand meaning of the phrase ``some autonomy.'' Some high-growth arts and sciences fields\nhave at least distant links to media or technology industries (communications, environ-\nmental science, cell and molecular biology); others to social movement organizations and\ndemographic change (environmental studies again, as well as women's and ethnic studies);\nand still others to processes of globalization (international relations).\nIndependent variables\nFor purposes of predicting the locations of early adopters of newly-established and\nemerging fields, we measured four organizational ecology variables. Population is a\nmeasure of the carrying capacity of the institution's immediate geographical region. The\nterm ``core based statistical area'' (CBSA) became effective in 2000 and refers collectively\nto metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas (US Department of Education, National\nCenter for Education Statistics 2009). We use CBSAs to define boundaries of the geo-\ngraphical space in which higher education organizations compete. We measured popula-\ntion retrospectively from the population of counties in the CBSA in which the organization\nresided. Two variables measure the coverage of a field within the geographical space\ndefined by CBSAs. Adopting in Region is a measure of the number of higher education\ninstitutions within the CBSA that had adopted the field by its early adoption date (or, in the\ncase of emerging fields, by the last year in the time series). We coded the number of\ninstitutions in each CBSA by locating institutions within counties covered by CBSAs. We\ncoded the number of institutions adopting a program based on IPEDS data on degrees\nawarded in our target fields. Adopting in Region Squared is a measure of saturation. If most\ninstitutions within the organization's geographical frame have already adopted a field, the\norganization may not experience sufficient niche space to adopt. Enrollment is a measure\nof an organization's carrying capacity and potential demand for new fields. We measured\nsize as total headcount enrollment from HEGIS/IPEDS enrollment data.\nWe measured four inter-institutional stratification variables corresponding to dimen-\nsions of hierarchical differentiation within the structure of US four-year colleges and\n7 Although some communications curricula provide practical training for technical positions in the mass\nmedia industries, communications is primarily a liberal arts discipline in which most courses focus on\nrhetoric, communications practices in different institutional settings and cultures, public opinion, and the\norganization and consequences of mass media industries (Bertelsen and Goodboy 2009; Wardrope 1999).\nuniversities. Operating budget per student is a measure of organizational wealth. It is\ncomputed from HEGIS/IPEDS financial data, divided by headcount enrollment.8 We\nremoved hospitals and independent operations from operating expenditures so as to focus\non expenditures more closely connected to the quality of the undergraduate experience.9\nSelectivity is measured from the Barron's admissions selector index. Barron's index is\nbased on acceptance rates for freshmen applicants, as well as freshman students' high\nschool ranks, grade point averages, and median SAT/ACT scores. The most competitive\ninstitutions have the lowest acceptance rates. Barron's applies only qualitative labels to its\nrankings, ranging from ``most competitive'' to ``non-competitive.'' We assigned numeric\nvalues to these labels for the purpose of analysis, with one denoting the least selective and\nsix denoting the most selective institutions.10 Doctoral granting is a measure of position\nwithin the functional hierarchy of higher education institutions. Doctoral granting insti-\ntutions are defined as institutions awarding at least 30 doctoral degrees in a year. The 30\ndoctorate cutoff is adapted from Snyder and Hoffman's (2005) approach to generalizing\nthe Carnegie Classification.11 Masters' granting institutions are defined as institutions\nawarding at least 30 masters degrees in a year and serve as the reference category. Bac-\ncalaureate granting institutions comprise the remaining institutions. They offer fewer than\n30 masters degrees a year, again following Snyder and Hoffman (2005).\nWe measured two demographic characteristics of student bodies from HEGIS/IPEDS\nenrollment data. Percent minority is a continuous variable measured as non-white students\nas a proportion of total enrollment. Percent female is a continuous variable measured as\nwomen students as a proportion of total enrollment.12 We included as a control variable\nPercent international, a continuous variable measured as proportion of international stu-\ndents to total enrollment. We assumed that this variable might show net significant\nassociations with early adopters of international fields.\nWe measured three variables related to historical traditions.

This is a continuous variable coded from HEGIS/IPEDS degree\ndata measured as the proportion of total degrees awarded in the arts and sciences, as\nopposed to occupational-professional fields, in the first year of our time series. We identify\n8 Based on consultation with the IPEDS lead analyst of financial data, Dr. Craig Bowen, we determined that\nvalid comparisons could be made following the changes in accounting rules for private universities in 1997.\nFor total expenses, lines E19 (FASB reporters) and C19 (for GASB reporters) are comparable (Bowen,\npersonal communication).\n9 Market value of endowment is another commonly used measure of wealth. Previous work (reference\nmasked) indicates that operating budget/student and market value of endowment are highly correlated\n(above r = .8). Moreover, considerably more missing data exists on market value of endowment than on\noperating budget/student.\n11 The Carnegie Classification itself changed six times during the period of the study. Highest degree\nawarded has been a consistent element of the Carnegie Classification, but other elements have varied\nconsiderably across classification years. Although we find several of these classifications more informative\nthan highest degree awarded, we were unable to reproduce what we consider the best of the classifications,\nCarnegie 1994, for earlier or later years in the series.\n12 In separate analyses, we broke out historically black colleges and universities and all-women's colleges.\nModel efficiency, as measured by the Bayesian Information Criterion, was lower in the large majority of\ncases (22 of 26), and we consequently report models without these variables. The results of these analyses\nare available on request.\ninstitutions awarding high proportions of degrees in arts and sciences as historically\nconnected to the liberal arts tradition. Public is a categorical variable measuring form of\ncontrol and coded from HEGIS/IPEDS institutional characteristics. Emerged identifies\ninstitutions born after the beginning of the period of our study. This variable measures\nabsence, rather than presence, of historical traditions. The variable is coded by eliminating\ndegree-granting institutions appearing at the beginning of the period from those appearing\nat the end of the period. We included the variable Died as a control variable. These\ninstitutions appeared in HEGIS/IPEDS at the beginning of the time series, but no longer\nappeared by the end of the period.13 Descriptive statistics on the independent variables in\nthis analysis are provided in ``Appendix A''.\nMethods\nOur first analysis is based on logistic regression, where the dependent variable is categorical\nand ``1'' is defined as an early adopting institution, or, in the case of emerging fields, an\never-adopting institution. We conducted these logistic regressions on each of the 20 fields.\nWe used correspondence analysis to complement the results of the logistic regressions.\nCorrespondence analysis is a method of factoring variables and displaying them in a\nproperty space which maps their association in two or more dimensions (Clausen 1998).\nRather than examining patterns of predictors across fields, this analysis forces predictors to\nalign with particular fields, thereby indicating particularly strong affinities between insti-\ntutional characteristics and academic fields.14\nFor the correspondence analysis, we reran logistic regressions to isolate only institu-\ntional characteristics for the set of institutions that existed throughout the period of the\nstudy. This approach avoids the difficulties of relating intrinsically relational (Adopting in\nRegion and Adopting in Region Squared) and extra-institutional data (Population) to the\ncorrespondence between types of institutions and types of fields. The resulting visual\nrepresentations provide a more sharply focused map of the correspondence of types of\ninstitutions and types of fields in two-dimensional space.\nResults\nWe discuss results from the regression analyses first, followed by results from the corre-\nspondence analysis. Regression results for occupational-professional fields were different,\nin important respects, from results for arts and sciences fields. We therefore report results\nfor occupational-professional fields in Table 2 and arts and sciences fields in Table 3.\n13 Reliance on IPEDS data may result in a small amount of measurement error in the emerged and died\nvariables. Institutions may be reclassified for technical reasons as entirely new institutions by IPEDS if they\nare continuing under a different name or governing authority or have begun to admit new populations of\nstudents. Similarly, institutions may be treated as defunct because they did not, for whatever reason, report\ndata to IPEDS in the final panel year. An independent examination of emerged and died institutions using\nInternet resources identified several ambiguous cases.\n14 In the analysis, we normalized the rows (predictors) and columns (fields) separately, and we found the\nsingular values and eigenvalues of the matrix. We then scored and plotted the predictor variables and the\nfields on the first two singular values or eigenvectors. The analysis included both continuous and categorical\nvariables. The method used for scaling gives approximately equal weight to the variation across predictor\nvariables and to the variation across fields. Correspondence analyses were computed with UCINET 6.162\ndiscussion of this approach and an alternative to it, see Faust (2005).\nTable 2 Logistic regressions of ocupational-professional fields\nIndependent\nvariable\nNewly established fields Emerging fields\nComp.\nSci.\nMgmnt.\nInfo.\nFinance Mrktg.

Died perfectly predicted the\nfailure of to adopt cell biology\nResults from the regression analyses\nEcological variables were strongly associated with early adoption across all 20 fields.\nRelatively large numbers of adopting institutions within the geographical area defined by\nthe CBSA were associated with consistent and strong odds of adopting new fields, whether\noccupational-professional or arts and sciences. The squared term was also strongly asso-\nciated with lower levels of adoption, indicating that within CBSAs when niche space is\nfilled beyond a certain point no further adoption of fields is likely. Equally important,\nlarger enrollment institutions were consistently and strongly associated with adoption of\nnew fields, both in occupational-professional and arts and sciences fields. These results\nindicate that larger institutions have the carrying capacity to support new fields and may\nhave the incentive as well to support them to cater to student (or potential student) interest\non campus. Population was the only ecological variable that failed to show strong asso-\nciations with the adoption of new fields. Indeed, larger population areas were frequently\nassociated with lower probabilities of adoption, controlling for other significant covariates\nin the model. This suggests that the state of competition of organizations within a geo-\ngraphic area is the key to change, rather than the population of the area or even the sheer\nnumber of organizations competing in the area.\nInstitutional wealth, as measured by operating budget/student, showed the expected net\nassociations with high-growth arts and sciences fields (other than international relations\nand the special case of general studies); it also showed significant negative net associations\nwith several occupational-professional fields, particularly with new business fields.\nWealthy institutions were very likely to adopt socially incorporative new culture and\nidentity fields (ethnic studies and women's studies). These results indicate that institutional\nwealth is associated, as predicted, with a focus on status fields, and less often with a focus\non practical, job-related fields. Similarly, as hypothesized, institutions with high levels of\ncommitment to arts and sciences in 1970 were more likely to be early adopters of most new\narts and sciences fields. They were also less likely to be adopters of new occupational-\nprofessional fields. We found little support, however, for selectivity as an influence on the\nadoption of arts and sciences fields. Instead, we found some evidence for it as a barrier to\nthe adoption of new occupational-professional fields.\nAs hypothesized, baccalaureate-granting institutions were averse to adopting new fields.\nHowever, counter to our hypothesis, doctoral granting institutions were not consistently\nmore likely to adopt new science and technology fields and instead were more likely to\nadopt new business fields. Nor were public institutions consistently more likely to adopt\nnew science and technology fields, as we expected based on their land-grant origins.\nInstead, they were more likely to adopt the emerging culture and identity fields of women's\nand ethnic studies, indicating a special relationship between contemporary public sector\ninstitutions and historically marginalized population groups.\nAs hypothesized, institutions enrolling high proportions of women were more likely to\nadopt fields related to women's traditional occupational locations. Institutions enrolling\nhigh proportions of women also showed a tendency to avoid some technical fields, notably\ncomputer engineering. However, institutions enrolling higher proportions of minority\nstudents were less likely to adopt new occupational-professional fields, rather than more\nlikely to do so. It is possible that these institutions seek the legitimacy and prestige of long-\nestablished fields, rather than adopting the jobs-oriented practical approach we\nhypothesized.\nFinally, institutions born during the study period showed no preference for the high-\ngrowth academic fields of the period.\nThus, we found consistent and strong support for hypotheses 2\u00ad4 (density dependence\nand size as influences on the early adoption of all new fields). We also found substantial\nsupport for hypotheses 5\u00ad6 (status effects on the early adoption of new arts and sciences\nfields), hypotheses 9\u00ad11 (proportion of women as an influence on the early adoption of\nfemale-dominated fields and the relation between demographic categories and the early\nadoption of women's and ethnic studies), as well as hypothesis 12 (arts and sciences\ntradition as an influence on the early adoption of new arts and sciences fields).\nWe found little or no support for the other hypotheses.\nResults from the correspondence analysis\nThe correspondence analysis showed a good fit in two dimensions, with the first two\ndimensions accounting for 77 percent of the variance and the third dimension adding little.\nAs depicted in Fig. 1, one dimension in the correspondence analysis defined what we\ncan conceive of as a ``social change'' vs. ``corporate business'' division linked to public and\nprivate institutions, respectively. Thus, the left-right axis in the correspondence analysis\nshowed distinct affinities between public institutions and what we might term ``social\nmovement fields'' (ethnic studies, women's studies, and environmental studies).

Notes: Two factors account\nfor 77% of the rescaled variance\nshowed affinities between private institutions and several higher-income business and\ntechnology fields (finance, management information systems, marketing, international\nbusiness, health administration, and computer engineering). The second dimension defined\nwhat we can conceive of as a ``low-technology'' vs. ``high-technology'' division linked\nmost closely to doctoral and baccalaureate-granting institutions, respectively. Thus, the\nupper right sector showed a clustering of computer engineering, finance, and health\nadministration closely associated with doctoral granting institutions, and the lower left\nsector showed a clustering of criminology, general studies, environmental studies, and\nparks and recreation most closely associated with baccalaureate granting institutions.\nDiscussion\nThe primary contribution of this paper has been to test hypotheses drawn from four\nperspectives on the dynamics of organizational change in higher education. The separate\ncross-sectional portraits we develop of early adopters, when examined together, open a\nwindow onto locations in the system that are receptive to new fields and also reveal some\nimportant patterns through which new fields diffuse in the system.\nThe diffusion of new fields is rarely system-wide. Among 14 newly established fields,\nonly two (computer/information science and communications) diffused to even half of 4-\nyear colleges and universities by 2005\u00ad2006. Given this reality of partial and limited\ndiffusion, the questions social scientists ask about academic change should be mainly about\nwhich types of institutions will be most receptive to new fields--and why?\nWe can answer these questions by focusing on consistent and strong net associations in\nthe data, as reported in Tables 2 and 3. One part of the answer to these questions is that\nlarger organizations are receptive to a wide range of new fields. As shown in the logistic\nregression results, high enrollment institutions were consistently and often strongly asso-\nciated with early adoption of each one of the 20 growth fields in this study. Large orga-\nnizations have the carrying capacity and the potential student markets to try out new fields,\nand they are receptive both to new occupational-professional and new arts and sciences\nfields. They are, in this sense, the academic omnivores. Without large organizations, less\ninnovation would likely exist in the system, because too few institutions would have the\ncritical mass to adopt emerging fields, or the assurance of enough students to support\ncourses and majors offered in these new fields.\nSecond, the logistic regression results show that the dynamics of competition within\ngeographical regions are very important to processes of diffusion. Encouraged by pio-\nneering institutions, other institutions within a geographical area join to adopt new fields in\norder to compete for students interested in the field. We found consistent and strong\ninfluences of density dependence in these analyses, with a larger number of adopting\ninstitutions associated with higher likelihoods of early adoption. Once perceived saturation\nin a geographic area is reached, however, adoption slows down dramatically or ceases.\nAccordingly, we also found strong and consistent effects for the squared term of adopting\ninstitutions in a region.\nAnother part of the answer to these questions is that institutional status is consequential.\nWealthier colleges and universities tended to support new arts and sciences fields and to\nresist early adoption of new occupational-professional fields. Institutions whose historical\ntraditions favored the arts and sciences showed similar tendencies. The trend toward the\ngrowth of the ``practical arts'' in US higher education (Brint 2002) is consequently con-\nstrained, to some degree, by prestigious institutions that occupy dominant market positions\nand by historical traditions that distance institutions from the utilitarian, job-preparation\ninterests of most undergraduate students and their parents (Astin 1998). This creates a\ncounter-balance within a system otherwise favoring new occupational-professional fields\nand, together with omnivorous large institutions, additional sources for fostering new arts\nand sciences fields.\nFinally, our findings point to potential institutional challenges facing new science and\ntechnology fields. Some traditional bastions of these fields are no longer consistently\namong their early adopters. Doctoral institutions showed more consistent net associations\nwith early adoption of new business fields than with early adoption of new science and\ntechnology fields.15 Public universities showed more consistent net associations with early\nadoption of socially incorporative new culture and identity fields than with early adoption\nof new science and technology fields. Institutions enrolling higher proportions of women\nand minorities also showed lower levels of early adoption of new science and technology\nfields, a factor of interest because these two groups are the fastest-growing in US higher\neducation.\nMany commentators have pointed to the significance of new science and technology\nsuggest under-appreciated institutional factors--the interest of doctoral institutions in\nbusiness fields, the interest of public sector institutions in socially incorporative fields, and\nthe weak scientific interests of many institutions enrolling high proportions of women and\nminorities--which may affect preparation for and diffusion of new science and technology\nfields in US four-year colleges and universities.\nOpen Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Noncom-\nmercial License which permits any noncommercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium,\nprovided the original author(s) and source are credited.\nAppendix A\nSee Table 4.\nVariable N Mean Std.
