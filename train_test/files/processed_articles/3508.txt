Perceived size and size\nconstancy are thought to be computed beyond V1 (Blakemore, Garner, & Sweet, 1972)\nand this has led to the idea that feedback from higher visual areas modulates BOLD\nresponses in V1, where both retinal and extraretinal signals must be brought together\n(Sterzer & Rees, 2006). Whether any perceptual illusion arises solely from V1-specific\nmechanisms (Michel, Chen, Geisler, & Seidemann, 2013; Pooresmaeili, Arrighi, Biagi, &\nMorrone, 2013) regardless of feedback projections from higher areas (Fang et al., 2008;\net al., 2006; Sperandio et al., 2012), is an issue yet to be resolved (see Discussion section).\nIn this study, we tested whether processing specific to V1 can be linked to perceptual\nexperience using the well-known Helmholtz squares illusion (Helmholtz & Southall, 1925;\nFigure 1a), in which a vertically striped square appears wider than a horizontally striped one\nof identical dimensions (Helmholtz & Southall, 1925). This illusion has the advantage of\nminimizing high-level feedback to V1 as it does not depend on misapplied cues for size-\nFigure 1. The Helmholtz squares illusion and the BOLD responses it induces in primary visual cortex. (a) On the\nleft, a vertically lined square appears above a physically matched, horizontally lined square--note the lower square\nappears narrower than the upper square as first described by Helmholtz (Helmholtz & Southall, 1925). On the right,\nthe horizontally lined stimulus has been widened so it is no longer physically square, but now appears to match the\ndimensions of the vertically lined square above it. The width of the perceptually matched horizontally lined stimulus\nwas increased (by 8\u00ad18%) according to each individual's psychophysics results. (b) BOLD response phase to rotating\ncheckerboard wedges superimposed in false color on an inflated representation of the occipital lobe. Data have\nbeen restricted to V1. BOLD responses to squares and rectangles in (a) were analyzed over a line ROI, illustrated as\na dark blue outline. This ROI extended along the representation of the horizontal meridian, where the inner and\nouter stimulus edges are represented. (c) The response (t-statistic) to all stimuli compared against a uniform gray\nbackground.

We found that the extent of BOLD\nresponses in primary visual cortex followed the physical, but not perceptual dimensions of\nthe stimuli. However, our participants performed a demanding central fixation task during\npresentation of the stimuli, so attention was not on the stimuli. Consequently, we bias the\nBOLD responses that we will measure to stimulus-driven activity by reducing the effect of\ntop-down feedback (Fang et al., 2008). We find no illusion-related BOLD responses in V1\nconsistent with the idea that stimulus-driven activity in V1 cannot solely explain the illusion\n(Fang et al., 2008; see Discussion). We next investigated whether activity in V1 and two\ncandidate extrastriate visual areas (LO1 and LO2) played a causal role in the illusion. To do\nthis, we applied transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to one of the three cortical regions,\nwhile participants judged the aspect ratio of horizontally and vertically lined rectangles. The\nstimuli were set such that for each individual, they were normally perceived as square, despite\nbeing physically rectangular. We predicted therefore that TMS of a cortical site underpinning\nthe illusion would generate a release from the illusion. Importantly, this release would register\nas an increase in the number of responses that correctly identify the physical aspect ratio of\nthe stimuli that were normally perceived as perceptually square. Our results showed that\nTMS to LO1 increased the number of correct responses relative to TMS to other sites (LO2\nand V1) and a no TMS control condition. This shows that even when a stimulus-related task\nis performed, which could arguably result in illusion-related signals being feedback to V1, the\nactivity in V1 alone does not cause the illusion. We show, therefore, that extrastriate\nprocessing underpins this example of a size illusion.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\nEight participants (six females; age range: 18\u00ad25 years old; mean \u00bc 21) carried out the pre-\nfunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) psychophysics experiment, retinotopic-\nmapping sessions, and the Helmholtz's squares fMRI experiment. Seven additional\nparticipants carried out the pre-TMS psychophysics and TMS sessions (one female; age\nrange 23\u00ad47; mean \u00bc 30). All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal visual acuity\nand no history of neurological impairments. Informed consent was obtained in accordance\nwith the Declaration of Helsinki. Procedures and protocols were approved by the York\nNeuroimaging Centre (YNiC) Research Ethics Committee at The University of York,\nUnited Kingdom.\nDesign of the fMRI Experiment\nOur first approach to understand what neural processes contribute to the Helmholtz square\nillusion was to measure the extent of BOLD responses in V1 elicited by stimuli inducing and\nalso cancelling the illusion. The logic is as follows: squares comprising vertical lines appear\nwider than squares comprising horizontal lines (Figure 1a), so BOLD responses along the\nrepresentation of the horizontal meridian in V1 (Figure 1b and c) would be of greater extent\nfor vertically than horizontally lined squares (e.g. black vs. red line in Figure 1d), if V1\nactivity follows the illusion. If the BOLD responses in V1 map the physical dimensions of\nMikellidou et al. 3\nthe stimuli, however, no difference in the extent of the activity would register. If the\nhorizontal lines are extended, such that the participant perceives the vertically and\nhorizontally lined stimuli to be equal in width (see ``perceptually matched'' in Figure 1a),\nthe extent of BOLD responses in V1 would be equal, if that activity follows the illusion. In\ncontrast, the extent of V1 BOLD responses along the representation of the horizontal\nmeridian would be greater for the horizontally lined than for the vertically lined stimulus,\nif V1 follows the physical dimension of the stimulus.\nIn terms of the fMRI design, we presented four stimulus conditions. In general,\nhorizontally lined stimuli presented at an eccentricity of 3 were paired with vertically\nlined squares presented at an equal eccentricity in the opposite hemifield. We varied the\nhemifield in which the horizontally lined stimulus appeared (left or right) and the width of\nthe horizontally lined stimulus (physically or perceptually square). As a result, two of the\nstimulus conditions comprised the vertically lined squares appearing in the left hemifield and\nwere paired with a horizontally lined rectangle that was either the same width or was wider,\nappearing in the right hemifield. For the remaining two stimulus conditions, the vertically\nand horizontally lined stimuli were on the right and left, respectively. The four stimulus\nconditions meant that three different stimuli were presented to each hemifield; a vertically\nlined square, a horizontally lined square, and a horizontally lined rectangle whose width was\nperceptually matched to the vertically lined square and was thus physically wider.\nOur hypotheses were tested by contrasting the extent of BOLD responses elicited by these\nstimuli. Our outcome measure, D, to compare conditions was defined as (d1 \u00c0 d2)/(d1 \u00fe d2),\nas shown in Figure 1d, where d is the distance over which the t-statistic exceeded 25% of its\npeak value for the line region of interest (ROI) along the horizontal meridian representation\nof V1 (Figure 1b and c). We selected 25% of the t-statistic as the threshold as it uniformly\nregistered highly significant BOLD responses but also offered a consistent measure relative to\nthe peak BOLD response in each participant. The advantage of computing D is that it is not\nvulnerable to cortical magnification variations between participants. Because we had two\nstimulus conditions (per hemifield) for which vertically lined squares were presented, our\ncontrast measure, D, provides baseline data for the extent of BOLD responses in V1 for\nstimuli that were identical; we predict that D is zero (see Figure 2a i) for this baseline. The\nprediction for the horizontally lined square and wider, rectangular horizontally lined\nrectangle is that D will be positive (Figure 2a ii). This is an essential calibration as it\nallows us to determine whether we can detect changes in the extent of BOLD responses in\nV1 elicited by stimuli that are perceived as differing in width and which are indeed physically\ndifferent in width. The magnitude of D will vary depending on whether V1 follows the\nillusion or the physical dimensions of the stimuli when the stimuli with differing line\norientation are considered. D will either be positive (V1 maps perceived stimulus width) or\nzero (V1 maps the physical stimulus width) when the physically square stimuli with different\nline orientation are contrasted (Figure 2a iii). When the vertically lined stimulus is contrasted\nwith the horizontally lined wider stimulus, D will either be zero (V1 maps perceived stimulus\nwidth) or positive (V1 maps the physical stimulus width; Figure 2a iv).\nThe difference in the physical size of the stimuli that are perceived to be of equal width is\nrelatively small (mean 0.7--see Table 1). It is important therefore to assess whether a shift of\nsuch a size can be detected in the retinotopic representation of V1. The well-characterized V1\ncortical magnification predicts that the spread of BOLD responses due to the illusion (0.35\nat each flank of the stimulus) should result in 2 mm of additional cortical activation at the\ninner flank of the stimulus (3 eccentricity) but only 0.5 mm at the outer flank. It is likely\ntherefore that the resolution of fMRI will only detect shifts at representations of the near\nrather than the far flank (Engel, Glover, & Wandell, 1997; see Figure 1d). To achieve\nmeasuring the total $2.5 mm predicted change in the extent of BOLD responses, we\nperformed fMRI at a reasonably high resolution (2.5 \u00c2 2 \u00c2 2 mm). So, while the change is\nsmall, it should be detectable in V1 with our approach. However, for other visual areas which\nhave smaller representations of the visual field, we are unable to test our hypotheses because\nof the spatial resolution of our fMRI measures. It is also important to note that the\ndifferences in spatial extent that we are aiming to detect in V1 could be easily masked by\nrelatively small eye movements. With this in mind, we had participants perform a demanding\nfixation task. A consequence is that this biases the BOLD responses that we will measure to\nstimulus-driven activity by reducing the effect of top-down feedback (Fang et al., 2008).\nDesign of the TMS Experiment\nWhile the fMRI experiment given earlier was designed to detect stimulus-related BOLD\nresponses in primary visual cortex and determine whether it was governed by perceptual\nor physical dimensions of the stimulus, the data we can derive from fMRI are\ncorrelational. Moreover, because of cortical magnification and fMRI resolution, we were\nrestricted to detecting changes in V1 alone. We therefore designed a TMS experiment that is\ncapable of probing the causal roles that V1 and two extrastriate visual areas play in the\nperception of the Helmholtz illusion. We designed the study as a follow-up to the fMRI\nstudy in which we detected no illusion-related BOLD responses in V1. However, one reason\nfor this could have been the absence of a stimulus-related task. Importantly, therefore, our\nTMS experiment actively engaged participants in an aspect ratio judgment that highlighted\nthe illusion. Specifically, we had participants indicate whether rectangular stimuli, which were\nset to be perceptually square, were taller or wider than a square. We can revisit the role of V1,\ntherefore, by applying TMS to it during these perceptual judgments. We also reasoned that\ntwo other visual areas, LO1 and LO2, might also play a role in the Helmholtz illusion. LO1\nhas been shown to be orientation-selective (Larsson, Heeger, Larsson, & Heeger, 2006) and\nTMS to LO1 also interferes with orientation discrimination (Silson et al., 2013). Given that\nthe stimulus difference that gives rise to the Helmholtz illusion is one of orientation alone, we\nasked how LO1 might be involved. LO2 offers a good control region as it lies very nearby\nLO1 and therefore tests the spatial specificity of any effect we might detect for LO1. Crucial\nto the design of this experiment is the predicted behavioral outcome that is associated with a\nrelease from the illusion. Individuals were presented with stimuli that they originally\nperceived to be square, but were in fact physically anisotropic, meaning a release from the\nillusion would result in participants' judgments becoming more veridical. That is, their\nresponses would reflect the physical anisotropy of the stimulus. We predict therefore an\nincrease in correct judgments when TMS disrupts activity in a region of the brain that\ngoverns the illusion.\nProcedures\nMeasuring the Size of the Illusion and Producing Stimuli that Null it\nKey to both the experiments is the prerequisite that we can measure the Helmholtz illusion\nand then produce stimuli that null the illusion for each individual. For the psychophysical\nexperiments that preceded the fMRI measurements, we presented stimuli in the left and right\nhemifields simultaneously for 600 ms, with the nearest edge 3 away from a central fixations\ncross. The lines comprising the stimuli alternated between black (300 ms) and then white\n(300 ms) during the 600 ms trial and were presented on a uniform gray background that was\nof luminance equivalent to the mean of the black and white lines. The two different phases of\nMikellidou et al. 5\nthe stimulus were used to prevent afterimages. To create prominent illusion, each rectangular\nstimulus consisted of seven lines, with a duty cycle of 0.9 (thin lines on a gray background)\nThompson & Mikellidou, 2011). We spatially jittered the stimuli by up to 0.1 to prevent\nafterimages providing cues to physical size changes between successive trials. We used the\nmethod of constant stimuli to determine the point of subjective equality (PSE) under two\ndifferent conditions.\nIn one condition, we presented a reference, 6.6 square comprising horizontal lines to either\nthe left or right hemifield and in the other hemifield, we presented a test rectangle comprising\nThis condition provided control data as participants should, under these stimulus conditions,\nhave veridical perception as both the reference and test are defined by lines of the same\norientation. In another condition, we presented a 6.6 reference square comprising vertical\nlines to either the left or right hemifield and in the other hemifield, we presented a test\nrectangle, defined by horizontal lines, drawn from those used in the control experiment.\nThis condition was used to assess the size of the illusion. The height of the stimuli\nremained constant for all conditions. The two conditions were interleaved into single runs.\nTwo runs were carried out, with each run comprising 700 trials (350 control and 350 illusion)\nwith each test stimulus width presented 50 times for each condition. The participant was\nasked to indicate on which side (left or right) the wider of the two rectangles appeared. We\nderived psychometric functions for each participant and fitted them with a cumulative\nGaussian. The PSE was found to be in the range of 6.56 to 6.63 for the control\ncondition and 7.09 to 7.79 for the illusory condition. Our participants were therefore\nveridical in the control condition and experienced the illusion in the other condition where\nthe horizontal stimulus width was increased between 8 and 18% in order to be perceptually\nmatched to the vertically lined stimulus. The psychophysics took approximately 20 minutes to\ncomplete. The results for individuals in the psychophysical experiment are shown in Table 1.\nThe ViSaGe (Cambridge Research Systems) Visual Stimulus Generator was used, along\nwith its MatLab (Mathworks, Natick, MA) CRS toolbox, to present calibrated stimuli on a\nMitsubishi Diamond Plus 91 monitor with precision timing (viewing distance \u00bc 57 cm). The\nluminance \u00bc 10 cdm\u00c02). A CB6 (Cambridge Research Systems) response box was used to\ngather participants' responses.\nFor the psychophysical experiment that preceded the TMS experiment, we adopted a\nmodified approach. We reasoned that we needed to disrupt the representation of the\nTable 1.

The paired stimulus design used in fMRI\nwould be impossible with a single TMS coil as the stimulus representation would be in\nboth hemispheres. Even with two coils and dual TMS, the proximity of the stimulus\nrepresentation in left and right V1 to the midline would not allow two coils to be\nseparated physically to stimulate left and right V1 simultaneously. We therefore presented\nstimuli in only one location allowing us to stimulate its representation in V1, LO1, and LO2.\nWe also reduced the size of the stimuli to 2.9, so the stimulus representation in V1 was closer\nto the cortical surface than it would have been for the larger stimuli used in the fMRI\nexperiment. This precaution gives us greater confidence that the distance between the TMS\ncoil and our three targets will not vary greatly and will not therefore be the cause of any\npotential differences in the participant's responses. We also changed the stimulus duration to\n200 ms as this is a period over which we routinely apply TMS to disrupt performance in\nvisual tasks and allows us to stay within published safety guidelines for TMS (Rossi et al.,\n2009). As a result of the changes we made to the stimuli, we needed to assess how the aspect\nratios of these newly specified horizontally and vertically lined rectangles were perceived and\nused the following stimuli and procedure to do so.\nStimuli were black, vertically and horizontally lined, rectangles presented on a uniform\ngray background. As before, each rectangular stimulus consisted of seven lines, with a duty\ncycle of 0.9 (thin lines on a gray background), but in this case subtended 2.9 along the\ndimension orthogonal to the direction of the bars. The length of the bars was varied during\nthe psychophysical experiment.\nParticipants fixated a central red circle (0.15) throughout the experiment. Stimuli were\ncentred at 2.8 along the horizontal meridian in the visual field contralateral to planned TMS\nstimulation and were viewed binocularly (Figure 3a). On each trial, the absolute position of\nthe stimulus was varied by adding a random value between 0 and \u00c6 0.1 to both x and y. The\nstimulus was shown for 200 ms followed by an intertrial interval (ITI) in which the\nparticipant indicated whether the stimulus was taller or wider than a true square. To\ncapture individual psychometric functions for both the horizontal and vertical Helmholtz\nstimuli, a total of six interleaved staircases (1-up, 3-down; 3-up, 1-down; 1-up, 2-down; 2-up,\n1-down; two 1-up, 1-down staircases) were completed for each stimulus. Horizontally and\nvertically lined stimuli were randomly interleaved within the same experimental block. These\nprocedures were used to distribute trials at informative points along the psychometric\nfunction, which was fitted using data from all trials, except the first two reversals which\nwere removed from the analysis. The step size was initially 0.4 and halved on reversals 3\u00ad\n5. The staircase concluded after 14 reversals, resulting in $30 trials per staircase type ($180\ntrials per psychometric function). A cumulative Gaussian was fitted to the data and the 0.5\npoint was taken at the observer's PSE. The PSE gives the dimensions of the stimuli that were\nperceived as square. To account for any variance across sessions, participants completed the\nbehavioural psychophysics three times and the average value was used in the TMS\nexperiment. Each of the three runs took approximately 20 minutes to complete. The results\nfor the psychophysical experiment are shown in Table 2.\nStimuli were generated using Matlab and Psychtoolbox (Brainard, 1997; Kleiner et al.,\nRetinotopic Mapping Procedures for Both fMRI and TMS Experiments\nCrucial to the fMRI and TMS experiments is the need to identify retinotopic maps in each\nindividual. For our fMRI experiment, we need to identify V1 and for the TMS experiment,\nMikellidou et al. 7\nwe need to identify V1, LO1, and LO2. All imaging data involved in the process of\nretinotopic mapping were acquired on a GE 3-Tesla Signa HD Excite scanner at the\nYNiC, University of York.\nA rotating wedge was used to map polar angle and expanding rings were used to map\neccentricity and standard Fourier methods were used to analyze the retinotopic data (DeYoe\n100% contrast radial checkerboard (14 radius) with 24 radial segments on a mean gray\nbackground. Wedges were 90 in size and rotated counterclockwise about a red fixation cross.\nRing stimuli expanded about fixation. Participants maintained fixation throughout the scan.\nBoth wedges and rings were high contrast (>98%, 400 cdm\u00c02) checkerboard stimuli that\nreversed contrast at a rate of 6 Hz. For the fMRI experiment, four scans were collected (two\nwedges and two rings) and each scan contained seven cycles of wedges/rings, with 36 s per\ncycle. For the TMS experiments, eight scans were collected (four wedges and four rings) and\neach scan contained eight cycles of wedges/rings, with 36 s per cycle. For both the fMRI and\nTMS experiments, data were averaged across scans.\nFunctional data across all sessions were aligned to a canonical anatomical volume using a\nproton-density image acquired with the same prescription as the functional data as an\nintermediate alignment step. Motion correction was achieved using FSL's MCFLIRT\n(Jenkinson, Bannister, Brady, & Smith, 2002) and no significant movements were seen\nthroughout scanning. The functional time series were high-pass filtered to remove baseline\ndrifts. We used mrVista and mrMesh analysis software to perform the retinotopic analysis\nand visualize data in volume and inflated cortical views (http://white.stanford.edu). Visual\nareas were hand drawn on these inflated cortical views according to established reversals in\npolar angle demarcating specific visual areas (Larsson, Heeger, et al., 2006; Wandell,\nThe anatomical data that provided a canonical volume were acquired with different\nprocedures for the fMRI study and for the follow-up TMS study.

The subsequent gray-white matter segmentation was hand\nedited and checked for topology errors using itkGray (http://white.stanford.edu).\nFor the fMRI study, retinotopy data were obtained with gradient recalled echo pulse\nsequences to measure T2* BOLD data parallel to the calcarine sulcus (TR \u00bc 2000 ms,\n2.5 mm, in-plane resolution \u00bc 2 \u00c2 2 mm). Magnetization was allowed to reach a steady\nstate by discarding the first five volumes. Data were obtained with an eight-channel head\ncoil. For the TMS study, a revised approach was adopted that exploits the increased signal to\nnoise of a 16-channel coil and uses a slightly higher spatial resolution. Gradient recalled echo\npulse sequences were used to measure BOLD signals acquired parallel to the calcarine sulcus\ncontiguous slices per volume at 2 \u00c2 2 \u00c2 2 mm3). The first three volumes from all scans were\ndiscarded to allow the magnetization to reach magnetization steady state.\nProcedure for the fMRI Study Examining the Extent of BOLD Responses in V1 Elicited by\nHorizontally and Vertically Lined Stimuli\nTo obtain robust V1 responses in fMRI, we varied the contrast of the lined rectangles by\non a uniform grey background (10 cdm\u00c02). Stimuli were rear projected onto an acrylic screen\nand viewed by participants lying supine in the scanner from 57 cm via a front-silvered mirror\nmounted onto the MRI head coil. To determine whether regions of the early visual cortex\nhave a representation for perceptual differences, we presented stimuli on either side of\nfixation while acquiring T2* weighted volumes.\nIn the first out of four stimulus conditions employed, Helmholtz's squares consisting of a\nhorizontally striped and a vertically striped square of identical dimensions (6.6 \u00c2 6.6; seven\nlines; duty cycle \u00bc 0.9; spatial frequency \u00bc 1.30c/). The vertically and horizontally lined\nsquares appeared in the left and right hemifields, respectively, in one condition and vice\nversa in the other. In the other two conditions, in order to compensate for the Helmholtz's\nsquares illusion, the pre-fMRI psychophysics results from each individual were used to adjust\nthe width of the horizontally striped square such that it would be perceptually matched with\nthe vertically lined square. As before, the vertically and horizontally lined stimuli appeared in\nleft and right hemifields, respectively, in one condition, and vice versa in another. Each\nstimulus condition was presented for a block of 9 s followed by a 9 s block of uniform\ngray. In total, eight blocks per condition were presented in a pseudorandom order. The\nduration of the run was therefore 4 conditions \u00c2 8 blocks \u00c2 18 s \u00bc 576 s. Each participant\ncompleted two runs. Because the block length of 9 s was much longer than the 0.6 s\nstimulus duration we used in psychophysics, we tested one of our participants with this\nMikellidou et al. 9\nlonger (9 s) stimulus duration and found that their results were unchanged (control PSE:\nWe used a demanding central attention task to ensure that participants maintained\nfixation, as small shifts in gaze could hinder our ability to detect small changes in the\nextent of cortical BOLD responses.

In this process, data were first high pass filtered\nwith a boxcar function of duration of 18 s. Otherwise, data were left spatially unsmoothed\nbut were up-sampled when transformed to the anatomical space.

The identification of LO1 and LO2 is identical to that described previously\n(Silson et al., 2013). V1 was identified from the polar angle data as the hemifield map\nfound in calcarine cortex. Targets for TMS were selected from the hemisphere in which\nLO1 and LO2 were most clearly identifiable, resulting in the left hemisphere being\nstimulated in five observers (Table 3). For each participant, centroids for V1, LO1, and\nLO2 were calculated for accurate TMS coil targeting using the Brainsight system (Rogue\nResearch). The distance between these centroids is shown in Table 3. Further, we included an\noptimal trajectory for all ROIs that specified the angular approach of the TMS coil to the\ntarget region. For LO1 and LO2, the trajectories were set approximately parallel to one\nSubject Hemisphere\n(mm)\n(mm)\nNote. Talairach centroids along with the actual distance between V1-LO1 centroids and LO1-LO2 centroids are given for all\nseven participants.\nanother, each going through the center of mass the respective ROI. Using retinotopic\neccentricity maps, we restricted the V1 ROI to the center of the Helmholtz stimuli (2.8).\nTo maximize the effects of TMS along the horizontal meridian, a trajectory was created in\nBrainsight that aligned the TMS coil down the calcarine sulcus through the center of this\nROI. Having gathered fMRI data for relatively large, more eccentric Helmholtz stimuli, we\nknew that we needed to create smaller, less eccentric Helmholtz stimuli in order to make them\naccessible to TMS stimulation.\nFor each 200 ms stimulus presentation (Figure 3a), a train of four biphasic pulses,\nseparated by 50 ms (20 Hz) were delivered at 70% of the max stimulator output (2.6 T). As\nwe did not have specific predictions about feedforward versus feedback processing, we used\nthis protocol to cover time periods that should be influenced by both processes. Pulses were\ndelivered by a Magstim `figure of 8' coil connected to a Magstim Rapid 2 stimulator.\nParticipants were seated in a custom built chair with chin rest and temple support.\nThe coil was mechanically secured, placed directly above the cortical target, and pressed\nflush against the participants scalp to minimize the coil-target distance. The coil was\ntracked in real time to provide trial-by-trial measurements of coil-target distance and coil-\ntarget offset.\nEach subject underwent four counterbalanced sessions (no TMS and TMS to V1, LO1, or\nLO2). During each session, four trial types were presented: Horizontally lined stimuli that\nwere (a) perceptually and (b) physically square, and vertically lined stimuli that were (a)\nperceptually and (b) physically square. There were 50 presentations of each trial type\n(total 200 trials). The no TMS session took approximately 10 minutes to complete and\neach TMS session took approximately 20 minutes to complete. The order of trials was\nrandomized with a minimum ITI of 2000 ms in addition to the participants' reaction time.\nTrials for which coil-target displacement was large (>2.5 mm), or reaction time was greater\nthan 2000 ms after the offset of the stimulus, were removed from the analysis ($1%). We\nincluded trials in which physically square stimuli were presented because they can allow us to\ntest whether participant response become biased to wider or taller as a result of TMS or as a\nresult of the orientation of the stimuli. For example, the predicted release from the illusion\nwould mean that horizontally lined stimulus that was set to be perceptually square would be\nperceived as wider, a response that might arise if a bias related to the stimulus orientation\noccurs. However, such a bias would be expressed for the physically square, horizontally lined\nstimuli, so examination of responses to the square stimuli will show whether an orientation\nand TMS-dependent bias in aspect ratio judgments arises.\nTwo observers (S2 and S5) did not experience the Helmholtz illusion for the vertically\nstriped stimuli (see Table 2). We would not expect to be able to elicit a release from the\nillusion when the illusion is not present and therefore excluded trials to the vertically lined\nstimuli for these two observers from the analysis. We recruited eight participants for the TMS\nexperiment. One participant did not complete the experiment due to salient phosphenes\nwhich they found distracted them from the task.\nResults\nAssessing the Extent of BOLD Responses in V1 and Its Relationship With an Illusory\nPercept of Size\nFor each observer, we first established psychophysically the extent of the Helmholtz squares\nillusion (see Experimental Procedures, Table 1). By increasing the width of the horizontally\nlined squares, we generated stimuli that cancelled the illusion; these stimuli were perceptually\nMikellidou et al. 11\nsquare, but physically rectangular (Figure 1a). During the fMRI experiments, participants\nviewed three different stimuli: a vertically lined square, a horizontally lined square, and a\nhorizontally lined rectangle whose width was perceptually matched to the vertically lined\nsquare, but as a result was physically wider. These stimuli were presented in a different\npairing (see Methods section) that allowed the calculation of contrasts to examine whether\nV1 maps the perceptual or physical dimensions on the stimuli. Figure 2a illustrates these\ncontrasts and the associated predictions for V1 mapping the perceived stimulus width (top\npanel) or V1 mapping the physical stimulus width (bottom panel).\nComparisons (i) and (ii) allow us to gauge whether our measures are sensitive to detect\nchanges in physical size which are equivalent to the perceived changes observers experience in\nthe illusion (Figure 2a). Comparisons (iii) and (iv) will have very different results depending\non the role of V1 in the Helmholtz squares illusion (Figure 2a). If stimulus-driven BOLD\nresponses in V1 underlies the illusion, stimuli of matched physical width defined by\northogonal line orientation will elicit different activity profiles, whereas those matched for\nperceived size should register no difference in activity profile (Figure 2a--top row). If\nhowever stimulus-driven BOLD responses follows the physical dimensions of the stimulus,\nwe predict the opposite (Figure 2a--bottom row).\nData showing D for each individual are shown in Figure 2b. The pattern of results is\nlargely uniform across participants. This pattern is confirmed in the group means shown in\nFigure 2c. The value of D is distributed around zero for stimuli of the same orientation and\ndimensions (contrast (i)), whereas the contrast between stimuli of the same orientation, but\ndifferent dimensions (contrast (ii)) is positive. Taken together, these results confirm that our\nscanning parameters appeared sensitive enough to detect relatively small physical differences\nin V1. The crucial comparisons to determine whether V1 maps the perceived size of the\nstimulus come from contrasts iii and iv. For contrast iii, D is again distributed around\nzero showing that for stimuli of different orientation, but identical physical dimensions,\nthe extent of BOLD responses in V1 is very similar. In the situation when the stimuli\ndiffer in orientation, but are matched perceptually, D is positive reflecting V1's sensitivity\nto unequal size of the stimuli. Qualitatively, therefore, the pattern of the data (Figure 2b) is\nindistinguishable from the lower panel of Figure 2a in which the prediction of the results for\n``V1 maps physical stimulus width'' is given.\nThe data fit neatly in a framework that can be assessed statistically with a two-way\nanalysis of variance (ANOVA), the factors being physical width (same/wider) and\norientation (parallel/orthogonal). A significant main effect of physical width, F(1, 7) \u00bc 11.4,\nphysical width and orientation was not significant, F(1, 7) \u00bc 0.33, p \u00bc .582. The extent of\nBOLD responses along the representation of the horizontal meridian is therefore entirely\nexplained by the physical dimensions of the stimuli. It is important to note that this is not a\nnull result; the extent of BOLD responses changes significantly in V1 as a result of a change in\nthe dimension of the stimulus, but the change is not dependent on the orientation of the\nstimuli, which does affect our perception.\nThe Causal Role of V1, LO1, and LO2 in an Illusory Percept of Size\nHaving established that stimulus-driven BOLD responses in V1 do not underpin the\nHelmholtz squares illusion, we asked whether this result arose because the illusion is\nunderpinned by neural processing outside of V1. To answer this question, we had\nparticipants make judgments on perceptually square horizontally and vertically lined stimuli\nwhile we applied TMS to three candidate regions: V1 and extrastriate LO1 and LO2 (Figure 3a;\nLarsson, Heeger, et al., 2006). As before, each participant was tested ahead of the TMS session\nto determine the dimensions of the rectangle that were perceived square (Table 2).\nIf TMS successfully disrupts neural processing specific to one's percept of the Helmholtz\nsquares illusion, a release from the illusion would be experienced. The more the illusion\ndissipates, the more the physical anisotropy of the stimuli will become apparent, and\ntherefore the more correct responses will be made by the observer. If TMS does not\ninterfere with processing specific to the illusion, we would expect no change in the\nproportion of correct responses. That is we expect responses around chance (0.5) for a\nstimulus that is perceptually square where the participant has to make a forced choice\nresponse--taller or wider? For the no TMS condition, responses were not at floor (0.5)\nbut around 0.65 (Figure 3c), suggesting that during the psychophysics, participants had a\ntendency to overcorrect for the Illusion. Even at 0.65, there is plenty of room for a\nrelease from the illusion (toward 1.0), so this overcorrection did not hinder the design of\nthe study.\nThe individual data detailing the proportion of correct responses across the baseline no\nTMS and TMS (V1, LO1, and LO2) sessions are shown in Figure 3b. It is clear that in each\nobserver (except S3), TMS to LO1 results in the greatest number of veridical responses. This\nis reflected in the group means as shown in Figure 3c. A one-way repeated measures ANOVA\ncompared proportion of correct responses among the four conditions by conducting six\npairwise t-tests (two-tailed, Bonferroni corrected). Compared to the no TMS condition\n(M \u00bc 0.65, SD \u00bc .12), TMS of area V1 does not compromise the strength of the illusion,\nFigure 2. Predictions and results for BOLD responses elicited in primary visual cortex by the Helmholtz\nsquares illusion.

The results fit with\nthe prediction that V1 maps physical, not perceived width.\nMikellidou et al. 13\ncompromised significantly the strength of the illusion compared with the no TMS\nprocessing of orientation information (Larsson, Landy, & Heeger, 2006; Silson et al., 2013;\nTibber, Anderson, Melmoth, Rees, & Morgan, 2009). Disruption of LO1 processing lead to\nsignificantly more veridical responses compared with disruption of V1, t(6) \u00bc 4.14, p \u00bc .036.\nFurther, disruption of LO1 led to significantly more veridical responses compared with\ndid not significantly affect the proportion of veridical responses compared with no TMS,\nExploring Potential Explanations of the TMS Results\nThe TMS task reported here is largely robust to nontask specific effects such as increased\ndistraction owing to discomfort during TMS. Task distraction would most likely result in one\nguessing, causing responses to move toward floor (0.5) in the opposite direction to a predicted\nrelease from the illusion. Still, we wanted to rule out whether TMS to LO1 or LO2 interfered\nwith visual tasks in general. That is, was the TMS site-specific effect we observed for the\naspect ratio judgments also specific to that task? To do this, we had six of our seven\nparticipants perform a contour integration task (not part of the original design reported\nhere). Participants were required to indicate in which of two temporal intervals, a contour,\ndefined by aligned Gabor elements within an array of randomly orientated Gabors, appeared\n(Field, Hayes, & Hess, 1993). We found no effect of the site of TMS on performance in this\nSD \u00bc .02 and M \u00bc 0.73 SD \u00bc .05, respectively. A two (Experiment: contour integration,\nHelmholtz) by three (ROI: no TMS, LO1, and LO2) repeated measures ANOVA found\nno main effect of experiment, F(1,5) \u00bc 0.22, p \u00bc .656, a significant main effect of ROI F(2,\n10) \u00bc 4.14, p \u00bc .049, and importantly, a significant interaction between experiment and ROI,\nHelmholtz stimuli reported here.\nFigure 3. (a) Overview of experimental procedure. (b) Individual data (circles). (b) Group mean data (bars).\n(b) and (c) data are plotted in terms of proportion correct responses: 0.50 indicates participant guessing as\nexpected for PSE-matched, perceptually square stimuli; 1.00 indicates correct reporting of the physically\nelongated stimulus dimension on all trials. Results for horizontally and vertically striped stimuli are pooled\ntogether, except in the case of S2 and S5 (see Procedure section for the TMS study examining the causal roles\nof V1, LO1, and LO2 in size perception). Error bars denote \u00c6 SEM. Asterisks denote a significant difference\nbetween conditions (*p <.05, **p <.01; Bonferroni-corrected).\nBecause response bias may occur during TMS stimulation, we designed the experiment to\ninclude stimuli to explore this possibility (see Methods section). A response bias related to the\norientation of the stimuli could provide a pattern of results that is interpreted as a release from\nthe illusion (a bias in reporting wider for horizontal stimuli and taller for vertical stimuli). To\ncheck for response bias, we presented physically square stimuli of different line orientation\nwhich normally show the illusion. A one-way ANOVA for the horizontally lined, F(3,\nshowed responses to these stimuli to be constant across all experimental conditions (no TMS,\nV1, LO1, and LO2) ruling out the possible role of observer response bias in this experiment.\nA speed-accuracy trade-off, although unlikely, could cause the pattern of results reported\nhere. That is, participants may take longer to respond in order to increase accuracy. Reaction\ntimes across all conditions are shown in Figure 4a. No significant differences were found, F(3,\n18) \u00bc .338, p \u00bc .798, ruling out an explanation based on a speed\u00adaccuracy trade-off.\nA change in coil-target distance or coil-target error (the offset between the desired and\nactual position of the TMS coil) could also account for the pattern of results reported here.\nNo differences were found between conditions for these measures: Figure 4b coil-target\nThese results suggest that neither changes in coil-target distance nor coil-target error can\naccount for the pattern of results reported here.\nImportantly, as we discussed earlier, the effective depth of the figure-8 coil used in this\nFigure 4b shows that the average coil-target distance for V1, LO1, and LO2, was 1.80 cm,\n1.83 cm, and 1.93 cm, respectively, indicating that TMS is effective and equally so across our\nstimulation sites. Further, the coil-target offset was very small<0.5 mm, indicating accurate\nTMS coil positioning across conditions (Figure 4c).\nDiscussion\nWe established psychophysically the extent of the illusion and how to generate stimuli that\ncancelled it; these stimuli were perceptually square, but physically rectangular. Crucially, we\ncould use these stimuli to probe whether visual cortex mapped physical or perceptual size.\nFirst, we confirmed that the extent of BOLD responses in V1 followed the physical\ndimensions of the stimulus rather than its perceived dimensions. These results therefore\nserved to confirm that the processing specific to V1 was not sufficient to give rise to the\nFigure 4. Plots of potentially confounding variables for the PSE-matched Helmholtz stimuli. (a) Reaction\ntime. (b) Coil-target distance. (c) Coil-target offset. Error bars represent the standard error of the mean. No\nsignificant differences were found between any of the conditions reported here.\nMikellidou et al. 15\nillusion (Fang et al., 2008). Second, during perceptual judgments of stimuli that cancelled the\nillusion, we found that TMS to LO1, and not V1 or LO2, shifted participants' perception\nfrom the illusory to the physical dimensions of the stimuli.\nWhile BOLD responses in V1 can undoubtedly be modulated by illusory percepts (Fang\nPooresmaeili et al., 2013; Sperandio et al., 2012), our results show that V1 does not have the\ncapacity to cause the illusory percept itself. We are able to draw this conclusion on the basis\nthat we were able to document small, but significant changes in the extent of BOLD responses\nin primary visual cortex that followed only physical, rather than perceptual dimensions of the\nstimulus. Had primary visual cortex followed the illusion, our methods were sensitive enough\nto detect it. Importantly, and in contrast with previous reports, we provide causal evidence\nillustrating that extrastriate, rather than primary visual cortex, is responsible for the\nexperience of a size illusion. This result stands alongside existing evidence suggesting other\nillusions may have a neural locus in the extrastriate lateral occipital area as observed for the\nMu\n\u00a8 ller-Lyer illusion (Weidner & Fink, 2007) and Kanizsa-type illusory figures (Wokke,\nWe designed our study after Fang et al. (2008) who found illusion-related BOLD\nresponses in V1 dissipated when attention was occupied using a demanding central fixation\ntask. The authors reasoned that reducing attention to the 2-D contextual surround that gives\nrise to the Ponzo illusion likely reduces feedback to V1 from extrastriate regions known to\nprocess these 2-D depth cues. By similarly occupying attention in the fMRI study reported\nhere, we aimed to reduce any effects of top-down feedback and thus bias our measures to\nlook at stimulus-driven BOLD responses in V1. However, more recent work published since\nwe designed our study suggests that occupying attention may not rule out feedback signals to\nV1. Kok et al. (2016) examined perceptual completion of Kanizsa-type figures and found\nillusion-related BOLD responses in the in the deep layer of V1, known to receive extrastriate\nfeedback, when attention was occupied centrally. It should be noted that although no\nsignificant difference was observed, there was a reduction in illusion-related BOLD\nresponses when attention was occupied using a more demanding task (Kok & De Lange,\n2014). Importantly then, by simply manipulating attention, we cannot distinguish between\nV1-specific and feedback accounts of illusion-related BOLD responses in V1, as in both cases\ndiscussed earlier, the illusion-related BOLD responses in V1 can be attributed to feedback\n(Fang et al., 2008; Kok & De Lange, 2014). Thus, it is important to examine what causal roles\nvisual areas play in illusions with the use of TMS. The efficacy of such an approach has been\ndemonstrated by Maus et al. who find only TMS to MT\u00fe, but not V1, reduces the flash-lag\nillusion (Maus, Ward, Nijhawan, & Whitney, 2013). These TMS findings dovetail with\nevidence for a neural correlate of the flash-lag effect in MT\u00fe, and not V1, observed when\nparticipants' attention was occupied centrally (Maus, Fischer, & Whitney, 2013). During the\nTMS study reported here, we had participants fixate centrally while assessing the aspect ratio\nof the stimuli presented to them, rather than perform the demanding fixation task we used in\nfMRI. The absence of an effect of TMS to V1 during a stimulus-related task means that even\nif V1 were to show illusion-related BOLD responses, which we may have failed to detect\nbecause of the absence of a stimulus-related task, it does not appear to play a causal role in\nthe illusory percept. It is important to note that there is no methodological reason why we\nshould have encountered a lack of effect of TMS to V1. We ensured that the stimuli were\nlocated such that their representation in V1 was relatively near the scalp surface, which meant\nthat the distance between the coil and neural tissue was not significantly different across our\nthree stimulation sites (V1, LO1, and LO2; Figure 4). The capacity for TMS to disrupt neural\nprocessing should therefore be equal for all sites.\nWhile it is plausible that many reports of illusory effects correlating with V1 BOLD\nresponses reflect feedback from higher visual areas (Fang et al., 2008; Kok et al., 2016;\nKok & De Lange, 2014; Murray et al., 2006), three recent reports may prove to be\nexceptions. First, changes in perceived size, resulting from adaptation, could originate in\nV1. However, similar effects found in area V2 (Pooresmaeili et al., 2013) pose a challenge\nin distinguishing between feedforward and feedback propagation of signals (Chouinard &\nIvanowich, 2014). Second, while there is compelling evidence demonstrating that Emmert's\nillusion can elicit a commensurate distortion of V1 retinotopy (Sperandio et al., 2012), V1\nitself is not essential to experience this illusory percept. This is described in the case of patient\nD.B. whom, having had their right primary visual cortex removed, still experienced Emmert's\nillusion as a prime-sight' in their left visual field (Weiskrantz, Cowey, & Hodinott-Hill, 2002).\nThird, distortions to Gabor stimuli found in Macaque V1 are predicted based on the\nreceptive field properties of V1 neurons, a finding that is mirrored in human\npsychophysical data (Michel et al., 2013). It is likely however that this effect is specific to\nstimuli that matched the dimensions of the putative receptive fields. Our results show that at a\ndifferent scale, for the Helmholtz stimuli used here, the opposite perceptual distortion is\nfound and that this distortion is not reflected in V1 BOLD responses.\nSo, it appears that while evidence exists for a change in the BOLD response profile of V1\nlikely originates from feedback from extrastriate cortex (Fang et al., 2008; Kok et al., 2016;\nKok & De Lange, 2014; Weiskrantz et al., 2002) and may not play a causal role in our\nperception. However, to make such conclusions requires careful examination of the\nneurochronometric processing between V1 and extrastriate regions. Our approach to this\nwas to select a TMS protocol that covered the canonical time periods for both feedforward\nand feedback processing between V1 and extrastriate regions (see Methods section). By\nchoosing this protocol, we believe that we captured both feedforward and feedback\nprocessing related to the Helmholtz illusion during TMS stimulation. Alternative, elegant\nstrategies have also been used; Wokke et al. show using single and double-pulse TMS that\none's percept of Kanizsa-type illusory figures is disrupted at an early, feedforward time\nsignature in LO, and a late, feedback time signature in V1, suggesting that both early\nprocessing in LO and feedback to V1 contribute to the perceptual completion of these\nfigures (Wokke et al., 2012). It is important then that future studies also examine such\nfeedforward and feedback processing by using TMS pulses of varying latencies. This\nneurochronometric approach could be used to study different illusions, including those\nthat require 2-D contextual surrounds (e.g., Ponzo), to explore whether V1 is causally\ninvolved in the illusion or if specific extrastriate loci underpin those illusions (Maus,\nFischer, et al., 2013; Wokke et al., 2012). Further, future studies could examine potential\nroles of extrastriate regions other than LO1 and LO2 in the Helmholtz illusion.\nOne question is how TMS stimulation to orientation-specific LO1 may affect a release\nfrom the illusion, whereas TMS stimulation to shape-specific LO2 does not (Silson et al.,\n2013). Given that the Helmholtz illusion is dependent on orientation, disrupting orientation-\nspecific processing may be expected to result in a release from the illusion as we observed with\nstimulation to LO1--in a classic psychophysical sense, we can think of perception and thus\nthe PSE shifting toward the veridical dimension of the physically stretched stimulus.\nDisrupting shape-specific processing as would be predicted when stimulating LO2 should\nlead only to shape estimates becoming more variable, affecting the just noticeable difference\nwithout shifting the PSE. Further research could ask whether such effects do result from\nTMS to LO2, but it is noted that TMS experiments of this type would require a very large\nMikellidou et al. 17\nnumber of trials to fully capture the psychometric function. Due to TMS safety, concerns\n(Rossi et al., 2009), and the four stimulus types used here, we used a limited number of trials\nand did therefore not capture full psychometric functions. The influence of TMS on neural\nprocessing is not entirely clear. However, the disruption of orientation-specific processing in\nLO1 is likely a result of increased noise, which degrades an orientation signal that gives rise to\nthe illusion.\nTo conclude, we identify a specific extrastriate area, LO1, that underpins an illusion of size\ndependent upon the orientation of lined rectangles. Moreover, V1 appears not to be causally\ninvolved in the illusory percept, a finding that may also generalize to other illusions of size.\n"
