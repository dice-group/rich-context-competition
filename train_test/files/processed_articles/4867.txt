    "abstract": "Abstract\nIn continuous flash suppression (CFS), a dynamic sequence of Mondrian patterns presented to one\neye suppresses a static target in the other eye for several seconds at a time. Its effectiveness has\nbeen linked to low-level properties such as spatial frequency and orientation, but the role of higher\norder influences remains unstudied. Here, using a tracking paradigm, we asked if the spatial and\ntemporal predictability of the Mondrian sequence affects CFS dynamics. Predictable temporal\nsequences were regularly updated every 100 ms or modulated sinusoidally in pixel luminance at\n2 Hz. Unpredictable temporal sequences were irregularly updated or had stochastic pixel\nluminance changes across time. To vary spatial predictability, sequences were either updated\nwith different Mondrian patterns or had a fixed spatial pattern. We found a modest effect of\nspatial uncertainty when the target modulation was low (0.125 Hz) but not temporal uncertainty,\nwhich had no significant effects regardless of target modulation. Similar results were obtained\nwhen we pitted the standard Mondrian sequence against sequences with a fixed spatial pattern and\ntemporally low-pass filtered sequences in a binocular rivalry paradigm. Thus, not only was the\neffect of information predictability was modest and spatial, but it was also dependent on the\npresence of higher temporal frequencies. Together, the results demonstrate the significance of\nlow-level properties in affecting CFS dynamics and the possible involvement of pattern structure\nmasking in CFS.\n",

To chart the boundaries of processing outside of awareness,\nthose of us who study perception exploit phenomena in which ordinarily detectable sensory\nstimuli are rendered undetectable. In the case of vision, there are a number of phenomena\nthat entail just this characteristic and, thus, provide us with psychophysical tools for\nrendering the ordinarily visible invisible (Breitmeyer, 2014; Kim & Blake, 2005). Among those\nprocedures for dissociating seeing and awareness are visual masking (Breitmeyer & Ogmen,\n2000), motion-induced blindness (Bonneh, Cooperman, & Sagi, 2001), inattentional blindness\nindependently described a particularly potent means for rendering an interesting, complex\nmonocularly viewed stimulus invisible for many seconds at a time. Unlike binocular rivalry,\nthis variant of interocular suppression entails presenting an animation consisting of rapidly\nchanging series of geometric figures to one eye while simultaneously presenting a target\nstimulus to the corresponding retinal area of the other eye. In the version created by Fang\nand He, the successive animation frames comprised a random array of tiny squares, while the\nversion created by Tsuchiya and Koch comprised successively presented coloured rectangles\n(a.k.a. Mondrians). With either configuration, the result was almost always immediate and\nrelatively prolonged suppression of the target by the dynamic series of images, leading\nTsuchiya and Koch to dub the technique continuous flash suppression (CFS). This\ncompelling form of interocular suppression quickly caught the imagination of vision\nscientists interested in perceptual processing outside of awareness, spawning a slew of\npsychophysical papers utilising CFS to address that topic (see reviews by Gayet, Van der\nStigchel, & Paffen, 2014; Sterzer, Stein, Ludwig, Rothkirch, & Hesselmann, 2014; Yang,\nBrascamp, Kang, & Blake, 2014). In addition, human brain imaging studies have deployed\nCFS to study the mode of action of CFS on neural activity within visual cortex (Watanabe\nOne lesson growing out of all of this work is an appreciation that CFS does not work with\nequal effectiveness for all participants (e.g., see the series of studies by Sklar et al., 2012,\nwhere results from up to 50% of participants had to be omitted because of insufficient depth\nof CFS suppression). As Vadillo, Konstantinidis, and Shanks (2016) have argued, this kind of\nrejection of false-positive data raises statistical issues that can compromise conclusions from\nstudies on unconscious processing. One way to minimise the problem is to use calibration\nprocedures to establish CFS and target parameters that produce uniform depth of\nsuppression among all participants (see Han & Alais, 2018; Hesselmann, Darcy, Rothkirch,\n& Sterzer, in press). At the same time, it is important to establish the boundary conditions\ngoverning the maximum effectiveness of CFS. To date, the majority of investigations utilising\nCFS have employed variants of the configurations introduced by Fang and He (2005) and\nTsuchiya and Koch (2005), namely a dynamic mask consisting of an ever-changing stream of\ntexture arrays flashed one after the other at a rate of 10 frames/second (10 Hz).\nOn the belief that good workers benefit from understanding their tools, we and others have\nendeavoured to explore factors that contribute to the effectiveness of CFS. Thus, it is now known\nthat CFS potency varies with the spatial frequency of the masker (Willenbockel, Lepore, Nguyen,\nBouthillier, & Gosselin, 2012; Yang & Blake, 2012), the contrast of the masker (Han, Lunghi, &\nthe masker (Zhu, Drewes, & Melcher, 2016) and the temporal frequency content of the masker\n(Han, Blake & Alais, 2018; Han et al., 2016). Previous CFS-masked priming experiments also\nreported shorter response times to tool probes when elongated prime stimuli were used (Almeida\net al., 2014), but these results might have been partially influenced by image leakages in anaglyph\nglasses and response time variability to the different probe stimuli (Hesselmann, Darcy, Rothkirch,\n& Sterzer, 2018). Another factor impacting CFS potency is repeated testing: The strength of\nsuppression tends to wane with repeated testing, as evidenced by the propensity for a target to\nbreach CFS suppression earlier and earlier over repeated trials (Blake, Goodman, Tomarken, &\nKim, in preparation; Ludwig, Sterzer, Kathmann, Franz, & Hesselmann, 2013). This latter\nobservation led us to wonder whether the predictability of the dynamics of the CFS sequence\nmight have an impact on the strength of CFS, and this is the idea tested in the experiments\ndescribed in this article.\nThe present study was inspired by the concept of entropy (Shannon, 1948), as it has been\napplied to other aspects of visual perception (e.g., see Gilden, Hiris, & Blake, 1995; Lee,\nBlake, & Lee, 2009). Expressed mathematically, entropy is a quantity related to the Poisson\nrate parameter associated with a given time series. In simple terms, entropy is an expression\nof predictability, where successive events unfolding regularly over time have low entropy,\nwhereas successive events occurring irregularly have higher values of entropy. The entropy\nvalue would depend on the number of alternative random event states and their relative\nprobabilities, but as rule of thumb, entropy is inversely proportional to predictability.\nViewed within an entropy framework, the commonly used CFS masking stimulus of a\nseries of random spatial Mondrian patterns presented at a rate of 10 Hz has low entropy\nin the temporal domain, as changes will occur predictably every 100 ms, and high entropy in\nthe spatial domain, as each new Mondrian pattern in the sequence is random and unrelated\nto its predecessor. In this study, we have examined the consequences of manipulating\ntemporal and spatial entropy on the potency of CFS, as assessed by its suppression of a\ncontralateral bullseye target over a 1-minute viewing period. This allowed us to measure the\ninitial strength of suppression as typically recorded in breaking-CFS studies (Jiang, Costello,\ncharacterise masker effectiveness over a longer period of time. All experiments described in\nthis study adopted a dominance tracking paradigm that is used in previous CFS (Tsuchiya &\nAndrews & Blakemore, 2002; Brascamp, van Eee, Noest, Jacobs, & van den Berg, 2006;\nExperiments 1 and 2: The Regularity of Pattern Changes\nThese experiments asked if the regularity of Mondrian pattern changes affects the dynamics\nof CFS. As shown in Figure 1(a), two types of temporal schedules were compared in\nExperiment 1: Regular pattern updates every 100 ms or irregular pattern update periods\nvarying around an average of 100 ms. These temporal schedules were then temporally low-\npass filtered (<4 Hz) and compared in Experiment 2. This was to ascertain the influence of\ntemporal irregularity, as the irregular update schedule contained longer periods of stationary\npatterns that could potentially weaken suppression through increased neural adaptation\n(Alais et al., 2010). By low-pass filtering the temporal schedules, we retained the\noccurrence of pattern changes but standardised the dominant temporal frequency content\n(Han et al., 2016, 2018), while producing a continuously varying pixel luminance timeline.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants. Recruitment and testing were conducted in the University of Sydney and\nVanderbilt University. As we were interested in evaluating the practical usefulness of\nHan et al. 3\nFigure 1. Stimuli used in this study. (a) Presentation schedules used in Experiments 1 and 2. Patterns were\n100 ms). The original temporally unfiltered sequences were used in Experiment 1, whereas the sequences were\ntemporally low-pass filtered in Experiment 2. (b) Maskers used in Experiments 3 and 4. Three types of maskers\nwere used to produce different degrees of spatial and temporal entropy. The standard masker was updated with\na different pattern every 100 ms, meaning that it had random luminance and spatial pattern profiles (i.e., high\nspatial and temporal entropy). The fixed masker was a single pattern sequence that had the same temporal\ntimeline as the standard masker, and as such, had low spatial entropy. The sine masker was also a single pattern\nsequence, with the exception that it modulated regularly (and more predictably than the fixed masker) at 2 Hz.\n(c) Maskers used in Experiment 5. The Standard and Fixed sequences from Experiments 3 and 4 were pitted\nagainst temporally low-pass filtered Mondrian sequences in rivalry paradigm. The patterns were composed of\nrectangles instead of squares. (d) Stimulus presentation for each trial. For Experiments 1 to 4, each trial begins\nwith a 30-s adaptation phase of spatial noise composed of 0.5 by 0.5 squares, followed by the dichoptic\npresentation of a Mondrian sequence and a 1 cycle per degree, grey scale bullseye target. For Experiment 5,\nhowever, the target was replaced by a Mondrian sequence. Participants were asked to track the appearance of\nthe target (Experiments 1\u00ad4) or the perceptual dominance of either Mondrian sequence (Experiment 5). All\nvisual stimuli were enclosed with a fusion frame, which is shown to both eyes to encourage binocular fusion.\nThe presentation of the visual stimuli was fixed within a trial but randomised between eyes across trials.\nentropy in providing effective interocular suppression, we determined our sample size based\non previous work, where the estimated effect sizes with 7 to 11 participants were 0.55 to 0.84\nusing partial eta-squared (Han et al., 2016). Thus, a total of 11 participants were recruited for\nExperiment 1, of which 8 of them (5 females), including two of the authors (R. B. and S. H.),\nalso took part in Experiment 2. Two other participants (one female) only participated in\nExperiment 2, giving a total of 10 participants in Experiment 2. All participants had normal\nor corrected-to-normal eyesight, and tested normal for stereovision, with the Randot Stereo\nTest or the Fly Stereo Acuity Test. Experiments accorded with the Declaration of Helsinki\nand were approved by the institutional review board of the University of Sydney and\nVanderbilt University. All participants provided informed consent and were reimbursed\nfor their time.\nVisual stimuli. Masker stimuli were dynamic sequences of randomly generated 4 by 4 grey\nscale Mondrian pattern images composed of squares ranging from 0.6 to 1.2 in length.\nThese sequences were updated in a temporally regular or irregular manner. Temporally\nregular sequences in Experiment 1 were updated every 100 ms, whereas irregular sequences\nwere updated at intervals randomly selected from a pre-determined set of temporal intervals\nwere temporally low-pass filtered in frequency space. A three-dimensional fast Fourier\ntransform was first performed on each pattern sequence, followed by the application of a\nlow-pass temporal filter (<4 Hz) to the amplitude spectrum in the temporal dimension, with\nno manipulation of the orthogonal spatial dimensions. The filtered spectral components were\nthen back-transformed to image space. In each trial, the Mondrian sequence lasted 60 s,\nhad a root mean square (RMS) contrast of approximately 20% and was normalised to mean\nluminance.\nThe target was a two-dimensional bullseye (Figure 1(b)), generated by computing a\nconcentric sinusoidal grating with a spatial frequency of 1 cycle per degree and a radius of\n3.3 visual angle. To avoid afterimages in the suppressed eye (Gilroy & Blake, 2005), the\ntarget was phase modulated at a rate of 0.125 Hz throughout the duration of dichoptic\nstimulation for each trial. During the experiment, the target was presented at 30% of\nmaximum contrast, and the masker was set to full RMS contrast. These values were\nsubjectively adjusted for two participants, who reported no target breakthrough with the\naforementioned settings. Higher bullseye contrasts were used for these participants as a\nresult. To encourage stable fusion, a fusion frame with an internal width of 4 and an\nexternal length of 6.5 was used to enclose all visual stimuli. Visual stimuli were displayed\nto participants using a ViewSonic PS225f or Triniton Dell CRT monitor (resolution\nmonitor (resolution 800 \u00c2 600 pixels) was used at Vanderbilt University. All visual\ndisplays were gamma-corrected and had a screen rate of 100 Hz.\nProcedure. Participants viewed the stimuli through a mirror stereoscope. To ensure that the\ndichoptic images were fused, each individual first completed a calibration task where the\nperceived spatial positions of two 4 by 4 by 0.3 thick square frames were aligned using key\npresses to nudge the location of one of them vertically or horizontally. Following that,\nparticipants commenced the CFS task. Each trial began with a prompt to initiate stimulus\npresentation with a key press, after which participants were adapted to a 30 s sequence of\nnoise images (composed of 0.5 by 0.5 squares, normalised to mean luminance: see Figure 1).\nPost-adaptation, the masker was presented at the same contrast as in adaptation, whereas the\ntarget's contrast was gradually increased to the preset target contrast over a period of 800 ms.\nHan et al. 5\nBoth target and masker were presented on the screen for 60 s, during which participants were\nasked to press a key when any part of the target became visible and to hold it down for as\nlong as it remained visible. Each trial thus provided the respective dominance durations of\nthe Mondrian masker and the target, and the number of target breakthroughs.\nAll participants were instructed to fixate on the central cross throughout the duration of\neach trial and were given ample practice to familiarise with the task demands. To avoid inter-\ntrial effects between the experimental conditions, the effects of irregular and regular pattern\nupdate schedules were tested in counterbalanced blocks. Each block consisted of four trials\nthat were counterbalanced for the eye of presentation (i.e., each eye received the masker two\ntimes in each block). Each individual thus completed a total of eight trials (four for each eye)\nfor each condition.\nAnalysis. Three dependent measures were computed from each individual's data set, namely,\nthe time to first target breakthrough, the average number of target breakthroughs and\nmasker predominance. Prior to computing the dependent measures, the dominance\ndurations of the Mondrian masker were first normalised to the overall average duration.\nWe then extracted the normalised time to first target breakthrough (henceforth referred to as\nnormalised suppression duration) and computed the average for each condition. This was\nsynonymous with the time to visibility measured in previous breaking-CFS studies (e.g., Jiang\net al., 2007) and reflected the strength of the initial suppression. The average number of target\nbreakthroughs and average masker predominance reflected the overall masker effectiveness\nover the course of the trial. For each condition, we computed the average number of target\nbreakthroughs and averaged masker predominance, defined as the total proportion of\nviewing time in a trial where the Mondrian was perceptually dominant (see also Brascamp,\nKlink, & Levelt, 2015). Individual data points were plotted for all dependent measures and\nwere also summarised with the median and median absolute deviation of the between-\nsubjects data points (see Figure 2). Pairwise comparisons were conducted with the non-\nparametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test computed using the Hollander and Wolfe (1973)\nmethod in the statistical program R (R Core Team, 2017). This method uses the\nparameter V, which is obtained by first computing the difference between the data\ncompared, and then summing the ranks assigned to positive differences.\nResults\nThe results of Experiments 1 and 2 are summarised in Figure 2(a) and (b), respectively.\nIndividual data points, each representing the average normalised suppression duration\n(left panels of Figure 2), average number of target breakthroughs or average masker\npredominance of each participant, are plotted for both experiments. Given the variability\nin individual data points, the median was used to represent the central tendencies of the\ndifferent dependent measures. As shown in Figure 2(a), manipulating the temporal regularity\nof pattern updates in Experiment 1 produced comparable normalised suppression durations,\nmasker predominance and number of target breakthroughs. The same conclusions are also\nreflected statistically, where we obtained no significant differences in normalised suppression\ndurations, V \u00bc 21, p \u00bc .32, masker predominance, V \u00bc 43, p \u00bc .41 and number of target\nbreakthroughs, V \u00bc 35.5, p \u00bc .41 (corrected for continuity).\nSimilarly, in Experiment 2, low-pass filtered regular and irregular pattern sequences\nproduced comparable normalised suppression durations, masker predominance and target\nbreakthrough frequencies (Figure 2(b)). Despite controlling for differences in temporal frequency\ncontent, pattern update regularity did not significantly affect the initial breakthrough time of\nCFS, V \u00bc 33, p\u00bc .63. In addition, update regularity did not have a significant influence on the\noverall masker effectiveness over prolonged periods of time, V\u00bc 37, p\u00bc .38. Similarly, the\nnumber of target breakthroughs was also not significantly different between the two types of\npattern sequences, V\u00bc 10, p\u00bc .16 (corrected for continuity).\nDiscussion for Experiments 1 and 2\nIn Experiments 1 and 2, we varied the regularity of pattern updates to learn whether\ndifference in temporal entropy has an effect on CFS effectiveness. Irregular and regular\nupdate schedules were compared in Experiment 1, and the comparison was repeated with\ntemporally low-pass filtered schedules in Experiment 2. Three dependent measures were\ncollected, namely, the time to first target breakthrough, number of target breakthroughs\nand masker predominance. Initial breakthrough times were synonymous with previous\nbreaking-CFS studies (e.g., Jiang et al., 2007) and reflected the effectiveness of the initial\nFigure 2. Results of Experiments 1 and 2. From left to right, the three panels show results for the average\nnormalised time to the first target breakthrough, average number of target breakthroughs and average\nmasker predominance. (a) Experiment 1: results for unfiltered Mondrians. The distributions of individual data\npoints, the median and the median absolute deviation (denoted by error bars) were plotted. None of the\ndependent measures was significantly influenced by the regularity of pattern update, as the data sets for both\ntypes of pattern update had comparable medians and considerable variability. (b) Experiment 2: results for\nlow-pass filtered Mondrians. Similar to Experiment 1, the data sets for both types of update schedules have\nconsiderable variability and comparable medians and do not differ on any of the dependent measures. These\nresults indicate that the regularity of pattern update has no effect on CFS dynamics, and that the lack of\nsignificant effects is not confounded by neural adaptation, which conceivably could have played a stronger role\nin the temporally unfiltered, irregular update schedule.\nHan et al. 7\nsuppression. On the other hand, the average number of target breakthroughs and masker\npredominance tapped into the effectiveness of suppression over a prolonged period of time.\nOur results showed that in neither experiment did pattern update regularity have a significant\neffect on any of the three dependent measures.\nOne possible reason for the absence of an effect of entropy was that the irregular and\nregular pattern update schedules had different temporal frequency content. We doubt this\nwas the case, as Fourier analyses revealed comparable temporal frequency content between\nthe two types of schedules in Experiment 1 (Figure 3(a)). Moreover, similar results were\nobtained when the temporally low-pass filtered maskers were used in Experiment 2.\nInstead, it seemed more likely that our manipulation of entropy was inadequate,\nproducing perhaps a subtle change in predictability that was easily obscured by subjective\nsources of variability such as participant decisional criteria (Yang et al., 2014). Figure 3(b)\nillustrates this point. Each pattern update in the Mondrian masker was accompanied by\nchanges in spatiotemporal information. With every new pattern, spatial elements of the\nMondrian masker vary in location, contour shapes and size (Figure 3(b), upper panel).\nTemporal changes were also stochastic, though more predictable than spatial changes\nas the differences in luminance between patterns tended to be of a smaller magnitude\n(Figure 3(b), lower panel). By influencing the temporal dimension with variations in the\nupdate schedules in Experiments 1 and 2, we ignored a potentially important source of\ninformation entropy. Instead, we varied a dimension that had more predictable outcomes.\nFigure 3. Properties of the Mondrian maskers. (a) The effect of pattern update regularity on the temporal\nfrequency spectrum of the Mondrian masker. Amplitude spectra shown were obtained by conducting a one-\ndimensional fast Fourier transform on pixel timelines of the irregular and regular Mondrian sequences. Both\ntypes of sequences have a characteristic 1/f profile, which were comparable in low (<4 Hz) and high (>4 Hz)\nfrequency content, assessed with the average area under the curve estimated from 10 independently drawn\npixel timelines. (b) Spatial and temporal entropy in the Mondrian masker. As shown in the upper panel, spatial\nchanges between patterns were unpredictable, varying in luminance, size and configuration for a given patch\nof pixels in the Mondrian masker. On the other hand, temporal entropy (lower panel) was limited by the\nnormal distribution of luminance changes between pattern updates, as most pixel changes were of a smaller\nmagnitude.\nIn the following experiments, we adopted a more comprehensive definition of entropy that\ninvolves both the spatial and temporal domains.\nExperiments 3 and 4: The Effect of Spatiotemporal Entropy\nExperiments 1 and 2 failed to yield any conclusive evidence regarding the effect of temporal\nregularity on the dynamics of CFS, leading us to wonder whether our manipulation of\nentropy was adequate. We thus defined predictability more comprehensively in\nExperiments 3 and 4, this time focusing on changes in spatial patterns and pixel\nluminance. Three types of maskers were compared, namely, a standard 10 Hz Mondrian\nmasker (Standard), a single Mondrian pattern that modulated in luminance sinusoidally at\n2 Hz (Sine) or had pixel luminance timelines extracted from a regular Mondrian (Fixed). Of\nthese maskers, the standard masker had the highest spatial and temporal uncertainty and\ntherefore the highest entropy in both dimensions. The sine masker, given the use of the single\npattern and periodic changes in luminance, had the lowest spatial and temporal uncertainty\nand thus lowest entropy. The predictability of the fixed masker lay in between, as it had low\nspatial entropy but with the same stochastic changes in luminance as the standard masker.\nFor the target stimulus, we chose a phase modulation rate of 0.125 Hz in Experiment 3 and a\nrate of 4 Hz in Experiment 4. These values were chosen because the slower target rate was a\nbetter match to temporal frequency content of all three types of maskers (i.e., 2 Hz sine\nmaskers and 1/f spectrum for the standard and fixed maskers), allowing us to test if\nentropy provides a suppressive advantage beyond that of temporal frequency selectivity\n(Han & Alais, 2018). Given that pixel luminance changes between Mondrian patterns\ntended to cluster around smaller magnitudes in the standard masker, as shown in the\nlower panel of Figure 3(b), we expected the manipulation of spatial entropy to have a\nlarger effect on suppression, for both temporally similar and dissimilar targets.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants. Recruitment and testing were conducted in the University of Sydney and\nVanderbilt University. The required sample size was determined using the same criteria as\nExperiments 1 and 2. Five participants (four females), including author S. H., participated in\nExperiments 3 and 4. Six other participants (three females) only took part in Experiment 3,\nand another five participants (three females) only participated in Experiment 4. All\nparticipants had normal or corrected-to-normal eyesight, and tested normal for\nstereovision, with the Randot Stereo Test or the Fly Stereo Acuity Test. Experiments\naccorded with the Declaration of Helsinki and were approved by the institutional review\nboards of the University of Sydney and of Vanderbilt University. All participants provided\ninformed consent and were reimbursed for their time.\nVisual stimuli. Three types of masker stimuli were used in Experiments 3 and 4. They were\ndynamic sequences of Mondrian patterns (Standard) that were updated every 100 ms, single\nMondrian patterns that modulated in luminance sinusoidally at 2 Hz (Sine) or single\nMondrian patterns that had the same pixel luminance timeline as the Standard Mondrian\nsequence (Fixed). All Mondrian patterns used in these experiments were grey scale, 4 by 4\nin size and composed of squares ranging from 0.6 to 1.2 in length. As in the previous\nexperiments, each sequence lasted for 60 s in each trial, had a RMS contrast of\napproximately 20% and was normalised to mean luminance. The bullseye target from\nExperiments 1 and 2 was used in Experiments 3 and 4, with the exception that the target\nHan et al. 9\nwas presented at a lower contrast (20% instead of 30% of maximum RMS contrast) and\nphase-modulated at a rate of 4 Hz in Experiment 4. All visual stimuli were enclosed with\nframes measuring of 4 internally and 6.5 externally to encourage stable fusion. The same\ndisplay apparatuses from Experiments 1 and 2 were used to present the visual stimuli.\nProcedure. The same procedures from Experiments 1 and 2 were used in Experiments 3 and 4.\nAnalysis. The data sets were prepared in the same manner as in Experiments 1 and 2.\nSimilarly, non-parametric statistical approaches such as Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and\nFriedman tests were used to assess pairwise comparisons and main effects, respectively.\nResults\nThe results of Experiments 3 and 4 are illustrated in Figure 4. As in the previous experiments,\nindividual data points are plotted to show the average normalised suppression duration,\naverage masker predominance and average number of target breakthroughs for each\nparticipant. Central tendencies of each dependent measure are also represented by the\nrespective medians. As shown in Figure 4(a), fixed maskers produced lower masker\npredominance and normalised suppression durations than the sine and standard maskers.\nNormalised suppression durations were approximately 10% to 30% lower, and the fixed\nmasker dominated approximately 11% less amount of viewing time than the other two\nmaskers. The number of target breakthroughs, however, was comparable across all three\nmaskers. These observations were assessed with the Friedman test, a non-parametric version\nof the one-way repeated-measures analysis of variance. The results reveal no significant main\neffects of masker type on normalised suppression durations and number of target\ndid affect masker predominance significantly, 2(2) \u00bc 7.8, p \u00bc .02. The effect of masker type\non masker predominance was assessed using Holm-Bonferroni corrected Wilcoxon signed-\nrank tests. We found that the presence of uncertain spatial information in the standard\nmasker produced a significantly higher predominance than the fixed masker, V \u00bc 51,\np \u00bc .03, but the effect seemed contingent on the use of the stepped timeline in the fixed\nmasker. This was because the predominance of the sine and standard maskers were\nstatistically no different, V \u00bc 32, p \u00bc .70. In addition, the sine masker had a significantly\nhigher predominance than the fixed masker, V \u00bc 5, p \u00bc .02, even though the latter had a\nbroader temporal frequency spectrum.\nThe results of Experiment 3 suggest a modest effect of spatial entropy on masker\npredominance, which we tested with a less compatible, 4 Hz target in Experiment 4.\nFigure 4(b) shows that the median masker predominance is approximately 7% higher for\nthe standard masker than the other two maskers. However, compared with Experiment 3\n(Figure 4(a)), the distribution of individual data points for masker predominance is\nnoticeably more variable across all three maskers. For normalised suppression durations,\nsuppression was approximately 40% longer when the standard masker was used. Compared\nwith the sine and standard maskers, target breakthroughs were approximately 14% higher\nwhen the fixed masker was presented. None of these observations is statistically significant.\nMasker type did not affect the normalised suppression duration, 2(2) \u00bc 3.8, p \u00bc .15, and had\nno significant effect on target breakthrough frequency, 2(2) \u00bc 4.7, p \u00bc .10. Despite the presence\nof both spatial and temporal entropy in the standard masker, masker type had no significant\neffect on masker predominance, 2(2) \u00bc 4.2, p \u00bc .12. Thus, the effect of spatial entropy appears\nto depend on the presence of compatible target or masker temporal frequency content.\nDiscussion for Experiments 3 and 4\nWe had reasoned that our manipulation of entropy in Experiments 1 and 2 might have been\ntoo simplified in focusing only on the temporal dimension. Thus, in Experiments 3 and 4, we\nadopted a broader manipulation of entropy, taking into account the predictability of the\nspatial and temporal content. Three types of Mondrian maskers were used, namely, the\nstandard 10 Hz Mondrian pattern sequences (Standard), single Mondrian pattern maskers\nwith the same pixel luminance timeline as the standard Mondrian (Fixed) and single patterns\nthat modulated sinusoidally in luminance at 2 Hz (Sine). To assess the extent of any possible\neffects of entropy, target rates that were similar to the maskers (0.125 Hz, Experiment 3) and\ndissimilar to the maskers (4 Hz, Experiment 4) were used. Because pixel luminance changes\nbetween Mondrian patterns tended to be of a smaller magnitude (Figure 3(c)), we expected\nspatial entropy to have a larger effect on suppression than temporal entropy, regardless of the\nFigure 4. Results of Experiments 3 and 4. From left to right, the three panels show results for the\nnormalised time to the first target breakthrough, average number of target breakthrough and masker\npredominance. (a) Experiment 3: the effect of spatial and temporal entropy on the suppression of a 0.125 Hz\ntarget. The bar graphs represent the distributions of data points, the median and the median absolute\ndeviation (denoted by error bars). The average number of target breakthroughs and normalised suppression\ndurations was not significantly influenced by the regularity of pattern update, as the data sets for both types of\npattern update had comparable medians and considerable variability. On the other hand, the predominance of\nthe fixed masker was significantly lower than that of the sine and standard maskers. As there was no\nsignificant difference between the sine and standard maskers, the predominance results demonstrate the\nimportance of spatial entropy in stepped timelines. (b) Experiment 4: the effect of spatial and temporal\nentropy on the suppression of a 4 Hz target. Although the standard masker produced slightly longer\nnormalised times to first target breakthrough and larger masker predominance than the other two maskers,\nnone of the dependent measures was significantly affected by entropy. Error bars represent the median\nabsolute deviation of individual data points.\ntarget modulation rate. Although we did find a significantly larger predominance for the\nstandard masker than the fixed masker in Experiment 3, performance was comparable\nbetween standard and sine maskers, indicating that the effect was limited to maskers with\nstepped timelines. This weak influence of entropy was further demonstrated in Experiment 4,\nwhere the use of the less compatible, 4 Hz target resulted in a null result for all three\ndependent measures. Together, the results of Experiments 3 and 4 did not support a\nsubstantial influence of entropy in CFS.\nDifferences in individual contrast sensitivity and decisional criteria in determining target\nvisibility (Yang et al., 2014) might have contributed to the variability in the data, reducing\nstatistical power as a result. Also, it is possible that the extent to which entropy affects CFS\ncould be better estimated by measuring suppression depth or target contrast thresholds over\ntime. However, we have observed that comparisons of contrast thresholds and suppression\ndurations in CFS show a high correlation (Han & Alais, 2018), and we conclude it is more\nlikely for weaker effects to be obscured by between-subject variability. Instead, lower level\nfactors seemed to have a larger influence on CFS than entropy. To elaborate, periods of\nconstant illumination in a masker with a stepped update schedule meant that the fixed and\nstandard maskers were more susceptible to neural adaptation. As mentioned earlier,\nincreasing neural adaptation weakens interocular suppression (Alais et al., 2010).\nThus, any loss in suppressive strength over prolonged periods of time might have been\npartially compensated by the presence of spatial uncertainty in the standard masker. With\na continuously varying luminance timeline, such compensation was not necessary for the sine\nmasker, explaining why the standard and sine maskers were comparable in performance in\nExperiment 3. In addition, since the 4 Hz target in Experiment 4 was temporally less\ncompatible to all three maskers, the failure to observe a significant effect of spatial entropy\nin Experiment 4 underscores the weak influence of spatial entropy and the importance of low-\nlevel factors such temporal frequency selectivity compared with spatial entropy.\nPrevious studies have suggested the involvement of adaptation (Tsuchiya & Koch, 2005)\nbut see Ananyev, Penney, & Hsieh, 2017), and it was not surprising that these factors might\ncontribute to our results. More interestingly, was the nature in which spatial entropy\ncontributed to CFS. As the effect of spatial entropy was limited to the use of stepped\npattern presentation schedules, one possible mechanism was pattern structure masking.\nTo expand on this point, masking effectiveness was reported to increase with shorter\ntemporal intervals (Enns & Di Lollo, 2000) and sharp temporal onsets (Macknik,\nMartinez-Conde, & Haglund, 2000). The transient, unpredictable phase congruency\nchanges in the standard masker fit this bill, suggesting that the effect of spatial entropy\nwas probably dependent on the presence of higher temporal frequencies. In the absence of\nhigher temporal frequencies (e.g., sine masker), spatial entropy was not particularly\nimportant in CFS and vice versa (e.g., fixed masker). Alternatively, the apparent link\nbetween spatial entropy and higher temporal frequencies might be a consequence of our\nCFS stimulus choices. In common with most CFS studies, our stimuli involved a high-\ncontrast masker and a low-contrast target, resulting in a significant imbalance of stimulus\nstrength between the two eyes. The imbalance in contrast has been shown to be crucial to\nCFS suppression (Han et al., 2016; Tsuchiya & Koch, 2005), and combined with other low-\nlevel influences such as feature selectivity, any contributions from entropy on the CFS\nprocess might have been limited by the strong existing suppression of the target. Thus,\ninstead of a relationship between spatial entropy and temporal frequency content, the\neffect of spatial entropy might have been more easily revealed in the stepped schedules\nbecause of greater adaptation. Finally, a third possibility was that entropy had a weak\ninfluence on interocular suppression and would remain so regardless of the distribution of\nstimulus strength between the eyes. To tease apart these possibilities, we would have to\neliminate the imbalance in contrast, and one way to do so would be to have the maskers\ncompete directly in a binocular rivalry paradigm.\nExperiment 5: Boxing Match Between Mondrian Contenders\nExperiments 3 and 4 revealed a measurable, albeit modest, influence of spatial entropy on\nCFS suppression strength that was limited to the use of stepped presentation schedules. As\nthe stepped pattern presentations (i.e., fixed and standard maskers) had 1/f, broadband\ntemporal frequency spectrums (cf. Figure 3 and Han et al., 2016), the results suggested a\nrelationship between spatial entropy and the low energy, higher temporal frequency content.\nHere, we examined this relationship by pitting three pairings of standard, fixed and low-pass\nfiltered ( < 4 Hz) Mondrian sequences against each other in a rivalry paradigm. By\ndetermining which sequence would be perceptually dominant, this approach allowed us to\nre-examine the effect of entropy in the absence of the contrast imbalance typically used in\nCFS studies (e.g., Tsuchiya & Koch, 2005; Yang & Blake, 2012). Second, evaluating the\neffectiveness of the maskers against each other was a more direct way of assessing entropy's\nrole in interocular suppression. Third, as the low-pass sequence retained spatial entropy,\npitting the continuously varying low-pass filtered Mondrian sequence against the fixed and\nstandard sequences allowed us to test the relationship between spatial entropy and higher\ntemporal frequencies. To draw a light-hearted analogy, the rivalry task was colloquially\nreferred to as a boxing match. Since there were three combinations of competing\nMondrian sequences (i.e., standard vs. fixed, standard vs. low-pass and fixed vs. low-pass),\na total of three matches were conducted in Experiment 5. Examples of the different Mondrian\nsequences are provided (see movies: Vertical Standard, Vertical Fixed and Vertical Low-Pass).\nPerceptual judgments were only possible if the competing maskers were discriminable. We\nthus generated Mondrian pattern sequences composed of either horizontal or vertical\nrectangles. During the experiment, the orientation of each sequence was presented\northogonally to the competing sequence in the other eye. Assuming that the results in\nExperiments 3 and 4 did reflect pattern structure masking, we predicted that spatial\nentropy should have a larger effect on rivalling dynamics when it is paired with higher\ntemporal frequency content. Thus, when pitted against either the low-pass or fixed\nsequence, the standard sequence was expected to dominate the boxing match. In contrast,\nrivalling the fixed and low-pass sequences were expected to produce a draw, since neither\nsequence contained rapidly varying pattern contours and shapes.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants. Recruitment and testing were conducted at the University of Sydney and\nVanderbilt University. The required sample size was determined using the same criteria as\nthe previous experiments. Seven participants (five females) participated in Experiment 5. All\nparticipants had normal or corrected-to-normal eyesight, and tested normal for stereovision,\nwith the Randot Stereo Test or the Fly Stereo Acuity Test. Experiments accorded with the\nDeclaration of Helsinki and were approved by the institutional review board of Vanderbilt\nUniversity. All participants provided informed consent and were reimbursed for their time.\nVisual stimuli. Each Mondrian pattern was made up of horizontally or vertically oriented\nwere grey scale and measured 4 by 4 in size. The standard and fixed Mondrian sequences\nwere generated with the same procedure as Experiments 3 and 4, and the low-pass sequence\nwas generated using the same low-pass filtering procedure used in Experiment 2. All\nMondrian sequences were set to maximum contrast (RMS \u00bc 25%), normalised to mean\nluminance and were presented equally in both orientations. To produce binocular rivalry,\nwe ensured there was always an interocular spatial conflict by presenting the vertical\nrectangles to one eye and the horizontal rectangles to the other. As in previous\nexperiments, all visual stimuli were enclosed with frames measuring of 4 internally and\n6.1 externally to encourage stable fusion. The same display apparatus from Vanderbilt\nUniversity was used to present the visual stimuli.\nProcedure. The procedures followed in Experiment 5 were largely similar to the previous\nexperiments, with the exception that the rivalling stimuli were presented for 90 s instead of\n60 s. Participants pressed the left arrow key while they saw a horizontal rivalling stimulus,\nand the right arrow key while they saw the vertically oriented stimulus. Each trial thus\nprovided the respective dominance durations of each Mondrian sequence and the number\nof alternations. Periods of piecemeal rivalry were not recorded. As with the previous\nexperiments, participants were instructed to maintain fixation on the centre cross\nthroughout the duration of each trial and were given ample practice to familiarise with the\ntask demands. To avoid inter-trial effects between the experimental conditions, each pair of\ncompeting Mondrian patterns was presented in counterbalanced blocks. The pairs presented\nwere the standard and fixed sequences, the standard and low-pass sequences or the fixed and\nlow-pass sequences. Each block consisted of four trials that were counterbalanced for the eye\nof presentation (i.e., each eye received each sequence twice in each block). Each individual\nthus completed a total of eight trials (four for each eye) for each condition.\nAnalysis. Each boxing match involved rivalling a specific pair of Mondrian sequences (e.g.,\nlow-pass vs. fixed or standard vs. fixed). Thus, the winning Mondrian sequence of a specific\nmatch was determined by its overall predominance and mean dominance duration across all\ntrials. Prior to computing these dependent measures, we normalised the dominance durations\nof each Mondrian sequence to the average dominance duration of each match. As in the\nprevious experiments, we determined a sequence's predominance for each trial by computing\nthe proportion of its dominance out of the total viewing time. The respective predominance\nvalues were then averaged across trials and compared against the competing sequence using\nthe Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Similarly, mean dominance durations were computed for each\ntrial and then averaged across trials for each competing sequence. To compare the dynamics\nof each match, the number of perceptual alternations of each match was averaged across\ntrials and statistically assessed with the Friedman's test. Finally, as the human sensitivity to\nhorizontal and vertical lengths has been reported to differ (Gottsdanker & Tietz, 1992), we\ncompared the predominance and mean dominance durations of vertically and horizontally\noriented sequences.\nResults\nThe predominance and mean dominance duration results of each match are summarised in\nFigure 5. As in the previous experiments, individual data points representing the average\npredominance and mean dominance duration for each participant are shown for all three\nmatches. Figure 5(a) reveals that the standard Mondrian sequence dominated perception for\na larger proportion of the viewing time than the low-pass and fixed sequences, that is, 14%\nand 30% higher in median predominance, respectively. On the other hand, when low-pass and\nfixed sequences were pitted against each other, both sequences dominated comparable\nproportions of the viewing time (approximately 40% to 50% each). Similar trends were\nobserved with mean dominance durations (Figure 5(b)), and our observations corroborated\nwith the statistical results. Compared with the low-pass and fixed sequences, the standard\nsequence had a significantly longer predominance, V \u00bc 28, p \u00bc .02 for both, and a\nsignificantly larger mean dominance duration, V \u00bc 28, p \u00bc .02 and V \u00bc 28, p \u00bc .03,\nrespectively. No significant differences were observed between low-pass and fixed sequences\nfor predominance, V \u00bc 8, p \u00bc .34, and mean dominance duration, V \u00bc 15, p \u00bc .94.\nSupplementary analyses showed that the standard sequence had a comparable advantage\nover fixed and low-pass sequences. That is, the difference in predominance between the\nstandard and fixed sequences was statistically comparable between that of the standard and\nlow-pass sequences, V \u00bc 19, p \u00bc .47, and the same trend was observed in mean dominance\nFigure 6 summarises the alternation frequencies of each match, the predominance and\nmean dominance of horizontally and vertically oriented patterns. As shown in Figure 6(a),\nFigure 5. Results for the predominance and mean dominance duration in Experiment 5. From the left panel,\nthe boxing match results for each rivalling pair. Rivalling pairs presented were the standard and fixed\nsequences, the standard and low-pass sequences and the fixed and low-pass sequences. (a) Predominance\nresults were summarised as bar graphs, which represent the distributions of data points, the median and the\nmedian absolute deviation (denoted by error bars). The standard sequence had a significantly higher\npredominance than the fixed and low-pass sequences, demonstrating an effect of spatial entropy when the\nsequences were matched in contrast. As predicted, the low-pass and fixed sequences dominated a\ncomparable proportion of the total viewing time, indicating a null effect of temporal entropy. (b) Mean\ndominance duration results. Similar to predominance, the standard sequence had higher mean dominance\ndurations than the low-pass and fixed sequences, and there was no significant difference between the fixed\nand sine sequences.\nthe match between fixed and low-pass sequences had approximately 20% lower number of\nalternations than the other two matches. Collapsed across all three matches, we found that\npredominance and mean dominance were comparable between vertically and horizontally\noriented patterns. Statistical analyses showed that the differences in alternation frequencies\nwere not significant, 2(2) \u00bc 4.6, p \u00bc .10. The predominance and mean dominance duration of\nvertically and horizontally patterns were also not significantly different, V \u00bc 5, p \u00bc .16 and\nDiscussion for Experiment 5\nExperiments 3 and 4 revealed a modest influence of spatial entropy that was only observed\nwith stepped presentation schedules. As stepped presentation schedules have a broadband\ntemporal frequency spectrum, we asked if the effect of spatial entropy was dependent on the\npresence of higher temporal frequency content. In addition, because Experiments 3 and 4 had\nused a large contrast imbalance between the eyes, we questioned if the effect of entropy was\nlimited by the existing strong suppression of the target. To investigate these questions, we\neliminated the contrast imbalance between the eyes in Experiment 5 and pitted standard,\nfixed and low-pass Mondrian sequences against each other in a rivalry paradigm (or boxing\nmatch). Despite the removal of the interocular contrast imbalance, we obtained similar\nresults to Experiments 3 and 4. Specifically, the standard sequence produced significantly\nhigher predominance and mean dominance durations than the fixed sequence.\nThis advantage, however, was not observed when low-pass and standard sequences\nrivalled against each other. The low-pass sequence was less dominant than the standard\nsequence, but it performed comparably to the fixed sequence. Since spatial entropy was\npreserved in the low-pass sequence, the advantage obtained with spatial entropy was\ndependent on the presence of the low energy, high temporal frequency content in the\nstandard masker. We also found no significant differences when we compared\nFigure 6. Results for alternation frequency and orientation in Experiment 5. (a) Alternation frequency for\neach boxing match. The number of perceptual switches was comparable across all three matches,\ndemonstrating that spatial entropy in the standard sequence did not trigger more perceptual switches but\nprolonged mean dominance and predominance (cf. Figure 5). (b) Predominance of vertically and horizontally\noriented pattern sequences. Horizontally oriented patterns were slightly more dominant than vertically\noriented sequences; however, the effect was subtle and not statistically significant. (c) Mean dominance\nduration of vertically and horizontally oriented sequences. Similar to predominance, both orientations had\nstatistically comparable mean dominance durations. The bar graphs illustrated the distributions of data points,\nthe median and the median absolute deviation (denoted by error bars).\nthe alternation rates of the different matches. On some other tasks not involving interocular\ncompetition, sensitivity differences between horizontal and vertical orientations have been\nfound (e.g., length judgments: Gottsdanker & Tietz, 1992), but we saw no evidence that those\northogonal orientations differed in predominance during binocular rivalry. Thus, the main\neffect of spatial entropy was to prolong each period of suppression throughout the course of\nthe viewing time. In addition, this effect was dependent on the higher temporal frequency\ncontent and not likely to be a consequence of pattern orientation.\nCompared with temporally high-pass filtered Mondrian maskers, Han et al. (2018) found\nthat CFS suppression was stronger when temporally low-pass filtered Mondrian maskers\ncontained coherent pattern edges. While these findings argued for a pairing of low temporal\nfrequencies and pattern edges in CFS, note that the study examined suppressive effectiveness\nusing isolated high and low temporal frequency content. By keeping the temporal frequency\ncontent of our Mondrian sequences predominantly biased towards low frequencies, our results\nshowed that the low energy, higher temporal frequencies in the Mondrian masker could\nenhance interocular suppression but only if they were paired with spatial entropy. Without\nspatial entropy, higher temporal frequencies in the fixed sequence did not provide any\nadvantage over the low-pass sequence presumably because of increased adaptation (see Alais\net al., 2010) and inhibitory action from the higher frequencies to the lower frequencies (Cass &\nAlais, 2006). As spatial entropy only provided an advantage when transients were present (cf.\nFigure 5(b)), our results hinted at the presence of pattern structure masking processes (see Enns\n& Di Lollo, 2000; Macknik et al., 2000) which might act in tandem with lower level rivalry\nConclusion\nOne of the important concepts in the early years of cognitive science was the notion of\ninformation entropy. Originating in data communication theory (Shannon, 1948), entropy\nexpresses the simple idea that the predictability of an event is inversely related to its\ninformation content. Expressed even more colloquially, surprising outcomes convey more\ninformation than expected ones (Friston, 2018). We have applied this notion to the analysis\nof monocularly viewed sequences of rapidly presented arrays of image features forming\nanimations used to induce a potent form of interocular suppression dubbed CFS\n(Tsuchiya & Koch, 2005). In particular, we have varied the informational uncertainty, that\nis, the entropy, of CFS sequences in both the space and time domains, in an effort to identify\nthe conditions favouring maximal suppression strength.\nOur results show that temporal entropy has little influence on CFS effectiveness. This is\nperhaps not surprising, as previous work has implicated low temporal rates as optimal for\nCFS effectiveness (Han et al., 2016, 2018), and slow oscillations are predictable and thus low\nin entropy. Increasing the Mondrian refresh rate, however, has been shown to broaden the\ntemporal tuning function of CFS (Tsuchiya & Koch, 2005; Zhu et al., 2016). Had temporal\nentropy been a dominant part of CFS effectiveness, we would expect suppression strength to\nrise with refresh rate because higher refresh rates broaden the temporal frequency spectrum\nand increase its resemblance to white noise. Spatially, we observed measurable, but modest\neffects of predictability. The presence of unpredictable pattern changes, that is, higher\nentropy, prolonged masker predominance significantly, but only if the maskers compared\nhad stepped presentation schedules and were also presented with a temporally compatible\ntarget (Figure 4(a)). Pitting the different Mondrian sequences in a rivalry paradigm showed\nthat the effect of spatial entropy was dependent on the presence of the low energy, higher\ntemporal frequency content in the Mondrian.\nThese results demonstrate some interesting points. First, studies have reported effects of feature\nselectivity in interocular suppression (Han & Alais, 2018; Moors et al., 2014; Stuit, Cass, Paffen, &\nAlais, 2009). Although we did not test low-level properties explicitly, we did obtain evidence of\ntemporal frequency selectivity. For example, spatial entropy only had a significant effect on CFS\ndynamics when the target and masker were temporally compatible (Figure 4(a)). Similarly,\nmanipulating the regularity of pattern updates did not result in significant differences in CFS\ndynamics, presumably because of the comparable temporal frequency content between the regular\nand irregular pattern update schedules (Figures 2 and 3(a)). Second, temporal frequency selectivity\nwas not the only low-level influence in our data, as fixed and sine sequences performed\ncomparably regardless of the target rate (Figure 4). Apart from the similarities between the 1/f\ntemporal spectrum and slow sine modulation (both have low frequency power in common), other\nfactors include the stepped presentation and high temporal frequency content of the fixed\nsequence. These factors could promote neural adaptation (see Alais et al., 2010) and cross-\nchannel inhibition on lower frequencies (Cass & Alais, 2006), weakening any potential\nadvantage of the broader frequency spectrum of the fixed masker.\nThis brings us to the third point. If the low-level factors associated with the stepped\npresentation of the fixed masker were detrimental to its effectiveness, how were these\nlimitations overcome by spatial entropy in the standard masker? We surmise that the\nunpredictable, dynamic edges in the Mondrian pattern comprise the key feature of the\nspatial entropy effect, as spatially uncorrelated and unpredictable noise patterns have been\nshown to be weaker than intact Mondrian patterns (Drewes, Zhu, & Melcher, 2018; Han\net al., 2018). Since the effect of spatial entropy was dependent on the presence of higher\ntemporal frequencies in Experiment 5, we postulate that the transient, unpredictable phase\ncongruencies in the Mondrian may provide some form of pattern masking (see Enns & Di\nLollo, 2000; Macknik et al., 2000). As has been suggested by previous reports (Han et al.,\nenhance ongoing rivalry suppression processes in CFS. Based on our current results and a\nprevious report by Han et al. (2018), the extent of masking influence appears to be small,\nthough it may become useful for impairing target visibility at later phases of CFS\nsuppression. Our results in Experiment 3 (Figure 4(a)) also suggest that masking could aid\nin maintaining the effectiveness of CFS suppression over prolonged periods.\nIn closing, we should stress that our analysis is based on measures of CFS effectiveness\ncollected over extended viewing periods of 60s (Experiments 1\u00ad4) or 90s (Experiment 5).\nIn our task, participants tracked the changes in visibility and suppression of the target,\nsimilar to the common dominance tracking task used in binocular rivalry to quantify\nalternation dynamics (e.g., Brascamp et al., 2006), but seldom used in CFS. It is possible\nthat different perspectives on CFS strength might arise if suppression potency were measured\nusing another approach, such as measuring the initial suppression duration before the target\nbreaks through to visibility (the so-called b-CFS method; e.g., Jiang et al., 2007). Another\nuseful approach would be to measure the transient reduction in visual sensitivity of the\nsuppressed eye using the contrast probe technique, as often used in binocular rivalry to\nmeasure the strength of suppression (Nguyen, Freeman, & Alais, 2003) and occasionally\nused in CFS studies (Tsuchiya, Koch, Gilroy, & Blake, 2006), although recent work\nsuggests these measures are highly correlated (Han & Alais, 2018, see Figures 2 and 3).\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or\npublication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or\npublication of this article: This research is supported by the Australian Research Council, Discovery\nProject DP130102336.
