Discrete time survival models were\nspecified to estimate the relative odds of first onset of de-\npressive disorders (major depressive episode and dys-\nthymia) and anxiety disorders (generalized anxiety dis-\norder, social phobia, panic disorder, and posttraumatic\nstress disorder) among migrants after their arrival in the\nUnited States compared with nonmigrant Mexicans who\nhave a migrant in their immediate family.\nSetting: Population surveys in the United States and\nMexico.\nParticipants: Two thousand five hundred nineteen non-\nmigrant family members of migrants in Mexico and 554\nMexican migrants in the United States.\nMain Outcome Measures: First onset of any depres-\nsive or anxiety disorder.\nResults: After arrival in the United States, migrants had\na significantly higher risk for first onset of any depressive\nor anxiety disorder than did nonmigrant family members\nof migrants in Mexico (odds ratio, 1.42; 95% confidence\ndisorder varied across birth cohorts. Elevated risk among\nmigrants relative to nonmigrants was restricted to the 2\nterview). In the most recent birth cohort, the association\nbetweenmigrationandfirstonsetofanydepressiveoranxi-\nety disorder was particularly strong (odds ratio, 3.89; 95%\nConclusions: This is, to our knowledge, the first study to\ncompare risk for first onset of psychiatric disorder be-\ntweenrepresentativesamplesofmigrantsintheUnitedStates\nand nonmigrants in Mexico. The findings are consistent\nwith the hypothesized adverse effect of migration from\nMexico to the United States on the mental health of mi-\ngrants, but only among migrants in recent birth cohorts.\nliving in the United States\nMexico,1 constituting ap-\nproximately30%oftheUS\nforeign-born population, 25% of the US\nHispanicpopulation,and10%oftheMexi-\ncan-born population on both sides of the\nMexico-USborder.Mentalhealthresearch-\ners have hypothesized that adverse social\nexperiences inherent in the migration pro-\ncesshaveanegativeeffectonmentalhealth\nin this population.2,3 Two findings from\nstudies conducted in the United States are\nconsistent with this hypothesis. First,\namong Mexican Americans (ie, people of\nMexican descent born in Mexico or the\nUnited States), as among the US Hispanic\npopulation more broadly, greater accul-\nturation (ie, adoption of American pat-\nterns of behavior) is associated with worse\nmentalhealthstatus,includinghigherrates\nof psychiatric and substance use disor-\nders.4-7 Second, among Mexican-born im-\nmigrants in the United States, those who\nhave been in the United States for longer\nperiods have worse mental health than\nmore recent arrivals.8 However, because\nthese studies are limited to comparisons\nwithin the US population, neither of these\nfindings isolates the potential effect of mi-\ngration on the migrants themselves.9,10\nOnly 1 pilot study11 has directly esti-\nmated the effect of migration by compar-\ning the mental health of Mexican-born im-\nmigrants in the United States with that of\nAuthor Affiliations:\nDepartments of Internal\nMedicine (Drs Breslau, Kravitz,\nand Aguilar-Gaxiola), Pediatrics\n(Dr Tancredi), and Psychiatry\n(Dr Hinton) and Center for\nHealth Policy and Research\n(Ms Saito), University of\nCalifornia, Davis, School of\nMedicine, Sacramento; National\nInstitute of Psychiatry, Mexico\nCity, Mexico (Drs Borges and\nMedina-Mora); and School of\nSocial Work, University of\nSouthern California,\nLos Angeles (Dr Vega).\n\u00a92011 American Medical Association.

That\nstudy found that immigrants were at higher risk for mood\nand anxiety disorders after migrating to the United States\ncompared with persons who remained in Mexico, but its\ngeneralizability is limited by a very small sample of im-\nmigrants (n=75), all of whom were interviewed in En-\nglish. These pilot findings indicated the need for a larger\nstudy and a stronger methodological approach.\nIn this study, we compared a sample of Mexican-born\nter their arrival in the United States with a sample of non-\nwomen) on their risk for first onset of a depressive or an\nanxiety disorder. The samples come from epidemiologi-\ncal surveys in which respondents were interviewed with\nthe same fully structured diagnostic interview. Respon-\ndents in the United States had the choice of conducting the\ninterview in English or Spanish. In addition, in this study\nwe used an alternative analysis strategy to better control\nfor potential confounding of the effect of migration on de-\npressive and anxiety disorders that can arise from family-\nlevel influences (eg, region or family socioeconomic sta-\ntus). In the pilot study,11 family socioeconomic status was\nadjusted for by including a covariate for parental educa-\ntional level in the statistical model predicting onset of dis-\norder.Inthepresentstudy,wecontrolledforabroaderrange\nof these family-level premigration factors by restricting the\ncomparison sample to people in Mexico who have family\nmembers in the United States but have not themselves mi-\ngrated. In contrast to statistically adjusting for confound-\ning by including measured covariates in a multivariable\nmodel, restriction can reduce confounding from all family-\nlevelconfounders,whethermeasuredornot,makingitper-\nhaps the most effective method when a large number of\nobservations are available in the restricted sample.12\nMETHODS\nders were conducted in nationally representative samples of the\nadult populations of Mexico13 and the United States14 using the\nsame fully structured diagnostic instrument, the World Men-\ntal Health Survey Initiative Version of the World Health Orga-\nnization Composite International Diagnostic Interview\n(WMH-CIDI).15 Data from these surveys were combined to cre-\nate a transnational sample of Mexican-born individuals resid-\ning in Mexico or in the United States. Questions regarding the\nmigration experience of respondents and their family mem-\nbers included in the Mexico survey were used to identify a rep-\nresentative sample of individuals with a member of their im-\nmediate family living in the United States (family members of\nmigrants). Questions regarding country of birth and age at mi-\ngration included in the US survey were used to identify a rep-\nresentative sample of Mexican-born immigrants and specify the\nperiods before and after their arrival in the United States. Data\nfrom both surveys regarding age at onset of psychiatric disor-\nders were used to compare the risk for first onset among im-\nmigrants after their arrival in the United States with that of fam-\nily members of migrants residing in Mexico. Comparisons were\nconducted for first onset of depressive disorders (major de-\npressive episode and dysthymia) and anxiety disorders (social\nphobia, panic disorder or agoraphobia, generalized anxiety dis-\norder [GAD], and posttraumatic stress disorder).\nData on the Mexican population came from the Mexico Na-\ntional Comorbidity Survey,13 a survey based on a stratified mul-\ntistage area probability sample of household residents in Mexico\npeople. Interviews were conducted with 1 randomly chosen\nmember of each selected household from September 2001\nrespondents interviewed. Data on the 2519 nonmigrants who\nhad a migrant in their immediate family were used in the pres-\nent study. The nonmigrant family members of migrants were\nsampled independently from the US migrant sample (ie, they\nwere not relatives of the US migrants interviewed for this study).\nThe sample is representative of individuals in families of cur-\nrent Mexican-born immigrants in the United States.\nDataontheMexican-AmericanpopulationintheUnitedStates\ncame from 2 component surveys of the Collaborative Psychiat-\nricEpidemiologySurveys,16 theNationalComorbiditySurveyRep-\nlication (NCS-R)17 and the National Latino and Asian American\nSurvey (NLAAS).18 The NCS-R was based on a stratified multi-\nstage area probability sample of the English-speaking house-\nhold population of the continental United States.19 Interviews\nresponse rate. The NLAAS was based on the same sampling frame\nas the NCS-R, with special supplements to increase representa-\ntion of the survey's target ethnic groups.16 The NLAAS inter-\n75.5%responseratefortheLatinosample.Integratedsurveysam-\npling weights were based on the common Collaborative Psychi-\natric Epidemiology Surveys sampling frame20 to properly adjust\nthe combined sample to represent the ethnic composition of the\nUS population. Data on the 554 Mexican-born respondents to\nthe NCS-R or the NLAAS were used in this study.\nStudy procedures were approved by the institutional re-\nview boards of Harvard Medical School; the University of Michi-\ngan, Ann Arbor; and the National Institute of Psychiatry Ramon\nde la Fuente.\nASSESSMENTS\nTheDSM-IVcriteriaformajordepressiveepisode,dysthymia,GAD,\npanicdisorder,agoraphobia,socialphobia,andposttraumaticstress\ndisorder were assessed with the WMH-CIDI, a fully structured\nface-to-face diagnostic interview administered in respondents'\nhomes by a trained nonclinician interviewer using a laptop com-\nputer. Clinical reappraisal studies in the NCS-R21 and the WMH\nSurveys,22 inwhichtheWMH-CIDIdiagnoseswerecomparedwith\nstructured clinical interviews administered by mental health pro-\nfessionals, showed good concordance for mood and anxiety dis-\norders. The Spanish-language version of the WMH-CIDI, used\nin the Mexico National Comorbidity Survey and the NLAAS, was\ndevelopedfollowingWorldHealthOrganizationinstrumenttrans-\nlation guidelines, with field testing before the start of data col-\nMexican-born migrants in the United States were compared with\nnonmigrant family members of migrants in Mexico. The Mexi-\ncan comparison group was selected to control for family-level\ndifferences between migrants and nonmigrants that might affect\nrisk for mood and anxiety disorders after migration to the United\nStates, such as differences in childhood socioeconomic status.\nWhen a sufficiently large sample is available, restriction of the\ncomparison group is preferable to statistical adjustment in a mul-\ntivariable model because it adjusts for measured and unmea-\nsured family-level confounders while requiring fewer modeling\nassumptions.

An advantage of survival analysis with time-varying co-\nvariates is that it allows consideration of independent variables\nfor which the value for any given person may change over time.\nAperson'smigrationstatus(theindependentvariable)canchange\nfrom not being a migrant (ie, living in Mexico) to being a mi-\ngrant in the United States at any time until the onset of the psy-\nchiatric disorder of interest or the age at interview (whichever\ncomes first). To construct a conservative test of the effect of mi-\ngration, disorders with onset in the same year that a person mi-\ngrated were coded as having onset before migration.\nAdditional specifications were used to examine potential\nvariations in the risk associated with being in the United States\nby sex, birth cohort, and chronological age. Sociological re-\nsearch has demonstrated that migration is associated with dra-\nmatic shifts in gender roles26 that might influence risk for dis-\norder. In addition, evidence suggests that differences in mental\nhealth associated with migration are larger for women than for\nmen27 and tend to decrease with age.28 Multiple imputation was\nused to include the small number of immigrants with missing\ndata on age at migration. All analyses were conducted using\nSUDAAN software29 to adjust standard errors for the complex\nsample designs of the surveys. Coefficients from multivariable\nlogistic regression equations are presented in exponentiated form\nas covariate-adjusted odds ratios (ORs).\nRESULTS\nThe sample included 2519 nonmigrant family members\nof migrants in Mexico and 554 Mexican migrants in the\nUnited States. Migrants were more likely to be male and\nwere family members of migrants (Table 1).\nWe compared the lifetime prevalence of disorders be-\ntween the Mexican migrants in the United States and the\nreference group (Table 2). Compared with nonmigrant\nfamily members of migrants in Mexico, Mexican migrants\nintheUnitedStateshadasignificantlyhigherlifetimepreva-\nlence of any depressive or anxiety disorder (17.4% vs\nand for anxiety disorders as a group (10.1% vs 6.2%).\nAmong the 4 specific anxiety disorders assessed, migrants\nhad a higher prevalence for every type of disorder, and this\ndifference reached statistical significance for GAD (2.9%\nResults of the discrete time survival analysis show that,\nduring the years after arrival in the United States, mi-\ngrants were at significantly higher risk for first onset of\nany depressive or anxiety disorder than were nonmi-\ngrant family members of migrants (OR, 1.42; 95% con-\nand sex (Table 3).

Sta-\ntistical interactions between migration and sex, birth co-\nand age at migration (13 vs 13 years) were tested.\nOf these, only the interaction between birth cohort and\nmigration reached statistical significance.\nAs shown in Table 4, the elevated risk among mi-\ngrants occurred almost entirely in the 2 most recent birth\ninterview). Risk for depressive and anxiety disorders af-\nter migration was highest (relative to nonmigrant fam-\nily members of migrants) among members of the most\nrecent cohort (those aged 18-25 years). In that group,\nthe OR for any depressive disorder was 4.37 (compared\nwith 1.16 overall), and the OR for anxiety disorder was\nreached statistical significance and 4 were less than 1.00.\nCOMMENT\nThis study is unique among studies of migration and risk\nfor psychiatric disorders in the use of cross-national data\nto compare morbidity in a representative sample of mi-\ngrants with that in their source population. Respondents\non both sides of the border were interviewed within the\nsame time frame using the same diagnostic interview. Al-\nthough the early pilot study11 included only a small sample\nof English-speaking migrants, the present study includes\na larger sample of migrants interviewed in their choice of\nEnglish or Spanish. In addition, the comparison group in\nthis study--members of families in Mexico with a mi-\ngrant in the United States--provides a robust adjustment\nfor migrant selection. The finding that migrants are at\nhigher risk for onset of depressive and anxiety disorders\nafter migration compared with family members of mi-\ngrants who remained in Mexico provides the first direct\nevidence that experiences as a migrant might lead to the\nonset of clinically significant mental health problems in\nthis population. In particular, migrants were at higher risk\nfor depressive disorders, inclusive of major depression and\ndysthymia, GAD, and social phobia. In addition, when the\nTable 1.

First, previous stud-\nies reported associations between poor mental health and\nacculturation, that is, the extent to which immigrants or\nmembers of ethnic minority populations have adopted\nbehaviors typical of mainstream Americans or gained pro-\nficiency in English, when both are assessed contempo-\nraneously.6,30 This association is purported to reflect, in\npart, the impact of negative experiences faced by immi-\ngrants in the process of assimilation (ie, acculturative\nstressors). However, these findings can be explained by\nhigh levels of risk for psychiatric disorder among the US-\nborn members of ethnic minority populations, who have\nhigh risk for psychiatric disorders and high levels of ac-\nculturation relative to immigrants.9,31\nSecond, a previous study8 found that immigrants who\nhave lived in the United States for longer periods have a\nhigher risk for psychiatric disorder than do immigrants\nwho have recently arrived. That finding seems to indi-\ncate that a longer period of exposure to the United States\nleads to a decline in mental health. However, the asso-\nciation between duration of residence and onset of dis-\norder is confounded by age at migration; by holding age\nconstant, immigrants who have lived in the United States\nlonger migrated at younger ages. Recent studies32 have\nfound that immigrants who arrive in the United States\nbefore 13 years of age have a much higher risk for mood\nand anxiety disorders than do immigrants who arrive as\nadolescents or adults. The apparent effect of longer du-\nration of residence in the United States may reflect the\nhigh levels of risk among immigrants who arrived as chil-\ndren, who, compared with other immigrants of the same\nage, are likely to have lived in the United States longer.\nThe difference might be in age at migration rather than\nduration of residence in the United States.\nThepresentstudyprovidesevidenceofanadverseeffect\nof migration on mental health among Mexican migrants\nto the United States that overcomes important limitations\nofpreviousstudiesofthispopulation.First,thesamplewas\nlimitedtofirst-generationimmigrants,todistinguishmen-\ntalhealthproblemsamongimmigrantsfrommentalhealth\nproblemsofUS-bornoffspringofimmigrants.Thissample\noffered more direct evidence about the mental health ef-\nfectsofexperiencesintheyearsaftermigrationtotheUnited\nStates.Second,theuseofsurvivalmodelsensuredthatdis-\nordersoccurringbeforemigrationwerenotcountedaspo-\ntentialeffectsofmigration.Third,weimprovedtheadjust-\nment for migrant selection by comparing migrants in the\nUnited States with a sample of family members of mi-\ngrants in Mexico.

Sociologicalresearch\nsuggests that family characteristics, such as economic se-\ncurity,whichenablestheinitialinvestmentrequiredformi-\ngration, are important determinants of migration.33-35\nA remaining limitation of this study is the possibility\nofresidualconfounding(oftheeffectofmigrationonmen-\ntal health) by premigration differences between mi-\ngrants and nonmigrants within families (ie, within-\nfamily selection).

Restriction of the control group to non-\nmigrant members of families of migrants in Mexico was\nintended to account for confounding at the family level.\nDifferences between migrants and nonmigrants within\nfamilies were accounted for in this study by treating the\nexposure (migration) as a time-varying covariate; disor-\nders that preceded migration, including those occurring\nin the year of migration, were counted toward the base-\nline risk among nonmigrants. In addition, estimates were\nadjusted for previous comorbid psychiatric disorders,\nwhich might have occurred before or after migration.\nNonetheless, the possibility of residual confounding can-\nnot be ruled out entirely. In supplementary analyses of\nthis subsample conducted to address the question of mi-\ngrantselection,migrationremainedassociatedwithhigher\nrisk for onset of depressive and anxiety disorders after\nadjustment for childhood adversity profiles.\nReliance on recall of the lifetime occurrence of psychi-\natric disorders is also a potential limitation of this study.36\nInaccuracy in recall would bias the results if migrants were\nmore likely than family members who remained in Mexico\nto recall past symptoms. The potential influence of recall\nbias should be considered in light of the observed interco-\nhortvariationintheassociationbetweenmigrationandrisk\nfor disorder. We would expect recall bias to be more se-\nvere in older cohorts because they are asked to recall psy-\nchiatric symptoms over a longer period. However, in this\nstudy the association between migration and disorder was\nstrongest in the youngest respondents, among whom the\ninfluence of recall bias is likely to be minimized.\nFinally, the differences observed herein may also re-\nflect differences in idiom of distress between migrants and\ntheir families of origin. These differences are minimized\nin this study by the use of the same fully structured diag-\nnostic interview, which assesses specific symptoms rather\nthan general complaints, and by the shared Mexican cul-\ntural background of the entire sample. Future studies of\nshifts in idiom of distress among migrants might further\ntest whether the apparent impact of migration on mental\nhealth can be accounted for by methodological difficul-\nties in assessing psychiatric disorders cross-culturally.\nThisstudyadvancesourknowledgeofthetransitionin\npopulation levels of risk for depressive and anxiety disor-\nders from the relatively low prevalence found in Mexico13\nto the relatively high prevalence found in the population\nofMexicanoriginintheUnitedStates.37 Evidencenowsug-\ngests 3 distinct components of this transition. First, there\nisevidenceofnegativementalhealthselection,thatis,that\nindividualswhomigratehavelessfavorablechildhoodmen-\ntal health profiles than individuals who do not migrate.38\nSecond,evidencefromthisstudysuggeststhat,afterarrival\nintheUnitedStates,migrantsareathigherriskthanMexi-\ncans who did not migrate, even after accounting for selec-\ntionfactors.Third,individualsofMexicanorigin,whether\nborninMexicoortheUnitedStates,whospendtheirchild-\nhood in the United States are at roughly equally high lev-\nels of lifetime risk as the general US-born population.32\nIdentifying these components of the transition in risk\nforpsychiatricdisorderassociatedwithmigrationmayhelp\nidentify and test suspected etiological factors. Studies of\nmigrationandmentalhealthhavefocusedattentionondis-\ncrimination as one likely cause of increased risk for psy-\nchiatric disorder. Studies of Caribbean-origin migrants in\nEurope suggest associations between discrimination and\npsychotic disorders.39,40 In the United States, there is evi-\ndence of an association between experiences of discrimi-\nnation and depression among Hispanic migrants.41,42 Al-\nthough suggestive, current evidence is limited to studies\nthatcomparemigrantswithdescendantsofimmigrantsborn\nin the host country. In addition, associations between mi-\ngration and mental health may not be generalizable across\nmigrant groups, which differ dramatically in the factors\ninfluencing migration and the conditions in the receiving\nhost country.\nPotential explanations for the intercohort variation in\nthe effect of migration may lie in change in the composi-\ntion of migrants across birth cohorts or in changes in the\nsocialcontextofimmigrantabsorptionintheUnitedStates.\nHistorical studies of migration from Mexico to the United\nStates have found that the demographic composition of the\nmigrant population has been relatively stable during the\nperiods covered in this study.43 Therefore, it is unlikely that\nsecular changes in the types of migrants account for the\nobserved variation in the effect of migration. Changes in\nthe context of immigrant absorption in the United States\nhavealsooccurredduringthisperiodthatwouldlikelyaffect\ntheexperienceofrecentbirthcohorts,mostnotablytheim-\nevation in risk for depressive and anxiety disorders occurs\namong recent birth cohorts of Mexican migrants may help\nguide future research by locating the effect of migration\nwithin the particular experiences of this subpopulation.\nTable 4.
