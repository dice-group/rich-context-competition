The pathogenesis\nremains unclear and although no vaccines\nor antiviral therapies are available for the\nprevention or treatment of EV71 infection,\nprogress has been made in recent years.\nSeveral compounds with a variety of mech-\nanisms of action have been shown to inhibit\nEV71 replication, but none has been\nadvanced to human clinical trials.7,8 An\neffective approach to prevent EV71 out-\nbreaks would be to develop a vaccine with\na favourable safety and efficacy profile, and\nEV71 vaccine development has been under-\nway in China and Singapore, with three\ncompanies in China completing Phase III\nclinical trials of inactivated EV71 vac-\ncines.9,10 Thus, determination of the patho-\ngen causing HFMD, for effective early\ntreatment, is desirable.\nVirus isolation using cell/tissue culture\nremains the gold standard for enterovirus\ndiagnosis.11 Molecular methods, such as\npolymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques\nincluding reverse transcription (RT)-PCR\nand real-time PCR, have been developed to\nenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay\n(ELISA) techniques have been developed\nto detect antibodies for the clinical diagnosis\nof HFMD.16,17 The aim of the present study\nwas to develop a rapid, sensitive and more\nspecific and effective diagnostic method for\ndetecting EV71 in clinical specimens.\nThe genus Enterovirus belongs to the\nPicornaviridae family and consists of 66\ndifferent subtypes, including polioviruses,\ncoxsackievirus group A and coxsackievirus\ngroup B, echoviruses, and enteroviruses.18\nThe different genogroups of EV71 are\nwidely distributed around the world.2 The\nand encodes four structural capsid proteins\n3B, 3C and 3D). The structure protein VP1\nis considered to be variable and to play an\nimportant role in characterizing antigeni-\nVP3 structure protein to characterize anti-\ngenicity, and data are limited.20\nAnother form of medical diagnosis\nuses detection of particular antibodies.\nAntibodies exist as different isotypes,\nnamely immunoglobulin (Ig)A, IgD, IgE,\nIgG and IgM. IgM antibodies appear early\nin the course of infection, then disappear\n(IgM titres usually fall within 2 months and\nnormalize within 4\u00ad6 months); IgM usually\nreappears to a lesser extent following further\nantigen exposure. After an acute infection,\nelevated IgG levels may persist for several\nyears and occasionally be detectable over the\nIn the present study, VP1 and VP3 were\nselected as antigens to detect antibodies\n(IgG and IgM) in serum samples from\npatients with HFMD using protein micro-\narrays, with the aim of developing this assay\ntechnique as a convenient, sensitive and\neconomic diagnostic tool for HFMD.\nPatients and methods\nStudy population and serum samples\nThis study sequentially recruited patients\nwith acute HFMD who were admitted to\nBeijing YouAn Hospital, Beijing, China\n2014. Inclusion criteria were as follows:\nchildren aged <5 years; clinical features of\nHFMD (including fever, sore throat, ulcers\nin the throat, mouth and tongue, headache,\nand rash with vesicles on the hands, feet and\ninguinal area); presence of EV71 and (or)\nCA16 RNA in vesicular fluid, blood and\nurine samples, detected using RT-PCR in\nthe clinical laboratory of Beijing YouAn\nHospital. Data from the prior RT-PCR\nanalyses were compared with the protein\nmicroarray results from the present study, to\nevaluate the microarray assay.\nSerum samples were collected from\npatients enrolled in the study as follows:\nusing standard methods, 2 ml of venous\nblood was collected between day 1 and day\n5 following onset of fever or skin lesions.\nBlood samples were allowed to clot at 4C\nfor 24 h. Samples were then centrifuged at\nserum from each sample was transferred to\na new tube and stored at 4C prior to use.\nSerum samples were also collected from\nhealthy blood donors living in Beijing. All\nblood from donations was routinely\nscreened for blood-borne pathogens, includ-\ning: HIV, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus,\nsyphilis, malaria and bacterial contamin-\nation, using standard screening techniques.\nThe study protocol was approved by\nthe Ethics Committee of Beijing YouAn\nHospital, Beijing, China. Written informed\nconsent was obtained from the patients or\ntheir legal proxies. Verbal informed consent\nwas obtained from the healthy controls.\nAmplification and cloning of viral VP1\nand VP3 genes\n(provided as gifts from the National\nInstitute for the Control of Pharmaceutical\nand Biological Products, Beijing, China),\nwere used as templates for amplification of\nthe peptide coding region. EV71 and CA16\nVP1 and VP3 protein sequences were\nretrieved from the National Center for\nBiotechnology Information (NCBI) Entrez\nProtein Database. PCR amplification of\nReadyMixTM Taq PCR Reaction Mix with\n(Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO,\nUSA) and the following primer sequences:\nEach 50 -ml reaction contained 1 ml of\nforward primer, 1 ml of reverse primer, 5 ml\ntemplate DNA, 25 ml of 2 \u00c2 ReadyMixTM\nTaq PCR Reaction Mix, and 18 ml H2\nO. The\ncycling programme involved preliminary\ndenaturation at 95C for 5 min, followed\nannealing at 58C for 60 s, and elongation at\n72C for 60 s, followed by a final elongation\nstep at 72C for 20 min. The resultant four\nPCR products were each cloned into pET-\n28a expression vectors (EMD Millipore,\nBillerica, MA, USA) for production of\nHis-tagged fusion proteins. The pET-28a\nvector and amplified gene were digested\nwith the following restriction enzymes\n(New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA,\nUSA), respectively for 1 h at 37C according\nto the manufacturer's instructions: EcoR1\nand XhoI (EV71 VP3); BamHI and EcoRI\nand CA16 VP1). Plasmid DNA and PCR\nfragments were then purified using\nQIAprep\u00d5 Spin Miniprep Kit and\nQIAquick\u00d5 Gel Extraction and PCR purifi-\ncation kits (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany)\naccording to the manufacturer's instruc-\ntions. T4 DNA ligase enzyme (Fermentas,\nSt. Leon-Rot, Germany) was used to insert\nthe digested and purified PCR fragment into\nthe digested vector (incubated for 1 h\nCloning was confirmed by the release of\ninsert from the vector on double digestion\nwith the restriction enzymes EcoR1 and\nEngand Biolabs) at 37C for 2 h, BamHI\nVP3, CA16 VP1) in CutSmart\u00d5 Buffer first\nat 25C with SmaI for 2 h, then with XhoI\nadded, raised to 37C for 2 h. The expression\nplasmid was then sequenced by Sino Geno\nMax Co., Ltd, Beijing, China using a genetic\nBiosystems Carlsbad, CA, USA).\nExpression and purification of VP1 and\nVP3 recombinant proteins\nEscherichia coli M15 (pREP4) cells (Qiagen,\nHong Kong, China) were transfected with\neach of the four pET-28a enterovirus con-\nstructs to obtain expression of CA16 and\nEV71 His-tagged proteins. Next, 2 ml of\nrecombined plasmid DNA was added to\nbation period on ice, a mixture of pREP4\nand viral DNA was placed at 42C for 45 s\n(heat shock), then placed back on ice. SOC\nmedia (20 g/l tryptone, 5 g/l yeast extract,\ntransformed cells were incubated at 37C for\n30 min with agitation. For production of\nrecombinant fusion protein, the inserted\nclones were incubated in Luria broth base\nmedium with added ampicillin (50 mg/ml) at\n, then\nprotein expression was induced with 1 mM\nisopropyl b-D-thiogalactopyranoside.\nFollowing culture of transfected E. coli,\nHis-tagged recombinant proteins were pur-\nified using Ni-NTA resin (Genscript, Hong\nKong, China). The proteins were eluted\nwith 6 M guanidine hydrochloride buffer\n(pH 7.9), then precipitated with trichloro-\nacetic acid. Fractions containing the protein\nwere identified by sodium dodecyl sulphate\n(SDS)\u00adpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis\n(PAGE). The proteins were renatured by\nserial dialysis into 1\u00c2phosphate-buffered\nsaline (PBS)-0.25 M arginine buffer (pH\n8.0), and protein purity was analysed by\nSDS\u00adPAGE. Concentrations of the purified\nviral proteins were determined using a\nBeckman Coulter DU730 spectropho-\ntometer (Beckman Coulter Commercial\nEnterprise (China) Co., Ltd. Shanghai,\nChina).\nProtein microarray\nglycerol (to prevent evaporation of nano-\ndroplets) were spotted in quadruplicate, at\n1 mg/ml, onto aldehyde group-modified\nglass slides. Following spotting, slides were\nincubated for 24 h at 4C (to facilitate\ncomplete protein immobilization), then\nimmobilized. Slides were then blocked with\n5% bovine serum antigen (BSA) for 2 h at\n37C, then washed three times with 1\u00c2PBS\n(pH 7.4) for 30 s each wash. Serum samples\n(1 ml) from patients with HFMD and con-\ntrols were diluted 20\u00c2in blocking buffer\ntwice with PBS-Tween 20 (PBST) with a\nfinal rinse using PBS. For detecting IgG\nantibody, 10ml of cyanine (Cy)3-labelled\nGaithersburg, MD, USA) was added.\nFor detecting IgM antibody, 10ml of\nCyTM3-labelled goat antihuman IgM\n(1 : 500, KPL) was added. Slides were then\nincubated for 30 min at 37C in the dark and\nthen rinsed twice with washing buffer (PBS-\nO.\nSlides were scanned using a GenePix\u00d5\nDevices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) in the fluor-\nescence acquisition mode. For Cy3-labelled\nprobes, a 532 nm excitation laser source was\nchosen, while the photomultiplier tube volt-\nage was set at 500 volts. For scan resolution,\nthe pixel size was set as 10 mm. The image\nwas initially analysed using GenePix\u00d5 Pro\nmicroarray acquisition and analysis soft-\nmode for absolute fluorescence intensity\nmeasurement. For each slide, a reference\nchannel image was used to set a grid for\nlocating an individual spot; fluorescence\nreadings for each spot were recorded. Raw\ndata were exported into Microsoft Excel\u00d5\nfor storage and further analysis.\nDetection of IgM anti-EV71 VP1 by ELISA\nTo evaluate the performance of the protein\nmicroarray assay, all serum samples from\npatients with HFMD were analysed using\nWantai EV-71 IgM ELISA kits (Beijing\nWantai Biological Pharmacy Enterprise\nCo., Ltd., Beijing, China) according to the\nmanufacturer's instructions. To evaluate the\nperformance of the Wantai EV-71 IgM\nELISA kits, a random selection of serum\nsamples from patients with HFMD were\nanalysed using in-house ELISA assays as\nfollows: anti-EV71 VP1 IgM was detected\nusing an IgM m-chain capture ELISA. First,\n96-microwell immunoassay strips (Nunc,\nUSA) were coated with goat antihuman\nIgM (m chain- specific, Jackson, USA)\ndiluted in a carbonate buffer (pH 9.6). The\nstrip was incubated at 4C overnight, then\nwashed four times with PBST. Plates were\nthen blocked with 250 ml of blocking buffer\n(PBS, 5% nonfat dry milk, 0.5% BSA (pH\n7.4) at room temperature for 4 h before\nbeing washed four times with PBST. Then,\n50ml of a 10 \u00c2 dilution of the serum speci-\nmen, blank (dilution buffer; pH 7.4), or\npositive (HFMD sample) and negative\n(healthy control sample) were each added\nto separate wells, and the strips were\nincubated at 37C for 1 h. After washing\ntwice with PBST and final rinse with PBS,\nwas added to each well, and samples were\nagain incubated at 37C for 1 h. Then,\nperoxidase (HRP)-conjugated streptavidin\n(Chemicon, CA, USA) was added to each\nwell, the samples were incubated at 37C for\n1 h and washed 5 times with PBST, then\nsubstrate (Chemi-Con, Buena Park, CA,\nUSA) (100 ml) was added to each well. The\nstrip was incubated in the dark at room\ntemperature for 30 min, and the reaction was\n. Optical density (OD) was read at\nusing a Thermo Multiskan Spectrum micro-\nplate reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific,\nWaltham, MA, USA).\nStatistical analyses\nStatistical analyses were performed using\n2-test with ZIYUE software, version 1.61\n(http://down.tech.sina.com.cn/content/2944\n4.html). A P-value < 0.05 was considered to\nbe statistically significant.\nResults\nPreparation of antigenic viral\nrecombinant proteins\nEV71 enteroviruses were cloned into pET-\n28a ( \u00fe ) expression vectors. All four con-\nstructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing\nand expressed in E. coli M15 (pREP4). VP1\nand VP3 protein products were purified and\nanalysed as described above. All of the\nexpressed proteins migrated between the 25\nand 37 kDa markers, which was consistent\nwith the predicted size of each protein\n(Figure 1a). All four recombinant proteins\nwere used to generate the protein\nmicroarray.\nProtein microarray\nSerum samples from patients with HFMD. A\ntotal of 50 serum samples were collected\nfrom patients with HFMD and tested using\nthe protein microarray. A signal log ratio\nvalue of 0 was chosen as the cut-off value to\ndistinguish between positive and negative\ntest results. A signal log ratio ! 0 was indi-\ncative of a positive sample and a ratio <0\nwas indicative of a negative sample. The\nresults of signal log ratio analyses were\nconsistent with unaided observations using\nthe naked eye. The protein microarrays were\nanalysed following incubation of serum\nfrom healthy control subjects (Figure 1b)\nand from patients with HFMD (Figure 1c).\nAnti-EV71VP1 IgM immunoreactivity was\ndetected in 80% of samples from patients\nwith HFMD, and was higher than anti-\nanti-CA16VP3 IgM immunoreactivity\nples, respectively; Table 1).

The protein microarray\nwas able to detect neutralizing antibodies\nagainst EV71 and CA16, and to detect IgM\nand IgG antibodies against EV71 and CA16\nby hybridizing different secondary antibo-\ndies. Anti-EV71VP1 IgM was highly detect-\nable in serum samples from patients with\nHFMD, and almost all anti-VP3-positive\nserum samples were also positive for anti-\nbodies against VP1 protein. In the present\nstudy, the detection pattern of serum anti-\nbodies by protein microarray using entero-\nvirus VP1 and VP3 proteins as antigens\nsuggested that the immunological reactions\ndifferent. IgM against VP1 but not VP3\nappeared to be generated in patients with\nHMFD, which needs to be clarified further.\nIn the present study, a proportion of\nhealthy control samples tested positive for\nanti-EV71 IgG and anti-CA16 IgG using the\nmicroarray chip, which may have been due\nto previous EV71 (and/or CA16) infection.\nLevels of IgM antibody increase continu-\nously before peaking at the second week\nfollowing symptom onset, then decline grad-\nually.28 During the acute phase (<7 days\nfollowing symptom onset), EV71 IgM has\nbeen detected in 88% of samples tested using\nELISA.29 Serum from patients with HFMD\nand healthy controls could not be distin-\nguished by detecting IgG using microarray\nin the present study, however, no commer-\ncial ELISA assay was available for detecting\nmeant that appropriate control methods for\nlacking in the present study.\nIn the present study, anti-EV71 (and/or\nCA16) IgM was useful for diagnosing acute\nHFMD.

In\nthe present study, the antibody against\nserum EV71 was a polyclonal antibody\nwhich crossreacted with CA16 antigen. The\npresent data also showed that any sample\nthat tested positive for CA16 VP1- and\nCA16 VP3-IgM was also positive for\nEV71-VP1 IgM. Although there are many\nmethods to detect anti-EV71 or anti-CA16\nantibodies, it remains difficult to discrimin-\nate between anti-EV71 or anti-CA16 anti-\nbodies in serum.\nThe protein microarray method used in\nthe present small study appeared to show\nexcellent specificity, i.e. no false-positive\nresults were detected in healthy controls.\nThe present microarray results (with a posi-\nfavourably with the gold standard ELISA\nmethod of 78% and suggest that the sensi-\ntivity of the protein microarray method is at\nleast equal to, or perhaps slightly higher\nthan the ELISA. Protein microarray is more\neconomical than ELISA,33 making its use\npotentially more attractive in developing\ncountries. This small microarray may save\nresources such as antibodies, antigens and\nother experimental materials, and is a faster\ntechnique compared with ELISA (the pro-\ntein microarray takes $1.5 h to detect\nmultiple antibodies; ELISA takes about 3 h\nto detect only one antibody). Protein micro-\narray technology, therefore, appears to\nallow rapid, easy and parallel detection of\nmultiple elements in a single assay.\nIn conclusion, a protein microarray assay\nfor detecting EV71-IgM in serum samples\nfrom patients with HFMD was developed in\nthe present study. The protein microarray is\na potential alternative method for detecting\nantibodies in serum samples, and as it is\nrelatively easy to perform and low in cost, it\nmay be suitable for clinical diagnosis and\nuse in public health.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis work was supported by the National Science\nand Technology Key Projects on Major\nInfectious Diseases such as HIV/AIDS, Viral\nHepatitis Prevention and Treatment, Project\npartially supported by Beijing Institute of\nHepatology foundation grant, Project number:\nInnovation Center of Infectious Diseases.\nReferences\n1.
