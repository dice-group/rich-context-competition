This explains why banks are subject\nto more regulatory scrutiny compared to most other industries. Supervisors therefore\nmonitor banks on an ongoing basis to ensure the nancial safety and soundness of\nindividual banks and the system. To this end, they use among other things o-site\nmonitoring systems, which rely mostly on bank-specic nancial data reported to\nthe authorities. These so-called hazard rate models predict the probability of default\nof individual banks on the basis of historical nancial and default data.\nObviously, the denition of default is crucial to such analyses. On the one hand,\nbanks are subject to clear-cut failure denitions, such as minimum capital require-\nments stipulated in laws and regulations. On the other hand, the systemic dangers\nof bank defaults in conjunction with an ongoing supervision process suggest that\nregulators, and practitioners, may regard a bank as troubled much earlier than ulti-\nmate default in the form of (forced) market exit occurs. We argue in this paper that\nmost bank hazard studies neglect this ordinal nature of what we prefer to dene as\ndistress rather than default.\nWe address the issue by using data on a number of distress events that German\nuniversal banks from all three pillars experienced between 1994 and 2004. We cat-\negorize these events into four groups of ascending degrees of distress, ranging from\nearly warning information issued by banks to regulators to absorbing events such as\nclosure and restructuring mergers. To account for this pecking order of events, we\nspecify a generalized ordered logit model to predict probabilities of dierent distress\nevents simultaneously. Our main ndings are fourfold.\nFirst, we reject the traditionally employed binomial hazard rate model that pools\nall distress events without further qualication in favor of an ordered logit model\nthat explicitly allows for an ordered categorical variable of distress.\nSecond, we further nd that not only the level of hazard functions diers sig-\nnicantly across distress events but also the sensitivity of individual components\nof banks' nancial proles as captured by capitalization, asset quality, manage-\nment skill, earnings, liquidity (CAMEL) and regional macroeconomic covariates.\nWe report evidence that individual slope coecients, though not all of them, are\nsignicantly dierent across distress categories.\nThird, the most important added value of this model in terms of policy relevant\ninformation is the result that some components of nancial proles aect earlier\nstages of distress stronger. An example of this is managerial skill approximated with\nstochastic cost frontier eciency. Other components are particularly important to\nexplain the worst classes of distress, especially total reserve holdings and the share\nof customer loans.\nFourth, to assess the economic signicance of our results we also report marginal\neects since coecient estimates of hazard rate models alone can be misleading. The\nrelevance of using a generalized ordered model is further underpinned by at times\nsubstantially dierent predictions of probabilities of distress of up to 60 basis points\nrelative to a simple ordered logit. In sum, we suggest that future hazard rate studies\nshould attempt to model dierent degrees of distress more explicitly.\nNichttechnische Zusammenfassung\nBankinsolvenzen unterscheiden sich von Insolvenzen au\u00fferhalb des Finanzwesens,\nda sie das Vertrauen in das Finanzsystem beeintr\u00e4chtigen k\u00f6nnen.

Hierzu werden unter anderem statistische Methoden genutzt, um durch\ndie Kombination von historischen Ausfalldaten mit bankspezischen Kennzahlen die\nAusfallwahrscheinlichkeit einer Bank vorherzusagen.\nDas Verst\u00e4ndnis des Ausfallbegris ist hierbei von oensichtlicher Bedeutung.\nEinerseits sind Bankenausf\u00e4lle in Gesetzen und Richtlinien eindeutig geregelt, zum\nBeispiel durch Mindesteigenkapitalanforderungen.

Beginning with the\nnumerous studies therefore seek to predict probabilities of bank default on the basis\nof nancial data.\nThese and most subsequent studies, such as Porath (2006), use a hazard model\nthat transforms a set of (mostly) bank-specic covariates observed in year t into\nthe probability of default (PD) with an appropriate link function (such as logit or\nprobit). The PD can be estimated with historical data of the covariates x observed\nin t and the actual state of default in t + 1. The individual bank PD in a given year\nPDit\nis the probability that bank i defaults within one year.\nThe denition of bank defaults usually follows the conventions applied by regu-\nlatory authorities. For example, most U.S. studies dene failure either as closure by\nregulators due to capital ratios falling below 2 percent or a merger assisted by the\nFDIC (Cole and Gunther, 1995).2 Clearly, the denition of bank default is crucial\nsince this is precisely the event of interest to policy makers and practitioners. In\ncontrast to non-nancial rms, however, this denition is non-trivial since outright\nbankruptcies used in the latter type of studies are rare in banking. This is because\nindividual bank failures may disrupt trust in the system as a whole, which explains\nwhy the industry is characterized by more intense regulation seeking to prevent\nindividual and systemic crises (Benink and Benston, 2005).\nFailure denitions are usually less obvious than they appear to be in the case\nof U.S. banking. For example, in our data no single bank violated regulatory min-\nimum capital requirements. But the scenario that no German bank was distressed\nsince 1993 seems unlikely. This nding more likely indicates that bank distress is\nsignalled already before outright failure events occur, which in turn ignite measures\n1Thomas.Kick@bundesbank.de (T.

We are grate-\nful for comments received at the Stress Testing Workshop hosted by the Deutsche Bundesbank\nand the NAKE conference hosted by the Dutch Central Bank. In particular, we thank Geraldo\nCerqueiro, Hans Degryse and Elmer Sterken for their feedback. We are also grateful to Frank Heid\nfor stimulating discussions and Ferre de Graeve, Rudi Vander Vennet and Volker Zeller for most\nvaluable comments. We thank the Deutsche Bundesbank for providing us with data. This paper is\npart of a research project funded by the \"Stiftung Geld und W\u00e4hrung\". The paper represents the\nauthors' personal opinions and does not necessarily reect the views of the Deutsche Bundesbank.\nAll remaining errors are of course our own.\n2FDIC: Federal Deposit Insurance Scheme.\ntaken by market participants and/or regulators to forestall disrupting bank closures.\nTherefore, observed failure events are usually unavailable for most banking markets\nto the public. Many (non-U.S.) studies therefore resort to alternative denitions.\nFor example, Dabos and Escudero (2004) analyze Argentinean bank failures dened\nas those that closed during the two year period following the Tequila crisis ignited\nby the devaluation of the Mexican Peso on December 20th, 1994. This denition is\nproblematic if some banks are taken over by competitors for entirely dierent rea-\nsons than distress resolution, for example the existence of just favorable acquisition\nconditions. In a study of German bank failures, Elsas (2004) denes events on the\nbasis of persistent membership in the worst annual deciles of the banking popula-\ntion's loan-loss provision share distribution. This categorization is also troublesome\nif probabilities of default are subsequently estimated with, among other factors,\ncredit quality for reasons of endogeneity.\nThese obstacles associated with the denition of bank distress are, however, not\nconned to bank failure studies outside the U.S. as noted by Oshinsky and Olin\n(2006). According to them, ocial failure is only one of many options how markets\nand regulators deal with troubled banks in general. They report for a sample of U.S.\nbanks that troubled banking rms merged, received capital assistances, recovered\nor merely continued to exist as a troubled bank. In fact, only ve percent of all\ntroubled banks in their sample were eventually closed. Other studies by Wheelock\nthat allow for multiple distress and/or exit events conrm that troubled banks do\nnot face a dichotomous destiny limited to survival or failure only.\nBut to our knowledge neither of these studies account for the pecking order that\nwe hypothesize to exist between dierent states of distress when predicting bank\nPD's. Only one study by DeYoung et al. (2001) on U.S. bank ratings is method-\nologically related to ours. The authors compare supervisory CAMEL bank ratings\nto the market's evaluation inherent in subordinated debt risk spreads of the parent\nbanking rm.3 For the case of U.S. banks, CAMEL ratings result from both o-site\nnancial information as well as expert evaluations formed during on-site inspections\n(King et al., 2005). Hence, the authors hypothesize that condential CAMEL su-\npervisory ratings contain additional information compared to evaluations of other\nmarket monitors, such as rating agencies. To extract the condential, additional\ninformation inherent in CAMEL ratings they use an ordered logit model to regress\npublicly available nancial information on these ratings.4 DeYoung et al. (2001) ar-\ngue that the residuals from this regression capture the private information available\nto regulators due to on-site inspections. Subsequently, they analyze if and when\nan option-adjusted risk premium on subordinated debt is adjusted for these added\ninformation. They nd that on-site inspections yield indeed additional information\nthat is at times priced only slowly into markets risk premia.\nWe argue that this and previous studies on bank failure suer from three prob-\nlems that we seek to address in our study. First, any (CAMEL) rating results from\nassigning (an) estimated (distribution of) probabilities of default to rating classes.\nThese classes are by denition ordinally scaled. However, whether estimated proba-\nbilities account for the ordinal nature of the observed event of interest depends on\n3CAMEL: Capitalization, Asset Quality, Management, Earnings and Liquidity.\n4CAMEL ratings range from 1 (least severe) to 5 (most severe).\nthe previously discussed denition of distress in the rst place. While U.S. super-\nvisors' CAMEL ratings may include valuable private information, it subsequently\nrepresents an addition to explanatory variables in a dichotomous failure model in-\nstead of a more dierentiated denition of bank distress events on the left-hand side\n(King et al., 2005). Second, the approach by DeYoung et al. (2001) to regress public\nnancial information on condential CAMEL ratings is infeasible for most European\nbanking markets since, in contrast to the U.S., the vast majority of banking rms\nare not traded publicly. Hence, most banks do not report nancial statements, let\nalone additional qualitative information, for example on asset quality, to the public.\nThird, if distressed events are ordered events, it should be tested if not only inter-\ncepts of estimated hazard functions capture increasing degrees of distress but also\nif individual slope coecients dier across distress categories. We seek to ll these\ngaps with our study on German universal bank distress using a generalized ordered\nlogit model.\nWe use a unique data set collected by the German central bank on a variety\nder these records according to severity into four categories. The rst and weakest\ncategory I of distress includes compulsory notications of regulatory authorities as\nstipulated in the German Banking Act (\"Kreditwesengesetz, KWG\").5 The second\ndistress category II comprises ocial warnings or disagreements of the regulatory\nauthority, the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (\"Bundesanstalt f\u00fcr Finanz-\ndienstleistungsaufsicht, BaFin\"). The next distress category III are interventions by\nthe respective banking sector's insurance scheme in the form of capital injections\nas well as binding measures issued by the BaFin, for example restrictions to lend-\ning and deposit taking. We argue that in contrast to the former category, these\ndistress events represent an active intrusion into the management of the banking\nrm that curbs perfectly free market competition. Finally, category IV comprises\ndistress events that entail the exit of a bank from the market, either through clo-\nsure ignited by the regulator in charge, the BaFin, or through mergers classied\nas restructuring mergers. The latter are usually ignited by the respective banking\npillars' head associations (the German Savings and Giro Association, \"Deutscher\nSparkassen und Giroverband, DSGV\" and the Federal Association of Cooperative\nBanks, \"Bundesverband der Deutschen Volksbanken und Raieisenbanken, BVR\").\nWe hypothesize that these four categories of events reect fundamentally dierent\nkinds of distress that require more explicit modeling. While the particular choice of\ndistress events here is in line with the institutional and regulatory regime prevailing\nin German banking, we argue that the logic of dierent degrees of distress applies to\nother banking systems, too: some banks catch attention by regulators for suboptimal\nperformance while others need to be closed or forced out of the market through\nmergers to avoid jeopardy of the system's stability.\nOur results conrm that bank distress events can be modeled by the ordered logit\napproach. Using both bank-specic and regional macroeconomic covariates, we nd\nthat distress is increasingly less likely for well-capitalized, protable banks and more\nlikely for banks with low levels of total reserves and high shares of poor quality loans.\nThese ndings are qualitatively well in line with previous studies on bank distress\n5We introduce the institutional setting of German banking supervision in section 2.\nmodel improves on previous studies in three important respects. First, we nd that\nthe proportional odds assumption implicit in traditional limited dependent analyses\nof the banking industry is violated. Put dierently, the sensitivity of the respective\nprobabilities for a change in individual covariates is not identical for dierent kinds\nof ordered distress events. For example, an increase in the capitalization ratio has a\nstrong reducing eect on category I and II distress events. However, it is of minor\nrelevance to reduce the likelihood of more severe distress events. Second, our model\nincludes not only small savings and cooperative banks but also large banks from\nall three banking sectors, commercial, savings and cooperatives.6 Since especially\nlarge banks did not experience absorbing failure events, such as closure or forced\ntakeovers, this important sector of the industry has not been analyzed previously.\nThird, compared to most other bank failure studies, the accuracy of our model\nto correctly classify (ordered) failures from non-failures is high. This supports our\nargument to model dierent degrees of bank hazards more explicitly.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we briey intro-\nduce the institutional supervision setting in German banking. In section 3 we discuss\nnext our distress data, the choice and hypotheses regarding explanatory covariates\nand present also our empirical model. We present major ndings subsequently in\nsection 4 and conclude in section 5.\n2 Institutional background\nDespite ongoing harmonization since the late 1980's the supervisory landscape in\nEuropean banking is still heterogenous (Carletti et al., 2006). In most countries a\nsingle institution is responsible for banking supervision. This is usually the central\nbank, which in turn is typically accountable to the Ministry of Finance (Barth\net al., 2001). In Germany, two institutions supervise banks. The rst is the Federal\nFinancial Supervisory Authority (\"Bundesanstalt f\u00fcr Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht,\nBaFin\") and the second is the German central bank, the Deutsche Bundesbank\n(BBK).\nThe BaFin is responsible for all sovereign measures. This includes licensing\nand potentially closing individual institutions, but also issuing general instructions\nfor carrying out banking business, providing nancial services and limiting risks.\nThe Bundesbank is assigned most of the operational tasks in banking supervi-\nsion. These are the issuing of principles and regulations, the process of ongoing\nsupervision (except individual regulatory measures vis-\u00e0-vis institutions), pruden-\ntial audits, international cooperation/coordination in the prudential eld, and crisis\nmanagement. Especially through its ongoing monitoring activities using its network\nof branches (\"Hauptverwaltungen\") across Germany, the Bundesbank collaborates\n6This group includes the big ve commercial banks, central cooperative and central savings\nbanks (\"Landesbanken\") since they operate on a(n) (inter)national basis and share more character-\nistics across banking sectors compared to the prole of their respective pillar's smaller competitors\nwith the BaFin in the eld of banking supervision (Deutsche Bundesbank and BaFin,\nAs a general rule of the Banking Act, the supervisory agencies should minimize\ndirect interference in the individual operations of nancial institutions. An explicit\naim of the Banking Act is to leave the responsibility for business operations to\nmanagers of the nancial institutions. In general, banking supervision restricts the\nactivities of the nancial institutions primarily by qualitative and quantitative gen-\neral provisions and requires banks to open their books to the supervisory authorities.\nHowever, the BaFin may also decide to intervene more directly if deemed necessary.\nOn a regular and annual basis, all banks report balance sheets, prot and loss\naccounts as well as compulsory audit reports compiled by independent auditors\nto the Bundesbank. In addition, Bundesbank auditors conduct less frequent on-\nsite examinations of banks. Violations of the Banking Act are forwarded by the\nBundesbank to the BaFin, which after examination formulates next steps to intensify\nsupervision or issue sanctions.7\nThe BaFin has a range of measures to intervene when a bank fails to meet\nregulatory requirements or poses a threat to stability. Most of these measures are\nof a warning nature, for example hearings of the banking board, admonishments\nof executives or sending formal letters of warning. The BaFin can also issue more\nstrict interventions, such as prohibiting to grant new credit or ultimately to ignite\nclosure of the bank.8 Before such measures are applied, the institution is typically\ngiven time to correct the deciency. This gradual approach of intensied supervision\nis exactly representative of ordered distress events banks can experience.\nWith or without having received warnings by the BaFin, banks may experience\nfurther distress in the sense of receiving assistance by their respective sector's head\norganization. The three sectors, also known as banking pillars (Koetter et al., 2006)\nare commercial, savings and cooperative banks, all of which maintain self-organized\ninsurance funds. Akin to capital injections to local U.S. banks through their bank\nholding company (Oshinsky and Olin, 2006), the scheme of private commercial banks\n(Deposit Guarantee Fund of the Federal Association of German Banks, \"Einlagen-\nsicherungsfonds des Bundesverbandes deutscher Banken\"), the head association of\nsavings banks (German Savings and Giro Association, \"Deutscher Sparkassen und\nGiroverband, DSGV\") and cooperative banks (Federal Association of Cooperative\nBanks, \"Bundesverband der Deutschen Volksbanken und Raieisenbanken, BVR\")\nmay support troubled members by means of capital injections.9 In addition, failure\nto comply with earlier warnings issued by the regulator may lead to increasingly\nbinding sanctions such as for example the prohibition of prot distributions.\nIn sum, banking supervision in Germany involves a tight network of regulators\nfrom both the Bundesbank and the BaFin as well as the close involvement of the\nrespective banking sector's head organizations and auditors. Bank distress occurs\n7Note, however, that the banking act stipulates that the BaFin shall base its regulatory measures\non the Deutsche Bundesbank's audit ndings and appraisals.\n8Technically, it is the bank itself that has to le bankruptcy.\n9Note that the scheme of private commercial banks entails deposit insurance while the latter\ntwo involve a further reaching general insurance against bank insolvency (\"Institutssicherung\").\nin multiple shades, ranging from early warning signals igniting formal indication to\nauthorities required by law to forced closure by the BaFin. We discuss next our\nempirical model to capture the order of these events, distress denitions and our\nchoice of explanatory variables.\n3 Methodology and data\nDistress categories We collect data from records gathered by the Bundesbank about\ndistress events among universal German banks of all three sectors between 1994 and\n2004. As stressed in section 2 it should be noted that these records do not represent\ninterventions of the Bundesbank itself. Rather, the data represent a comprehen-\nsive collection of notications from banks as required by law, own records of the\nBundesbank regarding early warning signals on the basis of reported balance sheet,\nprot and loss account as well as audit report data, supportive actions taken by the\nsectors' head associations and nally measures taken by the BaFin.\nIn addition to the rst group of non-distressed bank year observations, we cate-\ngorize four groups of distressed events of increasing severity. The respective distri-\nbutions over time are shown in table 1. The rst group of weakest events comprise\nthree incidents. First, a decline of annual operational prots of more than 25 percent.\nSecond, a notication by banks of losses amounting to 25 percent of liable capital.\nThird, notications by banks about events that may jeopardize the existence of the\nbank as a going concern. The latter two incidents are compulsory notications as\nstipulated in 29(3) and 24(1), respectively, of the Banking Act. None of these\nevents implies per se a change of the bank as a going concern. Distress events of\nthis category reect instead the earliest signs of problems and are of of an indicative\nnature.\nThe second category of distressed events captures measures taken by the BaFin\nrepresenting ocial warnings or disagreement. Hence, none of these measures implied\nan active intrusion into the ongoing business operations of the bank. In total, our\ndata distinguishes 59 dierent kinds of measures. We allocate 26 to more severe\ncategories of events since they include the explicit prohibition of certain activities or\neven closure of the bank. From the remaining 24 events around 80% involve one of\nthe four following measures: admonishment hearings, disapproval, warnings to CEO,\nand serious letters.10\nWe regard these events as the second worst distress category since they reect\ncorrective actions regarding management and business processes by means of warn-\ning the bank ocially. Note that we do not investigate here the appropriateness of\nany such actions. Instead, we merely observe that a considerable number of banks\nwere subjected to such corrective actions. However, none of these implied an out-\nright market distortion, such as a subsidy, but represent early warnings of ocial\ndisapproval.\n10We neglect nine kinds of events either due to missing data or not representing distress, for\nexample the sending of regular letters.\nYear Distress category Total\nIn contrast, our next distress category captures those incidents where the bank\neither received support from their respective head association in the form of capital\npreservation measures or was limited in it's scope of operations by the BaFin. We\nargue that the former kind of intervention is a more drastic class of distress since\nit suggests that compliance with legal capitalization requirements was suciently\nendangered as to actively subsidize the bank. In addition, we classify the following\nmeasures by the BaFin as category III distress events: orders to restructure opera-\ntions, restrictions to lending, deposit taking, equity withdrawal or prot distribution\nand the dismissal of the Chief Operating Ocer. These interventions represent ac-\ntive intrusions into the ongoing management of the bank and thus represent severe\ndistress according to our denition.\nOur last distress category includes all those events which imply the bank to\ncease as a going concern. This class comprises two events. The rst are takeovers\nclassied by the Bundesbank as restructuring mergers.11 These are usually ignited\nby head organizations if alternative measures seem futile or if previous measures did\nnot improve the bank's situation. The second class are enforced closures of banks\ninitiated by the BaFin, which are extremely rare. This ultimate level of distressed\nevents are absorbing incidents that cause the bank to terminate it's operations and\nexit the market.\nSpecication We thus want to estimate the probability P that the ordinal distress\nindicator Y of bank i takes on the value j = 1, .., M, where M is the number of\nevent classes. To this end, Greene (2003) writes an ordered logit as\n11Note that these mergers are not ordered but merely classied as such by the Bundesbank.\nP(Yi\n> j) = g(Xi\n) =\nexp(j\n+ Xi\n)\n+ Xi\n)\nwhere Xi\nis a vector of explanatory variables for bank i and  and  are pa-\nrameters to estimate. Note that this model nests the more commonly used logistic\nregression model if M = 2 in equation (1). Moreover, if our categorization of dis-\ntressed events indeed reects increasing severity, we expect the j hazard functions\nintercepts j\nto exhibit increasingly large negative values (Greene, 2003).\nAn important assumption in this model that is usually only briey mentioned is\nthe so-called parallel odds assumption. Note that in equation (1) only the constant\ncut-o parameters j\ndier across distress categories. In turn, the slope parameters\nof the link function are assumed to be identical. Put dierently, the eect of a change\nin Xi\n, for example protability or asset quality, is expected to have the same eect\non the probabilities of weak distress incidents and forced closures, respectively.12\nOnly few studies mention this assumption explicitly (Clogg and Shihadeh, 1994),\nwhich in our case seems to be particularly inappropriate. Therefore, we follow the\nsuggestion of Williams (2006) and specify instead a generalized ordered logit model\n(GOLT). This model allows not only for intercepts specic to dierent categories j,\nbut also for alternative slope parameters:\nP(Yi\n> j) = g(j\nXi\n) =\nexp(j\n+ j\nXi\n)\n+ j\nXi\n)\nThe respective probabilities that Yi\nwill take on values j = 1, .., M are given by\nP(Yi\nXi\nP(Yi\n= j) = g(j-1\nXi\n) - g(j\n+ j\nXi\n) , for j = 2, .., M - 1, (3b)\nP(Yi\n= M) = g(M-1\nXi\nHence, the generalized ordered logit model is equivalent to a series of simple\nlogistic regressions that lump the ordered dependent variables' categories into one.\nIn our case with M = 5, for example, category j = 1 is compared with categories\nj = 2, .., 4 as a reference group. Likewise, for j = 3 the comparison is between groups\n1 through 3 relative to groups 4 and 5.13 We test below whether the proportional\nodds assumptions is (partly) violated and provide also a comparison of resulting PD\ndistributions from the most commonly employed logistic regression in comparison\n12Clearly, the logistic regression model is even more restrictive since also the 's are assumed to\nbe identical.\n13Alternatively, one may model the events as a multinomial logit model, which also allows for\ngroup-specic slope coecients (see for example Koetter et al. (2006) and Focarelli et al. (2002)).\nTwo drawbacks of this model are, rst, the neglect of the ordinal nature of events and, second, a\nlarger number of parameters to estimate (Williams, 2006).\nto the (generalized) ordered logit models. Before turning to our results, let us turn\nbriey to our selection procedure for the vector of explanatory covariates.\nExplanatory variables To estimate respective probabilities of distress, we fol-\nlow the nancial economics literature and select nancial covariates resembling the\nCAMEL prole of the bank as well as macroeconomic covariates. Our selection pro-\ncedure follows the suggestion of Hosmer and Lemshow (2000) and unfolds in short as\nfollows. First, we generate a long list of potential CAMEL candidates of around 150\ncovariates. Second, we shortlist around 50 covariates on the basis of univariate ex-\nplanatory power for both category-specic and pooled failure events such that each\nCAMEL category is covered. Next, we select a further reduced vector of covariates\nwith stepwise logistic regression. Finally, we select the nal vector of covariates on\nthe basis of statistical and economic signicance. This procedure leaves us with nine\ncovariates for which we depict mean values per event category in table 2.14\nDistress category\nVariable 0 I II III IV Total\nEquity ratio c1\nTotal reserves c2\nRisky loans a1\nCustomer loans a2\nOBS activities a3\nCost eciency m1\nLiquidity l1\nNotes: All variables measured in percent. c1\n: Core capital to risk-weighted assets,\nreserves to total assets, a1\n: Provisioned loans and loans with\nincreased risks to audited loans, a2\n: Customer loans to total assets,\n: O balance sheet activities to total assets, e1\n: Operating results to\nbalance sheet total, m1\n: Cost eciency, l1\n: Net interbank assets and\ncash to total assets, INS: Corporate insolvency ratio per state ('Bundesland').\nWe expect that better capitalized banks are in general less prone to experience\ndistressed events. We therefore specify, rst, the equity ratio and, second, the to-\ntal reserve ratio. Especially the latter include in line with German accounting rules\n14As in Koetter et al. (2006), we choose a lag of one period based on univariate explanatory\npower. Qualitatively, results for lags of up to three years are not aected.\nundisclosed reserves (\"Stille Reserven\") and we expect negative coecients for both\nvariables. Next, we specify three variables to capture asset quality: the share of cus-\ntomer loans, the share of risky loans and the share of o-balance sheet activities.\nCompared to interbank or government loans, a larger share of customer loans ex-\nposes the bank to higher credit risk (Porath, 2006). Clearly, a larger share of risky\nloans should also increase cet. par. the likelihood of a bank to fail. Finally, o-balance\nsheet activities comprise primarily credit commitments, which may bear risks if nu-\nmerous (large) customers draw simultaneously on these lines, for example due to\na common macroeconomic shock. Thus, we expect for all three that higher shares\nincrease the probability of distress and thus yield positive coecients. Measuring the\nmanagerial quality of the bank is dicult without on-site inspection and resulting\nqualitative information. Many studies rely instead on cost-income ratios to assess\nthe ability of managers to minimize administrative expenses when generating rev-\nenues. But as noted for example by Wheelock and Wilson (2000), high cost-income\nratios may merely indicate competitive markets where prices are driven towards\nmarginal cost. Then, cost income ratios contain presumably little information about\nmanagerial quality. As an alternative o-site measure, we use cost eciency scores\ngenerated with stochastic frontier analysis. Assuming that markets are competitive,\nineciency arises on the cost side if a bank employs too many input factors or wrong\nproportions of dierent input factors. Such deviations would systematically lead to\nhigher than optimal cost. Consequently, we hypothesize that higher cost eciency\nreduces the probability of distress. The mechanics to obtain bank-specic estimates\nfrom this cost minimization model are provided in the appendix. We capture the\nprotability of banks by return on equity and account for their liquidity with the\nratio of cash and short run net interbank assets relative to total assets. To control\nfor (regional) macroeconomic conditions, we also include the corporate insolvency\nratio per federal state and expect that fewer troublesome customers also reduce the\ndistress probabilities of banks.\nOnly few banks in our sample experienced multiple events over time. Nonetheless,\nwe note that bank distress may very well depend on previous states of distress.15\nTherefore, we control for a bank's previous state of distress by means of a memory\nvariable MEMj\nfor j = 2, 3, 4.16 This is a dummy variable that takes on a value of\none if the bank experienced a (distressed) event j in it's history.17 In addition, we use\na robust sandwich estimator that allows for dependence across yearly observations\nper bank to obtain standard errors.18\nare subject to maximal two events during 1995 and 2004. The maximum number of multiple events\nper bank is six, but applies only to one institute. Excluding banks with multiple events did not\naect our results qualitatively.\n16Note that group j = 1 comprise non-distressed bank years. Groups 2 through 4, in turn,\nrepresent distress categories I to III.\n17Obviously, absorbing distress events covered in category IV are not considered.\n18Ideally, we could specify a generalized ordered logit model as a panel. However, to our knowl-\nedge, no such estimator exists for polytomonous response models in general, let alone for the gener-\nalized ordered logit. As an additional robustness check we follow Hosmer and Lemshow (2000) and\ncompare for each distress category results from binary logistic regressions with panel estimations\nWe depict results from four hazard rate models in table 3. All four models are nested\nin the generalized ordered logit model in equation (2). Consider rst the simplest\ncase of a basic binomial logit model (column BLT), where all four distress categories\nare pooled into one dichotomous dependent event. The discriminatory power of this\nmodel is high as witnessed by a value of 0.804 for the Area Under the Receiver\nOperating Characteristics Curve (AUR) and a pseudo R2 of 14.7%.19 Coecient\nestimates for the various components of banks' nancial proles are highly signi-\ncant and in line with both expectations and previous results in the literature. Better\ncapitalization, higher protability and eciency as well as more favorable macroe-\nconomic conditions all reduce the likelihood of distress. In turn, higher exposures\nto customer credit and o-balance sheet activities, poor loan quality and excessive\nliquidity holdings all imply a higher probability of distress. To evaluate the economic\nsignicance of individual covariates eects it may, however, be misleading to rely on\ncoecient estimates alone. Hosmer and Lemshow (2000) suggest to consult instead\nmarginal eects. Before doing so, we test whether this model is the most adequate\none available to draw inference.\nfor dichotomous responses and nd hardly any qualitative dierence.\n19AUR values measure the ability of the model to discriminate between event and control group\nobservations for a range of cut-o probabilities from zero to one. Values around 0.7 are considered\ngood, those around 0.8 are excellent (Hosmer and Lemshow, 2000).\nTable 3: Hazard estimations of German bank distress\nNotes: Robust standard errors; ,, denote signicant at the 10,5,1 percent level, respectively. For variable descriptions see table 2.\n1) Binomial logit model; 2) Ordered logit model; 3) Generalized ordered model; 4) Partial proportional odds model.\nConsider to this end next the ordered logit model depicted in column OLT.\nCategory specic intercept estimates conrm that distress events among German\nbanks exhibit a pecking order of ascending severity. All four estimated intercepts\nexhibit the expected order in terms of magnitude (Greene, 2003; Williams, 2006).\nAll estimated intercepts are signicantly dierent from zero. More importantly, the\nhypothesis of identical intercepts j\nis also rejected. We report the according 2 test\nstatistic as well as p-values from a Wald test of identical intercept coecients in\nthe top panel of table 4. The six individual tests on signicant dierence between\nj\n's yield that dierences are unequal from zero. Finally, the hypothesis of joint\nequality of individual intercept parameters is rejected, too. In sum, specication\ntests support the use of an ordered logit model as opposed to the more commonly\nemployed binomial logit model.\nTable 4: Specication tests for the generalized ordered model\nAll i\nGOLT\nPPOM\nHowever, it remains at this stage unclear whether slope coecients dier, too.\nWe consider it likely that, for example, an increase in the equity ratio aects the\nrespective likelihoods of distressed events of dierent order to varying degrees. As\na next specication test, we thus allow all slope coecients j\nto vary across cat-\negories j = 1, .., 5. Estimated coecients from a generalized ordered logit model\n(GOLT) are depicted for each category in the accordingly labelled columns in table\n3. The direction of individual coecients remains stable compared to the BLT and\nOLT specication. To interpret individual coecients note the varying categories\ncontrasted with each other for a change of individual covariates. For example, a co-\nfor equity of -0.045 implies that an improvement of equity ratios reduces\nthe likelihood of distress according to category I or higher relative to not experi-\nencing distress. Likewise, 2\nfor equity ratios of -0.058 compares the likelihood of\nexperiencing categories II through IV distress relative to no or only weakest distress\naccording to category I. The 2 test statistics of joint identity of slope coecients on\nthe one hand and of equal slope and intercept coecients in the mid-panel of table\n4 clearly reject these hypotheses at the 1% percent level, respectively. We conclude\nthat hazard rate models for German universal banks should account not only for\ndierent degrees of distress but also for the varying eects of changes in nancial\nproles on these ordered distress categories.\nFinally, note that some coecients exhibit fairly small dierences in estimated\nparameters across categories in table 3, for example return on equity and risky\nloans. Therefore, we test the so-called partial-proportional odds assumption. The\nnull hypothesis is that some coecients are equal across dependent categories while\nother parts of the hazard function do dier. We test for all possible combinations of\nindividual coecients if slope coecients across categories are identical and identify\nfour coecients, which can be restricted. 20 The resulting parsimonious model that\nwe use to draw inference restricts risky and customer loan shares as well as return on\nequity and one memory variable to be identical across j = 1, .., 5. The test statistic\nat the bottom label of table 4 conrms that the partial proportional odds model\n(PPOM) does not violate the assumption of non-equal slope coecients for these\nIn sum, the exible PPOM model adds important qualitative information. First,\nwe note that some covariates are only signicant for the likelihood of weaker forms\nof bank distress. Deteriorating equity ratios and lower cost eciency decrease only\nthe likelihood of weaker distress events signicantly. Likewise, corporate insolvencies\nas a proxy for macroeconomic conditions seem helpful to indicate signals of early\nand medium stress but do not help to explain ultimate bank failure in the form of\neither takeovers or closure. Our results thus suggest that bank exit due to distress\ndepends to the largest extent on bank idiosyncratic factors while only weaker forms\nof stress are more dependent on the business cycle.\nSecond, dierent elements of banks' nancial conditions are of varying impor-\ntance depending on the severity of trouble. Estimated coecients suggest that the\nrole of reduced total reserves is of increasing importance for worse degrees of distress.\nIn contrast, all other nancial ratios that are also signicant determinants of worst\ncase distress, exhibit a constant coecient across all categories. This result implies\nthat banks on the brink of failure react more sensitive to a given deterioration of\nreserves compared to banks in less troublesome states. This result is important to\nimprove our knowledge regarding which components of banks' nancial proles to\n20To conserve on space we do not provide all test statistics here. They are available upon request\nfrom the authors.\n21Note, that the log-likelihood for the PPOM is slightly worse compared to the most general\nGOLT model. Presumably, the gain from more degrees of freedom is too small to compensate for\nthe information lost by imposing the restrictions. For example, the GOLT coecients on risky\nloans are almost all identical with the exception of 3\n. It depends hence on the signicance level\nchosen whether to impose the constraint in the PPOM or not. Here, we chose the 5% level to test\nfor imposable constraints. A more restrictive approach using the 1% level led as expected to fewer\nrestrictions and also a higher log-likelihood value of the PPOM compared to the GOLT.\naddress when resolving the most troublesome situations in the banking system.\nThird, an important additional determinant of distress in the subsequent period\nis a bank's history of trouble. On the one hand the weakest form of distress appears\nto have no discriminatory power between further deterioration of distress versus\nremaining in or below the current distress category. Potentially, this result suggests\nthat automatically ignited indications of trouble required by law contain only limited\ninformation about the true state of the bank. On the other hand, both remaining\nmemory variables indicate that having experienced a distressed event of medium\norder in the past increases the odds to be subject to an even higher order of stress for\na given nancial prole. This result suggests that once a bank is somewhat troubled,\na further deterioration of it's nancial position is more likely than not. Note, however,\nthat our approach here cannot fully explain what distinguishes troubled banks, which\nmanage to recover from those that do manage turning around the bank.22\nIn sum, the parsimonious partial proportional odds model is well suited to esti-\nmate dierent distress probabilities. But to assess economically signicant determi-\nnants of bank distress categories, we need to consider marginal eects in addition\nto estimated coecients. We depict marginal eects for each category j = 1, ..5,\nevaluated at the mean of x, in table 5.\nWe report marginal eects as semi-elasticities y/lnx evaluated at the mean,\nwhich are denoted in basis points in table 4. For example, a reported marginal eect\nof 0.96 for the equity ratio in group 0 implies an increase in the probability of\nno-distress by 0.96 basis points due to a 1% increase in the ratio.\nOur most important conclusion is that the economic importance of dierent com-\nponents of banks' nancial proles diers across distress categories. The changing\nmagnitude and signicance of individual marginal eects across distress categories\nhighlights that attempts of bankers and regulators to reduce the likelihood of distress\nrequire a more dierentiated mix of measures to be eective. Our results conrm\nthat total reserve holdings are of increasing importance to avoid absorbing events in\ncategory IV, but have no signicant contribution to avoid weakest distress. Strategies\naiming to increase protability are of importance for all four degrees of distress.23\nHowever, this appears particularly helpful in medium ranges of distress, while nal\nexit PDs can be reduced by as much as 0.88 basis points when reducing the share of\ncustomer loans by 1%. Marginal eects of the history of increasingly worse distressed\nevents appear to determine future trouble to a much lesser extent compared to the\npreviously reported coecient estimates. While this underlines the importance of\nnot relying on the latter only to draw inference, this result also suggests some path\ndependency for troubled banks.\nThe likelihood not to experience any distress event is most aected by cost ef-\ncient operations and few customer loans. An increase in either measure by one\n22Such an analysis requires in our view not only a sole focus on troubled banks but also further\ninformation on e.g. measures taken by dierent banks to recover. We consider this research question\nout of the present paper's scope and postpone the issue to future research.\n23Since we report semi-elasticities on probabilities of distress, marginal eects also dier for co-\nvariates with restricted coecients (see equation (2)). These would only be identical when reporting\neects on scores instead of PD.\nTable 5: Marginal eects for the partial proportional odds model\nVariable Category \u00af\nx\nNotes: marginal eects evaluated at the mean as semi-elasticities y/lnx,\nmeasured in basis points. ,, denote signicant at the 10,5,1 percent\nlevel, respectively.\npercent, improves the probability of no-distress by 2.6 or 3.3 basis points. Other\ncrucial components of bank's nancial prole that increase the likelihood of sta-\nbility are capitalization, especially reserves, and protability. While better regional\nmacroeconomic conditions, measured by corporate insolvencies have a signicant\nimpact on the probability of no-distress, the magnitude of marginal eects sug-\ngests that nancial stability is primarily driven by bank-specic factors. In line with\nestimated coecients not signicantly dierent from zero, having experienced the\nweakest kind of distress in the past does not inuence the likelihood of further failure\nsignicantly. Early warning signals reected by compulsory notications appear to\nhave little predictive power of more severe degrees of distress.\nDespite statistically signicantly dierent coecients compared to more restricted\nhazard models as well as economically signicant marginal eects, the usefulness of\nthe PPOM regarding rating banks in the industry may be doubted. One may argue\nthat the direction and magnitude of estimated coecients reported for the binomial\nand ordered logit models in table 3 does not dier substantially. For rating purposes,\nit is therefore also interesting to compare resulting distributions of probabilities of\ndistress. Consider to this end gure 1, which depicts box plots of the dierences\nbetween probabilities of distress between the ordered and the partial proportional\nFigure 1: Dierences in probabilities of distress according to OLT and PPOM\nPD difference in percentage points\nLarge Banks Commercial Banks Savings Banks Cooperative Banks\nOrdered Logit Model (OLT) vs. Partial Proportional Odds Model (PPOM)\nDistress Category I Distress Category II\nDistress Category III Distress Category IV\nFigure 1 illustrates the added information in contrast to dichotomous hazard\nrate models. The partially restricted generalized ordered model add allows us to\nassess probabilities per distress category, which we depict here per banking group.\nPredicted probabilities of distress dier up to 60 basis points between the preferred\nPPOM and the less exible ordered logit model with common slope coecients.\nGiven an expected overall frequency of 4.4 percentage points (see table 1), this dif-\nference is economically signicant and suggests a more dierentiated view of distress\nwhen rating banks.\nConsider also dierences in PD's between models per banking group. It is rst of\nall important to note that for large banks both models do not yield very dierent\nresults. This is comforting since it implies that especially for this important group\nof banks potential specication problems due to the neglect of dierent orders of\ndistress seem small.25\n24We do not depict distributions of probabilities of distress for reasons of condentiality.\n25Note that this result merely reects a similar appropriateness of both models to estimate\nlarge bank distress. It need not imply that either is particularly suited. Given the low number\nof observations of large banks in general and that of only few distressed events in particular, we\ntherefore caution to use only bank-specic point estimates for large banks of either hazard model\nto assess these bank's riskiness. Instead, regulators are certainly well advised for this group to rely\nDierences between models regarding local cooperative banks seem fairly mod-\nerate since they do not exceed 25 basis points. However, even such a dierence in\nPDs may already inuence a bank's rating and thus renancing cost substantially.\nIn turn, estimated PD dier the most for the group of commercial banks and, to a\nlesser extent, for local savings banks. More specically, allowing hazard functions to\ndier in individual covariate sensitivities yields markedly dierent PD for the worst\ndistress category. Since such absorbing distress events most likely cause the largest\ncost to society, it seems conservative to avoid the danger of underestimating these\nevents. While dierences between OLT and PPOM are distributed rather symmet-\nric for savings banks, worst category distress PD for commercial banks seem more\noften than not to be lower according to the more restricted OLT model compared\nto the suggested PPOM. Hence, we deem it prudent to at least consider this model\nin addition to more restricted hazard models when rating banks.\n5 Conclusion\nIn this paper we suggest a generalized ordered logit model to estimate probabilities\nof distress among German universal banks. Our sample includes commercial, savings\ndistinguish four dierent categories of distress events and group them in ascending\norder of severity of distress: (i) compulsory information of regulatory authorities\nabout potential threats; (ii) warning measures issued by regulatory authorities; (iii)\ncapital injections by sector insurances and binding measures of regulatory authori-\nties; (iv) restructuring mergers and forced closure initiated by regulatory authorities.\nWe identify a vector of bank-specic and regional macroeconomic variables that\npredicts probabilities of distress with high accuracy. We test if the model can be\nreduced to both a binary or ordered logit regression and reject both hypotheses.\nThus, our results support, rst, the ordinal nature of dierent distressed events\nand, second, the dierent sensitivity of given changes of banks' nancial proles on\ndierent events, respectively.\nOur results suggest that loan quality, cost eciency and capitalization are of\nimportance to explain weak orders of distress. However, deteriorating conditions\naccording to the latter two indicators have little explanatory power for more severe\ndistress events, which depend primarily on the former and total reserve holdings as\nwell as protability.\nWe also nd evidence that banks with a history of nancial trouble are signi-\ncantly more likely to be distressed in the future, too. While having experienced only\nthe weakest form of bank distress appears to have little implications for future dete-\nriorations of a bank's stability, especially medium degree distress events in the past\ncontribute to larger probabilities of further distress. We conclude that it is dicult\nto turn around a bank once certain degrees of distress have been surpassed. Thus,\non multiple sources of information, such as more intensive on-site examinations rather than o-site\nrating systems in general.\nfurther research investigating the determinants of successful restructuring seems ap-\npropriate.\nApart from statistically signicant evidence on estimated parameters in line with\nprevious evidence on bank failures, our results for marginal eects show that espe-\ncially the total reserves ratio and the customer loans ratio are of high economic\nsignicance. A one percent increase of the former decreases the likelihood to exit\ndue to failure by 0.73 basis points. Likewise, a one percent improvement in the share\nof customer loans reduces this PD by 0.88 basis points. In turn, corporate insolvency\nratios that measure the health of the regional corporate sector have no signicant\ninuence on worst case distress events of banks. Hence, especially higher order dis-\ntress events appear to depend only indirectly at best on (regional) macroeconomic\nconditions.\nFinally, our results pertain that the generalized ordered logit model's predictions\ndier at times substantially from restricted (ordered) logit analysis. We nd that,\ndepending on banking group and distress category, estimated PDs between the two\nmodels dier up to 70 basis points, which accounts for 20% of the observed mean\nprobability of distress. Moreover, our results highlight the foregone informational\nvalue of less restricted models since individual covariates inuence dierent distress\nevents to varying extents. With respect to managing bank risks this nding may be\nuseful for bankers and regulators.\nIn sum, the generalized model suggested in this paper allows a more dierentiated\nview of distressed events in banking. Future hazard studies should consider to model\nthe pecking order of distress as well as diering sensitivities to nancial bank proles\nmore explicitly.\n6 Appendix: Cost eciency estimation\nTo approximate the management qualities of banks we use the concept of X-eciency\nintroduced originally by Leibenstein (1966) and applied to bank eciency measure-\nment in a number of studies (Berger et al., 1993; Berger and Humphrey, 1997; Amel\net al., 2004). We assume that a bank k uses xed assets x1\n, labor x2\nand borrowed\nto produce three outputs: customer y1\nand interbank loans y2\nand nan-\ncial securities y3\n. If banks are price takers, they minimize cost C subject to given\ninput prices wi\nand production technology T(\u00b7), which depends on y, x, and further\ncontrols z. Input prices are calculated as in Koetter (2006) per regional market: de-\npreciation over xed assets for w1\n, personnel expenses over full time equivalents w2\nand total interest expenditure over total borrowed funds w3\n. To account for technical\nchange we further specify a general time trend t and include interaction terms with\noutputs, input prices and controls. The solution to this cost minimization problem\nyields an optimal cost functionC  (w, y, z), which we estimate with the following\ntranslog specication:\nln Ck\n+\ni\nln wik\n+\nm\nln ymk\n+ r\nln zkr\n+\nij\nln wik\nln wjk\n+\nim\nln wik\nln ymk\n+\nmn\nln ymk\nln ynk\n+\nr\n(ln zkr\n+\ni\nln wik\nln zkr\n+\nm\nln ymk\nln zkr\nt +\n+\ni\nln wik\nt +\nm\nln ymk\nt + r\nln zkr\nt + k\n.\nAfter imposing the necessary homogeneity and symmetry restrictions (Koetter,\n2006), we estimate equation (4) as a stochastic cost frontier. Any bank k can deviate\nfrom optimal cost due to random noise, vk\n, or inecient use of in- and outputs, uk\n.\nWe specify a composed total error, k\n. For a cost frontier ineciency leads to above\nfrontier costs. Therefore, the total error is k\n= uk\n+ vk\n. The random error term vk\nis assumed i.i.d. with vk  N(0, 2\nv\n) and independent of the explanatory variables.\nThe ineciency term is i.i.d. with uk  N|(\u00b5, 2\nu\n)| and independent of the vk\n. It\nis drawn from a non-negative distribution truncated at \u00b5. Descriptive statistics to\nestimate equation (4) are depicted in table 6.\nWe obtain bank-specic eciency measures as suggested by using the conditional\ndistribution of u given  (Jondrow et al., 1982). A point estimator of technical\neciency is given by E(uk\n|k\n), i.e. the mean of uk\ngiven k\n. Cost eciency per\nbank and year is calculated as [exp(-uk\n)] and equals one for a fully ecient bank.\nLikewise, CE of 0.9 implies that a bank could have produced an identical output\nvector with 90 percent of actually incurred cost.\nVariable SFA Mean SD Min Max N\nInterbank loans y1\nCustomer loans y2\nSecurities y3\nPrice of xed assets w1\nPrice of labor w2\nPrice of borrowed funds w3\nNotes: All outputs, equity and operating cost measured in millions of Euro; prices of xed\nassets and borrowed funds in percent; price of labor in thousands of Euro;\nReferences\nAltman, E.
