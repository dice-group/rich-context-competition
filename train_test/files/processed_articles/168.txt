Angel,1 Jacqueline L. Angel,2 Geum-Yong Lee,3\nand Kyriakos S. Markides4\nAlthough the United States is a nation of immigrants,\nthe public and their representatives are more con-\ncerned today with the potential welfare burden that\nnew immigrants might represent than with their po-\ntential contribution to our society (Fix & Passel, 1994;\nTreas, 1997). These sentiments have resulted in legis-\nlation that seriously restricts the eligibility of even\nlegal immigrants for social welfare and that requires\ntheir sponsors to guarantee support for five years\n(Friedland & Pankaj, 1997). These changes in social\nwelfare eligibility have important implications for fam-\nily reunification and for immigrants who come to this\ncountry in mature adulthood. Younger immigrants come\nto find work (Fix & Passel, 1994). Older immigrants,\nfor the most part, come to join their children and grand-\nchildren. Many simply do not have the resources nor\nthe opportunity to accumulate enough once they\narrive to support themselves in old age. As a conse-\nquence, older immigrants may remain permanently de-\npendent on their families.\nAlthough older immigrants still represent a small frac-\ntion of the total immigrant stream, recent changes in\nimmigration policy have resulted in an increase in the\nThis research was supported in part by a National Institute on Aging\nGrant, Ro1 AG-10939.

The new\nand harsher social welfare philosophy that denies many\nvulnerable individuals, including elderly immigrants,\naccess to public programs has serious implications for\nintergenerational relations and the welfare of both the\nold and the young. Although there is no way of knowing\nwhat the long-term effects of the restrictions on pub-\nlic support will be, our nation's experience with eco-\nnomic dependency suggests that the need that one\nlevel of government ceases to provide for must be pro-\nvided for by another level of government, or by other\ninstitutions. In the current anti-immigrant and antiwelfare\nclimate, families who, out of genuine affection and a\nsense of duty to their elders, wish to bring aging par-\nents to live with them, may be forced to choose be-\ntween those parents and other needs. Our national\ncommitment to family values requires that we begin\nto understand the impact of social policies on immi-\ngrant families.\nImmigrants and the Welfare Burden\nToday's immigrants are very different ethnically\nthan they were in the past. During the nineteenth\nand first half of the twentieth centuries immigrants to\nthe United States came primarily from Europe (Bean,\nCushing, Haynes, & Van Hook, 1997; Fuchs & Forbes,\n1985) and despite the differences between the new\nimmigrants and longer-term residents, the incorpora-\ntion of European Americans followed similar patterns\n1960s the composition of the immigrant population\nhas changed dramatically. Today those who arrive on\nour shores are primarily from Latin America and Asia\nand, because of limitations on the number of legal\nimmigrants allowed in, a significant number are illegal\n(Fix & Passel, 1994; Massey, Alarcon, Durand, & Gon-\nAlthough the actual welfare burden that these new\nimmigrants represent is a matter of debate, several studies\nbased on U.S. Census data show that, except for refu-\ngees who are legally eligible for public assistance upon\narrival, immigrants of working age are less likely than\nnatives of similar socioeconomic backgrounds to re-\nceive public assistance (Bean, Van Hook, & Glick, 1997;\n1992). There is a great deal of difference in the pro-\npensity of immigrants to use public support, however,\ndepending upon their nation of origin and age. Mexi-\ncan, Central American, and Asian immigrants draw\nupon public assistance at far higher rates than Euro-\npean immigrant groups, and regardless of their nation\nof origin, older immigrants draw upon Supplemental\nSecurity Income (SSI) at higher rates than native-born\nThe welfare picture for immigrants is, therefore, com-\nplex and it is clear that compositional differences among\ngroups, as well as their individual migration experi-\nences, influence their use of various forms of welfare.\nFor the most part, the higher rates of welfare use by\nAsian and Mexican/Central American immigrants are\naccounted for by their less favorable socioeconomic\nprofiles (Bean, Van Hook, & Glick, 1997; Tienda &\nJensen, 1986). In this article we examine the income\nsources and living arrangements of older Mexican-\norigin immigrants. We are particularly interested in the\nimpact of the age at which an individual comes to\nthe United States on his or her access to income from\nprivate pensions, Social Security, and SSI. Previous work\nmakes it clear that the most significant factor that\ndifferentiates the economically secure from the in-\nsecure in retirement is a private pension (Angel &\nAngel, 1997). If older Mexican immigrants are less\nlikely than natives or earlier migrants to have a pen-\nsion, and if they do not receive Social Security or SSI,\nthen they have nowhere to turn but to family mem-\nbers. This potential burden may play a role in a\nfamily's reunification decision. Even if an older indi-\nvidual provides useful domestic services, the financial\nburden he or she can potentially represent may make\nreunification impossible.\nThe Consequences of Later Life Migration\nOur examination of the consequences of one's age\nat migration is informed by a life-course perspective\nfrom which the motivations for, as well as the conse-\nquences of, migration differ for different age groups.\nChildren, of course, migrate because they accompany\ntheir parents. Young adults, for the most part, migrate\nto find jobs and a better place to raise their families.\nInternational migrants have historically been young\npeople and families seeking new opportunities. Older\npeople tend not to move, and sending areas often\nbecome old as the young migrate and leave their par-\nents and grandparents behind. At a certain point in\nlife, giving up one's familiar environment is too great\na cost to pay for uncertain gains in a totally new en-\nvironment. Those older individuals who do migrate\nusually do so to rejoin their families (Portes & Rumbaut,\ngrants, therefore, are selected both on the basis of\ntheir willingness to move and by the availability of\nsponsors in the receiving area.\nInternational migrants are overwhelmingly young be-\ncause the young are more adaptable than the old and\nfind it easier to learn a new language and culture.\nThose individuals who migrate in childhood are often\nindistinguishable in adulthood from the native born.\nBecause of their psychological and intellectual adapt-\nability, the young are better able to assimilate into the\nnew culture, to learn the workings of its institutions,\nand to become occupationally and economically suc-\ncessful. As a consequence, they have a good chance\nof becoming financially independent by the time of\nretirement.\nUnfortunately, as anyone who has attempted to\nlearn a second language in adulthood can testify, the\nease with which a language can be learned is lost fairly\nquickly, and the older one becomes the more diffi-\nculty he or she encounters in adapting to an entirely\nnew set of cultural rules and institutions. Of necessity,\ntherefore, the assimilation experience is far less com-\nplete, both culturally and structurally, for those who\nmigrate later in life than for those who migrate in\nchildhood or young adulthood (Angel & Angel, 1992;\nRogler, Gurak, & Cooney, 1987). In addition, those\nwho come with few resources and begin accumulat-\ning assets in mature adulthood simply do not have\nthe time necessary to amass a large reserve.\nToday, family reunification and migration by entire\nfamilies means that a significant number of individuals\ncome to the United States later in life (Angel & Angel,\nhaven both of choice and of necessity. Immigrants of\nall ages are more likely than the native born to live\nwith family members and to rely on them for assis-\ngrant, the family is often the only source of instru-\nmental and emotional assistance (Angel & Angel, 1992).\nClearly older individuals can provide valuable domes-\ntic services that allow other family members to enter\nthe labor force, thereby enhancing the overall eco-\nnomic welfare of a household (Angel & Tienda, 1982).\nNonetheless, because their own income remains low,\nthe option of living alone often does not exist, and\nthe needs of the older individual for economic sup-\nport often mean that they remain dependent on the\nfamily.\nIn what follows, we examine the consequences of\nthe age at which older Mexican Americans came to\nthe United States on their living arrangements and their\nsources of income. One's living arrangements and in-\ncome sources are closely linked because the adequacy\nof one's income determines whether one can live alone\n60 The Gerontologist\nif one chooses. Previous research also shows that the\nsources of one's retirement income greatly determine\nthe adequacy of one's retirement income. The largest\nfraction of the incomes of those retirees who are well\noff financially is from private pensions. Those older\nindividuals who must rely on Social Security alone or\non Supplemental Security Income (SSI) are far worse\nThe data on which the following analyses are based\nare from a new benchmark survey of older Mexican\nAmericans in five southwestern states. The topic is par-\nticularly timely because of recent changes in immigra-\ntion and welfare policy that may affect the elderly im-\nmigrant. Older immigrants who are sponsored by their\nchildren are forced into dependency on them by the\nfact that voluntary immigrants do not qualify for SSI\nfor a period of five years and by the fact that the\nincome and asset eligibility criteria for SSI are quite\nstringent. In determining eligibility for SSI the sponsor's\nincome and assets are taken into account. An older\nimmigrant may well, therefore, find himself or herself\npermanently dependent on family because neither em-\nployment nor public support are realistic options.\nData\nThe study employs data from the Hispanic Estab-\nlished Population for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly\n(HEPESE), a large, multistage probability sample of\nMexican Americans aged 65 and older who reside\nin the southwestern states of Arizona, California, Colo-\nrado, New Mexico, and Texas (Markides, Rudkin,\nAngel, & Espino, 1997). The present analysis is based\non the first wave of the study, which consists of a\nsurvey of 3,050 individuals. All respondents were in-\nterviewed in their homes for approximately two hours\nby trained interviewers who assessed their functional\ncapacity and collected information on nativity, age\nat migration, acculturation, demographics, household\nstructure, and socioeconomic resources. For those in-\ndividuals who were too cognitively or physically im-\npaired to participate in the study, information on ob-\njective questions was obtained from a proxy familiar\nwith the older person. Ten percent of the completed\ninterviews were either entirely or partially carried out\nwith a proxy's assistance.\nResults\nThe logic of the analysis is as follows. We begin\nwith detailed descriptions of the socioeconomic pro-\nfile, including detailed income sources, of older indi-\nviduals who immigrated at different ages and com-\npare them to the native born. We present these data\nseparately for men and women because income sources\nfor the two genders differ significantly in this sample.\nWe then examine the living arrangements of married\nand single older men and women who immigrated at\ndifferent ages and compare those with the living\narrangements of the native born. Finally we present\nlogistic regressions predicting the three major sources\nof income among the elderly, private pensions, Social\nSecurity, and Supplemental Security Income (SSI), to\ndetermine the net impact of age at migration on these\nvarious sources of income.\nTable 1 presents information on the socioeconomic\nprofile of Mexican-origin men 65 and older by the\nage at which they immigrated to the United States.\nThe last column presents information for the native\nborn. Table 2 presents similar information for Mexi-\ncan-origin women aged 65 and older. Because of the\ncomplex sampling design of the survey, we employ\nthe program package SUDAAN (Research Triangle In-\nstitute, 1995) to adjust for design effects in computing\ndescriptive statistics, parameter estimates, and tests of\nsignificance in all of the following analyses.\nTables 1 and 2 show that those older individuals\nwho immigrated when they were 50 years of age or\nolder have different income profiles than those who\ncame when they were younger. For both men and\nwomen, those who came in mature adulthood are more\nlikely than either natives or those who immigrated at\nyounger ages to report the lowest household incomes.\nThose who came when they were 50 or older are\nalso less likely than natives or those who came when\nthey were younger to receive Social Security. The find-\nings with regard to private pensions are striking. Al-\nthough those who migrated later in life are less likely\nto report having a private pension than either the na-\ntive born or those who came earlier in life, in none of\nthe age at migration groups does a substantial fraction\nof individuals receive income from a private pension.\nOnly 36% of native-born men report a private pen-\nsion and only 6.9% of those who immigrated after\nTable 1.

Because in-\ncome from a private pension is such an important de-\nterminant of an adequate income in old age, the lack\nof pension income has significant negative implications\nfor the Mexican origin elderly generally (Angel & An-\ngel, 1997). Finally, Table 1 reveals that for native-born\nmen and those who immigrated before age 20, the\nmilitary is a significant source of retirement income.\nIn our data this category includes those who receive\nRailroad Retirement income, but it consists overwhelm-\ningly of military retirees.\nSupplemental Security Income (SSI) is the means-\ntested support program for unemployed older indi-\nviduals who have not contributed enough to the sys-\ntem to qualify for regular earnings-based benefits. It is\na particularly important source of income for older\nindividuals with no private retirement income and few\nassets. Although there is some tendency for foreign-\nborn men to receive SSI at higher rates than the na-\ntive born, these differences are not statistically signifi-\ncant. Table 2 shows that women rely on SSI much\nmore heavily than men, but those who arrived later\nin life are less likely than those who arrived at the\nearliest age to receive SSI. Under the new guidelines,\nrecent immigrants are barred from receiving SSI for a\nperiod of five years. During this time they are entirely\ndependent on their sponsors for support.\nTable 2 also reveals that a larger fraction of those\nwomen who immigrated at age 50 or older receive\nmoney from children than those who came before\nage 20. In general, then, these data indicate that\nwomen who immigrated at 50 years of age or older\nare more dependent on their families for support\nMarried men\nNot head of household\nHead of household\nCouple alone\nUnweighted N\nSingle men\nNot head of household\nHead of household\nAlone\nUnweighted N\nAge\nat Migration\nOlder\nNative-\nBorn\n'Significantly different from the native born, p < .05.\nSignificantly different from those 50 or older, p < .05.\nthan are the native born or those who came earlier in\nlife.\nIn order to examine another aspect of older immi-\ngrants' dependency on family, in Tables 3 and 4 we\npresent information on the living arrangements of\nolder married and single Mexican-origin men and\nwomen, again by the age at which they immigrated\nto the United States. These tables illustrate the greater\ndependence of those who immigrated in mature adult-\nhood on others. Among married men and women,\nthose who came to the United States when they were\n50 or older are far less likely than the native born or\nthose who immigrated at earlier ages to be the head\nof the household^ in which they reside. Among single\nwomen (Table 4, second panel), those who came later\nin life are far more likely than the native born or those\nwho arrived earlier to live with someone else, but not\nas the head of household, and they are the least likely\nto live alone. These data, therefore, suggest that women\nwho come later in life are heavily dependent on their\nTable 4.

Clearly, at this level of disaggre-\ngation cell sizes become rather small so, although our\nfindings are suggestive, they are only tentative. Again\nthese data demonstrate that those individuals who im-\nmigrated earlier in life are more similar to the native\nborn than they are to later-life migrants.\nIn Table 5 we present logistic regression models pre-\ndicting the three major income sources among the\nelderly for single and married individuals. These mod-\nels control for several factors that influence the prob-\nability of receiving income from each source, includ-\ning current age, gender, education, age at migration,\nproblems with instrumental activities of daily living,\none's living arrangements, one's own and one's spouse's\nemployment status, and the number of children one\nhas. The reference categories for categorical variables\nare listed in parentheses under the variable label. These\nmodels also control for language of interview. Nearly\n77% of unmarried and 80% of married individuals re-\nsponded to the survey in Spanish. A control for proxy\nresponse was not significant so it was dropped from\nthe models.\nOur focus in this table is on the net impact of one's\nage when one immigrated on the probability of re-\nceiving income from the three main sources available\nto elders. These models reveal clear net disadvant-\nages among later-life migrants in the receipt of income\nfrom the most common formal sources. Among single\nindividuals, those who immigrated at age 50 or older\nare significantly less likely to receive SSI, Social Secu-\nrity, or private pensions. The odds ratios associated\nwith these coefficients reveal that those who came\nlater in life are only 46% as likely as the native born\nto receive SSI (e-77), 25% as likely to receive Social\nSecurity (e~1-40), and 14% as likely to receive income\nfrom a private pension (e~1\").\nAmong married individuals, those who immigrated\nat age 50 or older are less likely to receive Social Se-\ncurity (21% as likely as the native born). When Span-\nish interview is not included, married indviduals are\nalso far less likely to receive income from a private\npension. When Spanish interview is included, the co-\nefficient for private pension becomes insignificant. For\nboth single and married individuals, though, the use\nof Spanish is associated with a greatly reduced likeli-\nhood of having a private pension. Because those who\nimmigrated at later ages are most likely to have taken\nthe interview in Spanish (73% for single individuals\nand over 97% for married individuals) and to be less\nfluent in English, this variable further underscores the\nprivate pension disadvantage of later-life migrants.\nDiscussion\nThese data provide some intriguing evidence that\nlater-life immigrants are particularly dependent on their\nfamilies. Because they arrive with few resources, and\nhave few opportunities and little time to save for re-\ntirement, that dependency may in many cases be perma-\nnent. Given the recent tightening of eligibility criteria\nfor SSI and other social programs, this dependency\nhas important implications for families' decisions as to\nwhether to bring an older relative to the United States.\nFor such families the desire to bring their parents or\nother relatives to be with them is a natural outgrowth\nof love and a sense of obligation. For social policy,\nTable 5.

The Personal Responsibility and Work\nOpportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA)\nexcluded even legal immigrants from receiving SSI or\nfood stamps unless they fall into certain exemption\ncategories (Dunkelberg, 1997). The Balanced Budget\nAct of 1997 relaxed some of these restrictions and\nallowed those legal immigrants who were receiving SSI\nimmigrants prior to that date and who subsequently\nbecome disabled, to continue receiving or to qualify\nfor benefits. These individuals, however, cannot re-\nceive SSI based solely on economic need and old age\nas can native-born U.S. citizens.\ntreated very differently, though, and are excluded\nfrom participation in all federal means-tested benefit\nprograms for a period of five years (Dunkelberg, 1997).\nIn this new immigration environment those who\nsponsor an older immigrant assume a large and po-\ntentially burdensome responsibility. For at least five years\nfamily members who wish to bring their aging parents\nto live closer to them must provide housing and all of\nthe older person's other needs, even in the case of\nserious disability.\nDuring periods of low unemployment and relative\neconomic prosperity, many families with dependent\nelderly members find it possible to bear the burden\nof a dependent older parent. However, as times be-\ncome more difficult such families may be placed un-\nder greater strain because they must provide for both\nchildren and for the dependent elders. Among groups\nthat are struggling to survive and to move into the\neconomic mainstream, such a burden may prove\nexcessive and hinder the social mobility of all con-\ncerned.\nOur immigration policy has been based on a de-\nsire to help reunify families. It reflects a belief that\nimmigrants have the same rights as those who came\nearlier to bring parents, as well as children, to this\nnation. Such policies clearly reflect basic values and\nimply a certain commitment of material resources to\nmake that outcome possible. Current antiwelfare and\nanti-immigrant public sentiments, however, make the\nobjective of family reunification more difficult. Fami-\nlies that choose to bring aging parents to this country,\nand especially those families wno are themselves new\narrivals and who bring aging parents with them, as-\nsume a rather large responsibility with no assurance\nagainst serious economic reversals. If the older indi-\nvidual becomes seriously disabled the potential drain\non family resources could be devastating. We have\nyet to see if private charity will prove adequate in\nassisting these families.\nOur current welfare policy concerning immigrants\nis based on a philosophy that we have not seen for\nseveral decades and one that has serious implications\nfor the welfare of the elderly population, as does the\ndismantling of traditional welfare for children. This harsher\npublic policy philosophy in which many vulnerable in-\ndividuals are denied welfare is new and its full impli-\ncations will be known only after several years of ex-\nperience. Although there is no way of knowing for\nsure at this point, our previous experiences with eco-\nnomic dependency suggests that the need that one\nlevel of government ceases to provide for must be pro-\nvided for by another. It is doubtful that, at this point\nin our history, we as a nation are willing to accept the\nserious deprivation that the lack of an adequate sys-\ntem of social welfare brought in previous eras. If we\nare still committed to family values and to the reunifi-\ncation of older parents with their children, some new\nmeans of ensuring their welfare without overburden-\ning vulnerable families will have to be found.\nReferences\nAlba, R.
