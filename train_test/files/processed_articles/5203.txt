HCC serum tumour markers\ninclude a-fetoprotein (AFP), AFP-L3, des-g-\ncarboxyprothrombin (DCP) and golgi pro-\nwidely used marker.3,4\nEnzyme-linked immunosorbent assay\n(ELISA) is successfully used in the detection\nof AFP,5,6 but requires costly commercial\nkits. An alternative methodology is protein\nmicroarray with horseradish peroxidase\n(HRP)-linked chemiluminescence. The HRP\nchemiluminescent reaction is based on the\ncatalyzed oxidation of luminol by peroxide,\nproducing light.7 HRP is currently used in\nnumerous diverse industrial and medical\napplications, such as waste-water treatment,8\nchemical synthesis, coupled enzyme assays,\nbiosensors, diagnostic kits and\nThis study reports the development and\napplication of protein microarrays with\nHRP chemiluminescence to detect AFP in\nserum from patients with HCC and healthy\ncontrol subjects.\nParticipants and methods\nStudy population\nThe study recruited patients with HCC who\nunderwent liver resection surgery at the\nDepartment of Hepatobiliary Surgery,\nBeijing You'an Hospital, Beijing, China\nPatients were required to be positive for\nserum hepatitis B surface antigen and free\nfrom chronic hepatitis C infection. HCC\ndiagnosis was histologically confirmed after\nsurgical resection. Healthy control subjects\nwere recruited from volunteers with no\nreported gastrointestinal or hepatobiliary\ndisease who were undergoing routine health\nscreening at the outpatient department of\nBeijing You'an Hospital, Beijing, China.\nThe study protocol was approved by the\nethics committee of Beijing You'an Hospital.\nWritten informed consent was obtained from\nall participants prior to enrolment in the\nstudy.\nBlood collection\nWhole blood (1 ml) was collected from each\nsubject. Blood was allowed to clot, centri-\nresulting serum was stored at \u00c070C. Prior\nfor a maximum of 7 days.\nMicroarray preparation\nReaction wells were created by attaching\nslips of hydrophobic paper (10 holes\nper slip) to aldehyde-coated glass slides.\nThe prey antibody (2 mg/ml mouse antihu-\nman AFP monoclonal antibody with 30%\nglycerol to prevent evaporation; Fapon\nBiotech Company Inc., Shenzhen, China)\nwas spotted onto aldehyde-coated slides in\nquadruplicate using a microarray spotter\n(Cartesian Technologies, Irvine, CA, USA;\nspot-to-spot distance 1000 mm). Each well\ncontained four anti-AFP antibody and\nfour negative control (5% bovine serum\nalbumen [BSA]) spots. Following spotting,\nthe slides were incubated for 24 h at 4C to\nfully immobilize proteins. Slides were then\nnormal goat serum with 0.1% sodium azide)\nfor 2 h at 37C, washed four times\nroom temperature (5 s each wash), air\ndried at room temperature and stored at\n4C until use.\nAFP quantification\nRabbit antimouse polyclonal antibody\n(Abcam; Cambridge, UK) was labelled\nwith biotin using a biotin (type A) conjuga-\ntion kit (Abcam), according to the manu-\nfacturer's instructions. Serum samples were\nadded to the microarray reaction wells,\nhybridized for 30 min at 37C, then washed\n7.5) at room temperature (5 s each wash).\nThe biotin-labelled rabbit antimouse poly-\nclonal antibody (1 : 50 dilution) was added\nto the wells and hybridized for 30 min at\nture (5 s each wash), then incubated with\nHRP-labelled streptavidin (1 : 50 dilution)\nfor 30 min at 37C. Slides were washed four\nroom temperature (5 s each wash), then\nincubated with chemiluminescent HRP sub-\nstrate (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) for\n5 s. Slides were scanned using a chemilumin-\nescence imaging scanner (Academy of\nMilitary Medical Sciences, Beijing, China).\nLevels of AFP in study samples were\nquantified by reference to a standard curve,\nestablished using serial AFP dilutions\ncontrol (Figure 1). Reliability and stability\nof the assay were verified by repeat quanti-\nfication (10 assays) of the AFP standard\ncurve to calculate within-run and between-\nrun variation (Table 1). The cut-off value for\noptimal diagnostic performance for serum\nAFP quantification has been shown to\nused a cut-off value of 20 ng/ml.\nELISA\nSerum AFP was quantified using ELISA\n(AFP Human ELISA kit; Abcam), accord-\ning to the manufacturer's instructions.\nStatistical analyses\nData were presented as mean\u00c6 SD (coeffi-\ncient of variation) or median (95% confidence\ninterval [CI]). Between-group comparisons of\nAFP concentrations were made using Mann\u00ad\nWhitney U-test for both protein microarray\nand ELISA. Wilcoxon's rank sum test was\nused to compare between-test differences in\nAFP concentration. Spearman's correlation\ncoefficient was used to determine the associ-\nations between serum AFP concentrations as\ndetermined by protein microarray or ELISA.\nReceiver operating characteristic (ROC) ana-\nlysis was performed to determine the diag-\nnostic performance of protein microarray\nand ELISA. Statistical analyses were con-\nducted using SPSS\u00d5 version 17.0 (SPSS Inc.,\nChicago, IL, USA) for Windows\u00d5. All tests\nwere two-tailed, and P-values <0.05 were\nconsidered statistically significant.\nResults\nThe study included blood samples from 60\nyears) and 30 healthy control subjects\nyears; age range 46\u00ad64 years). There were\nno significant between-group differences in\nage or sex distribution.\nData regarding serum AFP concentra-\ntions detected via ELISA and protein micro-\narray are shown in Figure 2.

The sensitivity of diagnosis\nvia protein microarray was similar to that of\nELISA (the gold standard for AFP detec-\ntion) in the present study. Protein micro-\narray has several advantages over ELISA,\nincluding rapidity, simplicity, and low cost.\nThe protein microarray was performed in\n$1.5\u00ad2 h in the present study (excluding the\ntime taken to manufacture the microarray),\nwhereas the ELISA kit used in this experi-\nment required >3.5h. Protein microarray\nassays are relatively simple to perform and\ndo not require highly skilled technicians.\nIn addition, the small size of the microarray\nreduces the quantity of antibodies, antigens\nand other materials required compared with\nELISA. The amounts of serum required for\nthe protein microarray are greatly reduced:\nonly 10 ml of original or diluted serum is\nneeded, whereas 50 ml of serum is needed for\nELISA. The quantities of antibodies for the\nprotein chip are also greatly reduced: only\n0.25ml of mouse antihuman AFP monoclo-\nnal antibody is needed for spotting on each\nprotein microarray, and 10ml of diluted\nbiotin-labelled rabbit antihuman AFP\npolyclonal antibody is needed for detection.\nConversely,50ml of mouse antihuman AFP\nFigure 4. Receiver operating characteristic curve of serum a-fetoprotein (AFP) quantification using protein\nmicroarray or ELISA for diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and\nhealthy control subjects (n \u00bc 90).\nmonoclonal antibody and 50ml of diluted\nbiotin-labelled rabbit antihuman AFP poly-\nclonal antibody are needed for ELISA.\nThere is room for improvement in protein\nmicroarray technology. Detection with\nfluorescent labelled antibodies provides a\ngreat dynamic range for quantification and\nsignal amplification.20 Moreover, further\nimproving the uniformity of spots and\nreducing background noise would allow\neven more precise protein quantification.\nSerum AFP has limited use as a single\nbiomarker for the early detection of HCC, as\nit may not be sufficient to distinguish HCC\nfrom chronic hepatitis and liver cirrhosis.21\nProtein microarrays designed to detect mul-\ntiple tumour markers would greatly increase\nthe utility of this technology for HCC\ndiagnosis.\nIn conclusion, protein microarray is a\npotential alternative to ELISA for detecting\nAFP in serum samples, in patients with\nHCC. It is low cost, easy to perform, and\nsuitable for clinical diagnosis and public\nhealth use.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis work was supported by Ministry of Science\nand Technology of the People's Republic of China\npartially supported by Beijing Municipal Science &\nTechnology Commission (grant no.\nof Capital Medical University Foundation (grant\nReferences\n1.
