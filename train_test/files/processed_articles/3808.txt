Relations between cognitive dysfunction and problematic\nbehaviours in dementia are frequently conceptualised within a needs-driven dementia-\ncompromised behaviour model (Algase et al., 1996). According to this theory, needs-\ndriven dementia-compromised behaviours (e.g. aggressive actions) constitute expressions\nof unmet needs, triggered by proximal factors (e.g. noisy environments) in people with\npredisposing background factors (e.g. disinhibition). Indeed, older adults in residential\ncare with cognitive impairments experience increased levels of agitation (Cohen-Mansfield,\nCorresponding author:\nJohn M Hudson, School of Psychology, College of Social Science, Brayford Pool, Lincoln LN6 7TS, UK.\nEmail: jhudson@lincoln.ac.uk\nDementia\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav\ndem.sagepub.com\nMarx, & Rosenthal, 1990) and display more negative dementia-related behaviours (Boustani\net al., 2005). Although the concept of challenging behaviour in dementia has been questioned\n(Swaffer, 2015), cognitive impairment also increases the likelihood of falling (Whitney,\nClose, Jackson, & Lord, 2012) and modifies how individuals with dementia express their\nneeds and interact with others (Morris & McKiernan, 1994). Recognising inter-individual\nvariation in the cognitive abilities of care home residents is therefore fundamental for the\ndelivery of high quality person-centred care yet poses a significant challenge for care workers\nwho face many emotional and physical pressures (Gandoy-Crego, Clemente, Maya\n\u00b4 n-Santos,\nIn this paper, we introduce the Cognitive Daisy (COG-D) \u00ad an innovative method for\nproviding care staff with a succinct visual depiction of an individual's cognitive status. The\nCOG-D (see Figure 1) comprises a flower head consisting of 15 petals, each of which is\ncolour coded and corresponds to performance on a specific cognitive task (e.g. face\nrecognition, sustained attention, speech production, comprehension, etc.). A copy of each\nresident's COG-D is placed in a discrete area of their room, in their care plan portfolio and is\ndisplayed in the office of the care home manager. The primary aim of the COG-D is to\nremind care staff at a glance of the severity of problems within different cognitive domains.\nThese can then be used to adjust interaction with the resident, thereby improving\ncommunication, reducing agitation and enhancing person-centred care. Here we evaluate\nthe practicality of the COG-D assessment protocol and examine whether the COG-D helps\ncare staff to become more aware of the cognitive strengths and weaknesses of the residents\nthey care for. To explore these questions, COG-D was introduced to residents and care staff\nin six residential care homes for older people and its usefulness was evaluated through\nquestionnaires completed by care staff before and after the training and intervention phase.\nMethod\nParticipants: Twenty-nine senior care staff, all of whom were women, and six men and 27\nwomen (mean age \u00bc 87.23 years, range \u00bc 74\u00ad96 years) from six residential care homes in\nLincolnshire, UK participated in this study. In addition, we collected comparison data from\nthe community. All participants gave informed consent prior to participating in the study.\nThe investigation was approved by the ethics committee of the School of Psychology,\nUniversity of Lincoln.\nStages of the care home study: The study comprised five stages.\n(1) COG-D (neuropsychological) assessment of residents, interpretation of data and\nconstruction of individual COG-Ds.\n(2) Assessment of baseline knowledge of care staff with COG-D (I) questionnaire.\n(3) The COG-D training session.\n(4) Application of the COG-D: A two-week period where care staff used the COG-D on a\ndaily basis.\n(5) Assessment of knowledge of cognitive problems and evaluation of the usefulness of the\nCOG-D for care staff with COG-D (II) questionnaire.\nCOG-D assessment: All older adults completed a 15-item test battery in the order\npresented in Table 1. Variants of most of the tests used are widely deployed for assessing\nthe cognitive status of older adults (e.g. Mioshi, Dawson, Mitchell, Arnold, & Hodges, 2006;\nNasreddine et al., 2005). Our assessment examines five cognitive domains; visuospatial (tests\nmemory (tests 2, 5 and 6) and attention (tests 3, 12 and 14). The maximum score on each test\nis 8, a score of 5 or less is indicative of impairment. A research assistant administered\nthe tests to those participants who lived in the community; an Admiral Nurse\nadministered the tests to those in residential care. Each COG-D assessment took around\n15 minutes to complete. Participants living in the community also completed the 6-item\ncognitive impairment task (6CIT; Brooke & Bullock, 1999).\nCognitive Daisies: The data from the assessment was used to create a COG-D for each\nresident. Each COG-D consisted of 15 petals (see Figure 1) representing five cognitive\ndomains which were colour coded as follows: visuospatial perception (blue),\ncomprehension (yellow), communication (purple), verbal memory (green) and attention\n(red). Each domain of cognition was represented by three petals. The level of impairment\nwithin a domain was indicated by the number of coloured petals, cognitive strengths were\ndepicted by white petals. If a test was not performed, the corresponding petal was coloured\ngrey. The position of each petal within a cognitive domain corresponded to a specific\nfunction (e.g. blue petals depicted visuospatial perception: position 1 \u00bc spatial awareness;\nposition 2 \u00bc face recognition; position 3 \u00bc object recognition). Each resident's COG-D\n(85 mm \u00c2 85 mm approx.) was displayed in a discrete but visible place in their room.\nA more detailed version of the resident's daisy, which included a description in non-\ntechnical terms (e.g. spatial awareness \u00bc `seeing both sides of the environment') of each\nFigure 1.

The main objective of these sessions was to explain the concept of the\nCOG-D and to ensure an understanding of how the different cognitive domains were\nrepresented by different coloured petals. Given the variation of pre-existing knowledge\nabout cognitive dysfunction in dementia, we described the COG-D components to care\nstaff using accessible language, such as seeing (visuospatial), understanding\n(comprehension), communication, remembering (verbal memory) and attention. The\nacronym `S-U-C-R-A' was used to facilitate learning of each term. Once all care staff\nwere proficient at recalling the cognitive domain corresponding to each letter, we used an\nimagery exercise designed to strengthen the association between each area of cognition with\nthe correct colour (e.g. imagining a large blue eye was used to associate seeing with the\ncolour blue; imagining vivid purple lips was used to associate communication with the colour\npurple, etc.). In the first phase of training, care staff were instructed that the level of\nimpairment within each cognitive area was denoted by the number of coloured petals\n(0 \u00bc none; 1 \u00bc mild; 2 \u00bc moderate; 3 \u00bc severe). To ensure an understanding of the main\nfeatures of the COG-D, care staff were required to complete a number of exercises. First,\nthey were presented with a cognitive profile of a dementia case study and asked to produce a\nCOG-D that reflected that person's cognitive strengths and weaknesses. Second, they were\nrequired to interpret the COG-Ds of those residents in the care home who were participating\nin the study. In the second phase of the training session, care staff learned about the different\ntests deployed in the COG-D assessment battery and importantly how each petal within a\ncognitive domain represented the status of a specific function.\nCOG-D Questionnaires: Care staff completed pre and post-intervention questionnaires\nreferred to as COG-D (I) and COG-D (II), respectively. Both measures incorporated\nopen-ended questions that required care staff to list cognitive problems associated with\ndementia and to state how they impact on daily life. In addition, care staff indicated on a\n10-point Likert scale: (1) the importance of understanding cognitive problems for delivering\nperson-centred care; (2) how difficult they found it to remember residents' specific cognitive\nproblems; (3) whether they thought a visual prompt would be useful as a reminder of\nindividual cognitive difficulties. In addition to these four items, COG-D (II) also required\ncare staff to indicate whether they agreed with the statements: (1) it is important for residents\nto have a cognitive assessment; (2) the delivery of care should take into account the unique\ncognitive problems of residents; (3) the COG-D will help care staff recognise cognitive\nstrengths and limitations; (4) the COG-D will facilitate the delivery of care in residential\nhomes.\nResults\nData from six community participants who scored at or above the cut-off (8) for\ncognitive dysfunction on the 6CIT and one participant with an uncorrected visual\nimpairment were excluded from further analyses. The remaining participants (19 men/24\nCOG-D Assessment: Following initial observations we modified the measures of object\nrecognition, concept formation and visual search:\nHudson and Pollux 5\nObject naming: Residents were presented with line drawings of eight everyday objects on a\ncomputer screen and asked to name each one. Most residents were unable to name some of\nthe objects but could name others. We therefore decided to (1) change the format and\npresent each object singly; (2) use colour photographs of objects instead of drawings; (3)\nreplace objects that might be perceived ambiguously and present all objects from a\nstereotypical viewpoint.\nConcept formation: This measure involved pointing to two objects from the object naming\ntest that could be used to perform a specified task. Because of the problems outlined above,\nwe replaced this task with a standard similarities test.\nVisual search: Originally this measure involved performing a coloured trails task. None of\nthe residents managed to complete this test and no common errors were observed. We\nconsequently substituted this test with a visual search task which requires residents to find\nseveral target stimuli that are dispersed among many distractors.\nAll the older adults living in the community and all the care home residents bar one\ncompleted the modified COG-D assessment battery. The mean scores for both groups on\neach test are presented in Table 1. Cronbach's alpha revealed the battery had a high level of\ninternal consistency (15 items; a \u00bc .935). Cronbach's alpha scores for each cognitive domain\nverbal memory .817 and attention .838. Significant Spearman's correlations were found\nbetween 6CIT months backwards and the COG-D Stroop measure of inhibitory control\nindicated concordance between 6CIT indices of working memory and consolidation and\nthose derived from the COG-D test battery.\nCOG-D Questionnaires: The cognitive problems in dementia that were named in COG-D (I)\nby care staff were mainly behavioural (e.g. incontinence, aggression) or psychological (anxiety,\ndepression). The percentage of care staff who stated impairments pre- vs. post-intervention\nwhich corresponded with the primary cognitive functions as depicted by the COG-D were as\ndetermined that the COG-D intervention significantly raised awareness in care staff of\ndementia, but not of communication (p \u00bc .109) or memory (p \u00bc .289) impairments.\nOn a scale of 1 to 10 where 10 means that the statement is strongly endorsed, all care staff\nthought it was extremely important to understand the cognitive problems of residents for\ndelivering person-centred care in both pre (mean \u00bc 9.93, SD \u00bc 0.26) and post-intervention\nresponses (mean \u00bc 9.74, SD \u00bc 0.53). There was no significant difference in their pre- and\npost-intervention responses [t (26) \u00bc 1.727, p \u00bc .096], indicating that participation in the\nstudy had not altered their perception of this principle. On COG-D (I), many care staff\nindicated that it was quite difficult to remember residents' specific cognitive problems\nSD \u00bc 1.77). As can be seen in Figure 2, post-intervention responses clearly showed that the\nimplementation of COG-D had made it significantly easier for them to remember the\nextremely useful (mean \u00bc 8.89, SD \u00bc 1.45). The value of COG-D was unrelated to whether\ncare staff thought a visual prompt of cognitive problems would be useful in the pre-training\nphase [r \u00bc .345, p \u00bc .078]. Care staff further stated that it was important for residents to have\na cognitive assessment (mean \u00bc 9.76, SD \u00bc 0.58) and that the delivery of care should take\ncognitive problems into account (mean \u00bc 9.93, SD \u00bc 0.26). Notably, they believed that the\nCOG-D would help staff recognise cognitive strengths and weaknesses (mean \u00bc 9.82,\nExamples of qualitative responses\nThe whole aspect of the Daisy is very useful in order to help the staff recognise cognition strengths\nand limits in order to deliver a good standard of care.\nAfter reading the results of COG-D I was able to better support individuals in areas where I knew\nthere was a deficit but equally important I was able to encourage individuals to be independent with\nareas where no/little deficit was present.\nBy using the Daisy I was able to pick up on sensory impairments and amend care notes to inform\nstaff. By having the information as a team we were able to approach B.R in an appropriate manner.\nReducing stress and improving communication skills. Also improved communication between health\nprofessionals supporting B.R. By using the Daisy it gave me a better awareness of individuals'\nabilities and needs \u00ad improving person centred care.\nThe way it has been explained and put into different categories i.e. the cognitive problems each\nindividual can have I feel is extremely useful and interesting to care staff. It is simple and easy to\nunderstand.\nThe daisy would work very well to provide person centred care for all persons that are involved with\nthat resident from care staff to friends and family or even new staff can read the daisy and know the\nresident situation.\nEase of remembering rating\nPrior COG-D With COG-D\nFigure 2.

All the team would benefit\nif training was developed so they could grasp the cognitive daisy.\nDiscussion\nBeing aware of the cognitive problems of care home residents is a major challenge for care\nworkers yet pivotal to enhancing the delivery of person-centred care, reducing agitation and\nidentifying effective forms of communication. All care staff who participated in this study\nrated the importance of understanding cognitive problems for the delivery of person-centred\ncare very highly but admitted to finding these difficult to remember. They also endorsed the\nuse of the COG-D as a visual representation of the cognitive status of each resident and\nbelieved that by making cognitive strengths and weaknesses apparent the COG-D could\nimprove the quality of person-centred care.\nThe cognitive profiles of residents in this study were diverse. In fact, 88% of the COG-Ds\ncreated were unique within the cohort. Although all residents had profound deficits recalling\nrecent information, on each of the other tests between 28% and 94% of residents were\nunimpaired. The degree of individual variation in cognitive ability is further highlighted\nby the distribution of white petals \u00ad which indicate no impairment. On each COG-D, the\nnumber of white petals ranged from 1 to 12. In this study, only four residents failed to\ncomplete a test, which suggests that the overall demand characteristics of the COG-D test\nbattery are appropriate.\nRecognising that a resident has a specific cognitive problem can prompt care staff to\nadopt a number of modifying strategies. For example, if a resident has difficulty with\nspeech production, care staff can modify their own interaction by giving the resident more\ntime to respond and keeping choices simple (Orange & Colton-Hudson, 1998). Alternatively,\nthe residents' behaviour might be modified by encouraging different means of\ncommunication (Hoffman, Platt, & Barry, 1988). For instance, 24 (73%) residents in this\nstudy have speech fluency difficulties (test 7), however, 11 of these are competent writers\n(test 8) and all know how to communicate through gesture (test 13). COG-D not only\nprovides information on specific abilities but can also reveal details on the nature of\nimpairment when the status of complimentary petals is considered. For example, 8 out of\n10 residents who demonstrated deficits locating objects in the visual search task (test 12)\ncould recognise individual objects perfectly well (test 10). The difficulty that these residents\nmight experience is therefore not in object recognition per se (e.g. identifying a spoon) but is\nparticular to situations in which many other objects are present (e.g. finding a spoon on a\ntable with an array of crockery and cutlery). Therefore consideration of background factors\n(via the COG-D) in relation to situational factors can empower care staff with the potential\nto predict and therefore avert the risk of needs-driven dementia-compromised behaviour\n(Kolanowski, Litaker, & Buettner, 2005).\nIn addition to informing the decision making of individual care staff, COG-D can also\nbenefit care home teams and managers involved in the shaping of care plans, organising\nactivities and allocating resources. Incorporating the COG-D into care plans has a number\nof advantages. First, the COG-D is derived from objective measures of cognitive abilities\nthat are covert and therefore not obvious to care staff. Second, the COG-D is readily\ninterpretable without the need to read lengthy text or understand complex terminology.\nThird, new staff can readily derive an overview of the residents they will care for. Fourth,\nviewing COG-Ds constructed at different stages will present health professionals and\nrelatives with a visual system for monitoring progression over time. It will enhance\nawareness in relatives about the relationship between cognitive decline and behaviour of\nresidents and could serve as a basis to amend care needs appropriately.\nThe viewing of all COG-Ds from a care home in one place (e.g. on a wall or PC screen)\nwill provide home managers with an overview of common cognitive strengths and\nweaknesses. This level of detail could be useful for identifying rehabilitative interventions\nthat might be beneficial to numbers of residents and delivered on a group basis (e.g. speech\ntherapy). Similarly, the identification of common strengths among residents will facilitate the\nformation of groups of residents that could benefit from participating in the same\nrecreational activities.\nIt may also be viable for managers to create a `home' COG-D that portrays the\npercentage of residents who are impaired in each cognitive function. This information\nwould be valuable to care home providers with an interest in comparing the severity of\ncognitive impairment across homes within their organisation in order to guide decisions\non resources and highlighting staff training needs.\nIt is noteworthy that training of the concept and deployment of COG-D markedly\nimproved the knowledge of care staff of cognitive dysfunction in dementia. When asked\nto name specific cognitive problems associated with dementia in the pre-training phase, care\nstaff stated more behavioural (e.g. wandering, agitation, undressing, aggression, etc.) and\npsychological problems (e.g. frustration, anxiety, depression, etc.) than cognitive deficits.\nFollowing the intervention, a significantly greater number of cognitive problems were\nnamed. Implementation of the COG-D appears therefore to have influenced care staff to\ngive greater consideration to background cognitive factors (e.g. inhibitory control) which\nhave the potential to lead to needs-driven dementia-compromised behaviours given the\npresence of proximal triggers.\nThis pilot investigation has provided unequivocal support for both the practicality and\nusefulness of the COG-D in residential care homes. The application of the COG-D is not\nexclusive to dementia. The cognitive profile of any neurological (e.g. brain injury, stroke,\nParkinson's disease, motor neurone disease, etc.) or developmental disorder (e.g. autistic\nspectrum disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, learning difficulties, etc.) might\nbe usefully depicted by the COG-D following assessment with an appropriate test battery.\nNotwithstanding these strengths, we acknowledge that the COG-D is still at an early stage of\ndevelopment. Despite Cronbach's alpha coefficient for the total COG-D test battery\nindicating a high degree of internal consistency, additional psychometric properties\nincluding the construct validity and test-retest reliability for the assessment battery await\ninvestigation. Furthermore, only a small proportion of residents and care staff at each home\nparticipated in this phase of the study and the pilot ran for only two weeks. To examine the\ngenerality of the findings reported here and to test the feasibility of the COG-D larger scale\nstudies are needed.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or\npublication of this article.\nHudson and Pollux 9\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nReferences\nAlexander-Bloch, A., Giedd, J.
