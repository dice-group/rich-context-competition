Our hypothesis is based on the proposition that\nthroughout human evolution, behaviors that promoted gene transmission (offspring\nproduction), and hence fitness, have involved not just those associated with a strong \"sex\ndrive,\" but also those associated with a strong \"legacy drive\" \u00ad the desire to \"leave\nsomething of oneself\" for the future. Because of this intrinsic legacy drive, we argue,\nhumans (and males, in particular) have been inherently vulnerable for \"side-tracking\" into\nother activities that promote \"meme transmission\" -- i.e., activities perceived as providing\na lasting legacy of \"self\" through investment in career development, accumulation of\nwealth and status, and several other activities that have potential to impact on the thoughts\nand actions of others in both current and future generations.

For countries in the top 10% of national wealth, fertility is now so low, it\nhas dipped below replacement level in virtually every case. The resulting \"population\nimplosion\" is one of the most pressing societal problems now facing these countries\nTransmission Competition Hypothesis\nthe same time, the opposite problem \u00ad inordinately high fertility and overpopulation \u00ad\ncontinues to plague the poorest countries. What are the causes of this striking pattern of\nhuman demography? A range of hypotheses based on socio-economic, socio-cultural, and\nevolutionary factors have been proposed (see Kohler, Behrman, and Skytthe, 2002;\ndiscuss some relatively simple explanations based on straightforward consequences of\nDarwinian evolution \u00ad explanations that appear to have been largely overlooked in the\nliterature on this topic.\nThe relationship in Figure 1 exists, we suggest, because of two distinctly different\nevolutionary processes that drive human fertility toward opposite extremes. Inordinately\nhigh fertility is easily explained by the strong \"fertility-selection\" that operates in virtually\nall species where mortality rate is high, including when populations are severely crowded\nand hence, the resource needs of offspring are strongly contested. In this instance, fitness is\nmaximized primarily by maximizing fertility. [Note that in referring to the number of\noffspring produced, we use the term fertility here, as is conventional in human studies,\nwhereas \"fecundity\" is the term normally used in studies of wild species]. As in wild\nspecies, this \"fertility-selection\" is likely to have operated intensely throughout most of the\nevolutionary history of humans (Aarssen, 2005). Hence, we should expect to see the\nhighest fertility in societies where competition for the resource needs of offspring is most\nintense, and infant mortality rate is high, which is indeed the case \u00ad in the most\nimpoverished countries (Fig. 1). Typically, there are severe constraints here on individual\noffspring endowment, imposed by severe poverty and instability of personal wealth \u00ad often\na consequence of recurring effects of political corruption, war, and anarchy. These\ncircumstances describe the human condition at various times in one place or another around\nthe globe throughout human history. As products of evolution under these circumstances,\nbehaviors that promote high fertility, especially in males, are conspicuous in these\nimpoverished societies. This includes, particularly, polygyny and the subjugation of\nfemales, whose mating and fertility are largely controlled by dominant males with a\npreference for high coital rates, and a preference for producing many offspring that include\nespecially sons, who in turn repeat these high fertility-promoting male behaviors in the next\ngeneration (Aarssen, 2005; Low, 2005). Because it is physiologically possible for males to\nfather many more children than what any female can bear in her lifetime, it seems likely\nthat throughout much of human evolution, our predecessors left more descendants when a\nlarger proportion of them were male at reproductive maturity. Accordingly, it is not\nsurprising perhaps, as a product of natural selection, that behaviors promoting multiple\nsexual partners (especially in males), and preference for male offspring have been common\nInordinately low (below-replacement) fertility, however, is less obviously explained\nin evolutionary terms. Aarssen (2005) has proposed an explanation based on \"relaxed\nfertility-selection.\" In modern wealthy countries that have social services and where\npersonal wealth is relatively secure under the protection of law and political stability,\nmortality rate is lower, plus offspring have access to resources that are largely uncontested\nby the offspring of other parents \u00ad a societal structure that is analogous to the effects of\n\"niche differentiation\" in wild species. Unlike in wild species, however, the niche\ndifferentiation here is between families (rather than between species), thus virtually\neliminating the effect of offspring competition between families. Under these\nTransmission Competition Hypothesis\ncircumstances, fertility-selection within the population is relaxed, thus allowing behaviors\npromoting low fertility to increase in relative frequency by random genetic drift.\nAccording to this hypothesis, the main promoting factor here is the greater empowerment\nof women in wealthier countries, and particularly their control over their own fertility. One\nindicator of female empowerment is represented by the percentage of the female population\nthat is literate, which, across countries, is highly correlated with the GDP per capita data in\nFigure 1 (Spearman-rank correlation, rs\ncapita (wealth) and percentage of female literacy (empowerment) are combined in a\nmultiple regression analysis, 70% (r2 = 0.70) of the variation in lifetime fertility is\nexplained \u00ad compared with only 58% predicted by variation in GDP alone (Fig. 1) (data\nfrom The World Fact Book (CIA); www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook).\nFig. 1. The relationship between gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and average\nlifetime fertility (births per woman) in 2003 for 223 countries. The line and associated r2\nand p-values are from linear regression analysis. Note Log scales. Data are from The\nWorld Fact Book (CIA) available at www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook.\nAverage\nlifetime\nfertility\nper female\nThe education, financial independence and legal rights of equality for women in\nwealthy countries means that they can now choose, if they wish, to have only one child, or\nno children at all \u00ad and indeed, given the mean lifetime fertility of less than 1.5 offspring in\nmany of these countries (Fig. 1), a large percentage of the female population clearly\nexercises this choice. The resulting population implosion thus reduces the effective\npopulation size of breeders in each successive generation. This, combined with other large\nscale causes of population loss (e.g. from world wars, where mostly males are lost), and\ncombined also with the absence of strong \"fertility-selection,\" results in conditions\npromoting random genetic drift in affecting the distribution of fertility promoting behaviors\n(Aarssen, 2005). Moreover, with females now in control over their own fertility in wealthy\nTransmission Competition Hypothesis\ncountries, males with high-fertility-promoting behaviors here are unable to enjoy any\nfitness advantage. Owing to their greater intrinsic cost of parenthood \u00ad i.e., the time and\nenergy commitments associated with pregnancy, childbirth, and breastfeeding \u00ad females\nhave inherently lower fertility preferences (Blaffer Hrdy, 1999), compared with the high-\nfertility-promoting male behaviors favored historically by strong fertility selection. Hence,\nmales that happen to have low to moderate fertility-promoting behaviors may be more\nlikely to be chosen as husbands by empowered females, and so may actually enjoy a fitness\nadvantage (compared with males that have high-fertility-promoting behaviors), thus further\ncontributing to the spread of genes effecting low-fertility-promoting behaviors in wealthy\nIt is important to note, however, that an average lifetime fertility that is below\nreplacement results not so much because females attain low fertility, but more specifically\nbecause a sizable percentage of females within the population have no fertility at all. The\nincidence of childless women is growing rampantly in wealthy countries (Cain, 2001;\nCannold, 2005). Relaxed fertility-selection and random genetic drift cannot fully account\nfor this. Understanding the causes of below-replacement fertility, therefore, requires an\nunderstanding of why women are more likely to remain childless when they have greater\npower (which is generally promoted by greater wealth). Explanations for voluntary\nchildlessness (zero lifetime fertility) have been previously explored largely in terms of just\nproximate socio-cultural/economic factors (e.g. McAllister and Clarke, 1998; Park, 2005).\nHere, we propose a novel evolution-based hypothesis involving the effects of competition\nbetween gene transmission and meme transmission that is a product, we argue, of the recent\nempowerment of women.\nThe transmission competition hypothesis\nBelow-replacement fertility is common in wealthy societies because there is\nobviously something inherently appealing about a lifestyle that is often associated with\nchildlessness (or with at most only one child). The puzzling question is \u00ad why is this\nappeal so widespread given its obvious maladaptive consequences in evolutionary terms?\nThe explanation, we propose, is that behaviors promoting low fertility and childlessness\nare, ironically, indirect by-products of natural selection itself, but the large-scale effects\n(e.g. Fig. 1) have been realized only recently because of the recent large-scale elevation in\nthe empowerment of women in wealthy countries. Evolutionary fitness is measured in\nterms of gene transmission, where genetic descendants result as a product of investment in\nfertility and parental care. Natural selection here obviously favors genes that effect\nbehaviors promoting desire for sex and mating, but also, we argue, it favors genes that\npromote behaviors associated with a desire for immortality and/or a desire to \"leave\nsomething of oneself\" for the future. One way to live \"forever,\" or into the future, is\nthrough one's offspring/descendants. Accordingly, our predecessors that left the most\ndescendants were not only those with strong sex drives, but also those with a strong desire\nto \"leave something of oneself\" for the future.\nHere is the crucial point: when women have both empowerment and wealth, the\npractice of \"leaving something of oneself\" for the future need not involve investment in\nfertility and parental care. This evolved desire can be expressed instead through other\ndomains that may be associated with what Dawkins (1976) referred to as \"meme\"\nTransmission Competition Hypothesis\ntransmission, involving investment in activities that are perceived to provide some measure\nof personal legacy, i.e. \"memetic descendants.\" These may include activities such as the\npromotion of status for an individual or for a family name (e.g., through generation of\nincome, financial investment, or a reputation of integrity, or fame that might be expressed\nthrough a trophy, championship, commemorative plaque or memorial monument);\nphilanthropy and the assistance of others in need (e.g., through social work, the health-care\nprofession, volunteering, charitable aid, donation, contribution to endowments); the\npersuasion of others (e.g., through positions of power and leadership in business or\ngovernment, or through impact as an educator, or through fashions, trend-setting, child\nadoption, involvement in clubs, associations, politics, or through popularity with a wide\ncircle of friends); the generation, inspiration and promotion of ideas and new discoveries\n(e.g., through academic research, scholarship, literature, film, art, music, journalism, or\nattracting media attention); the creation and promotion of products or services (through\ninvention, technology, commerce); or the pursuit of \"everlasting life\" (through religion and\nthe recruitment of new believers to religion).\nOpportunities for most of these activities increase dramatically across countries\nwith increasing wealth, and most people in wealthy countries place a high priority on being\nengaged in one or more of these domains of meme transmission. This is accomplished by\ntime, energy, and resources devoted to personal education, career development,\naccumulation of wealth, community involvement, religious practices, etc. \u00ad all of which\ncompete with the time, energy, and resources required to bear and raise children, and so\ncompetes with gene transmission (Fig. 2). Meme transmission competes so effectively\nagainst gene transmission, we suggest, because the latter provides only a diluted legacy of\n\"self;\" i.e., because one's genes are diluted in each successive generation, genetic\ndescendants are attributed only partially to \"self.\" \"Memetic descendants,\" on the other\nhand, have greater potential to represent a largely undiluted (or at least less-diluted) legacy\nof \"self.\" As well, there is no reason to assume that motivation for meme transmission, or a\nlegacy drive, requires any perceived guarantee that one will actually be successful in\nleaving a legacy of some kind \u00ad any more than motivation for gene transmission, or a sex\ndrive, requires that one's children actually survive and successfully produce their own\nchildren. Activities promoting meme transmission have wide appeal perhaps because\nhumans are generally cognizant of their potential to exert an influence of \"self\" on the\nactions and thoughts of both current and future generations of the population (regardless of\nany genetic relationship with these generations), and/or, their potential, through religious\nfaith, to attain a \"place\" for themselves in eternity. More probably, we suggest, the\nmotivation is intrinsic; i.e. evolution by natural selection has produced in humans not just a\nstrong instinctive \"sex drive,\" but also a strong instinctive \"legacy drive\" because\nthroughout history, both drives have served in promoting the accumulation of genetic\ndescendants (Fig. 2).\nThe competitive power of meme transmission is illustrated particularly well, we\nsuggest, by the voluntary celibacy routinely associated with highly dedicated religious\nworshippers \u00ad e.g., priests and nuns of Catholic and Orthodox Christianity. Historically,\ncelibacy and prolonged virginity has also been associated with the ancient Greeks, pagan\nRome, native North Americans, several sects of eastern religions, cults (e.g., Shakers), and\nwith various socio-cultural practices of abstinence (resisting sex drive) in order to enhance\nopportunity for personal achievement of one form or another (Abbott, 2000). A more\nTransmission Competition Hypothesis\nsubtle example may be associated with a modern perception (in wealthy countries) that\nsuccess in meme transmission will be generally greater when a parent invests in fewer, and\nhence better-endowed (as opposed to many, poorly-endowed) offspring. This may stem\nfrom a perception that, by having fewer better-endowed offspring, there is a greater\nlikelihood of promoting personal legacy for the parent through greater accumulation of\ndescendants who \u00ad although not particularly numerous \u00ad will have wealth, fame, status,\netc., and thus greater potential to impact on the thoughts and actions of others in future\ngenerations. This personal legacy for the parent is particularly facilitated when\ndescendants bear the parent's family name \u00ad a widespread cultural tradition associated\nalmost exclusively with male parenthood. As discussed below, almost everything to do\nwith meme transmission has, until recently, been the exclusive domain of males.\nFig. 2. Illustration of the proposed competition between gene transmission and meme\ntransmission in humans. Behaviors promoting meme transmission are proposed as by-\nproducts of selection for behaviors promoting gene transmission; i.e. behaviors associated\nwith a desire to \"leave something of oneself\" for the future \u00ad i.e., \"legacy drive.\" See text.\nSelection for\nindividual survival\nFavoured by genes affecting\nbehaviours promoting desire for\nimmortality and desire to `leave\nsomething of oneself' for the\nfuture  `legacy drive'\nGenetic descendants\n(attributed only partially to `self' )\nMemetic `descendants'\n(Influences on actions and thoughts in current\nand future generations of the population, and/or,\nbelief in attainment of a `place' in eternity)\n(attributed directly to `self' )\nCONFLICT\n(competition for\ntime and resources)\nInvestment in\nfertility and\nparental care\nSelection for\noffspring production\nFavoured by genes\naffecting behaviours\npromoting desire\nfor sex and mating\n `sex drive'\nresults from\nGene transmission\n(diluted legacy of `self')\nMeme transmission\n(undiluted legacy of `self')\nInvestment in activities perceived as providing a\nlasting legacy of `self', achieved through investment\nin things other than biological offspring production;\ne.g. education, career development, accumulation\nof wealth, community involvement, child adoption,\nreligious practices, etc.\nSelection for\nindividual survival\nFavoured by genes affecting\nbehaviours promoting desire for\nimmortality and desire to `leave\nsomething of oneself' for the\nfuture  `legacy drive'\nGenetic descendants\n(attributed only partially to `self' )\nMemetic `descendants'\n(Influences on actions and thoughts in current\nand future generations of the population, and/or,\nbelief in attainment of a `place' in eternity)\n(attributed directly to `self' )\nCONFLICT\n(competition for\ntime and resources)\nInvestment in\nfertility and\nparental care\nSelection for\noffspring production\nFavoured by genes\naffecting behaviours\npromoting desire\nfor sex and mating\n `sex drive'\nresults from\nGene transmission\n(diluted legacy of `self')\nMeme transmission\n(undiluted legacy of `self')\nInvestment in activities perceived as providing a\nlasting legacy of `self', achieved through investment\nin things other than biological offspring production;\ne.g. education, career development, accumulation\nof wealth, community involvement, child adoption,\nreligious practices, etc.\nTransmission Competition Hypothesis\nDiscussion\nBehaviors that promote engagement in meme transmission, we argue, are inevitable\nby-products of natural selection for behaviors that also promote gene transmission \u00ad i.e. the\ndesire to \"leave something of oneself\" for the future. Historically, we suggest, humans\nhave been aware that \"leaving something of oneself\" for the future can be achieved by\nhaving children \u00ad which of course promotes evolutionary fitness, and thus accounts for why\nthis desire to \"leave something\" is now common in humans. Just as common, however, is\nan awareness in humans that \"leaving something of oneself\" for the future can also be\nachieved through other domains that have potential to leave a personal legacy, without\nhaving children \u00ad or at least without having very many children. Hence, as an indirect\nconsequence of selection for gene transmission, this intrinsic (evolved) legacy drive has left\nhumans inherently vulnerable for \"side-tracking\" into activities promoting meme\ntransmission (Fig. 2). When given the opportunity, therefore, it is not surprising that\nhumans are commonly preoccupied with the pursuit of curiosity-based learning, rewarding\ncareers, creative expression, political power, material wealth, prestige, and social status \u00ad\nall at the expense of childbearing and childrearing effort. This intrinsic legacy drive, we\nsuggest, also provides an evolutionary explanation for the paradox of foster parenting and\nespecially child adoption (Eisenberg, 2001), which contributes nothing to one's gene\ntransmission, but may provide, for many, an important opportunity to \"leave something of\noneself\" for the future. This kind of interplay between gene transmission and meme\ntransmission, mediated through effects of natural selection (Fig. 2), we suggest represents a\npotentially important conceptual framework for understanding cultural evolution (Ehrlich\nWe are particularly interested here in the socio-cultural issue that men and women\nhave had very different historical opportunities to accumulate \"memetic descendants.\" In\nmales, the pursuit of wealth and status has contributed not only to meme transmission, but\nhas served also to attract and acquire mates and so has had fairly obvious value for\nevolutionary fitness. Emperors, kings, and other men of power down through history\ntypically had many wives and hence, many offspring (Betzig, 2005). Historically, men\nhave also been able to invest freely and abundantly in all of the other domains of meme\ntransmission above, without incurring any penalty on evolutionary fitness, owing to their\nhistorical success in subjugating women.\nFor the same reason, the historical participation of women in meme transmission\nhas been negligible by comparison. According to the recent review by Murray (2003), of\n1950, only about 2% were women. Over this time period, and still today in severely\nimpoverished countries that lack female empowerment, the desire to \"leave something of\noneself\" for the future could/can be expressed in females primarily through just offspring\nproduction and religious practices. We suggest that this accounts, not only for the higher\nfemale fertility in more impoverished countries (Fig.1), but also for the greater importance\nplaced on religious practice there compared with wealthier western societies (Pew Global\nAttitudes Project, 2002). This may also help to account for the greater role of women\n(compared with men) in professions that, like childrearing, involve nurturing (such as\nnursing and teaching in primary school), and also the greater involvement of women\ngenerally in religious worship in most societies (Francis, 1997) (even though, ironically,\nTransmission Competition Hypothesis\nthe positions of power within most religions have always been, and still are, held largely by\nmen). Interestingly, there is also some evidence that people who are less sexually active\ntend to be more religious (Laumann, Gagnon, Michael and Michaels, 1994), and Bogaert\n(2004) reports that asexual individuals (defined as those having no sexual attraction for\neither sex), in particular, tend to be more religious than sexual individuals. This leads to\nthe interesting speculation that when desire for sex is minimal or lacking in some\nindividuals, an innate desire to leave something of oneself for the future \u00ad a legacy drive \u00ad\nmay, nevertheless, persist strongly, and may be manifested by a heightened religiosity, as a\ncompensation for the absence of sexuality.\nThere are two critical questions here: If activities that promote meme transmission\nplace constraints on gene transmission (Fig. 2), then why has natural selection not long ago\nforged behavioral domains in humans that minimize this effect? The most important\nreason, we suggest, is that the long history of male domination over females (Lerner, 1986),\nand especially their control over female fertility, has prevented any significant competition\nbetween meme transmission and gene transmission, both within families and within whole\npopulations. In other words, throughout much of human evolution, females have expended\nmost of the effort involved in gene transmission, whereas males have expended most of the\neffort involved in meme transmission. It is largely just males that have reaped the benefits\nof both, but the recent empowerment of women has now changed this. With independence\nand wealth combined, women in many contemporary societies are allowed now, along with\nmen, to engage freely in meme transmission. At the same time, this has now forced men to\ninvest more equally in efforts associated with gene transmission (e.g. parental care), thus\nresulting in widespread competition between gene transmission and meme transmission,\nlike never before, in both women and men.\nThe second question is even more fundamental: Why have humans, and males in\nparticular, been so historically vulnerable for \"side-tracking\" into activities that promote\nmeme transmission? There is of course the value of male status in attracting, and\ncompeting for mates, but equally important, we suggest, is that males (unlike females),\nthroughout most of human evolution, could never be completely certain about their own\npaternity, and hence, their own success in gene transmission. [Daly, Wilson and Weghorst\n(1982) invoke this argument as an explanation for male sexual jealousy]. Side-tracking\ninto activities promoting meme transmission thus compensated in helping to satisfy the\nevolved desire to \"leave something of oneself\" for the future. Much of this male activity\nthroughout human history involved the pursuit of power and dynasties through\nwarmongering, conquering and ruling over other people and other societies. This,\ncombined with behaviors promoting the subjugation of women \u00ad to help maximize the\nchances of male success also in gene transmission \u00ad was loathsome (by contemporary\nsocial standards), yet inevitable as an evolutionary consequence of this uniquely male\npredicament. An interesting example of this link between prolificacy and power in males is\nevident from a recent study of Y-chromosome phytogeography in Gaelic Ireland (Moore,\nLow (2000) argues that the fitness benefit of striving for status was historically less\nsignificant for women compared with men. This is because \u00ad unlike men \u00ad women that had\nthe highest wealth and status were unable, for physiological reasons, to have orders of\nmagnitude more children than women with the lowest wealth/status. We suggest, however,\nthat our female predecessors that had the highest fitness probably included those that\nTransmission Competition Hypothesis\ninherited high status-seeking behaviors (i.e., a strong legacy drive) from their fathers,\nbecause although these women were limited in how they could express it, they could\nnevertheless pass on this strong legacy drive to their sons. Hence, status-seeking behaviors\nmay have been historically less conspicuous in women not because (or not just because)\nwomen may generally have a weaker intrinsic legacy drive, but to a large extent simply\nbecause of the historical subjugation of women by men. Throughout most of human\nhistory, post-hunter/gatherers, most women lacked control over not just their own fertility,\nbut also their own participation in mating \u00ad a consequence of both traditional cultural\nimperatives (e.g. \"arranged\" marriages, usually by fathers), plus the limited historical\nopportunities for employment or ownership of property by women (Low, 2005). Even in\nsocieties where women could choose their own husbands, most \u00ad unless they chose\nprostitution, life in a convent, or poverty in a gruelling low-paying job \u00ad had no choice but\nto marry and bear children in order to secure basic provisions for themselves, and for their\nchildren.\nWith no power or financial independence, many of our female predecessors were\nprobably better off as the third or fourth wife of a wealthy, powerful husband than as the\nonly wife of a poor husband with no status. Ironically, therefore, those women with\nconsiderable success in leaving descendants probably included those who were actually\nattracted to powerful males with dominating personalities (Kokko, 2005; Sadalla, Kenrick,\nand Vershure, 1987). However, they probably also included those women who had strong\nlegacy drives of their own combined with mere tolerance of dominating males because this\nwas a necessary sacrifice for a women in order to leave her legacy through offspring\nproduction. Moreover, because males had ultimate control, the women of the past who left\nmany descendants are also just as likely to have been those with the physical qualities that\nare most attractive to males, regardless of whether these females had any innate attraction\nto dominant, coercive male behaviors.\nHence, now that many women are empowered, and have their own independent\nwealth in wealthy societies, many are rejecting long-term relationships because of a\nshortage of \"desirable\" males \u00ad not dominant coercive males, but rather, those males that\ndisplay mating behaviors and fertility preferences that are compatible with those of most\nfemales, including behaviors that signal fidelity, sensitivity to gender equality, and\nreliability for assistance with parental care (Aarssen, 2005). These are attractive male\nqualities to a women presumably because they promote female opportunities for\nengagement in meme transmission \u00ad thus helping to satisfy a woman's intrinsic legacy\ndrive (Fig. 2) \u00ad while at the same time retaining opportunity for participation in gene\ntransmission (with her \"desirable\" male) at whatever level of investment she chooses.\nMany childless women, therefore, may not really prefer childlessness per se; rather, they\nmay forgo motherhood because they reject long-term mating. In a recent poll published by\nthe Japanese Yomiuri newspaper (BBC News, 25 February, 2005), a staggering 70% of\nsingle Japanese women reported that they would prefer to remain unwed. In many Asian\ncountries, the desirability of marriage from a woman's point of view is diminished by\ncultural expectations that women will continue to do most of the housework and\nchildrearing, even if they work full time, and also by cultural traditions that openly sanction\nIt is important to note in the above considerations that behaviors promoting zero\nlifetime fertility, although categorically maladaptive, have virtually never had opportunity,\nTransmission Competition Hypothesis\nat least in recent evolutionary history, to be strongly selected against in women. This is\nbecause historically, most women with these behaviors \u00ad regardless of the reasons for them\n\u00ad were largely coerced by men to bear offspring (Aarssen, 2005). This effect might also be\na contributing factor in accounting for the generally lower or less-conspicuous interest in\nsex for women compared with men (Peplau, 2003). The traditional view is that women are\ngenerally less anxious for sex (i.e. heterosexual sex) because this has evolved as an\nadaptive strategy for allowing greater accuracy in choosing high quality mates, and/or, for\nlimiting pregnancies to prevent a mother from having more children than she can\nadequately care for (Blaffer Hrdy, 1999). However, women might also be less anxious for\nsex because, unlike in men, low interest in heterosexual sex has virtually never had\nopportunity to be selected against in women \u00ad because historically, most women, regardless\nof their libido or their sexual orientation, were largely coerced by males to engage in sex\nand at least some offspring production.\nRegardless of the reason \u00ad whether it be low interest in heterosexual sex, rejection\nof mating because of a shortage of desirable males, or low priority for motherhood because\nof engagement in meme transmission \u00ad as many as half of all women in wealthy\ncontemporary societies remain childless, or with at most one offspring, simply because now\nthey can, at frequencies that are unprecedented in recorded human history. In order to\nensure opportunity for their own meme transmission, empowered women in wealthy\ncountries can be expected to continue to successfully reject long-term relationships with\nmales whose behaviors promote high fertility and/or that signal infidelity, insensitivity to\ngender equality, or disinterest in parental care \u00ad thus further promoting the spread of genes\neffecting low-fertility-promoting male behaviors in wealthy countries, and also in poor\ncountries as they become wealthier, and as women there become more empowered. Even\nmales, when they can no longer get away with subjugating females (as is now largely the\ncase in wealthier countries), may also prefer low fertility including childlessness because\nthey too, under these circumstances, incur competition between gene transmission and\nmeme transmission. Interestingly, however, Kohler, Behrman and Skytthe (2005) report,\nfrom a recent survey, that additional children beyond the first child have a negative effect\non subjective well-being for females, but no effect for males.\nWho will be the parents of the future? Because of the current widespread\navailability of cheap and effective contraception, strong sex drives will not rescue us from\npopulation implosion. Natural selection operating currently, however, can be expected\nsoon to exert noticeable effects on the distributions of fertility-promoting behaviors of both\nmales and females. In societies with below-replacement fertility and empowered women,\nthis selection can be expected eventually to cause a return to at least replacement level\nfertility as genes effecting behaviors that promote childlessness in women \u00ad including\ndisinterest in heterosexual sex \u00ad are now allowed, for probably the first significant time in\npost-hunter/gatherer human evolution, to be widely disfavored by natural selection. The\nparents of the future will be the products of this selection, and will inevitably be\ncharacterized by a strong \"parenting drive\" inherited from ancestors also with strong\nparenting drives, some of whom are raising children today. It is easy to imagine a strong\nparenting drive associated with either a refined legacy drive \u00ad where desire to \"leave\nsomething of oneself\" for the future is preferentially expressed through\noffspring/descendant production, without being compromised or \"out-competed\" by other\ndomains of legacy drive \u00ad or resulting simply from a separate and explicit desire for\nTransmission Competition Hypothesis\nchildren, involving strong maternal/nurturing behaviors (e.g. Foster 2000), and having no\nparticular connection with desire to \"leave something of oneself\" for the future. Future\nresearch will be required to understand the nature and consequences of interactions (if any)\nbetween human behaviors that promote \"legacy drive\" versus \"parenting drive\" versus \"sex\ndrive\" \u00ad both heterosexual and homosexual.\nSocieties, however, will inevitably prefer to promote fast-track correctives to\nbelow-replacement fertility through institutional changes \u00ad such as available and affordable\nchildcare \u00ad that make it easier for women to combine work and family (Kohler, Billari and\nOrtega, 2002; Morgan and Berkowitz King, 2001). Even more drastic measures may be\nrequired. In Spain, where almost 50% of men admit to doing no housework at all, a recent\nlaw has been enacted requiring couples to sign a marriage contract whereby they are\nobliged to share domestic responsibilities. Failure to do so will affect the terms of a\ndivorce settlement (BBC news, 17 June, 2005). In searching for solutions, we stress the\nimportance of recognizing that the motivation for meme transmission in humans \u00ad \"legacy\ndrive\" \u00ad is unlikely to go away quickly, if ever, because it represents an intrinsic\nevolutionary product of a long history of natural selection (Fig. 2). In order to be\nsuccessful, it is essential that correctives to very low fertility through institutional changes\nhave the effect of returning again to a state where competition between gene transmission\nand meme transmission is alleviated in human populations. Thankfully, the subjugation of\nwomen by men, although not fully extinguished, is at least no longer a socially or morally\nacceptable means to achieve this in most developed countries. Unfortunately, however,\nthis is not the case in much of the less-developed world, where the opposite problem of\nhigh fertility remains, perhaps, as an even greater challenge.\n"
