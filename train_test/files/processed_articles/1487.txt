We thus explored whether hemoglobin concentrations\nare generally higher in type 1 diabetes.\nfrom the Pittsburgh Epidemiology of Diabetes Complications Study (EDC) of type 1 diabetes\nwere compared with general population data from the National Health and Nutrition Examina-\ntion Survey (NHANES) III in the same age range as the EDC population (aged 8\u00ad48 years).\nRESULTS -- Both male and female EDC study participants had significantly higher hemoglo-\nadolescent female subjects.\nCONCLUSIONS -- Hemoglobin levels may be higher in type 1 diabetes than in the general\npopulation, which may have important clinical implications.\nAlthough low hemoglobin is gener-\nally associated with adverse events\nin diabetes (1) and kidney disease\n(2), we have recently observed relatively\nhigh hemoglobin levels (as high as 18.8\ng/dl) among individuals with type 1 dia-\nbetes and overt nephropathy (3) com-\npared with the general renal disease\npopulation (4). This led us to question\nwhether hemoglobin levels are generally\nelevated in type 1 diabetes. We therefore\nassessed 652 individuals from the Pitts-\nburgh Epidemiology of Diabetes Compli-\ncations Study (EDC) of type 1 diabetes\nand compared the hemoglobin levels ob-\nserved with those of the general National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES) III population.\nMETHODS -- EDC is a 20-year pro-\nspective study based on a well-defined co-\nhort with childhood onset (aged 17\nyears) type 1 diabetes living within 100\nmiles of the University of Pittsburgh at\nstudy baseline (5,6). For these analyses,\nwere examined. Blood samples were as-\nsayed for hemoglobin and A1C. Overt ne-\nphropathy was defined as albumin\nexcretion rate 200 g/min or dialysis/\nrenal transplantation.\nHemoglobin in EDC was measured\nusing the Coulter Counter Model S-Plus\nIV automated blood cell counter (Coulter\nElectronics, Hialeah, FL). General popu-\nlation comparison data were retrieved\nfor Caucasians in the same age range as\nthe EDC population (i.e., aged 8\u00ad48\nyears). Hemoglobin in NHANES III was\nmeasured using a semiautomated cell\ncounter (Coulter hemoglobinometer) (7).\nAppropriate sampling weights were\nused to obtain unbiased estimates of he-\nmoglobin means and SEs in NHANES III.\nThese sampling weights account for the\ncomplex design of the NHANES III sur-\nvey, including oversampling of certain\nsubgroups and nonresponse bias, and\nprovide estimates that are representative\nof the noninstitutionalized U.S. popula-\ntion. Mean hemoglobin levels were calcu-\nlated using PROC Surveymeans in SAS\n9.1.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).\nRESULTS -- Hemoglobin ranged from\n18.7 g/dl in NHANES III. Relative to the\ngeneral population, EDC participants had\nhigher hemoglobin levels overall (15.1 vs.\nThe difference between the two pop-\nulations was greatest in teenage females;\ntes had hemoglobin levels 2 g/dl higher\nthan similarly aged NHANES III females;\nthe difference in boys was 1 g/dl. EDC\nteenage girls had hemoglobin levels simi-\nlar to those of NHANES III teenage boys\n(Fig. 1). In male subjects with type 1 dia-\nbetes, hemoglobin levels were stable until\nabout age 14 years, when they began to\nrise, peaking at 16.9 g/dl at approximately\nage 22 years. A similar rise in hemoglobin,\nthough less steep, was seen in NHANES\nIII male subjects (Fig. 1). In female sub-\njects with type 1 diabetes, hemoglobin\nlevels did not display the same pattern of\na constant rise throughout adolescence\nobserved in male subjects, but rose\nsharply, by 1.6 g/dl, at the beginning of\ntheir teens, remaining elevated through-\nout the teen years, peaking at 15.0 g/dl. In\ncontrast, in NHANES III female subjects\nconstant (Fig. 1).\nIn the general population adults, he-\nmoglobin levels remained relatively stable\nin both sexes. In the EDC type 1 diabetic\npopulation, hemoglobin in male subjects\nbegan to drop in their mid-20s whereas in\nfemale subjects, this occurred earlier (Fig.\n1). The decline in hemoglobin in adult\ntype 1 diabetic male subjects could be ex-\nplained by overt nephropathy, as those\nwithout overt nephropathy showed no\ndecline in adulthood after their mid-20s.\nIn adult type 1 diabetic female subjects,\nthis difference by overt nephropathy sta-\n                                                \nFrom the Department of Epidemiology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvantia.\nCorresponding author: Trevor J.

Women without\novert nephropathy still showed this age-\nrelated decline, and the difference by\novert nephropathy status did not reach\nstatistical significance until age 40 years\n(online appendix Fig. 1 [available at http://\ncare.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/content/full/\nTo determine whether the elevated\nhemoglobin observed in EDC subjects\nmight simply be due to increased\nhemoconcentration from dehydration\nsecondary to poor glycemic control, anal-\nyses were repeated with EDC participants\nrestricted to those with 1) A1C levels\ngreater than or equal to the median and 2)\nA1C levels less than or equal to the me-\ndian. Similar results were obtained to\nthose in Fig. 1.\nIn a subanalysis, hemoglobin levels in\nour 13 African American female subjects\ndid not differ from our Caucasian female\nwere significantly higher than NHANES\nIII African American female subjects\nglobin levels significantly differed be-\ntween NHANES III African American and\nformal analyses in males.\nCONCLUSIONS -- We have demon-\nstrated that hemoglobin levels are higher\nin type 1 diabetes than in the general pop-\nulation, by 1 g/dl. To our knowledge,\nthis is the first report to document this\nfinding. We have shown that this differ-\nence is greatest for adolescent females,\nparticularly striking since in the general\npopulation the adolescent rise in hemo-\nglobin is only observed in male subjects\n(8). Although hemoglobin levels began to\ndecline in type 1 diabetes in the early to\nmid-20s this decline was not observed in\nthe general population. In men with type\n1 diabetes, kidney disease largely ac-\ncounted for this decline. The increase in\nhemoglobin was unrelated to glycemic\ncontrol.\nPotential explanations include a re-\nsponse to generalized hypoxia secondary\nto vascular disease, or a response to tes-\ntosterone, which has been reported to be\nincreased in type 1 diabetes (9,10). In ad-\ndition to the erythropoietic effects of tes-\ntosterone, insulin and insulin-like growth\nfactor-1 and -2 stimulate erythropoietin\nproduction in astrocytes (11). Finally, in-\ntermittent ketosis might lead to increased\n-hydroxy-butyrate, resulting in higher\nfetal hemoglobin (12) and hence total he-\nmoglobin levels. Elevated fetal hemoglo-\nbin has been observed in both children\nand adults with type 1 diabetes and corre-\nlated only weakly (13), or not at all (14),\nwith glycemic control but increased in ado-\nlescence (14). These data have potentially\nimportant clinical implications not only for\ninterpretinghemoglobinvaluesintype1di-\nabetes but also for complications, as we\nhave recently reported that high hemoglo-\nbin is a risk factor for proliferative retinop-\nathyinmen;whileinwomen,whoaremore\nlikely to be in the normal to low end of the\nhemoglobin distribution, a U-shaped rela-\ntionship exists (15).\n"
