The present study used immunohis-\nand CD44v6 levels in breast cancer tissue,\nand investigate their relationships with clin-\nicopathological characteristics.\nPatients and methods\nStudy population\nThe study included samples of tumour tissue\nfrom female patients with breast cancer who\nunderwent surgical resection at Department\nof Radiation Oncology, The First People's\nHospital of Xuzhou, Xuzhou, China,\nPatient diagnoses were confirmed by two\nindependent pathologists (G. L. and Y. X.),\nand tumours were classified according to the\ntumour\u00adnode\u00admetastasis (TNM) system of\nthe International Union against Cancer\napy or chemotherapy prior to enrolment.\nThe Medical Ethics Committees of Soochow\nUniversity and Nanjing Medical University\napproved the study and all patients provided\nwritten informed consent prior to\nenrolment.\nImmunohistochemistry\nFormalin-Exed, paraffin wax-embedded\ntumour tissue and adjacent normal mucosa\nsamples were sliced into 4 mm-thick sections.\nand CD44v6 was performed using ultrasen-\nsitive immunohistochemical kits (Maxim\nCo., Ltd, Fuzhou, China), according to the\nmanufacturer's instructions.\nImmunoreactivity for CD44 proteins was\nobserved as brown, granular staining on the\ncytoplasmic membrane of both cancerous\nand stromal cells. Protein staining was\nevaluated in arbitrarily selected visual\nfields. Staining was classified as: negative\n(\u00c0), 0\u00ad<10% positive cells; weak positive\n(\u00fe), 10\u00ad25% positive cells; positive (\u00fe\u00fe),\n26\u00ad50% positive cells; or strong positive\n(\u00fe\u00fe\u00fe), !51% positive cells. For the pur-\nposes of this study, all positive staining\nlevels (\u00fe, \u00fe\u00fe and \u00fe\u00fe\u00fe) were defined as\npositive.\nStatistical analyses\nData were presented as n. Analysis of vari-\nance, Wilcoxon's rank sum test and\nSpearman's rank correlation analysis were\nused to analyse the relationships between\nclinicopathological features and CD44s,\nStatistical analyses were performed using\nSPSS\u00d5 version 11.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,\nUSA) for Windows\u00d5. P-values < 0.05 were\nconsidered statistically significant.\nResults\nThe study included tissue samples from 60\nfemale patients with breast cancer (42\ninfiltrating ductal carcinomas, seven intra-\nductal carcinomas, six mucinous adenocar-\ncinomas, one medullary carcinoma, three\npapillary adenocarcinomas and one lobular\ninfiltrating carcinoma).

The present study was\ndesigned to determine the value of CD44\nmolecules as tumour markers for breast\ncancer. We found that CD44s was located\nto the cytoplasmic membrane, whereas\nplasm. This suggests that CD44s may be the\nmore useful of these molecules as a thera-\npeutic target.\nThe present study observed that CD44s\nand CD44v6 had identical rates of immu-\nnopositivity, but their cellular location and\nbiological function were different. This iden-\ntical rate of positive staining is likely to be a\ncoincidence, but larger numbers of samples\nare required to confirm this.\nassociated with tumour stage and diameter\nin the present study, indicating that these\nmolecules may be useful tumour markers.\ncorrelated with lymph node involvement. In\ncontrast to our findings, others have found\nsignificant associations between CD44v3\nand tumour development or prognosis.10\u00ad12\nThis inconsistency may be due to hetero-\ngeneity within the tumour itself, differ-\nent standards for evaluating staining,\nor variations in antibody specificity or\nsensitivity.\nInterestingly, tumour diameter and stage\nwere negatively correlated with CD44s but\npositively correlated with CD44v6 in the\npresent study, suggesting that these mol-\necules have opposing roles in breast cancer\ndevelopment. Patients with CD44v6-posi-\ntive/CD44s-negative tumours may have an\nincreased risk of tumour invasion and\nmetastasis. Others have found that normal\nductal epithelial cells of mammary glands\nFigure 1. Representative light photomicrographs showing immunohistochemical staining of breast cancer\n(CD44v6).
