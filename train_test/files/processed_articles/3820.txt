From\n2014, this is an official European Stroke Organisation\nmeeting (ESO-KSU). The ESO-KSU program commit-\ntee approves the final program. The core of the pro-\ngram is formed by consensus sessions, each dedicated to\na topic within clinical stroke research with recent study\nresults.\nThe participants in the consensus session prepare a\ndraft consensus statement, coordinated by the session\nchairpersons and secretary. For the thrombectomy con-\nsensus session 2014, the secretary performed a Pubmed\nsearch for ``mechanical thrombectomy and stroke'',\n``endovascular treatment of stroke'', ``neurointer-\nvention'' and others, as a basis for the draft statement.\nThe draft circulated between the participants providing\nadditional information on literature reviews and new\npublications. The draft was finally confirmed at a face-\nto-face session the afternoon before the start of the\nmeeting and then discussed and modified at the meeting.\nSince the participants at the Karolinska Stroke\nUpdate conference 2014 were aware of that several ran-\ndomized studies on mechanical thrombectomy were\nabout to be published within the next few months, it\nwas decided that the session participants and the con-\nference secretariat should revise the statement when\nrelevant, based on the new reports. Since representa-\ntives of several professional organizations participated\nat the conference, the statement was also reviewed and\nagreed upon by these organizations.\nNew evidence since Karolinska stroke\nSince the previous Karolinska stroke update consensus\nstatement on mechanical thrombectomy 2012 results\nfrom randomized clinical trials and other retrospective\ncohort studies were made available as follows:\nLarge meta-analysis from randomized clinical\ntrials of intravenous thrombolysis (IVT)\nA recently published meta-analysis of individual\npatient data from 6756 patients in nine randomized\ntrials comparing intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) with\nalteplase versus placebo or open control showed that\nalteplase significantly improves functional outcomes\nwhen delivered within 4\u00ad5 h of stroke onset, with\nearlier treatment associated with bigger proportional\ning the need for preventing delays in acute stroke\ntreatment.1\nClinical trials on mechanical thrombectomy\nOlder generation devices and first use of stent\nretrievers. Three trials evaluating endovascular therapy,\npublished in 2013, IMS III, MR RESCUE and\nSYNTHESIS, reported neutral results on clinical out-\ncome. Possible explanations for failure to demonstrate\nsuperiority of endovascular therapy were long delay\nbetween symptom onset and treatment, inadequate\npatient selection, less than desired recanalization rates\nand use of older generation devices. IMS III showed no\ndifference in safety and clinical outcomes compared to\nIVT but used six different procedural techniques with\nonly four patients being treated with the new gener-\nation stent retrievers.2 A subgroup analysis of IMS\nIII showed that 48.2% of the patients were functionally\nindependent at follow-up, corresponding to a modified\nRankin score (mRS) 0\u00ad2 when recanalization to mod-\nified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (mTICI) score\n2b/3 was achieved (for internal carotid artery (ICA)\nocclusions 37\u00ad42% and proximal middle cerebral\nartery (MCA) (M1) occlusions 44%),3 emphasizing\nthe importance of recanalization of proximal occlusion.\nImportantly, IMS III demonstrated that a delay in time\nto reperfusion was associated with lower likelihood of\ngood clinical outcome.4 MR RESCUE allowed proced-\nures up to 8 h based on penumbral imaging but used\nprevious generation MERCI or Penumbra devices\nachieving mTICI 2b/3 recanalization rates of 67%.5\nThe SYNTHESIS EXPANSION trial also used very\nfew stent retrievers.6 However, regarding safety, these\ntrials showed similar rates of symptomatic intracranial\nhemorrhage (SICH) compared to IVT and even equiva-\nlence/superiority of IVT for minor stroke and stroke\nwithout large vessel occlusion on imaging.7\nIn the meantime, evidence for the efficacy and safety\nof stent retrievers in mechanical thrombectomy contin-\nued to grow from non-randomized studies. The solitaire\nInternational Journal of Stroke, 11(1)\nflow restoration thrombectomy for acute revasculariza-\ntion (STAR) study was an international, multicentre,\nprospective, single-arm study of the SolitaireTM device\nin 202 patients with large vessel occlusion of the anter-\nior circulation within 8 h of onset. It reported a 79%\nrate of successful revascularization, 57.9% of mRS 0-2,\n1.5% SICH and 6.9% mortality. Support for stent\nretrievers was further gathered in a 2013 pooled ana-\nlysis of 19 studies using the TrevoTM (n \u00bc 221) or\ndevice complications in 5 and 6%, good functional out-\ncomes in 51 and 47% of the patients with similar times\nto recanalization and with a mortality of 31 and 14%,\nrespectively.8\nStent retrievers in recent randomized controlled trials.

Primary outcome\nwas the severity of global disability at 90 days, as mea-\nsured on the mRS.

The trial was halted after the\nsecond intermediate analysis of 395 patients.

Preliminary results were presented recently\nand the intention to treat analysis showed a strong\ntrend for benefit with this intervention.17\nIn summary, there is very good evidence for early\nthrombectomy with stent retrievers. There is good evi-\ndence to favor stent retrievers over the MERCITM\ndevice. At this moment, only limited data on other\ntypes of recanalization devices such as the\nPenumbraTM system are available.18 Given the variable\nsuccess rates and clinical outcomes with different reca-\nnalization devices in randomized trials, generalizability\nof all transvascular approaches cannot be assumed.\nMeta-analysis of thrombectomy vs. standard treatment. A\nmeta-analysis of recent large trials comparing acute\nthrombectomy with no further treatment in patients\nwith acute ischemic stroke and (suspected or docu-\nmented) large intracranial artery occlusions was also\nperformed by one of the authors (TS). Large rando-\nmized controlled trials with results published in peer-\nreviewed journals over the last three years were\nincluded. In a first analysis, all trials where included,\nand in a second, only the recent ones (published in\n2015) were used where stent retrievers were the predom-\ninant thrombectomy method. Analysed outcomes were\nfavourable outcome defined as an mRS 0-2 at 90 days,\nmortality at 90 days and symptomatic hemorrhage as\ndefined by each study group. ORs and 95% CIs of the\nintention-to-treat analyses were calculated for each out-\ncome using the Mantel-Haenszel method with random\neffects. Heterogeneity between trials was assessed by\nseveral methods. All analyses were performed with\nReview Manager (Version 5.2.6). Results are shown\nin Figures 1 to 3.

Despite high mortality and mor-\nbidity rates associated with basilar artery occlusion,34\nevidence from RCT's on the effect of endovascular\ntreatment is lacking. A recent meta-analysis of 45\nobservational studies (n \u00bc 2056) of reperfusion vs. no\nreperfusion of acute basilar occlusion showed NNT of\n3 and 2.5 to decrease death or dependency and death\nalone, respectively.35\nSingle-centre studies with samples less than 100\npatients have shown good functional outcomes follow-\ning thrombectomy of the basilar artery, ranging from\nHospital showed a 57% rate of good functional out-\n50% to 89%) when there were no signs of acute infarc-\ntion prior to treatment, with about 21% mortality.41\nRecanalization rates over 75% were reported with\nnew generation devices37,42 as well as with older gener-\nation devices in the MERCI and multi-MERCI trials\nbut with lower benefit.43\nA previous prospective registry, the Basilar Artery\nInternational Cooperation Study (BASICS) could\nnot demonstrate superiority of endovascular ther-\napy against IVT; however, it employed mostly older-\ngeneration devices.44 The same investigators are now\nundertaking the BASICS treatment randomized trial,\ncomparing thrombectomy <6 h in addition to IVT\nwith IVT alone.\nAnesthesia in mechanical thrombectomy. Conscious sed-\nation has gained support from a retrospective analysis\nof patients receiving either general anesthesia or con-\nscious sedation (n \u00bc 507 in both groups, 1:1 matching).\nPatients receiving general anesthesia had significantly\nmore in-hospital mortality (25%) and pneumonia\n(17%) compared to patients receiving conscious sed-\nbut similar rates of SICH.45 A recent mini review from\nTakahashi et al.46 also supports conscious sedation.\nPrevious single-centre cohort studies47,48 and a review\nof five such studies49 have reported similar findings.\nThe post-hoc analysis of the thrombectomy patients\nin MR CLEAN showed better functional three\nmonths outcome in the absence of general anesthe-\nsia, but patients were not randomized to the type of\nanesthesia.50 The issue of general anesthesia vs. sed-\nation is currently studied in four randomized\nAn expert consensus statement of the Society of\nNeurointerventional Surgery and the Neurocritical\nCare Society recommends the use of general anes-\nthesia for patients with severe agitation, low level of\nconsciousness (GCS < 8), loss of airway protect-\nive reflexes, respiratory compromise and in selected pos-\nterior circulation stroke presenting with these features.55\nPrehospital patient selection for immediate transfer to centers\nwith multimodal imaging and availability of thrombectomy. A\nrecently published SITS registry study found NIHSS\nscores of 11 and 12 points as predictors of baseline\nvessel occlusion and functional independence at three\nmonths in a cohort of 11,632 patients treated with\nintravenous thrombolysis with available baseline ima-\nging data and three month functional outcome.56\nMoreover, if imaging was performed 3 h after stroke\nonset, NIHSS scores thresholds decreased to 9 and\n10 points in predicting baseline vessel occlusion and\nfunctional independency at three months, respectively.\nHigher NIHSS scores predicted large vessel occlusion\nand functional dependence after three months if treated\nInternational Journal of Stroke, 11(1)\nwith intravenous thrombolysis.

Acute non-invasive arter-\nial imaging: All recent RCT trials of thrombectomy\nused non-invasive arterial imaging (CT-angiography\nor MR-angiography of cerebral and neck arteries)\nto select patients with an intracranial occlusion of the\ndistal carotid and/or MCA or M2 main stem. This may\nbe a reason why such trials were positive, in contrast\nto the previous thrombectomy trials. If non-invasive\narterial imaging cannot be performed, an elevated\nNIHSS ! 9 points within the first 3 h, and ! 7 between\n3 and 6 h strongly suggests an occlusion of a major\nintracranial artery.56,58 Still, acute non-invasive ima-\nging of cervical and intracranial arteries is clearly super-\nior to identify the appropriate patients for acute\nmechanical thrombectomy.\nASPECTS (Alberta Score Program Early CT Score)\non plain CT: The MR CLEAN trial subgroup analysis\nshowed benefit of thrombectomy for patients with\nASPECTS scores of 5 or more points (5\u00ad7 points, OR\nischemic signs.

In the ESCAPE and\nSWIFT-PRIME trials, a lower ASPECTS threshold\nof 5 and 6 were applied, respectively. Above these\nvalues, thrombectomy showed similar efficacy for dif-\nMRI-based imaging: DWI, PWI, mismatch: The\nsingle-centre RECOST study using MRI diffusion-\nweighted imaging (DWI)-derived ASPECTS score on\n165 patients showed benefit of thrombectomy when\nusing this imaging technique for patient selection where\nthe elderly could benefit from stent retriever thrombec-\ntomy if the ischemic core volume was low (with a clear\ncut-off at 70 years old) whereas all patients below 70\nyears of age could benefit.60 A smaller study from the\nsame centre on 31 consecutive patients, focusing on basi-\nlar artery occlusion treated with Solitaire FR device,\nfound a good correlation between brainstem DWI\nscore <3 and favorable clinical outcome.40 The prospect-\nive, single-arm multicentre DEFUSE-2 trial showed\nfavorable clinical outcomes in patients selected for endo-\nvascular treatment with MRI perfusion-weighted ima-\nging (PWI) mismatch in MCA or ICA occlusions\n(n \u00bc 98, about half pre-treated with IVT).61\nPerfusion-CT-based imaging: A multicentre analysis\nof 165 patients, the vast majority of whom underwent\nendovascular or intravenous recanalization treatment,\nshowed independent prognostic value of core and pen-\numbra volumes on clinical outcome.62 The importance of\nrecanalization was particularly striking in patients with\nlarge penumbra volumes.63 In the positive EXTEND-IA\ntrial, patients were selected based on a CT perfusion\nexamination (CTP) showing a mismatch ratio >1.2,\nand absolute mismatch volume >10 ml, and an ischemic\ncore lesion volume <70 ml, using RAPIDTM software.13\nDiscussion regarding ongoing and future studies\non mechanical thrombectomy\nThe recent results from several randomized controlled\nstudies could potentially influence patient recruitment\nin ongoing RCT's such as PISTE64 or BASICS.65 Until\nsteering committees of the respective trials have halted\nthe trial, randomization should be continued to help\nanswer uncertainties of benefit and risk from thromb-\nectomy in acute ischemic stroke.\nStudies comparing active centres (IVT \u00fe possibility\nfor thrombectomy) with control centres that do not\nyet have access to thrombectomy (IVT treatment\nalone), e.g. SITS-OPEN,66 should continue its recruit-\nment to strengthen the level of evidence. There are\nmany reasons to recommend this approach such as\nthe need for confirmatory studies, the desirability of\nnarrowing the confidence interval to get a tighter esti-\nmate of the effect size for health economic reasons and\nthe necessity for a wide range of data allowing sub-\ngroup analysis with adequate power. This type of\ndesign will also test thrombectomy in standard clinical\npractice in experienced centres.\nIn addition, it is desirable that all patients undergo-\ning some form of acute revascularization therapy (IVT,\nmechanical thrombectomy, etc.) are prospectively\nincluded in registries (e.g. SITS-ISTR67 or SITS-\nTBY68) to ensure further evidence from routine clinical\npractice data.\nConsensus statements of the ESO-Karolinska\nPrepared in November 2014, updated and released on\nInternational Journal of Stroke, 11(1)\n(Sources: Karolinska Stroke Update level of evi-\ndence for treatment recommendation: Appendix 1;\nOxford Evidence-based level of evidence: Appendix 2)\nTreatment recommendations\n. Mechanical thrombectomy, in addition to intraven-\nous thrombolysis within 4.5 h when eligible, is rec-\nommended to treat acute stroke patients with large\nartery occlusions in the anterior circulation up to 6 h\nafter symptom onset (Grade A, Level 1a, KSU\nGrade A). \u00ad new\n. Mechanical thrombectomy should not prevent the\ninitiation of intravenous thrombolysis where this is\nindicated, and intravenous thrombolysis should not\ndelay mechanical thrombectomy (Grade A, Level 1a,\nKSU Grade A). \u00ad changed\n. Mechanical thrombectomy should be performed\nas soon as possible after its indication (Grade A,\nLevel 1a, KSU Grade A).\n. For mechanical thrombectomy, stent retrievers\napproved by local health authorities should primar-\nily be considered (Grade A, Level 1a, KSU Grade\nA). \u00ad new\n. Other thrombectomy or aspiration devices approved\nby local health authorities may be used upon the neu-\nrointerventionists discretion if rapid, complete and\nsafe revascularisation of the target vessel can be\nachieved (Grade C, Level 2a, KSU Grade C) \u00ad new\n. If intravenous thrombolysis is contraindicated (e.g.\nWarfarin-treated with therapeutic INR) mechanical\nthrombectomy is recommended as first-line treatment\nin large vessel occlusions (Grade A, Level 1a, KSU\nGrade A) \u00ad changed and updated level of evidence.\n. Patients with acute basilar artery occlusion should\nbe evaluated in centres with multimodal imaging and\ntreated with mechanical thrombectomy in addition\nto intravenous thrombolysis when indicated (Grade\nC, Level 4, KSU Grade C); alternatively they may be\ntreated within a randomized controlled trial for\nthrombectomy approved by the local ethical com-\nmittee \u00ad new\n. The decision to undertake mechanical thrombec-\ntomy should be made jointly by a multidisciplinary\nteam comprising at least a stroke physician and a\nneurointerventionist and performed in experienced\ncentres providing comprehensive stroke care\nand expertise in neuroanaesthesiology (Grade C,\nLevel 5, GCP, KSU Grade C).\n. Mechanical thrombectomy should be performed by\na trained and experienced neurointerventionist who\nmeets national and/or international requirements\n(Grade B, Level 2b, KSU Grade B) \u00ad changed in\nlevel of evidence.\n. The choice of anaesthesia depends on the individual\nsituation; independently of the method chosen, all\nefforts should be made to avoid thrombectomy\ndelays (Grade C, Level 2b, KSU Grade C) \u00ad changed.\nPatient selection\n. Intracranial vessel occlusion must be diagnosed with\nnon-invasive imaging whenever possible before con-\nsidering treatment with mechanical thrombectomy\n(Grade A, Level 1a, KSU Grade A) \u00ad new.\n. If vessel imaging is not available at baseline, a\nNIHSS score of ! 9 within three, and ! 7 points\nwithin 6 h may indicate the presence of large vessel\nocclusion (Grade B, Level 2a, KSU Grade B) \u00ad new.\n. Patients with radiological signs of large infarcts\n(for ex. using the ASPECTS score) may be unsuit-\nable for thrombectomy (Grade B, Level 2a, KSU\nGrade B) \u00ad new\n. Imaging techniques for determining infarct and\npenumbra sizes can be used for patient selection\nand correlate with functional outcome after mechan-\nical thrombectomy (Grade B, Level 1b, KSU\nGrade B) \u00ad new.\n. High age alone is not a reason to withhold mechan-\nical thrombectomy as an adjunctive treatment\n(Grade A, Level 1a, KSU Grade A) \u00ad new.\nRecommendation for implementation,\nregistries and further trials\n. Health authorities are strongly encouraged to imple-\nment access to thrombectomy within a reasonable\ntime range in a network including stroke centres.\nAccess to thrombectomy should be organised in\na way that time between symptoms onset and to\nthrombectomy is minimised and that adequate com-\npetence within neurointervention, neurology, neuror-\nadiology, neurosurgery and neuroanaesthesiology is\nprovided. \u00ad new.\n. It is encouraged to perform and include patients in\nRCT addressing unresolved thrombectomy ques-\ntions such as thrombectomy for basilar artery\nocclusion, treatment in a late und unknown time\nwindows, treating patients with imaging findings\nnot sufficiently covered in recent trials, com-\nparing new devices with widely-used stent retrie-\nvers, thrombectomy with or without intravenous\nthrombolysis, and different types of anaesthesia.\n\u00ad new.\n. Non-randomized trials comparing centres not yet\nhaving access to mechanical thrombectomy with\nothers should continue (such as SITS OPEN) \u00ad new.\nInternational Journal of Stroke, 11(1)\n. Ischemic stroke patients undergoing any type of\nacute revascularization treatment should be included\nsystematically in national or international registries\n(such as SITS or SITS-TBY) \u00ad new.\nOrganisations represented by the authors\nNils Wahlgren, Tiago Moreira, Patrik Michel, Thorsten\nSteiner, Olav Jansen, Christophe Cognard, Heinrich\nP Mattle, Wim van Zwam, Staffan Holmin, Turgut\nTatlisumak, Jesper Petersson, Valeria Caso, Werner Hacke:\nEuropean Stroke Organisation-Karolinska Stroke Update\n(ESO-KSU) consensus conference\nNils Wahlgren, Tiago Moreira, Patrik Michel, Thorsten\nSteiner, Christophe Cognard, Heinrich P Mattle, Turgut\nTatlisumak, Valeria Caso, Werner Hacke, Mikael Mazighi,\nMarcel Arnold, Urs Fischer, Jens Fiehler, Jan Gralla,\nKennedy R Lees: European Stroke Organisation (ESO)\nChristophe Cognard, Istvan Szikora, Laurent Pierot, Jens\nFiehler, Jan Gralla, Olav Jansen: European Society of\nMinimally Invasive Neurological Therapy (ESMINT)\nJens Fiehler, Jan Gralla, Olav Jansen: European Society of\nNeuroradiology (ESNR)\nFranz Fazekas: European Academy of Neurology (EAN)\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research,\nauthorship, and/or publication of this article.\nIndividual Funding\nJens Fiehler has received funding from the German Research\nFoundation (DFG) and the German Ministry of Education\nand Research (BMBF).\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author(s) declared the following potential conflicts of\ninterest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or pub-\nlication of this article: Marcel Arnold had speaker engage-\nments and advisory boards for Covidien, and Boehringer-\nIngelheim, BMS, Pfizer and Bayer and declared co-author-\nChristoph Cognard was a co-author of SWIFT Prime.\nValeria Caso declares speaker's bureau for Boehringer\nIngelheim and Pfizer and advisory board for Boehringer-\nIngelheim.\nFranz Fazekas has no conflicts of interest.\nJens Fiehler has received fees as consultant or lecturer from\nAcandis, Bayer, Boehringer-Ingelheim, Codman, Covidien,\nMicroVention, Penumbra, Philips, Sequent, Siemens and\nStryker.
