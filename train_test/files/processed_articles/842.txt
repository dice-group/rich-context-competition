A study from the Third\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey\nIS Okosun1*, Y Liao2, CN Rotimi3, GEA Dever1 and RS Cooper2\n1Department of Community Medicine, Mercer University School of Medicine, 1550 College Street Macon, GA, USA; 2Department of\nPreventive Medicine and Epidemiology, Loyola University Medical Center, Stritch School of Medicine, Maywood, IL, USA; and 3\nNational Human Genome Center, College of Medicine, Howard University Washington, DC, USA\nOBJECTIVE: To determine the types of subcutaneous adiposity represented by different measurements of skinfold\nthickness that are associated with birth weight in white (n  759), Black (n  916) and Hispanic (n  813) American\nchildren aged 5\u00b111 y. We also determined the contribution of birth weight to ethnic differences in subcutaneous and\ncentral adiposity.\nDESIGN AND METHODS: Data for this analysis were from the Third US National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey. The outcome measures were triceps, subscapular, suprailliac and thigh skinfold thicknesses at 5\u00b111 y of age.\nCentral adiposity was de\u00aened as ratios of subscapular to triceps (STR) and central\u00b1peripheral (CPR) (subscapu-\nlarsuprailliac)a(tricepsthigh) skinfolds. Partial correlation analyses were used to determine the association\nbetween birth weight and measures of subcutaneous fatness, while multiple linear regression analyses were used\nto determine the independent contribution of birth weight to ethnicity variations in subcutaneous and central\nadiposity adjusting for sex, age and BMI.\nRESULTS: Overall, birth weight was negatively associated with subscapular skinfold and central adiposity in White,\nBlack and Hispanic American children (P ` 0.05). Birth weight was also negatively associated with suprailliac skinfold\nin both Blacks and Hispanics (P ` 0.01) and with sum of the four skinfolds in Blacks (P ` 0.05). Compared with White,\nBlack ethnicity was negatively associated with triceps, suprailliac thigh and sum of skinfold thicknesses controlling for\nbirth weight, sex, age and BMI (P ` 0.01). Compared with White, Hispanic ethnicity was negatively associated with\ntriceps, thigh and sum of skinfold thicknesses (P ` 0.01). Both Black and Hispanic ethnicity was positively associated\nCONCLUSIONS: In this population of American children, the association of birth weights with subcutaneous and\ncentral fat accumulation may be due to fetal programming. Since the impact of fetal conditions is likely to be modi\u00aeed\nby life course, de\u00aening the interaction between factors that are present at birth and subsequent exposures is one of\nthe essential challenges for future research.\nKeywords: low birth weight; central\u00b1peripheral skinfold ratio; subcutaneous adiposity\nIntroduction\nIn sharp contrast to the traditional belief that most\ncardiovascular diseases (CVD) and metabolic disor-\nders are caused by aberrant lifestyle risk factors,\nrecent epidemiological studies have shown that envir-\nonmental factors acting in early life may play an\nimportant role in the pathogenesis of diseases of\nadulthood.1\u00b18 As proposed, nutritional insults experi-\nenced by the mother have a life-long imprint on organ\nsize and function of the child. The physiological\nmechanisms associated with inadequate fetal devel-\nopment may be `irreversibly programmed' to confer a\nsurvival advantage. As the infant grows, such pro-\ngramming would result in adverse consequences of\nglucose intolerance, hypertension and other metabolic\nsyndromes later in life.1\u00b13 Since low birth weight (one\nof the consequences of adverse intrauterine develop-\nment) and adult CVD are both more common among\nUS ethnic groups and account for a very substantial\nportion of the observed health disadvantage,9 the\nimpact of birth weight on CVD could have special\nrelevance for non-Whites such as Blacks and Hispa-\nnics.\nWhile previous studies using anthropometric\nindices such as body mass index (BMI), waist cir-\ncumference and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) have\ndemonstrated obesity as an important correlate of\n*Correspondence: Dr IS Okosun, Assistant Professor for\nCommunity Medicine, Mercer University School of Medicine,\nE-mail: okosun_i@mercer.edu\nwww.nature.com/ijo\nCVD risk factors,10\u00b114 little has been studied using\nskinfold thicknesses as surrogate measures of adipos-\nity in children. Despite the overwhelming evidences\nof the role of central adiposity in CVD, there has been\nlittle study with regard to the role of birth weight in\ncentral adiposity estimated from skinfold thicknesses\nin children.\nFirst described some 40 y ago,15 the exact role of\ncentral fat distribution in CVD is not clear. Two\npossible mechanisms have been suggested for the\nmode of action of central obesity on CVD. One,\nresistant elevated free fatty acid (FFA) is hypothe-\nsized to provoke insulin resistance through hypertro-\nphied visceral adipose tissues that have highly\nsensitive lipolytic machinery.16\u00b117 The causal connec-\ntion of central obesity with CVD may be due to the\nenlarged visceral fat depot producing excess FFA into\nthe portal and systemic circulation.18 Two, elevated\nfree testosterone and reduced sex-hormone-binding\nglobulin, have been suggested to promote increased\ncentral adiposity and reduce fractional hepatic extrac-\nAlthough WHR and waist girths are the most\nfrequently used anthropometric indices of central fat\ndeposits in adults, their use in children is not clear. At\nyounger ages, WHR and waist circumference are not\nas good as skinfold thicknesses as indicators of central\nfat distribution.19\u00b120 Indeed, it has been shown that the\nassessment of percentage body fat in prepubertal\nchildren from skinfold thicknesses has a prediction\nerror of only 3\u00b15%.19 Subscapular, suprailliac, thigh\nand triceps skinfold thicknesses have been described\nas the best anthropmetric indices for adiposity in\nchildren compared with WHR or waist circumfer-\nTo our knowledge, the impact of birth weight on\nethnic differences in subcutaneous and central adi-\nposity estimated from skinfold thicknesses has been\nlittle investigated. The objective of this investigation\nwas therefore to determine which types of subcuta-\nneous and central adiposity, represented by different\nmeasurements of skinfold thicknesses, are associated\nwith birth weight in White, Black and Hispanic\nAmerican children aged 5\u00b111 y. We also sought to\ndetermine the contribution of birth weight to ethnic\ndifferences in subcutaneous and central adiposity.\nMethods\nData source\nData from the Third National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES III) were used in this\ninvestigation. Other investigators have described the\nsampling and measurement procedures of NHANES\nIII in detail.21\u00b123 Brie\u00afy, NHANES III is a multistage\nprobability sample of non-institutionalized US civi-\nlian population groups de\u00aened and examined between\nHispanic Americans. Only children ranging from 5\nto 11 y and identi\u00aeed as non-Hispanic White, non-\nHispanic Black or Hispanic Americans were eligible\nfor this investigation.\nThis analysis was also restricted to singleton chil-\ndren with available anthropometric variables, includ-\ning weight and height, waist, hip and thigh\ncircumferences. Only children with known birth\nweights who were measured for subcutaneous skin-\nfold thicknesses (n  2488), including triceps, sub-\nscapular, suprailliac and thigh skinfolds, were\neligible for this study.\nSkinfold measurements\nAll skinfolds were measured with the Holtain skinfold\ncalipers at the right side of the body with subjects in\nstanding position. A fold of the skin and the under-\nlying subcutaneous adipose tissue were gently grasped\nbetween left thumb and fore\u00aengers 2.0 cm above the\nplace where the measurement was taken. The jaws of\nthe calipers were placed perpendicular to the length of\nthe fold, and the skin thickness was measured to the\nnearest 0.1 mm, while the \u00aengers continued to hold\nthe skinfold. Actual measurements were read from the\ncaliper about 3 s after the caliper tension was released.\nTriceps skinfold. With the subject shoulders relaxed\nand arms hanging freely at the sides, triceps skinfold\nwas measured at the point on the posterior surface of\nthe upper arm.\nSubscapular skinfold. After palpating the anterior\nangle of the right scapular, a mark was made at the\ninterior angle of the scapular with a cosmetic pencil\nmarker. A fold of skin 1.0 cm directly below and\nmedial of the interior angle about 45 below the\nhorizontal extending toward the right elbow was\nutilized.\nSuprailliac skinfold. Placing the right thumb on the\nintersecting marks, the skinfold was picked up with\nthumb and \u00aengers. With the skinfold sloped down-\nward and forward at a 45 angle extending toward the\npupis sympysis, the caliper was placed perpendicular\nto the skinfold about 2.0 cm medial to the \u00aengers.\nThigh skinfold. A mark was made with a measuring\ntape placed around the midthigh. A fold of skin and\nsubcutaneous tissue was grasped in the midline about\n2.0 cm above the marked point.\nWeight was measured at a standing position using a\nToledo self-zeroing weight scale. Height was mea-\nsured at an upright position with a standiometer.\nWaist measurement was made at the midpoint\nbetween the bottom of the rib cage and above the\ntop of the iliac crest. Measurements of waist circum-\nSubcutaneous and central adiposity in American children\nIS Okosun et al\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nferences were made for each subject at minimal\nrespiration to the nearest 0.1 cm. Hip measurement\nwas made at points of maximum extension of the\nbuttocks. Height was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm,\nweight to the nearest 0.01 kg.\nBody mass index was calculated as the measured\nweight in kilograms divided by height in meters\nsquared (kgam2 ). WHR was calculated as waist\ndivided by hip circumference measured in centi-\nmeters. Two indices of central adiposity were calcu-\nlated from skinfolds: Central\u00b1peripheral (CPR) as\n(subscapular skinfoldsuprailliac skinfold)a(triceps\nskinfoldthigh skinfold), and ratio of subscapular to\ntriceps skinfold (STR). STR is an index of relative\ndistribution of central subcutaneous adiposity. The\nsum of the four skinfolds (SUM) was calculated\nfrom triceps, subscapular, suprailliac and thigh skin-\nfolds in the total sample. The SUM provides a single\nmeasure of subcutaneous adiposity.\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical programs available in SPSS for Windows\nwere utilized for these analyses.24 One-way analysis\nof variance (ANOVA) was used to compare birth\nweight, anthropometric and skinfold thicknesses\nacross ethnic group. Partial correlation analyses\nwere also performed to determine the association\nbetween birth weight and measures of subcutaneous\nfatness, including triceps, subscapular suprailliac,\nthigh, SUM, STR and CPR, controlling for sex, age\nand BMI. Multiple linear regression analyses were\nused to determine the independent contribution of\nbirth weight to ethnic variations in subcutaneous and\ncentral adiposity, adjusting for sex, age and BMI. The\ncustomary P-values of 0.05 were used to specify\nstatistical signi\u00aecance.\nResults\nTables 1 and 2 describe the birth weight, anthropo-\nmetric and subcutaneous skinfold characteristics of\nthe study participants.

Among sam-\nples of children examined in the Bogalusa Heart\nStudy, an association between low birth weight and\nelevated triglyceride concentrations in later childhood\nThis is the \u00aerst investigation utilizing NHANES III\nto determine the impact of birth weight on ethnic\ndifferences in subcutaneous and central adiposity\nrepresented by different measurements of skinfold\nthicknesses in White, Black and Hispanic American\nchildren aged 5\u00b111 y. NHANES III represents the best\navailable data since the sampling scheme was repre-\nsentative and national in scope. The training program\nand quality control measures instituted in NHANES\nIII give an added credence to the data.\nThe results of this investigation showed that birth\nweight was negatively associated with subscapular\nand central adiposity determined by STR and CPR\nin White, Black and Hispanic American children. The\nresults of our analysis also showed that birth weight\nwas negatively associated with suprailliac skinfold in\nboth Blacks and Hispanics and with sum of the four\nskinfolds in Blacks.\nThe lower birth weights observed for Black boys\nand girls compared to White and Hispanic counter-\nparts in this study are consistent with other\n\u00aendings.28\u00b132 The lower values of some skinfolds,\nsuch as triceps, thigh and SUM observed in Black\nchildren compared to Whites and Hispanics in this\ninvestigation are also consistent with the observations\nof other investigators.33\u00b136 The negative association of\nbirth weight with STR in our this study is consistent\nwith the observations of Malina et al,36 in which a\nnegative correlation between birth weight and STR\nis also consistent with the result of the study by Baker\net al,37 investigating the association between birth\nweight and body fat distribution in a group of 14\u00b1\n16 y old adolescent girls born in Southampton. Con-\nsistent with our \u00aendings, Baker et al 37 also observed a\nnegative association of birth weight with subscapular\nsigni\u00aecant association between birth weight and tri-\nceps skinfold thickness.\nIn contrast to the notion that metabolic abnormal-\nities due to intrauterine development may only mani-\nfest themselves in adulthood, we have shown that the\neffect of low birth weight can occur as early as 5\u00b111 y\nof age. This observation is consistent with the \u00aendings\ninvestigating the role of thinness at birth in blood\npressures, glucose, insulin metabolism at eleven,\nresults are consistent with the notion that ethnic or\nracial differences in CVD may be associated with the\nstate of infant nutrition determined by environments\nin utero.1\u00b18 Compared with White, Black and Hispa-\nnic ethnicity were both negatively associated with\nbirth weight controlling for sex, age and BMI. The\nresults of this study also showed that for the same\nlevel of birth weight the three ethnic groups have\ndifferent values of central fat deposit.\nConclusion\nIn this population of American children, the associa-\ntion of birth weights with subcutaneous and central fat\naccumulation may be due to fetal programming. It is\nobvious that the impact of fetal conditions is likely to\nbe modi\u00aeed by life course. Perinatal in\u00afuences are\nlikely to be greatest when a small infant becomes a\nlarge adult, thus amplifying the effect on CVD in\npopulations with a high incidence of both low birth\nweight and obesity. A substantial proportion of the\nincreased risk observed for some CVD such as hyper-\ntension and diabetes among some US ethnic groups\nmay be due to this interaction. De\u00aening the interaction\nbetween factors that are present at birth and subse-\nquent exposures is one of the essential challenges for\nfuture research.\n"
