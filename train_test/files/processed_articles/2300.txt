    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: Little is known about differences in professional care seeking based on marital status. The few\nexisting studies show more professional care seeking among the divorced or separated compared to the married\nor cohabiting. The aim of this study is to determine whether, in a sample of the European general population, the\ndivorced or separated seek more professional mental health care than the married or cohabiting, regardless of self-\nreported mental health problems. Furthermore, we examine whether two country-level features\u00adthe supply of\nmental health professionals and the country-level divorce rates\u00adcontribute to marital status differences in\nprofessional care-seeking behavior.\nMethods: We use data from the Eurobarometer 248 on mental well-being that was collected via telephone\nhierarchical regression models were estimated to examine whether the divorced or separated have higher\nprofessional health care use for emotional or psychological problems, after controlling for mental and somatic\nhealth, sociodemographic characteristics, support from family and friends, and degree of urbanization. We also\nconsidered country-level divorce rates and indicators of the supply of mental health professionals, and applied\ndesign and population weights.\nResults: We find that professional care seeking is strongly need based. Moreover, the divorced or separated\nconsult health professionals for mental health problems more often than people who are married or who cohabit\ndo. In addition, we find that the gap between the divorced or separated and the married or cohabiting is highest\nin countries with low divorce rates.\nConclusions: The higher rates of professional care seeking for mental health problems among the divorced or\nseparated only partially correlates with their more severe mental health problems. In countries where marital\ndissolution is more common, the marital status gap in professional care seeking is narrower, partially because\nprofessional care seeking is more common among the married or cohabiting.\nBackground\nThe increase in the divorce rate has received a great deal\nof scientific attention. Most research has focused on the\nconsequences of divorce or separation for ex-partners and\ntheir children. The health consequences of divorce are\nalso well documented, showing the detrimental effects of\ndivorce on both somatic [1-5] and mental health [2,6-9],\nwith the divorced or separated experiencing higher levels\nof depression, stress, and fear, as well as lower levels of\nself-esteem [10-20]. However, little is known about how\nthese adverse mental health consequences translate into\nthe use of health care services. A few existing studies have\nindicated that mental health care use and health care use\nin general is higher among the divorced or separated than\namong the married or cohabiting, regardless of mental\nhealth status [21-24]. Compared to the married or coha-\nbiting, the divorced or separated visit professional health\ncare providers like general practitioners [21], specialists\n[21], and psychiatrists [22] more often, and are also hospi-\ntalized more often [21,25]. Single mothers seem to suffer\n* Correspondence: piet.bracke@ugent.be\nDepartment of Sociology, Ghent University, Belgium, Korte Meer 5, 9000\nGhent, Belgium\n\u00a9 2010 Bracke et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Moreover, Dutch research has indicated that the\ndivorced or separated not only have higher rates of mental\nhealth care use, they also have higher rates of unmet need.\nThis means that they are more often in a situation in\nwhich they have mental health care needs but do not\nreceive sufficient care [30]. On the other hand, for a sub-\ngroup of single mothers, a Canadian study found that the\nhigher use of professionals for mental health reasons\nreflected their higher rates of psychopathology [29].\nApart from Bijl and Ravelli's study [30], the aforemen-\ntioned studies were not based on a representative sample\nof the general population, did not adjust for important\nintermediary variables or confounders like socioeconomic\nstatus and the availability of informal support [25], or did\nnot include data on anyone other than women [25].\nFurthermore, existing studies have focused only on a\nsingle country\u00adthe United States of America [22], the\ncare seeking for mental health problems. In this study,\nwe examine whether there are differences between\nthe divorced and the married in professional care seeking\ndue to mental health problems, using a representative\nsample of the population of 29 European countries. Based\non Andersen's Behavioral Model [32], we are able to iden-\ntify some social structural determinants that explain these\nindividual differences in mental health care consumption\nat both the individual and the country level. Andersen's\nBehavioral Model asserts that the consumption of medical\ncare depends on the presence of predisposing characteris-\ntics, enabling resources, and need factors.\nPredisposing characteristics are those features that are\npresent before the development of a mental health pro-\nblem. We consider household composition, education,\nwork status, age, and gender to be relevant predisposing\nfeatures.\nThe predisposing characteristic that is our main inter-\nest is household composition\u00admore specifically, marital\nstatus. A few studies that exist show that different family\ncompositions are associated with different amounts of\nhealth care use [25,33] and demonstrate that there is a\nhigher mental health care consumption among the\ndivorced or separated than the married or cohabiting\nposition is the presence of children. Because divorced\nparents are forced to maintain contact with each other,\nthe presence of children in the household may have an\nimpact on their mental health. In addition, having sole\ncustody of children often involves parenting strain and\nfinancial costs, making it more difficult to find a job,\nmake new friends, or find a new partner [35-37], all of\nwhich act as important buffers against mental health\nproblems (e.g., [2]). On the other hand, children may\nadd a sense of meaning to parents' lives, and older chil-\ndren in particular may be an important source of practi-\ncal and social support for their parents [38,39].\nEducational level also affects the amount of mental\nhealth care consumption sought. Even after controlling\nfor mental health status, the lower educated are less\ninclined to turn to professional mental health care ser-\nvices [24]. Previous research has indicated that divorce\nis more common among the highly educated [40], which\nmay explain the higher mental health care use among\nthe divorced. Recently, however, some authors [41,42]\nhave argued that in countries where the cost of divorce\nhas decreased, the lower educated are more at risk of\ndivorce, undermining that explanation.\nWork status also correlates with the use of mental\nhealth care: compared to working people, people outside\nof the labor market, like the unemployed, the retired,\nand housewives and househusbands, are found to be\nless inclined to seek professional care because of mental\nhealth problems [24,43], even after mental health status\nis controlled for. Consequently, since divorced people\nhave an increased risk of being laid off [44,45], we could\nexpect them to seek professional mental health care less\noften.\nWith regard to age, the risk of illness increases with\nage and, consequently, health care consumption expands\nResearch has also shown that women have higher\nresearch indicates that this is largely explained by the\nexistence of gender differences in mental health regard-\nless of marital status [46]. Some researchers assert that\nbeing divorced or separated has a more severe impact\non the mental health of women than of men [12,48],\nwhich may explain higher mental health care consump-\ntion by divorced women. Others explain these gender\ndifferences in service use by pointing out that women\nare generally found to be more inclined to seek profes-\nsional help, even after their actual need is controlled for\n[49]. According to these researchers, the impact of mari-\ntal status on mental health care consumption might\ntherefore differ by gender, with women having a higher\nmental health care use rate than men.\nEnabling resources are the means and knowledge\nneeded to acquire care. To receive care, one has to pos-\nsess both financial means and the knowledge of where\nto go to seek help. In Europe, the wealthy are more\nlikely to seek out specialist care, while access to primary\ncare seems to be pro-poor or equal for all income\ngroups, even after controlling for need [50,51]. In addi-\ntion, social support from relatives and friends can be\nconsidered an enabling resource. On the one hand,\nsocial support can encourage health care use, as social\nnetworks may help with the recognition of the develop-\nment of health problems and may stimulate a person to\nsocial support may also impede health care consump-\ntion. Individuals experiencing problems usually turn to\ntheir immediate environment for help before contacting\nformal care services. However, as individuals with low\nlevels of social support cannot rely on the help of their\nacquaintances, asking for professional care can be a way\nto compensate for a lack of social support [32,55]. Com-\npared to the married and cohabiting, the divorced have\nsmaller social networks and less social support available\nto them [56]. In addition to the loss of their former\npartner, they also lose half of their relatives and, often,\nsome shared friends [38]. We therefore expect the\ndivorced to have higher mental health care use due to\nless available social support.\nNeed factors include health status and the perceived\nneed for help [21,32]. On average, the divorced, com-\npared to the married, have worse somatic [2,4,5,21] and\nmental health statuses. They experience higher levels of\ndistress, depression, and anxiety [2,6,7], and have to deal\nwith certain somatic problems more frequently [2],\noften putting an extra burden on their mental health.\nThe differences in mental and physical health can be\nlargely\u00adbut not completely\u00adexplained by a socioeco-\nnomic situation that is worse and by a lack of social\nsupport [2,3,57]. Other explanations are health selection\neffects\u00adhealthier individuals are less likely to divorce\n[2,4,58], the damaging effects of the stigmatization of\ndivorce, and the occurrence of negative life events as a\nconsequence of divorce, for example, having to move\n[2]. Thus, the higher health care consumption of the\ndivorced may be in large part a consequence of worse\nphysical and/or mental health. However, even after con-\ntrolling for these need factors, previous research indi-\ncates that the mental health care consumption rate of\nthe divorced seems to remain higher than that of the\nmarried [21,25]. Moreover, persons without a partner\nexpress higher unmet care needs than those living with\nTo control for between-country differences in the\ndistribution of our key variables\u00admarital status and\nprofessional care consumption\u00adwe consider two country-\nlevel indicators, the country-level divorce rates and the\nsupply of professional care.\nWe expect to see differences between countries in the\nuse of mental health services on the basis of marital sta-\ntus, because norms and values about family and divorce\nas well as social policies about marital dissolution and\nsole parenthood vary between countries [59]. At present,\nthere is insufficient research on the link between the\ndivorce rate and marital status differences as they relate\nto mental health service use. However, we see two\npossible ways in which the divorce rate might interact\nwith the relation between marital status and mental\nhealth services use. First, we expect to find that higher\ndivorce rates go hand in hand with an enhanced profes-\nsional service use by the divorced. Although more subtle\nforms of stigmatization are still possible [60], one can\nexpect divorce to be less stigmatized in countries where\nthe divorce rate is higher [61], making it easier for the\ndivorced to seek help [62]. Second, there are indications\nthat the use of professional care among the divorced\ncould actually be lower in countries with a high divorce\nrate. On the basis of social comparison theory [62] and\nof research on divorce and stigma [60], we can assume\nthat people in high-divorce countries will no longer\nview marital dissolution as different or problematic\n[7,63-65], resulting in a relative decline in professional\ncare seeking among the divorced. Of course, it is also\npossible that the divorce rate has no effect on profes-\nsional care consumption beyond the compositional\neffects that result from the marital status composition of\nthe population.\nThe availability of mental health services may also\ninfluence utilization [66]. We expect that the use of pro-\nfessional mental health care will be greater in countries\nwhere help is available and accessible. According to\nWang et al. [67], unmet need is worse in low- and mid-\ndle-income countries, and the treatment gap may there-\nfore be attributable to the reduced amount these nations\nhave to spend on mental health care from health bud-\ngets that are already overburdened [66]. Consequently,\nwe can expect cross-national variation in the availability\nof mental health services to influence utilization, even\namong middle- and high-income European countries.\nHence, the availability of general or more specialized\nprofessionals is a supply-side factor that should not be\nignored [68] and that could be incorporated into Ander-\nsen's model as an important enabling factor at the\nsupra-individual level. Country-level indicators are\nunable to accommodate important within-country\ndifferences in the availability of mental health services.\nIn order to consider these within-country differences,\nwe also include the degree of urbanization in the area of\nresidence as a rough indicator of the availability of more\nspecialized mental health professionals [68]. Differences\nbetween rural and urban areas may also signal differ-\nences in stigma beliefs. For instance, as Hoyt and collea-\ngues [50] have shown, in the rural areas of the United\nStates a reluctance to seek professional help is closely\nlinked to stigmatizing beliefs about mental health care.\nIn sum, we will first examine whether a difference\nexists between the married or cohabiting and the\ndivorced or separated in their use of professional health\ncare for emotional or psychological problems. Second,\nwe will try to uncover some predisposing, enabling, and\nneed factors that explain this possible difference in\namount of use. Finally, we intend to examine between-\ncountry variation by introducing country characteris-\ntics\u00addivorce rate and the supply of services\u00adinto the\nanalysis.\nMethod\nSample\nWe derived data from multistage national probability\nsamples of the general population of 29 European coun-\ntries collected during the Eurobarometer 248 survey\npling design in all participating countries was based on\na random selection of sampling areas stratified by urba-\nnization (the distribution of metropolitan, urban, and\nrural areas). A cluster of addresses were selected from\nthese sampled areas. In each household at a sampled\naddress, a respondent was selected using a random\nselection procedure [69]. Telephone interviews were\nconducted with European Union citizens residing in the\n25 member countries, with the citizens of the two then-\nacceding countries Bulgaria and Romania, and with the\ntwo candidate countries Croatia and Turkey including\nthe citizens of the Turkish Cypriot Community. In our\nanalyses, we merged the data from East and West Ger-\nmany, from Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom,\nand from the Republic of Cyprus and the Turkish\nCypriot Community. For the present analysis, we limited\nthe sample to respondents aged 21 and older; respon-\ndents from all marital status categories were included.\nWe applied population weights so that each country was\nrepresented in proportion to its population size, and we\nconsidered country-specific design weights to correct for\ndifferences within national populations in gender, age,\nregion, and size of locality.\nThe resulting samples are representative of the popu-\nlation of citizens in the included countries aged 21 and\nstatistics of the weighted sample.\nVariables\nProfessional care use\nThe dependent variable professional care use was mea-\nsured by the total number of different health profes-\nsionals\u00adgeneral practitioner, psychiatrist, psychologist,\npsychoanalyst, nurse, social worker, or psychotherapist\n(not mentioned previously)\u00adthat respondents had con-\ntacted for an emotional or psychological health problem\nduring the last 12 months. The total number of these\nevents followed a Poisson distribution. Most people\n(85.9%) had not contacted a health professional because\nof emotional or psychological problems during the past\nHealth status\nWe included both physical and mental health status in\nthe analysis. Physical health was measured by compiling\nthe answers to the question \"During the past 4 weeks\nhow much of the time have you had any of the follow-\ning problems with your work or other regular activities\nas a result of your physical health?\" Respondents could\naddress the two items\u00ad\"you have accomplished less than\nyou would like\" and \"you have accomplished your usual\nactivities less carefully\"\u00adusing responses ranging from\nall the time through never. A higher score indicates bet-\nter physical health. Our physical health indicator con-\nsists of the mean score of these two items. Scores\non both items correlate very strongly with Pearson's\n0.76 in all participating countries except Denmark,\nTable 1 Individual-level descriptive statistics.\nTotal Men Women\nN % N % N %\nMarital status\nEducation in years\nWork status\nFirst health support\nUrbanization\n(range) Mean SD Mean SD Mean SD\nwhere a correlation coefficient of 0.66 still points to a\nstrong association between both items. Mental health\nwas based on the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey\n[70], which includes both a mental health (5 items, the\nMHI-5) and an energy/vitality (4 items, the EVI scale)\ndimension. The scale used here consists of the mean of\nall nine item scores, and gives an indication of how the\nrespondents have felt and how things went during the\nlast 4 weeks, with a higher score indicating a better\nmental health status. A Cronbach's alpha of 0.89\ndemonstrates its reliability; Cronbach's alpha exceeds\n0.84 in all participating countries.\nInformation on physical health was lacking for 184\nrespondents (0.7% of the sample); while 108 respondents\n(0.4% of the sample) failed to provide answers to at least\nsix items of the mental health dimension. Full informa-\ntion on these two health status measures was available\nboth health status indicators, the overall item mean\nscores replaced missing values.\nPredisposing characteristics\nMarital status is the main independent variable in this\nstudy. In Table 1, we compared respondents who are\nwidowed (12.2%), as well as a generic category of uni-\ndentified others (0.9%) to those who are married or who\ncohabit (64.6%). The category of unidentified others\ncontains respondents who spontaneously classified\nthemselves in this rest category. It is important to note\nthat we measured the current marital status: respon-\ndents who were divorced or separated but were living\ntogether with a new partner were categorized as married\nor cohabiting.\nThe number of children (up to 15 years old), and the\nnumber of adult household members (15+) in addition\nto the spouse/partner were added. The reference group\nwas a household that had no other members besides the\nspouse/partner. The data did not allow us to distinguish\nbetween children aged 16 and over and others of com-\nparable age living in the household.\nThe number of years of education the respondents\nhad completed was subdivided into the following cate-\n(25.4%). Those who had studied 20 years or more were\nset as the reference category. Separate categories were\nadded for those still studying (3.2%) and those whose\neducational level is unknown (3.3%).\nWork status was measured on the basis of social class\nand employment status, using eight categories (see\nTable 1): managers/professionals (10.2%), white-collar\nworkers (10.7%), the self-employed (7.9%), manual work-\nstudents (3.2%), and housewives and househusbands\n(11.1%). Manual workers were set as the reference\ncategory.\nAge was measured in years and had a mean of 49.6 years\nwith a standard deviation of 17.1 years (see Table 1).\nEnabling resources\nOur measure of social support was based on the ques-\ntion \"Who would you contact for first health support?\"\nMultiple answers were possible. Two dichotomous indi-\ncators were constructed (see Table 1) indicating respon-\ndents who mentioned they would seek support from\ntheir family (49.8%), and, in a separate variable, from\nThe measure of the degree of urbanization of the\nplace of residence was based on the question \"Would\nyou say you live in a rural area or village, a small- or\nmiddle-sized town, or a large town?\" People living in a\nrural area or a village were set as the reference category.\nCountry-level characteristics\nUsing information provided by Eurostat [71], we deter-\nmined country-level divorce rates for 2005. Like other\nresearch, the current study used area provider density\nscores to measure supply-side effects [72,73].\nWe constructed an overall indicator of the supply of\nprofessional care by totaling the number of general\nand the number of psychiatric nurses or social workers\nAnalysis\nHierarchical linear models were estimated using HLM\nversion 6.0 [75]. We based our outcome variable on the\nnumber of occurrences of a relatively rare event, namely,\nconsulting a health professional. Therefore, due to the\nnature of the dependent variable, Poisson regression\nanalyses were appropriate [75]. We added an estimate of\noverdispersion, s2, to the equations to adjust for the\ndependence of the variance on the mean of the outcome\niance in the outcome is between-countries variance\nAll variables were grand mean centered. As mentioned\nabove, both population and design weights were applied.\nFirst, a baseline model was estimated, showing the\nresults of marital status and gender as well as the inter-\naction effect with gender and being divorced or sepa-\nrated (Model 1). We added random slope estimates to\naccount for between-country variation in the effects of\ndivorce on the outcome variable professional mental\nhealth care for both women and men.\nAfter need factors (Model 2), predisposing characteris-\ntics and enabling resources (Model 3) were introduced.\nIn the final model (Model 4), country characteristics\nand the various cross-level interactions between divorce\nrate and the different marital status categories were\nadded. Also, all cross-level interactions between our\nsupply of professional care indicator and the different\nmarital status categories were added in addition to the\nrandom slope estimates of all marital status categories.\nEstimations of this more elaborate model show signifi-\ncant between-country variations between all marital sta-\ntus categories and professional care use, but show no\nsignificant cross-level interaction effects with the supply\nof professional care. Therefore, a final, more parsimo-\nnious, model is estimated (Model 5) after elimination of\nthe latter cross-level interaction effects.\nThe country-level descriptive statistics are shown in\nTable 2. Information on the supply of psychiatric nurses\nor social workers in mental health settings was lacking\nin two countries, Belgium and Croatia. Therefore, the\ncountry-level supply of professional care indicator for\nthese countries was constructed after substituting overall\nmean scores for missing values. We controlled for the\npossible effects of this missing values substitution by\nadding a dichotomous indicator that identifies both\ncountries with partially missing information on the sup-\nply of professionals. The results of this analysis were\nvery close to the results reported in Tables 3 and 4:\nAll coefficients showed similar levels of significance and\nthe aforementioned indicator of missing value substitu-\nBecause of the large sample size, we set the minimum\nlevel of significance at p < 0.001 for the individual-level\neffects, and at p < 0.05 for the country-level and the\ncross-level effects.\nResults\nThe estimation of the baseline model shows that, com-\npared to the married or cohabiting, the divorced or sepa-\ncare providers more often when facing emotional or psy-\nchological health. Furthermore, women consult more\nhealth care professionals than men do (Table 3, Model 1:\noverall divorce*gender interaction effect was found con-\ncerning the use of mental health care (Table 3, Model 1:\nBgender*divorced\nrandom slope coefficients are present for all core vari-\nables (Table 3, Model 1: divorce\n=\ncountries variation in the aforementioned findings: In some\ncountries the aforementioned findings do not hold, while\nin other countries they are more pronounced.

The country-level supply of\nhealth professionals does not exert any substantial effect\non the use of professional care. In contrast, differences\nin professional care use between the divorced or sepa-\nrated and the married or cohabiting depend heavily on\nthe country-level divorce rates: In countries with high\nrates of marital dissolution, the marital status differences\nlargely disappear (Bdivorce\ngdivorcerate*divorce\nmates from the more parsimonious model (Model 5)\nconfirm these results.\nBased on Model 5, we estimated the predicted number\nof visits to health professionals for the married or\nTable 3 Determinants of professional care seeking (HLM Poisson regression): individual effects\nBaseline\nModel 2: Need\nindicators added\nModel 3: Full\nindividual level\nmodel\nModel 4: Country\nlevel and cross-\nlevel indicators\nadded\nModel 5: More\nparsimonious\nmodel (Supply\nindicator\nremoved)\nCoeff.

These esti-\nmated scores make it clear that in countries with a high\ndivorce rate the marital status gap in professional care\nuse is smaller because of not only lower care use among\nthe divorced or separated, but also because of higher\ncare use among the currently married and cohabiting.\nDiscussion\nUsing data from the Eurobarometer 248, we estimated\nmarital status differences in professional care use for\nmental health problems in a sample of 27,146 inhabi-\ntants of 29 European countries, 21 years and older. We\nfound that the divorced or separated, compared to the\nmarried or cohabiting, seek professional support more\noften irrespective of mental and physical health status,\nand irrespective of social background (education, work\nstatus) or of available informal support. Moreover, these\nmarital status differences vary from country to country.\nWe found large differences in countries with low overall\ndivorce rates, irrespective of the availability of health\nprofessionals. In countries with higher divorce rates, the\nmarital status gap largely disappears not only because\nprofessional care seeking among the divorced is lower,\nbut also because the married or cohabiting seek profes-\nsional support more frequently. Before interpreting our\nresults, some limitations should be considered.\nFirst, financial means are an important enabling\nresource in regard to professional care [32]. Overall,\nlow-income groups were found to use fewer mental\nhealth services, after controlling for mental health status\ncomparing general and specialized professional support.\nIn the present study, we were unable to consider income\ndifferences due to the limitations of the dataset used.\nThis meant that an important aspect of the explanation\nfor higher mental health care use for the divorced or\nseparated was missing, given that the divorced or sepa-\nrated\u00adespecially single parents\u00adexperience a more strin-\ngent financial situation [60-62]. Nevertheless, the\nindicators of education and work status may at least\npartially replace these income effects. Moreover, because\nwe expect mental health professional care seeking to be\nless among low-income groups, the inability to consider\nTable 4 Determinants of professional care seeking (HLM Poisson regression): country level effects and variance\ncomponents\nCoeff.

By using such a broad\nindicator, we were not able to explore marital status dif-\nferences in general vis--vis specialized professional\ncare. The low prevalence of specialized professional care\nuse in most marital status categories in the present sam-\nple indicates that in future research, larger samples are\nneeded to differentiate between categories of profes-\nsional care and to explore their interrelatedness.\nThird, we had only a very rough indicator of social\nsupport at our disposal. Respondents were simply asked\nwhether they could turn to friends and to family for\nfirst health support. However, social support is impor-\ntant to divorced or separated people for coping with\ntheir emotional and psychological problems, even prior\nto an escalation of those problems.\nFourth, we faced some limitations concerning time.\nThis analysis is based on cross-sectional data, which\nmay hinder a causal interpretation of the results. This is\nproblematic when considering the association between\n(mental) health status and professional care-seeking\nbehavior. Physical and mental health status was mea-\nsured at the time of the interview, while the use of men-\ntal health care in the 12 months preceding the interview\nwas measured retrospectively. Nevertheless, the former\nmeasurement is considered a predictor of the latter.\nLongitudinal data might help circumvent this problem,\nbut cross-national longitudinal datasets containing infor-\nmation on marital status, mental health status, and men-\ntal health professional care seeking are currently\nnonexistent. In addition, we cannot rule out that possi-\nble selection effects may account for the association\nbetween marital status and professional care seeking, as\nprevious research has indicated that at least a part of\nthe relation between divorce and mental health is due to\nprofessional care use for mental health problems are in\nline with the only longitudinal study, to our knowledge,\non this topic [9], we believe that a substantial part of\nthe differences in mental health care use is a conse-\nquence of the divorce or separation. In addition, because\nour study measured professional care use during the\n12 months preceding the interview, while the health sta-\ntus indicators referred to only the last 4 weeks, the pre-\nsent results potentially underestimate the importance of\nthe latter. It is unlikely, however, that the lack of com-\nparable time frames explains the marital status differ-\nences in professional care seeking. For instance, the\npresent indicator of mental and somatic health status is\nable to statistically explain the professional care use\namong the widowed; therefore we could expect it to be\na suitable need indicator for the divorced as well.\nFinally, due to data limitations we could only consider\ncurrent marital status. This prevents us from distin-\nguishing between past and current marital status. As a\nresult, we are unable to separate, for instance, married\npersons from married persons who were previously\ndivorced.\nDespite these limitations, our results offer at least\nthree important insights. First, in accordance with pre-\nor separated, compared to the married or cohabiting, do\nhave a higher mental health care use, and that differ-\nences between the two groups can be only partly\nexplained by differences in physical and mental health.\nOur findings are based on a representative sample of\nthe population of 29 European countries. They confirm\nthat the more frequent professional care use among the\ndivorced or separated is present in most of the partici-\npating countries, albeit to varying degrees. Mental health\nstatus has a strong impact on mental health care use\nand explains professional care seeking among the\nwidowed, and, to a substantial degree, among women.\nThe finding that need factors can explain health service\nuse among the widowed but not among the divorced\ncorroborates previous research by Prigerson et al. [9].\nThese differential effects confirm that a substantial part\nof the mental health care use for emotional or psycholo-\ngical problems among the divorced or separated relates\nto factors\u00adwhat Andersen calls \"need factors\"\u00adother\nthan somatic and mental health status. However,\nour predisposing characteristics and enabling resources,\nlike social conditions related to level of education, work\nstatus, age, and the perceived availability of support\nfrom friends and family, cannot account for this marital\nstatus effect either. Consequently, the finding that the\ndivorced or separated use mental health services more\noften than the married or cohabiting may indicate the\npower of relationship loss, bereavement, strife, or social\nimpairment as motivators for seeking treatment (see\nAdditionally, we found that cross-national differences\nin the association between marital dissolution and pro-\nfessional care use are considerable and are linked to the\naverage divorce rate in the participating countries. The\nhigher the divorce rate, the smaller the gap in profes-\nsional care use between the divorced or separated and\nthe married or cohabiting. To the best of our knowl-\nedge, this study is the first to document this cross-level\ninteraction effect. Even more fascinating is the finding\nthat the diminished marital status gap in countries with\nhigh average divorce rates results from both an\nincreased professional care use for emotional or psycho-\nlogical problems among married or unmarried couples\nand a decrease in this help-seeking behavior among the\ndivorced. Gelissen [63] found that the degree of toler-\nance towards divorce correlates with the national rate of\ndivorce. Therefore, the normalization of divorce [64]\nmay account for less professional care seeking after mar-\nital dissolution in countries with high divorce rates. In\nthese countries, divorce is probably less stigmatizing, or\nis seen as less intrinsically problematic, leading to a net\ndecline in professional care seeking. A post hoc inter-\npretation of the increase in professional care seeking\namong the married or cohabiting may be that in coun-\ntries with high divorce rates changes in the meaning of\nhigher propensity among couples to proactively contact\nprofessional care providers for marriage and relationship\ncounseling and to less reliance on professional support\nin the aftermath of a marriage breakup. In societies with\nhigh divorce rates, a divorce culture gives way to a ther-\napeutic culture [67] in which the married also rely on\nmental health professionals for counseling more fre-\nquently. It is, in part, because of these opposing effects\nof the national divorce rates on the professional care\nseeking of the divorced or separated versus the married\nor cohabiting that we do not find overall effects of the\nnational rates of divorce on the mental health profes-\nsional support-seeking rate. Because our analyses\nare based on a comparison of current marital status\ncategories, we cannot determine whether this finding\nresults from the impact of remarriage after divorce. It is\nstill possible that the increase of professional care seek-\ning among the married in countries with high divorce\nrates is confined to those who remarried after divorce.\nAnalyses of cross-national datasets containing detailed\ninformation about marital status transitions are needed\nto solve this problem.\nFinally, gender and work status prove to be important\ndeterminants for mental health care use, while age and\neducation do not seem to matter. In line with earlier\nstudies, we found that women use more mental health\ncare than men do. In line with the findings of Koop-\nmans and Lamers [26], although contrary to other\nresearch [68], we also found that in most countries this\nhigher mental health care use among women can be\ncompletely attributed to self-reported poor mental and\nphysical health. Our hypothesis that the gap in mental\nhealth care use between the divorced and married\nwould be greater for women than for men could not\nbe confirmed. Nevertheless, a significant amount of\nbetween-country variation in the gendered effect of mar-\nital status on professional care seeking was present, sug-\ngesting that in some countries divorce leads to increased\nprofessional care seeking among women, while in other\ncountries a reversed gender difference can be observed.\nWe did not find any effects from education, presence of\nchildren in the household, or social support. These\nresults contrast with what we might expect to find\neffect for the presence of children, however, it is possi-\nble that two opposite forces are at work: A negative\n\"burden\" effect of the presence of children in the house-\nhold [21,22] may be neutralized by a more positive\neffect that comes from the support children may give to\ntheir parents [16-18]. Not having custody of one's chil-\ndren can be a significant stress factor as well and thus a\nreason to seek professional care. This is especially rele-\nvant for divorced fathers, who often experience signifi-\ncantly decreased contact with their children. Within the\ndivorced group, more detailed analyses are needed to\nrefine these diverging effects. Social support, measured\nas first health support, does not have a strong influence\non the consumption of different health care providers.\nWe find a significant but less substantial effect of the\navailability of friends as first health supporters, suggest-\ning that the availability of support from laypersons actu-\nally enhances professional care consumption. Friends\nhelp a person gain insight into personal and emotional\nproblems and stimulate a person to seek professional\nConclusions\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first compre-\nhensive study of a large European sample that focuses\non the differences in mental health service use between\nthe divorced or separated and the married or cohabiting\nand that considers both individual and country charac-\nteristics. The present study has shown that the higher\nhealth care use for emotional or psychological problems\nby the divorced and separated is only partly explained\nby worse mental and physical health. In addition, our\nresearch clearly shows that it is important to consider\ndifferences at the country level when studying marital\nstatus differences in professional care use: In countries\nwith a high national divorce rate, the gap between the\nmarried or cohabiting and the divorced or separated\nregarding use of professional mental health care\ndiminishes dramatically. Married and unmarried couples\nare more frequent user of mental health professional\nsupport, while the consumption of professional care\namong the divorced or separated is lower than in coun-\ntries where divorce occurs less frequently.\nIn sum, we have reason to assume that in countries\nwith high divorce rates, those seeking professional sup-\nport for mental health problems are more proactive,\nwhile in countries where divorce is less common, the\ndivorced seek professional support to cope with the det-\nrimental consequences of marital dissolution.\nAuthors' contributions\nPB was responsible for general coordination, participated in the statistical\nanalysis, supervised the drafting of the manuscript, and finalized the\nmanuscript.
