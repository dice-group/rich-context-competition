However, it is often neglected that there are\nmany more dimensions along which the multinational corporation can structure its activities\ninternationally, and that decisions related to production and trade are only part of the story.\nFrom a taxation perspective, the fact that those corporations hold affiliates in different\ncountries opens up many opportunities for tax planning with the aim to minimize their\noverall tax burden. This might be quite important for the tax revenue from corporation\ntaxes and, furthermore, may significantly alter the way taxes affect location and investment\ndecisions and the business sector as a whole.\nAs is well noted in the literature (e.g., Hines and Rice, 1994, Gresik, 2001), a multinational\ncorporation has several ways to engage in tax planning other than choosing location and\nlevel of investment. One important determinant of the tax burden is the transfer price\nfor goods and services traded within the corporation (for a theoretical discussion see e.g.,\nHaufler and Schjelderup, 2000; for empirical evidence see e.g., Swenson, 2001, Clausing,\n2003). Apart from transfer pricing, multinationals have enhanced opportunities with respect\nto tax planning as they can use external as well as internal funds in order to adjust their\ncapital structure. This allows multinationals not only to arbitrage more easily across different\nlending markets. It also opens up opportunities for tax planning by means of intercompany\nloans. Borrowing from affiliates located in low-tax countries and lending to affiliates in high-\ntax locations will allow the latter to deduct interest payments from profits and save taxes\nWhile several papers document some significant degree of profit shifting of multinationals\n(e.g., Grubert and Mutti, 1991, or Hines and Rice, 1994), the empirical literature so far does\nnot provide conclusive evidence that intercompany loans actually play an important role in\nthis respect. Several papers show that the leverage of multinationals' affiliates is sensitive to\nthe tax rate in the host country (e.g., Jog and Tang, 2001, Mintz and Smart, 2004). However,\nthe tax shelter from debt gives rise to a tax-rate sensitivity of the leverage of any corporation,\nincluding multinationals' affiliates as well as domestic corporations. For instance, Gordon\nand Lee (2001) find a strong tax sensitivity of the leverage of US corporations.\nOnly some recent papers explicitly consider intercompany loans. Desai, Foley, and Hines\n(2004a) analyze the capital structure of US multinationals and report a significant tax sen-\nsitivity of both external and internal debt. Mintz and Weichenrieder (2005) and Buettner\net al. (2006) confirm their findings for German multinationals. As the main result of Desai\net al. is that internal debt serves as a substitute to external debt, it is, however, not clear\nwhether the tax sensitivity of intercompany loans reflects profit shifting or the standard tax\nshelter from debt. In fact, as shown by Mintz and Smart (2004), profit shifting by means of\nintercompany loans should not be sensitive to the local tax rate but to the tax-rate difference\nbetween the lending and the borrowing affiliate within the multinational group.\nThis paper, therefore, studies how those tax-rate differences within the multinational group\naffect the capital structure of multinationals and, in particular, the use of intercompany\nloans. For this purpose we use a large micro-level panel database of virtually all German\nmultinationals made available for research by the German Bundesbank. This comprehensive\ndataset allows us to exploit tax-rate differences in 79 countries, among those many low-tax\nor tax-haven countries. For each affiliate within the multinational group the appropriate\ntax-rate difference is calculated relative to the lowest tax rate observed among all affiliates.\nThe empirical results strongly support a significant impact of this tax-rate differential on\nintercompany loans, implying that intercompany loans are indeed used to shift profits from\nhigh- to low-tax countries. However, the implied tax revenue effects are rather small. This\nfinding is indicative for substantial costs of adjusting the capital structure for profit-shifting\npurposes.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we model a corporation which is active at\ndifferent locations, including low-tax countries. The corporation is assumed to maximize\nprofits by optimally allocating internal funds with respect to differences in international\ntaxation. From the optimality conditions we obtain testable empirical implications, which\nare discussed in Section 3. Section 4 gives a short description of the dataset and discusses\nthe investigation approach. Section 5 provides descriptive statistics. The basic results are\npresented in Section 6. Some further evidence showing how the results change with the share\nof ownership is presented in Section 7. Section 8 provides our conclusion.\n2 Theoretical Considerations\nConsider a multinational group with affiliates at N locations. For simplicity, let us assume\nthat each location is situated in a different country such that the tax system varies between\nlocations. The profit function of the group is given by\n =\nN\nf (ki\n)\n-\nN\nN\n[ij\nji\nki\n)\n-\nN\nN\n[ij\n\u00b5ji\nki\n) +\nN\nN\n[ij\n\u00b5ji\nki\n)\n- r\nN\nj\nji\nki\n-\nN\nci\n, ..., ji\n, ..., N,i\n, ..., \u00b5ji\n, ..., \u00b5Ni\n) ki\n, with \u00b5ii\nLet us briefly discuss the components of this profit function. The first line captures the\ncontribution of output, f(ki\n), taking account of the fact that a part of the corresponding\nprofit is taxed away. The host country statutory tax rate is denoted with i\n. The second\nline shows the interest costs which, similarly, enter profits only after tax deduction. ij\nis\nthe corresponding lending rate at location j. Note that this term captures also the interest\ncosts related to intercompany loans, provided the corporation raises a credit at country j\nand transfers the money to the affiliate in country i such that ji\n> 0. The third line is\nalso concerned with intercompany loans but reports the contribution of pure profit shifting\nwhere some financial capital is shifted from one location to the other, without increasing\noutside debt. The fourth line reports the cost of capital financed with equity. The fifth line,\nfinally, captures cost of borrowing in addition to the market lending rate which are assumed\nto increase with the various types of debt in the model.2,3 Note that the general specification\nused here assumes that the additional cost of borrowing of affiliate i are increasing not only\nin the share of capital financed with external debt ji\n. In fact, the analysis follows Mintz\nand Smart (2004) and assumes that the additional cost of borrowing will also increase in the\nshare financed with internal debt \u00b5ji\nas this also implies a decline in the equity share of the\nlending affiliate. Note that the cost function is indexed with the host country to reflect the\npotential role of this country's credit-market regulations for the underlying conflict between\ndebtors and creditors.4\n2The additional cost of borrowing function is assumed to be convex. More specifically, we assume\nci\nji\n\u00b5ji\nji\nji\n3The corporate finance literature (see Tirole, 2006, for an overview) justifies the existence of those addi-\ntional cost of debt on several grounds. A first set of arguments refers to the possible cost of financial distress\nincluding bankruptcy as well as agency costs related to the conflict between debtors and creditors (e.g.,\nthe role of agency costs between shareholders and management. From this perspective, some debt might be\nuseful to ensure control rights of investors in bad states, for instance, if a firm goes bankrupt. But, since\nequity allows the manager to control the corporation in good states, a tax-induced increase in the debt-asset\nratio relative to the optimal level would imply an inefficiency which contributes to the additional cost of\nborrowing.\n4Note that increasing additional cost of intercompany loans would also arise if the host country imposes\nrestrictions on the use of intercompany loans for profit shifting (see below).\nThe optimality conditions are\n\nji\n= -ij\n) ki\n+ rki\n-\nci\nji\nki\n!\n\n\u00b5ji\n= -ij\n) ki\n+ ij\n) ki\n-\nci\n\u00b5ji\nki\n!\nIn the general case, the loan from affiliate j to affiliate i financed with a credit from country\nj is, among other determinants, a function of the corresponding after-tax rate of interest\nji\n= gi\n( r - ij\n) , ... ) with\ngi\nij\n)\nThe loan from affiliate j to affiliate i financed with equity depends on the tax-rate difference\n\u00b5ji\n= hi\n( ij\n(i\n- j\n) , ... ) with\nhi\nij\n(i\n- j\n)\nIf we impose somewhat more structure on the analysis, we can generate more specific pre-\ndictions:\nA restrictive case is provided by Buettner et al. (2006), who are concerned with the leverage\nof a single foreign affiliate held by a German parent. In this case, the fact that Germany is\na high-tax country makes it rather unlikely to observe a positive tax-rate differential that\ngives an incentive to shift profits from foreign affiliates into Germany. Thus, with tj\n> ti\n, \u00b5ji\nis zero, and all intercompany loans from j to i reflect external debt for the lending affiliate.\nTherefore, in this case, the leverage is determined by the corresponding after-tax cost of\ninterest according to Equation 1.\nMintz and Smart (2004) consider another case where all intercompany loans relate to profit\nshifting. In our approach this case is obtained if r < ij\n) and, hence, ji\nis zero. In\nthis case, the leverage is determined by the tax-rate difference between the affiliates located\nin i and j evaluated with the lending rate.\nFor our purposes let us consider a slightly more general case with a simplified cost function\nwhere we aggregate among different kinds of loans. If we assume that loans of the same kind\nare perfect substitutes the cost function can be written as\nci\n= ci\nii\n,\nj=i\nji\n,\nj=i\n\u00b5ji\nThis cost function distinguishes three kinds of debt. As a consequence, the first-order condi-\ntions for all intercompany loans of the same kind involve the same marginal cost. If interest\nrates differ, this implies that the leverage related to intercompany loans refinanced with\nexternal capital\nj=i\nji\n, is determined by the local tax rate and the lowest lending rate\namong all locations\nji\n> 0, where j = arg min\nk\nik\n, and zero otherwise. (4)\nWith this condition, ji\nfollows from Equation 1. In contrast, the other kind of intercompany\nloans\nj=i\n\u00b5ji\n, which are not refinanced externally, is determined by the largest tax-rate\ndifference evaluated at the lending rate\n\u00b5ji\n> 0, where j = arg max\nk\nik\n(i\n- k\n) , and zero otherwise. (5)\nWith this condition, the optimal level of \u00b5ji\nis determined by Equation 2.\n3 Empirical Implications\nThe analysis below aims at testing the empirical implications of the above model. Basically,\nour analysis is concerned with the implications of the first-order conditions and considers\nthe empirical determinants of the debt-asset ratio where we focus on intercompany loans.\nThe debt-asset ratio Li\nof each affiliate i consists of three components\nLi\n ii\n+\nj=i\nji\n+\nj=i\n\u00b5ji\nwhere the first component is the amount of debt directly raised from external creditors, the\nsecond and third components together make up the amount of intercompany loans (ICLi\n).\nThe theory distinguishes intercompany loans re-financed with external credit, which are used\nto arbitrage across capital markets (ji\n), from loans not externally re-financed (\u00b5ji\n), which\nare used to shift profits. However, this distinction is generally not observable empirically.\nInstead, balance-sheet data, like those used in the current study, usually provide some figures\nfor Li\nand ICLi\n.\nAbstracting from possible differences in the lending rate, the optimality conditions for ij\nand \u00b5ij\nsuggest that the share of capital of an affiliate financed with intercompany loans\nshould not only be affected by the local tax rate but also by a positive tax-rate differential\nwith regard to other locations where the multinational holds affiliates.5 As we have seen\nabove, the empirical implications of the theory depend on the function for the additional\ncost of borrowing. Assuming that this cost function follows (3) such that intercompany loans\nof the same kind but from different locations are perfect substitutes, the share of capital of\nan affiliate i held by corporation k financed with intercompany loans ICLi,k\nshould be a\nfunction of the local tax rate i\nand the maximal tax-rate difference (i\n- min\nk\n) with regard\nto all other affiliates in the multinational group (min\nk\nis the lowest local tax rate among all\naffiliates of the group as implied by Equation 5). In other words, the theory suggests not only\n5We abstract from differences in the lending rate since our basic database does not provide corresponding\ninformation and external data sources are not available for the large number of countries involved. In our\nempirical analysis, however, we control for differences in the lending rate driven by country characteristics\nsuch as country risk, creditor rights, and the size of the credit market by including country fixed effects.\nFirm specific differences in the lending rate are controlled by variables such as the turnover and by company-\nand group-specific fixed effects.\nto take account of the local tax rate faced by an affiliate in order to capture the traditional\ntax shelter of debt finance. Instead, we should also take account of the tax-rate difference\nto the lowest tax rate among all affiliates of a multinational group as this determines the\npotential tax savings from profit shifting.\n4 Data and Investigation Approach\nA basic problem in the empirical analysis of the tax effects on corporate decisions is to\nformulate an approach with sufficient empirical variation in the incentives generated by\nthe tax system. In the current study we utilize a micro-level panel dataset of German\nmultinationals which offers substantial variation in three dimensions:\n1. A first dimension relates to the international perspective, as the dataset reports the\ncapital structure of each of the foreign affiliates of a multinational that operates in\nvarious countries. While the database considers the multinational's activities globally,\nthe empirical analysis is based on a sample of 79 countries for which reliable information\nwith regard to corporate income taxation is available.\n2. Another dimension that offers variation in the taxing conditions is the time dimension.\nThe panel data covers each multinational's activities as well as the taxing conditions\n3. The third dimension is related to the heterogeneity of the affiliates that vary in the tax-\nrate difference relative to the lowest level of the tax rate observed among all affiliates\nin the group. Note that this type of variation refers to each individual affiliate in the\ndataset.\nIn order to test the empirical implications as outlined in the previous section, we employ a\nmicro-level dataset for German multinationals (MiDi) provided by the Bundesbank. This\ncontains a comprehensive annual database of foreign direct investment positions of German\nenterprizes held abroad. The data provides information about each foreign affiliate's balance\nsheet and some further information about the ownership and about the German investor. In\nits current version, firm-level panel data for foreign affiliates are available for the period 1996\nto 2004.6 Each German multinational has to report its foreign assets, including both directly\nand indirectly held FDI, conditional on some lower threshold level for mandatory reporting.7\nBasically, the estimation sample comprises balance-sheet information of virtually all German\noutbound investments from 1996 to 2004, regardless of the legal form, of whether directly\nor indirectly held, and of whether subsidiaries are wholly or only partly owned. While\nthe dataset reports the capital share of intercompany loans received by foreign affiliates,\ncomparable information is not available for the German parent. As a consequence, the focus\nof our study is on the capital structure of foreign affiliates.\nWith regard to the lending part of intercompany loans, the dataset distinguishes intercom-\npany loans received from the parent as well as intercompany loans received from other foreign\naffiliates.8 This allows us to restrict the focus of the empirical analysis even more closely\n6Data collection is enforced by German law, which determines reporting mandates for international\ntransactions as part of the Law on Foreign Trade and Payments and corresponding regulations.\n7Since 2002 FDI has to be reported if the participation is 10% or more and the balance-sheet total of the\nforeign object is above 3 million euro. For details see Lipponer (2006). Though previous years showed lower\nthreshold levels, we apply this threshold level uniformly for all years in the panel.\n8The corresponding position is \"...liabilities to affiliated enterprizes ... outside of Germany\" (see Lipponer,\nto intercompany loans granted as well as received by foreign affiliates, since, as Germany is\na high-tax country, there is little reason to expect German parents to issue intercompany\nloans to their foreign affiliates for profit-shifting purposes.\nFigure 1 provides a graphical illustration of the focus of the analysis by depicting a multina-\ntional corporation with two foreign affiliates, where the parent as well as one of the affiliates\nare located in high-tax countries but a third affiliate is located in a low-tax country.9 In\nthis setting, intercompany loans granted by the foreign affiliate in the low-tax country might\nbe used to shift profits into this country. While this might involve loans to the parent as\nwell as to the foreign affiliate in the high-tax country, as discussed above, the focus of the\ncurrent paper is only on the latter relationship, depicted by the vertical arrows in the figure.\nAs a consequence, the empirical analysis is concerned with multinational corporations with\naffiliates in more than one foreign country \u00ad binational corporations are excluded.\nAs we focus on intercompany loans granted as well as received by foreign affiliates, we\nimplicitly assume that the taxing conditions for these foreign affiliates are decisive for the\ncompany group. This might be questioned in a context where the parent company would\nhave to pay taxes on worldwide profits, as in a regime of foreign tax credit. However,\nnote that for German multinationals as well as for most other European multinationals\nthe exemption principle applies. This could be different in the U.S. case, where foreign\nearnings are taxed subject to a foreign tax credit. However, recent literature argues that the\nanti-abuse controlled foreign corporation (CFC) provisions are not effective (e.g., Mutti and\nGrubert, 2006). Thus, tax planning of U.S. corporations might be similar.\nSince taxing conditions vary in more than one dimension, we can further exploit the micro-\nlevel structure of the dataset and explore the capital structure of multinationals using panel-\ndata techniques. Following our discussion of the empirical implications, the analysis is based\n9The company structure can be, of course, much more complicated in the data. On average, we observe\nabout five foreign subsidiaries per multinational in our basic estimation sample.\nFigure 1: Intercompany Loans in a Stylized Multinational

The dependent variable, ICL, is defined by the amount of\nintercompany loans received by a foreign affiliate i from other foreign affiliates within the\nmultinational group k divided by total capital.\nNote that the basic specification includes time effects, t\n, possibly capturing differences in\nthe treatment of foreign earnings in the home country (Germany) of the multinational and\nother aggregate shocks. The specification also takes account of a specific effect for each multi-\nnational group, k\n. This is important in the current context since group-specific risk would\naffect the lending rate and the additional cost of borrowing (Desai, Foley, and Hines, 2004a).\nUsing group-specific fixed effects also allows us to condition on the international structure\nof each group. This is important since we exploit the differences in the group structure in\norder to identify tax incentives but do not model the choice of the group structure. We\nalso employ affiliate-specific control variables, xk,i,t\n, which capture some heterogeneity in the\nborrowing costs across affiliates. Borrowing costs might also be related to country-specific\nconditions in the lending market such as bankruptcy laws, creditor rights, etc. This would\nsuggest to further include country-specific effects. Finally, since borrowing costs may also\nvary with the branch of the affiliate, sector-specific effects could also be included.\n5 Descriptive Statistics\nTable 1 provides some information about the basic characteristics of the sample of multi-\nnationals. Three different samples are distinguished: the full sample comprises all foreign-\ndirect-investment observations available. A reduced sample excludes all binational corpora-\ntions, where a structure as in Figure 1 cannot be observed, obviously, and considers only\naffiliates where information about the local tax rate is available. Whereas we use information\nfrom the second sample in order to compute the lowest tax rate within the group, the third\nis the ultimate estimation sample where some further restrictions apply (see below).\nThe last two columns report the capital of all considered affiliates where a significant share\nis held by the reporting multinational. Comparing the aggregate stock of capital in the first\nand second sample, we see that, even if many countries are excluded, still between 80% and\n90% of all reported capital is covered by the second sample. This is different with the third\nsample, which is the basic sample for the regression analysis below. This sample further\nexcludes affiliates with zero turnover. While this restriction implies a considerable decline\nin the number of observations, the reason is to focus on the capital structure of productive\naffiliates as in the above theoretical model.10\n10Note, however, that our estimation results proved to be robust against the inclusion of affiliates with\nTable 1: Sample Characteristics\nSample Obs. Countries Capital (in bn. e) Share\n2 if tax data available &\nCapital consists of registered capital, capital reserves, profit reserves, as well as internal and external\ndebt. The total capital figure is an unweighted annual average for the period from 1996 to 2004. Sam-\nple 1 comprises all foreign direct investment observations (outbound investment), Sample 2 employs\nall affiliates where corporate tax rate information is available and excludes binational corporations,\nSample 3 further excludes all observations with zero turnover.\nAs has been discussed above, we employ affiliate- and group-specific indicators of the tax\nincentives for profit shifting. More specifically, we proceed in two steps. First, we determine\nfor each multinational the lowest corporate income-tax rate observed among all of its foreign\naffiliates based on Sample 2. (For ease of exposition we will refer to the corresponding\naffiliate as the lowest-tax affiliate.) In a second step, we use this group-specific minimum tax\nrate as the benchmark for the group and compute the tax-rate differential of the local tax\nrate to this benchmark for each of the affiliates. As a consequence, high-tax affiliates will\nshow large positive tax-rate differentials, whereas the tax-rate differential for the lowest-tax\naffiliate is zero.\nLet us emphasize once more that the tax-rate differential with regard to the lowest-tax affili-\nate is not determined on basis of the estimation sample but on basis of the more comprehen-\nsive Sample 2 of Table 1. In other words, while we focus on the finances of the productive\nentities of multinational corporations, we take into account in a much more comprehen-\nsive way the incentives for profit shifting and include the incentives for using intercompany\nloans in order to shift profits to foreign affiliates, including purely non-productive tax-haven\nzero turnover.\naffiliates.\nTable 2 provides some information about which countries typically host the lowest-tax affil-\niates. The second column lists the number of all affiliates reported in each of the countries.\nThe third column, denoted with  = 0, lists all observations where the respective country\nhosts the lowest-tax affiliate. While we see that most affiliates are reported in the U.S., in\nthe U.K., and in France, the lowest-tax affiliate is quite often found in Switzerland, Hungary,\nPoland, and Austria.\nTable 3 displays descriptive statistics for variables used in the empirical analysis. While the\ntax-rate variable is measured at the level of the country, all other variables including the\ntax-rate differential vary by affiliate. A first impression of the relative importance of debt as\na means of profit shifting as compared to the standard tax shelter from debt is given by the\nthree different borrowing variables. While the total leverage is almost 60%, intercompany\nloans make up only a capital share of 24.2%. This figure still includes intercompany loans\nfrom the German parent to foreign affiliates which, given Germany's high tax rate, is quite\nunlikely related to profit shifting. Intercompany loans received from other foreign affiliates\namount only to an average capital share of 10.6%.\nTable 4 provides further descriptive evidence for the impact of taxes on intercompany loans.\nIt displays the share of capital financed with different kinds of debt for the basic sample\nas well as for various sub-samples. For ease of comparison, column (1) repeats the mean\nvalues as reported above. Columns (2) and (3) report the share of intercompany loans\nobserved among the affiliates of those multinational corporations which hold at least one\naffiliate in a low-tax country. Column (2) defines the low-tax country as a country with\na tax rate below the 10% percentile of the tax-rate distribution, column (3) uses the even\nstricter definition based on the 5% percentile of the tax-rate distribution. If corporations\nuse intercompany loans for profit shifting, we should expect the mean to be higher for those\nmultinational corporations. In fact, the capital share of intercompany loans (excluding those\nobtained from the German parent) is higher by about 30 to 40%, indicating that the use of\nTable 2: Geographical Distribution of Affiliates\nCountry obs.  = 0  Country obs.  = 0 \nobs.: total number of affiliates (pooled in the period from 1996 until 2004);  = 0: number of affiliates\nwith a tax-rate difference equal to zero, i.e number of observations identified as low-tax affiliates; : average\nhost country statutory tax rate.\nTable 3: Descriptive Statistics\nVariable Mean Std.

Conversely, the affiliate experiencing the lowest tax rate within the group should\ndisplay a much lower capital share of intercompany loans. As reported in column (4), the\nmean capital share for those affiliates is lower by about 25%. This confirms the theoretical\nview, as there should be little incentive to shift profits out of those countries.\n6 Basic Results\nTable 5 reports basic regression results following Equation 7. In order to control for group-\nspecific risks, all estimations employ fixed effects for the company group. Moreover, time\ndummies are included in order to capture differences in the taxation of the parent. Given\nthe limited information in the balance sheet of the affiliates, only two direct control variables\nare included. Since the effective tax reduction from using debt might be zero if an affiliate\ncarries forward any losses for tax purposes (see MacKie-Mason, 1990), we include a variable\nindicating whether some loss carry-forward is reported. Some specifications will also include\nthe turnover of the affiliate, since a larger cash-flow might be associated with less credit-\nmarket constraints and, hence, might facilitate access to external credits.\nThroughout the different specifications, the tax-rate differential shows a significantly positive\neffect, whereas the host-country tax rate proves insignificant. This confirms the theoretical\nprediction in the sense that corporations use intercompany loans to shift profits. At the\nsame time, the insignificance of the tax rate indicates that the intercompany loans between\nforeign affiliates do not play an important role in minimizing the cost of capital by engaging\nin arbitrage across lending conditions of affiliate locations. Given the magnitude of this\nother type of intercompany loans, this function might well be carried out by loans from the\nGerman parent (cf. Table 3).\nQualitatively, there is not much difference between specifications. Column (4) includes a\nTable 5: Basic Results\nIndustry effects no no no no no yes yes yes yes\nHost-country effects no no no no no no no yes yes\nDependent variable: share of internal debt related to loans from other, non-German affiliates.

All estimates include a\nfull set of group-level and time fixed effects.\ncontrol for a loss-carry forward as the incentive to save taxes is reduced in this case. The\npositive sign possibly reflects the desire of shareholders to get more control of an affiliate's\nmanagement if the performance is weak. It might also simply reflect the substitutive rela-\ntionship to external debt (Desai et al., 2004a). This could also explain the negative sign for\nturnover which is taken into account in column (5). The specifications in columns (6) to (9)\nadditionally employ industry-level dummies following a classification of affiliates according\nto 71 industries. This might help to further control for differences in the financial risk related\nto an affiliate's activities. Columns (8) and (9), finally, use controls for the host country in\norder to make sure that no country-specific characteristics are driving the results. While the\nresults prove to be robust, some part of the variation is swallowed up by the country-specific\ndummies. Hence, we would consider column (7) of Table 5 as the preferred specification.\nSince in many cases the amount of intercompany loans received by an affiliate is zero, Table 6\nreports results where those observations are excluded. However, the results show only minor\ndifferences.\nQuantitatively, we see from the preferred specification (7) of Table 5 that a ten percent-\nage point increase in the tax-rate difference to the group-specific lowest-tax affiliate leads\nto an approximately 0.68 percentage point higher internal-debt ratio. Expressed as a semi-\nelasticity, a tax-rate difference by ten percentage points triggers a response in the correspond-\ning capital share by 6.4 percent. This figure is not much different from existing estimates\nof the tax-rate sensitivity of debt. Corresponding calculations based on the estimates by\nDesai et al. (2004a) yield a semi-elasticity of 10.2% (5.5%) for the sensitivity of an affiliate's\ncapital share of internal (external) debt. The findings of Buettner et al. (2006) suggest a\ncorresponding semi-elasticity of 6.2% (5.1%).\nIn order to get an impression of the magnitude of the effect on the tax base, consider the\ncase of an affiliate i with a stock of capital of $1 million. Suppose (pre-tax) profits are\n$200,000. From the mean value of the leverage we would expect the affiliate to receive an\nintercompany loan of about $106,000. Furthermore, let us assume a lending rate of 20%.\nTable 6: Results for Non-Zero Observations\nIndustry effects no no yes yes yes yes\nHost-country effects no no no no yes yes\nDependent variable: share of internal debt related to loans from other, non-German affiliates.

All estimates include a full set of group-level and time fixed\neffects.\nDeduction of interest costs reduces the tax base by $21,200, or 10.6%. Suppose now that the\ncorporation opens up a tax-haven affiliate j, where the corporation tax equals zero. Then,\nassuming affiliate i's previous tax-rate difference is equal to the sample mean (12.4%) and\nthe statutory tax rate in country i is also equal to the mean (33.4%), the tax-rate difference\nincreases by 21 percentage points (33.4%\u00ad12.4%). Our estimate suggests that in this case the\nthe affiliate i's tax base further declines by $2,856, or 1.6%.\nConsider another example, where we observe a tax reform in the host country of affiliate i.\nLet us assume that the tax rate declines by ten percentage points and, thus, that also the\ntax-rate differential declines by ten percentage points. Then, the intercompany loan would\n7 Results for Different Shares of Ownership\nThe rather small revenue effects might indicate that there are some important costs or re-\nstrictions which prevent corporations from using profit-shifting loans more aggressively. For\ninstance, host countries might enact specific policies which restrict the use of intercompany\nloans. However, it is difficult to quantify the role of those restrictions. In fact, it proved\nimpossible to augment the current analysis based on almost 80 countries with informa-\ntion about the existence and nature of corresponding rules such as thin-capitalization or\nearnings-stripping rules. But, there might be other reasons why firms experience high costs\nin adjusting the capital structure. While additional costs of using intercompany loans are\nbasically not observed in the dataset, some of their potential determinants are. Desai et.al\n(2004b) argue that shared ownership of foreign affiliates is associated with coordination costs\nwhich impede tax efficient structuring of worldwide operations. This view is supported by\nMintz and Weichenrieder (2006) who find a higher tax-rate sensitivity of intercompany loans\nfor wholly-owned subsidiaries. In terms of the above theoretical framework, this could imply\nthat the additional costs related to intercompany loans are lower and exhibit a smaller gra-\ndient when the ownership share is higher. Thus, we might expect to find that intercompany\nloans are used more if the ownership share is higher. We might also expect to find that\nthe sensitivity of intercompany loans to the tax-rate differential with regard to the lowest-\ntax affiliate is increased when taking into account only majority holdings or wholly-owned\nsubsidiaries.\nIn order to test for differences in the sensitivity of intercompany loans to profit-shifting op-\nportunities captured by the tax-rate differential, we augment the above estimation approach\n(7) by interaction terms with dummies capturing the ownership share.11\nTable 7 shows results for our basic sample. For ease of comparison, the first column re-\npeats the basic result as displayed in column (7) of Table 5. Column (2) reports results\nwhere we augment the basic approach with dummy variables for the ownership share. Both\ndummy variables are highly significant, pointing at an increased use of intercompany loans\nby majority- and wholly-owned subsidiaries. Note that the definition of majority-owned\nsubsidiaries does not include wholly-owned subsidiaries. Thus, the results indicate that\nwholly-owned (partly-owned) subsidiaries show an about 5 (2) percentage points higher cap-\nital share of intercompany loans than affiliates without a majority participation.\nColumn (3) reports results where also the tax-rate differential is interacted with the two\ndummy variables for the ownership share. The results support significant differences in the\ntax-rate sensitivity. While the sensitivity with regard to the tax-rate differential shows a\nnegative effect for minority participation, a positive effect is supported for majority-owned\nsubsidiaries. The tax rate sensitivity for wholly-owned subsidiaries, however, is substantially\nhigher. Adding up coefficients we find that the coefficient of the tax-rate differential is about\n11Dummies are preferred against a continuous interaction term for the ownership share since the dis-\ntribution of the ownership share shows strong concentration at the 51% and 100% thresholds. However,\nqualitatively, the results of corresponding estimates show no differences.\nTable 7: Intercompany Loans and Ownership\nIndustry effects yes yes yes yes yes\nHost-country effects no no no no yes\nDependent variable: share of internal debt related to loans from other, non-German affiliates.

This indicates that a ten percentage point increase in\nthe tax-rate difference with regard to the lowest-tax affiliate leads to an approximately 1\npercentage point higher internal-debt ratio. Expressed as a semi-elasticity evaluated at the\nmean capital share for wholly-owned subsidiaries (0.120), a tax-rate change by ten percentage\npoints triggers a response in the corresponding debt ratio by about 8.7 percent.\nFrom the theoretical discussion we know, however, that the additional cost function may\naffect not only the sensitivity with regard to the tax-rate differential but also the sensitivity\nwith regard to all other indicators of the relative cost of equity and intercompany loans.\nTherefore, columns (4) and (5) report results where the other determinants are interacted\nwith the ownership-share dummy variables as well. However, some of these interaction terms\nare insignificant and the results on the sensitivity with regard to the tax-rate differential prove\nto be robust.\nIn order to get an impression of how much the magnitude of the effect on the tax base is\nincreased with wholly-owned subsidiaries, let us again consider a case of a subsidiary with\na stock of capital of $1 million. From the mean leverage for wholly-owned corporations, we\nwould expect such a subsidiary to receive an intercompany loan of about $120,000. At a\nSuppose now that the tax rate, and, therefore, the tax-rate difference, is decreased by 10\npercentage points. Our preferred estimate of column (3) suggests that, in this case, the\ntax base in the high-tax country would increase by $2,080, or 1.2 %. Although this is a\nstronger effect than the one obtained for the whole sample, it still appears to be rather\nsmall.\n8 Conclusion\nWe have set up a model of a multinational corporation which uses intercompany loans for\ntwo purposes. The first is to minimize cost of capital by making use of external credit and\nengaging in arbitrage across affiliate locations. The second is to shift profits to low-tax ju-\nrisdictions. The theoretical analysis shows that the first purpose suggests that the use of\nintercompany loans will be affected by the local tax rate. The second purpose, however,\ncauses intercompany loans to depend on the tax-rate differences between the lending and\nthe borrowing companies within the multinational group. Only this latter relationship is\nindicative of profit shifting. Therefore, existing empirical evidence on the tax-rate sensi-\ntivity of debt even if related to multinationals and intercompany loans does not reveal the\nimportance of profit-shifting activities.\nOur empirical investigation studies whether the tax-rate differences within a multinational\ngroup will help to predict intercompany loans. The analysis makes use of a large micro-\nlevel panel dataset of virtually all German multinationals made available for research by\nthe Bundesbank. This comprehensive dataset allows us to exploit differences in the taxing\nconditions in 79 countries, including many low-tax countries, in a period of nine years. For\neach affiliate within the multinational group, we calculate the appropriate tax-rate difference\nrelative to the lowest tax rate observed among all foreign affiliates.\nThe empirical results confirm a robust significant impact of tax-rate differences within the\nmultinational group on the use of intercompany loans, supporting the profit-shifting hypoth-\nesis. Nevertheless, our findings suggest that the implied magnitude of tax-revenue losses\nis rather modest even for wholly-owned firms. To conclude, our findings are indicative for\nsubstantial costs of adjusting the capital structure for means of profit shifting. As a conse-\nquence, if profit-shifting is important as the literature suggests, multinationals seem to take\nresort to alternative strategies of tax-planning. This would imply that further restrictions\nimposed by tax policy on the capital structure of multinationals would not substantially\ncurb profit-shifting.\nDatasources and Definitions\nFirm-level data are taken from the micro-level dataset of the Bundesbank, see Lipponer\n(2006) for an overview. The dependent variable, ICL, is determined by a balance-sheet\nposition capturing liabilities of foreign affiliates to other foreign affiliates within the\nmultinational group divided by the total stock of capital. The latter is defined as\nthe sum of registered capital, capital reserves, profit reserves, as well as internal and\nexternal debt.\nCorporate taxation data are taken from the International Bureau of Fiscal Documenta-\ntion, and from surveys provided by the tax advisory companies Ernst&Young, PwC,\nand KPMG. The statutory tax rate variable contains statutory profit-tax rates mod-\nified by applicable restrictions on interest deductions. The data covers a group of 79\nReferences\nAghion, P. and P.
