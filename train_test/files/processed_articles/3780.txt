    "abstract": "Abstract: Males of many species, humans included, exhibit rapid testosterone increases\nafter exposure to conspecific females. Female chemical stimuli are sufficient to trigger\nthese responses in many nonhuman species, which raises the possibility of similar effects in\nhumans. Recently, Miller and Maner (2010) reported that smelling T-shirts worn by women\nnear ovulation can trigger testosterone responses in men; however, men were aware that\nthey were smelling women's scents, and thus mental imagery associated with that\nknowledge may have contributed to the hormone responses. Here, we collected axillary\nsweat samples from women on days near ovulation. In a crossover design, men who were\nnot explicitly aware of the specific stimuli smelled the sweat samples in one session and\nwater samples in a second session. There were no differences in testosterone responses\nacross the experimental conditions. Our null findings suggest that the relevant chemical\nsignal is not found in axillary sweat, and/or that knowledge of the stimulus source is\nnecessary for hormone responses. These results thus suggest boundary conditions for the\neffects reported in Miller and Maner (2010), and recommend further research to define the\nprecise circumstances under which men's testosterone may respond to chemosensory cues\nfrom women.\n",

Chemosensory stimuli such as female urine or\nvaginal secretions are sufficient to trigger these testosterone increases in many nonhuman\nspecies (e.g., Cerda-Molina, et al., 2006; James, Nyby, and Saviolakis, 2006; Macrides,\nBartke, Fernandez, and D'Angelo, 1974; Ziegler, Schultz-Darken, Scott, Snowdon, and\nFerris, 2005), which at least raises the possibility of similar chemical communication in\nhumans.\nRecently, Miller and Maner (2010) reported that testosterone was higher in men\nwho had sniffed T-shirts worn by women on days close to ovulation compared to men who\nhad smelled shirts worn by women during the luteal phase or to men who had smelled\nunworn shirts. Ovulatory shirts were also judged to smell more pleasant, and pleasantness\nratings were marginally correlated with testosterone responses. The male perceivers in\nthese studies were explicitly told that they were smelling shirts worn by women, however,\nand this knowledge may have led the men to visualize sexual images in response to the\nmore pleasant-smelling odors. In addition, in a subsequent article (Miller and Maner, 2011)\nreporting additional results from the same studies, the authors revealed that male\nparticipants in at least one of the studies were told as part of the cover story that the women\nwearing the T-shirts were asked to \"relive in her mind an emotionally arousing event\" (p.\n300). Male subjects were asked to rate the degree to which they thought the shirt wearer\nwas feeling angry, happy, scared, or sexually aroused. Men who smelled T-shirts worn by\nwomen near ovulation provided higher sexual arousal ratings (perhaps because these shirts\nalso smelled more pleasant). This implies that men in this condition were more likely to\nhave imagined a sexually aroused woman, and such imagery may have contributed to the\ndifferences in testosterone responses between the experimental groups. Consistent with\nsuch a role for sexual thoughts, research has shown that imagining a sexual encounter can\nprime testosterone increases in women (Goldey and van Anders, 2011), and mere\ndiscussion of sexual topics was associated with increases in luteinizing hormone in men\nBecause the present research was completed before publication of the Miller and\nManer (2010) paper, it was not specifically designed to test replication of its findings, but\nnonetheless employed a design that may provide additional evidence regarding men's\nhormonal responses to chemical cues from women. In this study, we collected axillary\nsweat samples from women on days near ovulation, and then compared men's testosterone\nresponses after exposure to these samples vs. after exposure to plain water. Importantly,\nmen were not explicitly aware that they were smelling stimuli from women. There are\nThe above considerations leave ambiguous the causal role of chemical stimuli in\naffecting men's testosterone responses. On one model, specialized neural structures\ncontaining receptors for specific ovulatory chemicals may trigger neuroendocrine responses\nupon chemoreception of those chemicals. Alternatively, men may visualize women when\nthey are explicitly told that they are smelling odors from them, and may generate more\narousing images when exposed to more pleasant odors; on this account, hormone responses\ndepend on the instructions given to perceivers, and do not necessarily reflect the output of\nmechanisms designed to produce endocrine reactions to specific chemical stimuli.\nMen smelling women\ntherefore at least two important differences between this study and the Miller and Maner\n(2010) study: the use of sweat samples vs. whole T-shirts as stimuli, and the absence of\nmale participants' explicit knowledge that they were smelling stimuli from women. If\ntestosterone responses are found under the conditions of the present study, that outcome\nwould suggest that the effects demonstrated in Miller and Maner (2010) generalize across\nstimulus collection techniques and likely do not require conscious thoughts about women\nfor their occurrence. Conversely, however, if testosterone responses are not found, that\noutcome would raise questions regarding the generalizability of these effects across\nstimulus collection techniques and perceivers' states of knowledge regarding the sources of\nthe chemical stimuli.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\nStimulus donors were 10 women from the University of Texas, Austin. Mean age\nwas 19.11 (SD = 1.27). Participants were recruited conditional on not using hormonal\ncontraception, absence of prescription or recreational drug use, and self-report of regular\nmenstrual cycles 25-35 days in length. Donors were paid $25.\nStimulus perceivers were 40 heterosexual men from the University of California,\nSanta Barbara (UCSB). Mean age was 20.15 (SD = 2.20). Participants were recruited\nconditional on being non-smokers and free from illnesses that could interfere with\nolfaction. Participation was in exchange for partial course credit. Three men completed\nonly one of the two testing sessions, leaving a final sample size of n = 37.\nDesign and Procedure\nThe procedures described below were approved by the UCSB and University of\nTexas Institutional Review Boards, and were in compliance with the Code of Ethical\nPrinciples for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects of the World Medical\nAssociation (Declaration of Helsinki).\nStimulus Collection\nTo verify that samples were collected near ovulation, we used a commercially\navailable test of the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge (Clearblue Easy Ovulation Test Kit).\nWomen came to the lab beginning three days before their estimated day of ovulation (based\non backward counting from the estimated end of the cycle, with day -15 the estimated day\nof ovulation) and completed the urine applicator test each day until the LH surge was\ndetected. Positive tests were obtained for all women, and stimulus collection was scheduled\nfor the day after the LH surge. Because the LH surge reliably precedes ovulation by about\none day (e.g., Guida et al., 1999; Hoff, Quigley, and Yen, 1983), this procedure ensured\nthat all samples were collected during high fertility days of the cycle.\nWomen were provided non-deodorant soap for showering on the day of stimulus\ncollection, and were instructed to avoid scented hygiene products and odorous foods\nbeginning the night before and extending through the time of stimulus collection. Upon\narrival at the lab, a sterile gauze pad was affixed under each arm with medical tape; donors\nMen smelling women\nthen put on a sterile T-shirt supplied by the investigators. The women next took a brisk\nuntil they had broken a sweat and maintained it for five minutes. Gauze pads were removed\nand frozen at -80 C until being shipped on dry ice to UCSB, at which time they were again\nstored at -80 C before being thawed for presentation to the male perceivers (the time from\nthaw to presentation was about one hour).\nStimulus Presentation\nThe presentation phase employed a crossover design in which all men were exposed\nto both the experimental condition (sweat samples) and the control condition (water) in\nseparate sessions that were counterbalanced for order. In the experimental condition, men\ninhaled from 10 plastic squeeze bottles, each of which contained a gauze pad worn by a\nseparate donor woman; in the control condition, 10 different bottles contained unworn\ngauze pads to which water had been added. Aside from the difference in gauze pads, all\nother procedures were identical across the two conditions.\nParticipants took part in the two sessions at the same time of day spaced\napproximately one week apart. Up to ten men were tested per session, separated by\ncubicles. Sessions were administered by a male experimenter who was blind to condition.\nAs part of the informed consent process, participants were told that they might be exposed\nto a number of odors (e.g., lilac, cucumber, pine), including sweat, in a study designed to\ninvestigate the relationship between olfaction and mood. Two baseline saliva samples were\ncollected (via passive drool into polypropylene vials) 15 minutes apart while participants\ncompleted demographic surveys and the short version of the Profile of Mood States\n(POMS-B; McNair, Loor, and Droppleman, 1992). Participants were then asked to place\nthe nozzle of one of the 10 squeeze bottles close to their nostril and inhale deeply while\nsqueezing the bottle. After repeating this a second time, the odor in the bottle was rated for\npleasantness, intensity, familiarity, and liking (1-7 Likert scale). A 90 second break\nfollowed, after which the same process was repeated until all 10 bottles had been sampled.\nFurther saliva samples were then collected 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes after completion of\nthe odor rating task. The POMS was completed immediately after the odor rating task, and\nagain 30 and 60 minutes later. After the final POMS completion, participants provided a\nfree response listing of all scents that they detected in the bottles. Participants played a\ncomputerized billiard game as a filler activity between ratings; the game was set to practice\nmode (participants simply attempted shots on a virtual pool table), such that there was no\nfeedback regarding winning or losing. Debriefing occurred at the end of the second session.\nHormone Assays\nSaliva samples were stored at -80 C until being shipped on dry ice to the\nBiomarkers Core Lab at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center in Atlanta, GA.\nTestosterone was assayed via RIA in triplicate using procedures described in Roney et al.\nData Analyses\nMen smelling women\nTo measure testosterone responses to the respective stimuli, we computed area\nunder the curve (AUC) with respect to baseline (see Pruessner, Kirschbaum, Meinlschmid,\nand Hellhammer, 2003). The two testosterone values obtained before the stimulus\npresentation were averaged (r = 0.89) and served as the baseline; the AUC measures the\noverall magnitude of change relative to this baseline across the four post-stimulus saliva\nsamples. The AUC values were analyzed using linear mixed regression models in SPSS\nv19. The independent variables were experimental condition (sweat vs. water), session\n(first or second), and sequence (sweat first or water first); the latter two variables are\nnecessary to obtain unbiased estimates of the within-subject effect of condition in a\ncrossover design given the possibility of session and carry-over effects (see Jones and\nKenward, 2003). Given that hormone reactivity often depends on baseline values, baseline\ntestosterone was added as a covariate to the regression models. Mood effects (assessed as\nAUC with respect to baseline for composite \"mood disturbance\" (see McNair et al., 1992)\nfrom the POMS) and odor ratings were also analyzed with mixed regression models.\nResults\nTable 1 presents results of the mixed regression model predicting testosterone AUC\nresponses. There was no within-subject effect of exposure to sweat vs. water (p = 0.35).\nHigher baseline testosterone was associated with smaller post-stimulus changes in\ntestosterone, as expected; the null result for experimental condition was nonetheless robust\nto removal of this covariate (p = 0.28). Given the absence of session and sequence effects\n(see Table 1), a paired t-test comparing AUC in response to water and sweat will\napproximate the effect of condition and perhaps be more intuitive to some readers. This test\nalso yielded a null result, t(36) = 1.10, p = 0.28. The power of a paired t-test is\napproximately 90% to detect a moderate effect size (d  0.50) given our sample size. A\nrandom effect for the subject-level intercept was also included in the model, since there\nwas significant variance in intercepts between participants (Wald Z = 1.97, p = 0.049);\nhowever, no statistical conclusions were changed by omission of this effect and parameter\nestimates were virtually identical with or without this term in the model.\nTable 1.

AUC and baseline T were standardized, making parameter estimates interpretable in\nSD units. Condition is coded water = 0 and sweat = 1.\nFigure 1 presents the average testosterone change from baseline across the two\nMen smelling women\nconditions for each post-stimulus time of saliva collection. The pattern was in the direction\nof more positive change in testosterone after exposure to ovulatory sweat samples, but the\ndifferences between conditions were small relative to the standard deviations. Miller and\nManer (2010) measured testosterone responses 15 minutes after odor exposure; we\nconstructed a linear mixed model predicting testosterone change from baseline at post-15\nminutes, with the same predictor variables as in Table 1. As expected from Figure 1, there\nwas no effect of experimental condition (p = 0.97).\nMean odor ratings in each session were for computed for each subject; because mean\npleasantness and liking ratings were highly correlated (r = 0.90), we combined them into a\ncomposite attractiveness rating. Ratings were standardized relative to the grand mean to\nallow for interpretation of parameter estimates in standard deviation units. Linear mixed\nmodels controlling for sequence and session revealed no effect of condition on\nattractiveness ratings (b = 0.08, p = 0.68), greater intensity ratings for sweat vs. water (b =\nlinear mixed model revealed no effect of experimental condition on standardized AUC for\n\"total mood disturbance\" as measured by the POMS (b = -0.08, p = 0.59).\nFigure 1.

These references occurred in 35 and 51 percent of the\nsessions in which participants had smelled water and sweat, respectively; a binary mixed\nlogistic regression model revealed that the within-subject effect of experimental condition\non the likelihood of having guessed exposure to human stimuli was not statistically\nsignificant (b = 0.77; p = 0.15; Exp (b) = 2.15), despite the pattern of greater detection in\nMen smelling women\nthe sweat condition. In addition, the free response listings contained references to\nnonhuman odors (e.g., fruits, pine, mint, rubber, alcohol) more often than to human odors \u00ad\nthese references occurred in 54 and 68 percent of the control and experimental sessions,\nrespectively \u00ad and in 81 percent of the cases in which a human odor was listed, at least one\nother odor was also recorded. As such, the participants generally appeared to be in a state\nof uncertainty regarding the nature of the stimuli. Whether subjects reported having\ndetected human odors had no effect on testosterone AUC responses, whether tested as a\nmain effect or an interaction with experimental condition in mixed regression analyses (ps\nAlthough participants did not differentially detect human stimuli across the two\nconditions, there was evidence that they were more likely to detect odors in general in the\nsweat condition: participants reported having smelled nothing in 41 percent of the control\nsessions but in only 22 percent of the experimental sessions; a binary mixed logistic\nregression model revealed a marginally significant, within-subject effect of experimental\ncondition on the likelihood of having reported detection of any scent (b = 1.13, p = 0.067,\nExp (b) = 3.10). Exclusion of the cases in which men detected no odors in the sweat\ncondition did not reverse the null effect of experimental condition on testosterone responses\n(p = 0.32), nor did general odor detection predict testosterone AUC responses either as a\nmain effect or as an interaction with condition (ps > 0.75). In sum, participants tended to\ndetect more odors in the sweat condition, but were uncertain regarding the precise identity\nof those odors; in addition, testosterone responses were not moderated by whether men\nreported detection of human or other odors.\nFinally, as part of the background surveys completed during collection of the\nbaseline saliva samples, participants indicated when they had last exercised. Miller and\nManer (2010) instructed men not to exercise for at least 12 hours before taking part in their\nstudy. Controlling for time since last exercise in the present study did not reverse the null\neffect of experimental condition on testosterone responses (b = 0.23, p = 0.20); likewise,\nexclusion of the 14 men who indicated last exercise less than 12 hours ago had no effect on\nthe parameter estimate for experimental group (b = 0.19, p = 0.40; compare Table 1).\nDiscussion\nUnlike Miller and Maner (2010), we did not find more positive testosterone\nresponses in men after exposure to ovulatory chemical stimuli than after exposure to\ncontrol stimuli. Importantly, our study was not an exact replication of the Miller and Maner\n(2010) study, and so should not be construed as a direct replication failure. Nonetheless, the\ndiscrepancy in findings raises important issues regarding which differences in methods may\nhave led to the distinct outcomes.\nWe note first a number of strengths of our study design that, if anything, should\nhave improved the chances of positive findings. We confirmed the timing of ovulation via\nLH tests, for instance, collected a larger number of baseline and post-test saliva samples,\nand employed a more statistically powerful crossover design in which the same men took\npart in all experimental conditions. Our use of gauze pads that were frozen and then thawed\nis unlikely to explain discrepancies between the studies, both because experiments have\nMen smelling women\nshown that this process does not affect reactions to human axillary stimuli (Lenochova,\nRoberts, and Havlicek, 2009) and because Miller and Maner (2010) also froze their stimuli.\nIn addition, higher ratings of intensity and familiarity in the sweat condition support\nsuccessful chemoreception of the axillary stimuli. As such, low power, mis-estimations of\novulatory timing, or failures of chemoreception are all unlikely explanations for our failure\nto detect significant effects.\nOne clear difference between the study designs was our use of axillary sweat\ncollected on gauze pads as stimuli, as opposed to the use of worn T-shirts as stimuli in\nMiller and Maner (2010). In principle, a chemical signal of ovulatory timing could be\nabsent from axillary secretions but present elsewhere on the skin; arguing against this,\nhowever, are findings that axillary secretions collected near ovulation are rated more\npleasant and sexy than such secretions collected at other times in the menstrual cycle\n(Gildersleeve, Haselton, Larson, and Pillsworth, 2012; Havlicek, Dvorakova, Bartos, and\nFlegr, 2006). Nonetheless, even in the studies that have collected axillary secretions,\nparticipants have worn gauze pads under their arms for longer periods of time than in the\npresent study, and without active stimulation of sweating; as such, we cannot rule out the\npossibility that the use of axillary sweat as stimuli may have removed or attenuated the\ncrucial cues necessary for elicitation of testosterone responses. If our use of axillary\nsamples instead of T-shirts was in fact the cause of our null findings, this would at the very\nleast raise questions as to whether the effects demonstrated in Miller and Maner (2010) are\nrobust across alternative methods of stimulus collection and presentation.\nA second difference between the studies concerns the male participants' knowledge\nof the stimulus source. As explained in the Introduction, male participants in Miller and\nManer (2010) were explicitly told that they were smelling shirts worn by women, and this\nknowledge may have triggered mental images that contributed to the observed hormonal\nresponses. In the present study, men appeared to be in a state of uncertainty regarding the\nidentity of the odor stimuli: men were not significantly more likely to report detection of\nhuman odors in the experimental as opposed to the control condition, and participants\ngenerally reported detection of nonhuman odors more often than detection of human odors.\nEven in cases in which men reported detecting sweat or body odor, there was never any\nreference to women's scents in particular, such that there is little reason to think that the\nmale participants were visualizing women. Differential likelihood of having visualized\nwomen thus stands as another possible explanation for the discrepant findings between the\ntwo studies: perhaps chemoreception of ovulatory cues is by itself insufficient to trigger a\nneuroendocrine response in human males, which may instead require additional stimuli,\nsuch as visual images triggered by knowledge of the stimulus source. The need for\nadditional, contextual cues for elicitation of responses to chemical stimuli has precedent in\nresearch on humans, as women's physiological and mood responses to putative human\nchemosignals have been shown to be dependent on sex of the experimenter (Jacob, Hayreh,\nand McClintock, 2001). The requirement of additional inputs beyond chemoreception itself\ndoes not refute the possible information content of chemical stimuli, of course, but does\nsuggest possible differences from some nonhuman species in which testosterone appears to\nrespond to chemoreception alone (see below).\nThe possible absence of a direct neuroendocrine response to chemoreception of\nMen smelling women\novulatory cues is consistent with specific aspects of human neuroanatomy. In many\nnonhuman species, males' testosterone responds to female chemical stimuli in isolation\n(e.g., Macrides et al., 1974; Pfeiffer and Johnston, 1994). In rodents, ablation of a structure\ncalled the vomeronasal organ (VNO) has been shown to eliminate male hormonal\nresponses to female urine or vaginal secretions but not to interactions with actual females\n(Coquelin, Clancy, Macrides, Noble, and Gorski, 1984; Pfeiffer and Johnston, 1994); as\nsuch, the VNO appears to mediate direct neuroendocrine responses to chemoreception of\ncues from females. Importantly, evidence suggests that the human homologue of the VNO\nis vestigial and without functional connections (e.g., Bhatnagar and Smith, 2010; Frasnelli,\nLundstrom, Boyle, Katsarkas, and Jones-Gotman, 2011). If so, then human males could be\nexpected to respond like VNO-lesioned nonhuman males: with an absence of hormonal\nresponses to female chemical stimuli presented in isolation, despite reactive hormone\nincreases after interactions with actual females. Results from the present study combined\nwith previous research on men's testosterone responses to social interactions with women\nThe argument that the effects reported in Miller and Maner (2010) may require more than\njust chemoreception of female stimuli, then, is bolstered by evidence that the specific\nneural structure mediating direct effects of chemoreception in nonhuman species appears to\nbe non-functional in humans.\nIn conclusion, we found no evidence that exposure to women's ovulatory, axillary\nsweat could trigger reactive testosterone increases in men who were uncertain of the source\nof the stimuli. These results raise questions regarding the generalizability of the effects\nreported in Miller and Maner (2010) across stimulus collection methods and perceiver\nstates of knowledge. Importantly, a direct effect of chemoreception in the absence of\nconscious knowledge of the stimulus source has yet to be demonstrated in humans. An\nideal future study could experimentally manipulate perceivers' knowledge of the stimulus\nsource in a design that employs the stimulus collection methods used in Miller and Maner\n(2010). Given financial constraints, we are unlikely to complete such a study in the near\nfuture, but we encourage others to do so.\n"
