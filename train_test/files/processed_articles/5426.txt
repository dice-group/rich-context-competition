Clausson, PhD, RNT1\n Keywords\nhealth education, mental health, high school, program development/evaluation\nIntroduction\nSchool has been proposed as a good place for health-\npromoting interventions (DeSocio & Hootman, 2004). Cogni-\ntive behavioral programs are found to have positive effects in\npreventing depressive symptoms in adolescents (Corrieri\net al., 2013). There is, however, a great need to evaluate effec-\ntive interventions in ``real-world'' practice in order to investi-\ngate their sustainability and feasibility (O'Connell, Boat, &\nWarner, 2009). The purpose of this article is to describe the\nfirst 2 years of the implementation of a school-based preven-\ntion program, its effects on depressive symptoms, the costs\ninvolved, and the views of the students and tutors.\nBackground\nPromoting well-being and preventing depressive symptoms\nin adolescence are important school health concerns.\nDepression in adolescence is a common health issue globally\n(Patel, Flisher, Hetrick, & McGorry, 2007), with a 1-year\nprevalence of more than 4% by the end of adolescence (Tha-\npar, Collishaw, Pine, & Thapar, 2012). Preventing depres-\nsive symptoms means not only less individual suffering\nbut also fewer societal costs (Kessler, 2012). We are most\nlikely to find adolescents at school, and therefore school\nmay be a good place to implement intervention programs\ntargeting depression (Carnevale, 2013). However, it is\nessential that the programs be effective not only in study set-\ntings but also when implemented in schools and conducted\nby the regular school staff. The RE-AIM framework is a\nmodel used for assessing the public health impact of an\nintervention (Glasgow, Vogt, & Boles, 1999). It was devel-\noped to overlap the gap between interventions found to be\neffective in study settings but that are difficult to implement\neffectively in the world of busy, often understaffed commu-\nnity settings. The emphasis on developing clinically signif-\nicant outcomes has produced a lot of intensive, expensive\ninterventions that are demanding for both students and staff.\nLow-intensity interventions that are less efficacious but\n1 Department of Health Science, Kristianstad University, Kristianstad,\nSweden\n2 Center for Primary Health Care Research, Faculty of Medicine, Lund\nUniversity, Lund, Sweden\n3 Department of Clinical Sciences, Malmo\n\u00a8, Health Economic Unit, Lund\nUniversity, Lund, Sweden\n4 Department of Nursing, Health and Culture, University West, Trollha\n\u00a8ttan,\nSweden\nCorresponding Author:\nPernilla Garmy, MMS, RN, Center for Primary Health Care Research,\nFaculty of Medicine, Lund University, Lund 222 28, Sweden.\nEmail: pernilla.garmy@med.lu.se\nThe Journal of School Nursing\nReprints and permission:\nsagepub.com/journalsPermissions.nav\njsn.sagepub.com\nreach a large population may have a more pervasive impact\n(Glasgow et al., 1999). Unfortunately, there is a serious lack\nof real-world evaluation of the school-based programs con-\ncerning behavioral and emotional issues (see Fact Box 1;\nO'Connell et al., 2009; The Swedish Council on Health\nPrevention programs are categorized as universal (desig-\nnated for everyone in a population), selective (designated for\nrisk groups), or indicated (designated for those who already\nhave symptoms; Mrazek & Haggerty, 1994). Universal\napproaches may have advantages over indicated and selec-\ntive interventions due to higher recruitment rates and less\nrisk of stigmatizing (Corrieri et al., 2013). A cognitive beha-\nvioral intervention developed in the United States and used\nfor selective and indicated prevention of depression--``Cop-\ning with Stress'' (Clarke & Lewinsohn, 1995)--has been\nadopted to a Swedish setting and used here as a universal\nschool-based intervention, called ``Depression in Swedish\nAdolescents'' or DISA (Treutiger & Lindberg, 2013). The\ntheoretical orientation of the intervention is represented by\nthe multifactorial model of depression (Lewinsohn, Hober-\nman, Teri, & Hautzinger, 1985) in which increased depres-\nsion is presumed to be the result of multiple etiological\nelements, such as negative cognitions, stressful events, pre-\ndisposing vulnerabilities, risk factors (e.g., being female,\nhaving a previous history of depression, having depressed\nparents), and immunities to depression (e.g., high self-\nesteem, coping skills, high frequency of pleasant events and\nactivities). The DISA course comprises 10 structured group\n=2 hr each, led by school nurses, school social\nworkers, and teachers. Although the Coping with Stress\ncourse has been well evaluated in the United States (Clarke\nhas been carried out regarding DISA, showing slightly pos-\nitive results (Treutiger & Lindberg, 2013). There is a need to\ninvestigate the reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementa-\ntion, and maintenance (Glasgow et al., 1999) of the program.\nAim\nThe aim was to evaluate a universal school-based cognitive\nbehavioral intervention whose target is to prevent depressive\nsymptoms in adolescents. Specific research questions were\nas follows:\nResearch Question 1: Is there a reduction of depressive\nsymptoms after delivering the intervention, and can this\nbe maintained at the one-year follow-up?\nResearch Question 2: Is there a difference in improved\ndepressive symptoms between boys and girls\npostintervention?\nResearch Question 3: What are the students' and tutors'\nexperiences of the intervention?\nResearch Question 4: How much is the total implemen-\ntation cost of the intervention?\nMethod\nThe study had a quasi-experimental design with pretest,\nposttest, and a 1-year follow-up (Shadish, Cook, & Camp-\nbell, 2002) and provides an illustrative calculation of the\nimplementation costs of the intervention. This study was\napproved by the Regional Ethical Review Board in Lund\nwith written and oral information about the study and its vol-\nuntary nature. The school principal, parents, and participants\ngave their written informed consent.\nParticipants\nA power calculation was made a priori with mean change\nin Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale\n(CES-D) as the primary outcome. A mean difference of\n2.0 was regarded as clinically relevant and for 80%\npower. The power calculation showed that a total sample\nof 49 participants were needed (standard deviation [SD]:\nThe study was performed in southern Sweden, in a muni-\ncipality with 2,700 inhabitants and with only one school with\noffered a voluntary psychoeducational course in the regular\nschool context. Of the 68 students, 62 accepted the offer and\nparticipated. Six students (two females and four males) who\ndid not participate in the intervention instead took part in the\nordinary school schedule, which was physical education in\nall cases. The tutors were school social workers (n \u00bc 3),\nteachers (n \u00bc 3), and a school nurse (n \u00bc 1), all of whom had\nundergone 3 days of training and 1 day of supervision in the\nmethod. Every course had two tutors, and the groups\nFact Box 1. Depression in Adolescence.\nDepressive disorder in adolescence is a common mental health\nproblem in adolescents globally but is often unrecognized. The\nestimated 1-year prevalence is 4\u00ad5% in mid- to late adolescence.\nDepression is a major risk factor for suicide in adolescence, with\na majority of adolescent suicide victims reported to have a\ndepressive disorder at the time of death. Depression is also\nlinked with serious social and academic impairments. The\nfeatures of the disorder are broadly similar in adolescents and\nadults, with the exception that in adolescents, irritable rather\nthan depressed mood is a core symptom. But depression in\nadolescents is missed more often than in adults perhaps because\nof the prominence of irritability, mood reactivity, and fluctuating\nsymptoms in adolescents. It is not unusual for depression to be\nmissed because the primary presenting problems are unexplained\nphysical symptoms, eating disorders, anxiety, refusal to attend\nschool, decline in academic performance, substance misuse, or\nbehavioral problems.\nconsisted of 10\u00ad18 students. There were five groups in total:\nthree with girls only and two with boys only.\nMeasurement\nThe students answered the questionnaires in the classroom,\nwrote their comments with paper and pencil, and were\ninstructed not to look at each other's answers. The tutors were\navailable to offer support if there were problems understand-\ning the questionnaires. The students were asked to complete\nthe CES-D (Radloff, 1977) in the first and the last sessions\nand again after 12 months. The CES-D is a self-reported mea-\nsure of the frequency of 20 depressive symptoms. Each item\nis scored for frequency over the past week, from 0 (rarely or\nnever) to 3 (most or all of the time), with a total possible score\nrange between 0 and 60. The CES-D has been found to be\nvalid and reliable in adolescents (Roberts, Lewinsohn, & See-\nley, 1991). Scores equal to or above 16 are considered to indi-\ncate a high risk for depressive symptoms (Treutiger &\nAt the end of the course, the students were encouraged to\nwrite comments about the course. The instructions were ``To\nfind out what you think about these sessions a little bit more\ncarefully, we would like you to fill out this form. You can fill\nit out anonymously if you wish.'' At the 12-month follow-\nup, questions about place of birth, family, and economic\nsituation and the question ``What did you think about the\nintervention?'' were added. The tutors were also asked to\nwrite comments about the intervention at the end of the\ncourse, and the tutor instructor provided information about\nthe costs of the intervention.\nProcedure\nThe intervention was offered as a voluntary course in lieu of\nthe regular physical education class. It was given once a\n=2 hr each time, for a period of 10 weeks, on the\nsame weekday and at the same time for every session. All\ncourses were given in the morning and took place in the\nschool conference room where fruit was served. The pro-\ngram is manual based, with a fixed curriculum for every\nsession (see Fact Box 2). It focuses on training in\ncognitive-restructuring skills, techniques for modifying irra-\ntional and negative self-statements, and ideas to reduce the\nrisk of developing depressive symptoms.\nData Analysis\nFrequency analyses were performed to describe the following\ndemographic and background characteristics of the students:\ngender, age, place of birth, parents living together, and per-\nceived economic situation (The question was ``How well off\nfinancially do you think your family is?'' with six possible\nanswers: Very well, rather well, average, not that well, not\nwell at all, or don't know). The Friedman test (chi-square)\nwas used for measuring differences in the CES-D scores\nbetween preintervention, postintervention, and the 12-month\nfollow-up. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used for post hoc\nanalysis. A reduced p value (Bonferroni method) of .0167 was\nused to control for the risk of mass significance due to\nFact Box 2. A Group Cognitive Intervention Aimed at\nPreventing Depressive Symptoms in Adolescents.\nThe American program ``Coping with Stress'' (Clarke &\nLewinsohn, 1995) was modified by the Center for Public Health\nin Stockholm for a Swedish setting and was called ``Depression\nin Swedish Adolescents,'' or DISA. The Coping with Stress\ncourse is an indicated program specifically designed for those\nshowing signs of depression, whereas DISA is a universal\nprogram that does not require participants to have or have had\ndepressive symptoms.\nSetting: The program is now frequently used in schools all\nover Sweden and is mainly provided for girls aged 13\u00ad15.\nStudies have shown that girls in this age group have many\npsychosocial complaints (Swedish National Institute of Public\nHealth, 2011). School health staff and teachers are trained to be\ntutors.

The statistical analyses\nwere performed using SPSS, version 17.0.\nThe written comments from the students and the tutors\nwere analyzed using qualitative content analysis (Krippen-\nused. The texts were read several times and then condensed,\ncoded, and grouped into categories. During this process, the\nauthors discussed the analysis to obtain consensus and\nenhance trustworthiness (Graneheim & Lundman, 2004).\nTwo categories emerged from the students' comments, and\ntwo categories from the tutors' comments.\nResults\nSixty-two students participated in the intervention in Grade\n8 (their age thus being 14 years). All but three students were\nborn in Sweden, and 10% of the parents were born abroad.\nThis may be compared with the rest of Sweden in which\n15% of residents are born abroad (Statistics Sweden,\n2012). About 86% of the students had parents living together\nand 77% of the students believed that their families were in a\ngood or very good economic situation. The school is located\nin an area with high mean income, according to Statistics\nCES-D: Questionnaire About Depressive Symptoms\nThe students answered the CES-D questionnaire at the start\nand the end of the program and also after 1 year. At the\n1-year follow-up, 55 (89%) students had answered the\nquestionnaire on all three occasions. The CES-D scores\nof the females significantly changed (improved) from\npreintervention to postintervention and at the 12-month\nfollow-up (p \u00bc .018). When Wilcoxon tests were used to\nfollow-up on this finding, it appeared that the CES-D score\ndid significantly change from the preintervention to the\npostintervention (p \u00bc .031) and from preintervention to\nThis long-term effect did not appear in the male popula-\ntion. Although the CES-D scores for the males did signifi-\ncantly change from preintervention to postintervention and\nat the 12-month follow-up (p \u00bc .008); when Wilcoxon tests\nwere used to follow-up on this finding, it appeared that the\nCES-D score did significantly change from the preinterven-\ntion to the postintervention (p \u00bc .027) but that this was not\nmaintained from preintervention to the 12-month follow-up\nStudent Experience\nThe students were asked to rate their experience (positive,\nneutral, or negative) with the course. In all, 64% of the stu-\ndents were positive, 9% were negative, and 27% were neu-\ntral. More females than males were positive but the\ndifference was not significant. The students were also asked\nto answer an open question, ``What did you think of the\nintervention?'' Two categories emerged from the student\ncomments: ``achieving a new way of thinking'' and ``getting\nto know each other better.'' The category ``achieving a new\nway of thinking'' was concerned with the learning outcomes\nof the program mainly about identifying one's thoughts and\nchanging negative thoughts to positive ones.\nI have got a new way of thinking; I have learned how to change\nnegative thoughts into positive ones.

It felt good to identify my thoughts, both the negative ones\nand the positive ones, in order to control them more easily.\n(Female)\nThe girls wrote more comments than the boys in response to\nthe open question about what they thought about the DISA\ncourse. Most of them had positive comments, but some girls\nwrote that they did not think that the course gave them any-\nthing and some found it boring. The boys used fewer words\nin their comments but most of them were positive:\nIt was great to get tips about how to change negative thoughts\nfast! (Male)\nSome boys wrote that the program was unnecessary and bor-\ning and did not help them.\n``Getting to know each other better'' seems to be an\nimportant outcome of the course. Although one girl wrote\nthat she did not want to talk about her feelings with the other\nparticipants, many students wrote about the communication\ntraining as being fun and useful.\nThe most important thing for me is that we girls in Grade 8\nbecame closer to each other and we got to know one another\nmore deeply. (Female)\nIt was fun and I learned a lot, and it was good to get to know the\nothers in the group. (Male)\nBeing a Tutor\nAmong the tutor comments, two categories emerged, ``con-\ncerns about practical conditions'' and ``adapting the program\nto the group.'' All tutors were positive about the program\nalthough they also described challenges and difficulties.\nComments in the category ``concerns about practical condi-\ntions'' were that the course took a lot of time, but they were\ngiven this time by the school administration, which is a\nrequirement for future courses. They found that DISA was\nneeded for both girls and boys, and they found the group size\nto be important. One of the boys' groups had 18 participants\nand they found this too big. Students who scored high (>16)\non the CES-D questionnaire were offered individual follow-\nup with the school nurse. The course was offered as a volun-\ntary class at school, though almost all the students in Grade 8\nchose to take the course. They reflected on the importance of\ngood chemistry between the tutors (there were two tutors in\neach course) and felt that it was good for new tutors to col-\nlaborate with someone with more experience. They also\nfound that they were able to conduct the courses more\nsmoothly as they became more experienced. Comments in\nthe category ``adapting the program to the group'' were con-\ncerned with how they had included more games and more\ncommunication exercises, as well as a set of cards with pic-\ntures of bears expressing different feelings, in order to make\nthe program more appropriate for the audience. They found\nthat some students did not work seriously during the pro-\ngram; these students did not actively participate during the\ndiscussions and did not do their homework. The tutors found\nthat the program used words and metaphors about connec-\ntions between thoughts, emotions, and actions that were dif-\nficult for some students to grasp; therefore, they tried to\nadapt the course to the group.\nIllustrative Calculation of the Implementation Costs\nIntroducing a new program entails allocating resources to\ntrain program tutors and to implement the program\n(Drummond, Sculpher, Torrance, O'Brien, & Stoddart,\n2005). We have made an illustrative calculation of costs of\nthe program implementation using the figures from the pilot\nstudy regarding time used for training program tutors, pre-\nparation, and conducting the 10-week course with five\ngroups of students (see Appendix). In total, the cost was\nUS$300 per student to implement the program (Table 2).\nOf this, as much as half the costs are related to training\ntutors, including time and fees. If these tutors repeat the pro-\ngram, the average cost per student will fall. In addition, in\nthis particular setting the program was conducted within the\ncurrent budget, and no extra staff were employed. Costs\nother than wages corresponded to about US$50 per student.\nDiscussion\nThe RE-AIM provides a framework for identifying pro-\ngrams that work in real-world environments (Glasgow\net al., 1999). The results will be discussed through the lens\nof the following factors: reach, effectiveness, adoption,\nimplementation, and maintenance.\nReach\nThe factor of reach refers to the proportion of the target\npopulation that participated in the intervention. All the stu-\ndents in Grade 8 (aged 14) were given the opportunity to\nparticipate in the intervention as a voluntary course during\nthe regular physical education curriculum time. Only 6 of\nTable 2. Cost and Time Calculation.\nTime Calculation\nCost (US$)\nper Student\nTraining of the head\ninstructor\nstudents\nTraining head instructor\nand five tutors\nConducting the\nintervention\nstudent\nMaterials (paper copies,\ncandles, fruit)\nthe 68 students declined to participate, 2 females and 4\nmales. Three of them stated that they would rather partici-\npate in the ordinary physical education class, and three stu-\ndents did not provide a reason. The school is located in a\nrelatively high-income area, and, therefore, further studies\nare called for to investigate the reach in areas with a differ-\nent socioeconomic situation.\nEfficacy/Effectiveness\nThe students scored lower on measures of recent depressive\nsymptoms at the 1-year follow-up, compared with preinter-\nvention. However, upon taking a closer look at the material,\nwe found that this improvement was only significant for\nfemales. At postintervention, there were significantly less\ndepressive symptoms among the males compared with base-\nline, but this was not maintained at the 1-year follow-up.\nHowever, for the females, the significant improvement was\nmaintained from postintervention to the 1-year follow-up. At\nbaseline, the CES-D scores were better compared with other\nstudies in Sweden (Treutiger & Lindberg, 2013) and in the\nUnited States (Clarke et al., 1995). One may ask whether\nthese results have any clinical relevance if the participants\nalready felt good at the start. But the fact that the girls scored\nsignificantly better at postintervention and at the 1-year\nfollow-up must be considered a positive effect for them. The\nonly previously published study (Treutiger & Lindberg,\n2013) of the DISA program in Sweden did not find signifi-\ncant changes in CES-D scores at the 1-year follow-up.\nOverall,students ratedthe program highly. Only a few (9%)\nhad a negative attitude to the course, whereas 64% were posi-\ntive and 27% neutral. The majority of the students who left\nmore detailed written comments on the course were positive\nabout it. They foundthat the course had taught thema new way\nofthinking,andfromthecomments,itispossibletounderstand\nthat they had learned the basics of cognitive behavioral ther-\napy. They also wrote that the course made the group climate\nbetter. But one girl, in contrast, wrote that she did not want\nto talk about her feelings in front of the others in the group.\nAlthough the course was a voluntary one, the students had not\nchosen their group members. Making the group atmosphere\ncomfortable is the responsibility of the tutor. The DISA course\nis based on the participants discussing their feelings quite\nopenly and for this, a safe atmosphere in the group is needed.\nAdoption\nThe factor adoption refers to the school's acceptance of the\ninterventionwithintheorganization.Thisisa real-worldstudy,\nmeaning that the intervention was initiated by the school. The\nresearchers were invited to evaluate the implementation, but\nthe intervention would have been conducted even if this eva-\nluation study had not been performed. The intervention was\nwell accepted by the school, and the tutors found that they\nreceivedsufficient support fromthe schooladministration,that\nis, enough time to plan and conduct the course. They pointed\nout that this support was necessary for future courses.\nImplementation\nAll of the tutors were positive toward the course, but they\nalso highlighted some difficulties. For example, there were\nsome students who did not take the course seriously; that is,\nthey did not participate actively in the discussions or did not\ndo their homework. The tutors also noticed that the course\nmaterials exceeded the reading and comprehension level\nof some students. In order to adapt the program to the ado-\nlescents, they made some adjustments in the course by, for\nexample, bringing in more games or change discussion\ntopics instead of following the program manual strictly.\nBecause of this, it is difficult to tell whether this study really\nevaluated the DISA program in general or only the version\nthese tutors used. The main instructor (the one who taught\nthe method to the tutors) claimed that it was not possible\nto exclude anything from the program but that there was\nsome space to bring in extra exercises in order to make the\ncore content understandable for the students. Questions\nabout program fidelity must be taken into account in all eva-\nluations, but this way of adapting the course might be accep-\ntable, according to Breitenstein, Robbins, and Cowell\nThe cost of implementing the program for the initial 2 years\nwas about US$300 per student and course. These costs will fall\nas the tutors lead more courses. Also, the time the tutors spend\nin planning the course will decrease with time as the tutors\nbecome more used to the program. It is also important to note\nthat the school in this case did not employ any extra personnel\nin order to implement the DISA intervention but instead used\nthe existing staff. Thus, the extra expenditures for the school\nmay only include the cost of the head course instructor and\nprinting costs for student materials (US$50 per student). There\nare few calculations of implementation costs in the literature\nand none about the DISA course. However, one study calculat-\ning costs for the Coping with Stress course in the United States\nfound the implementation cost to be US$1632 per student, but\nthis was an indicated program targeting adolescents at risk for\nfuture depression, and about 65% of the costs were used to\nidentify at-risk teens and recruit families to the intervention\n(Lynch et al., 2005). In a pilot study such as this one, it is not\npossible to draw conclusions about possible Qualitative\nAdjusted Life Year benefits.\nMaintenance\nThis factor refers to the maintenance of intervention effects\nin individuals and settings over time. The 1-year follow-up\neffects were discussed previously under the factor efficacy/\neffectiveness. The intervention is still being used at the\ndemonstrate certain sustainability.\nLimitations\nIn this study, we learned that the instrument measuring depres-\nsion, CES-D, was easy for the students to fill out, but in a full-\nscale study, it would be preferable to add more questions tar-\ngeting anxiety and quality of life as well. In a full-scale study,\na control group containing students not participating in the\nDISA course is also necessary. More geographic and income\ndiversity is also needed in a full-scale study. The tutors' claims\nthatitwas not alwayseasytostrictlyfollowthemanualsuggest\nthere is a need for detailed information in a full-scale study\nabout how the intervention is actually conducted (i.e., program\nfidelity). The written comments from the students and tutors\nimplied that it might be a good idea to conduct interviews in\norder to better understand their experiences. Qualitative inter-\nviews provide more information than short, written comments\n(Garmy, Berg & Clausson, 2014). It is not possible to draw any\nextensive conclusions from such a small study without a con-\ntrol group. However, since the literature contains few evalua-\ntions of school-based prevention programs, it is of utmost\nimportance that studies of this sort are employed.\nSchool Nursing Implications\nPreventing depressive symptoms in adolescents is an impor-\ntant school nursing issue. With the growing recognition of\ninterdisciplinary interventions, school nurses are in a good\nplace to bring mental health promotion programs to schools\n(Cowell, 2013). In the cognitive behavioral intervention\ndescribed in this article, school nurses are often tutors.\nSchool nurses need to critically evaluate the programs that\nare employed, either by conducting the evaluations them-\nselves or by motivating others--for example, principals or\npoliticians--to perform them. Unfortunately, there is a great\nshortage of evaluations today, which may mean that ineffi-\ncient programs will continue to be used, and efficient pro-\ngrams will remain unknown and unused. We have to\nperform evaluations and publish them so that we can learn\nfrom each other and thereby provide the best care for our\nchildren and adolescents at school.\nConclusion\nA majority of the students and all of the tutors were satisfied\nwith the cognitive behavioral intervention preventing depres-\nsive symptoms. The students, both females and males, scored\nlower on measures of recent depressive symptoms after the\ncourse; and for the females, this was maintained 1-year postin-\ntervention. Many students said they had learned a new way of\nthinking. The tutors found that the core mission of the course\nwas to give the students tools for the future. The tutors high-\nlighted the advantages of offering the course on a voluntary\nbasis. They also highlighted practical issues, such as the course\nbeing quite time consuming, and emphasized the importance\nof having full support from the school administration when\nimplementing this sort of program.\nAppendix\nIllustrative Calculation of the Implementation Costs\nIntroducing a new program implies a need to allocate\nresources to train program tutors and to implement the pro-\ngram. From a decision-making perspective, we have made\nan illustrative calculation of the costs of the Depression in\nSwedish Adolescents (DISA) program implementation using\nthe figures from the pilot study for time spent on training pro-\ngram tutors, preparation, and conducting the 10-week course\nwith five groups of students. Total cost includes the cost of\ntraining the head instructor. She took two courses for a total\nof 48 hr of training: basic training (3 days with 1 day of super-\nvision) at US$870 and head instructor training (3 days with\n1 day of supervision) at US$1450. She then gave a basic train-\ning course to five colleagues as part of the implementation of\nthe DISA program: a total of 32 hr of instruction (4 days, 8 hr\nper day). Thus, the training time needed for the tutors who\nwere later to instruct a total of 62 students was, on average,\n3.35 hr per student. The students were divided up into five dif-\nferent groups, each with two tutors. Each session required 11\nhours of classroom time and 11\n=2 hours of preparation time for\neach of the two tutors. Thus, each session costs 3 hr per tutor.\nSince each course group had 10 sessions of instruction, the\ntutor time needed for each group (with two tutors per group)\nwas 60 hr. The mean number of students in each course group\nwas 12.4 (62 students in five course groups). The average\ntutor time spent per student was thus 4 hr. The total cost of the\ncourse in terms of tutor time per student was thus 7.35 hr (3.35\nhr tutor training time and 4 hr of instruction time). The salary\ncosts were about US$34/hr (including prescribed employer\ncosts). The course material can be obtained for free on the\nInternet, but the costs for making paper copies and for fruit\nwere about US$13 per student. In total, this gives the sum\nof US$300 per student for implementing the DISA program\nonce in a context similar to the one in this pilot study. Of this,\nas much as half the costs are related to the training costs of\nDISA tutors, including time and course fees. If these tutors\nrepeat the DISA program, the average cost per student will\nfall. In addition, in this particular setting, the DISA program\nwas conducted within the current budget, and no extra staff\nwere employed. The illustrative calculation was based on the\nassumption that the opportunity cost of staff time--that is,\nthe value of the tasks that could not be performed because the\nschool nurse or school social worker were engaged with the\nDISA program--was valued using wages following\nthe human capital approach (Drummond et al., 2005). Costs\nother than wages corresponded to about US$50 per student.\n"
