MA abuse and dependence have become major public\nhealth and law enforcement problems.5\nMA use in the US has been demonstrated to have regional\nvariation and has consistently been higher in the West and\nMidwest.5,6 One explanation for this relationship may be re-\ngional differences in MA manufacturing and distribution.\nFirst, since 1990, the manufacture and distribution of MA has\nexpanded in two major ways. MA production in home labo-\nratories became widespread throughout California and other\nWestern states, as well as in the Rocky Mountain states. At the\nsame time, large-scale laboratories developed in Southern\nCalifornia and Northern Mexico. MA from these labs was\ndistributed primarily in the West and Midwest.5,7 MA supply\nfrom these two sources resulted in a higher availability of MA\nthroughout the West and Midwest. However, these factors\ndo not completely explain the regional variation in MA use.\nThe West and Midwest hold consistently higher rates of MA\nuse though current MA production and distribution are more\nAltitudeMayContributetoRegionalVariationinMethamphetamine\nUse in the United States: A Population Database Study\n1The Brain Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA\n2Department of Psychiatry, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT, USA\n3Department of Psychiatry, The Catholic University of Korea College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea\n4VISN 19 MIRECC, Salt Lake City Veterans Affairs Health Care System, Salt Lake City, UT, USA\n5Department of Radiology and Research Institute of Radiology, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea\nObjectiveaaMethamphetamine (MA) use rates in the United States (US) have consistently demonstrated geographical variation and\nhave been higher in the West and Midwest. This uneven pattern of use could be explained by regional differences in MA manufacturing\nand distribution, but may also result from differences in altitude. The hypobaric hypoxia found at high altitude alters neurotransmitter\nsynthesis in the brain, which may contribute to MA use.

The mean\naltitude of each state was calculated using the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission altitude data set.\nResultsaaThere was a significant positive correlation between mean state altitude and MA use rate (r=0.66, p<0.0001). Multivariate linear\nregression analysis showed that altitude remained a significant predictor for MA use rate (=0.36, p=0.02), after adjusting for age, ethnici-\nty, education, socioeconomic level, employment, MA laboratory incidents, subpopulations, and other substance use.\nConclusionaaAltitude appears to a possible contributing factor for regional variation of MA use in the US.

While the herita-\nbility of MA abuse and dependence are unknown, several\nstudies have examined the stimulant class of drugs that in-\nvariance in the risk for stimulant use disorders is attributable\nto genetic factors, indicating that up to 67% can be attributed\nto environmental factors.\nOne potential environmental contributor to the regional\nvariation in MA use may be the effect of high altitude, which\nis a major geographic characteristic of the Intermountain West\nin the US Increased altitudes provide sustained hypobaric\nand hypoxic environments. The brain consumes 20 percent of\nthe total body oxygen for its normal neurophysiological func-\ntion.13 The rate-limiting enzymes related to the synthesis of\nneurotransmitters including dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-\nHT), and norepinephrine (NE) are highly oxygen-dependent\nand require sufficient oxygen for their optimal activity.14 Thus,\neven mild hypoxia could impact neurotransmitter synthesis,\npotentially altering neurophysiological function.13 Although\nthe brain works to maintain neuronal function despite the hy-\npoxic insult associated with altitude,15 a growing body of evi-\ndence demonstrates that the homeostasis of the neurotrans-\nmitter systems in the brain is altered in the course of time at\nhigh altitude. In preclinical studies, exposure to hypobaric hy-\npoxia for periods of 7 and 14 days has been reported to in-\ncrease DA levels and decrease 5-HT levels in the frontal lobe.16\nIt has also been shown that simulated altitude increases the\nlethality of methamphetamine, but does not affect the lethali-\nty of sympathomimetic amines that act peripherally rather than\nAltered functioning of brain DA and 5-HT systems may\nplay a role in MA use disorders. Psychostimulant abuse vul-\nnerability has been linked to chronic exposure to stress,18 per-\nsonality factors including sensation/novelty seeking and im-\ncharacterized by dopaminergic hyperactivity and/or seroto-\nnergic hypoactivity.23,24 Enhanced DA levels are also implicated\nin cross-behavioral sensitization between MA and cocaine.25\nCocaine and amphetamines are powerful psychostimulants\nthat cause euphoria, heightened alertness, increased energy\nand intensified emotions. These effects are mediated by in-\ncreased synaptic concentrations of monoamines including DA,\n5-HT, and NE.26,27 It is now well-established that the reinforc-\ning effect of drugs depends not only on striatal DA increases,\nbut on the rate of such increases.28 Given the cross-tolerance\nbetween MA and cocaine,29 the recognized effects of altitude\non DA levels and MA lethality, and our finding that altitude is\na predictor of cocaine use,30 we sought to investigate the pos-\nsibility of a relationship between altitude and MA use.\nThe majority of worldwide MA production and consump-\ntion now occurs in Southeast Asia and North America.31 With\nthe epidemiologic and potential neurobiological connections\nbetween high altitude of residence and MA use, we hypothe-\nsized that altitude would have a significant association with\nthe rate of MA use in the US In this study, we investigated the\nrelationship between the state-level MA and other substance\nuse data from National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NS-\nDUH) and mean state altitude in the US Also, to increase the\ncredibility of our hypothesis, we performed a multivariate re-\ngression analysis of MA use rate with mean altitude and previ-\nously reported risk factors affecting MA use5,32,33 by state level.\nMETHODS\nMethamphetamine use data\nState-level estimates of 12-month prevalence of MA use were\nand Health (NSDUH) report sponsored by the Substance\nAbuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMH-\nSA).34 The NSDUH provides national and state-level data on\nthe use of tobacco, alcohol, illicit drugs, and mental health\nvariables in the U.S. The NSDUH survey is annually conduct-\ned in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, and involves\ntelephone interviews with approximately 70,000 randomly\nselected individuals aged 12 and older. During the interval\nof the total population) aged 12 or older estimated using MA\nin the past year. The highest and lowest rates of state-level MA\ntively (Figure 1).\nAverage state altitude data\nAverage state-level altitude in the U.S. was calculated using\nthe Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) altitude data\nset.35 The SRTM dataset is a high-resolution global scale digital\ntopographic database of the Earth covering virtually entire\nland surface between \u00b160\u00b0 latitudes. With 0.1 km spatial reso-\nlution, the mean altitude of each county in the US can be ac-\ncurately calculated. County outlines from the National Atlas of\nthe United States (NAUS): County Boundaries of the United\nStates36 were used to obtain the mean county altitude based\nAltitude and Methamphetamine Use\non the SRTM mean altitude calculations for each square kilo-\nmeter. Four counties were not included in this NAUS data set;\none each in Montana and Georgia and two in Virginia. These\ncounties are not included in the analysis. The average altitude\nof each county (n=3108) in 48 contiguous states and the Dis-\ntrict of Columbia except Alaska and Hawaii was calculated\nusing zonal statistics in an ArcGIS/ArcInfo 9.3 environment\n(ESRI, Redlands, CA, USA). The ArcGIS/ArcInfo software is\na full-featured geographic information system for geographi-\ncal database mapping.

Gender as a\nconfounder was excluded from the analysis model because\nMA has been reported to appeal fairly equally to both men and\nvidual sociodemographic state-level variables, including: age\nunder 18 years; White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, and American\nIndian (AI) and Alaska Native (AN) populations; persons\naged 25 or over who are high school graduates; and median\nhousehold income.38 Average state unemployment rate data\nwas acquired from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) in the\nUnited States Department of Labor.39 State-level cocaine, hero-\nin, marijuana, alcohol, tobacco, and nonmedical prescription\npain reliever use rates were extracted from the NSDUH. The\nstate-level number of MA laboratory incidents in 2004 was\nextracted from the National Clandestine Laboratory Seizure\nSystem of Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) affiliated\nwith the US Department of Justice.40 Incidents entered into\nthis system are classified in one of three ways: Operational\nLaboratories, Chemical/Equipment/Glassware seizures, and\nDumpsites. The manufacturing and distribution of MA are\nlikely to reflect the number of MA laboratory incidents.

Thus, logarithmic (log) transformation of these\ndata was carried out before correlation and regression analy-\nlog transformation. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that\nthis change did not alter the results.\nPearson correlation coefficients were calculated to investi-\ngate the association between MA use rate and log trans-\nformed mean state altitude. A simple linear regression analy-\nsis was performed to analyze MA use rate as the dependent\nvariable, and transformed mean state altitude as the indepen-\ndent variable.\nTo increase confidence in the significance of our results, we\nperformed an additional analysis that controlled for the ef-\nfects of a number of possible covariates. Because this analysis\nincluded many covariates potentially associated with MA use\nrate compared to a total number of states (n=49),42 we per-\nformed a two-step analysis as follows: Pearson correlation\nanalysis was conducted between MA use rate and the follow-\ning state-level variables: mean altitude, population density,\npercentage under 18 year-old, percentage of White popula-\ntion, percentage of Black population, percentage of Hispanic\npopulation, percentage of AI and AN population, percentage\nof Asian population, median household income, persons aged\n25 or over who are high school graduates, unemployment rate\nof 16 years of age over, same sex couples per 1000 households,\nrate, heroin use rate, marijuana use rate, alcohol use rate, to-\nbacco use rate and nonmedical prescription pain relievers use\nrate. The variables which did not reach a significance level of\np<0.05 in relation to MA use were excluded from the model,\nand a multivariate linear regression analysis was conducted to\nanalyze the effect of significant variables from the prior cor-\nrelation analysis on the MA use rate.\nAll p-values are two-tailed, with p<0.05 considered statisti-\ncally significant. Statistical Analysis System (SAS), version 9.1\n(SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) was used for the compu-\ntation.\nRESULTS\nAs presented in Figure 2, there was a significant positive\ncorrelation between 12-month state-level MA use rate and\nmean state altitude (log-transformed) in the US (r=0.66, p<\n0.0001). Simple linear regression analysis using MA use rate\nas the dependent variable and mean state altitude as an inde-\npendent variable showed that state altitude (log-transformed)\n(Table 1). In this model, the adjusted R square value was 0.428,\nsuggesting that altitude accounts for a considerable propor-\ntion of the variance in regional variation in MA use.\nThe predictor variables that we found to be significantly re-\nlated to MA use included the following: mean state altitude\nlation density, percentage of White population, percentage of\nHispanic population (log-transformed), percentage of Asian\npopulation, median household income, persons aged 25 or\nover who are high school graduates, unemployment rate of\n16 years of age over, same sex couples per 1,000 households,\ncocaine use rate, marijuana use rate, alcohol use rate in the\npast month, tobacco use rate, and nonmedical prescription\npain relievers use rate did not reach significance in relation\nto MA use and were therefore excluded from the multivariate\nlinear regression analysis.

Furthermore, the published literature regarding MA risk\nfactors was reviewed, and available U.S. data for potential con-\nfounding variables was obtained and controlled for in these\nanalyses. To our knowledge, this is the first such report in this\narea. These analyses add to our previous findings of altitude's\nassociation with completed suicide, major depressive episodes,\nsuggest the need for further studies to investigate the mecha-\nnism of altitude's association with these clinical phenomena.\nA distinctive environmental characteristic of increased al-\ntitude is hypobaric hypoxia. Prolonged exposure to hypoxia\nmight lead to the changes in oxygen-dependent neurotrans-\nmission. Animal studies have demonstrated that prolonged\nexposure to hypobaric hypoxia causes elevation in DA and\nNE levels47 and increases the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase,\nwhich is the rate-limiting enzyme for catecholamine synthe-\nsis, in the cerebral cortex.48\nThere is increasing evidence showing that increased DA\nand decreased 5-HT levels in the brain may be linked to the\nvulnerability to cocaine and MA use. Chronic stress activates\nDA release and lowers 5-HT levels.49 Stress enhances craving\nfor cocaine or MA, resulting in increased relapse rate in hu-\nman drug abusers50,51 and increases the self-administration of\npsychostimulants in animal studies.18\nDopamine hyperactivity has been regarded as a mediating\nfactor in sensation- or novelty- seeking personality52 as well\nas impulsive behavior,23 both of which are risk factors for MA\nuse. Marusich et al.20 demonstrated that a multivariate assess-\nment reflecting individual differences in sensation-seeking\nand impulsivity predicted acquisition, maintenance, and dose-\neffect measurements of amphetamine self-administration in\nrats. Iritani et al.53 showed that novelty-seeking characteristics\nwere associated with greater likelihood of past year crystal\nMA use among young adults in the U.S. In addition, several\nclinical studies have suggested that MA users with a genetic\npredisposition toward elevated DA functioning are higher in\nDespite some controversies,54,55 previous epidemiological\nstudies have consistently suggested that high altitude of resi-\ndence might contribute to the increased incidence of psychi-\natric problems including suicide,46,56 severe psychological dis-\ntress and major depressive episodes,45 and cocaine abuse.30\nThese phenomena are also closely associated with alterations\nof DA and 5-HT levels in the brain.57,58 MA use among youth\nhas a consistent relationship with depression, and suicide likely\ncontributes to increased morbidity and mortality among MA\nusers.59 Further, positive correlations between MA use rate\nand mean state altitude are consistent with the increased rate\nof cocaine use, which has similar psychopharmacological\nproperties.\nOur finding that altitude of residence is a statistically sig-\nnificant predictor of MA use should be cautiously interpreted.\nPrevious studies have suggested that MA use is affected by\nage, ethnicity, education, socioeconomic level, employment,\nand other substance abuse.6,32,33 Gonzales et al.5 emphasized\nthat subpopulations including people who have same sex\npartners are at increased risk for MA use. In addition, MA\nlaboratory incidents implicating MA manufacture and distri-\nbution should be not overlooked as a contributing factor of the\nvariation in MA use.8 However, when we conducted addition-\nal analyses to control for the above variables, altitude remained\na significant contributing factor of MA use.\nSeveral limitations should be considered in interpreting our\nresults. First, this study was based on state-level data, resulting\nin a modest sample size. Although there is considerable be-\nTable 1.

However, at present, substate- or county-\nlevel MA use data is not available. Also, further studies are\nneeded to investigate the relationship altitude and MA use at\nthe individual level. Second, the relationship between altitude\nand MA use requires replication in other countries which have\ndifferent social and cultural environments, but similar geo-\ngraphic variation, compared to the US Third, neurobiologi-\ncal investigation of altitude and hypobaric hypoxia's connec-\ntion with MA use should be attempted in further studies.\nIn conclusion, we found that mean state altitude is positively\ncorrelated with the rate of MA use in the US and that this\nfinding is robust to statistical adjustment for all of the avail-\nable confounding variables. These results support the hypoth-\nesis that altitude accounts for a significant proportion of the\nregional variation of MA use in the US The available genetic\nepidemiology data indicate that environmental factors unique\nto each individual person determine which class of psycho-\nactive drug they will use or misuse.11 Increased use of MA at\naltitude could be mediated by the hypoxic stress response,\nwhich preclinical studies show causes neuroadaptation in\nboth brain DA levels and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal\naxis. Further studies are needed to determine if, and how, the\nchanges in neurotransmission resulting from altitude-associ-\nated hypobaric hypoxia play a role in MA use.\n"
