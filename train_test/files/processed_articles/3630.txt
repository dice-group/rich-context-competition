We provide a summary\nintroduction to the topic from the perspective of the visual arts.\nNote that we use the terms modal/amodal in a perhaps slightly unusual, generic sense. That\nis to say, we use amodal for any spatial element (such as a line or a contour) in visual awareness\nthat is not immediately specified by a corresponding spatial element in the stimulus. We prefer\nsuch a definition because it is objective. Thus, an amodal line is a perceived line (a quale), which\nis not immediately specified by some contrasting region, that is elongated in one direction,\nrather narrow in an orthogonal direction in the stimulus (a property of the image). Likewise, an\namodal contour is a perceived contour (a quale) for which there does not exist a relatively\nsharp, relatively straight transition between two more or less uniform, extended, and\ncontrasting regions in the stimulus (a property of the image). Apparently, ``illusory'' might be\nused interchangeably with ``amodal.'' However, we avoid this term because of unwanted\nconnotations (Koenderink, 2017). In case an amodal contour is seen as occluding, the\noccluded part would also be amodal, but in an ontologically different sense. This plays no\nrole in this experiment. For further terminological discussion, see van Lier and Gerbino (2015);\nPassages and Lost Contour\nIn planning an image, the artist typically starts with a rough design to settle the composition.\nThis would typically look like a simple abstract sketch (Figure 1). One thinks in terms of two\nor three tones (darks, lights, and perhaps mid-tones), disregarding the scarce pure whites and\nblacks. The latter would be added in a final state as a kind of spice, they are treated as\naccents. In contradistinction, the two or three major tones cover large areas. These areas\nshould be of simple shape, preferably connected and together they make up the major\ncomposition. One area will dominate the final picture, its shape is the macchia1 (or ta\n^ che)\ncentral (though slightly off) location since that ``attracts the eye.'' At that stage, one considers\nsuch things as dominating shapes, body shadows (mezzo-macchia, the ``bed bug line''2 or\n1986). They may be roughly sketched in. Perhaps surprisingly, edges may both unite abutting\nregions and serve to split them (Brentano's plerosis; Agostini & Galmonte, 2000; Brentano,\nOn this skeleton structure, one starts looking for possible ``passages'' that are bridges\nbetween mutually disjunct macchie of (usually) darks or (possibly) lights. One plans a\nscheme of edge qualities, including the ``lost and found'' edges (Cateura, 1995; Clifton,\n1973; Jacobs, 1986). Passages are a planned and important part of painting. Here, we meet\nwith the amodal contours.\nA passage is a lost edge. The edge is usually lost in a mysterious dark. An example would\nbe the unlit side of a face in a portrait that smoothly blends into a dark background or the\nunlit side of an object that merges with the object's cast shadow.\nLost and found contours often occur (or rather: are sought for, because nothing is a mere\nrandom coincidence in a painting, all is planned) in the case of roughly convex, volumetric\nbodies in front of some background (Koenderink et al., 2016). The body will have a lit and an\nunlit side (straddling the bed bug line), whereas the tonal gradients in the background are\nlargely to the artist's disposal. Some gradient will be planned that runs counter to the shading\nof the object, leading to places where the tone of the shading matches that of the background,\nthus causing the edge to be lost. The edge is soon ``found'' again, albeit in opposite polarity.\nOf course, the background has other functions, such as ``holding'' the dominant object in\ngripping darks, yielding an attractive pattern, and so forth. That is why a planning stage is a\nnecessity.\nThe artist assumes full control over the background, designing it so as to create the\nplanned passages and lost contours. Gripping or holding darks or lights tend to be\ndesigned, rather than found in the scene (if drawn from nature).\nThese are standard devices that are likely to play a role in virtually any painting. But, of\ncourse, there are many other ways to lose contours. The artist will always look for them or\ncreate possibilities for them. The reason is simple enough. Passages and lost contours engage\nthe creative vision of the observer of the work, thus they create interest and help\nfight boredom. Moreover, anything the spectator contributes (Gombrich's (1950)\n``beholder's share'') will be a major contribution to the work. There is no way the painter\nFigure 1. Some initial designs in pastels. Top left: contours lost and found through counter-shaded\nbackground. Top right: passage created through mysterious dark. Bottom left: passage created through merge\nof body and cast shadow. Bottom right: object held in gripping darks allows for creation of possibly useful\npassages.\nKoenderink et al. 3\ncould beat that in paint. Passages and lost contours add depth and atmosphere by setting the\nwork sharply apart from silhouettes, or the outlined areas in children's coloring books in\nwhich passages and lost contours are avoided and as a consequence look flat and boring.\nThe Experiment\nIn this experiment, we use three works that show rather extreme examples of lost contours\nthat are arrived at through very different techniques (Figure 2).\nThe first example uses occlusion of lines (a relatively rare technique, tricky to use), the\nsecond example uses a standard (though quite extreme) method of contours lost in\nmysterious darks, and the third example uses a (rather unique) method of losing a contour\nin a random texture. These by no means exhaust common techniques, and it would not be\nthat hard to find different examples for each of the three.\nIn the experiment, we try to find the lost contour as contributed by the awareness of a\nnumber of observers. Of course, there is no such a thing as ground truth, the contour is\n``seen,'' but it is not physically present in the work (Perky, 1910). We consider the following\ntwo major questions:\n(1) Can observers indeed hallucinate the missing contour at all? Are they coherent in their\nexperience over time?\n(2) Do observers mutually agree in these experiences? That is to say, does the artist succeed in\nletting various observers hallucinate the same, or at least similar, nonexisting contours?\nMethods\nStimuli\nThe stimuli were images of well-known artworks (Figure 2), downloaded from the Internet.\nWe will indicate them by way of the artist's names, that is Coles Phillips (or just Phillips), an\nFigure 2. Full versions of the art works used as stimuli. In the experiment, cutouts were used in order to\nmaximize the areas depending on their artistic effect (passages) on amodal contours. From left to right, Coles\nframe from his comics book ``Sin City'' (``The Hard Goodbye,'' Dark Horse Comics, Milwaukie, OR,\nAmerican illustrator (Schau, 1975; Tse, 2017), famous for his ``vanishing girls'' (due to use of\namodal contours); Fe\n\u00b4 lix Valloton (or just Valloton), Swiss painter and graphics artist\n(Ducrey, 1989), working mostly in Paris, well known for his use of mysterious blacks and\npassages in woodcuts; and Frank Miller (or just Miller), an American comics artist (Miller,\n2018), famous from the movie Sin City, well known for his use of lost contour in high-\ncontrast pen drawings.\nAll are prints, the Valloton possibly printed by the artist (a woodcut), the other two by the\nprinting press for the masses. Phillips probably used watercolor media3 (Quiller, 1986) and\ninks, Miller India Ink, the techniques are not important here. What is relevant is that all\nworks use only a few colors over large areas or in thin lines. There are no modulations as one\nwould find in oil painting, for instance.\nThe images were presented on a computer display on a dark background and were viewed\nfrom a normal viewing distance of ca. 40 cm. We used a MacBook Pro 1500 and performed the\nexperiment in a darkened room.\nObservers\nObservers were 22 (in their 20 s, about matched for gender) students (bachelor, master, and\nPhD) and postdocs from the University of Leuven (KU Leuven). They had no specific\nconnections with the visual arts, but were familiar with the conventional ``visual effects'' as\ndemonstrated in courses on perception.\nExperiment\nDesign\nThe stimuli were selected because of the presence of roughly vertical, isolated, rather long\namodal contours. This makes it possible to search for the location of the amodal contour\nalong a horizontal line. The task of the participants was to indicate this location (Guttman &\nKellman, 2004). We draw a thin horizontal line (orange) over the full width of the stimulus and\nput a small, but easily visible dot on it. The participant can use the mouse (using only its\nhorizontal position, there is no need to hit the dot) to move the dot and place it on the amodal\ncontour. If the position is judged satisfactory, the participant hits the ENTER key, which\nconcludes the setting. During the adjustment phase, the participant may press the SPACE\nbar to remove the horizontal line, the dot always remaining visible. Participants are asked to\ndo at least a hundred settings per stimulus and at most spend an hour on the total task.\nWe find that observers take about 5 seconds per setting (Figure 3). There is no real\ndifference in response times for the three stimuli, although the tasks appear rather different\nfrom each other in kind.\nIt was decided to perform measurements at random heights and to alternate between\nstimuli (in fixed order) at the conclusion of each setting. This has obvious advantages and\ndisadvantages. It also influences the possible ways of analysis. For instance, any given height\nis unlikely to reappear and participants do not visit the same heights.\nSelected raw results are presented in Figure 4. (Notice that the horizontal scale in the\nscatterplot has been expanded by a factor of three!)\nA few aspects are evident at first blush:\nFirst, if there is a ``real'' contour, all participants agree very precisely. Good examples are the\narm of the girl in the Phillips stimulus, the white collar of the man in the Valloton stimulus,\nand the arm of the person in the Miller stimulus.\nKoenderink et al. 5\nSecond, if there ``is no clue'' as to where the lost contour might be, settings clearly diverge\nvery significantly. A good example is the Valloton stimulus, where the region that contains\nthe amodal contour is just a uniform, solid black (an extreme example of a passage).\nInterestingly, individual participants produce well-defined contours, it is the location of\nthese contours that differs.\nThird, if there is pictorial ambiguity, as in the Miller stimulus, where the texture due to the\n``snow'' and the person's clothes intermingle, one spots both interobserver differences in\nlocation and intraobserver scatter.\nA formal analysis is provided here.\nAnalysis\nThere are many alternative ways to analyze the results formally. For the presentation used\nhere, we use only the simplest and most direct.\nFor an initial analysis,4 we divide the height of the contour into 24 slices, such that each\nslice contains a hundred settings. We consider the histograms of the settings (Figure 5).\nFigure 4. Raw results for the case of some selected observers. The horizontal scale has been magnified by a\nfactor of three for easy comparison. This yields a generic view of the results, all other observers are\nsomewhere in between these cases.\nFigure 3. Distribution of response times for the three stimuli. Observers take 5.5 seconds (median,\ninterquartile range: 4.3\u00ad7.9) per setting for the Phillips stimulus, 4.6 seconds (IQR: 3.6\u00ad6.1) for the Valloton\nstimulus, and 5.0 seconds (IQR: 3.8\u00ad6.8) for the Miller stimulus.\nConsider the Phillips stimulus (Figure 6). In the slices representing results for the arm, the\nstandard deviations are small, just a few pixels and participants agree very well. Evidently,\nthe contour is very well determined, because in this case, it is physically represented in the\nimage. It is of more immediate interest to consider the slices that represent the amodal\ncontour. Here, the standard deviations per observer are somewhat larger, of the order of\n10 pixels. The results for the various observers agree quite well, typically within a fraction of\nthe standard deviation per observer, for two of the slices just a little over that standard\ndeviation. Thus, the amodal contour is also well determined and very similar for all\nobservers.\nFor the Valloton stimulus (Figure 7), the case is different. Here, the actual contour is\nonly physically indicated at one point, the white collar of the man. Indeed, all observers\nagree quite well at that point. For most of the height range, there is no indication at all\nthough. Here, observers diverge quite a bit. It is interesting that they are individually\nquite coherent, whereas they mainly differ among each other. This is somewhat\nunderstandable in view of our own impression that the man has a sharp contour at the\nback side, although that contour is apparently lost in the mysterious black. The\nparticipants are likely to have similar impressions, their contours being quite well defined,\nalthough mutually rather distinct.\nFigure 5. Histograms in slices of height containing 100 settings each, pooled over all observers. (Optimal\nbin widths are automatically assigned by way of one-level recursive approximate Wand binning.) This yields a\nconcise overview of the structure of the data, especially the qualitative differences for the three cases are\nclearly exhibited.\nKoenderink et al. 7\nThe Miller case is different again (Figure 8). Here, the arm has a fairly well-defined\ncontour due to obvious pictorial cues, whereas the lower part of the legs region hardly\noffers much of a cue at all. This is worse than in the Valloton case because there is a\nmysterious texture instead of a mysterious black. It is obvious from the result that the\nparticipants indeed attempt to use that texture, but that they interpret it in different ways.\nA more quantitative analysis involves both the location of the contour and the spread.\nHere, we sample at 32 height levels (Figure 9). At each height, we select the 10 nearest (by\nheight, remember the heights are uniformly distributed random values) responses for each\nparticipant. We compute the median and the interquartile range (IQR) of the horizontal\nlocations for each observer.\nThe IQR of the set of individual medians for each participant is a measure of the\ninterobserver variability. It is plotted as the blue bars in Figure 9. The median of the set\nof individual IQRs for each participant is a measure of the intraobserver variability. It is\nplotted as the red bars in Figure 9. The length of the red bars is a measure of individual\nvariability. The length of the blue bars is a measure of the variability over participants.\nFigure 7. Full range and quartiles for all observers, for two selected heights (720 and 350 pixels, see\nFigure 5) and the Valloton stimulus. Observers have been sorted by the median in the plot at right. Both plots\nhave the same horizontal scale. The left height is at the white collar, the right height at about halfway the\nheight of the figure.\nFigure 6. Full range and quartiles for all observers, for two selected heights (610 and 250 pixels, see\nFigure 5) and the Phillips stimulus. Observers have been sorted by the median in the plot at right. Both plots\nhave the same horizontal scale. The left height is at the arm, the right height at the middle part of the skirt.\nWhen the red bars are equal or larger than the blue bars, the responses of the participants\nmutually agree. When the blue bars are larger than the red bars, this signifies that the\nparticipants widely disagree among each other.\nNotice that the scales are very different for the data plotted in Figure 9:\nFor the Phillips case, the maximum of the medians of the IQRs (red bars) is 41 pixels, whereas\nthe maximum of the IQRs of the medians (blue bars) is 19 pixels.\nFigure 9. An analysis of the spread as a function of height. The red bars are the median of the interquartile\nranges over all participants, and the blue bars are the interquartile range of the medians of the locations over\nall participants. The length of the bars is given in terms of pixels (the height of the stimuli is 850 pixels). Notice\nthat the scales are very different for the three cases!\nFigure 8. Full range and quartiles for all observers, for two selected heights (600 and 80 pixels, see\nFigure 5) and the Miller stimulus. Observers have been sorted by the median in the plot at right. Both plots\nhave the same horizontal scale. The left height is at the arm, the right height very low in the image. (In the left\nplot, one spots the effect of an outlier due to the fact that an observer continued to the next trial without\nhaving completed the present one: We did not remove any of the (very few) outliers in this study.)\nKoenderink et al. 9\nFor the Valloton case, the maximum of the medians of the IQRs (red bars) is 21 pixels,\nwhereas the maximum of the IQRs of the medians (blue bars) is 25 pixels.\nFor the Miller case, the maximum of the medians of the IQRs (red bars) is 97.5 pixels,\nwhereas the maximum of the IQRs of the medians (blue bars) is 112.5 pixels.\nThese plots (Figure 9) yield an excellent overview of the results, especially when combined\nwith the examples of individual data presented in Figure 4.\nFor the Phillips stimulus, the locations per observer are well defined; moreover, the spread\nof locations over observers is even less than the spread per participant. Apparently, all\nobservers consider this amodal contour somehow well defined and they mutually agree on\nits location. This neatly fits expectations from vision science (Kanizsa, 1955; Soriano,\nIn contradistinction, for the Valloton stimulus the locations are idiosyncratic, the spread\nover observers being larger than the spread per individual participant. Apparently, all\nobservers consider this amodal contour reasonably well defined, but they do not mutually\nagree on exactly where it is. Here, we deal essentially with a hallucination, no doubt based on\nFor the Miller stimulus, we see a mixed case. In the range of the upper arm, it resembles\nthe Phillips case, in the range of the legs, the Valloton case. In the latter range, observers are\nindividually very uncertain and they also differ a lot among each other (compare Figure 4,\nright).\nConclusions\nWe determined amodal contours for several observers in three art works. The works are\nmutually quite different, and we indeed find striking differences in responses. In the visual\narts, creators of drawings, paintings, . . . , count on the ``beholder's share'' (Gombrich, 1950)\nand intentionally use passages, lost edges, and lost-and-found contours, counting on the\nviewer to provide amodal elements (Kandinsky, 1926). Such amodal elements often differ\nin kind from the amodal elements routinely encountered in vision science (Craik, 1966;\nKanizsa, 1955; Soriano, Spillmann, & Bach, 1996). In this experiment, only one instance\n(the Phillips image) is somewhat close to a familiar case regarded in vision science. Another\ncase (the Valloton image) requires what might perhaps more properly be called hallucination\nthan amodal completion based on scattered visual cues--there are none of the latter. Yet it is\nthe case perhaps most commonly encountered in the visual arts, a passage created through a\nmysterious black.\nOf course, the images taken from the arts differ from the standard vision science examples\nin that they have strong semantic content. Such content is not entirely lacking in the latter\ncase though, there the visual objects tend to be familiar geometrical objects such as straight\nlines (e.g., Kanizsa's abutting gratings) or regular polygons (e.g., Kanizsa's triangle). In both\ncases, familiarity is also quite likely to play a role.\nFrom the perspective of vision science, it is perhaps interesting to take note of the fact that\nthe visual arts use amodal elements intentionally and profusely and that the range of\nqualitatively different types most likely exceeds that of the types considered by vision\nscientists. Of course, such amodal elements in the arts are less conspicuous than those in\nscience. Whereas the latter are often presented as demos, the former tend to be artfully\nhidden. They are part of the artist's toolbox.\nFrom the perspective of the arts, it is of interest to note that amodal elements may well\nlead to very different visions in spectators. This is not necessarily a bad thing and indeed is\nmore often considered to enrich a work. However, it is no doubt of interest to be aware of the\nspectrum of possible visual readings.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or\npublication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or\npublication of this article: The work was supported by the program of the Flemish Government\n(METH/14/02, awarded to Johan Wagemans). Jan Koenderink was supported by the Alexander von\nHumboldt Foundation.\nNotes\n1. Macchia (plural macchie) literally means ``blotch,'' ``patch,'' ``spot.'' For the macchiaioli, the term\nhad various relevant connotations, one of these was the implication of a sketchy, or unfinished\nlook--which was actually sought for. Another was a reference to plein-air painting (in many\nrespects, the macchiaioli were protoimpressionists--roughly a decade ahead of Monet; Boime,\n``darsi alla macchia'' meaning something like ``hiding in the bushes.'' Here, we intend only the use of\nblocky color.\n2. On this technical term, in common use in the visual arts, see https://www.sightsize.com/articles/\nbeware-of-the-bed-bug-line/ and https://gurneyjourney.blogspot.com/2010/02/light-and-form-part-\n3. A reviewer read this as ``watercolor painting'' (or aquarelle) implying paints without white filler,\nusing the color of the paper for ``white.'' Here, we intend any medium using some glue in water as\nsolvent, instead of oils or acrylic medium. This includes gouache, casein, and so forth, in which cases\nwhite pigment is mixed in the binder to increase opacity. In this case, we would guess that Phillips\nused a kind of gouache, which is ideal and often used for illustration purposes.\n4. In this analysis, we largely ignore the parts in which the contour was not approximately vertical. This\nmainly occurs in shoulder areas. Taking obliquity into account would unnecessarily complicate the\ndiscussion.\n5. This includes familiarity with the draped human figure, of course. However, there are also a variety\nof generic structures of an abstract nature. For instance, elongated objects are bounded by (among\nmore) two ``parallel'' contours, one on each side. These contours are never geometrically parallel, but\nthey certainly correspond in some way, a way that tends to suggest properties of the volume bounded\nby them. There is quite a bit of lore in the arts on how to treat such contour pairs. They should\n``echo'' each other in various exciting ways (avoiding ``garden hose'' or ``sausage'' looks) and are\nnecessarily treated as a pair. To treat them as separate items immediately shows up the artist as of\nlesser understanding. If one of a pair is missing, it still echoes the visible one.\nReferences\nAgostini, T., & Galmonte, A.
