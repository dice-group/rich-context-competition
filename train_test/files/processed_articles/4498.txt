    "abstract": "Abstract: Body height influences human mate preferences and choice. A typical finding in\nWestern societies is that women prefer men who are taller than themselves and,\nequivalently, men prefer women who are shorter than themselves. However, recent reports\nin non-Western societies (e.g., the Himba in Namibia) challenge the view on the\nuniversality of such preferences. Here we report on male and female height preferences in\ntwo non-Western populations--the Hadza (Tanzania) and the Tsimane' (Bolivia)--and the\nrelationships between body height preferences and the height of actual partners. In the\nHadza, most individuals preferred a sexual dimorphism in stature (SDS) with the man\nbeing much taller than the woman. Preferences for SDS and actual partner SDS were\npositively and significantly correlated in both men and women, suggesting that people who\npreferred larger height differences also had larger height differences with their partners. In\nthe Tsimane', the majority of men preferred an SDS with the man being taller than the\nwoman, but women did not show such a preference. Unlike in the Hadza, SDS preference\nwas not significantly correlated to actual partner SDS. We conclude that patterns of height\npreferences and choices in the Hadza and Tsimane' are different than those observed in\nWestern societies, and discuss possible causes for the observed differences between non-\nWestern and Western societies.\nSDS choice and preferences in Hadza and Tsimane'\n",

Body height preferences have been assessed through experimental studies (Graziano\net al., 1978; Shepperd and Strathman, 1989), investigations of lonely-hearts advertisements\n(Cameron et al., 1977; Lynn and Shurgot, 1984), and speed-dating settings (Kurzban and\nWeeden, 2005; Stulp, Buunk, and Pollet, 2013). The general result of these studies is that\nin Western societies men prefer women of average height and women prefer tall men as\npossible mating partners (Courtiol, Raymond, Godelle, and Ferdy, 2010; Stulp, Buunk, and\nRather than looking at absolute height, other studies have focused on preferences\nfor height difference between an individual and his/her partner in a romantic relationship\n(i.e., sexual dimorphism in stature, SDS = male height/female height). Although a positive\nassortative preference has been reported for height preferences in Western societies (i.e.,\ntaller individuals tend to prefer taller partners; Courtiol, Raymond, et al., 2010; Stulp,\nBuunk, Pollet, Nettle, et al., 2013), it has also been shown that both men and women have a\npreference for SDS such that a woman is shorter than a man (Fink et al., 2007; Pawlowski,\nBuunk, Verhulst, and Pollet, 2013). Both men and women prefer moderate SDS with men\nbeing slightly taller than women, and a maximum acceptable SDS of about a 17%\ndifference in height (Salska et al., 2008). Moreover, SDS preferences are dependent on\nheight in that taller men and shorter women prefer larger height difference than do shorter\nmen and taller women, possibly because this increases the pool of potential partners\nAlthough these findings have been observed and replicated in a variety of Western\npopulations (e.g., Courtiol, Raymond, et al., 2010; Stulp, Buunk, Pollet, Nettle, et al.,\n2013), giving some validity to the hypothesis that SDS preferences are consistent across\nWestern societies, it is yet unclear if they can be generalized to non-Western societies.\nRecent studies on SDS preferences in non-Western societies argue against the universality\nof such an effect. For example, Sorokowski, Sorokowska, Fink, and Mberira (2012) report\nthat in the Himba of northern Namibia, more than 30% of the individuals preferred an SDS\nwhere partners were of equal height. Moreover, more than 20% of men chose women taller\nthan themselves. Another study in a non-Western society, the Yali of Papua, concluded that\nmen and women did not rely on SDS when evaluating an opposite-sex individual as a\npotential mate (Sorokowski and Sorokowska, 2012). Finally, in Datoga of Tanzania, both\nmen and women preferred \"extreme\" SDS; i.e., men and women preferred partners either\nmuch taller or much shorter than themselves (Sorokowski and Butovskaya, 2012).\nSDS choice and preferences in Hadza and Tsimane'\nTogether, these results suggest that SDS preferences in traditional societies are\nsubstantially different from those observed in Western societies (see Table 1). However,\nmost of these studies have relied on preferred rather than actual SDS between partners, thus\nraising the question about the correspondence between these two. In other words, do\npeople's preferences for body height in opposite-sex mating partners correlate with one\nanother?\nGillis and Avis (1980) showed that in a Western society, husbands are more likely\nto be taller than their wives than would be expected by chance (see also Stulp, Buunk,\nVerhulst, et al., 2013), which is at least consistent with earlier mentioned height\npreferences. The evidence is, however, much more mixed when examining non-Western\nsamples. In Gambia and among the Hadza, in approximately 10% of all marriages the wife\nwas taller than the husband, which was not significantly different from chance, suggesting\nthat height played less of a role in partner choice in these populations (Sear, 2006; Sear,\nAllal, and Mace, 2004; Sear and Marlowe, 2009). Thus, as was the case for the SDS\npreferences, patterns of actual SDS in married opposite-sex partners seen in Western\npopulations are not necessarily observed in non-Western societies and cannot be regarded\nas universal (e.g., Sear and Marlowe, 2009).\nThe observed differences with respect to partner height preferences and mating\npatterns between Western and non-Western populations, and the variation between non-\nWestern populations (e.g., Sorokowski et al., 2012; Sear and Marlowe, 2009), raises the\nquestion as to why these between-population differences exist. Before such a question can\npotentially be answered (see discussion for potential reasons), it is necessary to first\ndocument height preferences and mating patterns from many different non-Western\npopulations. In the present study, we sought to investigate SDS preferences and patterns of\npartners' actual SDS in couples in two traditional societies: the Hadza of northern Tanzania\nand the Tsimane' of Bolivia. In addition to the investigation of possible differences\nbetween SDS preferences in these two societies compared to those reported in Western\nsocieties, we examined the relationship between SDS preferences and actual SDS between\npartners in order to determine how much preferred mate characteristics align with actual\nmate characteristics.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\nThe Hadza of Tanzania. The Hadza are a hunter-gatherer society living in Tanzania.\nThey number approximately 1,000\u00ad1,500 individuals and live in mobile camps, each\ncomprising 30 people on average. This society has been extensively described in the\ntypically marry between 17 and 18 years of age, and men marry around the age of 20.\nMarriages are typically not arranged. Female choice seems to be the main factor leading to\nmarriage because young single men appear willing to marry a wide range of women.\nBecause divorce is common, serial monogamy is the best way to characterize the mating\napproximately 4% of men have two wives, polygynous marriages in Hadza are in most\ncases a transitory state. In most cases, such polygynous marriages are not stable.\nSDS choice and preferences in Hadza and Tsimane'\nTable 1.

The height of\nall participants was measured by one of the authors (MB) using a portable anthropometer. Age\nwas self-reported, although some participants did not know exactly how old they were.\nThe Tsimane' from Bolivia. The Tsimane' are a native Amazonian society of farmer-\nforagers. Their population of around 8,000 is distributed throughout approximately 100\nvillages, most of which are in the area of Beni in northern Bolivia. This tribe has been\nextensively described in the literature (e.g., Godoy et al., 2005; Huanca, 2008; Ringhofer,\nThe participants inhabited the region near the Maniqui River and lived in the villages of\nMaracas, Puerto Yucumo, Campo Bello, Catumare, and Anachere. Each participant's height\nwas measured using a portable anthropometer. All measurements were taken by the principal\ninvestigators (PS, AS). Some of the participants did not take part in all stages of the study (e.g.,\nfor some individuals we lack information about the height of the partner, because that partner\nwas not present in the village at the time of the study). Age was self-reported.\nThe marital customs in the Tsimane' have been described in detail (e.g., Winking,\nGurven, and Kaplan, 2011). Similar to other native Amazonian societies, the Tsimane' still\npractice cross-cousin marriage. Traditionally, marriage is arranged by parents. However, in our\nsample only 29% of participants declared that their marriage was arranged. Nevertheless, these\nmeasures should be used with some caution as partners did not always agree on this, and\nrespondents were not always entirely sure, given the long time it took them to answer. Rest\nassured, in this population, the parental influence on marriage is strong (Gurven, Winking,\nKaplan, von Rueden, and McAllister, 2009).\nProcedure\nThe data were collected through individual interviews conducted by the authors (MB\namong Hadza; AS and PS among Tsimane') with the help of a Tsimane' translator who was\nfluent in Spanish and a Hadza translator fluent in English. We used stimuli described in\nSorokowski and Butovskaya (2012), which were slightly modified versions of silhouettes used\nby Pawlowski (2003). Although the stimuli are not ideal, they were used in previous studies\nsocieties (Sorokowski and Butovskaya, 2012; Sorokowski and Sorokowska, 2012; Sorokowski\net al., 2012), and they ensure direct comparability with previous work.\nThe participants were shown six pairs of silhouettes, each pair with a different SDS (see\nFigure 1; participants were shown the version without the letters). For every pair, the size of\nthe image of the man remained unchanged, but the body of the woman from the original pair\n(SDS = 1.09) was shortened or elongated (without manipulating her width) to obtain SDS\nratios ranging from 1.19 (i.e., the man being much taller than the woman) to 0.96 (i.e., the\nwoman being slightly taller than the man). The ratios decreased in increments of about .05. In\nall silhouettes, the size of the head remained unchanged.\nParticipants were told that each pair represented partners in a romantic relationship and\nthat the pairs of partners differed in their body heights. They were asked to choose the pair they\nwould prefer in their own relationship (preferred SDS). Participants were then requested to\nprovide information on their partner's height (actual SDS). In the Hadza sample, participants\nchose the pair from SDS stimuli set which depicted their current relationship; in the Tsimane'\nsample, we measured the actual height of the partner. Additionally, to examine the general\nvalidity of the SDS stimuli that we used in both studies, we also collected the data on\nSDS choice and preferences in Hadza and Tsimane'\nperception of the actual SDS for a subsample of Tsimane' men and women (similarly as\ndescribed for the Hadza). We correlated the participants' perception of their actual SDS (six\ncategories; see Figure 1) with the measured SDS between the partners (raw, uncategorized\ndata), resulting in a strong and significant correlation, r(105) = .66, p < .0001 (Spearman's rank\ncorrelation was identical). This suggests that judgments of a couple's actual SDS on the basis\nof our stimuli were reliable (note that because participants necessarily had to approximate their\nSDS given the limited range of categories to choose from, and the categories presented do not\ncover all possible SDSs, there is a degree of unavoidable measurement error in these\nassessments. This means that we should not expect a perfect correlation between perceived and\nactual SDS). In the few polygynous marriages (three men had two wives, who in all cases were\nsisters), we collected information about both partners. In general, the Hadza and Tsimane' were\nable to comprehend the questions easily.\nFigure 1. Six pairs of human outlines with different levels of sexual dimorphism in size\nAnalyses\nWe performed separate analyses for each sex and each population. We did so because:\n1) we wished to facilitate comparison with previous studies that followed a similar analysis\nstrategy; 2) we could not use parametric analysis methods because of the distribution of our\nvariables; and 3) the methods used differed slightly between our study populations.\nChi-squared tests were used to assess the findings based on the stimuli due to their\ncategorical nature. Sex differences were analyzed using Mann-Whitney U tests, and Spearman\nrank correlations (rs) were used to test for association between two variables.\nSDS choice and preferences in Hadza and Tsimane'\nResults\nHadza preferences for SDS\n= 151.44; SD = 5.89). Therefore, similarly to all previously investigated populations, body\nheight is sexually dimorphic in the Hadza, with men being on average 7% taller than women.\nFrom the 74 male participants, the majority (32%) preferred the highest SDS (1.19),\nindicating a preference for relationships in which the man is much taller than the woman. Many\nthe men, the majority of female participants (38%) preferred the highest SDS (1.19). From the\n54 women, a considerable number preferred a relationship in which the SDS was 1.14 (11%),\npreferred (7%) (see Figure 2). In both men and women, the distribution of height preferences\nmostly preferred an SDS such that the man was much taller than the woman.\nWhen examining the correlation between one's own height and preferred SDS, we\nwas related to the preference for SDS in Hadza.\nFigure 2. Frequencies (%; left Y-axis) of preferred SDS for Hadza men (white bars) and\nwomen (grey bars)\nNote: Circle (mean) and error bars (\u00b1 SE) reflect actual SDS (right Y-axis)\nSDS choice and preferences in Hadza and Tsimane'\nThe association between preferences and actual partner height among the Hadza\nNext, we investigated the patterns of (perceived) actual SDS among couples (obtained\nthrough the use of the stimuli), examining data from 62 married men and 52 married women.\nThe majority of male participants (32%) reported to be in marriages with the highest SDS\n1.00 (13%), or 0.96 (7%) were all lower in frequency. The patterns as reported by the married\nwomen were very similar to those reported by the married men. The majority of female\nparticipants (33%) reported to be in marriages with the highest SDS (1.19). Fewer women were\n(15%), or 0.96 (12%). Thus, marriages were reported to most likely occur when the SDS was\nvery large, which is at odds with the average SDS of 1.07 in this population (see Discussion).\nWhen examining the association between an individual's preferences and actual partner\nheight, we found a positive correlation in both men (rs[62] = .40, p < .001) and women (rs[52]\n= .49, p < .0001). This suggests that in both men and women, those people who preferred large\nSDS were also in marriages with large SDS.\nTsimane' preferences for Sexual Dimorphism in Stature\nheight is sexually dimorphic in the Tsimane', with men being on average 7% taller than\nwomen.\nFor 14 women and 9 men we were unable to record their height preferences. From the\n(27%). A relatively high percentage of participants also preferred an SDS of 1.14 (20%). A\nThus, Tsimane' men generally preferred to be taller than their wives, with the largest SDS most\npreferred. From the 56 women, the highest percentage (23%) preferred an SDS of 1.0,\nindicating a preference for relationships in which the man and the woman are of the same\nheight. Furthermore, a considerable proportion of females preferred romantic relationships in\ndistribution of preferences for SDS was significantly different from uniform. Furthermore,\nthere was a significant difference in median SDS preference between the sexes (Mann-Whitney\nU = 1117, z = -3.06, p < .01). Thus, these results suggest that men are more consistent in their\npreferences, and that they prefer on average a larger difference in height between themselves\nand their partner than women do.\nSimilar to the Hadza, there was no significant correlation between an individual's\nSDS choice and preferences in Hadza and Tsimane'\nFigure 3. Frequencies (%; left Y-axis) of preferred SDS for Tsimane' men (white bars) and\nwomen (grey bars)\nNote: Circle (mean) and error bars (\u00b1 SE) reflect actual SDS (measured; right Y-axis)\nThe association between preferences and actual partner height among the Tsimane'\nWhen examining the heights of married individuals, we found no evidence for\nassortative mating for height, as evidenced by the non-significant correlation between partner\nheights (rs[76] = .11, p = .35). In total, we observed three couples out of 76 in which the\nwoman was taller than the man. Based on the SDS of all partnered individuals, we found that\nPreferences for SDS did not reflect actual partner height in Tsimane' women (rs[54] = -\nwomen that also judged their actual SDS using our stimuli, we also found that preferred SDS\n.78). Thus, preferences were not related to partner height.\nIn contrast to the Hadza, we observed that the estimates of actual SDS assessed via\nstimuli were in line with the average measured SDS of 1.07 in this population, and more\ngenerally with the shape of the distribution based on the measured SDSs: 30% of participants'\nanswered that they were in a marriage in which SDS was perceived to be 1.09. A large number\nDiscussion\nIn the present study, we sought to investigate SDS (Sexual Dimorphism in Stature)\npreferences and patterns of partners' actual SDS in couples in two traditional societies--the\nHadza of northern Tanzania and the Tsimane' of Bolivia. Our findings show that preferred\nheight differences are different in these populations compared to previous reports on Western\nSDS choice and preferences in Hadza and Tsimane'\nand Strathman, 1989; Stulp, Buunk, Pollet, Nettle, et al., 2013; Stulp, Buunk, Verhulst, et al.,\nIn nomadic foragers from the native Tanzanian Hadza tribe, both men and women most\noften preferred the SDS with the man being much taller than the woman in the couple (but see\nthe limitations), and men and women were similar in their most preferred SDS. Furthermore,\nan individual's height did not predict their preferred partner height. We did observe that\npreferred height differences were associated with (perceived) actual partner height differences\nin both men and women, suggesting that those who preferred a larger SDS also were in a\nrelationship with a relatively large SDS. Interestingly, in a previous study conducted in the\nHadza, Sear and Marlowe (2009) reported no evidence of a male-taller norm in this tribe, but\nthey have been collecting their data since 1995, so there might have been some cultural\nchanges with this regard during the last 20 years.\nPreferences for SDS among the Tsimane', foragers and farmers living in the Amazon,\nwere different to those observed among the Hadza (and again different to those observed in\nWestern societies). Whereas partner stature did not seem to be important for women's mate\npreference (the observed pattern of preferences was not different from random), men did seem\nto value height in their partner, with the majority of male participants (36%) preferring the\nlargest partner height differences. Consequently, men preferred a larger SDS than women. Like\nin the Hadza, an individual's height was not associated with preferred SDS. Moreover, and\nunlike the case in the Hadza, preferred SDS did not predict spousal SDS.\nAlthough the preferences for very large SDS in Hadza men and women and Tsimane'\nmen are different to typical patterns observed in Western countries (e.g., Pawlowski, 2003), the\nfact that the preferred SDS by men is generally so that the male is taller than the female is at\nleast consistent. The lack of clear height preferences in Tsimane' women, however, is\ninteresting and again at odds with those found in Western populations. We speculate that\nmarriage patterns may account for this result. In the Tsimane', parental influence on children's\nmarital decisions is stronger in the case of daughters compared to sons (Gurven et al., 2009).\nWomen may thus appear to be less selective in terms of preferences for partner height because\nthey have less influence over their choice of marriage partners than in Western populations. In\nother words, Tsimane' women's preferences may be masked to a certain degree.\nAdditionally, an overview of published findings from small-scale societies (including\nthe data of this present study) shows that partner height preferences in monogamous societies\n(e.g., Hadza and Baka) are more similar to those observed in Western societies than in\n\"extremely\" polygynous societies like the Datoga, or Yali (see Table 1). We suggest that in\nsocieties where partners are free to choose their partners, women's height preferences might\ntend towards a preference for taller men, whereas this preference might not be observed in\nother societies, including polygynous societies with significant wealth stratification or when\nspouses are predominantly selected by relatives. We do note, however, that very few studies on\nthis topic have actually been published (see Table 1), and our conclusions thus should be\ntreated with a degree of caution.\nA similar pattern of results like those observed in Western societies may also be present\nin societies where height is related to measures of social status and physical strength, as is the\ncase for those Western populations (e.g., Judge and Cable, 2004; Sorokowski, 2010; Stulp,\nBuunk, Kurzban, et al., 2013), in which taller men are also perceived as being more dominant,\nhaving higher status, being more intelligent, and being healthier (Chu and Geary, 2005;\nJackson and Ervin, 1992; Melamed, 1992). In the Tsimane' adults, there is no association\nSDS choice and preferences in Hadza and Tsimane'\nbetween height and perceptions of dominance and intelligence (Undurraga et al., 2012).\nAccording to Godoy et al. (2010), height is furthermore not associated with income or wealth\nin this society. Consequently, height may be less important as a trait affecting mate choice in\nthis population, which could explain why women did not express any clear height preference in\na potential partner. Similar reasoning might also hold for other populations (e.g., Yali) where\nno clear SDS preferences were observed (see Table 1).\nWe also examined the relationship between preferred SDS and actual SDS. In the\nHadza, there was a positive correlation between preferred and actual SDS, suggesting that in\nthis population mate preferences might influence mate choice. Among Tsimane', however,\npreferred SDS did not correlate with actual SDS. Thus, preferred height differences did not\nnoticeably relate to actual partner height differences. One reason for the existence of this effect\nin the Hadza, but its absence in the Tsimane', is that in the latter population marriage partners\nare substantially influenced by parents (Gurven et al., 2009). Although there may be conflicts\nbetween parents and offspring about the most appropriate partner (Apostolou, 2008; van den\nBerg, Fawcett, Buunk, and Weissing, 2013), it is difficult to predict how \"preferences\" among\nindividuals and their parents diverge in this population. Nonetheless, it is certain that because\nof the parental influence, the choice of partner is more constrained in the Tsimane' than the\nchoice of Hadza men and women. Another reason why preferred SDS was not associated with\nactual SDS among Tsimane', may be the limited number of mate options (Wolanski and\nSiniarska, 1984) in this society. A man mostly chooses a partner from his cousins (Winking et\nal., 2011). Finally, characteristics other than height may be much more important when\nselecting a mate (Stulp, Buunk, and Pollet, 2013).\nAnother possible explanation of the between-population differences with respect to\npartner height preferences and mating patterns may be the fact that the relationship between\nheight, health, and survival is dependent on the environment (Godoy et. al., 2010; Sear, 2010;\nStulp and Barrett, in press). For instance, life history theory predicts that in ecologies with high\nmortality and scarcity of resources, more energy should be invested in reproduction rather than\ngrowth, and shorter rather than taller individuals may have an advantage in such populations\n(Walker et al., 2006). However, comparing the Hadza with the Datoga (see Table 1), two\nneighboring populations, we find remarkably different SDS preferences. Given that these tribes\nlive in very similar ecological conditions but are culturally very distinct--the Datoga are\npolygynous pastoralists, and the Hadza are serially monogamous nomadic foragers--these\ndivergent preferences may be due to differences in cultural practices (e.g., traditions, mating\nsystems, economy) rather than ecological conditions.\nWe note some limitations of our study. First, the stimuli used may have resulted in\nbiased measures of actual SDS between partners in the Hadza. Indeed, both when choosing\ntheir preferred SDS (see Figure 1) and when indicating their actual SDS, most men and women\nindicated a rather large difference. For instance, 63% of men and 56% of women indicated that\ntheir actual SDS was between 1.09 and 1.19. Given that the average SDS in this population\nequals 1.07, the large proportion of respondents reporting these higher values suggests that\nHadza men and women may have perceived our stimuli or our questions differently to other\npopulations. Alternatively, our Hadza sample may have been biased towards couples with large\nSDS. There are two important things to note here, however: First, although there may have\nbeen biases in perception, these are unlikely to explain the correlation between mate\npreferences for SDS and actual SDS in men and women; second, similar limitations were not\nobserved in the Tsimane'. In the latter sample, the perceived SDS between partners was in line\nSDS choice and preferences in Hadza and Tsimane'\nwith the average SDS and its distribution in that population. Moreover, perceived partner SDS\nwas strongly associated with measured partner SDS, suggesting that, in the Tsimane' sample,\npreferences for SDS are reliable. Another limitation is that, although we interpreted the\nassociation between preferred SDS and actual SDS in the Hadza as a correspondence between\npartner preferences and choice, we cannot rule out the possibility that partner characteristics\ninfluence partner preferences (see Courtiol, Picq, et al., 2010 for a discussion).\nWe suggest that height preferences in (small-scale) societies may best be interpreted as\na compromise between the costs and benefits associated with male and female body height,\nrelating to reproduction, individual well-being, and survival. Because of different ecological\nand social pressures, height preferences may vary among foragers, traditional pastoralists, and\nfarmers. In some societies, height in men is associated with dominance and status, which may\nfacilitate male reproductive success and have an impact on female preferences. Power\nasymmetries between the genders, in equalities in wealth, pathogen loads, and access to\nmodern medicine might be additional factors that help explain height preferences.\nDocumenting further variation in height preferences across distinct populations is required\nbefore any reliable conclusions can be drawn regarding how patterns of height preference co-\nvary with ecological and social circumstances.\n"
