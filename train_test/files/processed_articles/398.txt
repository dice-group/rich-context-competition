Using nationally representative data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health\ncollected at 3 visits during 1994\u00ad2002, the authors evaluated the longitudinal association between birth weight and\nlater obesity in a traditional cohort study (n \u00bc 13,763; ages 11\u00ad21 years at baseline), controlling for sex, age, race/\nethnicity, and parental education. Among persons with a nonobese mother, high birth weight (>4 kg) participants\nwere more likely than normal birth weight (!2.5\u00ad 4 kg) participants to become obese later in life (incidence rate\nzygotic twins: n \u00bc 207; dizygotic twins: n \u00bc 189), the authors examined longitudinal within-pair differences. Birth\nweight difference was positively associated with body mass index difference later in life for female monozygotic\npairs only (b \u00bc 2.67, 95% confidence interval: 0.99, 4.35). Given the null associations observed in the sibling\nsample, the commonly observed positive association between birth weight and later obesity from cohort analyses\nmay be attributed to confounding by maternal characteristics. Further research is needed to identify specific factors\nthat contribute to the birth weight\u00adobesity relation.\nbirth weight; cohort studies; longitudinal studies; obesity; siblings; twins\nAbbreviations: Add Health, National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health; BMI, body mass index.\nObesity, a complex, multifactorial disease with genetic and\nenvironmental etiology (1, 2), continues to be a major and\nglobal public health concern. Early-life factors such as in-\ntrauterine growth may contribute to the development of obe-\nsity (3, 4). Birth weight, an indicator of intrauterine growth, is\nassociated with childhood and adult obesity (5\u00ad14). Investi-\ngators in most cohort studies report a positive association,\nwhile others observe U-shaped or null associations (7\u00ad15).\nEnvironmental and genetic factors may underlie the asso-\nciation between birth weight and size later in life (16). One\nhypothesis suggests that persons who experience an adverse\nintrauterine environment may metabolically and physiologi-\ncally adapt to enhance survival early in life (17, 18); however,\nthese adaptations may increase risk of later obesity in an\nobesogenic postnatal environment. In addition, intrauterine\nexposure to excess glucose via gestational diabetes and/or\novernutrition may increase fetal insulin production and\nchange pancreatic and brain development, resulting in in-\ncreased birth size and altered postnatal body composition\n(19\u00ad22). Alternatively, a common genotype may influence\nboth birth weight and later obesity (23). The complex inde-\npendent and joint influences of intrauterine environmental\nand genetic factors on later size remain poorly understood.\nSibling and twin study designs offer a unique opportunity\nto better understand the relation between birth weight and\nobesity, since they provide control for environmental and\ngenetic factors that are typically unmeasured in traditional\ngenetic and maternal environments, in contrast to unrelated\nhave identical gestational ages and equally share certain\nmaternal exposures (e.g., maternal age or socioeconomic\nstatus). Further, monozygotic twins are genetically identical\n(16, 24\u00ad28). Thus, differences in birth weight within sibling\nand twin pairs are not likely to be due to these shared in-\nfluences, but rather to factors influencing the growth of each\nindividual (26). Comparisons within full-sibling and twin\npairs can shed light on genetic and environmental influences\nof the association between birth weight and later size. Find-\nings from twin studies are inconsistent and dominated by\nis a great need for additional studies that provide findings in\na racially/ethnically diverse sample.\nUsing longitudinal, nationally representative, prospective\ndata enriched with sibling and twin pairs, we examined: 1)\nin the full cohort, the association between birth weight and\nobesity using traditional cohort analyses, hypothesizing that\npersons of high (versus normal) birth weight would be more\nlikely to become obese in later life; and 2) in the full-sibling\nand twin pairs sample, the association between birth weight\ndifference and body mass index (BMI; weight (kg)/height\n(m)2) difference using a within-pairs difference method,\nhypothesizing that the sibling with higher birth weight\nwould be heavier during adolescence and young adulthood.\nThe National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health\n(Add Health) was a prospective cohort study of 20,745 ad-\nolescents representative of the US school population in\ncluded wave I adolescents who had not graduated from high\nschool, even if they had dropped out of high school. In wave\nfollowed, regardless of wave II participation (ages 18\u00ad27\nyears). Waves II and III included an additional 29 respon-\ndents, for a total of 20,774 persons in the full cohort sample.\nThe Add Health data set consists of a core sample plus\nadditional subsamples, including full-sibling pairs and twin\npairs, collected for the purpose of genetic analyses. Survey\nprocedures have been described elsewhere and were ap-\nproved by the institutional review board at the University\nof North Carolina at Chapel Hill (35).\nHeight and weight were self-reported in waves I, II, and\nIII and measured in waves II and III during in-home surveys\nusing standardized procedures. We used self-reported data\nfrom all waves to maximize the sample size and for com-\nparability across waves. The discrepancy in weight change\nbased on self-report data versus measured data in this data\nset was relatively minor and was not related to important\ncovariates such as race/ethnicity, weight change efforts, ac-\ntivity, or inactivity, suggesting random differences versus\nsystematic differences (36). As recommended for longitudi-\nnal studies in adolescents, we used BMI as the main outcome\ninstead of BMI z score (37). Additionally, as recommended\nby expert panels and for comparability, obesity was defined\nconsistently across racial/ethnic groups as BMI !95th per-\ncentile of the age- and sex-specific National Center for\nHealth Statistics/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\ngrowth reference or !30 for adolescents and BMI !30 for\nadults (38, 39). For women who were pregnant at the time of\nmeasurement, BMI and obesity status were coded as miss-\ning. Birth weight was reported by the adolescent's mother\n(93%) or caregiver (7%) during the in-home wave I parental\ninterview. Covariates included age, sex, parental self-\nreported maternal obesity status (yes/no), parental self-\nreported paternal obesity status (yes/no), living with the\nsibling (for the family sample only (yes/no)), parental edu-\ncation, parental income, and race/ethnicity (by parental and\nadolescent report).\nFull cohort analyses\nFrom the initial 20,774 participants in the full cohort\nsample, there were 62,322 possible observations across the\n3 study waves. We excluded participants who were Native\nhad missing data on birth weight (n \u00bc 696)), height and\nanalytic sample included all available exposure, outcome,\nand covariate data collected across the 3 study waves, total-\nthe participants included in our analysis with those who\nwere not, there were significant differences by race/\nethnicity, parental education, age at baseline, maternal obe-\nsity, and BMI at baseline. To assess selection bias, we con-\nducted additional multivariate analyses using inverse\nprobability weighting, finding no evidence of selection bias\nStatistical analyses were conducted using Stata (release\n10.0; Stata Corporation, College Station, Texas). To account\nfor the stratified sampling strategy and the clustered sam-\npling design, we used sample weights and survey analysis\ntechniques in all descriptive analyses of the longitudinal\ncohort. Percentages were calculated for categorical vari-\nables, while mean values were calculated for continuous\nvariables. To compare persons with a nonobese mother at\nbaseline to those with an obese mother at baseline, we used\na v2 test and F statistic to test statistical differences.\nWe pooled data from all 3 waves and used longitudinal,\nrandom-effects, Poisson regression models to examine the\nassociation between birth weight and obesity among unre-\nlated persons (e.g., between-mother effect). These models\nadjusted for the correlation between repeated observations\nin the same subject and had the advantage of handling lon-\ngitudinal data on subjects with varying numbers of observa-\ntions, thereby allowing for inclusion of the maximum\nnumber of data points (42\u00ad44). Each individual contributed\n1\u00ad3 observations (mean \u00bc 2.4). Since we observed a non-\nlinear relation between birth weight and obesity, we catego-\nrized birth weight as low (<2.5 kg), normal (!2.5\u00ad 4 kg\n(referent)), or high (>4 kg); alternatively, we split birth\nGiven evidence suggesting that the birth weight\u00adobesity\nrelation may differ by age, maternal obesity, paternal obe-\nsity, and sex, we examined effect measure modification\nusing interaction terms and likelihood ratio tests, with a \u00bc\nthis area has been predominated by data from Caucasian\npopulations, we explicitly examined whether race/ethnicity\nmodified the association. Finding no such modification, we\ndid not stratify results by race/ethnicity. Only maternal obe-\nsity was identified as an effect measure modifier (P \u00bc 0.04);\nthus, final models were stratified by maternal obesity. Po-\ntential confounders were included if they changed the main\neffect coefficient by !10% or if they met a conceptual ra-\ntionale. Multivariate model results were adjusted for race/\nethnicity, age, age squared, sex, and parental education.\nSibling sample\nTo expand the findings of traditional cohort analyses, we\nanalyzed data from the Add Health sibling sample (1,270\nfull-sibling and twin pairs; 713 same-sex full-sibling, non-\nmonozygotic twin pairs) to examine whether within-pair\nbirth weight differences influenced within-pair BMI differ-\nences in adolescence and young adulthood (e.g., within-pair\neffect). Twin zygosity was determined by matching 12 mo-\nlecular genetic markers at wave I or III or by full agreement\nof self-report measures, including confusability of appear-\nance. Nontwin sibships were classified by self-report. From\nobservations across the 3 study waves. Using the same ex-\nclusion criteria as for the full cohort, the analytic sample for\nthe sibling sample consisted of 2,225 observations among\n909 sibling pairs. Each pair contributed 1\u00ad3 observations\nWe used longitudinal, random-effects, linear regression\nmodeling to examine whether within-pair birth weight differ-\nences predicted within-pair BMI differences over time (equa-\ntions 1 and 2). Difference measures were calculated between\nsibling 1 and sibling 2 (e.g., BMIsibling 1\n\u00c0 BMIsibling 2\n), with\nsiblings randomly ordered. We hypothesized that if birth\nweight was positively associated with later weight, the sibling\nwho was heavier at birth would also be heavier in adoles-\ncence and young adulthood. Therefore, if birth weight differ-\nence is positively associated with later BMI difference, we\nexpected the regression coefficient for b1\nto be significantly\ngreater than 0 (if the association were inverse, b1\nwould be\nsignificantly less than 0; if there were no association, b1\nwould not differ significantly from 0). The models for full\nsiblings and for dizygotic and monozygotic twins, respec-\ntively, are\nYij\n3 \u00f0birth weight difference\u00de\nj\n3 \u00f0age difference\u00de\nij\n3 \u00f0living together\u00de\nij\n\u00fe nij\n\u00fe cj\nand\nYij\n3 \u00f0birth weight difference\u00de\nj\n\u00c0\nagesibling 1\n\u00c1\nij\n3 \u00f0living together\u00de\nij\n\u00fe nij\n\u00fe cj\n;\nwhere Y is the BMI difference between siblings in pair j at\nwave i, nij\nis the error term specific to each pair j at each\nwave i, and cj\nis the error term specific to each pair j and\nconstant across wave i.\nWe stratified the models by sibling pair type (full siblings,\ndizygotic twins, or monozygotic twins) to capture any het-\nerogeneity in the relation between birth weight and later\nBMI which may be attributed to genetics and/or environ-\nment. Given research indicating that sex may differentially\ninfluence fetal growth, length of gestation, and body com-\nposition among twins (47, 48), we tested effect modification\nby the sex combination of the pair (using sex pair 3 birth\nweight difference interactions), finding effect modification\nfor monozygotic twins only. For comparability across the\nmodels, all model results were stratified by sex of the pairs\n(male-male and female-female).\nPotential confounders were identified using a directed\nacyclic graph (not shown) (49, 50). Only covariates that\ndiffered between siblings were included in the final models\n(age and living with the sibling). Characteristics shared\nbetween siblings, such as parental education, parental\nincome, maternal obesity, paternal obesity, and race/\nethnicity, were not included. For full sibling models, we\nused robust cluster commands in Stata to account for\nhousehold clustering, since multiple sibling pairs per\nhousehold were included. Sampling weights were not\ncomputed for the oversampled persons participating in\nthe sibling sample.\nRESULTS\nFull cohort sample\nDescriptive characteristics of the full cohort at baseline\nare given in Table 1. At baseline, persons with an obese\nmother were markedly different from persons with a non-\nobese mother with respect to birth weight, race/ethnicity,\nage, parental education, and obesity. Irrespective of mater-\nnal obesity status, obesity prevalence increased over the\n8-year study period (results not shown).\nUsing multivariate, longitudinal, random-effects Poisson\nregression modeling, we found a significant association be-\ntween birth weight and obesity in persons with a nonobese\nmother (Table 2). High birth weight participants with a non-\nobese mother were more likely to be obese adolescents/young\nadults than normal birth weight participants (incidence rate\nParallel multivariate Poisson models using additional cat-\negories (8) of birth weight similarly showed that persons\nwith a nonobese mother who weighed more than 3.6 kg at\nbirth were significantly more likely to become obese than\nthose weighing 3.2\u00ad3.5 kg at birth (Figure 1)--resulting, for\nexample, in a 1.2-unit higher BMI later in life for a birth\n(22.9 units) (results not shown). In contrast, a comparable\n1.3-kg difference in birth weight was not associated with\nlater BMI differences for persons with an obese mother.\nSibling sample\nApproximately half of the dizygotic and monozygotic\ntwins were low birth weight, as compared with 5% of full\nsiblings (Table 3). Within sibling pairs, differences in birth\nweight and BMI were largest for full siblings and smallest\nfor monozygotic twins. Within twin pairs, only 2 persons\nwere high birth weight (monozygotic twins).\nUsing longitudinal, random-effects, linear regression\nmodels to predict BMI differences, we observed that\namong monozygotic females, twin birth weight differences\nwere positively associated with adolescent and young adult\n4.35); the twin with a higher birth weight was more likely\nto have a higher BMI later in life, whereas no such asso-\nciation was observed for full siblings or dizygotic twins\n(Table 4). Post-hoc power calculations revealed adequate\nstatistical power (>80%) to detect within-pair BMI\ndifferences of approximately 1 unit or more (results not\nshown).\nDISCUSSION\nGiven mounting evidence suggesting that birth weight is\nassociated with adult size and disease, a comprehensive un-\nderstanding of whether the association between birth weight\nand adult size reflects intrauterine environmental factors or\ncommon genetic factors is needed (16). However, in most\nstudies examining the association between birth weight and\nobesity, investigators use traditional cohort data, which may\nnot be adequately suited to understanding which factors\ncontribute to the association. Sibling and twin study designs\nallow within-pair analytic approaches that eliminate much\nof the influence of factors shared by both siblings, such as\nmaternal exposures (e.g., maternal age), genetics, and the\npostnatal environment (e.g., parental feeding styles and so-\ntionally representative, prospective data set, we observed\nthat maternal obesity modified the relation between birth\nweight and later obesity. Persons who were high birth\nweight (versus normal birth weight) and had a nonobese\nmother were significantly more likely to be obese later in\nlife. We observed a similar (but not statistically significant)\ntrend for persons with an obese mother. Notably, we found\nno evidence of modification by race/ethnicity, which sug-\ngests that findings from predominantly Caucasian popula-\ntions may be generalizable to all US racial/ethnic groups. In\nthe sibling sample, we observed a positive association of\nbirth weight difference with later BMI difference in mono-\nzygotic, female twins only, despite adequate power to detect\nwithin-pair differences of !1 BMI unit; this suggests that\nnull findings in all other sibling configurations may be due\nto inadequate power to detect small within-pair BMI\ndifferences.\nSimilarly to our study, investigators in a majority of co-\nhort studies have reported a positive association between\nbirth weight and obesity later in life (7\u00ad14); however, only\n1 other study found effect-measure modification by mater-\nnal size (10). Given the strong link between maternal obe-\nsity, infant birth weight, and child obesity, we hypothesized\nTable 1.

If these genetic factors and/or behaviors were\npassed from mother to child, the association between birth\nweight and later obesity might be modified by maternal\nobesity status. We found an association between birth\nweight and later obesity in offspring of nonobese mothers\nonly, suggesting that genetic factors and/or an obesogenic\npostnatal environment may be stronger determinants of obe-\nsity than intrauterine factors.\nTwin studies examining the relation between birth weight\nand later size have yielded inconsistent findings: Some have\nfound positive associations, some null associations (5, 6, 29\u00ad\n34). Discrepant findings may reflect differences in inclusion\ncriteria (e.g., monozygotic twins only and/or combining twins\nof mixed sex (29\u00ad32, 34)). Our findings suggest that the in-\ntrauterine environment unique to each fetus contributes to\nlater size differences only in female monozygotic twin pairs.\nHowever, we cannot exclude the possibility that the intrauter-\nine environment does contribute to later size differences\nacross other sibling configurations, since we did not have\nsufficient power to detect within-pair differences of <1\nBMI unit, which would not be captured if the intrauterine\nenvironment contributes to very small differences in later\nsize. Intrauterine factors influencing birth weight between\nand within twins include blood and nutrient supply, umbilical\ncord insertion, placentation, and chorionicity (26, 51, 52).\nFigure 1. Incidence rate ratios for obesity according to birth weight and parental self-reported maternal obesity status (panel A, mother nonobese;\npanel B, mother obese), National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, 1994\u00ad2002. Incidence rate ratios were derived from a longitudinal,\nrandom-effects Poisson model with adjustment for age (in years), age squared (in years), sex, race/ethnicity, and parental education. Bars, 95%\nconfidence interval.\nHowever, it is not possible to entirely preclude the influence\nof genetic factors even among monozygotic twins, since they\nmay also differ according to a number of genetic factors,\nincluding the number of chromosomes present, as well as\nepigenetic modifications and DNA mutations (53). Alterna-\ntively, if the observed null associations are accurate, the com-\nmonly observed positive association between birth weight\nand obesity may be confounded by unmeasured, shared fac-\ntors (e.g., maternal characteristics), accounted for with the\nwithin-pairs difference method in full siblings, dizygotic\ntwins, and male-male monozygotic twins.\nComparing the results from the traditional cohort analy-\nses to those from the within-sibling/twin pair analyses sheds\nlight on which factors contribute to the birth weight\u00adobesity\nassociation. If findings for the full cohort and dizygotic\ntwins and siblings are both positive, whereas findings for\nmonozygotic twins are attenuated, this suggests that factors\nshared between monozygotic twins influence later body size\n(e.g., genetic factors). Conversely, if findings from the full\ncohort are positive, whereas null findings are observed in the\nwithin-pair sibling/twin sample, this suggests that any\nfactors shared between full sibling and twin pairs underlie\nthe association between birth weight and obesity (e.g.,\nsocioeconomic status). If the observed null findings in\nmonozygotic male twins are accurate, the positive findings\nobserved in the full cohort may be attributable to confound-\ning by maternal characteristics or influenced by genetic\nfactors. Alternatively, null findings may result from inad-\nequate power to detect small within-pair differences,\nwhich could be the case if within-pair birth weight differ-\nences contribute very little to within-pair BMI differences\nlater in life.\nMost research in this area has 1) been conducted in ra-\ncially/ethnically homogenous populations and 2) examined\nthe association between birth weight and size at only a single\npoint in time, thus precluding the generalizability of results\nto larger populations. The strengths of our study include our\nuse of a large, nationally representative cohort followed over\nan 8-year time span, providing valuable information regard-\ning the potential influence of modification by maternal obe-\nsity, paternal obesity, sex, age, and race/ethnicity, as well as\ncomparative findings from the sibling and twin samples. Our\nwithin-pairs difference approach holds all factors related to\nthe mother and pregnancy constant, while our cohort ap-\nproach provides information on unrelated persons, similar\nto a between-pair coefficient. Our findings shed light on the\ncomplex nature by which environmental and genetic factors\ninfluence the relation between birth weight and obesity.\nDespite these strengths, our study had some limitations.\nFirst, results from a unique sample of twin pairs may not\nbe generalizable to singleton births, particularly those involv-\ning term gestations. Generally, twins have lower birth weights\nTable 3.

Additionally,\nsince development of fat mass largely occurs later in preg-\nnancy, twins may have decreased fat mass in comparison with\nfull-term singleton babies (55). These differences in body\ncomposition may modify the association between birth\nweight and later size, which we were not able to capture using\nBMI. While other measures may more accurately capture\nadiposity, BMI is recommended for large epidemiologic stud-\nies and adequately correlates with total body fat (56). A\nsecond limitation is that while we used a sibling and twin-\npair design to reduce effects of shared environmental and\ngenetic factors, the results may have been affected by residual\nconfounding (e.g., birth weight differences may result in\na maternal choice to differentially feed offspring). Unfortu-\nnately, Add Health investigators did not collect information\nabout early-life factors, such as maternal care-giving prac-\ntices or other environmental/antenatal factors that differed\nbetween the siblings in early life. Furthermore, our results\nmay have been subject to measurement error arising from\nparental recall of birth weight and respondent self-report of\nheight and weight. However, parental recall of birth weight\nhas been shown to be relatively accurate, and discrepancies\nbetween self-reported and measured height/weight in Add\nHealth are relatively minor (57\u00ad61). Nonetheless, nondiffer-\nential reporting errors regarding birth weight, height, and\nweight would tend to attenuate the association between birth\nweight and later size and may underlie null findings in\nthe sibling sample. Alternatively, while our sibling sample\nwas larger than samples in other sibling studies, it was still\nrelatively small, with adequate statistical power to detect\nonly within-pair differences of !1 BMI unit (30\u00ad32).\nIn summary, our cohort study findings suggest that high\nbirth weight is positively associated with later obesity. Find-\nings from our sibling and twin study suggest that unmea-\nsured, shared factors, such as maternal characteristics, may\nbe responsible for the commonly observed positive associ-\nation between birth weight and later obesity. While there is\ngrowing evidence that early-life factors may influence later\nhealth outcomes, a better understanding of the pathways\nunderlying this relation is needed.\n"
