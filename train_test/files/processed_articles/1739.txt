The\npurpose of this article is to document and assess BJBC's\nimplementation, analyze factors affecting implementa-\ntion, and draw lessons from it for other long-term care\nworkforce initiatives. Design and Methods: We ana-\nlyzed qualitative data from project work plans and\nprogress reports, and notes from telephone and in-\nperson interviews with project staff, coalition stake-\nholders, and state policy experts. We abstracted the\ndata, categorized it, and summarized it by state in\nmatrices for analysis. Results: The five BJBC projects\ndid implement their demonstration plans. Factors that\naffected project implementation included having\ndemonstration resources; strong, stable leadership;\nstrong coalitions that included key stakeholders; a neu-\ntral lead agency; clear goals; effective process; and\na favorable state history and context. Implications:\nBJBC demonstrated that recruitment and retention is\na long-term care industry problem, not just a nursing\nhome problem. Future initiatives should: recognize\nthat workforce policy and management practice\nchange is difficult and takes time, obtain funding,\ndevelop strategies specific to the state history and\ncontext, engage key stakeholders, and develop relation-\nships among stakeholders.\nKey Words: Workforce, Aide, Nursing home,\nHome health, Assisted living, Long-term care\nNursing assistants, home health aides, and personal\ncare assistants play a vital role in long-term care.\nDespite their importance, however, recruitment and\nretention of these direct care workers is a challenge for\nall long-term care providers (Stone & Weiner, 2001).\nFactors that lead to difficulty recruiting and retaining\ndirect care workers include lack of training and upward\nmobility, hard emotional and physical work, work-\nplace stress and burnout, poor supervision, lack of\nrespect, and understaffing. Recently, a number of\nworkforce initiatives have sought to improve recruit-\nment and retention (Harris-Kojetin, Lipson, Fielding,\nThe Better Jobs Better Care (BJBC) demonstration\nwas a long-term care workforce initiative that sought to\n``create changes in policy and practice that will lead to\nthe recruitment and retention of high-quality para-\nprofessional (`direct care') workers in both nursing\nhomes and home and community-based settings'' (BJBC,\n2002, p. 3). The purpose of this article is to (a) document\nand assess BJBC's implementation, (b) analyze factors\naffecting implementation, and (c) draw lessons from it\nfor other long-term care workforce initiatives.\nBJBC Design and Goals\nMotivated by the current and anticipated future\nshortage of direct care workers and the belief that the\nquality of their jobs affects turnover and ultimately\nquality of care, The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation\nand The Atlantic Philanthropies (the Foundations)\nunderwrote the BJBC demonstration. They funded\nprojects enabling them to hire staff, issue subcontracts,\nand in some cases provide financial support to\nparticipating providers. The Foundations also funded\nthe Institute for the Future of Aging Services to run the\ndemonstration as the national program office and PHI\n(formerly the Paraprofessional Healthcare Institute) to\nThis research was supported by The Atlantic Philanthropies and The\nRobert Wood Johnson Foundation as part of the National Study of\nthe Better Jobs Better Care Demonstration.

Awards were to be made to\n. . . teams of stakeholders--providers, workers and\nconsumers as well as long term care policymakers--\nthat are already engaged in initiatives to improve\nworkforce recruitment, retention and quality.. . .\nEach team should be headed by a nonprofit agency\ncapable of providing the leadership and direction\nrequired to achieve the grantee team objectives.\nThe program office, technical assistance contractor,\nand the Foundations, with input from an advisory\ncommittee, reviewed the submitted proposals and\nawarded demonstration project grants to a lead agency\nin each of five states: Iowa, North Carolina, Oregon,\nPennsylvania, and Vermont. The lead agencies worked\nwith a coalition of stakeholders to run each project.\nEach project received funds for a 3-month planning\nperiod, during which they were expected to work with\n``team members, the Program Office, and participating\nfoundation staff to clarify goals and expectations and\nto devise a plan to achieve them'' (BJBC, 2002, p. 6).\nProjects were to develop management practice goals\nwithin broad guidelines to ``implement workplace\nimprovements in one or more provider networks to\nenhance the quality of direct care workers' jobs . . .'' to\nimprove recruitment and retention of the direct care\nconsiderable latitude in developing management prac-\ntice interventions, recruiting providers to test them, and\nsupporting participating providers in implementing the\ninterventions.\nProjects had similarly broad guidelines concerning\npolicy goals. Projects were to develop policy goals that\n``strengthen policies . . . that can help to attract and\nretain high-quality direct care workers'' (BJBC, 2002,\np. 3). Goals could include enhanced wages, improved\nhealth insurance coverage, subsidies of other benefits,\nfunding for education and training, and ``reimburse-\nment changes aimed at rewarding job redesign efforts''\n(p. 5). Projects also were to develop a strategy and\nimplementation plan for achieving their goals.\nMethods\nWe based our implementation research on qualita-\ntive data from (a) documents, including initial project\nwork plans and biannual progress reports that projects\nsubmitted to the national program office; and (b) notes\nfrom semistructured telephone and in-person inter-\nviews that we conducted. Respondents to these key\ninformant interviews in each state were the project\ndirectors and staff at the five lead agencies that received\nthe grants, stakeholders who were members of the five\ncoalitions, and policy experts in the five states.\nAdditional respondents had a ``cross-state vantage\npoint'' that gave them perspective on all of the projects.\nThese included the leadership of the national program\noffice and staff of the technical assistance contractor,\nwho provided technical assistance to all of the projects\non policy and practice interventions.\nWe asked project directors to identify their projects'\norganizational structures and the stakeholders in their\ncoalitions. We obtained information about projects'\ninitial policy goals and practice interventions from\nwork plans. We tracked modifications and progress\ntoward these goals through biannual progress reports,\nwhich we supplemented with information from tele-\nphone and site visit interviews. We grouped similar\npolicy goals and practice interventions into categories\nand abstracted specific information by state in text data\ntables for analysis. We abstracted basic information\nfrom them in the summary tables included here.\nFor our analysis of factors that affect implementation,\nwe relied on responses to questions in the semistructured\ninterviews ``what factors are associated with successful\nimplementation'' and ``what barriers hindered imple-\nmentation.'' We reviewed responses, identified themes,\nand developed detailed categories of facilitating factors\nand barriers, which we further grouped into six primary\ncategories. We abstracted specific responses and re-\ncorded them in data tables by state and detailed\ncategory, identifying whether the respondent's vantage\npoint was within a state or across states.\nWe distributed a draft of this paper to the project\ndirectors and staff of the national program office and\ntechnical assistance contractor for feedback. We then\nreviewed the feedback, reexamined the information\nfrom the data sources we had, and made changes based\non all of the information available.\nOverview of the Projects\nStakeholder Coalitions and Project Structures\nThe coalitions included one or more representatives\nof the following groups: state agencies, trade associa-\ntions, consumers, direct care workers or organizations\nthat represent them, and educational institutions (see\nTable 1). No two projects engaged exactly the same\nstakeholders, but all were quite broad in their inclusion\nof stakeholders. In some cases, members left or joined\nthe coalition during the demonstration. Notably\nmissing from three of the five coalitions was the state\nDepartment of Labor. The extent of prior experience\nworking together varied across projects.\nThe nonprofit lead agencies came from different\nstakeholder groups depending on the state (indicated\nby an L in Table 1). Some were advocacy groups\ncompletely independent of state agencies, whereas\nothers were tied to such agencies through previous\ngrant activities. Their respective missions ranged from\npromoting the quality of long-term care for consumers\nto improving direct care worker jobs.\nEach lead agency hired or designated a project\ndirector. Projects in four states also hired a practice\nmanager charged with implementing the practice\nchange goals at providers participating in the demon-\nstration. The practice managers were key resources in\npromoting active involvement of the participating\nproviders. Only one of the projects employed an\nequivalent policy development manager at any time\nduring the demonstration; either the lead agency\nexecutive director or project director assumed this\nrole in the other four projects. Two of the projects en-\ncountered hiring delays, and three experienced signif-\nicant staff turnover. The project leadership housed in\nthe five lead agencies was responsible for pursuing the\nprojects' policy and practice goals working with the\nstakeholder coalitions.\nManagement Practice Interventions\nAlthough all five projects pursued the same over-\narching goal of improving jobs and reducing turnover,\ntheir specific management practice interventions dif-\nfered (see Table 2). This article focuses on the activities\nof the lead agency in pursuing practice change;\na separate analysis will address participating providers'\nimplementation of management practice changes with-\nin their organizations. Most of the interventions\ninvolved using existing training programs to bring\nabout this ``culture change.'' Two projects offered\ntraining for senior level management, and three for\nfrontline supervisors. Three projects provided stan-\ndardized team building training to participating\nproviders. Projects offered peer mentoring programs\nin all but one state. Two projects sought to enhance\ndirect care workers' clinical and caregiving skills.\nFinally, all projects created some opportunities for\nproviders to develop provider-specific projects tailored\nto their specific needs.\nAll projects recruited provider organizations to\nparticipate in the demonstration. The recruitment\nprocess varied across states, ranging from a formal\nprocess of responding to a request for proposals to lead\nagency outreach to participating providers. A total of\n148 providers signed memoranda of understanding to\nTable 1.

Depend-\ning on the project's design, the total number of\nproviders in each state varied from 11 in Oregon to\n66 in North Carolina. Recruited providers included\nnursing facilities, assisted living facilities, home care\nagencies, and adult day service providers.\nPolicy Goals and Implementation\nThe five projects established a variety of policy goals,\nwhich we grouped into five categories (see Table 4), and\nall projects implemented initiatives to pursue their\ngoals. Although the call for proposals identified several\npossible options related to compensation, none of the\nprojects called for increases in wages, and only one\nworked to increase benefits. Two projects sought to\ncreate incentives for providers to implement manage-\nment practices that improve direct care jobs. Three\nsought to create or strengthen direct care worker\nprofessional associations. All five projects had one or\nmore goals that sought to develop direct care worker\ntraining curricula, expand formal credentialing of\ndirect care workers, or make information on creden-\ntials available to employers through registries. All five\nprojects promoted public awareness of direct care\nworkforce issues and advocated for policies that\naddressed these issues. Beyond these broad similarities\nin the types of goals, specific goals varied greatly within\ncategories. Although few goals were fully achieved, as\ndetailed below, all were at least partially achieved by\nthe end of the demonstration.\nThe Five Projects and Their Implementation\nDespite some similarities, the five demonstration\nprojects differed in their organization, experience,\nspecific goals, implementation experience, and policy\naccomplishments.\nIowa: Direct Care Worker Advocacy\nWith Policy Experience\nThe Iowa project was led by the Iowa CareGivers\nAssociation, a small organization with a focus on\neducation, recognition, advocacy, and research that\nimproves quality of care through support of direct care\nworkers. The mission of serving workers directly was\nunique among the lead agencies, and some parts of the\nprovider community reacted to it as a labor organizing\nthreat and refused to participate in the BJBC coalition.\nThe lead agency's executive director served as the\nproject director initially, later contracting with a project\ndirector, practice manager, and policy director for\nvarying amounts of time as needed, effectively doubling\nthe size of the organization. The lead agency director\nused her policy development experience to lead project\npolicy change efforts. Coalition members engaged to\nvarying degrees in three policy workgroups, work with\neducational institutions, and direct interventions with\nproviders.\nIowa's management practice initiative had four\ncomponents: (a) team-building training using Hartman\nCommunications' (2007) ``Color Code'' training pro-\ngram, which identifies each employee's personality and\npassions to enhance communication among all levels of\nstaff; (b) peer mentor training using a program pre-\nviously developed by the lead agency for nursing\nhomes, which it modified for home care settings and\nimplemented at participating providers; (c) manage-\nment training on the purpose and philosophy behind\nthe peer mentor training program, which was required\nof upper management at participating providers; and\n(d) mini-grants awarded to direct care workers who\ndeveloped worker-led interventions to improve re-\ncruitment and retention in their organizations.\nThe Iowa project's policy goals were to improve\nhealth benefits, streamline curriculum and credential-\ning, and promote awareness of long-term care work-\nforce policy issues. The project conducted a study\nanalyzing the options and feasibility of increasing health\ninsurance benefits for direct care workers and promoted\nawareness of the need for benefits, for example by\ndeveloping a video that relayed stories of uninsured and\nunderinsured direct care workers, participating in\ncitizens' health care work group forums, and becoming\ninvolved in a larger state debate on health care reform\nthrough direct worker legislative testimony.\nTable 2.

It surveyed direct care workers\nand providers regarding education and was instrumen-\ntal in the passage of two laws with appropriations. One\nmodified the state's existing nurse aide registry to\ninclude all classifications of direct care workers and\ntheir education and training. The other established\na governor-appointed Direct Care Worker Education\nTaskforce to which three direct care workers were\nappointed, one serving as co-chair.\nNorth Carolina: State-Related Agency With a\nClear Vision\nThe North Carolina Foundation for Advanced\nHealth Programs, a private organization that provides\nstaffing and a vehicle for receiving grant funds for\nprograms of interest to state policy makers, was the\nlead agency in North Carolina. It purchased the ser-\nvices of the half-time program director from the state\nDepartment of Health and Human Services. Assisted by\na professional facilitator, she provided staff support\nand leadership to a broad coalition of stakeholders\nfrom policy, practice, and advocacy organizations.\nThese stakeholders had a prior history of grant-funded\nprojects focused on long-term care workforce de-\nvelopment. The project accomplished much of the\nprovider-level intervention work through subcontracts\nwith five provider associations that also were members\nof the coalition.\nThe practice and policy initiatives of the North\nCarolina project differed somewhat from those of the\nother projects in that they were fully integrated under a\nsingle vision. The project's long-term goal was to es-\ntablish reimbursement differentials for providers whose\nmanagement practices create high-quality jobs for direct\ncare workers. The project's plan was, first, to establish\na special designation on state licenses for providers that\nmet practice criteria that its coalition was to develop and,\nlater, to pursue differential reimbursement.\nThrough a well-structured, consensus decision-\nmaking process, the coalition developed specific opera-\ntional requirements that providers would have to meet\nto receive the designation and tested them at providers\nthat participated as pilot sites. The special designation\nstandards were in four domains: supportive workplace,\ntraining, balanced workloads, and career development.\nProviders were allowed to develop their own approaches\nto meeting these standards. The only exception was\na required standardized training program for super-\nvisors, the PHI's Coaching Supervision training. It is\ndesigned to build ``relationships with supervisees,\nconstructively presenting and addressing problems, and\nhelping workers develop problem-solving skills'' (PHI,\nThe North Carolina legislature passed legislation\nestablishing this special designation, laying the foun-\ndation for establishing in future legislation higher\nreimbursement rates for providers receiving the\ndesignation. Once providers felt they fulfilled the re-\nquirements outlined in the special designation criteria,\nthey were able to submit applications and undergo both\na desk and onsite review. To date four providers have\nreceived the special designation. (See Brannon, Barry, &\nKemper, 2007, for additional information on the North\nCarolina project.)\nOregon: Process Orientation With a Focus\non Management Practice\nThe Oregon Technical Assistance Corporation,\nwhich provides training and technical assistance in-\ncluding support of state human service programs, was\nthe lead agency in Oregon. Although its executive\ndirector assumed the role of project director officially,\na four-person leadership team ran the project: a project\nmanager and a part-time practice manager housed at\nthe lead agency, a local evaluator, and a staff member\nfrom Oregon's Aging Services Department. The project\ncoalition members had a prior history of working\ntogether on long-term care initiatives. They ap-\nproached the project in what respondents referred to\nas the ``Oregon way,'' emphasizing a process-oriented,\nconsultative approach that takes time. The project\nmanager, along with the other three leadership team\nmembers, provided direction to a set of committees and\ncouncils, which were composed of coalition members.\nThe project's plan was to develop its policy goals\nover the course of the demonstration based on the\npolicy barriers to management practice change pro-\nviders encountered. Under this plan, the Oregon project\nfocused first on its practice goals.\nThe underlying philosophy of providing person-\ncentered care pervaded the practice interventions. The\nproject used the Learn, Empower, Achieve, Produce\n(LEAP) program training module for nurses to improve\nsupervisory skills. The training focused on building\nrelationships with residents, families, and direct care\nworkers; giving feedback to direct care workers; and\nempowering residents and direct care staff with an\nemphasis on person-centered care (Hollinger-Smith,\nThe project also used LEAP training to improve\ncommunication skills among practice teams at each\nprovider and to improve relationships between direct\ncare workers and their supervisors; in addition, it used\nthe module for direct care workers to teach peer\nmentoring skills. To promote diversity, the project\nencouraged providers to use a diversity training video\nwith all levels of staff to stimulate discussion of\ndiversity issues specific to their organizations.\nThe project developed few specific policy goals and\nmade little tangible progress on policy, in part because\nthe practice implementation experience did not generate\na policy agenda as planned. In addition to raising\nawareness of public policy issues related to the long-term\ncare workforce, the Oregon project sought to expand the\nuse of Oregon's new nurse delegation law. The project\nalso worked with the Oregon Consortium for Nursing\nEducation to develop scenarios on working with direct\ncare workers for a new statewide nursing curriculum.\n30  \nPennsylvania: Leadership Turnover in a\nLarge, Complex State\nThe lead agency in Pennsylvania was the Center for\nAdvocacy for the Rights and Interests of the Elderly,\nwhich provides outreach, training, referral, and advoca-\ncy for older adults, their caregivers, and service providers\nin the Philadelphia region. After early turnover, the lead\nagency was able to hire a project director and practice\nmanager to lead the project. The original coalition was\na 10-member steering committee that served during the\nproject's planning phase. Subsequently, the lead agency\ncreated a new, nonprofit subsidiary to oversee project\nimplementation, and governance shifted from the steer-\ning committee to the subsidiary's board. Decision-\nmaking authority for the project, however, remained\nwith the lead agency. Late in the project, the role of the\nsubsidiary and its board was terminated. The coalition\ndealt with significant opposition from certain regions of\nthe state and struggled with obtaining consensus from\na diverse group of stakeholders.\nBecause of Pennsylvania's large size, the lead agency\nestablished subcontracts with organizations in five\ngeographic regions to work with stakeholder groups\nlocally to pursue practice and policy change. Each\nsubcontractor was responsible for implementing prac-\ntice interventions at participating providers in its region.\nThe practice interventions included senior manage-\nment training, team building, supervisor training, and\nprovider-specific projects. A 2-day leadership training\nseminar conducted by the Professional Care Manage-\nment Institute prepared managers to support the\norganizational change that was expected to result\nfrom team-building training. Direct care workers re-\nceived team-building training using the Professional\nCare Management Institute's (2007) Key Solutions\nTeam Building training, which aimed to improve direct\ncare workers' perception of organizational culture and\nemployee satisfaction. Providers also were offered the\nPHI's Coaching Supervision training in problem-solving\nskills (PHI, 2007). Finally, joint teams of managers and\ndirect care workers developed provider-specific inter-\nventions focusing, for example, on orientation, mentor-\ning, or improving communication about care.\nThe Pennsylvania project's policy goals included\nexpanding direct care worker training resources and\ncredentialing, developing a professional association for\ndirect care workers, and promoting awareness of long-\nterm care workforce public policy issues. The project\ndeveloped a Universal Core Curriculum designed for\ndirect care workers in all settings. By demonstration's\nend, two Area Agencies on Aging had adopted it for\npersonal care worker training. The project also worked\non developing training and a competency exam based\non the curriculum with the expectation that it will be\nused in Pennsylvania's new personal care attendant\ntraining regulations. The project established a direct\ncare worker advisory committee to represent the needs\nof the state's direct care workers, put on a statewide\nworker conference, and published a newsletter with an\neditorial board composed of direct care workers. These\naccomplishments led direct care workers to establish\na statewide direct care worker association. Finally,\nsome members of the project staff and coalition served\non legislative workgroups in an effort to integrate BJBC\ninto other long-term care workforce policy initiatives.\nVermont: Leadership Turnover in a Small,\nCollaborative State\nThe lead agency in Vermont, the Community of\nVermont Elders, promotes improved quality of life for\nseniors through education, policy development, and\nadvocacy. The lead agency's executive director played\nan active leadership role, overseeing a project director\nand additional staff hired to manage the practice\ninitiative. Initially, the project was governed by a 24-\nmember steering committee and a 7-member executive\ncommittee whose members had a history of working\ntogether on long-term care workforce policy issues. The\nexecutive committee made decisions with input from the\nsteering committee. Significant turnover occurred\namong project staff members and, coincident with the\ntransition to a new executive director and project\ndirector, the structure developed into a network with\nworkgroups. These workgroups included project staff,\nexecutive committee members, or both who did the bulk\nof the work and decision making, with the executive\ncommittee serving in an advisory and steering capacity.\nVermont's practice goals focused on peer mentoring\nand caregiving skill development. The project provided\ntraining in peer mentoring and direct care worker\nleadership development to help foster culture change at\nthe providers. As part of its policy work, the Vermont\nproject developed advanced direct care worker training\nprograms (see below) that it offered to participating\nproviders.\nThe project's policy goals included creating incen-\ntives for job redesign, developing curriculum and\ncredentialing, creating a direct care worker professional\nassociation, and promoting awareness of long-term care\nworkforce policy issues. The Vermont project added\ncriteria to an existing annual state quality award for\nnursing facilities that required the use of best practices\nfor recruitment and retention of direct care workers. It\nalso established a similar industry award for home care\nproviders, although without financial incentives.\nThe project developed three training curricula for\ndirect care workers. These curricula offered training\nfor personal care aides and two advanced training\nmodules, one on palliative care and the other on the\ncare of persons with dementia for existing workers.\nThe project then received a grant from the state\nDepartment of Education to develop a methodology for\nassessing personal care aides' proficiency based on the\ncurriculum it had developed.\nAlthough technically not a BJBC initiative, the\nVermont lead agency had a concurrent, complementary\ngrant to establish a direct care worker association that\nwas integrated with the BJBC project. The result was\nthe creation of a direct care worker association. The\nBJBC project offered continued support of the associ-\nation through events and education, access to training,\nand reimbursement for direct care workers' travel to\nnational conferences.\nFinally, project staff and coalition members partic-\nipated in other state long-term care workforce de-\nvelopment workgroups. They also met and maintained\nclose contact with state legislators, playing an impor-\ntant role in the passage of workforce study legislation\nwith an appropriation.\nFactors Affecting Implementation\nRespondents to telephone and in-person interviews\nidentified factors that helped and barriers that hindered\nimplementation of the BJBC projects. Table 5 reports\nthe number of states in which the factors were\nmentioned by one or more within-state respondents;\nan asterisk indicates whether one or more respondents\nwith a cross-state vantage point mentioned the factor.\nWe grouped them into six categories that in our\njudgment are important overarching factors for suc-\ncessful implementation.\nDemonstration Resources.--Not surprisingly, dem-\nonstration funding and in-kind technical assistance\nprovided by the national program office and technical\nassistance contractor were essential to the demonstra-\ntion projects. Respondents identified resources as\na facilitating factor and their decline after the demon-\nstration as a barrier to continuation. External support,\nhowever, was able to do little to overcome one\nsignificant financial barrier to provider participation\nand commitment to the project: the limited financial\nresources and staffing in the competitive long-term care\nindustry, much of which relies heavily on low Medicaid\nreimbursements. Indeed, instability among providers'\nsenior management, which is likely related to competi-\ntion and low pay, was an important barrier to engaging\nand sustaining provider participation in the project.\nStrong, Stable Project Leadership.--Also not sur-\nprisingly, the skills and abilities of project leadership\nwere important for effective implementation, as was\nprior experience with public policy and practice\ninterventions. Several projects did not have a designated\nperson with policy experience to lead work on policy,\nmaking it difficult to pursue policy goals. Projects\nsometimes used consultants effectively to add needed\nexpertise that the leadership did not have. Hiring and\nretaining appropriately qualified leadership turned out\nto be quite challenging, and delays in hiring and\nturnover of leadership were oft-cited barriers to\nimplementation\nStrong Coalition With Key Stakeholders.--Having\nrepresentation of key stakeholders, particularly pro-\nvider and direct care workers, as well as state agencies,\nwas essential for project implementation. A history of\ncollaboration greatly increased the ability of the\nstakeholders to function as a coalition and compromise\non issues when they had competing interests. This was\nthe experience in Oregon, North Carolina, and\nVermont, where coalition of stakeholders previously\nhad worked together on related issues. The particular\nindividuals representing stakeholders, of course, mat-\nter: They should be key decision makers, have policy or\npractice experience, be committed to the project, and\nbe able to participate regularly.\nA Neutral Lead Agency.--Having a lead agency that\nother stakeholders, particularly providers and direct\ncare worker organizations, did not perceive to be neutral\nwas a barrier to implementation in some states. For ex-\nample, as indicated, in Iowa some providers perceived\nthe lead agency, as a caregiver association, to be pro-\nunionization, making it difficult to engage providers in\nthe project and leading one provider association to ac-\ntively oppose the project. In contrast, stakeholders in\nNorth Carolina perceived the lead agency, which was\nlinked with state government and had prior experience\nwith coalition stakeholders, as sufficiently neutral to lead\nthe coalition with the confidence of the stakeholders.\nClear Goals.--The pursuit of a clear goal that\nstakeholders agreed on contributed to effective imple-\nmentation. In North Carolina having a single, clear\ngoal encompassing both policy and practice from the\nbeginning of the demonstration was important to\nproject implementation. In contrast, in some states,\nthe absence of clear goals from the beginning made it\ndifficult to focus project implementation efforts and\nresources. Respondents also viewed achievability of\ngoals as important, mentioning as barriers the demon-\nstration's unrealistic expectations, its short duration,\nand the difficulty of pursuing both policy and practice\ngoals. Strategies for pursuing goals appeared to be less\nimportant than the goals themselves or the process for\npursuing them. However, respondents identified several\nspecific strategies for achieving policy goals: (a)\nmonitoring policy activity and flexibly exploiting\ncurrent policy interest; (b) having a public education\nand communication strategy from the project begin-\nning; and (c) collecting information to document the\nworkforce problem and, later, the project's successes.\nEffective Process.--The emphasis on process and\nhow it was used was an important factor that could be\neither a barrier or a facilitator of successful implemen-\ntation. Overemphasis on process can delay implemen-\ntation, whereas excessive task orientation can limit the\nbreadth and sustainability of a project's impact. At the\nsame time, skillful use of process can be effective in\nreaching compromise and building relationships among\nstakeholders, as it did in North Carolina (Brannon et\nal., 2007). For developing practice interventions,\nrespondents with cross-state vantage points viewed\ninvolving providers and direct care workers as facili-\ntating development, and several respondents under-\nscored the importance of good communication between\nthe lead agency and participating providers. Structural\nfactors appeared to be less important than process,\nalthough the structure should support the goals and\nprocess, as well as the unique characteristics of the state.\n32  \nFavorable State History and Context.--A state's\nhistory and context had major effects on implementa-\ntion, both favorable and unfavorable. As indicated,\na history of stakeholders working together on work-\nforce issues greatly facilitated project implementation.\nCurrent interest of state policy makers in changes in\npolicies affecting direct care workers also was essential\nfor achieving policy goals. However, projects identified\ntight state budgets and unwillingness of policy makers\nto increase spending as barriers to policy change. Fear\nof unionization, greater in some states than others, was\nsometimes a barrier to both provider participation\nand policy change. A state's size (population and\ngeographic) also affected implementation. For exam-\nple, competing regional stakeholders and having to\ntravel long distances to meetings posed barriers to\nimplementation in large, diverse Pennsylvania.\nDiscussion\nConclusions\nBJBC's implementation experience clearly demon-\nstrates that engaging providers in practice change and\nTable 5.

Efforts to engage providers\nin management practice change often confront un-\nderstaffed organizations in an underfunded industry;\nmanagement that may have limited training; and high\nturnover of management, supervisors, and direct care\nworkers. Policy change requires stakeholders, who\noften have competing interests, to agree about goals; it\nconfronts resistance when it would increase state\nspending; and it relies on the interest and support of\nlegislators, which takes skill, persistence, and time to\ndevelop. The BJBC experience, moreover, almost\ncertainly underestimates the challenges. Because the\nprojects chose to apply for the grant and were selected\nbased on a highly competitive process, they almost\ncertainly had greater than average ability to implement\ntheir projects. Similar efforts elsewhere might well\nencounter greater barriers and have less success in\nimplementation than the demonstration projects.\nThat said, BJBC demonstrated that despite competing\ninterests, key provider and direct care worker stake-\nholders can work together to pursue common workforce\nissues and that long-term care providers of all types can\nengage in efforts to improve direct care jobs. All five lead\nagencies and stakeholder coalitions were able to\nimplement their projects. All established policy goals\nand had some success in achieving them. All projects also\ndeveloped management practice interventions, recruited\nproviders to undertake the interventions, and supported\nproviders with implementation.\nThe BJBC demonstration stimulated some impor-\ntant steps forward. By developing expertise, establish-\ning networks within and across states, and fostering\nworking relationships and trust among stakeholders,\nthe demonstration laid a foundation for continued\nchange in the five demonstration states, and it focused\nattention more broadly on the challenge and impor-\ntance of improving jobs in long-term care.\nFinally, BJBC demonstrated that direct care work-\nforce issues cut across settings. Recruiting and retaining\ndirect care workers is not just a nursing home problem\nor a home care problem--it is a long-term care\nproblem in which nursing facilities, assisted living\nfacilities, home care providers, and adult day service\nproviders and their residents and clients all have\na common interest. Indeed, shifting the research,\npolicy, and provider community's focus from the silos\nand competing interests of each provider type to the\ncommon workforce issues that cut across settings will\nbe an important legacy of BJBC.\nFuture Research\nMore questions about the BJBC demonstration\nremain to be addressed. We have not yet analyzed\nfactors affecting implementation of management prac-\ntice changes at providers that participated in the\ndemonstration. Nor have we analyzed the effects of\npractice interventions on retention and turnover,\nsupervision, job satisfaction, respect, or other indica-\ntors of direct care job quality. These analyses all will be\npart of the broader evaluation of BJBC. A number of\nimportant questions, however, cannot be addressed\nthrough BJBC and should be addressed in future\nresearch: What are the effects of increasing compensa-\ntion on job quality and turnover? How do recruitment\npractices affect turnover? What are the effects of\nmanagement practice changes and compensation on\nthe quality of the lives and care of clients and residents?\nImplications\nThis article has focused on the implementation of\nfive particular BJBC projects in five particular states at\na particular time in their history. Some of the factors\naffecting implementation that demonstration respond-\nents identified are unique to the particulars of the\ndemonstration or ignore the history and context that,\nfrom projects' perspectives, are outside their control.\nNonetheless, their experience has implications for those\npursuing similar efforts in other states.\nObtain Money and Staff.--Addressing the consid-\nerable challenges of changing practice and policy to\nimprove direct care jobs requires resources. Money and\nstaff were instrumental in effecting both practice and\npolicy change in BJBC. Foundation funding enabled the\nprojects to hire staff to convene and support the\ncoalition, receive direction and technical assistance,\npursue legislative change, and assist providers in\nimplementing practice interventions. When undertak-\ning similar initiatives, obtaining financial support to\nhire staff should be an early step.\nEngage Key Stakeholders.--Provider and worker\norganizations are key stakeholders that must be engaged\nin and committed to the initiative. Other stakeholders,\nparticularly state government, are important, but\nwithout providers and direct care workers--with their\nsometimes competing interests--compromise and prog-\nress are unlikely. Indeed, efforts led by either providers\nor worker organizations are unlikely to have a large\nimpact because neither is seen as neutral by the other.\nPursue a Clear Vision.--The initiative should have\nan important vision that key stakeholders agree on.\nBJBC projects without clear vision faced difficulty\nimplementing their projects.\nDevelop Stakeholders` Working Relationships.--\nAlthough task orientation can lead to task accomplish-\nment, process orientation can build relationships and\ntrust. And strong relationships and trust among stake-\nholders are more likely to lead to sustained workforce\nefforts than accomplishment of discrete tasks (Brannon\nSeek to Change the Context.--Although some state\nfactors such as size and culture cannot be changed,\nmany factors that are immutable in the short run may\nbe mutable in the long run. In addition to developing\nexperience working together and trust, stakeholders\n34  \ncan seek to stimulate policy interest and additional\nworkforce efforts, one step leading to the next. If one\nthing has been learned from the BJBC experience it is\nthat improving jobs in long-term care is a challenging,\nlong-term process requiring vision, commitment, and\npersistence.\nReferences\nBetter Jobs Better Care.
