Gray2, and Mark Schlesinger3\n Keywords\ndisparities, hospital choice, hospital volume and outcomes, behavioral economics\nArticle\nIntroduction\nRacial/ethnic disparities in health status and medical utiliza-\ntion have become a focus of research (Institute of Medicine\n[IOM], 2003) and a concern for policy makers (Ladenheim\nand Groman 2006). While a portion of these disparities can be\nattributed to insurance coverage and broader socio-economic\ndifferences, even after accounting for these factors, there\nremain health care disparities (IOM 2003; Medical Care\npercent of the nation's physicians and hospitals provide most\nmedical care for minority patients (Bach et al. 2004; Jha et al.\nassociated with these providers and facilities: broad quality\nmeasures are lower for the hospitals and nursing homes used\nSmith et al. 2007); process measures for specific conditions\nindicate lower quality (Barnato et al. 2005; Bradley et al.\n2004); and minority patients are less likely to receive new\ntreatment technologies (Groeneveld, Laufer, and Garber\n2005). Blacks receive care from hospitals and surgeons with\nhigher mortality rates (Clarke, Davis, and Nailon 2007;\nKonety, Vaughan Sarrazin, and Rosenthal 2005; Lucas et al.\nities are less likely to use higher-volume hospitals and sur-\nsist even after controlling for a variety of other factors\nAyanian 2006). Moreover, research results have revealed that\na large portion of the disparities in quality of care for minori-\nties appear to be associated with between-hospital differences\nrather than within-hospital differences, that is, racial/ethnic\ndisparities in quality and outcomes are associated with the\nfact that minorities and whites are obtaining care at different\nhospitals rather than because they receive different levels of\ncare within the same hospital (Barnato et al. 2005; Bradley\nThese findings highlight the need to better understand the\nfactors that influence where patients receive care, but there\nhas been relatively little study of the particular pathways that\nlead to these disparities. In this article, we examine several\npotentially influential factors, which shed new light on how\n1City University of New York, NY, USA\n2Urban Institute, Washington, DC, USA\n3Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nKarl Kronebusch, School of Public Affairs,Baruch College, City University\nEmail: Karl.Kronebusch@baruch.cuny.edu\npatients use their local medical delivery systems. Our start-\ning point is the decision-making complexity associated with\nhospital use and how patient and physician decisions are\naffected by several features of the local hospital environ-\nment, including what we will term proximity, choice com-\nplexity, and local medical experience. As we document\nbelow, minority patients in the United States generally live\nrelatively close to hospitals, but they face a previously unrec-\nognized set of disadvantages associated with the greater\ncomplexity of their hospital markets and their more limited\nexperience with specialized medical services.\nOur empirical analysis focuses on racial/ethnic disparities\nassociated with one particular marker of hospital quality: the\nuse of hospitals that are \"high volume\" providers of surgical\nservices for which there is evidence that higher-volume hos-\npitals have better outcomes (Dudley et al. 2000; Gandjour,\nBannenberg, and Lauterbach 2003; Halm, Lee, and Chassin\nNormand 2003).1 Based on a large literature, experts have\nadvised patients to obtain their care from these high-volume\nhospitals (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality\n2007). A number of issues have been raised on how to act on\nthese findings (Epstein 2002), and some researchers have\nquestioned the use of volume as a guide for patient decision\nmaking (Browne, Pietrobon, and Olson 2009; Goshima et al.\n2008). Nonetheless, for our analysis, procedure volume is a\nuseful marker for examining where racial/ethnic minorities\nare treated and how their responses to hospital quality infor-\nmation may differ from white patients. For a number of\nyears, especially in the period we examine, the volume\u00adout-\ncome relationship in hospitals was publicized in press\naccounts of research, and information on hospital volume\nbecame more widely available to consumers. And by the end\nof the 1990s, this relationship was recognized by the public:\nroughly two-thirds of Americans viewed the extent to which\na hospital is \"experienced with a given test or procedure\" as\nrevealing \"a lot\" about quality of care (Kaiser Family\nFoundation [KFF], 2000), and minorities appeared as aware\nof this relationship as whites (Gray et al. 2009).\nAs we show below, although minorities live closer than\nwhites to these high-volume facilities, they are systemati-\ncally less likely to receive care at these hospitals. Minority\ngroup members in the United States face a number of general\nand well-known disadvantages, including discrimination,\nmore limited levels of economic and social resources, and\ndifficulties in obtaining access to services. Our analysis sug-\ngests that greater complexity in the hospital markets where\nminorities live creates an additional set of challenges. For\nmost minority patients, while high-volume hospitals are geo-\ngraphically accessible, there are often a large number of low-\nvolume hospitals nearby as well. Drawing from the literature\non decision making and bounded rationality, we hypothesize\nthat information demands, lower levels of local experience,\nmore limited physician assistance, and lower levels of trust\nmake it more difficult for minority patients to navigate the\nhealth care system and identify higher-quality providers.\nThese difficulties are magnified by the complexity of the\nurban hospital markets where most minority group members\nlive in the United States, and this offsets the advantages of\nproximity that minorities should have when obtaining hospi-\ntal care.\nAs we develop below, complex decision-making environ-\nments may affect the observed pattern of hospital use in two\ndistinct ways: First, white patients may have greater advan-\ntages and minority patients greater disadvantages in adapting\nto decision-making complexity. And so, white and minority\npatients may be observed to be responding differentially,\nwith lower and higher levels of sensitivity to the decision-\nmaking environment. Second, minorities and whites might\nsimply be situated in different circumstances, with minorities\nliving in decision-making environments that are more com-\nplex. Decision-making complexity might then have a greater\nimpact on minority patients, even if for any given level of\ncomplexity, white and minority patients respond similarly to\nthe level of complexity.\nOur empirical contribution uses hospitalization data from\nfour states. We use these data to describe the magnitude of\nracial/ethnic disparities and present a set of multivariate\nmodels that estimate the impacts of proximity, choice com-\nplexity, and local medical experience on these patterns of\nhigh-volume hospital use. All three factors play a role and\ntogether are associated with about half of the observed racial/\nethnic disparity in the use of high-volume facilities.\nImportantly, our results show that for some, but not all, of the\nfactors we measure, minorities are differentially responsive\nto complexity, at least for several specific services. But for\nexplaining the impact on the overall level of disparities, the\neffects of living in different market circumstances are strong\nand consistently found for all services that we examined,\nwhile differential sensitivity is found for only some of the\nfactors we examine, for only some services, and it is often\nonly modest in size. Thus, based on these data, the results\nindicate that the main choice-related disadvantages for\nminority patients are associated with simply living in a com-\nplex hospital market context and are largely not because\nminority patients respond differently to the various factors\nthat influence hospital choice.\nHospital Choice: Complex Choice Sets\nand Bounded Rationality\nOver the last three decades, researchers have explored the\nimplications of bounded rationality and the decision-making\nbiases that emerge under conditions of limited information\nfor a broad range of decisions, including medical decision\non this literature for our conceptual model, which focuses on\nKronebusch et al. 3\nhow information availability and complexities in the choice\nenvironment affect patient decisions concerning hospital\ncare. The choice circumstances of white and minority\npatients differ in important ways, and these differences cre-\nate a previously unrecognized source of racial/ethnic dispari-\nties in the use of high-volume hospitals.\nOur model of hospital choice starts with the general\neffects of limited information on decision making. When\nmaking decisions under conditions of limited information,\nindividuals use a variety of strategies. These include relying\non information derived from social networks (Pauly and\nSatterthwaite 1981), and while other sources of information\nhave emerged, most Americans continue to use experiences\nof family and friends rather than expert evaluations when\nmaking medical decisions (KFF 2008). In addition, consum-\ners employ various psychological heuristics and decision-\nmaking rules-of-thumb by, for instance, using examples that\nare familiar and that come readily to mind (Tversky and\nKahneman 1973), following similar decisions by others\n(Thaler and Sunstein 2008, chap. 3), extrapolating from a\nsmall number of experiences or reports from others (Rabin\nquo (Samuelson and Zeckhauser 1988), and following a sat-\nisficing norm (Simon 1987). These strategies allow patients\nto make decisions with limited information. At the same\ntime, these strategies also reduce the incentive to gather\nadditional information, which further reduces the likelihood\nof identifying higher-quality hospitals, and reinforces\npatients' tendencies to choose hospitals based on conve-\nnience or familiarity.\nThe difficulty of analyzing medical care options increases\nas the number of provider options expands, creating a situa-\ntion of potential \"choice overload\" (Iyengar and Kamenica\n2007). Consumers who face choice overload often make\npoor decisions, and the presence of additional options may\nbe overwhelming, leading them to disengage from the pro-\ncess (Gilovich and Medvec 1995), refuse to make any deci-\nthe number of alternatives under active consideration\nand defer to others who might choose for them, potentially\nreinforcing patient deference to their physicians (Frank\nChoice overload will be especially likely in urban areas,\nwhere services are available at multiple institutions. Because\nthe probability of choice overload increases with the com-\nplexity of the choice set, an abundance of hospital options\nmay impede decision making. This is compounded by inad-\nequate information and the resulting use of decision short-\ncuts: poorly informed patients will have greater difficulties\nidentifying higher-quality hospitals and will rely on conve-\nnience and local referral patterns that may lead them to\nlower-quality hospitals. Moreover, if choice overload causes\npatients to disengage psychologically, they become more\nlikely to rely on familiarity, allow others to guide their\nchoice, or adopt a satisficing approach, assuming that any\nhospital will deliver care of adequate quality. These heuris-\ntics will increase the likelihood of using lower-quality hospi-\ntals and bypassing higher-quality hospitals.\nImplications for Racial/Ethnic\nDisparities\nThe limitations on information availability and the difficul-\nties of navigating complex choice situations are likely to dis-\nproportionately affect minorities. Minority patients have\nmore limited access to informal sources of information and\ntend to live in urban areas where decision making is complex\ndue to the relatively large number of hospitals. These diffi-\nculties would be less consequential if patients could simply\ndefer to their providers, but minorities are also less con-\nnected to sources of medical guidance and less trusting of the\nmedical care system.\nFirst, minority patients have weaker connections to physi-\ncians than do whites: they are less likely to have a regular\nsource of care, are more likely to use clinics or hospital out-\npatient departments as their usual source of care, have fewer\noutpatient visits than whites, and are less likely to be insured\n(Lillie-Blanton, Martinez, and Salganicoff 2001). Second,\neven when connected with a primary care clinician, minority\npatients face hurdles to obtaining high-quality care, and this\ncan affect every stage of medical utilization (Einbinder and\nSchulman 2000). Physicians who treat minority patients\nreport greater difficulty obtaining referrals and admissions\n(Bach et al. 2004), and minorities are more likely to have\nminority physicians, who themselves report greater difficul-\nties in obtaining services (Hargraves, Stoddard, and Trude\n2001). Minority patients use surgeons with higher mortality\nrates, especially when their primary care physicians have had\nmore limited experience with the hospitals used (Mukamel,\nMoreover, compared with whites, minority patients have a\nlower level of trust toward the health care system, and they are\nthus likely to give additional weight to obtaining care from\nfacilities that are seen as trustworthy. Various forms of dis-\ncrimination contribute to their lower levels of satisfaction and\nperceptions of receiving lower-quality care (Blendon et al.\nal. 2000). Cultural factors and language create difficulties\n(Brach and Fraser 2000), and minority patients who have been\nhospitalized report less respect for patient preferences than do\nwhites (Hicks et al. 2005). Trust may be particularly relevant\nfor minorities in that the use of high-volume hospitals may\nrequire that they cross social and geographic boundaries to\nobtain care from providers located outside their own neighbor-\nhoods, or in institutions generally perceived as \"white.\"\nIn combination, these factors increase the difficulties\nthat minority patients face in negotiating their way through\nthe health care system. Under these circumstances, we\nhypothesize that they will fall back on various decision\nheuristics about where to receive their inpatient care, such\nas simply seeking treatment at other nearby hospitals,\nwhich are familiar to patients and their social networks, and\nconvenient because their current clinicians practice in these\nhospitals. The converse is found for white patients--at the\nindividual, neighborhood, and market levels, white patients\nbenefit from a number of socio-economic advantages that\nfacilitate adaptations to this complexity.\nLocal Experience\nAs just discussed, patients tend to rely on their social net-\nworks when making medical decisions. Compared with\nwhites, patients from minority groups are more reliant on\nthese informal sources of information than on published\nperformance measures (Gray et al. 2009). Moreover, minor-\nities have lower average levels of formal education than\nwhites, which may reduce their ability to obtain and ana-\nlyze publicly available information about hospital quality.\nAs the rate of utilization for any particular procedure varies\nby location, there are places where prospective patients will\nhave a large number of potential informal advisers with\npersonal experiences, and neighborhoods where these\nexperiences are more limited. The reliability of this infor-\nmal advice is likely to be higher in communities with a rela-\ntively high procedure utilization rate compared with\ncommunities with lower rates. But because neighborhoods\nwith concentrated minorities tend to have below average\nincome and education levels, and lower rates of insurance\ncoverage and procedure utilization, the level of experience\nin a typical minority patient's social network is likely to be\nless than for white patients.\nHypothesis 1: Local experience: Minority patients are\nmore likely to live in areas with lower utilization rates for\nparticular services, and because of this, they have less\naccess to informal advice, and will use high-volume hos-\npitals at a lower rate than whites. Moreover, the various\ndisadvantages discussed above lead minority patients to\nhave more limited information from a range of sources. If,\nhowever, they live in areas with higher levels of local\nexperience, this will partially make up for the relative\npaucity of information from other sources, and this will\ntend to benefit them disproportionately, leading to a pat-\ntern of differential responses to local experience.\nChoice Overload\nChoice overload is more likely to affect minority patients for\ntwo reasons. First, because minority populations often live in\nlarger urban areas, they are more likely to face complex\nchoice sets for inpatient care. Second, because many minor-\nity populations have lower levels of educational attainment,\nfewer minority patients will have developed the skills for\ndealing with complex choices.\nHypothesis 2: Complex choice sets: The magnitude of\nracial disparities in high-volume hospital use will be asso-\nciated with differences in the number of options available\nin local markets, and disparities will be most pronounced\namong residents who face the most complex choice sets.\nMoreover, minority disadvantages will differentially\nreduce the ability of minority patients to identify higher-\nquality hospitals in areas with complex choice sets.\nProximity and Distance\nAs we have argued, minorities have more limited access to\nrelevant information about hospital quality and lower levels of\nphysician assistance in making hospital decisions, at the same\ntime that they live in more complex medical markets. One\nheuristic that patients might use when it is difficult to collect\nand assess information on numerous potential hospitals is to\nsimply choose any nearby hospital. Although this may not be\noptimal as an approach for identifying higher-quality hospi-\ntals, it does minimize the need to analyze a complex array of\ninformation. In addition, a patient's physicians are more likely\nto practice at nearby hospitals and will be familiar with the\nstaff and affiliated physicians. Finally, with the lower level of\nassistance from physicians, minority patients are relatively\nmore reliant on their social networks for advice, leading\nminority patients to be more likely to act on the basis of famil-\niarity and the hospital experiences of friends, family, and\nneighbors--experiences which will be disproportionately\nbased on care received from nearby hospitals.\nHypothesis 3: Proximity and distance: The locations of\nhospitals may create advantages and disadvantages for\nparticular groups of patients. Minorities disproportion-\nately live in urban areas and are located closer to hospitals\nthan white patients on average. This should, on average,\nincrease their use of high-volume hospitals. Proximity\nwill have a substantial influence on hospital choice for all\npatients, and it is likely to have a distinctly strong effect\nfor minority patients whose choices are less likely to be\naided by physicians. With lower levels of medical guid-\nance, they will be differentially more sensitive to distance\nand proximity than white patients.\nData and Methods\nBased on the literature on volume and outcomes, we chose\nvolume-sensitive services with sufficient sample sizes to\nprovide reliable estimates, including three cardiovascular\nprocedures, three types of cancer surgery, three orthopedic\nprocedures, and two prostate procedures.2 The outcome of\ninterest is whether patients used a hospital that was a high-\nvolume provider for the specific procedure or condition for\nwhich they were admitted, based on whether the hospital's\naverage annual discharges (averaged over the two-year\nperiod) met or exceeded evidence-based volume thresholds.\nKronebusch et al. 5\nFor coronary artery bypass grafts, coronary angioplasty, and\ncarotid endarterectomy, thresholds recommended by the\nLeapfrog Group were used, while for the remaining services,\nthresholds were based on the median volume level associ-\nated with better outcomes in the studies reviewed by Halm,\nLee, and Chassin (2002). (The specific thresholds we used\nare presented in Table 1.)\nWe use hospitalization data for residents of Arizona,\nFlorida, New Jersey, and Wisconsin for eleven surgical pro-\nregions of the United States and were chosen to capture the\nrange of patient demographic characteristics.3 These particu-\nlar years are a good period to assess patient responses to\ninformation: over the previous decade, the research literature\nidentifying the relationship between hospital volume and\nquality had grown substantially, significant efforts to inform\nthe public about hospital quality had begun, and volume\ncame to be seen as a relevant consideration for patient choice.\nwere beginning to act on this information, and there might be\nsignificant racial/ethnic differences in patient responses\nbased on access to information and the nature of decision-\nmaking complexity.\nThe data are based on hospital-reported information for\nacute care, nonfederal hospitals, collected by state agencies,\nand reported to the Health Care Utilization Project (HCUP).\nThese State Inpatient Data files include all hospitalizations\nfor nearly all nonfederal hospitals in these states. In addition\nto diagnostic and procedure information and patient charac-\nteristics, the data include patient zip codes, which were used\nto measure proximity to hospitals, and the socio-demo-\ngraphic characteristics of patients' neighborhoods, based on\nzip code tabulation area data obtained from the Bureau of the\nCensus.\nBecause of the relatively small number of observations\nfor less common procedures, we limited the descriptive por-\ntion of this analysis to only the four largest racial/ethnic\ngroups in the United States, coded into mutually exclusive\nTable 1.

Other patient characteristics obtained\nfrom the HCUP data were age, gender, insurance (Medicare,\nMedicaid, private insurance, uninsured), whether insurance\ninvolved managed care, whether the admission was a routine\nadmission (as opposed to an emergency admission), and\nwhether the patient was transferred from another hospital.\nThe complexity of the patient's condition was measured by\nan index of comorbidities (Elixhauser et al. 1998). We mea-\nsured patients' socio-economic backgrounds using Census\n2000 data for each patient's zip code, computing average\nhousehold income and educational attainment based on the\npercentage of residents over age twenty-five who have grad-\nuated from high school but not college, and the percent col-\nlege graduates.\nOther aspects of neighborhoods and geographic location\nmay be relevant too. To control for patterns of residential\nsegregation and the geographic concentration of minorities,\nwe also included the racial/ethnic composition of the zip\ncode, measured as percent African-American and percent\nLatino. There may also be differences between urban, subur-\nban, and rural areas in the access to medical care and com-\nmunication of medical information. We proxy for these\nfactors using the level of urbanization, measured by the per-\ncentages of the zip code population living in rural areas and\nin places with a population less than fifty thousand\nProximity was measured by the distance to the closest\nhospital (regardless of volume) that provides each service,\nthe distance to the nearest high-volume hospital for that ser-\nvice, and a dichotomous variable indicating whether the\nclosest hospital is also the nearest high-volume hospital.\nDistances were calculated using the geographic centroid of\nthe patient's zip code and each hospital's location as reported\nin the 2001 American Hospital Association annual survey.\nBecause multi-hospital chains often report only a single\nheadquarters address, and because of limited address infor-\nmation on some hospitals, we supplemented this information\nwith street address information obtained from other sources.\nTo measure the complexity of patient choices, we deter-\nmined the number of hospitals that provide each service\nwithin a 40-mile radius of the patient's zip code, as well as\nthe number of low-volume hospitals that are closer to the\npatient's zip code than the nearest high-volume hospital.5 For\nour measure of local medical experience, we calculated a\npopulation-based incidence rate of each procedure using the\nnumber of procedures aggregated to the three-digit zip code\narea divided by total population for that area.\nResults\nThe left-hand columns of Table 1 present rates of high-vol-\nume hospital use for the eleven services. Our main disparity\nmeasure is the difference between the fraction\nusing high-volume hospitals for each minority group and the\nfraction for whites, which we present in the center columns.\nFor patients from all distances, African-Americans have sig-\nnificantly lower rates than whites for nine of the eleven ser-\nvices, and Latinos have significantly lower rates for six of\nthe eleven. For Asians, the sample sizes and the differences\nfrom the white rates are smaller, and the pattern is more\nmixed.\nAfrican-Americans, Latinos, and Asians living in the\nUnited States and in these four study states are more likely\nthan whites to live in urban areas, and because proximity is\nimportant for hospital utilization, these disparity measures\nmay be partially misleading. A simple correction for geo-\ngraphic accessibility is to limit the sample to patients living\nwithin 10 miles of a high-volume hospital (right-hand col-\numns). In general, the observed rates of high-volume hospi-\ntal use are higher with this sample restriction, and this is\nespecially true for whites, as they typically live farther from\nhigh-volume hospitals. Limited to patients with ready geo-\ngraphic access, much larger racial/ethnic disparities are\nobserved. For both African-Americans and Latinos, ten of\nthe eleven services show a significant disparity compared\nwith whites, with differences ranging between 5 and 23 per-\ncentage points.And with this sample restriction,Asians show\ndisparities relative to whites, although these gaps are gener-\nally smaller than for the other two minority groups, and only\nfour are significant.\nTo determine whether information availability and deci-\nsion complexity are associated with disparities in hospital\nuse, we focused on six of these services. These services have\nsufficiently large sample sizes to support multivariate model-\ning for the largest racial/ethnic groups, although because\nsample sizes for Asians are much smaller, we also limited the\nrest of this analysis to whites, African-Americans, and\nLatinos. Table 2 presents several descriptive measures of\nproximity, choice complexity, and local experience which\nshow important differences for white and minority patients.\nThe top two sets of lines show that whites' greater usage of\nhigh-volume hospitals is not because these hospitals are\ncloser: For all six services, whites live farther from high-\nvolume hospitals than either African-Americans or Latinos.\nAt the same time, whites may have one decision-making\nadvantage: although living farther away from hospitals in\ngeneral, for whites, the closest hospital is more often a high-\nvolume hospital.\nImportantly for our analysis of choice complexity, the\ndata indicate that many patients face large choice sets, and\nthese choice sets are larger for minority patients: white\npatients typically live in markets with twenty to twenty-two\nhospitals offering the service, while minority patients face\ntwenty-six to thirty hospitals.6 Less than half of these hospi-\ntals are high-volume and for some services, only a small\nfraction meets the designated volume thresholds. Moreover,\nwhile there are more high-volume hospitals in market areas\nwhere minorities live, there are typically additional\nKronebusch et al. 7\nlow-volume hospitals that also provide these services. The\nresult is that compared with whites, minorities generally face\na choice context that features both a higher number of lower-\nvolume hospitals that are closer than the nearest high-volume\nhospital and a lower chance that the closest hospital is a high-\nvolume hospital.\nFinally, a third aspect of information availability is the\nexperience embedded in local social networks. As shown in\nTable 2, minorities tend to live in areas with lower levels of\nthis experience-based information availability, as measured\nby lower levels of utilization and lower percentages living in\nareas with above average utilization rates for the six\nservices.\nMultivariate Modeling\nThe descriptive statistics suggest that proximity, choice\ncomplexity, and local experience may affect minorities and\nwhites differently, and might help explain a portion of the\ndisparities identified in Table 1. To examine these factors\ntogether and to control for other confounding influences, we\nestimated a series of linear regressions, modeling the deci-\nsion about using high-volume hospitals as a dichotomous\nchoice.7 In Table 3, we present the key results from these\nWe discuss the results in two steps: First, we present the\nresults for the main effect coefficients--results that apply\nto all patients, including minority patients. These main\neffect results indicate strong and statistically significant\neffects consistent with the approach we outlined above.\nAs the decision contexts faced by minority patients differ\nfrom those of white patients (see the summary statistics\npresented in Table 2), adjusting for these main effects has a\nsubstantial impact on explaining racial/ethnic disparities in\nhigh-volume hospital use, a finding which we will highlight\nlater in our presentation of Table 4.\nWe follow this with a discussion that focuses on the coef-\nficients measuring the interactions for race and ethnicity.

The percentage of high school graduates, the percentage\nof college graduates, average household income, the percentage of African-Americans, the percentage of Latinos, and the percentages living in rural areas and places with populations of less than 50,000\npersons are measured at the five-digit zip code level using the Census 2000 Zip Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) files.

Local utilization rates were calculated at the three-digit zip code level for each service and\nrepresent total cases per 1,000 population. The models also include fixed effects for the states (Florida, New Jersey, Wisconsin, Arizona). Because of relatively small sample sizes, patients coded as Asian/\nPacific Islander, American Indians/Alaska Natives, Other race, or unknown race were excluded from the data sets used for these estimates.\naFor each complexity measure, the results include both a main effect coefficient (on the line with a description of the variable), and two coefficients for interactions with African-American and Latino (on\nlines with the name of the racial/ethnic group).

The Main Effects Models and the models with race/ethnicity interactions both control for\ndemographic and medical characteristics, payment source, neighborhood demographic and urbanization characteristics, and state fixed effects. For details about variable specification, see note on Table 3.\nKronebusch et al. 11\nsome procedures and specific minority groups, the interac-\ntion results modify the main effects, but except for the level\nof local experience and certain aspects of proximity and\ncomplexity, the interaction results generally indicate only a\nmodest degree of differential responsiveness by minority\ngroup members. The net impacts on use of high-volume hos-\npitals are largely determined by the main effects results in\ncombination with the substantial differences in the decision-\nmaking context for minorities.\nMain effects.The coefficients for the decision making vari-\nables are presented in the lower portion of Table 3.The main\neffect coefficients provide evidence that all three factors are\nassociated with use of high-volume facilities.9 As we pro-\nposed in Hypothesis 1, local experience has an impact, with\nhigher levels of local experience associated with greater use\nof high-volume hospitals for all but one service. These coef-\nficients imply that an increased local utilization rate of one\ncase per thousand would be associated with a 3 to 5 percent-\nage point increase in patient use of a high-volume hospital.10\nOur second hypothesis concerned choice complexity. The\nestimated coefficients for the choice complexity variables\nare in the expected negative direction for three of the ser-\nvices, although this is combined with positive coefficients\nfor some services. Consider first the effect of one additional\nhospital within 40 miles: such a change alters the probability\nof obtaining care at a high-volume hospital by 0.1 to 0.3 per-\ncentage points. In urban areas with numerous hospitals, the\ncumulative effect for these services would be larger: patients\nliving in an area with ten additional hospitals would have a\nreduction in high-volume hospital use of up to 3 percentage\npoints. Much more important quantitatively are the estimated\nimpacts of our separate measure of complexity and local hos-\npital diversion: as hypothesized, an additional lower-volume\nhospital that is closer than the nearest high-volume hospital\nreduces high-volume hospital use--by 5.5 percentage points\nfor coronary bypasses and 2 to 3 percentage points for carotid\nendarterectomy, lung cancer surgery, and total hip replace-\nment. The effects are smaller but still negative for total knee\nreplacement and open prostatectomy.\nDistance to the nearest high-volume hospital has a nega-\ntive relationship to high-volume hospital use, and distance to\nthe closest hospital also affects hospital use. Patients for\nwhom the closest hospital is a high-volume hospital are more\nlikely to receive their care at a high-volume hospital. The\ncoefficients on the distance to the nearest high-volume hos-\ncients, consider a change in distance of 10 miles: depending\non the service, patients who live an additional 10 miles far-\nther from a high-volume hospital are 2 to 8 percentage points\nless likely to receive their care at high-volume hospitals. The\neffects of distance to the closest hospital are comparable in\nmagnitude--a difference of 10 miles alters the use of high-\nvolume hospitals by 3 to 12 percentage points.11 The dichot-\nomous variable indicating that the closest hospital is\nhigh-volume has a large impact, increasing high-volume\nhospital use between 12 and 38 percentage points.\nInteraction effects.The interactions included in the Table 3\nmodels allow the coefficients for proximity, choice complex-\nity, and local experience to vary across the racial/ethnic\ngroups, which permits us to test for whether disparities arise\nbecause racial/ethnic minorities are differentially responsive\nto complexity compared with white patients, or whether dis-\nparities arise because minorities are disproportionately\nlocated in urban hospital markets that feature a higher level\nof complexity.\nWe start by observing that a large portion of the estimated\ninteractions are not significant\u00adindicating that minority\npatients are not clearly behaving differently compared with\nwhites. These more ambiguous interaction results contrast\nquite strongly with the main effects results, for which nearly\nall of the estimated coefficients are statistically significant and\nlarge enough to be substantively relevant. For the interactions,\nof the seventy-two estimated coefficients (six variables of\ninterest for two minority groups for six services), slightly less\nthan half (32 of 72) are significant at the 5-percent level.\nSecond, the interaction results that are significant and\nconsistent indicate that African-Americans and Latinos are\ncomparatively more responsive to local experience than are\nwhites for several services, as we proposed in our first\nhypothesis. In particular, this is the case for coronary artery\nbypass and carotid endarterectomy for both African-\nAmericans and Latinos, and for total knee replacement and\nlung cancer surgery for Latinos. For coronary bypass,\ncarotid endarterectomy, and total knee replacement, the esti-\nmated interaction coefficients for the two minority groups\nare comparable in magnitude to the estimated main effects,\nand thus minorities are shown to be approximately twice as\nresponsive to local experience as are white patients.12 This\nenhanced responsiveness, however, is not shown for the\nremaining services. As we argued above, minority patients\nsuffer from a number of information and choice-related dis-\nadvantages when seeking specialized care. The results for\nour measure of local experience indicate that when they live\nin neighborhoods where there is a higher level of experi-\nence, they disproportionately benefit from the experience of\ntheir neighbors.\nThe presence of a high-volume hospital as the closest hos-\npital increases use of high-volume hospitals by African-\nAmericans for carotid endarterectomy, lung cancer surgery,\nand total knee replacement. We hypothesized that less well-\ninformed patients will tend to use nearby hospitals, and when\nthe very closest hospital is also a high-volume hospital, the\nresult is a greater likelihood of receiving care at a high-vol-\nume facility. But this effect was not found for Latinos--for\ntwo services, Latinos benefited less--suggesting that other\nfactors besides proximity are affecting Latino hospital use.\nThe remaining interaction results include coefficients that\nare small in magnitude, inconsistent in direction across\nminority groups, and generally statistically insignificant.\nThis is the case for the interaction coefficients for the dis-\ntance variables, supporting a conclusion that except for the\nproximity effect associated with a nearby high-volume hos-\npital, the effects of distance are similar for white and minor-\nity patients. For the measures of complexity--that is, the\ninteractions with the number of hospitals and the number of\nhospitals closer than the nearest high-volume hospital--\nthere are a number of significant coefficients. However, the\nmagnitudes of the estimated interaction effects are often\nsmall. For both measures of complexity, the main effects\ndominate the results, again indicating that for these factors,\nwhite and minority patients are not very different from each\nother in their responses to choice complexity.\nThus, except for local experience and certain aspects of\nproximity and complexity, the results do not indicate a high\nlevel of differential responsiveness, but instead, the general\npattern is that patients of all races and ethnicities are affected\nby complexity in a similar way, with differences mostly due\nto the market contexts where patients live. We assess this in\nTable 4, which reports the results of simulated probability\ncalculations for each racial/ethnic group using the models we\nestimated. The first set of rows in the table provides the\nunadjusted probabilities and differences between the racial/\nethnic groups shown in Table 1. The second and third sets of\nrows give the results of the simulations.\nThese simulations used the sample means and the esti-\nmated coefficients from the models to calculate the proba-\nbilities that would be expected if members of each of the\nracial/ethnic groups are assumed to be living in \"average\"\nmarket circumstances. For the second set, we use the over-\nall sample averages and the coefficients from a simplified\nmodel that estimates only main effects coefficients for our\nkey variables of interest and coefficients for the control\nvariables included in the models. For the third set of results,\nwe use the interacted models presented in Table 3 that\ninclude racial/ethnic interactions with those key variables.\nComparing the first and second sets of predicted probabili-\nties shows the effects of our basic model, while the differ-\nences between the second and third sets of probabilities\nreveal the additional effects of incorporating the interaction\ncoefficients into the model.\nCompared with the unadjusted probabilities, the full\nmodel (third set of lines) reduces the disparity gaps substan-\ntially: For African-Americans, the unadjusted gap of 7 to 18\npercentage points across the range of services is reduced to 5\nto 9 percentage points; for Latinos, the unadjusted gap of 5 to\n26 percentage points is reduced to 0 to 17 percentage points.\nAcross the six services, the mean unadjusted disparity gap is\n13 percentage points for African-Americans and about 14\npercentage points for Latinos. The full model reduces this to\n6.3 to 6.8 percentage points. For five of the six services--all\nexcept open prostatectomy--the gap is reduced by at least\none-third, and for several services, the adjustment reduces\nthe disparity gap by more than half of the unadjusted gap.\nHowever, comparing the second and third sets of results\nshows that most of this gain is achieved by a model that uses\nthe main effects for our key variables, and that adding racial/\nethnic interactions only modestly improves the level of\nexplanation. For example, for total knee replacement, the\nunadjusted differences are 15.4 percentage points for\nAfrican-Americans compared with whites, and 15.2 percent-\nage points for Latinos versus whites. Using our main effects\nmodel, the predicted rate of high-volume hospital use for\nminority patients rises, and the differences with whites\ndecline: to 8.5 percentage points for African-Americans and\n10.4 percentage points for Latinos. Adding the interactions\nin the final model reduces these differences to 6.1 and 9.7\npercentage points, only moderately different from the differ-\nences that result from using the predicted probabilities of the\nmain effects model. Averaging across the six services, the\nmain effects models for both African-Americans and Latinos\nreduce the apparent disparity with whites by about 6.6 to 7.3\npercentage points for these services. On average, the models\nwith the additional racial/ethnic interactions reduce this fur-\nther by only 0.3 to 0.5 percentage points.\nImpact of Complexity\nThe multivariate results show that, at least for decisions to\nuse high-volume hospitals, there are impacts associated with\nthe presence of nearby, low-volume hospitals, which divert\npatients away from high-volume hospitals. To provide a\nmore intuitive appreciation of this, we present the rates of\nhigh-volume hospital use for patients living in different\nchoice contexts. In Table 5, patients are stratified based on\nthe number of hospitals closer than the nearest high-volume\nhospital. As the number of additional nearby hospitals\nincreases, use of a high-volume hospital declines--an effect\nthat occurs for all racial/ethnic groups. For example, 87 per-\ncent of white patients use a high-volume hospital for coro-\nnary bypass if there are no low-volume hospitals closer than\nthe nearest high-volume hospital, but this falls to 59 percent\nif there is one low-volume hospital that is closer. Similarly,\nthe rates for African-Americans and Latinos fall from 78 to\n79 percent to 49 to 54 percent. For nearly all of the combina-\ntions of services and hospital contexts shown in the table, the\nreduction in high-volume hospital use associated with sim-\nply adding a nearby low-volume hospital is larger than the\nsize of the disparity gap between whites and minorities.\nImportantly, the results in Table 5 show that while this\neffect occurs for all racial/ethnic groups, it is larger for\nAfrican-Americans and Latinos than for whites, so racial/\nethnic disparities in the use of high-volume hospitals grow as\nthis form of complexity increases. Moreover, because minor-\nities are more likely to live in areas that feature a larger num-\nber of nearby low-volume hospitals (see Table 2), they will\nbe disproportionately located in the hospital choice contexts\ndefined by the lower lines of the table. The combined effects\nof greater sensitivity to choice complexity and location in\nTable 5.

Because of this, they may be especially interested in\nreceiving care at familiar institutions. These are not neces-\nsarily the closest facilities, and this leads us to one additional\nobservation based on these data.\nIn general, it would be expected that more familiar institu-\ntions will include those that are geographically closest to\npatients. But the institutions that patients or their social cir-\ncles are familiar with in a particular area may also be slightly\nfarther away, especially in urban areas where there are a\nnumber of hospitals within a relatively short distance. Indeed,\nfamiliarity may lead patients to use hospitals that appear to\nbe less conveniently located than the nearest high-volume\nhospital, and this may account for surprising differences in\nthe patterns of minority hospital use compared with that\nobserved for white patients.\nIn Table 6, we separate patients into two groups, based on\nwhether the closest hospital providing the service is a high-\nor low-volume hospital. For the most part, when the closest\nhospital exceeds the volume threshold, minorities and whites\nare similar in their use of this facility, although for coronary\nbypasses, modest differences do seem to exist.\nMore striking and persistent racial/ethnic differences\nemerge among those who use a hospital that is more distant\nthan the nearest high-volume hospital. White patients who\ndo this are far more likely (for five of the six procedures) to\nuse another high-volume hospital. Similarly, when the clos-\nest hospital is a low-volume hospital, for all six services,\nwhites are more likely than minorities to bypass this hospital\nin favor of a high-volume hospital. In contrast, whenAfrican-\nAmericans and Latinos bypass the closest, high-volume hos-\npital, they disproportionately receive care at a low-volume\nhospital. Similarly, when they bypass a low-volume hospital,\nthey are also more likely to receive care at another low-vol-\nume hospital. Thus, for both forms of bypass, a dispropor-\ntionate share of minorities who do not use the closest hospital\nultimately receive care in lower-volume hospitals, while\nwhites who engage in bypass are more likely to obtain care at\na high-volume hospital.\nLimitations\nWe note several limitations for this analysis. First, we used\nselected based on the availability of patient zip code infor-\nmation essential for our analysis and to capture the range of\nracial/ethnic groups in the United States. These states are\nbroadly similar to the nation as a whole, but our data are not\na nationally representative sample. At this point, we do not\nhave information that disparities in high-volume hospital use\nhave changed over time, but starting around 2008, critiques\nof the volume\u00adoutcome literature began to emerge, and this\nhas the potential for altering patient and provider decision\nmaking. It is not clear that this would alter our analysis of the\nimpacts of complexity on hospital decisions for minority\npatients, but additional analyses that examine more recent\ntime periods and different locations will enhance our under-\nstanding of how patients use hospitals, and racial/ethnic dif-\nferences in those decisions.\nSecond, the data available for our regression models\nallowed us to control for a broad range of patient-level char-\nacteristics that may affect hospital use, but these data do not\ninclude individual or family income or individual-level edu-\ncational attainment. We constructed proxy measures for\nthese characteristics using zip code\u00adlevel income and educa-\ntion, but these are not perfect measures of individual patient\ncharacteristics. We also control for the racial/ethnic compo-\nsition of patient neighborhoods, and level of urbanization,\nbut it is possible that there are also other neighborhood and\ncommunity-level character-istics that affect hospital use.\nThird, because our data are based on hospital discharge\nrecords, we do not have information about patient percep-\ntions about hospitals, the medical care that may have pre-\nceded the hospitalization, and the knowledge and perceptions\nof their physicians. We also are assuming that the count of\nnumber of patients receiving a particular service is an accu-\nrate measure of volume, and we lack other potential mea-\nsures of the quality of care beyond measured volume. It is\npossible that there are unmeasured aspects of quality that we\nfail to observe because of our use of volume as a proxy for\nquality. We also are unable to observe details about the\nadministration of health insurance. Compared with whites,\nracial/ethnic minorities may be more likely to obtain insur-\nance through managed care plans, and the plans that minori-\nties join may impose relatively greater restrictions on\nutilization and on access to specialists and hospitals than the\nplans that serve white patients. Unfortunately, we lack infor-\nmation on all of these issues, which limits somewhat our\nunderstanding of why patients of different racial and ethnic\ngroups use the hospitals that they do.\nOur results also indicated some differences by racial/eth-\nnic group that we are unable to explain. The economic and\nsocial circumstances of each racial/ethnic group differ, and\nfactors other than information and decision complexity\nundoubtedly contribute to what sources of medical care are\nused. One difficulty, however, is that there are more limited\nsample sizes for racial/ethnic minorities, reducing our ability\nto estimate precisely group differences.\nFinally, it should be noted that the market complexity\nassociated with multiple competing hospitals presents not\njust an information challenge for patients and the profes-\nsionals who serve these patients. The existence of multiple\nTable 6.

So, the percentages for those with a high-volume closest hospital sum to 100\npercent, as do the percentages for those with a low-volume closest hospital.\nhospitals and the referral patterns that emerge among pri-\nmary care providers, specialists, and hospitals in these mar-\nkets may also lead to segmentation of an area's medical\nmarket and potentially the emergence of de facto segrega-\ntion of care that may disadvantage racial/ethnic minorities.\nFuture analyses should examine how race and ethnicity\ninteract with historical limitations in access to care, neigh-\nborhood residential segregation, provider referral patterns,\nand hospital market segmentation. These analyses will be\nhelpful for understanding the full range of factors that affect\nmedical care for minority patients and will assist in design-\ning interventions that will enhance patient choices even in\nthe context of complexity and existing patterns of hospital\nuse.\nDiscussion\nThese results show that racial/ethnic disparities in the use of\nhigh-volume hospitals are common. Our analysis highlights\nseveral ways that the decision-making complexity faced by\nminority patients is associated with lower use of high-vol-\nume hospitals. Our results show that patients of all racial/\nethnic groups are affected by decision-making complexity,\nbut minorities face greater levels of complexity: African-\nAmericans and Latinos differ from whites with respect to the\nvolume status of their closest hospitals, the degree of choice\ncomplexity in their areas, and the extent of local experience\nwith specialized services.\nAs a result, minorities are less well situated than white\npatients. Although they live closer than whites to high-vol-\nume hospitals on average, minorities live in areas with rela-\ntively limited local experience with specialized hospital\nservices, are more likely to reside in places that have multi-\nple, competing hospitals, and are less likely have a high-vol-\nume hospital as their geographically closest hospital. These\ndifferences are associated with significant reductions in their\nuse of high-volume hospitals, and these differences persist\neven after controlling for a wide range of individual-level\ndemographic and economic characteristics, as well as neigh-\nborhood characteristics including income, education, urban-\nization, and racial/ethnic residential patterns.\nMinorities appear to be somewhat more sensitive to the\neffects of local experience and proximity. But for the most\npart, our results indicate that minority patients are generally\nnot very different from whites in their responses to complex-\nity. Importantly, even when the degree of responsiveness is\nsimilar, minority patients tend to live in market circum-\nstances where they face higher levels of complexity and\nlower levels of local experience than are typical for white\npatients. These differences in circumstances affect the likeli-\nhood of receiving care at high-volume hospitals.\nOur results are consistent with the expected behavior of\npatients with limited connections to sources of medical advice\nwho, as a result, are less able to act on quality differences\namong hospitals. As we hypothesized, overall cognitive\ncomplexity does have an effect, but these effects are much\nsmaller in magnitude than the diversionary effects associated\nwith the presence of alternative nearby hospitals. And so, the\ndecision-making complexity that is most prominent is not the\nexistence of numerous hospitals and \"choice overload\" per\nse, but the particular difficulties that arise when there are a\nnumber of low-volume hospitals nearby. For the goal of\nencouraging patients, especially minority patients, to use\nhigher-volume hospitals, optimal patient decision making\nmay require that they, in effect, adopt new decision heuristics\nto shift their attention away from more familiar, but low-vol-\nume hospitals, in favor of higher-volume hospitals that are\ntypically geographically accessible as well.\nWe cannot provide here a full analysis of potential policy\ninterventions that might facilitate such a change, nor can we\ndiscuss all of the potential trade-offs that might be raised\nabout potential interventions. But given the importance of\nthese disparities, it may be helpful to comment on a few pos-\nsible policy implications of our results.\nThese results reveal one negative consequence of hospital\nmarket competition: the existence of multiple, nearby hospi-\ntals that provide specialized services tends to reduce the\noverall use of high-volume hospitals, and this effect is par-\nticularly important for minorities living in urban hospital\nmarkets. Market competition may have other beneficial\neffects, giving hospitals, under certain conditions, an incen-\ntive to reduce costs, improve quality, and to serve additional\npatients. But patients in general and minorities in particular\nmight benefit from a reduction in the number of low-volume\nproviders of volume-sensitive services. To the extent that\nvolume is causally related to quality, efforts to consolidate\nvolume-sensitive services at particular hospitals would\nimprove the quality of medical care. And from the standpoint\nof decision making and cognitive overload, fewer hospitals\nproviding a service would reduce the complexity of the\nchoice situation and the possibility that patients and their\nreferring physicians would choose a relatively low-volume\nhospital.\nThe results for local experience suggest that a higher level\nof information within a community is beneficial for patient\ndecision making in general, and additional local experience\noften has an especially large benefit for minority patients,\nwhich we argue is due to their more limited access to infor-\nmation and sources of medical advice. This in turn implies\nthat efforts to disseminate information about quality differ-\nences and to improve connections with providers might lead\nto better decisions. In recent years, there has been consider-\nable interest in using web-based sources and computer tech-\nnology to enhance the level of information available to\npatients and their physicians. While it has the theoretical\npotential for improving decision making, when there is deci-\nsion-making complexity, additional information may not\nhave this effect, and if patients differ in how well they can act\non it, greater information may even aggravate racial/ethnic\ndisparities and other disparities associated with income and\nKronebusch et al. 17\neducation. From the standpoint of reducing racial/ethnic dis-\nparities in hospital use, it is important that the information be\ntailored to address the choice complexities faced by minori-\nties and that steps be taken to improve the connectedness of\nminority patients to high-quality physicians and specialists\nto facilitate decision making about hospital care. Without\ntaking account of these issues, simply introducing additional\nconsumer information using new technology may not achieve\nthe desired improvement in minority health care.\nAs others have suggested (Bach et al. 2004; Jha et al.\n2007), it is also possible that quality-improvement interven-\ntions could be focused on the hospitals that minority patients\nalready use, thereby reducing the need for patients to under-\nstand hospital quality variations and to incur the costs and\ndifficulties of choosing among multiple competing hospitals.\nGiven the decision-making challenges involved in the choice\nof hospitals, it may be unrealistic to expect that simply pro-\nviding additional quality-related information about hospitals\nwill alter patients' hospital choices to any substantial degree,\nparticularly for procedures about which they may have little\nor no previous experience. But quality improvement efforts\ncan still enhance many aspects of quality at these hospitals\nand can lead to better patient outcomes. Implementing these\napproaches is particularly important in the subset of hospi-\ntals that are disproportionately used by minority patients.\nFinally, anything that might shift the decision heuristics\ncurrently used by patients and referring physicians could\nhave significant social benefits, especially for minority\npatients who face the disadvantages of a more complex\nchoice context and more limited connectedness to medical\nadvice. Our results show that a significant fraction of minor-\nity patients are actually bypassing high-volume hospitals in\nfavor of lower-volume hospitals that are located farther\naway. Any intervention that would reduce the number of\nminority patients who bypass high-volume hospitals would\nhave a measurable effect on the overall use of high-volume\nhospitals for minorities. As one example of bypassing behav-\nior, consider coronary artery bypass surgery. If the rate at\nwhich African-American patients bypass a high-volume hos-\npital in favor of a more distant lower-volume hospital could\nbe altered, this by itself could increase the rate of high-vol-\nume hospital use by African-Americans by 3 to 8 percentage\npoints.13 As the overall disparity between blacks and whites\nfor this service is 14.5 percentage points, even a modest\nchange of 3 to 8 percentage points would represent an impor-\ntant reduction in the current disparity gap. One potential\ndecision heuristic for patients and physicians would be to\ndetermine whether the nearest hospital is a high-volume hos-\npital for a particular service, and if so, to simply use that\nhospital rather than some other nearby hospital. Widespread\nadoption of this heuristic would simultaneously improve\npatient outcomes, increase convenience, and reduce decision\ncomplexity. It is not clear, however, what kind of interven-\ntion would alter patient and physician decision making to\naccomplish this.\nDecision-making complexity and the market environment\nare clearly not the only factors important for understanding\nracial/ethnic disparities. Minority groups in the United States\ncontinue to suffer from the effects of discrimination, de facto\nsegregation in housing and access to services, and a wide\nrange of economic and social disadvantages. To this, our con-\ntribution is to add the finding that the medical market context\nfor minorities differs as well. Those areas feature multiple,\ncompeting hospitals, and complex physician and hospital\nreferral patterns. Interventions designed to enhance patient\ndecision making and efforts to ameliorate racial/ethnic dis-\nparities will need to give explicit attention to these local hos-\npital environments, the potential racial/ethnic segmentation\nof the market, the nature of patient connectedness to the med-\nical care system, and the information demands of this com-\nplexity. For minority patients, the complexity of these\nenvironments compounds the more general disadvantages\nthey face, including more limited access to services and more\nlimited levels of economic and social resources, and contrib-\nutes to the persistence of racial and ethnic inequalities.\n"
