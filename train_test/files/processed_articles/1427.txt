Age at natural menopause has also been proposed as a\nmarker of ovarian toxicity for factors that may directly or\nindirectly damage the follicular pool (4). Approximately\n5\u00ad10 percent of women in the United States experience nat-\nural menopause by age 45 years, and the median age at\nmenopause is approximately 51 years (5). Numerous studies\nlier age at natural menopause among current smokers com-\npared with women who had never smoked.

A few (18\u00ad20) have used the hormonal marker\nfollicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). FSH concentrations\nmay increase for up to several years before menstrual cycles\nWe examined the associations between lifestyle, demo-\ngraphic, and reproductive factors (specifically, body mass\nindex, exercise, alcohol use, ethnicity, education, age at\nmenarche, pregnancy history, and oral contraceptive use)\nand menopause in women of late reproductive age from a\nrepresentative sample of the United States population. The\nuse of both menstrual and hormonal measures of menopause\nallows us to determine consistencies and inconsistencies\nbetween them.\nThe Third National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey (NHANES III) was a national, cross-sectional,\npopulation-based study of 33,994 noninstitutionalized,\ncivilian persons aged 2 months to 74 years conducted\nStatistics. NHANES III was designed to evaluate the nutri-\ntional and health statuses of the United States population\nand used a stratified, multistage sampling procedure to\nselect the study sample. Data collection included a stan-\ndardized in-person interview, blood sample, physical exam-\nination, and other clinical and laboratory procedures (23).\nWe selected NHANES III women aged 35\u00ad49 (n \n2,205) for study. This age restriction was chosen because we\nwere interested in factors that affected early menopause.\nThe reasons for exclusion varied somewhat between the\nanalysis of menstrual patterns status and FSH (table 1), but\n227 women were excluded from both analyses because of\nspecific medical indications or medication use (bilateral\noophorectomy, current oral contraceptive use, and\nmenopause related to chemotherapy or radiation) that pre-\ncluded assessment of current menstrual periods and FSH\nlevels. For the analyses of menstrual patterns, 274 women\nwho had had surgical menopause (hysterectomy) or had an\nuncertain menopausal status were excluded. For the FSH\nanalyses, women who had had a hysterectomy without bilat-\neral oophorectomy were included, but 184 women who were\ncurrently pregnant or breastfeeding or who had missing hor-\nmone or oophorectomy data were excluded.\nAt the time of the blood draw, women were asked, \"About\nhow long ago was your last period,\" with response cate-\nmonths ago. Women who had not had a period in the previ-\nous 12 months were asked about their age at their last\nperiod. FSH concentrations in postmenopausal women far\nexceed those found at any time during the premenopausal\nmenstrual cycle, but perimenopausal FSH can be similar in\nconcentration to increases seen at time of ovulation for pre-\nmenopausal women. Since the blood samples were not\ntimed to a specific day of the cycle, some samples were\ntaken around the time of ovulation and could not be used to\nassess menopausal status reliably. The rise in luteinizing\nhormone is greater than that in FSH around the time of ovu-\nlation, with luteinizing hormone-to-FSH ratios of 1.5\u00ad2.0 or\nhigher (24). In contrast, FSH tends to rise before luteinizing\nhormone during the premenopausal years, resulting in a\nluteinizing hormone-to-FSH ratio of less than 1.0 (21). On\nthe basis of this information, we excluded 65 women with a\nratio of luteinizing hormone to FSH higher than 2.0 to\nreduce the potential influence of increases in FSH that occur\naround ovulation.\nUse of hormone replacement therapy may present some\ndifficulties in the classification of menopausal status based on\neither menstrual cycles or FSH because of withdrawal bleed-\ning that can occur with progestins and because of a suppres-\nsive effect of estrogen on FSH. However, excluding users of\nhormone replacement therapy could introduce a selection bias\ninto the study, and including hormone replacement therapy\nuse in the logistic regression models could produce attenuated\nestimates due to overadjustment of an intermediary variable.\nWe included 19 women who were currently using hormone\nreplacement therapy in the analysis of menopause based on\nmenstrual cycles. Twelve of the women were classified as\npostmenopausal (>12 months since the last menstrual period),\nand seven were classified as perimenopausal. We also exam-\nined the effect of hormone replacement therapy on FSH by\nyears with a bilateral oophorectomy, 85 percent of the women\nwho were currently using hormone replacement therapy pills\nhad an FSH that exceeded 20 IU/liter compared with 86 per-\ncent of nonusers. However, the prevalence of very high (>40\nIU/liter) levels was somewhat lower among hormone replace-\nment therapy users (52 percent compared with 67 percent for\nnonusers; odds ratio (OR)  0.5, 95 percent confidence inter-\nentiated between 50 premenopausal and 49 oophorectomized\nwomen in a study by Nordin et al. (25). For these reasons, we\nchose to define elevated FSH as above 20 IU/liter, and we\nincluded 59 current users of hormone replacement therapy in\nthe FSH analysis.\nAfter all exclusions, there were 1,555 premenopausal\nwomen (1,520 who had had a period in the previous 2\nmonths, 19 currently pregnant, and 16 currently breastfeed-\nTABLE 1.

There were 1,721\nThe interview data collected in NHANES III included\ninformation on age, ethnicity, education, smoking history,\nmenopausal status, use of birth control pills, use of hormone\nreplacement therapy, number of pregnancies, and number of\nlivebirths. Information on alcohol use was obtained from the\nfood frequency questionnaire that included three questions\nabout usual consumption over the previous month of beer\nand light beer, wine, wine coolers, sangria, champagne, and\nhard liquor. An additional question asked about frequency of\nbinge drinking (nine or more drinks in a day) over the pre-\nvious 12 months. Categorization of exercise was based on\nthe summation of self-reported frequency of eight specific\nactivities (running/jogging, bicycling, swimming, aerobics,\nother dancing, calisthenics, gardening, and lifting weights)\nduring the previous month. Height and weight were mea-\nsured as part of the physical examination and were used to\ncalculate body mass index (kg/m2). We divided body mass\nindex based on cutpoints defining obesity that were used in\na previous analysis of National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES) data (26).\nFSH was measured in NHANES III by using an immuno-\nradiometric assay (FSH MAIAclone, Serono Diagnostics,\nEast Walpole, Massachusetts).

We then looked for evidence of con-\nfounding between these variables by examining the change\nin associations when combinations of variables that could be\ncorrelated (e.g., body mass index and exercise; education\nand ethnicity; and body mass index, ethnicity, and educa-\ntion) were added to the model. We stratified by smoking sta-\ntus to examine the possible interaction between smoking\nand body mass index. This interaction was reported in a pre-\nvious study (7). Results are presented in terms of odds ratios\nand 95 percent confidence intervals.\nWe used logistic regression to analyze the prevalence of\nelevated FSH (>20 IU/liter). In addition to age, smoking,\nand unilateral oophorectomy, we adjusted for hysterectomy\nin this model (20). The analytic strategy was similar to the\nprocess described for the analysis of menstrually based\nmenopausal status.\nWe examined the effect of some of our inclusion and exclu-\nsion decisions by comparing results with subsets of the data.\nFor example, we included 35 women who were currently\npregnant or breastfeeding in the analysis of menopausal status\nbased on menstrual cycles and classified them as pre-\nmenopausal. There was little difference in the observed asso-\nciations when we excluded these women. We also repeated the\nanalyses, limiting both sets to the 1,487 women who had FSH\nand the menstrually defined measure of menopausal status, to\ndetermine whether any differences in the associations that we\nobserved could be attributed to differences in the sample. Our\nresults were similar when using this more limited sample. We\npresent the results from the larger, more representative sample.\nRESULTS\nFSH was strongly correlated with the menstrually defined\nmeasure of menopause (figure 1).

Similar, but somewhat\nweaker, associations were seen with alcohol use. Little asso-\nciation was seen with perimenopausal status with either\nexposure. Binge drinking (nine or more drinks per day at\nleast once during the previous year) was reported by only 5\npercent of the study participants. The patterns of association\nwith binge drinking (OR for being postmenopausal  0.4, 95\nCI: 0.3, 1.7) were similar to the associations with the alcohol\nmeasure based on drinks per week, but, given the low fre-\nquency of this exposure, these are imprecise estimates.\nOn the basis of menstrually defined menopause, African\nAmericans had a somewhat increased likelihood of being\npostmenopausal and Hispanics were more likely to be peri-\nmenopausal, but there was little association with the hor-\nmonally defined menopause measure in either group. There\nwas little evidence of an association between FSH or men-\nstrually defined menopausal status and education level,\nnumber of livebirths, or oral contraceptive use. Additional\nadjustment for body mass index had little effect on the asso-\nciations with ethnicity or education (data not shown).\nYounger age at menarche (10 years) was somewhat associ-\nated with postmenopausal status and with increased FSH\nlevels, but the estimates were not statistically significant. No\nassociation was seen with later age at menarche.\nDISCUSSION\nThe purpose of this study was to identify factors that can\ninfluence the process of ovarian senescence, marked by\nmissed menses and elevations in FSH. Ovarian senescence\nis caused by the final demise of the prenatally determined\npool of follicles. Follicular atresia by apoptosis occurs\nthroughout a woman's life, and variation in age of\nmenopause is thought to reflect variation in rates of atresia.\nLittle is known about the biologic factors controlling atresia.\nThe menstrual-based measures of menopause allowed us\nto identify perimenopause women as a separate group.\nHowever, it does not necessarily follow that factors that\ncause early menopause would also affect perimenopause.\nPerimenopause, defined by a time of irregular menstrual\ncycling before final amenorrhea, may or may not occur. It is\npossible for women to have regular cycles up to the time of\ntheir last period, thus skipping a menstrually defined peri-\nmenopausal interval. An exposure that extended the peri-\nmenopausal interval but did not result in earlier entry into\nmenopause would be a risk factor for perimenopause but\nmight actually reduce the likelihood of menopause.\nTherefore, we evaluated menstrually defined peri-\nmenopause and postmenopause separately rather than as a\nsingle ordinal outcome.\nWe observed an association between higher body mass\nindex and reduced risk of being menopausal (OR  0.6), as\ndefined by a hormonal measure of elevated FSH. However,\nthe associations with menopausal status based on menstrual\ncycle patterns were in the opposite direction (that is, odds\nratios were greater than 1.0). Similar patterns with body\nmass index were seen in smokers and nonsmokers. Data\nfrom the Nurses' Health Study suggested that heavier\nwomen had a reduced risk of becoming menstrually post-\nmenopausal during 2 years of follow-up, but this association\nwas seen only in smokers (7).\nBecause obesity is associated with menstrual irregularity\n(29, 30), obese premenopausal women may be misclassified\nas peri- or postmenopausal. Consistent with this interpreta-\ntion, only 37 percent of very obese women (body mass index\n30.0 kg/m2) who were classified as perimenopausal based\non menstrual cycle patterns (2\u00ad12 months since the last men-\nstrual period) had an FSH of more than 20 IU/liter compared\nwith 63 percent of perimenopausal women with a lower body\ndifferences were seen with higher FSH values: 27 percent of\nthe very obese perimenopausal women had FSH values of 40\nIU/liter or more compared with 53 percent of thinner peri-\nPostmenopausal estrogen levels may be higher in obese com-\npared with nonobese women, but still are well below pre-\nmenopausal levels (31). Whether such a small change in\nestrogen could account for the low FSH in obese women\nwho reported peri- and postmenopausal status is doubtful.\nThere was an association between exercise frequency and\nreduced risk of both hormonal and menstrual menopause in\nthe NHANES data. This association has not been reported\npreviously. In our study, younger women (those aged 35\u00ad39\nyears) were somewhat more likely to exercise three or more\nso we repeated the exercise analyses, excluding women\naged 35\u00ad39. This exclusion did not appreciably change the\nassociations we had observed, so we do not think our results\nare due to residual confounding by age. Because exercise is\na modifiable behavior, it is important to examine the relation\nbetween it and menopause in additional studies, including\nprospective designs that would specifically address exercise\nhabits antecedent to menopause.\nOur analysis suggested an association between alcohol\nuse and reduced risk of hormonally or menstrually defined\nmenopause, but the relations were not statistically signifi-\ncant. Torgerson et al. (16) reported a reduced risk (OR \n0.5) of menopause with higher alcohol consumption in a\nA mechanism for an alcohol effect has not been proposed.\nNHANES included a large proportion of African\nAmericans and Hispanics. Although there was some evi-\ndence of increased risk of being postmenopausal based on\nmenstrual-cycle patterns in African Americans compared\nwith Whites, this association was not statistically signifi-\ncant, and there were no clear associations in Hispanics.\nSome other studies have reported an earlier age at\nference was statistically significant in only one of the stud-\nies (11). There was no association between education level\nand either measure of menopausal status in our analysis.\nThis finding is similar to those of other studies that adjusted\nThere was some evidence of an association between\nearly menarche (age <11 years) and earlier menopause in\nour study. Data from other studies on this question have\ntern with respect to menopausal risk and number of live-\nbirths. Several studies have reported an association\nbetween higher parity and later age at menopause (13\u00ad17)\nor perimenopause (32), but no association was seen in the\nprospective study by Brambilla et al. (9). None of these\nstudies included analyses that adjusted for body mass\nindex. Analyses of menopause in relation to oral contra-\nceptive use (11, 14, 17), like those in our analysis, do not\nprovide evidence for an association.\nThere are limitations to our study. In analyzing FSH, we\ncould not control for day of cycle, since information about\nthe exact date of the last menstrual period was not col-\nlected. However, our exclusion of participants with a ratio\nof luteinizing hormone to FSH higher than 2.0 should\nreduce the likelihood of misinterpreting an ovulation-\nrelated increase in FSH. There is an arbitrary element to\nany categorization of a continuous variable, such as we\nused with the dichotomous outcome of FSH greater than\nbeen used in clinical and epidemiologic studies of ovarian\nbecause this cutpoint differentiated between 50 pre-\nmenopausal and 49 oophorectomized women in a study by\nNordin et al. (25) and best allows for inclusion of women\nusing hormone replacement therapy. These are cross-\nsectional data, so some associations could be due to\nbehavioral changes that might occur with menopause. For\nexample, if women stopped exercising at menopause, that\ncould explain data showing that exercise is protective of\nmenopause.\nA strength of our study is that it is a population-based,\nrelatively large sample of the United States population,\nwith a substantial number of African Americans and\nHispanics included in the sample. A standardized protocol\nwas used for the interview. Collection of menstrual cycle\nand FSH data allows for analysis of both measures. These\nparallel analyses can be very informative, even (or espe-\ncially) when results are \"discrepant,\" such as are seen with\nthe analyses of body mass index. Our analysis highlights\npotential problems with the classification of menopausal\nstatus based on menstrual cycle patterns in obese women\nor those with other characteristics or exposures that affect\nmenstrual regularity.\nUnderstanding of the extent to which ovarian senes-\ncence is influenced by weight, exercise, alcohol, and other\nbehavioral or environmental factors can stimulate research\ninto the mechanisms involved in follicular atresia as\nwell as identify modifiable exposures that influence\nmenopause.\n"
