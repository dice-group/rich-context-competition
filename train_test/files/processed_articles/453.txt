A more\naccurate assessment of the relationship be-\ntween tobacco use and HbA1c\nwould be\nobtained by using a biologic marker for\nsmoking, such as cotinine, the major prox-\nimate metabolite of nicotine. Two studies\nperformed in populations with type 1 or\ntype 2 diabetes have used cotinine (7,8),\nbut to our knowledge, no study performed\namong people without diabetes has assessed\nsystematically the relationship between\nand a biologic marker of nicotine ex-\nposure.\nWe used data from the National Health\nandNutritionExaminationSurvey(NHANES)\nto assess the relationship between cotinine\namong individuals with normal\nglucose metabolism and among people\nwith impaired fasting glucose in subanaly-\nsis. Our hypothesis was that nicotine (using\neither blood cotinine or self-reported smok-\ning status asa measure of nicotine exposure)\nis associated with higher HbA1c\nin people\nwithout diabetes and in people in a predi-\nabetic state.\nMETHODS\nStudy sample\nWe analyzed data from NHANES, a nation-\nally representative, cross-sectional survey\nthat became a continuous biannual survey\nuses a complex stratified, multistage,\ncluster-sampling design to select a represen-\ntative sample of the U.S. civilian noninsti-\ntutionalized population.

Participants\nwho reported smoking at least 100 ciga-\nrettes in their entire life and smoking every\nday or some days at the time of the in-\nterview were classified as current smokers.\nParticipants who reported smoking at least\n100 cigarettes in their entire life and re-\nporting that they did not smoke at all at\nthe time of the interview were classified as\nformer smokers. Participants who reported\nsmoking fewer than 100 cigarettes during\ntheir lifetime were defined as never smok-\ners. This smoking definition has been\nwidely used (10) and classifies participants\nwho have recently initiated smoking and\nvery light smokers as never smokers.\nCotinine\nCotinine is a major metabolite of nicotine\nthat is used as a marker for active smoking\nand as an index of exposure to secondhand\nsmoke (11). Serum cotinine was measured\nusing an isotope dilution\u00adhigh perfor-\nmance liquid chromatography/atmospheric\npressure chemical ionization tandem mass\nspectrometry (12). The detection limits\nhave changed over time in NHANES: in\nFor consistency, we used the higher detec-\ntion limit (cotinine ,0.05 ng/mL). Partici-\npants below this threshold were classified as\nunexposed for all surveys as done in previ-\nous studies (13). We created cotinine cate-\ngories reflecting smoking exposures and\nused the cut point of 3 ng/mL recently pro-\nposed by Benowitz et al. (14) to distinguish\ncigarette smokers and nonsmokers. We\nchose to use this new cut point rather than\nthe older one (14 ng/mL) because it is more\nsensitive and adapted to the current rela-\ntively low level of secondhand smoke expo-\nsure in the U.S. and it would pick up light or\nnondaily smokers. Our three categories of\nnine $3 ng/mL.\nand fasting plasma glucose\nwas measured using a high perfor-\nmance liquid chromatography system.\nFasting plasma glucose was measured in\nparticipants who were examined in the\nmorning session after an 8- to 24-h fast (ap-\nproximately half of the sample examined),\nusing hexokinase enzymatic method.\nDiabetes\nDiabetes was defined based onself-reported\ndata and fasting glucose.

Race/ethnicity was categorized as\nnon-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black,\nMexican American, other Hispanic, and\nother race. Alcohol consumption was cate-\nper week. For physical activity, we consid-\nered leisure time physical activity and cate-\ngorized it in no or light, moderate, and\nvigorous.Weightandheightweremeasured\nusing standardized techniques and equip-\nment during clinical examinations. BMI\nwas calculated as weight in kilograms di-\nvided by height in meter squared. Waist\ncircumference was measured at the upper-\nmost lateral border of the ilium.\nStatistical analysis\nFor all analyses, we accounted for the\nsampling design and used sample weights\nthat account for unequal probabilities of\nselection and include adjustment for non-\ncoverage and nonresponse. In univariate\nanalysis, we calculated age-adjusted mean\naccording to cotinine and smoking\nstatus. To adjust for age, we used the direct\nand older. We built different linear regres-\nsion models to assess the relationship be-\ntween both cotinine and self-reported\nsmoking categories and HbA1c\n, the contin-\nuously distributed dependent variable. For\neach cotinine/smoking measure, we built\ntwo models. In the first model, we adjusted\nfor age only. In the second model, we ad-\njusted for age, sex, education, race/ethnicity,\nwaist, alcohol consumption, and physical\nactivity. Additional to the demographic vari-\nables, we chose to adjust for waist because it\nhas been shown that smokers tend to have\nhigher abdominal fat compared with never\nsmokers (16) and abdominal fat is a good\npredictor of insulin resistance and, hence,\nhigher HbA1c\n(17). Moreover, it has been\nshown that smokers tend to have higher al-\ncohol consumption and less physical activ-\nity compared with never smokers (18).\nBecause these factors are also associated\nwith diabetes and insulin resistance, we\nthought it was important to adjust for\nthem in our analyses. We performed test\nfor trend across categories of cotinine and\nacross categories of self-reported smoking.\nThese analyses were performed among par-\nticipants without diabetes or impaired fast-\ning glucose. In secondary analyses, we\nreplicated these analyses among people\nwith impaired fasting glucose. We also built\nlogistic regression models with cotinine/\nsmoking predicting high HbA1c\npercentile). The cutoffs for high HbA1c\nwere 5.8 mg/dL for people without diabetes\nor impaired fasting glucose and 6.1 mg/dL\nfor people with impaired fasting glucose.\nAgain, we ran age- and multivariable-\nadjusted models. Finally, we explored if\nthere was effect modification by age or eth-\nnicity and performed stratified analyses\nfor those two variables.\nStatistical tests were two-sided and P ,\n0.025 was considered statistically signifi-\ncant, based on a Bonferroni correction for\nmultiple testing of two different smoking\nexposure measures.

When we\nrepeated the analysis among people with\nimpaired fasting glucose, we also found\nthat HbA1c\nincreased with nicotine expo-\nsure, but the trend was not significant. We\ndid the same comparison according to\nself-reported smoking status and found\nsimilar results, with smokers having a\nhigher mean HbA1c\ncompared with never\nsmokers and former smokers.\nInthelinearregressionmodels(Table3),\nwe found that cotinine $3 ng/mL and\nsmoking were associated with higher\nng/mL or not smoking.

IFG, impaired fasting glucose.\nClair and Associates\nbecause ,0.2% of the nonsmokers used\nnicotine replacement therapy, we can\nconsider the group with cotinine between\nhand smoke. In this group, we observed a\nsmall increase in HbA1c\nlevels. Our find-\nings suggest that people with secondhand\nsmoke exposure should get adequate at-\ntention because they might also have met-\nabolic consequences as a result of their\npassive smoke exposure.\nThe association we have found be-\ntween self-reported smoking and HbA1c\nis\nconsistent with other cross-sectional stud-\nies (4\u00ad6). None of these studies used a bio-\nchemical marker such as cotinine to assess\nsmoking exposure. They were performed\nin smaller samples, mainly in Europe, and\nconsisted of a predominantly white popu-\nlation. Therefore, their results might not\nnecessarily have been generalized to a U.S.\nmultiethnic population.\nThe fact that cotinine is associated\nwith higher HbA1c\nsuggests that the rela-\ntionship between smoking and HbA1c\nis\nat least partly related to effects of nicotine.\nIndeed, studies have shown that nicotine\nnot only has a direct toxic effect on pan-\ncreatic b-cells (21) but also is associated\nwith increased insulin resistance (22).\nFurthermore, the antiestrogenic effect of\nnicotine could contribute to an increase in\nvisceral adipose tissue accumulation (23)\nand via this mechanism, insulin resis-\ntance. Finally, nicotine increases cortisol\nlevel (24) and inflammation and has an\ninfluence on adiponectin or peptides\nthat regulate food intake and body\nweight, all of which could contribute to\nhigher HbA1c\n.\nOur study has several strengths. First,\nwe tested the relationship between smok-\ning and glycemia using biochemically\nmeasured markers such as cotinine and\n, rather than relying on self-reported\nsmokingashas been done inthe prior stud-\nies on this question. Second, it was conduc-\nted in a nationally representative sample;\ntherefore, results may be generalized to\nthe entire nondiabetic U.S. population.\nFinally, we adjusted for many possible con-\nfounders of the relationship between smok-\ning and HbA1c\n.\nOur study has several limitations. No\ninferences can bemade oncausality because\nof the cross-sectional design of the study.\nEven though we have adjusted for many\npotential confounders, we cannot exclude\nresidual confounding or reverse causation.\nFinally, the half-life of nicotine varies be-\ntween and within individuals, and a single\nmeasure of cotinine might not necessarily\nreflect chronic nicotine exposure over\ntime.\nIn conclusion, our study suggests that\nsmoking is associated with an increase in\nin a representative sample of the\nU.S. population with normal glucose\nmetabolism as well as in people with im-\npaired fasting glucose. The dose-response\nphenomenon suggests that there might\nbe a linear relationship between cotinine\n. These results support, but do\nnot prove, the hypothesis that smoking,\nand more specifically nicotine, leads to a\npersistent increase in blood glucose levels.\n"
