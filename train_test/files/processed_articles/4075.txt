One\nprediction stemming from these models is that individual attributes associated with defeat in a given social environment could\nbe risk factors for depression. We hypothesized that in young military men, where physical prowess was important, short\nstature might constitute a risk of depression and that this risk would be specific to depression and not to other prevalent\nmental disorders such as anxiety. A preliminary analysis of the diagnostic profile of a sample of male military personnel\ntreated for mental health indicates that men both shorter and taller than average by 1 standard deviation may be predisposed\nto higher rates of depressive but not anxiety disorders. Practical and theoretical implications of our findings are discussed.\n",

In particular,\nresearchers cannot reach a consensus on whether idiopathic\nor \"normal\" short stature (SS) confers health and psycho-\nlogical disadvantages. It has been established that SS people\nof both genders are subject to stigmatization and prejudice\n(Underwood, 1991), and SS children suffer greater psycho-\nsocial stress (Zimet et al., 1997). Conversely, tall stature (TS)\nis associated with perception of higher status and achieve-\nHowever, it remains unclear whether psychosocial stress\nassociated with SS leads to substantial functional deficits. A\nnumber of large epidemiological studies have found SS to be\nassociated with poorer mental health (Cheung et al., 2013)\nand lower health-related quality of life (Christensen,\nDjurhuus, Clayton, & Christiansen, 2007). In men, SS was\nadditionally associated with poor educational achievement\n(Magnusson, Rasmussen, & Gyllensten, 2006) and higher\nrisk of suicide (Magnusson, Rasmussen, Lawlor, Tynelius, &\nGunnell, 2006). Other studies have concluded that height has\nnegligible effect on health-related quality of life (Busschbach,\nRikken, Grobbee, De Charro, & Wit, 1997; Coste, Pouchot,\n& Carel, 2012). Some studies on SS children did not find\nthem significantly less well psychologically adjusted than\ntheir taller counterparts (Downie, Mulligan, Stratford, Betts,\nMultiple factors may have contributed to this contradic-\ntion. Samples were drawn from different cultures, where\nsocietal attitudes to SS may differ; samples comprised differ-\nent age brackets; and different measurements were used to\nassess people's psychological adjustment and quality of life.\nPerhaps most important, the researchers framed their ques-\ntion differently.\nSome put the emphasis on whether SS may compromise\npeople's competitiveness, as in the mentioned studies dem-\nonstrating the link between SS and lower academic achieve-\nments and perceived social status (Magnusson, Rasmussen,\n& Gyllensten, 2006; Magnusson, Rasmussen, Lawlor, et al.,\n2006). Others emphasized the question of whether SS\ndirectly affected functioning of short people. These research-\ners, for example (Coste et al., 2012), mostly focused on\nmeticulously controlling for confounding variables such as\nsocioeconomic status, parental education, health problems,\nand so on. After controlling for those variables, they found\nonly \"negligible\" effects of SS, suggesting that these effects\nare largely mediated by other, likely social, factors.\nStudies of stature's effects on health and psychological\nadjustment did not specifically address the possible\n1Naval Hospital Camp Pendleton, CA, USA\n2McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, Quebec, Canada\nCorresponding Author:\nValery Krupnik, Department of Mental Health, Naval Hospital Camp\nPendleton, Santa Margarita Road, Camp Pendleton, CA 92025, USA.\nEmail: valery.krupnik.ctr@med.navy.mil\nSize Matters Stature Is Related to\nDiagnoses of Depression in Young Military\nMen\nValery Krupnik1 and Mariya V.

Men's height correlates positively with their\nattractiveness to women and mating success (Pawlowski,\nmen's height is not linearly related to female mating prefer-\nences but has a U-shaped relationship, where both ends of\nthe distribution show lower values than the above-average\nmiddle, although the short end is still inferior to the tall one\n(Hensley, 1994). As the authors of another study stated,\n\"shortness is more of a liability than tallness is an asset\";\nthey also demonstrated TS's association with perception of\nconcept of masculinity is regarded as both bodily and cultur-\nally embedded with a complex relationship between the two\nrealms, which has led to the notion of multiple masculinities\nand hegemonic masculinity as their overarching vector\nwhere stature is but one contributing factor.\nEven if the difference in psychological adjustment of\nshort people is largely explained by concomitant social vari-\nables, the causal relationship (or lack thereof) between them\nand SS still needs to be elucidated. Evolutionary theory sug-\ngests organism's inherited attributes, such as SS, as primary\ntargets of environmental pressure. In application to men, it\nwould mean that their SS as a marker of lower status would\nmake them more vulnerable and shape their response to\nsocial pressure.\nInvoluntary Subordination\nDefeat, social defeat in particular, has been identified as a\ncore psychological state in depression (Gilbert, 2006). It has\nbeen conceptualized as a loss of social rank in a direct con-\nflict or competition, which may result in depression-like\nsymptoms including behavioral and social withdrawal, and\nsubordinate behavior. Accordingly, depressive response has\nbeen conceptualized as an adaptation to defeat or involuntary\nSloman, Gardner, Gilbert, & Rohde, 1994). Submission can\nbe adaptive, as it may help avoid a potentially lethal or dam-\naging confrontation, thus increasing the fitness of the\nsubordinate.\nAn animal model of depression based on social defeat\nwas established a long time ago (Kudryavtseva,\nBakshtanovskaya, & Koryakina, 1991). In its current form, it\nconsists of repeated forced exposure of individual mice to\nlarger and more aggressive ones. Such exposure produces a\ndepressive-like phenotype. Importantly, this phenotype can\nbe reversed by chronic but not acute administration of a\nselective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant,\nwhich supports the model's validity (Golden, Covington,\nIn humans, as in other animals, subordinate social status\nis associated with high chronic stress, depressive reactions,\nand poorer health (Sapolsky, 2004). Moreover, perceived\nsocial rank was found in closer association with health indi-\ncators than actual one (Adler, Epel, Castellazzo, & Ickovics,\n2000). In humans, much of the research on social defeat has\nbeen conducted in the bully/victim paradigm that is believed\nto parallel the dominant versus subordinate model in other\nanimals (Bj\u00f6rkqvist, 2001). Victims, like subordinate ani-\nmals, have been shown to suffer from chronic stress and\ndepressive symptoms (Bj\u00f6rkqvist, 2001). However, bullies\nhave also been found to be at a greater risk of depression\ncompared with general population (Kaltiala-Heino, Rimpel\u00e4,\nAdolescence is an age when social standing among peers\nassumes high importance. In a study of a sample of adoles-\ncent boys in an all-boys school, their status in peer hierarchy\ncorrelated positively with self-esteem and negatively with\ntheir rate of depression (Fournier, 2009). Subjective social\nstatus has been shown to negatively correlate with depres-\nsive symptoms in a large sample of adolescents (Goodman et\nBody size is likely an important contributor to social sta-\ntus, although it is but one of many contributing factors such\nas aggression, age, affiliations, social history, and so on (see\nChase, Tovey, Spangler-Martin, & Manfredonia, 2002, for\nreview). In adult humans of the industrialized world, height\nis a readily observable, easily measurable variable that is\nconstant and independent of psychosocial factors. As men-\ntioned above, it affects psychological adjustment and quality\nof life, with SS being perceived as a marker of low status.\nHypothesis\nOur hypothesis stems from two independent evolutionary-\nbased premises reviewed above: (a) that depressive symp-\ntoms evolved as an adaptive response to defeat, social defeat\nin particular; (b) that in men, height is a marker of masculin-\nity, perceived mating value, and status. We hypothesized that\nin young men SS led to higher prevalence of depressive\nsymptoms but not necessarily other common mental health\nsymptoms such as anxiety.\nIdiopathic SS is an out-of-group phenomenon usually\ndefined as 2 standard deviations (SD) below the mean height\nof the reference population, one that matches in sex and age\n(Ranke, 1996). In order for SS to serve as a marker of status,\nan SS individual must be perceived as such among his peers,\nfor which a threshold of significant shortness should be\nreached. Therefore, correlation between height and preva-\nlence of depressive symptoms in men (if present) is also\nexpected to be an out-of-group phenomenon, that is, no sig-\nnificant correlation is expected within the group. Once some-\none is perceived short statured, he is already stigmatized, and\nit matters relatively little how short he is within the SS group.\nThe same is expected for the \"normal\" stature group. Then\nthe highest correlation between height and depressive symp-\ntoms may be expected at the group's margin. The height\nKrupnik and Cherkasova 3\npolymorphism in a given population is likely to affect the\nsensitivity of out-of-group perception and, consequently, the\nsensitivity of the hypothesized correlation. For example, a\nthreshold of 0.5 SD in a low polymorphism population may\nbe perceived as significant as 1 SD in a high polymorphism\none.\nAnother prediction from our hypothesis is that the effects\nof SS are more pronounced in settings of intense intramale\nsocial competition, especially where physique is considered\nimportant.\nIn line with the situation\u00adsymptom congruency hypothe-\nsis (Keller & Nesse, 2006), the association of depressive\nsymptoms with SS should be specific to some but not other\nsymptoms that are unlikely to have evolved as an adaptation\nto social defeat. For example, we do not expect SS to be\nassociated with increased anxiety because anxiety is not a\nuseful adaptation to social defeat.\nWe made a preliminary observation in a group of active\nduty military men who received mental health care. That was\na suitable model group as it consisted of young physically\nhealthy men in a competitive mostly male environment,\nwhere physical prowess was valued.\nMethod\nThe data were taken from records of a mental health clinic\nserving active duty military personnel. We randomly selected\na relatively homogeneous sample of 196 healthy (no major\ndiagnosis of somatic illness) males of Caucasian background.\nEthnic/racial groups may represent distinct reference popula-\ntions because their mean body heights differ. Caucasians\nconstituted a majority of the patients and were chosen as a\nsample for our analysis. As we were interested in depressive\nsymptoms, we chose patients carrying depression-related\ndiagnoses. Patients with anxiety-related diagnoses were\ntaken as a control group representing the most prevalent\ncluster of mental disorders (Kessler et al., 2005). The diagno-\nses were established as part of routine care by mental health\nproviders of the clinic (either psychiatrists or PhD-level psy-\nchologists, who were uninvolved in this project) according to\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th\ned.; DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association [APA],\n1994).The sample's demographics and diagnostic profile are\npresented in Table 1.\nTo capture the severity of our patients' condition along\neither depression or anxiety axis, we ranked their disorders\naccording to the diagnostic hierarchy reflected in DSM-\nIV/Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder\nseverity. Among depressive/depression-related disorders, the\nlowest in that hierarchy are the residual categories such as\nadjustment disorder with depressed mood and depression\n(not otherwise specified [NOS]) because these diagnoses are\nnot given when the criteria for specific depressive disorders\nare met. So we rated them lower than the specific diagnoses\nof dysthymia and major depression and assigned relative val-\nues as follows: adjustment disorder with depressed mood--\n1, depression NOS--1, dysthymic disorder--2, major\ndepressive disorder--2. We assigned relative values to anxi-\nety-related disorders following the same logic: adjustment\ndisorder with anxiety--1, anxiety NOS--1, generalized anx-\niety and panic, disorders--2. When an individual carried\nmore than one diagnosis, he was assigned the highest value\nalong both axes, for example, someone with depression NOS\nand major depressive disorders would be rated at 2, likewise,\na patient with anxiety disorder NOS and panic disorder\nwould be rated at 2.\nThe mean height was 178.7 cm (SD = 7), which is close to\nthat of Caucasian males in the United States (Centers for\nranks in our sample were rated follows: privates--Category\n1, lance corporals--Category 2, corporals--Category 3,\nTable 1.

In addition, we performed a confirmatory analysis,\nwhere depression and anxiety diagnoses were used as yes/no\ndichotomous variables.\nResults\nAone-wayANOVAcomparing the three groups (SS,AS, and\nTS) on depression severity revealed a significant effect of\nDifference pairwise comparisons showed that both short\nindividuals and tall individuals had significantly higher prev-\nalence of depression diagnoses than AS individuals, short\nfrom each other (Figure 1). Because the distribution of\ndepression severity scores deviated from normality, we con-\nfirmed the significance of these findings with nonparametric\ntests. The Mann\u00adWhitney U test confirmed that both SS and\nTS individuals had significantly higher depression scores\nthan AS individuals (SS: p = .02; TS: p = .04).\nA one-way ANOVA comparing the three groups (SS, AS,\nand TS) on anxiety severity did not reveal a significant effect\nWe next explored potentially relevant demographic and\nexperiential covariates for inclusion into the primary analy-\nses of the relationship between height and diagnostic\nseverity. We found that number of combat deployments and\nmilitary rank both negatively correlated with depression\nlier demonstrated correlation between military rank and stat-\nure (Mazur, Mazur, & Keating, 1984). Marital status was\nage was not related to diagnoses. We therefore reanalyzed\nthe data considering these covariates. In our analysis of\ndepression, we did not consider the number of deployments\nas an appropriate covariate as the number of deployments\nwas negatively associated with depression severity, and we\nreasoned it more likely that poorer functioning and perfor-\nmance in more depressed individuals resulted in fewer\ndeployments, rather than more deployments improving\ndepression symptoms. If so, using the number of deploy-\nments as a covariate would eliminate important depression-\nrelated variance. Hence, we only considered military rank as\na covariate in the one-way ANCOVA comparing the three\ngroups (SS, AS, and TS) on depression severity. The analysis\nPost hoc least significant difference pairwise comparisons\nconfirmed that both short individuals and tall individuals had\nhigher prevalence of depression diagnoses than AS individu-\nals though the difference between short and average individ-\nuals was at trend level (short vs. average: p = .06; tall vs.\naverage p = .03). The ANCOVA comparing the three height\ngroups on anxiety severity with marital status as a covariate\nrevealed a significant effect of marital status, F(1, 192) =\n6.87; p = .009, but the effect of group was not significant,\nFinally, we examined whether the presence of any clini-\ncally significant depression or anxiety differed as a function\nof height group. The chi-square test revealed that there were\nmore depression diagnoses in the TS than AS individuals,\nmore depression diagnoses in SS than AS individuals,\nsignificant differences between the groups (ps > .13).\nThere was no statistically significant correlation between\nheight and symptoms prevalence in either the whole sample\nor within the groups (ps > .45).\nDiscussion\nWe present a preliminary analysis of diagnostic profiles of\nyoung male military personnel in relation to their height. We\nchose 1 SD cutoff for outlier SS and TS groups rather than\nthe commonly accepted for idiopathic SS 2 SD, because a\nlarger cutoff, for example, 1.5 SD, would have included only\neight short men and significantly undercut the statistical\npower. Besides, using the 2 SD cutoff would be impossible\nbecause those men could not be recruited to the military. The\nsample available to us was of a relatively small size and\nShort Average Tall\nHeight\nDepression Diagnoses + SE\n* *\nFigure 1. The levels of depression-related diagnoses in young\nmilitary men of short, tall, and average stature.\nKrupnik and Cherkasova 5\nafforded a limited scope of information; also, we had to rely\non diagnostic impression of clinicians rather than standard\nmeasures of anxiety and depression. Still, the findings vali-\ndate our initial suggestion that SS in men is associated with a\nhigher level of depression but not anxiety (Figure 1) and that\nthis is an out-of-group effect. Absolute body height was\nuncorrelated with the rates of depressive and anxiety diagno-\nses in our sample, and difference was only found, when outli-\ners were compared with the rest. This is in accord with our\nprediction that the perception of being SS rather than abso-\nlute height adversely affects men's psychological well-being.\nThe trend of SS servicemen showing higher levels of depres-\nsion remained after accounting for rank as a covariate\nalthough falling short of statistical significance (p = .06). The\nconnection between SS and lower rank has been demon-\nstrated before (Mazur et al., 1984), which confirms the gen-\neral notion of short men achieving lower social status.\nThe analysis has revealed additional tendencies beyond\nthe initial hypothesis. The most important among them is the\nfinding that TS servicemen show elevated levels of depres-\nsion, as SS do (Figure 1).\nWhich Size Matters?\nOur initial hypothesis made no stipulations about TS men.\nOn the surface, it may appear that while SS is a psychologi-\ncal vulnerability, being tall should provide protection and\nfoster psychological well-being, because tallness is a marker\nof status and competitiveness. The important question, how-\never, is how tall. The taller the better may not necessarily\nhold true. The available data on the effects of height on men's\nstatus and achievements show that inordinately TS carries no\nbenefits. Men's attractiveness, for example, was shown to\nhave a U-shaped relation to height with both tails of distribu-\ntion losing to the above-average middle (Hensley, 1994), and\nso was men's chance to be married (Manfredini, Breschi,\nEven if very tall men do not outcompete their counter-\nparts of average to above-average height, it still leaves the\nquestion of their higher vulnerability to depression open. The\nanswer to it has, by necessity, to be highly speculative at this\npoint. One possibility to consider is that vulnerability of tall\nmen may lie in their very strength. Perceived as highly domi-\nnant by others and themselves, these individuals may hold\noverinflated expectations of their performance and success,\nwhich may make them more vulnerable to instances of\ndefeat, when they happen. That may elicit depressive\nresponse in very tall men with a higher frequency compared\nwith men of AS.\nIt is also conceivable that marginalization itself is a\ndepressogenic factor, regardless of the stature's value. There\nis a large literature on vulnerability of marginalized groups to\nanxiety and depression (for a recent review, see Pieterse,\nTodd, Neville, & Carter, 2012). However, to our knowledge\nthere have been no reports indicating that marginalization\ncan have a differential effect on depression versus anxiety as\nin our case. We, therefore, favor a more nuanced explanation\nthat considers interaction of status and marginalization with\ndepressive and anxiety responses to them, as explicated\nbelow.\nDepressive Versus Anxiety Response\nThe relationship between anxiety and depression has been of\nconsiderable interest for a long time. The two are highly\ncomorbid, for example (Kessler, Nelson, McGonagle, & Liu,\n1996), and anxiety is listed as an associated feature of major\ndepression in DSM-5. Still, both depressive and anxiety\nsymptoms may present separately. Several models account\nfor interdependence and relative independence of anxiety\nand depression, including the descriptive dimensional model\ndeveloped by Watson and Clark (Clark & Watson, 1991;\nWatson, 2005) and Higgins's regulatory focus theory\nAccording to these models, there is a continuum of relation-\nship between anxiety and depressive symptoms from inverse\nto concomitant.\nRegulatory focus theory suggests that two autonomous\nbut interacting systems are responsible for development of\nanxiety and depressive symptoms. The prevention system is\nresponsible for negotiating threats, and its dysregulation may\nlead to anxiety symptoms, while the promotion system is\nresponsible for meeting the organism's needs, and its inhibi-\ntion may lead to depressive symptoms. It is also hypothe-\nsized that the promotion and prevention systems are mutually\ninhibitory, which explains the high comorbidity of anxiety\nand depression--as the promotion system is downregulated,\nleading to depression, the prevention one is activated result-\ning in increased anxiety and vice versa (Higgins, 1998). This\ntheory also implies a rather intuitive possibility that there are\ntwo main strategies to respond to adversity: anxiety and\ndepressive responses that may to a certain extent be either\nmutually exclusive or complementary. This may account for\ninstances of both separate and comorbid anxiety and depres-\nsion. Depending on learned experience, genetic makeup, and\ncost\u00adbenefit analysis of a particular circumstance, individu-\nals may rely more either on depressive or anxiety strategy.\nFrom the premise that depressive symptoms evolved as a\nresponse to insurmountable adversity, lack of concomitant\nanxiety symptoms makes sense as responding with anxiety\nto a situation that can neither be avoided nor corrected would\nbe maladaptive. In this sense, depressive response may be\nconsidered a defense against anxiety. Indeed, it has been sug-\ngested that depression evolved as a defense or a shutdown\nmechanism against separation distress in mammal infants\n(Watt & Panksepp, 2009). That view is in an apparent contra-\ndiction with the regulatory focus theory because it proposes\nthat inhibition of the motivation (promotion) system leads to\nshutdown of separation distress, which can only be achieved\nby inhibiting the separation anxiety.\n6 SAGE Open\nThis contradiction can be reconciled by looking at the\ninteraction of depressive and anxiety response from a\ndynamic perspective. It is possible that the initial stage of\ndepression does indeed release anxiety, whereas at a later\nstage, as the depressive response matures it leads to inhibi-\ntion of anxiety, resulting in transition from the \"protest\" to\n\"despair\" phase (Bowlby, 1980). These considerations await\na more precise knowledge about the mechanisms involved in\nthe interaction of the circuitries involved in depressive and\nanxiety responses.\nThe idea that depressive response may protect from exces-\nsive anxiety is also noteworthy because it may reconcile the\nbiggest challenge for evolutionary theories of depression,\nnamely, its recurrent nature. It has been observed that a\ndepressive episode increases the probability of consecutive\nepisodes (Solomon et al., 2000), which can hardly be consid-\nered adaptive and has been a major critique of regarding\ndepression as an adaptation (Nettle, 2004). Yet, if depressive\nresponse can indeed protect from anxiety, once learned it is\nlikely to be facilitated in the following encounters with\nadversity. In an environment with more repetitive and, there-\nfore, highly predictable threats, such strategy can be adaptive\nbecause it would shorten or eliminate the initial counterpro-\nductive \"protest\" phase.\nIn our sample, SS and TS men had higher rates of depres-\nsive but not anxiety diagnoses compared with AS men\n(Figure 1). This finding has led to a post hoc extension of our\nhypothesis to suggest that SS and TS men adapt to their mar-\nginal status by engaging the depressive response and disen-\ngaging anxiety because marginalization by stature cannot be\nundone.\nThe psychology of SS has not yet been thoroughly stud-\nied. It is still an open question what personality traits and\ncognitive styles might mediate the effect of SS on vulnerabil-\nity to depression. Our model may be a doorway to addressing\nthis question, as it suggests that SS (and maybe TS) may bias\nmale development toward more depressive than anxiety\nresponse to stress.\nPathological Depression Versus Adaptive\nDepressive Response\nThere is currently no unitary theoretical framework for\ndepression, even though a variety of risk factors and mecha-\nnisms have been identified ranging from biological to psy-\nchological to social (Bogdan, Nikolova, & Pizzagalli, 2012).\nRather than addressing the mechanisms of depression, evolu-\ntionary theory seeks an explanation of the origin and purpose\nof the depressive process as a systemic response to environ-\nmental pressure, thus going beyond the mechanistic question\n\"how\" to tackle the teleological \"why.\" A number of evolu-\ntionary theories of depression have been proposed and peri-\n& Panksepp, 2009). All evolutionary theories converge on\nthe idea that depressive reaction has evolved as an adaptive\nresponse to insurmountable adversity, where behavioral and\nhedonic withdrawal is the main adaptive strategy achieved\nby downregulation of the motivation/reward system.\nEvolutionary theory may provide useful guidance for psy-\nchotherapeutic intervention because it considers depressive\nresponse an adaptation and, accordingly, focuses on the strat-\negies distressed organisms use to adapt to adversities and on\nthose strategies' effectiveness and weakness. This view is\ncompatible with the main goals of therapeutic encounter,\nwhere better emotional, behavioral, and cognitive responses\nto the patient's predicament are sought. Indeed, a recently\ndeveloped therapy for depression is based on evolutionary\ntheory and aims at facilitating adaptive depressive response\nFrom the epidemiological standpoint, evolutionary theory\ndoes not offer a clear prediction regarding the rates of depres-\nsion in populations with chronically elevated stress, as mar-\nginalized groups are believed to be. On one hand, such\ngroups are expected to manifest higher frequency of depres-\nsive symptoms, if we consider those symptoms adaptive\nreactions to stress. On the other hand, we might not expect a\nhigher rate of debilitating depression than in the general pop-\nulation, as these individuals may develop greater resilience,\nand low intensity depressive response may provide sufficient\nprotection. Indeed, it has been argued that although short\npeople experience psychosocial pressure related to their SS,\nthey are able to use their resilience mechanisms to compen-\nsate for this disadvantage (Sandberg & Colsman, 2005;\nSandberg & Voss, 2002). Epidemiological studies comparing\nSS people with the general population commonly use health-\nrelated quality-of-life questionnaires that include questions\nabout symptoms of anxiety and depression (Coste et al.,\n2012). Although these questionnaires quantify people's per-\nception of their general mental health as affected by \"stress,\ndepression, and problems with emotions,\" they do not iden-\ntify the presence of clinically significant syndromes such as\ndepressive, anxiety, or stress-related disorders. It is assumed\nthat all symptoms on the continuum of severity indicate psy-\nchological deficit or poor adjustment.\nThis raises two related questions. If symptoms of depres-\nsion are a manifestation of an adaptive depressive response,\nis there a level of severity, where such response becomes\nmaladaptive? If indeed there is a threshold, where adaptive\ndepressive response turns maladaptive, does it correspond to\nthe symptoms severity constituting a syndrome diagnosed as\nclinical (major) depression?\nRegarding the first question, there are two main groups of\nevolutionary theories, whose opinions differ. Some argue\nthat only depressive symptoms/traits are an adaptation, while\ndepression as an illness is maladaptive--the \"soft\" theory\nHasey, 2003), whereas others maintain that depression as an\nillness is adaptive too--the \"hard\" theory (Hagen, 1999;\nthe second question, some psychiatrists believe that up to a\nKrupnik and Cherkasova 7\ncertain threshold depressive symptoms do not constitute\npathology and that the current classification of depressive\ndisorders is too inclusive, which has led to overdiagnosing of\nIndeed, in DSM-5, the diagnosis of major depression includes\nfour levels of severity, and there are several additional diag-\nnoses of depressive disorders.\nThe premise that up to a certain degree of severity depres-\nsive symptoms do not represent a deficit or pathology but are\na manifestation of adaptive response to stress could reconcile\nthe controversy about the effect of SS on mental health. Both\nsides may be correct in their assertions: SS people may expe-\nrience higher stress and manifest more depressive symptoms\nbut not necessarily suffer from higher rates of clinical/major\ndepression. The available data lack the diagnostic specificity\nneeded to make such conclusion.\nEnd of the Controversy?\nWe believe that controversy about the effects of SS is partly\ndue to (a) pathologizing the issue and (b) insufficient speci-\nficity in asking the questions about SS. As has been persua-\nsively argued by the opponents of the use of growth hormone\ntherapy for enhancement purposes, idiopathic SS is not an\nillness (Sandberg & Colsman, 2005). Whereas it is true that\ntall men have a significant and consistent advantage over\nshort ones (Nettle, 2002), it appears no more of a health issue\nthan the advantage attractive people have over less attractive\nones. Then it becomes a personal choice whether and how to\ncompensate for it.\nIt appears rather obvious that a general question whether\nsize matters has been answered positively. However, it is also\nclear that it matters, where it matters. We believe that contra-\ndicting findings about the effects of SS resulted in part from\nthe lack of agreed on specific target groups and that future\nresearch should address this possibility. According to our\nhypothesis, the effects of SS should be greatest in groups\nwith intense intramale social competition, especially where\nphysical prowess and appearance count. Our sample of\nyoung military men is but one example. Another prediction\nof our hypothesis was that men would be more affected by\nSS than women as height had presumably less importance\nfor female social status. Indeed, mental health of men but not\nwomen was found to be affected by SS (Coste et al., 2012).\nIn a recent large epidemiological study, the authors have\nshown that after controlling for a significant number of vari-\nables affecting life quality, such as health, socioeconomic\nstatus, and life circumstances, SS still has a significant nega-\ntive effect on the sense of well-being in young men (Carrieri\n& De Paola, 2012). They have also shown that most impor-\ntant is the perceived stature, that is, body height relative to\nthe reference group, which confirms the notion of stature as\na marker of social status in young men. The importance of\nperceived stature has been recently demonstrated in an ele-\ngant experiment, where the perceived stature of the\nparticipants was manipulated with a virtual reality device\nShould future research confirm our hypothesis that SS in\nmen increases their vulnerability to depression, it will have a\nstraightforward practical application. To our knowledge,\nthere are no preventive programs specifically targeting\nshorter boys. We believe that such programs implemented in\nschool could be beneficial for them in developing higher\nresilience to the pressure of low social status based on body\nheight.
