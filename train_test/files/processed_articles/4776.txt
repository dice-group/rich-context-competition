The children were individually administered the Figure-Copying, Raven's Progressive Matrices,\nMatching Familiar Figure Task, Serial Recall, Digit-Span, Wechsler's Intelligence Scale for Children, Block Design, Cloze\nReading Comprehension, and Oral Reading tasks. Classroom Achievement scores on different subjects and the teachers'\nratings about their students were also taken. Results revealed that children reading in English medium schools outperformed\ntheir Oriya medium counterparts in some cognitive measures such as Figure Copying, MFFT, RPM, and Digit-Span tasks\nirrespective of levels. However, the children studying in Oriya medium schools scored higher in Reading Comprehension\ntask and commit less error compared with their English medium counterparts. However, in case of academic achievement\nmeasures at primary level, the Oriya medium children performed better in social science, whereas the English medium\nstudents excelled in first language and mathematics. The teachers of Oriya medium schools also rated their children better\nin general conduct, motivation, and effort in schoolwork, whereas, at the secondary level, there was no difference between\nthese two groups in academic achievement or teacher perception measures.\n",

This has been reiterated in the\n\"Programme of Action\" (POA, 1992), which is based on the\nNational Policy on Education (Department of Education,\nMinistry of Human Resources and Development,\nGovernment of India, 1986), as mentioned in a government\nresolution (Curzon cited in Evans, 2002) inspired by Viceroy\nLord Curzon's statement way back in 1904:\nAs a general rule the child should not be allowed to learn English\nas a language (i.e., as a subject) until he has made some progress\nin the primary stage of instruction and has received a thorough\ngrounding in his mother-tongue. It is equally important that\nwhen the teaching of English has begun, it should not be\nprematurely employed as the medium of instruction in other\nThe National Curriculum Framework (NCF; 2005) devel-\noped by the National Council of Educational Research and\nTraining (NCERT) also strongly supports the use of mother\ntongue at the primary stage in addition to promoting multi-\nlingualism in the classroom. However, this decision has not\nbeen implemented in practice. Rather, the medium of instruc-\ntion in mother tongue at the primary stage has remained a\ndesirable component in school curricula.\nThis right (of instructional style/medium) remains com-\npletely with the state governments to decide the languages to\nbe used as mediums of instruction or as the subject at the pri-\nmary stage. In fact, in our government education system, there\nis no national-level policy on language for education.

In addition to state\nofficial languages, most states have schools with other medi-\nums of instructions too. Subsequently, to address the various\ndemands of regional identity, retaining Hindi as a national link\nlanguage and to provide a place for English as the language of\nprogress and power, the \"three language formula\" was evolved\nand implemented in 1968, but during the last two to three\ndecades, the demand for English medium schools has gradu-\nally been increasing. In the present day society, the importance\nof mother tongue as a medium of instruction is gradually\ndecreasing, and the importance of English is gaining ground.\nThe English language, which is considered the second lan-\nguage for most of us, has now become a part of India's multi-\nlingual culture. In 1981, Pattanayak stated that in India,\n\"English is naturalized in certain of its uses, home-grown in\nthe midst of a multitude of languages, and complementary to a\nhost of languages in the daily routine, and at the most, operates\nas an important auxiliary\".\nHowever, the role of using mother tongue as medium of\ninstruction, particularly for linguistic minorities, has been\nemphasized by various studies (e.g., Cummins, 1984;\nSkutnabb-Kangas, 1984). Even, for an effective educational\ndevelopment of a second culture language of the majority\n(national language), studies have pleaded for the necessity of\npromoting the learners' proficiency in their mother tongue;\nfor example, Muyangwa and Mvakade (1998) found that the\npupils taught in mother tongue (Xhosa) performed better in\ntheir academic achievement than those taught in English.\nRamasamy (2001) says that the balance is in favor of mother\ntongue, especially for the lower socio-economic group.\nHowever, parents prefer English as medium of instruction\nfor the career option of their children. This is also a fact that\nchildren who study through their mother tongue get little\nscope at the national level administrative posts and other\nnational/international jobs. Thus, in a multilingual country\nlike India, one cannot afford to remain monolingual in one's\nmother tongue only. One has to learn several languages for\neconomic and social mobility. Hence, bilingual education is\nemphasized. Studies have also shown that bilingual educa-\ntion promotes cognitive growth, and convergent and diver-\ngent thinking, and helps academic performance (e.g.,\ngested that bilingualism involves an intense degree of cogni-\ntive conflict, which facilitates language learning. Nanda\n(1991) reports that medium of instruction is crucial for both\nsocial and personality development of children. In a com-\nparison of Oriya (mother tongue) and English (second lan-\nguage) medium high school children, he found that English\nmedium school children were better in general cognitive and\nsocio- motivational competencies. The Oriya medium school\nchildren were better in personal motivated competence, per-\nsonality, and personal style. However, in another study in\nHong Kong high schools, Marsh, Hau, and Kong (2000)\ncompared the achievements of high school students studying\nin Chinese (first language) and English (second language)\nmedium of instructions and found the negative effects of\nEnglish instruction in the achievement of most of the school\nsubjects, that is, history, geography, math, science.\nThe above review of empirical findings on the medium of\ninstruction influencing the cognitive processing, reading,\nand academic achievements of children have shown mixed\nand contradictory results. The impact of mother tongue as\nmedium of instruction vis-\u00e0-vis the use of non-mother\ntongue, particularly English as medium of instruction, has\nnot only created a wide spread debate but also baffled the\npolicy makers all over the country. As a result, there is no\nuniform standard prescribed for primary and secondary level\neducation in this country. While all the state governments of\nIndia are running traditional schools with mother tongue as\nmedium of instruction at primary and secondary levels, the\ncentral government (through Central Board of Secondary\nExamination [CBSE]) and many private organizations\n(through Indian Certificate for School Education [ICSE]) are\nrunning schools in English medium both at the primary and\nsecondary levels. There is a growing trend and craze in the\nIndian society not only in the urban but also in the semi-\nurban and urban-slum areas to opt for the English medium\nschools. Moreover, not many studies have been conducted in\nthis context to compare the performance and achievement\ndifferences of students studying in different schooling sys-\ntems/patterns. These reasons have prompted the present\nresearchers to take up this study and compare the perfor-\nmance characteristics of Oriya and English medium school\nchildren in Odisha. Due to the constraints of manpower,\ntime, and other resources, this study has been delimited to\nthe Cuttack city in Odisha, India.\nObjectives\n1. To examine the performance characteristics and dif-\nferences between English and Oriya medium school\nchildren on various cognitive processing and reading\nmeasures (both at primary and secondary levels of\neducation).\n2. To assess the achievement behavior patterns of\nEnglish and Oriya medium school children in various\nacademic/school subjects.\n3. To find out the grade differences (if any) among these\nchildren.\nMethod\nSubjects\nTwo Hundred forty-three schoolchildren were selected from\nthree different schools of the Cuttack city in Odisha, India:\n1. Ravenshaw Collegiate School (Oriya medium\ninstruction), which follows the traditional state\nMohanty and Das 3\nexamination pattern and is managed by the Education\nMinistry, Government of Odisha, India.\n2. Kendriya Vidyalaya (English medium instruction),\nCuttack, which follows the CBSE pattern. This\nschool is under the Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan,\nmanaged by the Ministry of Human Resources\nDevelopment, Government of India.\n3. Stewart School Cuttack (English medium instruc-\ntion), an English medium missionary school follow-\ning the ICSE pattern of examination.\nThe Grades IV and VII children from all these three\nschools were selected through stratified random technique.\ndrawn from each grade. In total, 120 students from Grade IV\nGrade IV; 63 girls and 60 boys from Grade VII) were selected\nas the sample. All these three schools had co-education pat-\ntern, similar infrastructure, teacher\u00adstudent ratio, and duly\nqualified/trained teachers. With regard to the demographic\ncharacteristics, the subjects were from service class/business\nclass background and middle-class/lower-middle-class fami-\nlies. But the parents were very much concerned about their\nchildren's education.\nDesign\nThe present study was quasi-experimental in nature having\ntwo independent variables such as medium of instruction and\ngrade, each having two levels (i.e., English and Oriya,\nGrades IV and VII) and 22 dependent measures.\nAssessment Instruments\nBroadly, four types of dependent measures were used to\nexamine the performance characteristics and differences\namong the children of Oriya and English medium schools.\nThe first category of measure represented the cognitive mea-\nsures, the second category included the reading measures,\nand the third and fourth categories of measures represented\nthe academic achievement scores and teachers' perceptions,\nrespectively.\nThe following measures were administered individually\non all the subjects.\nA. Cognitive Measures\nSimultaneous Information Processing Tests\n1. Figure Copying Task.\nThe tasks require the child to copy 15 geometrical figures,\nwhich are visible to the child at all times, and the difficulty\nlevel is increased gradually. Each drawing is scored 0, 1, or 2\naccording to the degree of correctness of reproduction.\nScoring criteria emphasize the maintenance of geometric\nrelation and proportions rather than exact reproduction. The\ntest was used as a good measure of simultaneous processing\nin children (Das, Naglieri, & Kirby, 1994). The maximum\nscore was 30 and the time taken by the child to complete\neach drawing was recorded, so that the mean of latency for\nFigure Copying could be computed.\n2. Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM).\nRPM (Raven, 1983) is a test of intellectual (non-verbal) rea-\nsoning for ability consisting of 60 matrices or designs, each\nhaving a part that has been removed. The task of the child is\nto decide the missing part and insert it from six/eight possi-\nble alternatives given below. The child has to simultaneously\nevaluate and search all the six/eight possible alternatives to\nfind out the correct portion. The 60 matrices are grouped into\nfive series, each comprising of 12 metrics having increasing\ndifficulty. The earlier series require accuracy of discrimina-\ntion while the letter series involves analogies, permutation,\nand alternation of the pattern and other logical relations. The\nfirst two series have six possible alternatives, and the rest\nthree series have eight possible alternatives. In this study,\nthis test was used as a good measure of simultaneous pro-\ncessing in children (Das et al., 1994). There was no time\nlimit for this test, and each subject took as much time as he\nor she required to complete the matrices.\nSuccessive Information Processing Tests\n1. Digit-Span (Forward) Task.\nThe test is similar to the Wechsler's Intelligence Scale for\nChildren\u00adRevised (WISC-R; Wechsler, 1974) Digit-Span\nforward subtest. The experimenter reads out the series of dig-\nits of increasing length, beginning with three digits, to a\nmaximum of nine digits. The child is required to recall a\nseries of digits, keeping the order of presentation intact. If a\nchild is unable to recall correctly any series of digits, he or\nshe should be given a second series of identical length. In the\npresent study, this task has been adopted as the successive\nprocessing measure (Das et al., 1994). The maximum score\nfor Digit-Span (forward) task was 84.\n2. Serial Recall Task.\nThe items of Serial Recall (similar to the WISC-R) were pre-\nsented individually (taking equal pause in each item) by\nmeans of a tape recorder. The subject's task was to recall a\nseries of words verbally keeping the order of presentation\nintact. Twelve sets of items, 4 items in each category (having\nthe word length of 4, 5, and 6), which were either acousti-\ncally similar (i.e., Amba, Ghara, Gacha, Nuga) or neutral\n(Jala, Pani, Ghasa, Chuli) were presented in the Oriya lan-\nguage/English language. The Oriya items were translated\ninto the English language for the English medium school\n4 SAGE Open\nchildren (1. Mango, House, Tree, Clothes; 2. Net, Water,\nGrass, Fire); each series of words were scored taking into\naccount their correct serial position as 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on.\nReflection\u00adImpulsivity Information Processing Test\n1. Matching Familiar Figure Task (MFFT).\nThe MFFT-20, which consists of 20 test items, was devel-\nable for use with children in primary and secondary grades.\nThis task was used in the present study. Each item consisted\nof a standard picture of a common object (e.g., a house) and\nsix comparison pictures, one of which was identical to the\nstandard picture; the other five differed from it in a minute\nand not easily identifiable detail. The task of the child was to\nselect the picture that exactly matches the standard; a maxi-\nmum of five errors per item were allowed. Latency to first\nresponse on each of the items and total number of errors were\nrecorded on all the 20 items. For each individual child, the\nmean time (to first response) and total number of errors for\nall 20 items were calculated at the end. This task was used to\nassess the cognitive processing styles (reflective\u00adimpulsive)\nof the children.\n1. Block Design Task.\nThe test is used to measure basic potentiality of a child in\nterms of how the cognitive ability is utilized/organized for\nsuccessful performance in complex problem solving tasks.\nWISC-R consists of 12 tests (6 on the verbal scale and 6 on\nthe performance scale) that constituted the Wechsler\nIntelligence Scale for Children (WISC, 1949). In the present\nstudy, the non-verbal performance subtest, Block Design,\nwas taken as a (non-verbal) reasoning task. In this task, there\nwere nine blocks (cubes) colored red on two sides, white on\ntwo sides, and (diagonally) partially red-/white on two sides.\nEleven cards with different designs (bound into a booklet)\nwere there, and the subject's task was to make identical\ndesigns by using these blocks. There was a maximum time\nlimit for each design, and extra bonus points were also given\nfor completing each item before the maximum time limit.\nReading Tests/Tasks\n1. Oral Reading Task.\nIn the present study, the oral reading task consisted of few\nsentences/a passage from the literature text books (Oriya/\nEnglish) of respective grades such as IV/VII. Each subject\nwas instructed to read these sentences aloud. The errors\nmade by the subjects were categorized as (a) number of\nincorrect words, (b) number of words added, (c) number of\nwords omitted, and (d) number of words mispronounced.\nTime taken and number of errors made in each category were\nrecorded for analysis.\n2. CLOZE Reading Comprehension.\nThis is a CLOZE reading task for measuring the pupils'com-\nprehension skill. CLOZE procedure is a technique in which\nwords are systematically deleted from a passage and the\nreader is expected to replace the deleted words while reading\nit. Stories were taken from the text books of Class IV and VII\nin case of both English and Oriya medium schools. Every\n8th, 9th, or 10th word was deleted so as not to destroy the\nconceptual base of the story. The deletions were made care-\nfully without hampering the contextual cues. For absolute\ncorrect answer (semantically or syntactically), a score of 1\nwas given, and for unacceptable response/complete failure,\nno score was given; 1/2 mark was given for partially correct\nresponses.\nB. Achievement Measures\nThe achievement scores were collected from the half-yearly\nexamination reports of the schools in the following subjects:\nmedium of instruction language (MIL) Oriya/English, math-\nematics, science, social science as well as Grand total. The\nscores on the above Classroom Achievement Measures gave\nthe idea of children's knowledge in language, reasoning abil-\nity, and general information storage.\nC. Teacher Rating Measure\nThe class teachers of Grades IV and VII were asked to fill in\nthe Kendall and Wilcox's (1979) Self-Control Rating Scale\nof child. This rating scale consists of 40 questions in which\nthe class teacher had to assess (on a 7-point rating scale) the\nchild's general conduct, self-control, behavior, motivation,\nand effort in schoolwork.\nProcedure\nAll the assessment instruments were individually adminis-\ntered on the sample by the researcher in their respective\nschools. Because there were several tests and tasks, which\nrequired long hours of testing, the tests were administered in\ntwo separate sessions. The achievement scores were col-\nlected from the half-yearly examination records of all the\nschools. The Teacher Rating scores of the subjects were\ngiven by the respective class teachers.\nResults\nOut of total 16 cognitive variables, 8 variables showed statis-\ntically significant effect for Grade IV Oriya and English\nmedium students (refer Tables 1 and 2). The English medium\nstudents took less time to complete the Figure Copying task\nMohanty and Das 5\nand got more scores than their Oriya medium counterparts.\nThey also committed less error in the MFFT task and scored\nmore in the Digit-Span than their Oriya medium counter-\nparts. However, in the Serial Recall task, the Oriya medium\nstudents scored higher than the English medium children.\nThe Oriya medium students' reading comprehension scores\nwere higher, and they read less number of incorrect words,\ncompared to their English medium counterparts. However,\nthe Oriya medium primary grade children omitted more\nnumber of words in the reading passage than their English\nmedium counterparts.\nOf the five Academic Achievement variables, three\nshowed statistically significant effect for Grade IV Oriya and\nEnglish medium students (MIL, mathematics, social sci-\nence). The English medium students scored better in MIL/\nfirst language and mathematics whereas the Oriya medium\nstudents scored higher in social science. The teacher percep-\ntion variables (general conduct, self-control, behavior, moti-\nvation, and effort in their studies) showed statistically\nsignificant effect, and the Oriya medium students were rated\nhigher by their class teachers as compared with English\nmedium children.\nOf the 16 cognitive variables, 8 variables showed statisti-\ncally significant effect for Grade VII Oriya and English\nmedium students (refer Tables 3 and 4 here). The English\nmedium students took less time to complete the Figure\nCopying, RPM, and MFFT tasks and scored better in Figure\nCopying and Digit-Span tasks than their Oriya medium coun-\nterparts. The English medium students scored less in\nComprehension task and took less time to read the reading\npassage but read more number of incorrect words than their\nOriya medium counterparts. Of the 5 Academic Achievement\nvariables, all showed statistically insignificant effect for Grade\nVII Oriya and English medium students. The teacher percep-\ntion variables were also found to be statistically insignificant.\nDiscussion and Conclusion\nIn the present study, in simultaneous processing measures\n(Figure Copying, RPM, MFFT, etc.), the primary grade\nTable 1.

RPM = Raven's Progressive Matrices; MFFT = Matching Familiar Figure Task; MIL = medium of instruction language.\nchildren of English medium schools took less time to complete\nthe tasks and scored higher in comparison with their Oriya\nmedium counterparts. The same trend was observed in case of\nsecondary grade. These findings support the earlier report by\nAnand (1973) that English medium pupils showed higher non-\nverbal intelligence than their Kannada medium counterparts.\nSrivastava and Ramaswamy (1986) also reported the same\n(while comparing the children of Tamil, Malayalam, and\nEnglish medium schools) and found that secondary grade chil-\ndren of English medium schools scored higher on non-verbal\nintelligence. More recently in cross-cultural context also,\nKirkici (2004) confirmed the view that bilingualism may act as\na facilitating trait in many respects, including the bilingual\nchild's cognitive and linguistic development.\nThe poor performance of students of Oriya medium\nschools in the above non-verbal tasks may be due to their\nnon-exposure to such tasks. This fact was confirmed by the\nchildren, that they were never exposed to such problem solv-\ning tasks, during the course of instruction in the school. From\nthe above findings, it is evident that the secondary level\nOriya medium children did not get the scope to improve their\nnon-verbal, problem solving skills, even after 3 more years\nof schooling. The present findings suggested that the\nsecondary grade children of English medium schools were\nprobably more impulsive and tried to solve the problems as\nquickly as possible. In contrast, the secondary grade Oriya\nmedium children were found to follow a reflective process-\ning strategy. However, this trend was not found in case of the\nprimary grade children. Probably, they had not developed an\nanalytical style of their own. It is also observed that the stu-\ndents of English medium schools were so much overbur-\ndened with their school tasks that they were less interested in\nperforming well in these problem solving tasks. Possibly,\nthis could be the reason why they had adopted an impulsive\nprocessing strategy while solving the non-verbal reasoning\nand simultaneous information processing tasks.\nThe successive processing tasks (Serial Recall and Digit-\nSpan) in this study involve the integration of stimuli into par-\nticular series, where the elements form a chain like\nprogression. The critical aspect of successive processing is\nthat elements must be ordered without surveyability, and ele-\nments should be linearly related. Verbal encoding and\nrehearsal are very much needed, which help in storing infor-\nmation in memory for successive processing. At the time of\nretrieval in successive processing tasks, the items have to be\nserially reproduced by the subjects. In the Serial Recall task,\nMohanty and Das 7\nthe primary grade children of Oriya medium schools scored\nsignificantly higher than their English medium counterparts,\nbut at the secondary level, there was no significant difference\nbetween them. From this finding, we could infer that may be,\nthe Oriya medium primary level children are more acquainted\nwith rote learning method, probably because the curriculum\nemphasizes this skill in the traditional Oriya medium schools.\nApart from this, the words in the Serial Recall task might\nhave had a familiar rhythm, which made it easy for them to\nrecall quickly. In the Digit-Span task, the primary grade chil-\ndren of English medium schools scored significantly higher\nthan their Oriya medium counterparts. The same trend was\nalso found at the secondary level. The secondary grade\nEnglish medium children scored higher than the Oriya\nmedium counterparts. The Digit-Span task is basically a\nmemory task. However, the immediate memory span of the\nstudents depend on their habit pattern. From this finding, it\nmay be inferred that the children of English medium schools\nare more acquainted to numerical pattern than the words used\nin these tasks. In African Language research also, Ndamba\n(2008) found that majority of parents as well as participants in\nhis study favored English as the language of instruction in the\nprimary grades, because English is a gateway to success in\nschools and subsequent employment opportunity. In the pres-\nent study, in WISC-R Block Design non-verbal reasoning\ntask, the children of English medium schools had higher\nmean scores compared with their Oriya medium counterparts,\nboth at the primary and secondary levels. In support of this, in\na study related to monolingualism, bilingualism, and medium\nof instruction, Sampath (2005) found that levels of second\n(Telugu and Tamil) language proficiency do not mediate\nglobal intelligence and non-verbal intelligence; rather, when\nchildren have a higher level of second language proficiency,\nthey perform better on verbal intelligence. The bilinguals pos-\nsess an interactive language system, such as when speech is\nperceived or produced in either language, the two language\ncapabilities influence each other, and a positive transfer takes\nplace when the second language learners utilize knowledge of\nsimilar elements from first language (L1) in learning second\nTable 3.

RPM = Raven's Progressive Matrices; MFFT = Matching Familiar Figure Task; MIL = medium of instruction language.\n8 SAGE Open\nThe Reading Comprehension task demands a conceptual\nanalysis of semantic and syntactic cues to fill in the missing\ndetails. Researchers (Anderson, Hiebert, Scott, & Wilkinson,\n1985) have argued that good comprehension ability depends\non proper synthesis of the past information already available\nto the reader and the subject information available to him or\nher through the text. Moreover, involvement of the reader,\nsampling of words from the text, and awareness of the con-\ntext of reading situation lead to better comprehension of the\ntext (Richeck, List, & Lerner, 1989; Wixson, Peters, Weber,\n& Roeber, 1987). Here, in the Comprehension task, the Oriya\nmedium children of primary grades achieved statistically\nsignificant higher scores in comparison with their English\nmedium counterparts. The same trend was noticed at the sec-\nondary level. The secondary grade Oriya medium children\ntook slightly more time than the children of English medium\nschools to complete the comprehension task (although this\nmean difference was not statistically significant). In Oral\nReading task, the primary grade children of English medium\nschools read significantly more number of incorrect words\ncompared with their Oriya medium counterparts. However,\nthe primary grade Oriya medium children omitted signifi-\ncantly more number of words from the passage than their\nEnglish medium counterparts. The secondary grade children\nof English medium schools took significantly less time to\nread the passage but read significantly more number of incor-\nrect words compared to their Oriya medium counterparts.\nThe secondary grade Oriya medium children took more time\nto read the passage but made very few reading errors, prob-\nably because of their reflective processing strategies. From\nthis, we can assert that attention and cognitive processing\nstrategies are closely interlinked, even in case of oral read-\ning. Research has also shown that attention is a critical factor\nfor translating print into speech and plays a major role in\nincreasing the reading fluency (Radach, Kennedy, & Rayner,\nOf the five Achievement variables (MIL/first language,\nmathematics, science, social science, and global marks), the\nEnglish medium children of primary grades got higher grades\nin MIL/first language and mathematics compared to the\nOriya medium counterparts. In support of this, Srivastava\nand Khatoon (1980) also reported that English medium chil-\ndren got higher scores in first language compared with the\nKannada medium counterparts. The primary grade children\nof Oriya medium schools got significantly higher grades in\nsocial science compared with their English medium\nTable 4.

This finding may suggest that the Oriya\nmedium school children are more acquainted with rote learn-\ning at the primary level. However, these findings are contrary\nto the findings of Marsh et al. (2000) who reported that the\nprimary children of Chinese medium schools achieved\nhigher scores in mathematics, science, and social science as\ncompared with their English medium counterparts. Because\nthe classroomAcademicAchievement measures are not stan-\ndardized tools, the difference between the two mediums of\ninstruction might be due to subjectivity and difference in\nteacher perception variables. At the secondary level, there\nwas no significant difference in all the five achievement\nmeasures of the children of Oriya and English medium\nschools. These data are contrary to the findings reported pre-\nviously by Basavayya (1980) where it was reported that chil-\ndren of English medium schools are superior to their\ncounterparts in Kannada medium in academic achievement\nscores. Considerable evidence is also available regarding the\nfinding that executive attention network plays a major role in\nthe acquisition of school subjects such as literacy (Mc\nCandliss, Beck, Sandak, & Perfetti, 2003) and numeracy, and\nin a wide variety of other subjects (Posner & Rothbart, 2007).\nIn the teacher perception variable, the primary grade chil-\ndren of Oriya medium schools were rated significantly higher\nby their class teachers compared with their English medium\ncounterparts. The teachers of Oriya medium schools per-\nceived that their children exercised more self-control, had\nmore motivation to learn, and put in more efforts, and in gen-\neral, showed less behavior problems. However, the teachers\nof English medium schools rated their children to have less\nself-control, to be impulsive, and to have had more general\nconduct and behavior problems. It is generally found that the\nprimary level children of Oriya medium schools are more\ndisciplined and are afraid of their teachers. At the secondary\nlevel, the teacher perception variable scores were almost\nsimilar for the children of both Oriya and English medium\nschools.\nIn summary, the major findings of the present study reveal\nthat the students of the English medium schools at both the\nlevels (primary and secondary) were found to be superior in\nmost of the non-verbal cognitive processing tasks. This could\nbe attributed to the reason that the Oriya medium children\nmight not have received enough stimulation to improve their\nnon-verbal problem solving skills, even at the secondary\nlevel. Probably, they were not well-exposed to various prob-\nlem solving tasks, which require different information pro-\ncessing strategies to solve novel tasks. As a result, these\nchildren lacked potential skills and aptitude for solving prob-\nlems beyond their syllabus. Even their parents seem to be\nmore traditional and did not expose them to sufficient extra-\ncurricular activities other than the school curriculum.\nHowever, the children of English medium schools were\nfound to be more impatient and impulsive to get over a task,\nwhich is not related to their classroom academic achieve-\nment--especially at the secondary level. The general trend\nobserved (in case of parents and teachers) is that there is\nmore encouragement and reward for high classroom achieve-\nment among children rather than encouraging them for more\ncreative and innovative work beyond the prescribed curricu-\nlum. Thus, it is suggested that some reforms in the school\ncurriculum and general set-up of the school environment be\nmade in the traditional schools. The school curriculum must\ngive scope to children to develop creative and problem solv-\ning skills. The pedagogy of Oriya medium schools has to be\nchanged from rote learning method to constructive learning.\nThe teaching\u00adlearning process should emphasize activity-\ncentered learning and ensure the all-round development of\nchildren.\nIn the reading measures, the Oriya medium children at\nboth the levels have outperformed their English medium\ncounterparts. In this study, because the Oriya medium chil-\ndren are mostly monolinguals, they have a better control\nover the first language/mother tongue. This is also a well-\nresearched fact that children learn best in their mother tongue\nas a prelude to and complement of bilingual and multilingual\neducation (Ball, 2010). Fluency and literacy in the mother\ntongue lay a cognitive and linguistic foundation for learning\nadditional languages. Thus, when children receive formal\ninstruction in their first language throughout primary studies\nand then gradually shift to academic learning in the second\nlanguage, they learn the second language quickly. If they\ncontinue to have opportunities to develop their first language\nskills in secondary school, they emerge as fully bilingual/\nmultilingual learners. If, however they are forced to switch\nabruptly from their mother tongue to schooling in a second\nlanguage, their first language acquisition may be attenuated\nor even lost. This has also happened in the present study. For\nEnglish medium children, although English was their first\nlanguage in the school as well as medium of instruction,\nthese children were having either Oriya or Hindi as their\nmother tongue. They used to speak Oriya or Hindi at home,\nin the neighborhood, and with their peers/playmates.\nTherefore, it is very natural that these children performed\nless well in reading and comprehension tasks in comparison\nwith their Oriya medium counterparts. The probable reason\ncould be that the English medium children were less profi-\ncient in both the languages (mother tongue and school lan-\nguage) as they were using these as the substitute not\nsupplementary to each other. Moreover, it is also found that\nthe general attitude toward tasks other than the school tasks\nwas indifference, which resulted in lower level of verbal\nability. This aspect was more prominent at the secondary\nlevel when they rushed through the reading passage just to\nfinish the task and read on enormous number of incorrect\nwords. Instead of showing an improvement from primary\ngrades, they deteriorated further at the secondary level.\nIn academic achievement measures, at primary level, the\nEnglish medium students performed better in the English\nlanguage and mathematics, whereas the Oriya medium stu-\ndents performed better in social studies. However, at the\nsecondary level, there was no such significant difference.\nThese achievement tests were not standardized and could\nnot be accepted as error-proof. Many researchers have\nreported that bilingualism involves an intense degree of\ncognitive conflict, which facilitates language learning. It is\nalso revealed in the present study that the level of profi-\nciency and exposure matter a lot in determining the cogni-\ntive flexibility of children. In tune to this, the present\nresearchers also advocate for improving the language profi-\nciencies in both the first and second languages through\nmore supplementary reading materials, besides the courses\nin the curriculum, and adopting more innovative as well as\nproblem solving approaches in the teaching\u00adlearning pro-\ncess. The school curriculum should be designed to promote\nequally the children's non-verbal reasoning and higher\norder cognitive skills.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAnand, C.
