We estimated the\nassociation between media volume and mortality rates by time-lagged regression analyses. There were 24,272 articles and\n30,916 deaths involving prescription opioids during the seven-year study period. Nationally, the number of articles\nmentioning prescription opioids increased dramatically starting in early 2001, following prominent coverage about the\nnonmedical use of OxyContin.

Temporal\nAssociation between News Media Report Volume and\nOpioid-Related Mortality\n1 Department of Epidemiology, Gillings School of Global Public Health, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, Unites States of America, 2 Children's\nHospital Informatics Program at Harvard\u00adMassachusetts Institute of Technology, Division of Health Sciences and Technology, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of\nAmerica, 3 Division of Emergency Medicine, Children's Hospital Boston, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America, 4 Department of Pediatrics, Harvard Medical\nSchool, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America\n Introduction\nHistorical studies of news media have suggested a strong\nassociation between media reporting on psychoactive substances\nand a subsequent increase in their use and abuse. Period effects for\ndrug abuse have been documented for different classes of legal and\nillicit substances, with extensive research documenting the role\nthat media publicity may have played in their emergence,\nregression and public perception [1,2]: amphetamine [3] in the\nphetamine [3], methcathinone [5], RohypnolH [5], and ecstasy\nprescription opioids [15,16] in this decade.\nThe roles that news media may play in drawing awareness to\nnational drug problems has been the subject of scrutiny in\nsociology for decades. Many researchers have examined the\ncontent of news media coverage of psychoactive substance use. In\ntheir commentary on the role of media in shaping ideas about\nhealth Caburnay et al. (2003) point out that, ``news media are an\nimportant and influential part of the social environment, calling\nattention to certain issues by the amount and nature of their\ncoverage.'' [17] After reviewing decades of public opinion surveys\nregarding drug policy, Blendon and Young (1998) concluded that\nthe American public's views ``are largely shaped by the content\nand magnitude of media coverage on the issue.''[18] Despite these\nobservations and the extensive qualitative analysis of the manner\nin which drug use is covered by the media, there has been little\nattempt to quantify the relationship between media reporting and\ndrug use outcomes using epidemiologic techniques. Recent\nadvances in technology allow us to harness the electronic news\nsources to uncover the temporal relationship between media\nreporting and substance abuse indicators to lend support to\nqualitative analysis conducted by others about reporting on drug\nWhile availability and individual predispositions influence\ninitiation of substance use, elements of the social environment,\nincluding news reporting may enhance the popularity of\npsychoactive substances among potential nonmedical users and\nfoster demand. Even derogatory media reports may raise\nawareness and pique the curiosity of those inclined to experimen-\ntation. Some researchers have suggested that fear-based media\nmessaging may contribute to decreases in drug use [21], but the\ntemporal sequencing of drug problems and media reporting has\nnot been well documented. If news articles only reported on\nalready existing problems, and were a result and not a cause of\nadverse drug events, we would expect to first see an increase in\nsubstance abuse indicators, followed by an increase in the number\nof media reports mentioning the drugs. Alternatively, if media\nreports precede a substance abuse indicator, there may be a more\ncomplex relationship in which the media somehow influence drug\nabuse trends [2]. Here, we sought to quantify the temporal\nassociation between media reports and opioid-related mortality.\nMethods\nMortality Data\nWe generated a monthly time series of unintentional poisoning\ndeaths involving short-acting prescription opioid substances\n(including modified-release analgesics) in the US, from 1999 to\n2005. We used multiple cause-of-death data published by the\nNational Center for Health Statistics, accessed from the depository\nat the National Bureau of Economic Research. Unintentional\nprescription opioid poisoning deaths were identified using ICD-10\ncodes for poisonings of unintentional and undetermined intent\nmonth. Prescription opioid mortality data were used in this\nanalysis because they are the only publicly available data source\nrelated to drug abuse with monthly data and national coverage.\nWe limited the analysis to these years because more recent\nmortality data were not available at the start of the analysis, and\nprevious years used a different coding classification for mortality\nwhich could have introduced an additional source of bias. We\ncalculated population rates using mid-year Census estimates for\neach study year.\nNews Media Data\nMonthly counts of news articles mentioning generic and\nbranded names of prescription opioids were obtained from Google\nMedia reports were retrieved using automated Perl scripts with\nmanual verification [22]. Google News Archives provides access to\nEnglish language print news media from about 25,000 sources.\nMonth and year of publication and headlines were extracted for\nany article whose body text contained the generic or branded\nname of short-acting opioid substances available for outpatient use\nin the United States (from Food and Drug Administration's Orange\nBook): buprenorphine, codeine, fentanyl, hydrocodone, hydromorphone,\nmeperidine, propoxyphene, oxycodone, and tramadol. Morphine was\nexcluded because a preliminary review indicated articles mention-\ning morphine almost exclusively described pain management\n(without abuse) or arts reviews (e.g., the name of the band\nMorphine, storyline in the major motion picture La Vie en Rose).\nMorphine acted as a synecdoche for all opioid painrelievers used\nwithin a medical context. In order to establish a denominator to\ncalculate rates of news articles, we established counts of all print\nnews articles containing the word the in a given month.\nWe examined the subject material of articles which gave rise to\neach major peak in the time series of media reports by returning to\nthe original news outlets. We present data on one branded\n(OxyContin) and one generic (fentanyl) opioid to demonstrate the\ntypes of events which drive news media volume. Articles were read\nand assessed by multiple authors for each time point. An\nautomated text mining approach to classify articles was pilot\ntested, but is beyond the scope of this paper, and will be the subject\nof a future publication from our group. Results from manual\narticle classification were used to identify the subjects of articles\nrelated to peaks in news volume.\nStatistical Analysis\nWe computed time-lagged correlations between the mortality\ntime series and print news reports about short-acting opioid\nsubstances, compiled as described above. We used 5-month\nmoving averages to smooth each time series, and performed lag\nregression to estimate the association between media volume and\nmortality rates. We assessed the relative predictive value of the\ntime-lagged media data streams by fitting generalized linear\nmodels to mortality counts, assuming a Poisson distribution. We\nran separate models where the predictor was the media time series,\nshifted up to 6 months after or 6 months before mortality. Overall\nmodel fit for each of the Poisson regression models was calculated\nby comparing deviance statistics with their asymptotic chi-square.\nThe value of each lagged media series in predicting mortality was\ndetermined by calculating the proportion of the deviance\nexplained, similar to the R2. Statistical models were run using\nProc Genmod in SAS v9.1.2 (Cary, North Carolina).\nGiven the important geographic differences in opioid abuse in\nthe United States [23] we also examined the state-level distribution\nof opioid-related news. Because of its dominant impact on news\nvolume and recent concern [14,24], we chose to only search the\nword OxyContin in conjunction with a mention of one of the 50\nstate names or the District of Columbia in the headline, body text\nor media source name. The natural language processing methods\nused in this analysis have been detailed elsewhere [25]. For the\ndenominator, we found all articles for that year that contained the\nstate name. We repeated this analysis for each year from 2000 to\n2006 in order to calculate the state level proportions of news\ndevoted to OxyContin. Graphical display of time-series maps are\npresented.\nMortality data used in this study were publicly available and de-\nidentified, and the research was exempt from institutional review\nboard oversight.\nResults\nThere were 30,916 deaths involving short-acting prescription\nopioids during the seven year study period, including deaths from\nNews Media and Opioid Overdose\ntoxic exposure to extended-release formulations containing short-\nacting opioid substances. Monthly short-acting pharmaceutical\narticles mentioning prescription opioids among a total of\nOver time the most common articles were about individuals\narrested for drug selling possession (diversion) and those articles\nraising general concerns about prescription opioid abuse, depen-\ndence and poisoning, as has been noted by others [24]. Manual\nreview of stories about prescription opioids revealed that time\nseries peaks in article volume were related to celebrities using\ndrugs, federal government hearings, and pharmaceutical company\nactions (Figure 1), similar to what was documented for coverage on\ncocaine use during the mid-1980s [26]. Medical licensing decisions\ncensuring health care workers, pharmacy robberies and recovery\nfrom drug dependence less commonly contributed to peaks in\nnews volume, but were reported at consistent rates over time (data\nnot shown). Articles about prescription opioid overdoses tended to\nreport on arrests and criminal proceedings against those accused of\nbeing involved in providing the drugs to the decedents, including\ndoctors, drug dealers and family members. Overdose articles\ntended to focus on younger decedents, despite the average age for\nprescription opioid poisoning being in the late 30 s in the United\nStates during this time period [23]. Peaks were also generated due\nto spurious issues involving opioids, such as the use of fentanyl by\nRussian authorities to end a hostage situation in a Moscow theatre\nin October 2002 and illicitly-manufactured fentanyl-tainted heroin\nThe number of articles mentioning prescription opioids\nprominent national coverage about the nonmedical use of\nOxyContinH (Figure 2). We found news media to be a significant\neffects of seasonality and linear trending. We performed lagged-\nregression analysis to quantify a temporal relationship between\nmortality and new reporting (Figure 3). News reports preceded\npoisoning deaths with peak correlation at 2\u00ad6 months prior to\nmortality, accounting for 88% of the variability.\nWe found important differences in the geographic distribution\nof OxyContin-related news articles (Figure 4). Prior to 2001 when\nthe focus on articles about OxyContin was on pharmaceutical\nearnings and pain management, reporting was highest in New\nJersey, a state with a high concentration of pharmaceutical\nFigure 1. Monthly rates of news volume mentioning prescription opioids, 1998\u00ad2006, United States. Monthly print news volume\nmentioning prescription opioids was driven by different factors over time. Government and industry actions and celebrity involvement tended to\nproduce peaks in the time series. A general pattern was observed of regional reports of abuse problems followed by national coverage, for\nOxyContin. By comparison, fentanyl was reported on less frequently than OxyContin. Two peaks in fentanyl articles were due to issues not related to\npharmaceutical fentanyl formulations (weaponized gas and illicitly manufactured powder), suggesting the need for categorization of articles based\non content.

After 2003,\nreporting became more homogenous with substantial reporting\nthroughout the country. By 2006, New Jersey had the highest rates\nas articles about abuse- and tamper-resistant opioid pain reliever\nformulations became prominent. Similar cycles have of the media\nreporting on industry attempts to create less abuseable forms have\nbeen noted by others [4].\nDiscussion\nOur finding that articles about prescription opioids routinely\npreceded overdose deaths associated with the same medications\nsupports previous research, but we cannot draw a causal\nconclusion from our study alone, as other researchers have\npointed out [12]. In conjunction with the work of others\n[2,3,8,9,26], our findings support previous hypotheses about role\nof the news media in perpetuating public beliefs about psychoac-\ntive substance use, and the potential role the media may have in\ndrug use trends. We document that reporting on prescription\nopioids in the 2000s followed strikingly similar patterns as for\ndrugs in previous decades, and we provide a quantitative\nargument supporting the often-repeated demand for journalistic\nstandards for reporting on substance use issues.\nThe pattern of news media outlets reinforcing each other to\narrive at a general held belief has been noted for stories about\nThis phenomenon is termed intermedia convergence by Reese and\nDanielian (1989), and has been recently noted to be accelerated\nin the current more rapid and internet-influenced news cycle\n[28]. The early emergence of problems as reported by the news\nmedia about northern New England and Appalachia may in part\nexplain the sustained focus on these regions (see [29]), despite\nnational level data suggesting a broader ranging problem [30].\nIn a recent review of media portrayals of drug use, Talyor (2008)\ncites extensive sociological evidence to advance the theory that\nnews reports have focused on ``outsiders,'' socially marginalized\nclasses of people, often racial minorities, going as far back as the\nmid-1800s in the United States [see also: 19]. In this paper\nwe document that with prescription opioids in the current\ndecade, the outsiders appear to be rural residents, with a\nparticular focus on Appalachia and northern New England, as\nshown in Figure 4.\nWe posit that there may be co-linear relationships between the\nmedical use of a prescription opioid, medical consequence from the\nuse and abuse of the product, the public attention devoted to the\ntopic, and news media reports. Co-linearity does not prove\ncausation, however, and our intention in conducting this research\nis to advance the dialogue about the potential interconnectedness of\nthese seemingly independent phenomena. While news articles may\ncontribute indirectly to illicit demand for short-acting prescription\nopioids, there are many complex factors that influence poisoning\nmortality and are poorly understood: improper marketing, lax\nFigure 2. Opioid-related news media reports and poisoning\nvolume mentioning short-acting prescription opioid substances closely\ntracked closely with poisoning mortality due to those medications. Print\nnews media articles consistently preceded mortality by a few months.\nMonth and year of publication and headlines were extracted for any\narticle whose body text contained the generic or branded name of\nshort-acting opioid substances available for outpatient use in the\nUnited States during the study period: buprenorphine, codeine, fentanyl,\nhydrocodone, hydromorphone, meperidine, propoxyphene, oxycodone,\nand tramadol. Morphine was excluded because a preliminary review\nindicated articles mentioning morphine almost exclusively described\npain management (without abuse) or arts reviews. Poisoning deaths\nwere identified using a combination of International Classification of\nDisease 10th Edition (ICD-10) codes, see text, to identify deaths\ninvolving short-acting opioid substances. Data on methadone are not\npresented due to difficulties in distinguishing deaths from its two\nindications (addiction, pain) using ICD-10 codes, however inclusion of\nmethadone did not significantly alter results (data not shown). Time\nseries were smoothed using 5-month moving averages.\nFigure 3. Time delay between news reports and poisoning\nreports mentioning short-acting opioid substances consistently pre-\nceded poisoning mortality from those medications, with peak\ncorrelation at 5 to 6 months before mortality. In this cross-correlation\nanalysis we assessed the relative predictive value of the time-lagged\nmedia data streams by fitting generalized linear models to mortality\ncounts, assuming a Poisson distribution. We ran separate models where\nthe predictor was the media time series, shifted up to 6 months after or\n6 months before mortality. Overall model fit for each of the Poisson\nregression models was calculated by comparing deviance statistics with\ntheir asymptotic chi-square. The value of each lagged media series in\npredicting mortality was determined by calculating the proportion of\nthe deviance explained, similar to the R2. The greatest percent of\nvariation explained was highest in scenarios where the news media\npreceded mortality.\nNews Media and Opioid Overdose\nprescribing standards, patient and health care worker errors,\nbreaches of the pharmaceutical supply chain, the influence of social\nnetworks, individual physical comorbidities, intervention programs\nand fear of accessing emergency medical care.\nClinical experience leads us to believe that drug use and\noverdose have multiple influences at the individual, social and\ngenetic levels. The same multi-factorial influences may make\ndrug abuse stories attractive subjects for journalists, combined\nwith the fundamental issues crossing sociodemographic lines. It\nhas also been noted that ``media portrayals of the consumption\nand effects of alcohol do not comprise a neutral, scientific reality\nbut rather signify a network of social knowledge, value systems,\nand symbols,'' with the same likely occurring for other substances\n[31]. There may be public expectation for coverage, and while\npredictable, the media aren't necessarily acting beyond the pale\nof their professional responsibilities. Yet, there is little formal\nguidance to journalists for appropriate coverage of this sensitive\ntopic. The editors of PLoS point out that ``today's health\nreporters may have been covering crime last week and politics the\nweek before,'' [32] and media reporting of medical news has long\nbeen criticized [33]. At the intersection of crime, health and\npolitics, news reporting about drug abuse reflects a complex\ninteraction of social factors, with little guidance as to how these\nissues should be covered. A recent article by PLoS Medicine\neditors on news coverage of suicides in the military reminds us\nthat ``reporters have a choice about how they frame stories about\nmental illness'' [34]. While individual-level influence of news\nreporting cannot be deduced from surveillance-oriented studies,\nand require more intensive analyses [35,36], our results suggest\nthe need for a thorough evaluation of this topic, with an eye\ntowards ethical standards that promote responsible journalism\n[12]. These standards could be analogous to guidelines for stories\non suicide [37\u00ad40], where the role of the news media in copycat\nresearchers believe the link to be less than definitive [44].\nFurthermore, our study suggests that there may be opportunity to\nharness news reports as an early warning indicator of emerging\ndrug problems, similar recent work in infectious disease\nIn support of the long-standing need for journalistic standards,\nwe identified certain articles that amounted to inadvertent\nendorsements of prescription drug abuse; while dangers associ-\nated with drug abuse were mentioned in later paragraphs of\narticles, the opening lines presented an enticing scenario. A 2000\nPortland Press Herald article opened with: ``Euphoria envelopes\nyour body in a warm, cozy hug. Problems dissolve. Limbs tingle.\nLife feels perfect. These are the sensations that drug addict\nChristopher Coughlin says he felt using OxyContin, a highly\naddictive opiate that is sweeping Maine, from the streets of South\nPortland to the rural communities of Washington County.'' [45]\nStrikingly, Breecher (1972) noted nearly identical language in a\nNewsweek article from 1962, suggesting a longstanding cyclical\npattern in the way news about drug abuse is presented: ``You're\nin outer space. You're Superman. You're floating in air, seeing\ndouble, riding next to God. It's Kicksville. Are these the fantasies\nof narcotics addicts on a pop? No. More disturbingly, these\nhopped-up reactions are those of teenagers hooked on goofballs,\nmodel airplane glue, and cough medicine. Across the nation,\npolice last week reported case after case of this alarming trend.''\n[4,46] The similarity of language goes beyond semantics; it\nsuggests a consistent mindset and approach to reporting about\nsubstance use that has not changed substantially in at least four\ndecades, if not longer [47].\nOur findings are consistent with findings from previous cycles of\ndrug abuse concern. At the height of reporting on cocaine during\nnational media were devoted to drug issues, starting at less than\n1% in the start of that year [8]. By using electronic news sources,\nwe were able to expand the analytic space to include local and\nregional print news media. Reflecting the greater volume and\nFigure 4. Rates of OxyContin print news media mentions in the United States, 1999\u00ad2006, by state. Print news media articles showed a\nprogression from localized reporting, to national attention and eventual regression between 1999 and 2006, based on an analysis where articles were\ngeotagged based on the US state which the article was describing or was published in, see text for methodology. OxyContin problems were first\ndescribed in 2001 with particular focus on the Appalachian region and New England. Between 2001 and 2003, there was a sharp increase in articles\nabout OxyContin published about Florida, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. The highest state-level rates of OxyContin news articles were in 2001. After\n2003, reporting became more homogenous with substantial reporting throughout the country. Media attention on OxyContin started to subside\nsoon afterwards, with a return to localized reporting in 2005. By 2006, New Jersey had the highest rates, as articles about abuse- and tamper-resistant\nformulations in development become prominent; New Jersey has a large concentration of pharmaceutical manufacturers and many of these articles\nwere from financial news sources describing attempts to develop formulations that would be less prone to tampering. The geo-temporal spread of\nnews reports about OxyContin mirror the experiences of previous cycles of drug abuse panics in the United States.\nNews Media and Opioid Overdose\ndiversification of news media outlets in the 2000s, we found that\nonly 0.08% of news volume involved prescription opioids. While\nwe cannot make a direct comparison between previous work and\nour analysis, new media will have to be considered in future\nanalyses. Print news media articles serve as a measureable proxy\nfor other forms of media that may also mention prescription\nopioids. In today's rich multimedia environment competing and\nsynergistic influences of multiple sources of information need to be\nassessed systematically, and future research may well focus on\nblogs and other electronic news sources. An analysis of internet\ncomments about news reports of adolescent suicides suggested the\nstrong influence of the style of reporting and attitudes about\nmental health [48]. Hawton and colleagues (1999) noted a short-\nterm increase in patients presenting for intentional drug overdoses\nafter the broadcast of a popular television drama depicting drug\nself-poisoning [49]. Basic health psychology research is needed to\nguide further efforts in this area.\nWe compared print news media articles to unintentional and\nundetermined intent poisoning mortality because vital statistics are\nthe only publicly available data source with information on\nsubstance use disorders that has national coverage and can be\nanalyzed on a monthly basis. Data from vital statistics reports are\nknown to have limitations [50\u00ad52], with particular fears of\nunderreporting. Medical examiners and coroners in the United\nStates do not have standardized assessment and attribution\nprocedures for suspected drug poisoning deaths. In addition,\nacute poisonings due to patients' medication dosing errors with\npotent opioids would be classified the same as a fatal opioid\npoisonings from drug abuse under ICD-10 coding. It is unknown\nwhat proportion of the deaths observed were from each type of\nexposure (and what the overlap may be), but deaths from medical\nerrors involving specific prescription opioid pain relievers have\nresulted in nationwide alerts from the Food and Drug Adminis-\ntration [53,54]. In order to address this problem we conducted\nsensitivity analyses using different combinations of ICD-10 codes\nrepresenting wider and narrower definitions, such as including\nmental health codes as has been suggested by others [52]. While\nthe absolute number of poisoning fatalities fluctuated with the\ndifferent definitions, the proportional change appeared to be\nnearly constant over time, resulting in similar results in lag\nregression analysis. We do not present these results here for the\nsake of brevity.\nAnother possible explanation for part of the observed\ncorrelation is diagnostic suspicion bias, that medical examiners\nmore carefully screened for opioid poisonings in deaths of\nuncertain cause, after they themselves were exposed the media\nreports about overdose, or concerns expressed in the medical\nliterature. This type of response has not been noted for medical\nexaminers and drug overdoses in the literature, but remains\nplausible. As our research team has described elsewhere [23], the\nproportion of unintentional poisoning deaths in which a narcotic\nwas not specified decreased slightly in metropolitan areas between\nHowever it has been noted that voluntary reporting to the Food\nand Drug Administration's spontaneous adverse event reporting\nsystem increased following publicized problems with adverse\nevents for pharmaceutical medications and devices [55\u00ad57]. To\nwhat extent this introduces bias in our analysis is unclear.\nWhile previous generations of researchers have examined the\nquestion of the news media and substance use reporting, much of\nthe findings have been sequestered to the sociology literature and\nhave focused on qualitative analysis of media content. Few\nstudies have attempted to link media data with information on\ndrug use trends in a quantitative manner with temporal and\ngeographic specificity. Substance use disorders have become\nincreasingly medicalized in the last two decades (i.e., the\n``chronic relapsing brain disease'' model), and pain has been\nmore systematically assessed and aggressively treated with\noutpatient pharmacotherapies. Simultaneously there has been a\nprofusion of the types of media involved in reporting news.\nHowever, biomedical science research has paid limited attention\nto the social context in which drug use problems and pain are\nperceived on a community level and what role mass media play,\nespecially electronic sources. Returning to Blendon and Young\n(1998), ``In the future, if health professionals want to change the\ndirection of Americans' beliefs on particular drug policies they\nwill have to devote significant resources to gaining media\nattention for their views.'' We agree with them, but feel that\njournalism standards would also be beneficial. Perhaps the next\n``drug epidemic'' will benefit from a more balanced and public\nhealth approach to reporting, but it requires immediate\ninterdisciplinary action.\n"
