Rats of either sex allotted to the following groups: (i) triple therapy: metformin\n(120 mg/kg, o.d.) + pioglitazone (1.25 mg/kg, o.d.) + glimepiride (0.7 mg/kg, o.d.); (ii) dual therapy: vildagliptin (8.76 mg/\nkg, o.d.) + telmisartan (6.48 mg/kg, o.d.); (iii) vildagliptin (8.76 mg/kg, o.d.); and (iv) telmisartan (6.48 mg/kg, o.d.); therapy\nwas carried out for 35 days orally. Weekly at days 7, 14, 21, 28 and 35, blood pressure, blood glucose level, body weight,\nblood serum creatinine level, protein albumin level in urine, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were estimated. Renal\nstructural changes were observed.\nResults: Blood pressure, blood glucose level, blood serum creatinine level, protein albumin level in urine, BUN and renal\ndeterioration increased significantly in diabetic rats compared with normal control rats. The vildagliptin + telmisartan\ntreatment group showed no weight gain and controlled blood pressure, renovascular structural and biochemical param-\neters in diabetic neuropathy rats.\nConclusions: The addition of telmisartan to vildagliptin demonstrated the best control over blood pressure, glycemia and\ndiabetic nephropathy markers, renal structural changes and improvement of renal function as opposed to monotherapy\nwith either drug, possibly because of the dual inhibitory effect on the renin\u00adangiotensin system.\n",

It is defined by proteinuria > 500 mg in 24 hours in\nthe setting of diabetes, but this is preceded by lower degrees\nof proteinuria, or \"microalbuminuria.\" Microalbuminuria\nWithout intervention, diabetic patients with microalbuminu-\nria typically progress to proteinuria and overt DN. This pro-\ngression occurs in types 1 and 2 diabetes. The pathological\nchanges to the kidney include increased glomerular\nbasement membrane (GBM) thickness, microaneurysm for-\nmation, mesangial nodule formation (Kimmelsteil-Wilson\nbodies), and other changes. As many as 7% of patients with\ntype 2 diabetes may already have microalbuminuria at the\ntime they are diagnosed with diabetes.1\nDN, or nephropatia diabetica, also known as\nKimmelstiel-Wilson syndrome, or nodular diabetic glomer-\nulosclerosis and intercapillary glomerulonephritis, is a pro-\ngressive kidney disease caused by angiopathy of capillaries\nin the kidney glomeruli.

It is due to\nlongstanding diabetes mellitus and is a prime indication for\ndialysis in many Western countries. DN is a common\ncomplication of diabetes mellitus in which there is long-\nterm damage to the kidneys as a result of long-term poorly\ncontrolled diabetes. The renal vessels and the glomerulus\nare the main areas affected. DN is characterized by the\npresence of a protein called albumin in the urine, hyperten-\nsion (high blood pressure), edema (swelling) and progres-\nsive renal insufficiency.2\nVildagliptin is an antihyperglycemic agent that selectively\ninhibits the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) enzyme. Such\ninhibition prevents the degradation of the incretin hormones\nglucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent\ninsulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). This results in improved\nglycemic control as determined by glycated hemoglobin\n(HbA1c) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels and, in\naddition, an enhancement of pancreatic - and -cell func-\ntion. Vildagliptin is indicated in the European Union and\nelsewhere in the world for the management of type 2 diabe-\ntes mellitus in combination with metformin, a sulfonylurea\nor a thiazolidinedione in patients with inadequate glycemic\ncontrol following monotherapy. Vildagliptin is also available\nas a fixed-dose formulation with metformin.3\nOne study has demonstrated that treatment with tel-\nmisartan significantly decreased fasting blood glucose\n(FBG). The antidiabetic activity of telmisartan may be\ndue to improved glucose metabolism via the blocking of\nthe inhibitory effect of angiotensin II (Ang II) on insulin\nsignal transmission and telmisartan's function as a mod-\nerately potent partial peroxisome proliferator-activated\nreceptor gamma (PPAR-) agonist activating the receptor\nto 25\u00ad30% of the levels of the full agonists, such as the\nthiazolidinedione agents. There are structural resem-\nblances between the angiotensin II receptor blocker\n(ARB) agents and the full PPAR- agonists, such as\nrosiglitazone and pioglitazone.4\nOral vildagliptin in combination with metformin, a\nsulfonylurea or a thiazolidinedione, improved glycemic\ncontrol in adults with type 2 diabetes and appeared to\nslow the progression of -cell degeneration in trials of\n24\u00ad52 weeks' duration. In trials in patients with diabetes\ninadequately controlled with metformin, vildagliptin\nprovided an additional reduction of HbA1c levels of\n1.1% and was shown to be as effective as pioglitazone as\nadd-on therapy in a noninferiority trial. Vildagliptin had\na low risk of hypoglycemia, was weight-neutral overall\nand was generally well tolerated.3\nFurther investigation is required to accurately position\nvildagliptin relative to other drugs. This further investiga-\ntion may be based on a combination of vildagliptin and\nseveral angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors /ARBs.\nRandomized studies have demonstrated that ARBs, control-\nling systemic blood pressure, delay progression of pro-\nteinuria, reduce microalbuminuria, prevent progression to\nmacroalbuminuria and maintain renal function in patients\nwith DN. Telmisartan is a member of the ARB class and is\nbeing investigated in the most ambitious and far-reaching\nresearch program ever conducted with anARB. Telmisartan\nhas a number of features that may make it particularly suit-\nable for the treatment of DN. In addition to its long duration\nof action and almost exclusive fecal excretion, its high lipo-\nphilicity should assist in tissue penetration.5\nSo, the present study focuses on dual therapy of vilda-\ngliptin and telmisartan on DN in experimentally induced\ntype-2 diabetic mellitus rats.\nMaterials and methods\nAnimals\nthe Animal House, Gyan Vihar School of Pharmacy,\nSuresh Gyan Vihar University, were used. All animal\nexperiments were approved by the Institutional Animal\nEthical Committee (Gyan Vihar School of Pharmacy),\nCommittee for the Purpose of Control and Supervision of\nCPCSEA. The animals were housed in polycarbonate\ncages in a room with a 12-hour (h) day-night cycle, tem-\nthe whole experimental period, animals were fed with a\nbalanced commercial diet and water ad libitum.\nInduction of diabetic neuropathy\nNicotinamide-streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 2 diabetes in\nthe rat6\u00ad9.Noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus was\ninduced in overnight fasted rats by a single intraperitonial\ninjection of 65 mg/kg body weight STZ, 15 minutes (min)\nafter the intraperitonial administration of 110 mg/kg body\nweight of nicotinamide. STZ was dissolved in citrate buffer\n(0.1 M, pH 4.5) and nicotinamide was dissolved in normal\nsaline. The injection site was the dorsal midpoint between\nthe pelvis and ribs close to the right side of the spine.\nHyperglycemia was confirmed by the elevated glucose lev-\nels in plasma, determined at 72 h and then on day 7 after\ninjection. Animals with blood glucose concentration more\nthan 200 mg/dl were used for the study.\nDrugs and chemicals\nKetamine (Themis Medicare Ltd, Mumbai, India), STZ\n(Sigma Aldrich), nicotinamide (Lobal Chemie), vildaglip-\ntin (Novartis Pharma) and telmisartan (Aristo Pharma Ltd.\nMumbai, India) were used in the current study.\nExperimental protocol\nAnimals used included insulin-resistant (IR) type 2 diabetic\nrats (induced by intraperitoneal STZ and nicotinamide). IR\nrats of either sex were randomly allotted into different\n412 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 15(4)\nexperimental groups, each containing six animals. Drug\ntreatment (i) triple therapy: metformin (120 mg/kg, o.d.) +\npioglitazone (1.25 mg/kg, o.d.) + glimepiride (0.7 mg/kg,\no.d.); (ii) dual therapy: vildagliptin (8.76 mg/kg) + tel-\n(iv) telmisartan (6.48 mg/kg) was carried out for 35 days\nwith the help of an oral catheter every morning. Weekly at\nlevel, body weight, blood serum creatinine level, protein\nalbumin level in urine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was esti-\nmated in STZ-nicotinamide-induced DN in rats (Table 1).\nCollection of blood samples\nAt the end of drug treatment, all the animals were fasted\novernight but allowed free access to water. The next morn-\ning, a blood sample was withdrawn by retro orbital sinus\nunder mild ether anesthesia. The blood samples were col-\nlected into vacutainers precoated with ethylenediaminetet-\nraacetic acid (EDTA) as anticoagulant. Blood samples were\ncentrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min in a refrigerated centri-\nfuge (i.e. temperature 4\u00b0C). The plasma separated as\nstraw-colored supernatant was used for various biochemi-\ncal parameters. It was stored at -20\u00b0C until the completion\nof the analysis.\nCollection of urine sample\nAt the end of drug treatment, all the animals were kept in\nmetabolic cages for 24 h. Animals were fasted but allowed\nfree access to water. Urine samples were collected after 24\nh in urine-collecting bottles.\nBiochemical estimations\nMeasurement of renal function and biochemical parameters\n1) Blood glucose was measured by Accu-Chek Active\nglucose strips. The blood glucose estimation was\nperformed weekly after administration of the test\ncompound.\n2) Albumin excretion rate and total protein excre-\ntion rate in urine were measured using Span and\nRanbaxy diagnostic kits by autoanalyzer (Echo,\nLogotech Pvt. Ltd, India).\n3) BUN values were measured by the BUN GLDH kit\n(Bhat Bio-tech Pvt. Ltd, Bangalore, India) tech-\nnique as per instructions of the kit manufacturers.\nA BUN test measures the amount of nitrogen in blood\nthat comes from the waste product urea. Urea is made when\nprotein is broken down in the body. Urea is made in the\nliver and passed out of the body in urine.\nA BUN test is performed to see how well the kidneys are\nworking. If the kidneys are not able to remove urea from\nthe blood normally, the BUN level rises. Heart failure,\ndehydration, or a diet high in protein can also make the\nBUN level higher. Liver disease or damage can lower the\nBUN level.\n4) Serum creatinine rate was measured using\nCREATININE KIT by Mod. Jaffe's Kinetic Method\n(Coral Clinical System, Goa, India).\nCreatinine is the catabolic product of creatinine phos-\nphate, which is used by the skeletal muscle. The daily pro-\nduction depends on muscular mass, and it is excreted out of\nthe body entirely by the kidneys. Elevated levels are found\nin renal dysfunction, reduced renal blood flow (shock,\ndehydration, congestive heart failure) and diabetes acro-\nmegaly. Decreased levels are found in muscular dystrophy.\n5) Blood pressure was monitored using the tail-cuff\nmethod for all of the groups.\nHistopathological examination\nAt the end of the experiments, all rats were sacrificed and\npathological analysis of the kidney was performed. The\nkidney tissues were preserved in buffered neutral formalin\nand stored at -20 \u00baC until processed for histopathology.\nTissues were preserved in 1% w/v glutaraldehyde and 4%\nw/v formaldehyde in phosphate buffer, pH -7.2 at 4\u00baC\nuntil processed for electron microscopy. Tissues were pro-\ncessed for histopathology at room temperature and\ninvolved the following steps: (a) fixation, (b) processing\nTable 1. List of experimental groups used.\nS. no.

After 35 days of\nexamination, the rats were sacrificed by a single intraperito-\nnial injection of kitamine. Light microscopy study in kidney\ntissue sections stained with hematoxylin-eosin revealed glo-\nmerulosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis, tubular vacuoliza-\ntion (TV), thickening of the GBM, mesangial matrix\nexpansion (ME) and nodular lesion (NL). In the diabetic\ngroup (Figure 8) maximum renovascular degeneration was\nfound, but in the treatment groups these changes were\nattenuated. The vildagliptin plus telmisartan-treated group\n(Figure 10) showed maximum renoprotection as compared\nto vildagliptin alone (Figure 10) and the standard (pioglita-\nzone + glemipiride + metformin)-treated group (Figure 9)\nbecause of the absence of glomerulosclerosis and interstitial\nfibrosis, NL and improvement of GBM thickness and\nmesangial ME. In the diabetic group (Figure 8), increased\nglomerulosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis, TV, thickening\nof the GBM, mesangial ME and NL was observed as com-\npared to the normal group (Figure 7), but in the treatment\ngroups these changes were attenuated, possibly because of\nthe different drugs' renoprotective mechanisms.\nDiscussion\nCaptopril, lisinopril, quinapril and fosinopril are cur-\nrently used ACE inhibitors to treat DN.

Lisinopril inhibits the formation of\ntransforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u00df) and tubuloint-\nerstitial fibrosis in DN patients. Proteinuria, glomerular\nhypertrophy and tubulointerstitial fibrosis were reduced\nby fosinopril in experimental DN. Quinapril reduces\nproteinuria, cholesterol levels, glomerular lesions and\npodocyte damage in DN. AT1\nARBs like candesartan and\ntelmisartan have been noted to attenuate DN by reducing\nproteinuria.

Inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl coen-\nzyme A (HMG-CoA)-reductase by statins like atorvastatin,\npravastatin and cerivastatin was noted to activate eNOS,\nmaintain glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal cortical\nblood flow and consequently reduce glomerular lesions.\nResveratrol, a polyphenolic phytoalexin and potent antioxi-\ndant present in red wine, attenuated renal dysfunction by\nreducing proteinuria and ROS formation in rats with DN.\nOn the basis of this discussion, it may be suggested that the\nabove-mentioned drugs may have improved renal function\nin nephropathy because of their properties of protecting the\nfunction of vascular endothelium.14\nOur study has demonstrated that treatment with vilda-\ngliptin and telmisartan significantly decreased FBG. The\nantidiabetic activity of vildagliptin is due to improved\ninsulin secretion and peripheral insulin sensitivity. The\nDPP-4 inhibitor vildagliptin is a novel class of antidiabetic\nmedication. Inhibition of DPP-4 by vildagliptin prevents\ndegradation of GLP-1 and reduces glycemia in patients\nwith type 2 diabetes mellitus, with a low risk for hypogly-\ncemia and no weight gain. Vildagliptin binds covalently to\nthe catalytic site of DPP-4, eliciting prolonged enzyme\ninhibition. This raises intact GLP-1 levels, both after meal\ningestion and in the fasting state.14\nThe combination of vildagliptin and telmisartan has\nshown to significantly decrease symptoms of DN. Diabetic\nrats treated with vildagliptin and telmisartan showed a\nreduction in albumin excretion rate, serum creatinine rate,\nBUN, FBG and renal structural changes. There were also\nreported markedly changes in albuminuria, protenuria that\nis a marker and potential contributor to renal injury that\naccompanies DN. Interventions that have ameliorated the\nprogression of DN have been associated with a reduction in\nurinary protein excretion.\nRecent large landmark clinical studies have shown that\nintensive glucose control reduces the risk of the develop-\nment and progression of DN, and the blockade RAS is\nalso an important target for both metabolic and hemody-\nnamic derangements in DN. It has been demonstrated that\ntreatment with telmisartan significantly decreases FBG.\nThe antidiabetic activity of telmisartan may be due to\nimproved glucose metabolism via blocking of the inhibi-\ntory effect of Ang II on insulin signal transmission and\ntelmisartan's function as a moderately potent partial\nPPAR- agonist activating the receptor to 25\u00ad30% of the\nlevels of the full agonists, such as the thiazolidinedione\nagents. There are structural resemblances between the ARB\nagents and the full PPAR- agonists, such as rosiglitazone\nand pioglitazone.4\nRenoprotective therapy should aim to achieve the maxi-\nmal antialbuminuric effect. There are several mechanisms\nwhereby increased microalbuminuria and activation of the\nRAS has been shown to play a role in the pathogenesis of\nrenal diseases. Hyperglycemia as an observed symptom in\ndiabetes greatly activates the RAS.Activation of RAS leads\nto Ang II formation. AT-1 receptor stimulation by Ang II\nmay directly induce synthesis of TGF-1.Ang II, the effector\nmolecule of RAS, stimulates extracellular matrix protein\nsynthesis through induction of TGF-1 in mesangial cells,\nrenal interstitial fibroblasts and proximal tubular epithelial\ncells. Thus, the reduction in plasma TGF-1 concentration\nwith telmisartan, demonstrated in the present study, may\nreflect attenuated TGF-1 synthesis by all of these renal\ncell types. Pro-inflammatory cytokines may play a signifi-\ncant role in the development of renal injury in type 2 diabetes.\nTherefore, results from experimental studies indicate that\ninhibition of Ang II receptor activity is associated with\nbeneficial renal effects, suggesting that modulation of this\ncytokine may have a real clinical application for the\nBlood pressure is the most important clinical driver/pro-\ngression factor of DN. Careful monitoring is thus a must in\nany DN study. In the present study, blood pressure in DN\nrats was monitored. Vildagliptin has a poor blood pressure\neffect, whereas the telmisartan group had better systolic\nand diastolic blood pressure control. However, the combi-\nnation of vildagliptin and telmisartan acts synergistically\nand has the best control over blood pressure, glycemia and\nDN markers. We have shown that the dual therapy of\nvildagliptin and telmisartan resulted in a greater decrease\nin blood glucose, albumin excretion rate, serum creatinine\nrate, BUN and renal structural changes than treatment with\nvildagliptin alone. The result of the present work was that\nthe combination of vildagliptin with telmisartan could be\nmore proficient in preventing STZ-induced type 2 DN than\nan individual drug therapy or triple therapy, and our results\nsupport our hypothesis. Histopathological findings also\nhave demonstrated recovery in glomerulosclerosis, intersti-\ntial fibrosis, NL, TV, mesangial ME and thickening of\nGBM by the combination of vildagliptin and telmisartan.\nConclusion\nThe hypothesis of the present work was to compare the dual\ntherapy of vildagliptin with telmisartan versus vildagliptin\nalone on STZ-induced type 2 DN in rats. Our results show\nthat the combination of vildagliptin with telmisartan is\nmore effective in ameliorating DN than vildagliptin or\ntelmisartan single-drug therapy or triple therapy, by sup-\npressing blood pressure, albumin excretion rate in urine,\ntotal serum creatinine rate and BUN during the develop-\nment of STZ-induced type 2 DN. Finally, the significant\neffect of combined therapy (vildagliptin plus telmisartan)\ncould be a result of synergistic/potentiative action on the\nRAS, and together they may be able to target multiple\nmechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of DN.\n418 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 15(4)\nConflict of interest\nNone declared.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any funding\nagency in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
