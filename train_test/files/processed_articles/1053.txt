    "reduced_content": "As the population lives longer, is it\nliving in more or less healthy states?\nManton and Gu (1) tackled this question\nin a recent issue of PNAS. Understanding\nwhether the population is healthier or not\nis vitally important to individuals and to\nsociety as a whole. People value longevity\nimprovements more when the quality of\nlife of the additional years is high. Living\nlonger but with severe disability is no-\nwhere near as enjoyable as living longer\nwith good health. The social consequences\nof an aging population also depend on\naverage health. Disabled people use sig-\nnificantly more medical resources than do\nnondisabled people. If the elderly popu-\nlation is increasingly healthy, the impact of\noverall population aging on medical care\nneeds will be smaller than if the surviving\npopulation is increasingly frail. Further,\npolicies to encourage additional work ef-\nfort among the elderly will only be suc-\ncessful if the elderly have the physical\ncapacity to perform the work. Reduced\ndisability will not solve the aging problem\nfor the public sector--medical spending is\nincreasing too rapidly for that--but it can\nameliorate the magnitude of the problem.\nThere has been a longstanding debate\nconcerning whether the elderly are more\nor less healthy over time. Demographers\ncluded that the elderly were increasingly\nless healthy (2). The data used were not of\nhigh quality, however, and they afforded\nmultiple interpretations (3). The National\nLong-Term Care Survey (NLTCS), first\nconducted in 1982, was designed in part to\nrectify this difficulty. The NLTCS asks\ndetailed questions about disability in a\nconsistent manner over time. It samples\nfrom all of the elderly population, not just\ncommunity dwellers. And it now has\nnearly 20 years of data from a consistent\nManton and Gu (1) reported the findings\nManton and Gu (1) present clear, over-\nwhelming evidence that the average\nhealth of the elderly population is improv-\nthe elderly with severe disabilities, mea-\nsured roughly as the ability to function\nindependently with ease, declined from\nyear. The importance of this finding is\nhard to overstate. The NLTCS data are\ndesigned ideally to look at disability\nchanges, so these results have particular\ncredence. They are a major advance in\nour knowledge.\nAlthough initially greeted skeptically\n(4), the NLTCS results are increasingly\nbeing replicated in other studies, including\nthe National Health Interview Survey, the\nMedicare Current Beneficiary Survey,\nand the Survey of Income and Program\nParticipation (5). The one partial outlier is\nthe Supplement on\nAging to the Health In-\nterview Survey, which\nshowed a constant dis-\nability rate by one mea-\ncline in disability by an-\nother. Overall, the\nweight of the evidence\nsuggests large disability\nreductions, as shown in\nthe NLTCS. This is very welcome news.\nManton and Gu (1) have several other\nimportant findings. First, they show that\nthe reduction in disability is occurring\nincreasingly more rapidly over time. Be-\nclined by 1.0% per year. The rate of\ndecline increased to 1.7% per year be-\nand Gu (1) show that disability is falling\nfor blacks as well as whites. Over the entire\ndecline in disability for blacks roughly\nequals that for whites, despite the fact that\nblack disability was increasing in the 1980s\nand white disability was falling. Blacks\nmade up for the lost ground in the 1990s.\nThe important question raised by these\nresults is why disability is falling so rapidly.\nManton and Gu (1) provide tantalizing ev-\nidence on this question, but do not tackle it\nhead on. Understanding the cause of re-\nduced disability is vital, because it indicates\nwhether the decline in disability can be\nexpected to continue into the future or not.\nDisability reductions resulting from im-\nproved public health measures at the turn of\nthe 20th century, for example, will not be as\nimportant over the next few decades, when\nthe elderly population will have been born\nsubstantially after those improvements,\nwhereas disability reductions resulting from\nshifts away from manual labor would be\nexpected to continue.\nThe cause of disability decline is multi-\nfactorial. One clear contributing factor is\nimproved medical treatments. Many\nelderly are disabled by arthritis, which can\nbe treated with pharmaceuticals (NSAIDs\nand, increasingly, COX-2 inhibitors) or, in\nthe extreme, joint replacement surgery.\nUse of these technologies has expanded\nover time. Cataract surgery is also increas-\ningly common and\nreduces disability as-\nsociated with visual\nimpairment. Manton\nand Gu (1) provide\nindirect evidence for\nthe importance of\ntechnological im-\nprovements for dis-\nability reduction.\nThey note the coin-\ncidence between re-\nduced cardiovascular disease mortality\nand the implementation of Medicare.\nHeart disease is a leading cause of chronic\ndisability, so this is an important link.\nMore direct evidence comes from studies\nshowing the role of specific medications in\nreduced hypertension (6), a leading risk\nfactor for strokes, and from studies show-\ning the spread of cataract surgery to peo-\nple with increasingly less severe visual\nimpairment (7). Because the NLTCS has\ndata on Medicare records that are linked\nto the survey participants, estimates of the\nrole of medical technology in improved\nhealth can be conducted.\nBehavioral changes are also important\nin reduced disability. The one-third de-\nand the late 1990s reduces chronic respi-\nratory damage, heart disease, and strokes.\nReduced fat intake over the same time\nperiod (8) has had similar effects. The\nimpact of improved diets and reduced\nsmoking for emphysema, heart disease,\nand stroke are likely key contributors in\nreduced disability in the past two decades.\n*E-mail: dcutler@harvard.edu.\nManton and Gu present\nclear, overwhelming\nevidence that the average\nhealth of the elderly\npopulation is improving.\nA third explanation is the spread of\nassistive devices for people with health\ntroubles. Canes and walkers help infirm\nelderly stay out of nursing homes; walk-in\nshowers and grab bars prevent hip frac-\ntures and allow those who have had a\nfracture to live independently; microwave\novens make it easier for the frail elderly to\ncook; and telephones with larger keypads\nenable the visually impaired to communi-\ncate. Manton and colleagues (9), in earlier\nwork with the NLTCS, documented a\nlarge change in use of assistive devices\nover time. Increased use of assistive de-\nvices has been found in other surveys as\nSuch assistive devices may be particularly\nimportant in reduced nursing home utiliza-\ntion. Manton and Gu (1) document the\nenormous decline in nursing home resi-\nin the last few years. Although some of this\ndecline reflects reduced disability overall,\nanother part reflects the growth of assisted\nliving facilities that provide many of these\nassistive technologies in a more pleasant\nenvironment than a nursing home.\nThe impact of assistive devices on dis-\nability in the community is more difficult\nto ascertain. In the NLTCS, as in other\nsurveys of disability, people using assistive\ndevices specifically designed to provide\nhelp with daily functions are counted as\ndisabled. Thus, providing canes to people\nwith arthritis would increase disability,\neven if walking longer distances had be-\ncome easier. As a result, the true decline\nin disability may be even greater than\nManton and Gu (1) report. The net impact\nof assistive device use on disability has yet\nto be sorted out.\nAn additional factor in reduced disability\nis improved socioeconomic status. Manton\nand Gu (1) highlight a key aspect of this, the\nincreasing education of the elderly. Manton\nand Gu (1) show that more educated indi-\nviduals have a disability rate of only about\nhalf as much as less edu-\ncated people. Coupled\nwith the large increase in\nthe share of elderly with\nhigh school and college\ndegrees, this finding\nhelps to explain the de-\ncline in disability in re-\ncent decades. Indeed,\nthis trend will continue\nfor many decades into\nthe future as education among the elderly\ncontinues to increase.\nThe important question is why educa-\ntion is related to disability. Education can\ninfluence disability in many ways: by al-\nlowing greater access to medical care re-\nsources, by increasing knowledge about\nappropriate health behaviors, and by the\ndirect impact of mental stimulation on\ncognitive functioning. For example, Stern\net al. (11) speculate that educational at-\ntainment imparts a reserve that delays the\nonset of Alzheimer's disease.\nOccupation is closely related to educa-\ntion and is a further dimension of socio-\neconomic status. The current elderly who\nworked in blue-collar jobs over their life-\ntime were exposed to substantially more\ndust and fumes than were the elderly who\nworked in white-collar jobs. The same is\ntrue for elderly who lived on farms, which\nwas much more common decades ago than\nit is today. Costa (12) shows that the\nchange in occupational composition ex-\nplains a significant part of the long-term\ndecline in disability in the United States.\nEstimates of the impact of occupation\nchange in recent decades are lacking.\nFinally, disability reduction may reflect\na change in the disease environment over\ntime. Increasing evidence documents that\ninfectious diseases\nencountered early in\nlife influence health\nlater in life. The link\nbetween rheumatic\nfever and rheumatic\nheart disease is par-\nticularly clear (13).\nAssociations also\nhave been shown be-\ntween heart disease\nlaria (16). Even prenatal factors such as\nmaternal malnutrition and lack of ade-\nquate weight gain may influence late life\ndisease (17). Older generations of elderly\nwere more exposed to these diseases and\nconditions as children than were younger\ngenerations, which may partly explain the\nchange in disability over time.\nLittle research has tested and compared\nthese different theories. With the report\non disability decline in the Manton and Gu\n(1) paper, the basic facts about disability\nchange are now complete. The next few\nyears should turn to research considering\nwhy disability has changed, testing these\nand other explanations. Our knowledge of\nchronic disability, advanced so clearly by\nManton and Gu (1), should grow even\nmore rapidly in the years ahead.\nI thank the National Institutes on Aging for\nresearch support.\n1.
