    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe relationship between self-employment and certain macroeconomic variables is often at the heart of the debate about\nthe contributions of self-employment to employment and economic growth; examining this relationship is the aim of this\narticle.This article is devoted to the empirical exploration of the comovement and causality between entrepreneurship and\neconomic performance in both directions.This study searches for basic relationships between self-employment and certain\nmacroeconomic variables in Spain using quarterly data from 1980:1 to 2009:4.From this analysis,four key findings emerge: (a)\nthe relation between self-employment and the business cycle differs across two components of self-employment,that is,employers\nand own-account workers;(b) the existence of a strong bidirectional causality between self-employment and unemployment and\nGDP; (c) business cycles contain information valuable for predicting today's employers; and (d) entrepreneurship promotion\npolicies oriented to encourage the emergence of new job creators may be a cornerstone of a new strategy to combat\nunemployment.These results should be kept in mind when designing entrepreneurship policies.\n",
    "reduced_content": "http://sgo.sagepub.com\nUnemployment in Spain has reached striking levels; it is\nnow the highest in the EU-25. The Spanish unemployment\nwill be approximately 23% at the end of this year.\nThe pessimistic GDP forecasts, combined with a high\nbudget deficit and serious financial problems, do not seem to\naugur the long-awaited employment recovery.\nIn this context, the new government has just enacted a\ndeep labor reform (the eighth since 1984) seeking to remove\nlabor rigidities, and they are devising a new self-employment\npromotion program. These two elements are the primary pil-\nlars for combating the dramatic increase in the level of\nunemployment in an economy affected by the recession.\nThe logic of promoting self-employment as a way to combat\nunemployment is quite simple. There are two ways in which\nself-employment reduces unemployment: directly, by removing\na newly self-employed individual from the rolls of the unem-\nployed, and indirectly, because some of these new entrepreneurs\nwill contribute to job creation by hiring workers.\nHowever, inadequate results have cast doubts on public\nschemes that encourage the long-term unemployed to\nbecome self-employed (Congregado, Golpe, & Carmona,\nthe scheme were not qualified to run a business of their own\nand instead decided to become self-employed as a last resort\nIn recessions, lower factor prices (including capital) in com-\nbination with lower opportunity costs of paid employment (due\nto the low job offer arrival rate) tend to lead to an increase in\nthe number of self-employed.1 As Ghatak, Morelli, and\nSj\u00f6str\u00f6m (2007) note, the average quality of entrants decreases\nduring recessions, and this phenomenon may prolong the reces-\nsion. Therefore, promoting entrepreneurship during recessions\nwill reinforce this process of entry into self-employment.\nIn any case, Lucas (1978) suggests that a large number of\nthese new entrepreneurs will return to paid employment in\nbooms. Thus, the promotion will have only a temporary effect.\nIn sum, promoting entrepreneurship may not be a panacea\nforthelong-termredeploymentofunemployedpeople.However,\nthe key factor, at least in countries ravaged by unemployment\nlike Spain, is knowing whether the relationship between self-\nemployment and certain macroeconomic variables, such as GDP\nor the unemployment rate, can help us better understand the pos-\nsible role of entrepreneurship policies during recessions.\nThe relationship between self-employment and macro-\neconomic variables is at the heart of the debate about the\n1University of Huelva, Spain\nCorresponding Author:\nEmilio Congregado, Department of Economics, University of Huelva, Plaza\nEmail: congregado@uhu.es\nComovement Between Self-Employment\nand MacroeconomicVariables: Evidence\nFrom Spain\nM\u00f3nica Carmona1, Emilio Congregado1, and Antonio A. Golpe1\n Keywords\nself-employment, entrepreneurship, Spain, time-series models, business cycles\n2 SAGE Open\ncontribution of self-employment to economic development.\nIn particular, a better understanding of the dynamics of self-\nemployment over the cycle has become crucial for rethinking\nentrepreneurship promotion policies during a crisis, when\npolicy makers are tempted to use self-employment promotion\nas a countercyclical policy. The key contribution of this article\nis to develop this understanding using an empirical basis to\nclarify the correlation and causality relations between self-\nemployment and macroeconomic variables. In particular, we\ninvestigate whether Spanish self-employment influences sub-\nsequent economic performance, as suggested by some recent\nresearch (e.g., Fritsch & Mueller, 2004; Koellinger & Thurik,\nworks claim (e.g., Carmona, Congregado, & Golpe, 2010;\nCongregado, Golpe, & Parker, 2011), and whether empirical\nevidence suggests the reverse effect, that is, business cycle\nfluctuations have a greater effect on self-employment.\nWe analyze these relations using time-series analysis\ntechniques that allow us to distinguish the different causal\nrelations between self-employment and macroeconomic\nperformance.\nFrom an empirical perspective, the available evidence\nsuggests that individual transitions into entrepreneurship are\nmore numerous in booming economies and lower in bad\nones. However, this evidence is usually based on estimates\nof the sign of time dummies in individual-level studies of\noccupational choice, rather than being derived from careful\nanalyses of time-series data.\nTime-series data have been used to determine how multiple\naggregate variables covary over time. However, some stan-\ndard regression analysis techniques can be vulnerable to the\nemergence of \"spurious\" correlations. For this reason, it is cru-\ncial to test the robustness of the empirical results via adequate\neconometric techniques as well as via alternative approaches.\nThe contribution of this article to existing work on the\nrelation between self-employment and business cycles is\ntwofold. First, we apply time-series techniques to more care-\nfully investigate the relation between self-employment and\nbusiness cycles. In particular, we apply these techniques to\nhigh-frequency macrodatabases containing quarterly observa-\ntions, which enables us to draw inferences on the causality of\nthe relation. This ability is important because stimulating\nself-employment is justified only if self-employment causes\nenhanced macroeconomic performance. Second, when inves-\ntigating the relation between self-employment and the busi-\nnesscycle,wedistinguishbetweenemployersandown-account\nworkers. We argue that previous entrepreneurship research\nseems to have overlooked this distinction. Entrepreneurs who\nhire external labor (\"employers\") could exhibit different cycli-\ncal behavior compared with entrepreneurs who work on their\nown (\"own-account entrepreneurs\"). In booming economies,\nentrepreneurs can scale up production and expand employment,\nbidding up wages, thereby drawing relatively low-value own-\naccount entrepreneurs out of entrepreneurship and into paid\nemployment (Lucas, 1978). Furthermore, we might expect\nsome own-account entrepreneurs to start hiring labor (Cowling,\nMitchell, & Taylor, 2004), in which case they switch from own\naccount to employer status. In light of this switching, one might\nexpect the number of employer entrepreneurs to increase rela-\ntive to the number of own-account entrepreneurs, making\ncyclical effects positive for employer entrepreneurs and nega-\ntive for own-account entrepreneurs. Previous studies have\nobviated this distinction. For this reason, previous results can\nbe biased because own-account workers are the more numer-\nous group within self-employment. Our empirical work will\ntake into account this possible source of bias.\nAs mentioned, this article takes a macroeconomic approach\nand focuses as much on the short run as on the long run by\nanalyzing the comovement and the causality between our vari-\nables. The next section describes the data set and methods. We\nbegin with the study of comovement. This analysis involves\ntwo different approaches: the traditional cross-correlations\napproach (Burns & Mitchell, 1946) and the use of Vector\nAutoregression (VAR) forecast errors (den Haan, 2000a). The\ncausality analysis is performed with the analysis of instanta-\nneous and Granger causality. Concluding remarks are given in\nthe last section.\nMethod\nData andTime-Series Properties\nThe data used in this article are a sample of quarterly data on\nnonagricultural2 employment by status --salaried workers\n(W\nt\n) and self-employed workers (S\nt\n)--for Spain, covering\nallow the decomposition of self-employed workers in two\ncomponents: employers (E\nt\n) and own-account workers (O\nt\n).\nFinally, the real GDP and unemployment rate are denoted,\nrespectively, by Y\nt\nand U\nt\n.\nSelf-employment data used in this article are seasonally\nadjusted quarterly Spanish observations drawn from the Labour\nForce Survey (LFS, Spanish National Statistics Institute). In\nthe Spanish LFS, workers are asked questions about their main\njob or business, including, \"Were you an employee or self-\nemployed?\" If self-employed, the respondent is further asked\nwhether they had any employees. The self-employed in Spain\ncan then be classified as incorporated with or without employ-\nees or unincorporated with or without employees.\nFinally, for the remainder of the data used in our empirical\nwork, the real GDP is taken from Quarterly National Account\ndatabase (INE).4 FigureA1 (in the appendix) plots the original\ntime-series data, which is seasonally adjusted, expressed in\nlogs. Time series are detrended using the Hodrick\u00adPrescott\n(HP) filter.5 Figure A1 represents original data and the cycles\nof each variable using this filter.\nMeasuring Comovement\nWithTraditional Statistics\nThis section analyzes comovements between self-employment,\nreal GDP, and unemployment, using the methodology\nCarmona et al. 3\ndeveloped by Burns and Mitchell (1946). This method\nuses the magnitude of the cross-correlation coefficient,\n(j), as a measure of the degree of comovement between\neach pair of series. In particular, the contemporaneous\ncross-correlation coefficient (0)gives information on the\ndegree of contemporaneous comovement, whereas the\ncross-correlation coefficient (j), j  {\u00b1 1, \u00b1 2, \u00b1 3, \u00b1 4},\ngives information on the phase shift of one series relative\nto another (Kydland & Prescott, 1990). The comovement\nbetween each pair of variables is defined as follows: Two\nvariables are said to commove in the same direction over\nthe cycle if the maximum value in absolute terms of the\nestimated correlation coefficient is positive; they are said\nto commove in opposite directions if it is negative, and\nthey are said to not commove if it is close to zero. A large\nnumber in (absolute terms) appearing in column t + i(t \u00ad i)\nindicates that the series lags (leads) the cycle by i quar-\nters. If the variable value of the cross-correlation is\nhighest at i = 0, then the variable is said to move contem-\nporaneously with the cycle. The results are reported in\nTables 1 and 2 reports the correlation between labor time\nseries and output (unemployment). We also report, the cor-\nrelations for the two components of self-employment\n(employers and own-account workers), to test the existence\nof \"potential\" opposite comovements between them over the\ncycle. The critical value for the correlation coefficient--for\nx\nrepresents the standard devia-\ntion of the variable (in percentage terms), \nX\n/\nY\nis the stan-\ndard deviation of each variable as a fraction of output\nreflecting its relative variability, and \nT\nis the first-order\nautocorrelation coefficient, which measures persistence.7\nUsing GDP as a proxy for the business cycle, self-\nemployment and GDP show a peak correlation of .629 at a\nlag of 0. This means that self-employment is procyclical and\nadjusts contemporaneously with the GDP cycle.\nThe results are similar when distinguishing between the\ntwo components of self-employment. The own-account\nworker series shows procyclicality and adjusts contempora-\nneously with the GDP; however, the correlation between the\nGDP and employers peaks at .620 with a lag of one quarter.\nThus, the GDP leads employers.\nTo assess the robustness of these findings to the choice\nof cyclical indicator, Table 2 reports the results of the same\nexercise but uses unemployment in place of the GDP. In\nthis case, the correlation between self-employment and\nunemployment achieves a peak correlation of -.660 at a\nlag of 1, that is, self-employment is countercyclical and\nadjusts with a lag in comparison with unemployment.\nEmployers and own-account workers are also countercy-\nclical with unemployment. Whereas own-account workers\nadjust contemporaneously, unemployment leads employ-\ners. In sum, self-employment in Spain seems to be contem-\nporaneous with the cycle, whereas the business cycle leads\nemployers' cycles.\nMeasuring Comovement\nWithVAR Forecast Errors\nThe previous approach is not the only way to analyze\ncomovements between variables. The comovement between\nreal activity or unemployment and employment series can be\nalso described using the correlation coefficients of forecast\nerrors from vector autoregresive systems at different forecast\nhorizons as proposed in den Haan (2000a). This procedure\nhas advantages over traditional statistics used in the previous\nsection. The previous method focused on only the uncondi-\ntional correlation, losing valuable information about the\ndynamic aspects of the comovements of variables. Moreover,\nas the unconditional correlation coefficient is only defined\nfor stationary variables, the researcher has to transform the\ndata to render it stationary, and there are many ways of doing\nthis--that is, different detrending methods. Finally, this\nmethod is suited for the discussion of short-term, medium-\nterm, and long-term correlations.\nFollowing den Haan (2000a), we are going to calculate\ncorrelation coefficients of forecast errors at different forecast\nhorizons, obtained from estimations of various specifica-\ntions of the following VAR model:\nX t t A X\nt t t\nt\nl\n= + + + +\n=\n\n   \nwhere X\nt\nis the 2 \u00d7 1 vector containing the log of output or\nthe log of unemployment level, and the log of each employ-\nment series,8 , , and are N \u00d7 1 vectors of constants, A\nare\nfixed N \u00d7 N coefficient matrices, \nt\nis an N-dimensional\nwhite noise process that is, E ( \nt\nE ( \nt\n\nt\n' ) = \n\n, and E ( \nt\n\nt\n' ) = 0for s  t, and the total number\nof lags included is equal to l.\nFinally, we define the K-period ahead of the forecast error\nof each variable X\nt\nas follows:\ne X E X\nt K\nX\nt K t t K\n+ + +\nThen, we calculate the correlation between these K-period\nforecast errors and denote it by Corr(K). Note that the use of\nthis approach in a particular horizon of K can be interpreted\nas a cycle-trend decomposition, where the trend component\nis given by E\nt\nX\nt+K\nand the cycle component is given by X\nt+K,t\n.\nTherefore, when we analyze the VAR error forecast error\ncorrelation at different horizons, we are studying the comove-\nment between the different cycle components of each pair of\nvariables. Applying this methodology, we must estimate 10\nbivariate VARs (5 with regard to GDP and 5 with regard to\nunemployment).9\nThe correlation coefficients are plotted in Figure 1. The\nresults confirm those of previous studies using traditional sta-\ntistics. On one hand, as we can see from the figure, the coeffi-\ncients are significantly positive at all horizons in relation with\n4 SAGE Open\nthe GDP and significantly negative at all horizons in the unem-\nployment case. In both cases, the correlation coefficients tend\nto become larger as the forecast horizon increases and then sta-\nbilize, typically at forecast horizons of approximately 2 years.\nCausality\nIf we interpret the presence of cross-correlation between out-\nput (or unemployment) and self-employment, we should\nconclude that unemployment and output transmit their cycles\nto the self-employment cycle. Our objective is now to measure\nthe influence of the business cycle on the self-employment\ncycle or vice versa, using the VAR's parameters. As they are\na transformation of the cross-correlation function, they allow\nus to make inference about two types of causality: (a) Granger\ncausality and (b) instantaneous causality.\nWe start looking for Granger and instantaneous causality.\nTo carry out these causality tests, we need to perform the fol-\nlowing VAR:\nW\nY\nU\nS\nW\nY\nU\nS\nt\nt\nt\nt\nj\nl\nt\nt\nt\nt j\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=\n-\n-\n-\n\n= j\nj\nc + A\n- j\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+ \nt\nwhere A\nj\nis the matrix of coefficients, c is a vector of deter-\nministic terms, and \nt\nis the vector of innovations. At this\npoint, we are interested in the lag length selection of the\nVAR. To determine the optimal number of lags, we estimate\nan unrestricted VAR using the data in levels and then choose\nthe appropriate lag length using the Akaike, Schwarz, and\nHannan-Quinn information criteria. The lag length was set to\n2 on the basis of Hannan-Quinn's and Schwartz's informa-\ntion criteria for a multivariate system (see Table A1 in the\nappendix).\nOne could argue that it would be interesting to study\nwhether the variable responds immediately to shocks in other\nvariables. To this end, we will use the concept of instanta-\nneous causality. The instantaneous causality concept refers to\nthe possible instantaneous correlation between the cyclical\ncomponents of various variables. Roughly speaking, a vari-\nable x\nt\nis said to be instantaneously causal for another time-\nseries variable z\nt\nif knowing the value of x\nt\nin the forecast\nperiod helps to improve the forecasts of z\nt\n. In sum, if the inno-\nvation to z\nt\nand the innovation to x\nt\nare correlated, then there\nis instantaneous causality.10 The results of the instantaneous\ncausality tests are reported in Table 3. For self-employment\nand own-account workers (but not the employers), our esti-\nmates show an instantaneous causality with the GDP and\nunemployment. However, the finding of instantaneous cor-\nrelation between two time series implies that causality can go\nTable 2.

Applying this concept to our case\nstudy suggests that the cyclical component of GDP, unem-\nployment, or paid employment does not cause, in a Granger\nsense, the self-employment (employers or own-account\nworkers) cycle, if lagged cyclical components of GDP,\nunemployment, or paid employment are not significant in the\nVAR equation corresponding to cyclical self-employment. In\nsum, testing for Granger causality between, for example, X\nand Z consists of checking the significance of the coefficient\nin the corresponding VAR equation. In other words, X does\nnot Granger-cause Z if the vector has no forecasting power.\nEach equation represented is estimated separately in testing\nfor Granger causality, and the null hypothesis tested is \"X\ndoes not Granger-cause Z, and Z does not Granger-cause\nX.\"11 The results of the Granger causality test are reported in\nTable 3. Each element of the table shows the Granger causal-\nity test p value from column to row. The results confirm the\nexistence of a bidirectional causality between self-employment\nand unemployment, whereas the GDP causes self-employment.\nThese results are consistent with some prior evidence of bidi-\nrectionality between self-employment and unemployment\nrates (Faria, Cuestas, & Gil-Alana, 2009; Faria, Cuestas, &\nHowever, if we consider the two self-employment compo-\nnents separately, the results are slightly different: on one hand,\nthe employers'cycle is Granger-caused by the rest of the cycles,\nbut the business cycle is not Granger-caused by the employers;\non the other hand, the own-account workers cycle is caused\nonly by unemployment and paid employment. Finally, the\nemployers' cycle is Granger-caused by own-account workers.\nIn sum, causality results reveal that the labor market situation\nhelps to forecast own-account workers, whereas the business\ncycle phase (GDP or unemployment) contains valuable infor-\nmation for predicting today's employers. Moreover, the results\npoint to the existence of a bidirectional causality between\nemployers and paid employment. Finally, employers appear\nto adjust immediately in response only to shocks to the wage\nearners, whereas own-account workers seem to respond\nimmediately to shocks to unemployment and the GDP.\nDiscussion\nThe objective of this article was to shed light on the interplay\nof entrepreneurship and the business cycle, providing new\nempirical evidence on the development of self-employment\nover the business cycle to understand what may be expected of\npublic schemes encouraging people to become self-employed\nin terms of scope and effectiveness. These public schemes are\na very highly contested policy issue because entrepreneurship\nis considered to be a way to combat the current recession.\nOur results identified a procyclical relationship with output\nand unemployment driving cycles in self-employment cycles.\nHowever, when we relaxed the assumption of common rela-\ntionships between the two self-employment components, a\ndifferent picture emerged. In particular, the own-account\nworkers cycle is driven by the labor market situation, whereas\nemployers'cycle is driven by the business cycle phase and the\nlabor market situation.\nFrom our results, one could argue that the added value of pro-\nmoting entrepreneurship is given only in terms of job creation\nbecauseitdoesnotcontributetoeconomicrecovery.Furthermore,\nthe promotion's effects are different for the different types of\nself-employment. On one hand, the promotion of own-account\nworkers only leads to changes in employers'cycles, whereas on\nthe other hand, the promotion of job creators (employers) con-\ntributes directly to job creation and reduces unemployment.\nIn sum, entrepreneurship policies will only have effects\non unemployment. However, it should be considered as use-\nful alternatives of active labor market policies.\nSome tentative policy recommendations can be advanced\non the basis of our results. Countercyclical policies that\nboost self-employment during economic downturns might\nbe a good complement to other active labor market policies\nfor combating unemployment, but positive effects on output\ngrowth should not be expected. Only a promotion aimed at\nemployers could contribute to reduce unemployment; there\nwould be no effect on job creation if the promotion is only\ntargeted at the most numerous group of self-employed: the\nown-account workers.\nGDP\nCorrelation coefficients\nForecast horizon (quarters)\nUnemployment\nCorrelation coefficients\nForecast horizon (quarters)\nFigure 1.
