Web-\nbased questionnaires are easy to administer and offer several\nadvantages, including immediate checks for incomplete or\nimplausible answers, reminder messages to the respondent,\nautomatic summarization of answers, personalized feedback,\ninclusion of illustrations or sounds to clarify complex ques-\ntions, and hiding nonrelevant follow-up questions. Web ques-\ntionnaires require no expense for printing, postage, manual\ncheck of incomplete answers, and transfer of data to an\nelectronic format. The major cost for Web questionnaires is\ndevelopment of the system for handling the questionnaires;\nthus, once the system is established, the extra cost to add a\nfew thousand or even a few hundred thousand participants to\nthe study is relatively small.\nHowever, access to the Internet can be biased with\nregard to age, sex, and education, among other factors. This\ndifferential access has restricted the use of Web-based meth-\nods to studies in specific groups with access to Internet, such\nas university students,1 employees at certain companies,2 or\nknown Internet users.3,4 Also, substantial proportion of the\ngeneral population is unfamiliar with Web questionnaires and\nmight hesitate to answer a Web questionnaire due to lack of\nexperience or worries about security issues. However, these\nobstacles are likely to diminish over time. We explored\nresponse rates and compliance in a population-based study in\nSweden, in which Internet access is estimated to be 80% in\nthe working population.\nMETHODS\nStudy Population and Design\nThe study base comprised all persons 20 to 59 years of\nage living in a middle-sized county in Sweden in 2002. The\ncounty has the same distribution of inhabitants living in city\n(80%) and rural areas (20%) as the average in Sweden. We\nrandomly selected 875 eligible persons from the Swedish\nPopulation Registry. Participation required filling out a ques-\ntionnaire and undergoing several 24-hour recall interviews\nabout physical activity. There were 3 versions of the ques-\ntionnaire: (1) traditional printed questionnaire, (2) regular\nWeb questionnaire, and (3) interactive Web questionnaire\nwith personalized feedback.\nThe eligible sample was assigned randomly at the\noutset to one of the 3 versions of the questionnaires. All were\nsent an invitation letter informing them about the study. After\n2 weeks, one third of the group was sent a printed question-\nnaire and two thirds were sent a letter with information on\nhow to access the Web questionnaire, including details on use\nof the Web browser, the URL to our Web questionnaire, and\nan individual username. In addition, half of the Web group\n(one third of the total) was given the option of personalized\nfeedback about their energy expenditure and body mass\nindex. All nonrespondents were reminded after 3 weeks by a\nletter and contacted by phone after an additional 3 weeks, if\nnecessary.\nThe questionnaire was divided into 2 parts. The first\npart was a general survey of lifestyle factors, such as physical\nactivity, weight, height, smoking, and education, as well as\nthe respondent's Internet habits. On the last page of this\nsection, respondents were asked if they would be willing to\nanswer additional questions about diet. Web respondents\nanswering \"yes\" were linked to the second part of the ques-\ntionnaire, whereas respondents to the printed questionnaire\nwere sent the dietary questionnaire by returning mail. Per-\nsonalized feedback was given to the interactive group on their\nintake of fiber, calcium, vitamin C, iron, and the composition\nof lunch and dinner meals. All basic questionnaires were\nfollowed by a validation study on physical activity.\nThe ethical committee at the Karolinska Institutet ap-\nproved the study. Answering the questionnaire was consid-\nered to be informed consent.\nTechnical Aspects of the Web Questionnaire\nWe collaborated with a commercial Swedish Web sur-\nvey company (Netsurvey2), which developed software to\nmeet our requirements with respect to layout, feedback, and\ninteractivity. An individual username for login provided the\nsame identification in the Web questionnaires as in the\nprinted questionnaires. This username prevented multiple\nanswers from the same respondent or answers from individ-\nuals other than the invited respondents and allowed us to\ndirect reminders to the nonrespondents only. The respondent\nused the username to establish an encrypted connection,\nusing Secure Socket Layer, with the Web questionnaire\nsystem at Netsurvey. The username was linked to a unique\nnumber that identified the person and the study. The ques-\ntionnaire answers were stored at Netsurvey along with the\nunique identification number.\nTo minimize typing errors by the respondent, the sys-\ntem immediately checked for implausible answers (eg. letters\ninstead of numbers, unrealistic weight or height, or missing\nanswers). When the system discovered an error, the respon-\ndent was given the chance to change the answer before\nmoving on to the next page.\nRESULTS\nAmong the subjects given the printed questionnaire, the\nresponse rate for the general section was 64% (Table 1).\nResponse rates for the groups using Web-based question-\nnaires were 51% for the questionnaire without feedback and\n50% with feedback. Additional details regarding response\nrates can be found in a supplementary table, available with\nthe electronic version of this article.\n  (willingness to answer the second part of\nthe questionnaire) was higher for the Web questionnaires than\nfor the printed questionnaire. Fifty-three percent of those who\ncompleted the general section of the paper questionnaire went\non to complete the dietary part, compared with 58% of those\nresponding to the Web questionnaire and 64% of those who\nwere given the interactive Web questionnaire. Thus, the total\nresponse rate for the dietary questionnaire was similar for the\nThere were no differences in response to the 3 ques-\ntionnaire options by age, body mass index, and current\nsmoking, and only small differences by sex, education, and\nfood habits (Table 2). The self-reported time spent answering\nthe questionnaires did not differ between the groups. In\ngeneral, those responding to the Web questionnaires were\nalso more frequent users of the Internet and more able to\narrange for privacy when using the Internet, assuring that no\none was watching the screen.\nDISCUSSION\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first popula-\ntion-based study comparing the use of Web questionnaires\nwith a similar printed questionnaire. Half of the people\ninvited to use the Web questionnaire completed the general\nsection of questionnaire. The willingness to answer a second\npart of the questionnaire was higher with the Web question-\nnaire than with the printed questionnaire, which suggests that\nthose that responding to the Web questionnaire found the\nprocess more appealing than those who responded to the\nmailed questionnaire.\nWeb questionnaires can be used for research purposes\nin population-based settings in which Internet access is high,\nalthough we found that the initial response rate was lower\nthan for the traditional printed questionnaire. In comparison,\nthe willingness to answer a second questionnaire was higher\nTABLE 1.
