This innovation involved our participants in contributing to cross-\ncultural comparison and also brought taken-for-granted assumptions in each setting into sharp relief, as well as sensitising\nus to issues that proved important in analysing our data.

Cross-national collabora-\ntive research is now common in Europe, a product of\nEuropean funding, but it is far rarer to find qualitative, cross-\ncultural studies of societies that are geographically and cul-\nturally more distant from each other. Moreover, texts dealing\nwith cross-cultural qualitative fieldwork are generally based\non the premise of a researcher from one culture (usually from\nrich countries or the global north) working in `other'cultures\nissues of cultural knowledge and sensitivity. Where collabo-\nration is mentioned, it is generally in terms of outsiders\nworking with local communities or local researchers (Cleary,\n2013). Our study was not of this kind. We worked as an equal\npartnership between two principal investigators, one Hong\nKong Chinese (Sik Ying Ho) and the other White British\n(Stevi Jackson) and with the intention of comparing the lives\nA tale of two societies: The doing of\nqualitative comparative research\nin Hong Kong and Britain\nStevi Jackson1, Petula Sik Ying Ho2 and Jin Nye Na3\n Keywords\nQualitative methods, comparative qualitative research, cross-national collaboration, vignette, translation\n1Centre for Women's Studies, University of York, York, UK\n2Department of Social Work & Social Administration, The University of\nHong Kong, Hong Kong\n3Abertay University, Dundee, UK\nCorresponding author:\nPetula Sik Ying Ho, Department of Social Work & Social Administration,\nThe University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam Road, Hong Kong.\nEmail: psyho@hku.hk\nOriginal Article\n2 Methodological Innovations\nof Hong Kong Chinese and White British women, the major-\nity ethnicities in the two locations.1\nAs Ryan-Flood and Gill (2010) note, research `inevitably\npresents dilemmas, challenges and choices, which are not\nalways explicated in writing up' (p. 2), when the messiness\nand unpredictability of the process is often glossed over. Yet,\nthis very unpredictability can also, as we will show, create\nopportunities for methodological innovation as well as unan-\nticipated insights into the lives of those we research. In this\narticle, we seek to make transparent some of the problems\nand opportunities arising from working together as cross-\nnational collaborators, following the reflexive practice now\ncharacteristic of feminist research (Letherby, 2003; Ryan-\nFlood and Gill, 2010). After briefly introducing the aims of\nour project, we will discuss the methods we used, focusing\non the ways in which the differing socio-economic and cul-\ntural contexts in which we worked affected the recruitment\nof participants and the conduct of in-depth interviews and\nfocus groups. We highlight a methodological innovation we\ndeveloped by chance and deployed in the focus groups,\n`cross-cultural data feedback'. This method, we argue, has\nthe virtue of bringing cultural similarities and differences\ninto sharp relief as well as enabling participants themselves\nto be actively engaged in making cross-cultural comparisons.\nIt also has the potential to be further developed in new\nresearch contexts. We also address some of the issues\ninvolved in analysing our data, making sense of it in the light\nof linguistic and cultural differences and in relation to condi-\ntions of life in the two locations.\nIn the beginning: conceptualising and\nplanning our collaboration\nOur study was framed as an exploration of the impact of\nsocial change on women's personal lives and relationships,\nfunded by an Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)\nHong Kong bilateral award.2 The impetus for this study was,\nin part, a product of the rare opportunity afforded by this\nbilateral scheme to apply for funding for cross-national\nresearch. But we were not just opportunistic, we also had a\ngenuine intellectual interest in refocusing academic debates\nbeyond the parochially Western. While small in scale, we set\nout to address major sociological issues; in particular, we\nsought to challenge the Eurocentrism of debates on intimacy\nand modernity.\nMainstream sociological propositions on the transforma-\ntion of intimacy (Giddens, 1992) and the process of individu-\nalization (Beck and Beck-Gernsheim, 2002) have come\nunder extensive criticism in terms of their assumptions about\ngender, sexuality and family relationships and the evidence\nbase for their propositions (e.g. Heaphy, 2007; Jamieson,\nremained focused on Western contexts; Jamieson's (2011)\nconceptualisation of practices of intimacy is a notable \u00ad and\nwelcome \u00ad exception. More generally, the theorisation of\nmodernity has been marked by its Western bias, and attempts\nto remedy this have been found wanting (see Bhambra, 2007,\n2014). Even those Asian scholars who have challenged uni-\nversalising characterisations of modernity, such as Yan\nof the Western sociological narrative of the origins of moder-\nnity (Jackson, 2015). While seeking to unsettle Eurocentrism,\nour project was, paradoxically, developed as a response to\ndebates that are Eurocentric in origin. This is perhaps inevi-\ntable if the aim is to bring the terms of these debates into\nquestion.\nHong Kong and the United Kingdom may seem strange\nsites for comparison as one is a nation and the other is a\nSpecial Administrative Region of China,3 and neither can be\nconsidered representative of their geographical region\n(Europe or East Asia). Although this particular comparative\ncase may be very specific, the historical relationship\nbetween the United Kingdom and Hong Kong, as coloniser\nand colonised, makes it of particular interest. Both are now\npart of the rich, post-industrial global North, but British\ncolonialism has left its mark. The particular niche Hong\nKong occupied in the British Empire was associated with a\nneglect of the local population.4 Up to the 1970s, Hong\nKong was characterised by `third world' levels of poverty\nand, while it is now richer than the United Kingdom in terms\nof gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, the policies of\nboth the colonial and current administrations have resulted\nin a lack of welfare provision and a huge gulf between the\nrich and poor (Goodstadt, 2013), forcing its inhabitants into\nself-reliance in a climate of economic uncertainty. This has\nhad consequences for gendered divisions of labour and\npractices of intimacy (see, for example, Lee, 2003). We saw\na comparison between women's lives in these two contexts\nas offering us an opportunity to think about the gendered\nconsequences of social change in terms of the intersections\nbetween local and global inequalities.\nWhile addressing major sociological issues, the funding\navailable meant that our study would have to be modest in its\nscope.5 We planned at the outset to interview 12 pairs of\nyoung adult women and their mothers in each of the two\nlocations (48 individuals), using the two generations of\nwomen as a proxy for change over time, and subsequently\nconducted focus groups with some of the young women.\nFrom the beginning, we recognised the importance of a sym-\nmetrical approach to avoid taking one location as the base-\nline against which the other was assessed \u00ad in particular\ntreating Britain as the norm and Hong Kong as `other'. We\ntherefore planned to pose the same research questions and\nuse the same research instruments in both contexts while\nbeing sensitive to the particularities of local social conditions\nand cultural practices. To maximise the comparability of our\nsamples, we defined the characteristics of our desired partici-\npants to ensure as good a match as possible between the\nBritish and Hong Kong women to be interviewed. We sought\nyoung women who were adult but below the average age of\nJackson et al. 3\nmarriage in both locations and set the age limits as between\n20 and 26years. Since we were interested in exploring issues\nraised by debates around transformations of intimacy and\nindividualisation, we decided to recruit young women with\nuniversity level education, those who would have a greater\ndegree of choice in their styles of life than the less education-\nally privileged. We assumed that their mothers would have\nmore diverse backgrounds. Finally, because of the complex-\nity of comparing two locations and two generations, we\nagreed that each sample should be culturally homogenous,\nrecruiting from the majority ethnic group in each place:\nChinese, Cantonese speaking-speaking Hong Kong women\nand White British women.\nThe interview guide we prepared at the outset was devel-\noped by the two principal investigators (PIs) in face-to-face\nmeetings. It followed a life history format to lead participants\nthrough the stages of their lives from childhood into adulthood\nand, for the older women, marriage and parenthood, with a\nfocus on interpersonal relationships. We planned to phrase\nquestions to elicit narrative responses, encouraging women to\ntell us about their lives and experiences, but we also built in a\nseries of prompts to ensure we covered similar ground if infor-\nmation we wanted did not emerge spontaneously, for example,\nasking about who lived with them at a given time or about rela-\ntionships with particular others. Towards the end of the inter-\nviews, we added a few more direct questions to explore\nwomen's understanding of the social changes they had lived\nthrough and also deployed vignettes to explore issues that\nmight be difficult to address by other means. The guide was\ndesigned, as is usual in qualitative research, to be flexible ena-\nbling us to adapt to women's specific circumstances and to\nvary questions in response to issues they raised, some of which\nwe expected to be culturally specific.\nIn designing both the guide and specific prompts, we\nwere, of course, aware that the flexibility of qualitative inter-\nviewing means that no two interviews follow exactly the\nsame path, that interviews are interactional events and what\ngoes on within them depends on a variety of situational ele-\nments. This potential variability is increased in collaborative\nresearch where more than one person is interviewing since\neach researcher's conversational style is likely to affect their\ninteraction with participants. Additional issues arise in a\nstudy such as ours, where different members of the team\nwere conducting interviews thousands of miles apart in dif-\nferent languages and different socio-cultural settings. There\nis a delicate balance to be achieved in trying to ensure com-\nparability of data while being sensitive to issues of eliciting\nit where differing cultural sensibilities are at stake. The cost\nand practicality of travelling between Hong Kong and the\nUnited Kingdom, and therefore the limited opportunities we\nhad for face-to-face meetings, exacerbated the challenges\nthat geographical distance posed. Once fieldwork began, we\nwere effectively working in parallel in recruiting and inter-\nviewing participants. While we kept in contact and discussed\nprogress through electronic media as we went along, each\nteam lacked detailed knowledge of the ways in which local\nconditions were affecting the research practices of the other.\nThese factors did not become apparent to us until the full\nteam met face-to-face 6months into the fieldwork and about\nhalfway through the interviewing, which was also when the\nfirst focus group was held.6\nParallel fieldwork, divergent practices:\nrecruitment and the conduct of\ninterviewing\nSince we were recruiting a purposive sample with specific\nage and educational requirements, and needed both the\ndaughters and mothers to agree to take part, finding partici-\npants was not straightforward.7 We were eventually able to\ninterview 14 young Hong Kong women and 12 of their moth-\nindividuals in total). The additional young women were\nthose whose mothers had originally agreed to be interviewed\nbut who subsequently dropped out, meaning that we had to\nseek additional participants to meet our target of 12 mother\u00ad\ndaughter pairs in each location. We employed two recruit-\nment strategies: advertising for participants with the\nappropriate characteristics and seeking them through our\npersonal networks.8 The way this was accomplished differed\nin the two locations and impacted on the process of inter-\nviewing and, consequently, the data generated.\nIn Britain, most participants were recruited through\nadvertising in two university towns, one in Northern England\nand one in the South. Personal networks \u00ad referrals from col-\nleagues \u00ad resulted in the recruitment of four of the pairs. We\nhad expected that most of the first contacts would be with the\nyoung women who would then approach their mothers; in\nthe event, as many mothers as daughters were our first point\nof contact. In Hong Kong, on the other hand, all participants\nwere recruited through personal networks. There were good\ncultural reasons for this: in East Asian societies, recruiting\nthrough personal networks works far better than any other\nmethod. It fits `somewhat more naturally with Confucian\nmores and expectations than attempting to recruit unknown\nindividuals who lie outside networks' (Park and Lunt, 2015:\nn.p.). It is thus difficult to induce people to participate in\nqualitative research and to build rapport unless they are\nintroduced through a known and trusted intermediary; in\nChinese societies, this is related to the importance of per-\nsonal connections, guanxi (see, for example, Liu, 2007). A\nfew of the families were already known to Sik Ying. Other\npotential participants were recruited through introductions to\nyoung women from graduate students and staff in Hong\nKong Universities. Once the young women agreed to be\ninterviewed, they approached their mothers who then met\nSik Ying in a social context to gain the degree of trust neces-\nsary for the interview to proceed.\nIn the British case, even where personal contacts had\nbeen used, the interviewer was unknown to the participants.\n4 Methodological Innovations\nThe personal contacts were made through Stevi's networks,\nwhile most of the interviews were conducted by Jin Nye.\nThe British women, once recruited, were quite happy to\nspend a few hours discussing their lives with a total stranger,\nwhich is not unusual in interviewing in Western contexts.\nFor Sik Ying, on the other hand, it was necessary to devote\nconsiderable time to building relationships with the older\nwomen; she spent extended periods interviewing them and\noften became involved in their lives. The British interviews,\nhowever, were generally concluded within 2\nhours and did\nnot lead to ongoing relationships with participants. Because\nof these differences, Jin Nye was able to keep more closely\nto the agreed `script' of the interview guide than was possi-\nble for Sik Ying.\nThe original intention had been to interview mothers and\ndaughters separately. This was entirely feasible in Britain\nas most daughters had separate residences from their moth-\ners; in the few cases where they lived together, there was\nsufficient privacy to conduct separate interviews in partici-\npants' homes. In Hong Kong, this was rarely possible. In\nthe first place, the young Hong Kong women all lived with\ntheir mothers. They could easily be interviewed separately\naway from their homes, but once mothers were introduced\nit would have been culturally very difficult, and indeed\nimpolite, to separate them from their daughters to interview\nthem and may have made them uncomfortable. Moreover,\nHong Kong apartments are very small, affording little pri-\nvacy for separate interviews within domestic space. This\nwas only possible in a few cases when a research assistant\nwas able to work with Sik Ying conducting parallel inter-\nviews and where it became, in the context, socially appro-\npriate and practically feasible to negotiate separate\ninterviewing. The lack of individual interviews does, of\ncourse, raise questions about issues that the older women\nmay have been unwilling to discuss in their daughters'pres-\nence and therefore about the comparability of some of our\ndata. Moreover, since these were conversational interviews\ntaking place within domestic space, if daughters were pre-\nsent they became actively involved in their mothers' inter-\nviews. There were, however, benefits to this situation, since\ninteractions between mothers and daughters were often\nrevealing. For example, Sik Ying was able to record an\naltercation between Gabby and her mother, Ms Au,9 about\nthe reasons for the latter's failure to offer her any informa-\ntion about sex. Ms Au said that she did not find it necessary\nto discuss sex and contraception with her daughters as she\nassumed that they would have learned it at schools and\nthrough the Internet, but Gabby disagreed:\nGabby:\nSchools would only teach you about menstruation but\nnothing deeper for example, premarital sex, I'd want to\nknow more and ask you (mother) about that.\nMs Au: You can always go look up the Internet!\nGabby:\nGoing on Internet is not the same as hearing your\nthoughts and opinion!\nMs Au:\nHow come such a highly educated person like you\nwould not even go look up these things on the Internet?\nYou should know better!\nSuch interchanges are very revealing of the dynamics of\nmother\u00addaughter interaction on potentially difficult issues,\nbut we do not have data of this kind from the British women.\nA solution to lack of comparability of data that these differ-\nent interviewing strategies produced might have been to\ninterview British mothers and daughters together, but this\nwas not feasible. Not only were we unaware of this differ-\nence in our interviewing practices until we were halfway\nthrough the process, but there would have also been practical\ndifficulties in conducting joint interviews in Britain. The\nBritish mothers and daughters often lived considerable dis-\ntances apart, so that Jin Nye was travelling all over England\nand Wales to conduct interviews. It would therefore have\nbeen difficult and expensive to arrange joint interviews, even\nhad we realised what was happening soon enough to change\nour original plans.\nIn retrospect, we can see that what was happening was\nthat each set of interviews was proceeding on the basis of\nlocal, taken-for-granted practices. As far as each of us was\nconcerned, we were following the agreed interview guide\nand gathering the data we needed \u00ad and we did, despite our\ndifferences, produce meaningful data, albeit under different\nconditions. While we were unaware, for a time, of the extent\nof the divergence in our approaches to interviewing, we did\nanticipate from the outset differences in data generation aris-\ning from idiosyncrasies in personal interviewing styles and\nthe specificities of local social and cultural contexts. The\nvignettes we introduced at the end of the interviews were\ndesigned, in part, to introduce a degree of standardisation.\nEven standardised research methods, however, may not work\nin the same way in two places and this may tell us something\nabout adapting interviewing techniques to differing cultural\nUsing vignettes\nVignettes, fictional scenarios that usually feature a problem\nor dilemma facing an imaginary protagonist, have been used\nin social research since the 1980s. They are designed to draw\nparticipants into considering what someone would or should\ndo in the situation depicted. Instead of asking about attitudes\nor beliefs in the abstract, vignettes supply contextual infor-\nmation in the recognition that `meanings are social and\nThey are also useful in asking about sensitive issues, ena-\nbling participants to talk about an imaginary person and situ-\nation rather than their own lives. This was one reason that we\ndecided to use them to explore issues of unplanned preg-\nnancy and lesbianism, which could be difficult issues for\nsome women, especially those from Hong Kong, to discuss\nmore directly. We kept our vignettes simple, confined to a\nJackson et al. 5\nsingle set of circumstances combined with an open question.\nOur vignettes ran as follows:\nThe unplanned pregnancy vignette: `Kate is a single woman in\nher early 20s. She has a boyfriend and is embarking on a\npromising career. Kate finds that she is pregnant'.\nWhat are her options and what would you advise her to do?\nThe coming out vignette: `Claire is a 22year old lesbian who has\nnever come out to her mother. She decides the time is right to do\nso because she has fallen in love and wants to introduce her\ngirlfriend to her mother'.\nHow do you think her mother would feel about this?\nWe had anticipated that Hong Kong and British women\nwould have different opinions on these issues, which was the\ncase. We have discussed this elsewhere (Jackson and Ho,\n2014). What was less expected was a marked difference in\nhow each group of women responded. We hoped, and\nexpected, that the open-ended framing of the questions\naccompanying our vignettes would prompt considerable dis-\ncussion of the issues they raised. The Hong Kong women,\nhowever, gave very brief, cut and dried responses. For exam-\nple, commenting on the `unplanned pregnancy' vignette Ms\nLee said that if her daughter were pregnant she would\nencourage marriage: `if she loves the baby's father there's no\npoint in getting an abortion'. The lesbian vignette prompted\nsimilarly minimal and often condemnatory statements. Elsie,\nfor example, said, `I would want her to have a normal mar-\nried life rather than an abnormal relationship'. The only\nHong Kong woman who gave a fuller account was a mother\nwho had faced just that situation and told of the struggle she\nhad to accept it.11 The British women, on the other hand,\nengaged in extended discussions of each scenario in which\nthey weighed up possible alternatives and elaborated on their\nown views of issues at stake. Here, for example, are extracts\nfrom Susan's very lengthy and considered reflections on the\nunplanned pregnancy vignette:\nWell, her options are to have the baby, to have an abortion, um,\nto um, if you're having the baby you'd have to consider what\nchildcare arrangements you were going to be making, is the\npartner committed to a long term relationship with Kate and the\nbaby, those are all factors that have to be taken into account.\nWhat sort of rights she has within her career if any, if she's\nalready got maternity rights [...] she'd have to talk with her\npartner and try and establish what his commitment to the baby\nwas, then think about what she really wanted herself because it's\na decision that will affect the rest of her life no matter which way\nshe takes it. [...] I think you just have to say well, other people\nthat love you will support you whatever decision you make, but\nonly you can make that decision. (Susan, British mother)\nGenerally, the British responses would be seen as pro-\nducing `richer' data and the brevity of the Hong Kong\nresponses would be seen as disappointing. These differ-\nences, however, might be telling us something. We do not\nthink that vignettes are inappropriate to Asian contexts as\nothers have used them successfully on a range of issues\ncence on issues concerning sexuality is particular to Hong\nKong women but this is unlikely as they did discuss some\nrelated moral issues both in interviews and the focus group\nwe conducted with the young women (see Jackson and Ho,\n2014).12 The difference could also be simply a chance effect\nof different interviewing styles. The vignettes were pre-\nsented verbally in the course of the interviews rather than\nbeing written on cards. The issue of how they should be\nrendered in Cantonese was not discussed in advance, so it is\npossible that translation issues may have exacerbated any\ndifference in approaches to interviewing. It was only when\nwe came to analysing our data that we gave translation the\nattention it deserved.13\nHaving discussed these issues among ourselves, and tak-\ning account of what our data has revealed about the lives of\nour two samples, the most plausible explanation for the dif-\nfering responses to the vignettes is what we have elsewhere\nidentified as the pragmatism of Hong Kong women, arising\nfrom the material conditions of their lives (Jackson et al.,\n2013). In the case of the unplanned pregnancy, the issue was\ncut and dried to them because the options are limited and\nthese limitations are related to the wider social context. The\nBritish women, however, were able to engage in lengthy con-\nsidered weighing up of possibilities because there are more\nchoices realistically open to young British women in Britain\nthan in Hong Kong. In the case of an unplanned pregnancy,\nfor example, British women have better employment rights,\nthere is a greater acceptance of single motherhood and\ncohabitation as well as more social support for single moth-\ners. In Hong Kong, the only realistic choices are to marry or\nhave an abortion. For the Hong Kong women we inter-\nviewed, there was simply nothing else to be said. Responses\nto the coming out scenario may also reflect pragmatic atti-\ntudes since life for lesbians and gay men is much tougher in\nHong Kong than the United Kingdom (Kong, 2011; Tang,\n2013) and those lives remain largely hidden from the major-\nity of the population. Thus, not only would Hong Kong\nwomen, particularly the mothers, see departure from the het-\nerosexual norm as extremely difficult to deal with and threat-\nening to the material well-being of families, but they had few\nexperience of known lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender\n(LGBT) people to draw on in responding to the scenario with\nwhich they were presented. The only exception was the one\nHong Kong with an acknowledged lesbian daughter.\nThe situation for the British sample was different. They\ninhabited a social milieu where sexual diversity had become,\nin recent decades, much more widely accepted \u00ad a trend that\nsome of the British women mentioned in their responses.\nMany referred to known lesbian and gay relatives, friends\nand acquaintances. Even the one British mother with very\n6 Methodological Innovations\nnegative attitudes to lesbianism and homosexuality, Patricia,\nwas able to draw on personal experiences of a gay cousin and\na friend with a lesbian daughter to modify her initial response.\nWhereas she began by saying that the mother would be\n`utterly devastated' by finding that her daughter was a les-\nbian, she moved on to imagining her coming to terms with it.\nWhereas Patricia could refer to knowledge of her own social\ncircle in making sense of the vignette, despite her conserva-\ntive attitudes, most of the Hong Kong mothers had no such\nknowledge or experience.\nResponses to the `coming out' vignette differed in another\nrespect. Whereas the Hong Kong women focused only on the\nissue of coping with a lesbian daughter, many of the British\nwomen of both generations noticed a particular (and deliberate)\nfeature of the vignette \u00ad the relatively late age of coming out \u00ad\nand tended to see this as problematic, indicating a strained rela-\ntionship or a prejudiced mother. Some also suggested that the\nmother would be hurt by the daughter's past failure to confide\nin her. For example, Lucy, one of the young British women,\nopened her response to the vignette by saying `If I was her\nmother, I'd be really upset that my daughter hadn't felt she\ncould come to me with something that affects her life so much'.\nEven when the British women did not mention the age at com-\ning out spontaneously, the ways in which they discussed the\nissue then enabled Jin Nye to follow up with simple questions\nsuch as `how about her age?' This prompted further thoughts\non why the daughter had not come out to her mother earlier.\nThe responses given by the Hong Kong women, on the other\nhand, worked to close off further discussion, making it difficult\nfor Sik Ying to probe further without disrupting the rapport she\nhad devoted so much time to fostering. This shutting down of\nthe topic may reflect the concern about `face'(mianzi) and fam-\nily reputation, which are still of paramount importance in Hong\nKong. Closing off options (in relation to both vignettes) could\nthus have been a way of showing disapproval or possibly fear\nof confronting the possibility of ever having to deal with such a\nsituation. Crucially, the differing ways women dealt with the\nvignettes, we suggest, may reveal something about the social\ncontext of their lives.\nCross-cultural data feedback: the focus\ngroup experience\nThe interviews were initially expected to be our only means\nof generating data and it was only when we were halfway\nthrough the interviews that we decided to conduct two focus\ngroups with the young women, one in each location. The first\nof these took place during a 6-day research team meeting in\nHong Kong. Sik Ying had organised this in advance of the\nStevi's and Jin Nye's arrival, thinking that it would be useful\nfor the British researchers to have a first-hand `feel' for the\nlives of Hong Kong women. Unlike the Hong Kong inter-\nviews, which were conducted in Cantonese, the focus group\ndiscussion took place in English \u00ad in which all the young\nwomen, typically for those who are University educated,\nwere fluent. All three of us were present. Participants\nincluded the young Hong Kong women who had already\nbeen interviewed and a few we planned to interview later.\nSome of them brought friends along, which resulted in a\nrather larger group than had been anticipated but led to the\ngeneration of interesting new data.\nIn keeping with our commitment to operationalising sym-\nmetrical methods in the two locations, we subsequently con-\nducted a similar focus group in Britain. Like the Hong Kong\nfocus group, the British one involved some of the daughters\nfrom the sample and a few other young women of similar ages\nand backgrounds \u00ad but for different reasons. In Britain, this\noccurred because of the impracticability of bringing together a\ngeographically dispersed group, and we therefore invited the\nyoung women local to us and recruited additional members.\nIn the focus groups, we experimented with a new tech-\nnique, which proved to be very fruitful: discussing some of\nour emergent findings, illustrated with data, from the other\nlocation, enabling Hong Kong women to comment on\nBritish women's accounts and vice versa. We are calling\nthis, for want of a better term `cross-cultural data feedback'.\nThis came about almost by chance. Stevi and Jin Nye had\nbrought transcripts of the British interviews with them to\nHong Kong and we all thought it would be interesting to\nhave the young Hong Kong women comment on some of the\naccounts of their British contemporaries. Having done this\nsuccessfully in Hong Kong, we then made data from the\nHong Kong focus group available to the British one. The\neffect of this process was to involve our participants in the\nprocess of making cross-cultural comparisons. Not only did\nit provoke lively discussion and interesting insights into per-\nceptions of cultural differences and similarities, but it also\nbrought into the open everyday assumptions about `the way\nthings are' in each setting that would otherwise not have\nbeen made explicit and issues that might not otherwise have\nemerged.14 It also alerted us to subjects we might explore\nmore fully in the interviews we had yet to conduct. Two of\nthe issues thus brought into sharp relief were modes of dis-\nciplining children and the regulation and monitoring of\nyoung women's sexual conduct.\nA strong theme that had emerged in the Hong Kong inter-\nview data was the use of severe and systematic physical pun-\nishment to discipline children. This was not an issue that had\nfeatured much in our British interviews. When it was men-\ntioned at all, by either mothers or daughters, it was to refer to\nthe slapping of children as a very occasional, exceptional and\nregrettable occurrence. In the Hong Kong focus group, the\nissue of punishment was raised again. The consensus among\nthe young Hong Kong women was that subjecting children to\nbeatings was widespread and acceptable provided the pun-\nishment was just and delivered in the context of love.Angela,\nfor example, told us that she was regularly beaten with a\nfeather duster, with her mother counting down `ten, nine ...',\nbut saying all the time `I love you'.15 Angela felt that this was\nexcessive \u00ad she would beat her own child `but five times\nJackson et al. 7\nwould be enough'. Donna also saw this as a necessary part of\nchild-rearing:\nAlthough what I learnt at school [from her psychology degree]\nteaches me that we should not physically punish the child, I still\nthink that it is necessary as the child needs to be afraid of the\nparents to a certain extent. You can't spoil them too much!\n(Donna)\nWhen we shared this with the British group, only one par-\nticipant mentioned physical punishment, and all agreed that\ncontrol through guilt was a more common and effective\nparental strategy:\nCarla:\n... but like the disappointment thing, that, `I'm very\ndisappointed in you', that was used a lot ... just anyone\ntelling you they're disappointed is horrible\nAll: yeah\nEmily:\na positive thing as well, like my parents as well as doing\nthe whole disappointment thing and stuff they just sort\nof show you examples of good behaviour as well like,\noh look at such, so she's really well behaved, so you'd\nknow what was expected, what you emulate as well as\nwhat you shouldn't do, you'd have examples or like\nstories in which, you know, the kid was really well\nbehaved and got reward or something like that, you\nkind of got it engraved in you that way as well, it's good\nto behave in this way, and if you behave in this way\nthen we'd be very disappointed\nStevi: so that disappointed really gets to you\nCarla: mm, yeah it's horrible\nAlexis:\nstill does now, if someone, if my dad says I'm really\ndisappointed, even now you feel really guilty, kind of\nlet you down\nFurther exploration of this issue in both sets of interviews\nconfirmed that this was a marked difference between our two\nsamples. This should not, however, be taken to mean that\nguilt and shame were unimportant in the disciplining of\nHong Kong children \u00ad rather that they worked in conjunction\nwith corporal punishment, which could itself be experienced\nas shaming.\nAnother major difference, on which we have reported\nelsewhere (Jackson and Ho, 2014) was in mothers' manage-\nment of their daughters' sexual activity. The British mothers,\nwith one exception, accepted that their unmarried daughters\nwere sexually active and had been since their teens. The\nHong Kong mothers, on the other hand, assiduously policed\ntheir daughters' conduct and constantly admonished them\nagainst pre-marital virginity loss. This issue provoked\nlengthy and lively discussions in the Hong Kong focus\ngroup, which were then used as stimulus material for the\nyoung British women \u00ad who were surprised and indeed\nshocked that mothers could be so intrusive and that daugh-\nters could accept such restrictions. What became evident\nhere, which was nowhere made explicit in the interviews,\nwas how taken for granted it is that young British women,\nfrom their teens onwards, will be heterosexually active. It is\nnot that the British mothers and daughters did not mention\nparental regulation of sexuality \u00ad they did \u00ad but it was largely\nin terms of mothers talking about keeping their daughters\nsafe (from unwanted pregnancy and coercive sex). This was\nin keeping with the expectation that young women would\nand did engage in a variety of sexual practices.\nOne aspect of this expectation was that it was common, in\nthe British families, for young women to have boyfriends stay-\ning over, and sharing their beds, in the parental home. We were\naware that this would be unusual in the Hong Kong context\nand therefore asked the participants in the Hong Kong focus\ngroup to comment on this. We used a data extract from an\ninterview with one of the British participants, Zoe, who com-\nplained about an age restriction on her being able to sleep with\nher boyfriend in the family home, which she had not been\nallowed to do until she turned 18years \u00ad although her mother\nhad gone with her when she `went on the pill' a year earlier.\nThe reaction among the Hong Kong women was, universally,\nthat there was no way this would be possible for them even\ncurrently, when they are in their twenties (Jackson and Ho,\n2014). Using cross-cultural data feedback here also provided\nan opportunity for cultural misunderstanding. Towards the end\nof the discussion, the following sequence occurred:\nJacqueline:\nbut what kind of, I mean the background of family,\nhow is it like, this family?\nStevi:\num, it's sort of lower middle class, mother's a\nteacher um, parents were um, quite hippy-ish in\ntheir youth, so her mother's a bit sort of alternative,\nif you like, she's still a bit of an aging hippy I guess,\nin some ways\nJacqueline:\nand then the house, they have space for them to\nsleep together?\nStevi had interpreted the initial question as referring to\nthe attitudes and lifestyle of the family, whereas what\nJacqueline was asking was whether they very wealthy to\nhave so much space at their disposal. In Hong Kong, because\nof the excessively high cost of housing, most people live in\nvery small apartments with limited opportunities for privacy\n\u00ad something we went on to discuss. This interchange, while\nproducing a passing sense of embarrassment at her own cul-\ntural insensitivity on Stevi's part (since she was well aware\nof the housing situation in Hong Kong) also alerted us to\nsomething that was to become central to our analysis \u00ad the\nimportance of material factors in shaping personal lives and\nAnalytical strategies \u00ad mapping and\ndiscovering differences and similarities\nWe do not have the space here to discuss in detail our ana-\nlytic strategies, but wish to highlight a few key points we\n8 Methodological Innovations\nconsider important in comparative analysis. As is generally\nthe case in qualitative work, analysis is a complex iterative\nprocess. We began developing a rough coding frame while\nwe were still interviewing, based both on our research\nquestions and themes emergent from the data \u00ad many of\nwhich we had not expected. This enabled us to begin to map\ngenerational and cross-cultural similarities and differences.\nBoth the coding frame and this mapping underwent con-\ntinual modification and refinement with deeper exploration\nof the data. At all stages of this process, consultation\nbetween us was essential to ensure that we each understood\nthe other's perspective and were able to provide the context\nnecessary to make sense of the data from the differing loca-\ntions.16 In interpreting the data, we consistently paid atten-\ntion to the wider socio-economic, political and cultural\ncontexts of the women's lives. This is of vital importance in\navoiding the dangers of cultural essentialism (Narayan,\n1998) and especially of any orientalist assumptions about\nChinese culture.\nHere, we found Lynn Jamieson's (2011) concept of `prac-\ntices of intimacy' particularly useful and has now become\ncentral to our ongoing analysis; it has sensitised us to both\nsimilarities and differences between Hong Kong and Britain\nand enabled us to locate accounts of everyday practices in\ntheir social context. Jamieson developed this concept, in\npart, as a possible challenge to methodological nationalism,\nsuggesting that it could be applied cross-culturally. Practices\nof intimacy, as Jamieson points out, are not necessarily egali-\ntarian. A good example of this is parental disciplining of chil-\ndren, where the concept of practices of intimacy enabled us\nto see our data on this issue in a new light. While it may seem\nodd to think of physical punishment as `intimacy', the Hong\nKong context alerted us to the possible legitimacy of doing\nso; in both societies, parents `love and punish',17 albeit in\ndifferent ways. These may be two sides of the same coin and\ntherefore part of the practice of parent\u00adchild intimacy within\nfamilies. This might broaden ideas of intimacy in terms of\nwhat goes in families and how managing children's behav-\niour relates to overall expectations of family practices and\nresponsibilities.\nThe differences between British and Hong Kong child-\nrearing practices should not, we would argue, be analysed\nas simply cultural, but as also a product of the socio-eco-\nnomic conditions of mothers' lives and their daughters'\nanticipated futures. There are parallels between the differ-\nences we found in our Hong Kong and British samples and\nthe class differences in mothers' regulation of daughters'\nbehaviour identified by Walkerdine and Lucy (1989). The\nstrictness of girls' upbringing in Hong Kong should be\nseen in terms of their mothers preparing them to enter a\nhighly competitive educational and working environment\nin a fiercely capitalist economy with almost nothing by\nway of a welfare state. The mothers themselves had grown\nup in the colonial era when conditions were even worse\nand life was a struggle for survival; often, their own\neducation had been sacrificed so that they could contribute\nto the family economy (cf. Salaff, 1995). They therefore\nimposed rigid boundaries on their daughters' conduct to\nensure the latter's future success. The British mothers,\nhaving grown up with the establishment of the welfare\nstate and benefitted from the expansion of educational\nopportunities, could more often afford to be, in one wom-\nan's words, `relaxed' in their approach to rearing their\ndaughters. Although they were concerned about the uncer-\ntainties of the future for their daughters, they did not push\nthem to succeed in the same way as the Hong Kong moth-\nWe make these points here to underline how, in a variety\nof ways, the material socio-economic contexts of life have\nbeen woven into the analysis of our data, including taking\naccount of the intertwined histories of Hong Kong and the\nUnited Kingdom and the lasting legacies of colonialism and\nhow these histories have influenced practices of intimacy.\nThis does not mean that cultural differences are irrelevant,\nmerely that cultural traditions should not be understood in\nisolation as definitive of how a given population behaves.\nOne significant aspect of culture that had major conse-\nquences for our research is language.\nThe issue of language further complicated the analytic\nprocess given that the interviews were conducted in the\nnative language of participants and that, while Sik Ying is\nfluent in English, Stevi does not speak Cantonese or read\nChinese. It is vitally important, however, that transcription\nand data analysis are conducted in the original language.\nLanguage matters, as there are often not direct translations of\nculturally specific terms so that translating our Chinese tran-\nscripts into English prior to analysis would have risked not\nonly a loss of nuance but also possible distortion of meaning.\nEven those who are bilingual can find modes of expression\ndelimited by the language they are speaking at any given\ntime. In one of our examples of physical punishment,\nAngela's story involved her translating her mother's words\nas `I love you'. These words served as a `free translation'and\nmake perfect sense to an Anglophone audience, but, as a\nCantonese speaker would immediately recognise, are\nunlikely to be a literal translation. The word `love' in\nCantonese (and also in Putonghua/Mandarin) is `ai' but is\nrarely used in a familial context among Hong Kong people as\nit is too strong a word. It is more likely that Angela's mother\nused the common phrase `ngo ho sek nei', which would\ntranslate as `I really care about you'\u00ad this would have been a\nrather long-winded expression to use in English and her\nchoice of translation was thus a practical one, capturing a\ndegree of conceptual equivalence (Birbili, 2000), but losing\nsome of the cultural specificity.\nBecause we did not wish the subtleties of our participants'\nwords to be lost in translation, we did not work with transla-\ntions of the Cantonese interviews. Instead, the Hong Kong\nteam provided the British team with summaries of the inter-\nviews. We then analysed the two data sets separately but to\nJackson et al. 9\nour common, and continually evolving, coding frame, con-\nstantly returning to the data and discussing it with each other\nas we developed our analysis. It is only when we wish to\nquote a participant that we then translate their words. When\nwe do this, we find ourselves having to make a choice, like\nAngela, between a literal and freer translation, finding a\ncompromise that conveys a degree of conceptual equiva-\nlence. Even where the literal meaning is directly translatable,\na literal translation can be baffling to a speaker of another\nlanguage. An example is provided by the way we dealt with\na Hong Kong mother, Ellen, talking about her daughter's\nintention to buy her parents an apartment and expressing\nbelief in her daughter's ability to do so. Having said this she\ncommented, in literal translation `we should not look down\non our children'. While `look down on'is an expression used\nin both Cantonese and English, to Stevi this sounded odd\napplied to a person's children. In the initial published version\n(Jackson et al., 2013), we settled on `underestimate'as a con-\nceptual equivalent, capturing what Ellen meant but perhaps,\nin the process, losing some of the cultural specificity. We are\nstill arguing about this!\nIn other circumstances, the literal meaning actually helps\nin arriving at an appropriate translation. Chinese is gram-\nmatically very different from European languages and is\nwritten in characters, each one of which represents a concept\n(which can also of course be spoken). One way of proceed-\ning, particularly with difficult to translate passages of tran-\nscript, is to think what each character denotes and connotes.\nWe found it useful to work together with the Chinese tran-\nscripts, with Sik Ying providing first a rough translation of\nthe gist of the passage but then focusing down on the mean-\ning of each character and discussing the translation between\nus \u00ad thus taking advantage of Sik Ying's native understand-\ning of Cantonese and Stevi's more in-depth understanding of\nhow varying possible translations are likely to be understood\nby English speakers. These issues of translation continue to\nbe discussed between us as we carry out further analysis on\nand writing from our data.\nConclusion\nInterviews and focus groups can never provide a transparent\nwindow into people's lives; they are products of interaction\nthat have occurred at a particular time and place, and the\nresultant data are co-produced by researchers and partici-\npants within those spatial and temporal limits. The signifi-\ncance of this in relation to the project we have been discussing\nhas become particularly clear to us because of events that\noccurred in Hong Kong after we had completed our empiri-\ncal work. If we were doing this research now, after the\nUmbrella Movement18 occupations and its subsequent reper-\ncussion on Hong Kong residents, where political divisions\nand polarisation are often manifested within families, espe-\ncially between generations, we would doubtless have elicited\ndifferent stories.19\nThis was exploratory research based on small samples,\nbut we have learned great deal from it, not simply about\nwomen's lives in different places but also how to do research\nof this kind. Research is rarely `a straightforward, clinical,\neasily manageable process' but `inevitably presents numer-\nous challenges' (Ryan-Flood and Gill, 2010: 2). Cross-\nnational collaboration is even more challenging than research\nconducted in a single location. It is clear, however, that the\ndifficulties and challenges we encountered were not merely\nhurdles to be overcome, or differences in research practice to\nbe ironed out, but that they actually tell us something about\npractices of intimacy in different socio-cultural contexts. In\nparticular, our experience indicates that while standardisa-\ntion of research practices might be seen as essential to pro-\nducing comparable data, it might also lead to a flattening out\nof meaning and context, and therefore the loss of important\ninsights. In working collaboratively, there must be room for\nresearchers to modify their practices in response to local con-\nditions and cultural sensitivities and also to experiment and\ninnovate \u00ad above all to be flexible and not to insist on apply-\ning western research protocols to settings where they are\ninappropriate.\nIt was this flexibility and willingness to experiment\nwhich led to the development of a useful innovative\nmethod \u00ad cross-cultural data feedback. We have learnt\nfrom the experience of using this method in a rather ad hoc\nway, as a result of serendipity, and are now beginning to\nthink about the ways in which the process could be\nimproved to benefit our own and others' future cross-cul-\ntural research. First, planning it into the research design at\nthe outset would certainly help make it more systematic\nand effective, with the proviso that it would still be neces-\nsary to be open to adapting it along the way as unexpected\nissues and data emerged. Second, it is particularly helpful\nto videotape the focus group interaction to pick up non-\nverbal responses to the shared data and also, potentially, to\nplay it back to groups from other locations. If different lan-\nguages were in use, the videos could be subtitled. This\nraises potential practical and ethical difficulties. The prac-\ntical issues are ones of timing and asymmetry between\ngroups. The first group conducted would not, of course,\nhave another focus group to respond to, but could (as our\nHong Kong group did) respond to previously collected\ninterview data. It might then be possible to hold a second\nround of more symmetrical focus groups in which videos\nwere exchanged between two (or among more) groups.\nThe ethical concerns relate to ensuring consent to being\nvideoed and the video's use with other participants, as well\nas protecting anonymity. Our third recommendation is that\nit would be beneficial for researchers from differing loca-\ntions to all be present at each focus group, both to feed into\nit and observe. These are ideas with which we are working\nin developing the future collaborations, but there may be\nother ways in which this useful method could be further\ndeveloped and modified by us and other researchers.\n10 Methodological Innovations\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe project was funded by an ESRC Hong Kong Bilateral award.\nNotes\n 1. We are not concerned with discussing our locations as `insider'\nor `outsider' in the two settings. This issue has been much\ndiscussed in the literature, including the important point that\nthese are not stable or mutually exclusive (Letherby, 2003;\nResearch Council (ESRC) Hong Kong Bilateral programme is\njointly sponsored by the ESRC and the Hong Kong Research\nGrants Council.\n 3. While here we use `UK'in discussing the relationship between\nthe two territories, elsewhere we deliberately use `Britain'\nand `British' since all the UK interviews were conducted in\nEngland and Wales rather than in the United Kingdom as a\nwhole.\n4. For more information on the colonial history and its legacy,\n5. The British end of the funding was equivalent to an ESRC\nsmall grant while the Hong Kong funding was considerably\nless.\n6. The British team consisted of the PI (Stevi) and a postdoc-\ntoral researcher (Jin Nye Na) who was employed on the project\non a half time basis for 17months \u00ad the maximum affordable\nwithin the funding taking account of other expenses. As well\nas conducting most of the British interviews and co-facilitating\nboth the Hong Kong and British focus groups, Jin Nye was\ninvolved with the early stages of analysis and is co-author of\nthis and two other papers. The Hong Kong team at any one\ntime comprised the PI (Sik Ying) and a research assistant. The\nHong Kong funding was not sufficient to hire a postdoctoral\nresearcher. Instead, a series of short-term Research Assistants,\nwith undergraduate or masters level education, were employed\nand were mostly involved in support tasks. Only one of these\nresearch assistants (who joined the team towards the end of the\ninterviewing) conducted any interviews.\n 7. We have discussed the issues raised in this section and the next\nin greater detail elsewhere (Jackson et al., 2016).\n 8. These methods of recruitment meant that our participants were\nself-selecting, especially those who responded to advertise-\nments. Those who volunteered to participate are likely to be\na somewhat biased sample, for example, excluding families\nwhere there were major conflicts between mothers and daugh-\nters or problems they might not wish to discuss with research-\ners \u00ad although we did document some troubled individual and\nfamily histories. Some families approached through personal\nnetworks did decline our invitation to participate.\n 9. All names of participants are pseudonyms. In choosing pseu-\ndonyms, we followed the form of names used in the interviews.\nSome of the Hong Kong mothers did not divulge their per-\nsonal names (though all the British women did) and where this\nwas the case, we have used family names. In some previous\npublications, we have used the title `Mrs' but this is not cul-\nturally appropriate, hence the usage of `Ms' here. Chinese\nwomen do not change their family name on marriage though\nthey might be referred to as the `wife of' someone, for exam-\nple, Wong tai or Wong tai. We have given the young Chinese\nwomen, and the older women who did use personal names,\nEnglish pseudonyms as it is common practice for Hong Kong\nwomen, especially younger women to have both English and\nChinese names and to use the former in everyday interaction\n\u00ad all the young women in our sample did.\n10. We also tried using `personal community maps' (Spencer and\nPahl, 2006) as a way of capturing both the possible diver-\nsity of family forms and personal relationships within our\nsamples and also differences between Hong Kong and British\npatterns of relatedness \u00ad for example, the greater importance\naccorded to extended family relationships in Hong Kong\n(see, for example, Koo and Wong, 2009). While this tech-\nnique worked well with British participants, it proved impos-\nsible to use in Hong Kong and was quickly abandoned (see\n11. There was one other Hong Kong woman with a lesbian daugh-\nter, but she did not acknowledge her daughter's sexuality.\n12. For more details on the use of vignettes in Asian contexts, see\n13. Because our interview guide was designed to be flexible, the pre-\ncise wording of questions was likely to vary from one interview\nto another. It was therefore not necessary to pay close attention to\nprecise translation \u00ad unlike survey research where translation of\nquestions is a critical issue (see Birbili, 2000). We discuss trans-\nlation issues in more detail later, in the context of data analysis.\n14. A film called Mom Matters has been made of the Hong Kong\nfocus group, with subtitles in Chinese. The film is available,\nfor use in educational contexts only, from Sik Ying Ho.\n15. Angela was, of course, translating her mother's words into\nEnglish in telling her story. We recognise that the words she\nchose might not ring true for a Cantonese speaker. See below.\n16. By this stage, there were just two of us working on the data,\nStevi and Sik Ying, the two PIs.\n17. Love and Punish is the title of a documentary film made by Sik\nYing featuring one of the mother\u00addaughter pairs in our sample.\nThe film can be obtained from her, strictly for use only in edu-\ncational contexts.\n18. The Umbrella Movement was a mass protest in the form of\n2014 in three key locations in Hong Kong: Admiralty,\nCauseway Bay and Mongkok. It was part of a wider, ongo-\ning, struggle for democracy and genuine universal suffrage in\nHong Kong and developed from the original `Occupy Central'\ncampaign against the decision of the Standing Committee of\nthe National People's Congress (NPCSC) not to allow a fully\ndemocratic election of the Hong Kong Chief Executive in\n2017. When the police used tear gas and pepper spray against\nthe demonstrators, they protected themselves with umbrellas\n\u00ad hence the `Umbrella Movement'.\n19. This has become evident from our new study, currently in the\npilot phase, of the impact of the umbrella movement and its\naftermath on practices of intimacy. We have recorded new\nstrains in familial relationships, but also new forms of solidar-\nity and personal relationships and emerging politicised identi-\nties among the younger generation.\nReferences\nBeck U and Beck-Gernsheim E (2002) Individualization:\nInstitutionalized Individualism and Its Social and Political\nConsequences.
