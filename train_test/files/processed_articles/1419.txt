In the study of NHANES II\nCaucasian data, we analyzed the distribution of transferrin satura-\ntion after removing values for individuals possibly homozygous for\nthe gene responsible for hemochromatosis and found evidence for\n2 subpopulations, one postulated to be predominantly unaffected\nby the gene for hemochromatosis and the other predominantly\nheterozygous for hemochromatosis.2 More recently, we examined\nNHANES II data from African Americans from which markedly\nelevated transferrin saturation values were not removed, and\nmixture modeling provided evidence for 3 subpopulations of\ntransferrin saturation.Although the type of hemochromatosis found\nin Caucasians may be rare in African Americans, our findings for\nAfrican Americans were consistent with population genetics for a\ncommon locus that influences iron metabolism.1\nTransferrin saturation can be reduced with inflammation as well\nas iron deficiency3 and the same measurement can be elevated by\nincreased iron stores and a variety of other conditions.4 Therefore,\nit is not completely clear that, on a population basis, elevated\ntransferrin saturation reflects increased iron stores. In fact, in a\nrecent analysis of data from the third National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES III), only 11% to 22% of adults\nwith elevated serum transferrin saturation as defined by various\ncutoff values had a concurrently elevated serum ferritin level.5 In\nthe present study, we analyzed data from the NHANES III to\ndetermine if subpopulations based on transferrin saturation have\ndifferent levels of storage iron as assessed by measurements of\nserum ferritin concentration.\nMaterials and methods\nSources of data\nThe primary source of data for this study was NHANES III, which surveyed\na representative sample of the noninstitutionalized US population in\nsampling units (county or small group of contiguous counties). The lower\nage limit was set at 2 months with no upper limit in age. Based on an\ninterviewer's observation, each person was classified by race as non-\nHispanic black, non-Hispanic white, Mexican American, or other.6 For the\npurposes of this study, we did not analyze data from Mexican Americans\nbecause of the lack of estimates of the admixture of Caucasian genes in this\npopulation.

Serum transferrin saturation was calculated by\ndividing the serum iron level by total iron-binding capacity and multiplying\nby 100. Information regarding methodologic variation over the assays was\nprovided by Gunter and colleagues.7 The coefficients of variation for\nanalyses of control pools averaged 3.1% and 3.3% for serum iron and total\niron-binding capacity, respectively. Serum ferritin concentration was mea-\nsured by using the Quantimmune IRMA kit (Biorad Laboratories, Hercules,\nCA). The coefficient of variation for serum ferritin control pools covering a\nrange of medium to high concentrations (approximately 25-440 ng/mL)\nwas 5.4% on average, and for low-concentration pools (5-10 ng/mL) it was\nSelection criteria\nData were extracted from the NHANES CD-ROM.7 For the analysis, we\nselected transferrin saturation and serum ferritin values from 19 263 men\nand nonpregnant women who were at least 20 years of age. These included\nabnormally low hemoglobin or hematocrit values because anemias of\nvarious causes are associated with abnormally high8-10 or low3,11 transferrin\nsaturations and serum ferritin concentrations. We excluded subjects with\nabnormally low mean corpuscular volume (MCV) levels because a low\nMCV can be associated with iron deficiency and inflammation,3 either of\nwhich can lead to altered transferrin saturation and serum ferritin val-\nues.10-13 It has been shown that hemochromatosis probands have mean\nMCV values significantly higher than wild-type control subjects,14 and\ntherefore we did not exclude subjects with MCV values above the reference\nrange. We excluded subjects with elevated erythrocyte protoporphyrin\nbecause this finding is associated with iron deficiency and inflamma-\ntion.15,16 We excluded subjects whose liver function tests were twice the\nupper limit of the normal reference range (serum alanine aminotransferase,\nserum aspartate aminotransferase, serum -glutamyl transferase, serum\ntotal bilirubin, and serum lactate dehydrogenase) or who had a positive or\nborderline serum hepatitis B surface antigen or positive serum hepatitis C\nantibody because transferrin saturation and serum ferritin concentration\nelevations can be associated with hepatocellular damage attributable to\nconcurrent viral disease and alcohol or drug usage.17 We excluded subjects\nwith an increased serum C-reactive protein level because inflammation can\naffect measures of iron status.18,19 In this study we were unable to account\nfor intraindividual variation in transferrin saturation due, in part, to diet at\nthe time of the last meal before the blood collection.\nAdjustment of transferrin saturations for diurnal variation\nBecause transferrin saturation has a diurnal variation,12,20 including\nsamples obtained at different times of the day, without appropriate\nadjustment, might alter the distribution of transferrin saturation. To\naddress this possibility, regression methods were used to adjust trans-\nferrin saturation values for blood samples drawn in the afternoon or\nevening to the predicted values for blood samples drawn in the morning\nin the same individuals.1 For each data set, transferrin saturation values\nwere divided into deciles and a regression equation was determined to\npredict the adjusted average value for morning transferrin saturation for\neach decile. For blood samples drawn in the afternoon or evening, the\npredicted average transferrin saturation value was computed. The final\nrace- and gender-specific data sets consisted of the actual transferrin\nsaturation values from samples drawn in the morning and the predicted\nvalues for samples drawn in the afternoon or evening.\nAdjustment of the data from African Americans to account for a\npossible admixture of Caucasian hereditary\nhemochromatosis genes\nThe data were modified to allow for the possibility that the distribution\nof transferrin saturations among African Americans is affected by\nindividuals who are heterozygotes or homozygotes for hereditary\nhemochromatosis. The gene frequency for the hereditary hemochroma-\ntosis locus in the Caucasian population is estimated to be 0.067.4\nAssuming a 25% admixture of Caucasian genes in the African American\npopulation,21 the gene frequency for the hereditary hemochromatosis\nfrequency for the Cys282Tyr mutation among African Americans was\nsomewhat lower in 2 geographic areas of the United States, a reported\nAlabama.23 Assuming a nationwide gene frequency of 0.017, population\ngenetics would then project a proportion of homozygotes for the\ncans, the transferrin saturation values from heterozygotes for the\nhereditary hemochromatosis locus would be normally distributed with\nthe same means and SDs as found in our previous study of Caucasian\nAmericans in NHANES II.2 Under this assumption, to adjust for\nhemochromatosis heterozygosity, we removed 3.3% of the 1301 values\nfrom the data set for men (n  43) that were closest to 43 random values\ngenerated from a normal distribution with a mean of 46.5% and an SD of\n7%. Similarly, we removed 3.3% of the 1089 values from the data set for\nwomen (n  36) that were closest to 36 random values generated from a\nnormal distribution with a mean of 43.4% and an SD of 7%. In the case\nwhen several transferrin saturation values were equidistant from a\nrandomly generated value, one of these values was selected randomly.\nBecause the number of transferrin saturations arising from homozygotes\nfor hereditary hemochromatosis was projected to be less than one for\nmen and women, no further adjustments for possible admixture were\nmade to the data sets.\nStatistical modeling of transferrin saturations\nData sets for transferrin saturation modeling consisted of 1258 African\nand 2483 Caucasian women (Table 1). As described previously, mixture\ndistribution modeling was applied to determine the best fit of each\ngrouped frequency distribution1,2,24 using the DISFIT computer pro-\ngram.25 In brief, transferrin saturation values were sorted into intervals\nof 2% and the frequency of values within each interval was computed.\nThe physiologic models we considered were a single normal distribu-\ntion, a mixture of 2 normal distributions, and a mixture of 3 normal\ndistributions. We have previously established that transferrin saturations\nin a homogeneous population follow a normal distribution.2 The\nexpectation-maximization algorithm was applied to the distributions of\ntransferrin saturation values for parameter estimation.26,27 The statistical\ntest used to determine the best fitting model was based on the likelihood\nratio statistic. Using a hierarchical structure to analyze each observed\ndistribution, the maximized log-likelihood function for a mixture of 3\nnormal distributions was evaluated (Log L3\n) and compared with the\nmaximized log-likelihood function for 2 normal distributions (Log L2\n)\nand for single normal distribution (Log L1\n). Significance of the\nlikelihood ratio statistics [2Log (L3\n)] at the\n0.01 level was assessed using a resampling technique.28 For the\n3-population model, the methods of Crump and Howe were used to\ncompute confidence intervals for proportions.29\nEstimation of gene frequency for possible loci\nthat influence iron status\nAccepting the possibility that our findings might represent the presence\nof loci that influence iron metabolism, we assumed that the 3 normal\ndistributions of transferrin saturation in our analyses would represent\npredominantly a subpopulation of normal homozygotes, a subpopulation\nof heterozygotes, and a subpopulation of affected homozygotes. We\nestimated the proportions of normal homozygotes, heterozygotes, and\naffected homozygotes as the proportions in the populations with the\nlowest, intermediate, and highest mean transferrin saturations, respec-\ntively. According to the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium equation, p2 (the\nFor personal use only.\nby guest\nwww.bloodjournal.org\nFrom\nproportion of normal homozygotes)  2pq (the proportion of heterozy-\ngotes)  q2 (the proportion of abnormal homozygotes)  1. We\nestimated the gene frequency of the abnormal allele (q) as the square\nroot of the proportion from the population with the highest mean\ntransferrin saturation. We estimated the gene frequency of the normal\nhomozygotes (p) as the square root of the proportion from the\npopulation with the lowest mean transferrin saturation. We then\nexamined whether the model distributions were consistent with popula-\ntion genetics for a major locus effect in which p  q  1.\nThe means for transferrin saturation within corresponding subpopula-\ntions were compared between African Americans and Caucasians of the\nsame gender using the independent sample t test.\nComparison of mean serum ferritin concentrations within\nsubpopulations determined on the basis of\ntransferrin saturation\nA goal of our study was to determine if subpopulations of individuals,\ndetermined on the basis of transferrin saturation, have significantly different\nmean iron stores. Considering the transferrin saturation data sets used for\nmixture modeling, 26 subjects did not have measurements of serum ferritin\nconcentration. After removal of values for these individuals, the data sets\nfor analysis of serum ferritin concentration consisted of 1252 African\n2475 Caucasian women. Because of the marked skewness in the distribu-\ntions of serum ferritin concentration, the square root transformation was\napplied to each data set. Because serum ferritin concentration tends to\nincrease with age,30-37 we developed a method for age standardization based\non statistical regression analysis. Linear, piece-wise linear, and nonlinear\nregression models, stratified by race and gender, were examined by\nregressing the square root of the observed serum ferritin concentration on\nthe age at interview. The best fitting models showed an increase to middle\nage followed by steady state or decline in serum ferritin. Because of the lack\nof a biologic explanation for age-related decline in serum ferritin in terms of\nreduction of iron stores, we adopted a conditional approach to the modeling.\nFor individuals below 60 years of age we used race- and gender-specific\nlinear regression equations to calculate the predicted serum ferritin at age\n60. For individuals 60 years of age or older, the observed serum ferritin was\nused in further analyses.\nThe probability that an individual serum ferritin concentration value\nbelonged to one of the 3 transferrin saturation subpopulations was\ncomputed. Given the total sample size, the number of expected\nobservations within each transferrin saturation interval was calculated.\nWithin a given transferrin saturation interval, each observation was then\nassigned a probability by random assignment from a uniform (0,1)\ndistribution and these probabilities were used to assign individual serum\nferritin concentration values to a given subgroup according to the\nexpected proportions within transferrin saturation subpopulations. Two\nhundred repetitions of the assignment of serum ferritin concentration\nvalues to subpopulations were made and the average mean and variance\nfor serum ferritin concentration within subpopulations were computed.\nThe parametric trend test38 was used to compare the mean square root of\nserum ferritin concentration within each of 3 transferrin saturation\nsubgroups, taking into account the unequal sample sizes for subgroups\nof subjects.\nWeighting the results to reflect the US population as a whole\nThe assumptions underlying our analysis were that transferrin saturation\nvalues are independent and identically distributed; that is, each observation\nhas an equal chance of being selected and that all observations come from\nthe same distribution. However, because individuals in the NHANES III\nsample did not have an equal probability of selection, sample weights must\nbe used to calculate parameter estimates that reflect the US population. For\nNHANES III, a multistage estimation procedure was used to calculate\nsample weights so that point estimates would reflect the US population. The\nPopulation Survey, adjusted for undercounts, for the civilian noninstitution-\nalized US population.39 The methods described above were used to\ncompute parameter estimates from the weighted transferrin saturation\ndistributions to reflect results for African American and Caucasian men and\nwomen in the US population fitting our exclusion criteria. It was not\npossible to adjust the variance estimates to account for the complex design\nTable 1.

The transferrin saturations had been adjusted for\ndiurnal variation and for the possible presence of an hereditary\nhemochromatosis allele in African Americans. Figure 1 shows the\neffect of diurnal variation on measurement of transferrin saturation\nfor African American men. The graphs indicate the relationship\nbetween decile means for transferrin saturations, determined from\nblood drawn in morning examination sessions, and the correspond-\ning mean transferrin saturations determined from blood drawn in\nafternoon sessions (Pearson correlation coefficient, r  0.999) and\nevening sessions (r  0.997). The regression equations based on\nthe unweighted data (Figure 1A) are as follows:\nMorning session transferrin saturation  0.6  1.0  (Afternoon\nsession transferrin saturation).\nMorning session transferrin saturation  1.5  1.2  (Evening\nsession transferrin saturation).\nThese regression lines differed significantly as judged by the F\ntest for the equality of regression lines (F  262.2 with numerator\nand denominator degrees of freedom of 2 and 16, respectively;\nP  .0001).

The proportions of these\nsubpopulations are consistent with Hardy-Weinberg criteria for a\nmajor, common genetic influence on iron metabolism in each of\nthese 2 broad ethnic groups.\nWe previously analyzed transferrin saturation data for African\nAmericans in the NHANES II study and obtained similar findings\nregarding a possible major locus affecting iron metabolism.1 In this\nregard, it is of interest that an iron-loading genetic defect, distinct\nfrom the Cys282Tyr mutation in HFE that is responsible for most\nhemochromatosis in Caucasians,40 may be present in the sub-\nSaharanAfrican population,41,42 and that mutations in HFE are very\nrare in the African American population.41 The present results are\nalso consistent with the possibility of an iron-loading genetic defect\nin the African American population distinct from that in the\nCaucasian population and producing different phenotypes. For\nexample, the mean transferrin saturations within the middle and\nupper subpopulations for African American men and women were\nwhereas mean serum ferritin concentrations were substantially\nhigher than those for Caucasians of the same gender.\nIn the present study, the estimated gene frequencies for heredi-\ntary hemochromatosis in Caucasians based on transferrin saturation\n8.1%) for women corresponding to prevalence estimates of 5.2/\nwith the reported prevalence of hereditary hemochromatosis and\nthe frequency of the Csy282Tyr mutation in the HFE gene. For\nexample, a meta-analysis by Lucotte and Mercier, comprising the\nresults of recent studies conducted in 40 European populations,\nshowed an overall frequency of 5.5% for the Cys282Tyr allele,\nSince NHANES III was conducted before the discovery of the\nHFE gene, a limitation of this study is that testing for the\nCys282Tyr mutation and other mutations was not performed.\nAbout 28% of Caucasians have the His63Asp mutation in the HFE\nin the transferrin saturation22 and are probably included in the\nlower Caucasian subpopulation of the analysis of the present study,\nwhereas homozygotes for His63Asp and compound heterozygotes\n(Cys282Tyr/His63Asp) have elevations in transferrin saturation\nin the middle Caucasian subpopulation. Only about 10% of African\nAmericans have the His63Asp mutation with most being heterozy-\ngotes and less than 0.5% being homozygotes.22 In the present\nanalysis of transferrin saturations from African Americans, it is\npossible that His63Asp heterozygotes were included in the lower\nsubpopulation, whereas His63Asp homozygotes were included in\nthe middle subpopulation. Among Caucasian women, our finding\nof an elevation in mean serum ferritin for the middle subpopulation\nis consistent with the results found for Cys282Tyr heterozygotes in\nthe large study conducted by Beutler and colleagues,22 but in\ncontrast to other investigations in which Caucasian women,\nheterozygous for the Cys282Tyr mutation, did not have elevations\nin ferritin as compared to normal homozygotes.44,46\nWe have considered the possibility that adjustment of trans-\nferrin saturations for diurnal variation potentially could introduce\nan element of artifact in the analyses. To evaluate this possibility,\nwe reanalyzed the data using the unadjusted values. As in the\nanalyses of the adjusted data, these reanalyses identified 3 trans-\nferrin saturation subpopulations with increasing means for each\nethnic subgroup and gender (trend test P  .0001 for all), although\nthe estimated percentage of cells in corresponding subpopulations\ndiffered slightly (results not shown). Similarly, before correction\nfor diurnal variation, the means for transferrin saturation within the\nmiddle and upper subpopulations for African American men and\nmeans for serum ferritin concentration were substantially higher\nthan those for Caucasians of the same gender. Trend tests also\ndemonstrated an increase in mean serum ferritin concentration,\nstandardized to age 60, with increasing mean transferrin saturation\nfor each group (P  .0001 for all), consistent with the results\nobserved in the analyses of the adjusted data.\nEven among Cys282Tyr homozygotes there is considerable\nvariability in disease expression,22,47 and the place of testing for the\nCys282Tyr mutation in screening for hemochromatosis has not\nbeen determined. Although serum ferritin concentration was once\nsuggested as a screening marker for homozygosity for the hemochro-\nmatosis allele,48 transferrin saturation has been regarded for some\ntime as the best single screening test for hemochromatosis.49,50\nRecent large studies of Caucasians in which both phenotypic\ntesting with transferrin saturation and genotypic testing for the\nCys282Tyr mutation were performed have shown that screening\nwith transferrin saturation does not identify all Cys282Tyr homozy-\ngotes,22,47 underscoring the fact that the ideal approach to pheno-\ntypic screening for hemochromatosis has not yet been developed.\nIn our study of NHANES III data using statistical modeling\nmethodology, subpopulations identified on the basis of increasing\ntransferrin saturation had progressively increasing mean age-\nadjusted serum ferritin levels in each ethnic group, stratified by\ngender. These results suggest that it may be possible to develop a\npractical approach to the initial screening for iron overload that\nincludes the combination of transferrin saturation and serum\nferritin concentration measurements.\n"
