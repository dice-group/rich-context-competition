The views expressed in this paper are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the\nopinions of the Deutsche Bundesbank.\n1 Introduction\nAs a rule, the fixed interest periods of banks' assets do not exactly match those of their\nliabilities; the fixed interest periods on the asset side are usually longer than on the\nliability side. This mismatch exposes the banks to interest rate risk. Empirically, we\nfind that interest rate risk is a material risk for many banks, but some banks have very\nlittle exposure to it.1 For instance in Deutsche Bundesbank (2015), it is shown that the\nexposure to interest rate risk for an average savings or cooperative bank in Germany is\nmany times higher than the average exposure of other banks in Germany.\nIn the past, credit risk could not be easily separated from interest rate risk so that\nexposure to this risk, given the long fixed interest periods of housing loans in Germany,\nwas a byproduct of the loan granting business. Today, since financial instuments to\nhedge the interest rate risk are wide-spread, it may be that banks bear this risk because\nit is customary, because hedging with interest rate swaps is costly, or in order to avoid\nadjustments to their business models and earn the risk premium from term transformation.\nBusch and Memmel (2016) show that this risk premium amounted to roughly one third\nIn this paper, two additional reasons for banks' exposure to interest are investigated.\nFirst, interest rate risk differs from other risks, especially in the manner in which it\ndepends on the horizon: A ten-year government zero-bond is risk-free \u00ad as long as the\ninvestment horizon is exactly ten years. If this horizon is, say, a month or one year,\nthe ten-year government zero-bond is risky, not because of its credit risk, but due to its\ninterest rate risk. Accordingly, a bank may appear to be exposed to interest rate risk if\none looks at the current present value changes of its equity, but from a perspective of a\nhorizon of several years, it may be exposed to less or even zero interest rate risk. If a bank\nhas a long optimization horizon, it does not perceive current present value changes of its\nequity as a substantial risk. This paper argues that a bank's business model determines\nits optimization horizon: Banks with a strong capital market orientation are supposed to\nhave a short optimization horizon whereas banks with a traditional business model are\nexpected to have a longer optimization horizon.\nSecond, interest rate risk may serve a bank for hedging purposes. In the event of a\nfall in interest rates, a bank's immediate net interest margins tend to increase, mirroring\npresent value gains of its equity. However, in the long run, this fall in interest rates is\nbelieved to lead to lower net interest margins. Hence, in the event of a fall in interest rates,\na bank gains as immediate net interest margins rise, but also loses as its long-term net\ninterest margins deteriorate. A bank can change its exposure to interest rate risk relatively\neasily and thereby the extent to which a decrease in the interest rate level benefits its\nimmediate net interest margins. By contrast, the long-term net interest margin depends\non its asset and liability composition which cannot be adjusted without changing the\nbank's business model. If the aim is to stabilize its net interest margin in the mid-term, a\nbank may choose a level of interest rate risk such that the positive effect on the mid-term\nnet interest margins of a fall in the interest rates and the negative effect tend to cancel\neach other out, leading to a reduction in the variance of the bank's mid-term net interest\n1Note that whenever we refer to the banks' interest rate risk exposure in this paper we have their\ninterest rate risk in the banking book in mind, i.e. the interest rate risk resulting from the banks'\ntraditional business and not from their trading activities.\nmargin. In the current low interest rate environment, where the interest rate level has\nbeen falling for the last years, this argument is echoed. It has been suggested that the\nbanks in Germany have benefited from loans with relatively high coupons granted in the\npast and that these loans, which are maturing now or will do so in the near future, have\ndelayed the impact of the low interest environment.\nThe aim of this paper is twofold: First, the argument according to which a bank's\noptimization horizon determines its exposure to interest rate risk is theoretically grounded\nand, second, empirical evidence is sought concerning the banks' structural exposure to\ninterest rate risk.\nfind evidence that a bank's perception of and exposure to interest rate risk depends on\nthe presumed optimization horizon. The longer the presumed optimization horizon is,\nthe more the bank is exposed to interest rate risk in its banking book. Moreover, there\nis evidence that banks hedge the earnings risk resulting from falling interest levels with\nexposure to interest rate risk: The more a bank is exposed to the risk of a decline in the\ninterest rate level, the higher its exposure to interest rate risk.\nThe paper is structured as follows: In Section 2, a brief overview of the literature in\nthis field is given. The theoretical and empirical models are described in Section 3. In\nSection 4, the data that is used is explained and, in Section 5, the empirical results are\ngiven. Section 6 concludes.\n2 Literature\nThis paper contributes to the literature of the banks' strategic choice of their interest rate\nrisk exposure. To our knowledge, we are the first to theoretically show that the length of\na bank's optimization horizon has an impact on the bank's perception of the risk in its\ninterest rate risk positions, and, in our study for the German banks, we find empirical\nevidence that banks with a presumably longer optimization horizon structurally bear\nmore interest rate risk, measured by the present value changes in its assets and liabilities.\nMoreover, Schrand and Unal (1998) find that US banks have an internal risk budget\nthat they allocate to the various risks, especially to credit and interest rate risk. In our\nempirical study, we find for German Banks as well that they act as if they have an internal\nrisk budget.\nIf, for banks, interest rate risk were nothing other than a tradeable market risk, they\nwould \u00ad according to the framework of Froot and Stein (1998) \u00ad completely hedge this\nrisk. However, the literature on the effects of an interest rate shift on a bank's net\ninterest margin casts doubt on the assumption that banks' interest rate risk is a completely\ntradeable market risk. Especially, the long-run effects of a parallel shift in the term\nstructure on a bank's net interest margin would be zero if interest rate risk were solely a\ntradeable market risk for banks. Alessandri and Nelson (2015) find in a theoretical model\n\u00ad and confirm their theoretical results in an empirical study for UK banks \u00ad that, in the\nlong run, a bank's net interest margin positively depends on the level of interest rates. In\nthe short run, however, a rise in interest rates compresses the net interest margin. This\ncompression is also found in the theoretical model developed by Dell'Ariccia, Laeven, and\nMarquez (2014), where a less than complete pass-through to the loan rates is responsible\nfor the decline in the net interest margin as a consequence of a rise in the interest rate.\nIn his study for ten developed countries, English (2002) finds mixed results concerning\nchanges in the short and long-term interest rate. By contrast, Albertazzi and Gambacorta\n(2009) and Bolt, de Haan, Hoeberichts, Oordt, and Swank (2012) carry out empirical\nstudies for banks in industrialized countries and find a positive relationship between long-\nterm interest rates and the banks' net interest income. Claessens, Coleman, and Donnelly\n(2017) find in their study for 47 countries that the banks' net interest margins increase by\n8 basis points per 100 basis points increase in the interesat rate level. In their empirical\nstudy for the German banking system, Busch and Memmel (2017) also find that, in the\nlong run, an increase in the interest rate level is beneficial for the banks' net interest\nmargin. In addition, they find that, in the short run, this increase compresses the net\ninterest margin. They estimate that the critical horizon where the effect of a change in the\ninterest rate level is zero is around 1.5 years. All in all, there is theoretical and empirical\nevidence that the effect of changes in the interest rate level depends on the horizon: In\nthe short run, an increase in the interest rate level compresses the net interest margin,\nmirroring net present value losses, and in the long run, an increase in the interest rate level\nleads to a higher net interest margin, presumably due to a higher long-run pass-through\non the asset side than on the liability side. In our empirical study, we find evidence that\nGerman banks use these differing effects for hedging purposes, meaning that they hedge\nthe risk of a decline in their far future net interest margin by exposure to interest rate\nrisk. To our knowledge, we are the first to investigate this issue in an empirical study.\nThe issue of the banks' exposure to interest rate risk has a structural and a more\ntactical aspect. Most of the empirical studies in this field use the time dimension which\nhas a strong connection to to the tactical aspect (an example of an exception is Angbazo\n(1997)). In our paper, we focus on the structural differences between banks, i.e. the\nvariation in the cross-section of the banks. We do so because it becomes apparent that,\nfor many bank characteristics, most of the variation is between the banks and not in the\ntime series.\nIn this paper, we try to be as exact as possible concerning the notions of interest\nrate risk on the one hand and the risk from maturity transformation on the other hand.\nWhereas interest rate risk is due to mismatches between the fixed interest periods on a\nbank's asset and liability side, the risk from maturity transformation arises from mis-\nmatches in the capital commitments on the respective sides. Interest rate risk and the\nrisk from maturity transformation are often bundled together, especially where the fixed\ninterest periods correspond to the periods of capital commitment. But even then, these\ntwo risks can be separated so that banks with little interest rate risk can be strongly\nengaged in maturity transformation as described by Allen and Gale (1997).2\n3 Modeling\nThe general setting of our empirical analyses is a regression to explain a bank's inter-\nest rate risk, where we measure the exposure to this risk using the Basel interest rate\n2See Vuillemey (2016) for an overview of the banks' bearing of interest rate risk from a macroeconomic\npoint of view.\ncoefficient, bic. This coefficient can be seen as a bank's present value losses due to a\nstandardized interest rate shock, normalized with the bank's equity (see Section 4 for a\ndetailed description). In the paper, we show that the present value changes are not the\nonly relevant measure for the banks' interest rate risk exposure. Nevertheless, we opted\nfor this measure for the following reasons: First, the notion of risk implies that a shock\nhas an immediate impact, rather than in the distant future as would be the case with\nother measures, for instance the long-run change of a bank's net interest margin. Second,\nit is objective in the sense that only the current positions of a bank, not its possible\nfuture margins, are accounted for.3 Third, this notion of interest rate risk is prevalent in\nthe financial markets because, for instance, this risk can be hedged by standard financial\ninstruments like interest rate swaps. Fourth, the risk measured like this is relevant be-\ncause the taking of this risk is remunerated (see Memmel (2011) and Busch and Memmel\nTo account for the fact that the exposure to interest rate risk may be determined by\nslowly changing, structural characteristics, we run a cross-sectional regression. Accord-\ningly, as the explanatory variables mainly concern structural bank characteristics and\ntherefore have their main variation in the cross section (i = 1, ..., N) and very little or no\nvariation in the time series (t = 1, ..., T), we use the following regression:\nbici\n+ ... + N\n\u02c7 xN,i\n+ ... + M\n\u02c7 yM,i\n+ i\nwhere x1,i\n, ..., xN,i\nare bank-specific explanatory variables that will be characterized in the\nfollowing subsections, and y1,i\n, ..., yM,i\nare control variables.\nIn our empirical study, we especially focus on the two additional determinants men-\ntioned before, namely the optimization horizon and the hedging of earnings risks. We addi-\ntionally include a measure for the entent of credit risk in a bank's assets (x1,i\n= rwa_tai\n).\nThe assumption is that banks have an internal risk budget that they allocate to either\ncredit risk or interest rate risk, neglecting the fact that banks are exposed to other risks\nas well. Therefore, we expect the variable x1,i\n= rwa_tai\nto have a negative association\nwith the exposure to interest rate risk. As control variables, we use a bank's capital ratio\n= CRi\n), its size (y2,i\n= Si\n) and its usage of interest rate swaps (y3,i\n= swapi\n).\nWe do not claim to find a causal relationship to explain the level of the banks' interest\nrate risk exposure, as we do not have an experiment or other truly exogenous events\nat our disposal. Nevertheless, we believe that the explanatory variables are more or less\nexogenous (for instance the bank being a savings or cooperative bank), depend on a bank's\nlocation (for instance the bank's credit risk in its assets) or on its structural business\nmodel (for instance the bank products' long-run pass-through and having a trading book)\nor seem in other ways more difficult to change than the exposure to interest rate risk (bic),\nso that the exposure to interest rate risk is rightly the left-hand variable in the regression\n3In addition, English (2002) argues that, according to theory, the change in economic (or present)\nvalue should be equal to the present value of the changes in the stream of future net interest incomes.\nFigure 1: Risk and Horizon\nReturn standard deviation\nHorizon (in years)\nShare\nZero-bond\nIn this figure, the log return standard deviations of a share and a zero-bond in dependence of the horizon\nt are depicted. The share price St\nfollows a geometric Brownian motion: log(St\n) = \u013et+S\n\nt, where\n\u013e is a drift term, S\n= 0.25 is the annualized return volatility and  is standard normally distributed.\nThe zero-bond (with price Pt\n) has a maturity of T = 2 years and the term structure of interest rates is\nassumed to be and to remain flat, but the level rt\n(with annualized volatility r\n= 0.1) changes in the\ncourse of time: log(Pt\nt - r\n(T - t)\n\nt. For horizons t that exceed the maturity T = 2: We\nassume a reinvestment in a new zero-bond with the same maturity T = 2.\n3.2 Optimization Horizon\nInterest rate risk has a special feature that makes it different to other risks, such as credit\nrisk or stock market risk, namely that the riskiness of an asset non-monotonously depends\non the horizon under consideration: A zero-bond (issued by a debtor of the highest\ncreditworthiness) with a residual maturity of, say, two years is risk-free if a horizon of two\nyears is considered, but risky if the horizon is different from two years.4 By contrast, the\nrisk of a share usually monotonically increase if the horizon becomes longer. An example\nof this reasoning is depicted in Figure 1. To some extent, interest rate risk shares features\nwith currency risk, where an amount in Swiss francs is risky for all investors except the\nSwiss ones.\nIn the following model, we aim to theoretically show that the length of the optimization\nhorizon impacts the exposure to interest rate risk. In the model, we assume that an\ninvestor can only invest into zero-bonds of different maturities. For the ease of exposition,\nwe resort to those basic instruments; but the model can be easily extended to portfolios\nof bonds so that the asset-liability-structure of banks can be captured. However, for the\nreason of keeping the model tractable, we neglect the side constraints that a bank has to\n4The concept of the so-called \"pull-to-par\" effect (in the context of bonds) is closely related to the\nreasoning above.\nbe able to service its debts resulting from the deposits at any point in time.\nLet Bt\n(s) be the value of a (credit) risk-free zero-bond in time t that pays in time\ns one euro. We consider two zero-bonds, namely Bt\n(1) and Bt\n(2). In t = 0, investor i\ndistributes his initial wealth W0,i\non the two zero-bonds, where ki\nis his holding in the\nshort-term zero-bond B0\n(1). Accordingly, his wealth W1,i\nin t = 1 is (with B1\n= ki\n+\n- ki\nand in t = 2 (with B2\n=\nki\n+\n- ki\nUnlike Diamond and Dybvig (1983), the investor is already certain in t = 0 when he will\nconsume.

However,\nas we have only dummy variables in the empirical study to characterize the optimization horizon, we\nconcentrate on the model above.\n6This approximation corresponds to the first-order Taylor approximation of the term 1/a at a = 1.\ni\n= ki\n- ki\n-\ni\ni\nB\ndepending on whether investor i maximizes the expected utility of his wealth in t = 1 or\nt = 2.

In Equation (11), we apply again the approx-\nimation of Equation (7); this time, however, the other way around.\nSeveral statements can be derived from Equations (10) and (11) where we interpret\na higher value of ki\nas having a lower exposure to interest rate risk. Note that the\nBasel interest rate coefficient bic is approximately proportional to the duration of the\nbank's equity (see Appendix 2).

First, the demand for short-term bonds for\ninvestors maximizing the expected utility from their wealth in t = 1 can be divided\ninto a speculation component (namely the first summand) and a hedging component\ni\n(1)).7 Second, the speculation component is negative, i.e. investment\ninto interest rate risk takes place, if and only if the expected yield of the roll-over from one\nperiod to the next is lower than the investment in the zero-bond with a maturity of two\nperiods, i.e. B0\n(2) which approximately corresponds to the inequality\n(s) is the interest rate (per year) in t until\ns, i.e. Bt\n(s) = (1+rt\n(s))-(s-t). If the implicit interest rate rim\ncorresponds on average to the future spot rate r1\n(2), the speculation component vanishes\nand only the hedging component remains. Third, the demand for short-term bonds goes\nup whenever the roll-over strategy increases its attractiveness compared to the long-term\ninvestment, irrespective of the individual's investment horizons. This raises the question\nof who in the economy provides the additional supply of short-term bonds in that event,\nmeaning who tactically bears the interest rate risk. Fourth, the hedging component\ncorresponds to the present value of the initial wealth, but transferred in t = 0 to t = 1.\nApart from reasons of speculation, individuals optimizing their positions with respect to\nthe wealth after the first period invest all their money in short-term bonds.\nAccording to the model above, the structural characteristics that determine an in-\nvestor's demand for short-term and long-term bonds and thereby the exposure to interest\nrate risk are the bank's degree of risk aversion i\nand the investment horizon (here:\nwhether the investor maximizes the expected utility of wealth in t = 1 or t = 2).\nA bank's optimization horizon cannot be directly observed. In this paper, we use\n7The hedging component in the case of investors maximizing their wealth t = 2 is zero.\nempirically observable variables to proxy this horizon, namely the existence of a trading\nbook and the belonging to certain banking groups. We introduce the variable tradei\ninto Equation (1). This variable indicates whether bank i has (in the period\nunder consideration on average) a trading book. The presumption is that banks with a\ntrading book are more short-term orientated whereas banks without a trading book are\nmore engaged in (the less market-based) traditional banking business. From a theoretical\nviewpoint, a bank with complete market orientation would maximize today's market value\nof its future cash flows. As hedging interest rate risk \u00ad for instance, the present value of\nan interest rate swap is zero when the contract is concluded \u00ad does not create or destroy\nany market value, such a bank would be indifferent towards its exposure to interest rate\nrisk. In the case of indifference, we make the assumption that banks completely get rid\nof the risks.\nIn addition, we have indicator variables for membership of the group of savings banks\n(svbki\n) or cooperative banks (coopi\n), which would be x3,i\n, respectively, as further\nvariables to map a bank's optimization horizon. It can be presumed that savings and\ncooperative banks have a business model with longer optimization horizons than private\nand capital market orientated banks. However, membership of the savings banks or the\ncooperative banks sector means much more than having a certain optimization horizon.\nTo account for the dominating effect of these two variables, we split the sample into\nsavings banks and cooperative banks on the one side and the remaining banks on the\nother side as a robustness check (see Subsection 5.2).\nIn the literature (see, for instance, McShane and Sharpe (1985)), a bank's degree of\nrisk aversion (in the model above i\n) is sometimes proxied by its capital ratio CRt,i\n(CRi\nis the time series average for bank i). However, we include this variable merely as a control\nvariable y1,i\nin Equation (1), because this variable may represent other economic effects\nas well, for instance capital buffers to cover interest rate risks.\nAfter a fall in the interest rate level, two direct effects occur concerning a bank's net\ninterest margin: First, due to the usually longer fixed interest periods on the asset side,\nthe fraction of assets that are adjusted in a given time span to the new interest rates is\nsmaller than the fraction of liabilities. For instance \u00ad under the assumption of a constant\nbalance sheet \u00ad, if a bank revolvingly grants loans with a 10-year maturity (with a fix\ncoupon), only 10 per cent of these loans are newly granted in one year. By contrast, if\nthe same bank revolvingly collects one-year term deposits, the entire deposits are renewed\nwithin one year. After a fall in the term structure, this effect will lead to a higher net\ninterest margin, because \u00ad at least in the first immediate years \u00ad the fraction of assets\nthat are renewed and accordingly adjusted to the lower interest rate level is smaller than\nthe fraction of the liabilities, leading to a positive net effect on the net interest margins.\nSecond, the interest rate pass-through  on the asset side tends to be larger than on the\nliability side. The extreme case would be a central bank: on the asset side, there are\nloans to banks, geared towards the (short-term) interest rate level and, on the liability\nside, there are banknotes without remuneration regardless of the interest rate level. That\nmeans, on the asset side, there would be a complete pass-through whereas on the liability\nside, there would not even be a partial pass-through. For normal banks (and not the\nstylized central bank), the differences in the pass-through would be less extreme. For\na long-run pass-through on the asset side of 78% and on the liability side of 71%, yielding\nan effect on the net interest margin of about 7 basis-points per 100 basis point parallel\nshift in the term structure.\nAfter a change in the interest rate level, all future net interest margins of a bank are\nsubject to these two effects described above. Whereas the first effect is pronounced for the\nimmediate net interest margins, the second effect has more of an impact on the long-term\nnet interest margins. Busch and Memmel (2017) find that after a year and a half, both\neffects cancel each other out. In Figure 2, this relationship between the change in the net\ninterest margin and the time since the shift in the term structure is depicted for a bank\nwhere we look at three different cases concerning the bank's interest rate exposures (bici\n),\nnamely a low exposure to interest rate risk (\"low bic\"), the level of exposure to interest rate\nrisk that was derived from the parameter values of Busch and Memmel (2017) (\"base\"),\nand a high exposure to interest rate risk (\"high bic\"). We assume that the long-run pass-\nthrough is determined by a bank's business model and that it is far easier for this bank to\nchange its exposure to interest rate risk (bici\n) than the long-run pass through of its assets\nand liabilities (i\n).8 Therefore, irrespective of the level of interest rate risk, the long-run\npass-through of the net interest margin converges to the same value.\nWe assume that a bank's aim is it to stabilize its mid-term net interest margin, i.e.\nthe aim is to reduce the impact of today's movements in the term structure on the bank's\nnet interest margin in the near future. The bank can do this by choosing an appropriate\nexposure to interest rate risk. For instance, in the example in Figure 2, if the goal is\nto immunize the bank's net interest margin in two years time against today's changes\nin the interest rate level, the bank will be well advised to choose the high interest rate\nrisk exposure (\"high bic\"). By contrast, if the bank chooses the low interest rate risk\nexposure (\"low bic\") or the exposure as in the base case, the net interest margin in two\nyears time will change by 5 and 3 bp, respectively, provided a 100 bp downward shift of\nthe term structure occurs. In Appendix 2, we show that the change in a Bank i's net\ninterest margin NIM due to an interest rate shock R at the beginning of the year under\nconsideration can be expressed as\n= ( \u02c7 i\n-  \u02c7 bici\n) \u02c7 R + i\nwhere  and  take on positive values and i\nis an unexplained residual. From Equation\n(12) in combination with the assumption of a fix (and exogenous) long-run pass-through,\nwe see that minimizing the variance of the (change in the) current net interest margin\nrequires us to choose an exposure to interest rate risk bici\nproportional to the long-run\npass-through i\n. So, if the hypotheses hold that banks aim at stabilizing their mid-term\nnet interest margins and that the long-run pass-through is rather outside the control of\nthe banks, than there should be a positive relationship between a bank's exposure to\ninterest rate risk (bici\n) and its long-run pass-through (i\n).\n8In Table 2 in Section 4, it is shown that the share of the serial variation of the variable bic is much\nsupports the assumption that the exposure to interest rate risk (bic) is much easier to alter than the\nlong-run pass-through  of the bank's assets and liabilities.\nFigure 2: Net interest margin: Impact of a downward shift of the interest rate level\nChange in NIM\nTime since downward shift\nd NIM (low bic)\nd NIM (base)\nd NIM (high bic)\nIn this figure, the impact on a bank's net interest margin (NIM) of a 100 bp downward shift of the term\nstructure is qualitatively displayed. The change in NIM is given in percentage points, the time since the\ndownward shift is in years. The base case is based on the parameter values of Busch and Memmel (2017);\nthe cases of low and high interest rate risk (\"low bic\" and \"high bic\") are constructed from the base case,\nkeeping the long-run pass-through constant, but assuming different exposure to interest rate risk.\nThe long-run pass-through  is not directly observable because banks' interest margins\nare a combination of past and current changes in interest rates. Especially in the long\nrun, an increase in the interest rate level might be expected to lead to a higher future\nnet interest margin \u00ad and this is what is found in the empirical literature (see Section 2)\n\u00ad because the first effect mentioned above, i.e. the decrease due to less new business on\nthe asset side than on the liability side, vanishes. The second effect mentioned above is\nespecially pronounced for banks engaged in traditional banking business where the pass-\nthrough on the asset side is much higher in long-run, for instance due to mortgage loans,\nthan the pass-through on the liability side with its large proportion of money-like deposits.\nBy contrast, banks relying on wholesale funding will see a much smaller effect on their\nlong-term net interest margin.9 In our paper, we measure the long-term pass-through \nfor each bank as follows:\nt,i\n=\nJa\nwa\nt,i,j\n\u02c7 pta\nj\n-\nJl\nwl\nt,i,j\n\u02c7 ptl\nj\nwhere wa\nt,i,j\nis bank i's balance sheet weight in time t for asset j = 1, ..., Ja\nand pta\nj\ngives\nthe long-run pass-through of asset position j (see Section 4), the respective variables for\nthe liability positions are indexed with l. As the long-run pass-through, we take the time\nseries average of the variable t,i\nand include it in Equation (1) as x5,i\n= i\n.\nOur hypothesis is that banks hedge the risk of a decline in the interest rate level (which\nthe banks cannot control) with their exposure to interest rate risk (which the banks can\ncontrol). If this hypothesis holds, we expect that the greater the long-term difference in\nthe pass-through i\n, the higher the bank's exposure to interest rate risk bici\nwill be.\nAll data in the paper is provided by the Deutsche Bundesbank. It comes from regular\nsupervisory reports.\nIn every quarter since end-2011, each bank in Germany has had to report its exposure\nto interest rate risk in its banking book. In doing so, the bank has to determine the\nchanges in present values of the assets and liabilities in its banking book as a consequence\nof interest rate shocks. The shocks consist of parallel overnight shifts of the entire term\nstructure by +200 bp and by -200 basis points, respectively. The more adverse of the\ntwo outcomes is chosen and normalized with the bank's regulatory capital, known as the\nBasel interest rate coefficient (bict,i\n). For more than 95% of the banks, the more adverse\nscenario is the one involving the increase in the interest rate level; in our empirical study,\nwe therefore use only this scenario.\nThe variable rwa_ta, which measures the credit risk included in the assets, is calcu-\nlated as the ratio of a bank's risk weighted assets (RWA) and to its total assets (TA).\nThe variables svbki\nand coopi\nare dummy variables that take on the value of 1 if bank\ni in time t belongs to the savings and cooperative banks sector, respectively. As the\n9Busch and Memmel (2017) find a long-run effect on the net interest margin for the small and medium\nsize banks in Germany of 8 basis points (bp) per 100 bp shift in the term structure while the effect for\nthe more wholesale oriented large banks amounts to 3 bp.\nTable 1: Long-run pass-through\nFixed interest period No split Short-term Medium Long-term\nDomestic private households\nFirms, public sector, other non-financials\nAll non-financials\nThis table shows the estimated long-run pass-through for various balance sheet positions; monthly data;\nperiod January 2003 - March 2016; \"ext. notice p.\" means extended notice period, i.e. notice period of\nmore than three months.\nsavings and cooperative banks have not changed their sectors (also called pillars), there\nis no variation in the time series of these two variables.\nTo construct the long-run pass-through, measured by the variable i\nwe apply the method described in Busch and Memmel (2017) according to which the\ntime series of various bank products are replicated by portfolios of government bonds of\ndifferent maturities and by an investment with timely constant return. We interpret the\nfraction of the replicating portfolios that is invested in government bonds as the extent\nof the long-run pass-through ptj\nof the product j under consideration. Using the German\ncontribution to the MFI statistics, we estimate the replication portfolio for each product\nfor the period January 2003 to March 2016. The results for the share of the long-run pass-\nthrough are shown in Table 1. We see that the extent of the pass-through varies across\nthe product categories as also found by De Graeve, De Jonghe, and Vennet (2007) and\nKleimeier and Sander (2006). Especially sight deposits of domestic private households\nand consumer loans show a small long-run pass-through of less than 40%. For wholesale\npositions (for instance interbank loans and deposits, bonds), we assume a complete pass-\nthrough; for non-interest-bearing positions (for instance real estate, shares, capital, cash\nreserve), we assume a pass-through of zero.\nAs mentioned before, we use a bank' s Tier 1 capital ratio CR, its size S, measured\nby the logarithm of its total assets, and the time-series average of the dummy variable\nswapt,i\nas control variables. The dummy variable swapt,i\ntakes on the value of one if in\ntime t the notional amount of interest rate or currency swaps is strictly greater than zero;\nswapi\nis the corresponding time series average.\nWe apply a mild outlier treatment by removing the first and 99th percentile of the\n(non-dummy) variables bic, rwa_ta and .\nIn the paper, we focus on the structural exposure to interest rate risk. To substantiate\nthe importance of this focus, we show that most of the determinants' variation is in\nTable 2: Summary Statistics\nVariable Observations Mean Standard dev.

The variance decomposition can lead to\nminor distortions if \u00ad as in our case \u00ad the panel is unbalanced.\nIn Table 2, we report summary statistics of the variables and the share of cross-\nsectional variation (see Equation (14)). What we see is that, in general, around 90% of\nthe variation is in the cross section, i.e. between the banks, not in the time dimension,\napart from the variable bic, where this share is 76.1%. In our sample, the average interest\nrisk exposure is nearly 19 (per cent losses in present value relative to the bank capital);\nthe average riskiness of the assets, measured by the RWA, is 56.1%, 8% of the observations\nare of banks with a trading book, 25.6% and 65.2% of the observations belong to savings\nand cooperative banks, respectively, and in 47% of the observations banks use interest\nrate derivatives. Concerning the net interest margin, 23.4% of an interest rate shock is\n10Note the resemblance to the theoretical concept of the variance decomposition (see, for instance,\nGreene (2012)): var(x) = var(E(x|y)) + E(var(x|y)) where y contains the bank-specific information.\nfinally passed through (on the asset side: 76.9%, on the liability side: 53.5%). Busch\nand Memmel (2017) estimate this net pass-through as 7.3%. Possible explanations for\nthese differing estimates are as follows. First, the estimates for the long-run pass-through\nare based on different models and on different periods. Second, the net pass-through in\nthis paper is under the implicit assumption of constant balance sheet weights whereas\nthe net pass-through in Busch and Memmel (2017) estimates the total effect, also taking\ninto account possible balance sheet adjustments, which should dampen the effect of an\ninterest rate shock.\n5.1 Baseline Results\nIn Table 3, we show the results of the regression (1). We obtain empirical evidence that the\nlower the credit risk per total assets, the higher the exposure to interest rate risk (highly\nsignificant negative coefficient for rwa_ta). This is in line with the notion of Schrand\nand Unal (1998) that banks have an internal risk budget that they divide up into credit\nrisk or interest rate risk. These findings help also to explain why Memmel (2011) and\nBusch and Memmel (2016) find contrary results when they investigate the relationship\nbetween a bank's net interest margin and its earnings from term transformation. Memmel\n(2011), who finds only little empirical evidence for any relationship between the time series\naverage of a bank's net interest margin and its serial average exposure to interest rate\nrisk, does not control for the exposure to credit risk. By contrast, Busch and Memmel\n(2016) find a positive relationship between a bank's net interest income and its exposure\nto interest rate risk. Unlike Memmel (2011), they look at single years, namely 2012 and\n2013, and, what is more, they control for the bank's credit risk exposure.\nConcerning the optimization horizon, we find \u00ad in line with the predictions from the\ntheoretical model and the proxies for the length of this horizon \u00ad that not having a\ntrading book (significant negative coefficient trade) and being a savings or cooperative\nbank (highly significant coefficients svbk and coop) is associated with higher exposure to\ninterest rate risk.\nWe find highly significant support for our hedging hypothesis, according to which\nbanks use interest rate risk to hedge the risk of a decline in the interest rate level (see\nSubsection 3.3). The higher the long-run pass-through (coefficient ), the higher the\nexposure to interest rate risk.\nThe results for the control variables (capital ratio (CR), the size (S) and the usage of\nswaps (swap)) suggest that lowly capitalized, large banks which use interest rate swaps\ntend to structurally bear more interest rate risk.\nConcerning the economic importance of these effects, which we measure as the cross-\nsectional standard deviation of the explanatory variable multiplied by the absolute coeffi-\ncient, we see that being a savings or cooperative bank has by far the greatest impact (5.75\nand 6.30), followed by the long-run pass-through (0.75), the riskiness of the assets (0.48)\nand the existence of a trading book (0.32). This compares with the economic importance\nof the control variables which are 0.70 for the capital ratio (CR), 0.33 for size (S) and\n0.27 for the usage of swaps (swap).\nTable 3: Results: Exposure to Interest Rate Risk\nVariable bic bic bic\nrwa_ta\ntrade\nsvbk\ncoop\n\nCR\nS\nswap\nconstant\nSample All banks Only savings and Banks excluding savings\ncooperative banks and cooperative banks\nThis table shows the results of the regression (1).

Standard errors in brackets.\n***, **, * denote significance at the 1%, 5% and 10%-level, respectively.\n5.2 Robustness Checks\nGerman banks' exposure to interest rate risk greatly depends on whether or not the bank\nbelongs to the savings banks or cooperative banks sector. As a robustness check, we\nsplit the sample into banks that are savings or cooperative banks and banks that are\nother banks. In Table 3 (second and third columns), the results of these two subsamples\nare displayed. The strong decline in the R-squared (nearly 42% in the first column; less\nthan 4% and just above 11% in the second and third column, respectively) and the high\neconomic importance of the variables svbk and coop (compared to the other variables;\nsee Subsection 5.1) show that much variation is due to the membership of these banking\ngroups. The results qualitatively remain the same. However, in the sample of savings\nand cooperative banks, the variable trade is no longer significant; in the other sample,\nthe variables rwa_ta and  become insignificant.\nAnother robustness check for the cross-sectional analysis is performed by looking at a\ncertain point in time, and not at time series averages. When we look at year-end 2013,\nwhich is approximately in the middle of our sample period, the cross-sectional results\nqualitatively remain the same; the variable trade, however, becomes insignificant.\nAs a further robustness check, other control variables are introduced in regression\n(1), namely the share (with respect to total assets) of bonds (on the asset side and on\nthe liability side) and of interbank funding. These variables turn out to be insignificant.\nWhen the capital ratio is replaced by the leverage ratio, this variable qualitatively shows\nthe same results as the variable capital ratio.\n6 Conclusion\nThis paper investigates the question of why banks bear interest rate risk in the first place,\nespecially the reasons for their structural exposure are in the focus. We theoretically show\nthat banks with different optimization horizons choose different exposures to interest rate\nrisk. In our empirical study for the banks in Germany, we find that a bank's presumed\noptimization horizon, proxied by its membership of certain banking groups and its degree\nof capital market orientation, determines the structural exposure to interest rate risk.\nThe longer this horizons is, the higher is the bank's exposure to interest rate risk in its\nbanking book. Moreover, we find that banks with higher exposure to the risk of declining\ninterest rate levels have higher exposure to interest rate risk. This supports the view that\nbanks hedge this earnings risk with exposure to interest rate risk.\nMost of the variation in the bank characteristics appears to be between the banks and\nnot over the course of time. Therefore, the investigation in this paper with its focus on\nthe cross section is an important complement to the existing literature, where the focus\nis mainly on the differences over the course of time.\nAppendix\nAppendix 1: Optimal Interest Rate Risk Exposure\nLet there be the following relationship between the initial wealth W0\nand the wealth in\ntime t,Wt\n:\nWt\nwhere R is the relevant (annualized) interest rate.\nUsing the first order Taylor-approximation at t = 0, we obtain\nWt\nWe assume that there is an overnight parallel shift of the term structure in t = 0.\nThis assumed shock is permanent and no further interest rate shocks will take place.\nTherefore, the initial wealth W0\nis exposed to interest rate risk. If the interest rate\nchanges, the present value of the asset changes as well where its modified duration D\ngives the sensitivity ( \u017b\nR and \u017b\nW are the expectations of R and W, respectively ):11\n= \u017b\nW \u02c7 1 + D \u02c7 \u017b\nCombining (16) and (17) and neglecting terms of second-order importance, we obtain\nWt\n= \u017b\nW \u02c7 1 + D \u02c7 \u017b\nR - R + R \u02c7 t + D \u02c7 t \u02c7 \u017b\nR - R \u02c7 R\n \u017b\nW \u02c7 1 + D \u02c7 \u017b\nR - R + R \u02c7 t\n= \u017b\nW \u02c7 1 + D \u02c7 \u017b\nR + R \u02c7 (t - D) . (18)\nWe assume that the relevant interest rate risk R is composed of the interest rate level r\nand a term premium that is proportional to the duration, i.e.\nwhere c is the term premium per year of duration D; in case of a normal term structure,\nit is positive.\nIf we assume in addition that the interest rate level r is normally distributed with\nE(r) = \u017b\nr and var(r) = 2\nr\n, then the wealth in t, Wt\n, is normally distributed as well (see\nEquation (18)) and we can, assuming constant absolute risk aversion, state the preferences\nas follows (see Subsection 3.2), where t = Ti\nis the exogenous optimization horizon for\nbank i:\nTi\n= E (WTi\n) -\n\n\u02c7 var (WTi\n)\n= \u017b\nW \u02c7 (1 + Ti\n\u02c7 (\u017b\nr + c \u02c7 Di\n)) -\n\n\u02c7 \u017b\n- Di\nr\nAccordingly, the optimal modified duration D\ni\nfor bank i is\nD\ni\n=\nTi\n\u02c7 c\n \u02c7 \u017b\nr\n+ Ti\nIf the term structure is normal (and c therefore positive), the optimal duration for bank\ni is greater than its optimization horizon Ti\n.\n11Note that the duration is defined as a positive number.\nAppendix 2: Hedging\nWe approximate bank i's balance sheet as follows: On the asset side, there are two types\nof assets, namely loans (share: A,i\n) and cash (share: 1 - A,i\n). The loans are handed out\nrevolvingly, are free of credit risk, have an original maturity of MA,i\nand their coupons\ncorrespond to the prevailing interest rate at the time the loans were granted. Assume\nthat, at the beginning of the year under consideration, there is a parallel shift of the\nentire term structure by R. The change in the bank's net interest margin NIMi\nof\nthis year is\n= (A,i\n\u02c7 A,i\n- L,i\n\u02c7 L,i\n) \u02c7 R + i\nwhere i\nis some bank-specific noise and A,i\nis the fraction of the bank's loans that have\nbecome due in the year after the shock, weighted by the period of time when \u00ad within the\nyear \u00ad they matured (see Busch and Memmel (2017)):\nA,i\n=\nThe modified duration of this bank's loan portfolio is approximately\nDA,i\n=\nMA,i\nThe variables L,i\n, L,i\nand ML,i\nare the corresponding variables on the bank's liability\nside.\nRearranging Equation (22) gives\n= (L,i\n\u02c7 i\n+ (A,i\n- L,i\n) \u02c7 A,i\n) \u02c7 R + i\nwhere i\n:= A,i\n- L,i\nis bank i's (net) long-term pass-through.\nCombining Equations (24) and (23) and setting the result into Equation (25), we\nobtain\n= L,i\n\u02c7 i\n+\nDA,i\n-\nDL,i\n\u02c7 A,i\n\u02c7 R + i\nWith  = L,i\n/(Ai\n\u02c7 DA,i\n\u02c7 DL,i\n) > 0, where Ei\n:= Ai\n- Li\ndenotes\nthe bank i's equity, Equation (26) turns into Equation (12).
