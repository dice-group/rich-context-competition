    "abstract": "Abstract\nMost bank efficiency studies that use stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) employ each\nbank's own implicit input price when estimating efficient frontiers. But the theoretical\nfoundation of most studies is a cost minimisation and/ or profit maximisation problem\nassuming perfect input markets. At the very least, traditional input price proxies therefore\ncontain substantial measurement error. In this paper, we examine the magnitude and\ndirection of this error in cost and profit efficiency (CE and PE) measurement. We suggest\ntwo input market definitions to approximate exogenous input prices alternatively and\nthreefold. First, after accounting for systematic differences across banks, mean CE is\nsensitive to alternative input prices. Second, distortions of mean PE due to traditional input\nprices are small. Third, across CE models small cooperative banks located in large western\nstates are identified as top performers. Large banks and those located in eastern states rank\nlowest.\n",

German banks are no exception. Rising cost-income\nratios and declining profitability reflect increased competitive pressure. To assess the\nstability of the banking system, it is therefore crucial to benchmark the performance of\nbanks operating in Germany. This allows identification of role models and problem banks.\nOne major obstacle to any benchmark methodology is to what extent investigated subjects\nare comparable. To this end, traditionally employed key performance indicators (KPI)\nenjoy the advantage of straightforward calculation. But they fail to account for systematic\ndifferences between, say, commercial, savings and cooperative banks.\nWe therefore suggest a complementary methodology to benchmark banks on the basis of\ntheir cost and profit efficiency. These measures quantify how successful banks are in\nminimising cost and maximising profits when converting inputs into outputs. We assume\nthat all banks in Germany have access to the same production technology. At the same\ntime, we acknowledge that systematic differences prevail in terms of size, asset risk,\nlocation, regional market concentration and bank pillar membership. Therefore, we\nexplicitly account for these differences.\nTo estimate optimal profits and costs we furthermore suggest two alternatives to\napproximate input prices. In contrast to most studies, we utilise regional markets to\ncalculate market prices that banks face when arriving at their production decisions.\nOur results identify cost inefficiencies on the order of 8 to 14 percentage points of actually\nincurred costs. Foregone profits amount to 35 percentage points of actually accrued\nprofits. These inefficiencies emanate primarily among large commercial banks and apex\ninstitutions of cooperative and savings banks.\nFrom a regional perspective, banks located in new states suffer from above-average cost\ninefficiency, but enjoy higher profit efficiency. From a banking group perspective,\ncooperative banks are among the top performers in terms of cost efficiency, while savings\nbanks enjoy higher mean profit efficiency. From a size perspective, small banks\noutperform large banks. Utilisation of alternative input prices leads to approximately 5\npercentage points lower cost efficiency compared to traditional input prices. Therefore,\nalternative input price measurement matters.\nNichttechnische Zusammenfassung\nFinanzdienstleister sind in den letzten Jahren massiven Ver\u00e4nderungen in den Bereichen\nRegulierung, Technologie und Wettbewerb ausgesetzt gewesen. Das deutsche Bankwesen\nstellt dabei keine Ausnahme dar. Steigende Aufwand-Ertrags-Relationen und sinkende\nProfitabilit\u00e4t reflektieren gestiegenen Wettbewerbsdruck. Zur Beurteilung der Stabilit\u00e4t des\nBankensystems ist daher ein Vergleich von Banken zur Identifikation der effizientesten\nund ineffizientesten Banken von entscheidender Bedeutung.\nBei jeder Benchmarking-Methode ist ausschlaggebend, dass die betrachteten Banken auch\ntats\u00e4chlich vergleichbar sind. Traditionelle Vergleichsgr\u00f6\u00dfen haben zwar den Vorteil, dass\nsie leicht zu berechnen sind. Ein wichtiger Nachteil liegt jedoch darin, dass systematische\nUnterschiede, z. B. zwischen den Banksektoren, nicht explizit ber\u00fccksichtigt werden.\nWir schlagen deshalb eine erg\u00e4nzende Benchmarking-Methode vor. Kosten- und\nProfiteffizienz quantifizieren die F\u00e4higkeit einer Bank, bei der Produktion Kosten zu\nminimieren bzw. Profite zu maximieren. Wir nehmen an, dass alle deutsche Banken\nZugang zu der gleichen Produktionstechnologie haben. Gleichzeitig ber\u00fccksichtigen wir\ndabei existierende Unterschiede hinsichtlich Gr\u00f6\u00dfe, Risiko, Einsatzort, Marktkonzentration\nund Sektorzugeh\u00f6rigkeit.\nUm optimale Profite und Kosten zu sch\u00e4tzen, benutzen wir alternative Faktorpreise. Im\nGegensatz zu den meisten Studien berechnen wir die Faktorpreise, denen eine Bank\nausgesetzt war, in Abh\u00e4ngigkeit des jeweiligen regionalen Faktormarktes.\nDie Ergebnisse zeigen, dass die durchschnittliche Kostenineffizienz zwischen 8 und 14\nProzent der tats\u00e4chlich realisierten Kosten betr\u00e4gt.

(1977), Battese and Corra (1977) and Meeusen and\nBroeck (1977) stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) has received increasing attention in the\nliterature as a methodology to measure a single firm's efficiency.1 Decisive virtues of SFA\nare to account for both (i) random noise, e.g. due to well-known measurement problems,\nand (ii) systematic differences between banks in the sample due to heterogeneity across\nbanks (Kumbhakar and Lovell, 2000).2 These features allow a relative comparison of\nmarkedly different banks, for example large commercial versus small cooperative or\nsavings banks.3 In contrast to accounting-based key performance indicators (KPI), SFA\nrankings therefore account explicitly for both environmental factors and random error.4\nIndependent of whether heterogeneity is accounted for or not, the specification of a cost or\nprofit function under the assumption of perfect input markets is at the core of most of these\napplications. The error term is composed of white noise and inefficiency. By means of\nmaximum-likelihood techniques, we estimate best-practice frontiers, relative to which all\nfirms in the sample are compared. For each firm, we decompose the error term. Firms\ndeviate to varying degrees from this frontier according to the estimated inefficiency.\nBut as noted by Mountain and Thomas (1999) the vast majority of SFA studies share a\npotentially severe measurement error when calculating input prices. The assumption of\nperfect input markets requires a bank to be a price taker. It purchases inputs given prices\nthat are determined exogenously in the respective market. But most studies approximate\n# This paper is a successor study to the Marjolin paper presented at the 25th SUERF Colloquium on October\n22, 2004.

All remaining errors are mine.\n2 If systematic differences are not accounted for they are mistakenly identified as inefficiency (Mester, 1997).\n3 Coelli et al. (1998) note that relative rankings imply that only efficiency measures relative to an identical\nfrontier can be compared. This in turn means that efficiency measures from different frontiers, e.g. across\nalternative studies or sub-samples within studies, cannot readily be compared.\n4 Accounting-based KPI are cost-income ratios, return on assets and equity and interest margins.\ninput prices by relating individual banks' factor payments to employed production factors.5\nConsequently, these prices are bank-specific rather than market-determined.6 Such proxies\nmight therefore be poor measures of theoretical counterparts. Poor measurement of true\nexplanatory variables, namely input prices, could distort efficiency estimations\nThis paper addresses the described potential measurement error. We suggest two\nalternatives to approximate input prices and compare efficiency estimates when using\ntraditional versus alternative input price proxies. The paper is organised as follows. In the\nnext section, we review German bank efficiency studies and the respective approaches to\naccommodate the discussed measurement error. Section three introduces the theoretical\nmodel underlying efficiency measurement, our approach to proxy input prices alternatively\nand the empirical specification to estimate cost and alternative profit efficiency (CE and\nPE) for a heterogeneous sample of banks. Section four elaborates on the data used in this\nstudy. In section five, we present and discuss our results. We conclude in section six.\n2 Input prices and German efficiency studies\nTo our knowledge, Mountain and Thomas (1999) is the only study that explicitly discusses\nthe potential measurement error due to the use of bank-specific input prices. They argue\nthat under perfect (input market) competition banks should face at a given point in time\nidentical prices.7 Then, traditional input price proxies lead to biased efficiency results.\nTo assess the importance of this measurement error, they compare CE from two cost\nfrontier specifications with and without input prices. Efficiency estimates between the full\nand the parsimonious model differ by 7 percentage points. However, they reject the\nhypothesis that input price coefficients are simultaneously equal to zero. Despite this result\nthey conclude that input prices should be dropped. They evaluate the benefit from\nobtaining more precise estimates to outweigh the cost due to a higher degree of\ninconsistency because of omitting mismeasured proxy variables.8\nThey acknowledge that the use of \"true\" input prices is highly desirable, but argue that the\nloss in precision requires that poor proxies be dropped. A first suggestion of Mountain and\n5 Dividing interest expenses by borrowed funds is an example found in virtually every study.\n6 Additionally, they are derived from the dependent variable, which should be explained - namely total cost.\n7 In sum, concentration and competition studies (Bikker and Haaf, 2002 and Hempell, 2004) conclude that a\ntheoretical model from the realm of perfect competition is a defendable assumption for German banking.\n8 According to Aigner (1974), proxy variables should be included even if they contain measurement error.\nThomas (1999) to alleviate this measurement error and to enhance estimation is to either\nadjust the frontier for regional differences or to restrict estimation of the benchmark to a\nsample of banks sufficiently akin to each other.9\nGerman bank studies follow this suggestion only implicitly. Among the few available\nstudies, three follow the approach to use regional information primarily due to data\nrestricted to cooperative banks from Bavaria only.10 The authors use data collected from a\nnon-commercial database. In sum, these three studies find improving CE during the early\n1990s. Average cost inefficiency is around 7 percent. Also, their evidence suggests that\nsmaller cooperatives perform better than larger cooperatives and that mergers between low\nefficiency targets and better performing ones increase overall efficiency. The authors\ncarefully note, however, that their results only apply to the sector of cooperative banks in\ngeneral and to those located in the state of Bavaria in particular. Apparently, regional and\nownership differences prohibit a generalisation of their results.\nAltunbas et al. (2001) further investigate efficiency differences across banking sectors and\nthat simultaneously examines cost and profit efficiency of German banks. The study\nsupplies estimates of CE and PE against one identical frontier and against sector-specific\nbenchmarks. They find that inefficiencies are highest for commercial institutes and large\nbanks. For the full sample, CE amounts to 83 percent for the banking sector as a whole.\nThe ability of banks to realise potential profits is worse, as average PE amounts to 80\npercent. Efficiency improves if measured against a benchmark for a more homogenous\nsample, i.e. banks of one type only. This indicates that systematic differences that prevail\nbetween commercial, savings and cooperative banks are wrongly dubbed inefficiency if\ncompared against a uniform frontier that is not adjusted for these factors.\nThese results are consistent with studies explicitly examining the importance to account for\nheterogeneity when estimating bank-specific efficiency (Bos et al., 2004).12 But the\n9 Note, however, that especially the approach to estimate, say, sector-specific frontiers suffers from the\ndrawback that efficiency measures can then no longer be compared across samples (Coelli et al., 1998).\n10 Hence, systematic differences due to bank size, business mix and regional economic conditions are low.\n11 The sectors are the three \"pillars\" in German banking: commercial, savings and co-operative banks.\n12 Factors identified to cause heterogeneity are e.g. different regional macroeconomic conditions (Mester,\n1997), varying risk profiles (Hughes and Mester, 1993) and bank market characteristics such as concentration\n(Lozano-Vivas et al., 2002). Apparently, banks can be \"grouped\" according to many different criteria. But\ntrue groups, i.e. markets, remain unknown and therefore these choices are ultimately arbitrary.\npotential measurement error pointed out by Mountain and Thomas (1999) is in our view\nnot sufficiently accounted for by adjusting efficient frontiers and/or deviations from it.\nTo address the potential mismeasurement of input prices more directly, Mountain and\nThomas (1999) suggest as a second approach to measure input prices per factor market.\nWe argue that this \"second\" approach is an additional rather than an equivalent alternative\nto measure efficiency appropriately. The only study we are aware of that pursues this\napproach is Berger and Mester (2003). Using data on US banks of three cross-sections in\ncalculate input prices faced as an average by all other banks in that particular market,\nweighted by each bank's respective market share. Thus, they use for each bank an\nexogenous price determined by competitors in the respective market. However, the study\nfails to simultaneously account for additional sources of systematic differences across\nbanks. In addition, the authors do not provide a comparison with traditionally specified\ninput prices. Therefore, we do not know how severe this potential measurement error is.\nThis paper fills the gap. We estimate efficiency adjusted for heterogeneity and employ\nalternative proxies of input prices as suggested by Mountain and Thomas (1999).\n3 Methodology\nTo quantify the magnitude of efficiency distortions we provide a comparison. First, we\nintroduce a theoretical model and define our variables. Second, we turn to input price\nproxies according to a benchmark model and two alternative approaches. Third, we\nintroduce the empirical specification that also accounts for heterogeneity.\n3.1 Model specification\nWe follow the intermediation approach to model bank production and define three\naccording outputs.13 The first output captures interbank loans, y1\n, provided. Next, banks\nproduce commercial loans, y2\n. Securities are the third output, y3\n. A bank uses three\nproduction factors to produce outputs. These are fixed assets, x1\n, labour, x2\n, and total\nborrowed funds, x3\n. These in- and output categories represent the most frequently used\nones in the literature. But note as a caveat that across different banks the quality of inputs\n13 For an extensive discussion of possible models of bank production see Freixas and Rochet (1997).\nmay differ systematically.14 Also, especially large banks produce outputs such as custody\nand advisory services that are not explicitly specified here. As far as the data permits, we\ntherefore account for a number of systematic differences across banks of different pillars,\nregion and further characteristics as discussed below in our empirical specification.\nA bank faces an input price vector of wi\n, where i indexes the input used. As the calculation\nof these input prices is at the core of this paper, we devote the next sub-section to a\ndiscussion of our baseline and alternative models. In transforming inputs into outputs, we\naccount for the role of equity, z, as an alternative to fund outputs (Hughes and Mester,\n1993). The transformation function of the banking firm is depicted by T(y,x,z). Note that\nthis implies the assumption that all banks employ the same production technology. We\nassume therefore that a single federal frontier can be estimated for German banks.15 We\nemploy total operating cost, TOC, as dependent variable in the cost minimisation problem\nand profits before tax, PBT, in the alternative profit maximisation problem.16 We assume\nthat banks are price takers in input markets. To produce a given vector of outputs y, banks\nminimise cost by choosing input quantities xi\nat given input prices, wi\n. Using these\ndefinitions, the cost minimisation problem is written as17\n.\n)\n,\n,\n(\ns.t.\nmin\n)\n,\n(\n\n= \nz\nx\ny\nT\nx\nw\nw\ny\nC\ni\ni\ni\nx\ni\nThe Lagrangian of this constrained optimisation is written as\n).\n(\u00b7\n-\n=  T\nx\nw\nL\ni\ni\ni\nWe take partial derivatives with respect to each input, xi\n, and the multiplier, .

Unfortunately, the available data\ndoes not allow for a more detailed granularity of inputs according to such quality differentials.\n15 Alternatively, one could estimate separate frontiers per group. But that approach suffers from the\nincomparableness of efficiency measures from different frontiers and the ultimate arbitrariness of \"correct\"\ngroups. Instead, we choose here to adjust the frontier for systematic differences across banks.\n16 To conserve on space we illustrate here only the cost minimisation problem. The alternative profit model\nby Humphrey and Pulley (1997) is similar and we refer to differences via footnotes.\n17 In the alternative profit model, banks possess pricing power on the output side. The pricing opportunity set\nis H(p,y,w,z), where p denotes output prices, and constitutes an additional constraint next to technology.\nequity, z.18 The minimum cost level is then obtained by substituting the optimal input\ndemand functions into the total cost function given by equation (1), resulting in19\n).\n,\n,\n(\n*\n)\n,\n,\n(\n* z\nw\ny\nC\nz\nw\ny\nx\nw\nC\ni\ni\ni\n=\nIf truly exogenous prices under perfect competition are available, any empirical\nspecification of equation (3) suffers from identification problems.20 However, we assume\nthat input prices can differ between banks due to some degree of market imperfections. In\nfact, the vast majority of studies make this assumption implicitly. In the most extreme case,\nbanks can set prices in input markets. Consequently, they would minimise cost by\nchoosing prices wi\nthat they are willing to pay for given amounts of input.21 Here, we\nabstain from these extreme assumptions. Instead, we focus on the magnitude of potentially\ndistorted efficiency measures due to the use of traditional proxy variables. We therefore\nturn next to our suggestion as how to obtain alternative input price measures.\n3.2 Input price measurement\nIn the cost model, the factor prices for inputs, wi\n, are exogenous variables.22 They are\nassumed to be determined in their respective factor markets and enter the production model\nin section 3.1 as given. Then, utilisation of observed equilibrium factor market prices\nwould be strictly speaking the correct choice to empirically specify equation (3).\nBut due to the lack of such data, researchers employ according to Greene (1993) proxy\nvariables that represent appropriate measures of theoretical counterparts. Ideally, we would\ntherefore use observed contractual wage rates for the price of labour, rental prices per\nsquare metre of office space and interest rates per unit of borrowed funds, respectively. But\n18 The profit maximisation problem yields, in addition, optimal output prices p*(y,w,z).\n19 Accordingly, maximum profits, *(y,w,z), depend only on exogenously determined input prices and\navailable equity to produce a given output. This curbs the frequently encountered lack of available output\nprices. It allows thereby to evaluate banks' success to realise opportunities in output markets.\n20 In a given year, input prices are in such a case constant and could not be disentangled from the intercept.\n21 We also test empirically if banks minimise cost with respect to prices. Then, an optimal cost function\nC*(y,xi\n,z) depends on input quantities rather than prices. Also, we followed Mountain and Thomas (1999)\nand simply dropped the wi\n's entirely, leaving us with an optimum cost function depending on output\nquantities and equity C*(y,z), only. These specifications were not estimable due to collinearity or residuals\nexhibiting a skew that contradicted the requirements of cost and/or profit inefficiency to prevail (Waldmann\n(1982)). This suggests that the respective specifications are inappropriate.\n22 The same holds throughout for the alternative profit model.\nsuch data are usually also unavailable.23 To obtain input price proxies, most studies (e.g.\nAltunbas et al. (2001), Lang and Welzel (1996)) calculate input prices per bank.\nOur baseline model, model 1, mimics this traditional approach. For each bank, we obtain\nthe price of fixed assets, w1\n, by dividing depreciation and other expenditure on fixed assets\nover the volume of fixed assets. The price of labour is calculated as an average wage rate,\n, by relating the Euro amount of personnel expenses to the number of full-time\nequivalent employees (FTE). Finally, we approximate the price of borrowed funds, w3\n, by\ndividing interest expenses over total borrowed funds.\nWe suggest to derive alternative input prices by an approach akin to Berger and Mester\n(2003). We rely on the indications provided by studies on German banking and define\nmarkets, m, in terms of region and banking type. In the first alternative input price model,\nmodel 2, we assume that all banks operate on regional markets. In the second alternative\nprice model, model 3, we assume that large banks compete on a federal market.24\nConsider the market for fixed assets first. In model 2, a bank that is restricted to branch in a\ncertain region will naturally rent physical assets in the vicinity. It competes for real estate\nwith other banks also branching in this particular region.25 On the one hand, it is a safe\nassumption for small banks that office equipment or main administrative real estate is only\ndemanded on the regional market. On the other hand, one might object to this definition of\nan input market on grounds of nationwide operations of large banks. In fact, large banks\nmight set-up regional administrative centres only where prices are most favourable.\nTherefore, we assume in model 3 that large banks constitute one federal market for real\nestate on which they compete with each other. On this federal market, then, each bank\nfaces exogenous rather than traditionally employed endogenous input prices.\nWith respect to labour, we assume that the majority of banks draw from regional labour\npools. We assume that the labour force in Germany is not flexible enough to move from,\nsay, Bavaria to Bremen to conduct standardised banking tasks. In model 2, we therefore\nassume that the majority of employees are recruited in the respective region. However, we\nassert that highly specialised tasks like risk management, investment banking or financial\nengineering require experts. This highly skilled labour force is probably readily willing to\n23 In addition, there are at times substantial conceptual problems as to what the respective measurement units\nare. For example, interest paid does not cover all costs associated with borrowed money as fees are neglected.\n24 This group comprises large commercial banks, apex institutions of savings and cooperatives and Postbank.\nmove. We assume the majority of such highly specialised tasks are conducted either by\ncomparatively large banks or the respective apex institutions on behalf of their local banks.\nTherefore, we construct in model 3 prices for labour to originate from a federal market for\nlarge banks as above. In contrast, all other banks continue to recruit locally.\nFinally, the market for borrowed funds may depend to a larger extent on local conditions\nthan one expects. We know from various monthly reports of the Bundesbank that the\nprimary sources of funding are for most banks customer deposits. In model 2, we therefore\nargue that in demanding funds, for example, a local commercial bank faces competition\nprimarily from the savings bank next door. But in contrast to small banks, large institutes\nrely more intensively on securitised debt and interbank lending. This lower dependence on\na local customer base induces us to apply in model 3 the previous logic of one federal\nmarket for large banks.\nSumming up, we treat each bank in model 1 to operate in its own market. In model 2, we\nspecify exogenous input prices on the basis of regional markets. We use available regional\nidentifiers for each bank and define counties as regional markets. In contrast, we assume in\nmodel 3 that large banks compete on one federal input market.\nNext, we suggest how to derive input price proxies per market. We argue that the prices\nbanks face can be approximated by the average price paid for an input factor in the market.\nThis implies utilisation of average input prices, wi\n, per county for all banks in model 2. In\nmodel 3, we use the average paid by large banks from one federal market as input price\nproxies. Because banks face prices, these market-specific averages are calculated for each\nbank excluding the bank itself. Table 1 illustrates the different calculations for the\nbenchmark and a market model with an example for labour.\nLet wik\ndenote input prices for each bank, where k=1,..,K indexes a bank and K is the total\nnumber of banks in a market.26 We denote markets by m=1,..,M, where M depicts the total\nnumber of markets, i.e. counties. In the example above we have four markets m in total, as\nexhibited by the fourth column in table 1. Each contains three banks, respectively.\n25 Note, that the true market price for real estate, and all other inputs, also depends on the demand of other\nagents. Unfortunately, we do not have according data at our disposal.\nTable 1: Illustration of input price calculations\nBank Input i = L County Benchmark model Market model\nk xi\nm Calculation wik\nm Calculation wik\nNote: All numbers are hypothetical for illustrative purpose.\nL: Labour; xi\n: Amount of labour measured in full-time equivalents; FCi\n: Factor cost of labour measured in thousands of Euros.\nThe benchmark case can be regarded as modelling each bank as a market of its own, i.e.\nthe number of banks equals the number of markets, K=M. This is illustrated in table 1\nunder the heading Benchmark model. Alternatively, we calculate the input price proxy as\nthe average market price excluding the bank's own position. The optimum cost function,\nthen, employs for each bank the average price of all other banks in the region. More\nformally, a bank l in market m faces a price of \n\n=\n-\n= K\nk\nl\nk ik\nil\nK\nw\nw\n,\n)\n/( . To illustrate this\nprocedure for one market, consider the three rightmost columns under the heading Market\nmodel. Within market m=1, the first bank, k=1, faces an input price equal to the average\ninput price paid by the remaining banks in the market, i.e. banks k=3, 5. This procedure\nleaves the average input price paid by all banks unaffected. However, the variation of input\nprices is reduced as can be seen from the last row in table 1. Intuitively, the closer the\nmarket resembles perfect competition, the lower the variation, because price differences\nultimately approach zero until a single market-clearing price prevails.\nWe discuss next the empirical and intuitive implications of this approach with regard to the\nestimated level of efficiency. Recall that in model 1 we explain on the left-hand side (LHS)\nthe observed total cost with an observed output vector and some proxies for input prices on\nthe right-hand side (RHS), \n=\ni i\np\ni\nx\nC w , where the superscript p indicates the proxy. We\nassume that w\nw i\np\ni\n*\n= , i.e. that the proxy reflects true equilibrium prices. These proxies are\n26 We calculated all prices per year and suppress time subscripts here for ease of exposition.\nconstructed by using different parts of total cost Ci\n, for example the category of interest\nexpenses of total costs, and divide them by some input quantity, for example the volume of\nborrowed funds,\ni\ni\np\ni\nx\nC\nw /\n= . One can argue that this amounts to employing a scaled\nfraction of total cost on the RHS in order to explain the total on the LHS.\nThus, we would expect a high explanatory power because the RHS variables are basically\nextracted from the LHS. By definition, the numerators of our ratio that should approximate\ntrue equilibrium prices sum to the LHS (or at least to the major share of it). Hence, for a\nbank with input prices substantially above average, employed variables still explain a lot of\nthe observed total costs by construction. Thereby, total error would be underestimated,\nwhich is crucial for SFA. This is because efficiency is extracted from this total error.\nTherefore, our suggested approach to derive proxy variables for equilibrium input prices\nemphasises the deviations of banks' factor costs over quantities from what other banks\nhave paid under similar conditions. It is perceivable that a frontier using market prices is\nless suited to explain observed costs, as those proxies are actually not directly derived from\nthe LHS observation. Then, the fit of the frontier might deteriorate. This would imply that\nthe total error of our estimation increases. Given the parametric nature of SFA, we assume\nex ante that a certain portion of the error distribution, i.e. deviations from the benchmark,\nis due to inefficiency (Coelli et al., 1998). Then, a higher total error leads us to expect\nhigher levels of inefficiency, too.27 Therefore, we expect higher levels of inefficiency for\nmodels 2 and 3 compared to model 1 if it is true that total error increases when using\nalternative input price proxies.\nApart from the level of efficiency, a major strength of SFA is the ability to rank firms.\nTherefore, we are particularly interested in the distribution of efficiency scores in order to\nidentify best and worst in class banks. Note that according to our alternative input price\nproxies, those banks that paid the highest price within their market are now modelled to\nface substantially lower prices (and vice versa). This is appealing because for a bank that\nincurred high total costs on the left hand side we now employ a market price, which is\nsubstantially lower. Recall that for such a bank the high implicit input price emerged\nprobably from dividing high factor payments by relatively small factor quantities\nemployed. We could flip the problem around and state that the bank has paid for that\n27 As in Kumbhakar et al (1991), we incorporate environmental factors directly. This implies an offsetting\neffect. We expect that alleviating a potentially omitted variable bias improves estimation (Mester, 1997).\namount of input a too high price relative to what competitors have paid. In the benchmark\nmodel this need not imply huge inefficiency, as input prices per bank are ultimately\nderived from total cost of this bank only and, in turn, explain a lot of the LHS by\nconstruction. In the alternative approach, however, this bank would be labelled inefficient\nbecause it incurred the same (too high) costs, while facing a market price considerably\nbelow its own factor payment per factor quantity.\nIn sum, we assume in this paper that markets can be defined in terms of regions. The price\na bank faces to purchase its inputs is determined in these markets. For each bank, k, this\nprice is the average of prices paid by all other banks in that market excluding the bank's\nown price. The specification of exogenous input prices should not only affect the level of\nefficiency, but also the distribution of efficiency scores. Next, we introduce the empirical\nspecification to estimate a reduced form of equation (3).\n3.3 Empirical specification\nWe follow Kumbhakar and Lovell (2000) and use a stochastic frontier model that\naccommodates heterogeneity. To estimate a reduced form of equation (3), we rely largely\non established procedures to measure the effects of misspecified input prices as directly as\npossible.28 As in Lang and Welzel (1996), we employ a multi-output translog function and\ninclude time trend variables to capture technical change to estimate a federal cost frontier.\nFor any bank, k, this cost function takes on the form29\n.\nln\nln\nln\n)\n(\nln\nln\nln\nln\n)\n(ln\nln\nln\nln\nln\nln\nln\nln\nln\nln\n)\n,\n(\nln\nk\nk\nmk\nm\nm\nik\ni\ni\nk\nmk\ni\nm\nk\nik\ni\ni\nk\ni m\nmk\nik\nim\nm n\nnk\nmk\nmn\ni j\njk\nik\nij\nk\nm\ni\nmk\nm\ni\nik\ni\nk\nk\nk\nk\nt\nz\nt\ny\nt\nw\nt\nt\nz\ny\nz\nw\nz\ny\nw\ny\ny\nw\nw\nz\ny\nw\nz\ny\nw\nTOC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n= =\n= =\n= =\n=\n=\nThereby, we reduce the total error and the level of inefficiency. Which of the two effects, accounting for\nheterogeneity versus alternative price proxy measurement, dominates, remains an empirical question.\n28 Bauer et al. (1998) and Berger and Humphrey (1997) review alternative stochastic frontier models.\n29 In the alternative profit model, we employ lnPBT as dependent variable.\nAs outlined in section 3.1, wi\ndenotes input prices, ym\ndenotes outputs and z depicts the\nlevel of equity capital.30 We substitute, input prices wi\n, from the three respective market\ndefinitions discussed in section 3.2 to investigate the effects on efficiency levels, rankings\nand robustness of estimation results. To measure inefficiency, we assume a composed error\nterm in equation (4). The error term, k\n, consists partly of random noise, vk\n, and partly of\ninefficiency, uk\n. For a cost frontier, inefficiency implies above frontier costs. Therefore,\ninefficiency enters the error term with a positive sign, leading to k\n= vk\n+ uk\nIn addition, we follow Bos et al. (2004) and specify a vector of exogenous factors, hk\n.\nThese environmental and bank-specific factors capture systematic differences between the\ndifferent banks in our sample. We assume that these sources of heterogeneity influence the\ndistribution of deviations from the efficient frontier. Kumbhakar et al. (1991) suggest a\nsingle-stage approach to allow hk\nto influence the mean of the inefficiency distribution.32\nWe specify hk\nto contain four variables and three dummies.33 The first variable accounts\nfor findings reviewed by Berger (2003) that efficiency varies across banks of different size.\nWe therefore include the log of total assets, TA. Another characteristic difference between\nalternative banking groups refers to the risk associated with banks' balance sheet assets. To\ncapture the regulatory risk, we therefore construct a ratio, RISK, that relates total risk\nweighted assets to gross total assets.34 Clark and Siems (2002) point out that banks\nincreasingly engage in off-balance sheet activities, OBS, and therefore we include the log\nof OBS in the inefficiency term, too. The rationale to do so is that banks increasingly\nattempt to manage various risks actively with these instruments.35 Finally, we explicitly\naccount for variations in the respective county's bank market structure. We employ a\nHirschman-Herfindahl index, HHI, per year and county on the basis of total gross assets as\nto measure concentration and competitiveness.36 The remaining terms that are included in\nhk\nare dummy variables for the banking groups of local savings and cooperatives. Thereby,\nwe account for systematic differences, such as e.g. previously mentioned quality\n30 Upon estimation, we impose the required restrictions of linear homogeneity in input prices and symmetry\nof cross-partial derivatives of the conditional factor demand functions as in Lang and Welzel (1996).\n31 For the profit frontier, inefficiency reduces profits and is therefore subtracted, leading to k\n= vk\n- uk\n.\n32 For a discussion of the various pitfalls of first estimating efficiency and then exposing it to a set of\nexplanatory variables see Kumbhakar and Lovell (2000).\n33 Our choice is based on results from the literature and talks to practitioners at the Bundesbank.\n35 Clark and Siems (2002) specify OBS as part of the efficient frontier. Kumbhakar and Lovell (2000) call it a\njudgement if a variable influences the technology that determines the frontier or deviations from it. We\nconsidered both ways and decided on the basis of log-likelihood values to specify them to influence the latter.\n36 Hempell (2004) discusses virtues and pitfalls of this measure's adequacy to assess competitiveness.\ndifferences of inputs across banking groups. The final dummy variable identifies banks\nlocated in the East. This way we accommodate less buoyant real economic conditions. We\nprovide descriptive statistics on SFA and heterogeneity variables in the next sub-section.\nAs in Kumbhakar et al. (1991), we assume the random error term vk\nto be i.i.d. with\nvk\nv\n) and independent of the explanatory variables. The inefficiency term is\nuk\n+d' hk\nu\n]|, where d' is a vector of parameters to be estimated. We use OLS\nestimates as starting values when maximising the likelihood function, derived by Aigner et\nal. (1977). We employ their re-parameterisation of =u\n/v\nu\nv\n.\nConsequently,  indicates the ratio of standard deviation attributable to inefficiency\nrelative to the standard deviation due to random noise. An insignificant estimate of \nmeans that no inefficiency prevails. All of the error is due to random noise and\nspecification of a stochastic frontier model is inappropriate.\nWe estimate firm-specific efficiency according to Jondrow et al. (1982) and use the\nconditional expectation of uk\ngiven k\nto calculate a measure of CE as37\n[ ] .\n}\n|\n)\nexp(\n-\n=\nk\nk\nk\nu\nE\nNote an important implication of this procedure to obtain efficiency estimates with regard\nto the interpretation of individual coefficients estimated for hk\n. A positive coefficient for a\nheterogeneity variable hi\nfor bank k implies a higher mean value for the truncated\ninefficiency distribution, f(u). It, however, need not imply a higher inefficiency score for\nbank k. This is because the latter is conditional on the total error, k\n. While the effect of an\nincrease of hi\nimplies a higher mean of f(u), total error for this bank, k\n, might be\nsufficiently small to still result in a lower than mean efficiency for the individual firm. Put\ndifferently, the effect of an exogenous variable's influence on efficiency depends not only\non the influence on the truncated distribution, but also on the position (and shape) of the\ndistribution of total error. To evaluate the effect of an exogenous variable, hik\n, on\nefficiency, Kumbhakar and Lovell (2000) suggest to use the derivative of the conditional\nmean of the inefficiency term with respect to the exogenous factor, i.e. [E(uk\n|k\n)/hik\n]. In\nour result section, we are primarily interested in whether our choice of h is significant and\nhow the entirety of exogenous factors influence efficiency. Therefore, we do not\ninvestigate marginal effects but focus on differences of efficiency scores across models.\nEfficiency measures take on values between 0 and 1. The latter indicates a fully efficient\nbank. The value indicates which percentage of observed cost would have been enough to\nproduce the observed output if the bank was fully efficient. Firm-specific efficiency\nestimates further allow us to analyse if rankings are sensitive to measurement error. We\nturn next to a brief description of the employed data.\nFor the years 1993 to 2003, we use data from unconsolidated, annual balance sheets, profit\nand loss accounts and audit reports either reported to or compiled by the supervision\ndepartment of the Bundesbank. The data comprise 32,211 observations on commercial,\nsavings and cooperative banks. Table 2 depicts descriptive statistics of both variables used\nin the deterministic kernel and those accounting for heterogeneity in the error.\nVariable Name Mean Sd Min Max N\nSFA\nHeterogeneity\nNote: Reported statistics refer to data pooled over the whole period.\n1) In millions of Euro; 2) In percent; 3) In thousands of Euro; 4) In points per county; between 1 (perfect\nTwo issues in table 2 deserve attention. First, the distribution of both SFA and\nheterogeneity variables clearly illustrate the differences across firms in our sample. For\nexample, some banks only had outstanding loans on the order of some thousand Euro. In\ncontrast, the largest bank recorded a position of outstanding commercial loans worth  315\nbillion in a single year. With respect to input prices the standard deviation and extreme\n37 Similarly, a measure of PE is calculated as PEk\n=E[exp(-uk\n)|k\n]. This measure indicates the percentage of\nactual profits relative to what the bank could have realised given its input quantity and output price mix.\nvalues underline potential measurement problems. It is hard to believe that the observed\nmaxima of input prices, wi\n, accurately reflect the competitive position of a bank. Hence, an\nalternative to approximate input market prices seems warranted.\nSecond, the \"implausible\" values for input prices may be due to faulty data. Some studies\nexclude extreme observations. But Maudos et al. (2002) caution that this cure may be\nworse than the disease. They argue that any truncation point is ultimately arbitrary. Given\nthe exceptional quality of our data, our concerns of this kind are limited. Only around 150\nout of 32,211 observations exhibit input prices for fixed assets and/or borrowed funds\nabove a 100 percent.38 As a check we exclude extreme observations for a range of cut-off\npoints. Results are qualitatively not affected. This underpins the ability of stochastic\nfrontier analysis to accommodate random error appropriately for this sample.\nIn sum, a comparison of bank performance should consider measurement error, random\nnoise and heterogeneity in a more explicit manner. Consideration of random noise is at the\nvery heart of stochastic frontier analysis. We take heterogeneity into account by specifying\na range of bank-specific factors in addition to the standard production plan used in most\nstudies. To address the issue of appropriate input prices we employ our alternatives\ndiscussed above. Therefore, we turn next to our empirical results to assess the impact of\nthis measurement error on efficiency measures.\nIn this section, we present estimation results for CE and PE from models 1 through 3. First,\nwe discuss cost and, second, profit frontier estimations. For each, we compare the\nbenchmark model 1 and alternative input price models 2 and 3, respectively. Subsequently,\nwe compare efficiency results across region and banking groups. Third, we compare\nefficiency to traditional KPI, identify extreme performers and describe their characteristics.\nWe start by discussing cost estimation results, continue with an inspection of regional\ndifferences of CE and close with a CE comparison between banks from alternative sectors.\n38 Note also that around 75 percent of these extreme observations are banks located in the East. These banks\nmay enjoy special tax breaks meant to subsidise structurally weaker regions. For example, if a tax-\nminimising firm books high depreciation, this can lead to \"implausible\" prices for fixed assets because the\nnumerator of w3\nis inflated. But such a bank is certainly still in operation in the market. Therefore, it should\nbe considered in a benchmark. Exclusion may in fact bias efficiency measures as well.\nModel CE model 1 CE model 2 CE model 3\nVariable Coefficient p-value Coefficient p-value Coefficient p-value\nHeterogeneity in inefficiency\n5.1.1 Estimation results and cost efficiency\nTable 3 depicts parameter estimates for cost frontiers according to models 1 through 3. We\nemploy the cost of borrowed funds, w3\n, to impose homogeneity as in Lang and Welzel\n(1996). Most parameter estimates are significant. Due to interaction terms, the\ninterpretation of single coefficients of the deterministic kernel is not straightforward. We\ntherefore abstain from any conclusions of this kind.\nIndividual coefficients that account for heterogeneity in the inefficiency distribution, h, are\nalso significantly different from zero. Therefore, not all non-random deviations from the\nfrontier are due to the inability to employ resources in optimal proportions. Specification of\na set of explanatory variables that influence the truncated distribution of inefficiency\nimproves the fit significantly.39 But as the effect on efficiency depends ultimately on total\nerror we abstain from the interpretation of single coefficients. Instead, we concentrate on\ntwo issues. First, whether accounting for heterogeneity leaves any further systematic\ndeviations that are identified as inefficiency. Second, to assess the change in efficiency due\nto the use of alternative input prices.\nRegarding the former consider the estimate of , the ratio of the standard deviation\nattributable to inefficiency to the standard deviation due to random noise. The parameter is\nsignificantly different from zero in both the benchmark and all alternative models. We\ntherefore conclude that inefficiency prevails even after accounting for heterogeneity and\nno matter how input prices are proxied. Parameter estimates of  and  in model 1 are\nsubstantially larger compared to both alternative price models. This indicates that the\ndistribution of estimated inefficiencies is influenced by the use of alternative input prices.\nTo quantify the differences in efficiency scores, table 4 provides descriptive statistics of\nCE estimates according to the three models.\nCE Mean SD Skew Kurt Min Max N\n39 We reject a log-likelihood ratio test that all heterogeneity parameters are simultaneously equal to zero at\nthe 1% level.\nMean cost inefficiency according to model 1 is on the order of 8 percent. This is less than\nthe 20 percent often found in the literature. However, it is in line with studies that also\naccount for heterogeneity and thereby disentangle CE from random noise on the one hand,\nand other exogenous factors on the other. The standard deviation and skew in the\nbenchmark model indicate that many banks are located fairly close to the frontier.\nHowever, the performance is diverse as underlined by a difference between best- and\nworst-performing banks of 42.4 percent. We hypothesised earlier that alternative input\nprice measures affect the level and distribution of CE.\nMean CE in model 2 confirms this notion. It is five percent below the efficiency score in\nmodel 1. The difference between best- and worst-performing banks increases. This\nindicates that model 2 identifies extreme performing banks with more emphasis. At the\nsame time, alternative market price proxies locate the majority of banks close to full\nefficiency. But worst performing banks are further away from full efficiency as compared\nto the benchmark model. This explains lower industry average CE compared to the\nbenchmark case. The use of exogenous input prices seems to highlight extreme performers.\nA reason could be that in perfect markets healthy banks gravitate to market averages while\nthose banks close to market exit stand out more clearly as poor performers.\nOther studies report that large banks are less efficient than small banks. This result could\npartly be due to measurement error if these banks operate on one federal rather than on\nmultiple regional markets. In model 3, we account for this possibility and calculate input\nprice proxies accordingly. Qualitatively, the results between models 2 and 3 do not differ\nsubstantially. Mean CE slightly improves to 87.7 percent, thus being around four percent\nbelow the benchmark case.\nIn addition to altered mean efficiency levels, we find that CE rankings are affected by the\nuse of alternative input prices. Rank-order correlations between model 1 and the two\nperfectly correlated, we conclude that our alternative price proxies do not identify the same\nbanks as best and worst performers.41 We will address the issue in section 5.3. Beforehand,\nwe identify CE differences between banks of different regions and banking type.\n40 Measured by Spearman's , significant at the 1% level.\n41 Differences of CE ranks between models 2 and 3 are negligible given a rank order correlation of 98.9%.\n5.1.2 Cost efficiency across regions\nTable 5 depicts differences of mean CE for each model per state. We compare CE to the\nratio of general administrative expenses to the raw result, the CI ratio. The last line reports\na rank-sum test statistic if efficiency measures are significantly different from each other.\nTable 5: Mean cost efficiency per state\nNote: A '+' indicates eastern states.\n1) General administrative expenses to raw result, measured in percent.\n* Significant at the 1% level.\nTwo major conclusions arise. First, the CI ratio yields by and large similar rankings as CE\nmeasures. However, some differences prevail. For example, those states hosting most of\nthe small cooperative banks, Baden-Wuerttemberg and Bavaria, are according to all CE\nmeasures ranked first and second. In turn, based on the CI ratio the former state is ranked\n3rd and the latter is ranked 4th. Two potential implications arise. On the one hand, CE\nmeasures might simply be wrong and therefore useless. The ability to demand input\nquantities in correct proportions subject to prevailing prices does not matter for the\neconomic success of banks. We find this interpretation hard to believe. Alternatively,\nBauer et al. (1998) suggest that efficiency measures contain additional information\ncompared to CI ratios. For example, if increasing competition squeezes interest margins for\nall banks in the market, CI ratios naturally rise. However, how well a single bank\nconverted inputs into outputs cannot be assessed from CI ratios alone.\nThe second inference from table 5 is confirmation of an \"East\" effect. All new states yield\nmean CE significantly below the federal average. Whether this result is due to\nsystematically lower managerial skills or due to structural deficiencies not captured by a\nsimple dummy variable remains at this stage unclear.\nIn sum, western states host many top performing banks in terms of CE. Banks in eastern\nstates perform below average. CE scores may contain additional information that\ncomplement traditional KPI, such as the CI ratio.\n5.1.3 Cost efficiency across banking groups\nWe analyse next to what extent CE scores differ across banking groups. Mean CE\ndifferences between different banking groups in our three models are reported in table 6.\nTable 6: Mean cost efficiency per banking group\n1) Including large commercial banks, Postbank, Landbanks, Central cooperatives; 2) Including regional commercial\nand branches of foreign banks; 3) Cost-Income ratio general administrative expenses to raw result, measured in\npercent.\n* Significant at the 1% level.\nFor all three models the difference in means is significant. In model 1, large banks are\nlocated far away from the frontier, while for small banks the opposite holds. Average\npotential savings per bank and year are  8.9 million. Total average annual savings amount\nto  25.5 billion for all banks in our sample.42 For large banks, average CE amounts to 87.2\npercent according to model 1. Consequently, the share of foregone Euro amounts in terms\nof potential savings accrues to  15.4 billion. This implies that 60 percent of foregone\nproducer surplus originates from large banks. Note that in relative terms, i.e. by means of\nefficiency scores alone, large banks perform only 4 percent worse than the overall industry\n42 Potential cost savings per bank are calculated according to TOCSavkt\n= k\n) * TOCkt\n].\naverage. But assessing the lost Euro value reveals that the costs to society due to cost\ninefficiencies of large banks are greatest.43\nThis result is amplified when using alternative input price proxies. In model 2, large bank\nCE differences relative to savings and cooperatives widens from 15 percent in model 1 to\n19 and 21 percent, respectively. Compared to regional commercial banks, the difference is\neven inverted. In contrast to model 1, large banks suffer the most from inefficiency on the\ninput side. Lower mean industry efficiency with an over-proportionate waste identified\nwith big banks implies that annual average savings per bank increase almost by a factor 2.5\nto  22 million. Accordingly, the total of potential annual savings increase to  61.6 billion.\nThe share of potential savings for the group of large banks increases to 72 percent, equal to\n 44.5 billion. Results therefore confirm earlier findings in the literature (e.g. Altunbas et\nal., 2001) that especially large banks suffer from inefficiencies.\nModel 3 accounts for the possibility that demanded inputs differ substantially between\nbanks, e.g. due to different quality of labour demanded, by assuming single federal input\nmarkets for this group. This model alleviates the shortcomings of large commercial banks\nfound previously. While still identified as the worst performing banking group in\nGermany, CE differences relative to the federal average are reduced from 20 percent in\nmodel 2 to 13 percent in model 3. Annual average savings across all bank types are on the\norder of  17.8 million. Excessive total costs incurred compared to fully efficient use of\ninputs sum to  50.9 billion. While lower than identified inefficiencies in model 2, it is\nworth noting that the share of large banks still scores an impressive 68 percent. Therefore,\nthe conclusion that large banks are most cost inefficient is robust across all three models.\nLikewise, we find that small banks exhibit superior cost management skills.44\nIn sum, the use of alternative input prices leads to lower mean CE. From a regional angle,\nall models yield CE that (i) is significantly different across states, (ii) is lowest in eastern\nstates (and to a lesser extent city states) and (iii) yields additional information compared to\nand cooperative banks, respectively. A 10 basis point improvement in CE at an average large bank thus\nrequires approximately a 45 percent improvement in CE for an average cooperative bank.\n44 Note that some activities of large banks, e.g. custody or advisory services, may not be included sufficiently\nin the specified output vector. This could imply comparably high costs for large banks and hence to low CE.\nBut if omitted outputs cause low CE for large banks, we would expect that they exhibit above average PE as\nprofits would be comparably high without the burden of corresponding products specified in the frontier. The\nmean PE estimates across banking groups discussed in section 5.2.3 show that this is not the case. Given this\nresult in addition to our approach to adjust the frontier for heterogeneity and the consistency with the\nliterature, we are confident that our results are robust. Ideally, we are able to obtain additional data on output\nproxies to empirically test alternative production specifications in future research.\ntraditional KPI. From a bank sector angle, the evidence of all models suggests that large\nbanks suffer most from cost inefficiency. It simply matters if a small cooperative wastes 20\npercent of actual cost or if a large bank does. Note, however, that out of 231 large bank\nobservations, only 39 refer to commercial banks. The remainder are either cooperative or\nsaving banks' apex institutions or Postbank. Large commercial banks certainly did not\nexcel in terms of efficiency. But the largest share of \"wasteful\" banking business on the\ninput side occurred with large apex institutions of cooperative banks. We turn next to PE.\n5.2 Alternative profit frontier\nAlternative PE indicates the percentage of realised profits relative to profits that could have\nbeen realised. First, we provide estimation results and mean PE per model. Second, we\ndiscuss regional PE differences and, third, between banking groups.\n5.2.1 Estimation results and alternative profit efficiency\nTable 7 presents parameter estimates for the three efficient profit frontiers, respectively.\nNo estimation reached the maximum number of iterations when maximising the likelihood.\nParameter estimates of the deterministic kernel are by and large significantly different from\nzero. This implies that a stochastic profit frontier is superior to OLS. We conclude that\nprofit inefficiencies prevail, but abstain as before from the interpretation of single\ncoefficients. While substantially higher compared to the cost case, both  and  are\nsignificantly different from zero, too. We conclude that profit inefficiencies prevail and\nexpect PE to be more dispersed than CE.\nModel PE model 1 PE model 2 PE model 3\nVariable Coefficient p-value Coefficient p-value Coefficient p-value\nHeterogeneity in inefficiency\nMost parameters of the specified heterogeneity variables are also significant. The direction\nand magnitude of these effects is stable across models. As in section 5.1, we limit\nourselves to note that accounting for heterogeneity is necessary to disentangle \"managerial\ninefficiency\" from other influences. Contrary to the cost case, however, the specification of\nalternative input prices leaves the magnitude of both error and heterogeneity parameters\nlargely unaffected.45 Consequently, PE appears to be relatively insensitive to alternative\ninput price measurement.\nWe turn therefore next to an assessment of efficiency differences across models, states and\nsectors. Table 8 illustrates the similarity of PE scores for the three models employed.\nPE Mean SD Skew Kurt Min Max N\nMean alternative PE is substantially lower compared to CE, around 65 percent. An average\nbank could have realised a third more profits relative to actually accrued profits. In relative\nterms, profit outweighs cost inefficiency. Regarding the distribution of PE most banks are\nno longer located close to the frontier. Many banks are far below best practice behaviour.\nAlso, the distribution of PE hardly changes across models. Consequently, sub-optimal\nbehaviour on the input side is of lesser importance for PE. Most of the estimated profit\ninefficiencies seem to arise from sub-optimal output choices.\nStandard deviations and extreme values further indicate that the dispersion of PE is larger\ncompared to CE. Best and worst performing firms differ by as much as 70 percent.\nPotentially, this larger difference is due to a higher volatility of earnings compared to\ncosts.46 To this end, we investigated whether poor performers in one year tended to be\ngood performers in another. This is not the case \u00ad banks exhibiting a poor ability to realise\ntheir chances in output markets do so consistently over time. Thus, the fundamental ability\nof banks to realise profits is more diverse compared to CE.\n45 For example, neither  nor  vary much. We observe only a slight improvement of  in models 2 and 3.\nTherefore, the explanatory power benefits only marginally from our alternative input price proxies.\n46 Consider as an example two banks that engage in riskier production plans. Let the two banks speculate on\nforeign exchange appreciation and depreciation, respectively. Depending on what \"bet\" materialises, this\nyields one very profit-efficient and one markedly inefficient bank. In contrast, on the expense side of the\nincome statement, interest rates, wages and rents are specified in contracts and are therefore less volatile.\n5.2.2 Alternative profit efficiency across regions\nTo examine the geographical pattern of PE, consider table 9 below. Alternative mean PE\nlevels are more stable across specifications compared to CE. Also, all states are ranked\nalmost identically. The distortion of PE due to measurement error seems negligible. At the\nsame time, regional differences of both PE measures and KPI ratios are significant. 47\nTable 9: Mean alternative profit efficiency per state\nNote: A '+' indicates eastern states.\n1) Profit before tax over equity, measured in percent; 2) Profit before tax over gross total assets, measured in percent; 3) Interest\nincome less interest expenses over gross total assets, measured in percent.\n* Significant at the 1% level.\nThe negative \"East\" effect identified for the cost frontier is inverted. By and large,\nestimated PE of banks located in eastern states is higher compared to western\ncompetitors.48 However, a more differentiated view is warranted. Of the five new states\n(excluding Berlin for now), Brandenburg, Saxony and Thuringia are ranked the top three in\nterms of alternative PE. The two remaining eastern states, Mecklenburg-Western\nPomerania and Saxony-Anhalt, perform only mediocrely with a mean PE of around 65\npercent. Thus, it may be overly simplistic to refer to \"the East\".\n47 As in section 5.1, we provide here the comparison to traditional accounting-based performance indicators.\n48 This contradicts results obtained from a predecessor study based on Bankscope data. There, we concluded\nthat further studies need to incorporate systematic differences, e.g. macroeconomic conditions. In this study,\nwe adjust the benchmark frontier for factors causing heterogeneity. As inference changes substantially, we\nonce more underline the necessity to account for exogenous factors in efficiency studies.\nWith respect to the additional information contained in PE estimates relative to KPI we\nfind that a number of states are assigned similar rankings by all measures in table 9.49 But\nas in the cost case some differences exist. For example, ROE and ROA rank eastern states\ndifferently. Thus, our previous conclusion that efficiency measures contain additional\ninformation is underlined.\nNext, we discuss systematic PE differences across banking groups and link inefficiency\nscores to Euro amounts of foregone profits.\n5.2.3 Alternative profit efficiency across banking groups\nMean PE estimates suggested that alternative input price proxies do not matter much. We\nargue in table 10 that it might indeed matter especially if large banks are affected.\nTable 10: Mean alternative profit efficiency across banking groups\nBanking Group Model 1 Model 2 Model 3 ROE 3) ROA 4) Margin 5) N\n1) Including large commercial banks, Postbank, Landbanks, central cooperatives; 2) Including regional commercial and branches of\nforeign banks; 3) Profit before tax over equity, measured in percent; 4) Profit before tax over gross total assets, measured in percent;\n5) Interest income less interest expenses over gross total assets, measured in percent\n* Significant at the 1% level.\nTable 10 illustrates that mean PE of large banks improves when alternative input prices are\nused in models 2 and 3 compared to the benchmark model. It is possible that especially the\nlatter model grasps quality differences of inputs between large, nationally operating banks\nand small regional institutes more appropriately. Nonetheless, despite improvements of 4.4\nand 1.5 percent, respectively, large banks exhibit the worst PE measures in all models.\nOpportunity costs of foregone profits are highest for large banks. These account for 57\npercent of total annual potential savings of  22.7 billion (i.e.  13 billion).50 Annual\nprofits foregone for the average bank are  6.8 million. In comparison, the equivalent value\nfor large banks stood at  623 million. As with wasted cost savings, improvements in large\n49 Examples are the states Saarland, Schleswig-Holstein and Berlin.\n50 We calculate total annual profits forgone according to the sum of optimal profits for each bank less the sum\nof actually realised profits, i.e. kt\n(PBTkt\n/ PEkt\n- PBTkt\n).\nbank PE thus entail the largest gains due to (i) the highest relative inefficiency and (ii) the\nlargest volume of potentially foregone producer surplus.51\nIn sum, the differences between relative inefficiency scores (8.5% cost versus 35.3% profit\ninefficiency) are put into perspective when absolute amounts of potential savings are\nexamined. Then, the absolute savings potential in terms of foregone profits is of a similar\norder compared to excessive costs ( 25.5 billion cost vs.  22.7 billion profit savings). To\nobtain a complete picture of performance, we should therefore assess absolute savings, too.\nA remaining matter of interest is to gauge similarities and differences of identified extreme\nperforming banks according to the various alternative indicators discussed so far.\n5.3 Comparing efficiency\nFirst, we compare CE and PE with each other and to traditional KPI. Second, we\ninvestigate the degree to which the three efficiency models identify similar (or different)\nextreme performers. Third, we turn our attention to these groups' respective characteristics.\n5.3.1 Efficiency and accounting based KPI\nTable 11 below depicts correlation coefficients between our six efficiency measures and\nthe various KPI displayed throughout. In line with Bauer et al. (1998), correlation\ncoefficients between KPI and both CE and PE estimates are low and exhibit only miniscule\nchanges across the three different SFA models.52\nTable 11: Correlation between efficiency and KPI\nNote: All correlation coefficients significant at the 1% level.\n1) General administrative expenses to raw result; 2) Profit before tax over equity; 3) Profit\nbefore tax over gross assets; 4) Interest income less interest expenses over gross total assets.\n51 Note in line with footnote 44 that large banks exhibit the lowest PE despite earning profits with products\nand services that may not be explicitly accounted for in the production plan, e.g. custody and advisory\nservices. In line with the argument raised earlier, we therefore regard our CE and PE results as robust.\n52 It is also well known that CE and PE are weakly correlated as they measure different sorts of efficiency.\nIn the upper panel of table 11, correlation coefficients between CE and KPI ratios are low.\nPotentially, this reflects that traditional KPI can suffer from influences due to accounting\nand reporting rules.53 This is in line with our interpretation that CE conveys additional\ninformation compared to traditional KPI.\nThe middle panel displays correlation coefficients between PE measures and KPI.\nMagnitudes are low, especially between the CI ratio and PE. With respect to profitability\nmeasures, correlations are higher. Yet, they are far from perfect. We conclude therefore\nthat PE measures also contain additional information.\nThe lower panel underpins that already within the group of traditional KPI correlation is\nlow. For example, the correlation coefficient between the CI ratio and the net interest\nmargin is close to zero. Also note that the former KPI is positively correlated with e.g.\nROA and ROE. But intuitively we would expect a profitable bank to be cost efficient, too.\nApparently, alternative accounting based KPI already contain different information.\nIn line with Bauer et al (1998) we conclude that multiple indicators convey different\ninformation. Not only the correlation between efficiency measures and KPI is low. Also,\ncorrelation between various traditional KPI is low. Therefore, low correlation between CE,\nPE and KPI is per se no reason to discard efficiency measures as an indicator. Instead,\nefficiency may be useful as a complementary KPI.54 We turn next to the influence of\nalternative input prices on the identification of extreme performers.\n5.3.2 Identification of extreme performers\nUsually, we are less interested in identifying a single \"winner\" or \"loser\". Rather, we like\nto identify groups of top and flop performers. Hence, we investigate how alternative input\nprice proxies affect the composition of the highest and lowest performing deciles of banks.\nTo this end, consider table 12. We compare on the basis of CE and PE how banks in the\nbest and worst deciles of model 1 are re-ranked when input prices are measured differently.\nThese two cohorts are referred to as top and flop deciles, respectively. We report the decile\ndistribution of both cohorts according to model 2 and 3, respectively.\n53 For example, special depreciation rules to subsidise regions or industries may result in \"extreme\" KPI.\n54 It is beyond the scope of this study to qualify the importance of this additional information. However,\nKoetter et al. (2004) find that efficiency is a significant determinant of distressed and non-distressed mergers.\nTable 12: Frequency distribution of top and flop banks across models\nDecile Ranking according to model 2 Ranking according to model 3\nTop model 1 Flop model 1 Top model 1 Flop model 1\nNote: Frequencies in percent.\nThe left panel in table 12 compares the distribution of top and flop performers in model 1\nacross efficiency rank deciles of model 2. The best performing banks according to model 1\nare depicted in the first two columns. Between 74 (CE) and 94 (PE) percent of banks\nidentified as role models in the traditional model are identically identified as top\nperformers when alternative input prices are used. This result indicates that efficiency\nstudies using implicit prices arrive at similar conclusions for the majority of banks.\nHowever, note that a quarter of those banks formerly regarded as potential role models\nregarding CE are now re-ranked in decile eight or below. Most importantly, approximately\n2 percent of all identified CE top performers are ranked diametrically opposed in deciles\none and two. Such drastic re-classifications are absent for PE rankings. This confirms that\nPE is hardly affected by alternative input prices.\nBanks with the worst efficiency scores under traditional SFA analysis are compared to\nmodel 2 in the third and fourth columns of the left-hand side panel. The cumulative share\nof identically identified flop performers in deciles one and two is even higher, ranging\nbetween 92 (CE) and 98 (PE) percent. One percent of banks switch into the best\nperforming CE deciles nine and ten after adjusting for implicit input prices. Changed\nidentification of top and flop performers is again limited to CE rankings.\nIn the right-hand panel, we conduct the same comparison for models 1 and 3. The\nimplications are qualitatively identical. For both top and flop performers, the cumulative\nshare of banks located in deciles nine and ten under the two models ranges between 74 and\n98 percent. We can confirm that cost efficiency rankings are most sensitive to input price\nspecification. Approximately two percent of former role model banks are re-classified\nunder model 3 and the cumulative share for former trouble banks is again one percent.\nIn sum, the cumulative share of banks that are re-classified diametrically different as PE\ntop and flop performers across models is very low. But based on CE, around 1-2 percent of\nformer top (flop) performers are now worst (best) in class.\n5.3.3 Characteristics of extreme performers\nBecause the use of alternative input prices affects CE especially, we limit our attention in\ntable 13 to top and flop performers according to cost models.\nTable 13: Characteristics of top and flop performers based on CE across models\nModel 1 Model 2 Model 3 Population\nFlop * Top* Flop * Top* Flop * Top*\nNote: Based on cost efficiency ranking for models 1 through 3, respectively.\n1) Including large commercial banks, Postbank, Landbanks, central cooperatives; 2) Including regional commercial and\nbranches of foreign banks; +) Formerly East Germany; a) Measured in millions of Euro; b) Between 1 for perfect competition\nand 10,000 for monopoly; c) Average Basel risk weight.\n* Frequencies in percentages.\nIn the first panel, we compare relative frequencies of top and flop performers across\nmodels and banking groups. The rightmost column depicts throughout population\nrepresentation. We find evidence that large banks are relatively often in the group of worst\nperformers and never a member of the top performer group according to our alternative\nmodels. To a lesser extent, savings banks exhibit the same over- and under-representation\nin the top and flop performer groups, respectively. Both alternative models amplify the\nindication that especially cooperative banks are role models regarding CE.\nIn the second panel, we inspect the geographical representation. Only the states of Baden-\nWuerttemberg and Bavaria simultaneously host relatively many top and relatively few flop\nbanks, respectively. All eastern states suffer from a relative abundance of poorly\nperforming banks and an absence of top performers. Average cost inefficiency in the East\nis thus higher even after accounting for less favourable economic conditions. Small city\nstates host only marginally more good banks compared to their population representation.\nAt the same time, they are home to too many worst performers. Potentially, a more limited\ngeographical scope to demand inputs restricts the cost management abilities of these banks.\nCharacteristics in terms of heterogeneity variables reveal that top decile banks are small.\nWorst performers are larger than the average bank. These differences are amplified when\nalternative input price models are used. Both groups operate in local markets with a higher\nconcentration than the average county in Germany. The mean HHI for top performers in\nmodels 2 and 3, though, is almost twice as high as for banks in the top decile.\nConsequently, some concentration is not per se an impediment to high CE. But beyond a\ncertain level, the lack of market discipline entails that managers forego cost savings. Our\nmeasure of risk-taking, RISK, indicates that top performers choose an asset composition\nclose to average risk. This implies that on average the successful bank did not venture into\nparticularly risky business. In turn, too little risk-taking did not yield a successful strategy\nin terms of CE, either. The flop decile average shows that poorly performing banks exhibit\nan average risk weight around 9 percentage points below the population mean for all three\nmodels. Finally, our proxy for the degree of active risk management, the volume of OBS,\nindicates that top banks engaged less in OBS activities. The opposite holds for poor\nperformers. The results regarding a bank's approach to risk suggest that a passive strategy\nof choosing assets close to average risk is most beneficial for banks that aim at high CE.\nIn the fourth panel, we compare mean KPI of the two groups. A CI I ratio that is higher for\ntop compared to flop performers is counterintuitive. However, it is in line with the positive\ncorrelation coefficient between CI and ROE and ROA found previously. Profitability\nmeasures ROA and ROE lead to clearer conclusions. In all three models top performers\nexhibit substantially lower returns compared to both top performers and the overall mean.\nThe divergence between tops and flops further increases when alternative input prices are\nused. Profitability KPI and CE therefore do not necessarily contradict each other when\nidentifying best and worst in class banks. Furthermore, alternative input prices help to\ncarve out best and worst in class performers in a clearer fashion.\n6 Conclusion\nIn this paper, we analyse the direction and magnitude of a measurement error inherent in\nmost bank efficiency studies. Despite the assumption of perfect markets and, thus,\nexogenous input prices, most analyses employ bank-specific prices for labour, fixed assets\nand borrowed funds when estimating cost and profit efficiency. Based on regional factor\nmarkets, we suggest two approaches to obtain alternative input price proxies.\nOur sample covers all German savings, cooperative and commercial banks between 1993\nand 2003. To take the substantial degree of heterogeneity across banks into consideration,\nwe distinguish explicitly between deviations from optimal costs and profits due to sub-\noptimal production and those caused by additional factors, such as bank sector, region of\noperation, asset risk, size and local bank market conditions. Our main findings are six-fold.\nFirst, after accounting for heterogeneity the use of alternative input price proxies affects\nmean CE especially. On average, cost inefficiency is around 5 percent higher compared to\ntraditional input prices. In turn, PE is hardly affected. Only the group of large banks yields\nimprovements of PE on the order of 1.5 to 4.4 percent.\nSecond, our findings confirm results from the literature that in relative terms mean CE\ndominates mean PE. The former is around 92 percent while the latter is around 65 percent.\nHowever, this seemingly stark difference is put into perspective when the associated\nabsolute Euro amounts of foregone cost savings and profits are investigated. These are\nfairly equal to each other at  25.5 billion and  22.7 billion, respectively. Therefore, the\nanalysis of unrealised profits and forfeited cost savings yields important insights.\nThird, in terms of CE small banks operating in large western states constitute top\nperformers in German banking. Large banks and those located in eastern states are worst in\nclass, the latter exhibiting CE 15 to 18 percent below the federal average. We find that\nlarger size, more risky assets, active risk management and higher market concentration all\nlead to above frontier cost. These characteristics of top and flop performers are amplified\nwhen using alternative input prices.\nFourth, in terms of PE small banks are also among the best performing banks while their\nlarge competitors continue to be worst in class. In contrast to CE, however, those banks\nlocated in the East are on average more profit efficient than banks operating in the West in\ngeneral and in city states in particular.\nFifth, we confirm previous findings in the literature that both efficiency measures are only\nweakly correlated with traditional KPI. We interpret this result accordingly to imply that\nefficiency measures contain information complementary to accounting based indicators.\nFinally, the use of alternative input prices does not only affect efficiency levels but also,\nperhaps even more importantly, efficiency rankings. PE rankings are fairly stable across\nmodels. But around 2 percent of traditionally identified CE top and flop performers are\nreclassified diametrically opposed as flop and top performers, respectively, when\nemploying alternative input prices.\nIn sum, the use of alternative input prices complements and strengthens previous German\nefficiency studies. Our results suggest that regional information is an important ingredient\nin SFA. Explicitly accounting for heterogeneity is key for future studies. Despite doing so\nwe still find systematic deviations that seem to arise due to sub-optimal input use. Future\nextensions may therefore follow either of the following two approaches. First, to model\ninput markets explicitly, estimate equilibrium prices directly and combine such results with\nefficiency research. Second, to further detail the production technology of banks as to\ninclude, for example, custody and advisory services. This would enable us to analyse if\nlarge bank inefficiency is primarily the result of fundamentally different production\nprocesses or whether it is simply more difficult to manage large organizations efficiently.\nReferences\nAigner, D.
