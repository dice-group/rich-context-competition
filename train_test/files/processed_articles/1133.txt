We explore the potential of the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program to reduce poverty among\nelderly women. We develop a methodological framework that compares how well various reform proposals are targeted to\nreducing poverty among elderly women.\nMethods. Using a microsimulation model and survey data matched to SSI administrative records, we model the effects\nof eight alternative policies on current and potential SSI recipients. We develop an evaluation methodology that\nsystematically compares poverty outcomes, using multiple measures of effectiveness, at given levels of program\nexpansion.\nResults. All but two of the SSI reforms are clearly more target efficient at various degrees of simulated program\nexpansion than popular proposals to reform Social Security. For a given cost increase, modifying the SSI asset test is the\nmost effective option for reducing severe poverty among elderly women, but several reforms of the SSI income test are\nalso highly effective.\nDiscussion. The SSI program is target efficient in providing a broad safety net to economically vulnerable elderly\nwomen. The relationship between SSI and Social Security and the relationship between the SSI asset and income tests\nhave to be reevaluated to make the program more effective and appropriate to changing household structure and work\npatterns among the elderly population.\nPOVERTY has declined among the elderly population over\nthe past 30 years, but the rate for elderly women remains\nalmost twice as high as that for men. Factors contributing to\nlower Social Security benefits and higher poverty among\nelderly women include lower lifetime earnings, the breakdown\nof the nuclear family, fewer years spent in the labor force,\nrelatively long life expectancy, lower likelihood of receiving\npension income, and lower financial net worth. In addition,\nelderly women are less likely to be married than elderly men\nand more likely to be widowed or divorced. The death of\na husband is followed by a decline in living standards and\nsubstantial reductions in wealth (Hurd & Wise, 1987). Other\ndevelopments may increase the risk of poverty among elderly\nwomen in the future. The ongoing secular shift from defined\nbenefit plans to defined contribution plans means that re-\ntirement income is increasingly vulnerable to market risk and\nbeing cashed out upon job change. Social Security reform pro-\nposals involving individual accounts could add an additional\nelement of market risk.\nThe progressive benefit formula embedded in the Social\nSecurity system involves a redistribution of income from men\nto women; however, a large part of these transfers are within\nfamilies and thus do not generally accrue to poor women\n(Gustman & Steinmeier, 2000). Because of this, it is difficult\nfor Social Security reform proposals to target benefits to the\npoor elderly population or poor elderly women. Anzick and\nWeaver (2001) look at five popular reform proposals focusing\non the widow(er) benefit and enhancing Social Security's\nspecial minimum benefit. They estimated that only 14% to 37%\nof new government spending would go toward the reduction of\npoverty. Other proposals involve reallocating Social Security\nbenefits from couples to surviving widows (Burkhauser &\nbut they do not address the increasingly large group of never\nmarried elderly women. An unintended side effect of this type\nof reform is the loss of Supplemental Security Income (SSI)\nbenefits (and Medicaid) for some widows (Kijakazi & Primus,\nThe SSI program, by contrast, can target benefits to poor\nelderly people generally and poor elderly women specifically\nquite efficiently. Conceived as a scaled-down negative in-\ncome tax program focusing on the ``deserving poor,'' it is\na particularly important source of income for economically\nvulnerable women. Elderly people in poverty receive approx-\nimately 78% of all SSI benefits to the elderly population. Of\nthese benefits, 75% go to elderly women (considerably more\nthan half of all benefits paid to elderly people). This reflects the\npopulation share of poor elderly women relative to all poor\nelderly people (76%), as well as demographic and economic\nfactors related to economic vulnerability among elderly women.\nAlthough SSI appears to be highly target efficient, only 34% of\nelderly women in poverty received SSI in 1998 (all figures are\nour calculations from the Survey of Income and Program\nParticipation).\nCan the SSI program be used to further reduce poverty\namong elderly women? The means-tested nature and the track\nrecord of the SSI program suggest that it can; however, the\npotential is limited by the structure of the program. The federal\nSSI income guarantee is at a subpoverty level--$552 for\nbring the total above the poverty level in only a minority of\nstates. In addition, the asset test cuts off SSI benefits (and often\neligibility for Medicaid), even for individuals with no other\ncountable income, at an arguably low level: $2,000 for\nJournal of Gerontology: SOCIAL SCIENCES In the public domain\nindividuals and $3,000 for couples. These cutoffs are not\nindexed to inflation, resulting in increasingly stringent criteria\nin real terms. Another limiting feature of the SSI program is that\nassets and income are treated differently, yet elderly people\noften trade assets for income through annuities.\nAlthough the SSI program appears to be highly target\nefficient, it is unable to alleviate a large portion of poverty\namong elderly women. Both of these factors suggest excel-\nlent potential for SSI reform as a tool of further reducing pov-\nerty. However, it is not immediately obvious what kind of\nSSI reform is most target efficient and consistent with the\ndemographic and economic trends of the 21st century. How\nshould SSI handle Social Security reform proposals with\nunintended negative effects on SSI eligibility, such as proposals\nwith a defined contribution component that could disqualify\nextremely poor people from SSI (Kijakazi & Primus, 2000)?\nDoes it make sense to have an income guarantee that is re-\nlatively higher for couples than for elderly individuals living\nalone, while imposing a ``marriage penalty'' because cohabiting\ncouples are treated as if they were individuals living alone?\nWe present and implement a new methodology that should\nbe of help in considering the relative merits of alternative SSI\nreforms. The cornerstone of our methodology is a cost-\nequivalent comparison of alternative reform proposals and the\nuse of a coherent set of measures to evaluate poverty outcomes.\nThese features improve upon past studies in two ways. First, the\ncost of alternative reform proposals differs widely, making it\nimpossible to say whether a costly intervention that reduces\npoverty substantially is more or less effective than an\ninexpensive alternative that reduces poverty less. (See the wide\narray of differences in cost and poverty reduction outcomes in\n1989.) Second, the use of outcome measures is ad hoc and\nvaries across studies. Given the inherent arbitrariness of\naggregating individual welfare, it is more honest to provide\na multidimensional view of poverty outcomes than to favor\na single measure that is not inherently superior to other meas-\nures of distributional outcomes. We draw on a large literature\non poverty measurement, particularly the seminal work of Sen\nWe present a set of SSI policy simulations involving reform\nproposals affecting both eligibility and benefits. Our results\nand discussion provide a useful step toward understanding the\npotential role of SSI in improving the safety net for elderly\nwomen while considering program cost and spending efficiency.\nMETHODS\nTo be eligible for SSI, individuals must have limited assets\nand limited monthly income. Individuals must also be cat-\negorically eligible based on age (65 or older) or disability. To\nbe asset eligible for SSI, countable assets must be below the\ncouples. Countable assets typically exclude the equity value\nof one automobile and the value of the primary residence (if\nowned). To be income eligible for SSI, countable income must\nbe below the applicable federal benefit rate (FBR) for the\nindividual or couple. The first $20 of unearned monthly income\nis excluded from countable income based on the general in-\ncome exclusion rules. If unearned income is less than $20, the\nexclusion (or remainder) applies to earned income. The earned\nincome exclusion provides for the exclusion of an additional\n$65 of monthly earned income and half of earned income in\nexcess of the exclusion(s). Following these calculations, the\nfederal SSI benefit is equal to the difference between the FBR\nand countable income.\nPolicy Interventions Tested\nModifications of the federal benefit rate (FBR). --The FBR is\nthe amount of benefits (income guarantee) provided to an\nindividual or couple with no countable income. The FBR is\nindexed to inflation and is separately established for individuals\nand couples. The FBR, in itself, does not provide poverty level\nincome.\nThe first intervention, increasing the FBR, would affect all\nbeneficiaries and would make some individuals and couples\nwith low assets but incomes above the current FBR eligible for\na small benefit (and Medicaid). Because it affects beneficiaries\nacross the board, relatively small increases in the FBR may\nresult in substantial increases in program cost.\nCurrently, the FBR for couples is 150% of the FBR for\nindividuals. This is substantially higher than the official poverty\nline for a two-person family relative to a family of one. The\nsecond policy intervention would increase the FBR for in-\ndividuals only. Because women tend to outlive their husbands\nand the proportion of widows is high among elderly women,\nthis approach should allocate a large proportion of additional\nprogram funds to single elderly women.\nModifications of the general income exclusion (GIE). --The\nGIE applies to the first $20 of income. Any unearned income\nbeyond $20 is offset by an equivalent benefit reduction. The\nGIE is not indexed to inflation; therefore, its value has eroded\nover time. The low value of the GIE is consistent with the social\nsafety net nature of the SSI program. However, this results in\nthe lack of recognition of past work efforts that may be reflected\nin Social Security payments.\nThe third intervention involves increasing the GIE. Without\nother changes, increasing the GIE would not affect the SSI\nbenefits of elderly individuals with no countable income, who\nrepresent the poorest segment of SSI's target population. It\nwould increase the benefits of current elderly SSI beneficiaries\nwith income above the GIE limit, and it would make some\npeople eligible who are currently ineligible because of high\nincome.\nAs an alternative to the GIE intervention, a fourth in-\ntervention creates a Social Security income exclusion while\nleaving the GIE for sources other than Social Security unaf-\nfected. This intervention targets additional resources on those\nelderly people who have Social Security income, and it pro-\nvides higher benefits to those who have higher Social Security\nincomes. The rationale is that past work effort reflected in\nSocial Security benefits should be rewarded. In addition, the\napproach can be partly justified by the administrative simplicity\nof accounting for Social Security income.\nModifications of the earned income exclusion (EIE). --Under\ncurrent SSI rules, any remainder of the GIE after consideration\nof unearned income can be used to exclude earned income. The\nEIE provides for the exclusion of an additional $65 of earned\nincome, along with 50% of any remaining earned income. The\nfifth and sixth interventions increase the $65 earned income\nexclusion and reduce the 50% earned income tax rate, respec-\ntively. Because labor force participation among the elderly\npopulation tends to be low under current conditions, these\ninterventions are expected to have only modest effects.\nModifications of the asset test. --The asset rules are justified\non the grounds that SSI provides a safety net of last resort;\npeople with assets should spend them before turning to public\nassistance. Nevertheless, people with no or limited income may\nbe ineligible if countable assets exceed the thresholds.\nThe SSI asset test has been criticized on several grounds. The\ncurrent SSI asset test provides a strong incentive to spend down\nassets (Neumark & Powers, 1998) and eliminates the ability of\nrecipients to preserve a fund for emergencies. In addition, it\ntreats individuals differently depending on the form of their\nretirement savings. A person with a given level of income\nmight qualify for SSI if the source of income is Social Security\nor an annuity, but this person might not qualify if the income\nsource is an individual retirement account, a savings account, or\nan investment that can produce an equivalent income stream.\nAs Kijakazi and Primus (2000) noted, this could become\na major barrier to SSI participation as defined-contribution\nplans grow in popularity and under Social Security reform\nscenarios involving mandatory individual accounts.\nThe seventh intervention involves increasing the asset\nthreshold. It preserves the current program approach in which\nthe couple asset threshold is equal to 150% of the individual\nasset threshold. This intervention does not change the benefits\nor income of people who already qualify for SSI, but it allows\npeople with low income and modest assets to qualify for SSI.\nThus, this intervention might substantially increase the income\nof some of the poorest elderly.\nThe final intervention would transform the asset test into\nan integral part of the SSI income determination process, based\non the notion that assets can be seen as equivalent to the in-\ncome they are capable of producing. While formally eliminat-\ning the asset test, the intervention would create an income debit\nthat counts x% of countable assets against the income test.\nThe value of x can be theoretically justified or empirically\ndetermined. This intervention has similar properties as the\nprevious one, except that it eliminates the discrete jump from\nbenefits to no benefits associated with the asset threshold\nand allows people with much higher asset levels to qualify\nfor SSI.\nData\nThe SSI eligibility and participation models are based on the\n1990 panel of the Survey of Income and Program Participation\n(SIPP) matched to administrative data from the Social Security\nAdministration (SSA). All estimates pertain to the 1991 non-\ninstitutionalized U.S. population. The SIPP provides detailed\ndata on the sources and amounts of monthly income and as-\nsets, which are crucial to the estimation of SSI eligibility. We\nalso utilize detailed SIPP data on demographic characteristics\nand household composition. We replace survey measures of\nSSI participation and benefits with SSA administrative data,\nwhich are of high quality as a result of their central role in the\nadministration of the SSI program (Huynh, Rupp, & Sears,\nEligibility and Participation Models\nWe focus on all elderly individuals who meet the SSI income\nand asset eligibility criteria. For individuals who live with their\nspouse, SSI eligibility also depends on the resources and in-\ncome of the spouse. Consequently, we use the characteristics of\n``family units'' rather than individual characteristics per se to\nestimate SSI financial eligibility.\nWe develop a probit model to estimate SSI participation for\nSSI-eligible elderly units. We derive the dependent variable,\nSSI participation status, from SSA administrative records. All\nother variables are taken from the SIPP. Following McGarry\n(1996), the principal determinant of SSI participation is the\nexpected SSI benefit. Following Davies and colleagues (2002),\nwe define expected SSI benefits as the sum of the potential\nfederal SSI benefit calculated by the SSI eligibility model, plus\nthe maximum state SSI supplement. Other covariates include\ndemographic and economic characteristics of the unit head,\nsuch as age, gender, race or ethnicity, marital status, educa-\ntional attainment, home ownership, place of birth (United\nStates or elsewhere), U.S. citizenship, and health. We use\naverage state Medicaid expenditures on SSI recipients to\napproximate the effect of Medicaid on SSI participation. A\nvector of state dummy variables is included to control for un-\nmeasured state-specific effects on SSI participation.\nSimulation Methodology\nWe estimate participation probabilities under the new\nprogram rules by applying the coefficients from the baseline\nparticipation model to the characteristics of eligibles under the\nnew program rules. Base-case and simulation-case estimates\nof the number of participants are derived by summing the\nestimated participation probabilities across all eligible elderly\nwomen using sample weights.\nThe cornerstone of our methodology is a computationally\nfeasible, iterative method of running a large number of\nsimulations that converge upon a specified cost target. The\nparameter values from the simulations thus support compar-\nisons of cost-equivalent policy alternatives. For example, if we\nare considering a 5% increase in program costs to be achieved\nby adjusting the FBR, the simulation iterates over potential\nvalues of the FBR until a value is found that is expected to\ngenerate a 5% increase in program cost. The same process and\ncost target is used for all other simulated changes to the SSI\nprogram parameters, thus producing a grid of cost-equivalent\noutcomes that can be compared against each other in a con-\nsistent fashion.\nThe simulations use a search algorithm to find the\nappropriate parameter values. The input is a predetermined\nlevel of program cost; the output is the value of the program\nparameter of interest, such as the FBR. The algorithm computes\nthe simulated cost based on an initial guess of the parameter\nvalue and compares it with the predetermined target program\ncost. Then, the algorithm makes a linear adjustment to the pa-\nrameter based on these two data points (the base case and the\nguess) and repeats the process. Specifically, the change in the\nparameter is computed to make the ratio of the desired change\nin the parameter (base case to target) to the actual change in the\nparameter (base case to guess) equal the ratio of the desired\nchange in cost (base case to target cost level) to the actual\nchange in cost (base case to guess). When the simulated cost is\nwithin $100,000 of the target cost, the algorithm accepts the\nparameter value and the iteration ceases. The $100,000 value\nrepresents 0.05% of baseline program costs.\nThe results we present focus specifically on poverty effects\nfor elderly women; however, cost-equivalent policy changes are\nidentified by considering program cost effects for all elderly\nindividuals, including men. We have chosen this approach\nbecause we do not envision any of the policy alternatives to be\napplied to women only. We consider the robustness of our\nresults with respect to gender, and we argue that final policy\ndecisions should be made based on a consideration of the\neffects on both men and women. We also note that the poverty\nmeasures we report do not focus specifically on elderly women\nwho participate in the SSI program. Rather, the base for the\npoverty measures is the sample of all elderly women. Although\nthe SSI program has a large and increasing component target-\ning nonelderly disabled people (including children), in this ar-\nticle we focus on the elderly population alone. It would be\nworthwhile to address the robustness of our results with respect\nto the nonelderly population and to reassess whether uniform\nfinancial eligibility rules make sense for the elderly and\ndisabled components of the SSI program. However, the dis-\nability component of the program raises complex measurement\nand analytic issues that merit a separate study. Our focus here is\non the role of SSI reform in alleviating poverty among elderly\nwomen.\nOur methodology makes a number of simplifying assump-\ntions. Consistent with previous studies (Davies et al., 2002;\nMcGarry, 2002), the model is static, does not incorporate\npotential behavioral effects of the interventions, and assumes\nthat all changes occur instantaneously. The possibility of long-\nterm behavioral changes would be most likely in the context of\nincentives for spending down assets or increasing work\nbehavior, particularly in the 20% cost increase simulations.\nFor the 1%, 3%, and 5% cost increase simulations, we do not\nexpect behavioral effects to be of significant concern. Our esti-\nmates are conditional on the characteristics of the population\nunderlying the simulations. The effects of the policy changes\nmay be altered in the future if, for example, the size and\ncomposition of the target population change. In addition, we\ndo not model the potentially complex interactions between\nthe federal SSI program and state SSI supplements or other\nprograms such as Food Stamps and Medicaid. The interven-\ntions examined by Zedlewski and Meyer (1989) generally\nresult in trivial effects on Food Stamp expenditures. Medicaid\nis likely to be the most important element of non-SSI cost\nassociated with the policy interventions we test. Finally, we\nnote that the estimated outcomes are subject to uncertainty\nresulting from both sampling error and errors in predictions of\nparticipation.\nPoverty Measures\nGiven the inherent arbitrariness of aggregating individual\nwelfare, we provide a multidimensional view of poverty\noutcomes rather than focusing on a single measure that is not\nunambiguously superior to other available measures. We mea-\nsure the poverty-reducing effects of each potential interven-\ntion based on the Foster, Greer, and Thorbecke (1984) class of\npoverty measures. The general formulation of the Foster, Greer,\nand Thorbecke (FGT) class of indices is\n\u00bc\nn\nX\nq\nzi\n\u00ff yi\nzi\n \na\nwhere zi\nis the poverty threshold (adjusted for family size), yi\nis\nthe income of the ith observation, n is the number of individuals\nin the population, and q is the number of poor individuals in the\npopulation (i.e., individuals for whom yi\n, zi\n). We use three\nspecial cases:\n[ poverty rate (a \u00bc 0),\n[ normalized poverty gap (a \u00bc 1), and\n[ FGT index (a \u00bc 2).\nOne advantage of the FGT class of indices is that, although\nthe choice of a is somewhat arbitrary, the formulation of the\nindices is explicit. Moreover, the parameter a represents\npoverty aversion. For a \u00bc 2, greater weight is given to the\npoorest poor relative to those who are only slightly below the\npoverty threshold (Foster et al., 1984).\nEach poverty measure described here has strengths and\nlimitations. The poverty rate measures the proportion of a\npopulation with incomes below the official poverty threshold.\nThe change in the poverty rate reflects only movements across\nthe poverty line and is not sensitive to increases (or decreases)\nthat occur in the income of the poor below the poverty line.\nThe poverty gap is the difference between the official U.S.\npoverty threshold and family income, summed across all\nelderly women below the poverty threshold. It can be in-\nterpreted as the minimum amount of money needed to elim-\ninate poverty, assuming no behavioral changes. Although it\ncaptures the overall magnitude of poverty in a given population,\nthe poverty gap ignores the severity of poverty by giving equal\nweight to a change in income for individuals just below the\npoverty line and individuals with the lowest incomes.\nindex is a poverty index that accounts for income\ninequality among the poor. It provides greater weight to poverty\namong the poorest poor, and the index value is comparatively\nlow for interventions that aid those at the bottom of the income\ndistribution. Although the choice of a\u00bc 2 for the FGT2\nindex is\narbitrary, it has the advantage of being mathematically related\nto the poverty rate and poverty gap. Any value of a . 1 con-\nsiders the severity of poverty. As a increases, the weight given\nto the severity of poverty increases. In the limiting case as a\napproaches infinity, the index collapses to a simple formula that\nis solely a function of the proportion of individuals with zero\nincome.\nWhen analyzing the results of the policy simulations, we pre-\nsent the percentage change between the base case and the simu-\nlation case in the poverty rate, the poverty gap, and the FGT2\nindex for elderly women. We also present figures on the\nproportion of benefits that would be received by poor elderly\nwomen, poor elderly men, and the nonpoor elderly population\nas an alternative way of demonstrating relative effectiveness.\nRESULTS\nTable 1 provides basic descriptive statistics on demographic,\nfinancial, and health variables for our sample of elderly women\nin 1991, by SSI eligibility and participation status. Roughly 9%\nof the U.S. noninstitutional elderly female population is eligible\nfor SSI benefits. Compared with all elderly women, a larger\nproportion of eligible elderly women is divorced, separated, or\nwidowed, and a smaller proportion is married. Eligible elderly\nwomen are more likely than elderly women overall to be African\nAmerican, Hispanic, poorly educated, and in poor health.\nGenerally, the data show that elderly SSI-eligible women are\nworse off financially than elderly women overall. Compared\nwith 13.5% of all elderly women, 71% of elderly SSI-eligible\nwomen live in poverty. A lower percentage have positive SSI-\ncountable assets and income, and the median amount among\nthose with positive assets and income is substantially lower for\neligible elderly women compared with all elderly women.\nBased on the data in Table 1, the SSI participation rate among\neligible elderly women is 57.8%. Previous studies have\ndocumented similarly low participation rates among elderly\nMeyer, 1989). Over half of elderly female participants are\nTable 1.

Elderly female participants are\nmore financially disadvantaged than elderly women as a whole.\nAlthough 74% receive Social Security income, the median\nmonthly benefit among recipients is only $278. The average SSI\nbenefit among elderly female participants is $181 per month\n(not shown). Table 1 also shows that eligible female participants\nare slightly less likely to be in poverty than all eligible women,\nreflecting the success of the SSI program in reducing poverty.\nThe last three columns of Table 1 present data for elderly\nwomen who are not eligible for SSI benefits. The columns for\nelderly women who are income eligible only and resource\neligible only show the characteristics of those who might\nbecome eligible for SSI as a result of the interventions we test.\nThose who meet only the SSI income eligibility criteria have\nlow median SSI-countable monthly incomes, low median\nSocial Security income, and high median SSI-countable assets.\nTheir poverty rate (84.2%) is the highest of all groups, sug-\ngesting that these elderly women would benefit greatly from\ninterventions targeting the SSI asset test. Elderly women who\nmeet only the resource eligibility criteria have low median SSI-\ncountable assets, high median SSI-countable monthly incomes,\nand high median Social Security income. Although this group\nhas a relatively low poverty rate, it represents over 3.5 million\nelderly women who might benefit from interventions target-\ning the SSI FBR or income exclusions. By contrast, those\nelderly women who meet neither the SSI income nor resource\neligibility criteria have a poverty rate of only 2.1% and have\nvery high median SSI-countable income and assets. Thus, the\nSSI eligibility criteria are extremely effective in screening out\nelderly women who are clearly not poor.\nTable 2 presents the results of the participation model, with\nbootstrapped standard errors to account for the complex SIPP\nsample design. The key result is that expected SSI benefits are\npositively and significantly related to the likelihood of SSI\nparticipation. The marginal effect indicates that a $100 increase\nin benefits would increase the overall probability of participa-\ntion by 5 percentage points. The U.S. born appear to be more\nlikely to participate than immigrants. U.S. citizenship, how-\never, is negatively related to SSI participation. Thus, because\neveryone born in the United States is a citizen, the combined\neffect is small at best. Among immigrants, the participation\nprobability varies by entry cohort. The data suggest that ob-\ntaining U.S. citizenship offsets the possibly higher SSI par-\nticipation among immigrants. Eligibles who require personal\ncare and who had a greater number of doctor visits in the\nprevious 12 months are more likely to participate. The esti-\nmated coefficients on the state dummy variables are not pre-\nsented because of space constraints.\nTable 3 presents the baseline poverty outcomes that the\ninterventions we examine are designed to improve. We\ncompare all elderly individuals with all elderly women by\nusing the FGT family of poverty measures. Unlike the poverty\nrate and poverty gap, the point value of the FGT2\nindex does\nTable 2.

Comparing all the values\npresented in Table 3, we find it clear that elderly women in\n1991 experienced poverty to a greater degree than the elderly\npopulation in general. The major qualitative conclusion from\nthis table is that the financial situation of elderly women is\nunambiguously worse compared with all elderly people, and\nhence elderly men. Thus, the anticipated effects of alternative\nSSI reform proposals on elderly women are of particular policy\nrelevance.\nTable 4 gives the values of the parameters representing\nprogram rules that produce simulations with given increases in\nSSI expenditures. Each cell represents a simulation and each\ncolumn a series of simulations at a specific cost level. For\nexample, the first row shows that the base-case value of the\n($612 for couples) produces a 1% cost increase, and so on.\nCells labeled ``not possible'' indicate that feasible values of that\nparameter cannot produce a simulation at that cost level. This\ncan occur either because of inherent bounds on the given\nparameter or because at some cost increase level there are no\nmore potential participants who might be helped by further\nincreasing the given program parameter.\nThe cost-equivalent policy options are associated with\nchanges in parameter values of quite different magnitudes.\nFor example, a 3% program cost increase is associated with\nonly a $5 increase in the FBR for individuals (slightly more\nthan 1%), whereas the same 3% cost increase is associated\nwith a $5,745 increase in the asset threshold for individuals\n(an increase of 287%). The relationship between the magnitude\nof the parameter change and the associated cost increase is\ninfluenced by the manner in which the parameter change affects\neligibility, the level of individual benefits, participation, and\ndistributional features of the eligible population. Increasing the\nasset threshold, for example, has no effect on the benefit level\nof existing participants. All of the additional program cost goes\nto benefits for previously ineligible units who become eligible\nparticipants. Increasing the FBR directly increases benefits for\nall existing participants and induces participation through in-\ncreasing eligibility and higher participation propensities (by\nmeans of increased benefits).\nThe simulated parameter values for the Social Security\nincome exclusion are similar to the simulated values of the GIE\nat each cost level. In fact, the Social Security income exclusion\nacts as a targeted increase in the GIE. The inflation-adjusted\nvalue of the simulated Social Security income exclusion, even\nfor a 20% cost increase, is much lower than the exclusion\nproposed by some. For example, Smeeding, Estes, and Glasse\nestimate that a $60 Social Security income exclusion (in 1991\ndollars) would increase SSI program costs for the elderly\npopulation by 20%. This is roughly equivalent to the $80\nexclusion proposed by Kijakazi and Primus (2000) after\ninflation is accounted for.\nTable 5 presents the implications of the simulations in terms\nof poverty among elderly women. It presents the percentage\nchange between the base case and the simulations for the\npoverty rate, poverty gap, and FGT2\nindex. The results are\ngrouped by outcome measure. Each column represents a specific\nchange in federal SSI program costs.\nThe first panel shows changes in poverty rates. The mag-\nnitudes of simulated changes are generally inconsequential\nand indistinguishable from each other, indicating that the\nchanges that are produced by these kinds of interventions\ngenerally do not move elderly women from below the poverty\nthreshold to above it. This is not surprising because the\nTable 3. Baseline Values of FGT Poverty Measures for All Elderly\nPoverty Measure All Elderly Ind.

In contrast to\nthe poverty rate, the changes in the poverty gap vary across\ninterventions and the magnitudes are substantial. The inter-\nventions are not all equally effective, however. The two\nsimulations involving the asset test stand out from the rest in\nterms of reducing the poverty gap. This is true at the 1%, 3%,\nand 5% levels of cost increases. It is not feasible to change the\nasset test to produce a 20% cost increase; a simulation of the\ncomplete removal of the asset test produced a cost increase\nof only 8% (not shown). The large effects associated with\nchanging the asset test are remarkable in light of the results of\nprevious studies. For example, eliminating the asset test has the\nsmallest poverty gap reduction of any of the changes simulated\nby McGarry (2002). We find that, on a cost-equivalent basis,\nthe simulations involving changing the asset test display\ncomparatively impressive results.\nA general pattern of the relative effectiveness of the various\ninterventions in reducing the poverty gap can be discerned from\nTable 5. Behind the two involving the asset test is a second\ngroup of interventions that includes increasing the FBR,\nincreasing the individual FBR only, increasing the GIE, and\ncreating a Social Security income exclusion. Finally, a third\ngroup of interventions includes the two simulations involving\nthe EIE, which are clearly the least effective. These patterns\nhold at all feasible cost levels.\nThe third panel of Table 5 shows percentage changes in the\nindex. A negative change indicates a decrease in poverty.\nThe interventions can be grouped into the same three categories\nas for the poverty gap. That is, the two interventions involving\nthe asset test are the most effective, there is a middle group of\nsomewhat less effective interventions, and the two interventions\ninvolving the EIE are the least effective. Thus, using a measure\nthat emphasizes income changes at the bottom of the income\ndistribution does not change the ordering of the results; how-\never, the asset test interventions stand out even more when the\nmeasure is used.\nAlthough the results discussed herein are for elderly women\nonly, we argue that final policy decisions should be based on\na consideration of the effects on both men and women. Table 6\npresents the proportion of additional dollars that would be\nreceived by poor elderly women, poor elderly men, and\nnonpoor elderly people (for the 5% cost increase scenario).\nConsistent with previous results, the two interventions in-\nvolving the asset test would direct a relatively large proportion\nof additional spending to elderly women and men in poverty.\nThe two earned income exclusion interventions would largely\ndirect additional spending to elderly people who are not in\npoverty. The ranking of the overall target efficiency of the\nvarious interventions (proportion going to poor women and\nmen combined) is the same as the ranking for women alone.\nThus our results are highly robust by gender. Table 6 also\nshows that the proportion of additional spending going to poor\nelderly women and men for each of the interventions is largely\nTable 5.

The\none exception to this is the intervention that increases the\nfederal benefit for individuals only, which disproportionately\ntargets poor elderly women. This reflects the high proportion of\nwidowed women among the elderly poor as well as the growing\nproportion of never-married elderly women.\nDISCUSSION\nIn this article, using a new methodology of cost-equivalent\ncomparisons, we analyze the potential of the SSI program to\nserve as a cost-effective way of strengthening income security\namong elderly women. We identify several highly target-\nefficient policy options, and we unambiguously find that re-\nforming the SSI asset test is the most effective intervention.\nWhat is the potential of SSI reform for enhancing the social\nsafety net for elderly women in the 21st century? To answer\nthis question it is necessary to put SSI reform in the broader\ncontext of Social Security reform and other important changes\nto society and the economy.\nPerhaps the Achilles' heel of successful Social Security\nreform is the need to find cost-effective solutions to counter\neconomic vulnerability among the elderly population that may\narise from personal accounts allowing for investments in the\nstock market, the shift from defined benefit pension plans to\ndefined contribution plans (also partially invested in stocks), and\nthe secular shift to a society of unrelated or loosely related\nindividuals. By contrast, our study has found that SSI reform\ncan be structured in a highly target-efficient way. Social Security\nreform in this respect is inherently limited for several reasons. It\ndoes not address the economic vulnerability of population\nsubgroups outside of the Social Security system. Moreover, it\ndoes not address poverty arising from poor investment outcomes\nfrom individual accounts. Reforms focusing on establishing\na minimum Social Security benefit are inherently limited\nbecause the structure of Social Security is closely tied to\nearnings histories--those with sporadic work histories may not\nbe sufficiently protected under such proposals. Proposals\nfocusing on widows are limited to a subgroup, albeit an\nimportant one, but also one that is becoming less important as\na result of the breakdown of the nuclear family and the increase\nin female employment. Moreover, reforms related to Social\nSecurity alone are poorly targeted (Anzick & Weaver, 2001)\nbecause they ignore other sources of income and assets.\nThe major attraction of SSI for the elderly population as a tool\nfor fighting poverty is that it is a negative income tax targeted\ndirectly on poor elderly people. Thus looking at Social Security\nand SSI reform together is sensible, all the more so given that\nthe financing of the two programs is fundamentally different--\ntrust fund versus general revenues. Viewed in isolation, some\nreforms may appear costless because they simply shift costs to\na different pot of funds.\nThe current SSI program, however, is not as effective at\nfighting poverty as it could be. One of the most important reasons\nis the asset test. From an antipoverty standpoint, the current SSI\nasset test has two major weaknesses. First, rather than gradually\nphasing out SSI benefits as asset levels increase, there is a cliff at\nthe threshold, a threshold that is very low relative to the SSI\nincome guarantee. Second, there is no consideration given to the\nincome-producing potential of financial assets other than\npassbook savings and dividend-producing assets. Thus eligibil-\nity for SSI benefits depends not only on the value but also the\nform of financial assets. These problems may not have been\nsubstantial in the 1970s, a time when few people invested in the\nstock market and defined benefit plans were dominant. Both of\nthese issues will become increasingly important in the decades\nahead, especially if Social Security reforms oriented toward\nindividual equity investments are implemented.\nGiven these problems, it is no surprise that our empirical\nresults show that poverty among elderly women is by far the\nhighest among those who are income eligible, but have assets\nabove the asset threshold. We tested two asset reform options,\nboth of which are highly target efficient. The first is to simply\nincrease the asset threshold. This approach, however, does not\neliminate the threshold cliff or address the income-producing\npotential of assets. The second is to ``tax'' assets by converting\nasset values to an imputed income stream that is counted\nagainst the FBR, while eliminating the threshold requirement--\nthe cliff. On a cost-equivalent basis, the second approach tends\nto be slightly better in reducing poverty among elderly women.\nIt also has appealing incentive properties. In addition, a reason-\nable argument can be made to set the asset ``tax'' rate close to\nthe annuitized value of the asset.\nAnother important reform approach involves changing the\neconomies of scale assumptions embedded in the SSI benefit\nformula. This is addressed by the reform to increase the\nindividual FBR only. As expected, this approach consistently\nproduced better results for elderly women than increasing\nTable 6.

The couple FBR is 150% of the\nindividual FBR. If the individual in question is living alone,\nthis implies a FBR for couples that assumes weaker scale\neconomies than are embedded in the official poverty threshold\nmeasure.\nThere is also an SSI marriage penalty arising from the fact\nthat the program does not currently acknowledge economies of\nscale arising from two or more unmarried adults living in the\nsame household. Thus, whereas the couple FBR is 150% of the\nindividual FBR, a cohabiting couple, if both qualify, would\nreceive benefits calculated on the basis of 200% of the\nindividual FBR. A promising direction for research might\ninvolve simulations designed with an eye toward the better\nalignment of the FBR applicable to persons in different\nhousehold structures and the economies of scale assumptions\nof poverty measures.\nFinally, we address the trade-off between targeting and\neconomic incentives, an issue that is particularly important in\nthe context of savings and work behavior. One of the attractive\naspects of asset test reform is that it would simultaneously\nimprove targeting and reduce perverse incentives to ``spend\ndown'' assets. However, as with any means-tested income\nsupport program, there are clear trade-offs between targeting\nand economic incentives. Most strikingly, although our results\nshow that liberalizing the EIE is an ineffective tool of reducing\npoverty among the elderly population, it would undoubtedly\nincrease work incentives. Similarly, although creating a separate\nSSI exclusion for Social Security income may be slightly less\ntarget efficient than increasing the GIE, a Social Security\nincome exclusion should reduce lifetime work disincentives.\nThe work incentive issues may become increasingly important\nas life expectancy increases, the Social Security normal\nretirement age is raised, and increased work activity among\nelderly people is facilitated by technological change. Thus,\nalthough target efficiency should be a prime objective of\nSSI reform, other factors such as work and savings incen-\ntives, as well as administrative complexity, also have to be\nconsidered.\n"
