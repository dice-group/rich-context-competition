Shaw1 and Neal Krause1,2\n1School of Public Health and 2Institute of Gerontology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.\nObjectives. The purpose of this study is twofold: (a) to see whether the association between age and perceived con-\ntrol is the same for Blacks as well as Whites; and (b) to see if education, health, income, social support, cognitive func-\ntion, and religion account for the relationship between age and control in the same way for Blacks and Whites.\nMethods. Data for this study come from the first wave of the Americans' Changing Lives panel study. Complete\ndata are available for 357 Black and 2,792 White individuals. Respondents were asked questions about their feelings of\ncontrol, health status, income, social support, cognitive function, religious participation, and demographic information.\nResults. The findings suggest that age has an inverse and nonlinear association with feelings of control. Moreover,\nthis relationship is similar for Blacks and Whites. The data further reveal that, across all age groups, Blacks report a\nlower sense of control than Whites. Less education, less income, greater cognitive impairments, and more religiosity are\nassociated with a lower sense of control. These factors, along with health and social support, account for 69% of the as-\nsociation between age and control, with no differences according to race.\nDiscussion. These results show that lower levels of control are associated with older age in both Blacks and Whites,\nand that racial disparities in feelings of control persist across all age groups. This suggests that Blacks may be at a partic-\nular disadvantage in the face of the increasing challenges of aging.\nstrong sense of personal control is essential for the\nmaintenance of health and well-being in late life\n(Mendes de Leon, Seeman, Baker, Richardson, & Tinetti,\n1996). Individuals with a strong sense of control believe the\nchanges in their social world are responsive to their choices,\nefforts, and actions. In contrast, people with a weak sense of\ncontrol believe that events in their lives are shaped by forces\noutside their influence, and that they have little ability to in-\nfluence the things that happen to them. Unfortunately, re-\ncent research by Mirowsky (1995) shows that feelings of\ncontrol may decline in an accelerating fashion across pro-\ngressively older age groups. If we want to help older adults\nage successfully we must, therefore, learn more about the\nsocial and psychological factors driving this process.\nResearch to this point suggests that two factors are\nlargely responsible for the observed decline in feelings of\ncontrol--education and health (Mirowsky, 1995; Wolinsky\n& Stump, 1996). Education is thought to bolster feelings of\ncontrol over the life course because people with more\nschooling tend to have better problem-solving abilities, as\nwell as access to more resources. The decline in feelings of\ncontrol across older age groups, therefore, may be a mani-\nfestation of the current cohort of older adults having\nless schooling, on average, than today's younger adults\n(Mirowsky & Ross, 1998). Furthermore, diminishing health\nand increasing impairments associated with aging may con-\ntribute to the decline in feelings of personal control by pro-\ngressively reducing the range of activities in which one can\nexercise control (Schulz, Heckhausen, & O'Brien, 1994).\nAlthough this research has provided valuable insight into\nthe relationship between age and personal control, a number\nof key issues remain unexamined. Chief among them is the\ninfluence of race. In existing studies, race has been treated\nas a control variable--something to be removed rather than\nexamined in its own right (Mirowsky, 1995; Wolinsky &\nStump, 1996). This is unfortunate because race differences\nin feelings of control appear to exist at all ages (Mirowsky,\nRoss, & Van Willigan, 1996). What is less evident, how-\never, is whether the decline of control in minority group\nmembers across different age groups is similar to what\nMirowsky (1995) and others found, or whether the relation-\nship between age and control follows a different course\namong people of color. Race is a master status that affects\nvirtually all areas of life, including education, health, and\nfeelings of personal control (Livingston, 1994). Therefore,\nif race is related to feelings of personal control and the fac-\ntors that erode control with advancing age, then the trajec-\ntory reported by Mirowsky (1995) may not be the same for\nWhite and minority group members.\nIn addition to determining whether a similar association\nbetween age and feelings of control exists for Blacks and\nWhites, it is also important to see if the same factors ac-\ncount for this relationship in both racial groups. We suspect\nthat relationships among education, health, and control may\ndiffer for Whites and Blacks. For example, education is a\nform of human capital that provides people with problem-\nsolving skills and the resources (e.g., income) necessary for\ninfluencing the environment. However, the benefits of edu-\ncation may not be enjoyed equally by Blacks and Whites. In\nparticular, due to inequitable school funding practices and\ndiscrimination in the workplace, Blacks receive less return\nthan Whites on their educational investments (Maxwell,\nA\n1994). This suggests that there may be structurally induced\nracial disparities in the skill levels necessary to exercise ef-\nfective control. Therefore, the relationship between educa-\ntion and control should be consistently weaker across the\nlife course for Blacks than for Whites.\nThere may also be race differences in the relationship be-\ntween health and feelings of control over the life course. For\ninstance, lower rates of health care access and utilization\namong Blacks are now widely documented (Blustein &\nproblems that are left unattended get worse, the downward\ntrajectory of control should be more precipitous in Black\nthan White groups.\nStill, other factors may account for race differences in the\nrelationship between age and control. For instance, income,\nsocial support, and cognitive function may also contribute\nto one's sense of control (Caplan, 1981; Lachman &\nWeaver, 1998). However, for many people, these resources\n(perhaps with the exception of social support) decline in\nlater life (George, Landerman, Blazer, & Anthony, 1991;\nclines in income and cognitive function may be especially\ndevastating to feelings of control among the Black group,\nwhich, because of its low socioeconomic position, may al-\nready be lacking alternative sources of control. In contrast,\nthe relatively strong social support systems of Blacks may\nmake them less vulnerable to declines in control with ad-\nFinally, religion may play a somewhat different role in\naccounting for the association between age and control. Be-\ncause religion bolsters feelings of control (Krause & Tran,\n1989), it is expected that religiosity may suppress the nega-\ntive association between age and control. Given that Blacks\nare more involved in religion than Whites (Taylor, 1986),\nthe \"protective\" effects of religion may be greater for mem-\nbers of this minority group.\nTaken as a whole, the discussion above leads to the fol-\nlowing hypotheses:\n1. The inverse relationship between age and control is\nstronger for Blacks than Whites;\n2. Education and social support account for more of the as-\nsociation between age and control among Whites;\n3. Health, income, and cognitive function explain more\nof the association between age and control among\nBlacks; and\n4. Religion reduces the association between age and control\nto a greater extent for Blacks than Whites.\nMETHODS\nSample\nThe data for this study come from the first wave of a lon-\ngitudinal panel study, Americans' Changing Lives (House,\n1997). This study used a stratified, multistage, area proba-\nbility sample of noninstitutionalized persons 25 years of age\nand older living in the coterminous United States. Blacks\nand persons 60 years of age and older were oversampled.\nFace-to-face interviews for the first wave of data collection\ninterviews were completed successfully, representing a 68%\nresponse rate.\nThe current study uses only those respondents who self-\nidentified as Black or White. After using listwise deletion of\nmissing values to deal with item nonresponse, complete\ndata were available for 3,149 study participants. Approxi-\nas Black. The average age of the sample as a whole was\nFifty-two percent were classified as female, and 68.8%\nwere married. Study participants reported having completed\nThese descriptive statistics, as well as the findings presented\nin the Results section, are based on weighted data.\nMeasures\nThe measure of control appears in Table 1. A high score\nrepresents a strong sense of personal control. The internal\nconsistency reliability estimate for this short scale is .718.\nRace is represented as a binary variable (1  Black; 0 \nnon-Hispanic White). People who self-identified as Ameri-\ncan Indian, Hispanic, Asian, or \"other\" were excluded. Age\nwas based upon self-reports from respondents and is scored\nin a continuous format. Education is scored in a continuous\nformat reflecting the total number of years of completed\nschooling. Physical health was measured as a simple count\nof the number of major chronic conditions experienced in\nthe last year out of a list of 10. This list included arthritis/\nrheumatism, lung disease, hypertension, heart attack and\nheart trouble, diabetes, cancer/malignant tumor, foot prob-\nlems, stroke, fractures or broken bones, and loss of urine be-\nyond one's control. Income was measured as total pre-tax\nfamily income from all sources in the 12 months prior to\nthe survey. Respondents chose from among 10 ordinal\ncategories of income ranging from \"less than $5,000\" to\n\"$80,000.\" The social support measure also appears in\nTable 1. A high score indicates more support. Cognitive im-\npairment was measured as the number of incorrect re-\nsponses to eight questions from the Short Portable Mental\nStatus Questionnaire (Pfeiffer, 1975) covering the date,\nmother's maiden name, day of the week, current president,\nformer president, serial three test, and self-reported age and\nbirth date. Table 1 also includes the measure of religiosity.\nThis measure is coded so that higher scores indicate greater\nreligious involvement. The internal consistency reliability\nestimate for this scale is .753. And finally, the models in this\nstudy were estimated after the effects of sex and marital sta-\ntus were controlled statistically. Both are represented by bi-\nnary variables (1  female, 0  male; 1  married, 0 \notherwise).\nStatistical Issues\nThe analyses for this study are designed to test for race\ndifferences in the effect of age on feelings of control and the\ndegree to which several intervening variables account for\nthis relationship. Because previous work has shown a non-\nlinear association between age and feelings of control\n(Mirowsky, 1995), the key independent variable--age--is\nrepresented as a squared term throughout. Whether the lower\norder term of age should also be included in the equations is\na source of some debate. The prevailing rule of thumb is that\nhigher order terms should be tested only when the lower or-\nder terms are also included in the equation. However, Alli-\nson (1977) proposes that if the predictor in question is mea-\nsured at the ratio level, inclusion of the higher order term\nonly is appropriate. In the case of this study, the variable of\ninterest--age--is a ratio-level measure and, therefore, only\nthe squared term is included in all models.\nThe following equations were estimated:\nwhere a is the intercept, b are regression coefficients, and d\nrepresents the effects of the demographic control measures,\nsex and marital status. Finally, Predictors denotes educa-\ntion, health, income, social support, cognitive impairment,\nand religiosity.\nRESULTS\nThe findings from this study are presented in two sec-\ntions. First, the relationship between age and perceived con-\ntrol is evaluated for the entire sample and by race. Then,\nanalyses evaluating race differences in the effects of the\npredictors on the relationship between age and control are\npresented.\nAge and Control\nAs shown in Model A of Table 2, the findings from esti-\nmating Equation 1 replicate the main results of Mirowsky\n(1995). More specifically, feelings of control decrease in an\nControl a b1\nd\n+ + +\n=\nControl a b1\nRace\n\u00d7\n( ) d\n+ + +\n+\n=\nControl a b1\nPredictors b4\nPredictors Race\n\u00d7\n( ) d\n+ + + +\n+\n=\naccelerated fashion across progressively older age groups\nportant to note that Black race is negatively associated with\nthat, regardless of age, Black respondents reported a lower\nsense of control than Whites.\nNext, racial differences in the association between age\nand control were evaluated by entering an interaction be-\ntween age-squared and race into the model. The results in\nModel B of Table 2 suggest that the nonlinear association\nbetween age and control does not differ significantly by\nEffects of Intervening Variables\nResults from the analyses testing the effects of various in-\ntervening variables on the relationship between age-squared\nand control are also presented in Table 2. The findings from\nthe additive model appear in Model C. These results show\nthat a greater sense of control is associated with more edu-\n.001), and fewer cognitive impairments (b  .16; p \n.001). However, in contrast to what was anticipated, a\nhigher degree of religiosity is associated with a lower sense\nof control (b  .14; p  .001). In addition, after account-\ning for the effects of all of the other predictors, health and\nsocial support are not associated with feelings of control.\nTaken together, the data in Table 2 reveal that the interven-\ning variables account for 69% of the relationship between\nthe age-squared term and control.\nNext, racial differences in the effects of these predictors\non control were tested with interaction terms. As shown in\nModel D of Table 2, race differences appear to exist only\nwith regard to the impact of education on feelings of control\n(b  .10; p  .05). Separate analyses within each racial\nsubsample (not shown here) show that education is signifi-\ncantly associated with feelings of control for Whites (b \nimpact of the other predictors on feelings of control, how-\nTable 1.

Furthermore, because the\neffect of the age-squared term on control does not change\nconsiderably with the inclusion of any of the interaction\nterms (Model C vs Model D), no racial differences appear to\nexist in the effects of these predictors on the relationship be-\ntween age-squared and control.\nDISCUSSION\nAlthough research indicates that feelings of control are\ninversely associated with age, little attention has been given\nto whether this is true for Blacks as well as Whites. Surpris-\ningly, the data suggest that the relationship between age and\ncontrol beliefs is largely the same for people in both racial\ngroups. Still, even though the relationship between control\nand age is the same, different factors may influence this re-\nlationship in the two racial groups. We took a modest first\nstep toward addressing this issue by testing whether six fac-\ntors--education, health, income, social support, cognitive\nimpairments, and religion--exert the same or different ef-\nfects on the inverse relationship between age and control\namong Blacks and Whites. Our findings suggest that in-\ncome, cognitive impairments, and religiousness are all sig-\nnificantly associated with feelings of control for the sample\nas a whole, but no race differences emerge in the relation-\nship between these predictors and control. In contrast, the\neffects of education on feelings of control are stronger for\nWhites than Blacks. Finally, health and social support ap-\npear to have no effect on feelings of control for either\nBlacks or Whites.\nOf particular interest are the effects of education and reli-\ngion. The data indicate that, regardless of age, less educa-\ntion is associated with less perceived control among Whites\nonly. This would lead us to believe that education should be\nmore useful for explaining why Whites, but not Blacks, ex-\nperience an inverse association between age and control.\nHowever, this was not the case. Instead, the findings indi-\ncate that there were no race differences in this relationship.\nThe complex linkages among age, race, education, and con-\ntrol represent an important area for further inquiry.\nAdditionally, for both groups, greater involvement in re-\nligion is associated with a lower sense of control. Moreover,\nreligion accounts for some of the observed association be-\ntween age and control for both groups. The direction of\nthese findings, however, was not anticipated. Based on pre-\nvious research, we expected to see the opposite effect (i.e.,\nmore religion bolsters control; Krause & Tran, 1989). Per-\nhaps the explanation for these unexpected findings may be\nfound by turning to the literature on primary and secondary\ncontrol (Rothbaum, Weisz, & Snyder, 1982). Primary con-\ntrol refers to efforts aimed at changing the external world.\nFollowing Skinner (1996), secondary control involves ef-\nforts to change the external world by shifting responsibility\nto a benevolent other. Simply put, the negative association\nbetween religion and control may reflect the relinquishing\nof control to a powerful but benevolent other (i.e., God).\nIn the process of exploring these as well as other theoreti-\ncal explanations for the differences in control over the life\ncourse, researchers would be well advised to take into ac-\ncount the limitations in the work we have presented. Three\nare identified briefly below.\nAs discussed above, our finding of a negative association\nbetween religion and control may reflect a relinquishing of\nprimary control in favor of secondary control. However, the\nitems used to measure control in the current study all refer\nto primary control. Much more could be learned by devel-\noping measures of secondary control and testing them\nwithin this framework.\nTable 2. Regression Models Predicting Effects of Age, Race, and\nSeveral Intervening Variables on Sense of Control (N  3,149)\nPredictor Model A Model B Model C Model D\nBlack  Chronic Conditions .011\nBlack  Cognitive Impairment .011\nNotes: The relationships presented in this table are estimated after the ef-\nfects of sex and marital status were controlled statistically. For each measure,\nthe first value in each column is the unstandardized regression coefficient, the\nsecond value in each column is the standard error, and the third value in each\ncolumn is the standardized regression coefficient.\nAnother limitation involves drawing conclusions about\nthe effects of age on control using cross-sectional data.\nTwo issues raise concern in this respect. First, the direction\nof causality between the predictors and control is unknown.\nFor example, with only one wave of data, the degree to\nwhich increasing religion affects feelings of control cannot\nbe distinguished from the degree to which declines in con-\ntrol may cause changes in religiosity. In addition, with only\none wave of data, we cannot be sure if the observed pat-\nterns in control are associated with age, period, or cohort\neffects.\nFinally, there are limitations in some of the study mea-\nsures. For instance, greater insight into the relationship be-\ntween age and control may be achieved by using better\nmeasures of religion and health. In addition, the measure\nof social support used in this study requires some explana-\ntion. As described in Table 1, levels of social support from\nvarious sources (e.g., spouse, child, friends, and relatives)\nwere assessed separately. Therefore, because not all re-\nspondents reported having relationships with people from\neach source, we constructed a measure that reflects sup-\nport from the person most likely to be closest to the re-\nspondent (see Krause, Goldenhar, Liang, Jay, & Maeda,\n1993, for a similar approach). Thus, for respondents who\nwere married or living with a partner, the measure reflects\nsupport from this partner; for those without a significant\nother but who had children, the measure reflects support\nfrom their children; and for those who were without both a\nsignificant other and children, the measure reflects support\nfrom friends and relatives. This measure is based on an\nimplicit hierarchy reflecting the differential importance of\nvarious sources of support. This means that if a significant\nother is present, then it is assumed that the assistance he or\nshe provides matters most. If a respondent does not have a\nsignificant other, but has children, it is assumed that sup-\nport from a child is more important than support from the\nremaining source assessed in this study (i.e., friends and\nrelatives). This measurement strategy, which differentially\nweights support scores in favor of close family members,\nis based on socioemotional selectivity theory (Carstensen,\n1992). According to this perspective, as people age, emo-\ntional support from family members becomes increasingly\nimportant.\nThe measure of control used in our study could also be\nimproved. All three indicators available to us were keyed in\nthe direction of externality (i.e., less control). In addition,\nthe three items ask about feelings of personal control con-\nnected to only negative outcomes (e.g., bad things and\ndeath). However, more sophisticated instruments for mea-\nsuring control include items keyed towards both external\nand internal locus of control, as well as both positive and\nnegative outcomes (Mirowsky & Ross, 1991). Nevertheless,\nthe fact that the pattern of decline in feelings of control\nfound in our data set is similar to those found in previous re-\nsearch by other investigators suggests that our measure may\ncapture at least part of the same conceptual domain assessed\nby more complete measures of control.\nAlthough there are limitations in the work we have done,\nperhaps the greatest contribution of our research lies in our\neffort to cast the study of race and control in a life course\nperspective. We hope that this research sparks further inter-\nest in examining the significance of race, as well as other\nsocial structural factors such as gender and socioeconomic\nstatus, in the relationship between age and control.\n"
