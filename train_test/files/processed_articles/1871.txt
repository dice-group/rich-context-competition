Increases in\nmetabolic syndrome were primarily attributable to in-\ncreasing body mass index (BMI); prevalence of BMI at\nor above the 85th percentile increased from 25.9% to\n30.5%.

Adolescents with more meta-\nbolic abnormalities have higher CRP, which may be an\nindicator of greater metabolic derangement and future\ncardiovascular risk.\n\u00a9 2006 American Association for Clinical Chemistry\nMetabolic abnormalities in children have become more\nprevalent with the epidemic of obesity in childhood and\nadolescence. Although studies have examined the cluster-\ning of metabolic abnormalities (1\u00ad3), the metabolic syn-\ndrome phenotype continues to be less well understood in\nchildren than in adults in terms of criteria, prevalence,\nand clinical implications. Abnormalities such as over-\nweight, hypertension, and lipid derangements are known\nto track from childhood to adulthood, and the collected\nabnormalities may similarly track (4). Adult metabolic\nsyndrome, although the subject of some debate recently,\nis associated with cardiovascular disease (5) and diabetes\nmellitus (6), and was defined by the Adult Treatment\nPanel III (ATP III)4 as 3 or more of the following: hy-\npertriglyceridemia, low HDL-cholesterol, high fasting\nglucose, excessive waist circumference, and hypertension\n(7). Recent factor analysis supports this definition (8).\nUsing a definition based closely on ATP III in analyses of\nthe National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n1 Department of Cardiology; 2 Department of Medicine, Division of Endo-\ncrinology; and 3 Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Chil-\ndren's Hospital, Boston, MA.\n* Address correspondence to this author at: Department of Laboratory\n4 Nonstandard abbreviations: ATP III, Adult Treatment Panel III;\nNHANES, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey; CRP, C-reac-\ntive protein; BMI, body mass index; CI, confidence interval; and IQR, inter-\nquartile range.\nLipids, Lipoproteins,\nand Cardiovascular\nRisk Factors\n(NHANES) III, we recently reported that 63.4% of US\nadolescents have at least 1 metabolic abnormality and that\nnearly 1 in 10 have 3 or more abnormalities consistent\nwith a metabolic syndrome phenotype (9).\nC-reactive protein (CRP) is increased in adults with\nelements of the metabolic syndrome, such as hyperten-\nsion (10) and increased body mass index (BMI) (11), and\ncorrelates with triglyceride and HDL-cholesterol concen-\ntrations (12). In children, there is less information about\nCRP concentrations and metabolic syndrome; however,\nCRP is higher in children with metabolic abnormalities\n(13, 14). We sought to explore changes over time in the\nprevalence of the metabolic syndrome phenotype in US\nbetween metabolic abnormalities, metabolic syndrome,\nand CRP concentrations in the more recent dataset.\nMaterials and Methods\nNHANES is a national dataset of blood testing and\nanthropomorphic measurements weighted to represent\nthe population of noninstitutionalized US civilians, not\nliving on Indian reservations, ages 2 years and older\n(15, 16). It uses a multistage, stratified sampling design. In\n1999, NHANES became a continuously enrolling and\nreporting survey. Our sample was drawn from partici-\npants in the surveys ages 12 to 19 years who underwent\nphysical examinations and fasted for at least 8 h before\nblood testing. Human subjects approval for NHANES\nwas obtained from the CDC. A parent or guardian gave\nconsent for participation, and 12- to 17-year-olds also gave\nassent.\nhigh-sensitivity assay (hsCRP), a latex-enhanced nephe-\nlometry method (BN II nephelometer; Dade Behring)\nwith a lower limit of detection of 0.1 mg/L. Acceptable\nassay in this dataset (17). Participants with CRP con-\ncentrations 0.1 mg/L had a value assigned to them of\n1994 survey did not use a high-sensitivity CRP assay;\nthe lower limit of detection of that assay was 3.0 mg/L,\nwith values below this cutoff being assigned a value of\n2.1 mg/L (18). Both assays are felt to be accurate at CRP\nconcentrations 3.0 mg/L.\nstatistical methods\nBecause the NHANES surveys have complex sampling\ndesigns, estimates and SEs were calculated in Stata, Ver. 9\n(StataCorp), with the sampling weights provided to make\nprevalence estimates representative of the civilian, non-\ninstitutionalized US population. Sampling weights are\nadjusted for nonresponse. We calculated the prevalence of\nindividual metabolic abnormalities as well as the meta-\nbolic syndrome, as defined previously (9), for the entire\nsample and according to sex, age group, race or ethnicity,\nand BMI at or above the 85th percentile for age and sex.\nMetabolic syndrome was defined as 3 or more of the\nfollowing: (a) fasting triglycerides 1.1 mmol/L (100\nmg/dL); (b) HDL-cholesterol 1.3 mmol/L (50 mg/dL),\nexcept in boys 15 to 19 years of age, in whom the cutpoint\nmmol/L (110 mg/dL); (d) waist circumference above the\nNHANES dataset; and (e) systolic blood pressure above\nthe 90th percentile for sex, age, and height. The same\ncriteria for metabolic abnormalities were used for both\ndatasets. For estimates of prevalence, adolescents missing\ninformation on metabolic criteria were assumed not to\nhave met that criterion to give more conservative esti-\nmates of prevalence. BMI percentiles for both datasets\nwere calculated by use of standard CDC data curves. We\ncompared the distributions of these variables in NHANES\nsampling weights.\nWe calculated the median and interquartile range of\nCRP for all adolescents with recorded CRP values and by\nsubgroups according to patient characteristics and meta-\nbolic abnormalities. Because CRP does not follow a gaus-\nsian distribution, we used nonparametric methods for\nanalysis and report percentiles and medians rather than\nmeans. CRP concentrations were compared by use of the\nWilcoxon rank-sum test for characteristics with 2 catego-\nries (e.g., sex and normal BMI vs BMI at or above the 85th\npercentile) and by use of the Kruskal\u00adWallis test for those\nwith 3 or more categories (e.g., number of metabolic\nabnormalities and race or ethnicity). Comparisons were\nrepeated excluding those with CRP 10 mg/L because\nvery high CRP concentrations can indicate inflammatory\ndisorders or infections.\nResults\nyear-olds. Low HDL-cholesterol, hypertriglyceridemia,\nand central obesity remained common, whereas hyper-\nglycemia and hypertension were infrequent, as we found\nmetabolic abnormalities increased in the more recent\ncrease seen in central obesity. Subgroup analysis by age\ngrouping and sex revealed that changes between the 2\ndatasets generally were similar to those in the overall\ngroup. Notably, the prevalence of hypertriglyceridemia\nincreased in non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican Ameri-\ncans, in contrast to the prevalence in the group overall\nand in non-Hispanic whites, in whom the prevalence of\nhypertriglyceridemia decreased (data not shown).\nThe prevalence of the metabolic syndrome phenotype\nrepresents an increase of 38%. Increases in prevalence\nestimates of the metabolic syndrome phenotype were\n1326 de Ferranti et al.: Metabolic Phenotype and CRP in US Adolescents\nseen in subgroups as well (Table 1). The largest increases\nwere seen in non-Hispanic blacks, followed by Mexican\nAmericans. Of note, the prevalence estimate for metabolic\nsyndrome in non-Hispanic blacks was based on a small\nnumber of participants and may appear artificially low in\ngroups by sex revealed similar changes for males and\nfemales (data not shown).\nAs has been reported in the past (19), CRP did not\nfollow a gaussian distribution but was skewed, with\nlower values being more common. Median CRP for those\n[interquartile range (IQR), 0.1\u00ad1.6 mg/L]. Girls had\nslightly higher median CRP than boys (0.5 vs 0.4 mg/L;\nP  0.01) and Mexican Americans had higher CRP than\nchildren with individual metabolic abnormalities com-\npared with adolescents without those metabolic abnor-\nmalities, although the IQRs overlapped (Fig. 2; P\n0.0001); the number of children with hyperglycemia and\nmeasured CRP was too small to allow reliable calcula-\ntions. Median CRP concentrations increased incremen-\ntally by the number of metabolic abnormalities (Fig. 3; P\n0.0001). The results were similar in analyses excluding\nthose with CRP 10 mg/L.\nOf fasting adolescents 12\u00ad19 years of age in the\nthe 85th percentile. This represents an increase of 18%\nhigh BMI was 25.9%, consistent with previous reports\n(20, 21). Consistent with previous reports (3), the meta-\nbolic syndrome phenotype was highly prevalent in the\noverweight adolescents (found in more than one third)\nand rare in teens with normal BMI (Table 1). As expected\nfrom previous research (22), CRP was higher in adoles-\ncents with BMI at or above the 85th percentile compared\nwith those with normal BMI: median, 1.6 mg/L (IQR,\nthe subgroups with 0, 1, and 2 metabolic abnormalities,\nmedian CRP was higher in those with high BMI than in\nthose with normal BMI. Only 12 individuals in the sample\nhad both a normal BMI and 3 or more metabolic abnor-\nmalities. Median CRP was higher for these normal-weight\nadolescents with metabolic syndrome than for the 201\nadolescents with high BMI and 3 or more abnormalities\nFig. 1.

Particularly alarming was the change\nwhich likely played a central role in the increase in the\nmetabolic syndrome overall. Also concerning, if con-\nfirmed, would be the tripling in the prevalence of the\nmetabolic syndrome phenotype in non-Hispanic blacks;\nthis finding may be an artifact because of small sample\nsize and should be reevaluated in other studies with a\nlarger sample size. Median CRP concentrations were\nhigher for adolescents with the metabolic syndrome phe-\nnotype than in those without it, and CRP increased with\ngreater numbers of metabolic abnormalities in the group\noverall and in overweight youth, supporting an associa-\ntion between metabolic syndrome and CRP in the pedi-\natric age range. In overweight children with metabolic\nsyndrome, CRP concentrations were higher than in over-\nweight children without metabolic syndrome, suggesting\nthat the combination of metabolic abnormalities has a\ngreater effect on inflammation than weight alone. The few\nwith normal weight who had metabolic syndrome had\nhigher CRP concentrations than those who were over-\nweight and had metabolic syndrome, leading one to\nsuspect that they represent a different disease group,\nperhaps one worthy of further investigation.\nPrevious studies have also reported that CRP concen-\ntrations in children are associated with individual com-\nponents of the metabolic syndrome (1, 13, 14). The rela-\ntionship with obesity is particularly well documented\nare also correlated with CRP in some reports, whereas the\nrelationship between CRP and insulin resistance in chil-\nalso consistent with reports of CRP concentrations in\ning findings that CRP is higher in girls compared with\nboys, in Mexican Americans compared with non-Hispanic\nwhites, and in overweight adolescents compared with\nnormal-weight adolescents (28).\nAddressing an issue that has been less well investi-\ngated in children, we evaluated the relationship between\na metabolic syndrome phenotype and CRP concentra-\ntions. Weiss et al. (27) found no relationship between CRP\nand a metabolic syndrome phenotype in obese children;\nhowever, they studied a selected referral population with\na higher rate of overweight, and used a more restrictive\ndefinition of metabolic syndrome than ours, which we\nbased on the ATP III definition for adults. Ford et al. (17)\nexamined mean (not median) CRP concentrations in ad-\nolescents with metabolic syndrome who had fasted 6 h;\nhowever, they used a less restrictive definition with lower\nHDL-cholesterol, higher triglyceride, and higher waist\ncircumference cutpoints than ATP III and did not address\nchanges in the CRP concentration with increasing num-\nbers of metabolic abnormalities.\nPrevious research has demonstrated that individual\ncomponents of the metabolic syndrome track from child-\nhood to adulthood, suggesting that metabolic syndrome\nmight also track into adulthood (4). In fact, childhood\nobesity predicts the development of metabolic syndrome\nin adulthood, lending credence to the theory that excess\nadipose tissue is an initiating event for the metabolic\nsyndrome (29). However, it is unknown whether CRP\nconcentrations track from childhood to adulthood. Fur-\nthermore, the long-term cardiovascular risks of increased\nCRP in childhood, as well as clinically useful cutpoints for\nCRP in pediatrics, are unknown. In adults, metabolic\nFig. 2.

Lee et al. (30) reported that CRP\nincreased incrementally with greater numbers of meta-\nbolic abnormalities in adult men and women. The Wom-\nen's Health Study showed that CRP correlated with\nmetabolic syndrome, and the risk of cardiovascular dis-\nease events doubled in women with metabolic syndrome\nand CRP 3.0 mg/L compared with women with meta-\nbolic syndrome and CRP 3.0 mg/L (31). In the West of\nScotland Coronary Prevention Study, CRP was higher in\nmen with metabolic syndrome and was an independent\npredictor of cardiovascular disease and diabetes in mul-\ntivariate analyses (32). Our findings of the association\nbetween metabolic syndrome and CRP in children are\nconsistent with research in adults.\nThere are several limitations to our findings. The\nprimary limitation is the use of a single CRP measure-\nment. In adults, repeat CRP measurements are recom-\nmended, as concentrations are affected by multiple fac-\ntors, including recent infections and inflammatory\nconditions (33). These factors, perhaps more common in\nchildren who have frequent minor illnesses, are partially\noffset by the lower rate of chronic disease in children. We\nattempted to evaluate whether this was a significant\nconfounder by repeating the analysis after excluding\nthose with CRP 10 mg/L, who might have had acute\ninfections or chronic inflammatory conditions, and our\nfindings were not significantly changed. A second limita-\ntion is that study outcomes depend on the definition of\nmetabolic syndrome, a problem inherent to any extrapo-\nlation of the adult definition to a pediatric population.\nThere is no agreed on definition of metabolic syndrome in\nchildren. The cutpoints used for our definition were\nextrapolated from those used in adults; they could not be\nbased on cardiovascular outcomes because of the young\nage of our population. However, the same definition was\nused in both datasets, allowing valid comparisons be-\ntween the two, showing increases in the prevalence of\nmetabolic abnormalities and the metabolic syndrome phe-\nnotype as we have defined them. Future studies should\nexamine CRP in children with metabolic syndrome, as it\nrelates to measures of preclinical disease, such as endo-\nthelial function. A third limitation was our inability to\nevaluate detailed changes in CRP between the 2 surveys\nbecause a high-sensitivity CRP assay was not used in the\nearlier survey. Although the more sensitive assay was not\nused in the earlier dataset, there is evidence to support an\nincrease in CRP concentrations over that time period. In\n3.0 mg/L; in the later survey, 11.0% of adolescents had\nCRP 3.0 mg/L. Although the assay used in the earlier\ndataset does not detect CRP 3.0 mg/L, it is thought to\nbe accurate for CRP concentrations 3.0 mg/L (18). The\nassays used by the 2 surveys have different limits of\ndetection; however, both used reagents and instruments\nfrom the same manufacturer (Dade Behring), and both are\ncalibrated against CRM 470, the international standard for\ncalibration of proteins. Another limitation is that, for\nparticipants missing data, we assumed they did not meet\nthat criterion for a metabolic abnormality. This may have\ncaused us to underestimate the prevalence of the meta-\nbolic syndrome; however, we followed the same proce-\ndure in both datasets, allowing us to demonstrate in-\ncreases in prevalence between the 2 time periods with\nconsistency. Finally, although NHANES is highly repre-\nsentative of most of the US population, the dataset did not\ninclude those living on American Indian reservations. The\nrates of obesity and diabetes mellitus type 2 are particu-\nlarly high in some American Indian populations (34), who\ntherefore are likely to have higher rates of metabolic\nsyndrome.\nIn summary, we found that CRP is increased in adoles-\ncents with metabolic abnormalities and the metabolic\nsyndrome phenotype in a manner consistent with the\nassociation documented previously in adults. The preva-\nlence of metabolic syndrome has increased, in large part\nrelated to the increase in central obesity in adolescents.\nThe impact of these data may be far-reaching, given the\nassociation between CRP, metabolic syndrome and car-\ndiovascular disease (31, 32), and metabolic syndrome\nand diabetes mellitus type 2 (5). Pediatric practitioners\nshould be aware of the clustering of metabolic abnormal-\nities, particularly in overweight children, and public\nhealth efforts should target those affected children for\nrisk-reducing lifestyle changes such as weight loss, exer-\ncise, and dietary modifications. Future studies should\nexplore whether CRP concentrations have a role in clinical\nmanagement and assessment of cardiovascular risk in the\npediatric population.\nInstitute of Diabetes and Digestive Kidney Diseases (to\nD.S.L.), a grant from the Sandra A.
