A competent\nemployee does not only carry out routine tasks but is also required to have the ability to act in the communities of practice in\nhis field and develop his way of working. The challenge of Finnish school-based vocational education has been in creating such\nlearning environments that promote learning professional knowledge demanded by work life. The challenge has required\nvocational teachers to develop their competences in collaboration with employers. The research covers the role of Finnish\nvocational teachers' authentic work placement periods in developing competences from the viewpoint of sociocultural\nlearning. During the work placement period, a teacher furthers his or her competences by working in goal-oriented and\nplanned ways in the work communities of enterprises or in the public sector of their fields. The purpose of the present\nqualitative case study is to increase the understanding of the role of authentic work placement periods in vocational teachers'\ncompetence. Experiences of teachers representing different subjects were studied during their work placement periods. The\nresults show that work placement period supports the development of teachers' competences and provides prerequisites\nfor work-based vocational education.\n",

The concept of professionalism is nowadays\nbroader than before, and one cannot succeed by only doing\nstrictly defined routine work (Appelbaum & Batt, 1994;\nrequired by employees, for example, ability to cooperate\nwith colleagues and in professional networks of their fields,\nas well as, applying their knowledge to new situations and\nmanaging and developing their work (Engestr\u00f6m, 2001;\nHager, 2001). Work is not only the thing that is learnt but\nalso the context in which one learns (Guile & Griffiths,\nAccording to Usher (2009), the professional competence\nof an employee is nowadays defined not only based on pro-\nfessional substance knowledge but also based on profes-\nsional flexibility, lifelong learning, and social skills. Learning\nin work life is connected to the participation in the interac-\ntion process of the community. An individual acts in the cul-\ntural context of his profession and builds his knowledge as a\nmember of the community in question, first in the margin\nand then after increasing knowledge in a more and more\nChanges in work life toward requiring initiative, interac-\ntion, and problem-solving ability have caused reevaluation\nof educational activities in vocational institutes. Border\ncrossing between work life and educational institutes is\ndesired (Engestr\u00f6m, 2001). According to Tynj\u00e4l\u00e4, Virtanen,\ntion and training must be planned, implemented, and evalu-\nated together with work life. Finnish vocational education\nhas met these challenges by deepening contacts with work\nlife, for example, by arranging learning-at-work periods\nwhich have become an important part of vocational studies.\nThe demand for work life cooperation also gives rise to\nthe need for developing teacher competences (Stenstr\u00f6m &\nTynj\u00e4l\u00e4, 2009). A vocational teacher must have, besides pro-\nfessional and pedagogical competences, communication\nskills needed in planning, developing, and evaluating a new\nkind of work life\u00adoriented education (Helakorpi, 2007;\nIn successful work life cooperation, it is important for\nteachers to be aware of the situation in the field of their pro-\nfessions (e.g., Boud & Salomon, 2001; Griffiths & Guile,\n1Oulu University of Applied Sciences, Finland\nCorresponding Author:\nEsa Virkkula, Senior Lecturer, School of Vocational Teacher Education,\nOulu University of Applied Sciences, Uusikatu 2, Oulu 90100, Finland.\nEmail: esa.virkkula@oamk.fi\nIn-Service Teachers' Learning Through\nIntegrating Theory and Practice\nEsa Virkkula1 and S\u00e4de-Pirkko Nissil\u00e41\n Keywords\nwork life cooperation, communities of practice, competence, vocational education\n2 SAGE Open\nthe teachers' knowledge of work life and deepen coopera-\ntion, the teachers'authentic work placement periods ought to\nbe developed to correspond to the respective periods of stu-\ndents. The work placement periods were designed to span\nfrom 2 weeks to 3 months. During this period, the teachers\nwork in the jobs of their expertise areas, either in enterprises\nor in the public sector.\nThe Finnish Ministry of Education and Culture started a\ndevelopmental pilot project \"Competent to Work Markets\"\nfor teachers in autumn 2011 as a part of the ESF (European\nMinistry of Education and Culture (2011), work life skills\nshould be developed during the work placement period and\nby participating in continuing education. The aim is to\ndevelop substance knowledge pedagogy as well as to create\nfacilities to systematic cooperation between the work place\nand educational institution.\nThis research will examine how teachers experienced\nwork placement periods with respect to both professional\ncompetence and pedagogical development. Professional\nknowledge was expected to become updated and profes-\nsional awareness strengthened. Work placement periods\nwere expected to offer possibilities to reflect on the aims,\nmethods, and assessment criteria of students as well as the\ndevelopmental trends in education together with work life\nOne of the authors participated personally in work place-\nment periods and simultaneously acted as a participant\nobserver in a concert project of vocational music teachers at\nconservatory. The project was planned and implemented\ntogether with professional musicians. Six (F = 6) musical\nperformances were prepared, rehearsed, and presented in\nauthor's experience, careful planning of the training periods\nwas very important, because it was directly connected to the\nexperienced successes. The central aim of all the prepara-\ntions was the development of a teacher's personal compe-\ntence through the successful realization of the authentic work\nplacement period.\nThe author's experiences were in accordance with the\nresearch literature on work life learning, although the imple-\nmentation was not typical. The work placement period was\npositive concerning professional competence, growth of pro-\nfessional awareness, and motivation.\nThis qualitative case study will examine how working in\nprofessional work communities is connected to the compe-\ntence of teachers. The article will approach learning from the\nsociocultural viewpoint understanding the development of\ncompetence as constructing new knowledge and skills\nthrough joint processes in the communities of practice (Lave\nexplain how acting in the communities of practice in the field\nof expertise will affect learning in vocational education con-\ntexts. The research questions were as follows:\nResearch Question 1: How is work life learning con-\nnected to a vocational teacher's expertise?\nResearch Question 2: How is acting as a musician in the\nworkshop connected to learning?\nThe study will first examine the expertise and sociocul-\ntural learning of a vocational teacher. Next, the study will\nexamine the role of a teacher's work placement periods\nfrom the viewpoint of expertise development. The study\noutcomes will then be compared with the researcher's per-\nsonal experiences of his work placement periods in the field\nof music.\nIncreasing In-Service Teachers' Professional\nCompetence\nThe contents of an in-service vocational teacher's compe-\ntence are not permanent. Some researchers (e.g., Boreham,\nthe needs of work life change as do education, technical\ndevelopment and production, and action policies.\nOrganizational structures are flexible. Knowledge of educa-\ntional areas, professional practices, and the expectations of\nvocational education also change.\nIn educational research (e.g., Bereiter & Scardamalia,\nexpertise have been dealt with as practical, experiential\nknowledge. It is a feature which shows theoretical knowl-\nedge and practical skill as merged into professional compe-\ntence. Becoming an expert requires a long and appropriate\nprocess of learning.\nHowever, any experiences do not make an expert\n(Bereiter, 2002). In a changing work life, the core of exper-\ntise is the ability to solve problems. For that reason, expertise\nwill develop in the duties which require problem solutions\n(Chi, 2006) as well as the ability to adapt the gained knowl-\nedge in new situations (Hatano & Inagaki, 1992).\nHelakorpi (2007) divides a vocational teacher's expertise\ninto four competence areas: substance, pedagogy, develop-\nment, and working community (Figure 1). The two first men-\ntioned are convergent with Tiilikkala's (2004) classification.\nHelakorpi includes interaction and personality in pedagogi-\ncal expertise but sees personal and work life\u00adoriented devel-\nopmental competences, as well as work community skills, as\nseparate aspects. They emphasize the reflectivity of a teach-\ner's work, that is, ongoing observation and assessment, in\nvarious subareas of expertise as shown in Figure 1.\nThe figure shows how the development of expertise\nrequires teachers' continuing reflective observation of their\nactions. They have to assess their levels of competence and\nset goals for development. At work, they have to try to recog-\nnize the developmental goals and improve their achieve-\nments (Ericsson, 2006). Competence requirements\npresuppose keeping up with the times and anticipation\nof future changes. It is not possible only by acting in a\nVirkkula and Nissil\u00e4 3\nschool-centered way, but the teacher has to seek continuing\neducation and practical experiences in work life (Illeris, 2011).\nSocial Dimension of Learning\nTo develop teachers'competences in Finnish vocational edu-\ncation, teachers' work placement periods are arranged to\nallow for teachers to work in authentic work tasks in the\nwork places of their own fields (Finnish Ministry of\nEducation and Culture, 2011). It is typical for these periods\nto be committed to sociocultural learning in communities of\npractice.\nLave and Wenger (1991) studied the apprenticeship learn-\ning, for example, in West African societies and noticed that\nlearning was tied to the learners'growing possibilities to par-\nticipate in the activities of the communities. When studying\nthe learning of a tailor's apprentices, Lave and Wenger\nnoticed that it was practical work that structured the knowl-\nedge and skills needed at work and added to the commitment\nto more responsible tasks. Through the experiences of\nauthentic work tasks, they learnt the process of tailoring\nclothes, and the complexity of the tasks increased along with\nlearning.\nlearning takes place in small groups of cooperation, that is,\ncommunities of practice. They are joined together through\nthree factors: joint enterprise, mutual engagement, and\nshared repertoire. The last-mentioned factor refers to the\ninteraction traditions, artifacts, action, and concepts of the\ncommunity. The members have common history and shared\nexperiences which form the basis of certain ways of acting.\nIn the learning taking place in communities of practice,\nfour starting points will be noticed: (a) man is a social crea-\nture which connects learning to social situations, (b)\nknowledge is competence connected to a certain matter (for\ninstance, making music, repairing machines, writing poems),\n(c) knowing is participation to attain competence, and (d)\nmeaning is the output of learning. Learning is connected to\nReflection between members has an essential role as a\npart of goal-oriented communal learning. The starting points\nof action, process, and contents (e.g., the decisions made and\nconceptions followed from them) are evaluated critically,\nwhich promotes the construction of shared understanding,\nlearning from others, and questioning everyday beliefs and\nmatters taken for granted. Subsequently, the organized\nunderstanding will assist in dealing with arising situations\nWenger's views on the social character of learning can be\nseen as a communal interpretation of Russian researcher Lev\nVygotsky's theory on the importance of social relationships\nin learning. Vygotsky (1978) presented that learning takes\nplace at two levels: (a) as inter-psychological construction of\nknowledge between individuals in social interaction and (b)\nas an individual's intra-psychological process. In these both\ninterpretations, interaction, action, and concepts have sig-\nnificant roles.\nResearch Design and Method\nThe aim of this study is to explain how work placement\nperiod is connected to an in-service teacher's competence.\nThe study examined vocational teachers' (N = 552) experi-\nences during the assignments, based on the reports of several\nwork placement period projects (Research Question 1) as\nwell as the researcher's own experiences in work placement\nperiods in the field of music (Research Question 2).\nThe research design was a case study and was intended to\nbe the study of lived experiences. The data sets include\nPedagogical sub-area\n- Pedagogical skills\n- Mastering of educational processes\nReflection\n- Conceptions of learning and education\nSub-area of substance\n- Professional know-how\n- Work life skills\nReflection\n- Developing professional area and its\ninfluence on competence\nSub-area of development\n- Developing personal competences\n- Developing one\u00b4s substance area and work\nlife\nReflection\n- Developing research and development\ncompetences\nSub-area of work communities\n- Economic and administrative competences\n- Teamwork and networking skills\nReflection\n- Networking and teamwork competences\nFigure 1. Vocational teacher's expertise and the targets of reflection.\n4 SAGE Open\nwritten reports, background statistics, and classroom action/\ncontext participant observations. The data sources are com-\nplementary and yield detailed experiential information\nvocalized by the participants. The experiences of vocational\nin-service teachers were collected from the reports from the\nwork life assignments and the researcher's own experiences\nfrom notebook entries recorded during participant observa-\ntion. It is typical in case studies to collect material in differ-\nent ways, for example, from written sources, literary\ndocuments, and participant observation (Stake, 1995; Yin,\n2009). The procedures make the researcher's knowledge of\nthe case more many-sided and build the basis of the research\nreliability and validity (Kothari, 2004).\nThe research material was analyzed by content analysis\nwhich is a widely used method in the systematic analyzing of\ndifferent materials in qualitative research. When content\nanalysis is used, the research material is organized themati-\ncally for the matter of interest to be interpreted and described\nclearly. The actual analysis is done, for example, of a text\nwhich can be either a literal source or written by the research\nstudy, the aim is to examine whether there is evidence of\nconnections of work placement periods to vocational teach-\ners' competence according to the teachers' own experiences.\nThe theoretical framework for the examination was created\nby sociocultural learning in communities of practice.\nReliability is improved by the triangulation of inferences\nacross multiple data sources. Case studies often tend to com-\nbine various materials and research methods and include sev-\neral researchers in the process. This practice aims to decrease\nthe influence of a single method on the results. Using multi-\nple methods strengthens validity, when the researchers com-\nbine methods which are different from each other, for\nexample, literal material and personal experiences, in exam-\nining the research objects (Cohen, Manion, & Morrison,\nResults and Discussion--Advantage\nof Work Placement Periods for\nVocational Teacher\nThe work placement period of multi-subject vocational in-\nservice teachers means in this context a sequence of planned\ntraining in work communities or enterprises in the teachers'\nfields of substance. The work places offer possibilities for\nupdating and developing professional expertise and give per-\nspectives to choose study contents for students to meet the\nfuture needs of work life after qualification (Cort et al.,\n2004). The earlier findings concerning teachers' work place-\nment periods and their benefits are introduced here first as a\ntype of reference material which allows making comparisons\nto the new data collected and analyzed for this research.\nThe information service system of the ESF (2012) lists\naltogether 18 different vocational development projects in\nber of the participants in the assignments; for a total of 376\nteachers. In the Kokeva Start project, carried out over the\nassignments, after which they evaluated their success\nThe first finding was that according to the project reports\ners (N = 552) felt that during their work placement periods\nthey could create genuine interaction that was significant in\nthe joint development of the education between schools and\nbe seen both in the promotion of teachers' personal compe-\ntences and concrete integration of the school and work place\nactions. Personal benefits include all fields of vocational\nteachers' professional competences, as Figure 2 shows.\nThe benefit from the cooperation is based on increased\ndialogue. Educational institutions, teachers, and work life\nhave become closer to each other more productively than\nPedagogical sub-area\n- Basics of work-oriented planning and\nimplementation of teaching\n- Basics of guiding and evaluation of\nstudents become clarified\nSub-area of substance\n- New work-oriented view on the work of\none\u00b4s special area\nSub-area of development\n- Engaging work life in the development of\neducation\n- Basics of work life oriented research and\ndevelopment of teaching\nSub-area of work communities\n- Joint projects with work life\n- Increase of motivation and coping at work\nFigure 2. The most central benefits of teachers' work life assignments compared with the subareas of expertise according to the\nfeedback information.\nVirkkula and Nissil\u00e4 5\nbefore (cf. Tanttu, 2006). The teachers' comments in the\npresent study describe how work placement period offers the\npossibility to reflect on daily action, improves expertise, and\nthus provokes new ideas concerning the development of edu-\nI got a chance to do different kind of work than I had earlier got\nused to. So the work placement period widened my expertise.\n. . . we had very fruitful unofficial discussions at the coffee table\non the challenges of the education for the job in question. . . .\nDue to these discussions my thoughts about the realization of\ndemonstrating vocational skills were changed to a more realistic\ndirection.\nThe work life assignment was very rewarding and its contents\nmany-sided. I went there to get substance knowledge, but I\ngained much more. New things and applications showed up\ndaily in the form of development ideas and practical examples\nfor teaching.\nIt was rewarding to realize that previously acquired nursing\nexpertise still exists in \"real work.\" Outstandingly nice were the\ncustomer contacts and the positive feedback that I have received\nfrom them.\nThe teachers found it easier to develop teaching methods\ntoward greater work life orientation when they were con-\ncretely aware of the topical practices and policies in the\nrespective working fields. During work placement period,\nthe teachers also got an understanding of the situations in\nwhich the students are when they go on their learning-\nat-work training. However, they got the understanding of the\nchallenges that a learning-at-work student brings to the work\nlife.\nWork placement period reminded me of the work life based\nattitude and thinking. In a teacher's work thoughts easily circle\naround school and teaching. In the future I need closer\ncooperation with the enterprises than before.\nA learning-at-work student is firstly faced with many new\nthings; time is spent getting to know the workmates and the\npractices of the work place. From the viewpoint of the employer,\nrelatively a lot of time is spent on the initiation when compared\nto the expected benefit.\nSecond, for educational institutions, work placement\nperiods offered a tool to observe the quality of education, a\nmethod to widen cooperation networks, a possibility to\ndevelop local and regional work life, and the educational\norganization as a service organization (cf. Frisk, 2014;\nDue to the cooperation, work life was informed, for\nexample, about the evaluation of a student and of the con-\ntents, purposes, and realization of curricula. Work life repre-\nsentatives also observed that they had been given a possibility\nto influence educational development (cf. Frisk, 2014;\nrepresentatives responded that due to work placement peri-\nods teachers \"can teach more practically,\" and 43% responded\nthat teachers \"got new ideas for teaching\" (p. 36).\nWhat are the concrete results of work placement periods\nin the long term? To summarize, the following outcomes\nwere found among the multi-subject teachers in the present\n1. Work motivation was improved.\n2. Pursuit to maintain and develop work life contacts\nwas increased.\n3. Teaching plans and their implementation were devel-\noped to the direction of work life needs--The con-\nnections of learning at work and to educational\ninstitutions were improved.\n4. Work places got interested in and were better\ninformed about education.\n5. The quality of learning at work improved.\nWork Placement Periods in Music Education\nIn music education, the aim was to create an interactive\nmodel for cooperation between an institution and work life\nwhich also included in-service teachers' work placement\nperiods. The starting point was an approach emphasizing\ncollaboration, interaction, and the context of learning (cf.\nBillett, 2002). Essential was the teacher's chance to work\ntogether with a professional musician to plan and implement\nperformances.\nA challenge emerged to integrate the earlier mentioned\naspects and work life cooperation. How can a teacher's work\nplacement period include active cooperation in both authen-\ntic music communities and constructive social interaction?\nTasks connected directly to a musician's work, crossing the\nborder between education and work life, as well as the proj-\nect work guided by a professional musician were all seen as\nfunctional solutions (cf. Jarvis, Holford, & Griffin, 2003).\nBased on the above visions, a method was developed for\nmusic teachers to be suitable to workshop activities during\nwork placement periods and to help teachers gain as much as\npossible from them. In the workshop method, teachers per-\nformed concerts together with professional musicians.\nWorkshops included preparation of the music to be per-\nformed, personal instrumental rehearsing, as well as ensem-\nble work. Workshops were concluded with an evaluation\nmeeting in which the central matters of the final product and\nlearning were discussed. Figure 3 presents the basic idea of\nthe activities and the process.\nThe figure shows that the action model in the workshop\nwas flexible. It allowed variable productions according to the\nthemes. Furthermore, the conversion to different needs and\nnew purposes had been programmed into the model.\n6 SAGE Open\nThe first findings of music workshops, in other words,\nresembled that of multi-subject teachers: As a learning envi-\nronment, the music workshops followed contemporary\nrequirements and served the needs of work life and education\nin many ways. Participation at workshops was two-dimen-\nsional: It was about participating in workshop activities, but\nfrom a wider point of view, the teacher was also simultane-\nously engaging with the music community, in both of which\nthe learning experiences were acquired by doing. Central to\nworkshop activities was to realize the joint enterprise of pro-\nducing music and carrying out a successful performance (cf.\none direction of developing work life assignments in the near\nfuture.\nThe second finding was the added value of the work place-\nment periods (F = 6) in music; what the author experienced\nhimself correlates to multi-subject vocational teachers' work\nplacement periods. The author had the chance to participate\nin the music community's activities: test competences and\nskills concerning his substance knowledge in respect to the\nrequirements of the field, for instance, in how to adopt artis-\ntically challenging music in a limited time.\nMusic was challenging especially due to tight comping and\ndifficult playing parts. I did a lot of preparation work, i.e.,\nlistening to the original versions, writing down and of course\nSuccess in the tasks of the work placement period required\nmutual engagement and relevant usage of shared repertoire\nfrom the members of the workshop.\nWork placement period thus influenced the motivation of\nthe music teachers, for instance, through the development of\nsubstance competence. Working together with a professional\nmusician challenged one to reflect on one's own compe-\ntences and development needs. Through goal-oriented coop-\neration and practicing work tasks, the shared result was\nThe material this time was very challenging. Technically, playing\npresented challenges I had not earlier faced. It required a lot of\npersonal practice. The professional musician represented,\nmoreover, the top of the world in his expertise and was very\ndemanding in the relationship with the playing mates. . . . (After\nthe concert) it was nice to notice how we could perform the concert\nmaterial together which felt impossible beforehand. (GH 09)\nFrom a pedagogical point of view the work placement\nperiod made the author better equipped to guide the students'\nlearning-at-work trainings and to prepare them for the voca-\ntional demonstration tests. Reflective interaction and dia-\nlogue with professional musicians and their interest groups\nbrought new views on the development and realization of\nvarious parts of qualification requirements (cf. Mezirow,\nvia concerts were totally moved into work life, into authentic\nwork contexts.\nThe goals of work placement periods were thus attained\nconsiderably well. The author received important experi-\nences about the days of professional musicians and a good\npicture of their many-sided work. The thing to be devel-\noped most urgently concerns the length of the periods,\nwhich should be long enough to give a sufficiently clear\npicture of the work life of musicians. The author's\npersonal experience confirms and illustrates the research\noutcomes:\nThe planning of the period started in the previous spring when\nwe stated the contents and aims. Our idea was to perform the\nmusic of Miles Davis' disc Birth of the Cool according to the\nmost original versions. . . . Our orchestra consisted of teachers\nand professional musicians, to bring the viewpoint of work life\ninto the activities of the workshop. . . . Work life was also\nrepresented by the concert houses where the performances were\ncarried out. Marketing and advertising procedures were planned\nwith them. I got a lot of experience on how to plan and implement\na collaborative concert project in the network of music.\nConclusion\nVocational in-service teachers, both multi-subject and music\nteachers are important players in increasing cooperation\nbetween educational institutions and work life. Carefully\nplanned and skillfully guided work in participants'substance\nfields predisposes them to the up-to-date practices of the\nfield and creates preconditions to benefit from them. Work\nlife experiences offer them chances to (a) confirm their\nknowledge of the practices and work cultures in the field, (b)\nevaluate and reflect on the professional theory and practice\nof the field, and (c) make good use of refreshed conceptions\nto develop practices. Positive experiences from connecting\ntheory to practice also added to their motivation to work or\nstudy and also the feeling of self-respect.\nFigure 3. The basic idea of the activities in the musicians' workshop.\nVirkkula and Nissil\u00e4 7\nCooperation with the professionals in the same field\nstrengthened the teachers' competence and growth in the\nmembership of their work communities according to socio-\nment periods created a basis for a gradually deepening\nparticipation in the activities of the working community (see\nLave & Wenger, 1991). During the work placement period, a\nteacher (a) participates in the action of the work community\nin authentic work situations and (b) shares joint goals and\ntakes responsibility for them. (c) The action is based on the\ninteraction between the members. (d) Knowledge is the com-\npetence connected to work, and (e) the members give mean-\nings to competence and reflect on the work.\nCooperation opens opportunities to improve the quality of\neducation. In-service teachers can develop curricula together\nand with work life representatives, develop plans for learn-\ning-at-work periods for teachers and students, develop plans\nfor vocational demonstration tests, and prepare joint proj-\nects. They can also plan student guidance and assessment\nand work for quality assurance. Work life projects have\nchanged the teacher's role from a school official to the facili-\ntator of learning, lifelong learner, cooperator, as well as a\nmany-sided expert of vocational education. The change of\nroles will inevitably influence the work identities of teachers.\nIn the future, a kind of swapping with work life will deepen\nthe companionship of educational institutions and work life\nand benefit both parties: The teachers will share their theo-\nretical understanding and practical knowing with work life\nrepresentatives who will offer their collaborators real work\nlife situations. Thus, both theory and practice will be\nintertwined.\nEducation should be compiled and based on a dynamic\nview of learning and teaching. It means education which is\ntransformative and able to answer new demands. Theoretical\nconceptions behind the daily practices should be given atten-\ntion to. Besides factual contents, that is, technical skills and\ncontent knowledge, the participants should increase their\nskills in acting in work life and their self-knowledge to end\nup in self-efficacy and autonomy. We should aim at both life-\nwide and lifelong learning and pursue a deep understanding\nof dialogical interaction in learning and teaching.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAppelbaum, E., & Batt, R.
