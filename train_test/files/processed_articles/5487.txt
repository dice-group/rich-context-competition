A turning point has been the discovery that the true spatial distribution of coronal\nbrightness can neither be seen nor imaged on account of its unprecedented dynamic range.\npossessed the extraordinary skill of painting from memory what he saw for only a brief time.\nHis remarkable but forgotten eclipse paintings are, therefore, ideal for capturing and representing\nbest the perceptual experience of the visible corona.

The closure in understanding solar eclipses through the convergence\nof perception, art, imaging, science and the history of science promises to enrich the experience of\nviewing and photographing the first solar eclipse of the 21st century in the United States on 21st\n",

Although he had never seen a total eclipse, he drew up meticulous scientific plans to\nprepare for the 1918 eclipse (Butler, 1919), and executed them with the same artistic ability\nthat served him well in painting transient phenomena such as sunsets and the aurora borealis.\nThe finished painting eventually graced the Hayden Planetarium's rotunda (Lawrence &\nMilner, 2000). Astronomers who saw the painting and the 1918 eclipse looked upon it as a\nmarvel of perfection, true both to form and colour, a work of art that had the advantage of\nbeing scientifically accurate (Mitchell, 1919).\nStreaming charged particles from the Sun are known as the solar wind. Scientists studying\nthe solar wind turned to eclipse images for clues to its source at the Sun. One difference sets\nButler's paintings apart from the imaged corona. As seen in Figures 1 and 2, dark regions at\nthe base of the corona near the poles of the Sun give the impression of holes opening up and\ndiverging from the limb of the Sun. They are present in the imaged corona (top), but not in\nthe paintings (bottom). Diverging-hole regions are crucial for exploring and understanding\nthe solar wind, because they identified the source of the solar wind (Hundhausen, 1977;\nZirker, 1977). The recent Ulysses mission, the first to send a spacecraft out of the ecliptic\nplane, measured the high-latitude fast wind and used coronal images to confirm diverging\npolar coronal holes as its source at the Sun (Balogh, Marsden, & Smith, 2001).\nFigure 3, a reproduction of Figure 4 in Woo (2005), shows a coronal image obtained by\nthe ground-based High Altitude Observatory Mauna Loa Mk III K\u00adcoronameter (Fisher,\nLee, MacQueen, & Poland, 1981). It demonstrates how diverging-hole regions appear and\ndisappear in images when the level of brightness intensity is adjusted. When the level of\nbrightness of Figure 3a is increased, the `missing' corona from the diverging-hole regions\nappears in Figure 3b while the streamers remain. The missing corona from the image in\nFigure 3a is confirmed by its detection in the underlying brightness measurements. These\nresults illustrate that, consistent with Butler's paintings, the diverging-hole regions actually\nrepresent regions of the corona whose extent, determined by the threshold sensitivity of the\ninstrument or the naked eye, is shortest (Woo, 2005).\nCoronal images informed first on the process of visual perception (Carbon, 2014; Gregory,\n1970) through the presence of coronal streamers (Woo, 2011). Visual perception captured in\nButler's paintings now informs on the processing of coronal images through the absence of\ndiverging-hole regions. Unlike visual perception, producers of the images controlled the level\nof the subtracted radial falloff in brightness without affecting the presence of streamers. Solar\nwind scientists favoured the level corresponding to diverging-hole regions, because these\nidentified the source of the solar wind. The true brightness distribution can only be\nrepresented by quantitative measurements. Investigations based on them confirm the\nsource of fast solar wind is not limited to diverging-hole regions at the Sun (Woo &\nHabbal, 1999), reinforcing that determining the source of the solar wind requires\nexploration that goes beyond the use of imaging (Darius, 1990) and our senses (Tyson, 2001).\nIn conclusion, the trust of coronal imaging in solar wind research reflects the comments\nby Kemp (2014) in regard to the production and manipulation of images in this digital age:\n``In the broadest sense, every act of representation is purposefully selective, just as our acts of\nseeing. With even the most basic of photographs, depth of field, focus, point of view, lighting, and\nexposure all serve advertently or inadvertently to include or emphasize some features to exclude\nor downplay others. This is to say nothing of its subsequent printing and transmission. The\nscientist, even more than the casual maker of family snapshots, is in the business of selective\nvisual pointing. And the scientist makes sure that the look of the image manifests all the signs of\nauthenticity that are current at the time of its making and reception.\nThe essential nature of the issue of visual trust in representations has not changed over time, even\nif the scope for convincing deception has increased in ways that increasingly defy ready detection.\nWe have in practice to work with levels of visual trust, otherwise we could not realistically\nproceed. Visually, we are trusting beings. As such, our current vulnerability is not essentially\ndifferent in kind from our predecessors'; it is just far greater in extent.''\nFigure 2.
