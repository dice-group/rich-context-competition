The Ministry of Earth Sciences evolved a unique moored observatory `IndARC' with suite of sensors for\nphysico-chemical and oceanographic in situ long-term data collection. The Arctic Ocean plays an important role in\ngoverning the earth's climate and also faithfully records its past climatic history and represents a significant gap in\nocean observations. This indigenously designed and installed observatory IndARC, for the first time, collected various\nparameters from July 2014 to July 2015. The uniqueness of this system, the challenges faced and results from data\ncollected are presented in this article.\n",

The Arctic is\nundergoing significant transformation as a result of cli-\nmate change and increased human use including marine\ntransportation, tourism and resource development. The\nhighly uncertain sensitivity of the carbon cycle of the\nArctic to the projected climate change is a major issue of\nglobal concern. Studies during the 1990s suggest that the\nArctic has been a sink for atmospheric CO2\n. The impacts\nof climate change in the Arctic will be felt throughout\nthe world because changes in physical processes here\ninfluence the climate on a global scale. Processes of\nchange in the Arctic can therefore provide a unique\ninsight into the climate change that is already taking\nplace and also act as a forewarning of the future regional\nand global impacts of these changes.\nChallenges in continuous data\ncollection\nIn the Arctic, continuous ocean observations are quite\nsparse, except for the surface where satellite data\ncollection is possible. It is thus a challenging environment\nto monitor. The region is not well covered by satellites, and\nheavy cloud cover often limits their use. Buoy and float\nsystems are a highly promising way to take measurements\nin the depths of the ocean. Here, the major challenge is to\nbuild up expertise and capacity to develop new observing\nsystems suitable for the Arctic environmental conditions.\nAmajor knowledge gap in this region is due to the lack of\nlong-term, multidisciplinary inter-annual data spanning both\nthe summer and ice-covered winter seasons. In particular, the\nNorth Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and/or Arctic oscillation\n(AO) are the major components of inter-annual variability in\nthe NorthAtlantic andArctic area.

This need to continuously monitor\nocean parameters for extended periods was a driving force\nfor the development of moorings in the arctic region. Hence\nit was decided to deploy a multi-sensor mooring within the\nKongsfjorden, along with complementary ongoing field sur-\nveys. India has now established its first multi-sensor moored\nobservatory in the Kongsfjorden. The IndARC deployment\ncan be certainly considered as a significant achievement and\na testimony to the capabilities of the Earth System Science\nOrganization (ESSO) in designing, developing and installing\nunderwater observatories. The data acquired will be of vital\nimportance to the Indian climate researchers as well as to the\ninternational fraternity.\nIndia's first mooring in Arctic\nA major milestone in India's scientific endeavours in the\na team of scientists from ESSO\u00adNational Institute of\nOcean Technology (NIOT) and ESSO\u00adNational Centre for\nAntarctic and Ocean Research (NCAOR) successfully\ndeployed the IndARC system, the country's first multi-\nsensor moored observatory in the Kongsfjorden fjord of\nthe Arctic, roughly half way between Norway and the\nNorth Pole (Figure 1). The fjord lays adjacent to both\nArctic and Atlantic water masses. It is an open fjord, with-\nout sill, and therefore is largely influenced by the processes\non the adjacent shelf. With five tidewater glaciers,\nKongsfjorden acts as a natural laboratory to study the cli-\nmatic impacts of global warming, the localArctic warming\nas explained by Yongqi Gao et al.(2009), the consequent\nglacial melt and the impacts of freshwater discharge. This\nis also an established reference site for Arctic marine stud-\nies as it receives variable Arctic/Atlantic climatic signals\nbetween years with measurable effects on the physical and\nbiological systems. With established research facilities\navailable, there is a great potential for international, multi-\ndisciplinary collaborations.\nDesign of IndARC\nThe moored observatory included measurements of cur-\nrent speed and direction, salinity, temperature and\nFigure 1. IndARC \u00ad Deployment Location at Kongsfjorden, Arctic.\nVenkatesan et al. 57\ndissolved oxygen. Data were measured for a year from\nJuly 2014. A key challenge was the presence of ice cover,\nsea ice, floating ice and drifting icebergs with >20m\ndraft, which challenged conventional methods of measur-\ning near the surface. This was overcome using a weak link\nm separating a surface part of the mooring with a\ndeeper part. If heavy loads are experienced on the moor-\ning due to icebergs, the link will give away and the main\nmooring will remain safe. Floats fixed above the weak\nlink section will surface the upper delinked portion and a\nbeacon at the top float will emit signal to identify the\nfloating location. This can be monitored from shore and\nthe sensors and data can be retrieved.\nSalinity, temperature and oxygen were measured using\nmultiple SEABIRD-SBE37-SMP-ODO with internal bat-\nteries, memory and integral pump. Currents were meas-\nured using a single-point Nortek current meter and an\nAcoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP). Both meas-\nured three-component (East, North, Up) velocity using\nAcoustic Doppler technology. All plastic and titanium\nparts eliminated corrosion.1 The ADCP is a hydro-acous-\ntic current meter similar to sonar, measuring water current\nvelocities over a 170-m depth range using the Doppler\neffect of sound waves scattered back from particles within\nthe water column. The unit has no moving parts that can\nbe blocked or damaged.\nTechnology is the fundamental requirement to make\nocean observations, and a reliable platform is an absolute\nneed to undertake long-term in situ observations. The\nmooring is designed with a buoyancy of 617kg compris-\nkg\nbuoyancy, using OrcaFlex software. The Argos beacon\nattached to IndARC offers selectable preset frequency\nchannels, along with a range of duty cycle options, result-\ning in a range of broadcast specifications. Powered with\nlithium batteries, this miniature recovery aid is designed\nfor long-term ocean deployments. The Mini Beacon\nhousing includes an integrated conductivity sensor that\nisolates the unit's power while submerged and activates\nthe device upon surfacing. The Acoustic Release unit has\nbeen selected to suit arctic conditions with the capability\nto withstand the load experienced on the mooring. Two\nIXSEA Acoustic releases were connected in tandem to\nserve as a redundant recovery node in mooring.\nTesting of IndARC subcomponents\nIn order to ascertain the performance of the sensors and\nsubcomponents, testing of all of the sensors and other\naccessories at low temperature was carried out using the\nenvironmental chamber facility at ESSO-NIOT. The\nenvironmental chamber can test components in the tem-\nperature range of -45\u00b0C to +180\u00b0C and a humidity range\nof 10%\u00ad98% relative humidity (RH). Online measure-\nments of the components were executed simultaneously\nduring low temperature condition. The O-rings were also\nsubjected to very low temperature of -20\u00b0C and tested.\nThe float with a mechanical fixture for holding the\nSatellite telemetry beacon was fabricated in-house and\ntested for stability and upright verticality of the Beacon\nat Acoustic Test Facility Tank at ESSO-NIOT. The instru-\nments selected for IndARC have been programmed to\nwork continuously for 1\nyear to collect real-time data.\nThe power source requirements have been specially\nselected so that data collection is continuous without\ninterruption. The sampling depth is duly selected and the\nmooring design has been accordingly configured for\npoint and profile sampling.\nDeployment of IndARC\nThe IndARC-I moored observatory was deployed and\nrecovered from the Norwegian Polar Institute's research\nabout 1100km away from the North Pole at a water depth\nFigure 2. Glaciers near IndARC location.\nFigure 3. Deployment of IndARC II at Kongsjorden, Arctic.\n58 The International Journal of Ocean and Climate Systems 7(2)\nm. It has an array of 10 state-of-the-art oceano-\ngraphic sensors strategically positioned at discrete depths\nin the water column (Figures 4). Seawater temperature and\nsalinity data were collected from discrete depths at 22, 30,\nmoored observatory was successfully retrieved on 15 July\n2015. The data from all the sensors were downloaded suc-\ncessfully. Subsequently, the IndARC II mooring with addi-\ntional sensors to measure photosynthetically active\nradiation (PAR), nitrate and ambient noise was deployed\nAnalysis of collected data\nThe temperature at all depths showed an annual cycle with\nmaximum temperature of 7\u00b0C recorded during August and\nminimum of -1.5\u00b0C during February (Figure 5).This phe-\nnomenon was also reported by O.M. Johannessen et al.\nby Suzanne E. MacLachlan et al. (2007) at all depths, with\ndrastic changes observed during August\u00adSeptember 2014\nwhere the salinity dropped by almost 2.7\nPSU (Figure 6).\nAnother lowest salinity was observed during November at\nrecorded minimum value of 6.6\nmL/L during September\nand peaked during the month of May with a reading of\n9.5mL/L (Figure 7). During May, the oxygen content in the\nwater increased drastically from 7.7 to 9.5mL/L. The pri-\nmary findings reveal that the fjord waters are well mixed\nduring December to April. A strong north-westward current\nduring May, suddenly increased the oxygen content of the\nFigure 4. Configuration of IndARC system.\nFigure 5.

Salinity at various depths (sampling \u00ad 60minutes) in\nVenkatesan et al. 59\nregion; thereafter, the waters became stratified. This effect\nis attributed to the freshwater released by melting ice,\nwhich confines phytoplankton to the upper sunlit layer,\nresulting in a biological bloom as reported by Kevin R\nArrigo et al. (2012). The zonal, meridional and vertical cur-\nrent obtained from the ADCP showed strong westward cur-\nrents during September and May as shown by the top panel\nin Figure 8.This is also reported by F.R. Cottier et al.\n(2005). The strong westward currents during May also\ncoincided with strong northward and positive entrainment\nas represented by the middle and bottom panels. Similar\nstrong currents were observed in the fjord during September\nand May by another mooring deployed by The Scottish\nAssociation of Marine Sciences (SAMS), UK. This strong\ncurrent has also driven the drastic increase of oxygen at\nm depth was plotted against current speed\nobtained from the single point current meter as shown in\nFigure 9. Both the instruments showed a peak in current\nmm/s during May. During the last week of\nSeptember 2014, passage of strong current was recorded by\ntilt and heading sensors of ADCP too. There was a sudden\ndip in the surface temperature of 2\u00b0C during this period as\nreported in F. R. Cottier et al. (2007). The preliminary\nobservation shows that the fjord water column is stratified\nduring summer and it is well mixed during winter. The\nobservations also show strong diurnal and intraseasonal\nvariabilities, and these features will be reported in the sub-\nsequent article with detailed analysis.\nIndia has become a significant contributor to Arctic sci-\nentific advancements. The Arctic Ocean plays a major role\nin driving the world's ocean circulation, which impacts the\ndistribution of heat across the globe and the global climate.\nSuccess of this study encourages continuing this observa-\ntion on a long-term basis which would enable India to\ndevelop a bio-physical regional model in the Kongsfjorden,\nArctic region for better understanding of the system as\nseen in the website. The performance of sensors under\nimmersed condition is affected by marine fouling organ-\nisms. Figure 10 shows one of the most abundant branched\nFigure 7.

This growth is seen on the sensors\nwhich were mounted near to the seabed and abrasion of\nsolid particles from Glaciers would have prevented their\nlarval settlement.\nClosure\nNew suite of sensors was added during deployment of\nIndARC II mooring in the fjord. Data retrieval mechanism\nfor downloading the data at routine intervals during sum-\nmer is being planned for the upcoming deployments.\n"
