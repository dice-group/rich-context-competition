This article estimates racial/ethnic- and education-\nrelated disparities and examines trends in uncontrolled CVD risk factors among adults with\ndiabetes. The main racial/ethnic comparisons made are with African Americans versus non-\nLatino whites and Mexican Americans versus non-Latino whites.\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSdThe analysis samples include adults aged $20\nyears from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1988\u00ad1994 and\nlates of binary indicators measuring 1) high blood glucose, 2) high blood pressure, 3) high\ncholesterol, and 4) smoking.\nRESULTSdControl of blood glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol improved among indi-\nwas no change in smoking prevalence. In the NHANES 1999\u00ad2008, racial/ethnic minorities and\nindividuals without some college education were more likely to have poorly controlled blood\nglucose compared with non-Latino whites and those with some college education. In addition,\nindividuals with diabetes who had at least some college education were less likely to smoke and\nhad better blood pressure control compared with individuals with diabetes without at least some\ncollege education.\nCONCLUSIONSdTrends in CVD risk factors among individuals with diabetes improved\nover the past 2 decades, but racial/ethnic- and education-related disparities have emerged in\nsome areas.\nDiabetes is a leading cause of morbidity\nand mortality in the U.S., and the\nprevalence of this disease is rising\n(1). The Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention, based on data from the National\nHealth Interview Survey, estimated that the\nage-adjusted prevalence of diagnosed diabe-\nassociated with diabetes in the U.S. were\n~33% ($58 billion) of the total cost being\nattributed to treatment of medical com-\nplications (3). Cardiovascular disease\n(CVD) is a widely documented potential\ncomplication of diabetes and a leading\ncause of mortality among individuals\nwith diabetes (4\u00ad6). Although rates of\nCVD events have declined in recent de-\ncades among both individuals with and\nwithout diabetes, people with diabetes still\nare twice as likely as those without diabetes\nto experience a CVD event (4), and individ-\nuals with diabetes have heart disease mor-\ntality rates that are two to four times greater\nthan those without diabetes (6).\nTo prevent CVD and other complica-\ntions of diabetes, the American Diabetes\nupdated standards for diabetes screening,\ndiagnosis, and therapeutic care (7). These\nguidelines, which reflect new evidence\nfrom epidemiological studies and random-\nizedcontrolledtrials,includedtargetsforgly-\ncemic control, blood pressure control, lipid\ncontrol, and smoking (7).

Recent research based\non individuals with diabetes interviewed in\ntrend of improvement in CVD risk factors\nand, notably, reductions in the predicted\n10-year risk of coronary heart disease (16),\nbut some findings show that socioeconomic\nstatus and racial/ethnic disparities persist\nbuilt on these important new results by 1)\nexamining trends in the prevalence of di-\nagnosed diabetes and the sociodemo-\ngraphic characteristics of the diagnosed\ndiabetic population and 2) testing for\nracial/ethnic- and education-related dis-\nparities in poorly controlled risk factors\nfor CVD among individuals with diag-\nnosed diabetes. Given the mounting body\nof evidence showing the importance of\ncontrolling CVD risk factors (7) and the\nincreasing focus on prevention in the\ncritical to document current trends in\nthe control of CVD risk factors among\nindividuals with diabetes and to examine\nwhether any improvements have been\nconcentrated in particular sociodemo-\ngraphic groups.\nMETHODS\nStudy population and analysis\nsamples\nWe used two samples, a sample from the\nused a stratified, multistage probability-\nsampling frameandrepresentedthecivilian,\nnoninstitutionalized U.S. population. The\nindividuals aged $20 years. We limited\nof these respondents who reported having\nbeen diagnosed with diabetes. In the\naged $20 years were interviewed, and we\nhaving been diagnosed with diabetes.\nAmong those who reported having diabetes,\nwho had information regarding all four\nCVD risk factors (blood glucose, blood\npressure, lipids, and current smoking).\nBlood glucose, blood pressure, and lipid\ninformation are available only for those\nNHANES respondents who participated\nin the medical examination portion of the\nsurvey, which included a blood draw.\nSmoking information was obtained from\nthe interview.\ncluding respondents with missing sociode-\nmographic characteristics used in the\nanalysis, our final analysis samples included\nracial/ethnic comparisons made were\nbetween African Americans versus non-\nLatino whites and Mexican-Americans\nversus non-Latino whites. Latinos from\ncountries of origin other than Mexico are\nincluded in the \"other\" race/ethnicity\ncategory.\nThe age- and sex-adjusted proportion\nof respondents with nonmissing informa-\ntion on control of CVD risk factors de-\ncreased from 93.7% in the NHANES\nobserved characteristics between those in-\ncluded in the sample and those excluded\nfrom the sample because of missing data. In\nals were overrepresented among missing\n2008, those with less than a high-school\neducation were overrepresented among\nmissingcases. Whenwe ran a probitregres-\nsion model with \"missing from sample\" as\nthe dependent variable, we found that in\nsignificant predictor of being missing from\nthe sample was African American race. We\nemphasize, however, that there is no sta-\ntistically significant difference in the esti-\nmated coefficient on African American race\npossible bias resulting from excluding ob-\nservations with incomplete information is\nlikely to be minimal.\nDefinitions and measures\nWe considered an individual to have di-\nagnosed diabetes if he or she answered \"yes\"\nto the interview question, \"Have you ever\nbeen told by a doctor or health professional\nthat you have diabetes or sugar diabetes?\"\nWe did not consider respondents who re-\nported having gestational diabetes to have\ndiagnosed diabetes. When we estimated\nthe prevalence rates of diagnosed diabetes,\nwe used all respondents from the NHANES\nsamples who provided a response to this\nquestion.\nTo define poorcontrolofblood glucose\nand blood pressure, we followed the ADA\n2009 guidelines. We defined poor glycemic\ncontrolusing abinaryindicatorof havingan\n$7%. To define poor blood pres-\nsure control, we used a binary indicator of\nhaving a systolic blood pressure $130\nmmHg or diastolic blood pressure $80\nexamination included three readings of sys-\ntolic and diastolic blood pressure. For this\nsample, we used the average of the second\n2008, three or four blood pressure readings\nwere available for each respondent. Thus,\nfor this sample, we used the average of the\nsecond and third readings when they were\nboth available, and we used the average of\nthe third and fourth measure or the average\nof the second and fourth measure of blood\npressure in 193 case subjects for whom the\nsecond or third measure of blood pressure\nwasmissing and a fourth measure wasavail-\nable. We defined a dichotomous indicator\nof current smoking, which equaled 1 if a\nrespondent reported \"yes\" to the question,\n\"Have you smoked at least 100 cigarettes in\nyour entire life?\" and did not answer \"not at\nall\" to the question, \"Do you now smoke\ncurrent smoker as someone who reported\n\"yes\" to both \"Have you smoked at least 100\ncigarettes during your entire life?\" and \"Do\nyou smoke cigarettes now?\"\nTo measure lipid control, we used the\ntotal cholesterol level, which follows the\nAdultTreatmentPanelIIIguidelines,instead\nof LDL cholesterol, as suggested by the ADA\nin 2009, because of the small sample sizes\nwith available LDL cholesterol information\nin the NHANES (n = 335 in the NHANES\n2008). The small sample sizes resulted from\nthe LDL cholesterol measurement only be-\ning available for those who were assigned a\nNHANES medical examination scheduled\nin the morning. We used a binary indicator\nfor total cholesterol of $200 mg/dL as an\nindicator for poor lipid control.\nAnalyses\nInitially, we examined trends in the prev-\nalence of diagnosed diabetes and the\nsociodemographic characteristics of the di-\nagnosed diabetic populations in the\nDisparities in CVD risk factors in diabetic individuals\nandsex-adjustedaswellasunadjustedprev-\nalence rates of diagnosed diabetes (Table 1).\nStandardization was based on the 2000 U.S.\nCensus population, using sex and age\n(5-year age categories for those aged 20\u00ad\n79 years and a category for those aged\n$80 years). We then examined sample\ncharacteristics of the population with\ndiagnosed diabetes in the NHANES\n(Table 2) and, in Table 3, estimated the\nrates of poor control of CVD risk factors\nracial/ethnic and education groups. In\npercentages were standardized according\nof individuals with diagnosed diabetes,\nusing age-sex groups and their corre-\nsponding weights (12). We compared the\nrates of poor control of CVD risk factors\nWe used logisticmodels estimated with\nsurvey weights to test for racial/ethnic- and\neducation-related disparities in poorly con-\ntrolled risk factors for CVD among individ-\nuals with diagnosed diabetes (Table 4). The\nmodels included controls for race/ethnicity\n(African American, Mexican American,\nother race/ethnicity versus non-Latino\nwhites), age categories (5-year age catego-\nries for those aged 20\u00ad79 years and a cate-\ngory for those aged $80 years), sex (female\nvs. male), marital status (married vs. not\nmarried), years since diagnosis of diabetes\nweight], BMI $30 kg/m2 [obese] vs. BMI\n,25 kg/m2 [normal]), access to routine\ncare (has routine access vs. does not have\nroutine access), health insurance type (pub-\nlic, public and private, or uninsured vs. pri-\nvate only), and indicators for survey year.\nAll analyses in this article were performed\nusingStatasoftware,version11.1(StataCorp,\nCollege Station, TX).\nRESULTS\nTrends in diagnosed diabetes and\ncharacteristics of the population\nwith diagnosed diabetes\nAs others have reported (2,21), the prev-\nalence of diagnosed diabetes has in-\ncreased appreciably over time (Table 1).\nThe age- and sex-standardized preva-\nlence rate of diagnosed diabetes in the\nof diagnosed diabetes shows the same pat-\ntern, increasing from 5.1% in the\nis consistent with previous research (22).\nof diabetes (diagnosed and undiagnosed)\nshown).

In these models, we tried includ-\ning covariates that may have captured\nquality-of-care mechanisms of disparities,\nspecifically whether the respondent had\nseen a diabetes specialist in the past year,\nwhether the respondent usually saw a par-\nticular doctor for diabetes, and whether the\nrespondent checked his or her own blood\nglucose level. These additional variables are\navailable in the latest two waves of the\nNHANES only. After these covariates\nwere included, both racial/ethnic-related\ndisparities and education-related dispari-\nties were not changed appreciably, suggest-\ning that these mechanisms (if they indeed\nwere capturing quality of care) did not ex-\nplain the disparities we observed in recent\nyears. However, we interpreted these find-\nings with caution because the additional\ncovariates included may have captured\nthe severity of disease instead of or in addi-\ntion to quality of care. In that case, there\nmay have been a reverse-causality problem,\nwith poor control of diabetes driving sever-\nity instead of the other way around.\nWe did not find racial/ethnic differ-\nences in blood pressure control among\nindividuals with diagnosed diabetes in\npressure column).

Other racial/ethnic minorities and\nethnicity or education group within same period is statistically significant with P , 0.05.\nDisparities in CVD risk factors in diabetic individuals\nHowever, in the case of glycemic con-\ntrol, improvements over time may have been\ndriven by improvements among more edu-\ncated individuals with diabetes and, to some\nextent, by improvements among non-Latino\nwhites. Rates of poor glycemic control fell by\n20% among those with .12 years of educa-\ncemic control remained stable during this\ntime period among those with less than a\nhigh-school education. Results from our re-\ngression analysis, which includes controls\nfor a number of confounding factors, suggest\nthat African Americans and Mexican Amer-\nicans with diagnosed diabetes in the\nto have poor glycemic control than non-\nLatino whites with diagnosed diabetes.\nindividuals with diabetes who had at least\nsome college education were less likely to\nhave uncontrolled blood pressure than those\nwithout any college education, controlling\nfor other factors. This association existed in\nnot statistically significant. It also is notable\nthat smoking rates among individuals with\ndiagnosed diabetes have not improved over\ntime and remain high in some subgroups; in\nals with diagnosed diabetes without a high-\nschooleducationwerecurrentsmokers.This\nhigh rate of smoking among the least edu-\ncated individuals with diabetes is consistent\nwith other data (27).\nIn summary, our findings show that\nimportant progress has been made in re-\nducing CVD risk factors among individuals\nwith diagnosed diabetes over the past de-\ncade, but this progress, in some cases, has\nbeen uneven across sociodemographic\ngroups. There are several potential reasons\nwhy improvements in glycemic control may\nhave been concentrated among non-Latino\nwhite and more educated populations. First,\nsome groups may have better access than\nother groups to the type of integrated,\ncomprehensive medical care that individ-\nuals with diabetes need in order to suc-\ncessfully manage their illness. Although we\nadjusted for insurance status and access to\nroutine care in our main regression models,\nas well as experimented with models based\non the latest two waves of the NHANES that\nincluded more extensive covariates, there\nstill may exist unmeasured aspects of quality\nand access that are correlated with race/\nethnicity and education. Second, individ-\nuals with diabetes who are more educated\nmay have been better able to obtain and\nunderstand new information related to\ndiabetes treatment compared with individ-\nuals with diabetes who are less educated. In\nNHANES, 44% of individuals with diag-\nnosed diabetes with more than a high-\nschool education reported that their doctor\nrecommended that they maintain an HbA1c\n,7% (the recommended level), whereas\nonly 12% of respondents with less than a\nhigh-school education reported that their\ndoctors recommended this level. There\nalso is evidence that people who are more\neducated adopt medical technologies more\nrapidly than people who are less educated\n(28). Third, culture and language may\nplay a role in diabetes management practi-\nces, and these factors may underlie racial/\nethnic disparities in outcomes (11).\nAlthough the mechanisms through\nwhich sociodemographic characteristics af-\nfect control of CVD risk factors are un-\nclear, our findings underscore the need to\nremediate these emerging racial/ethnic-\nand education-related disparities in this area\nof health care. Moreover, although our find-\nings show marked improvements in the\ncontrol of CVD risk factors among individ-\nuals with diabetes, it also is true that only a\nsmall group (13.6%) of individuals with\n2008 had control of all four CVD risk factors\nwe examined. Continued public health ef-\nforts need to be made to address the large\nmajority of individuals with diagnosed dia-\nbetes with uncontrolled risk factors for CVD.\n"
