The objective of this study was to assess aldo-\nsterone polymorphisms and relationships to plasma aldosterone levels and the development of renal histological lesions\nin kidney transplant patients.\nMaterial and methods: Patients with kidney graft biopsy were divided according to the presence or absence of CIN.\nWe determined aldosterone synthase (AS) -344 T/C and int 2 W/C gene polymorphisms and plasma aldosterone levels.\nHistological, biochemical and clinical variables were measured.\nResults: Calcineurin inhibitor (CI) levels were significantly higher in patients with the int 2 WW genotype than in patients\nwith WC or CC genotypes. There was a greater degree of interstitial fibrosis in patients with int 2 CC genotype. No rela-\ntionship was found between the different polymorphisms and a higher degree and/or frequency of CIN. There was also\nno relationship with plasma aldosterone levels.\nConclusion: The frequency of the different polymorphisms studied was not related to plasma aldosterone levels or the\ndevelopment of CIN; however, the int 2 CC genotype was related to a greater degree of interstitial fibrosis, whereas the\nWW genotype was related to higher CI serum levels.\n",

From a clinical standpoint, nephrotoxicity is\nthe most common as well as the most relevant side effect.1\nIn a recent study, Nankivell and colleagues, showed that\nafter 10 years of CI treatment, 100% of transplanted patients\npresented with nephrotoxicity.2 Chronic nephrotoxicity\ndevelops with long-term CI treatment and is mainly charac-\nterized by arteriolopathy and tubulointerstitial fibrosis.3,4\nCalcineurin inhibitor nephrotoxicity (CIN) is accompanied\nby activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and\nincreased expression of transforming growth factor beta\n(TGF), which may be regulated by aldosterone. In experi-\nmental models of CIN, the blockade of aldosterone\nreceptors has been associated with increased survival of\nexperimental animals.5 Aldosterone may promote develop-\nment of CIN by vasoconstriction and induction of TGF\nexpression.6 The presence of polymorphisms in the aldos-\nterone synthase (AS) gene can influence the activity of\naldosterone.7\u00ad9 Two polymorphic variations of this gene\nAldosterone synthase gene polymorphism\nand renal histopathologic changes in\nkidney transplant patients receiving a\ncalcineurin inhibitor\nPatricia C Ruiz-Palacios1, Francisco E Rodr\u00edguez-Castellanos1,\nEduardo Mancilla-Urrea1, Mar\u00eda Del Carmen \u00c1vila-Casado2,\nM\u00f3nica X Inofuentes-Rivero1, Francisco Rodriguez-Illana1, Jos\u00e9 M\nFragoso3 and Gilberto Vargas-Alarc\u00f3n3\n Keywords\nCalcineurin inhibitor, aldosterone synthase, gene polymorphism, genetic susceptibility, nephrotoxicity\nDepartment of Nephrology, Instituto Nacional de Cardiolog\u00eda Ignacio\nCh\u00e1vez, Mexico\nDepartment of Pathology, Instituto Nacional de Cardiolog\u00eda Ignacio\nCh\u00e1vez, Mexico\nDepartment of Molecular Biology, Instituto Nacional de Cardiolog\u00eda\nIgnacio Ch\u00e1vez, Mexico\nCorresponding author:\nGilberto Vargas-Alarc\u00f3n, Department of Molecular Biology, Instituto\nNacional de Cardiolog\u00eda, Ignacio Ch\u00e1vez, Juan Badiano 1, Mexico City\nEmail: gvargas63@yahoo.com\nOriginal Article\n302 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 15(3)\nhave been studied. The first one corresponds to a single\nnucleotide polymorphism called -344 T/C, which corre-\nsponds to the change of thymine/cytosine at the -344 posi-\ntion, altering the binding site for the steroidogenic factor 1\nof the promoting 5'transcriptional region. It is believed that\nthis change alters the sensitivity of the gene for angiotensin\nII, causing an inappropriately high production of aldoster-\none as related to renin levels.10 The -344T allele has been\nassociated to an increased risk of hypertension.10,11 Another\npolymorphism called int 2 W/C, involves conversion of\nintron 2 of the AS gene, which is partially replaced by the\ncorresponding intron of the CYP11B1 enzyme gene. Its\npresence has been associated with hypertension and a\nhigher aldosterone-renin ratio.7,12 To the best of our knowl-\nedge, there has been no study to analyze the relationship\nbetween polymorphism variations of the SA gene and\ndevelopment of CIN.\nMaterials and methods\nSubjects\nPatients with renal transplantation and kidney graft biopsy\nAll kidney graft biopsies were performed according to pro-\ntocolized Nephrology Department guidelines. The first\ngroup included patients with histological diagnosis of CIN\n(n=24); the second group included patients in whom CIN\n(n=55) was dismissed. Clinical data were documented. The\nethics committee of our institution approved the clinical\nprotocol.\nDNA extraction\nGenomic DNA from whole blood containing ethylenediami-\nnetetraacetic acid (EDTA) was isolated using the standard\nDetermination of the CYP11B2 genotypes\nTwo polymorphisms in the AS gene were studied (-344 C/T\nlocated in the promoter region, and int 2 W/C located in the\npolymorphism was genotyped using 5'exonuclease TaqMan\ngenotyping assays on a 7900HT Fast Real-Time Polymerase\nchain reaction (PCR) system, according to manufacturer's\ninstructions (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA). On\nthe other hand, the Int 2 W/C polymorphism was detected by\nallele-specific PCR as previously reported.10 Reactions\nwere made separately, using primer 1 with reverse primer\nand primer 2 with reverse primer. Used primers were: (primer\n1) 5'-TGGAGAAAAGCCCTACCCTGT-3' and (reverse\nprimer) 5'-AGGAACCTCTGCACGGCC-3'for the wild type\nallele and (primer 2) 5'-CAGAAAATCCCTCCCCCCTA-3'\nand (reverse primer) 5'-AGGAACCTCTGCACGGCC-3'\nfor the variant. PCR conditions were as follows: (a) 94\u00b0C\n(repeated for 30 cycles), and (c) a final 7 min extension at\n72\u00b0C. Amplifications were performed in a Perkin Elmer\nPCR System thermocycler, model 9700 from Applied\nBiosystems. A 1.8% agarose gel with ethidium bromide\nstaining was visualized, using a UV Transilluminator.\nPlasma aldosterone levels\nPlasma aldosterone levels of a peripheral blood sample\nobtained at rest in the supine position were measured and\nanalyzed using a radioimmunoassay method. All patients\nreceived a diet with a daily salt intake of 3\u00ad4 g.\nHistological analysis\nThe kidney biopsy was taken according to the previously\ndescribed standard technique; one to three cylindrical frag-\nments of renal cortex, processed for light microscopy,\nwere studied. Tissues were processed according to stand-\nard techniques and were embedded in paraffin to obtain 3\n\u00b5m sections. Sections for light microscopy were stained\nwith hematoxylin and eosin, periodic acid-Schiff (PAS),\nmethenamine silver, and Masson's trichrome. They were\ncation, in consecutive fields and graded histologically\naccording to the Banff classification. Histopathological\nCIN criteria were presence of hyaline nodules and/or grade\n2 or 3 arteriolopathy.\nStatistical analysis\nResults are stated as mean\u00b1standard deviation (SD) or\nproportions. Comparison of means between two groups\nwas performed using the Student`s t test for independent\nsamples or its nonparametric alternative (U of Mann\nWhitney). Comparison of proportions between groups\nwas performed using the chi-square (2) test. Comparison\nof variables between study groups divided by genotype\nwas performed with one-factor analysis of variance\n(ANOVA), using the Bonferroni test for multiple com-\nparisons of means. Spearman's Rho coefficient was used\nto search for associations. All probabilities were two-\ntailed and the level of significance was set at 0.05. Data\nwere analyzed using the SPSS statistical package, version\nAllele and genotypic frequencies of AS gene polymor-\nphisms were determined by direct counting. Hardy-\nWeinberg equilibrium using the X2 test was assessed in\neach study group. Differences between groups were deter-\nmined by using the Mantel-Haenzel X2 test, which com-\nbines 2\u00d72 contingency tables. When any cell number being\ncompared was less than five, Fisher's exact test was used.\nRelative risk with a confidence interval of 95% was\nassessed as an odds ratio using the Woolf method.\nResults\nWe studied a total of 79 patients who received a kidney\ntransplant and immunosuppressive therapy, including a cal-\ncineurin inhibitor, at the Nephrology Department, National\nInstitute of Cardiology in the period between January 2000\nand December 2009. Patients were divided into two groups:\ngroup A included 55 patients with a renal graft biopsy that\nruled out CIN, and group B included 24 patients with a CIN\ndiagnosis. Biopsies (Figures 1 and 2) with any of the fol-\nlowing histological criteria were considered positive for\nCIN: hyaline nodules and/or arteriolopathy grade 2 or 3. Of\nin group B. Clinical and demographic characteristics are\nshown in Table 1.\nAt the time the biopsy was performed, systolic and dias-\ntolic blood pressures were significantly higher in group B\nthan in group A.\nPost-transplant median follow-up for group A was 16\ncant (NS)).\nDevelopment of post-transplant hypertension was found\nin 71% of patients in group B and in 53% of patients in\ngroup A (p=NS). There was no significant difference\nbetween groups comparing the proportion of cases using\nantihypertensive drugs, including angiotensin-converting\nenzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers.\nMean uric acid serum level for both groups was 7.2\u00b12.1\nmg/dl (range: 3.6\u00ad12.6 mg/dl), being significantly higher in\ngroup B. There was no significant difference in plasma\naldosterone levels or in any of the other biochemical varia-\nbles analyzed. From all patients tested, we were able to\nobtain blood samples to determine the genetic polymor-\nphisms only in 54 patients: 40 in group A and 14 in group B.\nFor the -344 T/C polymorphism, we found four homozy-\ngous TT individuals (28.5%) in group B, compared to 22\n(55%) in group A (p=NS). We found the CC genotype in\ngroupA(p=NS).As to the TC heterozygous genotype, there\nwere seven (50%) cases in group B and nine cases (22.5%)\nin groupA(p=NS). Regarding the int 2 W/C polymorphism,\nwe found seven homozygous WW individuals (50%) in\ngroup B compared to 19 (47.5%) in group A (p=NS). The\nCC genotype was present in one patient in group B (7.1%)\nand six patients in group A (15%) (p=NS). The WC hete-\nrozygous genotype was present in 6 cases in group B\nClinical and biochemical variables were compared\naccording to each genotype and results are shown in Tables 2\nand 3. When comparing the different genotypes of the -344\nT/C polymorphism, we found no significant differences in\nthe analyzed variables. Regarding the int 2 W/C polymor-\nphism, the patients expressing the wild WW homozygous\ngenotype exhibited higher levels of CI at the time of graft\nbiopsy, compared to cases with WC and CC genotypes.\nLikewise, aldosterone plasma levels, according to each\nFigure 1.

In the case of the int 2 W/C poly-\nmorphism, a tendency for higher levels of aldosterone was\nfound in cases with the CC genotype. Plasma aldosterone\nlevels also tended to be higher in cases with the -344 TC\ngenotype. No significant differences were found when\ncomparing the frequency of post-transplant hypertension\naccording to genotypes (Table 4).\nThe presence of the different polymorphisms studied\nwas not significantly related to the frequency and degree of\nCIN, however cases with the int 2 CC genotype showed a\nsignificantly higher degree of interstitial fibrosis compared\nto all other groups (Table 5).\nDiscussion\nThe study's objective was to determine the frequency of\n-344 T/C and int 2 W/C polymorphisms and to assess\nwhether there is any risk associated to the genotype for\ndevelopment of CIN in patients with a kidney transplant.\nNumerous research studies have assessed the relationship\nbetween AS gene polymorphisms and aldosterone syn-\nthesis and secretion in diseases in which this hormone\nhas been implicated.7,10\u00ad12 When assessing aldosterone\nplasma levels in this study, as related to the distribution\nof allelic and genotypic frequency in patients with\nand without CIN, no significant differences were found\nbetween groups. Nevertheless, we showed a tendency\ntoward higher levels of aldosterone with C allele of the\nint 2 W/C polymorphism. Regarding the -344 T/C\npolymorphism, the TC genotype was related to a higher\naldosterone level. However, in both cases, the difference\ndid not reveal statistical significance, maybe due to the\nsmall sample size.\nIn a study with hypertensive subjects, Mulatero and\ncolleagues analyzed the frequency of the -344 T/C poly-\nmorphism and its relationship with aldosterone plasma\nlevels, finding that a stronger expression of the C allele\nwas related to higher levels of this hormone.7 In another\nstudy performed in individuals with high blood pres-\nsure, Lim and colleagues analyzed the aldosterone/renin\nratio and its relationship to AS gene polymorphisms,\ndescribing how the presence of the T allele in the -344\nT/C polymorphism and the C allele in the int 2 W/C pol-\nymorphism was accompanied by a higher aldosterone/\nrenin ratio.14 In contrast, Tamaki and colleagues reported\nthat the C allele in the -344 T/C polymorphism was\nassociated with a higher aldosterone/renin ratio in\nJapanese patients.15\nOn the other hand, Nejatizadeh and colleagues studied\nthe relationship of AS gene polymorphisms, plasmatic\nactivity of renin and serum levels of aldosterone with the\nrisk for developing hypertension.16 They found the T\n(-344 T/C) C (int 2 W/C) was a risk haplotype for the\ndevelopment of hypertension, as well as for increased\nserum aldosterone levels and higher aldosterone/renin\nratios. In this study, no relationship was found between\nhigher levels of aldosterone and development of post-\ntransplant hypertension.\nIt is also important to point out that in our study we\nobserved higher uric acid serum levels in the CIN group.\nRecent studies have considered the role of uric acid in\nendothelial dysfunction; with plasmatic levels of over 6 and\n9 mg/dl, causing cellular aging and death, respectively.\nImplicated mechanisms are activation of local oxidative\nstress and over-regulation of some RAS components.17\nThese effects can be reduced through pharmacological\nblockade of the RAS. Because hyperuricemia is considered\nan independent cardiovascular risk factor, as well as a fac-\ntor implicated in progression of kidney diseases,18 there is a\nneed to perform more studies to assess this aspect, with the\npossibility of considering it as an early marker of vascular\ndamage associated with CI administration.\nWhen assessing renal histological alterations related to\nCI toxicity, we did not find any relationship between the\nfrequencies of different genotypes and a higher degree of\nCIN defined by the presence of hyaline nodules and/or\narteriolopathy. However, when we analyzed the degree of\ninterstitial fibrosis, it was discovered that patients with the\nconversion homozygous genotype (CC) of int 2 W/C\nshowed a greater degree of interstitial fibrosis, compared to\nand 14.3% of the patients with CC genotype presented\ngrade II and grade III interstitial fibrosis. This result\nsuggests that the main pro-fibrotic pathways may be\nTable 4.

However, this association should be made\nwith caution due to the small sample size studied and\nbecause 28.6% of the patients with CC genotype showed no\nfibrosis. Additional studies in a large number of patients\ncould help to define the true role of this marker in intersti-\ntial fibrosis. It also should be mentioned that in cases with\nthe CC genotype of int 2 W/C polymorphism, we observed\na tendency for higher diastolic blood pressure and proteinu-\nria at the time the biopsy was taken, higher levels of\nserum creatinine a year after graft biopsy, a lower glomerular\nfiltration rate at 37 months of follow-up, as well as an\nadverse metabolic profile manifested by a higher body\nmass index and serum glucose (data not shown).\nLikewise, we found that the presence of the CC genotype\nof int 2 W/C polymorphism was related in a non-significant\nmanner with a higher degree of tubular atrophy and arteri-\nolopathy. This suggests that patients with this genetic profile\ncould be at greater risk for accelerated deterioration of renal\nfunction, which should be assessed in future studies.\nRegarding the int 2 W/C polymorphism, the CC genotype\nwas related to a higher degree of interstitial fibrosis and the\nWW genotype was related to higher CI serum levels. The\nfrequency of the specific polymorphisms studied was not\nrelated to plasma aldosterone levels or development of CIN.\nHowever, our data are preliminary due to the study sample\nsize and additional studies in a larger number of individuals\nand in other populations could help define the true role of\nthese polymorphisms as risk factors for developing CIN.\n"
