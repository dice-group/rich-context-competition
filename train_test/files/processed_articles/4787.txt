    "abstract": "Abstract\nPeripheral vision is strongly limited by crowding, the deleterious influence of neighboring stimuli\non target perception. Many quantitative aspects of this phenomenon have been characterized, but\nthe specific nature of the perceptual degradation remains elusive. We utilized a drawing technique\nto probe the phenomenology of peripheral vision, using the Rey\u00adOsterrieth Complex Figure, a\nstandard neuropsychological clinical instrument. The figure was presented at 12 or 6 in the right\nvisual field, with eye tracking to ensure that the figure was only presented when observers\nmaintained stable fixation. Participants were asked to draw the figure with free viewing,\ncapturing its peripheral appearance. A foveal condition was used to measure copying\nperformance in direct view. To assess the drawings, two raters used standard scoring systems\nthat evaluated feature positions, spatial distortions, and omission errors. Feature scores tended to\ndecrease with increasing eccentricity, both within and between conditions, reflecting reduced\nresolution and increased crowding in peripheral vision. Based on evaluation of the drawings, we\nalso identified new error classes unique to peripheral presentation, including number errors for\nadjacent similar features and distinctive spatial distortions. The multifaceted nature of the Rey\u00ad\nOsterrieth Complex Figure--containing configural elements, detached compound features, and\ntexture-like components--coupled with the flexibility of the free-response drawing paradigm and\nthe availability of standardized scoring systems, provides a promising method to probe peripheral\nperception and crowding.\nCorresponding author:\nDaniel R.

Furthermore, tasks such as identifying the spatial location of objects\n(Michel & Geisler, 2011) as well as tasks involving relative spatial localization (Levi, Klein, &\nYap, 1987; Westheimer, 1982) are measurably worse in the visual periphery. Finally, in the\nlast several decades, interest has coalesced around the phenomenon of ``crowding,'' which is\nthe difficulty identifying objects when they are surrounded by other objects, an effect most\npronounced for stimuli located in the periphery (for reviews, see Herzog, Sayim, Chicherov,\n2011). Many studies have measured quantitative aspects of the performance deterioration\ndue to crowding, such as the size and shape of the region within which flankers impair\nperformance, called the crowding zone (Bouma, 1970; Toet & Levi, 1992). It has been\nshown that this zone is elliptical, extending radially toward the fovea, and grows\napproximately linearly with increasing eccentricity (Toet & Levi, 1992). Some studies have\nexamined what basic stimulus factors modulate the magnitude of crowding or the size of the\ncrowding zone, such as display duration (Chung & Mansfield, 2009; Tripathy & Cavanagh,\n2002), the spatial complexity of the stimulus (Bernard & Chung 2011), target size (Pelli,\nCavanagh, 2002), or stimulus contrast (Chung, Levi, & Legge, 2001; Coates, Chin, &\nrelationships between target and flanker characteristics, such as the effects of target-flanker\nsimilarity (Bernard & Chung 2011; Chung & Mansfield, 2009; Kooi, Toet, Tripathy, & Levi,\n1994; Sayim, Westheimer, & Herzog, 2008). Finally, the overall configuration of the target\nand flankers, including how much the target and the flankers group with each other, plays a\nkey role in crowding (Banks & White, 1984; Livne & Sagi, 2007; Malania, Herzog, &\nTypically, these aspects of crowding have been studied using forced-choice methods, which\nhave dominated vision science research, especially since the formalization of signal detection\ntheory (Green & Swets, 1966). Specifically, in order to control for response bias factors,\nexperimental subjects are forced to choose from a set of possible responses for a trial, such\nas ``signal absent'' or ``signal present,'' the orientation of a tilted element, or one of the letters\nof the alphabet. In addition, experiments typically utilize stimuli such as simple shapes,\nRoman letters, oriented gratings, or Gabor patches (Levi, 2008). With the combination of\nforced-choice techniques and impoverished stimuli, important aspects of phenomenological\nexperience are lost. For example, subjects attempting to identify a crowded letter may\nperceive a visual form that does not match any of the set of possibilities. Similarly,\ngratings may assume a warped or distorted appearance, a quality that has been observed\nfor very high-frequency (aliased) gratings at the fovea (Williams, 1985) or in amblyopic vision\n2 i-Perception\n(Barrett, Pacey, Bradley, Thibos, & Morrill, 2003; Hess, Campbell, & Greenhalgh, 1978).\nCrowded stimuli have been described as ``jumbles'' of their constituent features (Pelli et al.,\n2004), with subjects reporting that features seem indeterminately located among the multiple\nThe important (but often overlooked) treatise by Korte (1923) is an early study of the\nphenomenological aspects of word perception in the periphery (summarized in Strasburger,\n2014 and Strasburger et al., 2011). In his experiments, Korte carefully noted the impressions\nof subjects reporting the appearance of indirectly presented words. He enumerated a variety\nof errors that occurred using qualitative descriptions, such as incorrect absorption of features\ninto adjacent letters or the ``buzzing around'' of small spatial features that could not be stably\nlocalized.\nRecent work from our group using crowded peripheral letter-like shapes introduced\nseveral error categories observed in crowded displays (Sayim & Wagemans, 2013). In that\nstudy, we asked subjects to draw simple letter-like stimuli viewed peripherally, in order to\nexamine the effects of crowding on the perception of shapes comprising several line segments.\nUsing these simplified stimuli and a free-response paradigm yielded meaningful parametric\nstimulus dimensions and permitted the quantification of explicit error types, such as the\ndiminishment of target features.\nObserver drawings have been used to illustrate effects such as the grating distortions\ndemonstrations of crowded percepts (Pelli & Tillman, 2008), but few researchers have\nquantitatively evaluated drawings themselves. Johnson and Uhlarik (1974) asked subjects\nto draw geometric shapes such as squares and triangles presented briefly in the fovea, and\nevaluated the presence or absence of edges in the drawings to probe the microgenesis of visual\nperception. We have analyzed drawings of crowded letters and letter-like shape (Sayim &\nWagemans, 2013) and used a drawing method to investigate the effects of prior knowledge on\ncrowded color appearance in the periphery (Sayim, Myin, & Van Uytven, 2015).\nIn clinical neuropsychology, on the other hand, drawing tasks are heavily used, for a\nvariety of reasons. Subjective experience is of primary interest, as patients may have\ncompletely unexpected interpretations of their visual input. Many drawing tests are\nstraightforward, typically requiring the copying of a geometric shape, and easy to\nadminister, requiring only score sheets and pens. Standardization and scoring is the\nprimary challenge that has faced clinical researchers. A variety of drawing tasks have been\nintroduced, including the Rey\u00adOsterrieth Complex Figure (ROCF; Osterrieth, 1944; Rey\n1941) and the Taylor Complex Figure (Taylor, 1969). Here, we focus on the ROCF, which\nis the most widely used drawing figure in neuropsychological practice (for a recent review, see\nShin, Park, Park, Seol, & Kwon, 2006). Evaluation of drawings of this figure have been\nshown to reveal deficits in visual-spatial processing and visual working memory (Shin\net al., 2006), including particular types of spatial errors that are sensitive to hemispheric\nlateralization of lesions (Loring, Lee, & Meador, 1988). In addition, the organizational\nstrategies used to draw these figures can reveal subtle aspects of development maturity in\nchildren (Waber & Holmes, 1985, 1986), including a shift in preference from local features to\nglobal aspects of the figure.\nMany of these same issues in visual-spatial processing (such as spatial mislocalization\nerrors, local vs. global distortions, different types of integration problems, etc.) are also\ngermane to the study of peripheral vision. To understand the nature and limits of\nperipheral vision requires more than the measurement of performance in identification\ntasks. In particular, it is important to understand the characteristics, for example, the\ntypes of distortions exhibited in the perception of complex spatial forms viewed\nCoates et al. 3\nperipherally. Several results using traditional stimuli and forced-choice methods have\nrevealed clues that target appearance is modulated by flankers in crowded conditions.\nFor example, one study (Greenwood, Bex, & Dakin, 2010) used noise\n``targets''--themselves lacking distinctive features--flanked by oriented Gabors, showing\nassimilation of the flanker orientation and tilt aftereffects from adaptation. These authors\nconcluded that the flankers biased target appearance as a general-purpose mechanism in the\nperiphery that regularizes adjacent spatial forms. Similarly, Sayim and Cavanagh (2013), using\nrotated letter targets and flankers, showed that flankers perceptually bias target appearance by\nshape-specific assimilation, in a dissociable fashion for crowding and grouping. How to\nextrapolate these results to more complex multidimensional targets is unclear, since the\nstructure of such stimuli may resist decomposition based on averaging or assimilation.\nPeripheral vision has sometimes been described as statistical summarization in terms of\ninterpretation is likely relevant for many aspects of visual perception, such as natural\nscenes, but not necessarily for all stimuli, such as alphabetic text or well-defined objects\nand shapes. We are interested in the perception of both ``textures'' and ``objects,'' or\nequivalently ``stuff'' and ``things'' (Adelson & Bergen, 1991).\nTherefore, we used the rich, multipart ROCF to study peripheral perception directly by\nasking subjects to portray what they saw, using drawing. While line drawings are generally\nsuited to depict a large range of visual features (Sayim & Cavanagh 2011), the ROCF has the\nparticular advantage of containing both object-like and texture-like components. It\ncomprises a variety of elements in nontrivial configurations, unlike stimuli that are simple\nfigures like Gabors, gratings, or simple geometric figures. In contrast to studies with simple\nstimuli, the phenomenon known as ``internal crowding'' can be revealed. Internal crowding,\nor ``within-object'' crowding, refers to the effect whereby the parts of a complex object crowd\neach other, an effect that has been observed with cartoon faces (Martelli, Majaj, & Pelli,\n2005) and Chinese characters (Zhang, Zhang, Xue, Liu, & Yu, 2009). Complicated multipart\nobjects, such as the ROCF, are essential to show this effect, rather than simple letter-like\nstimuli with few edges. While the deleterious effects of within-object crowding is clear (as\nshown by the previous studies), more detailed understanding of what ``happens'' to the parts,\nsuch as whether they can be duplicated, or whether the overall form loses all organization,\nremains lacking.\nAs far as we know, this is the first time this clinical instrument has been used to\nsystematically study the spatial distortions of form perception in the periphery of normal\nsubjects. Although our intent is not to make a link between peripheral vision and cognitive\nimpairment, our goals are surprisingly similar to clinical researchers. Specifically, we seek to\nfind specific patterns of errors that reveal differences in visual perception between\nconditions--in our case location in the visual field. However, whereas the primary purpose\nof clinical instruments is to provide differential diagnoses, our focus is on investigating the\nspatial distortions themselves, in order to better understand the underlying mechanisms of\nperipheral vision.\nClinical researchers have developed specialized scoring schemes based on the careful\nexamination of the types of errors made by different subject groups. For example, Rey\n(1941) and Osterrieth (1944) were interested in the coarse dichotomy between spatial\ndetails and structural components, and recommended attention to organizational qualities\nof reproduction (such as the drawing order) rather than specific item errors. The Boston\nQualitative Scoring System (BQSS; Stern et al., 1994) made the component hierarchies more\nexplicit and added qualitative measures such as ``fragmentation'' and ``planning.'' On the\nother hand, Loring et al. (1988) developed novel classifications of specific types of spatial\n4 i-Perception\ndistortions (such as mislocations of particular elements of the ROCF, or additions of certain\nlines) that could discriminate between left and right epilepsy patients. Waber and Holmes\n(1985) studied the drawings of children using sophisticated evaluation metrics and statistical\nmethods, determining sets of spatial features that created meaningful developmental\nclassifications in concordance with subjective evaluations. In this spirit, we also propose\nnew error types based on observations culled from the peripheral drawings.\nMethods\nObservers\nEight observers participated in the experiment. Observers were art students recruited from an\nart school and were naive to the purpose of the experiment. Art students were used since they\nwould presumably be more able to accurately render their percepts due to drawing\nproficiency. All observers reported normal or corrected-to-normal visual acuity. The\nexperiments were carried out according to ethical standards specified in the Declaration of\nHelsinki and were approved by the Ethics Committee of KU Leuven. Participants gave\ninformed consent prior to beginning the experiment.\nApparatus\nStimuli were presented on a Sony Trinitron GDM-F520 CRT monitor with a resolution of\nwith their heads supported by a chinrest and headrest. Eye movements were monitored using\nan EyeLink 1000 eye tracker (SR Research Ltd., Mississauga, Ontario) at a 1000 Hz sampling\nrate. In front of the chinrest, there was an elevated drawing board, with the drawing booklet\nset on top. Subjects were able to move their gaze between the screen and the drawing booklet\nwithout head movements, and drew in the booklet using an electronic pen. The use of an\nelectronic pen allowed immediate visual feedback of drawings, unlike traditional drawing\ntablets. The experimental setup is shown in Figure 1. The experiment was programmed in\nMATLAB (Mathworks, Natick Massachusetts, USA) using the Psychophysics toolbox\nStimulus\nThe stimulus presented to the subjects was an 823 \u00c2 615 pixel bitmap of the ROCF\nsubtending 9 by 7 (see Figure 2). Subjects were allowed to move their gaze between the\nscreen and drawing booklet as often as they wanted. The stimulus was only presented when\nobservers fixated the central fixation dot. First, subjects were shown the stimulus centered at\n12 in the right visual field and were instructed to draw as accurately as possible how the\nstimulus appeared, that is, how it looked. After finishing the first drawing, subjects were\nshown the stimulus centered at 6 in the right visual field and created a new drawing based on\nthis presentation. Finally, subjects were allowed to freely view the figure with their foveal\nvision, constituting a normal copy task. Subjects S2 and S7 did not perform the foveal\ncondition and are omitted from the respective analyses. The order of eccentricities was\nused for all subjects in order to keep them as naive as possible about the presented figure.\nThe drawings were scored using two different scoring metrics by two independent\nexperienced raters, naive to the purpose of the experiment. The scorers evaluated each\ndrawing based on the original Osterrieth scoring system (Osterrieth, 1944) and the BQSS\nCoates et al. 5\nFigure 2. The Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure.\nFigure 1. Experimental setup, showing (from left to right) the CRT monitor, eye tracking camera, drawing\nboard, booklet, drawing pen, and head/chin rest.\n6 i-Perception\nScoring Measures\nSpatial elements: Osterrieth scoring. The original Osterrieth scoring system divides the figure into\n18 spatial elements, as shown in Figure 3. Each element is given a score of 0, 1/2, 1, or 2. A\nscore of 2 indicates correct reproduction and placement. A score of 1 indicates either of two\npossibilities: correct reproduction, but improper placement; or a distorted reproduction\nplaced correctly. A score of 1/2 indicates items that are recognizable but possess both\ndistorted appearance and improper placement. Zeros indicate items that are completely\nabsent.\nSpecific guidelines exist for scoring each item (Osterrieth, 1944; Taylor, 1969; summarized\nby Duley et al., 1993). For example, for the circle with the three dots, there are prescribed\npenalties for ``resembling a face,'' and ``incorrect placement of dots.'' For the five parallel\nslanted lines, there are penalties for not crossing the large diagonal, being too long or too\nshort, and so forth.\nBoston Qualitative Scoring System. Each drawing was also evaluated using the BQSS. In this\nsystem, the drawing is divided into three categories of spatial elements: configural elements,\nclusters, and details (see Figure 3). Each of these categories is scored in aggregate, including\nevaluations of presence of the constituent elements, accuracy, and correct placement, all on a\n1 to 5 scale. Global characteristics of the drawings, such as ``neatness'' and ``fragmentation''\nare also scored.\nFigure 3. Osterrieth and Boston scoring systems. For the Osterrieth system (upper left), each numbered\nspatial element is given a score as described in the text. The Boston system (remaining three panels) is\ncomposed of three types of feature categories. For each of the 3 categories, scores from constituent\nelements are aggregated and counted based on accuracy and placement.\nCoates et al. 7\nStatistical Analyses\nThe primary methods we used to perform post hoc statistical testing comprised parametric\nand nonparametric Monte Carlo methods. Specifically, observed data were resampled (with\nreplacement), generating new data for use in computing p-values and confidence intervals.\nThese analyses were performed in IPython with the Numpy/Scipy libraries (Oliphant, 2007;\nPe\nResults\nA summary of the total scores for each of the two major scoring systems is given in Tables 1\nand 2, respectively. Individual participant data are plotted in the two panels of Figure 4. As\nTable 1.

Right-most columns shows mean and standard deviation across subjects.\n8 i-Perception\nthey were allowed to use their fovea to view the figure. Total scores declined in the periphery.\nThe correlation coefficient between the two raters for the summed scores was 0.97 for the\nOsterrieth system and 0.94 for the Boston system.\nThe distributions of the individual element scores for each of the three eccentricities are\nshown in Figure 5. Most elements at the fovea are scored perfectly (2 for Osterrieth and 5 for\nBQSS), with a shift in the entire distribution to lower scores as the figure is placed further in\nthe periphery. The non-Gaussian shapes of these distributions are an additional motivation\nfor the use of Monte Carlo methods for determining confidence intervals.\nAs shown by Figure 4, the data separate fairly well based on their total scores. For each\nscoring system, a simple classifier can be constructed that thresholds the total score and\nestimates the eccentricity. For the Osterrieth scoring system, scores below 16 are estimated\nto result from 12, scores above 34 are estimated to be from the fovea, and anything in\nbetween is assumed to be from 6. This classifier is 95% accurate. It misclassifies S8's 12\nscore as a 6 score and S2's 6 score as a 12 score. A classifier based on the BQSS scores is\nsimilarly effective, with thresholds of <55 (for 12) and >75 (fovea). Only the scores of S8 are\noutside the range--these scores are significantly higher than those of the other subjects.\nFigure 6 illustrates the classification boundaries by replotting the data from Figure 4.\nQuantifiable differences in the drawings reflect the influence of presentation eccentricity on\ndrawing. Next, spatial features from the Osterrieth scoring scheme are analyzed. Table 3 lists\nthe average score for each feature across observers at all three retinal locations, averaged\nacross the two raters. Figure 7 illustrates these data by showing the average score across\nobservers and raters for each spatial feature. Table 4 lists the scores from the Boston system\nat each of the three eccentricities.\nTo determine which scores differed significantly from other scores at each of the two\nperipheral eccentricities, we performed Monte Carlo simulations of the data. Simulated\nfeature scores were drawn with replacement from the observed per-rater scores at each\neccentricity. Most of the feature occurrence rates did not differ from the mean. However,\nsome features did have a frequency that was outside the 95% confidence intervals determined\nby the Monte Carlo procedure. Table 5 summarizes the results of this analysis, showing only\nthose features that were present in the drawings with a statistically different frequency (i.e.,\nhigher or lower than the 95% confidence intervals for that eccentricity).\nFigure 5. Distribution of scores at each eccentricity for each of the two rating systems. Dots represent the\nproportion of all scores for an eccentricity that possess the given rating, across both raters and all feature\ntypes.\nCoates et al. 9\nFor the Osterrieth features (see Figure 3), identification of the small line directly above the\nleft-side square (Feature #7) differed from the other features, at both 6 and 12. At 6, the\nsmall vertical line in the top-right corner (#10) and the larger interior vertical line on the right\n(#15) are also significantly omitted. At 6, the left-side cross (#1) and the left-bottom square\n(#18) are identified more correctly than other features.\nFigure 6. Data of Figure 4, re-ordered by eccentricity to better show classification boundaries. Each dot\nrepresents the total score (averaged across raters) for a subject at a given eccentricity.\nTable 3. Osterrieth Feature Scores Averaged Across Raters.\nNote. Numbers indicate average and standard deviation across observers for each eccentricity. See\nFigure 3 for feature key.\nFor the Boston scores, ``detail presence'' is the only score which differs significantly at 6.\nAt 12, this score, as well as ``cluster accuracy'' is significantly outside the 95% confidence\nintervals. Several features are significantly greater than the other scores at 12. Those are\nvertical and horizontal expansion, rotation, and perseveration (inappropriate repetitions).\nThese error types did not occur as often as the other errors.\nPrevious qualitative scoring systems were based on careful characterization of error types\nfrom different subject populations. For example, Loring et al. (1988) identified particular\ntypes of spatial errors (e.g., ``misplacement of upper left cross'') that were diagnostic of the\nFigure 7.

Motivated by this approach, we\nidentified new types of errors observed in the peripheral drawings. Table 6 lists the error\ntypes and indicates which subjects exhibited the errors at each eccentricity. None of these\nerrors occurred in foveal drawings. The errors fall into two broad categories: depiction of an\ninaccurate number of adjacent similar items (number errors) and specific spatial\ndeformations (distortion errors).\nFigure 8 reproduces all subjects' drawings from the two peripheral locations. Note that\ndrawings are not shown in equal scale. For display purposes, each drawing was digitally\nscaled to yield similar sizes.\nDiscussion\nAs far back as Ptolemy and Alhazen, it has been noted that peripheral vision lacks the clarity\nof foveal vision (Strasburger & Wade, 2015). Since then, researchers have sought to more\nfully characterize the nature of the deficiencies in peripheral perception. Experiments with\ntraditional psychophysical methods have yielded important findings about the effects of\nspatial undersampling, the loss of phase information, or the deleterious effect of\nneighboring contours on identification of a target (for a review of pattern vision in the\nperiphery, see Strasburger et al., 2011).\nIncreasingly, however, researchers are interested in determining more fully the\nphenomenological nature of peripheral distortions. What do objects actually ``look like'' in\nthe periphery? For example, the common intuition is that peripheral objects should appear\nblurrier than foveal objects, due to the declining sampling resolution in the periphery.\nTable 5. For Each Scoring System and Eccentricity, the Features That Are Listed Are Those With a\nProportion That Differs Statistically From the Population Mean.\nFeature type Eccentricity Smaller than CI Larger than CI\nBQSS 6 #6 (detail presence)\nNote.

The first two\nrows indicate Osterrieth features (see Figure 3), and the last two rows indicate BQSS features (see text).\nTable 6.

Subjects exhibiting the error at each eccentricity are indicated.\nParadoxically, the opposite is true: In matching experiments, subjects perceive peripheral\nobjects to be sharper than corresponding foveal objects (Galvin, O'Shea, Squire, & Govan,\n1997). Hence, alternate characterizations of peripheral appearance, such as localized spatial\ndisorder (Koenderink & van Doorn, 2000), are needed. Furthermore, composite nonfoveal\nobjects like words are ambiguous in very specific ways related to mislocalization of features\nand symbols, as described by Korte (1923) and further clarified by Strasburger (2014). Even\nbefore Korte's (1923) treatise, scientists such as James Jurin and Alhazen were aware of this\nindistinct mode of vision that hinders recognition of compound objects. However, the\ncategorical difference in phenomenology between indistinct vision and the straightforward\nloss of resolution (as apparent even with simple objects) has not always been appreciated\nAn understanding of the phenomenology of peripheral vision is crucial, particularly for\nbuilding models designed to capture the so-called metamers of spatial vision (Koenderink &\nFigure 8. The top two rows reproduce the drawings made when subjects viewed the figure at 6, and\nbottom two rows are from 12 presentations. Drawings were spatially scaled for presentation consistency.\nvan Doorn 1996). Impoverished stimuli and limitations of forced-choice methods may mask\nthe shortcomings of models of peripheral vision. For example, a recent study demonstrated\nthat highly sensitive psychophysical methods are necessary to evaluate the peripheral\ninformation available to observers (Wallis, Bethge, & Wichmann, 2016). Specfically, these\nauthors found that subjects could make better discriminations than those predicted by\ntexture-based models of crowding (Balas et al., 2009; Freeman & Simoncelli, 2011). Here,\nwe chose to use the method of drawing to directly capture the visual distortions in peripheral\npercepts. For task standardization, we used a mature method from neuropsychology that has\nbeen employed for over 50 years.\nUsing the Rey\u00adOsterrieth drawing task and standard scoring methods, we showed how\naccurate reproduction of spatial features predictably declined as the target was presented\nfurther in the visual periphery. Furthermore, the more foveal elements of each drawing, such\nas the left-most cross (Feature #1), were often more accurately depicted in the drawings.\nHowever, eccentricity was not the only factor involved. Specifically, in agreement with\ncrowding explanations, the proximity and similarity of an element to nearby features also\nhad an impact on difficulty. For example, the detection rate of Feature #7 was relatively low,\npresumably because it is very close to the upper line of Item #6, which is similar in length and\nof the same orientation as Feature #7. Korte (1923) noted that features which were not\nintegrated into an overall form were more likely to elicit ambiguous percepts. This would\nbe the case for Feaures #7, #10, and #15 of the ROCF, which were often excluded by our\nsubjects. On the other hand, features on the exterior of the figure, such as the cross mentioned\nearlier (Feature #1), or Feature #14, which hangs off of the right side of the figure, are flanked\nwith fewer elements than interior features, and are identified more accurately. To precisely\ndecouple the role of eccentricity, crowding and grouping in the ROCF would require\nadditional experiments, such as showing a mirror-image of the figure.\nThe outline of the shape was often identified correctly, although interestingly the upper-\nright corner often assumed a curved shape. Most drawings retained overall configural\nstructure (the outline rectangle and its diagonal elements) at 6. At 12, only some of the\ndrawings retained the configural structure. Interestingly, Feature #15 (the medium-sized\nvertical line in the right-hand of the figure) was identified poorly at 6 but more accurately\nat 12. Looking at the drawings, there is an intuitive explanation. At 6, the outline rectangle\nwas identified relatively accurately, but this vertical line was often missed. At 12, the outline\nrectangle was typically distorted or absent, but there was some vertical line feature for most\nsubjects. This vertical line was generally scored as Feature #15.\nObservations from several other components of the figure strengthen the proposal that it is\ndifficult to individuate items in structured repeating patterns (Intriligator & Cavanagh, 2001).\nFor example, the sets of parallel lines were recognizable in the drawings, but typically\nundercounted. This is in contrast to most previous observations with the figure in\nneuropsychological settings, which have observed additional parallel lines, especially with\ndamage to the right-temporal lobe (Loring et al., 1988). This reduction in featural elements\nagrees well with our recent account of crowding (Sayim & Wagemans, 2013; see also Liu &\nArditi, 2000). Another example is the circle and its constituent dots. The overall pattern was\noften depicted, but the particular number of dots and their spatial relationships were often lost.\nClearly, there was great individual variability in the drawings, from being quite sparse and\nunusual at 12 (Subjects S1, S4, S5, and S6) to being nearly perfect at both eccentric locations\n(Subject S8). It has previously been noted that subjects may have very different crowding\nzone extents (Pelli et al., 2007) and can exhibit other idiosyncratic individual differences in the\nstrength of crowding effects, such as the ``inner/outer'' anisotropy due to the flanker position\nrelative to the target and the fovea (Petrov & Meleshkevich, 2011). Furthermore, when the\nvisual input is highly ambiguous, which is often the case for peripheral objects, factors such\nas imagination may affect visual perception more than for direct vision. Some subjects\nreported that the figure looked like a ``face'' or a ``fish,'' which could have influenced\nperception by ``filling-in'' missing details. The extent to which low-level perception may be\naffected by cognition is an active and controversial topic (Firestone & Scholl, 2015; Pylyshyn,\n1999). It has also been proposed that the processes involved in depiction utilize schemata\ninfluenced by culture, training, and experience (Gombrich, 2000). At minimum, previous\nexposure to this particular figure may have enhanced the reproduction for some subjects.\nSince drawing is a learned proficiency, we opted to use student artists for this study. This\npopulation should be more able to accurately depict their percepts, counteracting the sources\nof noise inherent in the procedure such as motor ability or visual memory limitations. On the\nother hand, the visual perception of artists may differ from that of average observers. For\nexample, it has been observed that skilled artists may differ in aspects of visual cognition\nbut see Perdreau & Cavanagh, 2013b). Chamberlain, McManus, Brunswick, Rankin, and\nRiley (2015) found that in a large population of student artists greater drawing ability was\ncorrelated with higher ROCF copy scores, and Gallagher and Burke (2007) found differences\nin raw ROCF scores based on factors such as IQ and gender. Future studies with a more\ngeneral population would be required to investigate the generality of our observations, albeit\nwith the cost of reduced overall drawing skills.\nInterestingly, our foveal results (averaging 35.1 out of 36 on the Osterrieth rating) seem\nbetter than those found in a recent large study that also used artists as observers\n(Chamberlain et al., 2015), which had an average Osterrieth rating of 31.88. There are\nseveral possible reasons for the difference. While it could be that our sample of artists was\nbiased toward more skilled artists, we suggest that the difference in time allotment underlies\nthis finding. In Chamberlain et al. (2015), observers were only given 4 min to copy the figure,\nwhereas we allowed unlimited time.\nA further methodological aspect of our experiment differs from typical crowding studies. In\nthis experiment, viewing time was unlimited and subjects were permitted to view the stimuli as\nmany times as necessary by allowing unrestricted gaze shifts between the drawing book and\nthe monitor. In most crowding experiments, display duration is brief (usually 100\u00ad200 ms),\nostensibly to avoid undesired eye movements to the peripheral target. Stimulus duration has a\nmeasurable effect on the magnitude and extent of crowding (Chung & Mansfield, 2009;\nTripathy & Cavanagh, 2002; Tripathy, Cavanagh, & Bedell, 2014), though there are few\nstudies testing unlimited duration with gaze-contingent displays (i.e., Wallace, Chiu,\nNandy, & Tjan, 2013). Importantly, the stability and persistence of crowded percepts has\nnot been previously characterized, a topic that warrants future direct study.\nFinally, besides a better theoretical understanding of how peripheral visual perception\ndiffers from foveal perception, there is a translational aspect to this study as well. Age-\nrelated macular degeneration is a condition whereby the fovea becomes unusable due to\ndisease, is a leading cause of visual impairment (Congdon, 2004; de Jong, 2006), and is\ngrowing in prevalence amongst older adults (Congdon, 2004). Since peripheral viewing is\nmandatory for subjects with a disorder such as this, visual crowding is a limiting factor\n(Chung, 2014). Proper application of the ROCF test in such a patient group requires an\nunderstanding of how perception of the ROCF changes in the periphery. For example, the\nROCF has been shown to be sensitive to the laterality of stroke (Binder, 1982; Lange,\nWaked, Kirshblum, & DeLuca, 2000). For a stroke patient with age-related macular\ndegeneration, ROCF results may differ from the normative population due to visual\nfactors rather than neurocognitive factors.\nWhile the difficulties processing complicated forms in the periphery have been studied by\nresearchers for nearly a century, it is only recently that the specific characteristics of the form\nand shape degradations are becoming understood. We believe that more diverse stimuli are\ncrucial to pursue this goal, and the use of the ROCF opens up promising new avenues\nto explore this question. The task of drawing presents a way for subjects to give a precise\naccount of their peripheral percepts, providing a rich amount of information complementing\nforced-choice methods.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or\npublication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or\npublication of this article: Daniel Coates was supported by a postdoctoral fellowship from the Belgian\nAmerican Educational Foundation.
