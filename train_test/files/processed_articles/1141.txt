    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis paper uses qualitative and quantitative data from married men and women in rural\nMalawi to examine how they comprehend their risk to HIV/AIDS and what preventive\nstrategies they consider within marriage. Program efforts to promote behavior change have\nconsistently focused on promoting chastity before marriage and fidelity while married or\nusing condoms. These behavioral prescriptions are suitable for extramarital contexts but\nnot within marriage, where the condom is far from being accepted as a suitable preventive\ntool and spouses face the reality that one's vulnerability to AIDS is not confined to his/her\nbehavior alone. The survey data show, unsurprisingly, that those who have the most reason\nfor concern (e.g. those worried about contracting the disease) and those who have greater\nprogram and informal social contacts are most likely to communicate. The semi-structured\ninterviews show that husbands and wives use subtle and gendered strategies to encourage\nfidelity; they talk to each other about the consequences of HIV/AIDS on their children's\nand their own lives as a prelude for highlighting and justifying joint sexual prudence. These\nresults show that rather than giving up to fate, marital partners are actively challenging and\npersuading each other to reform sexual behavior to avoid the intrusion of HIV/AIDS into\nthe home.\n1 African Population and Health Research Center.

Once the epidemic\nwent beyond such core groups to become generalized, many new infections are likely to\ntake place through ordinary conjugal relations. Yet even today in countries with high\nprevalence of HIV, married couples are rarely the primary targets of HIV prevention\nprograms. Most preventive strategies emphasize abstaining from sex or using condoms,\nstrategies that are appropriate for individuals to avoid infection outside marriage but are not\nperceived by couples to be appropriate within marriage. How, then, do married couples\nattempt to protect themselves from infection by their spouse? One potential strategy is to\ninitiate a discussion of the threat of AIDS in order to persuade the spouse to be faithful.\nThis may be difficult: a number of studies have documented the difficulties that both men\nand women perceive in raising the topics of infidelity and of condom use within marriage\nspousal communication may be an effective means of protection from HIV/AIDS among\nmarried people.\nMuch more research has been done on the relationship between spousal\ncommunication and use of family planning than sexual behavior relating to HIV/AIDS.\nStudies on spousal communication and family planning typically show a strong positive\ncorrelation between spousal communication and contraceptive use: women who report\nusing family planning are more likely to report that they have discussed family planning\nstudy using longitudinal data from Northern Ghana demonstrates that spousal\ncommunication predicts contraceptive use (Bawah 2002). Given that spousal\ncommunication is so key for adoption of contraception, there is need to understand not only\nthe effect of communication on contraceptive use in various contexts, but also the largely\nignored impact of various factors on spousal communication on such reproductive health\nissues. This is important particularly for IEC programs that may need to encourage spousal\ncommunication for adoption of positive reproductive health innovations.\nThe positive relationship between spousal communication and contraceptive use\nsuggests the potential importance of spousal communication in AIDS prevention. A few\nstudies have examined and shown a positive relationship between partner communication\nand adoption of condoms among adolescents as well as adults (see, for example, Shoop and\n2000). Survey data from Uganda show that men who have discussed HIV prevention with\ntheir wives are more likely to have used condoms at last sexual intercourse, although the\nimpact of spousal communication about AIDS diminishes significantly among those who\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 8\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 249\nalso discussed use of family planning with their wives (Gage and Ali 2003). Although\nspousal communication is positively associated with having an HIV-test, the Uganda data\ndo not conclusively show a significant positive relationship between spousal talk and\ncondom use as well as fidelity. So, while further work is needed to establish whether there\nis actually a causal linkage between spousal communication and adoption of preventive\nsexual behaviors, these studies are suggestive that spousal communication can indeed\npromote adoption of protective sexual behaviors.\nRather than focus on the relationship between spousal communication and\nreproductive behavior (as done by most studies on family planning), this study uses\nquantitative data to examine factors that facilitate husband-wife communication about the\nrisk of contracting HIV/AIDS. Additionally, the study goes beyond the survey data and\nquantitative analysis that many past studies on spousal communication have utilized (for\nan exception, see Blanc et al. 1996) to analyze what husbands and wives actually say to\neach other when they talk about their risk of contracting HIV/AIDS. The quantitative\nfindings on factors that influence whether or not a conversation about AIDS occurred are\ncompared with qualitative reports of contexts under which spousal conversations take\nplace. The content of conversations between husbands and wives is valuable in clarifying\nhow couples in rural Malawi comprehend and express their fears and risk to HIV/AIDS and\nwhat strategies they are exploring to prevent the intrusion of AIDS into the home.\nIt should also be noted that husbands and wives might use non-verbal forms of\nspouse perceives a need but the other does not, the topic may not be broached because the\nother spouse is believed \u00ad perhaps correctly - to oppose the issue being considered.\nHusbands and wives may also avoid direct verbal communication if one or both of them\nperceive that the topic of HIV prevention is so sensitive that to broach it would threaten the\ntranquility of the marriage. Indeed, a number of options exist for couples beyond talking\nabout the risk of contracting HIV/AIDS when one of them feels that the other is\nendangering his/her life by indulging in extramarital affairs. One sometimes adopted by\nwomen, is to discourage the \"other woman\" by harassing her - by going to her home and\nasking \"Is my husband there?\" or even physically assaulting her (Schatz 2002). The\naggrieved person may also report the matter to the marriage counselor or elderly members\nof the extended family to intervene, and in extreme cases, resort to divorce. Discussions\nwithin marriage and ultimately involving the extended family, however, are less drastic. It\nis also more consistent with the local view of married life, which acknowledges that there\nwill be disagreements in the home but holds that disagreements should be resolved\namicably through \"discussion\" or, if that fails, through the mediation of relatives.\nAs in other countries of sub-Saharan Africa where the AIDS epidemic has become\ngeneralized, married husbands and wives are the largest sexually active group at risk of\ninfection from HIV in Malawi. Our data show that the vast majority of rural husbands and\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 8\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n250 http://www.demographic-research.org\nwives understand that AIDS is a threat to their lives, and that many perceive, correctly, that\ntheir fates are joined--that they are at risk from their spouse. It is widely believed that if\none spouse becomes infected, the other one will probably be infected as well. Infection is\nunderstood to be equivalent to death, since it is known that there is no cure for AIDS. Both\nwives and husbands believe that regular sex is a central aspect of marriage; both also\nbelieve that men and women (particularly men) may seek extramarital partners, which are\nperceived to be the vectors through which AIDS reaches the bedroom. The irony of this\nperception is that there is also a widespread belief in Malawi and many other African\ncountries that a single person is at a higher risk of HIV infection than a married person\nsince the former is more likely to be involved with multiple sexual partners. Consequently,\nsingle people are urged and even pressured to get married in order to reduce their risk of\ncontracting HIV/AIDS. However, simulation of HIV-infection rates among newly married\npeople in Malawi show that HIV infection is already present in 13-20 percent of the\ncouples (Bracher, Santow and Watkins Forthcoming). Although young women are more\nlikely to be HIV positive than men of the same age, the study shows that marriage puts\nwomen at a greater risk of HIV infection than men since only around 2% of the brides are\nestimated to be HIV-positive at the time of marriage Considering the central place of sex\nwithin marriage, and the realization that married people may indulge in extra-marital\naffairs, it is important to understand how husbands and wives express their fears against\nAIDS, and how they attempt to protect themselves.\nWe begin in Section 2 with a discussion of the data we use, which come from a\nhousehold survey conducted in 1998 and semi-structured interviews conducted in 1999. In\nSection 3 we briefly describe the context in which the data were collected. In Section 4 we\nuse household survey data to analyze the correlates of spousal conversations about AIDS.\nWe examine whether characteristics of the couple, indicators of risk to infection, and access\nto both formal and informal sources of information on AIDS are associated with whether\nor not they report having had a discussion with their spouse. In Section 5 we use qualitative\ndata to examine the content, structure and themes of spousal discussion. Our conclusions\nfollow in Section 6.\n2. Data and methods\nThis study uses data from the Malawi Diffusion and Ideational Change Project (MDICP),\nwhich involves longitudinal interviews with wives and husbands in three regions of rural\nMalawi. The project examines the roles of social interactions in the acceptance (or\nrejection) of modern contraceptive methods and of smaller ideal family size and the\ndiffusion of knowledge about AIDS transmission and acceptable preventive strategies.\nA household survey was conducted in 1998 (we call this survey Malawi 1, as it was\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 8\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 251\nfollowed by re-interviews of these respondents in 2001, which we call Malawi 2)\nEligible respondents were ever-married women aged between 15 and 49 years and\ntheir husbands. In 1999, semi-structured interviews were conducted with a randomly chosen\nand the 1999 qualitative data. The project is described in detail on:\nhttp://www.ssc.upenn.edu/Social_Networks/ and in Watkins et al. (2003).\n2.1 Quantitative Data\n1065 men (husbands of the currently married women) in three rural districts in Malawi:\nRumphi in the Northern Region, Mchinji in the Central Region, and Balaka in the Southern\nRegion. All of the areas are poor, with little in the way of development: roads are poor and\nelectricity is largely confined to nearby towns. The three regions are, however, quite\ndifferent in some aspects: the South is predominantly matrilineal and matrilocal, the North\nis predominantly patrilineal and patrilocal, and the Center is mixed (historically matrilineal\nand matrilocal, but over the last century it has been shifting to patrilineal and patrilocal\n(Zulu 1996). These differences may imply regional differences in gender systems that may\nbe relevant for the woman's autonomy and consequent role in spousal communication. For\nexample, where land, the basic economic resource, is passed through the maternal line, it\nis expected that wives would have more autonomy than where inheritance is through the\nThe final sample size for husbands was smaller than for wives primarily because some\nof the husbands were not present at the time of the survey, usually because they were\nworking, doing business elsewhere or attending funerals. Because some wives were away\nidentified themselves as monogamous (that there was no other wife in the relationship),\nwhile the rest of the couples gave discrepant responses on the type of marital union they\nwere in. The quantitative analysis is restricted to the 706 couples where both the husband\nand the wife reported that they were in a monogamous marriage to avoid the uncertainty\nof not knowing which wife the husband was referring to when answering questions about\nthe spouse. The sizable percentage of couples that gave discrepant responses on the type\nof marital union (13%), however, suggests that there are either a substantial number of\nunions with hidden relationships or differential understanding of the meaning of polygamy.\nThe restriction of the quantitative analysis to couples where both reported monogamous\nstatus, thus, potentially under represents couples in which there is high chance of infidelity\nand perhaps a greater chance of discussion if, as the qualitative data show, most spousal\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 8\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n252 http://www.demographic-research.org\ndiscussions about HIV/AIDS risk come about following suspicions or knowledge about a\nspouse's infidelity.\nDuring the survey, respondents were asked, \"Have you ever talked with your spouse\nabout the chances that you or she/he might get infected with AIDS?\" A study examining\nhusband-wife discordance in various issues using the 1998 survey data has shown that\nhusbands and wives sometimes do not agree in answers to a range of questions where they\nwould be expected to give similar responses (Miller, Zulu and Watkins 2001). These\ndiscrepancies were observed not only in spousal discussions about AIDS, number of\nchildren to have and use of family planning, but also on responses referring to ownership\nof various household goods. These discrepancies, also observed in the Malawi and Kenya\nDemographic and Health surveys, were systematic and gendered, in that when couples\ndiffered in their responses, husbands were more likely to respond in the affirmative than\nwives. The discrepancies were particularly large with respect to spousal conversations:\n30%, 35%, and 37% of the monogamously married couples gave discordant responses on\nthe occurrence of conversations on family planning, AIDS, and desired number of children,\nrespectively (Table 1). Given this discordance, it would not be appropriate to use the\nhusband or the wife's response alone in analyzing couple communication on such issues.\nThese patterns also highlight the need to understand determinants of discordance in\nreporting spousal communication. In order to take account of the couple discordance, we\nuse multinomial logistic regression to simultaneously examine factors that influence\nwhether husbands and wives talk about their risk of AIDS or not, and whether they agree\nabout the occurrence of such a discussion. The factors that we expect to be associated with\nthe likelihood that spouses report talking about the risk of contracting AIDS, based on the\nanalysis of the qualitative data in section 5, are in three categories: stimulus factors, risk\nfactors, and couple characteristics.\nStimulus factors: These are indicators of the extent to which the respondents have\nbeen exposed to information about HIV/AIDS from program sources (such as hearing\nmessages from radios, health clinics, and community based health workers) as well as\ninformal social networks (such as the number of people respondents have discussed AIDS\nwith, and the number of people they know who they think died of AIDS or have AIDS).\nSince discussion of community experiences with HIV/AIDS mostly travels through\ninformal social networks, we use the number of people respondents have talked to and the\nnumber of people they know who they think have died of AIDS as a general indicator of\nexposure to informal sources of information for the respondent. Our expectation is that\ncouples that have been exposed to more information (whether formal or informal) would\nbe more likely to talk with each other about AIDS than couples that have less exposure. In\nthe analysis we combine the husband and the wife's responses about exposure to formal\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 8\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 253\nTable 1: Percent of monogamous husbands and wives who have discussed HIV/AIDS\nrisk, number of children to have and use of family planning,\nREGION HIV/AIDS Risk Number of Children to have Use of Family Planning\nAll Three Areas\nNorth\nCentral\nSouth\nNote: Crude agreement is the percentage of couples where both husbands and wives gave the same response on the occurrence of\na conversation on the risk of contracting HIV/AIDS\nsources of information (radio, health clinics, and community health workers). We have a\nseries of four-category variables distinguishing: 1) where both the husband and the wife\nacquired information from the source, 2) where only the wife acquired information from\nthe source, 3) where only the husband acquired information from the source, and 4) where\nneither acquired information from the source. Men and women's network measures have\nbeen included in the analysis separately because they differ remarkably.\nRisk factors: These are factors that increase/decrease the need for a discussion, based\non the extent of perceived risk of AIDS faced by the couple (for instance, whether at least\none spouse suspects the other of infidelity or the extent of worry about the likelihood of\ncontracting the disease). We also include correct knowledge of the fact that a person can\ncontract the HIV virus from a healthy-looking person as a general measure of the\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 8\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n254 http://www.demographic-research.org\ncomprehension of the disease and associated risk. The expectation is that the greater the\nextent of perceived risk, the more likely the couple is to have discussed their joint risk.\nMarital Relationship Factors: The third category of factors reflects characteristics of\nthe couple that may hinder or facilitate discussion. The expectation here is that couples that\nfreely discuss other issues (like family planning) and share information about other aspects\nof their lives (such as income made) should be more predisposed to talk, given that there\nis need for them to do so. Additionally, couples that are socially close (small age\ndifference) or more educated may be more likely to discuss the risk of HIV/AIDS and other\nissues.\n2.2 Qualitative Data\nIn 1999 we carried out semi-structured interviews with randomly selected wives and\nhusbands (from the 1998 survey respondents) in order to understand what they say to each\nother when they talk about their risk of contracting HIV/AIDS. Such interviews are the only\npractical way to learn about the content of their conversations. The sample was determined\nby estimating the sample size that would be sufficient to provide variation across\nrespondents that was similar to the variation in the 1998 survey, guided by the distribution\nof relevant responses to attitudinal questions about family planning in the survey. Taking\nthe pronounced differences in responses in the 1998 survey, we estimated that we would\nneed a sample of at least 20 wives and 20 husbands in each of the three regions. Based on\nthe non-response experience of the 1998 survey, we selected a large enough sample to end\nup with around 25 male and 25 female interviews in each region. In the South, we selected\n38 women and 41 husbands, of whom 23 and 28, respectively, were interviewed. In the\nCenter we interviewed 26 women and 27 men from a selected sample of 37 women and 37\nmen. In the North, the sample consisted of 41 men and 41 women, of whom we\ninterviewed 27 women and 25 men. Thus, in the three areas, we interviewed a total of 80\nThe interviewers were the best of the local interviewers who had participated in the\n1998 survey; they were thus familiar with the overall emphasis of the project on informal\nconversational interactions. In order to encourage the interviewers to shift from the\nstructured approach of the 1998 survey to a more conversational approach in these\ninterviews, they were given a guide that listed the four major areas (family size, family\nplanning, HIV/AIDS and characteristics of network partners) that we covered in the\ninterviews, with a small set of questions in each area that we were interested in addressing.\nFor each issue, we asked the respondents what people in the communities say about these\nissues and went on to ask about the last conversation that they had on the issue. We also\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 8\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 255\nasked specifically if they had ever had a discussion on the topic with their spouse, and\nasked for details about the last conversation. For HIV/AIDS we asked the respondents how\npeople tell who might be infected, what people say about their worries about contracting\nthe disease, and details about the last conversation with their spouse. In training, we first\nconcentrated on explaining the rationale for each of the four areas, and we emphasized that\nas much as possible the interviewers should try to get who-said-what-to whom, rather than\njust a summary of the conversations. The transcripts show that the interviewers did\nunderstand the issues; although the discussions may be shorter as reported than they were,\nin fact there is a sense of conversations both between the interviewers and the respondents\nand between the husband and the wife.\nThe more informal approach taken in these interviews means that respondents'\nanswers were more spontaneous, and thus perhaps more valid. A disadvantage, however,\nis that the informal approach means that we do not have equivalent information for all\nrespondents. For example, below we note how many respondents' recall a conversation\nwith their spouse about AIDS mentioned the danger of children becoming orphans if the\nparents were infected and died, and how many respondents did not mention children in this\ncontext. Because the respondents remembered the conversation as including children, we\ninterpret these answers as representing the importance of children in spousal discussions\nof AIDS. For respondents who did not mention children in the last conversation, however,\nit may be that children were indeed less important during that conversation, although it is\npossible that they had referred to children in other conversations that took place prior to the\nlast one.\nThe interviews were conducted in the mother-tongue of the respondent, and usually\ntranscribed and translated by the interviewer. An a priori coding scheme was developed,\nand the interviews were coded in NUD*IST. Additionally, we conducted special coding\nfor this paper to depict the salience of the key themes coming out of the interviews. The\ncoding permitted us to describe typical responses as well as to indicate diversity. In the\nanalysis of the semi-structured interviews that follows, we use quotations that in our\nopinion best illustrate the perceptions of respondents in their approach to communication\nwith their spouse, and the content of their conversations. Our interpretation of both the\nquantitative and the qualitative data are aided by three separate projects directed by\nmembers of the research team in one or more of the same sites: interviews with parents of\nour respondents (Kaler 2001), interviews with respondents from the 1998 survey about\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 8\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n256 http://www.demographic-research.org\n3. Study context\nIn rural Malawi, HIV/AIDS is widely recognized as a new disease, one that was not there\nbefore, and as the most serious disease confronting society. When asked which disease is\nconsidered most serious, close to two-thirds of the qualitative interviewees mentioned\nHIV/AIDS. Many also recognize the need for innovations in sexual behavior to protect\nthem from this new disease. Since the levels of public and private discussion of\ninnovations are believed to be related (Caldwell 2000) it is useful to briefly summarize\npublic activities in relation to AIDS in Malawi.\nMalawi has one of the highest rates of HIV/AIDS infection in Sub-Saharan Africa.\nThe first cases of AIDS were officially acknowledged in 1985 (Chirwa 1998), and the\ncurrent HIV prevalence of 15% of adults is among the highest in the World\n(www.unaids.org). As in most sub-Saharan African countries, the government was slow to\nacknowledge the extent of the potential threat or to take visible action (Caldwell 2000).\nBlood screening began early, but it was only in 1989 that the government began to\nimplement a World Bank Medium Term Plan, considered the first evidence of the\ngovernment's commitment to AIDS prevention. Program efforts to promote behavior\nchange have consistently portrayed AIDS as spread by extramarital and premarital sex, with\nthe solution being chastity before marriage and fidelity after. Consequently, Information,\nEducation, and Communication (IEC) campaigns have been intensified throughout the\ncountry to educate people about the virtues of chastity and fidelity to avoid HIV/AIDS\ninfection. Most of the AIDS posters we saw in local clinics focused on warning against\nextramarital sex to prevent AIDS. There is also considerable advertising of condoms\nassociated with programs on social marketing of condoms by Banja La Mtsogolo, a local\nfranchise of Marie Stopes that began in 1991 and by Population Services International\nThe link between public activities and private discussion is probably weak for\nHIV/AIDS, since the rapid spread of HIV has been accompanied by an increase in deaths\nthat would occasion comment even in the absence of public discussion. It is thus, not\nsurprising that most of the respondents in the 1998 survey reported having discussed AIDS\nwith others in their social networks: only 16% of women and 7% of men said they had not\nhad such discussions. Funerals are frequent\u00adabout half the 1998 survey respondents had\nbeen to 1-4 funerals in the previous month, and about half had been to more than four. The\nvast majority of the respondents (83% of women and 72% of men) were either moderately\nor very worried about getting AIDS. Further analysis of factors that influence whether a\nperson is worried about the disease or not show that perception of one's fidelity is one of\nthe most significant determinants of worry (Smith forthcoming). Respondents are very\naware of the risk posed by the behavior of their spouse. When those who said they had a\nhigh risk of being infected were asked how they thought they were most likely to get\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 8\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 257\ninfected, 80% of women and 79% of men answered that it was through heterosexual sex,\neither with another partner or with a spouse who had been infected by another partner. The\nmajority of the survey respondents believe that AIDS is highly infectious, such that if one\nspouse is infected the other will also be infected. In the 2001 survey, 64% of female and\n68% of male respondents reported that infection is certain if one has sex once with an\ninfected person (Smith Forthcoming). When asked whether divorce is appropriate if a\nspouse is believed to have AIDS, the majority (84% of men as well as women in 1998) said\nit was not, often explaining that: \"if the spouse has it you have it too, so what's the point\nof leaving?\" However, the majority of the respondents (94% of men and 68% of women)\nreported that it is appropriate to divorce a spouse if she/he is unfaithful.\nIn summary, conversations about AIDS both in informal networks outside the family\nand with a spouse suggest that our respondents perceived the issue as important.\n4. Results: Correlates of spousal discussion of HIV/AIDS\nTable 2 shows multinomial logistic regression results for the analysis of determinants of\nspousal communication about AIDS. The reference category for the dependent variable\nis \"both said they did not talk\". Because the interpretation of the parameter estimates in\na multinomial logit regression is not straightforward, the same results are presented in Table\n3 as estimated probabilities that a man/woman in a given couple would fall in any of the\nthree categories of the dependent variable. The probabilities are calculated for each\ncovariate, while holding the remaining factors at their mean values.\nThe results highlight the importance of both formal and informal sources of\ninformation in influencing spousal discussion of the risk of contracting HIV/AIDS.\nCouples where both the husband and wife have accessed information about AIDS from\nclinics and those who interact with more people are associated with significantly higher\nprobabilities of talking about their risk relative to those with less exposure to such\ninformation. The big difference in spousal communication among couples where both\naccessed information about the disease from clinics and where only one of them did\nsuggests that husbands and wives individualize such information. Couples where the wife\ntalked with more than five people about HIV/AIDS are significantly more likely to disagree\nthat a conversation took place (probability of 0.145) than among couples where the wife\ntalked to less people. This suggests that talking to many \"outside\" people about HIV/AIDS\nmay influence some respondents to say they talked with their spouse, even when the\nconversation did not take place.\nThe quantitative results are also consistent with the hypothesis that spousal discussion\nof the joint risk of contracting HIV/AIDS is significantly promoted by the extent of worry\nabout contracting the disease. The likelihood of discussing the risk of contracting\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 8\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n258 http://www.demographic-research.org\nHIV/AIDS is highest when both spouses are very worried (as opposed to being slightly\nworried or not worried at all) about contracting the disease. When only the wife is worried,\nthe likelihood of spousal discussion about HIV/AIDS is not significantly different from\ncases where both are worried. However, when only the husband is worried about the\ndisease, the probability of discussing the joint risk to HIV/AIDS is significantly lower than\nwhen both are worried. This is in line with the qualitative data that show that discussions\nabout the joint risk of contracting the disease are initiated by women, and usually when they\nare worried or suspicious that the husband is having an affair. It should be noted,\nnevertheless, that a spouse's perception of risk can also be influenced by the spousal\ndiscussion itself, which raises a potential problem of endogeneity. As the qualitative data\n(presented in section 5) show, some respondents appear to indicate that their perception of\nthe disease and sexual behavior reformed following conversations with their spouses.\nHowever, the variable is included in this analysis because the vast majority of the\ntranscripts show that worrying about being infected, which is mostly influenced by the\nspouse's knowledge or suspicion of the partner's infidelity, is the key factor that pushes\nspouses to talk about their personal and joint risk of HIV/AIDS infection. The wife's\ncorrect knowledge that a person can contract the HIV virus from a healthy looking person\nis associated with higher probabilities of spousal communication. Considering that most\nmen who have extra-marital affairs do so with \"healthy-looking women\", wives who think\nthat a healthy-looking person can not transmit the HIV virus would be less worried about\nthe husband's extramarital liaisons and, consequently, less likely to initiate a discussion\nabout the need to take precautionary measures.\nMost of the couple-characteristic variables that we examined (e.g. education, age gap\nbetween spouses, sharing information on income, etc) did not have a significant impact on\nspousal communication about the joint risk to HIV/AIDS. Couples where both the\nhusband and the wife said they have never talked about family planning, however, exhibited\nthe highest probability (0.16) of both of them saying they have never talked about\nHIV/AIDS, implying that some couples are simply not predisposed to discuss such\nreproductive health issues.\nThe Z-score ranking of the most important determinants of spousal communication\n(included in the model) about the risk of contracting HIV/AIDS are the size of the woman's\ninformal social network, accessing information about the disease from clinics, and whether\nthe couple have also discussed use of family planning or not, followed by the husband's\nsocial network, women's correct knowledge that one can contract HIV/AIDS from a\nhealthy-looking sexual partner, and the extent of worrying about contracting the disease.\nRegion of residence was included in the model to check whether there were contextual\ndifferences in the extent of spousal communications about HIV/AIDS. The results show\nthat couples in the Center are significantly more likely to discuss the risk of HIV/AIDS than\ncouples in the North and South, while there was no significant difference between those in\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 8\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 259\nthe South and the North. The Center follows a mixed kinship and lineage system, while the\nNorth is predominantly patrilineal/patrilocal and the South is predominantly\nmatrilineal/matrilocal, which suggests that spousal communications on HIV/AIDS may be\ninfluenced by lineage systems and associated differences on female autonomy and status.\nIn the analysis of spousal discordance on various survey questions using the same data, it\nwas found that spousal differences on family planning and AIDS conversations were\nstatistically significant in the Center and the South, but not in the North (Miller, Zulu and\nWatkins 2001). Given that one of the key differences across the three areas is that the\nNorth has higher levels of women's status as measured by levels of education and freedom\nof movement (Schatz 2002), the study suggested that women's status could be positively\nassociated with spousal agreement. It is not clear what aspects of the contextual differences\nactually affect spousal communication.\nThe results for spousal disagreement are not as consistent and clear-cut as the ones\ndistinguishing couples where both reported either that a conversation took place or did not\ntake place. Couples where the wife has more network partners and the ones where the wife\ncorrectly knows that one can contract the disease from a healthy-looking person increased\nthe likelihood of discordance while cases where the husband was worried about contracting\nthe disease significantly reduced the likelihood of discordance.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 8\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n260 http://www.demographic-research.org\nTable 2: Effect of various factors on the likelihood of spousal discussion of HIV/AIDS\nrisk (Multinomial logistic regression coefficients and standard errors:\nReference category is \"husband and wife say they did not talk about\nNorth (reference category) - -\nAIDS network partners (wife)\n0-4 (reference category) - -\nAIDS network partners (husband)\n0-4 (reference category) - -\nHeard about AIDS at Clinic\nBoth say they have (Reference Category) - -\nWorry about getting AIDS\nBoth are very worried (Reference Category) - -\nTalk about FP\nBoth say they talked (reference category) - -\nWife's Age\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 8\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 261\nTable 3: Estimated probabilities for spousal discussion about HIV/AIDS Risk, 1998\nMalawi survey\nAIDS network partners (wife)\nAIDS network partners (husband)\nHeard about AIDS at Clinic\nWorry about getting AIDS\nKnowledge that one can contract HIV from a healthy\nTalk about FP\nWife's Age\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 8\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n262 http://www.demographic-research.org\n5. Content of spousal conversations about HIV/AIDS\nIn what follows, we use semi-structured interviews to describe the content of spousal\ncommunication on AIDS in our study communities. We emphasize that we were not able\nto overhear conversations as they actually occurred: we only have access to what the\nrespondents chose to tell us about them. Many conversations are reported in \"he said, she\nsaid\" format, giving the impression of a real conversation. They appear, however, to have\nbeen brief and somewhat laconic. This may adequately reflect the actual conversations.\nOn the other hand, spousal conversations are clearly private: almost all respondents said\nthat they occurred when the husband and wife were alone, and respondents\u00adperhaps some\nmore than others\u00admay have wished to protect this privacy by being brief about what they\ndiscussed.\nIn presenting the results, we identify respondents by region (S=SOUTH, C=CENTER,\nand N=NORTH), gender (M=male, F=female) and ID number. The interactions between\ninterviewers and respondents include many repetitions and murmurs (e.g. \"Mmm\", \"Eeeh\");\nwe include these as they give a sense of the conversational flow. There are evident gender\ndifferences in some aspects of respondents' approaches to spousal conversation, and we\ncomment on these. We did not detect regional differences, but since region was significant\nin the preceding analysis of correlates of spousal discussions, we provide such identifying\ninformation as well. The lack of regional differences in the content of spousal conversations\nsuggests that despite the structural differences (in kinship, residence, and religion, etc.)\nacross the three regions, husbands and wives use the same conversational strategies and\nraise similar issues when they discuss their joint risk of contracting HIV/AIDS.\nOverall, it is evident that both spouses perceive their fates to be joined: that if one becomes\ninfected, the other will also be (see, also Schatz 2002, Tawfik 2002). The word \"move\"\nused below is one of a set of terms (moving, movements, \"movious\", walking) that are\noften used to refer to sex outside marriage:\nI: What made you talk about AIDS? R: We saw a certain woman from our village,\nthen my wife started warning me that `my husband, these days do not move anyhow,\nbecause the times are bad, if you catch this disease then I will automatically catch\nit too, then our children would be orphans when we die' (N-M-04)\nOver and over again, both husbands and wives emphasize that it is not enough for one\nspouse to take precautions against infection with HIV but that both of them must do it.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 8\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 263\nI: So did you speak with your wife about the dangers of the world, that there is\nAIDS? R: Yes. I have. I: So, what made you speak with your wife? R: Because we\nsee how people die of AIDS, and how dangerous it is. So it acts as a lesson to both\nof us that if I do this, I might die. So we stay without going with other partners. I:\nWhat did your wife say about it when responding to what you said? R: It's the same.\nShe says that we need to take care of ourselves, because we might say that we don't\nhave it while we have got it. So, let us continue the way we are, avoid other partners,\nbecause if you do not, you die soon. That's what she said. (C-M-04)\nI: Have you ever talked with your husband on the AIDS issue? R: Yes. I: O.k.! R:\nWe were talking that `My darling, this time it's dangerous...I: mmh....R: maybe I can\nbe moving with others, you can die because of me....I: mmh....'R: But that is not\ngood.' I: Eeh. R: We were both agreeing that it's not good and comforting one\nanother...I: Mmh...R: ...I should be looking after my partner and the partner looking\nI: Can you tell me when you talked with your husband about how you can protect\nyourself from this disease in your house? R: With my husband, we talk daily. I: Day\nby day? R: Yes. I: What does he say when you talk to him? R: Aah! The answer is\nthe same \u00ad`I can take care of myself'\u00adso I cannot know the life of my partner\ninwardly. Mmh! Eeh! I: What makes you talk day after day? R: I have seen the\ndanger in the world, oh! (N-F-04).\nThese segments are typical not only in portraying perceptions of a joint fate, but also\nin the assumption that the major source of infection is from a spouse who \"moves\" around.\nThis is supported by the 1998 household survey data, where respondents were asked what\nthey thought was the way they were most likely to contract AIDS. For males, 38%\nanswered that it was from \"other partners\"; while 23% reported that it was from their\nspouse. More female respondents than male respondents thought their most likely risk was\nfrom their spouse (51%), while 21% said it was from another partner. The qualitative\ninterviews, however, suggest that when women attributed risk to \"other partners\", they\nmostly meant \"other partners of my husband\" or \"other partners of myself if I had them.\"\nThis is not to say that all wives are faithful, but rather that both men and women are\nreluctant to acknowledge the unfaithfulness of a wife to an interviewer. A man who has\nevidence that his wife is unfaithful is expected to divorce her, and the norms about fidelity\nfor a woman are such that we expect women to under-report extramarital affairs. That\nwomen's extramarital affairs are under-reported is suggested by the contrast between the\nlow proportion of female respondents on our survey that reported an extramarital affair and\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 8\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n264 http://www.demographic-research.org\nthe higher proportion (about double) of their \"best friends\" who the respondent said had\nan extramarital affair. In addition, an intensive study of a sub-sample of the 1998 survey\nrespondents by Linda Tawfik asked women about the extramarital affairs of their married\nfemale friends and men about their affairs with married women. Broaching these sensitive\nquestions only on a third interview with the respondent, Tawfik found that extramarital\naffairs by women were not rare (Tawfik 2002).\n5.2 Stimulus of HIV/AIDS conversations\nIf a respondent reported that the couple had not discussed AIDS, the interviewer asked why\nthat was the case. The answers were typically short; the respondents either simply repeated\nthat they had not talked, or said they did not talk because there was \"no point\". It may also\nbe that respondents simply did not wish to tell the interviewer about a conversation. On\noccasion, however, the \"no point\" was amplified as the respondent explained that there was\nno need to talk because they trusted each other or that the respondent (in this case, always\na wife) could not believe what the man would say, so there was no point in addressing the\ntopic.\nI: Have you ever discussed with your spouse the dangers of AIDS? R: We have\nnever discussed the issue. I: Then why didn't you discuss with the spouse? R: There\nis no reason. I: Therefore it means you don't get worried with the disease?\n(laughter) R: It's a very dangerous disease and we do fear it. I: Then why not\n[discuss]? R: It's because though we will discuss, there is nothing [we can do].I:\nThere isn't what? R: Though you try your best to discuss this, he will still continue\ndeceiving you and go with other women. I: Oh. R: Therefore you will be just\nwasting your time and energy telling him. I: It means you don't totally trust him that\nyou think he does move with other women. R: Yes. I: Is there anywhere you got the\ninformation that he has a girlfriend? R: I have never heard it. (S-F-19)\nI: Why didn't you talk with him? R: Because everybody thinks that maybe my friend\n[husband] takes care of himself. I: Ooh! You just think of that? R: Yes, thinking that\nmaybe he takes care of his body (S-F-21).\nR: We already know that there is AIDS in the world and we hear about that in the\nradio but we have never discussed. I: What do you hear on the radio? R: That they\nhave searched everywhere, but there is no cure for the disease...I: Since you say this\nis in the mouths of people everywhere, haven't you discussed with her? R: She\nalready knows there is AIDS in the world, so we need not discuss because she also\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 8\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 265\nhears it on the radio that the disease exists. So how do we discuss this when we\nalready have access to all the information we need from the radio? (N-M-18)\n\"No point\" was likely to be explained in terms of either an expected disagreement with\nthe spouse, as in the segment above or the respondent explains that both husband and wife\nhave similar views so there is no point in a discussion. Of all the qualitative respondents,\n7 women and 2 men said they had never discussed AIDS with a spouse.\nIf the respondent said that spousal discussion about AIDS had occurred, the\ninterviewer asked how the issue came up and who initiated the discussion. In the 14 cases\nwhere women indicated who initiated the discussion, half were initiated by men and the\nother half by women. The same breakdown was noted for men: 7 initiated by women, 8 by\nmen and 2 by both. However, in cases where the couple talked specifically about their own\nrisk or contracting the disease or where one spouse suspects the other of infidelity, wives\nwere more likely than husbands to initiate the conversation on AIDS. Out of the 18 cases\nwere one spouse suspects the other of infidelity, women initiated conversations in 13 and\nmen in 5 cases. It seems, therefore, that when couples are discussing HIV/AIDS in general,\nmen and women are equally likely to initiate the discussions, but women are more likely\nto initiate discussions relating to the couple's own risk of contracting the disease. A study\nof factors affecting husband's infidelity using the 1998 and 2001 survey data demonstrates\nthat suspicions about a spouse's fidelity are often not baseless; wives' suspicions remained\nsignificantly associated with husband's infidelity even after controlling for other factors\ntypically associated with infidelity among men (Clark 2003).\nIn 37 cases the conversation began with a reference to something outside the domestic\nsphere\u00adhearing something about HIV/AIDS from the formal system (9 from the radio, 1\nfrom clinic or health facilities), a conversation with a network partner (3), or, particularly,\nmention of seeing or hearing about someone who was very ill or who was suspected of\nhaving died of AIDS (24). Certainly the illness or death of friends, relatives or neighbors\nis a topic of intense interest. But it may also be that beginning a discussion of AIDS with\na spouse by referring to something outside the home provides cover for the introduction of\nwhat could be a sensitive topic, given the normative importance of marital fidelity and the\nstrong perception of the link between AIDS and infidelity.\nIn addition to conversations that were apparently provoked by something outside the\ndomestic sphere, some may have been provoked by an immediate need, specifically by the\nperception of one of the spouses that the other needed to be persuaded to reform. In 41 of\nthe cases, the spouses caution each other against extramarital affairs, while in 20 cases the\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 8\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n266 http://www.demographic-research.org\nwife cautions the husband, and in 4 the husband cautions the wife. The fact that concerns\nabout the risk from a partner is a central theme of the conversations is also evident in\nexamining the explanations that the 9 respondents who said they had never discussed AIDS\nwith their spouse gave:\nR: That one's heart is the same as mine....I: How do you know? R: Ah, I see him. I:\nOho. R: Yes, because if a person is doing this and that, it is easy to see him. I: Just\nto see a person, you can know his heart? R: Yes, of course, because I got married\nto him long time ago but I never heard anything. I: You never heard anything about\nhim? R: I never heard anything and I never saw him going here and there (S-F-22).\nThe closest any male respondent came to admitting suspicions of his wife was one\nman who, when asked whether he thought he might become infected by his wife, answered\nas follows:\n\"I: Now have you heard that others are afraid of catching the disease from their\nwives? R: Aah! No, I have never heard. I: Never? R: Yes. I: O.k., do you yourself\nhave those thoughts that you might catch this disease from your wife? R: I do have,\nin my heart. I: If you do have, what do you tell your wife so she knows you are\nafraid of catching AIDS from her? R: I do give her the family security, telling her\nto remember of these issues, mmm! I: What do you tell her? R: 'My wife, you should\nnot forget the words I tell you, don't even once go out to walk with other men,\nbecause if you do you will cut off your life and my life.' Eeeh!\" (S-M-23).\nIt may be that more men did have suspicions, but in the context of rural Malawi it\nwould be embarrassing to admit that one was still married to an unfaithful wife. In contrast,\nmany women doubted their husband. In four cases the wife referred to specific cases of\ninfidelity. As evidence, women used observation: the husband returns from drinking late\nat night and the wife warns him that drinking is one thing but moving with other women is\nanother. Or the wife may have found letters from another woman, found condoms in his\npocket, or other people have told her that they have seen him with another woman. A\nwoman with direct evidence has a number of options other than trying to persuade her\nhusband to reform\u00adshe may seek mediation from relatives, she may divorce him, or she\nmay harass the other woman by going to the other woman's house and challenging her by\nsaying \"Is my husband there?\", or even fighting with the other woman (Schatz 2002).\nWomen without specific evidence of a husband's infidelity may also have doubts based on\nthe widespread assumption that it is difficult for men to be satisfied with only one sexual\npartner:\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 8\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 267\nR: We have to care for our lives and he also tells me that even him, he doesn't go\nwith other women, no! Only one, so I don't know whether he tells me the truth. That\nmuch I cannot know.\" ... Yes, I did tell him that night that `you can be cheating me\nthat you are not moving, well, it is better to go to those who have (keep) condoms\nand take them wherever you go', but that is where we do not agree' (C-F-09)\nI: Did you talk with your husband about how you can protect yourselves from\nAIDS? R: Since I am a woman who always stays at home, we are tobacco growers\nand if we have money, my husband goes to the bars to use the money with bar-girls.\nDue to that problem, I do tell him that we are two wives so there is no reason for\ngoing outside. It is better to use one of us for what he needs at that time other than\ngoing to the bar and taking diseases for us. I: Did he agree that he will be sleeping\nwith the two of you only? R: He agreed but I don't know if it was true. I: Oooh!\nDon't you trust him? R: I can't trust him much because it is always difficult for a\nman to depend on one woman. (C-F-03)\nI: Have you ever discussed with your wife in the house... about this story of AIDS?\nR: We do discuss. I: What do you discuss? R: In discussing, we say that here, for\nus to prevent this disease, there is need that each one should not do adultery. I: Who\nstarts this AIDS story in your house? R: My wife starts it. I: So how does she start\nit? R: In starting it, it happens that maybe you were somewhere chatting, and that\nyou have come very late, and she asks you \"aaa, when coming in this time, where\nwere you? Nowadays, it's dangerous. Maybe you were with other women, explain\nit very well\". So if you explain very well, it happens that she believes and that's\nhow a woman starts it. I: Now, when was the last time that you discussed this story\nof AIDS? R: For the last time, the day before yesterday, I came very late, also the\nday before yesterday. So my wife asked, \"where were you?\" I: So what did you say?\nR: When she asked ... I replied that I was up there (nearby village) at Chilito. When\nI told her that, she did not leave it there. In the morning, she went to ask if it was\ntrue that I was there. Fortunately, they acknowledged that I was indeed there. (C-M-\nIn a survey conducted in the same district in the South (Balaka) as the 1998 survey,\nwomen and men were asked whether they agreed or disagreed that women and men could\nbe satisfied with only one sexual partner (Tavrow 1994). When respondents referred to the\nother gender, about 54% of women and 45% of men said they disagreed; when respondents\nreferred to their own gender, about 40% of the men and 33% of the women said they\ndisagreed.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 8\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n268 http://www.demographic-research.org\nWhen a woman did directly accuse her husband in a conversation with him, these were\nmet either with denials or with the husband saying he had reformed and was not engaged\nin such activity any more, or sometimes the husband tried not to prolong the conversation\nby answering \"Yes\" or \"No\" and trying to be non committal. Women who had made an\nexplicit accusation typically did not challenge the denials or expressions of reform. Some,\nhowever, indicated to the interviewer that they were not convinced:\nR: Talking with him that, `as you know, the world is not good as it was before.\nWhat's needed now is that we should depend upon each other to avoid having\nit'...Eyaa! Since he is a man, he can just answer saying `yes', since he knows all the\nways to do things secretly. He knows, yes. Then everyday you just say `aaa! But my\nfriend, there is nothing good outside.' I: Eeh! He! What did he respond when you\nsaid that? R: He just responded saying `aaa! I can't do that because I know that the\nworld nowadays is not good, so I can't do it [move around], let us just depend on\neach other.' I: Did you believe his denials? R: I believe in him but not very, since\nnobody knows what someone else is thinking about. But I don't think that is true,\nbecause men are difficult. I: Mmm! And now if the husband has answered you as he\ndid, what did you answer then? R: I just said that `o.k., since you already know that\nthere is a dangerous disease outside. If you trust me, let us continue.' (S-F-17).\nI: O.k., what about your husband, have you ever talked with him about AIDS? R:\nYes, he talked also. I: Oh. R: Eh. I: So can you remember the last time you talked\nabout the issue? R: Because for the men they can be saying `There is a dangerous\ndisease, I can't walk in the bush, I can't do this.' But sometimes they do what they\ndenied they could do. For example, now he was saying that he can't have two wives,\nbut as of now he has married another wife. So can I believe that he can't do bad\nthings? I: Eh. R: He can do because he has already done it. He doesn't know if the\nwoman he has married is fine or even that she has a disease, or even me, I cannot\nknow. I: ooh. So that day when he was saying that, what happened for him to talk\nlike that? R: Ah, only that he was happy himself. So when he was happy like that he\nstarted talking. I: Eh. R: So what was wrong in his mind, I can't know, for it is men.\nI: Eh. R: So I just heard `I want to marry another wife'. Then I said, `okay, go and\nmarry.' Can I stop him while his heart wants? He can go. I: So what did you tell him\nthe day he started talking about AIDS? R: I told him that \"If a person moves around,\nyou take diseases\u00adfor example, for you and me, for us women, you can be saying\nthat `You have your husband, you can't go in the bush [outside marriage], and you\nstay at home. But maybe you men can be saying that `I don't want my wife to walk\nin the bush' but you are the one who walks in the bush and take the disease and gives\nit to your wife in the house, and the wife becomes sick and you the owner become\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 8\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 269\nsick too. That is a very difficult way.' He said `Oh me no, I cannot do that', but now\nhe has done the same thing he said he cannot do. (S-F-18).\nI: So, what about this issue of AIDS? What conversation did you have with your\nhusband? R: We talked. I said: \"You should stop moving around. There is AIDS\nthese days. It is important to take care of yourself\". I: Ah ah! So what did he say?\nR: He just said: \"That's true\". But I cannot trust what he says. I: Why can't you trust\nwhat he says? R: Ah, men move around too much. I: Ah ah! They go this way and\nthat way? R: mmmh that's it. I: So you fear that your husband might be going out\nwith this woman and that woman? R: Eeeh, these men, you can't tell. I: Oh, you just\nwonder? R: Yes, I don't know. I: So you just fear? R: Eeeh, it is really better to die\nfrom a disease from God [rather than from AIDS]. (C-F-18).\n5.4 Marital relationship\nDirectly challenging a spouse about infidelity risks an argument, which both spouses try to\navoid because persistent arguments are not compatible with a good marriage. This is\nevident in the persistent use of the pronoun \"we\" rather than \"you\", e.g. \"We must be\ncareful, my friend\" rather than \"you must be careful\". There is perhaps a somewhat greater\nburden on the wife to avoid an argument, related to gender roles: wives' \"rudeness\" is often\ngiven by men as a justification for divorce (Schatz 2002), but the reciprocal is often not the\ncase. Moreover, the woman faces the threats of violence, or the husband leaving her and\ntaking another wife. Thus, when talking with their husbands, women were much more likely\nto talk in general terms about men's behavior (as noted earlier, only four made reference\nto specific infidelity) and to present women in general and themselves in particular to\nsimply be \"at home\", in the domestic space while men were exposed to the temptations of\nthe world.\nAfrican marriages are sometimes characterized as being based more on utilitarian than\nemotional considerations. The parents of our respondents interviewed in a separate project\ncomplained that marriages of today are shallow, quickly made and quickly broken, unlike\nthose of their generation (Kaler 2001). Yet in interviews about marriage conducted in\nanother project, respondents often spoke of marrying for love (Schatz 2002), and many of\nour interviews suggest some level of intimacy and closeness between husbands and wives:\nR: \"After we eat nsima [the staple food, made of maize flour] and get enough, we\ntalk that \"you have seen that there is AIDS nowadays...I: ...eh....R: ...so AIDS is\ndifficult...I: Eh...R: Every person should be at home with his wife...I: eh...R: ...if you\nare not married keep quiet, and better get married....I: eh...R: ...because the disease\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 8\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n270 http://www.demographic-research.org\nis difficult. I: Eh. R: It is different from other diseases. I: Eh. R: Some diseases get\nbetter if you take medicine, a person recovers....I: Eeeh...R: But this disease...I:\neh...R: ...has no medicine. I: Eh. R: No medicine, we die (S-F-13).\nR: As we're lying in bed at night, I often talk to my wife and tell her that `My wife'\nand she said `Eeh', `know that this world is now dangerous, as we are married we\nshould try to avoid moving. And take care about the family. The disease is now too\ndangerous, you may catch the disease and give it to me, or I may catch the disease\nand give it to you. Then we all die, and our children will suffer later on... (S-M-23)\nSpousal discussions of AIDS were often framed in terms of care for the children: they\ngive the strong impression of husbands and wives committed to the joint responsibility of\nraising and providing for their children. The speakers often explicitly note that if one is\ninfected, both will die, but the emphasis is on the fate of their children should they be left\norphans. Concern for the children appears to be genuine and profound, but it may also serve\na tactical purpose, a way of emphasizing the importance of AIDS by noting its implications\nnot for the health and well-being of the speaker but for their descendants:\nR: Myself, I said...that you are seeing your friends are dying leaving the children.\nIs it good that your children should also be suffering like this? ...Because if it has\naffected one, killed one, the other is also finishing [dying]... So there is nobody to\ncare for the children here on earth. Ah! We are seeing our friends dying\u00ad-how they\nare dying. In our family, our sisters, and our brothers\u00adthey have all finished [died]\nleaving children-\u00adorphans. (N-F-23).\nR: I talked with him that nowadays, we have to depend on each other because there\nis a dangerous disease of AIDS. I: Was that sentence spoken by you or your\nhusband? R: I was the one talking. I: What did he answer you? R: He said that `Of\ncourse, I am controlling myself to avoid the virus which causes AIDS because AIDS\nis killing many people and if I die my children will suffer because there is nobody\nto look after them since my mother is very old. I: When he answered you, what did\nyou say then? R: I said that `If you are controlling yourself, then you are right\nbecause I can control myself, but to a man it is difficult so you must try hard to\ncontrol yourself.' (C-F-06)\nI: Eeeh, have you ever discussed with your wife this issue of AIDS? R: We do\ndiscuss, that, `see now out there it is dangerous, we must take care of ourselves.\nBecause if we will go on unknown ways we are going to be injured. See, there are\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 8\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 271\nchildren, they will be orphans, who would take care of them?' And she was agreeing\nthat `It is true, we must be careful.' (S-M-07)\nAlthough children are often emphasized, this is not invariable: the majority (22 cases)\nreferred to the importance of avoiding AIDS either for sake of the children alone or of the\nparents and the children. However, in 18 cases it was the parents themselves who were of\ncentral concern.\nR: We talk...that `my wife, sometimes men who move and women who move are\nproblematic, because I can get the disease of AIDS outside and run into the house\nand then meet you and give it to you, thus...I have destroyed the marriage... So who\nis going to work for me then? ... Nobody to work with me... Or you will move and\ngive me a disease, and who is going to help you with development [improving the\nfamily's wellbeing]? (S-M-13)\nSometimes women use examples of their friends, relatives or neighbors as a way of\njustifying the conversation and also to support their claims (12 cases). For instance,\ncouples where one partner is having extra marital affairs is mentioned as a way of warning\nthe partner to avoid having such affairs, and also as a way pointing out their dangers; for\ninstance the danger of HIV/AIDS infection for both partners. The same strategy is also\nused in spousal discussions relating to use of contraceptives. Women mostly cite other\npeople who are using family planning and how it has greatly assisted these persons or the\nproblems they have faced because of using family planning methods depending on whether\nthe conversation is for or against family planning. Examples of families with many children\nwho are constantly sick or starving are mentioned as a way of bringing up a conversation\non family planning.\nAlthough we did not specifically ask the respondents whether the discussions about\nthe risk of contracting HIV/AIDS helped in promoting preventive sexual behavior, there\nis a sense in the reports that those who initiated the discussions believed, or at the very least\nhoped, that the discussions would lead to reform in behavior. Many women who had doubts\nabout their husbands' fidelity pleaded with them to stop moving around or avoid the\ntemptations of the world to save their own lives, and ensure that their children do not suffer\nwhen orphaned. In some cases, as the examples below show, some of the men conceded\nthat the discussions got them to think twice about their behavior:\nI: So, did you speak about AIDS in your house? R: We had a conversation. I: Who\nstarted to speak about this story? R: Who started to speak was my wife. She said,\n'My husband, the greatest thing, I'm your wife. Don't just say if you go to Ulongwe\nor Liwonde (nearby small towns) or elsewhere and start gazing at women (being\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 8\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n272 http://www.demographic-research.org\nattracted to). I: mmh! R: 'No, my husband, not that.'so I listened to her...I: mmh!\nR: Because I know that when this woman is warning me with these words, she is\ngiving me life.'I: mmh! R: If I ignore her and say what she tells me is useless, in\nthe end I might get into problems .... So I listen to her...I must hear what my\nfriend (wife) says. (S-M-02)\nI: Oh! So what did you say? R: I said that, but in this world there is a disease, we\nmust fear for each other...I: eh... R: in what we do I: Ooh, so you just said so? R:\nYes. I: Didn't you continue? R: No, I didn't continue. I: So what did he answer?\nR: He said, oh, I think each person should take care of himself. I: Oh, so what did\nhe mean by \"take care of yourself?\" R: Taking care of yourself means that they\nshould avoid moving around with other women outside. I: Eh R: Mmmm. I: Ooh.\nSo for you to start this story that there is AIDS, as you have explained, how did\nit start, what started it? R: I was surprised with his movements. Eh, he was coming\nlate at night, and then I started saying 'aah, he will bring me what? He will bring\nme AIDS.'I: Have you ever heard your husband express his worried about AIDS?\nR: Him? I: Yes. R: He talks. I: What does he say? R: He says that...I: Eeeeh. R:\n'me, though they are saying that I do move around...I: Eeeeh R: Those people ...\nthey are not saying good things, nowadays I have changed. (S-F-20).\nWhether the conversations actually lead to a reform of sexual behavior or not is a\ncritical issue that is beyond the scope of this paper. As mentioned before, some studies\nsuggest that spousal communication may be associated with adoption of preventive\n6. Conclusion\nWhile various studies have shown that spousal communication facilitates adoption of\nmodern family planning, little is known about the relationship between spousal\ncommunication and adoption of protective behavior against HIV/AIDS, as well as factors\nthat facilitate or inhibit spousal communication. In this study we use quantitative and\nqualitative data collected from rural Malawi to examine correlates of husband-wife\ncommunication about the risk of contracting HIV/AIDS and what husbands and wives say\nto each other about their risk of contracting HIV/AIDS in order to understand the strategies\nthat couples are following to prevent the intrusion of AIDS into the home.\nThe quantitative data show that the most important factors influencing spousal\ncommunication about the risk of contracting HIV/AIDS are size of the woman's informal\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 8\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 273\nsocial network, accessing information about the disease from clinics, whether the couple\nhave also discussed use of family planning or not (which we interpret as a proxy for the\ngeneral level of spousal conversation about reproductive health issues) and the extent of\nworry about contracting the disease. Similar factors generally determine whether husbands\nand wives agree that they talked or not, although the results for spousal discordance are less\nclear-cut and consistent. These data, thus, highlight the importance of access to information\nabout AIDS and worrying about the disease in spousal communication; people who interact\nwith others more and those who report more program information are more likely to bring\nup the issues with their spouses than those who do not have large social networks and\nprogram connections.\nThe qualitative data show that spousal communication is an important mechanism\nthrough which married people express their fears and anxieties to their partner as a result\nof the recognition that controlling their own behavior is not sufficient. The discussions of\nHIV/AIDS risk and preventive strategies within marriage are often introduced with\nreference to specific stories and events relating to AIDS and irresponsible sexual behavior.\nThese discussions on HIV/AIDS are conducted cautiously, and, for the most part, to avoid\nmarital conflicts and disagreement. The common strategy that is followed to achieve a\nharmonious discussion is to introduce the discussion with reference either to something or\nto someone outside the domestic sphere or to concerns about the implications of the disease\non their children should both parents die. Contrary to the pessimistic accounts in the\nliterature about how people have lost hope and given up to fate on HIV/AIDS in Africa, the\nqualitative data show that husbands and wives in rural Malawi are actively confronting and\nchallenging their spouses to prevent the intrusion of the vicious disease into their lives.\nWhen the couple fails to achieve such a discussion, the recourse is to seek intervention\nfrom relatives or friends, although serious disagreements on these issues may lead to\nphysical confrontations or divorce.\nMost discussion on the joint HIV/AIDS risk, especially those where one spouse\nsuspects the other of infidelity, are introduced by women. This is not surprising, since it\nis generally understood in these communities by both men and women that men indulge in\nextra marital relationships more than their wives. Women often make reference to\ndiscussions that they have had with their friends about AIDS and how the disease is\ndevastating their communities by killing husbands and wives, leaving children to suffer.\nSo, rather than the women arguing that the man should not indulge in reckless sexual\nbehavior because he would infect and kill her, she focuses on what would happen to the\nchildren if both of them die. While the discussion may become confrontational if the\nwoman directly accuses her husband and the man denies her accusations, the focus on the\nfuture of the children or talking about men's irresponsible sexual behavior in more general\nterms appears to be a strategy to ensure that the discussion is constructive and that the\ncouple agree that there is indeed need to be careful and/or reform sexual behavior. Men\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 8\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n274 http://www.demographic-research.org\nnormally respond to such general discussions, and even to direct accusations of infidelity,\nby saying that they are aware of how dangerous the world has become, and that they are not\nfoolish to be sleeping around recklessly, even when the evidence is there that they have\nbeen doing otherwise. The wives are often not fooled by such responses, though, because\nwhen asked what they think about what the husbands responded, some say that it is just a\nman's way of saying \"no\", and that it is not easy for a man to stick to one woman.\nAlthough the reported conversations are brief, they give a clear indication that verbal\ncommunication is actively utilized as a key strategy by marital partners, particularly wives,\nto persuade each other to avoid extramarital affairs to avoid falling victim of the AIDS\nmenace. The urgency to fight the threat of HIV/AIDS to marital partners has been paused\nas one of the key factors leading to the decline in the period of postpartum sexual\nabstinence in Malawi and other settings in sub-Saharan Africa (Cleland, Ali and Capo-\nChichi 1998, Zulu 2001). Wives, who bear most of the responsibility for observance of\nabstinence, are increasingly giving in to their husbands' demands to resume intercourse\nbefore the end of the normative duration of postpartum abstinence because of fears that the\nmen may go to other women and bring the HIV/AIDS virus home (Zulu 1996).\"\nIt is noteworthy, however, that none of the spousal discussions reported in this study\nmade reference to use of condoms when discussing strategies to deal with the joint risk of\ncontracting HIV/AIDS within marriage. The one reference to condoms was made by a\nwoman who was telling her supposedly promiscuous husband to use condoms with his other\nwomen; all discussions of preventive strategies within marriage focused on fidelity. This\nconfirms many other findings that signify the negative view associated with condom use\nwithin marriage. The condom is widely believed to be associated with extra-marital sex and\nasking for it, even in cases where the spouse knows or suspects that the partner is having\nother affairs, brings all sorts of tensions that many spouses are not prepared to deal with.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 8\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 275\nReferences\nBawah A.
