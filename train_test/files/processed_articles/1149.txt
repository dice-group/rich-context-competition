National physician survey data indicate that physicians in\nhigh-minority practices depend more on low-paying Medicaid, receive lower private insur-\nance reimbursements, and have lower incomes.

Lower incomes and rates of insurance coverage among minorities\naffect the capabilities, organization, and resources both at the site of care and in\nthe local delivery system. For instance, Peter Bach and colleagues found that a\nsmall percentage of primary care physicians disproportionately treat black Medi-\ncare patients. These physicians have less access to health care resources and lower\nqualifications than physicians who predominantly treat white patients.3 More-\nover, they report more difficulties obtaining needed services for their patients and\nproviding high-quality care to their patients in general. Similar results have been\nfound for hospital and nursing home care.4\nIn addition to comparing the reported problems of physicians whose patient\npanels consist of fewer versus more minority patients, we explore whether in-\ncreasing the resources flowing to high-minority physician practices, specifically\nby increasing Medicaid fees to physicians, might improve physicians' ability to\nprovide high-quality care and help reduce racial and ethnic disparities. We focus\non practice resources because this is a key factor over which public policy has a\ndirect and important influence.\nStudy Data And Methods\nn Data. We used data from the 2004\u00ad05 Community Tracking Study (CTS) Phy-\nsician Survey, supplemented by secondary information from the Census Bureau and\nother sources. The survey obtained a broad range of information from a nationally\nrepresentative sample of nonfederal patient care physicians who practiced at least\ntwenty hours per week. The weighted response rate was 52.4 percent. All analyses\nwere weighted to account for the probability of selection and to correct to differen-\ntial survey nonresponse.5 Most pertinently, the survey asked physicians what per-\ncentage of their patients were black and Hispanic and asked about various difficul-\nties respondents faced obtaining necessary services for their patients and delivering\nhigh-quality care.6 For this study we focused on the experiences of primary care\nphysicians (PCPs): general internists, family or general practitioners, and general\nn Analysis. We first profiled physicians in low-, medium-, and high-minority\npractices--those whose patient panels were less than 30 percent, 30\u00ad70 percent,\nand 70 percent black or Latino, respectively--focusing on physician and practice\ncharacteristics as well as indicators of patient resources, clinical burden, and insur-\nance reimbursements. Most of these data came from the survey, although some (area\nincome levels and uninsurance rates; Medicaid and private insurance physician pay-\nM i n o r i t y C a r e\nH E A LT H A F F A I R S ~ We b E x c l u s i v e w 2 2 3\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 02, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Because institutional practices, such as those associated with medical\nschools, hospitals, and community health clinics, often receive external support\nbeyond that obtained from insurers and patients, we also stratified these descrip-\ntive analyses by whether the physician worked in a solo or group practice versus\nother, more institutional settings (such as a hospital, health maintenance organi-\nzation [HMO], medical school, or clinic). Key results are highlighted in the text.8\nFinally, we assessed the degree to which disparities in problems reported by\nphysicians treating lesser or greater percentages of minority patients would be re-\nduced if practice resources were increased. To illustrate this, we regressed physi-\ncians' reports on a set of indicators of physician practice resources and then simu-\nlated the effect of increasing Medicaid payments to equal those of Medicare.9\nStudy Results\nAbout 52 percent of PCPs reported having patient panels with less than 30 per-\ncent minorities, 36 percent reported that 30\u00ad70 percent of their patients are mi-\nnorities, and 12 percent reported that minorities constituted more than 70 percent\nof their patient panels in 2004\u00ad05. The variation in the minority composition of\nphysician patient panels indicates that a relatively small number of physicians\ntreated a disproportionately large share of minority patients, consistent with pre-\nn Characteristics of low-, medium-, and high-minority practices. Patient re-\nsources and clinical burden. Our results confirm well-established associations between\ngreater minority presence, less insurance coverage, and lower income (Exhibit 1). In\n2004\u00ad05, physicians with greater portions of minority patients were located in areas\nwith lower median incomes and higher uninsurance rates. Moreover, physicians in\nhigh-minority practices received more than a third of their practice revenue from\nMedicaid--more than twice that of physicians in low-minority practices. These\npatterns are buttressed by the finding that among PCPs in high-minority practices,\n35 percent reported that patients' inability to pay was a major problem affecting\ntheir ability to provide high-quality care, compared with 23 percent of those in low-\nminority practices.\nLow-income patients often pose greater clinical burdens for physicians, be-\ncause of poorer health status, more complex personal and social conditions, and\ngreater communication and cultural barriers. We did not find, however, that PCPs\nin high-minority practices reported larger percentages of their patients as having\nchronic conditions or being elderly compared with those in low-minority prac-\ntices. Physicians treating large numbers of minority patients did report having a\ngreater percentage of patients with whom they have a hard time communicating\nbecause they speak a different language.\nD a t a W a t c h\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 02, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

In 2004\u00ad05, PCPs in high-minority practices\nwere more likely to be female and to be minorities themselves, compared with\nthose treating fewer minority patients. Only 35 percent of physicians in high-\nminority practices were white, non-Hispanic. Conversely, very few (3.4 percent)\nphysicians in practices with less than 30 percent minority patients were African\nAmerican or Hispanic themselves. Physicians in high-minority practices had\nfewer years of practice experience and were less likely to be board certified than\ntheir counterparts in low-minority practices (80.4 percent versus 89.2 percent).\nThey were also more likely to be pediatricians. International medical graduates\n(IMGs) were nearly twice as likely to be found in high- versus low-minority prac-\ntices in 2004\u00ad05. They constituted a majority in high-minority solo and group\nphysician practices.11\nRelative to PCPs with few minority patients, PCPs in high-minority practices\nwere less likely to work in solo and group practices and more likely to be in medi-\ncal school practices, community or state and local government health clinics, or\nnonhospital institutional settings. Physicians with a higher proportion of minor-\nity patients in their panels reported a greater percentage of their practice revenue\nas coming from managed care--specifically, capitated payments.\nPractice resources. Physician practice revenue was inversely related to the per-\ncentage of minority patients. Physicians in high-minority practices across all set-\ntings reported a greater share of practice revenues from the generally low-paying\nMedicaid program, as compared with those serving fewer minority patients.\nMoreover, physicians in high-minority practices were in locations where the ratio\nof Medicaid to Medicare reimbursements was significantly lower than the ratios\nminority practices were also located in areas with lower private insurance reim-\nbursements to physicians. As a likely result of these various factors, PCPs in high-\nminority practices reported lower incomes on average than those with fewer mi-\nnority patients, a pattern that held across both solo/group and more institutional\npractices.12 There were no significant differences in the use of health information\ntechnologies between physicians in high- and low-minority practices.\nn Do physicians caring for a high proportion of minority patients report\ngreater difficulty providing care? Relative to physicians treating fewer minority\npatients, those with a greater share of minority patients differed in their ability to\nobtain specialty care for their patients and were more likely to report many quality-\nrelated difficulties (Exhibit 2). No significant differences were found regarding con-\nstraints on clinical autonomy or exposure to certain financial incentives with the\npotential of compromising care, or in reported problems obtaining inpatient hospi-\ntal admissions or high-quality imaging (results not shown).13\nMore than a quarter of physicians in high-minority practices disagreed that it\nwas possible to provide high-quality care to all of their patients. This compares\nwith just 16 percent of those in low-minority practices.\nD a t a W a t c h\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 02, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Physicians with high-minority patient panels were more\nlikely than those treating few minorities to report difficulties obtaining specialty\ncare for their patients. Survey respondents were also asked whether they faced\ndifficulties obtaining specialty care for specific reasons. Physicians in high-minor-\nity practices reported greater difficulty obtaining specialty care for their patients\nbecause patients were uninsured or had insurance coverage that posed access bar-\nriers, but not because of an inadequate supply of qualified specialists in the area.14\nPhysician-patient interactions. Although minorities are less likely to have a usual\nsource of care than whites, physicians treating greater percentages of minority pa-\ntients were not significantly more likely to report an inability to maintain conti-\nnuity of care than those treating fewer minority patients. They were more likely to\nreport other difficulties with physician-patient interaction, however.

They also more frequently reported\nthat inadequate time during office visits was a major problem that affected their\nability to provide high-quality care (24 percent versus 11 percent). These patterns\nwere particularly evident among physicians in solo or group practices.15 To vali-\ndate the reports of inadequate time, we used physicians' reports on number of pa-\ntient visits and hours of direct patient care in the last week to estimate average\ntime spent per patient visit for PCPs in low-, medium-, and high-minority prac-\ntices. Physicians in high-minority practices spent about 30 percent less time per\npatient seen than those in low-minority practices (fifteen versus twenty-one min-\nutes).16 Those in medium-minority practices fell in between.\nDifficulties with care processes. PCPs in high-minority practices were significantly\nmore likely to report difficulties obtaining timely reports from other providers\nthan were PCPs in low-minority practices. Nearly a quarter of PCPs in high-\nminority practices reported that not getting timely reports from other providers\nwas a major problem affecting their ability to provide high-quality care, compared\nwith 11 percent of PCPs in low-minority practices, which suggests the existence of\nincreased challenges to care coordination in high-minority practices. Similarly,\nPCPs in high-minority practices were ten percentage points more likely to com-\nplain that the scope of care they are expected to provide without referral was\ngreater than it should be (28 percent versus 18 percent). This pattern is largely at-\ntributable to the reports of physicians in solo and group practices.17\nTaken together, the percentages shown in Exhibit 2 suggest that the ability of\nphysicians in high-minority practices to effectively function as their patients'\nmedical home is constrained.\nn The role of practice revenues. Although differences in patient, physician,\nand practice characteristics likely help explain differences in reported difficulties\nfaced by physicians in low-, medium-, and high-minority practices, we focus on the\nrole of practice revenues, because this is where public policy can most clearly have\nan impact. We regressed each physician report on variables indicating practice re-\nsources and then simulated responses if Medicaid payments were equal to Medicare\npayments. Exhibit 2 shows the absolute percentage-point difference from unad-\njusted means predicted to result if there was Medicaid-Medicare physician payment\nparity. Low Medicaid payment accounted for only part of the resource disadvan-\ntages many high-minority practices faced, because the simulations did not account\nfor the greater numbers of uninsured patients in high-minority practices and the\nlower average private-insurer payments. Nevertheless, the results indicate that if\nMedicaid fees were raised to Medicare levels, physicians' reports of difficulties pro-\nviding care for their patients would often decline, particularly among physicians\ntreating large portions of minority patients and for difficulties related to physicians'\nability to function as their patients' medical home: time during office visits, timely\nreports, ability to obtain specialist referrals, and appropriate scope of care.18\nD a t a W a t c h\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 02, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

In other words, it is not only individual patients' characteristics that influ-\nence the care received, but also the cumulative resources afforded to a practice\nbased on all of a physician's patients.\nPCPs in high-minority practices rely more heavily on lower-paying Medicaid\nreimbursements, devote more time to uncompensated charity care, and earn lower\nincomes. Magnifying these resource disparities, geographic areas with more high-\nminority practices tend to have lower Medicaid and private insurance reimburse-\nments than those with fewer high-minority practices.\nOur results indicate that the minority makeup of physicians' patient panels is\nassociated with greater reports from physicians of difficulties providing high-\nquality care. At least some of this relationship appears to be explained by the\nlower resources flowing to high-minority practices. Two of the quality indicators\nmost affected by Medicaid payment levels in our simulations, time spent per pa-\ntient seen and difficulties getting timely reports from other providers, suggest the\npossibility that physicians may compensate for the lower revenue flows by in-\ncreasing the volume of patients they see, reducing the time spent per patient seen,\nand perhaps devoting less time to coordinating and documenting care. This is de-\nspite the more complex psychosocial contexts and the language and cultural bar-\nriers that often complicate the treatment of lower-income and minority patients.19\nPhysicians in high-minority practices were more likely than those in low-\nminority practices to cite problems obtaining care from specialists for their pa-\ntients. Although more research is needed, one possible implication is that PCPs in\nhigh-minority practices are forced to treat patients with more-complex condi-\ntions whom they would normally refer to a specialist, placing further stresses on\nthe provider and potentially lowering the quality of care. We found that physi-\ncians treating more minority patients were more likely than those treating fewer\nminority patients to report that the scope of care they are required to provide is\ntoo broad, a finding consistent with this interpretation.\nn Study limitations. This study has several limitations that should be recog-\nnized. It relied on physician survey reports of difficulties providing high-quality\ncare, rather than on objective and validated quality measures. Survey reports can be\ninfluenced by differences in respondents' values, perspectives, and expectations. Re-\nporting error on the percentage of minority patients, although not likely to be large,\nmight have reduced our ability to detect differences between low-, medium-, and\nhigh-minority practices. Moreover, observations at only the physician level do not\npermit detailed controls for individual patient-level differences, just as observations\nat the individual patient level typically fail to adequately control for provider or sys-\ntem characteristics. Ideally, one would have hierarchical data that include represen-\nM i n o r i t y C a r e\nH E A LT H A F F A I R S ~ We b E x c l u s i v e w 2 2 9\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 02, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

The results of this study suggest that racial and ethnic\ndisparities in primary health care are in part systemic in nature, and the lower re-\nsources flowing to physicians treating more minority patients are a contributing\nfactor. In particular, we illustrated that if Medicaid payments to physicians were on\npar with those paid by Medicare, disparities in reported difficulties between physi-\ncians whose patient panels were made up of greater versus smaller proportions of\nminorities would diminish, often substantially. Low payments may be leading PCPs\nto reduce the time spent with patients and more generally diminish their ability to\nfunction effectively as their patients' medical home.\nPrevious research indicates that low Medicaid payments to physicians discour-\nage them from serving Medicaid patients, reducing access to care for beneficia-\nries.20 Our research suggests the possibility that low payments further threaten\nthe quality of care in ways that go beyond diminished access to services, thereby\ncontributing to racial disparities in health care. Moreover, low Medicaid pay-\nments to physicians with substantial Medicaid caseloads could be compromising\nthe care provided to all of the physician's patients, not just the Medicaid recipi-\nents.21 State legislators and governors should not assume that physicians will be\nable to shift costs so that Medicaid patients receive care equivalent to care for\nother patients. The concentration of Medicaid patients in a small number of phy-\nsician practices, a trend that is increasing, implies that opportunities for cost\nshifting are often limited.22 In addition to raising payment rates for the treatment\nof Medicaid patients, efforts to increase insurance coverage or otherwise increase\nresources flowing to physicians who serve low-income and minority populations\nwould implicitly reduce disparities.23\nApreviousversionofthispaperwaspresentedattheAssociationforPublicPolicyAnalysisandManagement\nAnnualResearchConference,Washington,D.C.,8November2007.Fundingforthisanalysiswasfromthe\nCommonwealthFund(Grantno.20060591).TheRobertWoodJohnsonFoundationfundsdatacollectionforthe\nCommunityTrackingStudyPhysicianSurvey.TheauthorsthankAnneBealandStephenSchoenbaumofthe\nCommonwealthFundforhelpfulcommentsonanearlierdraftandtheanonymousreviewersfortheiruseful\nsuggestions.\nNOTES\n1.

There might have been some error in physicians' reports on the percentage of their patients who were Afri-\ncan American or Hispanic, but this is not likely to have substantially affected our analysis. Patients' physi-\ncal characteristics and surnames are readily apparent to physicians, and cognitive testing of this question\nindicated that physicians had little difficulty responding. Moreover, because we categorized this variable\ninto three broad categories, any misclassification is likely to be small, and its effect would be to understate\ndifferences between low-, medium-, and high-minority practices.\n7.
