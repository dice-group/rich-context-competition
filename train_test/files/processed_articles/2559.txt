Yet, few studies have explored how\ngiving different types of support to adult offspring impact\naging parents' depressive symptoms (Liang, Krause, &\nSeveral studies have found that adults regularly\nengage in and psychologically benefit from generativity.\nGenerativity refers to a concern for establishing, guiding,\nand contributing to the welfare of future generations (An\n& Cooney, 2006) and is commonly manifested within the\nfamily through tangible support exchanges (Fingerman\net al., 2009) and transmission of values (Pratt, Norris,\nHebblethwaite, & Arnold, 2008) or outside of the fam-\nily through volunteerism and societal engagement (Son\n& Wilson, 2011). However, it is enacted, generativity has\nmany implications for health in later life. Greater percep-\ntions of generativity are associated with fewer activities\nof daily living disabilities (Gruenewald, Liao, & Seeman,\n2012). Other research shows that providing emotional sup-\nport may also act as a double-edged sword: Contributing\nto the positive emotions of others is associated with fewer\ndepressive symptoms, whereas listening to the problems and\nconflict of others is associated with an increase in depres-\nsive symptoms (Strazdins & Broom, 2007). Providing more\ntypes of support is associated with greater well-being for\nolder adults, whereas providing support to a greater num-\nber of family members was negatively associated with well-\nPrevious research has generally distinguished between\ninstrumental and emotional support (A. S. Rossi & P. H.\nVaux, 1988) as having unique functions and serving dis-\ntinct purposes. Providing emotional support predicts\ngreater self-esteem and control beliefs among elderly\nadults with comorbid health conditions (Warner, Schuz,\nWurm, Ziegelmann, & Tesch-Romer, 2010). Provision of\npractical support through volunteerism and civic engage-\nment is associated with higher quality of life for older\nadults (Wheeler, Gorey, & Greenblatt, 1998). The psy-\nchological functions of giving each type of support have\nyet to be thoroughly explored in the context of family\nexchanges (Gutierrez, Tomas, Galiana, Sancho, & Cebria,\nThe purpose of this study is to examine how giving\ndifferent types of support to adult offspring is associated\nwith the mental health of aging parents and whether per-\nceiving giving support as stressful or rewarding moderates\nthe association between giving support and depressive\nsymptoms. By examining these associations, we can bet-\nter understand possible psychological implications and\nmotivations of generativity in later life. We can also gain\na sense of how different forms of support are associated\nwith psychological well-being of older parents. By focusing\non the giver, rather than the receiver of support, this study\nadds a unique perspective to research on generativity and\nfor understanding associations between parental giving and\nmental health in late life.\nProviding Support and Mental Health\nParents are perhaps the most obvious source of support\nfor children when they are young, however as children\nmature into adults, parents remain an important support\nsystem, providing instrumental, financial, and emotional\neral patterns of support are enacted in many ways includ-\ning household chores, transportation or shopping, giving\ninformation, discussion of important life decisions, visiting\nor sharing of leisure activities, assisting with personal care,\ngiving advice, exchanging services, or providing financial\nTaken as a whole, the existing literature concerning\nfamily support exchanges demonstrates many forms of\nsupport that can be conceptualized as tangible and non-\ntangible support. Tangible support represents material,\ninstrumental, or concrete support given or received by an\nindividual. Nontangible support assesses a psychologi-\ncal and emotional form of support that is not measured\nthrough material transfers. Both forms of support remain\nimportant in our understanding of generativity and family\nsupport exchanges, however they are indeed distinct and\nexamining how these forms of support differ may prove\ninsightful to existing research.\nLiterature suggests that parents benefit psychologi-\ncally from giving different types of support to their chil-\ndren, at least in cultures that place a high value on family\nand collectivism (Cruza-Guet, Spokane, Caskie, Brown,\n& Szapocznik, 2008). For example, Chen and Silverstein\n(2000) found that among older Chinese parents, provid-\ning personal support--such as housework or babysit-\nting--to adult offspring was associated with better morale,\nwhereas providing financial assistance had no effect on par-\nent morale. In Western cultures, the experience of giving\ninstrumental or financial support may be distinct from the\nexperience of giving more nontangible, emotional types of\nsupport. In the United States, parents who provide financial\nand instrumental support to grown children may do so in\nresponse to their children's needs (Fingerman et al., 2009)\nand may experience stress and negative emotions in doing\nso. By contrast, providing emotional support may occur\nin the context of loving relationships where those giving\nsupport may feel positive emotions as a result of the sup-\nport they give to others. Thus, it is plausible that how one\nperceives the support exchange moderates the association\nbetween giving and mental health.\nThe present study sought to give insight into how aging\nparents' perceptions of giving support to an adult child\nare associated with depressive symptoms. We examined\nhow the experience of giving support as either rewarding\nor stressful moderated the potential impact that giving\ntangible and nontangible support has on depressive symp-\ntoms of older parents. Of course, in a cross-sectional study,\npatterns of association may be reversed, and people who\nare in better mental health may perceive less stress in pro-\nviding support. Nonetheless, theory suggests that providing\nthe support and conditions for providing support may have\nimplications for mental health outcomes, and we tested this\ntheory here. Further, we considered tangible and nontangi-\nble support as distinct types of support. We hypothesized\nthat parents who perceive giving support to be highly\nrewarding would report lower levels of depressive symp-\ntoms when they gave high amounts of support. Likewise,\nwe anticipated that parents who perceive giving as highly\nstressful would have higher levels of depressive symptoms\nwhen they are giving high amounts of support.\nMethods\nSample\nData were utilized from The Family Exchanges Study (FES;\nFingerman et al., 2009). FES recruited a target sample of\nat least one living adult child and at least one living parent\nin 2008. These participants were identified through phone\nlists from Genesys Corporation and random digit dialing\nfrom the Philadelphia Primary Metropolitan Statistical\nArea (PMSA) including urban, rural, and suburban areas\nin New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Participants completed\n1-hr long Computer Assisted Telephone Interviews (CATIs)\nregarding relationships with their grown offspring and liv-\ning parents. These target participants provided the names\nand contact information of their living parents.\nFrom the original sample of middle-aged adults, 280\n(44%) had parents who agreed to be interviewed. In 223\ncases, one parent was interviewed, and in 57 cases, both\nparents were interviewed, which yielded 337 dyads of\nparent and target offspring. This paper utilizes data from\nthis sample of 337 older parents. The parent sample com-\npleted CATIs similar to the interviews completed by the\ntarget child. These interviews lasted 30\nmin on average.\nParents answered questions about each of their living chil-\ndren including the target child from the original sample.\nQuestions focused on exchanges of support, beliefs about\nrelationships with children, and other demographic infor-\nmation. Table 1 shows the characteristics of the parents\ninterviewed for this study. Participant age ranged from 59\nwere female and 30.6% were male. Parents answered many\nquestions about each of their grown children, but they only\nprovided ratings of the target child for a subset of questions\nregarding rewards and stress of providing support. Thus,\nthis study focused on ties to the target child. The target\nchildren differed from other children with regard to gender\nand age; target children are more likely to include daugh-\n.001), compared to other children.\nMeasures\nSupport Given to Adult Offspring\nThe study used six items from the Intergenerational Support\nScale (ISS; Fingerman et al., 2009), which measures how\nfrequently parents report giving different types of support\nto each of their children: companionship, talking about\ndaily events, emotional support, practical support, giving\nadvice, and financial assistance. Participants rated how fre-\nquently they provided these types of support to their living\nadult children on an 8-point scale ranging from 1 (less than\nonce a year or not at all) to 8 (daily).\nFor the purposes of this study, we grouped these items\ninto two general types of support: tangible and nontan-\ngible support. As presented in Table 2, each type of sup-\nport was examined separately before being categorized as\neither nontangible or tangible support. Tangible support\nwas established by computing the mean of practical sup-\nport and financial assistance (two items), which repre-\nsents material or concrete support (i.e., fixing something\naround the house, running an errand, providing a ride,\ngiving money, loaning money, and helping to purchase\ngoods, services, insurance, or education). Nontangible\nsupport is the mean score of emotional support, com-\npanionship, talking about daily events, and advice (four\nitems), which assesses a psychological and perhaps more\nsubtle form of generativity (i.e., listening to concerns or\nbeing available when a child is upset, helping with a deci-\nsion or providing suggestions about things they could\ndo). The resulting measures of the two types of support\nTable 1.

S.\nthe support measures were 0.52 for tangible support and\nDepressive Symptoms\nWe assessed depressive symptoms of parents, using five\nitems from the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), a 53-item\nself-report scale (Derogatis & Melisaratos, 1983), which\nmeasures depressive symptoms commonly observed in eve-\nryday settings. Parents rated to what extent they felt lonely,\nblue, worthless, hopeless about the future, or had no inter-\nest in things, using a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (not at\nall) to 5 (extremely). Individual depressive symptom scores\nwere established by computing the mean score of these five\nPerceptions of Giving\nTo account for parents' perceptions of giving support, we\nincluded both a measure of stress and a measure of reward\nin our analysis. Parents rated: (a) how stressful they found\ngiving support to the target child as well as (b) how reward-\ning they found giving support to the target child. The\nanswers were rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (not\nat all) to 5 (a great deal).\nControl Variables\nWe controlled for three demographic characteristics of\nolder parents associated with mental health or support\nexchanges: age, gender, and self-rated health. Amount of\nemotional support exchanged between parents and chil-\ndren has been found to decrease with parent's chronologi-\ncal age (Keyes, 2002). We also controlled for parent gender\n(coded 1 for male and 0 for female) because previous\nresearch shows that mothers and fathers have very differ-\nent relationships with their children (Burholt & Wenger,\n1998). Because self-rated health has shown a strong associ-\nation between mental health and physical health in old age\n(Efklides, Kalaitzidou, & Chankin, 2003; Kay & Bergman,\nhealth for the past 12 months as a control variable. Self-\nrated health was rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 1\n(poor) to 5 (excellent). On average, participants rated their\nIn addition to demographic variables, we controlled for\nthe mean levels of tangible and nontangible support given\nto all children to ensure that results were not influenced by\nother relationships than the target child within the family.\nWe also chose to control for the number of children so that\nfamily size did not condition the amount of support that\na parent was able to give to the target child. Less positive\nrelations with children have been found to be related to\nlow levels of parent well-being (Ward, 2008). Also, the rela-\ntional quality between the parent and the child may affect\nhow parents provide support (Fingerman et al., 2009).\nThus, we controlled for relational quality between the par-\nent and their target child rated on a 5-point scale from 1\n(poor) to 5 (excellent) in the model.\nAnalysis Strategy\nMultilevel regression models were conducted to predict\nthe level of depressive symptoms of older parents, using\nthe PROC MIXED procedure in SAS (Littell, Milliken,\nStroup, & Wolfinger, 1996). The multilevel models take\ninto account the nested nature of the data and handle cor-\nrelated error in parents from the same families (n = 114).\nThe predictors included two types of support given to\nthe target (i.e., tangible and nontangible) and two percep-\ntions of giving support (i.e., giving is stressful and giving\nis rewarding). After centering variables, we also computed\npossible interactions between support given and perceptions\nTable 2.

We did this to examine whether viewing\nsupport as stressful or rewarding moderates the association\nbetween the support that parents give and parental depres-\nsive symptoms. We present the significant interaction terms,\ntrimming nonsignificant interaction terms. We controlled\nthree parental characteristics (i.e., age, gender, and self-\nrated health), relationship quality with adult offspring, and\nthree family characteristics (i.e., number of adult children,\ntangible support given to all children, and nontangible sup-\nport given to all children) in the analyses.\nAnalyses focused on four research aims: (a) revealing\nthe patterns of tangible and nontangible support that aging\nparents provide to their child, (b) examining how parents\nperceive giving support to the target child (as stressful or\nrewarding), (c) describing the association between giving\nsupport and depressive symptoms of older parents, and\n(d) understanding how perceptions of giving as either a\nstressful or rewarding experience influences the association\nbetween providing tangible and nontangible support and\ndepressive symptoms.\nResults\nDescriptive Statistics\nWe first examined how frequently participants provided\nsupport to their offspring and how they perceived the sup-\nport that they give to the target child (Table 2).

Other\nsignificant correlations include the correlation between\nTable 3. Correlations Among Predictor Variables\n1. Tangible support given to target --\n2. Nontangible support given to target 0.60*** --\nstress and tangible support given to the target child and all\nchildren as well as reward and relational quality with the\ntarget child.\nMultilevel Models for Depressive Symptoms\nMultilevel regression examined the association between\ngiving support and levels of parental depressive symptoms\n(Table 4). We found two significant interactions associated\nwith depressive symptoms. First, the interaction of feel-\nings of reward and giving tangible support was significant\nfor depressive symptoms (B = -0.05, p < .05). To examine\nthis interaction, we first categorized participants as feel-\ning high stress or low stress and giving high nontangible\nor low nontangible by fixing them to +1 SD and -1 SD\nfrom their mean. After categorizing parents as feeling high\nor low reward and high or low tangible support, we found\nthat parents who found giving support to be less reward-\ning showed higher levels of depressive symptoms when they\nare providing more tangible support (Figure 1). In contrast,\ngreater tangible support was associated with lower depres-\nsive symptoms among people who found support highly\nrewarding.\nSecond, we also found a significant interaction effect\nbetween stress and giving nontangible support on depres-\nsive symptoms (B = -0.05, p < .01). Parents who found\ngiving support to be highly stressful had fewer depres-\nsive symptoms when they give more nontangible support.\nHowever, parents who reported lower levels of stress had\nhigher levels of depressive symptoms when they are giving\nmore nontangible support (Figure 1).\nTwo interactions were not significant including the\ninteraction between stress and tangible support as well as\nthe interaction between reward and nontangible support.\nAmong the covariates, only self-reported health was sig-\nnificant, with better subjective health associated with fewer\ndepressive symptoms.\nDiscussion\nPerceptions of giving tangible and nontangible support\nto adult children may have psychological implications for\naging parents. Giving may increase feelings of generativity,\nwhich leads to these effects on mental well-being. Although\npast research shows that giving support declines with age\n(Keyes, 2002), our data show that parents frequently pro-\nvide both tangible and nontangible support to their grown\nchildren. Furthermore, a clear pattern of giving emerged\nfrom this sample: Parents reported providing nontangi-\nble support more frequently than tangible support. These\nresults were somewhat intuitive because tangible forms of\nsupport (e.g., financial and practical assistance) are finite,\nTable 4. Multilevel Regression Models for Parent Depressive Symptoms\nFixed effect\nSupport given to target child\nPerception on giving support to target child\nInteractions\nControls\nRandom effect\nwhereas nontangible forms of support (e.g., emotional sup-\nport and advice) are not necessarily limited by the material\nor physical resources available.\nIt is likely that the age of parents in our sample played\na role in the types of help that they are able to provide\ntheir children. For example, older parents may be on a fixed\nincome that may prevent them from providing frequent\nfinancial support to their adult children. Although we con-\ntrolled for self-reported health, other physical limitations\nmay prevent parents from providing practical assistance to\ntheir children; assisting with driving or household chores\nmay not be possible for older parents. Conversely, older\nparents possess many life experiences that contribute to\ntheir ability to give nontangible support to their grown off-\nspring. After experiencing many life events, older parents\nmay feel inclined to share knowledge and advice with oth-\ners, especially to their children.\nThe data also confirm that while parents provide differ-\nent types of support to their grown offspring, this support\nis coupled with feelings of both stress and reward, albeit\nstress levels were low on average. The negative correlation\nbetween stress and reward (Table 3) suggests that parents\nmay harbor specific attitudes pertaining to the support that\nthey give. Although participants reported higher levels of\nreward than stress, our results do in fact indicate that pro-\nviding support to adult offspring is interpreted and expe-\nrienced in unique ways in different families. Although we\nwere unable to measure levels of stress and reward for spe-\ncific types of support, our analysis indicates that perception\nof giving as a whole is a valuable consideration for inter-\ngenerational family support exchange research.\nConsistent with previous research on giving support\nto a loved one (Inagaki & Eisenberger, 2012), our results\nindicate that the provision of support may be beneficial to\nparents and may promote a sense of purpose or satisfaction\nfrom being able to continue helping one's children, in effect,\nwhat Erikson described as generativity (Erickson, 1963).\nBut giving support by itself was not sufficient. Rather, par-\nents' perceptions of giving and the type of support that they\nprovide their offspring have a significant association with\ndepressive symptom levels.

When feelings\nof reward were high, parents who gave low amounts of\ntangible support had higher levels of depressive symp-\ntoms, whereas parents who gave high amounts of tangible\nsupport had lower levels of depressive symptoms. In con-\ntrast, parents who did not view giving as highly rewarding\nreported higher levels of depressive symptoms when they\ngave high amounts of tangible support. In both of these\ncases, we see that depressive symptoms are more frequent\nwhen the level of reward (low/high) a parent feels is incon-\nsistent with the amount of tangible support that they actu-\nally give (low/high).\nWhen examining interactions between stress, nontan-\ngible support, and depressive symptoms, we see different\nresults. Parents who view giving as a highly stressful experi-\nence have the highest levels of depressive symptoms when\ngiving low amounts of nontangible support to the target\noffspring. Although giving may be a stressful experience,\nthe long-term implications for providing support seem to\npersist when a parent is giving nontangible support to their\nchild. Perhaps providing low amounts of nontangible sup-\nport indicates that there are few opportunities to make such\ncontributions to a child's life and fulfill parental duties.\nInterestingly, parents who view giving as highly stressful\nand gave high amounts of nontangible support had fewer\ndepressive symptoms. These somewhat paradoxical find-\nings are consistent with reports by Strazdins and Broom\n(2007) that giving emotional support can increase depres-\nsive symptoms, when the support is given in the context of\nproblems or conflict. It is possible that parents who find\ngiving nontangible support stressful and give high amounts\nof support are more engaged generally with their child and\nhave opportunities to address both problems and positive\nissues in their child's life, whereas parents giving a little\nsupport are drawn in only when there are problems.\nBarriers to providing tangible and nontangible support\nare plentiful; providing tangible assistance may be outside\nthe means of many elderly parents while some adult chil-\ndren may refuse or not welcome nontangible support from\ntheir elderly parents. Conversely, giving a lot of nontangi-\nble support even when it is stressful to do so is associated\nwith fewer depressive symptoms than giving a little sup-\nport. Further study is needed to determine factors that lead\nto feelings of stress in giving nontangible support and how\nthe amount and type of support given affects well-being.\nImplications and Conclusions\nThis study provides potential directions for future research\nconcerning intergenerational relationships,familial support,\nand depressive symptoms in older parents. Specifically, our\nresults indicate the potential to focus on the psychological\nperceptions of giving support. This study provides unique\ninsight into the implications of generativity; older parents\nmay provide support not only because their children benefit\nfrom receiving support, but also that it may fulfill feelings\nof parental obligation. Thus, it may be wise to consider the\nrole that parental obligation plays in future studies pertain-\ning to parental generativity.\nThese findings support the notion that social and behav-\nioral factors may improve the mental health and quality of\nlife of older adults (Glymour & Osypuk, 2012) and raise\nimportant questions concerning the role that support given\nby older adults plays outside of the family context. Results\nalso suggest that depending on their perceptions of giving,\nolder adults may benefit from making tangible or nontan-\ngible contributions to younger generations. Thus, future\nresearch concerning intergenerational support exchanges\ncould be utilized in the planning and implementation of\nhealth promotion programming for older adults. One such\nprogram, Experience Corps, has proven to be quite suc-\ncessful in improving physical and cognitive activity in older\nadults as well as educational outcomes for children (Fried\net al., 2004). A greater understanding of how intergenera-\ntional social relationships may impact mental health in late\nlife is greatly needed in order to establish health promotion\nprogramming and interventions for this population.\nSome limitations warrant comment. Limitations of\ngiving support must be taken into consideration such as\nresources available to parents and the needs of offspring.\nThese variables were not considered in the present analysis\nbut should be considered in future research. Another limi-\ntation is that our data only capture the support exchange\nrelationship between a parent and one of their adult chil-\ndren. Expanding analysis to focus on support exchanges\nbetween older parents and all of their children would reveal\ninteresting insight into within and between family differ-\nences concerning generatively. Our analyses are limited,\nin that, reports are only provided by a parent which may\nbias our results in some respect. Thus, it would be useful\nto examine both children's and parent's reports of support\nexchanges and their perspectives of giving different types\nof support. Another limitation is the low rates of depres-\nsive symptoms among the parents in our sample. Although\nthe skewed depressive symptom measure did not prove to\nbe problematic in our analysis, it would be beneficial for\nthe depressive symptoms measure to reflect a normal dis-\ntribution. These limitations should inform future research\nwith the ultimate goal of strengthening our understanding\nof intergenerational support exchanges.\nFunding\nof intergenerational transfers\" (PI: K.
