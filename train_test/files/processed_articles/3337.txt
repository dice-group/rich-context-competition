    "reduced_content": "http://sgo.sagepub.com\nAt the very beginning, I would like to clarify the theme of\nmy address, because its title may not be self-explanatory.\nThe theme is to affirm the fact that there is a place where\ncontemporary music, composed from 1945 to the present, is\nproduced, divulged, and disseminated to other places and\ncountries in Europe and outside. The group of agents and\ninstitutions that is active in this particular field of music cre-\nation represents a power device capable of pronouncing\ninclusions and exclusions in a way close to the concept of\npower theorized by Foucault (1998), especially in respect of\nnot having a subject: There is no one individual responsible\nfor the exercise of such power. There is not only a vast net-\nwork of agents, teaching institutions, and systems that is\nimportant in putting in place the acts of power but also a type\nof internalized functioning grounded in types of discourse\nthat mold, produce, and reproduce the reality they describe.\nThe topic of my article reads thus.\nThe Space of Enunciation\nof New Music\nMy central claim is that since 1945, a new subfield of cul-\ntural production of restricted circulation has been coming\ninto being and that its space of enunciation is as reduced, or\neven more reduced, in geographical terms than ever before.\nThe concept of space of enunciation has been proposed by\npostcolonial theories, mainly by scholars of non-European\norigin, such as Gayiatri Spivak, Homi K. Bhabha, Dipesh\nChakrabarty, Arjun Appadurai, and the Portuguese sociolo-\ngist Boaventura de Sousa Santos, among others. Reputed to\nbe intellectuals in their areas of third-world countries and\nrelocated as teachers at American universities, that is, having\ntheir space of enunciation in the core countries of the world\nsystem, made them question the consequences of their own\nrelocation. One of the most resonant topics is the title of an\narticle by Spivak: \"Can the Subaltern Speak?\" (Ashcroft,\nUndeniably, Portuguese music is, and always has been, a\nsubaltern musical expression in the European context that is,\nto quote two Portuguese composers who have written on this\nmatter, \"ignored, neglected, invisible, despised and dis-\nproblem of the location of culture a crucial issue.1\nFrom an analysis of the location in which contemporary\nmusic can exist--in the true sense of the word--it is probably\nmuch easier to notice the musical expressions from periph-\neral countries of Europe, such as Portugal, than those from\nthe core European countries where the absence of such musi-\ncal expressions usually goes unnoticed as if they were truly\nnonexistent.\nOthers\nIn my opinion, this is one aspect that makes this process of\nsubalternity invisible to almost everybody, including the\nscholars who write about otherness, alterity, and so on. From\nthe viewpoint of a Western scholar of the core countries, the\n\"Other\" is the African, the Asian, and the Arab. These con-\ncerns of the musicologists for Western music and its others\nhave mainly two reasons. First, musicology has recently\nfound out that \"classical music,\" in spite of its traditional\n1University of Coimbra, Portugal\n2Escola Superior de M\u00fasica de Lisboa, Portugal\nCorresponding Author:\nPortugal\nEmail: apinhovargas@sapo.pt\na Restricted Space of Enunciation\nAnt\u00f3nio PinhoVargas1,2\n Keywords\ngeoculture, geopolitics, new music after 1945, power, location of culture\n2 SAGE Open\nclaims to universality, is the product of musicians mainly of\nGermany, Italy, and France.2 Therefore, it is a specific cul-\ntural tradition and a specific musical tradition. That is why\nthe titles of traditional \"Histories of Music\" have been\nreplaced more recently by the new title, \"History of Western\nThe second reason is more important. Many articles and\njournals are now dedicated to musical expressions other than\nclassical music. Music such as jazz, pop, rock, and world\nmusic have recently entered the curricula of academia, espe-\ncially in the English-speaking countries. This is largely an\noutcome of the many changes that swept the musical world\nand, to some extent, of the presence of the Other on the hori-\nzon nearby. After the massive displacement of millions of\npeople coming from outside Europe, the space of enuncia-\ntion of many kinds of so-called ethnic musical expressions\nhas become the European metropolis. Suddenly, the music of\nthose very distant Others has become quite visible to\nEuropean musicologists on their local horizon in London,\nParis, and Berlin.\nEarlier, it was not like this. Only those who traveled long\ndistances could carry descriptions of the musical expres-\nsions. Now, they are there wherever the Other is present.\nAlthough present, the Other is still Black, Muslim, Hindu, or\nBuddhist, and all the theories of multiculturalism are an\nattempt to deal with this new situation and new presence.\nThat said, I think the most conspicuous Other by being\nabsent in the contemporary music field is the composer from\nthe European peripheral countries.\nThe New Music Space: Menger\nI shall now present my main argument, which is broadly simi-\nlar to that in the article by Menger (2003) published in Jean-\nJacques Nattiez's encyclopedia Musiques titled \"Le Public de\nla Musique Contemporaine.\" Menger begins his argument\npointing to the separation between classical music and what he\ncalls the \"creation field.\" His separation refers to the one \"in\nconcert life, between concerts with a body of works from the\nhistorical repertoire and concerts of creation of new works.\"\nHe argues that \"this historic evolution is that of a progressive\ndissociation, during the course of the 20th century, between the\nfunction of interpretation of historical works and the creation\nof new works, including their respective public spheres\"\na substance--that of the schism that opposed multiple\nlanguages of high contemporary music to the language\nin which classical repertoire was written, that is, tonal-\nity in its various aspects and stages. It has its actors, its\naudience, but also its cultural administration function-\naries and a network of public radios, which support\nand commission the production and the diffusion of\nworks that do not have a direct or immediate market.\nIt has its patrons, more active and present in the\nIn continental Europe, however, this role is assumed\nmainly by the state. Menger continues to state, \"It has its\ninstitutional chronology, that of specialized ensembles, festi-\nvals, research and production centers.\" Finally, he writes,\nthat, progressively, music creation coming from the\npostwar avant-garde currents has produced the first\nand most successful of the models of a market widely\nsupported, controlled and administered by profession-\nals of creation, fed by public organizations or musical\ninstitutions in public or private partnerships. (Menger,\nThese are the main features of what I call the subfield of\ncontemporary music. Menger considers that\nthe character of the \"population\" of small organiza-\ntions promoting contemporary music is very heteroge-\nneous; specialized associations of musicians and\ncomposers--also subsidized--ensembles working\nwithin universities or conservatories--which happen\nfrequently in the United States--but also more infor-\nmal initiatives related to other avant-garde artistic\nmilieux, as is the case in Downtown New York.\nConsidering the specific demand that exists in the new\nmusic field, Menger contends that within \"the traditional\nmarket, demand comes from ordinary consumers, while in\nthe specialized sphere of new music, there is an intermediate\ndemand\"; this demand, according to Menger, \"is formed by\ncomposers, critics, cultural administrators, editors, musi-\ncians, teachers, animateurs culturels, students, etc.\" Menger\nadvances the hypothesis of a possible synchronization\nbetween the specialization of these circles of diffusion and\nthe conditions of creative work, \"that is, the specialized char-\nacter of these circles has direct implications for the way\nFor Menger, \"the pieces are written according to the\nnorms of permanent aesthetic research, which is the priority,\nin their value judgment, for the public not in the main com-\nprising informed or traditional consumers, but professionals\nand experts of the art,\" who are finally referred to by Bourdieu\nI would like to cite here the example of Emmanuel Nunes,\nthe only Portuguese composer who can claim a presence in\nthe subfield. In an interview in 2000, regarding his living in\nParis, he reacted, \"to do what I want to do, I have to live\nwhere I live.\"3\nWhen I read his statement, I thought that it could very\nwell be the other way around; that is, the fact of living in Paris,\nas an active member of the field, recognized by his peers,\ncould, in a certain way, force him or lead him (consciously or\nunconsciously) to compose the way he composes. At least, it\nindeed creates objective conditions, concerning expectations,\nideas of style, and aesthetic assumptions that are commonly\nshared by most agents of that Parisian field, which create cer-\ntain social constraints that would be quite different had he\nlived somewhere else, say, England, China, or Portugal.\nWhere is the place of enunciation of contemporary music\nbetween 1945 and now? From that time on, a new figure, the\nemigrant composer, has emerged with the passage of time to\nachieve great visibility in the countries of the European cen-\nter, and this allows us to identify the location of that space.4\nConfining to the most relevant cases, I cite the following\nexamples: Maur\u00edcio Kagel, an Argentinian who emigrated to\nGermany in 1957, where he died this year; Iannis Xenakis, a\nGreek (Romanian-born) who emigrated to France in 1947,\nand later died there; Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti, who left Hungary for\nGermany in 1956 (through Austria), having died in Vienna in\n2006; Isang Yun, who arrived in Germany from South Korea\na resident of Germany since 1966; the Romanian Horaiu\nRdulescu, residing in France since 1969; the Bulgarian\nAndr\u00e9 Boucourechliev, residing in France since 1949; and\nAll these composers definitively put down roots in the\ncentral countries, which in fact possessed the structures asso-\nciated with the new music: the music editors with whom they\nsigned contracts, the radio stations that lent support and pub-\nlicized their music, the cultural institutions that are in a posi-\ntion to commission new works, the orchestras, the festivals,\nthe publications, and so on.\nThis wave of composers' emigration from peripheral\nareas to the countries of the center can no doubt be explained\nas due to the concentration of resources in those countries,\nthe very specialized nature of the musical currents dominat-\ning the period, and the political-cultural context of the Cold\nWar, which, in the West, gave large-scale support to artists of\nthe avant-garde against Soviet art in its \"socialist realism\"\nand antiformalist modes. Another reason could be that, as\nGeorge Steiner told us, remaining on the periphery means\nbeing doomed to the fatality of \"minor languages,\" that is, to\na certain form of nonexistence. Two other aspects are worth\nFirst, the end of Cold War made this process even more\nacute with the emigration of composers, such as Arvo P\u00e4rt\nKurt\u00e1g (1993), originally from the former Soviet Union and\nits satellite countries, to Germany, and Elena Firsova (1991)\nand Dimitri Smirnov (1991) to the United Kingdom.6\nSecond, the centrality attained by Institut de Recherche\nAcoustique Musique (IRCAM), the institution founded and\ndirected by Pierre Boulez in 1978, deemed as \"the most over-\nwhelming rescue operation of a contemporary art which a\nState has ever placed at the disposal of a composer,\" (Nattiez,\nflow of composers from other countries to Paris, for example,\nthe Finnish Magnus Lindberg and Kaija Saariaho (1982 in\nParis), the South Korean Unsuk Chin (in Germany since\nand at IRCAM in the 1990s), the Argentinian Martin Matalon,\nthe Italian Marco Stroppa, and many others. Even when con-\nsidering composers from countries, which would otherwise be\nviewed as central, such as the United Kingdom, it is important\nto note that the following composers spent repeated and\nimportant spells of time at IRCAM: Jonathan Harvey, Brian\nFerneyhough, Harrison Birswistle, George Benjamin, and the\nAmerican Tod Machover. This trend underscores the fact that\ntenure at IRCAM became almost compulsory to legitimize a\nposition of distinction in the contemporary subfield.7\nEmigration to the center amounted, from a musical point\nof view, to adopting the underlying principles of dominant\ncurrents, with particular emphasis on postserialism, a process\nthat was considered very important in the field even in our\ntime. Bhabha's postcolonial theory designates this process as\n\"mimicry\" (see Bhabha, 1994); the fascination that the\nmetropolis exerts on the emigrant plays out on the desire to be\nthe same, and thus, in this musical field, there is barely a\nglimpse of otherness. This process, ongoing among artists\nand intellectuals, has, as its literal opposite, the mass process\nof emigration from former colonies to the West. Unlike the\nindividual, cultured emigrant, motivated by the aesthetic and\nexperiential attraction exerted by the space of enunciation of\nthe musical center, the waves of population heading from for-\nmer colonies of the European powers, bring with them their\nlanguage and culture, which, rooted as they almost always are\nin oral traditions, allow the processes of miscegenation and\nhybridism with Anglo-American pop-rock, endowed with\noverwhelming global hegemony. Differently, multicultural\nissues are barely voiced in the contemporary subfield.\nThe concern of the \"travelling composer\"--to use Edward\nSaid's expression (Said, 2002)--is not to affirm difference,\nbut rather to maximize the possibility of his or her being\ninserted in the field, absorbing its techniques, cultivating its\nways, and becoming part of the preexisting mode of expres-\nsion. Despite the major political mutations between 1945\nand 2000, the travelling composer's destination remained\ncircumscribed, in Europe, almost exclusively, to two of the\ncentral countries, France and Germany.\nBased on empirical analysis of these facts, it is possible to\ndescribe the subfield of contemporary music as a given space\nof enunciation, outside which any artistic expression appears\ndoomed to its local character and, consequently, to silence\nand then to absence in transnational space.\nThe importance of identifying this specific space of enun-\nciation in contemporary music and its subfield can be\nin a European festival of a work by a travelling composer was\nnever meant to be of any interest to music, coming as it did\nfrom an \"external\" place; instead, it was considered simply as\nthe inclusion of an active agent, proximate and integrated in\nthe field, delocalized with regard to his origin, and relocalized\nin the center. More specifically, from the viewpoint of the\n4 SAGE Open\ncenter's institutions and specialist programmers, presenting a\nwork by Xenakis, Kagel, Ysang Yun, or Nunes did not mean\nany programmatic interest on the part of the organizers of\nGreek, Argentinian, South Korean, or Portuguese music. What\nit did mean was that the field, in setting itself up as universal,\nconsidering the works as works-in-themselves and the compos-\ners as individual authors, with no links to any particular con-\ntext--thus, universal--included in the subfield's hard core the\nworks by these authors as authors who were proximate to them,\nand who inhabited and shared the same space of enunciation,\nand the prevailing ideology preventing the works from being\nconsidered as anything but \"universal.\"\nIt is with regard to the space thus constituted, its working\ncriteria, and its capacity to irradiate that we must analyze the\nabsence of Portuguese music, as much as music from other\nperipheral European countries.\nKurt\u00e1g's Example\nBy way of an example, I would like to add that in 1968, a piece\nby Gy\u00f6rgy Kurt\u00e1g--\"The Sayings of Peter Bornemisza\"\nRachel Beckles Willson, that year \"an unprecedented num-\nber of ensembles from eastern Europe were in residence.\"\nAnd, she adds that \"the vocabulary of almost all nine reviewers\nreveals the difficulty they had with responding to premi\u00e8res\nfrom those peripheral regions of Europe.\" Neue Zur\n..cher\nZeitung, the Hungarian concert, was interesting from the view-\npoint of \"cultural history,\" and the Eastern bloc orchestral\nworks from the viewpoint of \"information\" (Willson, 2001).\nKurt\u00e1g's piece, in spite of \"a good word or two\" for it, pro-\nduced \"major reservations.\" Rachel W. Willson quotes, thus,\n\"the material exhausted itself,\" \"the Spring (one section of the\npiece) was unconvincing,\" and \"the piano part sounded like a\nbad imitation of Stockhausen.\" Another critic writes that \"the\npiece could not disguise its roots in the nineteenth century.\" For\nRachel Willson, Kurt\u00e1g evidently drew on the 19th century the\nwrong way, and for the students of the course, \"`The Sayings'\nLet's see what Willson writes in the New Grove 2000 edi-\nop.7, a 40-min song cycle for soprano and piano which was\nKurt\u00e1g's first vocal work since before 1956, crowned this\nfirst mature compositional phase.\" And she adds,\nThe Sayings of P\u00e9ter Bornemisza made no impact on\nDarmstadt at its world premiere there in 1968, and for the\nnext five years Kurt\u00e1g was unable to make significant\nprogress, despite a year of study in West Berlin\n(1971) supported by the Deutscher Akademischer\nAustauschdienst. (Willson, n.d.)\nIt can be said that, during this period, the pieces com-\nposed outside the core countries of Europe found it very dif-\nficult to convince the members of the field (critics, students,\nand so on) who were unable to understand their musical\nlanguage for ideological and aesthetic reasons. In this sense,\nthe reception of Kurt\u00e1g's piece says more about the field\nthan about the piece.\nthe West. According to Willson,\n[\"Messages of the Late R. V. Troussova\"] op.17 was his\nmost substantial work since op.7, and its success trig-\ngered the wider dissemination of Kurt\u00e1g's music out-\nside Hungary. It was commissioned by the French state\nand the Ensemble InterContemporain. The latter, with\nAdrianne Csengery, gave the premi\u00e8re in Paris in 1981,\nconducted by Sylvain Cambreling. (Willson, n.d.)\nMy claim is that this new piece by Kurt\u00e1g was presented\nunder three new conditions not at all related to a global pre-\nsentation of Hungarian music: First, it was performed by a\nprestigious Western ensemble; second, it was commissioned\nby the French State; third, it therefore had the powerful bless-\ning of Boulez because of which, even before the concert, it\nwas legitimized, accepted, and recognized by the structural\nfunctioning of the field.\nMy Criticism\nWhat are the most negative consequences of this centralized\nsubfield, with its extreme concentration of structures, insti-\ntutions, experts, and instruments (ensembles and musicians)\nand having a particular ideology?\n1. Once you are not accepted, or recognized by these\nagents (who are, in any case, few in number), you\nare excluded from the space of enunciation and\nfrom that specific public sphere. As a secondary\nconsequence, local composers are also neglected\nand subalternized in their own local space of enun-\nciation and in their own countries because in each\ncountry, outside the center, there are many who,\nacting as local agents of the power of the center,\nshare the same values that organize and regulate\nthe subfield.\n2. The recognized restricted area, the restricted num-\nber of agents, and the restricted number of ensem-\nbles, festivals, and so on can function as a closed\nworld divorced from the rest of the world. But the\ninstitutions, being heavily subsidized or supported\nby the State, cannot see their own insulation.\nThey are blind to the smallness of their world, blind to the\nirrelevance of the social impact of their music, and blind\neven to their own blindness.\nIn 1999, a new European institution--The R\u00e9saux Var\u00e8se--\nwas created by programmers of cultural institutions and direc-\ntors of new music festivals in several European countries. This\nincludes four institutions from French-speaking countries, one\nof which is IRCAM, and another four from German-speaking\ncountries, which together impart a position of dominance to\nthe French\u00adGerman axis. It has the objective of coordinating\nresources among the members and enabling them to articulate\nthe circulation of projects. In a way, this new institution insti-\ntutionalizes the previously described functioning.\nConclusion\nIt seems certain that the way the contemporary subfield\nfunctions, it would ultimately lead to wasting artistic and\naesthetic experiences. The restriction that presides over its\ninclusion criteria, both at aesthetic and geographical levels,\nimplies forcefully a wide range of exclusions.\nNot long ago, Ant\u00f3nio Jorge Pacheco, the artistic director\nof Porto Concert Hall, Casa da M\u00fasica, and also a new mem-\nber of the R\u00e9seaux Var\u00e8se, announced that his programming\ncriterion was based on relevance, which incidentally was\nrepeated by the majority of those responsible for cultural\ninstitutions.8 The issue to be addressed is that of knowing the\nprocedures, which, within the subfield, produce the authority\nthat permits the exercise of declaring who is relevant. It is\nprecisely on some of these procedures that this text has\nsought to cast light on.\nAuthor's Note\nThis article was originally presented at the \"Congress Sociology of\nMusic: Tendencies, Issues, Perspectives\" held in Lisbon in July\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nNotes\n1. This paper was read in the International Conference of Music\nSociology held in Lisbon in 2008, and it partially derives from\na PhD research investigation, now concluded, on the absence of\nPortuguese music in the European context. There are of course\nother peripheral countries where the same issues certainly apply.\n2. It is obvious that, especially since the 18th century, the Euro-\npean musical life has been very much centralized around the\nmost important cities of the central countries.\n3. In Espresso, 2000, Catarina Carvalho e Luciana Leiderfarb,\nLisbon, December 16.\n4. I stress here that this process is quite different from what hap-\npened before and during the Second World War, when many\nartists, intellectuals, and composers went to the United States\nescaping first from the Nazi regime and later from the war.\n5. These elements are spread through the several entries referring\nto these composers.\n7. Of course there were other centers that had identical symbolic\nimportance, especially Darmstadt during the first decades after\nthe war. However, the subtitle of Cel\u00e8stin Deliege's book in\n2000 de Damstadt \u00e0 l'IRCAM attests the real importance of the\ntwo locations but, more, draws the symbolic geocultural line\nthat defines the borders of the subfield.\nReferences\nAshcroft, B., Griffiths, G., & Tiffin, H.
