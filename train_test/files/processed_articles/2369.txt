Studies have shown that SRH is associated with\nmortality (1\u00ad3) and can sometimes be a better predictor of\ndiverse aspects of well-being than clinical factors among\nolder people (4). SRH itself is predicted by several dimen-\nsions of healthy aging--independent living, vision, hearing,\nactivities of daily living, instrumental activities of daily liv-\ning, absence of physical illness, cognition, healthy mood,\nsocial support and participation, and religious participation\nand spirituality (5). These relationships imply that SRH is a\ngood indicator of health among older adults. Therefore,\nexamination of other dimensions that influence SRH should\nhelp improve our understanding of healthy aging in human\npopulations.\nA number of social and behavioral factors are associated\nwith SRH. Advanced age, female gender, and low socioeco-\nnomic status are important risk factors for poor SRH (6\u00ad8).\nSocioeconomic status at the community level may be im-\nportant too as it has been reported that individuals living in\npoor neighborhoods in seven Dutch cities tend to have poor\nSRH (9). Health behaviors such as active physical exercise\nmay reduce the likelihood of poor SRH (10). Social vari-\nables such as social network participation and support are\nassociated with better SRH (11). A recent study demon-\nstrated that both chronic life stress and stress from a trau-\nmatic shock are strongly associated with poor SRH, and the\neffects seem to be stronger in women (12). Life stress may\naffect health outcomes in several ways, including via acti-\nvating the hypothalamic\u00adpituitary\u00adadrenal axis and sym-\npathetic nervous system, which has been associated with\nelevated risk of poor health outcomes, such as hypertension\nand heart disease, if activation is excessive or prolonged\n(13). Stress also may affect health through changes in immune\nApolipoprotein E (APOE), one of the most studied genes\nin the human population, is associated with a number of\nchronic diseases. Studies have shown that carriers of the\nAPOE4 allele have an increased risk for cardiovascular dis-\nease, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease (15\u00ad18).\nInteractions Between Life Stress Factors and Carrying the\nAPOE4 Allele Adversely Impact Self-reported Health in\nOld Adults\nYi Zeng,1,2,* Claude L.

Correlations between carrying the\nAPOE4 allele and the life stress factors were ruled out by statistical tests. These life stress factors had a substantially\nlarger adverse impact on self-reported health in APOE4 allele carriers than in noncarriers. This study provides evidence\nthat interaction between carrying APOE4 allele and chronic life stressors has significant impacts on self-reported health\nwhile controlling for various sociodemographic and health behavior factors. Further studies with richer biomarkers are\nwarranted for deeper understanding of the biological mechanisms.\nKey Words: APOE4 allele--Life stress--Genetic\u00adenvironment interactions--Self-reported health--Population aging.\nDecision Editor: Rafael de Cabo, PhD\nThe APOE4 allele is associated with a number of major\nhealth outcomes, including mortality, decline of cognitive\nfunction, decreased functional status among elderly partici-\npants without dementia (19,20), and an earlier age of onset\nof Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease (21,22). A\ntwin-based study suggested that one third of the variability\nin SRH can be attributed to genetic factors (23). Recently,\nthe APOE4 allele was found to be associated with poor\nSRH; the association was stronger in women than in men,\nafter controlling for demographic factors, socioeconomic\nstatus, and health behaviors (12). These findings suggest\nthat the APOE4 allele may play a multifaceted role in exac-\nerbating a number of disease conditions associated with\nhuman aging.\nResearch has shown that, in addition to direct genetic\ntransmission, the interactions between genetic and environ-\nmental factors also play a crucial role in health and aging\n(24); environmental factors may regulate gene expression\nvia DNA methylation and histone modification, which then\ninfluence health and longevity of the elderly participants\n(25,26). Thus, gene expressions depend on the environment\nsurrounding the organism and gene\u00adenvironment interac-\ntions. Based on intensive literature reviews and investiga-\ntions/discussions, including several workshops, the Institute\nof Medicine Committee concluded in their widely cited\nreport: \"Few diseases or conditions are caused purely by\ngenetic factors; most are the result of interactions between\ngenetic and environmental factors. Therefore, to expand our\nknowledge of how to improve the health of individuals and\npopulations, it becomes imperative to conduct research that\nexplores the effects of interactions among social, behav-\nioral, and genetic factors on health\" (25).\nGiven the growing consensus concerning the importance\nof interactions between genotypes and environmental risk\nfactors (abbreviated as \"G \u00d7 E\" hereafter), several studies\nhave indicated sizable impacts of interactions between the\nAPOE4 genotype and environmental exposures. For example,\nthe impact of a number of environmental factors on the risk\nof cardiovascular disorders and neurological disorders such\nas Parkinson's disease appears to be exacerbated in carriers\nof the APOE4 allele (27). Similarly, a study on the expected\nbenefit of physical activity in reducing risk of dementia did\nnot observe this beneficial effect in APOE4 carriers, further\ndemonstrating the potential adverse effect of the APOE4\nA number of animal studies have focused on examining\nhow stress level and APOE status interact to affect gluco-\ncorticoid levels and cognitive performance; however, only\na limited number of studies in this field have been con-\nducted in humans (29). In human studies, both stress and\nthe APOE4 allele have been associated with chronic eleva-\ntion in cortisol, which may lead to memory loss (29,30). One\nstudy found that increased life stress levels were associated\nwith more depressive symptoms in nondemented female care-\ngivers who are carriers of APOE4 allele, but this relationship\nwas not significant in noncarriers of APOE4 (31). This sug-\ngests that carriers of the APOE4 allele may respond differ-\nently to psychological stress than do noncarriers of the\nAPOE4 allele. Although suggesting that there might be a\ntheoretical basis for important interactions between life\nstress factors and APOE4 status, these studies were based\non small sample sizes of less than 100 participants, and poten-\ntial confounders such as sociodemographic and behavioral\nfactors were not controlled for (29\u00ad31).\nOur careful literature review has indicated that, although\nmuch prior research have discovered the association be-\ntweenAPOE4 and health outcome including SRH as well as\nthe association between environmental factors and SRH,\nfew studies have investigated the effects of the interactions\nbetween carrying the APOE4 allele and the environmental\nrisk factors on SRH in general; more specifically, in our lit-\nerature search, we could locate no population-based studies\nwith large sample sizes adequate for genetic analysis that\nhave been conducted to examine the interaction between\nAPOE4 status and life stress on SRH or other health condi-\ntions in older adults. Our present study fills this research\ngap. Because SRH is believed to be a summary indicator of\ndifferent dimensions of healthy aging and based on the the-\noretical foundation that both APOE4 and prolonged stress\nare associated with poor health outcomes, we hypothesize\nthat interactions between APOE4 status and life stress\nfactors may significantly increase the odds of self-reported\npoor heath; namely, the negative effects of life stress on\nSRH may be substantially more serious in APOE4 carriers\nthan in noncarriers.We have tested this hypothesis via multiple\nrandom-effect logistic regression analysis of data collected\nfrom a population-based study of older adults in Taiwan\nwhile controlling for demographic, socioeconomic, and\nhealth behavior factors.\nData Source, Measurements, and Methods\nData Source and Study Participants\nThe study participants were adults 55 years of age or\nolder from the Social Environment and Biomarkers of\nAging Study conducted in 2000, which was based on a ran-\ndom subsample of respondents to the longitudinal Survey of\nHealth and Living Status in Taiwan. Social Environment\nand Biomarkers of Aging Study randomly selected a total\nHealth and Living Status (4). Of the 1,713 selected Survey\nparticipated in the Social Environment and Biomarkers of\nAging Study interviews. Of the respondents who were inter-\nparticipated in the physical examination and biospecimen\nEach face-to-face in-home interview was conducted by a\nlocal public health nurse. On a scheduled day several weeks\nafter the interview, participants collected a urine sample\nafter fasting 12 hours overnight and had a medical exam the\nnext morning at a nearby hospital, where medical personnel\ndrew a blood specimen and anthropometric measurements\nfrom the participants (32).\nMeasurements\nThe health outcome measure was SRH, which was origi-\nnally measured on a 5-point scale: excellent, good, average,\nrespectively, in this study sample). For multiple regression\nanalysis, a binary SRH score was recoded as 1 if an individual\nrated his or her health as not so good or poor and 0 if excellent,\ngood, or average. Because we mainly focused on examining\nthe interaction of APOE4 and life stress factors, we classi-\nfied APOE4 genotype into a binary variable (APOE4 carrier\nstatus) following the dominant model. Individuals who\ncarry one or two copies of the minor allele of APOE4 are\ncoded as \"1\" (carrier), and the individuals who do not carry\nthe minor allele are coded as \"0\" (noncarrier).\nAs discussed in the literature, life stress can be measured\nby perceived stress, economic difficulties, security, and\nsafety, and it has been associated with physiological dys-\nregulation in older adults (33,34). In this study, we use the\nvariable of six or more persons living in the household and\ndifficulty meeting monthly living expenses to indicated\nchronic living environment and financial stress. Experienc-\ning housing damage during the 1999 earthquake is used to\nmeasure life stress due to a traumatic event. We also used\nanother variable as an indicator of life stress: mainlander\npeople who were forced to leave the Mainland of China for\nAlmost all of them have been isolated from the rest of their\nfamily of origin and hometowns throughout their life up to\n2000 when the survey was conducted. (The forced reloca-\ntion of about one million military force and governmental\nofficers of the Kuomingtang party from the Mainland to\nthe mainlander participants aged 55 years and older were\nforced to come to Taiwan either as an adult or as a child\nwith parents and totally isolated from the rest of their family\nmembers and hometowns throughout their life up to 2000.\nThe exchanges and communications between Taiwan and\nthe Mainland only became increasingly available after 2000\n[and accelerated in most recent years].) As a result, they\nand their family members may have suffered from chronic\nlife stress.\nControl variables included in the analyses were health\nbehaviors and sociodemographic factors. Health behaviors\nincluded diet, alcohol use, smoking, and exercise. Socio\ndemographic factors included age, gender, marital status,\nurban or rural residence, education, and occupation. Obesity,\ndefined as body mass index greater than 30 weight/height\n(kg/m2), was included to measure physical condition. Table 1\nTable 1. Sample Distribution (%) of Sociodemographic Characteristics\nof the Participants\nVariable Categories\nTotal Men Women\nObesity % obese (body mass\nshows the distributions of sociodemographics by gender.\nThere were remarkable differences in age, ethnicity, educa-\ntion, and occupation between men and women. The non-\nmainlander Fujianese and Hakka people (Both Fujianese\nand Hakka people are the native Taiwanese.) account for\n71% and 12% of the total sample, respectively, whereas\nmainland people account for 17%.\nAPOE was genotyped using the polymerase chain reaction\namplification refractory mutation system (PCR_ARMS) and\npolymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length poly-\nmorphism (PCR_RFLP) analysis. The chi-square test was\nperformed to test Hardy\u00adWeinberg equilibrium in the APOE\ngene so that one could assess potential genotyping error and\nthe appropriateness of sample selection (32).\nStatistical Analysis\nBecause the Social Environment and Biomarkers of Aging\nStudy survey design involved multistage cluster sampling,\nindividuals within the same cluster may be correlated statis-\ntically because they share some unobserved heterogeneity.\nStatistically, ignoring this type of correlation may lead\nto overestimates of standard errors of the parameters.\nTherefore, multiple random-effect logistic regression was\nperformed to correct for the intra-cluster correlation by\nincluding random effects into the model.\nNote that statistically significant estimates of interaction\nterms derived from the multiple random-effect logistic\nregression analysis represent significant synergistic effects\nof the genetic\u00adenvironment interactions. The synergistic\neffects may not exactly reflect the interaction effects of G \u00d7 E\nas the estimates may or may not be confounded by gene\u00ad\nenvironment correlations (abbreviated as \"rGE\" hereafter).\nThe rGE refers to the idea that certain genotypes have causal\neffects on environmental risk factors and influence health\noutcomes indirectly through these pathways; in other words,\ngenes influence people's tendencies to create their own en-\nvironments (35,36). Thus, we need to do additional analysis\nto detect whether rGE exists. For all significant estimates of\nG \u00d7 E interaction terms with a continuous environmental\nvariable, we use the analysis of variance model and the\nmultiple regression model (adjusting for the confounders)\nto test whether there are significant differences in the con-\ntinuous environmental factors between the carriers and non-\ncarriers of theAPOE4 genotype. For all significant estimates\nof G \u00d7 E interaction terms with a discrete environmental\nvariable, we use the chi-squared test and the multiple re-\ngression model (adjusting for the confounders) to assess\nwhether there are significant differences in the environmental\ncategories between the carriers and noncarriers of the APOE4\ngenotype. For all significant rGE detected by analysis of\nvariance or chi-square test and the multiple regression anal-\nysis (Note that if the chi-squared test or the analysis of var-\niance F test [both are not adjusted for any covariates] shows\na significant difference in the frequency or the mean of the\nenvironmental factor, we need to further perform the multi-\nple regression analysis because the difference may be due to\nFigure 1.

Based on the path analysis,\nwe may estimate the direct genetic effect (pGH in Figure 1)\nand the genetic\u00adenvironment interaction effects (G \u00d7 E in\nFigure 1) on the health outcome; we may also decompose\nthe total effects of the environmental exposure on the health\noutcome (pEH in Figure 1) into two components: (a) the\ngenetic factor's indirect effects that work through its\nimpacts on environmental exposure and (b) the effects\nsolely caused by the environmental exposure (37\u00ad39)--see\nFigure 1 for the theoretical framework of analysis to explore\nthe gene\u00adenvironmental interactions (G \u00d7 E) and correla-\ntions (rGE).\nAll analyses were performed using STATA statistical\nResults\nTable 2 provides the distribution of prevalence of poor\nSRH by a number of life stress factors. Overall, there was\nlittle difference in prevalence of poor SRH by ethnicity.\nAmong APOE4 carriers, mainlander people reported poor\nand Hakka (18.75%). However, this ethnic pattern was\nnot observed in APOE4 noncarriers. Individuals who lived\nin a crowded household with six or more persons, had\nmonthly financial difficulties, or whose house was dam-\naged during the 1999 earthquake (which occurred 1 year\nbefore the interview) were more likely to have poor SRH.\nThis was consistent among APOE4 carrier and noncarrier\ngroups.

ORs for\nthe interaction between APOE4 and relocated mainlander\nand between APOE4 and monthly financial difficulty (OR =\n2.57; p = .011) are statistically significant; estimates of the\nother interaction terms are not statistically significant.\nTable 5 presents the estimates of the chi-squared test\nto assess the genotype frequency difference across the cate-\ngories of the life stress factors of which presented statisti-\ncally significant interactions with APOE4 carrier status in\nTable 4 (relocated mainlander, living in a household of six\nor more persons, living in earthquake-damaged house, and\nmonthly financial difficulty). Clearly, the possibility of rGE\ncorrelation confounding G \u00d7 E interaction effects is ruled\nout based on the nonsignificant estimates of chi-square tests\n(see Table 5). Thus, there is no need to do any further path\nanalysis to separate the confounding rGE correlation from\nthe G \u00d7 E interaction. The estimates presented in Tables 4\nand 5 suggest that the interactions between APOE4 carrier\nstatus and one of these four life stress factors (being a relo-\ncated mainlander, living with six or more persons, living\nin earthquake-damaged house, and monthly financial diffi-\nculty) significantly increase the likelihood of self-reporting\npoor health.\nThe gene\u00adenvironment interaction (G \u00d7 E) is conventionally\ndefined as ``a different effect of an environmental exposure\nTable 3 presents APOE carrier status frequency by age\ngroup and gender.

As shown in Table 6,\namong the noncarriers of APOE4 minor allele, being a relo-\ncated mainlander, living in a crowded household with six or\nmore persons, living in an earthquake-damaged house, and\nhaving monthly financial difficulty increased the risk of\nHowever, these four life stress factors dramatically increased\nrespectively, among carriers of the APOE4 minor allele.\nClearly, the negative impacts of the life stress factors are\nmuch stronger among the APOE4 allele carriers than that\namong the noncarriers.\nDiscussion\nAlthough previous studies have indicated that both the\nAPOE4 allele and the life stress may negatively affect\nhealth outcomes (42), there has been little research examin-\ning the effects of interactions between APOE4 and life\nstress factors on SRH. Remarkably, our study shows that\nthe interactions between carrying the APOE4 allele and a\nnumber of life stress factors (being a relocated mainlander,\nliving with six or more persons in the household, incurring\n1999 earthquake damage to one's home, and suffering\nmonthly financial difficulty) have significant effects on self-\nreported poor health. We also provide important evidence\nthat these life stress factors have substantially more serious\nadverse impacts on SRH in carriers of the APOE4 allele\nthan in noncarriers.\nLife stress can affect health outcomes in several ways;\none pathway is through the hypothalamic\u00adpituitary\u00adadrenal\naxis and sympathetic nervous system activity. Chronic\nstress can cause activation of the hypothalamic\u00adpituitary\u00ad\nadrenal axis and sympathetic nervous system, which has\nbeen associated with elevated risk of poor health outcomes\nsuch as hypertension and heart disease if activation is exces-\nsive or prolonged (43). Stress also may affect cognitive\nfunction through changes in immune function (44).\nA recent study (with less than 100 participants) found a\nsignificant interaction between carrying the APOE4 allele\nand life stress on an elevated level of cortisol, which may\nlead to memory loss, cognitive decline, and possibly other\npoor health outcomes in humans (27). Although the mecha-\nnisms indicating the pathways through which APOE4 and\nlife stress interact to affect health outcomes in humans are\nnot yet clear, animal model studies have shown that APOE\nin mice may cause an age-dependent increase in adrenal\ncorticosterone content at baseline and abnormally increased\nplasma corticosterone levels after restraint stress. This may\nsuggest a key role for APOE in the tonic inhibition of\nsteroidogenesis and adrenal cortical activity (45). Research\nalso shows that exposure to life stress factors may be in-\nvolved in early development of neurodegeneration in mice\nwith APOE4 (46). These previous studies may provide pos-\nsible elicitation on biological explanations for the findings\nreported in this article--the interaction between life stress\nfactors and the APOE4 allele may elevate level of cortisol\nand cause memory loss, which adversely affect SRH in old\nadults. Our findings may have important implications for\npublic health. By reducing stressful life events or teaching\ncoping skills to APOE4 carriers, we may be able to reduce\nthe risk of poor SRH. Completion of the Human Genome\nProject and HapMap Project have provided important tools\nTable 6.

The estimates of OR10, OR01, OR11, and RERI are parts of the multiple random-effect logistic regression output produced by STATA.\nfor the genetic study of complex human disorders (45).\nMeanwhile, advances in molecular technology over the past\ndecade have led to more genetic research on risk factors\nassociated with health conditions or diseases related to\nhuman aging. Therefore, studying gene\u00adenvironment inter-\nactions may allow us to take an active role in lowering the\nrisk of disease and poor health by targeting interventions\nbased on genetic characteristics and environmental factors.\nWe are also aware of the important limitations in present\nstudy, such as the not-large-enough total sample size (N =\nand only 52 and 40 oldest old male and female participants\naged 80+ years). The very small subsample size of the old-\nest old has resulted in that the proportion of APOE4 carriers\nages 80+ years for women. Concentration of the limited\nsample on young\u00adold aged 55\u00ad79 years also prevented us\nfrom employing cortisol or cognitive function as a health\nindicator. Clearly, more in-depth research, with larger sam-\nples including more oldest old, more expansive biomarker\ncollection, and more detailed analyses, is warranted to re-\nconfirm these findings and to provide deeper understanding\nof the underlying biological mechanisms.\nFunding\nThis research was partially supported by the Research Triangle Institute\nProfessional Development Fund awarded to F.Z. and by National Institute\nConflict of Interest\nThe authors have declared that no competing interests exist.\n"
