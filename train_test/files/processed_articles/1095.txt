The beneficial effects of\nphysical activity, summarized in the first US Surgeon\nGeneral's report on physical activity and health (1), are\nevident across the entire life span, including older popula-\ntions, and apply to a variety of important aging-related health\noutcomes, such as mortality (1\u00ad5), disability (3, 6\u00ad8), and\nhealth care expenditures (9). However, there is a growing\nrecognition that a much broader spectrum of activity than\njust physical or fitness activity may provide significant\nhealth benefits. This finding may have particular relevance\nfor older adults, for whom participation in vigorous fitness\nactivities may be constrained or potentially hazardous\nbecause of underlying health problems (10).\nRecent studies suggest that participation in leisure activi-\nties unrelated to fitness increases survival and has other posi-\ntive health effects for older adults (11\u00ad18). Some of these\nstudies have focused on social and productive activity, the\nlatter usually being defined as activity that represents an\nintrinsic economic value, such as paid employment, volun-\nteer work, or gardening. For example, social and productive\nactivity has been associated with a reduced mortality risk\ndementia (12, 15, 18).

It is thought to arise from\nthe cumulative damage of the chronic disease processes that\naffect humans throughout life and that become manifest in\nThere have been few systematic studies to date of the rela-\ntion between social and productive activity and disability.\nOne study found a significant cross-sectional association\nbetween social activities and disability in a relatively small\nsample (22). Another study reported a prospective associa-\ntion between social activity and disability, but this finding\nwas limited to church attendance (23). In this paper, we test\nthe degree to which participation in social and productive\nactivity, which we refer to as social engagement, is associ-\nated with a reduced risk of disability in a community-based\npopulation of adults aged 65 years or older.\nStudy population\nData for this analysis were collected from the New Haven,\nConnecticut, site of the Established Populations for Epide-\nmiologic Studies of the Elderly (EPESE) study, one of four\nsites funded by the US National Institute on Aging and the\nonly one with detailed information on social activity. Details\nof the New Haven EPESE study design have been described\npreviously (24). Briefly, to generate a representative sample\nof the noninstitutionalized New Haven population aged 65\nyears or older, a two-stage, stratified probability sample was\nobtained covering three housing strata: public housing for\nthe elderly (age and income restricted), private housing for\nthe elderly (age restricted), and general community housing.\nThe rate at which respondents were drawn into the sample\nvaried by housing stratum and included an oversampling of\nmen. The response rate for the combined strata was 82\npercent. The baseline sample consisted of 1,169 men and\nData collection and measures\nBaseline data collection took place during face-to-face\ninterviews conducted in 1982 and included questions on\nsociodemographic, psychosocial, and health-related charac-\nteristics. Follow-up assessment consisted of in-home inter-\ninterview, yielding a total of nine waves of data. Disability\nstatus was ascertained at each yearly interview, while ques-\ntions on social engagement were included in face-to-face\ninterviews only.\nSocial engagement. Social engagement was measured by\nasking a series of questions during the baseline interview on\nfrequency of participation in social and productive activity.\nThese questions were designed not to refer to some under-\nlying \"latent\" construct of social engagement but rather to\nprovide a broad characterization of the types of activities\ncommon among older persons. Hence, there were no a priori\nassumptions about the intercorrelations between the items.\nInformation on 11 types of social or productive activities\nwas included. Eight items (visits to theaters, sporting events;\nshopping; gardening; meal preparation; card, game playing;\nday or overnight trips; paid community work; and unpaid\ncommunity work) were rated according to frequency of\nparticipation (0, never; 1, sometimes; 2, often). Church\nattendance was rated on a six-point frequency scale (from\nnever/almost never to more than once a week), which was\nrecoded into three categories comparable to the other eight\nactivity items. Questions about participation in groups and\npaid employment were asked in a yes/no format. Participa-\ntion in groups was recoded to a value of 1, whereas paid\nemployment was recoded to a value of 2. A summary\nmeasure of social engagement was derived by summing the\nresponses across the items. Total social engagement scores\nwere set to missing if responses were missing for more than\nthree items (n = 51, 2 percent); otherwise, missing responses\nwere recoded as 0 (no participation) for that activity. The\nbaseline interview also included three questions on fitness\nactivity (active sports or swimming, walking, physical exer-\ncise), which were coded in the same way as the other activity\nitems. Higher scores on the social engagement and fitness\nactivity measures represented higher levels of activity, and\neach measure was centered at the mean for use in the longi-\ntudinal analysis.\nDisability status.   study included\nthree self-reported measures of disability representing sepa-\nrate, but complementary aspects of disability. The first\nfocused on the ability to perform essential self-care tasks\n(e.g., bathing, dressing, eating) and was derived from the\nKatz activities of daily living (ADL) scale (25). Consistent\nwith previous studies (26\u00ad28), task-specific disability was\ndefined as a self- or proxy report of presently needing help\nfrom a person, needing special equipment or a device, or\nbeing unable to perform the activity. A summary score was\ncomputed by adding the number of tasks a person was able\nto perform without help (range, 0\u00ad6). The second measure\nfocused on tasks requiring a certain degree of strength and\nbasic mobility, derived from the Rosow-Breslau Functional\nHealth Scale measure (29). The three items assessed the\nability (without help) to do heavy work around the house, to\nwalk up and down the stairs, and to walk half a mile (1 mile =\n1.61 km). A summary score was formed by adding the three\nitems (range, 0\u00ad3). The third measure evaluated basic upper-\nand lower-extremity function and was based on the work by\nNagi (30). It determined the degree of difficulty in pulling or\npushing large objects, stooping, crouching, or kneeling;\nreaching or extending the arms above shoulder level, and\nwriting or handling small objects. Responses indicating no\nor little difficulty were added across items to create a\nsummary score (range, 0\u00ad4). Disability questions were\nincluded in each yearly interview, yielding a maximum of\nnine waves of disability data per subject.\nCovariates. In addition to age (in years) and gender, we\nselected three sets of covariates that are known to be related\nto disability outcomes and might influence the association of\nsocial engagement with disability. The first set consists of\nindicators of socioeconomic status, represented by measures\nof education and income. The second set includes measures\nSocial Engagement and Change in Disability 635\nof health and the third set a measure of the overall number\nand extent of social relationships.\nEducation was measured in number of years completed.\nIncome was categorized into two dummy variables\nmiddle income). To retain subjects who failed to report\nincome (13 percent), a separate dummy variable was created\nfor missing values. The high income level ($10,000/year)\nserved as the referent group. In the analysis, adjustment for\nincome meant including all three dummy variables in the\nmodel.\nHealth measures included information on relative weight\nand chronic conditions. Relative weight was assessed by\ndetermining body mass index and was then divided into\napproximate tertiles to create dummy variables for low (<23\nincome, a dummy variable for missing body mass index\nvalues was created to permit inclusion of subjects for whom\nvalues were missing (6 percent). Prevalent chronic condi-\ntions were ascertained by using self-reported information on\nseven physician-diagnosed medical conditions: myocardial\ninfarction, high blood pressure, stroke, cancer, diabetes, hip\nfracture, and arthritis. A summary measure was created by\nadding the number of self-reported conditions. Cognitive\nhealth status was assessed by using the 10-item Short\nPortable Mental Status Questionnaire (31). To examine the\ninfluence of poor cognition on the results, analyses were\nrepeated after excluding subjects whose performance on this\nquestionnaire was poor, conventionally defined as three or\nmore incorrect responses (32).\nSocial networks were measured with a composite index by\nusing information on the number of social ties that included\nvisual and nonvisual contact and the proximity of four\ngroups of ties: children, relatives, friends, and confidants. A\ntotal social network score was constructed by summing the\nscores for each of the tie-specific measures. Additional\ndetails of this measure have been described previously (33),\nand this measure has been found to be associated with\ndisability transitions in the same cohort (28). Race was self-\nreported and was coded as Black or non-Black (<1 percent of\nsubjects reported another racial/ethnic identity).\nStatistical analysis. Generalized linear modeling was\nused to fit the nine yearly waves of disability data. Because\nof their skewed distributions, each disability outcome was\nmodeled by using a logistic link function, and a binomial\nerror structure was specified. To express each outcome as a\nproportion, we recoded the disability variables by dividing\nthe number of items a subject was able to perform by the\ntotal number of items. The regression coefficients of the\npredictor variables in these models represent the linear effect\non the log odds of the proportion of tasks a subject is able to\nperform on each measure. A generalized estimating equa-\ntions approach was used to account for the correlated struc-\nture of disability data within sampling clusters (24) as well\nas within subjects across repeated measurements (34).\nA series of models was fitted to test the cross-sectional and\nlongitudinal effects of social engagement on disability. To\nthat end, the sequential disability data were modeled as a\nfunction of baseline age, gender, and race, representing the\ncross-sectional association of these variables with disability.\nLongitudinal effects were represented by follow-up time (in\nyears since baseline) itself as well as the interactions\nbetween follow-up time and age, follow-up time and gender,\nand follow-up time and race. Separate models were\nconstructed for each disability outcome. We then tested the\nmain or \"cross-sectional\" effect of social engagement on\ndisability by adding baseline social engagement to these\nmodels. The cross-sectional effect represents the degree to\nwhich social engagement is associated with level of\ndisability, averaged across all yearly follow-up interviews.\nWe also included fitness activity in each model to adjust for\nthe effect of this variable. In the second series of models, we\nadded a term for the interaction between social engagement\nand follow-up time to test the longitudinal effect of social\nengagement on disability. In these models, the main (or\ncross-sectional) effect represents the baseline association of\nsocial engagement with disability, whereas the longitudinal\neffect represents the degree to which the effect of baseline\nsocial engagement changes during follow-up.\nSets of covariates representing socioeconomic status,\nhealth status, and social networks were added to these\nmodels one at a time to examine the influence of these vari-\nables on the association of social engagement with disability.\nAn additional model was fitted that was restricted to those\nsubjects without significant cognitive impairment at base-\nline. Finally, to test the influence of mortality on the esti-\nmated relation between social engagement and disability, a\nseparate model was fitted for those who survived the entire\nfollow-up period. Only baseline information was used for\neach of the predictor variables, including social engagement.\nAll results were based on weighted analysis, unless other-\nwise specified. All longitudinal analyses were performed by\nusing Statistical Analysis Software (SAS), version 8 (35).\nRESULTS\nDescriptive details of the New Haven EPESE sample have\nbeen published previously (24, 36). Briefly, the cohort was\non average age 74.0 years at baseline, 64 percent female, and\n16 percent Black. The social engagement measure had a\nmean (unweighted) of 7.1 (3.2). Table 1 shows that social\nengagement decreased with age and was higher among\nfemales, non-Blacks, and those with more years of schooling\nand higher income. In addition, older adults with a moderate\nbody mass index, fewer than two chronic conditions, no\nimpaired cognition, and higher levels of physical activity\nhad higher levels of social engagement.\nbaseline and final (1990) follow-up interviews. Participation\nrates at each yearly follow-up interview ranged from 90.5\npercent to 97.3 percent of those remaining alive. Table 2\nshows the results of the primary analysis. Subjects were\nomitted from the main analysis if information on social\nengagement was missing at baseline (n = 51) or fewer than\ntwo waves of disability data were available, which was\nmostly due to mortality during the first year of follow-up.\nFor all three disability measures, disability was significantly\nassociated with each year over age 65 years at baseline,\nbeing female, being Black, and reporting less fitness activity\n(negative coefficients indicated more disability). The longi-\ntudinal effects indicated a significant increase in disability\nover time and that this increase was greater for each addi-\ntional year of age at baseline. Women and Blacks generally\ndid not show significant differential increases or decreases in\ndisability over time.\nSocial engagement was associated with a significant, posi-\ntive, cross-sectional effect on each disability measure\n(models 1, table 2). The coefficients represented the average\ndifference in disability across all yearly follow-up interviews\nper unit difference in the social engagement measure. The\nsecond series of models indicated that social engagement\nwas associated with a significant positive effect at baseline\nbut with a significant negative, longitudinal effect, as indi-\ncated by the interaction effects with follow-up time (models\n2, table 2). This finding indicates that the protective effect of\nsocial engagement decreased over time. However, it is worth\nnoting that the magnitude of the longitudinal effects was\nsmall compared with the baseline effects. For example,\ncompletely eliminate the initial (baseline) advantage in ADL\nfunction due to social engagement. Convergence in\nBreslau (29) and Nagi (30) measures, respectively.\nThe generalized estimating equations coefficients (table 2)\nrepresent the effect on the ratio of the number of items or\ntasks a person is able to perform to the number that he or she\nis unable to perform, expressed on a log scale. Hence, the\ncoefficients lack a direct linear interpretation, especially at\nthe extremes of each disability measure. To graphically illus-\ntrate the longitudinal effect of social engagement on\ndisability, we computed predicted disability scores, based on\nthe second series of models, at the 25th and 75th percentiles\nof the social engagement measure. Graphs were plotted for a\nBlack female and a White male, both aged 70 years (figure\n1). Disability levels at baseline, that is, at age 70 years, were\nmarkedly higher (lower scores) for those whose levels of\nsocial engagement were lower, but differences remained\nfairly stable during follow-up. In this figure, the almost-\nparallel curves of decline for each group reflect the finding\nthat the negative interaction between social engagement and\nfollow-up time was small relative to the main effect. In fact,\ndisability differences between high and low social engage-\nment tended to increase slightly for ADL disability, the\nmeasure for which the predicted scores were closest to the\nupper limit (ceiling). Differences in predicted disability\nlevels for a White male and a Black female aged 70 years are\na combination of both the gender and race effects.\nA secondary series of analyses was aimed at testing the\nrobustness of these findings across subgroups of particular\ninterest, including gender and race. The effect of social\nengagement was not found to differ among these subgroups\n(all p's > 0.20). Other models were fitted to examine the\ninfluence of a series of potential confounders. To compare\nthe results across models, we refitted the primary models\npresented in table 2 (models 2) for the subset of subjects for\nwhom covariate data were complete. Therefore, the first\n\"primary\" model was the same as those presented in table 2,\nexcept for the change in sample size. Results indicated that\nthe estimated baseline and longitudinal effects of social\nengagement remained essentially unchanged after adjust-\nment for indicators of socioeconomic status or for social\nnetworks (table 3). Controlling for health-related variables\nresulted in a decrease of about 10\u00ad15 percent in the baseline\neffects of social engagement but did not change the longitu-\nTABLE 1.

Similarly small reductions in estimated coeffi-\ncients were found when we limited the analyses to those\nsubjects without cognitive impairment at baseline or to those\nsurviving the entire follow-up period. This finding suggests\nthat neither cognitive impairment nor selective survival\nsubstantially influenced the association of social engage-\nment with disability.\nDISCUSSION\nIncreasing evidence suggests that the degree to which\nolder people are engaged in their social environment is asso-\nciated with a clear survival benefit, whether this engagement\nis defined by specific social or productive activities (13, 14,\n19) or by the nature and quality of their social relationships\n(37\u00ad41). However, the exact mechanisms by which this\nsurvival benefit is achieved remain mostly unclear. This\ninvestigation focused on the impact of social engagement on\ndisability, a common endpoint of various age-related chronic\ndisease processes associated with reduced survival (42).\nOur findings revealed a strong and robust cross-sectional\nassociation between social engagement and disability. When\nthe data were averaged across all years of observation, more\nsocially active persons reported considerably lower levels of\ndisability than their counterparts. The association was\nconsistent across gender and race and across all three\nmeasures of disability, suggesting that social engagement\naffects a relatively broad spectrum of this process. The\nresults also indicate that the protective effect of social\nengagement diminishes slowly over time, suggesting that\nsocial engagement is not necessarily associated with a\nslower rate of functional decline. However, the differential\nchanges in effects were very small relative to the substantial\nprotective effect at baseline for the more socially active,\nyielding a pattern of mostly constant disability differences\nduring follow-up. In fact, predicted ADL scores suggested a\nslight increase in absolute differences in ADL disability\nbetween the more and less socially active.\nThe lack of a clearer positive longitudinal effect may in\npart have been due to the ordinal scaling of the disability\nmeasures, which may have limited their ability to adequately\ncapture progression of disability over time. For example,\nlongitudinal effect estimates may be biased to the degree that\ndifferences between individual scores at higher levels of\neach measure represent smaller gradations in underlying\ndisability than equivalent differences at lower levels. Some\nevidence exists that specific task difficulties, or the patterns\nin which subjects become disabled, do not follow strictly\nlinear patterns. Losses at lower levels of functional status,\ncompared with higher levels, may indicate greater progres-\nsion of disability (43, 44). However, we know of no\nuniformly accepted methods for either rescaling disability\nmeasures or differentially weighting individual items\nTABLE 2.

An important issue is the temporal order of the\nassociation. One consideration is that social engagement\nmay be as much a consequence of disability as it is a cause.\nHowever, in a separate analysis, disability at baseline had\nonly a weak and nonsignificant effect on changes in social\nengagement (data not shown). This finding raises the possi-\nbility that the association between social engagement and\ndisability is more complex than a unidirectional causal effect\none way or the other. For example, the findings may be\nconsistent with a pattern of reciprocal causation, similar to\nwhat has been observed in other studies of psychosocial\nfactors and change in disability (45). Reciprocal causation\ncould arise from a process of multiple system deactivation;\nthat is, losses in physical function and self-care capacities\nlead to reduced social engagement, which in turn accelerates\nfunctional decline (also known as \"use it or lose it\"). This\ntheme is common in the gerontologic literature, described as\nchanges in everyday competence and adaptation that follow\na dynamic and recursive process in interaction with age-\nrelated declines in physical or cognitive function (45\u00ad49).\nAlthough social engagement may enable older persons to\nhelp maintain their functional abilities, our data do not\nprovide clear evidence that it leads to a significant slowing of\nthe disability process itself. The fact that this process is\ndriven mostly by the progression and acute clinical manifes-\ntation of age-related chronic conditions suggests that social\nengagement may not be directly involved in these disease\nprocesses. In fact, little evidence to date suggests that social\nengagement or related psychosocial factors play a significant\netiologic role in common, age-related chronic diseases (50,\n51). Instead, it may be more likely that social engagement is\nrelated to the ability to modify the functional consequences\nFIGURE 1.

Social engagement, or more generally the\nextent to which persons are meaningfully involved in their\nsocial environment, may provide a sense of purpose and a\nsense of control over one's life and efficacy in one's abilities\n(46, 52\u00ad54). A greater sense of control and self-efficacy, in\nturn, has been shown to enable older persons to attenuate the\nimpact of declining physical health on everyday function and\ndisability (55\u00ad57). In other words, social engagement may\npromote or reinforce the personal resources that enhance\nresilience in the face of disease processes that become more\nsevere over time. The exact mechanisms involved in this\nprocess remain poorly understood but likely consist of a\ncombination of psychosocial and physiologic pathways that\nrequire further study.\nOur study may have several weaknesses. For example, we\nrelied on ad hoc measures of social engagement, assembled\nfrom items designed to cover a broad array of activities that\nolder adults commonly engage in. Confirmation of these\nfindings with better validated measures of social engage-\nment will be necessary. Another issue is that some aspects of\nsocial engagement may be conceptually related to functional\nabilities, leading to potential measurement confounding.\nSome of the items in our social engagement measure (e.g.,\nshopping, preparing meals) may be particularly vulnerable to\noverlap with measures of instrumental ADL, but this\nmeasure of disability was not used in the present analysis.\nThere was no content overlap with any of the items related to\nthe three disability measures used in our study. In addition,\ndisability is commonly defined in terms of the ability to\ncomplete self-care tasks and other basic functions, whereas\nsocial engagement is defined as actual participation in\nactivity. Nevertheless, the exact boundaries between lack of\nsocial engagement and onset of disability remain difficult to\ndefine precisely\nAn important strength of this analysis was the availability\nof nine waves of sequential disability data. This design\nfeature enabled us to estimate the effect of social engage-\nment on change in disability status over time with greater\nprecision than is possible in studies with fewer data points\nand longer intervals between observations. Our analysis\nfocused on the average, or marginal, disability effects, but it\ndid not directly address the heterogeneity in change in\ndisability over time that exists among older adults. Another\nlimitation of our analytic approach is that it did not take into\nTABLE 3.

We found previously\nthat low levels of social engagement are associated with\ngreater mortality risk (19). Therefore, selective mortality\nmay have influenced our findings, especially in view of the\nhigh mortality in this cohort during follow-up (48 percent).\nHowever, selective mortality is unlikely to account for the\nobserved effect of social engagement on disability, given\nthat the association was only slightly reduced among those\nwho survived the entire follow-up period. Disability can be\nviewed as a stage in the course of chronic disease processes\nthat will ultimately lead to death. It is possible that the same\nmechanisms that enable older adults to reduce the disability\nassociated with chronic diseases, such as greater resilience,\nalso allow them to prolong life in the face of declining\nhealth.\nAnother strength of our study is that we were able to\nconsider a broad set of other factors that might have\naccounted for an association between social engagement and\ndisability. For example, persons reporting higher levels of\nsocial engagement may also engage in more fitness activi-\nties. Although such activities are strongly related to\ndisability (3, 6\u00ad8), the effect of social engagement was found\nto be independent of this type of activity. We further investi-\ngated the potentially confounding effects of socioeconomic\nstatus, poor physical or mental health, and social network\nties, all of which were found to be correlated with social\nengagement and are also known to be related to disability\nof social engagement was either unaffected or only slightly\nreduced after adjustment for these variables.\nThe present findings are generally consistent with a health\nbenefit related to social engagement in older populations. A\nnumber of studies have indicated a clear survival advantage\nfor older adults who are more socially active or who partici-\npate in specific social or productive activities (13, 14, 16,\n19), although not all studies have observed a clear survival\nbenefit (64). Others have reported that social engagement is\nassociated with reduced levels of depressive symptoms (54)\nand might be protective against decline in cognitive function\nand onset of dementia (15, 65). These findings suggest that\nsocial engagement forms an integral part of a constellation of\ncharacteristics that have substantial significance for the\noverall health, well-being, and functional independence of\nolder adults. As such, social engagement may be a critical\nIn sum, we found that higher levels of social engagement\nare associated with reduced disability and that this effect was\nconsistent across three different measures of disability as\nwell as across gender and racial subgroups. However, the\nlongitudinal data failed to provide evidence for a clear causal\neffect on rate of functional decline. This finding does not\nnecessarily diminish its potential significance for preventing\ndisability. Promotion of social and productive activity may\nprovide both clinicians and policy makers with an additional\nstrategy to maintain the health and independence of seniors\nand to postpone the disabling consequences of age-related\nchronic diseases. For most people, being socially engaged,\nhaving meaningful social and productive activity in one's\nlife, is a worthy goal in and of itself.\n"
