The\nPACARDO name concatenates PA for\nPanam\u00e1, CA for Centroam\u00e9rica, and RDO\nfor Rep\u00fablica Dominicana.\nBackground for this report now in-\ncludes a growing body of research on\nthe epidemiology of adolescent drug\ninvolvement in these countries of the\nAmericas, with prior contributions by\nmembers of our own research group,\nand by others. As shown in Table 1,\nmost of the published evidence is from\nPanama and Costa Rica (1\u00ad6). For\nama National Youth Survey over 40%\nof school-attending adolescents had\nstarted to drink alcohol, while a much\nsmaller proportion had used mari-\njuana and inhalant drugs; the use of\ncocaine (crack/coca paste) and heroin\nwas quite rare (1\u00ad6). Summarizing ev-\nidence from pilot surveys conducted\nin anticipation of our PACARDO proj-\nect, Vittetoe and colleagues (4) found\nsubstantial between-country variation\nin cumulative occurrence of tobacco\nexperience, with estimates of tobacco\nsmoking ranging from 3% of school-\nattending youths in the Dominican\nRepublic to more than 25% of school-\nattending youths in El Salvador. How-\never, in this preparatory pilot work,\nthe sampling and data-gathering meth-\nods were not held constant across coun-\ntries, and methodological differences\nmay account for observed variation\nof the estimates. More recent Global\nYouth Tobacco Survey data also reflect\nbetween-country variability in tobacco\nsmoking experiences within the seven\nPACARDO countries (7\u00ad9).\nBeyond useful epidemiological sur-\nveillance research of the type just de-\nscribed, there have been a few studies\nseeking evidence on suspected causal\ndeterminants for adolescent drug in-\nvolvement in the seven PACARDO\ncountries. For example, Vittetoe and\ncolleagues (4) found that in most of\nthose countries a higher level of con-\nduct problems was associated with\ncumulative occurrence of tobacco use,\nreflecting what may be a causal rela-\ntionship. In studies of youths in Costa\nRica, Sandi and colleagues (3) found\nthat adolescent drug use co-occurred\nwith family relations problems and de-\nlinquency. Delva and colleagues, study-\ning school-attending youths in Panama,\nfound evidence consistent with \"social\ncontagion\" of drug involvement (2).\nThat is, there was a tangible level of\nclustering of drug involvement within\nschools, over and above what might be\nexpected in relation to the composition\nof the student bodies (e.g., in relation\nto age and sex). Previously, Delva and\ncolleagues had shown that male stu-\ndents in Panama were more likely to\nhave had opportunities to try drugs as\ncompared to female students, but that\nfemales were just as likely as males to\ninitiate drug use once the opportunity\narose (1). This finding from Panama is\nconsistent with evidence reported by\nVan Etten and Anthony, whose epide-\nmiological research was based on na-\ntional surveys of young people in the\n",

To estimate the occurrence and school-level clustering of drug involvement\namong school-attending adolescent youths in each of seven countries in Latin America, draw-\ning upon evidence from the PACARDO research project, a multinational collaborative epi-\ndemiological research study.\nMethods. During 1999-2000, anonymous self-administered questionnaires on drug in-\nvolvement and related behaviors were administered to a cross-sectional, nationally representa-\ntive sample that included a total of 12 797 students in the following seven countries: Costa\nPACARDO name concatenates PA for Panam\u00e1, CA for Centroam\u00e9rica, and RDO for\nRep\u00fablica Dominicana). Estimates for exposure opportunity and actual use of alcohol, to-\nbacco, inhalants, marijuana, cocaine (crack/coca paste), amphetamines and methampheta-\nmines, tranquilizers, ecstasy, and heroin were assessed via responses about questions on age of\nfirst chance to try each drug, and first use. Logistic regression models accounting for the com-\nplex survey design were used to estimate the associations of interest.\n Key words\nResults. Cumulative occurrence estimates for alcohol, tobacco, inhalants, marijuana, and il-\nlegal drug use for the overall sample were, respectively: 52%, 29%, 5%, 4%, and 5%. In com-\nparison to females, males were more likely to use alcohol, tobacco, inhalants, marijuana, and\nillegal drugs; the odds ratio estimates were 1.3, 2.1, 1.6, 4.1, and 3.2, respectively. School-level\nclustering was noted in all countries for alcohol and tobacco use; it was also noted in Costa\nRica, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Panama for illegal drug use.\nConclusions. This report sheds new light on adolescent drug experiences in Panama, the\nfive Spanish-heritage countries of Central America, and the Dominican Republic, and presents\nthe first estimates of school-level clustering of youthful drug involvement in these seven coun-\ntries. Placed in relation to school survey findings from North America and Europe, these esti-\nmates indicate lower levels of drug involvement in these seven countries of the Americas. For\nexample, in the United States of America 70% of surveyed youths had tried alcohol and 59%\nhad smoked tobacco. By comparison, in these seven countries, only 51% have tried alcohol and\nonly 29% have smoked tobacco. Future research will help to clarify explanations for the ob-\nserved variations across different countries of the world. In the meantime, strengthening of\nschool-based and other prevention efforts in the seven-country PACARDO area may help these\ncountries slow the spread of youthful drug involvement, reduce school-level clustering, and\navoid the periodic epidemics of illegal drug use that have been experienced in North America.\nAdolescent, adolescent behavior, alcohol drinking, smoking, substance-related\ndisorders, Central America, Dominican Republic.\nOriginal research Dormitzer et al. \u00b7 Youthful drug involvement in Central America and the Dominican Republic\nIn this paper we seek to add to the\ngrowing body of empirical work on\nadolescent drug involvement in the\nAmericas, with a contribution of evi-\ndence from a cross-national collabora-\ntive project designed with a deliberate\nintent to foster cross-national compar-\nisons as well as comparisons within\neach of the seven participating coun-\ntries. The intent to draw cross-country\ncomparisons accounts for the PA-\nCARDO research project's focus on\nschool-attending youths in the middle\nadolescent years. Elsewhere, we have\nproposed to survey youths not in\nschool within these countries--for ex-\nample, with street-intercept sampling\nof youthful pedestrians in plazas,\nstreet markets, and other locations.\nHowever, this sampling method neces-\nsarily must be crafted to the individual\ncircumstances of each country, and\namong the PACARDO countries there\nis considerable variation in such char-\nacteristics as total population, the pro-\nportion of the population living in\nurban areas, literacy levels, and income\n(Table 2). Between-country variation of\nthis type makes cross-country compar-\nison quite difficult unless the research\nprotocol is tightly constrained. As\nsuch, in this article, with the goal of\ncross-country comparison, we retain a\nfocus on school-attending youths who\nwere in middle adolescence during the\nclosing years of the 20th century. While\nwe do not wish to minimize the impor-\ntance of research on school dropouts\nand street children, the drug involve-\nment of school-attending youth is of\ninterest for many reasons, including\nthe fact that in the 21st century many of\nthe leaders of these countries will\nlikely come from the youthful popula-\ntion now attending school.\nTABLE 1.

Gonzalez,\nMarcel Penna, Julio Bejarano, Mauri-\ncio Sanchez, Kenneth Vittetoe, Ulises\nGonzalez, Juan Alfaro, Rodolfo Kepfer,\nJorge Bolivar Diaz, Manuel Herrera,\nJulia Hasbun) as well as a PI and re-\nsearch trainees in the United States\n(James C. Anthony, Catherine Dormit-\nzer, Chuan-Yu Chen) whose work was\nsponsored by the National Institute on\nDrug Abuse and the Johns Hopkins\nUniversity. Technical assistance and\nother expertise were provided by the\nOAS (Anna Chisman), PAHO (En-\nrique Madrigal), and the Universidad\nde Chile (Luis Caris).\nA cross-sectional research design\nwas chosen for the PACARDO project,\nwith the intent to use the cross-sec-\ntional study experience to create ex-\npertise needed for more complex fu-\nture investigations with longitudinal\nand randomized intervention designs.\nThe ministry of education in each\ncountry was able to provide a com-\nplete list of public and private schools.\nThis list of schools constituted the ini-\ntial sampling frame from which each\ncountry's population of school-attend-\ning adolescents was sampled.\nOur goal was to have all data gath-\nvador was postponed until calendar\nyear 2000. A target goal for statistical\neach country's sample, for a total sam-\nSampling, participation, and\nprotection of human subjects\nMethods of probability sampling\ncreated a nested structure: youths\nwithin schools, and schools within de-\npartments (or provinces) of each coun-\ntry. From each country's sampling\nframe (the complete list of public and\ndesignated probabilistically, using a\nbalanced stratified sampling approach\noriginally developed by Professor\nRichard Royall of Johns Hopkins Uni-\nversity and described elsewhere (11,\n12). In five countries, initially sampled\nstrata were formed in relation to the\ndepartments of the country; the sam-\npling of schools ensured appropriate\nbalance in representation of students\nfrom departments with small popula-\ntions as well as students from the cap-\nital city and other similarly populous\nregions. Given its small geographic\nsize and densely congregated popula-\ntion, El Salvador's sample was drawn\nfrom every department of the country.\nAfter probability sampling to desig-\nnate schools, members of the study\nteam rostered classrooms within each\ndesignated school, seeking to identify\nand include all classrooms that in-\ncluded 16-year-old pupils. That is, our\nintent was to secure a sample with a\nmean age of roughly 16 years in each\ncountry. From this roster, one, two, or\nthree classrooms were randomly se-\nlected within each designated school,\nbased on school size. Rather than pull\nout the 16-year-olds for survey, all\nyouths in the designated classrooms\nwere recruited for assessment during\na regular classroom session. The result\nwas an approximate self-weighted\nyears and with an age range reflect-\ning the inclusion of younger and older\nyouths within these classrooms. In sev-\neral countries, especially within smaller\nschools, 16-year-olds are grouped in\nclassrooms with youths as young as 10\nyears and as old as young adults, and\nour sample reflects these educational\npractices. For this reason, age (in\nyears) is included as a covariate in our\nanalysis plan.\nStrong involvement of in-country\nprincipal investigators, coupled with\nsupport and enthusiasm within the\nministries of education and health, re-\nsulted in all school directors and prin-\ncipals agreeing to participate in the\nsurvey. However, for practical rea-\nTABLE 2.

For ex-\nample, we encountered listed schools\nthat had been relocated due to damage\ncaused by hurricane winds, water, or\nmud slides. Occasionally, a listed\nschool was found to cater solely to\nadult learners (i.e., no students age 16\nyears). When this occurred, a similar\nschool was selected at random from\nthe same department of the country,\nwith selection procedures modeled\nafter those used to select replacement\nschools for the Monitoring the Future\nsurvey of school-attending youths in\nthe United States (13). In actual prac-\ntice there were replacements of this\ntype in only three countries: El Sal-\nvador (four schools), Honduras (three\nschools), and Nicaragua (three schools).\nThere was 100% participation by the\ninitially designated schools in Costa\nRica, the Dominican Republic, Guate-\nmala, and Panama.\nIn addition to this excellent school-\nlevel participation, there was very\ngood participation by students in the\nclassrooms designated for sampling.\nThe PACARDO project's \"passive\"\nparental consent process involved con-\ntact with parents via a letter from the\nschool director, sent home on the days\nprior to the assessment session; no\nparental signature was required. This\nletter explained the purposes and con-\ntents of the survey, and it instructed\nparents to advise their children to opt\nout of the survey if they so chose.\n\"Opting out\" involved allowing the\nyouth to mark a symbol to designate a\nmissing value for all questions on the\nsurvey form. During the assessment\nsession an active assent process was in\nplace; youths could decline to answer\nany and all questions if they did not\nwish to participate, even if their par-\nents had consented to allow them to\nparticipate. In actual practice, nonpar-\nticipation in this form was atypical:\nonly 2 students marked missing value\nsymbols for all survey item responses,\nand 143 students marked missing\nvalue symbols for all survey items re-\nlated to drug exposure opportunities\nand actual use. Thus, the survey team\nachieved participation by more than\n98% of the designated sample of\nschool-attending youths. In theory,\nstudent-level nonparticipation also\nmight have occurred if parents in-\nstructed their children to stay home\nfrom school on the posted days of as-\nsessment. This practice, if it occurred,\nseems to have been rare. Based on\nclassroom-level data provided by\nteachers, student absenteeism rates\nwere not unusual on the days of as-\nsessment, that is, in a range of 5% to\n7% in Costa Rica and Panama, with\neven lower absenteeism rates in the\nother countries surveyed.\nThe overall study protocol was ap-\nproved by a United States National In-\nstitutes of Health initial review group,\nwhich reviewed scientific merit and\npublic health significance of the work\nprior to award of National Institute on\nDrug Abuse funds, as well as human\nsubjects protections. The protocol was\nalso reviewed and approved by the In-\nstitutional Review Board (\"Human\nEthics\" IRB) of the sponsoring univer-\nsity in the United States (Johns Hop-\nkins University), and by independent\nhuman subject committees in all seven\ncountries where the school surveys\nwere completed.\nAssessment procedures, including\na three-part assessment protocol\nEach country's leadership team re-\ncruited and trained field research staff\naccording to a standardized PACARDO\nresearch project protocol, and also dis-\npatched a pair of assessors (a lead\nassessor and an assistant) to each des-\nignated school. The standard multi-\ncountry protocol required the asses-\nsors to visit the school for an initial\nwithin a designated classroom, and\nthen to return for a second session,\nalso of 60 to 90 minutes, that sought to\nassess the youths from that classroom\nwho had been absent on the first day.\nOn the day of the first visit the asses-\nsors met and answered questions\nposed by the school director or princi-\npal, and laid out an assessment sched-\nule, typically with no more than one\nclassroom-based assessment session\ncompleted each morning and one\ncompleted each afternoon. In some of\nthe larger schools, up to three days of\nwork were required to complete the\nassessment process.\nWithin each designated classroom\nthe lead assessor and the assistant fol-\nlowed the PACARDO research pro-\nject's three-part assessment protocol,\nwhich was designed to improve the\nquality and accuracy of the study evi-\ndence. For the first part, the school di-\nrector brought the assessors to the\nclassroom and introduced them to the\nteacher and youths seated in the class-\nroom. The school director, teacher,\nand assistant assessor then left the\nclassroom in charge of the team's lead\nassessor. While the lead assessor was\nintroducing the survey to the youths,\nthe assistant provided the teacher with\ninstructions about completion of stan-\ndardized ratings (described below);\nonce the teacher started to make these\nratings, the assistant returned to assist\nthe lead assessor in the classroom.\nWithin the classroom the lead asses-\nsor's first tasks were to describe the sur-\nvey and to work through issues of trust\nand rapport, prior to distribution of\nthe preprinted questionnaire form. All\nitems on this questionnaire were sub-\njected to a translation-backtranslation-\nharmonization process that helped\npromote comprehension of the Spanish-\nlanguage survey items by the partici-\npating youths. The questionnaire was\ngroup-paced but self-administered.\nThis first part of the assessment proto-\ncol was structured in a manner that ac-\ntually encouraged the youths to voice\nconcerns about the anonymity and con-\nfidentiality of the study data; our idea\nwas that these concerns should be\nmade public and discussed, with reso-\nlution in the form of increased trust\nand rapport. A regime of drug pro-\nhibition is in place within each par-\nticipating country, as it is within the\nUnited States, so the accuracy and\ncompleteness of the self-report youth\nsurvey data depended on the youths\nOriginal research Dormitzer et al. \u00b7 Youthful drug involvement in Central America and the Dominican Republic\nbeing confident that their answers\nwould be anonymous. In addition, ex-\nplicit assurance was needed that the\nsurvey results on illegal drug activities\nwould be reported in a manner that\nwould thwart repercussions at the in-\ndividual level and at the school level.\nAt the individual level, an undesirable\nrepercussion could be an arrest for il-\nlegal drug use as reported in the sur-\nvey; at the school level, the police\ncould try to use the survey results to\nidentify schools with high levels of\ndrug use and then send undercover\npolice cadets to those schools in an ef-\nfort to apprehend drug users, as has\nbeen done in the United States. The as-\nsessors explained our study proce-\ndures for ensuring protection against\nthis type of repercussion, as well as the\nprocedure for marking a missing value\nsymbol (a circled dot) whenever a\nyouth wished to skip any or all survey\nquestions.\nThe formal survey session started\nafter the assessors worked through\nthese trust and rapport issues. The lead\nassessor walked through the classroom\nand distributed a stack of anonymous\npreprinted questionnaire forms as well\nas survey pencils. Youths were invited\nto take any preprinted form in the\nstack (top, bottom, middle), as an addi-\ntional safeguard and privacy protec-\ntion. That is, the youths selected their\nown forms; they were not preassigned.\nAfter distribution of the forms, the lead\nassessor read out a set of scripted, IRB-\napproved sentences to formalize the\nyouth assent process. Here again, the\nlead assessor advised the youths that\nthey had the right to skip any or all sur-\nvey questions, and that they could\nmark a missing value symbol when-\never they wished to skip a question. As\ndescribed above, there were youths\nwho declined to participate (i.e., they\nmarked every question with the miss-\ning value symbol), and there were\nyouths who declined to answer ques-\ntions about illegal drug involvement\n(i.e., they marked the drug use ques-\ntions with the missing value symbol,\nbut they gave valid responses to the\nother survey questions.).\nThe second part of the protocol in-\nvolved the actual assessment, as struc-\ntured by 19 zones or modules in the\npreprinted PACARDO questionnaire.\nThe lead assessor secured the youths'\nattention and worked through each\npage of the questionnaire, module by\nmodule, reading aloud each question\nso as to group-pace the process of as-\nsessment. As the assessor read each\nquestion, the students followed along\nand marked their own answers. The\nassistant helped to ensure that privacy\nwas respected and order was main-\ntained, such as by providing quiet an-\nswers to idiosyncratic questions from\nindividual students. This approach\nwas designed to overcome interindi-\nvidual variations in literacy, and it was\nalso intended to reduce what some-\ntimes occurs as \"racing\" to the end of\na self-administered questionnaire and\nresultant marking errors.\nConstruct domains covered in the\n224-item standardized PACARDO self-\nreport questionnaire are listed in Table\n3, along with illustrative items and\nscales. Initial modules assessed gen-\neral health constructs and social adap-\ntation, such as are tapped by questions\nabout headaches, positive moods, and\ngetting along with other youths. These\nfirst modules help reinforce the idea\nthat our research is focused on youth\nhealth and well-being in general, with\nillegal drug activities being only one\narea of concentration. The first ques-\ntions about affiliation with drug-in-\nvolved peers appear in the 8th mod-\nule, after 88 questions on other aspects\nof youth health and well-being. Ques-\ntions about the youth's own drug in-\nvolvement begin at PACARDO ques-\nstarts out asking about legal consump-\ntion of chicha (a widely consumed in-\ndigenous alcoholic beverage typically\nmade via fermentation of maize or\nother local plant material), alcoholic\nbeverages in general, and tobacco.\nSubsequent modules address illegal\ndrugs (e.g., marijuana, coca paste),\nprior to a concluding 20-item module\nmodeled after Johanson's Behavioral\nRepertoire Rating Scale (14).\nUnlike prior survey forms used in\nLatin America, such as the Drug Use\nScreening Inventory (DUSI), the PA-\nCARDO questionnaire's nondrug mod-\nules are heterogeneous with respect to\nitem content. Whereas each DUSI\nmodule taps just one domain of con-\nstructs and all items in the module are\nabout that domain, each PACARDO\nmodule contains a mix of topics. For\nexample, items about health are mixed\ntogether with items about social adap-\ntation. In addition, the DUSI items are\nall true/false or yes/no items, with a\n\"yes\" response indicating the presence\nof a problem (e.g., irritable mood). In\ncontrast, PACARDO items were writ-\nten with a mix of yes/no responses\nsuch that \"yes\" sometimes indicates\nthe presence of a problem (e.g., \"Do\nyou feel sad a lot?\") and sometimes\nthe absence of a problem (e.g., \"Dur-\ning the past six months, have you slept\nwell?\"). The PACARDO approach is\nbased on psychometric assessment\nprinciples that seek to reduce stereo-\ntypical response-marking tendencies\nand related survey response errors. In\ncontrast, the DUSI approach may yield\nhigher scale-level internal consistency\ncoefficients (e.g., Kuder-Richardson\nformula 20 for Cronbach's alpha), but\nthe greater internal consistency may\nbe induced by stereotypical response-\nmarking tendencies of the individual\nThe third part of the protocol was\nthe closing session, during which the\nassessors collected the completed ques-\ntionnaires in a manner that helped\npromote a sense of confidentiality. Spe-\ncifically, a large envelope was passed\naround, and students dropped their\ncompleted survey forms into the enve-\nlope with no one being able to identify\nthe specific form deposited by an indi-\nvidual student. The assessors sealed\nand packed away the envelope before\nengaging in closing exercises that in-\ncluded expressions of gratitude and\nhope that the youths would agree to\nparticipate in future assessments of\nthis type. Youths were allowed to keep\nthe survey pencils as a token of our ap-\npreciation for their participation.\nWhile the students were completing\nthe PACARDO questionnaire, the\nclassroom teacher worked on a sur-\nvey-related task outside the classroom.\nThe survey team had arranged for the\nteacher to create a list of absentee stu-\nDormitzer et al. \u00b7 Youthful drug involvement in Central America and the Dominican Republic Original research\nOriginal research Dormitzer et al. \u00b7 Youthful drug involvement in Central America and the Dominican Republic\ndents (i.e., students on the classroom\nroster but who were absent on the date\nof assessment), and to rate these stu-\ndents as well as a subsample of all\nother students on the roster. This set\nof ratings followed a scripted, stan-\ndardized rating procedure called the\nTeacher Observation of Classroom\nAdaptation--Revised (TOCA-R), which\nthe PACARDO project team translated\ninto Spanish, back-translated into Eng-\nlish, and harmonized for Spanish\nlanguage use in this project (17). The\nteachers also completed a standard-\nized PACARDO rating form on the\nclassroom, school, and school neigh-\nborhood environment. This form,\ncalled in Spanish the Medio Ambiente\nEscolar (MAMBI), was devised in\nSpanish for the PACARDO project,\nand has helped the project team un-\nderstand the characteristics of the\nschools, the classrooms within the\nschools, and the neighborhood sur-\nroundings of the school (e.g., residen-\ntial, industrial, commercial). Results\nfrom the TOCA-R and MAMBI will be\nintegrated within future PACARDO\nproject reports.\nThe process of translation, back-\ntranslation, and harmonization of the\nPACARDO survey questionnaire,\nTOCA-R, and MAMBI items involved\nall leaders listed as coauthors of this\nreport and their local area colleagues,\nas well as pilot testing within these\ncountries. This process helped refine\nthe assessments. For example, in most\ncountries there was a question on well-\nbeing: \"Ha estado todo bien contigo?\"\nFor Costa Rica, however, the following\nphrasing of the question was deemed\nmore appropriate: \"Ha estado todo\nbien o pura vida con vos?\" (Copies of\nthe PACARDO youth questionnaire,\nTOCA-R, and MAMBI can be obtained\nby sending an e-mail to the corre-\nsponding author.)\nKey response variables\nand covariates of interest\nKey response variables in this study\nreport have been measured by PA-\nCARDO items on age at first drug ex-\nposure opportunity (e.g., \"Regarding\nthe drug marijuana, how old were you\nwhen you first had a chance to try mar-\nijuana?\") and age at first actual drug\nTABLE 3.

These ques-\ntions were asked about each drug of in-\nthe PACARDO questionnaire. In this\nreport, valid age values given in re-\nsponse to these questions have been\ndichotomized to reflect ever/never ex-\nperiences, coded as 1/0 responses. Par-\nticipants who indicated that they had\nnever experienced a chance to try the\ndrug are coded \"0\" on the drug expo-\nsure opportunity variable, and those\nwho reported a chance were coded as\n\"1.\" Those who indicated that they had\nnever used the drug were coded \"0\" on\nthe drug use variable, and drug-using\nyouths were coded \"1.\" Drugs of inter-\nest are: alcoholic beverages, tobacco, in-\nhalant drugs, and illegal or controlled\ndrugs such as marijuana, crack, coca\npaste, heroin, and ecstasy. \"Extramed-\nical use\" of tranquilizers was assessed\nby asking a Spanish translation of this\nquestion: \"Regarding the drugs di-\nazepam, alprazolam, chicota, or other\ntranquilizers, how old were you when\nyou first had the opportunity to try\ntranquilizers or other sedatives for\nother than medical reasons?\" (Chicota is\na slang term for tranquilizers.)\nKey covariates of interest are age\n(in years), sex, country, and private vs.\npublic school type. Country is a multi-\nnomial variable, and public/private is a\ndichotomous variable, with values from\nan administrative database created by\nthe survey team. For example, the as-\nsessors logged an entry for each school\nto indicate whether it was public or pri-\nvate. Checked against the Ministry of\nEducation listing of schools, this vari-\nable was used in the following analy-\nses. Sex (male/female) and age in years\nare from standardized self-report PA-\nCARDO items on these characteristics.\nRelationships between the PACARDO\ndrug involvement constructs and the\nother PACARDO constructs listed in\nTable 3 will be the subject matter for fu-\nture reports from our research group.\nData processing and quality control\nAfter data collection, all survey data\nwere keyed to disk, with 100% veri-\nfication. This double-entry process\nwas completed using a standardized\nEpi Info computer software (Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention,\nAtlanta, Georgia, United States) data-\nbase created and applied in all seven\ncountries.\nAs in prior studies of youthful drug\nuse, questions on a fake drug (\"Ca-\ndrina\") were included within the\nPACARDO questionnaire. Among the\nan opportunity to use Cadrina, and\n0.4% reported actually using this fake\ndrug. In our reported epidemiological\nestimates we have excluded responses\nfrom these youths, under the assump-\ntion that misstatements about a fake\ndrug may signal presence of falsely\npositive reports about other drug ex-\nperiences or general response errors in\nthe questionnaires completed by these\nparticipants. For this study report we\nhave also excluded responses from the\n2 youths who opted out of the survey\nby marking all responses as missing\nvalues and the 143 youths who opted\nout of all drug involvement responses.\nData analysis plan\nFor this report the epidemiological\nparameters of central interest involve\ntwo things: (a) the occurrence of\nyouthful drug involvement and (b)\nschool-level clustering of youthful\ndrug involvement. Drug involvement\nencompasses the initial drug expo-\nsure opportunity as assessed via PA-\nCARDO self-report items on first\nchance to try each drug of interest as\nwell as the actual use of each drug, as-\nsessed by corresponding PACARDO\nself-report items.\nThe occurrence of youthful drug in-\nvolvement is gauged in relation to cu-\nmulative incidence (CI) within the life\nhistories of the participants, up to and\nincluding the date of assessment. In\ndrug research and psychiatric epi-\ndemiology this CI estimate is some-\ntimes called \"lifetime prevalence,\" but\nthis term is somewhat misleading be-\ncause a prevalence parameter can be\naffected directly by both the average\nincidence of an event or characteristic\nwithin a study base and the average\nduration of the event within the study\nbase (18). In contrast, cumulative inci-\ndence (CI) of an event or characteristic\nin the study base is evaluated across\nthe interval of each participant's life\nup to the date of assessment, and it is\nnot at all influenced by the average\nduration of the event or characteristic\nduring the span of the participant's life\nunless there is attrition due to high\ncase fatality rates or similar removals\nfrom the population under study. It\nmay be noteworthy that cumulative\nincidence of drug use for a study base\ndefined in terms of a probability sam-\nple of school-attending youths may\nnot be the same as cumulative inci-\ndence for a study base defined in\nterms of a cohort of zygotes after fer-\ntilization or in terms of a cohort of live\nbirths (19, 20). If drug exposure or drug\nuse has caused or is otherwise associ-\nated with premature school-leaving or\npremature death, the CI estimate from\nthe PACARDO survey will tend to be\nlower than the CI derived from a hy-\npothetical follow-up of a specific con-\nception cohort or birth cohort in the\nparticipating countries. We will return\nto this \"limitation\" of the PACARDO\nsurvey estimates in the discussion sec-\ntion of this report.\nFor this study, cumulative incidence\nhas been estimated with 95% confi-\ndence bounds (CBs) derived by means\nof Taylor series linearization, as imple-\nmented via svymean procedures with\nthe Stata software (StataCorp, College\nStation, Texas, United States). Cumu-\nlative incidence ratios (CIRs) have\nbeen estimated via odds ratios using a\ncorresponding STATA svylogit proce-\ndure (e.g., to make cross-national com-\nparisons in cumulative incidence, with\ncovariate adjustment for age and sex).\nIn most countries there were some\nmissing responses to questions about\ndrug use. We made CI estimates with\ntwo approaches: (1) with missing re-\nsponses coded as \"0,\" as if the youth\nhad not used the drug; and (2) with\nmissing responses excluded from both\nthe numerator and the denominator of\nthe CI. Only in Panama and in the Do-\nminican Republic did this second ap-\nproach yield appreciably different CI\nDormitzer et al. \u00b7 Youthful drug involvement in Central America and the Dominican Republic Original research\nOriginal research Dormitzer et al. \u00b7 Youthful drug involvement in Central America and the Dominican Republic\nestimates. Therefore, in our table we\nhave reported CI estimates from the\nfirst approach only, but in the footnote\nto the table we have provided the esti-\nmates for Panama and the Dominican\nRepublic wherever we found appre-\nciable differences.\nClustering of drug involvement has\nbeen gauged in the form of the pairwise\ncross-product ratio estimate from the\nalternating logistic regressions, a proce-\ndure devised by V. Carey in an elabora-\ntion of the generalized estimating equa-\ntions methods developed by K.Y. Liang\nand S. Zeger (21\u00ad25). In a series of re-\ncent contributions published in the\nAmerican Journal of Epidemiology, the\nJournal of Epidemiology and Community\nHealth, and elsewhere our research\ngroup has described this novel ap-\nproach to epidemiological investiga-\ntions on nonrandom clustering of\nhealth-related events and characteris-\ntics, and has provided a detailed intro-\nduction to the alternating logistic re-\ngressions (ALRs) and the pairwise\ncross-product ratio (PWCPR, also\nknown as the pairwise odds ratio,\nPWOR), as estimated using ALR meth-\ncontrast between a household-level\nconditional probability or secondary at-\ntack rate versus a communitywide un-\nconditional attack rate, our PWCPR es-\ntimates indicate whether there is a\nnonrandom clustering of drug involve-\nment within schools of each country,\nwith co-occurrence of drug involve-\nment among youths who are sampled\nwithin the same schools of a country as\ncompared to co-occurrence of drug in-\nvolvement by youths sampled from dif-\nferent schools within that country. As\nwith the null value of 1.0 for an odds\nratio or a cross-product ratio from a 2\u00d72\ntable, a PWCPR estimate exceeding the\nnull value of 1.0 is a signal of nonran-\ndom clustering of drug involvement\nwithin schools. This nonrandom clus-\ntering may reflect person-to-person dif-\nfusion of drug involvement or \"social\ncontagion\" processes, as discussed re-\ncently by Petronis and Anthony (30).\nThe ALR estimation procedures for this\nstudy have been implemented using the\nPROC GENMOD command of the SAS\nSystem software (Version 8.2, from the\nSAS Institute, Carey, North Carolina,\nUnited States), which yields generalized\nestimating equation solutions and esti-\nmates of the PWCPR and its 95% CB.\nRESULTS\nTable 4 provides a description of the\nnationally representative sample of\ncents, aggregated across the seven PA-\nCARDO countries, as well as descrip-\ntions of the study sample within each\nparticipat-ing country.

When all illegal drug use was\ngrouped into a single category, there\nwas noteworthy school-level cluster-\ning of illegal drug use in Panama, El\nSalvador, and Guatemala. Point esti-\nmates for the PWCPR values were\nabove the null value of 1.0 for all of the\nother countries, but in these instances,\nthe 95% confidence bounds entrapped\nthe null value, and the associated P\nvalue was greater than 0.05 (P values\nnot shown in the figure).\nDISCUSSION\nThe main findings of this cross-\nnational study of school-attending\nyouths in the PACARDO countries\nare summarized in the following six\nparagraphs.\nFirst, there is substantial country-to-\ncountry variation in the estimated cu-\nmulative incidence of alcohol involve-\nment. When all PACARDO youths are\naggregated, more than one-half of\nthese youths have had a chance to try\nalcoholic beverages, and an estimated\nalcoholic beverages at least once. The\nlargest estimates are from the Domini-\nhad the chance to try alcohol, and al-\nmost as many have actually consumed\nalcohol. The smallest estimates are\nhad a chance to try alcohol, and 24%\u00ad\n28% have consumed alcohol. As noted\nin Table 9, logistic regression analysis\nwith covariate adjustment for age (in\nyears), sex (male/female), and school\ntype (public/private) confirms that\nthese country-to-country variations\ncannot be understood as artifacts of\nimbalanced samples with respect to\nthese variables. The smallest associa-\ntion (odds ratio estimate) for alcohol\nuse was 1.9 (El Salvador), with Guate-\nmala as a reference. The largest asso-\nciation for alcohol use was 15.9\n(Dominican Republic), also with Gua-\ntemala as a reference. As shown in Fig-\nure 1, estimates of school-level cluster-\ning indicated that alcohol use clusters\nnonrandomly within schools in all of\nthe PACARDO countries. The largest\nclustering point estimate is observed\nin Guatemala, and the smallest cluster-\ning estimate is observed in Costa Rica.\nA second major finding is that\nyouthful tobacco involvement occurs\nless often than youthful alcohol in-\nvolvement in all of the PACARDO\ncountries. There is country-by-country\nvariation in cumulative incidence of\nexposure opportunity and actual use.\nThe largest estimates are from Costa\nchance to try tobacco, and almost as\nmany have actually used tobacco at\nleast once. The smallest estimates are\nhad a tobacco exposure opportunity,\nleast once. Logistic regression analyses\nindicate country-to-country variation\nin exposure opportunity and actual\nuse. For example, with the experience\nof youths in Guatemala as a reference,\ntobacco exposure opportunity and to-\nbacco use occur four to six times more\noften in Costa Rica. Whereas pilot\nstudies had indicated a lower occur-\nrence of tobacco smoking in the Do-\nminican Republic than in El Salvador\nas compared to the other countries in-\nvestigated, this was not the case in the\npresent study. Here, with more rigor-\nous adherence to a common cross-na-\ntional sampling and survey protocol,\nwe find that youths in El Salvador are\nmore likely to have started smoking\ntobacco as compared to those in Gua-\ntemala. Youths in the Dominican Re-\npublic are just as likely to have started\nsmoking tobacco as are their counter-\nparts in Guatemala. Notwithstanding\nthese variations in cumulative occur-\nrence of tobacco smoking among\nyouths, as depicted in Figure 1, to-\nbacco smoking experience has a non-\nrandom school-level clustering in all\nseven PACARDO countries. The larg-\nest point estimates for school-level\nclustering are observed in Guate-\nmala, and the smallest clustering esti-\nmates are observed in Costa Rica and\nNicaragua.\nThird, with respect to exposure op-\nportunity and use of inhalant drugs\nsuch as glues and fuels, cumulative in-\ncidence estimates are largest for the\nDominican Republic and Honduras,\nand they are smallest for Panama and\nGuatemala. In the seven PACARDO\ncountries as a whole, an estimated\nhave experienced a chance to try in-\nhalant drugs, while an estimated 5%\nhave engaged in inhalant drug use on\nat least one occasion. It is noteworthy\nthat in Honduras an estimated 16%-\n22% of youths have had a chance to try\ninhalants but only about 5% have actu-\nally experimented with inhalants. We\ncannot say whether this \"resistance\" to\nthe opportunity to try inhalant drugs\nhas been induced by an aggressive\nanti-inhalants campaign in Honduras,\nalthough we are aware of considerable\nnewspaper coverage and publicity\ngiven to street kids' usage of the cob-\nbler's glue marketed as Resistol in that\ncountry, as well as other commercially\navailable volatile substances. With re-\nspect to school-level clustering of in-\nhalant drug use, we found nonrandom\nclustering of inhalant drug use in\nbut not elsewhere.\nFourth, with respect to illegal drug\ninvolvement, we find that marijuana\nexposure opportunity and marijuana\nuse are present but not widespread. In\nthe PACARDO countries overall, an\nthe school-attending youths have had\na chance to try marijuana, and about\nhave actually engaged in marijuana\nuse on at least one occasion. Estimates\nfor Costa Rica are about double these\nvalues, a magnitude of variation that\ncannot be explained by between-\ncountry imbalances with respect to\nage, sex, or type of school. The highest\nestimates of nonrandom school-level\nclustering were found for marijuana\nalso found in Costa Rica and in El Sal-\nCARDO countries, the PWCPR esti-\nmates trap the null value of 1.0.\nFifth, relative to what has been ob-\nserved for alcohol, tobacco, inhalant\ndrugs, and marijuana, the chances to\ntry and the actual use of other illegal\nOriginal research Dormitzer et al. \u00b7 Youthful drug involvement in Central America and the Dominican Republic\nDormitzer et al. \u00b7 Youthful drug involvement in Central America and the Dominican Republic Original research\nTABLE 9.

Read the table from left to right, row by row. When the CIR estimate is not different from 1.0, the\ncumulative incidence in the listed country is not appreciably different from the cumulative incidence in Guatemala. When the CIR is greater than 1.0, the cumulative incidence in the listed coun-\ntry is appreciably larger than the cumulative incidence in Guatemala. When the CIR is less than 1.0, the cumulative incidence in the listed country is appreciably smaller than is the cumula-\ntive incidence in Guatemala.\ndrugs are much less common in the\nPACARDO countries. Cumulative in-\ncidence estimates for crack/coca paste\nuse ranged from below 1% in Panama\nto the 1%\u00ad2% range in all other of the\nseven participating countries.\nSixth, the estimated occurrence of\nextramedical use of tranquilizers var-\nied a great deal between countries,\nwith the CB estimates as high as 13%\u00ad\n18% in Nicaragua, and as low as 1%\u00ad\n2% in Panama. Tranquilizers represent\none drug group that girls were more\nlikely to use extramedically than were\nboys.\nThere are several issues that merit at-\ntention. First, since this study involves\nsamples of school-attending youths,\ncaution is required before generaliza-\ntion to all adolescents. The rate of youth\nleaving school before age 16 varies\namong the participating countries. This\nvariation makes cross-national compar-\nisons more difficult. As discussed else-\nwhere, the assessment of drug use also\nhas its limitations; we must consider\npossible overreporting or underreport-\nYouths not in school were excluded\nfrom the sampling frames of the PA-\nCARDO research project. Nonethe-\nless, as in other countries, such as the\nUnited States, there is good reason to\nstudy the drug involvement of school-\nattending youths in the PACARDO\ncountries. For example, as mentioned\nin the introduction section of this arti-\ncle, it is most likely that the future lead-\nership of these countries will be drawn\nfrom among youths who remain in\nschool during their adolescent years.\nIn the United States the Monitoring\nthe Future (MTF) survey has examined\ndrug-taking and related behaviors, at-\ntitudes, and values of secondary school\nProject on Alcohol and Other Drugs\n(ESPAD) examines drug-taking behav-\niors of secondary school students who\nrable data on alcohol, tobacco, and\nother drug use. Used together, the\nMTF data and the ESPAD data make\nit possible to compare trends between\ncountries (35). The Global Youth To-\nbacco Survey (GYTS) is another school-\nbased survey that assesses tobacco use\nand exposure to tobacco among youth\nsurveillance data generated by the PA-\nCARDO research project adds to the\nbody of public health evidence already\nprovided by MTF, ESPAD, and GYTS\nfor the more established market econ-\nomies of the world.\nNotwithstanding limitations such as\nthese, this study has a number of coun-\nterbalancing strengths, including the\nfact that the PACARDO research proj-\nect represents a first attempt to use the\nsame methods for cross-national stud-\nies of both legal and illegal drug in-\nvolvement among adolescents in Latin\nAmerican countries. To reduce nonre-\nsponse bias, extra attempts were made\nto include absentees. Except when pre-\nvented by extenuating circumstances,\nproject staff returned to the school to\nassess students who had been absent\nthe day of the assessment. However, a\nbias may still exist as students absent\non all days of assessment are excluded\nfrom the analysis, and their absence\nmay be the result of heavier drug use.\nFuture analysis of the TOCA-R ratings\nby classroom teachers will help clarify\nthe differences between the youths\nwho were present and those who were\nabsent.\nIn relation to school survey findings\nfrom other countries as disclosed in\nstudy's estimates suggest that overall\ndrug use is generally lower in the PA-\nCARDO countries. For example, the\ncumulative incidence estimate for alco-\nhol use among tenth graders observed\nfor the United States was 70%, versus\nan estimate of 51% found in the PA-\nCARDO survey; no comparable ESPAD\nestimates have been published. In the\nPACARDO survey we found that\n29% of school-attending youths had\nsmoked tobacco at least once. The cor-\nresponding estimate from the MTF is\n59%. Estimates from GYTS ranged a\ngreat deal: overall, for youths in all the\nGYTS countries, approximately 33% of\nyears had sampled tobacco. The high-\nest estimates of the cumulative inci-\ndence of youth who had ever smoked\ntobacco, around 80%, were in the\nNorthern Marianas Islands; the lowest\nestimates, around 4%, were in the state\nof Tamil Nadu, India. In Latin America\nthe highest estimates of ever having\nsmoked tobacco were in Chile, and\nranged from 68% in the city of Val-\nparaiso to 72% in the city of Santiago.\nIn Uruguay, estimates ranged from\n39% in the city of Colonia to as high as\n57% in the city of Montevideo. In the\ncity of Buenos Aires, Argentina, 55%\nof youth had sampled tobacco. In Peru,\nestimates ranged from 46% in the city\nof Trujillo to 55% in the city of Lima. In\nBolivia, estimates ranged from 54%\nin the city of Santa Cruz to 50% in the\ncity of Cochabamba. Lower estimates\nwere found in Venezuela (22%) and\nin Cuba (34%). The GYTS estimates for\nthe country of Costa Rica are some-\nwhat lower than those found in the\nhowever, this variation might be ex-\npected, given that the mean age of the\nyouth in the PACARDO survey was 16\nyears versus the younger ages of youth\nAs reported in MTF and ESPAD, the\nlifetime history of inhalant use among\nthe United States, and it ranged from\n1% in Romania to 22% in Ireland. The\ncorresponding estimate from the PA-\nCARDO project is 5%.

In the PACARDO sur-\nvey, only about 5% of youths had tried\nmarijuana. Extramedical tranquilizer\nuse estimates in the PACARDO sur-\nvey were similar to those found in\nthe United States: the estimate from\nthe PACARDO survey was 7%; the\ncorresponding value from the MTF\nsurvey was 8%.
