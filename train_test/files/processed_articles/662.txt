Hughes\nThe medical profession appears to be undergoing profound changes\nthat promise to shape its future. Some of these changes, such as the\nincreasing physician supply, the expanding proportion of women entering\nthe profession, and the declining numbers of medical school applicants,\nhave been well documented, although their causes and consequences are\ndebated.1 Other changes may be detected in anecdotal comments that\nreflect an emerging malaise within the profession, a sense that something\nmay be fundamentally wrong. Changes in the organization and technol-\nogy of medical practice also appear to be altering traditional expectations\nof physicians' roles. While the implications of these changes for the future\nof medicine are uncertain, many analysts would agree that an important\ntransformation is under way.2 These changes are likely to have their\ngreatest impact upon young physicians who recently have completed\ntheir training. It is these physicians who are making decisions that will\nshape the profession for the next several decades.\nIn this  , we report on initial findings from a survey of young\nphysicians. The survey, performed by the American Medical Associ-\nation's (AMAs) Education and Research Foundation and funded by The\nRobert Wood Johnson Foundation, sought to examine young physicians'\nspecialty choices, the extent of their service to vulnerable populations,\nand their ability to establish stable practice arrangements despite growing\neconomic and competitive pressures.3 Equally important, the survey was\nintended to explore physicians' perceptions of current satisfaction with\nmedicine, where medical practice seemed to be headed in the future, and\nwhat they expected their roles to be.\nStudy methods. The survey was designed to be representative of the\nbased upon the AMA Physician Masterfile. \"Young\" physicians were\nThe authors of this   are from the Office of Health Statistics and Analysis of The Robert\nWood]ohnson Foundation in Princeton, New Jersey.

Most graduated from medical school between 1974\nconsisting of a simple random sample of 8,651 physicians and an over-\nsample of 1,692 black and Hispanic physicians. During the field period,\nwe could not reach or obtain telephone numbers for just over 10 percent\nof the sample. Telephone interviews were completed between April and\npercent); 3,398 physicians (36.7 percent) refused or did not complete the\ninterview. The survey results we present have been statistically adjusted\nto compensate for nonresponse bias associated with respondents' race/\nethnicity, age, country of medical school graduation (U.S. or foreign),\nspecialty, and AMA membership status; they are also limited to young\nphysicians who reported working at least twenty hours per week in patient\ncare (more than 90 percent of all young physicians).\nTo compare young physicians with older, more experienced physicians,\nwe use results from the AMA Socioeconomic Monitoring System Spring\n1987 Survey. We categorize physicians not defined as \"young\" into two\ngroups: \"prime\" and \"senior\" (labels commonly employed by the AMA\nin describing such physicians). Midcareer or \"prime\" physicians are at\nleast age forty or have been in practice seven to twenty-four years; \"senior\"\nphysicians have been in practice twenty-five years or more. We also use\nthe terms \"white\" and \"black\" physicians to denote, respectively, white\nnon-Hispanic and black non-Hispanic individuals; \"other\" physicians\ninclude Asian/Oriental, Pacific Islander, American Indian, or Alaskan\nNative. Educational debt figures reported here have been adjusted for\ninflation and are stated in 1989 dollars.\nCharacteristics Of Young Physicians In Patient Care\nDemographic composition. Despite aggressive admissions policies\naimed at increasing minority enrollment, blacks and Hispanics are still\nunderrepresented in medicine. Blacks, for example, constitute 12 percent\nof the U.S. population but only 4 percent of the young patient care\nphysician pool. Hispanics make up 8 percent of the U.S. population, but\nonly 4 percent of young patient care physicians.\nAlthough the percentage of young physicians who are women (21\npercent) is markedly higher than either midcareer female physicians (10\npercent) or senior female physicians (4 percent), women--who comprise\n51 percent of U.S. college graduates--still only represent less than\none-quarter of the young physician population in practice.

Young female physicians specialize in\nprimary care more often than their male counterparts (Exhibit 1 ).5 Higher\npercentages of young black and Hispanic physicians choose primary care\nspecialties than either white or other young physicians. Three-quarters\nof all young black female physicians practice a primary care specialty,\ncompared to 57 percent of young white female physicians.\nAlthough a lower proportion of young physicians practice in a primary\ncare specialty than in a nonprimary care specialty (45 percent compared\nto 55 percent), young physicians in our sample selected primary care\nspecialties more frequently than midcareer physicians (36 percent). How-\never, a slightly higher percentage of senior physicians (48 percent)\nspecialize in primary care. This probably reflects the large number of\nsenior general practitioners who trained in an era before specialized\ngraduate medical education became the norm.\nIncomes of young physicians. Primary care physicians earn signifi-\ncantly lower incomes than other physicians. Annual median income\nranges from $60,000 for family/general practitioners and pediatricians to\n$110,000 for anesthesiologists (Exhibit 2). Only primary care specialists\nin obstetrics/gynecology earn above the median of $75,000. In contrast,\nall but one of the nonprimary care specialties earn above $75,000 yearly.\nPercentage Of Young Physicians Specializing In Primary Care\nSource: American Medical Association 1987 (AMA) Young Physician Survey.\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 02, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

These income differences are\ndue, in part, to specialty and employment setting choices. However, even\nafter controlling for specialty, employment setting, years in practice, and\nhours worked per week, women still earn, on average, approximately\nEmployment status. More than half (54 percent) of all young physi-\ncians are self-employed, in solo or group practice. Of physicians in the\nsecond year of practice, 44 percent are self-employed, compared to 62\npercent in the sixth year. Employment in public settings and in arrange-\nments with other physicians tends to drop with each year of practice. In\ncontrast, the percentages of physicians employed in health maintenance\norganizations (HMOs), university settings, and private hospitals do not\nchange markedly among cohorts in the early years of practice.\nUnlike other racial/ethnic groups, the majority of black physicians (57\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 02, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

They are more likely than their peers to be\nemployed by HMOs, public institutions, and private hospitals and to\nwork in two or more practices. Although only 14 percent of all young\nphysicians work in multiple practices, 19 percent of young black physi-\ncians practice in two or more arrangements. Physicians who work in\nmultiple arrangements have higher educational debt, earn lower income,\nand are more often employed by others in their principal practice.\nEducational debt at graduation. Educational debt at graduation, in\npercent) of all young black physicians carry over $25,000 in educational\nloans at graduation, far exceeding the proportions of white (41 percent),\nHispanic (36 percent), and other (14 percent) young physicians with\nhigh debt levels. The low debt status of other young physicians may be\neasily explained by the high percentage (75 percent) of \"alien\" foreign\nmedical graduates in this category. Only within this \"other\" category do\ngender differences exist, with women in less debt than men.\nThe percentage of physicians with no educational debt at graduation\nhas decreased over time, from 33 percent for the oldest cohort in the\nsample to 25 percent for the cohort completing training most recently.\nIn addition, the percentage of physicians with greater than $25,000 in\ninflation-adjusted debt at graduation has increased over time, from 32\npercent who completed training in 1982 to over 46 percent who com-\nPopulations served by young physicians. An examination of the\npercentage of black and Hispanic patients served by young physicians\nsuggests that black and Hispanic physicians may serve disproportionately\nin their respective communities. One-half of all patients seen by young\nblack physicians are black, compared to 16 percent of young white\nphysicians' caseloads (Exhibit 3). Similarly, Hispanic patients constitute\n28 percent of young Hispanic physicians' caseloads, compared to 8\npercent for young white physicians. Young physicians appear to care for\na higher percentage of poor patients in their practices (26 percent) than\neither midcareer (20 percent) or senior (19 percent) physicians.6\nYoung Physicians, Perspectives On The Medical Profession\nA concise way to measure the career perspective of young physicians\nis to ask, \"Given what you now know about medicine as a career, if you\nwere in college today, would you go to medical school?\" Overall, 40\npercent of young physicians reported that they would not or were not sure\nthat they would select a career in medicine (Exhibit 4).

On the other hand, the new\npractice arrangements that increasingly are available to physicians enter-\ning practice today may offer more alternatives for young physicians to\nfind satisfying work arrangements.\nYoung physicians who are employees are slightly less likely to report\ncareer dissatisfaction than those who are self-employed, although for\nwhom an employed physician works also makes a difference. The physi-\ncians reporting regret most often are either self-employed but not part of\na group (44 percent) or employed by another physician (45 percent). At\nthe other end of the spectrum, fewer than one-third ofphysicians working\nfor private hospitals (30 percent) or for government agencies (32 percent)\nreport that they would not elect careers in medicine.\nThere is greater variation in career perspectives among specialties. At\nthe extreme, nearly half of anesthesiologists would not select a career in\nmedicine, compared to fewer than one-third of pediatricians. Physicians\nearning less than $26,000 were less likely to express regret than their\nhigher-income colleagues (32 percent versus 40 percent). It is also\nnoteworthy, but not surprising, that physicians with high educational\ndebt at graduation (over $25,000) are more likely to express regret about\ntheir decision to attend medical school (42 percent) than those with\nlower debt (39 percent). Finally, those few physicians working in multiple\npractices report regret less often (35 percent) than those working in one\npractice (41 percent). This finding does not support the hypothesis that\nworking in multiple practices is an indicator of greater stress on young\nphysicians. It appears that answers to this question are affected, at least\nin part, by young physicians' feelings about their current practice(s); 28\npercent of those reporting \"no\" or \"not sure\" said they were likely to\nchange practices soon, compared to 20 percent of those reporting \"yes.\"\nFuture outlook.

Ninety percent of respondents expected\nthe influence of third-party payers to increase; young physicians' expec-\ntations on future income and the malpractice climate were more varied.\nThe survey took place before the Harvard University report on the\nresource-based relative value scale (RBRVS) recommended a recalibra-\ntion of physician fees under Medicare.8 The RBRVS recommendation,\nwhich has been adopted by Congress, would reduce fees for procedure-\nintensive practice (such as surgery and diagnostic tests) to increase\nrewards for time actually spent with patients and for the cognitive work\nofdiagnosis and treatment.9 The three specialties that most often reported\nan expectation of lower incomes in the future are among those that stand\nto gain the most from the RBRVS plan (Exhibit 5). Likewise, the\nspecialties that least often expected lower fees in five years are among\nthose that stand to lose the most ground as the new plan is implemented\nYoung physicians are pessimistic about the future medical malpractice\nclimate; nearly two-thirds report that it will be no different or worse in\nfive years.

Seventy-eight percent of black and Hispanic physicians report\nthat, in five years, the malpractice climate will be the same as or worse\nthan it is today, compared to 62 percent of whites. Some specialties at\nhigh risk of malpractice claims, not surprisingly, report greater pessimism.\nSixty-four percent of obstetricians, for example, report that malpractice\nconcerns will grow over the next five years.\nThe Future Of The Medical Profession\nThe survey results are simultaneously reassuring and unsettling. In the\naggregate, young physicians in our 1987 sample (1) appeared to enter\nprimary care practice in proportionately larger numbers than their mid-\ncareer counterparts; (2) appeared able to build their medical practices\nwithout great difficulty, attaining self-employment generally within a few\nyears following completion of training; and (3) did not appear to be overly\nstressed by economic conditions in the marketplace. Each of these\nconclusions, however, warrants closer examination.\nThe higher proportion of young physicians, compared to midcareer\nphysicians, who entered practice in family medicine, general internal\nmedicine, pediatrics, and obstetrics/gynecology seems reassuring. How-\never, data from the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC)\nMedical School Graduation Questionnaire suggest that the next genera-\ntion of young physicians may choose to enter primary care specialties less\nfrequently.10 Black and Hispanic physicians, especially women, are more\nlikely to enter primary care practice and to serve predominantly black\nand Hispanic populations. It is unclear, however, whether they have made\nthese choices because of professional aspirations and altruistic motives or\nbecause they may have experienced either overt or subtle forms of\ndiscrimination that have effectively limited their opportunities.11\nThe apparent ability of young physicians, in general, to earn reasonable\npersonal incomes (median income of $75,000 per annum) and to become\nself-employed (either in solo or group practice) after only a few years of\npractice may dispel some of the concern that economic forces in the\nenvironment are impeding their progress in practice building and forcing\nsome to leave medicine entirely. The fact that no more than 14 percent\nof young physicians felt a need to seek multiple practice arrangements\nactually augurs well for the profession. However, this observation must\nbe tempered with the knowledge that individuals with more than $25,000\nin inflation-adjusted educational debt at the time of graduation were\nmore likely to engage in multiple practice arrangements than their peers\nwith lower debt levels.\nOur survey does reveal some warning signs for particular segments of\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 02, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

With incomes generally below the median\nincome for all young physicians, many more primary care physicians\n(especially black physicians) may be in danger of encountering economic\nstress in the near future. Potential reform of physician payment systems,\nsuch as the recently adopted Medicare RBRVS method, would likely\nbenefit these physicians. However, implementation of this system is likely\nto take some time, and it is unclear whether higher Medicare payments\nto physicians will, by themselves, be sufficient to offset the demands of\nan increasing debt burden for young physicians.\nPerhaps most alarming is the finding that the youngest cohorts of young\nphysicians (that is, the most recent graduates) have higher proportions\nof individuals with real debt in excess of $25,000 than do older cohorts.\nThis suggests that, unless potential remedies are devised (for example,\nenhanced financial aid packages, reduced medical school expenses, and\nso on), the increasing concentration of real educational debt may prove\nto be a barrier to entry into the profession and may work counter to the\ndesired goal of increasing minority representation in medicine.\nFinally, the finding that 40 percent of all young physicians claim that\nthey would not, or are not sure that they would, go to medical school is\ndisconcerting. This suggests that young physicians may become dis-\nenchanted with medicine relatively early in their careers. In light of the\ngeneral decline in medical school applications over the past fifteen years\n(notwithstanding the most recent data showing a one-year increase), a\ndiscomfort level of 40 percent should not be taken lightly.12 As with any\nsurvey involving self-reports, the findings here should be interpreted\ncautiously, and further analysis of the data will be necessary to explore\nthe relationships between educational debt and young physicians' prac-\ntice patterns. But lest these findings portend the future of medicine,\nmedical educators would do well to note the relatively gloomy outlook\nheld by many young physicians and to take appropriate steps to ensure\nthat positive gains, such as those in minority enrollment, are not eroded\nThe views expressed in this article are solely those of the authors, and no official endorsement by\nThe Robert Wood Johnson Foundation is intended or should be inferred.
