The\nstudy was designed to test the overarching hypothesis\nthat individuals with strong, functioning sexual and inti-\nmate relationships will have better trajectories of health\nand well-being than those whose relationships function\nless well or who lack such relationships. Wave I of\nNSHAP provides the baseline from which we measure\nsexuality, health, and functioning. Thus, measurement of\nsexuality and intimacy was central to the study.\nThis paper outlines the variety of measures of sexuality\nand intimacy available in NSHAP, including sexual activi-\nties, sexual problems, attitudes toward sex and sexuality,\nsatisfaction with sex, characteristics of the sexual partners\nand the quality of the partnership, and nonsexual intimacy.\nWe develop a series of measures of each of these dimen-\nsions, provide descriptive statistics on each measure, eval-\nuatetheirstrengthandweaknesses,anddescribedifferences\nby age and gender.\nFor each of these measures, we describe the questions\nasked of NSHAP respondents to elicit pertinent informa-\ntion, present tabulations of the measure by age and gender,\nand describe results of tests of the linearity and nonlinearity\nof the relationship between the measure and age, separately\nfor men and women.\nSexual Partnerships\nWe broadly define sexuality as the dynamic outcome\nof physical capacity, motivation, attitudes, opportunity for\npartnership, and sexual conduct (Bullivant et al., 2004; Lindau,\nLaumann, Levinson, & Waite, 2003; Spencer, Feldman,\nClark, & Weisstein, 2004). As such, it represents an essen-\ntial nexus for the interaction among social life; culturally\ndetermined beliefs and practices; psychological processes;\nand the biological mechanisms of aging, health, and dis-\nease. Sexual activity and functioning are determined by the\ninteraction of each partner's sexual capacity, motivation,\nconduct, and attitudes and are further shaped by the quality\nand condition of the dyadic relationship itself.\nFor older adults in the generations represented in NSHAP,\nmarriage provides the social and emotional context for the\nvast majority of all sexual activity. Marriage also provides op-\nportunity for intimacy and affects physical and emotional sat-\nisfaction with sex (Waite & Joyner, 2001). At younger ages,\nvirtually all married men and women are sexually active, and\nmarried people show substantially higher rates of sexual\nactivity than the unmarried (Laumann, Gagnon, Michael, &\nMichaels, 1994). Marriage is an important predictor of physi-\ncal and mental health for both men and women and also seems\nHorwitz & White, 1991; Horwitz, White, & Howell-White,\nSexuality: Measures of Partnerships, Practices, Attitudes,\nand Problems in the National Social Life, Health,\nand Aging Study\nLinda J.

The National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP) was designed to examine the relationship\nbetween sexual behavior, sexual problems, and health among older women and men. We describe measures of sexual part-\nnerships, sexual practices, sexual problems, attitudes toward sex, and nonsexual intimacy in the first wave of NSHAP.\nMethods. We compare measures of sexuality for those 57\u00ad85 years old, by age, separately for men and women. We\nconstruct scales of sexual mores, sexual interest, and relationship satisfaction and discuss properties of each scale.\nResults. Sexuality among older adults tends to vary with age and gender. At all ages in this study, men are more likely\nthan women to have a partner, more likely to be sexually active with that partner, and tend to have more positive and\npermissive attitudes toward sex. The proportions in a sexual partnership, behavior, problems, and attitudes all differ sub-\nstantially by age. And these age patterns often differ for men and women.\nDiscussion. Data obtained in the NSHAP can be used to construct key measures of sexuality among older adults; to\nexamine sexuality itself; and to explore the link between sexuality, health, well-being, and other dimensions of the lives\nof older adults.\nKey Words: Sexual function--Sexual practices--Sexuality.\nOther Partnerships\nTo allow for the possibility that some older adults may be\ninvolved in a romantic relationship that does not involve\nsex, respondents were initially asked about their current\nmarital status; those who answered something other than\n\"married\" or \"living with a partner\" were then asked, \"Do\nyou currently have a romantic, intimate, or sexual partner?\"\nThe spouse, cohabiting partner, or other (noncohabiting) ro-\nmantic/intimate partner identified in this way was desig-\nnated as the current partner, and many of the subsequent\nquestions focused explicitly on this relationship.\nA complete marital history was obtained from all respon-\ndents in the same manner used by the 1992 Health and Re-\ntirement Survey; this included the start and end dates (month\nand year) of every marriage and the way in which each pre-\nvious marriage ended (i.e., divorce, widowhood, or separa-\ntion). A complete cohabiting history was also obtained\nusing questions designed specifically for NSHAP. For each\nmarriage, respondents were asked whether they had lived\nwith their spouse prior to getting married and, if so, the\nmonth and year in which they started living together. For\nmarriages that ended in divorce or separation, respondents\nwere also asked for the month and year in which they\nstopped living together. In addition, respondents were also\nasked to enumerate all previous nonmarital, cohabiting rela-\ntionships and, for each, to indicate the month and year in\nwhich they started and stopped living together.\nAlthough some surveys have obtained a complete sexual\npartner history (e.g., National Health and Social Life Sur-\nvey [NHSLS; Laumann et al., 1994], Chicago Health and\nSocial Life Survey [CHSLS; Laumann, Ellingson, Mahay,\n& Paik, 2004]), there was not sufficient time during the\nNSHAP interview to do this. Instead, NSHAP adapted the\napproach used in the NHSLS and the CHSLS to focus on\nrespondents' sexual relationships during the past 5 years.\nThis included the current spouse, cohabiting partner, or ro-\nmantic/intimate partner and either one or two of the next\nmost recent spouses or cohabiting partners within the past\n5 years for a maximum of two partners overall. In addition,\nup to three additional next most recent sexual partners\nwithin the past 5 years were also included. Thus, the desig-\nnated current partner, the most recent spouse or cohabiting\npartner (if one exists within the past 5 years), and the three\nmost recent sexual partners within the past 5 years were\nalways included. For each partnership, respondents were\nasked the month and year of both first (except for marriages\nand cohabiting partnerships that began more than 5 years\nago) and most recent sex, the gender and age (relative to\nthe respondent) of the partner, and whether the respondent\nexpects to have sex with the partner again.\nBecause NSHAP limited the number of sexual partners\nfor which information on the timing of sex was collected,\nthe data set is not well suited for computing the total number\nof sexual partners within a fixed period of time (it should be\nnoted, however, that given the relatively low rate of partner\nacquisition among older adults, the limited 5 year history is\neffectively complete for the large majority of respondents).\nHowever, it is possible to calculate the total number of sex-\nual partners in the past 5 years for all respondents (subject\nonly to missing data), and a self-administered questionnaire\ngiven to all respondents asked separately for the lifetime\nnumber of male and female sexual partners.\nTable 1 illustrates how the NSHAP data set may be used\nto estimate the prevalence of various types of partnerships\nover different periods of time. The likelihood of having a\ncurrent partner decreases with age, due primarily to a drop\nin the percentage married (Lindau et al., 2007). In addition,\nin each age group, men are more likely to have a current\npartner than are women, with the largest difference in the\noldest age group. This difference reflects the higher mortal-\nity rate among men and the age differential between spouses.\nThe rate of acquisition of new partners is relatively low,\nwith roughly 3% of men and less than 1% of women report-\ning multiple partners during the previous year. For both\nmen and women, the percentage reporting more than two\nlifetime heterosexual partnerships decreases with age; the\nlow rate of new partner acquisition suggests that this is at\nleast in part a cohort effect (Laumann et al., 1994). By con-\ntrast, the percentages reporting at least one same-sex part-\nnership over the lifetime--4% of men and 5% of women\noverall--are similar across the age groups. Finally, the per-\ncentage of both men and women who ever cohabited\nsteadily increases in each younger age group, reflecting a\nwell-documented increase in the likelihood of cohabitation\nSexual Activity and Sexual Behaviors\nRespondents who reported that they had engaged in\npartnered sex in the past 12 months were asked a series of\nquestions about the frequency of sex with their husband or\nwife, cohabiting partner, or other partner; how often sex\nincluded vaginal intercourse; how often during vaginal in-\ntercourse they used a condom; how often they participated\nin oral sex; and how often sex included hugging, kissing, or\nother ways of sexual touching. These questions were taken\ndirectly from the National Health and Social Life Study\nTable 2 shows the prevalence of sexual activity and sexual\nbehaviors, by age, for men and women. At ages 57\u00ad64 years,\nthe youngest ages in our sample, 84% of men and 62% of\nwomen report having had sex with a partner in the past year.\nBy the oldest ages in our sample, 75\u00ad85 years, a minority--\n38% of men and 17% of women--are sexually active by this\ndefinition. We also examined the linear--and, in separate\nanalysis not shown, nonlinear--relationship of sexual activ-\nity with age for men and women.The results suggest a smooth\ndecline in likelihood of partnered sex with age for women\nand men, both those with and those without partners, with\nonly a negative linear age effect significant (at p < .001).\nAlthough fewer adults are sexually active at older than at\nyounger ages, those who remain sexually active report hav-\ning partnered sex fairly often and these rates remain remark-\nably constant through ages 65\u00ad75 years and fall only\nmodestly at the oldest ages, when about a quarter of the\nsexually active men and women said that they have sex once\nor twice a week or more. Also, although the trend tests for\nthis variable in Table 2 demonstrate a highly significant lin-\near decline among men and a moderately significant decline\namong women, at least among the latter, our supplemental\nanalysis suggests a nonlinear decline--with a positive\nquadratic age effect (p < .10) suggesting a plateauing of\nfrequent sex with age.\nA very high proportion of NSHAP respondents, like\nyounger respondents in the 1992 National Health and So-\ncial Life Study (Laumann et al., 1994), report that they usu-\nally or always have vaginal intercourse when they have sex.\nAmong the youngest respondents in our sample, 87% of\nwomen and 91% of men say that vaginal sex is usually or\nalways part of sexual activity. For the oldest respondents,\nvaginal intercourse seems to be included in their activities\nyears, and 84% of men this age saying that they usually or\nalways have vaginal intercourse during sex. Our trend tests\nsuggest that a woman's age is not significantly associated\nwith her likelihood of vaginal sex. Among men, in contrast,\nsupplemental analysis indicates that the effect may be cur-\nvilinear, with a positive quadratic effect (p < .05) suggesting\nthat men's likelihood of vaginal intercourse during sex does\nnot fall below a \"baseline,\" even among the oldest old. By\ncontrast, the frequency with which men and women engage\nin hugging, kissing, or other sexual touching, which we la-\nbel \"foreplay,\" is virtually identical at all ages. Specifically,\nlikelihood of foreplay is not correlated with a woman's age\nin any specification, whereas for men, we find only a weakly\nsignificant (p < .10) linear decline. In fact, foreplay and\nvaginal intercourse seem to constitute the two activities\nnecessary for respondents to label what they did as \"sex.\"\nAnd vaginal intercourse seems to become more optional\nwith age.\nTable 2 shows the frequency with which men and women\nreport that they ever participated in oral sex--whether giv-\ning or receiving--in the preceding year. Oral sex is a less\ncommon activity during partnered sex than either foreplay\nor vaginal intercourse, with 62% of men and 53% of women\naged 57\u00ad64 years reporting that they had any oral sex, com-\nyears. These frequencies are consistent with those from the\nNHSLS for men and women in their 50s (Laumann et al.,\nadults substitute oral sex for vaginal intercourse at older\nages, as a result of changes in functionality or poor health,\nbut Table 2 shows that this is not the case because of the\nproportion of both men and women reporting that oral sex is\nTable 1.

Additionally, our trend\ntests also support a smooth linear decline in likelihood of\noral sex among both women (p < .05) and men (p < .001). It\nappears that at the oldest ages sexual activity consists en-\ntirely of kissing, hugging, and sexual touching more often\nthan it does at younger ages.\nThese differences by age in inclusion of oral sex in sex-\nual activities could result from cohort differences in pat-\nterns of sexual behavior established at younger ages and\ncarried over into old age. The youngest NSHAP respon-\ndents are part of the Baby Boom and experienced the sexual\nrevolution. The oldest respondents were teenagers during\nthe 1940s, a period of more conservative sexual mores\n(Joyner & Laumann, 2001). The age differences we observe\ncould also result from changes in sexual repertories that oc-\ncur with age, perhaps as a result of changes in health and\nfunctioning.\nWe can think of frequency of masturbation as indexing\na person's underlying level of sexual interest. Table 2\nshows differences between age groups in the prevalence\nof masturbation that track differences between these same\ngroups in the prevalence of oral sex, especially for men.\nThese differences are consistent with previous studies\non younger age groups in both the United States (Das,\nKontula & Haavio-Mannila, 1995), which suggest that\nmasturbation among the elderly participant does not com-\npensate for a lack of \"real\" sex, with 63% of men aged\n57\u00ad64 years (those with the most partnered sex) reporting\nany masturbation in the preceding year, compared with\nFor women, the comparable figures are 32% and 16%.\nIn addition, especially among women, the sharp break\nin masturbation prevalence between those who were aged\nthe sexual revolution of the 1960s) and older groups\nseems indicative more of a cohort than age effect, consis-\ntent with previous studies on both the United States (Das,\nand Europe (Kontula & Haavio-Mannila, 2002), which\nhave also noted this break for the same cohort at younger\nages. This conclusion is also supported by our supple-\nmental analysis, which finds a weak but positive quadratic\neffect for women and a weak negative quadratic effect\namong men (both significant at p < .10), suggesting a\nsmooth decline following an initial \"hump\" around age\n60. Additionally, the NSHAP prevalence for this young-\nest group is markedly higher than among women in a\nsimilar age range in the 1992 NHSLS (Laumann et al.),\nwho came of age well before the sexual revolution, also\nsuggesting that cohort rather than biological age is the\nunderlying factor. It is possible, however, that this last\ndiscrepancy is due to a period effect (Hobcraft, Menken,\n& Preston, 1982) such that women's masturbation likeli-\nelderly women.\nTable 2.

These atti-\ntudes also depend on demographic characteristics such as race/\nNSHAP respondents were asked about their attitudes toward\nsex and sexuality in general and their attitudes about sex in\ntheir current or most recent partnership.They were asked about\nthe importance of sex in their own lives and for maintaining a\nrelationship. Both the questions on attitudes toward extramari-\ntal sex and those on values and beliefs were included in a\nleave-behind self-administered instrument only. The items on\nimportance of sex were modularized and included in the leave-\nbehind questionnaire only for respondents not on paths in\nwhich these items were asked during the interview.\nAttitudes toward sex outside marriage.--Respondents\nwere asked, \"Below is a list of statements. For each one,\nplease choose if you think this is always wrong, almost al-\nways wrong, wrong only sometimes, or not wrong at all. All\nof these statements refer to adults. A married person having\nsexual relations with someone other than their marriage\npartner? What if the spouse is in advanced stages of demen-\ntia such as Alzheimer's or other mental disease? What about\nif the spouse has a serious, long-term physical illness and\ncannot have sex?\"\nValues and beliefs.--Next, respondents were told, \"For\nthe next set of statements, choose whether you strongly\nagree, agree, disagree or strongly disagree. These are just\ngeneral statements; they are not about your specific rela-\ntionship. I would not have sex with someone unless I was in\nlove with them. My religious beliefs have shaped and guid-\ned my sexual behavior. Satisfactory sexual relations are es-\nsential to the maintenance of a relationship. The ability to\nhave sex decreases as a person grows older.\"\nImportance of sex.--Respondents were asked, \"For some\npeople sex is a very important part of their lives and for oth-\ners it is not very important at all. How important a part of\nyour life would you say sex is? Extremely important, very\nimportant, moderately important, somewhat important, not\nat all important. How often do you think about sex? Less\nthan once a month, one to a few times a month, one to a few\ntimes a week, every day, or several times a day?\" We in-\nclude in this category the question on beliefs about the im-\nportance of satisfactory sexual relations for the maintenance\nof a relationship. Respondents were also asked, \"In the past\n12 months, how often did you have sex because you felt\nobligated or it was your duty?\" with response categories\nfrom always to never.\nTable 3 shows the attitudes toward sex by age and gen-\nder, which show two general patterns, with some excep-\ntions. First, men are typically more positive about sex and\nsexual expression than women regardless of the circum-\nstances. And, second, attitudes tend to be more conserva-\ntive among older than among younger people. The\nlikelihood that both women and--to a lesser extent--men\nTable 3.

Women's likelihood of agreeing that their reli-\ngious beliefs guide their sexual behavior also increases\nsmoothly with age--in contrast to their belief in the ne-\ncessity of sex for relationship maintenance, which de-\nclines and then plateaus, as suggested by a positive\nquadratic age effect (p < .05) in our supplemental analy-\nsis. Among men, we only find a possible curvilinear pat-\ntern (p < .10) for religious beliefs guiding sex, with\nlikelihood of endorsing this item rising but then leveling\noff with age. Additionally, for both genders (p < .001), we\nfind that agreement with the statement that ability to have\nsex decreases as a person grows older increases smoothly\nwith age.\nFinally, both women and men become increasingly likely\nwith age to agree that sex is \"not at all important,\" a pattern\nwe also see for infrequent sex thoughts for women. For\nmen, however, our supplemental analysis indicates that the\nfrequency with which they report thinking about sex falls\nand then plateaus--or in other words--that there is a \"base-\nline\" for men's sexual interest, even among the oldest old.\nAmong men and women, both those with partners and those\nwith no partner, reports of any obligatory sex decline linearly\nwith age.\nSexual Attitude Scales\nExploratory factor analysis of these sexual attitudes items\nsuggested two distinct, theoretically plausible underlying\nconstructs. We used simple summary indexes, consisting\nonly of standardized versions of items loading highly on\neach factor, to capture these constructs.\nSexual Mores Scale.--The first scale, which we term\nSexual Mores, combined the three \"sex outside marriage\"\nindicators (with these three items reverse-coded, to be sub-\nstantively consistent with the construct), not having sex un-\nless in love, and religious beliefs guiding sexual behavior.\nThis index had a Cronbach's alpha coefficient of .76, with\nitem-rest correlations also high (.41\u00ad.65), suggesting good\ninternal consistency (Cronbach, 1951). Scale reliability was\nsimilarly high when the index was operationalized sepa-\nrately for women (a = .73) and men (a = .76), suggesting\nstability in this attitudinal trait across genders. With a\nweighted mean of 0.01, the scale for the full sample ran\nservative views. Based on a matrix of pairwise polychoric\ncorrelations, we also created factor scores (also running\nfrom more liberal to less liberal) for this construct through\nthe regression method, for a single factor with high loadings\n(between .53 and .91) for all five items. With a weighted\nSexual Interest Scale.--The second summary index,\nwhich we term Sexual Interest, comprised importance of\nsex and frequency of sex thoughts, with an a of .76 for the\nfull sample, .75 for women, and .69 for men, again suggest-\ning high scale reliability and stability across genders. For\nthe full sample, this scale ran from -1.53 to 2.16 (with high\nvalues denoting more sexual interest) and had a weighted\nmean of 0.05. Both the Sexual Mores Scale and the Sexual\nInterest Scale are available in the publicly available NSHAP\ndata set.\nSexual Problems\nNSHAP asked in some detail about sexual problems the\nrespondent had experienced for several months or more\nover the past year and about the problems experienced by\nthe spouse or other sexual partner (Laumann, Das, & Waite,\nin press). Respondents were also asked whether they avoided\nsex because of these problems. These questions were taken\ndirectly from the NHSLS (Laumann et al., 1994) with slight\nmodifications. If the respondent reported a problem, we\nasked the extent to which he or she was bothered by this,\nfollowing a suggestion in Basson and coworkers (2000).\nThese questions were asked only of respondents who re-\nported having had some partnered sex in the past year. Those\nwho reported no sexual activity over this period were asked\nthe reasons that they did not. These questions came from the\nCHSLS (Laumann et al., 2004). Items on reasons for not\nhaving had sex were modularized, with respondents as-\nsigned to paths in which these questions were not asked in\nthe interview receiving a self-administered leave-behind\nquestionnaire including these items. Table 4 shows preva-\nlence of sexual problems by gender and age. Table 5 pres-\nents primary reasons for not having sex by gender and age,\nseparately for those with partners (top panel) and those\nwithout partners (bottom panel).\nConsistent with previous community studies on el-\nderly individuals (Blanker et al., 2001; Feldman, Goldstein,\nHatzichristou, Crane, & McKinlay, 1994), the most com-\nmon sexual problem among men is erectile difficulty, re-\nof older men. As per our supplemental analysis, likelihood\nof experiencing erectile problems appears to level off with\nage--as evidenced by a significant (p < .05) and negative\nquadratic effect. The next most common sexual problems,\npremature climax and lack of interest in sex, are reported by\njust under 30% of the youngest men. Premature climax is\nless common among the oldest men, but lack of interest in\nsex is equally prevalent among men of all ages. (For these\nlast two problems, age is not a significant correlate.) For\nwomen, the most common sexual problem is lack of interest\nin sex, which is not significantly correlated with age and is\nreported by 38%\u00ad49% of women. Both failure to lubricate\nand inability to climax are also common, with 33%\u00ad44% of\nwomen reporting either of these problems. As with men's\nerectile problems, women's difficulties with lubrication ap-\npear to level off with age, as suggested by a weakly signifi-\ncant (p < .10) and negative quadratic effect, indicating\nperhaps a \"ceiling\"--whether biological or sociological--\nin each case. In contrast, inorgasmia seems to increase\nsteeply only among the oldest women, with a positive qua-\ndratic age effect significant (at p < .10). About a quarter of\nsexually active women report a lack of pleasure in sex, with\nthis problem uncorrelated with age.\nThose who reported at least one sexual problem were\nasked if they ever avoided sex because of the problem.\nBetween 23% and 34% of sexually active women say\nthat they had avoided sex; comparable figures for men\nare 22%\u00ad30%, with age not a significant correlate in ei-\nther case.\nOne of the most noteworthy features of reports of sexual\nproblems is their relative similarity across age groups. For\nwomen, we see few differences between age groups in the\nprevalence of any of the sexual problems we asked about\nor in the proportion who avoided sex because of the prob-\nlems. Women may cease sexual activity because of health\nor other problems as they age, but if they continue to be\nsexually active they appear not to be much more likely to\nhave problems with sexual function at older than at\nyounger ages. We see a somewhat more mixed picture for\nmen; both erectile problems and inability to climax are\nmore common at older than at younger ages, but prema-\nture climax is less common among the oldest men than\namong those who are younger. And men aged 65\u00ad74 years\nare more likely than younger men to lack pleasure in sex\nand to have avoided sex because of problems, but the old-\nest men are not. All other sexual problems are about as\nprevalent among sexually active men of all ages. Thus,\nsexually active older men seem to function at much the\nsame level as sexually active younger men, with a few\nexceptions, not all of which favor younger men.\nTable 4.

At least among those with a partner, reasons for sexual\ninactivity seem largely uncorrelated with age--although in\nour supplemental analysis, we notice positive quadratic ef-\nfects (i.e., a plateau after an initial decline) for women's\nlack of sexual interest and, complementarily, men's reports\nof their partners' lack of interest, and the inverse age pattern\n(a rise followed by a leveling off) for men's reports of their\npartners' poor physical health (p < .10 in each case). Addi-\ntionally, men's reports of their own poor physical health lead-\ning to sexual inactivity increase linearly with age (p < .05). In\nother words, for partnered women and men, when age does\ninfluence sexual inactivity at all, it is through declining phys-\nical vitality--whether one's own or a partner's--rather than\ndeclining interest.\nIn contrast, among women lacking a partner, we find a\nlinear rise in lack of interest (p < .01), coupled with linear\ndeclines in lack of opportunity and not having met the right\nperson (p < .05 for both), given as reasons for sexual inac-\ntivity. Among unpartnered men, in contrast, there is only a\nnegative quadratic age effect (p < .01) for not having met\nthe right person. In other words, a woman's lack of a partner\nseems to influence a lowering of her sexual interest itself,\nconsistent with speculations about a greater \"plasticity\" of\nman's similar lack of an intimate partner does not lower his\ninterest in finding one.\nNonsexual Intimacy\nMany older adults lack a partner with whom to have sex.\nThis is especially the case for older women. Nonsexual in-\nteractions with others, however, have a demonstrable effect\non elderly individuals' mortality and morbidity (Rasulo,\nChristensen, & Tomassini, 2005). We discuss measures\nof nonsexual intimate contact developed specifically for\nNSHAP. Respondents were asked, \"In the last 12 months,\nhow often have you engaged in the following activities?:\nPetting or touching a dog, cat or other pet? Greeting some-\none with an embrace, kiss or pat on the back? Playing or\ncuddling with a grandchild or other child? Hugging, kiss-\ning, caressing or other close physical contact with partner\n(skipped if no partner)? Hugging, kissing, caressing or other\nclose physical contact with another adult?\" Close physical\ncontact with others, then, is used as an indicator of nonsex-\nual intimacy. These questions were modularized and in-\ncluded either in the self-administered leave-behind\nquestionnaire or during the interview, depending on the path\nto which the respondent was assigned.\nTable 6 shows the prevalence of nonsexual intimacy by\nage and gender for each of these measures. The most com-\nmon type of close physical contact for both men and women\nis greeting someone with a hug or kiss; a very sizeable ma-\njority report this activity once a month or more, although\nfewer of the oldest women report this type of intimacy than\nyounger women. Specifically, our trend tests suggest that\nthis activity becomes linearly less likely as women grow\nolder (p = .001) but has no age pattern among men. Touch-\ning a pet and playing or cuddling with a grandchild or an-\nother child are also both quite common, especially among\nyounger respondents, and less so among the oldest respon-\ndents--with women's and men's reports of touching pets\nand women's cuddling of children all declining smoothly\nwith age (p < .001 in each case). Fewer adults have pets at\nolder ages, apparently, and the grandchildren of respondents\nin their 70s and 80s are probably more often teenagers or\nolder and therefore may be less inclined to be cuddled.\nClose physical contact with another adult not a partner\ndeclines linearly with age for women (p < .01), but not for\nmen, perhaps because fewer men report this activity at any\nage. We see a pattern of differentials in nonsexual intimacy\nthat mirrors differentials in sexual activity; 90% or more of\nwomen and men with a partner hug or hold that partner\nfairly often, with this likelihood declining only mildly with\nage (p < .05). But the proportion of all men and women who\nTable 6.

It is worrisome that at the same ages\nduring which older adults, especially women, have reduced\naccess to spouses or other partners they also seem to have\nreduced access to these forms of nonsexual intimacy. The\nage differences among women are especially pronounced.\nThese patterns may reflect differences across cohorts in the\ntypes of intimacy with which people feel comfortable; they\nmay also reflect changes in expressions of intimacy over the\nlife course.\nIt would be convenient both analytically and conceptu-\nally to create a single measure of nonsexual intimacy. How-\never, the items in Table 6 do not form a single scale, and we\nwere unsuccessful in attempts to create subscales.\nRelationship Quality\nSexual expression is both a component and a consequence\nof the satisfaction that the partners feel with the relation-\nship. Respondents were asked the extent to which they like\nto spend time with their partner. They were also asked how\noften: they can open up to him or her about worries, they\ncan rely on the partner, the partner makes too many de-\nmands, or the partner criticizes. Respondents were also\nasked to rate the quality of their relationships and how emo-\ntionally and physically satisfying they find their relation-\nship with their partner to be. Respondents were also asked\nabout satisfaction with the frequency of sex with the part-\nner. We develop and evaluate measures of relationship qual-\nity in NSHAP, shown in Table 7.\nMost women and men say that they can often open up to\ntheir partner about worries and can rely on the partner. No\nmore than about 1 in 10 thinks the partner often makes too\nmany demands or often criticizes. Few people evaluate their\nmost recent relationship as unhappy, not emotionally satis-\nfying, not physically satisfying, or involving more sex than\nthe person would like. With the exception of being able to\nopen up to the partner among men (p < .05) and reliance\nupon the partner among women (p < .10), both of which\ndecline smoothly as a person gets older, none of these indi-\ncators seem to be patterned by age.\nRelationship Satisfaction Scale.--As with sexual atti-\ntudes, we investigated the scaling potential of these items,\nwith exploratory factor analysis suggesting a theoretically\nplausible latent construct comprising happiness in the re-\nlationship as well as emotional and physical satisfaction in the\nrelationship. We created a summary index for standardized\nvalues of these three items, which we term Relationship\nSatisfaction. Cronbach's alpha for this scale was .80 (.82 for\nwomen and .74 for men), suggesting high scale reliability.\nto 0.98, with high values indicating more satisfaction. The\nRelationship Satisfaction Scale is included in the publicly\navailable data set.\nDiscussion\nPartnered sex requires two people who are willing and\nable to participate. As men and women age, their spouses or\nother partners tend to age too, altering the dyad within which\nsexuality is expressed. The NSHAP can be used to construct\nkey measures of sexuality among older adults. In addition,\nNSHAP data contain detailed measures of the relationship\ncontext in which this behavior may occur. The data contain\na good deal of information about current marital, cohabiting\nand romantic relationships, and link sexual behavior to\na specific relationship. NSHAP contains information on\nTable 7.

Although\nwe do not report these data here, respondents were asked the\nsame questions about sexual problems that their spouse or\npartner was experiencing as about their own. Respondents\nalso rated their own physical and emotional health and that\nof their spouse or partner. And they provided ratings of their\nrelationship across a range of dimensions. The rich and de-\ntailed information on both partners allows researchers to\ncontextualize sexuality at older ages within relationships, as\ndo respondents' evaluations of the relationship itself.\nDimensions of sexuality lie at the heart of the NSHAP\ndata. But the data also contain detailed, innovative, and rich\nmeasures of physical health, physiological functioning,\nemotional well-being, social networks, illness, and disease.\nThese measures are discussed in detail elsewhere in this\nvolume. Together, data on sexuality and on many factors\nlinked to sexual behavior, sexual partnerships, sexual atti-\ntudes, and sexual problems allow researchers to examine\nsexuality itself and to explore the link between sexuality,\nhealth, well-being, and other dimensions of the lives of\nolder adults.\nFunding\nPrincipal Investigator, from the National Institutes of Health, including the\nOffice of Behavioral and Social Research, National Institute on Aging, the\nOffice of Research on Women's Health, the Office of AIDS Research, and\nthe Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research, and by NORC,\nwhose staff was responsible for all field activities.\n"
