The frequency\nrange at autopsy had been 0.2-9.9%, with a mean of\napproximately 5%, suggesting that among the United\nStates population alone, approximately 11 million per-\nsons have or will have intracranial aneurysms. Second,\nthe mean age of the population is increasing, and intra-\ncranial aneurysms appear to develop with increasing\nage.7 The incidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage from\nan intracranial aneurysm also increases progressively\nwith age.8 Finally, in recent years, the widespread use of\ncomputed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging\nhead scans as well as magnetic resonance angiography910\nhas greatly increased the capacity for noninvasive and\nincidental diagnosis of intracranial aneurysms.\nWe sought in this study to document the magnitude of\nthe problem of unruptured intracranial aneurysms in\nthe United States.\nSubjects and Methods\nThe National Hospital Discharge Survey (NHDS) for\nthe United States is a survey of discharges from short-\nFrom the Department of Neurology (D.O.W., I.M.), Mayo\nClinic and Mayo Foundation, Rochester, Minn., and the Depart-\nment of Preventive Medicine and Environmental Health (J.C.T.),\nUniversity of Iowa, Iowa City.\nAddress for reprints: David O.

We reviewed the data for the\nsheet and medical summary of sampled medical records\nwere the source documents for the data used in the\nsubmitted data in machine-readable form.13 During this\nperiod, the information was coded according to the\nInternational Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision\n(ICD-9).14 Patients with primary or secondary diag-\nnoses of unruptured intracranial aneurysm were used in\nthis study (ICD-9 code 437.3). Cost estimates for this\nanalysis included the direct costs of hospitalization\nper patient) and the cost of surgery for those who had\nsurgery (estimated at $11,000). Length of hospital stay\nestimates were derived from NHDS data, with separate\ndeterminations for patients with subarachnoid hemor-\nrhage and those with unruptured intracranial aneurysm\nas the primary diagnosis. The frequency of surgery was\nestimated at 35% of patients hospitalized based on the\nusual practice of 40 centers in the United States,\naccording to a questionnaire survey conducted in 1989.\nThe cost of morbidity was expressed both in terms of\nlost income and the cost of disability, and morbidity was\nyears, and >65 years. Patients in group 1 had an\nestimated survival of 25 years; patients in group 2, 15\nyears; and patients in group 3, 5 years. The morbidity\nwas based on an operative morbidity figure of 6%,\nwhich is compatible with prior clinical series reporting\noperative morbidity and mortality for unruptured intra-\ncranial aneurysms.15\"21 Severe disability from surgery\nincome from disability and mortality was calculated as\nhttp://stroke.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\nWiebers et al Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysms 1417\nPatients (Thousands) Cost (Millions Dollars)\nISAH ] Unruptured Aneurysm I 1 Aneurysm Clipping\nFIGURE 1.

The overall\nnumber of cases of subarachnoid hemorrhage was mul-\ntiplied by 0.75 because as many as 25% of patients with\nsubarachnoid hemorrhage may have another source,\nsuch as an arteriovenous malformation or an unknown\nsource. Direct hospital costs were estimated as $1,500 a\nday for a mean of 18 days, and an estimated 25% of\npatients underwent surgical clipping.822 For the costs of\nmorbidity and mortality, the same age groups of pa-\ntients were used with estimates of overall morbidity,\nfor age groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and serious\ndisability of 4% in all age groups.23 Overall mortality by\ntively, based on prior results from the Cooperative\nAneurysm study23 and population-based experience.8\nThe number of patients by age group with unruptured\nand ruptured aneurysms was based on prior clinical\nResults\nFigure 1 illustrates the numbers of patients with\nsubarachnoid hemorrhage, unruptured intracranial an-\neurysms, and aneurysmal clipping according to NHDS\nreflect the economic impact of unruptured intracranial\naneurysms and aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage,\nrespectively.\nWe used a conservative estimate of 10,300 patients\nhospitalized annually with unruptured intracranial aneu-\nsurvey years.

Bar graph showing lifetime costs for patients\nhospitalized in the United States with ruptured and unrup-\ntured intracranial aneurysms.\nDiscussion\nThe NHDS data subsequent to 1989 were not\navailable at the time of this study. Although ongoing\ntechnological developments such as high-resolution\nmagnetic resonance and magnetic resonance angiog-\nraphy are providing much more powerful tools for\nmaking the diagnosis of unruptured intracranial aneu-\nrysms as small as 3 mm in diameter,9 the impact of\nthese technologies may not be fully reflected in NHDS\ndata. Because only hospitalized patients are included\nin the NHDS, these data undoubtedly underestimate\nthe impact of patients with unruptured intracranial\naneurysms. This underestimation may be more pro-\nnounced in the future if more patients are studied and\nfollowed with outpatient technologies.\nAn additional consideration regarding the impact of\nunruptured intracranial aneurysms involves patients\nwith future rupture from undipped aneurysms. Such\npatients would be included in subsequent NHDS data\nunder the classification of subarachnoid hemorrhage.\nThe overall cost for these subsequent ruptures is esti-\nyear and current cost estimates, as presented in \"Sub-\njects and Methods.\" This number suggests that approx-\nimately 1/10 of the impact of subarachnoid hemorrhage\nderives from previously identified unruptured intracra-\nnial aneurysms.\nBecause this study is predicated on several assump-\ntions, a sensitivity analysis was conducted by varying\nseveral parameters, including incidence rates, morbidity\nand mortality from surgery and subarachnoid hemor-\nrhage, surgical rates, length of hospital stay, and life\nexpectancy, to illustrate the effect such variation would\nhave on the total cost estimates (Table 3).\nDespite convincing evidence for an overall decrease\napparent change in incidence or age at onset of sub-\nmortality from subarachnoid hemorrhage showed a\ndecreasing trend for this period,27 the change was only\nmarginally significant. The lack of significant declines in\nincidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage relates at least\nin part to an inability to identify and properly manage\nrisk factors.
