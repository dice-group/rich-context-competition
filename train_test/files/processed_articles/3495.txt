Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC)\napps are a common form of AAC interventions that involve a combination of affordable technology with software that\ncan be utilized to assist with communication.

The rates of diagnosing ASD are rapidly\ngrowing among individuals across continents, races, ethnic\nbackgrounds, and socio-economic statuses (Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention, 2012). ASD is character-\nized by communication difficulties, repetitive behaviors,\nand impairments in social interaction (American Psychiatric\nAssociation, 2000; National Institute of Neurological\nDisorders and Stroke, 2012). Although these three impair-\nments occur in children diagnosed with ASD, they exist in\nvarying degrees, and not every child on the spectrum has the\nsame challenges. Despite these variations, difficulty or\ndelayed language is often a core component of ASD and can\nhave a significant effect on various aspects of a child's life.\nCommunication has a multi-modal presence and affects\nan individual's ability to function in their environment. It is\nestimated that 25% of children with ASD could be classified\nas nonverbal or unable to express their daily needs (Scott,\nClark, & Brady, 2000). The National Research Council\n(2001) identified developing spontaneous communication as\nan important skill for children with ASD, highlighting the\nsignificance of communication skills for children on the\nspectrum. Children with ASD are often mainstreamed in\nthey may not be provided with the individual attention neces-\nsary to help them be successful in school. Communication\nimpairment is a key factor in the child's ability to learn. The\nclassroom has been a common setting where communication\ninterventions for children with ASD are often applied, and in\nthe past 50 years, different types of interventions have been\nimplemented in an effort to meet the varying and complex\ncommunication needs of children with ASD.\nHistory of Augmentative and\nAlternative Communication (AAC) for\nAutism Spectrum Disorders\nThe American Speech-Language-Hearing Association\ndefines AAC as an area of clinical practice that assists indi-\nviduals with severe communication disorders compensate\nfor their impairments (National Joint Committee for the\n1Old Dominion University, Norfolk, VA, USA\n2Tookty\u00ae LLC, Norfolk, VA, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nMargaret Lubas, College of Health Sciences, Old Dominion University,\nUser-Centered Design and Augmentative\nand Alternative Communication Apps\nfor Children With Autism Spectrum\nDisorders\nMargaret Lubas1, Jennifer Mitchell1,2, and Gianluca De Leo1,2\n Keywords\nautism spectrum disorders, AAC apps, user-centered design\n2 SAGE Open\nCommunication Needs of Persons With Severe Disabilities,\n1992). AAC interventions can range from no tech to high\ntech and can vary greatly based on their intended purpose.\nThe first attempts in augmenting the communication ability\nof individuals with ASD began in a non-technological man-\nner, with pictures and symbols. Since the 1970s, parents and\nspecial education teachers encouraged the use of sign lan-\nguage and symbols to communicate (Mirenda & Erickson,\nings became the symbols of choice (Ogletree & Harn, 2001),\nand the Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS)\nwas developed as a multi-phase AAC intervention to help\nindividuals with ASD communicate (Bondy & Frost, 2001).\nPicture-based communication approaches (such as PECS),\nwere preferred because pictures are not transient and stay in\nthe visual field for a longer processing time. Research stud-\nies have demonstrated the value of PECS, showing that utili-\nzation of the system improved functional aspects of\ncommunication and communication initiations in children\nwith ASD (Carr & Felce, 2007; Flippin, Reszka, & Watson,\nDespite the benefits of PECS, there were barriers that\ncould be improved upon. For instance, the number of pic-\ntures needed as a child's language base grew, and the time\nconsumed to create and store these laminated images began\nto place logistical limits on the value of PECS. In utilizing\nthis system, it could be difficult to maintain the increasing\nnumber of images, and instructors had no way to track these\nimages and monitor the progress of a child. Out of this need\nand the improving technological capabilities, AAC tech-\nnologies have emerged as tools to help address the com-\nmunication challenges that many individuals with autism\nexperience (Lubas, Mitchell, & De Leo, 2014; Shane et al.,\n2012). The first use of AAC technologies came in the form\nof AAC devices, instruments with pre-loaded software\nexisting strictly for communication purposes. By the early\n1990s, AAC devices were introduced into classrooms\n(Hourcade, Pilotte, West, & Parette, 2004; Ogletree &\nHarn, 2001), and their presence could be seen as an attempt\nto use technology to improve on current communication\ninterventions. AAC devices were intended to replace\nprinted pictures, but despite this intention, they were\nextremely expensive, difficult to program or personalize,\nnot flexible enough to accommodate needs, and stigmatiz-\ning (Shane et al., 2012). Despite their technological\nimprovement, there were still several barriers that pre-\nvented individuals from using these systems on a regular\nbasis. These challenges could impede both parents and\nschool systems from adopting this technology. While it\nseemed that parents and special education teachers believed\nthat AAC devices were the solution for children with mini-\nmal communication skills, they would need to find funding\nand learn the skills to use them (De Leo, Gonzales, Battagiri,\nIn an effort to harness the value of an AAC device, but to\nproduce a more convenient and affordable tool, AAC apps\nwere created. AAC apps involve the combination of afford-\nable technology with software that can be utilized to assist\nwith communication (Lubas et al., 2014). Smartphones and\ntablets are types of technology that have multiple functions\n(such as the ability to be used as a phone or computer) but\ncan be utilized to assist with communication. As technology\ncontinues to grow and becomes more affordable, so does the\nuse and function of AAC apps. In February 2014, the Apple\nStore had listed more than 250 apps under the keyword\n\"AAC\" ranging from free to a maximum of a few hundred\nlion iPhones, and 71 million iPads, both of which demon-\ntechnology continues to become more affordable and avail-\nable, its presence is greatly increasing in society today. It is\nnot uncommon for individuals or families to have several\nmobile devices, and the function of these devices continue to\nserve multiple purposes, increasing the opportunity for the\nuse of AAC apps.\nImpact of AAC Interventions\nDespite the increasing presence of AAC apps, even with the\navailability of a technological solution that is easy to use,\naffordable, and flexible, a large number of individuals with\ncommunication needs are still not learning how to communi-\ncate (Mirenda, 2001). With the continued growth of AAC\napps, there is a need to examine the impact of these interven-\ntions. Currently, some research supports the value of AAC\ntechnologies, as Lal (2010) found that children who are min-\nimally verbal will increase language skills when using AAC\ntechnologies. Studies have also verified the long-term out-\ncomes of AAC use, demonstrating improvements in the\nusers' functional communication (Hunt-Berg, 2005; Lund &\nLight, 2006). A recent meta-analysis by Ganz, Earles-\nVollrath, et al. (2012) found that research evidence supports\nthe overall impact of AAC technologies on targeted behav-\nioral outcomes, primarily communication skills. It seems\npossible that such technology is providing movement in the\nright direction; however, these interventions have not had the\nimpact on children with ASD that they were anticipated to\nhave (Mirenda, 2001). Although research has shown support\nfor the use of AAC technologies for children with ASD\nthat current AAC research for individuals with autism is\nlacking and may not be sufficient enough to inform the\nimpact of AAC use on communicative capabilities (Mirenda,\n2001). The research in the field that has been conducted is\noften comprised of single subject designs, and also lacks\nthorough descriptions of the participant demographics and\nenvironmental context of AAC use (Ganz, Earles-Vollrath,\nLubas et al. 3\n2007). In addition to this, current studies are often done in\ncontrolled and \"ideal settings,\" which could impede transla-\ntion of findings to real-world settings (Lund & Light, 2007).\nDespite the increase in available apps for AAC, there is a\nsignificant lack of attention given to the process of app\ndevelopment. In particular, it is essential that developers use\ntechnology to create new interventions that improve on past\nwork, and not just re-create past interventions in the form of\nan app (Light & McNaughton, 2012). A potential response to\nthese obstacles are to develop AAC apps through a user-cen-\ntered design approach, with the intended users providing\nfeedback throughout the software development process. If\nthe proposed users (such as nonverbal children with ASD)\nwould be unable to participate in the design process, this\napproach can also use proxies, individuals authorized to rep-\nresent or speak on behalf of another person. Often when soft-\nware (such as an app) is being developed, the intended users\ndo not have a role in the design process, and this can signifi-\ncantly impair the value of software. Implementing user feed-\nback throughout the software design process can have an\nimpact on the user's comfort level with the technology, atti-\ntude toward the technology, and ultimately influence their\ncompetency and success. A user-centered design approach\ncan be an important mechanism for increasing the positive\noutcomes of AAC app use. In the following sections, we\npresent an overview of the different steps in a user-centered\ndesign process, and provide a step-by-step example of an\nAAC app that was created through this design approach.\nMethod of User-Centered Design\nUser needs are a fundamental aspect of any product. The\nuser-centered design approach involves the creation of a\nproduct that incorporates user-centered activities throughout\nthe entire development process. This process involves iden-\ntifying the intended users, their capabilities, needs, and\nexpectations. A user-centered design addresses the envi-\nsioned goals that are to be met by the user through the soft-\nware interaction, the tasks needed to achieve the goals, and\nalso the environments (both physical and social) that the user\ninteracts with in order to achieve such (Hall, 2001). For this\ninsight to be achieved, users must participate in the develop-\nment process both through designing and testing the new\ntechnology.\nOne of the central components in the user-centered design\nis the use of prototype creation. Prototyping is a quick way to\nincorporate user feedback into the design process. Prototypes\ncan vary on their fidelity level (how close they are to the\nactual product). Conceptual prototypes can start off low in\nfidelity, but allow users to provide feedback on the cognitive\nand visual aspects of a design. The initial prototype for the\nuser-centered design often first involves a paper version.\nThis approach is recommended due to its simplicity and fast\nturn around. A paper prototype allows individuals to contrib-\nute regardless of their technological capabilities, where an\noperational design could be limiting if not everyone had a\nbasic understanding of the technological system being used.\nAnother benefit is that changes can be made quickly on\npaper, and that starting with a paper prototype allows indi-\nviduals the freedom to be more critical (Andrews et al., 2012;\nKlee, 2000). Conceptual prototypes can increase fidelity\nthrough the creation of \"mock-ups\" that present a more\ndynamic visual representation of the final product, but one\nthat is still not operational. Operational prototypes, high in\nfidelity, can then be created to allow users to test the func-\ntionality of the product. The user-centered design process\ndoes not specifically dictate how many and what types of\nprototypes must be created, but requires that user involve-\nment occurs at every level of product development.\nA user-centered design can be an extremely valuable\napproach to AAC app development, as it allows the user to\nprovide feedback and input throughout the development pro-\ncess. The method of a user-centered design is characterized\nby a multi-stage process that allows input and feedback, as\nthe developers create the product (Andrews, et al., 2012; De\nbeen used with success in different types of technological\nproducts such as website development (Andrews et al.,\n2012), the creation of virtual environments (Fidopaistis,\nRizzo, & Rolland, 2010), and in interactive health technolo-\nAAC Apps and the User-Centered Design\nWhen specifically addressing AAC app development, there\nare additional considerations of the design process. After the\ndevelopers determine the intended users of the app (if the app\nwill be age specific, diagnosis specific, or can be used across\ndifferent demographics), a group of users can work with\ndevelopers to inform the design. An initial determination will\nneed to be made in the method of communication, as an AAC\napp can vary in this aspect. Text-based input methods allow\nfor the creation of messages through typing or combining\nwords. This method results in a strong and clear content of\nmessages, but can be a slow process for communication.\nGraphic-based methods allow for the creation of messages\nthrough combining symbols and images, and can often then\nbe translated into speech. This type of communication affords\nindividuals who lack language literacy the ability to commu-\nnicate; however, the content and clarity of messages are often\nlimiting (Gonzales, Leroy, & De Leo, 2009). There are pros\nand cons of both input methods, and a combination of the two\ncan also be used. Determining the modality of communica-\ntion is an important step in AAC app development, and such\ndecision should be based on the capabilities of the intended\nuser. From there, interviews should take place with users or\nrelevant professionals who can inform the initial design idea.\nThen, a multi-stage prototype and user testing process occurs\nto receive continual user feedback on features and capabilities\nof the software. The steps involved in this process are as\n4 SAGE Open\nfollows: (a) determine the intended user of the software; (b)\ninterviewing users (or proxies) to inform the initial design; (c)\ncreation of the prototype; (d) a multi-stage process of user (or\nproxy) prototype testing; and (e) creation of a final product.\nThe user-centered design process integrates feedback from\nthe user (or proxies) at every stage in the development of the\nsoftware; this process is displayed in Figure 1.\nThe user-centered design process is linear; however, the\nconcept is multi-dimensional. Depending on the product and\nuser population, the process should be adapted to the context\nof the purpose and type of software being developed. In the\nfollowing section, we will provide a step-by-step example of\nthe user-centered (by proxy) design process used to develop\nan AAC app for children with communication impairments\nas a result of ASD. Specific considerations of the user-cen-\ntered design as it relates to an AAC app for children ASD\nwill also be addressed.\nAn AAC App Designed Through the User\nCentered by Proxy Design\nTo further demonstrate the user-centered by proxy design,\nthis process will be illustrated by addressing the develop-\nment of an AAC app, called I Click I Talk.1 The five-step\nprocess in the user-centered design approach is explained in\ndetail in the following sections.\nStep 1: Identify intended user. The first step in the user-cen-\ntered design process is to identify the user of the software.\nThe intended users of this specific AAC app are children\nwith communication impairments due to ASD. In this case,\nbecause the intended users have severe communication\nimpairments, this design approach requires a proxy, as the\nchildren with severe ASD are unable to verbally communi-\ncate their feedback. In the case of this software development,\nspecial education teachers, parents, and therapists were used\nas proxies to the target population. A child with severe ASD\nwould utilize an AAC app with assistance from an adult (typ-\nically a teacher, parent, or therapist); therefore, it was rea-\nsonable to consider that these adults would be a valuable\nsource of information during the design process. In addition\nto identifying features that would benefit the children, prox-\nies could also inform aspects that affected their own user\ninterface with the app.\nStep 2: Interviews to inform the initial design. The initial design\nof an AAC app should be created after obtaining feedback\nfrom parents, therapists, and teachers regarding their needs\nand desired functions of a communication app for children\nwith ASD. Throughout this process, individuals can identify\nmany unique needs and desired capabilities of the software.\nBased on the initial interviews of I Click I Talk, it was clear\nthat an app with several customizable features would be ben-\neficial, as every child with ASD and their learning environ-\nment is unique. An example of the importance of\ncustomization is first reflected in the communication method\nof the app. It was initially determined that a graphic-based\ncommunication method would be used in the app, as children\nwith severe communication impairments would not initially\nbe able to communicate through text only. However, soft-\nware should be adaptable to multiple purposes and custom-\nized features should be considered to adapt for different user\nneeds. Therefore, after the feedback, a combination of\ngraphic- and text-based input methods were utilized to pro-\nvide an optimal learning environment for language develop-\nment for each individual user. With the users, goals, and\nbasic communication method identified, the next step in the\ndevelopment process was to create prototypes to continue to\ninform and improve on the design.\nSteps 3 and 4: Prototype creation and user (by proxy) test-\ning.Steps 3 and 4 were combined in discussion, because\nthey involve an integrative loop of prototype development\nand user testing. From the information obtained in the initial\ninterviews a prototype was created, and then special educa-\ntion teachers from public and private schools throughout\nNorth America reviewed this prototype to provide feedback\nthat led to the continuous refinement of the software through\nsemi-structured interviews. The software was developed\nover an iterative process of several interactive prototyping\nstages, with users or proxies visually reviewing and then\neventually testing the software throughout the development.\nThe first prototype (Figure 2) created was a simple paper\ndrawing of the communication screen that the child and adult\nwould most often interface with when using the app. The\npaper prototype showed the general layout of the app, with\nthe lists of word and image categories present on the left-\nhand side, a central display of images for a child to choose\nfrom (based on the category selected), and a sentence strip\nFigure 1. Steps in the user-centered design process.\nLubas et al. 5\nwhere these images could be moved after they were selected\nfor communication.\nAfter each prototype continued to progress, user feedback\nwas utilized to inform the next version. The paper prototype\nwas adjusted several times to reflect proxy feedback, and\nthen a mock-up was created. The mock-up (seen in Figure 3)\nconsisted of a series of photographic images of screens and\ninterfaces. This was a non-functional series of photographic\nimages of the layout for the app. The mock-up was another\nconceptual prototype; however, it offered increased fidelity\nof the intended layout.\nAfter the proxies provided feedback on the mock-up, an\noperational prototype was created, where proxies began to\ndemo the app. The operational prototype was refined several\ntimes based on feedback, again through semi-structured\ninterviews. Overall, the feedback provided by the teachers\nduring the design process was twofold. First, they offered\ndesign assistance from their perspective, addressing the need\nfor an AAC app to optimize the use of their time, by allowing\nfor multiple children to utilize the same app, yet still allow\nfor individual customization. Second, teachers served as\nproxy users for the children with autism, addressing the\nstrengths and limitations of the children they work with.\nTable 1 serves as summary of key features of I Click I Talk\nthat developed out of the user centered by proxy design.\nStep 5: Final product. The result of this user-centered design\napproach was a highly customizable app, allowing individual\nusers to select features based on their unique needs and pur-\nposes. After a final product is created, developers can some-\ntimes overlook a very important aspect of the process, which\nis addressing the dissemination and evaluation of the prod-\nuct. In the first step of disseminating the product, the app was\nmade available to purchase online through avenues such as\nthe Apple and Android stores. In addition to the mechanism\nto purchase the app, in this instance an auxiliary website was\ncreated to serve as a user support to the software. The goal of\nthe auxiliary website was to provide information on the fea-\ntures of the app. The website also provides information on\nusing the software, video tutorials, and offers a contact\nsource for those who would be interested in additional train-\ning. A local dissemination approach was also enacted, as the\ndevelopers reached out to local school districts and agencies\nthat provided services for children with ASD. Local trainings\nwere offered to assist teachers and other professionals in\nlearning the features of I Click I Talk.\nAlthough evaluation is not a distinct step in the process of\nthe user-centered design, it can also be useful to address. It is\nimportant that efforts be made to verify the benefit of this\napproach. An attempt (although unsuccessful) to evaluate\nthis app was made. A web-based survey was developed to\nassess user feedback for I Click I Talk. The survey was made\navailable through the app website and its Facebook page for\napproximately 4 months from January to April 2013.\nParticipation in the survey was voluntary, and served as an\nopportunity for the purchaser of the app to provide direct\nfeedback regarding the design and capabilities of the soft-\nware. The results of the survey could not be considered con-\nclusive due to the small sample size. Despite the survey\nbeing made available for 4 months, it was only completed by\n10 participants (over 3,000 copies of the app have been sold,\ntherefore the completed surveys reflect less than 1% of\nusers).\nDiscussion\nAlthough more evaluative studies on the clinical outcomes\nof AAC apps are needed, research has pointed toward the\nimportance of the user and technology interface in regard to\nthis relationship. In the research that has shown communica-\ntive improvements, Lund and Light (2007) suggest that\nalthough studies have evaluated the clinical efficiency of\nAAC technologies, many studies validate AAC use under the\nideal and controlled circumstances. Studies have revealed\ngeneral improvements in communication through the use of\nAAC technologies, but research has also found that improve-\nments are not equal across all individuals, and suggests that\nsome benefit from AAC use more than others (Lund & Light,\n2006). In an effort to further examine the impact of AAC\ntechnologies, Lund and Light looked at factors that influ-\nenced positive outcomes on AAC use. Through their research\nthey identified three general themes that improved outcomes\nof AAC use: social support, personal characteristics (of the\nuser), and services. Social support has had a positive influ-\nencing role in AAC outcomes through the role of parents and\neducators who can encourage the use of the technology.\nPersonal characteristics were also found to be associated\nwith outcomes, primarily in the sense that the users' attitudes\nand positive expectations influenced the success of the indi-\nvidual user. Finally, the influencing role of services refers to\nadditional training methods of the technology that are avail-\nable for families and facilitators to improve their interface\nFigure 2. Image of the initial paper prototype.\n6 SAGE Open\nwith the software. These three distinct themes found by Lund\nand Light (2007) point to one commonality, the importance\nof user and software interaction.\nIn light of the current limitations in AAC research, the\ndesign process may be an important avenue that can help\nlead to the creation of valuable AAC apps. Light and\nMcNaughton (2013) suggest that current AAC delivery\ncomes from a skewed focus of over-emphasizing the service\ndelivery system and not users. This is an important point to\naddress, as the user-centered design process allows the users\n(or proxies) to inform capabilities of AAC apps that they\ndesire, and also attempts to increase the user's competency\nin interacting with the technology. The mere presence of\ntechnology is not a simple solution in directly improving\nAAC outcomes (Light & McNaughton, 2013), yet if\napproached correctly it can be a useful avenue to further\nengage and highlight the needs of the user. Feature matching\nis a significant component of AAC use (Beukelman &\nMirenda, 2013), and utilizing the process of a user-centered\ndesign approach in developing an AAC app for children with\nASD can bring to light important considerations in matching\nthe design process to specific user populations. This process\ncan also address the need for making new AAC apps flexible\nenough to be customized for every child's unique learning\nneeds. Gosnell, Costello, and Shane (2011) highlight the\nimportance of using a clinical framework when selecting the\nTable 1. Features of I Click I Talk That Resulted From the User-Centered Design Process.\nFeature Description\nMulti-student user Teachers or professionals can choose a multi-student user, and manage several students from one app. Even if\nmanaging several students from one app, each student to be customized based on individual needs.\nNavigation set-up The app users can choose to customize features of basic navigation design. Users can choose the order and\nplacement of word categories, whether or not they utilize the sentence strip, and adjust the overall layout.\nCustomization of\nsymbols and images\nThe app features a system of highly customizable system of images. Images within I Click I Talk can be\ncustomized based on the needs, interest, and preferences of the child. Images can include text or no text, they\ncan be clipart or real pictures, and this option is up to the changing need of the child. Images from the internet\nor personal photographs can be uploaded; users also have access to a web library of images. Images can be re-\nsized (for those with visual impairments) and cropped.\nAbility to create\nactivities\nUser's can create their own activities or games to be used within the app. This feature allows teachers to\ndevelop educational lessons within the app to further facilitate teaching language skills.\nUser-focused website An auxiliary website outlining features and uses of the app. The website also offers video training tutorials for\nseveral features such as image manipulation, creating activities, interacting with the main interface, and the\nimage use analysis to just name a few.\nAudio Ability to use recorded voice only (this serves an important purpose as feedback from speech and language\npathologists addressed that computer-generated audio can sometimes compromise the meaning of the\nlanguage). This feature also allows the app to be used in foreign languages (Figure 4).\nFigure 3. Mock up of I Click I Talk that shows a series of intended screens of the app.\nFigure 4. A screenshot of the main interface of I Click I Talk\nthat is written in Czech language.\nLubas et al. 7\nappropriate communication apps, given the large number of\navailable apps. This concept further lends itself to the impor-\ntance that the creation of new AAC apps serve as meaningful\nadditions based on user needs, which again can be addressed\nby a user-centered design process. In addition to the primary\nuser's needs, AAC apps for children with autism can also be\nused by teachers, parents, and applied behavior analysis\n(ABA) therapists, so it is important to include their feedback\nat all levels, as they assist the child with utilizing the soft-\nware. Figure 5 adapts the user-centered design approach spe-\ncifically to the context of designing communication software\nfor children with ASD.\nWhen creating AAC apps for children with autism, con-\nsideration should include a multi-disciplinary approach to\nuser-centered design. Different types of specialists (thera-\npists and teachers) and parents should be used to inform the\ndesign process. It is also important for communication-based\nsoftware to have the ability to be used in a variety of settings\nin the child's life, as a child with severe communication\nimpairments would need to utilize AAC apps in home,\nschool, and recreational settings. As the setting may vary, the\nAAC app will likely be utilized by more than one type of\nassisting adult, which is why it is important that feedback be\nprovided from various types of professionals and parents. In\naddition to the use of AAC apps by both professionals and\nparents of children with ASD, it also important to acknowl-\nedge that these technologies are utilized all over the world.\nTherefore, the user-centered design process should provide\nthe opportunity for AAC apps to be used by individuals who\nspeak different languages, and to even allow for customiza-\ntion of regional language needs. After users or proxies have\ninformed the software design process, the goal of the final\nproduct should be to serve a current unmet need in AAC\napps. Once finalized, developers must then consider how to\ndisseminate and market their product, and what type of aux-\niliary tool will be provided to assist in the use of their AAC\napp. Although this article and several others promote the\nuser-centered design approach as a valuable method of prod-\nBalandi, O'Mara, & Judson, 2005); more research must be\ndone to determine this and evaluation of such software\nshould be conducted.\nWith an attempt at evaluation, it was found that it was\ndifficult to collect feedback from app users after they have\npurchased the app; therefore, future app development might\nconsider the use of data collection built within the app, or\nother features to track app usage. The low response rate\n(n = 10) of this survey could have occurred out of many\nreasons. First the sampling approach used. App users would\nonly have been aware of this survey if they utilized the\nFacebook page or website, as a link to the survey was only\navailable on these pages and not directly available on the\napp (if users purchased the app more than 2 years ago, they\nmay not be still actively utilizing the website). Another sig-\nnificant barrier in obtaining results from this survey could\nbe the lack of interest. It is common for professionals (such\nas speech\u00adlanguage pathologists, or special education\nteachers) to change the AAC apps they are using frequently.\nWhen a consumer buys an app, they are limited to the cre-\nated capabilities of it, meaning that after the app is on the\nmarket developers often do not take feedback and make\nchanges or improvements. Because of this, when a profes-\nsional buys an app if it does not fully meet their needs, they\nmay quickly move on to another. This potentially speaks to\nthe importance of developers to take user feedback into\nconsideration during the design process, as after a final\nproduct is created it will be too late. Although the survey\nwas not successful in obtaining feedback after the develop-\nment of I Click I Talk, future research on AAC apps should\nattempt to assess the impact of the user-centered design on\nuser communicative capabilities, and on the self-reported\ncompetencies of software users.\nFigure 5. The user-centered design process specific to an AAC app for children with ASD.\n8 SAGE Open\nConclusion\nWith the increasing presence of affordable AAC apps, it is\nimportant that new apps are created with a purpose, rather\nthan continuing to flood the market. When creating AAC\napps for children with ASD, a user-centered by proxy\ndesign can help shed light on the needs for an app that does\nnot currently exist, or highlight features that are currently\neffective. As technology becomes increasingly accessible,\nthere are opportunities for non-software developers to cre-\nate their own apps, and there are several apps on the market\nthat have been created by teachers and parents of children\nwith ASD (Light & McNaughton, 2012). This can be a sig-\nnificant benefit in the market; however, just as professional\nsoftware developers; parents and other non-professionals\ncould benefit from the user-centered design approach. It is\na significant strength that there are several AAC apps avail-\nable to choose from, and many different groups of individu-\nals who have created such. However, a challenge with this\nis that it can be difficult for parents and professionals to\nchoose the appropriate app (if any) to meet their child's\nneed (Bradshaw, 2013). It is not necessary that more apps\nneed to be available for unique AAC users, it is that current\napps must be better designed to maximize communication\nimprovements for a wide range of users with diverse needs\n(Light & McNaughton, 2012). Utilizing a user-centered\ndesign approach can allow parents and professionals to pro-\nvide their insight and feedback into the new AAC apps\nbeing developed to address any current unmet needs on the\nmarket. Until more research is conducted on the outcomes\nof AAC apps for children with ASD, the user-centered\ndesign process may be a good approach in improving AAC\napps and attempting to bridge the gap of user interface with\nthe software. Successful AAC use not only involves the\navailability of technology, but must also address feature\nmatching, and appropriate instructional approaches.\nTherefore, the use of a design process that takes into\naccount both user and instructor needs can be a very valu-\nable process when informing future software.\n"
