    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: Attributable fractions (AF) assess the proportion of cases in a population\nattributable to certain risk factors but are infrequently reported and mostly calculated without\nconsidering potential confounders. While logistic regression for adjusted individual estimates of\nodds ratios (OR) is widely used, similar approaches for AFs are rarely applied.\nMethods: Different methods for calculating adjusted AFs to risk factors of cardiovascular disease\n(CVD) were applied using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES). We compared AFs from the unadjusted approach using Levin's formula, from Levin's\nformula using adjusted OR estimates, from logistic regression according to Bruzzi's approach, from\nlogistic regression with sequential removal of risk factors ('sequential AF') and from logistic\nregression with all possible removal sequences and subsequent averaging ('average AF').\nResults: AFs following the unadjusted and adjusted (using adjusted ORs) Levin's approach yielded\nclearly higher estimates with a total sum of more than 100% compared to adjusted approaches with\nsums < 100%. Since AFs from logistic regression were related to the removal sequence of risk\nfactors, all possible sequences were considered and estimates were averaged. These average AFs\nyielded plausible estimates of the population impact of considered risk factors on CVD with a total\nsum of 90%. The average AFs for total and HDL cholesterol levels were 17%, for hypertension 16%,\nfor smoking 11%, and for diabetes 5%.\nConclusion: Average AFs provide plausible estimates of population attributable risks and should\ntherefore be reported at least to supplement unadjusted estimates. We provide functions/macros\nfor commonly used statistical programs to encourage other researchers to calculate and report\naverage AFs.\nBackground\nThe major burden of disease has shifted from communi-\ncable to non-communicable diseases in high-income\ncountries during the past century [1,2]. Populations are\naging in most high income countries, resulting in a further\nincrease of non-communicable diseases [3]. This accumu-\nlation of prevalent non-communicable diseases and their\nsequelae represent a major challenge for health service\n\u00a9 2009 R\u00fcckinger et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.\nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0),\nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\n(page number not for citation purposes)\ncapacities and financial resources. Policy makers need evi-\ndence based advice for decisions on potential interven-\ntions and population based prevention strategies.\nWhile publications often report estimates of individual\nassociations such as relative risks or odds ratios, attributa-\nble fractions (AFs) are infrequently reported. The AF\nquantifies the proportion of cases that can be attributed to\na certain risk factor for a specific disease, for example, the\nproportion of lung cancer cases attributable to smoking.\nSmokers have a highly increased risk of lung cancer. How-\never, this individual risk does not give any information on\nthe relevance of smoking for lung cancer in a population\nalso containing nonsmokers. AFs help assessing a poten-\ntial impact of preventive interventions on population\nhealth.\nA number of risk factors for non-communicable diseases\nhave been established such as hypertension for cardiovas-\ncular disease [2]. Multivariable logistic regression has\nbecome a standard procedure to provide valid estimates\nof individual risk studies. Similar methods, however, have\nrarely been applied for AFs, although corresponding\napproaches have been described before [4-6]. Their infre-\nquent application in public health research might particu-\nlarly be due to lacking inclusion of their estimates in\nstatistical software packages.\nThe main aim of this paper is to illustrate the use of AFs\nby comparing different approaches estimating AFs. There-\nfore we used established risk factors of cardiovascular dis-\nExamination Survey (NHANES) for illustration purposes\n[7]. Additionally, we provide functions/macros for the fre-\nquently used statistical software packages R [8], SAS [9],\nand STATA [10], allowing readers to recalculate the results\nshown and moreover, to encourage readers to calculate\nand report adjusted AFs of their own research observa-\ntions.\nMethods\nDefinition of the attributable risk\nThroughout this paper, we refer to the attributable frac-\ntion (AF). A risk factor strongly associated with the dis-\nease, but infrequently prevalent in the population, is less\nrelevant compared with a risk factor of similar effect mag-\nnitude affecting a larger proportion of the population. The\nAF considers both, the individual association and the\nexposure frequency and thus, allows to estimate the rele-\nvance of a risk factor for a disease in a population. The def-\ninition of AFs used in this paper reflects the proportion of\ncases that can be attributed to a certain risk factor in a pop-\nulation.\nLevin's formula\nOne of the most frequently applied approaches calculat-\ning the AF is the Levin formula. It is named after its first\ndescriber who introduced the concept of calculating\nattributable risks in 1953 [11]. The idea is to separate the\nnumber of cases into expected and excess cases. The\nexpected cases are calculated under the assumption that\nthe proportion of cases should be equal among the\nexposed and unexposed. The cases among the exposed\nexceeding the expected number of cases based on the esti-\nmate derived from the prevalence of the disease among\nthe unexposed are supposed to be cases attributable to the\nrisk factor. Based on this assumption Levin described a\nformula that requires only the relative risk estimate (RR)\nand the prevalence of the risk factor (p):\nThe relative risk is often approximated by the odds ratio\ne.g. in cross-sectional studies.\nPlug-in and Bruzzi's method\nOne approach sometimes used to adjust AFs for other\nknown risk factors considers adjusted odds ratio estimates\nfrom multivariable logistic regression analysis in Levin's\nformula [12,13]. This approach has a couple of disadvan-\ntages as we outline in the discussion section. Another\napproach using logistic regression estimates was suggested\nby Bruzzi et al [14]. This method provides adjusted AFs\nand was originally presented for case-control data but can\nalso be applied in cross-sectional studies.\nSequential and average AF\nThe concept of obtaining AFs directly from logistic regres-\nsion was introduced by Greenland and Drescher [15]. The\nbasic idea behind this approach is to estimate a logistic\nregression model with all known/available risk factors.\nThe AF of the risk factor of interest is then calculated as\nfollows:\n1. The risk factor has to be coded dichotomously. It is\n'removed' from the population by classifying all individu-\nals as unexposed, irrespective of their real status.\n2. A logistic model using this modified dataset is used to\nestimate predicted probabilities for each individual:\nwhere  represents the estimate for the intercept of the\nlogistic regression model,  denotes the parameter vector\nfor the covariates included in the model, and xi\ndenoting\nAF\np RR\np RR\nLevin\n=\n -\n+  -\n( )\n( )\npp\nxi\ni\n=\n+ - +\n1 exp( ( ' ))\na b\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nthe observations of the covariates for each individual,\nhowever, with the 'removed' covariate set to zero for all\nindividuals.\n3. The sum of all predicted probabilities is the adjusted\nnumber of cases of the disease that would be expected if\nthe risk factor was absent in the population.\n4. The AF is then calculated by subtracting these expected\ncases from the observed cases and dividing by the\nobserved cases.\nThis procedure can be repeated for any dichotomous risk\nfactor in the logistic regression model. It is also applicable\nwhen removing risk factors sequentially from the model\nand has been called 'sequential attributable fraction' [16].\nHowever, when using the latter approach, the result is sen-\nsitive to the order of the risk factor removal from the\nmodel.\nThe dependence on the removal sequence can be simply\naddressed. If the risk factors are removed in every possible\norder and averaged over all obtained AFs, the average esti-\nmate does not depend on the order sequence anymore\n[16]. This approach has to be repeated k! times with k as\nthe number of risk factors in the model. Eide calls this\napproach 'average attributable fraction' [16].\nWe provide codes for the software packages SAS, STATA\nand R to allow calculating average AFs from logistic regres-\nsion [see Additional files 1, 2 and 3].\nData\nWe used data of the National Health and Nutrition Exam-\n[7]. We focused on evidence based risk factors for cardio-\nvascular disease. We restricted the study population to\nparticipants of at least 40 years of age who were not preg-\nnant at the time of the investigation.\nCardiovascular Disease (CVD)\nSubjects were classified as having CVD according to their\nresponses in the questionnaire on medical conditions.\nWhen subjects stated that a doctor or other health profes-\nsional had told them having coronary heart disease,\nangina pectoris, or a heart attack, they were classified as\nhaving CVD.\nWe a priori considered smoking (more than 100 cigarettes\never), diabetes (physician told subject that he/she has dia-\nbetes), high total cholesterol level (physician told subject\nthat he/she had high cholesterol level), low HDL choles-\nterol (< 45 mg/dl), and hypertension (systolic blood pres-\nsure > 140, diastolic blood pressure > 90, or a physician\nmentioned diagnosis of high blood pressure) as risk fac-\ntors because of ample evidence from the literature and\ntheir previous inclusion in the Framingham risk score\nResults\ninformation on CVD and respective risk factors were avail-\nable. We restricted all analyses to this subset to ensure the\nsame denominator in all analyses. There were 1,108 male\nsubjects were 60 years and older.\nOverall 279 (13%) subjects had evidence of CVD. The\nmost frequent risk factor for CVD among the study popu-\nclassified as smokers. The least frequent risk factor was\nprevalent diabetes with 354 (16%) subjects affected. Fre-\nquencies of CVD and risk factors separated by age catego-\nThe risk factor with the highest unadjusted individual risk\nfor CVD was age of 60 years and older with an odds ratio\nsubjects aged 40 to 59 years. This finding was also\nobserved in multivariable logistic regression adjusting for\nother risk factors, yielding an odds ratio of 3.8 (95% con-\nfidence interval: 2.7, 5.1). Estimates for unadjusted and\nadjusted odds ratios for all risk factors are presented in\nThe AF for each risk factor considered was highly depend-\nent on the method applied for its estimation. Hyperten-\nsion, for example, appeared to account for 51% of all\ncases of CVD when applying the classical Levin's formula.\nWhen using adjusted odds ratios plugged into Levin's for-\nmula the AF was considerably reduced to 34%. However,\nthe average AF directly derived from logistic regression\nafter considering all permutations was only 16%. The var-\niation between the different approaches was correspond-\ningly high for other risk factors (table 3).\nTable 1: Description of dataset from the National Health and\nyears and older and full information on outcome CVD and\ndisplayed risk factors\nVariable n % n %\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nThe unadjusted AFs calculated using Levin's formula had\na total sum of more than 200%. For estimates from the\nLevin formula using adjusted odds ratios from multivari-\nable logistic regression the sum was 194% and also far\nabove the possible maximum of 100%. The same applied\nfor estimates according to the method suggested by\nBruzzi, for which the estimates were comparable to esti-\nmates from Levin's formula considering adjusted odds\nratios from logistic regression. However, this method also\nallows for calculating a summary AF that is not equivalent\nto the sum of all individual AFs and sums up to a number\nThe sequential AFs were dependent on the order the risk\nfactors were 'removed' from the study population. Results\nin the respective columns in table 3 were based on only\nariates. When firstly removing high age followed by gen-\nder, hypertension, high cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol,\nsmoking and at last diabetes, the AF for age was the high-\nest with 54% for age of at least 60 years and for diabetes\nwas the lowest with 1% (table 3). In contrast, a model\nwith inverse withdrawal of the risk factors yielded remark-\nably different estimates and e.g. the AF for age was only\n13% for at least 60 years or older. However, the sum of\nAFs is always independent of the removal order and was\n90% for the two different sequences.\nAverage AFs were considerably lower than unadjusted AFs\nfrom Levin's formula or estimates from Levin's formula\nwith adjusted odds ratios from logistic regression (table\nThe average AF for diabetes was 5.4% and was the lowest\naverage AF observed for the risk factors considered. This\ncontrasts with the individual risk of diabetes yielding an\n2.5), which was one of the highest among modifiable risk\nfactors.\nIn an additional model not considering hypertension, the\nAF of smoking was similar to the model also considering\nsmoking (table 3).\nDiscussion\nThis study illustrates the use of AFs as an impact measure-\nment of a risk factor on population level. Risk factors with\nsimilar odds ratios yielded quite different AFs indicating\nTable 2: Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of risk factors for the outcome cardiovascular disease among 2,217 subjects of the\nRisk factor Unadjusted OR 95% confidence interval Adjusteda OR 95% confidence interval\naadjusted for all risk factors displayed in the table\nTable 3: Attributable fractions (AFs) of risk factors for the outcome cardiovascular disease among 2,217 subjects of the NHANES\nRisk factor Levin Adj OR\nLevina\nBruzzi Sequential\nSequential\nAverage\nAF\nAverage AF\n(not considering hypertension)\naadjusted for all risk factors displayed in the table\nbnota bene: These estimates are dependent on the order of the risk factors, in this case the order in which the variables are reported in the table.\ncnota bene: These estimates are dependent on the order of the risk factors, in this case the opposite order in which the variables are reported in\nthe table.\ndBruzzi's method allows calculating a summary AF that is not the sum of all individual AF.\n(page number not for citation purposes)\ndifferent impacts on population level by prevalence of risk\nfactors. Unadjusted AFs tend to estimate higher AFs com-\npared with adjusted estimates. Average AFs seem to pro-\nvide the most plausible estimates of the approaches\nexamined.\nThe results derived from the models are in accordance\nwith the evidence for cardiovascular risk factors. Like oth-\ners we observed cholesterol levels, hypertension, smoking\nand diabetes as important cardiovascular risk factors [2].\nOur approach additionally allows assessing the impact of\nthese risk factors on population level.\nThe approach with the most plausible results, the average\nAF has the advantage of not adding up to more than\n100%. In contrast, the simple Levin approach often yields\ncumulative AFs of more than 100%. Some authors argue\nthat this makes sense since an individual can have several\nrisk factors and the disease can be therefore prevented in\nseveral ways [18]. However, if there are a considerable\nnumber of risk factors which are possibly correlated, it is\nobvious that unadjusted AFs from bivariate analyses may\nbe biased providing an overestimation of the preventive\npotential and adjusted AFs should be rather considered.\nUnfortunately there is no test statistic or other indicator of\nthe appropriateness of a certain model including the cov-\nariates considered. The appropriateness of a model should\nbe considered as regards content. The need to develop the\n'most appropriate model' to investigate the research ques-\ntion, thus, remains the top priority since the overall AF\nand AFs of single risk factors possibly change after with-\ndrawal of risk factors due to confounding or risk factors\non the causal pathway. For example, hypertension as a\nrisk factor for cardiovascular disease might be on the\ncausal pathway of smoking related pathologies or con-\nfounded by smoking or an independent risk factor. Risk\nfactors on the causal pathway of other considered risk fac-\ntors should be omitted from respective models. To assess\nif hypertension is on the causal pathway of smoking sim-\nilar decisions have to be made as in the estimation of indi-\nvidual risk factors. Since e.g. the AF for smoking status was\nsimilar in the model containing and not containing\nhypertension, hypertension does not seem to be exclu-\nsively on the causal pathway of the effect of smoking on\ncardiovascular disease.\nSurprisingly, the approach of average AFs has only rarely\nbeen applied. The original article by Eide, published in\ntions there are 11 self-citations, 15 papers with methodo-\nlogical considerations, and only 20 articles applying the\napproach. The low number of applications might be due\nto the lack of inclusion of this method in statistical pro-\ngram packages. Therefore we provide functions/macros\nfor commonly used statistical programs to encourage\nother researchers to calculate average AFs [see Additional\nMethodological Considerations\nThe accuracy of AF estimates by the algorithms presented\nin this paper still depends on the completeness of the\nmultivariable model. If important confounders are not\nconsidered in the model, an overestimation of AFs can\noccur similarly to an overestimation of individual risk fac-\ntors in multivariable regression models. Other potential\nconfounders might not be considered in our model leav-\ning only 10% of cases for factors like heredity and all other\nenvironmental factors together. However, such a bias is\nonly dependent on the number of covariates considered\nand not on the applied method.\nThe functions provided for calculating adjusted AFs in the\nappendix are based on logistic regression analysis. They\ndo not allow for consideration of continuous explanatory\nvariables within the model e.g. age in years. Considera-\ntion of continuous covariates is theoretically possible and\nis a matter of programming. However, an AF for a contin-\nuous variable might be difficult to communicate. Calcu-\nlating an AF for the mean or an inter-quartile range of a\ncontinuous variable provides an estimate for a pre-\ndefined but possibly arbitrary parameter change.\nAlthough the approach of calculating AFs with the Levin\nformula and adjusted odds ratios from logistic regression\nhas been shown to yield inconsistent estimates [5,19], we\nused this approach for illustration and comparison to\nother approaches and do not recommend it due to biased\nestimates.\nThe calculation of average AFs as discussed and favored in\nthis paper requires access to original observational data.\nWhen using the method of average AFs in this paper, it is\nnot possible to estimate adjusted average AFs by pub-\nlished aggregated data as for example in Levin's equation.\nFollowing this consideration, combined estimates from\nseveral studies (e.g. results from a meta-analysis) cannot\nbe considered in average AFs as proposed in this paper.\nAlthough, such a combined estimate may be less subject\nto variation due to a higher sample size, such a combining\nof possibly biased estimates does not consider adjustment\nfor confounding. Therefore, average AFs from original\ndata remains important due to control for confounding\neven if only one data set is available.\nThe results generated from an adjusted AF model for a spe-\ncific population may not be fitting to settings in other\n(page number not for citation purposes)\npopulations. This is likely to be due to varying prevalence\nof risk factors. Additionally, AFs in other populations may\ndiffer due to the impact of additional age or ethnic groups\nthat were not included in the original sample. For infer-\nences on population level analyses should be based on\nrepresentative data from the population of interest.\nConclusion\nPreventive strategies in populations have to take into\naccount the magnitude of targeted risk factors and their\nprevalence in the population for which the respective\nintervention is planned. The concept of average AFs pro-\nvides a useful tool to address these issues. Application of\nsimple formulas such as the Levin formula, however, may\nyield considerable overestimation of potential population\nimpact of specific interventions. The estimation may be\nimproved by the application of average AFs. Macros for\nthe standard statistical software programmes are provided\n[see Additional files 1, 2 and 3].
