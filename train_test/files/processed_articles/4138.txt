Viewed from a sociol-\nogy of professions' perspective, participatory news environments can be considered\nplaces of `boundary work', where the boundaries of conventional journalism are chal-\naudience as producer of news challenges journalism to rethink its professional identity,\nconventional understandings of its function in society and key principles \u00ad such as objec-\ntivity and diversity \u00ad that are conventionally associated with professional journalistic\nquality. In short, participatory journalism forces professional journalists to reconsider the\nbuilding blocks through which they have claimed their expertise, social authority and\ntaken a hesitant attitude towards a participating audience, fearing a loss of journalistic\nquality (Singer, 2010). The assumption is that the audience would, for instance, have a\npreference for personal, trivial or sensational topics and take up a subjective, emotional\nstyle, all of which is considered incompatible with `journalism' (Borger et al., 2013b;\nParticipatory journalism has been explored from various angles, but studies that exam-\nine participatory content have remained scarce. Existing content analyses concentrate on\n(hyper)local forms of participatory journalism, focusing on neighbourhoods or cities, and\nthat, generally, this type of participatory journalistic content is indeed less objective than\nprofessional journalism and does not show more diversity. However, participatory jour-\nnalism is not a homogeneous phenomenon. Journalism practitioners have constructed dif-\nferent forms of participatory journalism, granting participants with varying roles and\nrights (Borger et al., 2013b), which leads to varied expectations and evaluations of taking\npart in journalism on the side of participants (Borger et al., 2015). Studies found notions\nof (editorial) control and professional autonomy to be key in this regard (Borger et al.,\nrespond to audience participation by `reasserting control' (Lewis, 2012: 850), finding it\ndifficult to abandon their traditional role as `gatekeepers' of the news (Singer, 2010).\nHowever, control by professional journalists over participatory content is not as strong in\nall participatory environments (Borger et al., 2013b). Typically, it is exercised less in local\nBorger et al. 3\ninitiatives. Here, content autonomy, conventionally an important professional journalistic\nvalue (Singer, 2007), is transferred to participants. This raises the question of whether the\nresults from existing content analyses are representative for participatory journalism\nbeyond the (hyper)local, since studies that examine how more diverse types of participa-\ntory journalism (including both high and low content control/autonomy variations) impact\non the characteristics of the content they produce are lacking.\nThe goal of this study is to examine the, largely untested, assumptions that news\norganizations and journalists have about audience input through an analysis of participa-\ntory content. First, we investigate the content of a wider variety of participatory journal-\nistic projects, including and beyond the (hyper)local. Second, we systematically ask how\nthese various forms might be characterized in relation to conventional quality journalism\nas a particular genre (Costera Meijer, 2001), examining them against two content criteria\nthat have been critical to this genre: `objectivity' and `diversity'. By doing so, we aim to\nbetter understand what the participating audience produces in order to grasp what,\naccording to participants, `counts' as journalism (Deuze, 2005) and in order to establish\nif and how this differs from conventional quality journalism.\nObjectivity and diversity as cornerstones of professional ideology in\nWestern journalism\nThere is a broad consensus that 20th-century journalism in Western countries has been\ncharacterized by a `professional model' (see Schudson and Anderson, 2009) that centred\non the idea of a trained professional gathering and disseminating objectively validated\nmodel became increasingly institutionalized through the forming of professional institu-\ntions and codes of practice (Schudson and Anderson, 2009), and the development of a\nprofessional ideology, consisting of a set of values to which journalists in all media\ntypes, genres and formats refer in the context of their daily work (Deuze, 2005: 445).\nObjectivity has long been considered a core tenet of this professional ideology. Although\ninterpretations of objectivity vary across countries (Deuze, 2005), over time and journal-\nistic subgenres (Wahl-Jorgensen, 2013), journalists in elective democracies worldwide\nconsider themselves as committed to providing `objective' information (Deuze, 2005).\nObjectivity as a core value translates into the idea that, as long as journalists follow dep-\nersonalized and rationalized procedures, `a true account of reality can be presented'\n(Broersma, 2010: 27). Others have demonstrated how the objectivity standard is also a\n`strategic ritual' (Tuchman, 1972), rooted in organizational demands to avoid libel suits\nIn this article, we are interested in the collection of content characteristics that are the\nconsequence of both professional ideology and organizational requirements. Professional\njournalists, following the objectivity norm, tend to (1) rely on quotations from external\n(official) sources as a procedure that removes journalists'own subjectivity from the story,\nthereby supporting their claim to truth (Tuchman, 1972: 668) and (2) exclude personal\nviews and values from their reporting, which results in journalism's hallmark neutral style\nthat avoids subjective language by the journalist (Broersma, 2010). In categorizing the\n`subjectivity'of journalistic language, Carpenter (2008a) applied an intuitive approach by\n4 Journalism \nclassifying articles as `mostly fact' or `mostly opinion' (p. 538). The linguistic approach\nof Vis (2011) offers a more quantifiable and exact measure. Vis measured change in the\nexpression of subjectivity in four Dutch newspapers between 1950 and 2002. She under-\nstands as subjective `all expressions of beliefs, attitudes and opinions of a speaking or\nwriting subject, and his attention to himself and to the addressee' (p. 17). Thus, expres-\nsions are subjective when they represent a speaking subject's evaluations (rather than\nfacts) as well as the speaking subject's explicit references to herself or himself (rather than\nimplying herself or himself while referring to the world outside).\n`Objectivity' as a core norm and distinctive content characteristic of professional\njournalism is associated with `diversity' as another core tenet of quality journalism.\nWhere the objectivity norm prescribes that journalists rely on external sources, a sense\nof `doing it for the public' (Deuze, 2005: 453) requires that journalists do so in a manner\nthat guarantees the representation of a diversity of points of view and perspectives, for\nideally, the media reflect the `prevailing differences of culture, opinion and social condi-\ntions of the population as a whole' (McQuail, 1992: 144). Media diversity is considered\nvital for processes of political deliberation and discussions among citizens, since the\ngreater variety in offer (Van Hoof et al., 2014) of journalistic information, the better the\nneeds of a diverse citizenry are served.\nDiversity has been approached as a principle in government's broadcast policy\n(Benson, 2005), emphasizing, for example, diversity of newsroom staff or diversity in\nmedia economy, or as a journalistic procedure ensuring a balanced and representative\naccount (Broersma, 2010). As a content characteristic, diversity is typically measured\nnot only in terms of source diversity but also in terms of diversity of topics or frames\n2010) and Voakes et al. (1996), we approach diversity as a content characteristic, cap-\ntured as variety in offer of topics covered of sources used. Following Paulussen and\nD'heer (2013), this conceptualization is complemented by variety in offer of news values\nthat influence news selection.\nParticipatory journalism: Repairing a democratic deficit?\nProfessional understandings of objectivity and diversity have a paradoxical relation to jour-\nnalistic quality: on the one hand, they are inextricably linked with an idea of what constitutes\ngood journalism, but on the other hand, they have been criticized as obstacles to producing\njust that. Especially the `routinization'(McQuail, 1992: 184) of the objectivity norm and its\nimpact on the diversity ideal has attracted fierce criticism. Journalism's professional quality\nlogic dictates the following of fixed procedures to establish impartiality (Costera Meijer,\nence for easily accessible, official (institutional) sources (Shoemaker and Reese, 1996). As\na consequence, professional interpretations of objectivity have been observed to limit the\ndiversity of news content, constrain understanding of issues presented in the news, thereby\nWith the advent of participatory journalism, scholars and media observers have antici-\npated that a greater involvement of the public might lead to a break with professional\nunderstandings of objectivity and diversity. Participants might not be aware of professional\nBorger et al. 5\nideals or simply have different concerns, and they would not be constrained by organiza-\ntional demands and professional routines (Carpenter, 2008a; Wahl-Jorgensen, 2015).\nParticipatory journalism could harbour a move towards a more personal and subjective\nstyle and an increase in the diversity of news content (Allan, 2013: 121), and, as such, has\nbeen ascribed the potential to re-engage the audience in politics and public life (Nip, 2006).\nOver the past decade, however, scholars'initial enthusiasm about the potential of participa-\ntory journalism has shifted to disappointment, seeing that professional journalists adhere to\nprofessional control over content and the audience is less eager to participate than initially\nParticipatory content: Subjective and soft?\naspects of objectivity and diversity. The mutual finding is that (hyper)local participatory\njournalism takes a different approach when measured against professional journalism.\nRegarding objectivity, participatory journalism has been found to include more author\nopinion (Carpenter, 2008a), and use fewer sources to `objectively' describe news events\nmore subjective reporting style.\nRegarding diversity in terms of topics covered, participants have been observed to\ncover `soft' news topics such as entertainment, culture, sports and health, while leaving\n`hard' news categories such as crimes, fires and accidents to professionals (Carpenter,\nsource use, scholars have demonstrated that participants use different sources than that\nused by professionals: participants show a greater reliance on personal experience (i.e.\nauthor as source) and first-hand witnessing (Paulussen and D'heer, 2013: 597) and on\n2013). Participants thus give voice to different actors partaking in news events than pro-\nfessionals. Regarding the news values underlying news selection, participants have been\nobserved to give primacy to `soft' news values such as consonance, cultural relevance,\nreference to persons, self-promotion, good news and emotion, while professionals were\nguided by `hard' news values such as unexpectedness, public relevance, negativity and\nSummarizing then, studies of (hyper)local participatory content conclude that partici-\npatory journalism makes a contribution to the media landscape that is different from\nprofessional journalism, featuring relatively subjective and soft contents (Fico et al.,\nApproach\nEmpirical studies reveal news organizations and journalists that experiment with audience\nparticipation as being caught in a tension between professional control and digital tech-\nnologies' logic of open participation (Lewis, 2012; see also Domingo et al., 2008; Singer,\nthat the dilemma between professional control and open participation is differently\n6 Journalism \nnegotiated in various forms of participatory journalism, granting participants with different\nroles and rights. Our assumption is that the extent to which either professional journalists\nor participants have control over content impacts the type of participatory content that is\npublished. In this article, we therefore investigate the content of five very different partici-\npatory journalistic initiatives, each of which occupies a different position on the scale of\ncontrol over content by professional journalists to control over content by participants. We\nexamine how these examples of participatory journalism manifest themselves on key vari-\nables traditionally associated with quality journalism, that is, objectivity and diversity. We\nconceptualized objectivity as (1) relying on external sources and (2) excluding personal\nviews and values by avoiding the use of subjective language. We conceptualized diversity\nas the variety in offer of topics covered, sources used and news values underlying news\nselection. This results in the following research questions:\nRQ1a. To what extent do content characteristics of various participatory journalistic\ninitiatives reflect a more objective versus a more subjective reporting style?\nRQ1b. Is the reporting style (objective vs subjective) associated with the degree of\nprofessional control over content?\nRQ2a. How diverse are various participatory journalistic initiatives with regard to\ntopics, sources and news values?\nRQ2b. Is diversity of topics, sources and news values associated with the degree of\nprofessional control over content?\nResearch design\nSelection of participatory initiatives\nOur study employs quantitative analysis of 741 items from five participatory journalistic\ninitiatives from the Netherlands. The projects were selected based on their great variety in\nthe level of freedom granted to participants in the production and publication of content\nversus the level of control over the production and publication process exerted by profes-\nsional journalists involved in the initiative. These characteristics were the results of a\nsystematic analysis of interviews with professionals involved in a wide range of participa-\ntory projects in the Netherlands (see Borger et al., 2013b). The column `Description of\nparticipant role' in Table 1 describes what aspects of production and publication of con-\ntent were exercised by participants, and what aspects were appointed to the domain of\nprofessional journalists. Together, the selected five initiatives reflect a great variety \u00ad in\nterms of professional control, type of participant role, geographical scale, revenue model\nand type of organization that initiated the project \u00ad that can be found among participatory\njournalistic initiatives in the field. As such, the selected projects can be considered repre-\nsentative for participatory journalism in the Netherlands between 2010 and 2014.\nSelection of items\norder to allow for a detailed description of the content. This number was set for practical\nBorger et al. 7\nTable 1.

Given the purposes of our com-\nparative content analysis, we concentrated on textual aspects of the items, entailing that,\nin the case of U in de Wijk, the first 2minutes of video items were transcribed.\nOperationalization of the variables\nObjectivity.Objectivity was conceptualized as (1) relying on sources and (2) keeping\npersonal views and values out by avoiding the use of subjective language. Conceptual-\nizing objectivity as the absence of subjective language, we measured the deviation from\nobjectivity by identifying the amount of subjective language used. Following Vis (2011),\nwe first determined who expressed a piece of text: the (professional or participant) author\nor an external source. Direct quotations were labelled as `source text'; all other text was\nconsidered `author text'. Next, we used Vis' model of subjectivity indicators (Appendix\n1) to identify all subjective words in the `source text' and `author text'. All texts were\nannotated automatically for part of speech and lemma information.1 After all annotations\nwere completed, a sample of 5\nper cent of the corpus per participatory project was\nchecked manually for words that occurred in double linguistic forms and meanings. The\nnumber of subjective words per project was subsequently weighed by the error rate,\nexpressed as a percentage of wrongly annotated subjective words per project.\nalso followed by Paulussen and D'heer (2013). Carpenter (2008a) defines a source as a\n`provider of attributed textual information'(p. 538). Note that this can also be a reference\nto the author himself. We identified all sources in the text by means of direct verbs of\nattribution (e.g. `said', `reported', `stated' and `noted') and indirect verbs of attribution\n(e.g. `hopes', `feels' and `believes'), and then counted all sources used per item per pro-\nject. Reliance on sources was, thus, measured as the total number of sources used per\nproject.\nDiversity. We conceptualized diversity as the variety in offer of news topics, references to\ntype of sources and type of news values per project.\nRegarding the topics of the content that participants produce, we followed Paulussen\nand D'heer's (2013) distinction between hard and soft news topics. For each item, the\ncentral topic that received most attention in the body of the text was coded. The coders2\nchose from a list of 27 societal domains. This categorization was based on Van Hoof's\n(2000) listing of 27 societal domains that reflect how professional journalists select and\npresent news items. In order to establish an interpretable overview, these 27 categories\nwere, according to their internal coherence, divided into five supercategories: `hard pub-\nlic policy', `politics', `public event', `soft public policy' and `personal domain'. For a\ndetailed account of these categories, see Appendix 2.\nDiversity of hard/soft news topics was measured as entropy in number equivalents,3 a\nmeasure for open diversity (Kleinnijenhuis, 2003). Open diversity means that the maxi-\nmum level of diversity is reached when all categories are given equal attention and the\nminimum level when all attention is given to only one category. This open diversity\nmeasure is based on the proportion of the total amount of attention that each of the\nBorger et al. 9\ncategories received across the projects. We transformed the proportion in such a way that\ndiversity is 0 when all attention goes to only one category (meaning there is no diversity)\nand 1, when the attention is equally distributed over all categories (i.e. perfect diversity),\nfrom an open perspective (see Note 3), so that we can compare variables with a different\nnumber of categories on the same scale.\nRegarding source type use, we further followed the example of Carpenter (2008a,\nitem for the purposes of determining the reliance on sources (see `objectivity'), we now\ndetermined the type of sources that were used. First, we distinguished between author\nsource and external source (see above). Author source was operationalized as first-hand\nwitnessing and personal experience, that is, explicit references to the ideas, opinions,\nexperiences or observations of the author himself/herself. Furthermore, a distinction was\nmade between official (i.e. sources speaking on behalf of an organization) and unofficial\nsources (sources speaking on their own behalf) and collective and individual identities.An\n`undecided' category was created for sources that could not be categorized otherwise.\nDiversity of source type was measured in the same way as diversity of topics, that is,\nas entropy in number equivalents, comprising five categories.\nConcerning news values, we adapted the example of Paulussen and D'heer (2013),4\nresulting in the following list of 10: `threshold', `unexpectedness', `personalization',\n`negativity', `recency', `elite/power', `good news', `emotion', `usefulness', `promotion'\n(see Appendix 3 for definitions). The news values were recorded at the article level as\nbeing present (1) or absent (0). In order to establish an interpretable overview, these 10\ncriteria were clustered into two main categories, conform Paulussen and D'heer's (2013)\nobservation that in hyperlocal participatory journalism, news values follow the distinc-\ntion between soft and hard news topics. News values were measured at the level of the\nnews item.\nDiversity of news values was, again, measured as entropy in number equivalents. We\npresent diversity of news values both in the dichotomous hard\u00adsoft news value variable\nand in the 10 categories news values variable.\nCoding procedures\nA content analysis was conducted on the selected items. Subjective language use was\nmeasured by means of automated content analysis. All other variables were measured by\nmeans of manual coding, using AmCAT (Amsterdam Content Analysis Toolkit, cf. Van\nAtteveldt, 2008). To this end, a code book was developed by the main researcher and, for\nclarity of the instructions and uniformity of the categories used, tested by four trained\ncoders (see Note 2). The main researcher coded 300 items; the other coders each coded\nReliability\nFive coders performed the coding. To establish intercoder reliability, the five coders all\ncoded 5per cent of the total sample. Krippendorff's (2004)  amounts to .74 for central\ntopic, .99 for number of sources per item, .77 for type of sources, which are acceptable\nto very good values. The Krippendorff's  for the dichotomous news value variables\nranged from .49 for personalization to 1 for threshold. Although Krippendorff's  is very\nstrict for dichotomous variables with a skewed distribution (Fretwurst, 2015), the low\nintercoder reliability for some of the news values implies that findings in this particular\nregard need to be interpreted with some caution. We decided not to exclude these news\nvalues from the analysis because the concepts are useful for exploration. The main coder\nchecked and adjusted the codings of the other coders. So, the final data for news values\nthat we used in the analysis were uniformly coded. We regarded this as the best possible\nsolution to obtain the exploratory goal of this study.\nResults\nReporting style\nRQ1 asked (1) to what extent the content characteristics of various participatory journal-\nistic initiatives reflect a more objective versus a more subjective reporting style and (2)\nwhether the reporting style is associated with the degree of professional control over\ncontent. First, the number of external sources used is discussed; next, the use of subjec-\ntive language is addressed.\nTable 2 shows the average number of external sources used per item for all projects.\nProject Dichtbij, where professional control is least strong, showed the lowest average\nnumber of external sources per item (0.63 per item); while NOSNet, where professional\ncontrol is strongest, showed the highest (7.88 per item). The other projects, with stronger\nlevels of professional control than Dichtbij, show higher number of sources per item but\nbelow the level of external source use on NOSNet. Analysis of Variance revealed that\nSubjective language use is presented as the number of subjective words used per pro-\nject as a percentage of the total number of words per project (Figure 1). The relative use\nof subjective language is a better measure to compare the five projects, since the length\nof the items varies per item and per project. Figure 1 shows three main results. First, as\nprofessional control increases, projects are less subjective. Second, as professional con-\ntrol increases, the author is less subjective. In this regard, there is a crossover point at The\nPost Online, where sources become more subjective than the author. Total subjectivity\nTable 2. Number of sources used.\nProjects N M SD\nSD: standard deviation.\nand author subjectivity are lowest on NOSNet, the project characterized by strongest\nprofessional control. Third, Dichtbij deviates from these general trends. Figure 1 shows\nthat in this project, professional control is least strong, but total subjectivity is lowest and\nsource subjectivity highest. This deviant pattern can be explained by the fact that source\ntext is scarce in the items of this project.\nIn summary then, as professional control increases, the reporting style moves towards\ntraditional interpretations of objectivity: there is a stronger reliance on external sources\nand \u00ad with the exception of Dichtbij \u00ad a decrease in subjective language use in general\nand in author subjectivity more specifically. Dichtbij can be typified as being farthest\nfrom traditional journalism in the sense that hardly any sources are used, which also\nexplains the deviant pattern in terms of subjective language use.\nDiversity\nRQ2 asked (1) how diverse various participatory journalistic initiatives are with regard\nto topics, sources and news values and (2) whether diversity of topics, sources and news\nvalues are associated with the degree of professional control over content. We first\naddress both questions in relation to the topics covered, and then move on to source use\nand news values.\nTopics\nFigure 2 shows the attention that the five topic categories receive in each of the projects.\nTaking all projects together, hard news (57.8%) is covered more often than soft news (42.2%).\nMost covered by far is the category `hard public policy'(44.7%). `Public events'are covered\nFigure 1. Relative use of subjective language per text type per platform.\nDichtbij: Nwords\n(Nwords author\nThe Post Online: Nwords\n(Nwords author\nand the strength of the association is modest (Cramer's V=.28; p<.00).\nAs professional control increases, the share of hard news increases and soft news\ndecreases: on Dichtbij, hard news accounts for 48.7per cent of the items and soft news\nfor 51.3per cent; on U in de Wijk, the division is 56per cent and 44per cent; on The Post\nper cent, respectively. On NOSNet,\nhard news is overtly dominant (93.6%). Figure 3 shows the diversity in topics per pro-\nject, both in terms of the five subcategories and in terms of the two main categories, hard\nand soft news. With regard to both measures, there is a general pattern of diversity\ndecreasing as professional control over content increases. Diversity is higher when\nmeasured against two categories, but not perfectly linear, since De Jaap (.72) scores\nlower than The Post Online (.85). Diversity is highest in the project where professional\ncontrol is weakest, that is, Dichtbij (.64 and 1). The smallest diversity is achieved in the\nproject where professional control is strongest, that is, NOSNet (.38 and .27).\nIn summary then, as professional control is stronger and participants have less auton-\nomy to decide what to write, topic diversity decreases.\nSource use\nFigure 4 shows the relative attention that sources receive in each of the projects. Overall,\nthere is a stronger reliance on external sources than on personal experience or first-hand\nFigure 2. Relative attention for topics per platform.\nwitnessing by the author. The latter accounts for only 15.8\nper cent of all source use;\nofficial sources (official collective identity plus official individual identities) account for\n48.9per cent of all source use, while unofficial sources take up 28.8per cent. The differ-\nthe association is modest (Cramer's V=.22; p<.00).\nFigure 3. Topic diversity per platform.\n0=no diversity (all attention in one category); 1=maximum diversity (all attention evenly distributed among\ncategories).\nFigure 4. Relative attention for sources type per platform.\nFigure 5. Source diversity per platform.\n0=no diversity (all attention in one category); 1=maximum diversity (all attention evenly distributed among\ncategories).\nIn all projects, there is a stronger reliance on external sources than on first-hand wit-\nnessing or personal experience by the author. However, the extent to which participants\nrely on personal experience or first-hand witnessing decreases as professional control\nover content increases: in Dichtbij, 33\nper cent of all source use consists of personal\nexperience or first-hand witnessing by the author, in U in de Wijk 23.5per cent, in De\nJaap it is 21.9per cent, in The Post Online this is 16.4per cent and in NOSNet 6.5per\ncent.\nThe use of official and unofficial sources was not associated with professional control\nover content. The use of official sources takes up more than half of all source use on\na third of all source use in De Jaap (34.6%) and U in de Wijk (32.8%). Furthermore,\nsource use in U in de Wijk, De Jaap and NOSNet is characterized by a considerable share\nentails video items, differs from the other projects in that participants do not rely on\nofficial collective identities.\nFigure 5 shows source diversity per project. The project where professional control\nis least strong, that is, Dichtbij, and the project where professional control is strongest,\nthat is, NOSNet, have approximately the same measure of diversity (.75 and .77,\nrespectively). In U in de Wijk, source diversity is lower (.49) than in Dichtbij and\nNOSNet. De Jaap and The Post Online both have greater source diversity (.94 and .88,\nrespectively). Thus, these results do not suggest that source diversity is associated with\nprofessional control over content, but findings did demonstrate that participants are\nless likely to rely on personal experience or first-hand witnessing when professional\ncontrol is stronger.\nNews values\nFigure 6 shows the use of news values per project. Taking all projects together, the divi-\nsion between hard and soft news values is nearly 50\u00ad50. On the hard side, recency and\nnegativity are used most often (22% and 16%, respectively); on the soft side, personali-\nzation and good news prevail (21% and 10%, respectively).\nSignificant differences between the projects exist for all news values. In general, the\nshare of hard news values increases and that of soft news values decreases when profes-\nsional control over content is stronger. U in de Wijk deviates from this general trend as it\nhas a lower share of hard news values (22%) as compared to Dichtbij (35%). Regarding\nhard news values, the figures show that recency is important in all projects, regardless of\nprofessional control over content. Furthermore, as professional control increases, so does\nthe occurrence of the values `elite/power' and `negativity'. With regard to the use of soft\nnews values, a few things stand out: in Dichtbij, the three news values that are used most\nFigure 6. Relative use of news values per platform.\nFigure 7. News values diversity per platform.\n0=no diversity (all attention in one category); 1=maximum diversity (all attention evenly distributed among\ncategories).\noften are `good news' (20%), `promotion' (22%) and `usefulness' (22%). In contrast to\nother projects, `personalization' is virtually absent in Dichtbij (1%). U in de Wijk is\ndefined by a great share of `personalization' (26%), `good news' (25%) and `promotion'\n(22%); of all projects, De Jaap has the greatest share of `emotion' (13%).\nFigure 7 shows the diversity in the use of news values, in terms of the 10 individual\nvalues as well as in terms of the two main categories of hard and soft news values. The\ndifferences between the projects are relatively small in terms of the 10 news values vary-\ning between .47 and .54. With regard to the dichotomous hard/soft categories, diversity\nvaries between .71 and a perfect 1. Furthermore, these findings do not suggest that diver-\nsity in news values is associated with professional control over content.\nDiscussion and conclusion\nIn this study, we investigated how the contents of five very different examples of partici-\npatory journalism manifest themselves regarding objectivity and diversity, two criteria\ntraditionally associated with `quality journalism'(Costera Meijer, 2001). We furthermore\nexamined if these manifestations were linked to the degree to which professional jour-\nnalists have control over the participatory content published in these projects.\nTo start with, our findings concur with those from previous studies on the content of\nD'heer, 2013) in the sense that the tendency towards subjective reporting style, covering\nsoft news topics, reliance on personal experience and first-hand witnessing, and towards\nthe use of soft news values was particularly strong in the local projects that were inves-\ntigated. At the same time, this means that existing content analyses of participatory jour-\nnalism,scarceandwithahomogeneousfocuson(hyper)localforms,arenotrepresentative\nof participatory journalism in its entirety, as this study demonstrates that contents vary in\nterms of objectivity and diversity.\nMost importantly, this study demonstrates that a notion of professional control is a\nmeaningful concept when interpreting differences between participatory journalistic\nenvironments regarding these core elements of what has traditionally been considered as\njournalistic `quality'. It was found that reporting style is more subjective as professional\ncontrol over content is weaker and that topic diversity increases. Source diversity and\ndiversity in news values did not increase with a weakening of professional control, but\nparticipants did place different emphases regarding source use and news values when\ngiven room to manoeuvre; they were more likely to rely on personal experience or first-\nhand witnessing and to select news based on soft news values. The findings, thus, sug-\ngest that participants, at least partly, tend to move away from traditional journalistic\nunderstandings of objectivity and diversity.\nProfessional control, however, does not suffice to account for all the differences found\nbetween the projects, which suggests that other explanatory factors play a role as well.\nOne such factor might be medium type. In contrast to written texts, video needs actual\npersons to tell a story. Thus, in U in de Wijk, in which only video items were produced,\nofficial collective identities (`the government declared that', `the labour union declared\nthat') were not used as a source and individuals (officials and non-officials together)\nmade up 76.4per cent of all source use. Another explanatory factor could be that partici-\npatory journalism comprises various journalistic subgenres: opinion journalism (De\nJaap, The Post Online), commercially oriented hyperlocal journalism (Dichtbij), civi-\ncally oriented community journalism (U in de Wijk). Subjective language, typical for\nopinion journalism, was frequent on both De Jaap and The Post Online; both projects\nexplicitly invited participants to submit opinion pieces. On Dichtbij, most items were\nannouncements by or promotions of local businesses, where authors explicitly included\ntheir positive evaluations of commercial activities or organizations. This explains why\nreliance on what we labelled as `personal views, experience or first-hand witnessing' by\nthe author was stronger here than in other projects (33%). U in de Wijk, funded by a\nregional broadcaster and a housing corporation with the purpose of increasing social\ncohesion in urban problem areas, featured a particularly large share of non-official indi-\nviduals (43.6%). This type of source use corresponds with goals of `nurturing' a (physi-\ncal) community by giving voice to `ordinary' people from neighbourhoods, typical for\nAlthough this content analysis does not allow for claims about participants' prac-\ntices and their perceptions about participatory journalism, combining the results from\nthis study with the findings from our previous study in which participants were inter-\nviewed about their expectations and evaluations of participating in journalism (Borger\net al., 2015), we suggest that the tendency away from traditional understandings of\nobjectivity and diversity reconfirms that participatory journalism is a space of `bound-\nary work' (Lewis, 2012; Wahl-Jorgensen, 2015) that encourages both rethinking and\nreinforcing boundaries of conventional quality journalism. Rethinking is implied in the\ntendency towards a more subjective reporting style, which suggests that participants\nmight consider transparency more valuable than neutrality (Deuze, 2005); the ten-\ndency towards covering soft news topics, which suggests that participants see value in\ncovering topics beyond those that are traditionally associated with quality journalism\n(economics, politics, foreign; Costera Meijer, 2001); the tendency towards soft news\nvalues \u00ad and the marginal presence of negativity in participants' content especially \u00ad\nsuggests that participants use different criteria for deciding what is `newsworthy'\n(Costera Meijer, 2013). In our previous study (2014), we demonstrated that if partici-\npation takes place in hyperlocal contexts without any form of professional control,\nparticipants may use the opportunity to publish for communicative purposes connected\nto `marketing' rather than `journalism', labelling such activities as `not journalism'.\nThis "
