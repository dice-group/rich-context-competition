Those who had previously been incarcerated abroad perceive their punishment\nin Lithuania's reforming penal system in comparative terms. We find that international prison\nexperience may either diminish or increase the sense of the severity of the current punishment.\nRespondents often felt more comfortable in a familiar culture of punishment in Lithuania that\nemphasizes autonomy and communality. Moreover, internationalized prisoners perceive prison\nreform emulating West European models as a threat to this culture and are able to articulate\ncomparative critiques of this reform and contest its effects.\n",

Through a qualitative analysis of interviews with former migrants from\nLithuania who have been incarcerated abroad and are now in the Lithuanian prison sys-\ntem, the article aims to discuss this question. The article shows that in Lithuania under-\nstandings of punishment are framed in comparative and international terms. This is for\ntwo reasons; firstly, the high prevalence of former migrants in prison who have been\nincarcerated abroad, and, secondly, the effects on prisoners of large-scale reform of the\nLithuanian penitentiary system towards a `European'model. To make sense of these fac-\ntors, the article frames respondent narratives in the growing bodies of literature in crimi-\nnology concerning crime and migration in the emerging criminology of mobility (Aas\nWeber and Pickering, 2006), as well as work on the global flow of criminological exper-\ntise and policy (Bowling and Sheptycki, 2012; Jones and Newburn, 2002; Melossi et al.,\nThe article argues that international flows of both prisoners and penal policies has\nimplications for the emerging work on penal consciousness or penal subjectivity, which\naddresses the variability in the ways in which punishment is experienced (Crewe, 2011,\nsubjectivity \u00ad the meanings, orientations and understandings of punishment \u00ad is no\nlonger shaped only by the penal power of the given state in which a particular prison is\nlocated. Instead, the perceptions of the severity and salience of punishment are becoming\ninternationalized `in a world of global mobility' (Bosworth, 2012: 126).\nThe article is structured as follows. Firstly, we provide a discussion of the literature\nand suggest certain gaps that this article aims to speak to. We then give an overview of\nthe Lithuanian case, which establishes that Lithuania is a high emigration country that is\nundergoing major penal reform. The article then produces an analysis of prisoner narra-\ntives concerning their punishment in Lithuania and the comparative perspective these\nnarratives offer. Finally, we discuss perceptions of Lithuania's prison reform. We show\nthat prisoners use a comparative lens to understand this; they feel that reforms conducted\nin the name of becoming `European' often do not produce the same outcomes as in the\nEurope that the prisoners are all too familiar with. In conclusion, we suggest that the\ninternationalization of penal subjectivity might be of interest to criminologists working\nin a range of subfields.\nGlobalization and penal identities\nA fast-growing literature within criminology concerns mobility, migration and criminal\nvincingly argues that punishment and criminal justice logics have become central to\nimmigration control, in turn reshaping understandings of belonging and citizenship. As\nKaufman (2014) writes, the basic premise of the criminology of mobility is that globali-\nzation has altered the relationship between punishment and identity. In an age of globali-\nzation, punishment exacerbates differences of race and ethnicity, reconfiguring gendered\nidentities and their relationship with nationality and citizenship. The writing in this area\nfocuses on the reproduction of global inequalities and the effects on identity of those\n`othered' by exclusionary measures such as deportation regimes, immigration removal\ncentres and the differential management of foreign nationals in prison. Related to this,\nsome studies also attempt to explain the increasing proportion of foreign prisoners in the\nprison populations of Western Europe, linking this to political economic and institutional\nA further body of literature, somewhat separately, charts the effects of globalization\non the circulation of criminological ideas, technologies and `expert systems' (Giddens,\n1990). Notwithstanding the embedded cultures of punishment that exist in national con-\ntions is commonplace whether in policing strategies, prison design or sentencing policies\n2009). Such diffusion is often accompanied by internationalized slogans such as `zero\ntolerance', `no frills prisons' or `broken windows'. Although many studies point to the\ninternational spread of US approaches to criminal justice (Downes, 2001; Jones and\nNewburn, 2002; Karstedt, 2002), the European Union (EU) has also endeavoured to cre-\nate a unified `area of justice' that supposes a degree of convergence and uniformity in\nDespite these growing bodies of literature, Bosworth (2012: 125) writes that `many\nresearchers in [the punishment and society] field have ... been slow to recognize the\nimpact of globalization on structures, practices and experiences of punishment' [our ital-\nics]. The gap in our knowledge concerning shifting penal experiences in conditions of\nglobal flows of people and ideas is one of the key objects of study for the criminology of\nmobility. This article offers a case study from a non-Western jurisdiction. The case of\nLithuania shows that subjective experiences of punishment in predominantly migrant-\nsending countries are also changing significantly owing to global mobility. Moreover,\nmigrant-sending countries are most likely to be poorer and positioned on the receiving\nend of flows of global expertise, including reform pressure from the EU and policy pro-\nmotion from political and civil entrepreneurs.\nThe Lithuanian case demonstrates how flows of people and ideas impact penal sub-\njectivity or penal consciousness \u00ad the experience of something as punishment and the\nmeaning ascribed to that punishment (Sexton, 2015). For socio-legal and jurisprudential\ntheorists, penal subjectivity concerns measuring the variable degree of individual suf-\nfering at the hands of the state so as to establish the justness of a particular sanction\nsame for everyone and are experienced subjectively across a range of dimensions\n(Crewe, 2011, 2012). In this vein, Lori Sexton, following prior distinctions concerning\nthe law as it is in action compared with on paper, has tried to understand the lived reali-\nties of `punishment in action' as against `punishment on the books' (Sexton, 2015: 117).\nShe argues that the severity, or the intensity, of punishment and the salience, or the\nprominence, of the punishment in everyday life differ from prisoner to prisoner. The\ndegree to which a prisoner feels the intensity and salience of punishment depends on\n`the punishment gap'. This refers to the degree to which each individual's expectation\nof punishment and the actual experience of punishment diverge. Expectations, for\nSexton, are determined by vicarious knowledge and comparison with other prisoners'\npunishment as well as prior experience.\nThe article aims to build on Sexton's theory concerning the variability of penal sub-\njectivity and the role of comparison in penal suffering. We develop the theory by arguing\nthat such comparison can have an international dimension under conditions of globaliza-\ntion. Our two central propositions are, firstly, that international experience of prison\nenables comparison of punishment across jurisdictions, differences in these experiences\nwill affect expectations and hence the punishment gap; and, secondly, that international\nexperience of prison provides the basis to critique and resist penal policy innovation as\nwell as to adjust expectations of these innovations'effects on experiences of punishment.\nLithuania provides a critical case study to explore these propositions. Below we intro-\nduce the case study and show why Lithuania is a particularly appropriate case for under-\nstanding the penal impact of global mobility in a non-Western European context.\nLithuania: International emigration and domestic prison\nreform\nLithuania is a country of 3 million people that, apart from Latvia and Estonia, is the only\nEU member state to have been a Soviet republic. Like many former communist states,\npeople have left the country since that time (Europas migracijos tinklas, 2013). However,\nemigration is often not permanent. Immigration into Lithuania mostly comprises return-\ning migrants and their number steadily increased through the 2000s; it has seen a signifi-\nLithuanians have migrated to many countries. One of the main destinations has been the\nUK. Rasinger's (2010) study of UK press coverage has shown that Lithuanians have been\nportrayed as quintessential criminal migrants. Lithuanians are over-represented in the UK\nprison system: they comprise 2.8 percent of the UK's foreign-citizen population yet make\nup 4.9 percent of the UK's foreign prisoner population (Giannangeli, 2013). Siegel's study\nof itinerant criminals in the Netherlands showed that Lithuanians featured the most promi-\nnently in police statistics for migrant crime, followed by Poland, Bulgaria and Romania\n(Siegel, 2014, 2015). This article is not concerned with trying to understand why some\nLithuanians turn to criminality once abroad. These statistics from the Netherlands and the\nUK merely establish that Lithuania can fairly be portrayed as an EU member state that has\na highly mobile population and that some Lithuanians indeed fall foul of the law in some\nreceiving countries, experiencing life in prison in those countries.\nIn Lithuania itself, the penitentiary system is in the throes of reform driven by inter-\ntentiary system proportionately holds the most prisoners in the EU (International Centre\nfor Prison Studies, 2014). As a comparison, Germany, one of the main destination coun-\ntries for Lithuanians, holds 76 prisoners per 100,000 of the population. The majority of\nthe 9700 prisoners in Lithuania are held in houses of correction; these were known in\nSoviet times as correctional colonies (Sakalauskas, 2014).1 Correctional houses occupy\nlarge areas that contain both industrial and living `zones'. Convicted prisoners are held\nin dormitories, rather like barracks, housing between 10 and 20 people and sometimes\nmore. Two or three dormitories make up a prisoner detachment, which in Soviet times\nwould have worked shifts together. Prisoners are able to leave their dorms for almost the\nwhole day, walking in their `local sector', a separated area containing a set number of\ndormitories and communal areas. At night prisoners are able to go out into the corridor\nbecause bathrooms are outside the dorms. The majority of prisoners do not wear uni-\nforms, they have access to a shop with no limit on their daily spend, and they can have\npersonal effects such as games consoles. They are allowed to use computers for up to\nthree hours a day, though with no Internet access.\nStaff supervision is relatively minimal, with `controllers' or guards doing the rounds\nthrough the local sectors at various times in the day. The large grounds and open space\nof the zone, combined with the relatively self-regulated prison life, mean that illicit\nmobile phones and drugs come over the wall and are rife in Lithuanian prisons. Some\ninformal legacies of the Soviet period are also still present; there is a relatively rigid caste\nsystem in place. Subcultural codes frame social practices and interactions. Individual\nprison administrations still employ officers as `operatives' who recruit prisoners to\nbecome informers, a very Soviet version of dynamic security.\nLithuania has taken a soft and slow approach to reforming the collectivist aspects of\nthe Soviet-style colonies. The country signed up to a number of international obligations\nas part of its integration into the EU, NATO and the Council of Europe. The carrot of EU\nmembership, which came about in 2004, stimulated further reforms. A new Lithuanian\nCode of the Execution of Penalties was introduced in 2003, as was a new Criminal Code\n(Sakalauskas, 2014). Expert commentators believe that since that time reform processes\nhave stalled despite demands from EU institutions to reform the Soviet remnants in the\nsystem.2 The condition of Lithuanian correctional colonies has been used as grounds to\nappeal extradition. Violence in the system, owing to the open nature of the colonies and\nthe system of castes that still exists, has brought successful litigation against the govern-\nment by prisoners in the European Court of Human Rights (see, for example, Tautkus vs.\nYet, there are still intentions to reform the system. Much of this comes with interna-\ntional expertise. Sweden and Canada have been instrumental in assisting with alterna-\ntives to prison, improving juvenile justice and creating a probation service. With the help\nof Norwegian financing, for example, halfway house open colonies are being imple-\nmented. However, the real essence of these reform plans is a move to a `cell system'.\nCurrently this is planned for completion in 2022, though much scepticism remains. The\nplan involves a major period of new building and renovation of old buildings. The aim is\nto move prisoners out of barracks and provide closed living and social spaces along West\nEuropean lines. Principles and practices of `dynamic security', with the assistance of\nNorwegian funding, will replace the guards on prison fences (Prison Department of\nLithuania, 2015). The process of closing off the wide spaces of the colony has been in\nprogress since Lithuanian independence. Prison administrations have continually erected\nphysical barriers to produce higher numbers of so-called `local sectors' with fewer pris-\noners in them in order to undermine the caste system. Some sectors are designated to\nhold people in the higher caste, who live by Soviet criminal traditions, in an attempt to\nisolate and control the influence of this form of extra-legal prison governance.\nLithuania then represents a country affected intimately by the globalized mobility of\npeople and policies. The article now seeks to understand how these processes affect\nLithuanian prisoners' penal subjectivity. We will look at the internationalization of the\npenal experience of prisoners in Lithuania and how this affects the gap between expecta-\ntions and realities of punishment. We then turn to how mobility produces competing\nassessments among prisoners of internationally informed penal reform efforts and under-\nstandings of what a `better' system should look like. Before we turn to examine these\nissues, we briefly discuss the data that the subsequent analysis is based upon.\nData and methods\nThe data for the following sections come from a qualitative study of prison social life\nduring reform in selected post-Soviet countries. Lithuania was one of the case studies in\nthis project. In total, 56 in-depth interviews were carried out by the authors in Lithuania:\n5 of these were with experts (current and former policy makers and practitioners), 13\nwere with staff, including prison guards, social workers and a prison director, and 38\nwere conducted with prisoners across three penal institutions (all correctional houses)\nduring a one-month period. The three institutions were Alytus and Marijampol, correc-\ntional houses mainly for recidivists, high-risk offenders and drug addicts, and\nPravienisks, mainly holding first-time offenders. Interviews lasted 1 hour in most cases\nand were conducted in Lithuanian or Russian.\nQuestions focused on social relationships in the context of reforming Soviet-style bar-\nracks and `local sectors'. Questions were also asked about knowledge of government\nplans to construct a cell system and prisoner views about this. Upon analysis of the inter-\nviews we found that 39 percent (n = 15) of prisoner respondents had served a sentence\nabroad in a total of 11 different countries; 4 had experience of prison in multiple countries\nother than Lithuania. Every one of the 15 had spent time in a prison in another EU country.\nThree also had experience of other post-Soviet countries' prison systems, and two had\nbeen in prison during Soviet times. This variation in experience is shown in Table 1.\nThis sample of prisoners with international experience was random; we did not select\nprisoners with such experience intentionally. However, we do not believe that the per-\ncentage of those with prison experience abroad in our sample is somehow representative\nof the percentage of such prisoners in the broader Lithuanian prison population. There\nare a number of selection biases. Firstly, prisoners were selected with the help of social\nworkers, and the more assertive and talkative prisoners often self-selected to be inter-\nviewed. These types of qualities might also be important for a decision to emigrate.\nSecondly, the average age of our sample (33 years) was slightly older than the total\nprison population average (around 29 in 2012), and this may also have skewed the num-\nber of respondents we had with foreign prison experience. We do not include respondents\nwith no foreign prison experience in our analysis. However, these respondents also had\nvicarious knowledge of foreign prisons from others.\nLithuania is a very particular case that might not be straightforwardly generalizable.\nIt is a post-Soviet republic and therefore has a more distinct culture of punishment than\nother European jurisdictions. It has a particularly high level of out-migration (Europas\nmigracijos tinklas, 2013). Yet, in terms of migration Lithuania is far from unique,\nparticularly in comparison to the countries of Southern and Eastern Europe. Thus,\nalthough the following analysis is of a single case, the insights might be applicable to\nother places outside Lithuania.\nIn what follows we focus mainly on prisoners' comparisons between Lithuanian and\nWest European prisons; we include Estonia in this latter category because its prison sys-\ntem has been reformed to a cell type and no longer maintains Soviet-era colonies. On\nthese grounds, Latvia, Belarus and Russia do not qualify as `European' but these cases\nare still brought into the analysis where relevant and for comparative purposes. When\nproviding excerpts from interviews, we give respondents a changed name, state the\nprison where the interview took place and the foreign prison systems of which the\nrespondent had experience.\nComparative perspectives and penal subjectivity\nRespondent accounts demonstrated that the gap between expectations and the reality of\npunishment was indeed mediated by the comparative experience of prison abroad.\nHowever, the gap could be widened or shortened by the experience and this varied\naccording to the individual or the particular punitive referent \u00ad the given object that elic-\nited a sense of being punished (Sexton, 2015) \u00ad in question. For some, the prisons of\nWestern Europe were seen as `luxury' in terms of material conditions, privacy and secu-\nrity. For others, prison in Lithuania fitted with cultural expectations of punishment, eas-\ning the experience compared with what they had experienced abroad. Moreover, the\narchitectural style of the Soviet colony provided greater communality and freedom. This\nsection will highlight both types of perception, drawing on the narratives of the prisoners\nthemselves. The comparative narratives that the prisoners told revolved around certain\ncentral concepts that frame the discussion below. These are: dignity, autonomy, commu-\nnality, order, privacy and identity.\nRespondents compared their treatment by staff and expressed a sense of greater inhu-\nmanity and indignity at their treatment in Lithuania when compared with abroad. In other\nTable 1. The various countries in which respondents had had prison experience.\nPrison experience in ... Number of respondents\ncountries, respondents reported that staff had behaved in a more `cultured' manner. In\nLithuania, some respondents mentioned being viewed and addressed as non-human. As\none respondent, who had been transferred from Estonia to Lithuania on his own request,\nexplained:\nWhen I got here [Lithuania] I almost went crazy, I thought I'd landed back in the Soviet Union!\nThe beds are dirty. And the guards were always shouting. The whole night I was sitting there\nthinking, we had it was all so clean and well appointed [in Estonia]. And I thought, fuck me,\nwhy did I come here?!\n(Petras, Pravienisks \u00ad Estonia)3\nExpectations about how to be treated, based on experiences abroad, were wide of the\nreality and hence exacerbated the punishment gap once back in Lithuania. Respondents\nalso drew comparisons between management techniques and practices of formal govern-\nance of the prison population and how these affected their sense of being punished. One\nrespondent who had been in prison in Belarus and Sweden found Belarus to be more\ncomparable to Lithuania precisely in the methods of managing the prisoners and every-\nday routine:\nI understand it now. The type of prison you have, the type of state it is ... Sweden, well, of\ncourse, it's heaven you can say. It's so calm! Whereas here, [t]here are some things from Soviet\ntimes, like the roll call. Why force people out for a roll call when you have every opportunity\nto count them normally like they do in Europe?\n(Valery, Alytus \u00ad Belarus, Sweden)\nAfter the conditions of prisons in Western Europe, perhaps the main element of disil-\nlusionment was the material conditions in the often decrepit and old colonies of Lithuania.\nThe food was a point of contention, as was cleanliness. Owing to the poor food, condi-\ntions in the dormitories and distant and hostile relations with staff, prisoners in Lithuania,\nas in Soviet times, maintain a sense of self-reliance. Yet, while this produced relative\ndeprivation in relation to material conditions and well-being, self-help and autonomy\ncould also be important sources of dignity that some respondents felt had been denied to\nthem when abroad. Thus, some suggested they had lost a sense of independence while\nabroad that could be rediscovered in the colony in Lithuania.\nIn Germany ... nobody makes decisions themselves, they are not taught to do this ... if someone\nhas an issue they shout to the guard... I mean, they are not capable of resolving their own\nissues. And when it's like that, when people tell you exactly how to live then when you get out\nit's going to be even harder to live isn't it? Because you'll be used to having people doing things\nfor you... But [in Lithuania] you can go outside get a book, watch TV, just sit and chat.\n(Jonas, Alytus \u00ad Germany)\nAs this respondent suggests, the cell systems of prisons in Western Europe did not\nnecessarily fit with what Lithuanians expected from punishment. A cell system for\nLithuanians, as for other post-Soviet nationalities, is associated with Soviet use of cells.\nThe Soviets used cells exclusively for police investigation units, remand or the segrega-\ntion unit in colonies. Thus, cells represent extreme dependence, vulnerability, extra pun-\nishment, and a sense of loss of dignity and autonomy. Transfer to a colony represented a\nmove to a more open space, dormitory living, heightened interaction and greater\nautonomy:\nYou can walk around in this big sector, you can go down to the yard ... somebody is watching\na movie or playing dominos in the sector ... You take some fresh air or you go to the gym or\nvisit somebody for a cup of tea. It is a different situation when you are in a closed cell.\n(Vytautas, Alytus \u00ad England)\nSome respondents, arriving in Lithuanian colonies from cell systems, describe a sense\nof relief and the colony as `small freedom'. The desire for the perceived freedom and\nautonomy in a colony moved two respondents to request transfers back to Lithuania. One\nrespondent decided he wanted a move back to Lithuania from Estonia after discussing it\nwith other Lithuanian prisoners there because, as he put it, `[Lithuania] still has the camp\nsystem, it's open, you can go out in the yard, use telephones, everything is possible'\n(Petras, Pravienisks \u00ad Estonia). A separate respondent did not like the reformed cell sys-\ntem of Estonia because of the restrictions on activity and movement. He was transferred\nback to Pravienisks, a large colony (1400 prisoners) in central Lithuania, even though\nfamily members remained behind in Estonia:\nIn Estonia I was inside for two and a half [years] \u00ad in a cell ... it's enough! I asked to be moved\nhere because this is a colony, I live here like I'm at home ... Now I want to walk and walk and\nwalk. It's freedom here. It is. I feel freedom.\n(Gintaras, Pravienisks \u00ad Estonia)\nFor both of these respondents, the punishment gap was narrowed significantly by the\nfamiliarity of Lithuanian punitive practices compared with those elsewhere. These two\nrespondents had similar histories of transfer from the same place, Estonia, but very dif-\nferent reasons for wanting the transfer. Gintaras was particularly athletic and simply felt\nthat the colony suited him better to be active. He reported that he was something of a\nloner and not interested in involving himself in the subcultural caste system or gangs that\nare prevalent in Lithuanian colonies. Although he wanted the freedom of movement of\nthe colony, he did not want the interaction. The other respondent, Petras, lived by the\nsubcultural `understandings' of Soviet times, supported the caste system, but felt he was\nbetter able to express this in the interactive everyday life of the Lithuanian colony rather\nthan in Estonian cells where the subculture had weakened. Thus, the sense of closing the\npunishment gap for one was about the freedom to be active, for the other it was about the\nease of achieving social respect and standing in a familiar context. Both of these respond-\nents worked with an implicit comparative understanding of what punishment was to\nthem as Lithuanians while in prison abroad. This understanding grounded their justifica-\ntions for requesting transfers to Lithuania.\nAlthough freedom and autonomy may be one advantage of the Lithuanian colony\ncompared with international experiences, order and privacy are not so well guaranteed\nand appear to exacerbate the punishment gap after prison abroad. In the communal con-\nditions of the colony, order depends on strong subcultural understandings and informal\ninstitutions. Yet, deliberate problematizing and targeting by prison administrations has\nsignificantly weakened these structures. In Lithuania, a decline in the generalized Soviet\ninmate code has led to an increase in the presence of city- or region-based gangs who\nexist in wary equilibrium of each other. Moreover, drugs are a big problem for the main-\ntenance of order but appear to be highly prevalent and largely un-policed in the auton-\nomy of the dormitory and local sector. Thus, many respondents found, relative to their\nexperiences abroad, that order was not guaranteed in such a system:\nSometimes [other prisoners] will just take things off you, your clothes ... There are people in\nhere who have been sitting two or three years without meeting anyone, they never come out,\nthey close themselves off completely from this system. There are so many like that. Out of fear.\n(Daumantas, Alytus \u00ad Russia, Germany, Italy, Estonia)\nStaff respondents corroborated this claim. They reported that some prisoners deliber-\nately broke rules to engineer a move to the segregation unit in order to be removed from\ntheir dormitories and placed in a cell. Milhaud and Moran (2013) report similar findings\nin Russian prisons operating colonies similar to those in Lithuania. Violence is difficult\nto measure but it is certainly a problem that has been highlighted in a number of cases\nthat relate directly to the control that the prisoner caste system still exerts. Some cases\nhave gone to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), where the Lithuanian state\nhas been found culpable for failing to provide protection from gangs or caste-based vic-\ntimization (for example, Tautkus vs. Lithuania 2009; Human Rights Europe, 2015).\nConflict can stem from a lack of privacy. This is clear to any visitor to a colony dormi-\ntory, where prisoners clearly try to create their own space with bed sheets and towels only\nto have these taken down when the controllers come around for a check-up. Lack of pri-\nvacy and overcrowding have been other substantial grounds for cases that have gone to the\nECHR (see Mironovas and others vs. Lithuania 2015). Although the ECHR in some of\nthese cases notes the poor conditions within the dormitories, it also recognizes that the free\nmovement and space provided by the colony during the day can offset the ill effects of the\npoor indoor environment. Nevertheless, in such a situation, with a deteriorating subculture\nand a weakening of the attendant normative strictures on the use of violence, frustrations\nwith co-inhabitants can boil over. In cases of conflict, prisoners may simply move of their\nown accord during the day to spend time in other dorms, coming back to their `detachment'\nonly to sleep. In some respects, this also demonstrates a level of autonomy and freedom of\nassociation. However, other prisoners or gangs may also force such movement. For prison-\ners with international experience this compared badly with their experience abroad, where\nthey were moved in the event of conflict and generally had less interaction.\nIn Germany, for example, you can say, I don't like you and don't want to see you and they will\nmove you. It's written in the law there that you can choose ... but here every day you see that\nsame person ... and you feel that tension every day and you can't get out of it. [The staff] will\ntell you, you have to stay here, they can do it on purpose even, as an extra punishment.\n(Daumantas, Alytus \u00ad Russia, Germany, Italy, Estonia)\nMany respondents made this claim of extraordinary and informal punishment through\nforcing bad company on troublesome individuals. Thus, those who, while abroad, had\nfelt relatively empowered in choosing whom they shared physical space with keenly felt\na lack of privacy back in Lithuania. Yet, for some, considerations of privacy versus\nautonomy were not as important as a general sense of familiar personal identity when\nback in Lithuania. In line with findings from studies of foreign nationals in UK prisons\nLithuanians in prison abroad often felt that their status as non-citizens stigmatized them\nand created insecurities they simply did not feel back in Lithuania. Furthermore, for\nmany the diversity of prisoners in Western prisons, highlighted by scholars of the crimi-\nnology of mobility, created problems of integration, belonging and mutual recognition\nand respect. This was especially true in comparison with the simpler caste system and\nethnic homogeneity of Lithuanian prisons.\nThus, one respondent had wanted to be removed from UK prison as quickly as he\ncould, despite his wife living in the country. The same forces of globalization and mobil-\nity that had brought him to the UK had created a diversity and cultural mix that he was\nuncomfortable with. He preferred the relatively straightforward ethnic relations of\nLithuanian colonies comprising mainly Lithuanian prisoners alongside minority groups\nof Poles and Russians.\nIn England the judge ... said that there is a lot of talk about the conditions [in Lithuanian\nprisons] and so maybe they will not need to deport me to Lithuania. But I wanted to come back\nto Lithuania as soon as possible ... because [in the UK] there are, you know, Muslims and it is\nnot acceptable for me to sit with those kinds of people ... I do not want to be inside with black\npeople or Muslims.\n(Vytautas, Alytus \u00ad England)\nCompared with Lithuania, racial and ethnic mixing was experienced as part of the pun-\nishment for this respondent, threatening and diluting any sense of identity other than a\nforeign national prisoner. Social relations inside the Lithuanian colony were easier to\nnegotiate and on the respondent's return home the punishment gap, on this measure, was\nshortened. The issue of identity then, along with the more familiar philosophy and prac-\ntices of punishment, was an important factor in mediating the subjective experience of\nprison upon return home.\nThere are then ambiguities in the subjective experience of punishment that incar-\ncerated returned migrants feel. These ambiguities stem from the fundamental differ-\nences in the cultures of punishment in Western Europe compared with the post-Soviet\nregion, born out of two different visions of penal modernization in capitalist and\ncommunist societies. These differences relate to dignity, autonomy and communality,\nas well as to privacy and order. Moreover, familiarity and national identity also shaped\nsubjective experiences of the current confinement. Respondents discussed their\nimprisonment in Lithuania in all of these terms yet comparison was a key frame of\nreference for understanding their punishment's severity and salience and their ability\nto find dignity and respect now back in their country of origin. Thus, penal mobility\ncan have variable effects on the gap between expectations and actual experiences of\npunishment.\nWe now turn in greater detail to this issue of legitimation and contestation in the\nLithuanian penitentiary system with particular reference to the issue of prison reform. As\ndiscussed previously, the reform to a cell system away from the colony form of punish-\nment is ongoing in Lithuania and there has been a great deal of international influence on\nreform processes in the criminal justice sector from the EU, Scandinavian countries and\nCanada. Thus, in Lithuania internationalized prisoners meet internationally driven penal\nreform projects in their everyday environment. The next section looks at how they make\nsense of such projects comparatively.\nComparing and contesting reform\nAll respondents were aware of the planned reform project to change to a cell system by\n2022 and gave opinions on it. Most were sceptical about the possibility that it would\never be fully implemented. The same concepts of dignity, autonomy, communality,\norder, privacy and identity frame discussions about the type of prison that Lithuanian\nprisoners expect and the type of reform they find acceptable. Many prisoners who pos-\nsess international experience are ambivalent about the reforms, preferring elements of\nthe familiar Soviet-style culture of punishment, finding some European reforms inap-\npropriate for the Lithuanian reality, at the same time as recognizing the potentials ben-\nefits of Europeanization.\nRespondents reported that the aims of the reforms did not affect their sense of punish-\nment as much as the manner in which reforms were carried out. In particular, piecemeal\nattempts to move towards European norms were felt to increase penal impact and suffer-\ning. This related in particular to reforms that reduced autonomy and independence such\nas reductions in allowances for personal belongings, spending restrictions in the prison\nshop, or the reduction in size of local sectors to reduce the prominence of informal gov-\nernance through the caste system. Once again comparing with conditions in Western\nEurope, respondents reported that such reforms were not carried out with the necessary\nand corresponding changes to compensate them. Attempts to limit what could be bought\nat the prison shop produced a countrywide hunger strike in 2012 involving 80 percent of\nthe prison population.4 The shop limit was lifted, but there is a constant readiness to fight\nother, similar, reforms:\nNow they are saying they can ... limit what we can bring into the zona [colony] ourselves. I can\nbring 30kg in and they say \u00ad `what do you need it for?'I'm saying I need it; I need a coat against\nthe cold because they give you nothing here. And they say they are doing it like in Europe, but\nin Europe they give you everything! Blankets and underwear, socks, you don't need anything\nthere, that's why they can do it ... Then they say: `You buy so much from the shop.'And they\nsay `in Europe you can only buy sweets and biscuits at the shop'; well of course because they\nprovide decent food there.\n(Daumantas, Alytus \u00ad Russia, Germany, Italy, Estonia)\nThe main theme in the narratives concerning these reforms was concern over a shift\nto a dependent position and reliance on prison regimes after the relative autonomy of\nthe colony system. As the prison administration closed down avenues for self-reliance,\nprisoners would be slowly closed in and forced into dependency on the regime. The\npains of imprisonment were being reconfigured by the reform. A clear example con-\ncerned visiting rights. Visits in Lithuania are permissive compared with those in other\njurisdictions. Conjugal visits are possible, visiting times are longer and greater freedom\nof movement is permitted during visits. One respondent, Antanas (Pravienisks \u00ad\nEngland), compared this situation favourably with the UK, where conjugal visits are not\npermitted. Respondents were scathing about any changes to the rights to visits in the\nname of European reform. Yet, the reform was already ongoing and there was a sense of\nforeboding in many narratives; the reform would only cause greater suffering, conflict\nand resistance. Moreover, as one respondent mentioned, such suffering could be justi-\nfied by referring to how things are done in Europe:\nThey don't want to manage us, no \u00ad they want to slowly put us in cells so they can control each\nperson, close them in. They want to take away our visits, because they can say that visits don't\nhappen in Europe. To take it away though, we will riot, hunger strike and so on, in every camp\nand prison in Lithuania.\n(Jonas, Alytus \u00ad Germany)\nIncreased violence and disturbances during prison reform have been recorded in other\npost-Soviet cases (Piacentini and Slade, 2015; Slade, 2015). The ability to organize\nresistance in such contexts is grounded in the complex forms of informal group govern-\nance that have developed in the open spaces of prison colonies such as those in Lithuania.\nPrisoners subordinate themselves to the informal norms and institutions created within\nthese spaces more readily than they do to the administrative prison regime. As we have\nseen, such self-organization can be perceived as either increasing or decreasing the\nseverity of punishment depending on the individual, creating order for some and insecu-\nrity for others. Staff respondents were candid that the cell-system reform in Lithuania, in\npart incentivized by high-profile cases of violence censured by the ECHR, was aimed at\nreducing informal governance forms by the caste system and gangs. Reforms have\nalready shrunk the size of local sectors to make them more manageable. Those who pro-\nfess strong affiliation with the criminal subculture \u00ad often referred to as `mafiosi' by\nrespondents \u00ad were separated and confined to their own local sector with high walls and\nsituated far from the other inmates.\nThese reforms also produced conflicting narratives about respondents' feelings of\nbeing punished. In a context where the penal system provides few opportunities to\nimprove skills to aid reintegration in society upon release and provisions for resettlement\nare poor, the social life of the colony is seen by some respondents as a compensatory\nmechanism in which prisoners may nurture social skills that are useful upon release.\nAgain, respondents with international experience expressed frustration that the provi-\nsions given to prisoners in other parts of Europe were not available to them at a time\nwhen reform would leave them ever more deprived. Space was a critical matter in this.\nThe sense of space closing in, local sectors getting smaller and social circles narrowing\nalso produced feelings that suggested reform was in fact widening the punishment gap.\nSome respondents reported that they tried to arrange a move into the most spacious sec-\ntors to maintain the communality that they felt was characteristic of the penal colony:\nOther local sectors are smaller. We have greenness, grass and it gives you a lot, that. [In other]\nsectors ... you go out and all that you can see is the sky and concrete. [We] can get a tan, lie\ndown on the grass! It makes a difference.\n(Vladimir, Alytus \u00ad Spain)\nThis was not true for everyone of course, and some who had been in prison abroad had\ngot used to the privacy and welcomed the move to the cell system on these terms.\nI liked being in a one-man cell [in Sweden]; you can be yourself, maybe some people wouldn't\nlike it, there's less communication. But for me if they open the doors in the morning and close\nyou in in the evening then in the evening you are dedicated only to yourself.\n(Valery, Alytus \u00ad Belarus and Sweden)\nReform in Lithuania is a contested notion by those in the prison population who have\nspent time in prison abroad. Certainly, some prisoners rejected the cell-system reform\ncompletely based on their experience in other countries in Europe. However, most narra-\ntives were more complex: internationalized Lithuanian prisoners do not reject the move\nto a cell system absolutely, but feel that such reform is skewed towards changes that\nincrease the pains of imprisonment without any of the ameliorating conditions of Western\nEuropean prisons that would make such changes tolerable. Respondents often believed\nthat notions of `Europeanness' were employed by reformers to justify particular undesir-\nable reforms, such as limits on spending in the shop or the allowances on personal\nbelongings. Referencing a reform as `European', `in line with EU norms'or `to European\nstandards' uncritically implied that this was shorthand for quality or humaneness.\nConclusion\nThis article suggests new avenues of enquiry concerning the relationship between glo-\nbalization and punishment. Firstly, the criminology of mobility assumes that globaliza-\ntion is radically altering the interplay of punishment and identity. This article suggests\nthat this proposition should be examined in cases outside of Western Europe. Our case\nstudy shows that many Lithuanian prisoners have experienced prison abroad and that this\naffects individual perceptions of punishment not only in terms of identity. Secondly,\nthere is a growing literature on the global flows of criminological expertise, policy and\nreform packages but few studies directly link these to their effects on individual subjects.\nThis article demonstrates that while Lithuanian politicians seek international expertise\nand foreign models to reconstruct the physical basis of the Lithuanian penitentiary sys-\ntem, internationalized prisoners are able to articulate comparative analyses concerning\nwhat they seek from these reforms in terms of identity, order, privacy, dignity, commu-\nnality and autonomy. Thus, there is much more that could be said about the links between\nthe international dimensions of penal reform and prisoners' internationalized under-\nstandings of punishment.\nAs regards such understandings, we have utilized the concept of penal subjectivity\n(Sexton, 2012, 2015) for interpreting the narratives of prisoners who have been incarcer-\nated in numerous countries. Sexton's framework emphasizes the impact of comparison,\nvicariousness and intersubjective assessments of punishment on penal suffering. Building\non this insight, this article suggests that international experience facilitates comparison,\nwhich in turn informs penal subjectivity and affects the punishment gap by adding an\nextra dimension to penal suffering.\nThus, this article makes the case that research that aims to reconceptualize the pains of\nimprisonment (Crewe, 2011), measure penal impact (Hayes, 2016) or map penal con-\nsciousness (Sexton, 2015) may find internationalization a confounding factor that requires\nscholarly attention owing to the increasing numbers of people with experiences of more\nthan one culture of punishment. Moreover, Pallot et al. (2012) argued that, in the case of\nRussia, forcible movement while incarcerated was itself an additional pain of imprison-\nment. Prisoners in Europe will become increasingly mobile as intergovernmental agree-\nments on transfer become active and prisoner consent will not be required. The effects of\nthis on subjective experiences of punishment should be of interest to criminologists.\nFinally, in Lithuania, both policy makers and prisoners perceive the evolution of the\npenal system in terms of becoming `European'. The internationalized prisoner body,\nhowever, does not accept this process uncritically. Unfortunately, prisoner voices are\nlikely to remain relatively unheard. As has been argued elsewhere (Piacentini and Slade,\n2015), many penal reform projects in the post-Soviet region have been carried out with-\nout any thought to a broader discussion of what prisoners expect from punishment cul-\nturally and how certain forms of collectivism might be desirable. Meanwhile, prison\nreform advocates in Western European countries argue for less individualizing, more\nopen and communal prison designs (Hancock and Jewkes, 2011). Thus, while reform\ndevelops along opposite trajectories in different parts of Europe and the notion of\n`European penology' becomes disputed, we suggest that, owing to mobility, prisoners\nthemselves have become better able to assess the merits of these different philosophies\nand approaches. The incredible mobility that characterizes modern Europe may well be\nshifting understandings of penality from the inside, transforming local cultures of pun-\nishment, providing new bases of contestation \u00ad especially over reform \u00ad and filling pris-\nons with comparative criminologists.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/\nor publication of this article: The qualitative study of prison social life during reform in selected\npost-Soviet countries was funded by the European Commission FP7 framework through the Marie\nCurie Foundation and the German Excellence Initiative as part of a COFUND fellowship.

Formally penitentiary institutions in Lithuania are called `correctional houses' and contain\nalmost all of the male prisoner population. There is only one actual jail in Lithuania with a\ncell system for remand prisoners and those on life sentences. When we use the term `prison'\nin this article we are referring to Lithuanian correctional houses.\n2.
