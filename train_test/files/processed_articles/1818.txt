Bilirubin is a potent\nantioxidant under physiological conditions.1 It acts as an\nantioxidant whether it is free or albumin bound,2 unconju-\ngated or conjugated,3,4 and it inhibits both lipid and protein\noxidation.5 Bilirubin protects cells from a 10 000-fold excess\nof oxidants through rapid regeneration of bilirubin by biliv-\nerdin reductase.6 Additionally, bilirubin exerts antiinflamma-\ntory effects on the vasculature.7,8 Oxidative stress and\ninflammation are fundamental to the pathogenesis of athero-\nsclerosis.9\u00ad11 The inverse association of serum total bilirubin\nwith coronary artery disease (CAD) suggests that the antiin-\nflammatory and antioxidant properties of bilirubin might\noffer protection from atherosclerosis.12\nPeripheral arterial disease (PAD) is an important manifes-\ntation of atherosclerosis, associated with significant morbid-\nity including intermittent claudication, critical limb ischemia,\nand amputation, and portends a 2- to 6-fold increased cardio-\nvascular mortality risk.13,14 Although risk factors such as\ncigarette smoking and diabetes mellitus are known to be\nimportant risk factors for PAD, little is known about endog-\nenous protective mechanisms that reduce the risk of PAD.\nGiven the remarkable antioxidant, cytoprotective, and an-\ntiinflammatory properties of bilirubin, and the role of inflam-\nmation, oxidative stress, and cellular injury in atherosclerosis,\nwe hypothesized that individuals with higher bilirubin level\nwould be less likely to develop PAD. We therefore examined\nthe association of bilirubin level with prevalent PAD in the\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999 to\n2004, a nationally representative cross-sectional examination\nof the United States civilian population.\nMethods\nThe National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES)\nis a program designed to assess the health and nutritional status of\nadults and children in the United States.

Those\nwho weighed over 400 pounds or had bilateral amputations were not\neligible. Participants lay supine during the examination. Systolic\npressure was measured on the right arm (brachial artery) and at both\nankles (posterior tibial arteries) using an 8-MHz Doppler probe. If\nthe right arm could not be used, the left arm was used. Each limb\npressure was measured twice in participants aged 40 to 59 years and\nonce in participants 60 years and older. The ankle brachial blood\npressure index (ABI) was automatically calculated (Parks Mini-\nLaboratory IV, Model 3100) by dividing the systolic blood pressure\nat the ankle by the brachial artery systolic blood pressure. PAD was\ndefined as either leg ABI being 0.90. If neither leg ABI was 0.90\nand either leg ABI was 1.40, that subject was excluded from this\nanalysis because of noncompressible vessels.\nLaboratory Methods\nSerum total bilirubin, albumin, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase\n(AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and glucose were deter-\nmined by automated biochemical profiling (Beckman Synchron\nLX20); fractionation of total bilirubin was not performed. The LX20\nuses a timed end point Diazo method to measure the total bilirubin\nlevel. The analytical range for this assay is 0.1 to 30 mg/dL, and the\nreference range is 0.2 to 1.3 mg/dL. C-reactive protein was quanti-\nfied by latex-enhanced nephelometry. Total cholesterol and HDL\ncholesterol were measured by automated enzymatic assay (Hitachi\n704 Analyzer serviced by Roche Diagnostics). Total homocysteine\nin plasma was measured by the Abbott Homocysteine assay.\nCovariates\nSelf-reported race was defined as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic\nblack, Mexican-American, or other. A diagnosis of hypertension was\nassigned if the subject reported a physician diagnosis of hyperten-\nsion, if the subject reported taking prescription medications for\nhypertension, or if the systolic blood pressure was 140 mm Hg or\nthe diastolic blood pressure was 90 mm Hg. A diagnosis of\nhypercholesterolemia was assigned if the subject reported a physi-\ncian diagnosis of hypercholesterolemia, if the subject reported taking\nprescription medications for hypercholesterolemia, or if the total\ncholesterol level was 62.1 mmol/L (240 mg/dL). A diagnosis of\ndiabetes mellitus was assigned if the subject reported a physician\ndiagnosis of diabetes, if the subject reported taking prescription\nmedications (either insulin or oral agents) for diabetes, if nonfasting\nplasma glucose was 11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL), or if fasting plasma\nglucose was 7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL). Subjects were characterized\nas active smokers if the subject answered yes to \"do you now smoke\ncigarettes\", as former smokers if they were not active smokers and\nthey answered yes to \"have you smoked at least 100 cigarettes in\nyour life\", or as never smokers if they denied smoking at least 100\ncigarettes. Alcohol intake was categorized as 1 drink per day, 1 to\n4 drinks per day, or 5 drinks per day. The presence of active liver\ndisease was determined by the subject's answer to the questions \"Has\na doctor or other health professional ever told you that you have liver\ndisease?\" and \"Do you still have a liver condition?\" We used the\nModification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study equation for\nestimating glomerular filtration rate (GFR) from serum creatinine\nmale)(1.210 if African American). Subjects whose estimated GFR\nwas 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 were classified as having chronic kidney\ndisease.15,16 Further laboratory and examination details are available at\nhttp://www.cdc.gov/nchs/about/major/nhanes/datalink.htm.\nDerivation of the Sample\nfor noncompressible vessels. Of the remaining subjects, 7075 had\ncomplete information on the main covariates of interest and therefore\nconstitute the sample used in this analysis. Of these subjects, 6924\nhad alcohol intake data available.\nStatistical Analysis\nNHANES uses a complex, multistage, probability-sampling design\nto select participants representative of the civilian, noninstitutional-\nized U.S. population. All analyses accounted for the complex\nsampling method.

Subject characteristics are reported as the\nweighted mean and standard error (SE) or the weighted percentile\nand SE, unless indicated otherwise. Odds ratios and 95% confidence\nintervals (CI) were estimated by logistic regression. Based on\nrecognized risk factors for lower extremity PAD and previous\nanalyses in the NHANES, age, gender (female versus male), race/\nethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican Amer-\nican, other), hypertension (yes versus no), diabetes mellitus (yes\nversus no), hypercholesterolemia (yes versus no), chronic kidney\ndisease (yes versus no), smoking status (never, former, active),\nCRP level (1 mg/L, 1 to 3 mg/L, 3 mg/L)18 were adjusted for in\nWe examined the likelihood of PAD associated with a 0.1 mg/dL\nincrease and by a 1 standard deviation (0.28 mg/dL) increase in\nbilirubin level.

We\nalso examined a priori whether smoking status influenced the\nassociation of bilirubin level with PAD, as has been suggested\npreviously.22 For analyses examining the interaction of smoking\nstatus with bilirubin level, subjects were characterized either as\nnonsmokers or active smokers.\nResults\n0.90. The weighted mean prevalence of PAD was 5.8%\n(0.3). Subject characteristics are summarized in Table 1. The\nmean serum total bilirubin was 0.70 (0.01) mg/dL, the median\nwas 0.60 mg/dL. The distribution of bilirubin levels can be\nseen in the Figure.\nSerum total bilirubin level was associated with multiple\nsubject characteristics (Table 2). Female gender, non-\nHispanic black race/ethnicity, active smoking status, and\nhigher CRP category were associated with lower bilirubin\nlevels, whereas higher homocysteine category was associated\nwith higher bilirubin levels.\nPAD was also associated with multiple subject character-\nistics (Table 1). Increasing age, non-Hispanic black race/\nethnicity, hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia,\nsmoking, chronic kidney disease, higher CRP level, and\nhigher homocysteine level were all associated with an in-\ncreased likelihood of PAD, in agreement with previous\nAssociation of Serum Total Bilirubin\nLevel With PAD\nSubjects with PAD had a significantly lower mean total\nPerlstein et al Bilirubin and PAD 167\nhttp://atvb.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\nprevalence was lower among subjects with higher bilirubin\nlevels (Ptrend\n0.001; Figure).

We\ndid not find evidence that this association is dependent on\nbilirubin levels beyond the reference range, on the presence\nof liver disease, or on alcohol intake. These data, together\nwith evidence from experimental atherosclerosis, are consis-\ntent with the hypothesis that bilirubin is an endogenous\nprotectant mechanism against PAD.\nInflammation and oxidative stress are essential to the\npathogenesis of atherosclerosis.9\u00ad11 Bilirubin is a antioxidant\nunder physiological conditions and suppresses inflammation\nin the vasculature.1,7 Additionally, bilirubin functions as a\ncytoprotectant.6 These properties appear to allow bilirubin to\ninhibit multiple steps in atherogenesis. Bilirubin inhibits\ninflammatory cytokine-induced endothelial cell expression of\nvascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1,7 an initial step in\natherosclerosis.9 Bilirubin also inhibits monocyte transmigra-\ntion,25 prevents the formation of oxidized LDL,26 inhibits\nendothelial inflammation and dysfunction,8 inhibits vascular\nsmooth muscle proliferation,27 and prevents thrombus forma-\ntion.28 Human studies demonstrate that low bilirubin is\nassociated with impaired endothelial function and increased\ncarotid intima media thickness, 2 predictors of atherosclero-\nsis, in healthy individuals free of cardiovascular risk fac-\ntors.29,30 These data provide a biological basis for the inverse\nassociation of bilirubin with PAD, a manifestation of sys-\ntemic atherosclerosis.\nIt is important to consider bilirubin not in isolation but\nrather in the context of it being a product of heme oxygenase\n(HO), the rate-limiting enzyme in heme catabolism that\ngenerates biliverdin, the bilirubin precursor. HO is one of\nseveral enzymes that are induced by inflammation or oxida-\ntive stress and that limit vascular damage.10 Multiple lines of\nevidence support an atheroprotective role for HO-1, the\nisoform of HO expressed in the blood vessel wall.31,32 HO-1\nis induced by multiple cardiovascular risk factors including\nsmoking and hypercholesterolemia. Its induction decreases\nand its inhibition increases experimental atherosclerosis.33,34\nSeveral investigators have found that the vascular-protective\neffects of HO can be reproduced by the administration of\nbilirubin or biliverdin, suggesting that the production of\nbilirubin is a major component of the vascular protection\nOur result is similar to the inverse relationship reported\nbetween bilirubin level and CAD.12,35 Two studies in this area\nare particularly noteworthy. The first is a report of the\nremarkably low prevalence of CAD in patients with Gilbert\nsyndrome, a hereditary unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia sec-\nondary to congenital deficiency of uridine diphosphate-\nanalysis of the prospective relationship between genetic\nvariation in UGT1 and risk for cardiovascular disease\n(CVD).38 The variation in UGT1 associated with higher\nbilirubin levels was associated with one-third the risk of\nCVD. After adjustment for bilirubin level, the association\nbetween UGT1 variation and CVD risk all but disappeared.\nThe association of bilirubin level with PAD tended to be\nstronger in men than in women. Some but not all studies have\nfound that the relationship between bilirubin and CAD varies\nby gender.20,21 The biology underlying a possible gender-\nbased difference in the association of bilirubin with PAD is\nnot clear and requires investigation. We did not find that\ndifferences in HDL cholesterol accounted for the differential\nassociation of bilirubin with PAD in men and women, a\npossibility suggested by Hunt and colleagues.21 To the extent\nthat bilirubin level is related to oxidative stress,39,40 our result\nis similar to finding that F2\nisoprostane level is more\nweakly associated with coronary calcification in women than\nWe found the inverse association of bilirubin level with\nPAD among active smokers to be striking. Smoking is\nknown to be associated with lower bilirubin levels.39 We\nspeculate that the potential protection offered by an en-\ndogenous antioxidant such as bilirubin might be greatest\namong individuals exposed to a source of oxidant stress\nsuch as cigarette smoke.\nStrengths of the present study include the national repre-\nsentative nature of the NHANES cohort, that the ABI method\nhas excellent performance characteristics for the diagnosis of\nPAD,13 and that the comprehensive nature of the NHANES\nallowed adjustment for important PAD risk factors. Despite\nthese strengths, several limitations warrant consideration. The\nABI was determined from the blood pressure in a single arm\nand subjects 60 years of age had the blood pressure\nmeasured only once, potential sources of misclassification: a\ncohort within which the blood pressure was measured more\nthan once in each limb could provide a more precise estimate\nof the association of bilirubin with PAD. Plasma bilirubin\nlevels exhibit significant within subject variability42; the\nNHANES performs only a single blood draw, perhaps further\nlimiting the precision of our bilirubin effect estimate. Also,\nthe antioxidant and antiinflammatory properties of bilirubin\nmay vary depending whether it is conjugated or unconju-\ngated,4 and the NHANES only measured total and not\nfractionated bilirubin level. Although this cross-sectional\nstudy demonstrates an association of increased serum biliru-\nbin with reduced prevalence of PAD, prospective studies are\nneeded to determine the temporal nature of the association,\nand causation cannot be established. Reverse causation is a\npossible explanation for our findings, although prospective\nstudies have demonstrated an inverse association of bilirubin\nlevel with cardiovascular risk.38 The finding that the associ-\nation of bilirubin level with risk for ischemic heart disease\nmay in fact be U-shaped highlights the need for prospective\nstudies of bilirubin level and risk for PAD.43,44\nIn summary, increased serum total bilirubin level is asso-\nciated with a reduced likelihood of PAD. This association is\nnot dependent on elevated bilirubin levels, liver disease, or\nalcohol intake, is stronger in men compared with women, and\nis stronger in smokers compared with nonsmokers. Further\nwork, including prospective epidemiological studies, is\nneeded to better illuminate the role of bilirubin in determining\nsusceptibility to PAD. Bilirubin, with strong antiinflamma-\ntory and antioxidant properties, may be an important endog-\nenous protectant from PAD.\n"
