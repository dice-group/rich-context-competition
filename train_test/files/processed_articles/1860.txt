Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) is the cause of most genital herpes and is\nalmost always sexually transmitted. In contrast, HSV-1 is usually transmitted during\nchildhood via nonsexual contacts. Preexisting HSV-1 antibodies can alleviate clinical\nmanifestations of subsequently acquired HSV-2. Furthermore, HSV-1 has become an\nimportant cause of genital herpes in some developed countries.\nObjective To examine trends in HSV-1 and HSV-2 seroprevalence in the United States\nDesign, Settings, and Participants Cross-sectional, nationally representative sur-\nveys (US National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys [NHANES]), were used\nviewed. Persons aged 14 to 49 years were included in these analyses.\nMain Outcome Measures Seroprevalence of HSV-1 and HSV-2 antibodies based\non results from type-specific immunodot assays; diagnosis of genital herpes.\nResults The overall age-adjusted HSV-2 seroprevalence was 17.0% (95% confi-\n17 to 19 years and young adults, the decreases in HSV-2 seroprevalence were signifi-\ncant even after adjusting for changes in sexual behaviors.

Seroprevalence of HSV-1 decreased but the incidence of genital herpes caused\nby HSV-1 may be increasing.\nChanges in HSV-1 seroprevalence\ncan alter the clinical manifestations of\nsubsequently acquired HSV-2 infec-\ntion. Compared with persons seroposi-\ntive for HSV-1, those persons lacking\nHSV-1 antibodies are almost 3 times\nmore likely to have a symptomatic\nHSV-1 may also influence decisions\nabout HSV-2 vaccination strategies be-\ncause the vaccine that is being clini-\ncally tested may be efficacious only in\nthose seronegative for HSV-1.24\nSerosurveys have been one of\nthe best approaches to study the\nepidemiology of HSV infections. In the\nUnited States, data from National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination\n(NHANES III) indicated that the\noverall seroprevalence of HSV-2\nHSV-1seroprevalencewasunchanged.26\nWe examined national trends in HSV-1\nMETHODS\nStudy Population\nand Survey Design\nThe NHANES are a series of cross-\nsectional national surveys conducted by\nthe National Center for Health Statis-\ntics. Details of the survey methods have\nbeenpublishedpreviously.27 Briefly,dur-\ning each survey, a random sample of the\nUS civilian, noninstitutionalized popu-\nlation was selected using a complex,\nstratified, multistage probability sample\ndesign. Some populations, such as ado-\nlescents,non-Hispanicblacks,andMexi-\ncan Americans were oversampled. Per-\nsons selected for the surveys were\ninterviewed and underwent a health ex-\nredesigned to become a continuous sur-\nvey using otherwise similar methods. A\nnationally representative sample of the\nUS civilian, noninstitutionalized popu-\nlation is selected each year and usually\ndata from 2 or more years are com-\nbined to achieve adequate sample sizes\nfor analyses.

We estimated HSV-1 and HSV-2\nseroprevalence by age, sex, and race/\nethnicity according to NHANES de-\nsign domains. Confidence intervals\n(CIs) for the seroprevalence estimates\nwere calculated based on a log trans-\nformation with the SE calculated us-\ning the  method.31 Differences in se-\nroprevalence between the surveys were\nconsidered to be statistically signifi-\ncant if the 2-sampled t test had a P value\nRace/ethnicity categories were nearly\nas non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic\nwhite, and Mexican American.

The reasons for missing\nresults may include refusal or unsuc-\ncessful venipuncture or the need to\nuse serum for other tests. We investi-\ngated the impact of the missing sero-\nlogical results on HSV-1 and HSV-2\nseroprevalence estimates by identify-\ning significant demographic predictors\nof missing results through a weighted\nlogistic regression model and used the\nmodel to further adjust the weights.\nThe estimates using further adjusted\nweights changed slightly (changes in\npoint estimates ranging from -1.3% to\nHSV-2) but were within 95% CIs of\nseroprevalence estimates based on\nweights published by the National\nCenter for Health Statistics. Similar\nresults were found from investigations\ninto the missing HSV serological\nconvinced us to use weights from the\nNational Center for Health Statistics in\nour analyses.\nLogistic regression methods de-\nscribed by Korn and Barry35 were used\nto examine whether differences in so-\nciodemographic or sexual behavior be-\ntween the survey participants might ex-\nplain the observed changes in HSV-2\nable was forced into the model, and\nother variables were added in order of\nstatistical significance. The criteria for\ninclusion and remaining in the model\nwas based on the Satterthwaite-\nadjusted F-test P value of .10 or less.\nOnce all variables that met the criteria\nhad been included in the model, pair-\nwise interactions were evaluated. Sev-\neral significant interactions with sex led\nus to develop models separately for\nmales and females. Variables that met\nthe entry criteria in either model were\nincluded in the final models for both\nsexes. To facilitate interpretations, ad-\njusted seroprevalence was calculated\nfrom the sex-specific logistic regres-\nsion model using the PREDMARG\nstatement in SUDAAN. The adjusted se-\nroprevalence, also known as predic-\ntive margin, was generated using the lo-\ngistic regression model to estimate the\nprobability of being HSV-2 positive for\nevery individual, averaging over the dis-\ntribution of the covariates among the\nentire weighted sample.\nRESULTS\nSeroprevalence of HSV-2\nHSV-2 among participants aged 14 to\nwas higher among females than among\namong non-Hispanic whites, 40.3%\namong non-Hispanic blacks, and 11.9%\namong Mexican Americans.\nThe overall HSV-2 seroprevalence in-\ncreased rapidly with increasing age from\nyears.\nAs reported in previous NHANES,25\nHSV-2 seroprevalence also varied sig-\nnificantly by a number of demo-\ngraphicandbehavioralfactors(Table1).\nSeroprevalence of HSV-2 was higher\namong persons who were divorced,\nseparated, or widowed; those living\nbelow the poverty level; who had ever\nused cocaine; and who had sex for the\nSample Size\nHSV-2 Seroprevalence\nP\nValue*\nSex\nRace/ethnicity\nAge group, y\nMarital status\nPoverty index\nEducation\nEver used cocaine\nAge at first sex, y\u00a7\nLifetime No. of sex partners\nAbbreviations: CI, confidence interval; HSV-2, herpes simplex virus type 2; NHANES, National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey.\n*Calculated using 2 test.\nIncludes all participants who do not belong to the 3 main racial/ethnic groups, such as those whose race/ethnicity\nwas missing and persons who reported \"multiracial.\"\n\u00a7Defined as vaginal, oral, or anal.\nEstimates may be unreliable because the relative SE is large (SE/seroprevalence 30%).\nfirst time at the age of 17 years or\nyounger.

Recent research into\nthe structure of sexual networks indi-\ncates that in adolescents, relative low\nlevels of behavioral change can radi-\ncally limit the spread of sexually trans-\nmitted infections.42 The finding that the\nmean number of lifetime sex partners\nincreased in adult females but did not\nchange in adult males may have con-\ntributed to the greater decreases in\nHSV-2 seroprevalence in males rela-\ntive to females between the 2 surveys.\nThe overall seroprevalence of HSV-1\nthere was an increase in persons in-\nfectedwithHSV-1onlywhohadbeendi-\nagnosed with genital herpes.

Further-\nmore, the gaps in HSV-2 seropreva-\nlence between the sexes are widening\nand the disparity between racial groups\npersists despite the recent decrease in\nHSV-2 seroprevalence.
