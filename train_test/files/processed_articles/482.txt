Prevalence of current and\nformer smoking, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension declined, whereas prevalence of obesity and dysglycemia increased\nthrough 2008. Physical activity levels and low diet quality scores changed minimally. Projections to 2020 suggest that obesity and\nimpaired fasting glucose/diabetes mellitus could increase to affect 43% and 77% of US men and 42% and 53% of US women,\nrespectively. Overall, population-level cardiovascular health is projected to improve by 6% overall by 2020 if current trends continue.\nconfidence interval, 7.6\u00ad9.9]) fall well below the level needed to achieve a 20% improvement (men9.4; women10.1).\nConclusions--The American Heart Association 2020 target of improving cardiovascular health by 20% by 2020 will not\nKey Words: cardiovascular disease risk factors  epidemiology  risk factors  trends\nThe American Heart Association (AHA) 2020 Strategic\nImpact Goals target a 20% relative improvement in\noverall cardiovascular health in all Americans with the use of\n4 health behavior (smoking, diet, physical activity, body\nweight) and 3 health factor (plasma glucose, cholesterol,\nblood pressure) metrics.1 The 2020 goals were conceptualized\non the basis of 3 key concepts of health promotion and\ndisease prevention: (1) effectiveness of primordial preven-\ntion; (2) life course nature of cardiovascular disease (CVD)\ndevelopment and CVD risk factors; and (3) balance between\npopulation- and individual-level prevention.1 A higher num-\nber of health behaviors and factors at ideal levels is associated\nwith substantially lower cardiovascular event rates in short-\nand long-term follow-up.1,2 However, given the very low\nprevalence of individuals with ideal cardiovascular health,3 a\n20% relative improvement would have a small absolute effect\non the population. Concurrent shifts from poor to intermedi-\nate levels of health behaviors and factors will also be needed\nto realize substantial improvements across the spectrum of\ncardiovascular health. The 20% target was deemed aggressive\nyet achievable by consensus.1\nCurrent trends of these composite cardiovascular health metrics\nare unclear. Decreases in smoking4 and exposure to secondhand\nsmoke5 have slowed. Nationally representative data continue to\nsuggest poor dietary quality for most of the population,6 but\nincreases in obesity prevalence may be slowing.7 Trends in physical\nactivity are mixed,4 but diabetes mellitus prevalence rates are\nrising.4 Total cholesterol levels are decreasing, in part because of a\ndoubling in the use of lipid-lowering drugs.8 Despite population-\nlevel increases in body weight, mean blood pressure and blood\npressure control are improving.9\nFrom the Department of Preventive Medicine, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL (M.D.H., H.N., C.M.S., D.M.L.-J.);\nDivision of Public Health, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom (S.C.); and Division of Adult and Community Health, National Center\nfor Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA (E.S.F.).\nThe online-only Data Supplement is available with this article at http://circ.ahajournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.\nCorrespondence to Donald M.

We calculated prevalence estimates from\ncardiovascular health behaviors and health factors, as defined by the\nStatistical Analyses\nAll analyses were performed with the use of SAS version 9.1 (SAS\nInstitute, Cary, NC) with the complex sampling design taken into\naccount. We used the standard 2000 US population to adjust the data\nin cardiovascular health factors and behaviors, we performed\nweighted linear regression using estimated mean values or percent-\nages as dependent variables and survey time as independent vari-\nables. We fitted weighted linear regression models with prevalence\nas the dependent variables and survey time as independent variables.\nThe  coefficients indicate the average annual change in the\nprevalence. On the basis of the findings, we projected the future\nsituation of year 2020 assuming that trends would continue to\nchange at a similar rate. We calculated prediction intervals on the\nbasis of SE of the predicted prevalence estimates. Reciprocals of\nvariances were used as weights. We projected estimates to 2020 by\nassuming that trends would continue in a manner similar to those\nobserved over the past 2 decades in a linear fashion. Because the\nmethodology used to measure diet and physical activity had changed\ndata. Likewise, because the methodology used to measure physical\nsensitivity analysis by including individuals with CVD, and the\noverall prevalence trends and 2020 projections were not substan-\ntively different (3% absolute difference in all 2020 projections\nincluding individuals with prevalent CVD).\nWe projected the situation for 2020 by assuming that trends would\ncontinue to change at a similar rate. We considered alternative statistical\nmethods such as linear models with a quadratic term for time to assess\nnonlinear trends, but the results differed little from standard linear models\nwith the sole exception of blood pressure trends in women. The majority of\nour final estimated models had coefficients of determination (R2) values of\n0.80 and better. Results from log-linear and logit models were nearly\nidentical to the results from linear models. In addition, the projected 2020\nestimates for blood pressure in women with a model with a quadratic term\nwere substantially lower than a realistic value. Thus, we chose to use the\nlinear models for simplicity. Estimates with a coefficient of variation 30%\nwere considered unreliable.11 Data are presented as mean and 95%\nconfidence interval (CI). A P value 0.05 defined statistical significance.\nWe compared these estimates based on current trends with a 20%\nbecause the AHA used 2006 as a reference point. A 20% improve-\nment in cardiovascular health was defined as the average of a 20%\nrelative decrease in the prevalence of poor cardiovascular health\nmetrics and a 20% relative increase in the prevalence of ideal\ncardiovascular health across the 7 metrics. This method minimizes\nthe likelihood of demonstrating an improvement in cardiovascular\nhealth that is driven solely by a reduction in poor health, which could\nbe due to higher death rates in that group. Categories of ideal,\nintermediate, and poor levels of each metric are exclusive from each\nother. Thus, the prevalence estimates across different categories of\neach item (poor smoking, intermediate smoking, and ideal smoking,\nTable 1.

Furthermore,\nwe project no changes in the mean individual Cardiovascular\nHealth Score for both men and women. In addition to worsening\ncardiovascular health metrics, current trends will likely lead to\nstagnating age-adjusted fatal and nonfatal CVD event rates in the\ncontext of rising healthcare costs on the basis of unfavorable\ncoronary heart disease mortality trends among Americans aged\n35 to 54 years.12 The AHA has recently estimated that between\ncoronary heart disease, heart failure, stroke, and all other CVD)\nwill increase from $273 billion to $818 billion, and indirect costs\nwill rise from $172 billion to $276 billion, unless substantial\nchanges to prevent and control CVD are adopted.13\nThe optimal combination of primordial,14 primary, and second-\nary prevention approaches--realized through a mixture of medical\nand public health/policy interventions--will be critical for any\nhigh-functioning health system to reduce the prevalence of poor\ncardiovascular health metrics. The goals of this approach are to (1)\nprovide high-quality, equitable management of individuals with risk\nfactors and disease and (2) shift individuals from intermediate to\nideal levels or, optimally, to maintain ideal health cardiovascular\nmetrics throughout the lifespan. This has been shown to lead to\ngreater longevity and health,15 compression of morbidity,16 dramat-\nically low lifetime risks for CVD (which account for competing\nrisks),17 and remarkably lower healthcare utilization and costs\n(annual, lifetime, and last year of life).18 Given these compelling\nfindings, the improvement in cardiovascular health through quanti-\nfiable metrics has received increasing attention, including being part\nPotential Targets for Intervention\nThese results reinforce the central importance of comprehen-\nsive tobacco control policies as well as the prevention and\nmanagement of obesity through diet, exercise, and judicious\nuse of therapies for weight loss to improve cardiovascular\nhealth in adults. Although declines in tobacco consumption are\nencouraging, tobacco remains the leading cause of preventable\ndeath and disability, including a substantial burden of non-CVD\nsuch as lung cancer and chronic lung disease. The downstream\nimpact of obesity on other cardiovascular health metrics such as\ndysglycemia, blood pressure, and possibly cholesterol suggests\nFigure 1.

These include the following: (1) public smok-\ning bans, (2) tobacco advertising restrictions, (3) increased\ntobacco excise taxes (especially relevant at the state level\ngiven the wide variation across the United States20), (4)\nreduced salt in the food supply, (5) replacement of trans fats\nwith polyunsaturated fats, and (6) mass media campaigns to\npromote healthy diets and physical activity.21 In concert with\npolicy changes, more rigorous improvements in individual\nlifestyle behaviors and factors and medical treatment and\ncontrol (including combination therapy for high-risk individ-\nuals) are needed to help shift individuals from poor to\nintermediate to ideal cardiovascular health.19\nStrengths/Limitations\nThe strengths of our results include its large, nationally\nrepresentative sample size and 20-year measurement period.\nHowever, our study has limitations. First, measures of diet\nand physical activity are prone to sampling variability, as\nnoted by the wide CIs for these estimates, and misclassifica-\ntion due to self-reporting. In addition, we relied on fewer\nNHANES cycles for trend tests and 2020 projections for diet\nand physical activity. Our estimates for diet and physical\nactivity may be unstable and should be interpreted cautiously.\nSecond, future trends may not be linear, as we have assumed.\nFor example, recent obesity increases may be plateauing;\nconversely, recent cholesterol and blood pressure declines\nmay also be plateauing, which may contribute to the flatten-\ning coronary heart disease mortality rates in young men and\nwomen in the United States, United Kingdom, and else-\nwhere.12,22 Finally, we created a simple composite Cardio-\nvascular Health Score to examine individual-level cardiovas-\ncular health. This score weighs the presence of all\nintermediate or poor levels of the 7 metrics equally. Prior\nstudies indicate that some adverse health factors, such as\ncurrent smoking or diabetes mellitus, may be associated with\ngreater relative risks for cardiovascular events than other\nfactors. However, the present score is not intended as a\nmeasure to estimate risk; rather, it serves as a means for\nmonitoring the distribution (poor, intermediate, or ideal) of\nall 7 metrics at the individual level across the population.\nFurthermore, Folsom et al2 recently demonstrated that there\nwere roughly equal stepwise decreases in hazards for cardio-\nvascular events for each additional single health behavior or\nhealth factor present at ideal levels.\nConclusions\nIf current trends continue, overall cardiovascular health is\nThis projection reflects modest, further declines in tobacco\nconsumption, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure,\noffset by increases in obesity and dysglycemia.

Rapid mortality falls after risk-factor changes\nThe American Heart Association's Strategic Planning Task Force set forth the goal of improving the cardiovascular health of all\nAmericans by 20% by 2020. To assess progress toward this goal, 7 health metrics were defined: smoking, diet, physical activity,\nbody weight, blood glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol. In this investigation, we asked, \"If current trends in these metrics\ncontinue, will this goal be reached?\" We evaluated past trends by using data from the 1998\u00ad2008 National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES) examination cycles and created best-fit linear regression models and linear forward projections\nto 2020. We also created an individual-level Cardiovascular Health Score to evaluate individual-level changes in cardiovascular\nhealth amid larger population trends. Our results suggest that if current trends continue, changes in the individual-level\nCardiovascular Health Score will be minimal and that the overall cardiovascular health of the US population will improve by only\n6% by 2020; this progress is far short of the American Heart Association's target of 20% improvement. This projection reflects\nmodest further declines in tobacco use and improved control of high cholesterol and high blood pressure that are offset by\nincreases in obesity and dysglycemia prevalence. In conclusion, continued individual-level primary and secondary preventive\nmeasures should be complemented by an increased national commitment to policies promoting prevention of the development\nof abnormal risk factor levels from childhood onward. If the American Heart Association target of 20% improvement in overall\ncardiovascular health were achieved, the potential reductions in cardiovascular disease burden could be substantial, rapid, and\nassociated with substantial cost savings.\nhttp://circ.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\nDonald M.

Interviewees were provided a set of measuring guides to assist their recall. Leisure-time physical\nactivity was queried from 1999-2006 using the following questions, \"Over the past 30 days, what moderate activity\nor activities did you do?\" and \"Over the past 30 days, how often did you perform (that activity)?\" Similar questions\nwere asked regarding vigorous activities. Activities were coded to estimate metabolic equivalents (METs) for\nmoderate and vigorous activities.\nHealth Factors\nHeight and weight were measured in a MEC examination with standardized equipment and techniques.\nBody mass index was calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by height in meters squared. Diabetes was defined\nby fasting blood glucose > 126 mg/dl or affirmative response to one or more of the following questions: \"Have you\never been told by a doctor that you have diabetes? Are you now taking insulin? Are you now taking diabetes pills\nto lower your blood sugar?\" Total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides were measured in participants\nfasting >8 hours. LDL cholesterol was measured using the Friedewald equation if triglycerides were <400 mg/dl\n(LDL cholesterol = total cholesterol \u00ad HDL cholesterol \u00ad triglycerides/5). Medical treatment of high cholesterol was\nqueried by asking, \"To lower your blood cholesterol, have you ever been told by a doctor or other health\nprofessional to take prescribed medicine?\" followed by \"Are you now following this advice to take prescribed\nmedicine?\" Blood pressure was measured by trained personnel using a mercury sphygmomanometer and an\ninflatable cuff at the level of the heart, after the participant rested for 5 minutes in a seated position with both feet on\nthe floor. Three blood pressure measurements were recorded and the mean of the last two recordings was used; if\nfewer than three measurements were performed, the second (if two) or first (if one) recording was used. Medical\ntreatment of elevated blood pressure was queried by asking, \"Because of your hypertension/high blood pressure,\nhave you ever been told to take a prescribed medicine?\" followed by, \"Are you now taking a prescribed medicine?\"\nSupplemental Figures.\nSupplemental Figure 1.
