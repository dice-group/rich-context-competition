Broome, PhD\nBackground: Long-term (5-year) outcomes of\ncommunity treatment for cocaine dependence were ex-\namined in relation to problem severity at treatment\nentry and treatment exposure throughout the follow-up\nperiod.\nMethods: Interviews were conducted at 1 and 5 years\ncities) who met DSM-III-R criteria for cocaine depen-\nmary outcome measures included cocaine use and ar-\nrests. Self-reported cocaine use showed high overall\nagreement with urine (79% agreement) and hair (80%\nagreement) toxicology analyses.\nResults: Weekly cocaine use was reported by 25% of the\nsample at 5 years, slightly higher than the 21% at 1 year.\nSimilarly, 26% had cocaine detected in urine specimens at\nfollow-up and 18% reported having been arrested. Poorer\nlong-term outcomes were related to higher problem sever-\nity at treatment admission and low treatment exposure.\nConclusions: Thelargedecreasesincocaineuse1yearaf-\nter treatment discharge were sustained during the 5-year\nfollow-up. Severity of drug and psychosocial problems at\nintakewaspredictiveoflong-termoutcomesandoutcomes\nimprovedindirectrelationtoleveloftreatmentexposure.\nthe Office of National Drug\nControl Policy (Washing-\nton, DC)1 notes that the\nhigh level of past-month co-\ncaine use in the United States remained\nstable during the 1990s, but the number of\nnew users rose by 37% during this period.\nCocaine is the illegal drug mentioned most\noften in emergency department overdose\nadmissionrecords--roughlyequaltoheroin\nand marijuana combined--and is de-\ntected consistently in the urine specimens\nfrommorethanonethirdofarresteestested\nin this country each year. Behavioral thera-\npies have proven to be effective treat-\nments for cocaine addiction, particularly\nthose using a manual-guided combina-\ntion of intensive individual plus group drug\ncounseling.2 At the individual patient level,\noutcomes are associated with the severity\nof drug and related problems, type of treat-\nment setting, and length of stay.3-9\nRecent findings from the third na-\ntional evaluation of treatment effective-\nness, funded by the National Institute on\nDrug Abuse (NIDA) (Bethesda, Md), show\nthat patients who are cocaine dependent\nand have high problem severity index (PSI)\nscores, based on background informa-\ntion obtained at treatment intake, have sig-\nnificantly better 1-year outcomes if treated\nfor a minimum of 90 days in long-term\nresidential (LTR) (usually intensive thera-\npeutic community) programs.9 Similar\nfindings apply to adolescents studied as\npart of this same project.10 Patients with\nmoderate levels of problem severity can be\ntreated with comparable effectiveness in\neither LTR or outpatient drug-free (ODF)\ntreatment if they stay for a minimum of\n90 days. Treatment setting and duration\nare less important for patients with low\nproblem severity, for whom less expen-\nsive and shorter-term outpatient services\nseem to be the most cost-effective choice.\nComparable results have been reported for\npatients who are addicted to opiates and\ntreated in methadone programs.11\nBecause the widespread use of co-\ncaine began in the 1980s and it has taken\nyears to develop appropriate interven-\ntions and demonstrate their effectiveness,\nlong-term treatment follow-up studies of\ncocaine-dependent patients have been rare.\nThe NIDA-funded Drug Abuse Treatment\nOutcome Studies (DATOS) therefore in-\ncluded 5-year follow-up interviews as part\nof its original scope of work. Our study\nbuilds on a large body of treatment pro-\ncess and outcome research already com-\ntreatment outcome study of the patients\ndescribed above9 to a 5-year follow-up\nFrom the Institute of Behavioral\nResearch, Texas Christian\nUniversity, Fort Worth.\n\u00a92002 American Medical Association.

The previous findings that drug use and criminal-\nity outcomes at 1 year after treatment discharge are re-\nlated to problem severity at intake (represented by a com-\npositeofdruguse,criminalinvolvement,socialfunctioning,\nSUBJECTS\nThe original DATOS treatment population included a total\nto 96 drug treatment programs in 11 cities located through-\nout the United States.14 Our study is limited to the subgroup\nof 1648 patients with cocaine dependence included in a study\nof outcomes in the first year after treatment.9 In selecting the\nsample for 5-year follow-up interviews, 419 patients from 3\ncities were excluded owing to small samples at 1 year (caus-\ning excessive costs per case for fieldwork), 163 were with-\nout locator information (which was lost owing to a change\nin the organization selected to conduct field interviews), 30\nhad moved away from the region in which they had origi-\nnally received treatment, and 26 were institutionalized in a\nsetting where interview access was denied. These exclu-\nsented 73% of the eligible, living patients.\nAt treatment admission (Table 1), the mean (SD) age\nand African Americans composed 56%. Nearly three fourths\nhad a high school education or general educational devel-\nopment test score equivalent and nearly half had never been\nmarried. Also, almost half (46%) entered treatment with a\nlegal status (usually probation). In addition to cocaine use,\nmany were also dependent on alcohol (51%) or diagnosed\nas having psychiatric impairment (48%).\nEach patient participated in a 2-part treatment intake inter-\nview, with sessions occurring approximately 1 week apart.\nIntake 1 addressed sociodemographic background, educa-\ntion, alcohol and drug use history, illegal involvement, and\nemployment. In intake 2, assessment modules based on stan-\ndard clinical instruments, such as the Diagnostic Interview\nSchedule,16 Composite International Diagnostic Inter-\nan abbreviated set of treatment motivation scales were also\nused.19 Interviews required an average of 90 minutes to com-\nplete and were administered by research staff under the tech-\nnical supervision of project field staff. Subjects were paid $10\nfor each intake interview.\nThe 5-year follow-up interviews were conducted by\nthe National Opinion Research Center of the University of\nChicago (Chicago, Ill) under contract with the DATOS Co-\nordinating Center. Trained professional interviewers re-\ncontacted patients approximately 5 years after they had left\ntheir index treatment episode. Interviews averaged 2 hours\nto complete and patients were compensated $15 for their\ntime. Interview content focused primarily on drug use and\nother behaviors during the follow-up interval, with par-\nticular emphasis on the year immediately preceding the\n5-year interview. Each interviewee was asked to provide a\nurine and hair specimen for drug testing. Compensation\nof $10 was provided for those biological samples.\nQuestionnaires completed by the program director and\ncounseling supervisor served to describe the organiza-\ntional structure, treatment protocol, policies, and staff at\nparticipating DATOS facilities.20 Long-term residential\ntreatments were 24-hour residential facilities. They\nincluded traditional therapeutic communities that oper-\nated with a highly structured emphasis on social confron-\ntation combined with isolation from the outside commu-\nnity (expected stays were for at least 6 months) and\nmodified therapeutic communities that had less program-\nmatic structure and shorter duration (4-6 months).21 Out-\npatient drug-free programs varied more widely in their\ntherapeutic orientation and intensity levels. Individual\nand group supportive counseling was emphasized, along\nwith brief reality therapy and practical problem solving;\nsome provided individual psychotherapy, 12-step meet-\nings, and cognitive-behavioral therapy. Planned length of\nstay was usually 6 months or longer (range, 3-12\nmonths). Short-term inpatient (STI) treatments were\nbased primarily on the 12-step model and provided inten-\nsive 24-hour exposure to the therapeutic milieu as an\ninstrument of change. Supportive group counseling was\nused as well as lectures, work assignments, family coun-\nseling, and daily reading groups focusing on 12-step prin-\nciples. The traditional 28-day inpatient duration for this\nmodality was shortened in most programs during this\nstudy (owing to managed care and cost containment pres-\nsures), averaging 25 days but ranging from 4 to 55 days.\nAdditional treatments received during the 5-year fol-\nlow-up were recorded in the follow-up interview, includ-\ning type of program and total length of stay; 275 (39%) of\n708 respondents had returned for 1 or more treatments,\nusually LTR or ODF. Their combined length of stay in these\ntreatments averaged 36 weeks, exceeding the 90-day treat-\nment threshold.\nMEASURES\nThe PSI9 was defined using variables from the 2-part intake\ninterview that represented functional domains commonly re-\nlated to treatment goals and outcome, similar to the do-\nmains assessed in the Addiction Severity Index.22 The PSI is\na summed score of 7 problem areas at treatment intake, de-\nfined as follows:\n1. Multiple drug use: self-reported use of any 3 or more\ndrug categories in the year before intake.\n2. Alcohol dependence: either a DSM-III-R diagnosis of\nalcoholdependenceorself-reporteddailyconsumptionfor1\nmonth or longer during the year before intake.\n3. Criminal activity: being on probation/parole, await-\ning trial, or having a case pending at intake, or being in-\nvolved in illegal activities during the past year.\n4. Unemployment: no work at a full-time job in the\nyear before intake.\n5. Low social support: having several family mem-\nbers or close friends who used illegal drugs or were incar-\ncerated in the past year.\nContinued on next page\n\u00a92002 American Medical Association.

No insurance: having no private insurance (reflect-\ning low socioeconomic resources).\nMeeting an adequate threshold for length of time in\ndrug treatment was indicated by spending 90 days or longer\nin LTR or ODF treatment, which was shown to be the av-\nerage length of stay after which therapeutic effects of treat-\nment began.23-26 The literature does not indicate threshold\neffects of STI, but for the purpose of this study, 21 days\nwas accepted as a representative minimum.9 Additional treat-\nment following DATOS was also taken into account since\nmore than 1 treatment episode is frequently needed dur-\ning recovery, and treatment can have cumulative ef-\nfects.27-29 Patients therefore were categorized as having (1)\nbelow-threshold treatment, defined as having spent fewer\nthan 90 days in LTR or ODF treatment during DATOS (or\nfewer than 21 days if in STI programs) and also having no\nother reported treatment during the follow-up interval; (2)\nabove-threshold treatment, defined as having spent at least\n90 days in LTR or ODF treatment during DATOS (or 21\ndays if in STI) or having returned to treatment during the\nfollow-up; and (3) current treatment at the time of the fol-\nlow-up interview.\nSix subgroups of patients were identified, based on PSI\nscores at intake and level of treatment exposure, and used to\ntestcombinedrelationshipsofthesevariableswith5-yearout-\ncomes. Patients assigned to the first group (low PSI scores,\nabove-threshold treatment) had PSI scores below 4 and met\nthe treatment threshold during DATOS or in the follow-up\nperiod; the second group (low PSI scores with below-\nthreshold treatment) had a PSI score of less than 4 but treat-\nment exposure was below threshold. Patients in the third\ngroup (moderate PSI scores, above-threshold treatment) had\nPSI scores of 4 or 5, while those in the fourth group (high\nPSI scores, above-threshold treatment) had PSI scores of 6\nor 7; both had met the treatment threshold during DATOS\norhadreturnedtotreatmentafterwards.Thefifthgroup,those\nwith moderate-high PSI scores with below-threshold treat-\nment, consisted of patients with PSI scores of 4 or higher and\nwho left DATOS before meeting the treatment threshold and\nhad no subsequent treatment. All patients in the current-\ntreatment group at the 5-year follow-up were placed to-\ngether in the sixth group, regardless of PSI score ( 60% had\n4 or more problems) or prior treatment experience.\nComparisons of background variables for these groups\nshowed that patients in the 2 groups with low PSI scores were\nolder, more likely to be married, to be high school graduates\n(or to have passed the general educational development test),\ntobeemployed,andtohaveasupportivesocialnetwork(Table\n1). In addition, they were less likely to be weekly users of al-\ncohol or illegal drugs or to have a legal status and psychiat-\nric problems before entering treatment in DATOS.\nCocaine use was the primary outcome measure used for the\nstudy,representedbyself-reportedweeklyuseaswellasurine\nfollow-up and sent to a central laboratory for assays on co-\ncaine and other drugs.

Overall differences among the groups, classified by\nPSI score and treatment exposure, were tested by logistic\nregression analysis. Within the logistic regressions,\nplanned contrasts were conducted to compare (1)\npatients with low PSI scores who had above-threshold\ntreatment vs those with below-threshold treatment expo-\nsure, (2) all patients with low PSI scores vs other patients\nwith below-threshold treatment, (3) patients with moder-\nate vs high PSI scores (all above the treatment threshold),\n(4) patients with moderate PSI scores with above-\nthreshold treatment vs patients with moderate-high PSI\nscores with below-threshold treatment, and (5) patients\nwith high PSI scores with above-threshold treatment vs\npatients with moderate-high PSI scores with below-\nthreshold treatment.

Thus, long or intensive treatment was not re-\nquired (or cost-effective). In contrast, patients who were\nin treatment at follow-up had the worst outcomes (except\nonurinetestspositiveforcocainemetabolites,whichshowed\nmore limited recent use of cocaine). These patients typi-\ncallyhadgreaterbackgroundproblemsandlefttheirDATOS\ntreatment before reaching threshold tenure.\nThe remaining 3 groups of patients with moderate-\nto high-level problems when admitted to treatment in\nDATOS served to test hypotheses concerning the rela-\ntionship of outcomes with adequate treatment exposure\nfor individuals with more severe backgrounds. Patients\nwhose treatment exposure never reached therapeutic\nthresholds had significantly higher cocaine relapse rates\n(ie, 46% had cocaine metabolites in their urine and 57%\nin their hair--each about 20% higher than for the 2 groups\nwith above-threshold treatment; Table 3). The group of\npatients with high PSI scores and above-threshold treat-\nment showed remarkable improvements on all outcome\nmeasures over time. For instance, their rate of pretreat-\nment weekly heroin use dropped 20% at follow-up (from\nThese improvements were statistically significant and the\nmagnitude of their ORs (which were in the 2.0 range)\nsuggests that they are clinically meaningful as well.\nThesefindingsreiteratetheimportanceofcompliance\nwithtreatment.Althoughourearlierstudyfoundthatasub-\nstantialpercentage(30%)ofthissampledroppedoutoftheir\nDATOStreatmentpriortothecriticalretentionthreshold,\nthe rate is comparable with medical disorders such as dia-\nbetes, hypertension, and asthma.34 Additionally, high re-\nlapseratescommontoallofthesedisordersaredirectlyas-\nsociatedwithpoortreatmentengagement.Althoughthere\nareotherinfluencesinvolvinggeneticandpsychosocialfac-\ntors, treatment engagement is more easily addressed.\nDrugtestingofurineandhairsampleshelpedaddress\nthe question commonly raised about the overall credibil-\nityoffollow-upinterviewresults.Ofthosewhodeniedus-\ning\"any\"cocaineatfollow-up,wefoundthatonly5%had\nbiologicalevidencetothecontrary(and93%ofthepatients\nwhohadcocaineintheirurinealsohadcocaineintheirhair).\nAlthoughbiologicalspecimenswerenotcollectedfromall\ninterviewees(and21%ofthetargetedfollow-upsamplecould\nnotbelocatedforthestudy),theresponseratesandevidence\nforcredibilityoffindingscomparefavorablywithotherlarge-\nscale drug treatment outcome studies.2\nUndertheconditionsofanaturalisticdesign,patients\nin this study were free to choose their own course of treat-\nmentinvolvement.Whilesuchdesignslimitinterpretations\nabouttreatmentefficacy,theyallowforstudyingthedynamic\ncourseoftreatmentstagesandoutcomesinthe\"realworld.\"\nClinical studies have provided evidence for the efficacy of\nseveralbehavioralinterventionsforcocainedependence,3\nbutnaturalisticevaluationsoftreatmentexperienceandre-\ncovery show how patient background, treatment engage-\nment, and outcomes are related.
