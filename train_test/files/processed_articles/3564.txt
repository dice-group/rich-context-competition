    "abstract": "Abstract\nSeveral golf swing movements have been correlated with the production of club speed in skilled golfers. However, less\nskilled golfers, such as senior golfers, may not be capable of many of those movements. One golf swing--Minimalist Golf\nSwing--reduces the downswing range of motion through which a golfer's body must move to reach the impact positions\nseen in skilled golfers. The purpose of this study was to assess whether the MGS could improve senior golfers' ball flight\nand consistency, and increase their motivation to play golf. Twenty-two seniors (16 males, 6 females), aged 54\u00ad81,\nparticipated in an 11-session study comprising pretest, intervention, and posttest sessions. During the test sessions,\nparticipants hit 20 shots with each of their own 6-iron and driver clubs. Ball movement immediately after impact was\nmeasured using a camera-based ball launch monitor. Participants' motivation to play golf before and after the intervention\nwas assessed using the Sports Motivation Scale II. A mixed effects model was used for the statistical analysis of this\nrepeated measures study, in which participants served as their own controls. Statistically significant per-session results\nwere an increase in the ball's speed (6-iron and driver) and trajectory (6-iron), and a change in direction (both clubs)\nfrom left to slightly right (for right handed golfers). Consistency of ball flight, total motivation and intrinsic motivation\nincreased slightly post-intervention, while amotivation decreased, none significantly. Therefore, some senior golfers can\nimprove ball flight, consistency, and motivation to play golf after six MGS training sessions.\n",

Club speed, and\nthe movements generating it, moreover, is what most\ngolf swing researchers have typically focused on, while\nresearch has ignored the movements that might gener-\nate better direction. In addition, there is little research\nto indicate how less-skilled golfers might achieve the\ndownswing movements which are associated with\ngreater club speed in skilled golfers.\nSkilled golfers have been observed to be able to\nmove through a considerable range of vertical, lateral\nand rotational movement during the downswing to\nreach the impact positions which are said to translate\nto greater club speed. Less skilled golfers, however, do\nnot have the strength and speed to move through the\nsame range of motion, which is not surprising as the\nall golfers, regardless of skill level.\nVertical acceleration is achieved by an upward move-\nment of the hub during the downswing. It was shown4\nto be significantly higher ( p < .01) in elite golfers\nthat contributes to greater club speed is termed ``weight\nshift''. In a comparison of skilled versus nonskilled\nReviewer: Jeff Broker (University of Colorado, Colorado Springs, USA)\nTexas Woman's University, Denton, TX, USA\nCorresponding author:\nKiran Kanwar, c/o Mark Mann, Ph.D. Department of Kinesiology, Texas\nEmail: kkanwar@twu.edu\nInternational Journal of Sports Science\n& Coaching\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav\njournals.sagepub.com/home/spo\ngolfers, it was seen that the former shifted weight (from\nthe trail foot, i.e. right foot for a right-handed golfer) by\n12.3 \u00c6 3.7cm towards the lead foot (left foot for a right-\nhanded golfer) during the downswing, while the latter\nshowed less, and delayed, weight-shift.1 Finally, rota-\ntional acceleration takes place in a proximal-to-distal\nsequence, much like a stack of discs that rotate about\nthe same axis, with the larger disc below imparting its\nenergy to the smaller one above it, in keeping with a\nsummation-of-speed principle.5 During the downswing,\nprofessional golfers had a significantly higher ( p < .011)\naverage pelvic rotational acceleration of 2.1 kd/s2 \u00c6 0.4\ncompared to amateurs' 1.5 kd/s2 \u00c6 0.4, and a significantly\nhigher ( p< .011) average thorax rotational acceleration\nOne solution for less skilled golfers to reach some of\nthe impact positions seen in their more skilled counter-\nparts might be to reduce the vertical and lateral range of\nmotion through which they have to move during the short\ntime frame of the downswing, as both involve a move-\nment of the body's center of mass through some distance.\nThese movements could be replaced by an increased\nrotary range of motion about a longitudinal axis.\nOne golf swing--the Minimalist Golf Swing\n(MGS)--requires a golfer to maintain the lead shoulder\nhigher, and the body's weight closer to target, than typ-\nically seen, from set-up to the top of the backswing. It\nthus requires less vertical and lateral body-movement\nduring the downswing, to help a golfer get into suitable\nimpact positions within the short time frame of the\ndownswing. At the same time, it is designed to increase\nrotational range of motion, and thus acceleration,\nthrough a pre-swing rotation of the torso, which is pos-\nitioned to face away from target. The MGS has been\nshown, in a previous study, to produce greater club-\nhead speed for a mixed age-group of golfers over a\nsingle-session swing change.6\nA population for whom there may be benefits to the\nuse of the MGS, based on its purported advantages,\nmight be senior golfers (aged 50 years and above),\nbecause aging is associated with diminished perform-\nance due to a reduction in muscle-strength, speed,\nflexibility and range of motion.7 Senior golfers, there-\nfore, are unable to move through the large range of\nmotion that elite golfers do, as their motor performance\nbecomes slower and less consistent with age,7 which\nloss of speed reduces their ability to hit the golf ball\nlong distances with the full-swing.8 Moreover, while\nconcentric and isometric strength reduce with age, it\nis known that eccentric muscle performance is retained\nto a greater extent,9 and this is a concept the MGS\ncapitalizes on through its greater range of torso rota-\ntion, in the expectation of club speed gains.\nThe loss of ball-distance and trajectory (which\ntogether with direction constitute ball flight) are\nimportant factors for performance.10 An attenuation of\nperformance might cause senior golfers to be less likely\nto be attracted to, and retained by, golf. This might\noccur because humans have a need for feelings of com-\npetence and autonomy,11 and are known to engage in\ntasks ``. . .in which they feel competent and confident and\navoid those in which they do not''.12 If the MGS is able\nto improve ball flight for senior golfers, it might also\nincrease their motivation to play golf.\nThe purpose of this study, therefore, was to assess\nwhether the MGS intervention could, for a mixed\ngroup of senior golfers, improve actual ball striking\n(ball speed, trajectory and direction), consistency of ball\nstriking, as well as the motivation to play golf, while using\ntwo different golf clubs which have considerably different\nperformance characteristics. It was hypothesized that\nball-striking would improve with respect to ball speed\nand trajectory, while direction would change from start-\ning randomly left or right, to starting either straight or\nslightly towards the right (for the right-handed golfer).\nIt was also hypothesized that ball-striking consistency\n(as assessed by the standard deviation of each outcome),\nwould be improved. Finally, it was hypothesized that\noverall motivation and intrinsic motivation would\nincrease, while amotivation would decrease.\nMethods\nParticipants\nTwenty-two male and female golfers over the age of 50\nyears were recruited for this study. A G*Power 3 post\nhoc power analysis13 for this single-group, repeated\nmeasures study of 22 participants and three dependent\nvariables, with a significance level of a \u00bc .05, and a\nCohen's d effect size of 0.7, resulted in a power of\n0.8. Convenience as well as snowball sampling tech-\nniques were used, and golfers were recruited from the\nDallas-Ft. Worth Metroplex area. All participants\nsigned an informed consent form approved by Texas\nWoman's University's Institutional Review Board,\nprior to the commencement of the study. Inclusion cri-\nterion was age above 50 years. Exclusion was based on\na history of musculoskeletal injury or surgery which\nmight prevent them from making a full-swing range\nof motion repeatedly, for one hour.\nExperimental procedure\nParticipants attended 11 one-hour sessions and hit\nCallaway Big Bertha brand golf balls off a mat, into a\nnet in an indoor location. Participants used their own\n6-iron and driver clubs, and chose one of two tee\nheights for the driver shots. They were asked to wear\nwhatever apparel, shoes and glove they typically wear\n608 International Journal of Sports Science & Coaching 13(4)\nwhile playing golf. Prior to each of the 11 sessions, par-\nticipants warmed up in their usual fashion--either by\nhitting some shots or through some stretching exercises,\nor both. Session 1 was the baseline, pretest session,\nand was used to measure the ball-striking capabilities\nof participants' existing swings. During this session,\nparticipants hit 20 balls with each of their 6-iron and\ndriver clubs. This large number of shots was chosen\nas it was expected to adequately represent a baseline\nsions, intended to study changes at different time points\nafter the commencement of the intervention. During\nthese sessions, too, participants hit 20 balls per club.\nThe remaining six sessions were training sessions for\nthe interventional golf swing (MGS).\nThe 18-question revised Sports Motivation Scale II\n(SMS II) was administered before commencement of\nsession 1 and upon completion of session 11, to assess\nchanges in motivation. It has been assessed to be a valid\nand reliable measurement tool, and all subscales have a\nCronbach's a ! .70. SMS II assesses six sub-scales of\nmotivation--intrinsic, integrated, identified, intro-\njected, external and amotivated. Motivation is ``intrin-\nsic'' when it is self-driven, is ``integrated'' when a\nperson feels it is the essence of who they are, is ``iden-\ntified'' when an activity is self-chosen, is ``introjected''\nbecause it self-reflects a person's worth, and is ``exter-\nnal'' when it involves others' opinions. The SMS II\ngenerates an overall score of motivation, the Relative\nAutonomy Index (RAI) score, which indicates the\nautonomy level of a person's motivation.11\nInstructions for interventional swing technique\nStandardized instructions that were given to all participants.\n. Set-up: Posture as upright as possible, using minimal\nhip and knee flexion. Rotate the torso to face away\nfrom target. Tilt the head towards the trail shoulder.\n. Backswing: While maintaining the trail-side lateral\nflexion of the set-up, and keeping the lead arm close\nto the chest, lift it as high as it is able to go (no\nrestriction to arms' backswing length). Avoid any\nside-to-side, up-and-down or rotary movements of\nthe torso during the backswing.\n. Downswing: Continue to maintain the head's trail-\nside lateral flexion. No other swing thoughts are\nrequired (Figures 1 and 2).\nExplanations that were made to all participants.\n. No golfer gets into precisely the recommended\npositions, but any change made, to whatever extent\npossible, will show ball-striking improvement.\n. The ``magic move'' of the MGS is maintaining the\ntrail side's (especially the head's) lateral flexion\nthroughout the backswing.\n\u00ad It makes returning the club to the ball on the\nground each time more likely, as the body has\nnot moved up and down or side-to-side during\nthe backswing.\n\u00ad It positions the trail arm in ``external rotation'',\nwhich makes it more likely that the club will\narrive at the ball from the ``inside'' rather than\n``over the top'', for better directional control.\n\u00ad It automatically cuts off any over-long\nbackswing.\n. No downswing thought is required, except to main-\ntain the head's tilted position. The MGS backswing\nsets up important joints like a row of dominoes--the\nmovement of one piece triggers the sequential move-\nment of the rest.\nData collection\nThe equipment used for data collection was a Foresight\nSports GC2 golf ball launch monitor. It is a high-reso-\nlution, camera-based system which uses stereoscopic\nlenses for spatial recognition and has a data-capture\nThe system has an internal accelerometer which\ncorrects for non-level surfaces. It has a reported accur-\nacy tolerance of \u00c60.5 mph (0.22 m/s) for ball speed,\n\u00c60.2 for vertical launch angle (trajectory), and \u00c61.0\nfor azimuth (direction), according to the user-manual\nof the product.14 Calibration was performed prior to\neach session by placing the launch monitor perpendicu-\nlar to the target line, using a golf-specific alignment\nstick. The three dependent variables measured using\nthis device were ball speed, trajectory and direction\n(left or right of target) at the start of the ball's flight,\nimmediately after impact with the club.\nData analysis\nThis study had a pretest\u00adposttest repeated measures\ndesign, in which participants served as their own con-\ntrols. The independent variable was the golf swing pre-\nand post-intervention, and the dependent variables\nwere three important indicators of ball flight--ball\nspeed, trajectory and direction, measured at club-ball\nimpact. In a similar golf study, measurements had been\nnested within participants and multilevel analysis\nused.15 Thus, a mixed effects model, also known as a\nmultilevel model, was used in this study, and the three\ndependent variables of ball speed, trajectory and direc-\ntion (level 1) were nested within the individual golfer\n(level 2). The main predictor (independent) variable in\nthe model was the session number, which served to\nindicate ball flight changes from the use of existing\nswings (pretest) and then interventional swings\n(posttest), over the duration of the study. Other fixed-\neffect predictors used were the gender of the participant\n(male, with female as baseline), age, years playing golf\nand pre-intervention motivation. Skill level was not\nused as a predictor in this model because most senior\nparticipants did not keep a record of their scores while\nplaying golf. The random effect of the model was the\nindividual golfer. The multi-level (mixed effects) model\nwas developed by starting with a basic fixed-effects only\nversion.16 After testing for significance of the fixed\neffects, the random effect of individual participants\nwas incorporated into the model.\nWhile ball flight is an important consideration for a\ngolfer, so too is consistency of ball contact. This was\nassessed from the standard deviation, and was calcu-\nlated separately for each aspect of ball flight. Finally,\npre- and post-intervention motivation--total, intrinsic\nand amotivation--were compared using a paired sam-\nples t-test. A significance level of a \u00bc .05 was set for all\ntests, and SPSS 24.0 was used for all statistical analyses.\nResults\nDescriptive statistics\nA total of 22 senior golfers, 16 males and 6 females,\nparticipated in the study. Ages ranged from 54\u00ad81\nby age groups, there were three participants in the\nage groups, and one in the 80\u00ad89 age group.\nParticipants' experience with respect to number of\nyears playing golf ranged from 1 year to 61 years,\ncaps between \u00c07 and \u00c017, while the rest did not\ntypically keep score. Although not recorded, most\nsaid they played golf frequently. No shots that were\nrecorded by the launch monitor were discarded, regard-\nless of the quality of ball-flight, in order to assess real-\nistic levels of central tendency and variability achieved\nby the intervention. Overall pre-intervention total\nmotivation measured using the SMS II scale, was\n108. Means and standard deviations for the 6-iron and\ndriver clubs, assessed during the five measurement ses-\nsions, for all participants, female participants only, and\nmale participants only, are reported in Tables 1 to 3,\nrespectively.\nMean baseline measurements of ball speed, launch\nangle, and direction with all participants' original pre-\ntest swings (Table 1, session 1) for 6-iron and driver\n\u00c02.8 (SD \u00bc 6.4) respectively.

There was no\nsignificant change in driver trajectory. All of the\nabove results were obtained while controlling for\ngender (male), age, pre-intervention motivation and\nyears playing golf. All the fixed factors--session,\ngender, age, pre-intervention motivation and number\nof years playing golf--that produced significant effects\non the three aspects of ball flight are listed in Table 4.\nFinally, effect size has not been reported because no\nconsensus exists17 on an appropriate calculation of it\nfor a mixed effects model.

His study found that such golfers also\nhad very low trajectory, which together resulted in very\nsmall total distance.\nDiscussion of descriptive statistics\nOutcome measures for ball speed, trajectory and direction\nfor all sessions and both clubs are reported in Tables 1\n(all participants), 2 (females only) and 3 (males only).\nHowever, this descriptive statistics' discussion section\ncompares results from the pretest and the penultimate\nposttest sessions, as it was expected that participants'\nanxiety during the final session, from ``trying too hard'',\nwould negatively affect their performance during that\nsession. It is known that skill acquisition is a gradual\nprocess, affected by anxiety and fatigue.18\nBall speed and trajectory\nIn the present study, ball speed (Table 1) increased by\nan average of 0.8 m/s (1.8 mph) for the 6-iron and by\n0.6 (1.3 mph) for the driver, when comparing results for\nall participants from the pretest and the penultimate\nposttest session. Ball trajectory increased by an average\nof 1.5 for the 6-iron and decreased by 0.1 for the\ndriver during the same two sessions. For male golfers,\naverage 6-iron ball speed increased by 0.2 m/s and\ndriver speed by 0.3m/s. Their average 6-iron ball trajec-\ntory increased by 0.4 and driver ball trajectory by 0.3.\nNone of these changes was statistically significant. For\nfemale golfers, average 6-iron ball speed increased by\nTheir average 6-iron trajectory increased by 4.3 (signifi-\ncant, p < .05) and driver trajectory decreased by 0.9.\nTypically, while movement skills are being acquired, a\ntrade-off between accuracy and speed of movement is\nexpected, with one happening at the cost of the other.19\nHowever, this was not the case in the present study, in\nwhich accuracy was judged by trajectory or the vertical\nlaunch angle in degrees, which would be excessively\ndecreased in the absence of precision of ball contact.\nAn increase in ball speed and/or trajectory would be\nexpected to improve ball distance. According to the\nTrackman golf ball launch monitor manufacturer,23 a\ngain of 1 mph (0.45 m/s) of ball speed can increase\ndriver distance by up to 2 yds (1.8 m). In addition,\naccording to an instruction article on the PGA\nTOUR website,20 ``The general rule of thumb is: the\nlower your clubhead speed and ball speed, the higher\nyou need to launch the ball.''\nAlthough not quantified through biomechanical\nanalysis or video recordings, the MGS is designed to\nincrease rotational acceleration by moving the pelvis\nfrom a closed (facing away from target) to a square\nand finally an open position, during the downswing.\nThis movement is expected to have a greater\n``X-Factor Stretch'' effect, as there is likely to be greater\ndownswing separation of the hips and shoulders (which\nis expected to lag behind during the downswing because\nof the lateral torso- and head-tilt away from target).\nThe greater separation,5 in turn, is said to increase\neccentric muscle contraction, known to be beneficial\nfor seniors.\nWhile greater increases in ball speed might be\nexpected from an 11-session study, with or without an\nintervention, the authors believe that the large number\nof changes that senior golfers had to make all at once\nmay have required more than the six training sessions\nto stabilize, especially as poor shots were not discarded\nduring any of the measurement sessions.\nBall direction\nAt the commencement of this study (Tables 1 and 2), the\naverage starting (i.e. immediately post-impact) direction\nwas to the left \u00c00.9 for 6-iron and \u00c02.8 for the driver.\nIn addition, average starting directions for females and\nmales, respectively, were \u00c01.1 and \u00c00.8 for the 6-iron,\nand \u00c01.3 and \u00c03.3 for the driver. This reflects the\nexpectations of the Perfect Golf Swing Review website's\nsection on ball flight laws,21 which states that beginner\ngolfers tend to hit the ball starting off to the left of\ntarget. Comparing the pretest to the penultimate posttest\nfor all participants, there was a change in direction from\nan average of \u00c00.9 to 3.0 with the 6-iron, and an aver-\nage of \u00c02.8 to 1.0 for the driver (both significant,\np < .01). While female golfers also showed a change in\nstarting direction from the left, changes were not signifi-\ncant for either club. Male golfers' starting direction\nchanged significantly from left to slightly right, for\nboth clubs ( p < .01). With the interventional swing\nmethod, the starting direction of the ball is expected to\nbe either straight or slightly right of center only, and not\nrandomly left or right, because the pre-swing torso rota-\ntion of the MGS positions the body to face away from\ntarget. The arms, therefore, would not be expected to\neasily pull across the torso and to the left while the\ntorso was facing right (for a right-handed golfer).\nConsistency\nStandard deviation (SD) was used to indicate reduced\nvariability or greater consistency of shot making, with\nrespect to post-impact ball speed, trajectory and direc-\ntion (Tables 1 to 3). SD for speed decreased for both\nclubs, for all participants, females only and males only.\nSD for trajectory also decreased for all three categories\nwith the driver. Finally, directional SD decreased for all\nthree categories for the 6-iron, and for all participants\nas well as females only for the driver. No statistical\nsignificance was seen in any of the changes. Although\nnot quantified in this study, the MGS is expected to\nshow greater consistency because the trail-side lateral\ntilt of the head and torso during the backswing, com-\nbined with no in-swing rotation, allows the club to\nreturn to a more precise position every time.\nNovice and intermediate players (as seen in a table\ntennis study) typically show greater inconsistency close\nto impact during the skill acquisition phase.18 However,\nthe MGS with its curtailed overall degrees of freedom\nof joint movements would be expected to subject senior\ngolfers to less inconsistency even during the movement\nacquisition phase.\nDiscussion of the mixed effects model\nThis discussion incorporates all results from the pretest,\nas well as all four posttest sessions. The 6-iron and\ndriver speeds both increased significantly by a mean\nTrajectory increased significantly per session by a\nmean of 0.3 for the 6-iron, and direction changed sig-\nnificantly by a mean of 0.6 and 0.9 from left to right\nfor the 6-iron and driver, respectively, per session. All\nof the above results were obtained while controlling for\nthe fixed effects of gender, age, motivation pre-interven-\ntion, and years playing golf. Many of the other pre-\ndictor variables (fixed effects) also significantly\naffected ball speed, trajectory, and direction (Table 3).\nFor instance, 6-iron mean speed increased by 0.2 m/s per\nmeasurement session over time, by 0.6 m/s per year\ndecrease in age, by 0.1 m/s per unit of pre-intervention\nmotivation, and by 9.8 m/s for males as compared to\nfemales. Driver mean speed increased by 0.2 m/s per\nmeasurement session, by 0.7 m/s per year decrease in\nage, by 0.1 m/s per unit increase in pre-intervention\nmotivation, and by 14.6m/s for males as compared to\nfemales. The results show that a slow but steady\nimprovement took place over the duration of this\nstudy. All significant effects of all predictor variables,\non the three dependent variables of this study, as seen\nfrom the mixed effects model, are listed in Table 4. Non-\nsignificant results have not been included in the table.\nMotivation\nAlthough there was no statistically significant improve-\nment in total motivation, intrinsic motivation, or\namotivation in this study, 17 of the 21 participants\nwho completed the SMS II scale were seen to either\nincrease (11) or maintain (6) intrinsic motivation after\nthe study. This might indicate that they either felt that\nfurther practice would continue to improve their ball\nflight past the improvements already seen, or that the\nhighly precise steps for the set-up and backswing gave\nthem something extremely specific to work towards, to\nhelp them to attain desirable results.\nLimitations and future studies\nOne limitation of this study was that there was no\ncomparison group of participants who either only prac-\nticed, or who were trained in some other interventional\nswing method. It was felt to be important to use a\nrepeated measures design with participants acting as\ntheir own controls, to show greater homogeneity\nbetween pretest and posttests. Moreover, it was not\npossible to use the same participants for 11 sessions\nof no/alternate intervention and then for the MGS\nintervention because of time constraints. Additionally,\nthe authors believed that the number of pretest\nshots--20 per club--would adequately represent the\nexisting, typical performance of these golfers, most of\nwhom claim to play frequently. Based on this limita-\ntion, an attempt was made to control internal validity\nas strictly as possible. Threats to internal validity such\nas history, maturation, statistical regression, selection,\nmortality and testing, were controlled through the use\nof a very short-term, repeated measures design with\ncompletely different movements pre- and post-interven-\ntion. Equipment was calibrated prior to the commence-\nment of each session to contain any internal validity\nthreat from instrumentation. A second limitation of\nthis study was that no actual movements were mea-\nsured or recorded, as it was cost-prohibitive to do so.\nThird, in order to limit the number of dependent\nvariables used, side spin and back spin were not\nmeasured. Side spin combined with starting direction\nof the ball together determine the ending position of a\ngolf ball on a fairway.14 Side spin is especially import-\nant for the MGS, in which, after the rightward start\n(for a right-handed golfer) seen in this study, the ball\nwould be expected to curve back leftwards, towards the\ncenter of the fairway, in what is termed a draw pattern.\nFuture studies could include a measurement of all\nthe important movements, forces, and torques of\ngolfers' pre- and post-interventional swings, while com-\nparing the MGS with other swing methods or studying\nthe MGS for elite golfers, long-drivers, and juniors.\nIt may also be surmised from the present study that\nsix training sessions may not be adequate for senior\ngolfers, and that, in the future, more training sessions\nspread out over some months might be more\n614 International Journal of Sports Science & Coaching 13(4)\ninformative. It would also be beneficial to have a\nmatched control group that only practiced their\nswings without any intervention, over the same dur-\nation. A longitudinal study assessing the swing during\nplay as well as during more randomized practice over a\nlonger duration might also be informative.\nIn conclusion, the MGS, despite involving a\ncomplete change of set-up and backswing, can be per-\nformed fairly consistently in the relatively short time of\nsix training sessions, by senior golfers who are typically\nslower to learn new motor skills. Thus, adopting the\nMGS swing may help to improve some senior\ngolfers' existing ball-flight and their motivation to\nplay golf.\n"
