The associations between HIV infection and four key\nlife course transitions considered individually (age at\nsexual debut, premarital sexual activity, entry into\nmarriage and marital disruption by divorce or death) were\nexamined. These transitions were then sequenced to\nconstruct trajectories that represent the variety of\npatterns in the data. The association between different\ntrajectories and HIV prevalence was examined, controlling\nfor potentially confounding factors such as age and\nregion.\nResults: Although each life course transition taken in\nisolation may be associated with HIV infection, their\ncombined effect appeared to be conditional on the\nsequence in which they occurred. Although early sexual\ndebut, not marrying one's first sexual partner and having a\ndisrupted marriage each increased the likelihood of HIV\ninfection, their risk was not additive. Women who both\ndelayed sexual debut and did not marry their first partner\nare, once married, more likely to experience marital\ndisruption and to be HIV-positive. Women who marry their\nfirst partner but who have sex at a young age, however,\nare also at considerable risk.\nConclusions: These findings identify the potential of a\nlife course perspective for understanding why some\nwomen become infected with HIV and others do not, as\nwell as the differentials in HIV prevalence that originate\nfrom the sequence of sexual and marital transitions in\none's life. The analysis suggests, however, the need for\nfurther data collection to permit a better examination of\nthe mechanisms that account for variations in life course\ntrajectories and thus in lifetime probabilities of HIV\ninfection.\nWith the development of life course epidemiology1\nand sequence analysis in demographic research,2\nincreasing attention has been given to the impact\nof early life experiences on adult health. This\napproach has the potential to be useful for study-\ning the AIDS epidemic because the temporal\nordering and timing of individuals' sexual and\nmarital partnerships may be quite relevant for\none's lifetime risk of contracting a sexually\ntransmitted infection.3\nMost previous research has focused on the\nrelationship between a single transition and HIV\ninfection. Several studies have shown, for example,\nthat early sexual debut is associated with an\nincreased likelihood of HIV infection.4\u00ad6 The time\nbetween first sex and first marriage, as well as the\nnumber of premarital sexual partners, are also both\nbelieved to increase the HIV risk substantially.3 7\nThe transition into marriage itself influences HIV\nrisks: women who marry before the age of 20 are\nmore likely to be HIV-positive than unmarried\nwomen of the same age, both because marriage\ntypically coincides with a dramatic increase in the\nfrequency of sexual activity and because husbands\nare generally older than boyfriends and thus have\nhad more opportunity to become infected them-\nselves.8 9 Marriage duration may either offer\nprotection or exacerbate the HIV risk. If both\nspouses enter the marriage HIV-negative and\nremain sexually exclusive, marriage affords con-\nsiderable protection. If, however, either spouse is\nalready infected or is subsequently unfaithful and\ncondom use within marriage is low, frequent\nunprotected sex with a spouse increases the like-\nlihood of HIV transmission.8\u00ad13 Finally, transitions\nout of marriage via divorce or widowhood are\nstrongly associated with HIV status.14 15 The causal\ndirection of this association may be difficult to\ndisentangle, however. For example, divorce may be\nprovoked by suspicion of infidelity and death may\nbe due to AIDS. Alternatively, those who are\ndivorced or widowed may subsequently become\ninfected in a later sexual relationship.\nWhile previous research indicates that each of\nthese life transitions and stages taken alone has\nimportant implications for HIV risks, life course\ntheory emphasises that they are not independent\nof one another. The timing of sexual debut, for\ninstance, marks a critical transition to adulthood\nthat has a significant impact on future patterns of\nmarital and non-marital relationships.16\u00ad18\nMoreover, when and to whom individuals marry\nhave a strong influence on whether or not the\nmarriage endures. Thus, it might be fruitful to\nexamine the relation between HIV infection and\nthe sequence of one's sexual and marital life\ntransitions--that is, an individual sexual and\nmarital trajectory. Analyses of the association\nbetween HIV infection and life course trajectories\nhave, to our knowledge, not previously been\nconducted because they require detailed socio-\ndemographic and serological panel data as well as\nsophisticated modelling techniques. In this paper\nwe take a first step towards such analyses by\nconstructing sexual and marital trajectories for 926\never-married women in rural Malawi, and by\nthen examining the association between these\ntrajectories and the HIV status of the women.\nAlthough the nature of our data does not permit\nSupplement\nidentification of specific causal pathways between sexual and\nmarital trajectories and HIV infection, we are able to distinguish\ntrajectories associated with a high HIV prevalence from those\nassociated with a low HIV prevalence.\nMETHODS\nData and study population\nThe data for this study are taken from the Malawi Diffusion\nand Ideational Change Project (MDICP). Since 1998 the MDICP\nhas collected panel data from ever-married women and their\nhusbands to examine the role of social networks in changing\nattitudes and behaviour regarding HIV/AIDS, family size and\nfamily planning in rural Malawi (details on sampling and field\nwork procedures, as well as the survey data, are available from\nthe MDICP website: http://malawi.pop.upenn.edu). In the\nanalyses that follow we use retrospectively reported data on\nsexual and premarital histories collected during the second wave\nof the MDICP in 2001, and on marital histories and HIV\nserology data collected in the third wave in 2004 (for details, see\nBignami-Van Assche et al19).\nmajority of women who were lost to follow-up between 2001\nhad died between the two survey waves (10.2%). Yet attrition is\nnot likely to bias the estimates presented in this paper, as\nillustrated in detail elsewhere.20 HIV serology data were not\ncollected in 2001, but HIV status measured from biomarker\ninterviewed in 2004 (lack of information on HIV status is due\nmainly to refusal to be tested for HIV). Of the women in this\nlatter group, 926 (90.4%) had complete survey information on\nsexual and marital histories and thus represent the sample for\nthe present analysis.\nMeasurement and quality of key indicators\nWe focus on four key events in the lives of rural Malawian\nwomen: sexual debut, premarital sexual activity, first marriage\nand marital dissolution via divorce (including separations) and\nwidowhood.\nSexual debut was measured by the woman's self-reported age\nat first sexual intercourse in the 2001 wave of the MDICP.\nAlthough it is well known that sexual activity in surveys is\noften underreported and/or misreported, reports about sexual\nactivity in the MDICP seem quite reliable.21 22\nWomen who reported that they did not marry their first\nsexual partner were inferred to have had premarital sexual\nactivity (or premarital partners), although we have no informa-\ntion on the number of their premarital partners.\nRetrospective self-reported information on women's marital\nhistories (including marital disruptions via separation, divorce\nor widowhood) was obtained from the 2004 wave of the\nMDICP. While there are different definitions of marriage across\nand within countries in sub-Saharan Africa, the MDICP relies\non respondents' self-reports of their status as married, regardless\nof whether or not there had been a public marriage ceremony.\nThus, both formal and informal marriages were included.\nMethods of analysis\nDescriptive statistics for the characteristics and sexual and\nmarital histories of the selected women are presented and the\nbivariate associations between HIV status and these character-\nistics and behaviours are identified. The four key events of\ninterest (sexual debut, premarital sexual activity, marriage and\nmarital disruption) are then sequenced in order to construct\ntrajectories that represent the variety of patterns in our data. To\ndo so, we first divide the sampled women into two groups based\non their age at sexual debut (before or after age 15). Second, we\nsplit each group into two subgroups according to whether the\nwoman married her first sexual partner or not. We split each\ngroup a third time according to the outcome of the first\nmarriage: remained married to first spouse, became divorced or\nseparated from spouse or became widowed (women who\nexperienced both divorce and widowhood were placed in the\nwidowhood category). We then evaluate how HIV prevalence\ndiffers across each life course event considered individually as\nwell as entire trajectories.\nFinally, we examine the association between different\ntrajectories and HIV prevalence controlling for potentially\nconfounding factors such as age and region. The MDICP data\nwere collected in three regions of Malawi (South, Centre and\nNorth) in which different religious and cultural practices are\nprevalent; the regions have consistently been found to differ\nsubstantially in sexual and marital patterns as well as in HIV\nprevalence. Specifically, we use logistic regression to model HIV\nstatus as a function of two sets of covariates. First, we examine\nthe role of each trajectory, controlling only for age and region.\nSecond, we add other salient characteristics of women's sexual\nand marital histories: the age difference between the woman\nand her first spouse; whether the woman or any of her spouses\nhad extramarital partnerships, both as reported by the woman;\nwhether the woman had been in at least one polygamous union\nduring her entire marriage history; and the woman's total\nnumber of lifetime partners (both spousal and non-spousal).\nCovariates are introduced in the model one set at a time.\nVariables in the full model were selected by using a conditional\nstepwise backward strategy in which the statistical criteria for\nentry and retention of variables in each model are p(0.05 and\np(0.10, respectively. Results are presented as odds ratios (OR)\nwith 95% confidence interval (CI). All analyses were done with\nSPSS Version 9 (SPSS, Chicago, Illinois, USA, 2008).\nRESULTS\nCharacteristics of women's sexual and marital histories\nTable 1 presents descriptive statistics for the respondents'\nbackground characteristics and sexual and marital histories, for\nthe characteristics and behaviours of their sexual and marital\npartners, and for the HIV prevalence associated with these\ncharacteristics and behaviours.\nBeginning with their premarital histories, 40.1% of women\nreported that their sexual debut occurred before the age of\n15 years, with the median age at first sexual intercourse being\n16 years (not shown). About one-third (32.1%) of all women\nreported not marrying their first sexual partner. In addition, half\nof all women reported having had only one lifetime sexual\npartner, 35.4% two partners, and 19.8% three or more partners.\nWith regard to the women's marital histories, the median age\nat first marriage was 18 years (not shown). Most women\nseparated and 4.8% were widowed. During their married life,\n35.4% of women had been divorced at least once and 9.8% had\nbeen widowed at least once. Approximately one-third (30.8%)\nof all women said that their first husband had been more than\n5 years older when they got married, although 13.3% did not\nprovide age difference information. Due to sampling strategies\ndescribed elsewhere,23 the number of women reporting having\never been in a polygynous union was high at 50%. Extramarital\nSupplement\nsexual activity was infrequently reported by women, but nearly\nhalf said they knew that at least one of their husbands had had\nextramarital partners while they were married.\nOverall, the prevalence of HIV in 2004 for the women\nincluded in the study was 9%. Differentials in HIV prevalence\nby age were not statistically significant. As found in other\nstudies,24 differentials by region indicate a significantly higher\nHIV prevalence in south Malawi (12.4%) than in north Malawi\n(6.2%; p,0.05). Overall, women who had an early sexual debut\n(that is, by age 15) had a higher HIV prevalence (11.1%) than\nwomen who had a late sexual debut (7.6%), although the\ndifference was not highly significant (p,0.10). On the other\nhand, whether sexual debut occurred with a spouse rather than\nwith another partner and the total number of lifetime partners\nwere significantly associated with a lower HIV prevalence.\nWomen who were still married in 2004 had a significantly lower\nprevalence of HIV than women who had become widows (8.1%\nvs. 9.0%) and, especially, than women who had got divorced\none of the characteristics of women's marital histories most\nsignificantly associated with a high prevalence of HIV. Finally,\nof the other attributes of women's marital histories considered,\nTable 1 Descriptive statistics and bivariate analysis for the background characteristics and sexual and\nmarital histories of the selected women (Malawi Diffusion and Ideational Change Project, 2001 and 2004)\nTotal number (%)\nNo (%) with HIV\nBackground characteristics\nAge (years)\nRegion\nSexual history\nSexual debut\nFirst sexual partner\nTotal number of lifetime partners*\nMarital history\nHistory of divorce\nHistory of widowhood\nCharacteristics and behaviours of sexual and marital partners\nAge difference with first spouse{\nWas part of at least one polygamous union\nHad EMSP during any marriage\nKnows at least one husband had EMSP1\nEMSP, extramarital sexual partner(s).\n*Includes both spousal and non-spousal partners.\n{Includes women who were ever widowed and also ever divorced.\nSupplement\nonly a history of polygamy was significantly associated with\nincreased HIV prevalence.\nWomen's sexual and marital trajectories\nUsing information on sexual debut, premarital sexual activity,\nmarriage and marital dissolution, we identified the most\ncommon sequences or trajectories (fig 1). It is evident that an\nearly sexual debut is associated with premarital partnerships;\nslightly more than half (56.3%) of the women who initiated sex\nat an early age reported not marrying their first sexual partner.\nAlthough the combination of early sexual debut and premarital\nsexual activity might be associated with greater marital\ndissolution, this was not the case for the women in our sample.\nWithin the group of women who had an early sexual debut the\nrates of marital dissolution were remarkably similar, whether\nthey did or did not marry their first sexual partner.\nInterestingly, however, the cause of the dissolution differed\nsubstantially. Over 15% of women who had sex before the age\nof 15 and married their first partner (ie, had an early marriage)\nwere ever-widowed compared with about 6% of women who\nhad sex before the age of 15 and did not marry their first sexual\nsexual debut occurred with a spouse or a soon-to-be spouse and\nwas associated with a stable first marriage: 64.3% of women in\nthis group reported an intact first marriage (trajectory 7)\ncompared with slightly more than 50% of women following\nother trajectories (trajectories 1, 4 and 10). Overall, the most\ncommon trajectory began with a late sexual debut followed by a\nstable marriage with the first sexual partner (31.9% of all\nwomen considered, trajectory 7).\nHIV outcomes of sexual and marital trajectories\nFigure 2 shows the variations in HIV prevalence according to\nthe sexual and marital trajectories described above. Across all\ntrajectories the prevalence of HIV was lowest among women\nwho married their first sexual partner and remained married to\nthat same spouse. As noted above when discussing the results in\ntable 1, women who had an early sexual debut were slightly\nmore likely to be infected than those who delayed it (11.1% and\n7.6%, respectively; p,0.10), although the difference was only\nmarginally significant. Among women with a sexual debut after\nthe age of 15, those who did not marry their first sexual partner\nwere much more likely to be HIV-positive than those who\nmarried their first sexual partner (p,0.001). Among women\nwith a sexual debut at (15 years, however, women who did\nnot marry their first sexual partner were no more likely to be\nFigure 1 Sexual and marital trajectories of the women selected for the study, Malawi Diffusion and Ideational Change Project, 2001 and 2004.\nNumbers and percentages (in parentheses).\nSupplement\nFigure 2 Number of HIV-positive cases and HIV prevalence (in parentheses) by sexual and marital trajectories of the women selected for the study,\nTable 2 Multivariate logistic regression analysis of HIV infection by trajectory membership, background\ncharacteristics and sexual and marital partnership characteristics, Malawi Diffusion and Ideational Change\nBackground characteristics\nRegion\nTrajectory membership\nCharacteristics and behaviours of sexual and marital partners\nTotal number of lifetime partners\nCI, confidence interval; EMSP, extramarital sexual partner(s); OR odds ratio.\nDifferences in the likelihood scores between models 1 and 2 with 3 degrees of freedom were statistically significant (difference in\nSupplement\nHIV-positive than women who did. This finding can be\npartially explained by the relatively high proportion of these\nyoung married women who are ever-widowed and that 40% of\nthese widows are HIV-positive. Not surprisingly, widows\nalways exhibit an increased HIV prevalence (trajectories 3, 6,\n9 and 12). Ever-divorced women also had a higher HIV\nprevalence than women who remained in their first marriages.\nThe trajectories presented in figs 1 and 2 do not take into\naccount potentially confounding factors, most notably\nwomen's age and their place of residence. In table 2 we show\nthe results of the logistic regression analysis of individual HIV\nstatus as a function of trajectory membership, background\ncharacteristics and sexual and marital partnership characteris-\ntics for the ever-married women in our sample. Because of\nendogeneity between marital dissolution and HIV status, we\nuse an ``abridged'' version of the full trajectories presented in\nfigs 1 and 2. This abridged version examines only the timing of\nsexual debut and whether or not the respondent marries her\nfirst sexual partner.\nModel 1 evaluates the impact of trajectory membership on\nHIV status controlling for age and region of residence. The\ncombination of delaying sexual debut and marrying one's first\nsexual partner was associated with the lowest odds of being\ninfected with HIV. Women who delayed sexual debut and did\nnot marry their first sexual partner had the highest odds of\nbeing HIV-positive (OR 2.59; p,0.05). These findings provide\nan important insight: it appears that neither delaying sex nor\navoiding having a premarital partner alone offers a clear\nprotective advantage, but rather their effects are conditional\non each other.\nControlling for sexual and marital partnership characteristics\n(model 2) only slightly reduces the magnitude of the effect\nnoted above, but not its significance (OR 2.52; p,0.05). We also\nfound, as others have,25 26 that the number of lifetime partners\n(both spousal and non-spousal) was an important covariate of\nHIV risk net of all other factors. Indeed, the number of lifetime\npartners had a stronger impact on HIV risk than following any\nof the trajectories in the model, although these experiences were\nclearly interrelated.\nDISCUSSION\nWe have explored the links between sexual and marital\ntrajectories and HIV status among ever-married women living\nin rural Malawi. Our first set of findings (presented in fig 1)\nshows that women's sexual and marital transitions are linked\nover their life course. Of all the women, those who delay sex\nand marry their first sexual partner are the most likely to have a\nstable first marriage. In contrast, women who become sexually\nactive before the age of 15 and marry their first partner have\nexceptionally high levels of widowhood. Even though our\ntrajectories do not control for women's age or marriage\nduration, sexual and marital transitions are clearly trajectory-\ndependent, although they are usually treated as independent\nfactors in HIV research.\nOur second set of findings indicates that different sexual and\nmarital trajectories are related to current HIV status. Consistent\nwith other research,3\u00ad6 we found a weak bivariate association\nbetween early sexual debut and a higher likelihood of HIV\ninfection, and a strong bivariate association between premarital\npartners (other than one's spouse) and being HIV-positive.\nFinally, in accordance with other studies showing an association\nbetween marital disruption and HIV,14 15 we found that,\nregardless of their premarital sexual histories, women who are\nin their first marriage were the least likely to be HIV-infected.\nThis suggests that future research should focus on identifying\nthe direction of the causal relationship between a disrupted\nmarriage and HIV infection.14\nOur main conclusion is methodological: important transi-\ntions in the lives of women are not independent and thus\nshould not be considered in isolation. Although early sexual\ndebut, marrying one's first sexual partner and having a\ndisrupted marriage each increase the likelihood of HIV infection,\nas reported by others,3\u00ad6 14 15 the risk is not additive. The\nstrongest evidence for this conclusion comes from our multi-\nvariate regression analyses (presented in table 2). We found a\nclear interaction between delaying sexual debut and premarital\npartnerships. Nearly half of the women in our sample delayed\nsex and married their first partner, which is the trajectory\nassociated with the lowest prevalence of HIV. Simply delaying\nsexual debut past the age of 15 alone, however, is not sufficient\nprotection: women who delay sexual activity but do not marry\ntheir first partner are the most likely to become infected. This\nresult reflects both the higher rates of divorce and widowhood\nas well as the higher rates of HIV among those divorced and\nwidowed in this group (see trajectories 11 and 12). Similarly,\nmarrying one's first sexual partner does not always reduce the\nHIV risk. Conditional on early sexual activity, women who\nmarried their first sexual partner were more likely to be HIV-\npositive than those who did not. Since many of the women in\nthis category are young brides with older husbands, it is not\nsurprising that over 15% become widows. What is more\nsurprising is the rate of HIV infection among these early\nmarrying widows. An astonishing 40% were HIV-positive,\nrepresenting the trajectory associated with the highest levels of\nHIV (trajectory 3). These findings highlight the complex and\ndynamic relationships between life transitions and HIV risks,\nwhich are often inadequately captured by focusing on individual\ntransitions rather than on their sequence.\nOne of the main limitations of our study is that it relies on\nself-reported retrospective data that may be subject to a variety\nof biases including problems in reporting dates with accuracy,\nthe selective omission of unsuccessful or short unions, and social\ndesirability bias when reporting on the occurrence and timing of\nsexual partnerships. Our results may also be prone to selection\nbias because women who were interviewed in 2001 but could\nnot be re-interviewed in 2004 were slightly more likely to have\nalready been divorced or widowed. Since HIV testing of MDICP\nrespondents began in 2004, we cannot determine whether HIV\nprevalence among women lost to follow-up in 2004 was\ndifferent from HIV prevalence among the women who were\nsuccessfully re-interviewed. As a consequence, we cannot fully\ndetermine the extent of this bias. We verified, however, that\nthere was no significant difference in sexual and marital\nhistories between women who accepted to be tested for HIV\nin 2004 and those who refused. Moreover, since our results rely\non a sample of ever-married women, we cannot make direct\ncomparisons with women who never married. Finally, limita-\ntions of the data used for the analysis include the fact that HIV\nstatus was based on prevalent rather than incident infection, so\nwe cannot make causal inferences about HIV infection and\nsexual and marital trajectories, particularly with respect to\nmarital dissolution. It is unlikely, however, that HIV is an\nimportant determinant of the timing of sexual debut or of\nhaving premarital partners since a very small percentage of\nindividuals in rural Malawi are aware of their HIV status.\nDespite these limitations, our findings indicate the potential\nof a life course perspective for providing insights into the\nsources of variation in HIV infection. Sexual debut, marriage\nSupplement\nand marital disruption all occur over time, as does HIV\ninfection; what we have shown is that the sequence matters.\nThe full potential that a life course perspective brings to\nilluminate the mechanisms that determine distinct sexual\nmarital trajectories and differences in the lifetime probabilities\nof HIV infection, in Malawi as elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa,\ncannot be exploited without collecting new data that permit\nestablishing the timing of HIV infection in the life course of\nindividuals.\nAcknowledgements: : CB was the lead author for the paper and was responsible for\nthe data analysis and the initial drafting of the manuscript.
