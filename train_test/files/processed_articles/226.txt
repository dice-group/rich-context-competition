    "reduced_content": "Shared Variance Among Age, Sensory Function,\nand Cognitive Function in Older Adults\nKaarin J. Anstey,1 Mary A. Luszcz,2 and Linnett Sanchez3\n1Prince of Wales Medical Research Institute, University of New South Wales, Randwick, Australia.\n2School of Psychology and 3Department of Speech Pathology, Flinders University of South Australia, Adelaide.\nThe common cause hypothesis of the relationship among age, sensory measures, and cognitive measures in very\nold adults was reevaluated. Both sensory function and processing speed were evaluated as mediators of the rela-\ntionship between age and cognitive function. Cognitive function was a latent variable that comprised 3 factors in-\ncluding memory, speed, and verbal ability. The sample was population based and comprised very old adults (n \n894; mean age  77.7, SD  5.6 years) from the Australian Longitudinal Study of Ageing. The results showed\nthat there was common variance in the cognitive factor shared by age, speed, vision, and hearing but that specific\neffects of age on cognition remained. Furthermore, speed did not fully mediate the effect of age or sensory func-\ntion on cognition. Some age differences in cognitive performance are not explained by the same processes that ex-\nplain age differences in sensory function and processing speed.\nEVERAL empirical studies have demonstrated a robust\nassociation between sensory and cognitive function in\nberger & Baltes, 1994; Salthouse, Hambrick, & McGuthry,\nStankov, 1986). A common cause explanation suggests that\nthis association occurs because \"both sets of measures are\nan expression of the physiological architecture of the aging\nsensory acuity have been reliably shown to explain large\namounts of age-related variance in cognition. For example,\nLindenberger and Baltes (1994) found that sensory vari-\nables explained more than 90% of the age-related variance\nin a general cognitive factor. Likewise, Anstey and Smith\n(1999) found that a latent variable of indicators of biologi-\ncal age (including vision, hearing, forced expiratory vol-\nume, vibration sense, and grip strength) fully mediated the\nrelationship between age and a general cognitive factor.\nStudies such as these indicate that age differences in sen-\nsory functioning may provide a window through which to\nview age differences in cognitive function (Baltes & Lin-\nInterpreted in the broadest sense, a common factor theory\nof cognitive aging predicts that all factors mediating age-\ncognition relations are measures of the same common fac-\ntor. For example, both processing speed and sensory func-\ntion should explain the same portion of age-related variance\nin cognitive function. The role of processing speed has been\ncentral to theories of cognitive aging for more than 30 years\nthat speed reduces or eliminates the age effect on a range of\ncognitive tasks (e.g., Bors & Forin, 1995; Bryan & Luszcz,\nfore pertinent for researchers to evaluate the importance of\nsensory function as a mediator of the relationship between\nage and cognition concurrently with processing speed.\nLindenberger and Baltes (1994) evaluated the relative\nimportance of speed and sensory function in cross-sectional\nmodels of age differences in cognition. In one model, they\nfound that speed did not fully mediate the effect of age on\nsensory function but did fully mediate the effect of age on\ncognition. In a second model, they found that the effect of\nage on speed was fully mediated by sensory function, and\nthe effect of sensory function on cognition was fully medi-\nated by speed. They concluded that, although speed and\nsensory function were equivalent in their capacity to medi-\nate the association between age and cognition, vision and\nhearing were more important predictors of age differences\nbecause they explained all age-related variance in cognition\n(including speed) whereas speed did not explain all the age-\nrelated variance in sensory function. These authors did not\nfind that sensory function explained any more age-related\nvariance in cognitive function than processing speed. In\nterms of models of cognitive aging, sensory function and\nspeed were equally powerful mediators. However, in terms\nof explaining overall age differences, sensory function was\na more powerful predictor than speed. That is, compared\nwith speed, sensory function explained a larger proportion\nof the variance in age, consistent with the view that sensory\nfunction is a reliable biomarker (Anstey & Smith, 1999).\nAnother approach to evaluating mediators of the relation-\nship between age and cognition is in terms of the mediators'\ntheoretical independence from cognitive function (Linden-\nberger & Potter, 1998). Measures of processing speed are\nessentially cognitive variables may overlap theoretically\nand empirically with measures of cognitive function. For\nexample, many measures of cognitive function are con-\nducted under time limits, so the explanatory power of pro-\nS\ncessing speed may be partly due to the fact that it measures\nthis speeded aspect of cognitive performance. Furthermore,\nmeasures of processing speed often entail a small memory\nload, as do many measures of cognitive function (Piccinin\n& Rabbitt, 1999). For example, participants must often hold\nelements of the cognitive task in their mind while perform-\ning cognitive operations. Measures of sensory function are\nfrom a qualitatively different domain than measures of cog-\nnitive function. Although they involve some cognitive pro-\ncessing in that participants must understand test instruc-\ntions, sensory acuity tests are not speeded or timed.\nOn the other hand, the fact that sensory function alone\n(Lindenberger & Baltes, 1994) and in conjunction with\nother biomarkers (Anstey & Smith, 1999) has been shown\nto explain all age differences in measures of cognitive abili-\nties may indicate that sensory acuity is just a proxy for age\n(Salthouse et al., 1998). It is possible that sensory function\nis no more than an index of age or time. If this is the case,\nsensory acuity may not be a meaningful mediational con-\nstruct in this context and does not provide a substantive ex-\nplanation of age differences in cognition. Consequently, the\nrecent emphasis placed on sensory function as a mediator of\nage-cognition relations may be misguided, and the empiri-\ncal findings relating to the importance of sensory function\nmay be spurious, a proposition raised by Salthouse and col-\nleagues (1998). At the conceptual level, this criticism may\nbe refuted: one would argue that even if the association be-\ntween sensory variables and cognition is due to the fact that\nsensory variables are good measures of age, then it is still\nmore informative to relate age differences in cognition to a\nphysiological variable than to a measure of time. This is\nparticularly true in late adulthood, when individual differ-\nences in biological aging increase.\nEmpirical evidence against the \"spuriousness\" interpreta-\ntion of the association between sensory function and cogni-\ntion in old age would be found if sensory acuity explained\nindividual differences in cognitive function that were inde-\npendent of age differences, or if experimental manipulations\nof sensory acuity resulted in changes in cognitive perfor-\nmance. Anstey and Smith (1999) reported that biomarkers\nincluding measures of sensory acuity explained individual\ndifferences in measures of crystallized intelligence that\nwere independent of age. Studies of young adults have also\nshown associations among sensory variables and individual\ndifferences in intelligence (Li, Jordanova, & Lindenberger,\nmental evidence for the effect of sensory deficit on cogni-\ntive performance was also reported by Dickinson and Rab-\nbitt (1991), although Lindenberger, Scherer, and Baltes\n(1999) did not find a significant effect of simulated sensory\ndeficit on cognitive performance.\nExplanations such as the common cause model (Linden-\nberger & Baltes, 1994) relate the domains of sensory and\ncognitive performance at the level of brain functioning. The\ncommon cause model does not necessarily exclude the possi-\nbility of small specific associations existing between sensory\nand cognitive variables that are not shared with the more sig-\nnificant common factor. It is possible that, in addition to gen-\neralized brain aging, peripheral changes in sense organs af-\nfect perceptual and cognitive processing. Age-related loss of\nsensory receptors and neurons may result in slowing of per-\nceptual processing and less effective and slower encoding of\nnew information. This may directly lead to slowing of cogni-\ntive processing and increased errors on cognitive tasks. In the\npresent study we reexamined the role of sensory function as a\nmediator of the association between age and cognitive abili-\nties in late adulthood in a large population-based sample.\nOur specific goal in this study was to see whether the em-\npirical findings Lindenberger and Baltes (1994)--of a large\nproportion of shared age-related variance among sensory\nfunction, age, and cognition--would be replicated in the\nAustralian Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ALSA). The sen-\nsory measures used in the ALSA and the age range of the\nsample are similar to those used in the Berlin Aging Study\n(BASE), but the cognitive battery is much smaller and in-\ncludes measures of episodic memory that were not included\nin BASE. Nevertheless, if a common factor is responsible\nfor the observed association among cognitive and sensory\nfunction generally, it is reasonable to expect that this factor\nwould operate for a wide range of cognitive measures. Sim-\nilar to Lindenberger and Baltes (1994), in this study we used\nspeed as a part of the cognitive factor for evaluating the\ngeneral model, and then we removed speed and used it as a\nmediating factor in subsequent models.\nMETHODS\nSample\nThe sample was drawn from participants in the ALSA\n(see Luszcz, Bryan, & Kent, 1997, for more details). The\nALSA used the South Australian Electoral Roll as a sam-\npling frame to identify households with residents 70 years\nand older. The sample was stratified by age and sex into\nhort of individuals older than 85. Individuals randomly sam-\npled within these cohorts were invited to participate in the\nALSA on a voluntary basis. The participation rate for the\nbaseline data collection (Wave 1) was 55%.\nData were collected in two phases with two different for-\nmats. A comprehensive 2-h home interview was followed\nby a further individual clinical assessment conducted ap-\nproximately 2 weeks later. The home interview yielded de-\nmographic data and information on self-rated health, de-\npression, medical conditions, cognitive status, memory, and\nsubjective measures of vision, audition, and physical perfor-\nmance. Individual clinical assessments provided objective\ncognitive and sensory data. For the first wave of the study,\nunderwent portions of the clinical assessment. The sample\nfor the present study comprised participants who completed\nthe clinical assessment and interview and had complete data\non the variables used in structural equation modeling. This\nMeasures of Cognitive Function\nMost of the cognitive measures have been described\nmore fully elsewhere (Luszcz et al., 1997). Some were\nbased on measures developed as part of the Canberra Inven-\ntory for the Elderly (CIE; see Christensen et al., 1994);\nthese included Similarities, Definitions, and Address Mem-\nory. Measures are grouped according to the latent variables\nused in the structural equation models.\nVerbal.--Verbal skills were assessed with four mea-\nsures.\n1. Similarities. Three items (apple-banana, boat-car, egg-\nseed) taken from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-\nRevised (WAIS-R; Wechsler, 1981) assessed verbal rea-\nsoning. They were scored 0 (incorrect) or 1 (correct) to\ngive a possible total of 3.\n2. Definitions. Using vocabulary items drawn from the\nWAIS-R (Wechsler, 1981), participants defined three\nitems (repairman, terminate, compassion), which were\nscored 0 (incorrect) or 1 (correct) for a possible total of\n3. Test-retest reliability was .69.\n3. Confrontation naming. A short form of the Boston Nam-\ning Test (Mack, Freed, Williams, & Henderson, 1992)\nwas used for assessment of confrontation naming. The\nfour different versions of this test were counterbalanced\nacross participants. They were shown drawings, one at a\ntime, and asked to name the object illustrated. According\nto standard instructions, if participants were unable to\nname the object or seemed confused about what it was,\nthey were given a stimulus cue (semantic cue). If they\nwere still unable to name the item, a phonemic cue was\ngiven. Up to 20 s were allowed for each response. If par-\nticipants were still unable to name the item after both\ncues had been presented, the label was provided. This\nprocedure ensured that participants knew the name of\neach item. A score of 1 was given for each item correctly\nnamed without cues, for a maximum possible total of 15.\nObserved scores on confrontation naming ranged from 6\n4. The National Adult Reading Test (NART; Nelson, 1982)\nmeasures verbal knowledge as an element of crystallized\nof irregular pronunciation that respondents are asked to\nread aloud. The number of items named correctly was\nused. Test-retest reliability was .83 (Luszcz et al., 1997).\nSpeed.--The Digit Symbol Substitution (DSS) subscale\nof the WAIS-R (Wechsler, 1981) was used for assessment\nof processing speed (Bryan & Luszcz, 1996; Salthouse,\n1991). The participant was required to substitute symbols\ncorresponding to the numbers 1 through 9 into a randomly\nordered array of 93 digits. Symbols to be used were avail-\nable throughout the task on a code sheet illustrating the 9\ndigit-symbol pairs. The participant was required to make\nsubstitutions as rapidly as possible. The number of substitu-\ntions completed correctly in 90 s made up the measure of\nprocessing speed. Observed scores ranged from 0 to 67.\nMemory.--Symbol, picture, and address memory were\nassessed.\n1. Symbol memory. The DSS also provided a basis for inci-\ndental symbol memory. Participants were required to\ncomplete all 93 substitutions to equate exposure to the\nstimuli. Upon completion of the DSS, participants were\ngiven a symbol recall sheet with the numbers 1 through 9\nminus the symbols and asked to draw as many of the\nsymbols as they could remember with each number. Par-\nticipants had not been informed at any time that they\nwould be required to recall the symbols. The possible\nscore for symbols correctly recalled was 9, and this was\nused as a measure of incidental symbol memory. Ob-\nserved scores ranged from 0 to 9. Test-retest reliability\n2. Picture memory. The Boston Naming Test also provided\na basis for incidental free recall of pictures (Luszcz et al.,\n1997). Participants were asked (without prior warning)\nto recall the 15 pictures immediately after the test.\n3. Address memory. Respondents were required to recall a\nsingle name and address (Christensen et al., 1994). The\nname and address were repeated up to five times until the\nrespondent remembered them. Immediate recall after the\nfirst trial for the five components of the item and delayed\nrecall a few minutes later were recorded. The maximum\nVision and hearing measures.--Vision and hearing were\nmeasured as follows.\n1. Distance visual acuity. Corrected distance visual acuity\nwas measured at 3 m for each eye with a well illuminated\nSnellen chart. If the participant wore glasses or contact\nlenses but did not have them at hand, corrected visual\nacuity was measured with pinhole testing. The eye not\nbeing tested was covered with an occluder and testing\nbegan on the 6/12 (.50) line. If the participant seemed\nhesitant or unsure of him- or herself, testing began with\nthe next largest print, that is, the 6/18 (.33) line. The par-\nticipant was encouraged to read the smallest line possi-\nble. The criterion for distance visual acuity was the\nsmallest line read successfully, (i.e., with at least half of\nthe characters in the line correctly read). For structural\nequation modeling, the logarithm of the minimum visual\nangle resolvable in the better eye was used as an indica-\ntor of a latent variable called vision.\n2. Near visual acuity. This was measured at 20 cm with a\nchart containing short passages of text printed in ascend-\ning sizes of font from 5 to 18. The left eye and right eye\nwere tested separately, and the score was the smallest\nfont at which the participant could read. A logarithmic\ntransformation of this variable called near vision was\nused for structural equation modeling.\n3. Audiometry. Portable audiometers with standard ear-\nphones were used for threshold testing. The participant\nwas initially asked whether he or she had a better ear; if\nso, testing began with that ear. Otherwise testing began\nwith the right ear. A bracketing technique was used to\nkHz. After a successful response, the presentation tone\nwas decreased by 10 dBHL; if the participant did not re-\nspond, the tone was increased by 5 dBHL. Audiometric\nthreshold for each frequency was determined when the\nparticipant responded consistently (i.e., 2 of 3 times) to\nthe minimum presentation level on the ascend. For struc-\ntural equation modeling, two ear-specific and one fre-\nquency-specific indicators were used. The ear-specific\nindicators consisted of the average of the frequencies of\n0.5-, 1-, 2-, and 3-kHz scores in the left and right ears,\nand the frequency-specific indicator was the average of\nthe left and right ear values for 4 kHz. There were large\namounts of missing data for the highest test frequencies,\n6 and 8 kHz, so these data were not used in the analyses.\nStatistical Analysis\nWe conducted structural equation modeling to evaluate\nalternative multivariate models of the interrelationships\namong the sensory and cognitive variables and age. For all\nanalyses we analyzed the raw data matrix using Maximum\nLikelihood. If necessary, the direction of scoring of sensory\nand cognitive variables was reversed so that higher scores\nindicated better functioning. Isolated missing values of pure\ntone thresholds were imputed on the basis of the partici-\npant's entire audiogram by the third author, a practising au-\ndiologist. No other missing data were imputed.\nIn the measurement model, all loadings were free, factor\nvariances were fixed at 1, and covariances among all factors\nwere estimated. We then specified structural models to de-\npict alternative interpretations of the data and tested them\nfor significance. There were three cognitive factors (Speed,\nMemory, and Verbal) and two sensory factors (Vision and\nHearing). Three groups of models were tested. The first\ngroup was based on the common cause model reported by\nLindenberger and Baltes (1994). The second and third mod-\nels were also based on models reported by Lindenberger\nand Baltes (1994) and involved removing Speed as a cogni-\ntive factor and using it as a mediator.\nRESULTS\nZero Order and Age-Partialled Correlations Among\nSensory and Cognitive Variables\nTable 1 presents the zero order correlations and age-par-\ntialled correlations among all variables. The correlations be-\ntween measures of sensory function and age are similar in\nsize to the correlations between measures of cognitive func-\ntion and age. From this table it is evident that associations\namong cognitive variables were only slightly reduced after\nage was partialled. Some large reductions in the size of cor-\nrelations among sensory and cognitive variables were evi-\ndent after we controlled for age. There were even larger re-\nductions in the correlations between the measures of vision\nand the measures of hearing after we controlled for age. For\nexample, the correlation between distance vision and right\ncorrelation between distance vision and average of 4 Fs was\nreduced from .17 to .04 after we controlled for age.\nMeasurement Model\nThe initial measurement model (MM1) included six fac-\ntors (Memory, Verbal, Speed, Vision, Hearing, and Age).\nBoth Speed and Age were single indicator factors, and their\nfactor loadings were fixed to 1.0. The data fitted well (see\nTable 2) except that the La Grange Multiplier test suggested\nthat confrontation naming be allowed to load onto the Mem-\nory factor, reflecting a semantic memory component, as\nwell as on the Verbal factor. When this alteration was made\nand the model (MM2; see Table 3 for factor loadings) was\nre-run, there was a significant improvement in fit (2 \nThe intercorrelations among the six factors in the MM2\nare shown in Table 4. The sensory factors, Speed and Mem-\nory, had similar-sized negative correlations with age in this\nsample, whereas the Verbal factor had a small negative age\ncorrelation. This pattern of age associations is consistent\nTable 1.

Memory, Speed, and Verbal\nloaded onto a single factor called Cognition. In this model\nthe effect of Age on Cognition was mediated by Vision and\nHearing, and there was no direct effect of Age on Cogni-\ntion. The larger than desirable ratio of 2 to degrees of free-\ndom in these analyses is partly due to the large sample size\nin the present study. All other goodness of fit indices indi-\ncated that this model was highly acceptable (Table 2). A\nsecond version of this model was tested that included the\npath from Age to Cognition and resulted in a significant im-\nis depicted in Figure 1.\nTo evaluate whether specific effects of Age on Memory,\nSpeed, and Verbal were unaccounted for the model shown\nin Figure 1, we tested further models that were the same as\nCOMCAUS2 except that direct paths were included from\nAge to each of Memory, Verbal, and Speed. For the model\nincluding a direct path from Age to Speed and the model in-\ncluding a direct path from Age to Verbal, a linear depen-\ndency occurred for the path between Age and Cognition.\nFor the model including a direct path from Age to Memory,\na linear dependency occurred for the variance of the Cogni-\ntion factor, and the model where Age was allowed to load\non all Verbal, Memory, and Speed simultaneously had a lin-\near dependency between the Memory and the Cognition\nfactor. The model shown in Figure 1 therefore provided the\nbest fit of the data. According to this model, most of the\nAge-related variance in Cognition was shared with sensory\nfunction, but a small amount of unique Age-related variance\nremained.\nEstimation of the Age-Related Variance in Cognition\nShared With Sensory Function\nTo allow for a direct comparison of results between the\npresent study and that of Lindenberger and Baltes (1994),\nTable 2.

Factor Intercorrelation Matrix for\nMeasurement Model MM2\nwe calculated the proportion of age-related variance in Cog-\nnition shared with sensory function. This analysis was con-\nducted in latent space (Bentler, 1995) where the square of\nthe residual coefficient subtracted from 1 gives the multiple\ncorrelation coefficient for the equation. The variance in Cog-\nnition explained by Age was 22.56%, the variance in Cogni-\ntion explained by Vision and Hearing was 31.94%, and the\nvariance in Cognition explained by Age, Vision, and Hear-\nance in Cognition was shared with sensory function.\nSpeed as a Mediator of Sensory and Age Effects\non Cognition\nIn the next model (SENSPEED1) the Speed factor was\nremoved from the Cognition factor and used as a mediator\nof the effect of Age and sensory function on Cognition. In\nthis model, Age had direct paths to Vision and Hearing, Vi-\nsion and Hearing had direct paths to Speed, and Speed had a\ndirect path to Cognition. This model also provided accept-\nable fit of the data but did not provide information about di-\nrect paths from Age, Vision, and Hearing to Cognition and\nAge to speed. In SENSPEED2, a direct path from Age to\nCognition was included, resulting in a significant improve-\nan additional direct path from Age to Speed was also in-\ncluded, and this also resulted in a significant improvement\nadded from Vision to Cognition. Although this path was\nsignificant, it did not improve the fit of the model. In SEN-\nSPEED5, the path from Vision to Cognition was removed\nand a path from Hearing to Cognition was added (Figure 2).\nThis resulted in a significant improvement in fit (2 \nrelationships among Speed, Vision, Hearing, Age, and Cog-\nnition. When an additional model with additional direct\npaths from Age to Memory was tested, linear dependencies\noccurred for the path from Age to Cognition. A model test-\ning the additional direct path from Age to Verbal did not\nconverge.\nSpeed as a Mediator Between Age and Vision, Hearing,\nand Cognition\nThe next series of models were based on the analyses re-\nported by Lindenberger and Baltes (1994) that examined\nSpeed as a mediator of the relationships between Age and\nsensory function and Age and Cognition. In this model,\nSpeed was used as a mediator between Age and Vision, Age\nand Hearing, and Age and Cognition. SPEED1 included a\ndirect path from Age to Speed and direct paths from Speed\nto Vision, Speed to Hearing, and Speed to Cognition. The fit\nof this model was barely acceptable (Table 2).

This model showed that Speed did not fully medi-\nate the effect of Age on sensory function or Cognition as\nmeasured by Verbal and Memory factors.\nTo test whether direct effects from age to Memory and\nAge to Verbal remained, we tested two models. In the first,\na path from Age to Verbal was added to SPEED4. This re-\nsulted in a linear dependency for the path from Cognition to\nMemory. In the second, a path from Age to Memory was\nadded to SPEED4. This resulted in a linear dependency for\nFigure 1. The common cause model including standardized path\ncoefficients with an additional path from Age to Cognition (COM-\nFigure 2. A model of Speed mediating the effects of Age, Vision,\nand Hearing on Cognition (SENSPEED5).\nthe path from Speed to Cognition. Therefore, SPEED4 re-\nmained the model that best fitted the data.\nEstimation of the Amount of Variance in Cognition\nThat Speed Shared With Sensory Function and Age\nWe calculated multiple correlations in latent space to en-\nable an estimate of the amount of variance shared between\nSpeed and Age and Speed and sensory function. For these\nanalyses Cognition was a second-order factor onto which\nVerbal and Memory loaded. For these analyses, the variance\nin Cognition explained by Age was only 19.9%, the variance\nin Cognition explained by Vision and Hearing was 21.50%,\nand the variance in Cognition explained by Speed was\n51.30%. Of the Age-related variance in this cognitive factor,\nVision and Hearing. Of the Vision and Hearing\u00adrelated vari-\nance in cognitive factor, 53.02% was shared with Speed.\nSummary of Results\nWe tested three groups of models that aimed to evaluate\nwhether a single mediational factor could explain the rela-\ntionship between Age and Cognition. The first group of\nanalyses showed that the common factor model fitted the\ndata well but that a model including a unique effect of Age\nin addition to sensory function provided the best fit. Nearly\n80% of the Age-related variance in Cognition was shared\nwith sensory function. The second group of analyses evalu-\nated the role of Speed as a mediator of the effect of sensory\nfunction and Age on Cognition. Additional paths from Age\nto Cognition and Hearing to Cognition improved the fit of\nthis model significantly, indicating that Speed did not medi-\nate all the Age-related and Hearing-related variance in Cog-\nnition. A third group of models was tested in which Speed\nmediated the effect of Age on both sensory and cognitive\nfunction. These models showed that additional direct paths\nfrom Age to Vision, Age to Hearing, and Age to Cognition\nwere significant. This indicates that a significant proportion\nof the Age-related variance in Vision, Hearing, and Cogni-\ntion was not mediated by Speed. Compared with Age and\nsensory function, Speed shared a larger total amount of total\nvariance with Cognition (i.e., the factor that comprised Ver-\nbal and Memory). However, of the total age-related vari-\nance in Cognition, a larger proportion was shared with sen-\nsory function than with Speed.\nDISCUSSION\nWe used structural equation modeling to identify a com-\nmon factor underlying age differences in sensory function,\nprocessing speed, and cognition. Overall, the results of\nthese analyses are consistent with those of Lindenberger\nand Baltes (1994) and support the view that a common fac-\ntor explains most of the shared variance among cognition,\nage, speed, and sensory function. However, significant\nunique effects of age, speed, and sensory function were not\nshared, indicating that small, unique effects of these factors\nmust be accounted for in theoretical accounts of the rela-\ntionships among these variables. The finding of unique ef-\nfects of age and sensory function in the present study, which\nwere not present in the Lindenberger and Baltes study, is\nlikely due to the much larger sample size and smaller cogni-\ntive test battery we used.\nThe cognitive battery in the present study was limited by\nthe small number of test items on some of the verbal tasks,\nthe single indicator of speed, and the limited number of cog-\nnitive factors represented. This was a result of time limita-\ntions placed on the cognitive component of this large epide-\nmiological study. Although the DSS is a well validated\nmeasure and widely used in cognitive aging research (Salt-\nhouse, 1992b), additional of indicators of speed would have\nimproved the measurement of this construct for use in struc-\nFigure 3.

Nevertheless, speed was retained\nas a separate factor in this study because of the important\nrole that it has had historically as a mediator in cognitive ag-\ning research. Because of the limited number of cognitive\nfactors represented in this study, analyses involving speed\nwere conducted on a cognitive factor comprised only of ver-\nbal and memory factors. Verbal did not have a strong asso-\nciation with age, which reduced the proportion of age-related\nvariance in the cognitive factor. Previous analyses of these\ndata have also shown that age remains a significant predic-\ntor of memory after control of cognitive and noncognitive\nvariables (Luszcz et al., 1997). It may be that memory does\nnot have as strong a connection with sensory function as do\nmeasures of general cognitive ability reported in other stud-\nThis may be due to age-related differences in strategy use\nbeing present on memory tasks but not present on tasks of\nspatial and verbal abilities (e.g., Moshe & Craik, 1996).\nIn the present study, sensory function explained more\nage-related variance in cognition than that explained by\nspeed, even though speed explained more of the total vari-\nance in cognition than sensory function. These results are\nconsistent with those of Lindenberger and Baltes (1994) in\nshowing that at the statistical level, sensory function is\nequally, if not more, important than speed as a mediator of\nage-cognition relations.\nThe measures of hearing did not include the highest fre-\nquencies, 6 and 8 kHz. These highest frequencies are known\nto be unreliable (Hickling, 1966), and the measurable rate of\nchange in the very old is greater in the speech range (0.5\u00ad2\nkHz) frequencies because of loss of hearing in the highest\nfrequencies (Brant & Fozard, 1990). If age differences in\ncross-sectional patterns of hearing can be inferred from lon-\ngitudinal patterns of hearing changes in old age, it is un-\nlikely that the lack of these highest frequencies resulted in a\nsignificant reduction in the size of the association between\nhearing and age. Consequently, not including these frequen-\ncies would not reduce the likelihood of finding support for\nthe common cause hypothesis.\nThe limitations of the sensory and cognitive test battery\nare somewhat compensated by the large sample used in this\nstudy in that the study had a larger statistical power. This in-\ncreased statistical power also revealed unique effects of age\nand sensory function that may not emerge in a smaller sam-\nple. Readers should therefore consider the size of the effects\nfound in the present study when considering the importance\nof the findings.\nCompared with results reported by Lindenberger and\nBaltes (1994), we did not find that as large a proportion of\nthe age-related variance in cognition was explained by\nspeed, although the general results were replicated. It is\nlikely that the discrepancy in the effect sizes between stud-\nies is due to the fact that in the present study the cognitive\nfactor examined in relation to speed comprised only verbal\nand memory tasks, whereas in the BASE study the cognitive\nfactor included measures of reasoning, memory, knowledge,\nand fluency.\nThe results of the models involving speed as a mediator\nalso provide some evidence that the relationship between\nsensory and cognitive function in old age is not fully ex-\nplained by age and is therefore not spurious. An indepen-\ndent effect of hearing on cognition was observed that was\nnot mediated by speed.\nAltogether these results present a complex picture of the\nrelationships among sensory and cognitive function. It is\npossible that a common factor representing general age-\nrelated changes in neurophysiological integrity, along with\nspecific age-related and sensory-related factors, contributes\nto individual differences in cognitive performance in very\nold adults. The specific factors may relate to both test taking\nand cognitive processing. Possible specific causes of sen-\nsory effects on cognition include age-related changes in\nsense organs and the effects of disease on specific parts of\nthe brain.\nAnother possibility raised by our results is that different\nrelationships pertain between memory and sensory function,\ncompared with other general cognitive abilities and sensory\nfunction. Further research is required to determine whether\nspecific disease processes are responsible for these specific\nrelationships and whether a decline in both cognitive and\nsensory aging is indicative of pathological aging. At this\nstage we still do not know if changes in specific sensory\nabilities indicate changes in specific cognitive abilities.\nMost of the research conducted in this field has used only\nthreshold measures of sensory function. It is possible that\nother measures and methods, such as sensory discrimination\ntasks and signal detection analysis, may provide useful ap-\nproaches to understanding the specific relationships among\nthese factors. Sensory and cognitive performance in old age\nis also influenced by a number of contextual factors not in-\ncluded in the models presented here (Anstey & Smith, 1999;\nLuszcz, 1998). Researchers must conduct longitudinal and\nexperimental analyses of the relationships among sensory\nand cognitive function to test and develop further hypothe-\nses about the general versus specific nature of the effects of\nsensory function on cognition in old age.\n"
