Drug-selling\nyouth were significantly less likely to report having a parent involved in their life and have\nsomeone to talk to about serious problems but were more likely to report exposure to drug\nprevention programming.\nConclusion: Selling of drugs by youth appears to be a byproduct of substance abuse and\ndeviance proneness, and the prevention programs these youth experience are likely a result of\nmandated exposure derived from contact with the criminal justice system. Assuming no major\ndrug supply side reductions, policies, and practices associated with increasing drug abuse\ntreatment, parental involvement and supervision, and school engagement are suggested.\nKeywords: drug distribution, prevention, adolescent risk, youth experiences, parental\ninvolvement\nIntroduction\nThe participation of youth in illicit drug selling is a serious public health concern.\nResearch suggests that adolescent participation in drug dealing has increased over\nthe last several decades.1 Prior studies have found correlations between illicit drug\nselling and high levels of substance use,2,3 violence,4,5 gang participation,6 and other\nforms of delinquency.4,7,8 As such, large numbers of youth who come in contact with\nthe juvenile justice system have a history of illicit drug selling.1,8\u00ad10\nResearch on adolescent drug selling in urban, disadvantaged areas, including youth\nliving in public housing, reveals that between 6% and 20% had sold drugs at some\npoint.2\u00ad4,7,11,12 The concern with respect to this relatively high prevalence is fueled by\nthe combustive relationship between drug selling and a range of problematic behaviors.\nFor example, studies have found an association between drug dealing and cigarette,\nA number of studies have also found strong associations between drug sell-\ning and participation in violence and delinquency.5,7,9,11 In an effort to clarify the\nCorrespondence: Michael GVaughn\nSt Louis University, Division of\nEpidemiology, School of Public\nEmail mvaughn@slu.edu\nThis article was published in the following Dove Press journal:\nSubstance Abuse and Rehabilitation\nNumber of times this article has been viewed\nsubmit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com\nDovepress\nDovepress\nVaughn et al\n\nrelations between drug selling and drug use, Altschuler and\n\nBrounstein7 compared the following four groups from their\nsample of young people in schools and community centers:\n(1) drug users and sellers, (2) drug sellers who do not use,\n(3) drug users who do not sell, and (4) youth who take part in\nneither activity. Results showed that youth in the drug users\nand sellers group were the most delinquent, and drug sellers\nthat did not use drugs were more delinquent than the other two\ngroups. Fagan and Chin5 found that levels of violence were\nintimately tied to the type of drug being sold. Of course, urban\ntied to the crack cocaine market. The dynamic relationship\nbetween selling illicit drugs (especially crack cocaine)\nand handguns as a driver of violence is consistent with the\ndrug\u00adgun diffusion hypothesis.13 Although the directionality\nwith respect to causation among these factors is not firmly\nestablished, and is likely to be complex and conditional, drug\nselling is part and parcel of a nexus of dangerous and costly\nbehaviors. In a way, drug selling serves as a sort of vector\nfor a wide swath of risky behaviors.\nCurrent study purpose\nDespite the high rates of drug selling among youth in juvenile\njustice and youth residing in disadvantage neighborhoods,\nrelatively little is known about the patterns of illicit drug\nselling in the general population. In particular, little is known\nabout how youth who sell drugs differ from those who do\nnot sell drugs. Knowledge of these patterns can provide a\ndeeper understanding of the association between illicit drug\nselling and the extent to which these youth are embedded in\nsubstance abuse, are involved with their families, and have\nencounters with prevention programming. The inclusion of\nfamily variables is important because bonds and connections\nto adults have shown to be a form of social control via behav-\nioral monitoring, and breakdowns increase the likelihood of\nproblem behavior such as drug selling.14,15 In the present study\nwe sought to extend previous research by answering several\nquestions. For example, how much more likely are youth who\nsell drugs likely to use drugs compared with youth who do\nnot sell drugs?To what extent are youth who sell drugs likely\nto have a parent involved in their lives and in what aspects?\nDo youth who sell drugs encounter or participate in youth\nactivities or prevention-related programming? National stud-\nies have not established the extent to which these factors are\ncorrelated with drug selling among youth. This is important\nto do so, because developing prevention or policy efforts\nwithout knowing the magnitude of these correlates in national\nsamples render these efforts less efficient. The goal of this\nstudy is to answer the aforementioned research questions and\ncontribute to the empirical foundation that informs preven-\ntion strategies aimed toward reducing drug selling among\nadolescents in the USA.\nMethods\nSample and procedures\nThis study is based on data from the NSDUH.16 NSDUH is\ndesigned to provide population estimates of substance use\nand health-related behaviors in the US general population.\nIt utilizes multistage area probability sampling methods to\nselect a representative sample of the US civilian, noninstitu-\ntionalized population aged 12 years or older for participation\nin the study. Multistage sampling designs are commonly used\ndesigns when attempting to provide nationally representative\nestimates.This is because interviewing all participants is not\nfeasible, so larger units are the first stage selected from, with\nsubsequent levels of strata partitioned until individuals from\nhouseholds are selected. With respect to the NSDUH, all\n50 states and the District of Columbia were employed.Within\nthis state-level stage one sample, secondary sampling units\n(stage two) were based on regions within large states com-\nposed of 48 regions and remaining states parsed in 12 regions.\nCensus tracts within these secondary sampling regions\nwere then used from which to select household or dwelling\nunits and individuals. Study participants include household\nresidents (residents of shelters, rooming houses, and group\nhomes), residents of Alaska and Hawaii, and civilians resid-\ning on military bases. To improve the precision of drug-use\nestimates for subgroups, adolescents aged 12\u00ad17 years and\nyoung adults aged 18\u00ad25 years were oversampled.\nNSDUH study participants were interviewed in private\nat their places of residence. Potential participants were\nassured that their names would not be recorded and that their\nresponses would be kept strictly confidential. Participants\nwere paid US$30 for their participation.All field interviewers\nsigned a confidentiality agreement, and the procedures and\nprotections were carefully explained to potential participants\nin the informed consent protocol. The NSDUH interview\nutilizes a computer-assisted interviewing (CAI) methodol-\nogy to increase the likelihood of valid respondent reports of\nillicit drug-use behaviors.16 The CAI methodology includes\na combination of computer-assisted personal interview-\ning (CAPI) and audio computer-assisted self-interviewing\n(ACASI) methodologies. ACASI is designed to provide the\nrespondent with a highly private and confidential means of\nresponding to questions and is used for questions of a sensi-\ntive nature (eg, substance use).

Substance use variables\nassessed were self-reported past-year use of alcohol and illicit\ndrugs (marijuana, inhalants, hallucinogens, cocaine/crack\ncocaine, heroin). These were dichotomously measured as\nuse and nonuse. Delinquent variables were self-reported as:\npast-year stealing an item worth 50 dollars or more, attacking\nsomeone with the intent to injure, arguing or fighting with\na parent, serious fighting at school or work, and carrying\na handgun. These were also measured dichotomously (ie,\nyes or no). Two dichotomously coded items were used to\nassess risk propensity including: \"How often do you get a\nreal kick out of doing things that are a little dangerous?\" and\n\"How often do you like to test yourself by doing something\na little risky?\"\nSociodemographic and mental health covariates\nThe following demographic variables were used: age,\ngender, race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic\nblack, Hispanic, and other [American Indian orAlaska Native,\nAsian, other Pacific Islander or Native Hawaiian, and persons\nreporting more than one race]), school status (in school versus\nnot in school), having a father in the home or not, ever jailed or\nincarcerated, total annual family income (less than US$20 000,\nmore), and metropolitan population density (nonmetropolitan\narea, large metropolitan area $1 million, small metropolitan\narea ,1 million). Family income was ascertained by asking\nrespondents: \"Of these income groups, which category best\nrepresents your total combined family income during the pre-\nvious calendar year?\" Proxy responses were accepted from a\nhousehold member identified as being better able to give the\ncorrect information about family income for adolescents who\nwere unable to respond to the income question. Additionally,\nwe also examined lifetime history of depression and anxiety.\nThis was based on whether the respondents were told by a\ndoctor or other medical professional if they had either of\nthese disorders.\nParental involvement covariates\nDue to the importance of monitoring, supervision, and con-\nnectedness for youth, several family involvement variables\nwere included. Seven items (0 = no, 1 = yes) were used to\nassess various forms of parental involvement. Sample items\nincluded: \"During the past 12 months, how often did your\nparents provide help with your homework when you needed\nit?\"; \"During the past 12 months, how often did your parents\nlimit the amount of time you went out with friends on school\nnights?\"; and \"During the past 12 months, how often did\nyour parents tell you they were proud of you for something\nyou had done?\"\nYouth experience covariates\nWe identified a number of variables that reflected contact\nwith prosocial activities and formal programming. Seven\nitems (0 = no, 1 = yes) were used to assess experiences that\nyouth had with prevention programming both in and out of\nschool. Sample items included: \"During the past 12 months,\nhave you participated in a violence prevention program\nwhere you learn ways to avoid fights and control anger?\";\n\"\nDuring the past 12 months, have you participated in an\nalcohol, tobacco, or drug prevention program outside of\nschool where you learn about the dangers of using and how\nto resist using, alcohol, tobacco, or drugs?\"; and \"During the\npast 12 months, in how many different kinds of school-based\nactivities, such as team sports, cheerleading, choir, band,\nstudent \ngovernment, or clubs, have you participated?\"\nStatistical analysis\nWeighted prevalence estimates and standard errors were com-\nputed using Stata 10SE (StataCorp LP, College Station,TX).\nThis system implements aTaylor series linearization to adjust\nstandard errors of estimates for complex survey sampling\ndesign effects including clustered data.

Next, we examined the associations between\nprior youth experiences, including contact with prevention\nprogramming, and illicit drug selling.

However, the duration and quality of the role of\nthese types of youth experiences is unknown and requires\nfurther research. Although little research has accrued on\ncourt-mandated interventions for youth, initial research\nindicates that the use of evidence-based treatments in these\ncontexts can reduce substance-related problems.17 Several\nquantitative reviews have shown that interventions such as\nmultidimensional family therapy can effectively reduce drug\nAlthough findings from the present study are nation-\nally representative, they do converge with results from\nprevious nonrepresentative studies with respect to drug\nselling in relation to alcohol and illicit drug use,3\u00ad5,12 and\ncorrelations between drug selling and participation in vio-\nlence and delinquency.7,9,11 While the present study found\npowerful associations between drug use and drug selling\nthere is no data in the NSDUH available to disentangle\nthis relationship. However, recent research by Shook et al20\nfound that 69% of the youthful offenders who sold drugs\nreported that they kept more than half of the drugs they\npurchased for their own use and 57% reported that they\nworked alone in their drug-selling activities. Importantly,\nfindings from this study suggest that many of these youth\nwho sell drugs are not merely engaged in an economic\nactivity, or part of a broader drug trafficking enterprise,\nbut their engagement in drug selling is tied, at least in\npart, to their drug use.\nAlthough youth who engage in a wide variety of prob-\nlem behaviors such as drug selling are in need of positive\nredirection, this task is not as simple as surrounding them in\nextant services. These youth typically present with difficult\ntemperaments, impulsivity, may have parents who are them-\nselves antisocial, and reside in difficult surroundings where\ndesperation and urgency are common. Although findings\nfrom this study reaffirm that effective parenting, communica-\ntion, and parental supervision can attenuate the relationships\namong drug selling, drug usage, and related problem behav-\niors, implementing these practices is no small task. Many\nof these youth are in families experiencing daily struggles\nrelated to employment, but also the parents \nthemselves may\nabuse substances. Also, parenting a child who is prone to\nsubmit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com\nDovepress\nDovepress\nVaughn et al\nrisk, rejected by prosocial peers, and developing deviant peer\naffiliations is not easy.\nThe sheer volume of illicit substances in circulation\ntempers optimism regarding the reduction in drug selling\nby youth. Absent major supply-side reductions, there are\nstill reasonable strategies that potentially may be helpful.\nIn particular, treatment for adolescent substance abusers\nappears sensible given the high rates of drug misuse among\nyouth who sell drugs.21 Certainly, this assumes a willing-\nness to enter treatment or that coerced treatment would be\neffective. Finding innovative ways to target youth, who are\nthe most severe substance abusers and the most violent, is\nimportant.\nStudy limitations\nResults from the current study should be interpreted within\nthe context of several limitations. First, the assessment of\nselling drugs was based on one item and did not capture\nthe frequency and extent of drug selling or the specific\nreasons for doing so. Although it was a single item,\nconvergent relations with substance use and risk-taking\nsupported its validity. Second, causal determinations\ncannot be made with respect to the associations identified\ndue to the cross-sectional study design. Another limita-\ntion is that the NSDUH relies on respondent recall and\nis therefore subject to the usual under- or over-reporting\ninherent in such assessments. Although the NSDUH is a\nnationally representative sample and its scope is perhaps\nunsurpassed, the survey does not include important con-\ntextual, situational, and precipitating information, which\nis necessary for a fuller illumination of the drug-selling\nphenomenon.\nDespite these limitations, results do provide useful\ninsights into the relations among drug selling, behavioral\nrisk, parental involvement, and prevention programming\namong youth in the USA.\n"
