We compared the difference in the patterns of\nrelationships among the key constructs between the American and Japanese samples.\nThe results confirmed previously suggested cultural differences while also discovering\nnew culturally different paths. The results generally suggest that individual-level self-\nconstruals matter more when anger is a culturally condoned emotion (vs. condemned).\nThe implications and limitations of the integrated model are discussed.\nKeywords: culture, independence, interdependence, anger regulation, life satisfaction\nINTRODUCTION\nResearch into emotion regulation has increased dramatically in the past couple of decades (Gross,\n2014). Initial research focused more on individual differences in the use of different emotion\nregulation strategies and showed that effective regulation of key emotions, such as anger and\npride, in everyday life mattered to one's life satisfaction (Gross, 2007). More recently, the focus has\nbeen extended to cultural differences in the use of emotion regulation strategies as well as to how\ntheir relationships with the key antecedents and consequences systematically differ across cultures\nIn recent years, there has been an increase in studies examining how one's culturally motivated\ngoals influence emotion regulation strategy as an antecedent (e.g., Park et al., 2013) and how a\nspecific emotion regulation strategy affects one's well-being as a consequence (e.g., Kitayama et al.,\n2015). However, there is a limited amount of studies that comprehensively explore the relationships\nbetween emotion regulation strategy and its antecedents (or moderators) and consequences (Butler\nThis paper closes a significant gap in the literature by proposing an integrated model that\ncan systematically examine three different approaches of anger regulation (i.e., anger suppression,\nAkutsu et al. Anger Regulation on Life Satisfaction\nanger expression, and anger control), independent and\ninterdependent self-construals as the psychological antecedent,\nand life satisfaction as the psychological consequence. We\nestimated the model using large representative samples of\nAmerican and Japanese adults to examine the associations\nbetween the two self-construals, three anger regulation\napproaches, and life satisfaction, and to compare the systematic\npatterns between the USA and Japan.\nAnger Regulation as a Mediator of\nCultural Self-Construals on Life\nSatisfaction\nIndependent self-construal refers to a self-conception that\nvalues autonomy and independence of individuals, whereas\ninterdependent self-construal refers to that values connectedness\nand interdependence (e.g., Markus and Kitayama, 1991).\nTheoretically, each individual possesses both while the balance\ndiffers across situations within an individual, across individuals\nwithin a culture, and across cultures on average (Benet-Martinez\na judgment process, in which individuals assess the quality\nof their lives based on their own unique set of criteria (Shin\na key manifestation of self-construal among other well-being\nrelated constructs such as affective well-being (Markus and\nsuggested that the effects of self-construals on life satisfaction\nwere mediated by anger regulation. As a specific example, Novin\net al. (2014) showed that emotion expression, along with social\nsupport provision, mediated the effects of self-construals on life\nsatisfaction both in the USA and Japan. In the following, we\nargue that anger regulation strategies mediate the effects of self-\nconstruals on life satisfaction and that they do differ between the\nUSA and Japan.\nsuggested that self-construals may critically shape the ways\nin which individuals regulate their emotions. They claimed\nthat emotion regulation strategies may be culturally reinforced\nto serve either an interdependent or independent goal. Thus,\ncultural models of being provide a theoretical foundation\nfor examining the cultural differences in emotion regulation.\nMesquita et al. (2014) argued that emotions are culturally\nafforded to the extent that they benefit the central concerns of\nthe culture. Specifically using anger as a concrete example, they\nargued that one's anger implies an attitude of not accepting the\nsituation, an assessment that one has a relatively high level of\ncontrol over other people in the situation (Frijda et al., 1989),\nand a willingness to influence these other people so that they\naccommodate one's own wishes, goals, and values (Stein et al.,\n1993). Anger is a well-studied emotion, especially in cross-\ncultural contexts, presumably because it is an emotion that\nhighlights the independent model of the self, which is dominant\nin Western cultures, including North America. That is, anger\nmarks individual entitlement and sets clear boundaries, and is\nthus beneficial in achieving the central goals of the American\nculture of competitive individualism (Boiger et al., 2013a).\nAccording to Kitayama et al. (2004), the culture may shape\nemotional experience via collective and personal processes. In\ncontrast to the independent model of the self, Markus and\nKitayama (1991) argued that the interdependent model of the\nself, which is dominant in East Asian cultures, emphasizes\nconnectedness with other people; the self becomes meaningful\nonly in the larger context of social relationships. Thus, although\neach of the self-construals would function within an individual\nsimilarly across cultures, the directions of the primary concern\nin social contexts could be opposite between the two types of\nculture.\nSpecifically, Boiger et al. (2013b) showed that anger was\nthought to be a culturally condoned emotion in the USA but a\nculturally condemned emotion in Japan, and thus the perceived\nfrequency of anger situations (i.e., a situation that elicits anger)\nwas higher in the USA than in Japan. If anger is a culturally\ncondoned emotion, whether or not to regulate it is likely to\nbe up to individual values-based preference in the context\nof USA cultural group. In contrast, if anger is a culturally\ncondemned emotion, it is likely to be socially or structurally\nregulated so that it will not be expressed in order to best\nmaintain social harmony in the context of Japanese culture. As\na result, individuals may not have much freedom to engage in\nparticular anger regulation strategies based on their own level\nof independent or interdependent self-construal. To support\nthis view of distinguishing between different levels of anger\nregulation, Mesquita et al. (2014) argued that culture should\nbe defined both at the level of the individual and at the level\nof the social environment and showed that the broadly defined\nculture plays an important role in emotion regulation. Similarly,\nDe Leersnyder et al. (2013) identified relational co-regulation\nand socially structured cultural norms, in addition to individual\ntendencies, as sources of emotion regulation in a cultural context.\nFollowing Spielberger (1996), in this study, we consider three\nstrategies of anger regulation: anger-in, anger-out, and anger\ncontrol. Each of the three anger regulation strategies is reviewed\nbelow in terms of its relationship with self-construals and life\nsatisfaction, in both independent and interdependent cultural\ncontexts, in order to further explore hypotheses.\nAnger-in/Anger Suppression\nAnger-in or anger suppression, is defined as the tendency to turn\none's anger inward, implying anger regulation by suppression\n(Greenglass, 1996). It is also regarded as the frequency with which\nangry feelings are experienced but not expressed (Spielberger,\n1996). It is related to conflict avoidance, guilt, irritability,\ndecreased life satisfaction, rumination, and depressive symptoms\nEnglish et al., 2012). Those who can suppress their angry feelings\nalso have a stronger perception of inadequate social support\n(Palfai and Hart, 1997). Therefore, anger suppression may be\nrelated to mental health problems that lead to lower levels of life\nsatisfaction.\nEng et al. (2013, Unpublished) showed that cultural self-\nconstruals mediate the cultural differences in the suppression\nof some emotions. Suppressing emotion basically goes against\nAkutsu et al. Anger Regulation on Life Satisfaction\nmainstream American beliefs that put a high value on\nauthenticity (English et al., 2012) and view high arousal\nemotions as ideal (Tsai et al., 2006). Moreover, since anger is\na condoned emotion in the independence dominant American\nculture, in which it is culturally appropriate to express anger\nto communicate one's independence to a larger extent (Boiger\net al., 2013a,b), a more highly independent self-construal would\ninhibit the use of anger suppression to maintain the level of\nlife satisfaction. For the same reason, even those who are high\nin interdependent self-construal would choose anger control\nrather than anger suppression to maintain relational harmony.\nAs discussed above, although cross-ethnicity studies in the USA\nsuggest a positive impact of interdependence and a negative\nimpact of independence on anger suppression (e.g., Butler et al.,\n2007), in Japan where anger is condemned and not expressing\nnegative emotion is a rather strict social norm, we argue that,\nregardless of their self-construal, people in general are likely\nto suppress anger in social situations where relational harmony\nmatters and that the impact of self-construals are small.\nAlthough, previous studies suggest the negative impact of\nanger suppression on life satisfaction in Japan (e.g., Eng et al.,\n2013, Unpublished), to our knowledge, there is no evidence\nor theoretical insights that can be used to predict cross-\ncultural differences in the degree of the negative impact of\nanger suppression on life satisfaction. In Japan where anger is\ncondemned, people would be used to suppressing anger and\nthus it would have less of a negative impact on life satisfaction,\nwhile people would feel more stress if they are forcibly restrained\nto keep anger inside by structural norms no matter what their\nindividual values are. Thus, we will make no a priori prediction\nregarding the cultural differences in the degree of negative impact\nof anger suppression on life satisfaction.\nAnger-out/Anger Expression\nAnger-out, or anger expression, is an emotion regulation\nstrategy of expressing one's anger outwardly, usually directing\nthe response at the target of one's anger (Spielberger, 1996).\nPeople in the independent American culture are more likely to\nexpress anger freely, or are even encouraged to do so, when\nthey feel frustration and anger to show culturally sanctioned\nindependence (Mesquita et al., 2014). Therefore, independent\nself-construal is expected to positively affect anger expression\nin the USA. Even in the independent USA culture, however,\ninterdependent self-construal is expected to negatively affect\nanger expression in order to avoid disrupting relational harmony\nsuggests mixed effects of anger expression on life satisfaction\nin the USA, it is difficult to make a clear prediction. See, for\nexample, Mesquita et al. (2014) for positive effects and Bridewell\nEvidence from Japan seems more complicated regarding anger\nexpression. On the one hand, anger expression due to frustration\nis condemned in Japan in order to better maintain culturally\nvalued social harmony (Boiger et al., 2013b). Therefore, higher\ninterdependent self-construal is likely to negatively affect anger\nexpression in Japan, while the positive impact of independent\nself-construal may be rather limited to expressing anger that\nreflects frustrated experience due to the strong cultural norm of\ninterdependence (Kitayama et al., 2015).\nOn the other hand, in addition to anger expression reflecting\nfrustration, previous studies suggest that there is another\nmotivation of anger expression, which is to display dominance,\nWhile both the frustration and dominance facets of anger were\nuniversally recognized, Park et al. (2013) demonstrated that\nthe dominance facet of anger expression was more prominent\nthan the other frustration-reflecting facets of anger expression\nin Japan whereas the opposite was the case in the USA.\nSpecifically, Park et al. (2013) demonstrated that those with\nlower subjective socioeconomic status were more likely to express\ntheir anger among USA samples whereas those with higher\nobjective socioeconomic status were more likely to express their\nanger among Japanese samples, and that the effects in the USA\nwere mediated by frustration while the effects in Japan were\nmediated by decision authority. Kitayama et al. (2015) extended\nthe findings of Park et al. (2013) and further demonstrated\nthat expression of the dominance facet of anger was positively\nassociated with various health outcomes in Japan whereas the\nexpression of the frustration facet of anger was negatively\nassociated with various health outcomes in the USA.\nWhile such previous research has demonstrated that\nindependent self-construal positively affects the frustration facet\nof anger expression in the USA, to our knowledge no empirical\nevidence is available regarding which of the two self-construals,\nif any, affects the dominance facet of anger expression in\ninterdependent dominant cultures. It is anticipated, however,\nthat higher independent self-construal will positively affect the\ndominance facet of anger expression because it is based on an\nindependence-oriented motivation to differentiate oneself from\nothers by affirming one's dominant and privileged status.\nDue to this multi-faceted nature of anger expression in\nJapan, its impact on life satisfaction is not clear. Thus, we\nwill explore the data without a priori prediction regarding this.\nSimilarly, it is hard to make a priori predictions regarding the\ncultural differences in the degree of the association between anger\nexpression and both its antecedents as well as its consequence.\nAnger Control\nAnger control refers to an emotion regulation strategy of\ncontrolling anger internally, staying calm, and not expressing\nit outwardly (Spielberger, 1996). While it is similar to anger\nsuppression, in that anger is not expressed externally, anger\ncontrol would involve some kind of cognitive processes such as\nto monitor and prevent the experience or expression of anger by\ncognitively changing the feeling of anger (Bridewell and Chang,\n1997). Thus, it would encourage adaptive functioning and help to\npromote and recognize the utility of efforts to adjust the intensity\nor duration of the emotion. It may not result in eliminating the\nemotion or escaping it altogether (Gratz and Tull, 2010; McRae\nUsing samples of young American adults, Bridewell and\nChang (1997) demonstrated that (1) anger suppression, followed\nby a lack of anger control, played a key role in predicting\nAkutsu et al. Anger Regulation on Life Satisfaction\ndepressive and anxious symptoms; (2) anger expression, along\nwith gender, played a key role in predicting depressive symptoms\nbut not anxious symptoms; and (3) anger expression, followed by\na lack of anger control and anger suppression, played a key role\nin predicting hostility. In the USA culture, high interdependent\nself-construal would be strongly associated with high anger\ncontrol as the best solution for achieving the individually held\nvalue of interdependence (i.e., maintaining relational harmony)\nwhile minimizing culturally salient negative consequences of\nanger suppression (e.g., high anxiety and depressive symptoms).\nHowever, although saving relational harmony would promote life\nsatisfaction while avoiding the negative impact of suppressing\nanger, compromising one's independence would lower life\nsatisfaction of people in the independence dominant American\nculture. Because these mixed effects would cancel each other out,\nit is expected that the impact of anger control on life satisfaction\nin the USA may not be substantially large while it is hard\nto predict its direction a priori. Contrary to interdependence,\nindependence would inhibit anger control as it inhibits anger\nsuppression. However, due to its limited negative consequence, if\nany, the negative impact of independence would be rather small.\nAs discussed, in Japan where anger is condemned and not\nexpressing negative emotion is a social norm, regardless of their\nself-construal, people in general are likely to suppress anger in\nsocial situations where relational harmony matters. Moreover,\nthere are no previous studies, to our knowledge, that indicate a\nsystematic influence of either independence or interdependence\non the choice between anger suppression and anger control.\nThus, we do not predict any substantial impact of both self-\nconstruals on anger control in Japan. No matter who chooses\nit, however, anger control is predicted to positively relate to\nlife satisfaction in the interdependent dominant Japanese culture\nwhere compromising showing one's independence may not be as\nvalued as maintaining relational harmony.\nModel\nA graphical presentation of the conceptual model that links the\naforementioned factors is provided in Figure 1.\nIn summary, in the USA culture where anger is condoned,\nit is expected that independent self-construal will be negatively\nrelated to anger suppression but positively related to anger\nexpression, and will have a limited negative impact on anger\ncontrol, if any. In contrast, it is expected that interdependent\nself-construal will be negatively related to anger expression\nbut positively related to anger control, and will have only a\nsmall negative impact on anger suppression, if any. Regarding\nthe outcome, it is expected that anger suppression will be\nnegatively related to life satisfaction. However, no clear prediction\nregarding the impact of anger expression and anger control on\nlife satisfaction will be made because each of them appears to\nhave opposing effects. While the impact of anger control on life\nsatisfaction is not expected to be large anyway, it is hard to predict\nits direction a priori.\nIn the Japanese culture where anger is condemned, it is\nexpected that independent self-construal will be positively related\nto anger expression, yet will have rather a small positive impact,\nif any, on anger suppression or anger control. In contrast,\ninterdependent self-construal will be negatively related to anger\nexpression, yet will have rather a small negative impact on anger\nsuppression or anger control. Anger suppression is predicted to\nbe negatively related to life satisfaction, whereas anger control is\npredicted to be positively related to life satisfaction. We made no\na priori prediction regarding the impact of anger expression on\nlife satisfaction due to its mixed impact.\nRegarding the cultural difference in the degree of association\namong factors, we predicted that the negative impact of\nindependence on anger suppression and the positive impact of\ninterdependence on anger control will be larger in the USA\nand that the positive impact of anger control on life satisfaction\nFIGURE 1 | The conceptual model.

Anger Regulation on Life Satisfaction\nwill be larger in Japan. We empirically explored the cultural\ndifferences of other associations among factors without making\nclear predictions.\nBased on the empirical evidence from previous cross-\ncultural studies using similar factors (e.g., Park et al., 2013;\nestablished the measurement equivalence of each construct (i.e.,\nindependent/interdependent self-construal, anger-in, anger-out,\nanger control, and life satisfaction) between the two national\nsamples. We anticipated that the cultural moderation effects\ndemonstrated in the previous studies would be reflected in\ndifferent patterns of relationship between emotion regulation, its\nantecedents, and its consequence in the American and Japanese\nsamples.\nParticipants\nWe used a subset of the Midlife Development in the United States\n(MIDUS) survey and the corresponding Midlife Development\nin Japan (MIDJA) survey conducted in 2008 to estimate our\nmodel (for a more comprehensive review of the MIDUS and\nMIDJA, please refer, for example, to Park et al., 2013). For the\nUSA sample, we used the MIDUS Project 4 of the second wave\nof the MIDUS (i.e., MIDUS II) conducted in 2004. MIDUS II\nis the longitudinal follow-up data from the MIDUS I that was\nof participants (N = 1,255) from the original MIDUS study\n(MIDUS I). The final USA sample consisted of 542 males\nSD = 11.5). For the Japanese sample, the MIDJA survey was\nused (N = 1,027). The final Japanese sample consisted of\nSD = 14.1). The t-test of age between the USA and Japanese\nd = 0.23). The chi-square test of gender and culture was also\nperformed (2\nthough these differences are statistically significant, effect sizes\nare small. \"Japanese respondents completed self-administered\nquestionnaires; the Japanese version was back-translated and\nadjusted multiple times by native speakers to generate analogous\nTable 1 shows the sample size, mean, and standard deviation\nfor each variable in the USA and Japan. As described above, it\nshould be noted that MIDUS and MIDJA samples are not truly\na national representative sample although they are much more\nnationally representative than rather limited student samples.\nMost notably, they are biased toward older adults. It would be\na part of the reason for higher mean of interdependence in the\nMeasurement Instruments\nThe Self-Construal Scale (Singelis, 1994) was used to measure\ninterdependent and intdependent self-construals. Responses\nto the 10 interdependent and 7 independent items were\nmeasured on a seven-point scale, ranging from 1 (strongly\ndisagree) to 7 (strongly agree). The confirmatory factor analysis\n(CFA) was conducted to examine our proposed model and\ntest the internal consistency of measurement items. As a\nresult, some items were dropped. The remaining items include\n\"It is important for me to maintain harmony or smooth\nrelationships within my group\" for interdependence and\n\"Speaking up is not a problem for me\" for independence\n(see Table 2 for remaining items with path coefficients).\nCronbach's alphas of interdependence were 0.60 (USA) and 0.60\n(Japan).\nAnger regulation was measured using anger-in, anger-out,\nand anger control subscales of the State-Trait Anger Expression\nInventory, each of which refers to the extent to which \"one\ncan keep angry feelings inside or can suppress anger or furious\nfeelings,\" \"one can express feelings of anger, furious feelings, or\nlose control,\" and \"one can control anger or furious feelings using\nphysical or verbal expression and communication,\" respectively\n(STAXI; Spielberger, 1996). Responses to the eight anger-in, eight\nanger-out, and four anger control items were measured on a\nfour-point scale, ranging from 1 (almost never) to 4 (almost\nalways). The CFA was conducted to examine our proposed model\nand to test the internal consistency of the measurement items.\nOne item was dropped. Sample items are as follows: in general\nwhen I feel angry or furious, I withdraw from people (anger-\nin); I express my anger (anger-out); and I control my temper\n(anger control). See Table 3 for all the remaining items with\npath coefficients. Cronbach's alphas of anger-in were 0.82 (USA)\nTABLE 1 | Mean and standard deviation for the study measures in the USA and Japan.\nUSA Japan\nIND, independent self-construal; INT, interdependent self-construal.\nAkutsu et al.

Four-point scale, ranging from\n1 (not at all important) to 4 (extremely important), was used.\nThe CFA was conducted to examine our proposed model and test\nthe internal consistency of the measurement items. No items was\ndropped. The remaining five items include \"I am satisfied with\nmy life\" (see Table 4).

Anger Regulation on Life Satisfaction\nTABLE 4 | Path coefficients of Satisfaction with Life Scale.\nJapan USA\nSatisfaction with Life Scale\nmodel, in which no path coefficients were constrained to be\nequal for both cultures, and a constrained model, in which\nall path coefficients were constrained to be equal for both\ncultures. Because the model fit index score with the constrained\nmodel with all path coefficients are not significant different\n= 7.01, df = 30, n.s.). This can confirm the cross-cultural\nsimilarities. There were covariates among all latent variables\nin both models. As suggested by Raykov et al. (1991), the\nSEM results were evaluated using two model fit indexes: the\ncomparative fit index (CFI) and the root-mean square-error of\napproximation (RMSEA). Fit indices of the unconstrained model\nwere as follows: 2\nand RMSEA = 0.039; and for the constrained model were as\nfollows: 2\n0.06 or less are regarded as indicative of good model fit (Bollen,\nin this study indicate that both models have a very good fit to\nthe data. Although, the unconstrained model was better than the\nconstrained model in terms of the CFI, there were no substantial\ndifferences in fit between the two models; both were a very\ngood fit in terms of RMSEA values. We decided to adopt the\nconstrained model (i.e., with factor equivalence across the two\ncultural groups) as the baseline for the subsequent analyses, as\nour main interest was in determining how the associations of the\nlatent variables differ between the two cultures.\nTable 5 shows the correlation matrix of the key variables as\nwell as age and gender. The coefficients were estimated using\nthe constrained model of the CFA, and were all significant at\nindependent self-construal and anger-out in the USA, and the\ncorrelations in Japan between independent self-construal and\nanger-in; interdependent self-construal and both anger-in and\nanger-out; anger-out and anger control; and anger control and\nlife satisfaction.\nMain Analyses\nOur intention was to develop an integrated model with the three\ntypes of anger regulation strategies (anger-in, anger-out, anger\ncontrol) serving as mediators between self-construals and life\nsatisfaction. We conducted a path analysis to test the integrated\nmodel as it relates to the effects of self-construals and anger\nregulation strategies on life satisfaction. A path analysis was\nconducted in which all path coefficients were constrained to\nbe equal for both cultures. Fit indices of the model were as\nfollows: 2\nAs shown in Figure 2, for the USA participants, independent\nself-construal was negatively related to anger-in,  = -0.31,\nand did not directly relate to anger control,  = -0.02,\nn.s.

More specifically, the negative association\nof independent self-construal with anger-in was significantly\nlarger in the USA sample than in the Japanese sample,\nwhereas its positive association with anger-out was significantly\nlarger in the Japanese sample than in the USA sample. The\npositive association of interdependent self-construal with anger\ncontrol was significantly larger in the USA sample than in the\nJapanese sample.

More\nspecifically, for both cultures, there was a significantly positive\nrelationship between independent and interdependent self-\nconstruals, as well as positive associations of interdependent\nself-construal and anger control with life satisfaction, whereas\nthe association of interdependent self-construal with anger-out\nwas significantly negative.

As expected for\nthe USA sample regarding the antecedent of anger regulation,\nindependent self-construal negatively related to anger-in and\npositively related to anger-out. There was no significant relation\nbetween independence and anger control, which was no surprise\nbecause we did not make a strong prediction.\nAs expected for the Japanese sample, both anger-in and\nanger control were not significantly associated with either\ninterdependent or independent self-construal. These results\nsuggest the limited impact of individually held self-construals\non regulating anger within oneself in Japan. While anger-in\nand anger control are negatively correlated, and may be used\nas exclusive alternatives by the American participants, they are\npositively correlated in the Japanese participants, and thus may\nbe used as equivalent substitutes.\nWhile both the individual-level difference and the social-\nlevel difference are rooted in cultural manifestations, they are\nnot the same and have a different impact. Specifically, their\nimpact on life satisfaction would be different even though they\nresult in the same anger regulation strategy. Although we did\nnot explicitly predict this, because little has been known about\nhow the source of anger regulation interacts with culture and\nalters the impact of a particular anger regulation strategy on\nlife satisfaction, our results indicated that the cross-culturally\ncommon significant negative impact of anger-in was even\nstronger in the Japanese sample than in the USA sample. One\naccount for this unexpectedly stronger negative association of\nanger-in for the Japanese sample is that it was due to the social\nnorm's coercive force making people conform to suppress anger\nfor the sake of social harmony regardless of one's individually held\ncultural self-construals, even if one is individually holding very\nstrong independent self-construal.\nThe positive association of anger control with life satisfaction\nwas significant only in the Japanese sample while there was no\nsignificant difference in the strength of the impact between the\nUSA and Japanese samples. Anger control involves cognitively\neffortful change or reappraisal (Gross and John, 2003; Gross,\nin this study, comes only after anger is felt. However, given that\nindividually held self-construals have no effect on anger control,\nanger control by reappraisal could possibly be more automatic,\nand thus less effortful and stressful for Japanese participants than\nConsistent with our prediction, anger-out was significantly\npositively associated with independent self-construal and\nnegatively associated with interdependent self-construal in the\nJapanese sample, just as in the USA sample. However, it was\nsurprising that the positive association of independent self-\nconstrual was significantly stronger in the Japanese sample than\nin the USA sample. Combined with the result that the positive\nassociation of anger-out with life satisfaction was significant\nin the Japanese sample, higher independent self-construal\nseemed to be associated with more frequent use of \"anger-out\nprivilege\" in the Japanese sample (Kitayama et al., 2015). For\nthe USA sample, anger-out was not significantly related to\nlife satisfaction, presumably due to the more complex mixed\neffects of showing independence, venting frustration, destroying\nrelational harmony, and displaying authority (Park et al., 2013;\nwhereas anger expression in terms of venting frustration reflects\na frustrating experience, and thus links to lower life satisfaction,\nanger expression in terms of displaying authority reflects one's\ndominance over others, and thus links to higher life satisfaction.\nMoreover, the former is more prominent in the USA whereas the\nAkutsu et al. Anger Regulation on Life Satisfaction\nlatter is more prominent in Japan (Park et al., 2013; Kitayama\net al., 2015). Although this \"multi-faceted anger mechanism\" was\nnot directly examined, our results are at least consistent with its\nprediction.\nThis study explored the overall mechanism of how two types\nof self-construal (i.e., independent and interdependent) and three\nstrategies of anger regulation (i.e., anger-in, anger-out, and anger\ncontrol) relate to life satisfaction. It provided evidence that anger\nregulation partially mediates the relationships between cultural\nself-construals and life satisfaction. We found a significant\nrelation of interdependent self-construal to anger-out and life\nsatisfaction for both cultures, and to anger control only for\nthe USA. While previous studies identified some antecedents to\ndepression, such as worry and rumination (e.g., Hong, 2007),\nand suggest its link to life satisfaction, this study was the first\nto explicitly link anger regulation strategies to life satisfaction.\nOur results demonstrated systematic cultural differences in the\nprocess. Specifically, two out of three pathways from anger\nregulation to life satisfaction were significantly different and\nthree out of six pathways from self-construal to anger regulation\nstrategies were significantly different between the two cultures.\nMore importantly, this study increases our theoretical\nunderstanding of the factors that feed into life satisfaction across\ndifferent cultural contexts. In particular, it suggests that future\nmodels of emotion regulation strategies and their consequences\nshould pay more attention to individually held self-construals as\nantecedents because these self-views tend to serve as antecedents\nof other cultural and individual values and behaviors that\nultimately feed into happiness and life satisfaction. The findings\nalso indicate that closely examining the effects of individually\nheld self-construals would provide more insight into other\ncultural factors at a different level, such as cultural norms\nand social processes. We believe that our results provide new\ninsights into the differential impacts of individual-level and\nsocial/structural-level cultural antecedents of anger regulation\nstrategies on life satisfaction between two cultures.\nLimitations and Directions for Future\nResearch\nFirst, as our model is correlation, one should be cautious in\ndrawing conclusions about the causal relationships between\nself-construals, anger regulation strategies, and life satisfaction.\nFurther experimental research should be conducted in both\ncultural groups to explore their causal relationships. Moreover,\nlongitudinal studies would provide insight not only into the\ndirection of the causal relationships but also into the change\nover time in the same individuals. Second, our data is limited\nto middle-aged to older adults. With respect to the level of self-\nconstrual, for example, Japanese participants reported higher\nlevels of interdependence than independence, whereas American\nparticipants did not differ in their level of the two self-construals.\nPerhaps this age group is more concerned with its in-group\nmembers (e.g., family) compared to younger Americans, while\nat the same time still valuing independence. Without further\nreplication with younger adults, we cannot be certain how much\nthe pathways to life satisfaction uncovered in the present study\nare valid within a culture. Third, our study samples were limited\nto participants in the USA and Japan. To investigate wider\ncultural variations, data must be collected from different locations\nencompassing diverse cultures. Fourth, the measurement of all\nof the constructs in this study is by self-report method. Thus,\ncollecting information from various sources and using different\nmeasurements in future studies would be helpful. Finally, yet\nimportantly, our study focuses on anger regulation but we\nbelieve that examining other emotions will provide synergetic\nvalue. For example, examining the regulation of shame, which\nis condemned in the USA but condoned in Japan (Boiger et al.,\n2013b), would complementally validate our anger-based results.\nIn some cultures, including the USA, expression may be\nfairly undifferentiated (e.g., one feels simply bad, including anger,\ndisgust, being upset, and sad). In contrast, in Japan, expression\nof anger may be more granular (e.g., anger may be specific to\nsituation A, but not situation B; see Grossmann et al., 2015).\nFurther research is needed to account for cross-cultural and\nindividual variance in emotional complexity measures.\nCONCLUSION\nThis study explored the proposed model using large\nrepresentative samples of American and Japanese adults to\nexamine the associations between the two self-construals, three\nanger regulation strategies (anger suppression, anger expression,\nand anger control), and life satisfaction. This study confirmed\ncultural differences while also discovering new culturally\ndifferent paths. In the USA sample, there was no significant\nrelation between independence and anger control. By contrast,\nin Japanese sample, these results indicate the limited impact\nof individually held self-construals on regulating anger within\noneself in Japan. While anger-in and anger control are negatively\ncorrelated with independence, and may be used as exclusive\nalternatives by the American participants, they are positively\ncorrelated among the Japanese participants, and thus may be\nused as equivalent substitutes. Moreover, our findings should\nhave the important implications for health care settings as other\ncontexts. Interventions attempt to reduce or relieve negative\naffect, although essential in some contexts, may not be universally\ndesired or helpful.\nSA and AY conceived the study.
