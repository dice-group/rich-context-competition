CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are essential to\ncontrol infectious virus but at the cost of tissue damage. An\nenigma in understanding the contribution of T cell subsets\nin pathogenesis resides in their distinct migration pattern\nacross the BBB (blood brain barrier). CD4+ T cells transiently\naccumulate within the perivascular space, whereas CD8+ T\ncells migrate directly into the CNS parenchyma. As MMPs\n(matrix metalloproteinases) facilitate migration across the\nglia limitans, specific expression of the TIMP (tissue inhibitor\nof MMPs)-1 by CD4+ T cells present in the perivascular cuffs\nsuggested that TIMP-1 is responsible for stalling CD4+ T cell\nmigration into the CNS parenchyma. Using TIMP-1 deficient\nmice, the present data demonstrate an increase rather than\na decrease in CD4+ T cell accumulation within the perivas-\ncular space during JHMV infection. Whereas virus control\nwas not affected by perivascular retention of CD4+ T cells,\ndisease severity was decreased and associated with reduced\nIFN (interferon ) production. Moreover, decreased CD4+\nT cell recruitment into the CNS parenchyma of TIMP-1 de-\nficient mice was not associated with impaired T cell recruit-\ning chemokines or MMP expression, and no compensation\nby other TIMP molecules was identified.

Leukocyte migration from the blood\ninto the CNS parenchyma at the post-capillary venules is a\nmultistep process (Owens et al., 2008). First, immune cells\ncross an endothelial cell layer associated with a basement\nmembrane to reach the perivascular space. This initial step\ninvolves a succession of interactions between leukocytes\nand the BBB endothelium regulated by adhesion molecules,\nchemokines and their receptors (Engelhardt and Ranso-\nhoff, 2012). Nevertheless, leukocyte accumulation within the\nperivascular space is not sufficient to exert effective or detri-\nmental responses during CNS infection or neuroinflamma-\nToft-Hansen et al., 2006). To access the CNS parenchyma,\nleukocytes must also cross the glia limitans composed of an-\nother basement membrane and astrocyte endfeet. Due to\nthe distinct composition of these two basement membranes,\nmolecules regulating leukocyte migration across the BBB en-\ndothelium are distinct from the ones involved at the glia\nC. Savarin and others\nlimitans, which requires expression of MMPs (matrix met-\nalloproteinases) (Agrawal et al., 2006; Toft-Hansen et al.,\n2006). MMP inhibition has been associated with leukocyte\nretention within the perivascular space and limiting clini-\ncal symptoms (Toft-Hansen et al., 2006). Similarly, decreased\nMMP-2 and MMP-9 activity by inhibition of extracellular\nMMP inducer is correlated with higher perivascular cuff\ndensity and decreased EAE (experimental autoimmune en-\ncephalomyelitis) severity (Agrawal et al., 2012). These data\nemphasize the importance of leukocyte migration into the\nCNS parenchyma during neuroinflammatory diseases and\nsuggest that MMPs are potential therapeutic targets to min-\nimize disruption of the glia limitans. Nevertheless, intrinsic\nmechanisms are already in place to limit MMP activity. Four\nTIMPs (tissue inhibitors of MMPs) inhibit MMP proteolytic\nactivity by interacting with their Zn-binding motif (Brew et\npressed within the CNS, TIMP-1 is induced upon inflammatory\nstimuli (Gardner and Ghorpade, 2003) including EAE and viral\nZhou et al., 2005b). An imbalance in the MMP/TIMP ratio is as-\nsociated with several neuroinflammatory disorders (Gardner\nand Ghorpade, 2003). This is evidenced by decreased disease\nseverity after induction of EAE in transgenic mice with con-\nstitutive TIMP-1 expression in the CNS, consistent with leuko-\ncyte retention within the perivascular space (Althoff et al.,\n2010). Similarly, T cell recruitment into the CNS parenchyma\nis increased in TIMP-1 deficient (TIMP-1- / - ) mice infected\nwith Toxoplasma gondii (Clark et al., 2011). Altogether, these\ndata suggest that TIMP-1 can control leukocyte recruitment\ninto the CNS parenchyma by regulating MMP activity at the\nglia limitans.\nFollowing CNS infection with the non-fatal neurotropic\nMHV (mouse hepatitis virus) strain JHMV, a rapid and well-\ndefined array of cytokines, chemokines and MMPs regulate\nimmune cell migration into the CNS parenchyma (Bergmann\net al., 2006). After initial infiltration of innate immune cells\n[i.e. NK (natural killer) cells, neutrophils and monocytes], re-\ncruitment of adaptive immune effectors is necessary to con-\ntrol virus replication and protect the host. Both CD4+ and\nCD8+ T cells participate in viral clearance, as well as tis-\nStohlman et al., 2008). CD4+ T cells provide help for CD8+ T\ncell survival and optimal anti-viral functions within the CNS\nand CD8+ T cells display differential migration patterns.\nWhereas CD8+ T cells are directly recruited into the CNS\nparenchyma after crossing the BBB, CD4+ T cells transiently\naccumulate within the perivascular space before traffick-\ning into the parenchyma (Stohlman et al., 1998). Previous\nanalysis of MMP and TIMP expression demonstrated unique\nTIMP-1 up-regulation within the CNS during JHMV infection\nwith no increased expression of TIMP-2, -3 and -4 (Zhou et\nal., 2005b). In contrast to other models of CNS inflammation\n(i.e. T. gondii infection and EAE), TIMP-1 was not upregu-\nlated in astrocytes but was specifically expressed by CD4+\nT cells confined to the perivascular space, with rare expres-\nsion in CD4+ T cells within the CNS parenchyma (Zhou et al.,\nacross the glia limitans.\nThe present study thus aimed to determine the role of\nTIMP-1 in regulating CD4+ T cell recruitment into the CNS\nparenchyma, as well as potential functional consequences\nof altered CD4+ T cell distribution on JHMV induced en-\ncephalomyelitis. Although virus clearance was not altered in\nthe absence of TIMP-1, disease severity was decreased be-\ntween day 7 and 12 p.i. (post-infection), correlating with de-\ncreased IFN (interferon ) production. However, flow cyto-\nmetric analysis showed no difference in overall CNS leukocyte\ninfiltration comparing WT and TIMP-1- / - mice. Surprisingly,\nimmunohistochemistry revealed that TIMP-1 deficiency cor-\nrelated with increased rather than decreased CD4+ T cell\naccumulation in perivascular cuffs. No alterations in the ex-\npression of other TIMPs, MMPs or chemokines were observed\nin infected TIMP-1- / - mice, suggesting the absence of com-\npensatory mechanisms. In addition, increased MMP9 activity\nsuggests during acute viral encephalomyelitis, TIMP-1 facil-\nitates CD4+ T cell migration into the CNS parenchyma in a\nMMP-independent manner.\nMice and virus\nHomozygous TIMP-1 deficient (TIMP-1- / - ) mice on the\nC57BL/6 background were kindly provided by Dr P.D. Soloway\n(Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, U.S.A.) (Lee et al., 2005) and\nbred locally. C57BL/6 control mice were purchased from the\nNational Cancer Institute (Frederick, MD, U.S.A.).

Signs of encephalitis,\ncharacterized by hunched back and ruffled fur, were initially\nobserved around day 6 p.i. with no differences between WT\nand TIMP-1- / - mice (Figure 1A). However, as symptoms\nprogressed throughout day 10 p.i., disease severity was sig-\nnificantly decreased in infected TIMP-1- / - compared to WT\nmice (Figure 1A). Nevertheless, reduced clinical symptoms\nwere only transient as both groups displayed similar disease\nseverity after day 12 p.i. (Figure 1A).\nDisease severity during JHMV infection is not only depen-\ndent on viral load, but also the balance of T cell activities,\nespecially IFN secretion (Kapil et al., 2009; Phares et al.,\n2010). The complexity of these interactions is highlighted\nby studies in mice with altered T cell activities: reduced\nclinical disease despite similar virus load, coincided with re-\nduced IFN in IL-12 p35 subunit deficient mice (Kapil et al.,\n2009), while more severe clinical symptoms, despite acceler-\nated virus control coincident with increased IFN in B7-H1\ndeficient mice (Phares et al., 2010). The participation of both\nCD4+ and CD8+ T cells in JHMV clearance and tissue damage\nrole of CD4+ T cells provided to anti-viral CD8 T cells within\ntute additional layers of complexity. Finally, the finding that\nretention of T cells within the perivascular space is associated\nwith delayed control of JHMV replication and disease onset\n(Savarin et al., 2010) supports the importance of parenchy-\nmal T cell localization in determining pathogenic outcome.\nThus, transiently decreased disease severity in TIMP-1- / -\nmice may be explained by accelerated parenchymal CD4+\nT cell infiltration mediating accelerated local T cell activity\nand virus control. However, similar peak virus replication at\nday 5 p.i., and decline of virus titers at day 7 p.i. with a drop\nbelow detection levels by day 14 p.i. in both groups, demon-\nstrated that control of virus replication was not altered by\nthe absence of TIMP-1 (Figure 1B). Similarly, reduced disease\nseverity did not correlate with decreased myelin loss in TIMP-\n1- / - compared to WT mice, as extent of demyelination was\nsimilar comparing the two groups at days 7, 10 and 14 p.i\n(figure 1C).\nHowever, analysis of a potential correlation between de-\ncreased disease severity and IFN, revealed that IFN mRNA\nwas reduced in the CNS of TIMP-1- / - compared to WT mice\nat days 5 and 7 p.i. (Figure 1D). No differences in IFN were\nnoted at later times p.i. (Figure 1D) when virus replication was\nalready significantly reduced. These data demonstrated that\nlimited early IFN levels within the CNS were associated with\nprolonged attenuated clinical disease in TIMP-1- / - mice.\nMoreover, reduced IFN implied that local T cell stimulation\nby viral antigen was specifically reduced in the absence of\nTIMP-1 at the time of maximal T cell migration to the CNS.\nTIMP-1 does not regulate overall CNS leukocyte\nrecruitment\nReduced IFN production during the peak of antigen specific\nT cell stimulation within the CNS, suggested limited overall T\ncell recruitment and/or limited T cell access to viral antigen.\nAlthough IFN is mainly produced by T cells during JHMV\ninfection, IFN mRNA expression is more prominent in CD4+\ncompared to CD8+ T cells at the population level in vivo\n(Phares et al., 2010), suggesting that decreased CNS IFN\nproduction in TIMP-1- / - mice was mainly due to limited\nCD4+ T cell responses. However, this contradicts our initial\nhypothesis that the absence of TIMP-1 would facilitate CD4+\nT cell access into, and thereby their effector function, within\nthe CNS parenchyma. Thus, to initially verify that TIMP-1 does\nnot affect overall leukocyte recruitment into the CNS dur-\ning JHMV infection, infiltrating CD45hi cells were measured\nby flow cytometry (Figure 2). Although CD45hi leukocytes\nwere higher at day 7 p.i. in the CNS of TIMP-1- / - mice\ncompared to controls, no differences was noted at any other\ntime point (Figure 2). The composition of leukocyte infiltrates\nwas also not significantly altered by the absence of TIMP-1.\nCNS neutrophil infiltration followed similar kinetics, with a\npeak at day 3 p.i. and a slight, but not significant, increase\nin TIMP-1- / - compared to WT mice (Figure 2). This modest\nincrease in neutrophils was sustained to day 10 p.i. The num-\nber of CNS monocytes in TIMP-1- / - mice was also slightly\nincreased at early time points, with the largest difference\nobserved at day 7 p.i. (Figure 2). Increased CD45hi leukocyte\ninfiltration at day 7 p.i. in TIMP-1- / - mice thus coincided\nwith a relative increase in monocyte recruitment, although\nthey decreased to similarly low levels after day 10 p.i. in both\ngroups (Figure 2).

There were also no differences\nin virus-specific CD8+ T cell recruitment (results not shown),\nconsistent with similar virus clearance between both groups\n(Figure 1B). Altogether, these data suggest that TIMP-1 only\nexerts a minor influence on acute inflammation and does not\nregulate the overall composition of leukocytes recruited into\nthe CNS following JHMV infection.\nCD4+ T cells are retained in the perivascular\nspace of TIMP-1- / - mice\nSpecific TIMP-1 expression by CD4+ T cells, coincident with\ntheir prolonged retention in the perivascular space at day\n7 p.i. (Zhou et al., 2005b), initially suggested that TIMP-1\ndelays CD4+ T cell access to the CNS parenchyma by in-\nhibiting MMP-dependent glia limitans disruption. However,\ndecreased IFN, despite similar CD4+ T cell recruitment, sug-\ngested reduced CD4+ T cell effector function potentially due\nto impaired access to viral antigen presenting target cells in\nthe parenchyma. This notion was tested by immunohistologic\nanalysis of the distribution of CD4+ T cells in the perivas-\ncular space versus parenchyma (Figure 3A). Total numbers of\nCD4+ T cells were similar in the brain of WT and TIMP-1- / -\nmice at day 7 and 10 p.i. (Figure 3B), consistent with flow\ncytometric analysis. However, CD4+ T cell retention within\nthe perivascular space was nearly increased by 30% in TIMP-\n1- / - mice at day 7 p.i. (Figure 3B). Moreover, despite the\ndecreased extent of CD4+ T cell cuffs in both groups at day\n10 p.i., preferential perivascular accumulation was sustained\nto day 10 p.i. in the absence of TIMP-1 (Figure 3B). These re-\nsults clearly support a revised notion that TIMP-1 promotes,\nrather than limits, CD4+ T cell recruitment into the CNS\nparenchyma during JHMV induced encephalitis.\nCD4+ T cell retention within the perivascular\nspace is not associated with compensation by\nTIMPs or altered MMP and chemokine expression\nWhile decreased accumulation of CD4+ T cells in the\nparenchyma was consistent with reduced antigen encounter\nC 2013 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Licence (CC-BY) (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) which permits unrestricted use, distribution\nand reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nC.

However, we could\nnot detect significant differences in expression of CXCL10\nor CCL5 mRNA or protein, two major chemoattractants of T\ncells during JHMV infection (Stiles et al., 2006; Stiles et al.,\n2009), comparing the two groups at day 7 p.i.

Nevertheless, accumulation of\nCD4+ T cells in the perivascular space of TIMP-1- / - mice,\ndespite increased MMP9 activity, suggests that CD4+ T cell\nretention is MMP independent.

This two-step process is highly regulated at several\ndistinct levels involving, integrins, chemokines and MMPs\n(Owens et al., 2008). Moreover, different infiltrating cell\ntypes appear to contribute to these migration processes by\ndistinct mechanism, e.g. preferential chemokine responsive-\nness or MMP/TIMP release. A common observation in many\nneuroinflammatory disorders is the distinct migration pat-\ntern of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells through the BBB (Stohlman\nCD8+ T cells traverse into the CNS parenchyma efficiently,\nCD4+ T cells appear to be transiently retained within the\nperivascular space. This pattern is clearly demonstrated dur-\ning JHMV encephalomyelitis, in which both CD4+ and CD8+\nT cells are essential in mediating virus clearance accompanied\nby tissue damage (Bergmann et al., 2006). Transient retention\nof CD4+ T cells within the perivascular space raises both the\nquestion of its functional relevance, as well as the identifica-\ntion of molecules regulating T cell access to the parenchyma.\nDuring JHMV infection TIMP-1 is specifically expressed by\nCD4+ T cells when present in perivascular cuffs, but not\nwhen located in the parenchyma (Zhou et al., 2005b). These\ndata suggested that TIMP-1 might control CD4+ T cell reten-\ntion within the perivascular space by disrupting MMP activity\nat the glia limitans (Toft-Hansen et al., 2006). However, re-\nsults presented herein indicate that TIMP-1 promotes rather\nthan delays CD4+ T cell migration to the CNS parenchyma\nas evidenced by increased retention of CD4+ T cells around\nthe CNS post-capillary venules in the absence of TIMP-1.\nFurthermore, similar expression patterns of chemokines and\nMMPs and TIMPs in TIMP-1- / - and WT mice, support an\nMMP independent function of TIMP-1 in regulating CD4+ T\ncell access to the CNS parenchyma.\nTIMP-1 was initially characterized as an inhibitor of MMP\nactivity, with a primary role in remodeling the extracellular\nmatrix (Brew et al., 2000). TIMP-1-dependent MMP inhibi-\ntion is also implicated in several other biological processes, in-\ncluding cell growth, angiogenesis and apoptosis (Gardner and\nGhorpade, 2003). However, TIMP-1 also exerts MMP indepen-\ndent effects (Stetler-Stevenson, 2008), i.e. apoptosis or cell\nproliferation, highlighting its complex and pleiotropic func-\ntions. Despite a correlation between imbalanced MMP/TIMP\nactivity with several neuroinflammatory disorders (Gard-\nner and Ghorpade, 2003), the role of TIMP-1 remains elu-\nsive. During EAE, constitutive TIMP-1 exerts a protective\nrole by maintaining BBB integrity through MMP inhibition\nand limiting leukocyte infiltration into the CNS parenchyma\n(Althoff et al., 2010). During chronic EAE, TIMP-1 plays an\nMMP-independent role (Crocker et al., 2006), potentially by\npromoting oligodendrocyte progenitor differentiation and\nremyelination (Moore et al., 2011). While our data sup-\nport an MMP independent function of TIMP-1 in promoting\nleukocyte migration across the glia limitans, the mechanism\n328 C 2013 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Licence (CC-BY) (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) which permits unrestricted use, distribution\nand reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nRegulation of CD4 T cell migration by TIMP-1\nFigure 5 TIMPs and MMPs do not compensate for TIMP-1 deficiency during JHMV infection\nExpression of TIMP-1, -2, -3 and -4 mRNA (A), and MMP-3 and -12 mRNA (B), analyzed by real-time PCR in na\u00a8\nive and JHMV infected\nWT and TIMP-1- / - mice.

Savarin and others\nconsequence of reduced antigen presenting cell-T cell acti-\nvation in the perivascular space or limited T cell access to\nparenchymal antigen presenting cells remains unclear. Nev-\nertheless, CD4+ T cells are potent producers of IFN during\nJHMV infection (Phares et al., 2010) and both IFN and CD4+\nT cells contribute to disease severity (Kapil et al., 2009; Phares\net al., 2012). IFN activates microglia/macrophages, which\nenhance disease severity during JHMV infection (Savarin et\nal., 2010) as well as other neuroinflammatory diseases (Ajami\nCD4+ T cells also promote virus-specific CD8+ T cell re-\nsponses both during initial peripheral activation and at the\neffector site during JHMV infection (Stohlman et al., 1998;\nPhares et al., 2012). Nevertheless, CD4+ T cell accumulation\nwithin the perivascular space did not affect control of virus\nreplication, suggesting that CD8+ T cells, primary media-\ntors of JHMV control, were fully functional in the absence\nof TIMP-1. CD4+ T cell helper function to CD8+ T cells thus\nappeared to be preserved despite altered CD4+ T cell distri-\nbution in the absence of TIMP-1.\nFinally, the difference between the MMP-independent\nfunction of TIMP-1 during JHMV infection and its role in lim-\niting leukocyte access through the BBB by inhibiting MMPs in\nother neuroinflammatory models (Althoff et al., 2010; Clark\net al., 2011) may correlate with the cellular source of TIMP-1.\nIndeed, TIMP-1 is specifically expressed by CD4+ T cells dur-\ning JHMV infection with no parenchymal expression (Zhou\net al., 2005b). By contrast, TIMP-1 is up-regulated in as-\ntrocytes during both EAE (Pagenstecher et al., 1998) and\ntoxoplasma infection (Clark et al., 2011), and also limits T\ncell access to the CNS parenchyma. Astrocyte endfeet are\npart of the glia limitans and are adjacent to the parenchy-\nmal basement membrane, which is disrupted by MMPs (Toft-\nHansen et al., 2006). Thus, astrocytic secretion of TIMP-1\nmay directly inhibit MMP activity at the glia limitans be-\ncause of their close proximity. By contrast, during JHMV in-\nfection, TIMP-1 may have limited access to the enzymatic\nsite of MMPs and act in an autocrine fashion (Oelmann et al.,\nIn summary, our data demonstrate a novel MMP-\nindependent role of TIMP-1 in regulating CD4+ T cell migra-\ntion across the glia limitans during viral encephalitis. Whereas\nreduced CD4+ T cell access to the CNS parenchyma did not\naffect viral control, disease severity was reduced. Thus, tar-\ngeting TIMP-1 may represent a potential therapeutic target\nto reduce pathogenesis, without altering virus clearance, dur-\ning viral encephalomyelitis.\nCarine Savarin designed and performed the experiments, an-\nalyzed data and wrote the paper; Cornelia Bergmann and\nDavid Hinton analyzed data and wrote the paper; Stephen\nStohlman designed the research, interpreted data and wrote\nthe paper.\n"
