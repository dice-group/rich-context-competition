    "abstract": "Abstract\nWe describe the design and results of an experiment in using text-mining and machine-learning techniques to generate\nannual measures of national political regime types. Valid and reliable measures of countries' forms of national government\nare essential to cross-national and dynamic analysis of many phenomena of great interest to political scientists, including\ncivil war, interstate war, democratization, and coups d'\u00e9tat. Unfortunately, traditional measures of regime type are very\nexpensive to produce, and observations for ambiguous cases are often sharply contested. In this project, we train a\nseries of support vector machine (SVM) classifiers to infer regime type from textual data sources. To train the classifiers,\nwe used vectorized textual reports from Freedom House and the State Department as features for a training set of\nprelabeled regime type data. To validate our SVM classifiers, we compare their predictions in an out-of-sample context,\nand the performance results across a variety of metrics (accuracy, precision, recall) are very high. The results of this\nproject highlight the ability of these techniques to contribute to producing real-time data sources for use in political\nscience that can also be routinely updated at much lower cost than human-coded data. To this end, we set up a text-\nprocessing pipeline that pulls updated textual data from selected sources, conducts feature extraction, and applies\nsupervised machine learning methods to produce measures of regime type. This pipeline, written in Python, can be pulled\nfrom the Github repository associated with this project and easily extended as more data becomes available.\n",

In the past 25 years, the conceptualiza-\ntion and measurement of democracy has become a dominant\ntheme in the subfield of comparative politics, and recent\nwork on variations in forms of autocracy is growing in\nprominence as well. What is more, these debates over con-\ncepts and measures are not simply theoretical; they can\nhave significant effects on research that shapes policy and\nadvocacy as well. For example, myriad studies have shown\nthat national regime type shapes countries'propensity to go\nto war with each other or their own citizens (Hegre, 2014);\nwork by the Political Instability Task Force has shown\nregime type to be the single most-powerful predictor of\nonsets of national political crises such as civil wars, coups,\nand state collapse (Goldstone et al, 2010); and work by\nnumerous scholars suggests that the effects of events such\nas sanctions (Escrib\u00e1-Foch and Wright, 2010; Geddes,\nof authoritarian regime breakdown are conditional on for-\nmal and informal institutional features of those regimes.\nFrom a practical perspective, the measures of regime\ntype that are widely used today are expensive to produce.\nPolity IV is coded by hand, so the dataset's producers must\nspend many hours locating and reviewing relevant docu-\nments for upwards of 160 countries (Marshall and Jaggers,\n2002). Freedom House's Freedom in the World depends on\nrepeated surveys of a large number of subject-matter\nexperts. The newly launched Varieties of Democracy\nMining texts to efficiently generate global\ndata on political regime types\nShahryar Minhas1, Jay Ulfelder2 and Michael D Ward1\n Keywords\nDemocracy, autocracy, machine learning, methodology\n1Duke University, Durham, NC, USA\n2Independent consultant, Takoma Park, MD, USA\nCorresponding author:\nMichael Ward, Duke University, 140 Science Drive, 208 Gross Hall,\nEmail: michael.d.ward@duke.edu\nArticle\n2 Research and Politics \nproject, or V-Dem, does the same (Coppedge et al, 2013).\nOther widely cited datasets on national political regimes,\nincluding the Democracy and Dictatorship Dataset\n(Cheibub et al, 2010) and the Autocratic Regimes Dataset\n(Geddes et al, 2014), are not routinely updated, and the\nhigh cost of doing so appears to be one reason why. The\nUnified Democracy Scores (UDS) dataset thoughtfully\naddresses the problem of uncertainty about one crucial\nregime concept (the degree of democracy) (Pemstein\net al,2010), but it is derived from, and therefore wholly\ndependent on, the human-coded datasets that are so labor\nintensive to produce.\nThis paper introduces the use of supervised machine\nlearning in combination with natural language processing\ntechniques to generate measures of regime type, specifi-\ncally, binary measures for democracy, military rule, one-\nparty rule, and monarchy. By relying on texts that are\nroutinely produced and publicly available, we show that it\nis possible to train classifiers to predict measures of regime\ntype from labeled data at low cost and great frequency.\nTremendous growth in global reportage on democracy and\nhuman rights in the past 20 years has produced a massive\ncorpus of texts on these topics that is ripe for content analy-\nsis. Concurrent improvements in computer software and\nhardware have made the process of analyzing large bodies\nof text much more efficient, and the field has matured with\nthe development of a common set of methodologies with\nwell-tested characteristics.Automated coding is completely\ntransparent, so it avoids the unreproducible subjective ele-\nments of human coding. Once the source texts have been\nprepared, recoding to account for new theoretical or tech-\nnological components can be done relatively quickly and\nefficiently.\nLast but not least, innovations in methods for content\nanalysis are helping researchers use those tools to produce\nmore interesting and more useful results, including a num-\nber of applications to political texts. These approaches are\nincreasingly being used to generate political event data\net al, 2013) and to measure things such as political tensions\n(Chadefaux, 2014), partisan affiliation (Slapin and Proksch,\n2010). To the best of our knowledge, though, these tech-\nniques have not previously been applied to the task of\nmeasuring political regime types over time across many\ncountries.\nThe rest of the paper describes the pipeline through\nwhich we generate measures of regime type from text and\nthe results of our initial application of this process to his-\ntorical documents and data. We first discuss the texts that\nwe have used so far to train our classifiers. We then describe\nhow we generate numerical representations of these texts\nusing a vector space model. Finally, we discuss how we\nused those vector space representations in conjunction with\nexisting human-coded data on regime type to train support\nvector machines (SVMs) that can generate measures of\nregime type for years in which labeled data are not\navailable.\nTo highlight the feasibility of this approach in generat-\ning measures of regime type that are similar to extant meas-\nures, we apply this classification scheme to currently\nexisting data. Specifically, we divide up years for which\nextant measures of regime type are available into a training\nand test set. We then go through the process of training our\nSVMs using the labeled and textual data, and then predict-\ning labels for the test-set years. Our results demonstrate that\nthis strategy works. Our classifiers perform well out of\nsample, achieving high or very high precision and recall\nscores across the measures of regime type that we are inter-\nested in producing.\nTextual data\nThe first step in our pipeline is choosing textual data to\ntrain our classifiers. We select a corpus of familiar and\nwell-structured texts describing politics and human-rights\npractices each year in all countries worldwide: the Country\nReports on Human Rights Practices published by the US\nDepartment of State, and Freedom House's Freedom in the\nWorld reports. Both of these series of reports have struc-\ntures that are explicitly similar and use equivalent concepts\nand language to describe political practices in the referent\ncountries. Further, these reports are available for almost\n200 countries for both of these organizations, thus ena-\nbling us to produce classifications for a wide variety of\ncountries.\nAs the State Department notes on its website, its human\nrights reports \"cover internationally recognized individual,\ncivil, political, and worker rights, as set forth in the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights and other interna-\ntional agreements\". The annual production of State's human\nrights reports is mandated by law under the Foreign\nmember states and other countries receiving US assistance\nmust be covered.\nIn its Freedom in the World reports, the US-based\nnon-governmental organization Freedom House pro-\nvides summary descriptions of all countries of the world\nand some disputed territories. Per its website, these\ndescriptions are intended to capture the advance or\ndecline of \"freedom\" in each polity, where the idea of\nfreedom \"is grounded in basic standards of political\nrights and civil liberties, derived in large measure from\nrelevant portions of the Universal Declaration of Human\nRights\". Freedom House is a non-governmental advo-\ncacy group that receives a substantial share of its fund-\ning from the US Government.\nWe use State Department annual reports on countries'\nMinhas et al 3\nreports in the two series that are currently archived online\non the source organizations' websites.1 These reports are\nautomatically collected from the State Department and\nFreedom House websites, and, in the future, we can apply\nthe same collection methodology to add relevant texts from\nother sources into our system of generating measures of\nregime type.\nPreparing texts\nWith the textual data collected, we move towards generat-\ning a structured representation of these documents. We first\ncollate all documents associated with a particular country\u00ad\nyear. In our current implementation, this simply consists of\ncombining the State and Freedom House textual reports.\nFrom these collated documents, we move towards extract-\ning a set of features--in this case, words or phrases--that\nwe can use for classification.\nTo have a relevant set of features on which to do classi-\nfication, we first remove items that probably will not pro-\nvide any meaningful information on the regime type of\ncountries. This first involves some mainstream text pro-\ncessing techniques such as removing punctuation, stop\nwords (e.g. \"and\", \"just\", \"it\"), and numbers. We also\nremove all proper nouns and acronyms from the docu-\nments. Leaving proper nouns, such as the names of coun-\ntries, in the document could be problematic in that the\nclassification algorithm may assign regime type ratings\nbased on country names rather than meaningful content\nrelated to political rights and civil liberties. This may bias\npredictions for cases in which countries are moving away\nor towards a certain regime archetype, as the classifier may\nmiss out on predicting a change because the country name\nis a persistent feature within a document and unique across\nthe corpus of documents.\nAfter removing unnecessary items, we are still left with\nan extremely high number of features. Because the State\nand Freedom House reports are so long, the number of fea-\ntures for any given document in our corpus reaches into the\nhundred of thousands. In addition, for the purposes of clas-\nsification, we need to represent the full stack of country\u00ad\nyear documents and features using a vector space, or term\nvector, model. This can be thought of as a matrix in which\nthe rows are country\u00adyear documents and the columns are\npopulated with the features found in every document.\nStacking all of the documents in this way leads to the\ncreation of an extremely sparse and high-dimensional\nmatrix, which without further processing would contain a\npotentially unmanageable number of columns. Not only\nwould the number of columns in the matrix be prodigious,\nbut the features themselves would be repetitive, which\nmay adversely affect prediction. To deal with this problem,\nwe lemmatize each of the remaining features. Lemmatizing\nis a process through which inflectional endings are\nremoved and the canonical form of a word is returned. This\nprocess not only reduces the dimensionality of the feature\nset; it also better enables us to track similarities between\ndocuments.\nThe last preprocessing step involves filling in the cross-\nsections of our matrices. Here, we calculate the \"term-fre-\nquency, inverse document frequency\" (tf-idf) score for\neach feature in every document. This score generates a\nmeasure of the importance of features in a document based\non how frequently they appear across multiple documents.\nFor example, if a word appears frequently in a single docu-\nment, then it is important to that document, so it receives a\nhigh score. If a word appears in many documents, however,\nthen even though it may be important, it is not a unique\nidentifier, so it receives a lower score. Following this scor-\ning system, common words appearing in many documents\nwill be scaled down, and words that appear frequently in a\nsingle document will be scaled up.\nClassification\nUsing the processed textual data, our goal is to generate\nfour binary measures of regime type: (1) Democracy, (2)\nMilitary rule, (3) One-party rule, and (4) Monarchy. In\nprinciple, these categories are mutually exclusive. In prac-\ntice, however, regime type is inherently uncertain, and any\ngiven regime may exhibit features of more than one of\nthese ideal types at any time. Consistent with that idea, we\ndecide to treat each of these archetypes not as different sec-\ntions of a single plane but rather as distinct dimensions in a\nmulti-dimensional regime space, and therefore to train sep-\narate models for each category. Given the flexible nature of\nthe pipeline that we have established, other regime types\nfor which labeled data already exist could easily be incor-\nporated as well.\nWe opt to use a supervised learning method to classify\nregime type,2 and a supervised method requires labeled\ninput. To train our regime classification models, we use\npre-existing, human-coded data on national political\nregimes from a few widely used sources: Polity; Geddes\net al(2014 hereafter GWF); and Hadenius and Teorell\nour democracy model, we create a binary variable that\nequals one if a country's Polity rating is greater than or\nequal to seven. For our models of military rule, one-party\nrule, and monarchy, we code our binary indicators as one if\nboth GWF and HT identify a country\u00adyear as belonging to\nthat category and only that category and zero otherwise. In\nother words, we only consider a regime to be sufficiently\nrepresentative of each of those authoritarian archetypes if\nboth sources agree that it belongs in that category and only\nthat category. Conceptually, we want to learn from the\ncases of whose status we are confident, and then leave it to\nthe models to tell us how closely the more ambiguous cases\napproximate those archetypes.\n4 Research and Politics \nIn choosing an appropriate supervised learning algo-\nrithm, we need to take into consideration the structure of\nthe vector space model used to represent the textual data.\nEven with the feature-reduction steps described in the pre-\nvious section, the vector space representation of our textual\ndata is extremely sparse and high dimensional. This is\nproblematic, because the efficiency of many supervised\nlearning algorithms, such as neural networks, boosted trees,\nand random forests, tends to degrade with the dimensional-\nWe chose to use SVMs, which have been shown to be\nparticularly good at dealing with sparse, high-dimensional\ndata structures such as ours [D'Orazio et al, 2014; Joachims,\n1998).3 The goal of our SVMs here is to produce a model\nfrom labeled and processed textual data that we can then\napply to generate labels for country\u00adyear observations for\nwhich we do not have labels but do have processed textual\ndata. SVMs produce this model by finding the optimal\nhyperplane to separate the classes of the labeled data (e.g.\ndemocracy and not democracy). The optimal hyperplane is\ndefined as the one that leads to the maximum margin of\nseparation between the classes of the labeled data (Chang\nfound, documents on either side correspond to classes of\nthe binary dependent variable, and new documents can\nthen be classified according to which side of the hyper-\nplane they fall on.\nFigure 1 illustrates how a separating hyperplane may be\ndrawn in the case of two features and perfect separability.4\nThe two classes of points are designated by blue triangles\nand red circles. The goal of an SVM is to find the optimal\nseparating hyperplane between the two classes of points\nthat maximizes the margin between the classes' closest\npoints.\nIn this example, the optimal separating hyperplane is\ndesignated by the solid line and the margins the dashed line.\nThe points which fall on the boundaries are called support\nvectors. These are designated by darker shades of red and\nblue. Having found this hyperplane for a given set of fea-\ntures enables us then to easily classify new observations\nbased on their features. Using this process we can quickly\nand objectively classify country-year regime types for\nwhich labels do not already exist.\nResearch design\nTo highlight the feasibility and gauge the performance of\nthis classification approach, we split our sample of exist-\ning labeled data into training and test sets. For the democ-\nracy model, we have \"ground truth\" data from Polity\nthree authoritarian archetypes, we only have \"ground\ntruth\" data from GWF and HT through 2010, so we made\nThe vector space representations of our textual data are\nobtained from the Freedom House and State Department\nreports, and we process them using the steps described ear-\nlier. One additional step that is necessary to undertake\ninvolves determining whether the features represented in the\nvector space models should be composed of single words\n(unigrams) or phrases (n-grams). We tested a number of\nstrategies and found that the highest performance in classi-\nfying the party and military labels came from using uni-\ngrams; for monarchy, from n-grams that vary in range from\none to three; and for democracy, from n-grams that vary in\nrange from two to four.5\nResults\nThe heatmap in Figure 2 summarizes the performance of\nthe classifiers across our variables of interest in the\nout-of-sample test periods. The top two rows of this matrix\ndesignate the accuracy and F-1 scores for our classifiers.\nAccuracy provides a measure for the overall correctness of\nthe model and is calculated as the sum of correct classifica-\ntions divided by the total number of classifications. The\naccuracy statistic for each of our variables of interest is\ngreater than or equal to 98%.\nThe bottom two rows of this matrix designate the preci-\nsion and recall scores for our classifiers. For example, in\nthe case of our monarchy variable, the numerator for both\nprecision and recall is defined as the number of country\u00ad\nyears classified as a monarchy that were also coded as\nbeing a monarchy by GWF and HT. The denominator for\nthe precision metric is the total number of country\u00adyears\nclassified as having a monarchy, whereas the denominator\nfor recall is the total number of country\u00adyears labeled as\nmonarchy by GWF and HT. We achieve 100% precision on\nevery variable of interest except the democracy label, for\nwhich we still receive a score of 99%. In terms of recall, we\nagain receive scores of greater than 90% for each of the\nmetrics except our military label, for which our classifier\nreceives a score of 67%.\nFigure 1. SVM illustration.\nMinhas et al 5\nThe recall metric for the military label is lower because\nour SVM classifier differs from the GWF and HT codings\non the cases of Algeria, Pakistan, and Thailand. Figure 3\ndepicts the classifications received by these three countries\ndenotes the rating provided by GWF and HT, and the blue\ntriangle the prediction from the SVM. In the case of Algeria\nand Pakistan, the difference results from the SVM classify-\ning the countries as moving away from a militaristic regime\nbefore GWF/HT reached the same conclusion.\nFigure 4 highlights a number of the features that were\nused by the SVMs to classify country\u00adyears into our four\nmeasures of regime type. Blue words in each word cloud\nrepresent features that made it more likely for a country-\nyear to be classified into a regime type, while red words\nindicate features that made it less likely. The size of a word\ncorresponds to the relative importance of that feature in the\nmodel. As we would expect, phrases such as \"free fair elec-\ntion\" and \"right fair trial\" are associated with a greater like-\nlihood of a country being classified as a democracy, while\nfeatures such as \"royal\" and \"king\" increase the likelihood\nof a country being classified as a monarchy.\nThe results we have shown so far highlight that the predic-\ntions from our classifiers match well against how\nPrecision\nRecall\nAccuracy\nPolity>=7 Monarchy Party Military\nFigure 2.

These\nscores represent the signed distance of a particular country\u00ad\nyear observation from the hyperplane. Distances less than zero\ncorrespond to the cases in which the classifier designates an\nobservation as not belonging to a particular label, while scores\ngreater than zero indicate that the observation does belong to\nthat label. Figure 5 summarizes the out-of-sample confidence\nscore distributions for each of the four regime types. The score\ndistributions for the monarchy, party, and military regime\ntypes show that cases not falling into those labels seem to be a\nnoticeable distance away from the boundary of zero.\nFigure 6 shows variance in the SVM confidence scores for\nall four regime dimensions in 2009. On the whole, cases fall\nout as we would expect them to. For example, the democracy\nclassifier: confidently identifies Western Europe, Canada,\nAustralia, and New Zealand as democracies; shows interest-\ning variations in Eastern Europe, Latin America, and South\nAsia; and confidently identifies nearly all of the rest of the\nworld as non-democracies. Meanwhile, the monarchy model\ncorrectly identifies most of the countries of the Arabian\nPeninsula, Jordan, and Morocco as monarchies and the rest of\nthe world as not. The military rule classifier sees Myanmar,\nPakistan, and Algeria as likely cases in 2010 and is less cer-\ntain about the absence of military rule in several WestAfrican\nand Middle Eastern countries than in the rest of the world.\nLast, the map of results from the one-party rule classifier cor-\nrectly identifies countries such as China, Laos, Vietnam,\nTurkmenistan, and Uzbekistan as instances of one-party rule\nbut mistakenly excludes North Korea from this list in 2009.6\nConclusion\nThe results described here demonstrate that it is possible to\ngenerate measures of political regime type from publicly\navailable texts at low cost. Our initial application using fea-\ntures derived from a small corpus produced out-of-sample\nestimates that closely match observed data on several very\ndifferent regime types. These codings have been made\navailable at the author's dataverse (https://dataverse.har\nDVN/8MC1LO) and can be extended as additional textual\ndata becomes available using the pipeline on Github\n(https://github.com/hermes829/regimeClassif).\nMinhas et al 7\nAlthough the out-of-sample classification accuracy of\nour models is very good, we feel that we can improve this\noutput by incorporating a larger sample of texts. The State\nDepartment and Freedom House texts used so far cover a\nnarrow set of human-rights practices and political proce-\ndures. These practices and procedures are all fundamental\nto how we conceive of and observe political regime type,\nbut they are not the only essential characteristics of regime\ntype.\nIn future iterations, we plan to expand the corpus to\ninclude annual or occasional reports that discuss a broader\nrange of features in each country's national politics.\nPolity>=7 Monarchy\nParty Military\nSVM Confidence Score\nProportion\nFigure 5.
