Once rare,\ncohabitation had become a normal part of adult union formation and was rapidly\nspreading to families with children (Bumpass and Lu 2000). By 1995, nearly two-fifths\nof all children could expect to experience maternal cohabitation during childhood\n(Bumpass and Lu 2000). Cohabitation has maintained this rapid pace of expansion\nthrough the present (Chandra, Martinez, Mosher, Abma, and Jones 2005; Fitch,\nAs cohabitation continues to transform American families, existing statistics on the\nprevalence of cohabiting families have become outdated. In the current study, we use\nthe 1995 and 2002 waves (Cycles V and VI) of the National Survey of Family Growth\nto replicate and update Bumpass and Lu's 2000 article on trends in U.S. cohabitation.\nThis paper, thus, increases our knowledge of the prevalence of U.S. cohabitation from\nthe perspective of both adults and children. It examines the links between key family\ncharacteristics and cohabitation, and between cohabitation and subsequent marriage.\nBecause of extensive missing data on marital separation dates in the 2002 NSFG, we\ncan make only a limited exploration of whether the overall stability of children's family\nlives has changed as cohabitation became further established in American family life;\nlikewise, we are unable to update Bumpass and Lu's estimates of the time children\nspend in a single-mother family. Overall, our analyses demonstrate that cohabitation\ncontinues to grow unabated from the perspective of both adults and children.\n2. Background\nSince the 1970s, the rise in cohabitation had dramatically changed the way Americans\n44 had ever lived with an unmarried partner (Bumpass and Lu 2000). A majority of\nwomen first forming partnerships cohabited instead of marrying directly; likewise, a\nmajority of first marriages followed cohabitation. U.S. cohabiting unions formed in the\nearly 1990s were typically transient, as cohabiting couples rapidly married or separated\n(Bumpass and Lu 2000). Always a short-lived state, cohabitation became less stable and\nless tied to marriage as it spread; just over half of all cohabiting couples married within\n10 years (Bumpass and Lu 2000). Cohabitation has since expanded to half of all women\nThe increase in nonmarital cohabitation had important implications for families\nwith children (Bumpass and Lu 2000; Seltzer 2004). The proportion of children born to\nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 47\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 1665\nchildbearing achieved parity with out-of-union childbearing (Bumpass and Lu 2000;\nMincieli et al. 2007). More commonly, children experienced their mother's cohabitation\nafter birth, when she entered a new cohabiting relationship (Bumpass and Lu 2000).\nCombining all types of cohabiting families with children, about 35-40 percent of U.S.\nchildren were expected to live with their mother and a cohabiting partner in the early\nDespite spreading widely, cohabitation lacks a clearly defined and commonly\nunderstood position in the U.S. family system (Cherlin 2004; Manning and Smock\n2005). Cohabitation can be a stage in the marriage process for some couples, a\ntemporary alternative to marriage, or an alternative to being single for others (Smock\n2000). In some instances, cohabiting childbearing may be jointly planned with marriage\n(Musick 2007; Wu and Musick Forthcoming). More commonly, cohabitation enables\ncouples to enter into parenthood or to jointly parent children, without first overcoming\nbarriers to marriage, including economic stability and relationship quality (Edin and\nReed 2005; Smock, Manning, and Porter 2005). In doing so, cohabitation temporarily\nassumes traditional functions of marriage. Furthermore, the role that cohabitation plays\nin the family varies by education, income, and race and ethnicity. For instance, college-\neducated women are the least likely to ever-cohabit (Bumpass and Lu 2000), while\nHispanic cohabitation is uniquely linked to reproduction (Landale and Oropesa 2007).\nF\nF\nThe rapid growth in cohabiting families with children has raised concerns over the\npotential consequences for child well-being. Children raised by a cohabiting parent\nappear to have poorer outcomes than the children of married parents, across a range of\nindicators, including academic performance, emotional problems and depression, and\nA number of factors make U.S. cohabiting unions potentially disadvantageous\nenvironments for raising children, including lower incomes, lower relationship quality,\nand higher dissolution rates than marriages (Cavanagh and Huston 2006; Graefe and\nOsborne and McLanahan 2007; Raley and Wildsmith 2004). Many of these differences\npredate union formation, and thus reflect the disproportionate selection of couples with\nthe least resources and the lowest expectations for relationship stability into cohabiting\nrelationships and cohabiting parenthood (Kenney and McLanahan 2006; Lillard, Brien,\nand Waite 1995). Yet, cohabitation and marriage differ in fundamental ways that may\nhave implications for child well-being, not least the enforceable public and legal\n3 Smock (2000) provides a comprehensive overview of these differences. See also Lichter et al. (2006),\nKennedy & Bumpass: Cohabitation and children's living arrangements\n1666 http://www.demographic-research.org\ncommitment required of married couples that makes marriages more difficult to\nData limitations prevent us from directly addressing the question of whether\nchildren's family lives have grown increasingly unstable as a consequence of rising\ncohabitation rates. By charting trends in the prevalence and stability of cohabitation,\nhowever, we will make a limited exploration of the implications of the continued\nincrease in cohabitation for children's family contexts.\n3. Data and methods\nbirth histories, as well as cohabitation and marriage histories. The 2002 NSFG is the\nmost recent and comprehensive data source on U.S. families and allows us to study the\nrecent cohabitation experiences of women and their children.\nThere is one very serious limitation of the 2002 NSFG: as a result of routing errors\nin the survey instrument, marriage dissolution data are missing for over one-third of all\nmarriages that subsequently dissolved. Data are missing entirely for women whose\nhusbands had children from a previous relationship and for over 90 percent of currently\nseparated respondents. Black and Hispanic women and women who cohabited before\nmarriage have particularly high rates of missing data. Time periods closer to 2002 have\nespecially high rates of missing data because women who are currently separated were\nmore likely to have dissolved their marriages recently.\nConsequently, analyses which must incorporate dates of marital dissolution are\nvery likely not defensible. Because separation dates are almost entirely missing for two\ndistinct respondent groups, standard imputation techniques may be inappropriate. In\naddition, if trends in family formation and dissolution have changed over time, using\nimputed marital dissolution data may underestimate the magnitude of any recent\nchanges. Because of these limitations, our analyses of children's family instability are\nexploratory and do not rely on the imputed dates of marital separation.\nDespite these limitations, the NSFG remains the best data set available for\nstudying recent trends in cohabitation from the perspective of women and children.\nF\n4 Commonly used alternatives for studying cohabitation include the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth\n1979, the Fragile Families Study, and the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (for recent studies, see: Lichter\nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 47\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 1667\nThis paper follows the approach used in Bumpass and Lu (2000) to produce new\nestimates of the cohabitation experience of women and children and to describe\nchildren's family structures at birth and later family transitions. We replicate their\napproach will differ in some instances due to differences between the data sets,\nincluding missing data and smaller sample sizes. The 1995 estimates presented here are\nvery similar but not always identical to those published by Bumpass and Lu (2000). All\nestimates are weighted, including regressions.\nAs noted above (see 3.1), we are reluctant to produce estimates that require\ninformation on the timing of marital dissolution. Specifically, because we do not know\nwhen a marriage ended with certainty, we cannot assign a separation to a particular\nperiod, nor can we calculate a child's total exposure to the risk of marital dissolution.\nConsequently, estimates of the proportion of children who experience parental\nseparation, of period trends in family instability, or of the duration of time a child born\nto a married mother spends in a single-parent household cannot be produced with\nconfidence. Instead, we produce estimates of the proportion of children ever\nexperiencing family dissolution by specific ages for recent birth cohorts. We restrict our\nestimates to children 10 years and younger in order to capture recent experiences (with\nlittle overlap between surveys) and to minimize the potential impact of age-censoring\n(discussed below).\nA second analytic challenge results from the upper age limit of 44 imposed on the\nfemale sample. This age limit creates no problem for analyses of women's current\nunion status or past cohabitation experience, estimates that can be compared across\nsurveys within age at interview groups. At periods distant from the survey, however, it\nbecomes increasingly difficult to accurately represent family experiences, as older\nrespondent ages are observed only in recent time periods. To the extent we use data\nfrom older children, or from periods further back in time, the data are progressively\nrepresentative only of unusually young mothers, those who were most likely to have\ngiven birth outside of marriage.\nF\nF\nFor a more detailed discussion of age-censoring, see\nFollowing Bumpass and Lu, we address age-censoring by calculating period life\ntables for the 5-year periods prior to the each survey. Exposure begins at the beginning\ncannot produce period estimates of women's cohabitation experience or children's living arrangements at\nolder child and teenage ages. The cross-sectional Study of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) provides\nrecent divorce data but does not collect detailed cohabitation histories.\n5 The mother of a 15-year old child in the 2002 NSFG could be at most 29 years old at the time of the child's\nbirth. In fact, the median mother's age for children in this age-group in the NSFG was just 23, substantially\nless than the contemporary national average of 26 years (Mathews and Hamilton 2002).\nKennedy & Bumpass: Cohabitation and children's living arrangements\n1668 http://www.demographic-research.org\nof the period or at a child's birth, if it occurs during the period. Exposure ends at the\nend of the period, at the time of the event, when a child turns 12 in the 5-year period, or\na female respondent turns 40. Life table methodology follows the procedures described\nin Bumpass and Lu (2000), with one exception. Because of the smaller 2002 sample,\nthe number of cases available to estimate children's cohabitation experience at older\nages was significantly reduced. In order to minimize the possibility of a small number\nof children influencing our overall estimates, we report estimates for children's\ncohabitation experience only through age 12 instead of age 16. See Bumpass (1984) and\nAndersson and Philipov (2002) for further discussion of this methodology.\nFinally, we should note that a child's family history is constructed using mother's\npartnership histories and information on each child's birth. For the analysis of\nchildren's cohabitation and living arrangements, we create an analysis file with children\nas the unit of analysis. Our estimation procedures make the simplifying assumption that\neach child resides with his or her mother throughout childhood. In doing so, we\nmisrepresent the experience of children who live with their father or other relatives\nduring childhood. Earlier studies have repeatedly demonstrated the robustness of this\n3.3 Sample composition and coverage\nTable 1 compares the background characteristics of the NSFG V and NSFG VI (female)\nsamples--here, as elsewhere, the estimates are weighted (see 3.2). The period between\nthe two surveys was one of rapid growth in the Hispanic population (Chapa and De La\nRosa 2004), a population with unique family patterns (Landale and Oropesa 2007).\nAccordingly, the weighted proportion of Hispanics among NSFG respondents rose\nsubstantially, from 11 percent to 15 percent, while the proportion of non-Hispanic\nwhites declined to 66 percent. By 2002, over half of Hispanic respondents were foreign-\nborn. In addition, the coverage of Hispanic and foreign-born populations may have\nchanged between NSFG cycles. The 1995 NSFG sample was drawn from the\nrespondent pool of an existing survey, the 1993 National Health Interview Survey\n(Mosher 1998). Immigrants to the U.S. arriving after 1993 were not interviewed. In\ncontrast, the 2002 NSFG includes immigrant women who arrived as recently as 2002\nand Hispanic respondents were oversampled.\nF\nF\nIt is unclear what impact, if any, these\ncoverage differences have on our estimates of Hispanic cohabitation and nonmarital\nfertility. We attempt to minimize the impact by distinguishing between foreign-born\n6 Response rates for Hispanics were as high or higher than those of non-Hispanic whites in both surveys\nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 47\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 1669\nand U.S.-born Hispanics. When possible, we compare our results with alternative\nsources, including vital statistics, in order to identify any potential discrepancies.\nUnfortunately, sample sizes do not allow us to analyze important national-origin\ndifferences in Hispanic family structure (Landale and Oropesa 2007).\nTable 1: Background characteristics: US women ages 19-44 and mothers of\nrecent births\nFemale Respondents Children born during the\nperiods\n% % % %\nEducational attainment\nRace/ethnicity\nHispanic nativity\nMother's age at birth\nThe educational composition of the sample also changed substantially between the\ntwo surveys. The proportion of women with a high school degree or GED decreased\nfrom 38% to 29%, while the college-educated population increased. Although the\nproportion of the sample with less 12 years of schooling remained stable, at 11-12\npercent, the proportion who were Hispanic increased to 42% by 2002, replacing non-\nHispanic whites as the largest ethnic group within this education level.\nTable 1 also presents mother's background characteristics for children born during\nKennedy & Bumpass: Cohabitation and children's living arrangements\n1670 http://www.demographic-research.org\nare similar to the trends described above. In addition, teenage childbearing declined,\naccompanied by an increase in childbearing at older ages.\n4. Findings\n4.1 Women's union formation\nThe continued rapid expansion of cohabitation is demonstrated in Figure 1 and Table 2\nusing two measures: women's lifetime cohabitation experience and current cohabitation\nstatus. The percentage of women ages 19-44 who have ever cohabited increased\n10 percentage points are observed at all ages except the youngest, ages 19-24, where\ncohabitation experience increased only slightly.\nFigure 1: Trends by age in the percentage ever cohabiting:\nAge at interview\nPercent ever-cohabited\nCurrent cohabitation also increased, from 17 to 19 percent among all unmarried\nwomen, and from 15 to 20 percent among never-married women. Increases for never-\nmarried women were particularly large in key premarital age groups (under age 30). In\ncontrast, current cohabitation appeared to decline among previously married\nrespondents. Due to small sample sizes and missing data on marital separation, we are\nnot confident of this result and do not see any ready explanation for it. We do note that\nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 47\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 1671\npremarital cohabitation increased between the two surveys for these previously married\nrespondents.\nTable 2: Trends by age in the percentage ever cohabiting and currently\nPercentage currently cohabiting of not currently married\n% ever cohabited\nTotal unmarried Never married\nPreviously\nmarried\n% cohabiting, of\ncurrent unions\nThe final columns of Table 2 present the proportion of current unions (at the time\nof interview) that were cohabiting rather than married, and here we see a modest\nincrease to 15 percent by 2002. The increase was very large among the youngest\nwomen (19-24): from 30 to 43 percent. This suggests that cohabitation continues to\nfacilitate delays in marriage. In results not shown in a table, we find that the overall\nproportion ever in a union declined by only one percent between 1995 and 2002, while\nthe proportion ever-married declined by 6 percent. As we would expect, this pattern is\nconcentrated in the youngest age category where the proportion ever in a union was\nunchanged, but the proportion ever having married declined by 15 percent (from 28 to\nTable 3 presents the percentage of women who have ever cohabited by educational\nattainment and race and ethnicity. Cohabitation experience increased at all education\nlevels between the two time periods, but large educational differentials persist. The\nproportion that had ever cohabited increased at least 20 percent among women who had\ncompleted high school (or more) and just over 10 percent among those who had not. By\n2002, the major difference is found between women who had not attended college and\nthose who had (almost two-thirds and one-half, respectively, had ever cohabited). In\ncontrast, differences by race and ethnicity remained relatively small. Non-Hispanic\nwhites, the group most likely to have cohabited by 1995, show the smallest change in\ncohabitation experience between the two surveys, about 15 percent. Cohabitation\nKennedy & Bumpass: Cohabitation and children's living arrangements\n1672 http://www.demographic-research.org\nexperience appears to have increased most rapidly among foreign-born Hispanics, from\none-third in 1995 to one-half of all respondents in 2002. It is hard to interpret this\nfinding, however, because it is likely influenced by the higher proportion of recent\nimmigrants among the foreign born in the 2002 survey (see 3.3).\nTable 3: Percentage of women ages 19-44 who have ever cohabited and\nPercent ever cohabited\nEducation\nRace/ethnicity\nHispanic nativity\nThe measures discussed so far reflect both recent trends and past experiences. We\ncan better observe recent changes by examining the first union formation during the 5\nyears before each survey (see Table 4). Cohabitation has become even more prevalent\nas the context of first union formation--68 percent of all first unions formed during the\nin the early 1990s. Looking at first marriage cohorts, the proportion who cohabited\npercent during the early 1990s. Of these women, a large majority had cohabited only\nwith their husband.\nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 47\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 1673\nTable 4: Percentage of first unions that were cohabitation, by marriage and\nunion cohort, and percentage of women in the US aged 19-44 who\ncohabited before first marriage\nFirst union cohort First marriage cohort\nFirst union was cohabitation 60 68 -- --\nCohab w/others only -- -- 4 4\n4.2 Union transitions\nPrevious studies have shown that cohabiting is a short-term state in the U.S. as\nconsensual unions either rapidly dissolve or transition to formal marriage (Bumpass and\nstudies, we use multiple decrement life table techniques to examine the pathways out of\nwomen's cohabiting unions during the 5-year periods prior to each NSFG wave\nThe results presented in Table 5 focus on first cohabiting unions, and analyze only\nthose unions formed prior to first marriage.\nF\nF\nBased on the rates observed during the\nseparate within the first two years following union formation. This represents a large\nincrease in the duration of cohabitation over the early 1990s, where more than two-\nthirds married or separated within 24 months. The proportion of unions that would be\nexpected to remain as unmarried cohabitation increased substantially at every duration.\nBy the late 1990s, the observed survival rates suggest that nearly 70% of couples in\ncohabiting unions will continue to cohabit for at least one year, one-third of couples for\nat least three years, and one-fifth for four-years.\n7 Analysis of all cohabiting unions yielded similar trends.\nKennedy & Bumpass: Cohabitation and children's living arrangements\n1674 http://www.demographic-research.org\nTable 5: Life table estimates of the outcomes of U.S. women's first cohabiting\nunions, by duration\n% cohabiting unions ending through\nDuration % still cohabiting marriage dissolution\nInitially, the estimated percentage increases in intact cohabiting unions are\naccompanied by declines in the proportion of unions expected to result in marriage (5-8\npercentage points at durations 1-4 years). By year 5, however, the survival rates in both\ntime periods imply that about half of all cohabiting couples will have married. Thus, the\ninitial decline in the proportion married appears to be largely the result of prolonged\ncohabitation and delayed marriage.\nThe lengthening of cohabitation occurred universally across race and ethnic groups\n(results not shown). Compositional changes also contributed to the overall increase, as\nthe cohabiting unions of Hispanic women survive longer, on average, than unions\nformed by non-Hispanic white and Black women. Rates from the late 1990s suggest a\nmedian union survival of more than two years for Hispanic women compared to about\none and a half years for non-Hispanic white women. This finding is consistent with\nresearch characterizing Hispanic cohabitation as a temporary substitute for marriage,\nand may reflect both higher cohabiting fertility rates and the longer duration of\nHispanic cohabiting unions with children (Landale and Oropesa 2007; Manning 2004;\nSmock 2000; Wildsmith and Raley 2006). Note, however, that the large majority of\nHispanic cohabiting unions still transition to marriage or dissolve within five years, and\nthus for most couples cohabitation is a temporary state.\nDuring the short period of time that elapsed between the two surveys, the extent\nand nature of cohabitation continued to evolve. Dissolution rates while cohabiting went\ndown substantially while marriage within 5 years declined only slightly. The trends\nobserved previously by Bumpass and Lu (2000)--of increasing instability while\ncohabiting, and declining marriage from cohabitation--were consistent with a\nmovement of less committed couples into cohabitation as the associated stigma\nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 47\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 1675\nweakened (Bumpass and Lu 2000). The meaning of these new trends is less clear. The\nprolonged duration of cohabitation may reflect longer engagements to marry as the\nsocial pressure to marry loosens and, perhaps, increased economic insecurity.\nIrrespective of marriage intentions, longer spells of cohabitation may also be associated\nwith increasing fertility in cohabiting unions, and perhaps greater public acceptance of\nbirths to unmarried mothers. Whatever the specific reasons for these changes, the\nincrease in unmarried couples living together and the longer duration of these\narrangements may signal a shift in the meaning of cohabitation for some couples. The\nimpact on the stability of marriages formed following cohabitation cannot be measured\nwith these data because we cannot measure how long these unions ultimately lasted.\n4.3 Children's family contexts at birth\nWe now turn to the implications of the increase in cohabitation for children's family\ncontexts, beginning with the mother's marital or cohabiting status at a child's birth. As\nit has for many decades, nonmarital childbearing increased throughout the 1990s. Of\nestimate of nonmarital fertility in the later period is similar to vital statistics for 1999\n(33%), the earlier period estimate is substantially lower than vital statistics in 1992\n(30%) (Ventura and Bachrach 2000). Although vital statistics data provide an important\ncomparison point to the survey estimates, they may differ for reasons including the\nimputation of marital status at birth when not collected on birth certificates and the\ntreatment of legally separated parents (Wu 2008). Note also that both vital statistics\nestimates and survey estimates of nonmarital fertility can be influenced by the stigma\nassociated with nonmarital births (Wu, Bumpass, and Musick 2001).\nKennedy & Bumpass: Cohabitation and children's living arrangements\n1676 http://www.demographic-research.org\nAssign to\nmarriage\nAssign to single\naPoint estimates are calculated using imputed values for date of marital separation\nbIn 2002, because of the large amount of missing marital separation dates, parent's marital status at birth could not be determined\nwith certainty for 5% of children in 2002. Bounds were created by assuming 1) that all of these children were born to married\nparents, and 2) that all were born after the marriage dissolved.\nAs in the prior decade (Bumpass and Lu 2000), the growth in unmarried births was\ndriven by a shift from married to cohabiting childbearing. By the period 1997-2001,\nhalf of all nonmarital births were to cohabiting parents. Two recent studies also find\nthis: a Child Trends study that uses the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study's 2001\nbirth cohort (Mincieli et al. 2007) and the Fragile Families study of children born\nF\nF\ncohabiting parents, a finding replicated by Child Trends (Mincieli et al. 2007).\nThe results just discussed and presented in the left-hand side panel of Table 6 are\ncalculated using imputed values of parent marital status at birth when it could not be\ndirectly observed from union histories. As we noted in our discussion of the data, an\nunacceptably large number of respondents had missing values for marital dissolution\ndates. If a child was born after the start of one of the affected marriages, it was\nimpossible to know definitively whether the birth occurred during the marriage. (138\nbirths during 1990-94). We can, however, evaluate the degree of uncertainty this\nestimates published by the CDC using NSFG (Chandra et al. 2005). This discrepancy appears to result from a\ncoding error on a variable included in the public release file of the NSFG VI data set (RMAROUT6). Nearly\n20% of all cohabiting births in the NSFG were miscoded as unmarried non-cohabiting births. All were born to\ncohabiting parents who subsequently married. In most instances, first births within cohabiting unions were\ncoded correctly, while second births and higher order births were not.\nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 47\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 1677\nidentifying the 5 percent of births whose classification is affected and making two\nextreme assumptions about the circumstances at their birth: 1) all of these births\noccurred while their mother was still married; and 2) all occurred when she was no\nlonger married.\nThe bounds resulting from these assumptions are shown in the right-hand panel of\nTable 6. Cohabiting births are unchanged. Our estimate of unmarried non-cohabiting\nbirths ranges from 14 to 17 percent, while the estimate for marital births ranges from 68\nto 65 percent. Our overall conclusions are unchanged--nonmarital childbearing has\nincreased between the two periods, and this change is mostly, if not entirely, the result\nof a shift from childbearing in marriage to childbearing in cohabitation.\nTable 7 presents educational and race differences in children's family structure at\nbirth. The proportion of children born to unmarried parents continues to vary greatly by\nsocioeconomic status and race and ethnicity. Educational differences, already large in\nmothers without high school degrees (an increasingly selective group), 61% were born\nto an unmarried mother, including one-third born to cohabiting parents.\nF\nF\nFor women\nwith a high school degree, married births fell to just 57% of all births by the late 1990s,\nwhile cohabiting childbearing grew to nearly one-quarter. Women who attended some\ncollege continued to give birth primarily within marriage, but cohabiting childbearing\nalso increased noticeably, reaching 15%. Nonmarital childbearing changed only slightly\nfor four-year college graduates, among whom it remains very low at 7% of all births.\nDespite the persistence of large educational differences, sizable increases in cohabiting\nchildbearing are found for all women except the most highly educated.\nRace and ethnic differences also remained substantial, but with two potentially\nsignificant trends. There was little net change in unmarried childbearing among both\nnon-Hispanic whites and blacks (a 3 percent increase and decrease, respectively), with\ndifferences remaining very large (21 percent compared to 68 percent of all births). The\nslight increase in marital childbearing among African-Americans, to 32 percent, may\nsignal an important departure from the long-term increases in nonmarital\nchildbearing.\nF\nF\nAlso important, is that cohabiting births increased from 17 to 27 percent\nof all births to non-Hispanic blacks. Consequently, a majority of African-American\nchildren born in the late 1990s were born into a two-parent family.\n9 Compositional changes may partly explain the overall increase; specifically the increasing proportion of\nHispanic women among women without a high school degree combined with increases in cohabiting\nchildbearing among Hispanic women.\n10 Vital statistics records a nearly identical decline: peaking at 71% in 1994 and falling to 69% by the late\nKennedy & Bumpass: Cohabitation and children's living arrangements\n1678 http://www.demographic-research.org\nTable 7: Percentage of births to unmarried mothers and cohabiting mothers,\nand proportion of unmarried births to cohabiting mothers: for U.S.\nBirths to unmarried mothers\nVariable\nTotal\nunmarried\nSingle Cohabiting Cohabiting/ unmarried n\nEducation\nRace/ethnicity\nNon-Hispanic\nWhite\nHispanic nativity\nForeign-born\nHispanic\nUS-born\nHispanic\nMother's age at\nbirth\nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 47\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 1679\nTable 7: (continued)\nBirths to unmarried mothers\nVariable Total unmarried Single Cohabiting Cohabiting/ unmarried n\nEducation\nRace/ethnicity\nNon-Hispanic\nWhite\nHispanic nativity\nForeign-born\nHispanic\nUS-born\nHispanic\nMother's age at\nbirth\nAlthough the largest changes appear to occur among Hispanic families, our\nestimates based on the NSFG overstate the trends observed in Vital Statistics for the\nsame period. Taking all Hispanic women together, NSFG estimates of nonmarital\n(Table 7), and almost all of this increase appears to have occurred in cohabitation. In\ncontrast, Ventura and Bachrach (2000) estimate that Hispanic nonmarital fertility\nF\nF\n11 The earlier estimate of Hispanic nonmarital fertility in vital statistics is based on imputation in instances\nwhere parent's marital status was not collected on the birth certificates. Prior to 1995, in California, parent's\nmarital status was inferred using a procedure that substantially under-identified Hispanic marriages. In 1995,\nKennedy & Bumpass: Cohabitation and children's living arrangements\n1680 http://www.demographic-research.org\nHispanic nonmarital fertility appear to be overestimated in the 2002 NSFG, the Vital\nStatistics series confirm that there is a substantial upwards trend in nonmarital\nchildbearing among Hispanic women.\nFinally, Table 7 presents estimates of births to unmarried mothers by mother's age\nat birth. Strikingly, more than half of births to women under age 25 now occur to\nunmarried mothers. By 2002, a majority of unmarried mothers ages 20 and older\nreported cohabiting at the time of their child's birth, and only unmarried teenage\nmothers gave birth predominantly without a partner. Regardless of mother's age,\nnonmarital childbearing increasingly occurred in coresidential unions.\n4.4 Children's family transitions\nDespite the increase in cohabiting births, children most commonly experienced mother's\ncohabitation during later family transitions, after birth to a single mother or the\nseparation of birth parents. Table 8 presents life table estimates of the proportion of\nchildren expected to live with their mother and a cohabiting partner during the periods\nthose born to a married mother.\nOverall, the proportion of these children expected to enter cohabiting families by\nage 12 increased from 21 percent to 25 percent based on rates observed in the early and\nlate 1990s. For children born to single non-cohabiting mothers, the likelihood of\ncohabitation increased substantially, from 56 to 63 percent by age 12. Among children\nborn to married mothers in both periods, about 15 percent are expected to enter a\ncohabiting family by age 12--after their mother's marriage disrupts. Overall, if we\ncombine these estimates with births to cohabiting parents, about 39 percent of children\nwould be expected to experience any maternal cohabitation before age 12 based on\nwhen marital status was explicitly collected, vital statistics estimates of the percentage of births to unmarried\nadded a direct question on marital status to the birth certificate, doubling the estimated number of nonmarital\nbirths in Texas.\nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 47\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 1681\nTable 8: Proportion of children experiencing mother's cohabitation and\nmother's marriage.\nPeriod life-table estimates, U.S. children ages 0-12\nA. Mother's cohabitation by age 12, children born to non-cohabiting mothers\nB. Mother's marriage by age 12, children born to unmarried mothers\nBecause of the smaller 2002 NSFG sample, these estimates are limited to\nF\nF\nWith reasonable assumptions about the shape of the\nhazard distributions, however, we can calculate the ratio of the proportion by 16 to the\nproportion by age 12 as estimated from the 1995 survey, and apply this to the age 12\nestimates from the 2002 survey. The results of this procedure suggest that the\nproportion of children expected to ever experience a cohabiting family increased from\nUnited States can be expected to spend some time with a cohabiting mother.\nTo better understand transitions into cohabiting families, we estimate a pooled\nproportional hazard model for children born to non-cohabiting mothers who were at risk\nwith robust standard errors controlling for the clustering of children in families, are\nshown in Table 9. To illustrate the magnitude of any differences, we provide life table\nestimates of the proportion of children expected to transition into cohabiting families by\nstatus at birth, education, race, and mother's age at birth). It is important to keep in\nmind that this column (Table 9, Column 4) and the matching life table estimates for\nmarriage (Table 9, Column 8) are predicted values without controls for any other\nvariables in the table.\n12 Bumpass and Lu (2000) report estimates through age 16. We restrict estimates to age 12 because sample\nsize reductions in 2002 resulted in insufficient sample sizes at older child ages.\nKennedy & Bumpass: Cohabitation and children's living arrangements\n1682 http://www.demographic-research.org\nTable 9: Relative risk of mother's cohabitation and mother's marriage for\nchildren by mother's characteristics.

One contributing factor\nwas declining marital childbearing, a trend that exposed a higher proportion (but not\nnecessarily number) of children to the higher cohabitation rates of unmarried mothers.\nIn the simple life table estimates in column 4, we see a pronounced decline from\nhigh-school graduates to college graduates in the proportion of these children expected\nto experience cohabitation by age 12. However, controlling for background\ncharacteristics (column 1), only children of college graduates differ from the other\neducational categories, and their risk is 40% lower than the children of high school\ndropouts.\nControlling for mother's marital status, education, and age at a child's birth, non-\nHispanic white children have the highest transition rates into cohabiting families (the\nrisk is about a quarter lower among the others). In contrast, the unadjusted life table\nestimates show that black children are the most likely to enter cohabiting households.\nThese seemingly contradictory findings, observed previously by Bumpass and Lu\n(2000), are the result of the high rates of out-of-union childbearing among African-\nAmerican mothers, and the consequently higher risk of entering a cohabiting family.\nThis was confirmed by eliminating the control for marital status from the hazard; the\ncoefficient for African-American children became positive and significant in this model\n(not shown). Nearly half of non-Hispanic Black children born to single or married\nmothers are expected to experience maternal cohabitation by age 12 (column 4 of Table\nMother's age at birth is very strongly and negatively associated with children's\nexperience of maternal cohabitation; controlling for all other variables the risk\ndecreases by about two-thirds if a mother is age 25 or older at birth. Among other\nfactors, this may reflect the greater stability of the marriages formed by older women,\nless interest in having a husband or partner, or the reduced availability of suitable\npartners at older ages.\n4.4.2 Marriage following birth to an unmarried mother\nTable 9 also presents multivariate hazard and unadjusted life table estimates predicting\ntransitions into married families for children born to unmarried mothers. Overall, the\nrisk of mother's marriage for these children remained unchanged between the two\nperiods, controlling for partnership status at birth, education, race, and mother's age at\nbirth. Our unadjusted life table estimates also showed little change in marriage risks.\nChildren born into a cohabiting union were 90 percent more likely to enter married\nfamilies than the children of single mothers. Even so, about 45 percent of the non-union\nKennedy & Bumpass: Cohabitation and children's living arrangements\n1684 http://www.demographic-research.org\nbirths could expect their mother to marry by age 12 under the transition rates observed\nin the late 1990s (compared to 66 percent of cohabiting births).\nThe likelihood of marriage increases greatly with mother's education--for\ninstance, 74% of children of 4-year college graduates can expect their mother to marry,\ncompared to 40% of the children of high school dropouts (and the differences are\nmonotonic in the hazard model). About 40 percent of black children born to unmarried\nmothers will experience their mother's marriage by age 12, compared to two-thirds of\nnon-Hispanic white children, and half of Hispanic children. These differences persist in\nthe hazard models even after controlling for cohabitation status at birth.\nFinally, children born to younger mothers are significantly more likely to\nexperience their mother's marriage than children born to older mothers. The children of\nolder mothers also experience less maternal cohabitation, so this may reflect the limited\npartnership markets available to older women. Since unmarried motherhood remains\nuncommon among women ages 25 and older (Table 7), low rates of marriage may also\nreflect the selectivity of older unmarried mothers.\n4.4.3 Children's experience of disruption of family of birth\nBumpass and Lu (2000) used the 1995 NSFG to estimate the total time children would\nspend in each of three types of families: cohabiting parent, single parent, and married\nparent households. Unfortunately, this type of analysis is inappropriate with the 2002\ndata because of the extent of missing marital separation dates.\nNevertheless, we can shed some light on the implications of increased cohabitation\nfor family stability by using the information on whether a disruption has occurred to\nFigure 2 presents the proportion of children born to married or cohabiting mothers who\nhad separated or divorced parents at the time of interview, a birth cohort measure with\nimportant limitations. The separations experienced by older children in the surveys\ncould date up to ten years prior to interview. In addition, because this approach yields\nsmaller samples at each age than a synthetic cohort approach, we must pool data across\nseveral years of age. The estimates approximate the proportion of children who\nexperienced parental separation by the mid-point of the pooled ages, and age intervals\nwere chosen in order to roughly estimate parental separation at whole years of age (e.g.\nestimates at 1 year are based on children ages 0-23 months, 2 years at 6-41 months).\nImportantly, these estimates are unadjusted percentages that do not control for any\ndifferences between cohabiting and married parents that contribute to the selection into\ncohabitation and to differences in separation rates between these union types.\nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 47\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 1685\nFigure 2: Percent of children experiencing parental separation by age at\ninterview and parents marital status at birth\nChild age (midpoint) at interview\nProportion of Children with Separated or Divorced Parents\nNotes: Only children born into a married or cohabiting union are included in these calculations. Child age is estimated as the mid-\npoint of the ages used to calculate the parental dissolution proportion (e.g. children ages 0-23 months are used to calculate age\nOverall dissolution rates changed little (see Figure 2). By approximate age 9, about\n30% of children experienced the dissolution of their parents' union in both time\nperiods.\nF\nF\nFigure 2 also shows results stratified by marital status at birth. In 2002,\nwithout accounting for selectivity, over 20% of marital births and over 50% of\ncohabiting births had experienced their parents' separation by age 9. Although the\ntrends between 1995 and 2002 suggest growing stability within each union type, the\ndifferences are not statistically different, and the small sample sizes make detection of\ndifferences unlikely for cohabitation. Thus, the overall trend in family dissolution is one\nof relative constancy.\n13 Additional estimates including all children ever in union yielded similar results; fewer than one-third of\nchildren experienced union dissolution by age 9 in both surveys, and the time trends were indistinguishable.\nKennedy & Bumpass: Cohabitation and children's living arrangements\n1686 http://www.demographic-research.org\nAlthough it is inappropriate to use the imputed 2002 NSFG data to produce point\nestimates of children's family instability, the 1995 data can be used to understand the\npotential implications of increased cohabitation. Using the 1995 NSFG, we estimate\nthat 32% of children--71% of children born to cohabiting parents and 26% of children\nborn to married parents--could expect to experience parental separation by age 12\nF\nF\nHad union dissolution rates following marital and\ncohabiting births remained at 1995 levels, the proportion of children experiencing\nparental separation by age 12 would have increased by 4 percentage points. This\nestimate assumes that all of the new cohabiting parents in the late 1990s adopted the\nvery high rates of union dissolution of the more select cohabiting parents in the early\n1990s and that married parents maintained early 1990s rates of marital dissolution. If\nthe stability of cohabiting parent families has improved with the increased prevalence of\ncohabiting childbearing, the impact would be smaller.\nAlthough exploratory, the evidence suggests that the increase in cohabiting\nchildbearing has resulted in at most a small increase the instability of children's birth\nfamilies. This could reflect a reshuffling of families, as less stable couples increasingly\ngiving birth in cohabitation rather than marriage; on its own, this process should not\naffect the overall population levels of family dissolution. Until new data become\navailable, the true implications of increased cohabitation for children's family lives will\nremain in doubt.\n5. Discussion\nAs cohabitation continues to spread rapidly, cohabitation has become the prevailing\nway in which adult women enter unions and is fast becoming a normal context in which\nto bear and parent children. The majority of women of nearly all ages, educational, and\nrace and ethnic backgrounds have some cohabitation experience. With this most recent\nexpansion of cohabitation, the time spent cohabiting now lasts longer--on average,\nnearly two years--as couples postpone the transition to marriage.\nCohabitation continues to drive changes in structure of families with children. By\nthe late 1990s, we estimate that nearly one-in-five births were to cohabiting couples,\nover half of all births to unmarried mothers. Children born to unmarried, non-cohabiting\nmothers also experienced an increased likelihood of ever living with their mother and a\ncohabiting partner. Our best estimate, based on rates in the late 1990s, is that almost\nhalf of the children in the United States can be expected to spend some time in a\ncohabiting family. It should be noted that the relevant trends have likely continued in\nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 47\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 1687\nthe ensuing 8 or so years. For example, the share of all births that were to unmarried\nCohabitation in the United States remains complex--both a part of the marriage\nprocess for some couples, and a temporary alternative to marriage for other couples. As\ncohabiting childbearing becomes more common, the characteristics of the people\nselecting into cohabiting parenthood--socioeconomic and demographic composition,\nrelationship quality, the planning of births--may shift. As it does, the place of\ncohabiting families in the family system may change accordingly. Broader demographic\nshifts, the rapid growth in the Hispanic population and increasing educational\nattainment, may themselves have consequences for the overall characteristics of\ncohabiting unions. Ultimately, the implications of increased cohabitation for child well-\nbeing will depend on how closely these new cohabiting families resemble the families\nwho entered cohabiting parenthood when it was unusual and highly selective.\n6.
