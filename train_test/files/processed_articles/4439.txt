Thus, .t\\JYSDEC pro-\nmulgates (adopts) ambient water quality standards to protect sources of potable\nwater from contamination by toxic chemicals and other substances. These are re-\nferred to as Health (Water Source) standards. New York's existing standards and\nstandard-setting procedures can be found in New York's Codes, Rules and Regula-\ntions (at 6 l\\iYCRR Parts 700-706). These are available on the J\\oJYSDEC web site at\nhttp://www.dec.state.ny.us.website/regs/chIO.htm.\nAmbient water quality standards are a state program with U.S. Environmental Pro-\ntection Agency (USEPA) oversight. The water quality standards program provides\nthe basis for the goal of \"Clean and Safe 'Vater\" by designating the use or uses to be\nmade ofeach individual water body within a state (i.e., as a drinking water supply, for\nrecreational uses, and for the protection ofaquatic life); setting the applicable water\nquality criteria that are necessary to protect these uses; and protecting existing water\nquality from being lowered through antidegradation policies and implementation\nprocedures. The functions ofwater quality standards include establishing the water\nquality goals (i.e., the designated uses); serving as the regulatory basis for estab-\nlishing water-quality-based effluent limitations and total maximum daily loads; and\nproviding the programmatic basis for water quality management and implementa-\ntion programs. Water quality standards also serve as a basis for tracking water quality\nimprovement or degradation.\nNew York State's ambient water quality standards apply to the water body itself\nand are intended to protect the best use(s) of the water body, consistent with the\nfederal approach. Separate standards for finished drinking water (i.e., maximum\ncontaminant levels or MCLs) are established by the New York State Department of\nHealth (NYSDOH).\nNew York State's ambient water quality standards are derived according to pro-\ncedures in New York State regulation at 6 NYCRR Part 702. These procedures are\npromulgated through the State's formal mlemaking process. The procedures to\nderive the Health (\"Vater Source) standards are developed jointly by l\\JYSDEC and\nWater Quality Standards for Nonlinear Carcinogens\nNYSDOH. These procedures are carefully designed to derive standards that are pro-\ntective of the best uses of the State's waters. New York State's ambient water quality\nstandards predate both the USEPA and the Clean Water Act. l\\'YSDEC first promul-\ngated its standard-setting procedures in 1985 for surface waters and extended them\nThe Clean 'Vater Act requires that states conduct a review every three years of their\nwater quality standards (\"triennial review\").\nNew York State is currently conducting its triennial review, in which both stan-\ndards and standard-setting procedures are being addressed (see opening footnote).\nProcedurally, the proposed revisions must yet undergo both l\\YSDEC Executive and\nGovernor's Office review before being formally proposed in rulemaking. The for-\nmal rulemaking process involves public hearing, public comment, and review by the\nState Environmental Board before a notice of adoption can be issued. Following\nadoption, the regulations must be submitted to the rSEPA along with certification\nby the New York State Attorney General. Once the USEPA approves the submitted\npackage, it will be in effect for Clean 'Vater Act purposes.\nAmbient water quality standards are based on comprehensive review of the toxi-\ncity information on a chemical, including, in most cases. primarv sources. New York\nState has always evaluated the potential of a substance to cause both cancer and\nnoncancer effects. Thus, New York State's existing standard-setting procedures al-\nlow the derivation (if appropriate) ofvalues for both oncogenic (carcinogenic) and\nnononcogenic effects of a substance. Because standards are set at levels much be-\nlow those that demonstrate effects in human populations or in laboratory studies of\nexperimental animals, high-to-low dose extrapolations are required. Existing regula-\ntions essen tially require a linear high-to-low dose extrapolation for oncogenic effects\nofa chemical (i.e., there is a finite risk at all doses above zero dose). The lifetime ex-\ncess cancer risk level prescribed in New York State's regulations is a risk management\ndecision and is set at one in one million. Tile regulations also require a nonlinear\nhigh-to-low dose extrapolation for the nononcogenic ellccts (uncertainty factor ap-\nproach) of the chemical (i.e., once below the threshold for the effect, the risk at all\ndoses above zero is zero). The most stringent (numr-ricallv It H\\l'r) of the oncogenic,\nnononcogenic, and the I\\TSDOH drinking water standard Ole},) is promulgated\nas the standard.\nOne of the strengths ofNew York State's water qualitv standards program has been\nNYSDEC's actions over the years to revise its standards, to he either more stringent or\nless stringent, as new toxicity data dictates. Such a rigorous, science-based standards\nprogram leads to greater public understanding and acceptance of revisions in either\ndirection of stringency. To maintain the strongest scientific basis for the program,\nNYSDEC must now revise not only its standards bur also the procedures by which\nfuture standards are derived.\nNonlinearity in Biology, Toxicology, and Medicine. Vol. I, No. 4, ~003 515\nS. J. Stoner and K. G. Bogdan\nNew York State's procedures to derive standards based on oncogenic effects have\nbeen changed little since 1985; however, recent years have seen significant advances\nin understanding the modes of actions of carcinogens and in procedures to derive\nvalues protective ofhuman health. Revisions contained in the proposal reflect the lat-\nest scientific knowledge and are consistent with USEPA's Methodology for Deriving\nAmbient Water Quality Criteria for the Protection of Human Health (USEPA, 2000)\nand with USEPA's latest revision to their Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment\nIn 1985, and in 1986 (when the USEPAissued its first setofcancer risk guidelines) ,\nit was believed that any level ofexposure to any carcinogenic substance carried some\nlevel of risk, and that the level of risk was dependent on the amount of exposure.\nIn other words, all carcinogenic effects are linear at low doses (see Appendix). Thus,\nthe initial 1985l\\'YSDEC standard-setting procedures, which centered on the health-\nprotective linearized multistage model for extrapolating the carcinogenic effects of\nchemicals from high to low doses, were consistent with the scientific consensus of the\ntime. Since then, the accumulating scientific evidence has convinced many scientists\nthat some carcinogens act via a nonlinear mode of action (see Appendix). In other\nwords, some chemicals may cause cancer by a mode of action that is nonlinear at\nlowdoses (see Appendix). The proposed revisions to the standard-setting procedures\nallow the use of the uncertainty factor approach for extrapolating the carcinogenic\neffects of such chemicals from high to low doses. However, such an analysis would be\npermitted only if the weight ofevidence was overwhelming in support ofa nonlinear\nmode of action (see step 5, following).\nThis is a six-step process.\nStep 1. Determination of Oncogenicity\nFirst, a determination must be made whether the substance causes an oncogenic\neffect (see Appendix) as defined in New York State regulations. This definition is\nunchanged from the existing regulations.\nStep 2. Selection of Dose-Response Data\nIf a substance meets this definition, the dose-response data deemed most appro-\npriate for evaluating potential human health risks at environmental exposures shall\nbe selected. Human data of high quality and adequate statistical power are gener-\nally preferred over animal data as the basis of a water quality value. For almost all\nof existing New York State standards, the human data were judged inadequate and\nanimal data were used to derive the oncogenic value. Factors for data selection in-\nclude route, duration and timing of exposure, species, strain, tumor types and sites,\nWater Quality Standards for Nonlinear Carcinogens\nnature and severity of effects, pharmacokinetics, mode of action, study quality, and\nstatistical significance.\nStep 3. Determination of Point of Departure\nThe starting point for the oncogenic value calculation is the point of departure\n(POD; see Appendix) for the selected dose-response data, which, depending on the\nquality of the data, could represent more than one animal species, cancer site, or\nexperiment. The POD is generally the LEDIO, which is the 95% lower confidence\nlimit on the dose (mg/kg/day) associated with 10% excess risk for oncogenic effects\nadjusted for background risk.\nThe POD is derived using the following hierarchy. The first choice is to use a\nvalidated biologicall)' based dose-response model (BBDRM; see Appendix). Absent such\nmodel, the second choice is to use a mathematical model (multistage, probit, lo-\ngistic, or Weibull) that best describes the dose-response data within the range of\nobservation. The third option would be to use an alternative POD such as a no-\nobserved-effect level (NOEL) or a lowest-observed-effect level (LOEL).\nStep 4. Conversion to Human Dose\nIf the POD is derived from animal data, the human equivalent dose at the POD is\nthen estimated by multiplying the animal-to-human body-weight ratio raised to the\n0.25 power by the animal dose, or by using an alternative trans-species conversion\nmethod if deemed more appropriate.\nStep 5. Extrapolation to Low Dose\nThe next major step is to extrapolate to low dose (dose at the level of the ambient\nstandard) from the POD. This is done one of several ways. If the POD was estimated\nfrom a validated BBDRM (the first choice in step 3), the ambient standard is derived\nbased on the 95% lower confidence limit on the human dose corresponding to an\nexcess lifetime cancer risk of one in one million.\nIf a validated BBDRi\\1. is not available, a mode-of-action analysis is conducted. The\nresults ofthis analysis will determine whether the extrapolation from the human dose\nat the POD to a low dose is via linear or nonlinear approach.\nThe default approach is linear. If there are no data on mode of action, or if\nthe mode-of-action analysis provides either evidr-nce of linearity at low doses or a\nlack of unequivocal evidence of nonlinearitv at low dose-s. a linear extrapolation will\nbe performed. Specifically, the ambient standard will he based on the 95% lower\nconfidence limit on the human dose corresponding to an excess lifetime cancer risk\nof one in one million. To calculate this, the human equivale-nt dose at the POD is\nmultiplied by a factor equal to the risk level of one in one million divided by the risk\nlevel at the POD.\nHowever, if the mode-of-action analvsis provides hath no evidence for linear-\nity at low doses and unequivocal evidence of nonlinearity at low doses, a nonlinear\n(uncertainty factor) approach is used to estimate the dose at the level of the ambient\nS. J.Stoner and K. G. Bogdan\nstandard. The human equivalent dose at the POD will be divided by an uncertainty\nfactor ofsuch magnitude to ensure that the human dose at the standard will be \"with-\nout appreciable risk to the human population, including children.\" The factor will\ngenerally range from 10 to 3,000. Factors considered in determining its magnitude\nwill include the nature of the dose-response curve and the point of departure; the\nrelative sensitivities of experimental animals and humans; the nature and extent of\nhuman variation, including age-specific differences in sensitivity during a lifetime;\nand data gaps in the toxicological database.\nStep 6. Calculation of Standard\nAn ambient water quality standard based on oncogenic effects is then calculated\nfrom the outcome of step 5. If the human dose at the level of the standard was\ndetermined from a BBDRM or a linear approach, that human dose is multiplied by\na body weight of 70 kg and divided by a water consumption rate of 2 1 per day to\nyield the standard, (Alternative body weight and water consumption rates can be\nused where warranted.)\nIf the human dose at the level of the standard was determined using a nonlinear\napproach, that human dose is multiplied by a body weight of 70 kg and a relative\nsource contribution of no more than 20%, and divided by a water consumption rate\nof21 per day to yield the standard. (Alternative body weight and water consumption\nrates can be used where warranted.)\nSUMMARY\nThe proposed revisions to NewYork State's procedures for deriving ambient water\nquality standards will provide needed flexibility to address carcinogenic substances\nthat work via a nonlinear mode of action. These revisions will provide this flexibility\nwhile retaining a health-protective approach.\nThis proposed change is a movement toward harmonization of risk assessment\nmethods for evaluating the carcinogenic and noncarcinogenic effects of chemicals.\nThe addition of a procedure for deriving a standard based on carcinogenic effects\nthat are nonlinear at low doses allows New York State to derive a cancer-based stan-\ndard using the same approach used to derive a standard based on the noncancer\neffects ofa chemical (i.e., identification ofNOEL, LOEL, or benchmark, and applica-\ntion of one or more uncertainty factor to compensate for uncertainty and variation).\nHowever, the uncertainty factor approach is not the default procedure for cancer\neffects, as it is for noncancer effects. Moreover, the proposed revisions to the regu-\nlations require a substantial amount of data and little or no uncertainty regarding\nthe mode of action before the nonlinear, uncertainty-factor-based approach can be\nused to derive a standard based on cancer effects.\nInherent in both the linear and nonlinear approach is the assumption that the\ndose-response for carcinogenic effects is monotonic. In other words, the critical\neffects decrease as dose decreases across all doses above zero (linear) or decrease\nas doses decreases across all doses above the threshold (nonlinear). 1\\iYSDEC and\nWater Quality Standards for Nonlinear Carcinogens\nNYSDOH staff are not at this time planning on further harmonization of the two\napproaches using recommendations suggested by Calabrese and Baldwin (2003),\nwhich incorporate hormesis into risk assessment.
