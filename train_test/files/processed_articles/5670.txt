    "abstract": "Abstract\nWhile active explorers in a real-world environment typically remember more about its spatial layout than participants who\npassively observe that exploration, this does not reliably occur when the exploration takes place in a virtual environment\n(VE). We argue that this may be because an active explorer in a VE is effectively performing a secondary interfering\nconcurrent task by virtue of having to operate a manual input device to control their virtual displacements. Six groups of\nparticipants explored a virtual room containing six distributed objects, either actively or passively while performing\nconcurrent tasks that were simple (such as card turning) or that made more complex cognitive and motoric demands\ncomparable with those typically imposed by input device control. Tested for their memory for virtual object locations,\npassive controls (with no concurrent task) demonstrated the best spatial learning, arithmetically (but not significantly)\nbetter than the active group. Passive groups given complex concurrent tasks performed as poorly as the active group. A\nconcurrent articulatory suppression task reduced memory for object names but not spatial location memory. It was\nconcluded that spatial demands imposed by input device control should be minimized when training or testing spatial\nmemory in VEs, and should be recognized as competing for cognitive capacity in spatial working memory.\n",

The usual finding in\nreal-world studies is that active engagement confers better\nspatial learning for adults and children. Vehicle passengers\ntend to learn less than drivers about the spatial layout of a\nworld spatial learning is generally better in children after\nactive than passive learning (Foreman, Foreman,\nSpatial learning in VEs, however, does not appear to be\nreliably affected by the active or passive status of the\nparticipant, and active status has sometimes been found to\nbe a disadvantage. This apparent anomaly was first\nExperiment 1) conducted a study in which participants\neither actively explored a virtual environment or passively\n1Middlesex University, London, UK\nCorresponding Author:\nGeorge Sandamas, Middlesex University, The Burroughs, Hendon,\nEmail: g.sandamas@mdx.ac.uk\nsgo.sagepub.com\n2 SAGE Open\nobserved an active participant's exploration, and then\nattempted to remember the locations of four targets.\nSurprisingly, subsequent orientation and way-finding\nmeasures found more accurate judgments for passive\nobservers than active ones. In a second experiment, using a\nwithin-subject design, Wilson and Peruch (2002) found no\ndifference between active and passive participants.\nSandamas and Foreman (2007) found that passive\nparticipants were more accurate on a subsequent object\nplacement task than active participants whose\ndisplacements they observed.\nA possible explanation for these phenomena is that in\nsome situations working memory (WM) can become\noverloaded and the performance of active participants is\ncompromised by the imposition of having to use an\nunfamiliar input device to interface with the computer\n(Sandamas & Foreman, 2007). The impact on\nperformance of having to operate an input device has been\ngenerally overlooked in VE (or other) research, possibly\nbecause device operation (whether mouse, joystick,\nkeyboard, or tailored device) has been regarded as non-\nchallenging. It has not been regarded as demanding a\nsignificant amount of cognitive capacity, in the same way\nthat when a real-world environment is explored on foot,\nbipedal locomotion is not considered a parallel task as it is\nso familiar, automatic, and requires no training.\nNevertheless, this cannot be assumed to apply to the\nmanual guidance of virtual exploration. Indeed, it is\ninteresting that the manual movements required to operate\nan input device and interface with software--especially 3-\nD environment software--are similar to those required by\nthose tasks commonly used as concurrent tasks to disrupt\nspatial learning in real-world spatial learning including\nmap learning (cf. Coluccia, 2008; Garden, Cornoldi, &\nthat training and task familiarity must be crucial factors in\ndetermining the extent to which concurrent tasks interfere\nwith each other. In terms of spatial learning, there is\nevidence for such a model, since Sandamas, Foreman, and\nCoulson (2009) restored the advantage that active\nexplorers should theoretically have by giving participants\ngreater time to familiarize themselves with the input\ndevice. Active participants in this situation were more\naccurate on the same object placement task as in\nSandamas and Foreman (2007) than passive participants,\nindicating that extra training with the input device helps\nalleviate the concurrent demand on WM caused by using\nsuch a device.\nClearly, the model adopted here, which is the same as\nBaddeley (1993), makes no assumptions about where in\nWM the bottleneck or information overload occurs--it\nmight, for example, occur in a visual, spatial, or motoric\nmemory store, or at central executive level. Nevertheless, it\nmakes a clear prediction that the greater the spatial load\napplied via a concurrent task, the less spatial information is\nlikely to be obtained from simultaneous exploration of a\nThis approach is standard, the dual-task approach being\nthe most commonly used paradigm for gauging resource\ndemands on WM (Guttentag, 1989) and has reliably\nindicated that as the demands of concurrent tasks increase,\nperformance on a central task diminishes. For instance,\nGarden et al. (2002, Experiment 1) found that both spatial\ntapping and articulatory suppression tasks interfered with\nthe primary task of route learning from a segmented map.\nColuccia, Bosco, and Brandimonte (2007) found that map\nlearning, as demonstrated through map drawing, was\nimpaired when participants performed the same concurrent\nspatial tapping task as Garden et al. (2002), but not when\nperforming a concurrent articulatory suppression task. Their\nfindings were interpreted as supporting their hypothesis that\nvisuo-spatial WM is implicated in spatial learning from\nmaps.\nThe present study tested both active and passive groups\nfor their memory for the layout of a virtual room containing\nsix objects. While observing a pre-recorded exploration\nsession, each passive group was challenged with a\nsimultaneous concurrent task, tasks varying according to\ntheir spatial demands. Active explorers of VEs were\nexpected not to show any advantage over passive observers\ndue to the extra load placed on WM by having to operate an\ninput device (aka perform a concurrent spatial task).\nFurthermore, to examine whether the spatial loading of a\nconcurrent task could be manipulated to negatively impact\nto a lesser or greater degree on passive observers, different\nconcurrent tasks were carefully selected for their degree of\nspatial demand. These required simple hand/finger\nmovements with no spatial sophistication (simple card\nturning), hand/finger movements requiring spatial decisions\n(sequential compass-point card-sorting), or hand/finger\nmovements to tap keyboard keys in a prescribed order\n(mimicking the complex movements made by active\nparticipants using keyboard keys to guide their virtual\nspatial displacements). A final secondary task was also used\nthat was entirely non-spatial, or not spatially demanding, in\nwhich condition spatial learning was expected to remain\nunaffected. This was a verbal task (articulatory\nsuppression), which may rely on the WM phonological\nloop, and while not affecting spatial memory per se was\nanticipated to reduce memory for the names of objects\nencountered within the VE.\nMethod\nParticipants\nOne hundred and fifty undergraduate participants (60 male,\n23 years and a SD of 5.5, were recruited from the\nundergraduate population and awarded course credits for\nparticipation.\nSandamas and Foreman 3\nFigure 1. A screen shot of the virtual room containing the six\nobjects.\nNote. The top of the gramophone can be seen in the foreground.\nApparatus and Procedure\nAll participants except those in the Active condition (see\nbelow) watched a pre-recorded exploration of the VE made\nby a confederate participant prior to the start of the\nexperiment. The VE was modeled using SuperScape VRT\n3.0 software and constructed to represent a large room in\nwhich six objects were arranged at floor level. These were a\nflower in a pot, computer monitor, bottle, road traffic cone,\ntriangular road sign, and gramophone (see Figure 1). The\nfloor was green in color and the walls were lilac. One wall\nhad gray cupboards against it and another had windows and\nwall-mounted radiators (see Figure 1). The confederate was\nallowed to move freely about the environment, using four\nkeyboard keys to direct their displacements (forward, back,\nleft rotate, right rotate), and was requested to visit each of\nthe floor-level objects twice, but in an unsystematic way. A\nvisit was defined as moving close to an object so that it\noccupied the entire screen. The room was devoid of any\nother objects such as tables or chairs (see Figure 1). The VE\nwas displayed for all participants on a 21-inch monitor. The\nentire exploration lasted 140 s. The route was recorded\nusing HyperCam 2 digital recording freeware. Participants\nin the active condition each explored the VE for 140 s,\nusing the same input device and visiting each object twice\nas the confederate had done. All participants were simply\ninstructed to \"get to know the layout of the VE.\"\nEach participant was allocated to one of the following\nsix conditions:\n(1) Controls: These passive participants watched the\nrecording of the confederate's exploration of the VE\nwith no additional task.\n(2) Simple card-sorting: Using a standard pack of\nplaying cards, participants were asked to pick up each\ncard in turn, turn it over, and place it face down next\nto the original pack while viewing the recorded VE\nexploration. Participants were asked to maintain a\nturnover speed of approximately one card per second\nwithout pause. They were asked to start turning cards\nprior to the commencement of the recording.\n(3) Complex card-sorting: The same standard pack of\ncards was used as for the simple card-sorting\ncondition. However, participants in this group were\nasked to pick up the first card and place it directly\nabove the pack. The next card was placed to the right\nof the pack, the next beneath the pack, and the fourth\nto the left of the pack; in other words, participants\nplaced the cards around the pack in a clockwise\ndirection to four compass points. This sequence (up-\nright-down-left) was then repeated until the video\nsequence ended. Participants were allowed a short\npractice session prior to the commencement of the\nrecording to ensure that they understood and were\nable to carry out the instructions.\n(4) Verbal task (Articulatory suppression): Participants\nwere asked to repeat the days of the week, starting\nwith Monday, out loud at a rate of approximately one\nper second, while viewing the recording.\n(5) Spatial tapping: Participants were asked to\nrepeatedly tap a 12-key sequence on the number\nkeypad of a computer QWERTY keyboard, starting\nwith the 1 in the bottom left corner, at a rate of one\nper second following a predefined Boustrophedon\nwere displayed on a separate computer screen to that\non which the VE was displayed so that their\nperformance could be monitored. If participants'\nkeystrokes became too slow--less than approximately\none every 2 s--or erratic, the experimenter gave them\na verbal prompt. This happened on only two\noccasions. This task has been used previously by\n(6) Active: Participants explored the VE for 140 s using\nthe keyboard arrow keys to control displacements.\nThey were required to visit each object in the VE\ntwice. A visit was defined as moving close to an\nobject so that it occupied the entire screen.\nAssessing Spatial Memory\nAt the end of the video sequence, each participant was\ntaken to a table several meters from the video screen, and\ngiven a sheet of paper on which was depicted a birds eye\nscreen shot of the room layout but with only one of the\nfloor objects depicted (the road traffic cone). Colors were\nauthentic, exactly as those in the VE. Participants were\nasked to indicate the positions of the missing floor objects\nby drawing five crosses and to label each cross with the\nname of the object. Where an object name was not recalled,\nthis was recorded and the participant was reminded of the\nidentity of the object and was asked to guess its location by\nlabeling one of the unlabeled crosses. This procedure was\nnecessary so that each participant had 5 scores for the\n4 SAGE Open\nTable 1.

Participants were given\nunlimited time, though almost all completed the exercise\nwithin 1 to 2 min. Object placement is a much used and\nrecognized measure of spatial learning in both real world\nSiegel, 1978) and virtual (Brunswick, Martin, & Marzano,\nstudies.\nResults\nPerformance was assessed along two factors, one spatial\n(object location) and one non-spatial (object name). The\nspatial measure (placement error) was calculated by placing\na transparent acetate sheet, on which all of the six floor\nobjects were depicted, over the floor plan on which\nparticipants had indicated where they thought the object\npositions were and measuring the distances between\nparticipant-placed objects and the objects' original\npositions. Thus, five error distances in millimeters were\nobtained for each participant. From these, average\nplacement error scores were calculated. The non-spatial\nmeasure was based simply on participants' memory for the\nnames objects encountered within the VE; as indicated\nabove, this was recorded when participants were making\ntheir placement judgments.\nAverage Placement Error Scores\nAverage Placement Error (APE) scores were entered into a\ntwo-way, 6  2 (Condition  Gender) Analysis of Variance\n(ANOVA). There was no gender difference, F(1, 138) =\np\n = .002, nor any significant Condition \np\nHowever, conditions did differ significantly, F(5, 138) =\np\n = .11. Tukey's post hoc comparisons\nshowed that complex card-sorting (p = .018) and spatial\ntapping (p = .044) participants performed significantly\nworse than controls. All other comparisons were non-\nsignificant at p = .05 (see Table 1).\nFigure 2 above shows placement error (in mm) in order\nof magnitude by condition.\nMemory for Objects\nMemory for the names of the objects encountered was\ninitially entered as a dependent variable (DV) in the two-\nway ANOVA, as used above with APE scores; however,\nLevene's test for homogeneity of variance was highly\nsignificant (p < .001) and the data were highly negatively\nskewed; therefore, the following non-parametric treatment\nof the data was conducted.\nAs can be seen from Figure 3 above, only the median\nscore (3.0) for participants in the verbal (articulatory\nsuppression) condition was markedly lower than\nparticipants in the other conditions all of whom scored 5.0.\nTable 2 shows the spread of data (frequencies) for object\nmemory by condition. Examination of the figures shows the\nnegative skew of the data in that most participants\nremembered all of the objects they encountered within the\nVE. The exception was the verbal (articulatory suppression)\ncondition. Participants' object memory data were subjected\nto a KruskalWallis analysis with condition as the\nindependent variable. The result was significant, 2(5, N =\nDiscussion\nThis study set out to further explore the idea that the spatial\nlearning of active participants in virtual studies may be\nnegatively affected by the imposition of having to use an\ninput device and also that this imposition can be replicated\nby having passive participants perform a spatially\ndemanding concurrent task. To some extent the findings\nhave supported this notion and the hypothesis that spatial\nlearning would be negatively affected by a spatially\ndemanding concurrent task but not by a non-spatially\ndemanding one was supported. Participants in the complex\ncard-sorting and spatial tapping conditions were\nsignificantly worse than those in the control group, making\nsignificantly greater placement errors, whilst participants in\nthe simple card-sorting and verbal conditions performed at\nan equivalent level. These findings concur with previous\nresearch, which indicates that a spatially demanding\nsecondary task interferes with effective spatial learning\nabout an environment (e.g., Coluccia, 2008; Coluccia et al.,\nSandamas and Foreman 5\nFigure 2. Average placement error scores (in mm) by condition with Standard Error bars.\nNote. Lower scores indicate more accurate object placement.\nFigure 3. Median memory for objects by condition.\nMoreover, as hypothesized, participants in the verbal\n(articulatory suppression) condition remembered\nsignificantly fewer object names than participants in the\ncontrol group and all other groups but were no worse at\nremembering object positions, illustrating perhaps a\n6 SAGE Open\ndissociation between spatial and sematic memory and that\nthe verbal and spatial concurrent tasks in the current study\nselectively disrupt WM as in the studies of Coluccia et al.\nParticipants were carefully observed for evidence of\ntheir shifting attention overtly from the screen to the\nconcurrent task, though no evidence was seen of this\nsystematically. Unsurprisingly, the keyboard-tapping task\nwas most prone to this, seen occasionally in some\nparticipants, although this task has been successfully used\nas a concurrent task in previous comparable real-world\nwhile both of the complex concurrent tasks suppressed\nperformance on the spatial memory measure, no obvious\novert shifts of attention could be detected for the complex\ncard-sorting task. Future work could use measures of\nperformance on concurrent tasks (including speed-accuracy\ntrade-off) that could provide further evidence for the\ndistribution of attention and cognitive capacity among the\nprimary and concurrent tasks. For present purposes, it was\nclear that participants in all conditions were engaged with\nthe tasks given to them.\nOf particular interest here, however, is how\nparticipants in the active condition performed compared\nwith the other groups. As discussed above, based on the\nfindings of previous real-world studies such as Foreman\nand others, one would expect participants who actively\nexplored the environment to have an advantage in terms\nof spatial learning over passive observers. This\nadvantage, however, is not reliably found in virtual\nWilson & Peruch, 2002), and here participants in the\nactive condition were no better than passive controls and\nperformed at a level equivalent to that of participants\nundertaking a spatially demanding concurrent task.\nAlthough not fully congruent with our hypotheses, as\nactive participants were arithmetically worse (but not\nstatistically significantly worse) than passive controls,\nthese findings still provide additional evidence to that of\nSandamas et al. (2009) in support of the notion that\nspatial learning in VEs is disrupted by the imposition of\nusing an input device to explore and that any advantage\nthat active explorers of a VE might have is compromised\nby this. We accept that the present complex concurrent\ntasks may have made greater demands on cognitive\ncapacity than the operation of an input device. However,\nthe pattern of current results strongly suggests that in\nVE-based training and testing, active participants are\nprevented from taking advantage of their active status,\nby virtue of having to use up some visuo-spatial WM\ncapacity in input device control. This is further suggested\nby the results of Sandamas et al. (2009) who found that\nadditional training with an input device restored the\nactive advantage in children, indicating that the extra\ntraining reduced input device demands on WM.\nTable 2. Object Memory by Condition.\nControlSimple Complex Verbal ActiveBoustrophedon\nGroup\ntotal\nNumber of objects recalled\nThe result poses questions regarding the degree of\nspatial-motor disruption that occurs in the performance of\nfamiliar real-world tasks, where an active advantage over\npassive exploratory experience is usually obtained. For\nexample, the motor movements made in controlling a\nmotor vehicle (depressing pedals, steering, and operating\ngears) might also be expected to disrupt spatial learning,\nyet anecdotally (see Hart & Berzok, 1982), drivers\ntypically obtain more spatial information than a passive\npassenger. It is likely that in well-trained motor tasks, the\nimpact of spatial-motor movements is reduced. Driving\nbecomes an automatic behavior, except when conscious\nattention is required to modify a sub-program, as when\ntraffic suddenly slows and a driver has to react. It is likely\nthat at moments when such distractions occur, spatial\ninformation cannot be processed. Likewise, a novice\ndriver is unlikely to acquire as much spatial information\nafter driving a route in an unfamiliar town as an\nexperienced motorist.\nThe present data are also of interest in relation to\nprevious studies in which children with disabling conditions\nwere able to find their way around school buildings after a\nperiod of virtual exploration (Foreman et al., 2005). In\nsome cases, children unable to operate an input device were\ntrained by having them observe the displacements of an\nactive explorer, who took instructions but operated the input\ndevice on their behalf. Far from disadvantaging the disabled\nchildren, it is likely that they were allowed more cognitive\ncapacity to apply to the learning of the environment and\nwould have been disadvantaged by having to operate an\nunfamiliar input device. This clearly has wider training\nimplications.\nIn summary, this study was conducted to further\ninvestigate the suggestion of Sandamas and Foreman (2007)\nthat active explorers of VEs do not demonstrate the expected\nadvantage in spatial learning over passive observers due to\nthe added demands on WM of having to use an unfamiliar\ninput device to interface with the computer. Sandamas et al.\n(2009) addressed this problem by giving participants extra\ntime to familiarize themselves with the input device. They\nfound that this restored the expected advantage for activity\nand proposed that this was because the extra training reduced\ninput device demands on WM. Here we have approached the\nproblem using the concurrent task paradigm and found that\nconcurrent tasks with a spatial element, estimated to load\nSandamas and Foreman 7\nWM at least to the same extent as using an unfamiliar input\ndevice, can disrupt spatial learning of a VE layout thereby\nlending further support to the initial proposition of Sandamas\nAlthough the current findings are congruent with our own\nprevious research findings regarding spatial learning in VEs\nand the research findings of others regarding spatial learning\nwith other media and the implication of WM (see above),\nfurther research is currently underway in which our procedures\nare being refined to address the possible criticism of the current\nfindings that they may not dissociate all of the WM\ncomponents implicated in the observed effects. For instance,\nboth complex spatial tasks involve elements of planning and\ndecision making (arguably Central Executive functions) not\npresent in simpler and non-spatial tasks. It may also be\npossible to dissociate visual working memory from spatial\nworking memory with refinements of the current approach,\nusing VEs, to determine where within the WM system\ninformation bottlenecks occur.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAppleyard, D.
