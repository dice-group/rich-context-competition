According to the YRBS data from\n2011, 70.8% of teenagers reported having consumed at least one alcoholic drink (Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention, 2012a). Moreover, 47.4% of adolescents had engaged in sexual intercourse\n(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2012c). These two behaviours (i.e. alcohol use and sexual\nintercourse) occur more frequently among adolescents than other risky behaviours, such as tobacco\nuse (44.7%) (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2012d) or marijuana use (39.9%) (Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention, 2012b). In addition, in the same year, 22.1% answered positively to the\nitem:`Did you drink alcohol or use drugs before you had sexual intercourse the last time?'-- indicating\nthat nearly half of the adolescents who engaged in sexual intercourse, did so under the influence of\ndrugs or alcohol (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2012c).\nRisky behaviours among adolescents pose a significant threat to their health during the\nadolescence years, and engaging in risky behaviours can lead to non-trivial health problems, even\nas adults (DiClemente, Hansen, & Ponton, 1996). Certain levels of alcohol consumption during\nadolescence can negatively affect physiological development (by affecting the brain and hormones,\n KEYWORDS\nFriendship; social networks;\nadolescents; sexual\nbehaviour; alcohol use; peer\ninfluence\n\u00a9 2015 The Author(s).

C. Jeon and P. Goodson\nfor instance), and can lead to other risky behaviours, including unprotected sexual activity and\ntobacco use (Guo et al., 2002; Santelli, Robin, Brener, & Lowry, 2001). Although engaging in sexual\nactivity during adolescence is normative within many social groups in the USA (Brendgen, Wanner,\n& Vitaro, 2007), beginning sexual intercourse at an early age leads to an increased risk for sexually\ntransmitted infections, or for becoming pregnant (Tapert, Aarons, Sedlar, & Brown, 2001). These\nrisks may increase when sexual activity is coupled with significant amounts of alcohol consumption\n(Bailey, Pollock, Martin, & Lynch, 1999), because high blood alcohol levels can impair judgement\nand lead to unprotected intercourse.\nThe literature on adolescents'health addresses the notion that when adolescents engage in a risky\nbehaviour, they are more likely to engage in other risky behaviours. For instance, in a study conducted\nby MacArthur et al. (2012), the authors documented that alcohol use among adolescents (aged 15\nand 16) was positively associated with other risky behaviours (i.e. substance use and sexual activity).\nAdditionally, the study by Patrick and Schulenberg (2010) presented adolescents' substance use (i.e.\nsmoking and marijuana use) as leading to greater intentions to drink alcohol.\nFor these phenomena, earlier literature demonstrate that, in particular, friends and/or friendship net-\nworks during adolescence play a key role in influencing adolescents'risky behaviours (Alexander, Piazza,\nMekos, & Valente, 2001; Pollard, Tucker, Green, Kennedy, & Go, 2010; Sieving, Eisenberg, Pettingell, &\nSkay, 2006;Valente, Unger, & Johnson, 2005), because friends and friendships underlie person-to-person\nand/or group-to-group interactions. For instance, the study conducted by Schwinn and Schinke (2014)\nfound that drinking and offering alcohol increasingly affected other teens'intentions toward drinking.\nIn addition, Fujimoto and Valente (2012a) addressed a key finding that various types of friendships\namong adolescents (i.e. mutual, reciprocal and directional friendships) strongly influenced friends'\nsubstance use (e.g. drinking and smoking).\nMoreover, other studies have identified friendships as probably the most significant factor in the\nspreading of risky behaviour among groups of teens (Ali & Dwyer, 2011; Fujimoto & Valente, 2012b;\nJaccard, Blanton, & Dodge, 2005), because of adolescents'development and most of them needing to\nbelong to their friends'or other social groups outside their own family. For instance, a study carried out\nby Mercken, Snijders, Steglich, and deVries (2009) identified that adolescents were more likely to select\ntheir friends based on similar smoking behaviour. Additionally, the study conducted by Fujimoto and\nValente (2013) found that adolescents affiliated with organised school sports and clubs (e.g. basket-\nball and playing chess) affected non-affiliated adolescents' drinking behaviour. Therefore, examining\nfriendship networks may provide better information on adolescents'behaviours and their interpersonal\nmechanisms, than the study of individual intra-personal factors alone.\nOne way to capture the influence of friendships among adolescents is Social Network Analysis\n(SNA). Studies have highlighted that SNA can be applied to understanding the scope of changes\nin risky health behaviours and friendship ties among adolescents (Christakis & Fowler, 2007; Jeon\nfriendships and behaviours occur inside inter-personal systems (Steglich, Snijders, & Pearson, 2010).\nSpecifically, utilising SNA can provide visuals (in graph form) that are useful to describe and analyse\nthe patterns of a network's structure, as well as verify statistical measures (Crnovrsanin, Muelder,\nThe theoretical perspective of network theory focuses on structural and/or relational approaches\nto the research of social (network) influence (Cook & Whitmeyer, 1992), compared with learning and/\nor observing approaches in traditional theories. In other words, network theory is based on the notion\nof network influence: adolescents are affected by interacting directly and indirectly with their friends\nor with their friends'friends (Ennett & Bauman, 1996). The result is that they can share similar behav-\niours (i.e. influenced by friends or exert influence on friends) or stand in similar positions inside their\nnetworks (i.e. individuals connecting to all other friends in the network measured by network centrali-\ntiessuchasdegree[thenumberoflinkstoandfromaperson],density[theratioofthenumberofactual\nconnections divided by the total possible connections in the network] (Valente, 2010) and\nbetweenness [the number of times an adolescent lies on the shortest paths linking other adolescents\nInternational Journal of Adolescence and Youth 3\nin the network]) (Borgatti, Everett, & Johnson, 2013). Therefore, utilising network analysis, research-\ners can examine the composition or the set-up of the network and its influence upon adolescents'\nrisky behaviours.\nTraditionally, risky behaviour dissemination relies on individual-level information on how\nadolescents adopt a behaviour through learning and/or observing others perform the behav-\niour. Researchers have used traditional theories such as the Theory of Planned Behavior or Social\nCognitive Theory in studies of health and risky behaviours among adolescents. These classical\ntheories have emphasised the individual-level inter-personal process of learning risky behaviour\nby directly observing how others behave, or by adopting a group's social norms and framing\nattitudes according to these norms in order to be accepted into those groups (National Institutes\nRegarding our topic of interest, here, in addition to social network theory, Jessor's Problem Behavior\nTheory (PBT) (1987) can also help explore the mechanism of influence of friendship network structure\nupon adolescents' risky behaviours. PBT is based on a social-psychological framework that attempts\nto explain risk factors related to adolescent involvement in various problem behaviours such as sexual\nintercourse, tobacco, alcohol and drug use (Jessor, 1987). PBT includes three major systems of socio-psy-\nchological variables: the personality system (i.e. individual values, beliefs and attitudes), the perceived\nenvironment system (i.e. family and friend influences) and the behaviour system (i.e. drinking, deviant\nbehaviour, marijuana, cigarettes and drug use behaviours). According to Jessor (1987), adolescents'\nproblem behaviours are associated with the perceived environment system (e.g. peer relations) and\npersonality system (e.g. attitudes), because, within peer relations, friends'behaviours can directly influ-\nence various risky behaviours among adolescents.\nInformed by these theoretical perspectives, the purpose of this study, therefore, is twofold:\nusing data from a large, national sample of adolescents in the US, to (1) describe the structure\nof friendship networks for adolescents who engage in, and for adolescents who do not engage\nin sexual intercourse and alcohol consumption simultaneously; and (2) assess the influence of\nfriendship network structure upon adolescents'risky health behaviours (specifically the behaviours\nof sexual intercourse and alcohol consumption in tandem). To achieve this purpose, we employ\nSNA techniques utilised by authors in the research of social networks (Ennett et al., 2006; Mercken\nThis study is important because it examines two risky behaviours simultaneously, while most\nprevious studies examine risky behaviours individually and in isolation. We believe that research\nexamining multiple simultaneous risk behaviours can significantly help with the design of more effective\nprevention programmes to promote adolescents'healthy development.\nMethods\nData source\nThis study utilised the longitudinal data generated by the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent\nHealth to Adult Health (Add Health) in the USA.The Add Health study gathers information (e.g. health-\nrelated behaviours of adolescents, demographics and family socio-economic status) for students in\ngrades 7\u00ad12 nationwide, thus yielding representative data stored in the Caroline Population Center\nat The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. To date, Waves I, II, III and IV of the data collection\nlescence to young adulthood.The Add Health data-set comprises completed in-school questionnaires\nand in-home interviews. The Wave I in-school questionnaire (n = 90,118) from 145 schools includes\ntopics such as demographic characteristics (e.g. age, gender and ethnicity), health-risk behaviours,\nextracurricular activities in the school year, and friendship nominations for the five best male and five\nbest female friends from school rosters (Harris et al., 2009).\n4  K. C. Jeon and P. Goodson\nSample\nFrom the pool of adolescents completing the in-school questionnaire, the Wave I in-home inter-\nview sample (n = 20,745) in grades 7\u00ad12 is drawn. The in-home interview includes sensitive ques-\ntions including those about alcohol use and sexual behaviour. Additionally, the in-home interview\nsample contains a subsample, called the saturated school sample (n = 3702) from 16 schools where\nall enrolled students in the schools participated in in-home interviews. Therefore, in order to achieve\nour purpose, this study used the saturated sample from the two schools providing the largest\nsamples out of the original 16, for analysis. The remaining 14 schools are excluded due to relatively\nsmall sample sizes and substantially larger amounts of missing data. Moreover, friendship nomi-\nnations in these saturated schools allow us to construct complete friendship networks, indicating\nthese networks can provide inter-relationships such as adolescent's relations and network positions\namong individual adolescents.\nWe limited our analysis to adolescents who answered`yes'or`no'to the question,`The most recent\ntime you had sexual intercourse, had you been drinking alcohol?' in the in-home interview, from the\ntwo schools with the largest saturated samples.This resulted in a total sample of 901 (School 1: n = 324\nMeasures\nFriendship nominations were obtained by asking students to name up to five best male and five best\nfemale friends. The friendship nominations from the same school rosters to which the respondent\nbelonged received unique identification codes (e.g. 12345678), whereas friends from different schools\nwere duly identified by specific codes (e.g. 77777777). We excluded friendship nominations from\ndifferent schools in subsequent analyses because these friends did not connect with each other within\nthe same friendship networks. Using nominations from the same school rosters, we can create complete\nnetworks within a given school. These complete networks allow us to measure adolescent's relations\nand network positions.\nWe computed the following measures of friendship networks via a social network analysis computer\nprogram.\n(1)Degree is`the number of links to and from a person'(Valente, 2010). Out-degree is the number\nof friendship ties that the ego (person responding to the survey) nominates; in-degree is the\nnumber of friendship nominations the ego receives (Valente, 2010).\n(2)Density is the ratio of the number of actual connections divided by the total possible connec-\nBetweenness is the number of times an adolescent lies on the shortest paths linking other\nadolescents in the network (Borgatti et al., 2013).\nBonacich centrality is `... not only a function of how many friends an individual has but also\nthe number of friends one's friends have'(Ali, Amialchuk, & Rizzo, 2012).\nIn this study, we assessed the influence of friendship network structures upon the behaviours of\nsexual intercourse and alcohol consumption in tandem, based on a question in the in-home interview\natWave I. Specifically, students were asked if they had been drinking alcohol when they last had sexual\nintercourse. Originally, while the questionnaire offers the option of answers coded as three categor-\nical variables (e.g. 0 = `no', 1 = `yes', and 3 = `refused'), we dichotomised the variable, examining only\nparticipants who answered`yes'or`no'.We also utilised gender and grade as control variables, coded as\ndichotomous (1 = male and 2 = female) and categorical variables (e.g. 7 = 7th grade and 8 = 8th grade)\nfrom the in-home interview at Wave I.\nInternational Journal of Adolescence and Youth 5\nStatistical analyses\nFor descriptive analyses we employed Stata 13 (StataCorp LP, College Station,TX). Moreover, to analyse\nthe saturated samples from the in-home interview atWave I, we utilised the NetDraw feature in UCINET,\na dynamic network analysis tool, to describe the structure of the friendship networks for adolescents\nwho engaged in and for those who did not engage in simultaneous sexual intercourse and alcohol use.\nTo assess the relationship between network structure and adolescents' risk behaviours, we ran a\nlogistic linear regression using Stata 13 for each school. In a preliminary analysis, we assessed whether\nstudents in the two schools were similar enough to agglomerate into a single sample, and found there\nwere statistically significant differences between Schools (1 and 2) on the question regarding alcohol\nuse during sexual intercourse (p = .03). We report our analyses, therefore, separately for each school,\nTable 1. Descriptive statistics: gender, age, and race (n = 901).\n*Includes mean (SD).\nGender\nRace/ethnicity\nTable 2. Descriptive statistics:`yes'and`no'groups from each school.\n*Includes mean (SD).\nCharacteristic\nGender\nRace/ethnicity\n6  K. C. Jeon and P. Goodson\nas students in the schools differed significantly in their responses on the surveys. Moreover, we also\nassessed multicollinearity, reporting variance inflation factors (VIF), among variables in the logistic\nregression analysis. The VIF values of all variables were below 4.42 in Schools 1 and 2, indicating mul-\nticollinearity was not a problem (O'Brien, 2007).\nResults\nDescriptive statistics\nAs shown in Table 1, we employed descriptive statistics to highlight the characteristic of the samples\nfrom School 1 (n = 324) and School 2 (n = 577), respectively. Because adolescents were allowed to choose\nmultiple options for the item on race/ethnicity, the percentage totals exceed 100%. In School 1, nearly\nrace/ethnicity as white. In School 2, more than half of the students (54.1%) were male, 35.88% were\n18 years old and 29.5% reported their race/ethnicity as African-American.\nTable 2 shows descriptive statistics for adolescents from the two schools, who engaged in (`yes')\nand who did not engage in (`no') drinking alcohol before having intercourse. Once again, the total\npercentages for race/ethnicity exceed 100%, because students could have chosen multiple ethnic-\nities. School 1 had 50 students in the`yes'group, and 274 students in the`no'group. More than half\nthe students in the`yes'group (62%) were boys and 34% were 17 and 18 years old, respectively. All\nstudents (100%) marked one of their race/ethnicities as white. Among the `no' group at School 1,\nmore than half (51.5%) of students were girls and 28.1% reported being 18 years old. The majority\n(99.3%) marked white as one of their ethnicities. In School 2, 40% were boys in the`yes'group and,\nof these, 40.98% were 17 years old; 34.4% reported their race/ethnicity as African-American. In the\nchoices as African-American.\nNetworks\nFigure 1 depicts the network structures of School 1 and 2, based on friendship nominations, for the\nadolescents who engaged in sexual intercourse and drinking alcohol. Adolescents were asked to report\nfive best male and female friends; however, the total number of friendship nominations varied by stu-\ndent. It is important to note we did not include `isolates'or adolescents with no ties in Figure 1. Thus,\nthe number of students in the graph depicted in Figure 1 differs from the total sample. Each square\n(adolescents engaged in risky behaviours) or circle (their friends) represents a student in the network.\nSquares and circles are sized based on degree. In School 1, there are 137 adolescents with 147 ties.The\ngraph for School 2 displays 92 students with 41 ties.\nFigure 2 shows students (circle) who did not engage in the two behaviours we assessed within each\nschool, based on friendship nominations.We also did not include`isolates'in Figure 2.Thus, as for Figure\n1, the number of students in the graphs differ from the number of students in the analytical sample.\nEach circle represents a student in the network. Circles are sized based on degree.

The probabilities were estimated separately for each school.\nIn School 1, in terms of demographic predictors, age was significantly associated with simultaneous\nengagement in sexual intercourse and alcohol consumption (OR = .66, p < .05), indicating adolescents\nwho were younger were more likely to participate in these two behaviours.\nInternational Journal of Adolescence and Youth 7\nWe also tested network centrality measures such as degree, density and Bonacich power, and found\nout-degree and betweenness to be associated with engaging in these behaviours (sex and drinking\nalcohol) in School 1. Engaging in sex and drinking alcohol simultaneously was significantly predicted\nby out-degree (students named others as a friend: OR = 1.39, p < .05) in this friendship network, indicat-\ning adolescents who named more friends were more likely to have an increased engagement in these\nFigure 1.

Additionally, betweenness (the fraction of the shortest path between students: OR = 1.01;\np < .05) was significantly related with engagement in risky behaviours (sexual intercourse and drinking\nalcohol in tandem), indicating students who were connected through a short path with others exhibiting\nrisky behaviours were more likely to engage in these risky behaviours, themselves.\nIn School 2, engagement in risky behaviours (sex and alcohol consumption simultaneously) was\nsignificantly predicted by gender (OR = .46, p < .05), indicating male students were more likely to have\nFigure 2. Network of adolescents who did not engage in sexual intercourse and alcohol drinking in tandem, within Schools 1 and\n2 from the Add Health data-set.\nInternational Journal of Adolescence and Youth 9\nincreased involvement in risky behaviours. Moreover, age (OR = 1.43, p < .05) was another significant\npredictor, indicating students who were older were more likely to engage in sexual intercourse and\ndrinking alcohol at the same time. In contrast with the results from School 1, none of the network\ncentrality measures for the School 2 sample had a statistically significant relationship with adolescents'\nsexual intercourse and drinking in tandem.\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we were interested in the influence of friendship network structures upon adolescents'\nrisky health behaviours, specifically the simultaneous behaviours of sexual intercourse and alcohol\nconsumption. Utilizing SNA, we identified three predictors (i.e. age, out-degree and betweenness) in\nSchool 1and 2 predictors (i.e. gender and age) in School 2. These factors were significantly associated\nwith risky behaviours (sexual intercourse and drinking alcohol in tandem) among adolescents in our\nsample. Our results indicated that (a) the structure of friendship relationships (i.e. out-degree and\nbetweenness) among students was related to an increased risk for engaging in these behaviours in one\nschool, but not in the other; and (b) demographic attributes (i.e. age and gender) also varied by school.\nIn School 1 \u00ad as shown inTable 1 describing the characteristic of the sample \u00ad the sample size is rel-\natively smaller (n = 324) than School 2 (n = 577), but, the friendship network in School 1 shows a larger\nnumber of connections (denser network) among adolescents sampled than School 2 (as depicted in\nFigure 1, School 1 had147 ties in the `yes'group). School 2 displays a friendship network with sparser\nconnections (also in Figure 1: School 2 had 41 ties in the `yes' group). This suggests that in this study,\nat least, tightly bound friendship networks in smaller schools with single race/ethnicity (School 1) may\ncarry higher risk of engagement in sexual intercourse and alcohol consumption in tandem. On the other\nhand, more diffused (spread out) networks in larger schools with more diverse race/ethnicity (School 2)\nseem to pose less risk of engaging in these two risk behaviours simultaneously. This finding suggests\nthat, counterintuitively, larger networks may pose less risk, depending on how densely connected its\nmembers are.\nWith respect to network attributes (i.e. out-degree and betweenness), out-degree refers to the\nnumber of friendship nominations teens made (Valente, 2010). In this study, the out-degree attribute\nin School 1was correlated with an increased risk of engaging in sexual intercourse and alcohol con-\nsumption simultaneously. As defined earlier, out-degree refers to the nominations made by a study\nparticipant (or the number of ties that stem from a node in the directed network; in the case of friend-\nship networks: a measure of gregariousness); in-degree refers to the nominations received by a study\nparticipant (in the case of friendship networks, a measure of popularity) (Valente, 2010). In our sample,\nstudents who nominate others rather than receive nominations from others appear to influence their\npeers' behaviours within their friendship network. This may indicate that, potentially, these students\nTable 3. Logistic regression analysis of predictors of sexual intercourse and alcohol consumption in tandem: demographic and\nnetwork centrality characteristics as predictors.\nNote: Odd Ratio (OR), Standard Errors (SE), and upper and lower 95% Confidence Intervals (CI).\nDemographic predictors\nNetwork predictors\n10  K. C. Jeon and P. Goodson\nactively seek contact with other students in order to embed into friendship networks. Similar to our\nfinding, the study conducted by Fujimoto andValente (2012a) identified that students who nominated\nothers were more likely to influence their friends'smoking and drinking behaviours, than adolescents\nwho were nominated by others.\nBetweenness is another attribute of a network, referring to the number of times an adolescent\nlies on the shortest paths linking other adolescents in the network (Borgatti et al., 2013). We included\nbetweenness centrality because it can be an indirect measure of network flow or influence spread\namong adolescents. Betweenness also allows us to identify individuals who would possibly exert control\nover others, within the network.\nIn this study, the betweenness attribute was significantly related with engagement in sexual inter-\ncourse and drinking alcohol in School 1. This relationship potentially indicates that individuals in the\nnetwork are likely to be influenced by the risky behaviours of friends or exert influence toward risky\nbehaviours on others, because they are connected by a greater number of geodesic paths. Additionally,\nit may be possible that there are individual adolescents with higher betweenness in the network, so they\ncontrol or influence behaviour or information flow serving as gatekeepers among the other adolescents\n(Ennett et al., 2006). Supporting this finding, a study conducted by Ennett et al. (2008) assessed the\nrelationship between peer attributes and adolescents'smoking utilising SNA. Authors found there was a\nsignificant correlation between friend's cigarette use and betweenness centrality: higher betweenness\ncentrality was related to an increased risk for engaging in smoking behaviour.\nWhile these two network attributes (out-degree and betweenness centrality) were associated with\nrisky behaviours (sex and drinking alcohol simultaneously) in School 1, no effects for network structure\nwere found in School 2.\nConsistent with previous research on adolescents'risky health behaviours and peer influence, we did\nfind that adolescents'age was associated with an increased risk for involvement in sexual intercourse\nand simultaneous alcohol consumption. In School 1, adolescents who were younger were more likely\nto have engaged in these risky behaviours; conversely, in School 2, teens who were older were more\nlikely to participate in those behaviours. In other words, being young, within certain structures, may\nentail protection. On the other hand, being young, within different structures, may lead to risk. A study\nby Ali and Dwyer (2011) assessed the association between peer friendship networks and adolescent's\nsexual behaviour.The authors documented that older adolescents enrolled in higher grades were more\nlikely to have had sexual intercourse and multiple sexual partners.\nRegarding gender, surprisingly, we did not find any effect in School 1. Even when we calculated\na logistic regression model including only demographic variables and no network attributes, the\nresults did not show gender as having a positive relationship with the risky behaviours in that school\n(OR = .642, p = .166). However, in School 2, male teens were more likely to have engaged in the two\nrisky behaviours we assessed, compared with female teens. It is possible that male adolescents within\nthis present friendship network may show particularly high susceptibility toward risky behaviours. It\nmay also indicate that male teens may get an earlier start to engage in risky behaviours than females\nin this study. Reasons explaining why gender was a significant predictor in School 2, but not in School\n1, are not clear. Findings indicated that, for School 1 study participants, knowledge about the structure\nof their networks supersedes knowledge about individual students'gender. In other words, for School\n1, if attempting to predict engagement in sexual intercourse and alcohol consumption (in tandem),\nhaving information about the network would be more valuable than information on gender. For School\n2, because the network structure had no association with the behaviours, knowing the students'gender\nbecomes more valuable predictive information than their network structures.\nWe did find in one school that adolescents'friendship network characteristics can influence theirs\nand their friends'risky behaviours, within certain contexts.These findings are in line with network the-\nory because the theory proposes that network properties (such as network centralities, such as degree\nor density) represent mechanisms that can affect outcomes of interest (Fredericks & Durland, 2005).\nMoreover, our findings suggest the underlying causes of tie formation (i.e. out-degree and betweenness)\namong adolescents can influence the risky behaviours of other adolescents in the network. Therefore,\nInternational Journal of Adolescence and Youth 11\nthese findings can provide an additional layer of understanding and greater insight into the overall\ninfluence of friendship networks on adolescents'risky behaviours.\nWhen examining risky behaviours of adolescents (e.g. smoking or drinking alcohol), previous studies\nhave found evidence that intra-personal factors (e.g. attitudes or beliefs) and the relationships among\nadolescents (inter-personal factors) are significantly correlated with teens'risky behaviours. Such find-\nings indicate that adolescents' risky behaviours can be influenced by friendships or by observation\nof other teens' behaviours. Jessor's PBT helps explain this phenomenon as it proposes that problem\nbehaviours can be explained from the perspective of three major systems acting upon each other:\nsocio-psychological variables, such as families (i.e. parents or siblings) or friends'behaviours (perceived\nenvironment system) may affect the adolescents' beliefs or attitudes (personality system) that may\npredispose individual adolescents toward risky behaviours (behaviour system) (Donovan, Jessor, &\nCosta, 1991; Jessor, 1987). Therefore, PBT as a conceptual framework can help clarify the mechanisms\nthrough which adolescent ties can influence their behaviour.\nOur study makes an important contribution to the literature on adolescent health promotion\nbecause it examines engagement in two risk behaviours, simultaneously (sexual intercourse and\ndrinking alcohol in tandem), and approaches this examination from a friendship network perspec-\ntive. Nonetheless, despite its contributions, this study contains important limitations: (1) we did\nnot include any intra-personal variables such as attitudes, norms or beliefs, in our analyses; and (2)\nwe only assessed one-time period (Wave I). Further analyses might include intra-personal factors\nas control variables, to better tease out the potential effects of network structure(s). Also benefi-\ncial would be to examine multiple points in time (e.g. Waves I and II) in order to provide a better\nunderstanding of the changes in behaviour and in network composition/structure resulting from\nthe influence of friends who engage in risky behaviours. A third limitation regards our findings\nand their different patterns for School 1 and 2. Given the differences, the findings may not gen-\neralise to a more contemporary sample. Lastly, the Add Health data-set is based on self-reported\ninformation and carries with it the potential errors in recall and reporting intrinsic to this type of\ninquiry. Generalisation, again, should be avoided.\nRecommendations for researchers and health promoters\nDespite these limitations, this study suggests that denser friendship ties, coupled with specific network\ncharacteristics (i.e. out-degree and betweenness) among students in a smaller school may be associated\nwith prevalence of engagement in sexual intercourse and alcohol consumption simultaneously, as\ncompared to a lager school. Age and gender were also found to have an association, although gender\nwas not a factor in one of the schools. These findings have implications for future research and for the\ndevelopment of health promotion programs for adolescents.\nRegarding research, we believe future studies should employ SNA to examine adolescents' risky\nbehaviours, but they should also include multi-level data (intrapersonal, interpersonal and school char-\nacteristics). Researchers should, whenever feasible, use longitudinal data to understand the mechanisms\nthrough which friendship networks lead adolescents to change their behaviours (Kobus, 2003). Also\nvaluable is examining multiple co-occurring behaviours, whenever possible, given that risk behaviours\nrarely occur in isolation.\nFinally, when designing health promotion programs for adolescents, health promoters should con-\nsider designing programs directed at networks of adolescents, especially dense friendship networks\n(Haynie, 2001). Given that most of these networks are school bound, this approach only requires a\nshift in perspective \u00ad from an individual-centred intervention, to a network-centred one. Moreover,\nwhen designing programs to target adolescent networks, health promoters should attempt to learn\nabout the composition/characteristics of the networks and identify individual adolescents with high\nbetweenness centrality \u00ad these teens may become valuable peer leaders or gatekeepers and influence\nmany others in the network (Ennett et al., 2006). Working with these teens might be an efficient way\nto promote the health of the entire network.\n12  K. C. Jeon and P. Goodson\n"
