It generated (alongside survey data, n=16,935) a number of large qualitative\ndata sets2 from 30 locations in 14 languages. In summarising research findings across loca-\ntions,3 while the survey team was able to employ a standard variable-based comparative\nanalysis strategy, the qualitative researchers struggled to identify a model for analysis that\nwould meet the need to speak beyond the individual `case'whilst not rooting the aspiration\nto generalisability in false claims to representativeness.\nThis article suggests a potential solution to this dilemma in the adaptation of the meta-\nethnographic approach for the synthesis of primary data. Qualitative synthesis approaches\n\u00ad of which `meta-ethnography' is the most frequently employed (Hannes and Macaitis,\n2012: 430)4 \u00ad have, to date, been applied primarily to the synthesis of published studies.\nThis article suggests there is potential for the meta-ethnographic approach to be employed\nin the synthesis of primary qualitative data from multiple cases in large multi-location or\ntransnational research projects. This method may be of particular interest to qualitative\nresearchers working in large EU funded projects where the imperative to reap the `value\nadded' of a Europe-wide research project is often in tension with the epistemological\nprinciple of retaining local language and context (central to understanding the phenom-\nenon studied) and the organisational reality that the research is often conducted simulta-\nneously across the European space but relatively discretely by nationally based teams. It\nis an approach, however, that could be applied to a broader range of multi-sited qualita-\ntive studies.\nThe article first sets out the core epistemological and methodological arguments\nunderpinning the adaptation of meta-ethnography for the synthesis of primary qualitative\ndata. Although meta-ethnography is currently employed primarily as an alternative to\nsystematic review for published qualitative studies, its use in the synthesis of primary\ndata is not precluded in its original formulation (see Noblit and Hare, 1988). Moreover,\nits potential use for analysing multiple, transnational ethnographic studies is timely as\nethnographers seek to accommodate the increasingly transnational nature of ethnogra-\nphy through the development of multi-sited ethnography (Marcus, 1995, 2011) and iden-\ntify ways to `extract the general from the unique' through the development of the\nIt is not the intention to set out here an alternative method for the analysis of all large\nqualitative data sets; there are numerous robust methods for coding, analysing and inter-\npreting primary qualitative data. Rather, this article draws on existing approaches includ-\ning classic (Glaser and Strauss, 1967) and revised (Strauss and Corbin, 1998) versions of\ngrounded theory and `multi-grounded theory' (Goldkuhl and Cronholm, 2010). These\nmethods underpin the now standard qualitative data analysis techniques of open, axial\nand selective coding and present different models for generating and engaging theoreti-\ncal concepts in the interpretative process. The approach developed here also draws on the\nepistemological rationale for generalizing from the unique set out by Burawoy (1998) in\nhis `extended case method' and the empirical imperative to `follow' the object of obser-\nvation since, in our globalised and networked world, it is increasingly present simultane-\nously in (or travels across) different locations (Marcus, 1995). What is new in the\napproach outlined in this article is its specific concern with the interpretation of the\nfindings of multiple research studies,5 each conducted in their own linguistic and cultural\ncontexts and coded and analysed independently by discrete, nationally based, research\nteams. It seeks to address in this way a growing need for qualitative research methods\ncapable of synthesising the findings of a multiple, linked (but not strictly comparatively\ndesigned) case studies generated by large, transnational qualitative research projects.\nThe article outlines the practical process of adapting meta-ethnography to primary\ndata analysis for the synthesis of 44 ethnographic cases of youth activism, relating the\nprocess to key stages described in other published studies. This is followed by a worked\nexample of the translation6 of cases and the resulting `line of argument' that emerged\nfrom the synthesis of research findings on the question of how young people interpret the\norganisations in which they are active. Finally the challenges and limitations of the\napproach are outlined, focusing on the concern that, in extracting the general from the\nspecific, the key quality of qualitative data \u00ad individual differentiation \u00ad is diminished.\nMeasures are suggested to ensure the `ethnography' in meta-ethnography is not lost.\nFrom systematic review to conceptual innovation: the\nprinciples of meta-ethnography\nQualitative synthesis approaches are employed most frequently in the field of health-\ncare studies to review the research evidence base in relation to particular approaches,\ninterventions or patient responses. Thus, although applied specifically to qualitative\nresearch studies, this form of synthesis has been developed in the spirit of the `system-\natic review' used for the evaluation of statistical data to facilitate policy decisions about\n`what works' (Dixon-Woods, 2006). Published studies demonstrate the value of the\nqualitative synthesis approach for ensuring the best clinical treatments are promoted\n(Campbell et al., 2011: 1) and preventing the reinvention of the wheel through conduct-\ning isolated qualitative studies without adequate reference to existing literature\nThis explains why much of the reflection on qualitative synthesis to date has focused\non: search techniques and selection procedures that ensure the inclusion of all relevant\ntools for evaluating the quality of studies (Barnett-Page and Thomas, 2009; Kuper et al.,\nnumber of studies to be synthesised (Toye et al., 2014). It has led also to criticism that\nmeta-synthesis can slide into statistically rooted approaches of meta-analysis (Booth,\nSynthesis is not, by definition, concerned with the `what works' approach of evi-\ndence-based policy and practice, however; its origins lie in the building of cumulative\nbodies of knowledge in the interests of conceptual and theoretical advancement (Weed,\n2008: 26). It is rooted in an interpretative approach, which recognises that general rele-\nvance can emerge from theoretical inference as well as empirical generalisation (Gomm\net al., 2000: 103). From this perspective, generalisability is not exclusively the property\nof statistically secured representativeness but achievable through `idiographic generali-\nextracted from rich descriptions of individual cases is viewed as transferable to other\nthus be understood as the integration of a set of parts that leads to `some degree of con-\nceptual innovation, or employment of concepts not found in the characterisation of the\nIn order to make the case that the principles of meta-ethnography are not incompatible\nwith its application to primary data it is first necessary to establish what distinguishes\nqualitative synthesis approaches from secondary data analysis. Underlying this distinc-\ntion is a differentiation between aggregation or `pooling' of the findings of separate\nqualitative studies (Sandelowski et al., 1997) and interpretation of existing interpreta-\ntions (arising out of qualitative data) in the interests of developing or refining concepts\nand theory. Thus Campbell et al. (2011: ix) characterise qualitative synthesis as either\n`integrative' (where data from primary studies are comparable and can be aggregated\noften through quantitative analysis) or `interpretative'(in which concepts emerge through\na process of induction). Thus, like secondary analysis, qualitative synthesis involves re-\ninterpretation but, unlike secondary analysis, it is applied to published findings rather\nis placed within the `interpretative synthesis' category and considered capable of gener-\nating conceptual innovation in the form of a new interpretation or theory that goes\nbeyond the findings of any individual study (Campbell et al., 2011: 8). The process is\ndescribed by Campbell et al. (2011) as one in which `the synthesis builds interpretation\nfrom original studies by firstly identifying interpretations offered by the original research-\ners (second-order constructs) and, secondly, enabling the development of new interpreta-\ntions (third-order constructs) that go beyond those offered in individual primary studies'\nWhile these distinctions ostensibly draw a clear line between meta-ethnography and\nsecondary data analysis, the latter may be regarded as a form of interpretive synthesis if\nit involves multiple qualitative data sets and is conducted with the aim of providing a\nmoreover, suggest that there is no absolute distinction between the two enterprises since\n`as description itself demands interpretation, it might be more useful to see aggregative\nand interpretive approaches as two poles on a continuum rather than two distinct\napproaches'.\nThe adaptation of the meta-ethnographic approach for the MYPLACE project is a\ncase in which secondary data analysis might be regarded as a form of interpretive syn-\nthesis. That very few examples of such analysis have been published to date (and those\nthat have mainly involve the re-analysis of researchers' own data) may be for practical\nmethodological rather than fundamental epistemological reasons including: the ethical\nissues involved in reusing data for a purpose other than originally specified; the lack of\nfamiliarity with data collected by other researchers; and variations in research design\nacross different studies (Campbell et al., 2011: 8). These problems are avoided or mini-\nmised in the MYPLACE meta-ethnographic synthesis because the data were collected\nwithin the framework of a single project governed by common ethical protocols, research\ninstruments and analysis strategy. This has some precedent in the field since Noblit and\nHare's (1988: 39) worked examples of synthesis included Noblit's own studies.\nThe exclusion of primary data from qualitative synthesis is rooted in the statement\nthat `the data of synthesis are interpretations and explanations rather than the data col-\nlected through interviews and observations' (Noblit and Hare, 1988: 32). This logic, it is\nsuggested here, makes more rigid a distinction between `data' and their `interpretation'\nthan qualitative research warrants. In practice, published articles based on qualitative\ndata frequently employ concepts that are `grounded' in understandings articulated\ndirectly by respondents while `primary' qualitative data consist of respondents' under-\nstandings and interpretations of the world. Meta-ethnography is understood here, there-\nfore, as `the synthesis of interpretative research' (Noblit and Hare, 1988: 10) that might\nbe applied in a variety of ways from conducting `interpretivist literature reviews'through\n`the systematic comparison of case studies to draw cross-case conclusions' to construct-\ning `a synthesis of ethnographic studies' (Noblit and Hare, 1988: 11\u00ad13). In the follow-\ning section, it is demonstrated how such a synthesis of ethnographic case studies can be\nconducted on the basis of primary data sets.\nA key challenge for meta-ethnographic synthesis is that, in contrast to positivist\napproaches, which seek to minimize and/or control for context effects, a reflexive social\nscience starts from the premise that `context is not noise disguising reality but reality\nitself' (Burawoy, 1998: 13). While this is not the place to review developments in the\nfield of ethnography more generally, it is important to recognise that its direction of\ntravel is convergent with that of meta-ethnography in two important ways. Firstly, there\nis an increasing recognition of the need to move beyond the single case study and to\nreflect the transnational and mobile nature of the `thing' studied through `multi-sited\nethnography' that goes beyond `conventional controlled comparison' in anthropology\n(Marcus, 1995: 102). This is important for the purposes of meta-ethnography in that it\nrecognises the potential `unevenness'(`thick'but also `thin') of cases (Marcus, 2011: 21)\nand a move towards collective research practices (Marcus, 2011: 22). Secondly, develop-\nments in the ethnographic method have called for researchers to `extend out' from the\nfield in a way that allows a form of generalisation to which meta-ethnography also\naspires. This is a particular concern of Burawoy (1998: 5) who proposes an `extended\ncase method' that allows the extraction `of the general from the unique'. While for\nBurawoy this is achieved primarily through the forefronting of pre-existing theory, the\nrecognition within his `reflexive social science' of the possibility, and desirability, of\ngeneralisation from single ethnographic cases is consistent with the principles of meta-\nethnography. Notwithstanding the danger of the `dilution' of the particular, it is argued\nbelow that the application of meta-ethnography to primary data rather than published\nstudies allows for the retention of context and `thick description'.\nApplying meta-ethnography to primary data: practical\nsteps\nIn the MYPLACE project, meta-ethnography was adapted to primary data analysis in the\nsynthesis of 44 ethnographic cases of youth activism in 14 countries.8 The MYPLACE\nproject as a whole did not employ a strict comparative design but a case study approach\nthat prioritised the retention of context (Pilkington and Pollock, 2015a: 21\u00ad28). In this\ncontext, ethnographic case studies (three per country) were selected from those induc-\ntively identified by national research teams as reflecting locally and nationally relevant\nforms of youth activism. The ethnographies were designed to explore the meanings\nattached to activism among young people engaged in organisations and movements\nranging from student self-organisation and youth sections of political parties through\nanarchist and Occupy groups to radical right wing movements. Cases were grouped in\nsix thematic clusters of between six and nine cases: radical right and patriotic move-\nments; anti-capitalist/anti-racist/anti-fascist movements; anti-austerity/Occupy move-\nments; gender and minority rights movements; youth sections of political, labour and\nstate-sponsored organisations; and religion-based organisations. Case studies located at\nthe intersection of clusters were included in both relevant clusters (indicated in Table 1\nby the use of italics in the `secondary' cluster).\nThe synthesis of cases was rooted in the seven-stage process outlined by Noblit and\nHare (1988: 26\u00ad29) guided by practical reflections on its implementation in Britten et al.\n(2002). The application of the method to primary data rather than published studies\nrequired significant adaptation of the early stages of the meta-ethnographic process since\nstudies did not need to be selected and were already familiar. The outcome was a five-\nstage process (see Text Box 1) discussed below in two parts: the construction of the data\nset (Stages 1\u00ad3); and the synthesis process (Stages 4\u00ad5).\nConstructing the data set\nIn contrast to the complex selection protocols discussed in other meta-ethnographies, the\nboundaries of the data set for this synthesis were determined by the MYPLACE study\n(see Table 1).\nFull methodological details of the studies are beyond the scope of this article (see\nPilkington, 2014; Pilkington and Mizen, 2015) but it should be noted that researchers\nworked to an agreed framework and guidelines for what constituted an ethnographic\ncase study rather than micro-methodological instructions. This meant that studies var-\nied in type \u00ad particularly in their use of classic `participant observation' or more `vir-\ntual' (internet or social media based) modes of ethnography \u00ad and each employed a\nunique combination of fieldwork techniques (including semi or unstructured interviews,\nfield diaries, informal conversations, documentary materials and visual images). This\nmeant that an important early stage of the process was a scoping of the data during\nwhich synthesisers familiarised themselves with the relative `thickness' or `thinness' of\naccounts in each case.\nThese case studies were analysed discretely and published as individual case reports,9\nwhich constituted potential units for meta-ethnographic synthesis.

(Continued)\nretaining as much `ethnography' in meta-ethnography as possible, however, data sets\nincluding elements of the primary data were constructed for each study. This was imple-\nmented through the production of two sets of `memos \u00ad `node memos' and `respondent\nmemos' \u00ad which, together with the case study reports, constituted the data sets for the\nsynthesis of cases at cluster level. Node memos and respondent memos were written fol-\nlowing the coding of the primary data for each case study and provided researcher gener-\nated summaries of the thematic codes (`node10 memos') and individual respondents\n(`respondent memos'). Coding was conducted employing standard methods of open,\naxial and selective coding facilitated by the use of Nvivo 9.2 software.11 Researchers\nwere asked to code, in the first instance, to a maximum of two hierarchical levels. Codes\nwere assigned in the language of the interviews; this retained the subtle meanings and\ncultural cues which would have been lost if initial coding had been conducted on inter-\nviews translated into English (Team members, 2006: 59). The lowest hierarchical level\nof coding was named `Level 1 nodes'; these were open codes expressing respondents'\nown views, accounts, descriptions and interpretations of their experiences. The guide-\nlines provided to researchers stated that Level 1 nodes should include attitudes, reflec-\ntions, opinions, emotions or meanings attached to phenomena by respondents but should\nnot include coders'own evaluation of such attitudes.12 Researchers were also encouraged\nto keep as close as possible to the expressions of respondents when creating Level 1\nnodes and illustrative quotes in English were included in the node memo to allow the\nsynthesiser to feel the texture of the primary data.At the second hierarchical level, `Level\n2 nodes' grouped Level 1 nodes through a process of axial coding. This often generated\nrather descriptive categories (such as `forms of activism' or `political views') in contrast\nto the more `authentic' Level 1 nodes.\nOnce coding at these two initial levels was complete, researchers created `node\nmemos' in English for each case study. Node memos are thematic memos generated in\nthe form of simple Word documents for each Level 2 node and consist of the descriptions\nof the content of Level 2 nodes and their constituent Level 1 nodes as well as illustrative\nquotes for each Level 1 node. Node memos also included a summary of the context of\nthe generation of the Level 2 node (including particular theoretical paradigms drawn on\nor important contextual factors such as historical or political events). These node memos\nconstituted the primary objects of synthesis and in some cases ran to more than 30 pages.\nIn addition, `respondent memos' were generated in English for each individual respond-\nent,13 providing a reference point for the main socio-demographic characteristics of the\nrespondent and other contextual information of relevance to the interpretation of the\ndata. Illustrative examples of node and respondent memos can be found in Pilkington\nand Mizen (2015: 10\u00ad24). The data sets constructed for synthesis are thus far from `raw'\ndata. They consisted of respondents' accounts and interpretations of their views and\nactions, articulated as close to their original expression as possible, alongside research-\ners' interpretations (in the process of coding and node memo production) of these\ninterpretations.\nFinally, five questions were agreed to guide the synthesis. While in meta-ethnogra-\nphies of published studies, the definition of the area of interest is usually the first stage\nof synthesis, in this study, the broad area of interest had been pre-defined in the Work\nPackage description as `interpreting activism' by `understanding the meanings young\npeople attach to their activism'. For the purposes of synthesis, this needed to be narrowed\nand, following a preliminary reading of the materials in their cluster level data sets, five\nquestions14 were agreed by the researchers involved in the synthesis with the anticipation\nthat between five and ten concepts (constructs, metaphors) would emerge in each cluster\nin relation to each question.\nThe synthesis process\nThe building blocks of the meta-ethnographic approach are the second-order concepts\nand metaphors and `third-order' interpretations that are generated (Britten et al., 2002:\nin the published literature (Malpass et al., 2009: 158) although there is consensus on the\nunderlying process:\nMeta-ethnography involves identifying key concepts from studies and translating them into one\nanother. The term `translating' in this context refers to the process of taking concepts from one\nstudy and recognising the same concepts in another study, though they may not be expressed\nusing identical words. Explanations or theories associated with these concepts are also extracted\nand a `line of argument' is developed which pulls these concepts together and, crucially, goes\nbeyond the content of the original studies. (Thomas and Harden, 2008: 5)\nThe synthesis of ethnographic case studies of youth activism outlined here was under-\ntaken in two stages: the translation of the meanings of one case into another (producing\nsecond-order `concepts'); and the generation of `third-order' interpretations.\nThe translation process in this study was not of concepts extracted from published\nliterature but respondents' own interpretations as coded, categorised, contextualised and\ninterpreted in node memos, respondent memos and case study reports. These materials\nwere read repeatedly in the process of the translation of the meanings of one case into\nanother, where necessary clarifying context and interpretation with the field researchers.\nThis process was facilitated by creating a table (adapted from Britten et al., 2002) to\nrecord and describe the emergent second-order concepts. Table 2 provides an illustration\nof such a table constructed from the translation of cases in Cluster 1 (Radical right and\npatriotic movements) in relation to the first of the five guiding questions (`How do young\npeople inhabit, interpret and own their organisations?'). This table illustrates one of five\nconcepts \u00ad `an organisation of the people' \u00ad that emerged in the process of translating\nrespondents' interpretations of the organisations in which they were active in the nine\ncases included in this cluster. As Malpass et al., (2009: 158) note, the use of the term\n`translation' indicates that, at this stage, the synthesiser is comparing concepts, each\ninfused with its own interpretation, and thus engaged in an interpretive `reading' of\nmeaning, but not further conceptual development. Indeed, in this case `an organisation of\nthe people' is a respondent's interpretation, into which the meanings of other cases could\nbe reciprocally translated.\nNoblit and Hare (1988: 36) propose three forms of translation: cases are directly com-\nparable as `reciprocal' translations; cases stand in opposition to each other and are thus\n`refutational'; cases are diverse but, taken together, represent a `line of argument' rather\nTable 2.

All three kinds of translation were antici-\npated in the analyses conducted for MYPLACE and this is indicated in the concept\ntables. The concept `an organisation of the people' emerged as a mainly reciprocal trans-\nlation although refutational or partially refutational cases are also recorded and indicated\nby italic font (see Table 2). In practice, a single meta-ethnography may include all three\nthe case of the meta-ethnographic syntheses outlined here, the diversity of the data meant\nthat the end product was usually `a line of argument' developed on the basis of the recip-\nrocal translation of cases but taking account of refutational or partially refutational cases.\nAn illustrative example of such a line of argument is presented below.\nThe final stage of analysis is the generation of `third-order' interpretations. This stage\nremains the most opaque in existing literature since it involves determining what additional\ninsight is brought to the research questions through the synthesis of cases and it is the stage\nleast open to procedural systematisation. Recognising the danger of overstating the capac-\nity of third-level interpretations to give rise to `a new order of understanding' (Lee et al.,\n2015: 347), the aim here was to generate a qualitative synthesis that extends knowledge\nover and above the sum of the individual case studies included in the study whilst recognis-\ning that it may also be that no new insight emerges (Campbell et al., 2011: 119). This\nreflects also the relationship between theory and method underpinning the MYPLACE\napproach, which diverges from Noblit and Hare's (1988: 37) aim to induce `grounded'\ntheory, in favour of Burawoy's (2003: 647) insistence on the `necessity of bringing theory\nConcept: `An organisation of the people' Indicative quotes\nTorcida Torcida has no leader; this would\nbe antithetical to its culture.\nINT: Could you say he was the\nleader?\nDIOKLETIAN: No, Torcida never\nhad one leader, and never will [...]\nyou just can't make that type of\nhierarchy here.\n(True) Finns This is a partially refutational case.\nActivists recognise the necessity of\nhaving a `charismatic leader' but\nalso express concern that this breeds\ndictatorial tendencies.\n`Of course Soini [the leader of the Finns\nparty] has moved the party forward well\nand is a charismatic and well-known\nperson, but he has a lot of features of a\ndictator sometimes.

The fact that such concepts\nwere identified by this synthesis among patriotic and radical right activists\nchallenges literature that suggests organisations of the extreme right\ntend towards a hierarchical structure with individual (usually male) and\ncharismatic leaders.\nTable 2. (Continued)\nto the field'. Theory is essential to interpretation and knowledge production and is envis-\naged as being revised, refined or `reconstructed' rather than generated anew. Drawing on\nGoldkuhl and Cronholm's (2010) explication of a `multi-grounded theory' approach,\ninductive coding at the first two levels of analysis was followed by a process of `theoretical\nmatching'and validation against both data and existing theoretical frameworks at the third\nor interpretative level.15 The third-level interpretations were recorded at the bottom of each\nconcept emerging from the translation (see Table 2) and it is the synthesis of these third\nlevel interpretations that produces the line of argument.\nIn this study, translation was carried out primarily as a synthesis of the individual case\nstudies in each of the six clusters (as stipulated in the original research design).\nSubsequently, however, a synthesis across clusters was conducted of concepts of particu-\nlar interest to produce a `line of argument' translation based on all 44 cases.\nDispersed leadership: a worked example of meta-\nethnographic synthesis using primary data\nThe transnational analysis of MYPLACE ethnographic data was designed for implemen-\ntation at cluster level. However, a more limited `synthesis of the syntheses' was con-\nducted across clusters consisting in the identification of the second-order concepts\nemerging in each cluster and their translation into one another. Table 3 provides an over-\nview16 of the concepts extracted from cluster syntheses for the question `How do young\npeople inhabit, interpret and own their organisations?' The concept `an organisation of\nthe people' derived from the Cluster 1synthesis described above, for example, can be\nseen in the top left hand box of Table 3. This process revealed a possible reciprocal syn-\nthesis of concepts related to leadership and hierarchy (see Table 3, row 1) and was\nexpressed through a new concept of `dispersed leadership'. However, there were also\nrefutational cases (Table 3, italic font) as well as diversity within some cases (especially\nCluster 6). After further testing against data (returning to the case study materials) and\nagainst theories suggesting `horizontality' and `non-hierarchy' are associated tradition-\nally with left-wing, anarchist and radical democratic movements (Purkis, 2001), a line of\nargument was developed and expressed in the concept of `dispersed leadership'.\n`Dispersed leadership' emerged from a reciprocal translation of the concepts of `an\norganisation of the people', `unofficial leadership', `leaderless and horizontal move-\nments'and `blurry leadership'derived from the synthesis of cases in Clusters 1\u00ad4 respec-\ntively. It is epitomised by cases in Cluster 3 where young activists in local Occupy\nmovements in Denmark and the UK demonstrated a self-conscious rejection of organisa-\ntional hierarchies and the representative principle of decision-making in favour of lead-\nerless, horizontal and directly representative democratic organisations. The commitment\nto leaderless and horizontal movements was described as the `golden thread' (LO, GB)17\nuniting the Occupy movement but was found across a broad range of anti-austerity\nmovements included in the cluster (Mizen, 2015: 18\u00ad19). However, the synthesis of\ncases across clusters revealed that the concept of `leaderless' movements connotes not\nthe absence of leadership but its dispersal (Wadia, 2015: 12). This is expressed in\nrespondents' interpretations of the movements in which they were active as organised\nsuch that `we are all leaders' (Wadia, 2015: 12\u00ad16) or `decisions are taken by all of us\nTable 3. `Dispersed leadership': synthesising the syntheses.\nRow Cluster 1:\nRadical right\nand patriotic\nmovements\nCluster 2:\nAnti-capitalist\n/anti-racist/\nanti-fascist\nmovements\nCluster 3 :\nAnti-austerity/\nOccupy\nmovements\nCluster 4 :\nGender and\nminority rights\nmovements\nCluster 5:\nYouth sections\nof political,\nlabour and\nstate-sponsored\norganisations\nCluster 6:\nReligion based\norganisations\ndo young\npeople inhabit,\ninterpret and\nown their\norganisations?\norganisation of\nthe people\nUnofficial\nleadership\nLeaderless\nand horizontal\nmovements\nBlurry leadership:\n`we are all leaders'\nHierarchy and\ncompetition: `Big\ndivisions can appear\nbefore an election'\nWithin cluster\nvariation: from\n`strong control' by\nleader to `decisions\nare taken by all of us\ntogether'\n2 All for one and\none for all\nSense of\nbelonging\nGrassroots\nmovements\nA place where you\nbelong\n`Committed' versus.\n`social members'\nCritique of the\norganisation\n3 Not racist Not `that kind\nof' extremists\nOrganisations\nand movements\nas assemblies\nLooking in from the\noutside\n`We have our own\nsubjectivity': Relation\nto the parent\norganisation\nParticipation in\nadministration\nFunctioning with\nand against the\norganisation: disputes\n4 Open to all Between a social\nmovement and a\npolitical party\nOpen\nmovements\nGaining human\ncapital: `They taught\nme how to think\nand [...] gave me\nan important social\nnetwork too'\nRecruitment through\ncontacts (family and\nfriends)\nEfficacy of the\norganisation's work\nCollaborating with\nother organisations\n5 Investing in the\nfuture\nUncertain futures Career opportunities Extra-organisational\nactivities\ntogether' (Sakellariou, 2015: 11). This generates a collective responsibility, accountabil-\nity and efficacy articulated in interpretations of movements as governed not by hierarchy\nbut equal opportunities to make suggestions, act and express opinions (Litvina, 2015:\n13). In this way, leadership is not negated but `blurred'. This emerges especially in the\ncase of gender and minority rights organisations where blurred lines of leadership serve\nboth to resist conventional authority and hierarchy and to evade attempts by hostile\nauthorities to neutralise or `decapitate' movements (Wadia, 2015: 13). Such `blurring' is\nidentified also among anti-capitalist, anti-racist and anti-fascist movements where activ-\nists identify a kind of `unofficial leadership' based on an informal hierarchy rooted in\nThe line of argument developed here emerged to accommodate, on the one hand, refu-\ntational cases and, on the other, the unanticipated reciprocal translation of cases. At clus-\nter level, the refutational case is that of Youth sections of formal political, labour and\nstate-sponsored organisations (Cluster 5) since in these organisations, positions within\nthe organisation are determined often by democratic elections, leading to competition\nbetween members for clearly defined leadership positions (Hashem-Wangler, 2015: 12\u00ad\n13). In contrast, among the Radical right and patriotic movements studied, four of the\nnine organisations were interpreted by their members as `leaderless' despite suggestions\nin existing literature, that, following the dominant understanding of populist radical right\norganisations as a `normal pathology' (Mudde, 2007: 297), organisations in this cluster\nwere likely to be characterised by hierarchical structures and charismatic leadership\nDawn (GR), which prides itself on `absolute discipline and faith in its leadership'\n(Pilkington, 2015: 17); invoking the F\u00fchrerprinzip embedded in the ideology of the\nNSDAP (Fielding, 1981: 17) and reflecting the party's neo-Nazi positioning. In three\norganisations in this cluster, formal structures and leaders were identified but activists\nexperienced their movements as governed by an informal ethos of collective ownership\nexpressed as `an organisation of the people' (MM, SK) and `leadership' was understood\nas the initiation of collective endeavour (EDL, GB). These cases could be reciprocally\ntranslated, therefore, alongside a number of movements in the Gender and minority\nrights cluster, which also had clear organisational structures and identified `leaders'\nalthough activists experienced that leadership as diffuse, communicative and consulta-\nThe line of argument derived from this synthesis of 44 ethnographic case studies of\nyouth activism conducted for the MYPLACE project thus contributes to a re-emergent\ninterest in leadership and decision making aspects of social movements (Barker, Johnson\nand Lavalette, 2001: 3).

There is not scope in this article\nto reflect on the possible explanations for this convergence. However, other emergent\nconcepts from the cross-cluster synthesis demonstrate that certain shared values and\nexperiences \u00ad non-conformism, self-ascribed outsider status, confrontation with authori-\nties \u00ad direct activists of the right as well as the left away from movements with a strong\ninternal hierarchy and leadership. Examples of concepts derived from the wider synthe-\nsis that feed into the emergent line of argument illustrated in Figure 1 are denoted in the\ncircles. Envisaging their own movements as `open to all' emerged as a means by which\nyoung activists distance themselves from more orthodox far left or far right groups char-\nacterised by closed, secretive or democratic centralist structures.

However, there is an inherent danger that,\nas the meta-interpretations of the synthesiser are added to those of the researcher and the\nresearch participant, the nuances of data will be in lost in a process of `triple averaging'\n(Weed, 2008: 22). While recognising the risk that synthesis thins out the thickness\nFigure 1. Line of argument: `dispersed leadership'\nembedded in the original studies (Sandelowski et al., 1997: 366), it is argued here that the\napplication of meta-ethnography to primary data helps retain as much detail as possible\nfrom individual cases and protect against a slide into the proceduralism that may charac-\nterise the systematic review of quantitative research.\nThe approach outlined in this article does this in a number of ways. First, the use of\nprimary data (in the form of `node memos') as the unit of synthesis allows concepts to be\nderived directly from the articulation by respondents of their experience and significant\ndetail and differentiation from the original studies to be retained well into the analysis\nprocess. Secondly, by retaining a commitment to including `refutational' data in the syn-\nthesis, cases that are `exceptions' or `outliers' can be used to enhance understanding \u00ad\nthrough the development of a `line of argument'\u00ad rather than excluded because they lack\n`fit'. Indeed, the refutational translation acts as a powerful reminder not to seek similarity\nalone and to question why some concepts `work' (in terms of reciprocal translation) bet-\nter than others. Thirdly, meta-ethnography did not substitute ethnography but added to it\nby extracting the general from the unique over and above the contributions made by\nindividual case studies. The MYPLACE research design was premised on an inductive\nselection of cases that prioritised the importance of contextual validity. While analysis\nprotocols provided a systematic process of coding to two levels, this was completed in\nthe local language and thereafter each team generated their own third-level interpreta-\ntions and published their findings as discrete projects. Thus this method (unlike a strict\ncomparative design) allowed the synthesis of findings alongside the production of unique\ncase studies interpreted in context. Fourthly, this inductive approach meant that the con-\ncepts that emerged from the synthesis were not pre-defined by parameters for compari-\nson rooted in the research design (and thus on secondary literature rather than primary\ndata). This ensured that the synthesis was capable of eliciting concepts that were genu-\ninely unforeseen (although this does not happen in every case). Finally, criticisms that\nthe thickness of description and depth of scrutiny during synthesis is compromised when\nmeta-ethnography is applied to more than a very few cases was addressed by adopting a\ntwo-tier process of synthesis. This two-tier synthesis of clusters of cases (n=6\u00ad9), fol-\nlowed by a synthesis of derived concepts across all cases (n=44), is not dissimilar to that\nconducted by Campbell et al. (2011: x) in their synthesis of published studies (n=38) of\nmedicine-taking for chronic illness for which they first conducted a synthesis of studies\nby medicine groups and subsequently incorporated all groups in a thematic synthesis.\nThe application of meta-ethnographic synthesis to primary data nonetheless presents\nsome major challenges. First, although all cases synthesised in this study were drawn\nfrom a common research project (supported by cross-project guidelines and protocols)\ndifferences between data remained. This was partially a result of the inductive process of\nselection of cases which meant that some clusters contained `outliers' defying reciprocal\ntranslation. Rather than excluding cases that appeared not to add value to the synthesis\nwere retained and recorded as `missing'in relation to those aspects of the synthesis where\nthey demonstrated `lack of fit'. A second challenge lies in the unevenness of cases inher-\nent in any multi-sited ethnography (Marcus, 2011: 21). While some studies were deeply\nethnographic, including extensive field diaries, visual data and semi-structured inter-\nviews, others were based on substantial interview material but afforded less opportunity\nfor ethnographic observation while a number were primarily document-based studies\nusing web materials and official documents supplemented by a smaller number of inter-\nviews or observations. These differences often explain why some cases are `missing'from\ntranslations; cases based primarily on web-based analysis, for example, could not contrib-\nute significantly to the synthesis of findings on respondents' experiences of activism. A\nthird, and practically most difficult, challenge in conducting the synthesis was the differ-\nent modes of coding employed in different cases. Despite working to a common data\nanalysis strategy with specific guidance on coding, the number of both first and second\nlevel nodes varied greatly, as did the degree of detail provided in the `node memos'. This\nwas due in part to the highly labour intensive nature of the construction of the data sets for\nsynthesis and is reflected in unevenness in the contribution of cases to the synthesis.\nFinally, the evident benefit of team members conducting different meta-ethnographies\nsimultaneously and sharing reflections on the process (Lee et al., 2015: 340) was not fully\nrealised due to the transnational nature of the team and the strict reporting deadlines of the\nproject.\nConclusion\nMeta-ethnographic synthesis enables a body of qualitative research to be drawn together\nin a systematic way through a process of reciprocally translating the findings from each\nstudy into those from all the other studies in the synthesis (Campbell et al., 2011: xi).\nThus, meta-ethnography allows researchers concerned with the richness and texture of\nthe social world, and interpretations of it, to speak beyond the individual case. Whether\nmeta-ethnography produces conceptual innovation \u00ad through the generation of concepts\nabove and beyond those found in the analyses of individual studies \u00ad remains an open\nquestion. There is evidence that in some cases synthesis has produced major new insights,\nthrough the development of `third order' concepts. However, even in cases where such\ninsight is not generated (Campbell et al., 2011: 119), the meta-ethnographic synthesis,\nlike the systematic review, is a valuable tool for rigorously reviewing the existing knowl-\nedge base before the implementation of new qualitative research.\nThis article has set out a case for the application of meta-ethnography to the synthesis\nof primary data. While this contravenes usual distinctions between `secondary data anal-\nysis' and the synthesis of published studies, as primary qualitative data sets become\nincreasingly available to other researchers through archiving, there is likely to be height-\nened interest in strategies and protocols for synthesising the findings of qualitative\nresearch (Campbell et al., 2011: 9). The current article draws on the experience of adapt-\ning the meta-ethnographic synthesis approach to the interpretation of multiple ethno-\ngraphic case studies emanating from a single transnational research project to start a\ndialogue about how such protocols and procedures might look.\nNotwithstanding the challenges encountered, the application of the meta-ethnographic\nmethod to the analysis of MYPLACE ethnographic case studies provided a resolution to\nthe dilemma faced by qualitative researchers noted at the start of this article. It did so by\nemploying a mode of analysis in which the contextual `noise' constitutive of qualitative\nresearch was retained while generating significant `value added' over and above what\ncould be derived from the post-hoc comparison of discrete case studies. It is hoped that\nthe experience of its implementation outlined here might be taken up and developed by\nother teams engaged in similar transnational or multi-sited projects in a way that will\nenable qualitative researchers to speak beyond the individual case.\n"
