In comparison, less work has examined the effects of anonymity on punishment\nbehavior. In other words, to what extent are people's decisions to punish others influenced\nby their concerns about others being able to identify them?\nAnonymity and punishment\nOne study that did address this question of anonymity and punishment was\nconducted by Kurzban, DeScioli, and O'Brien (2007). In this study, these researchers\ninformed participants, prior to making their decisions about whether to punish another\nplayer who has defected in a Prisoner's Dilemma Game, that either: (a) they would have to\nannounce their decisions in public at the end of the game, (b) the experimenter would know\ntheir decisions, or (c) their decisions would be kept completely anonymous and\nconfidential. Kurzban et al. observed increased levels of altruistic punishment (in the form\nof participants sacrificing more of their own monetary endowment to penalize non-\ncooperative players) when participants expected their decisions to be made public and their\nidentities revealed.\nKurzban et al.'s (2007) results suggest that earlier findings about the role of\nanonymity in adherence to a fairness norm apply also to norms about punishing violators of\nthose norms. However, their critical experimental treatment (of informing participants that\ntheir economic decisions would be made public, along with their identity) confounded two\nseparate independent variables: (1) personal identification (or a breach of anonymity), and\n(2) information transmission (or a breach of privacy). While a breach of anonymity entails\na breach of privacy, a breach of privacy does not necessarily entail a breach of anonymity.\nIn the present study, we examined separately the effects of a breach of anonymity and a\nbreach of privacy on altruistic punishment behavior in the context of a modified third-party\npunishment game.\nOur main prediction in the present study was that participants would respond to a\nbreach of privacy (e.g., being told that their names would be kept confidential but that their\ndecision to punish would be revealed to another player) as though it were also breach of\nanonymity (e.g., that they would be personally identified as making this decision). This\nprediction is based on the more general evolutionary hypothesis that, in the ancestral past,\nonce information about a social act was revealed and began to circulate through gossip, the\nactor's identity would have likely also been compromised in small-scale hunter-gatherer\nsocieties.\nPrivacy, anonymity and social behavior\nPrivacy is not the same as anonymity. Although privacy generally entails\nanonymity, anonymity does not necessarily entail privacy (although it is an open question\nwhether people treat it as such). If someone finds an anonymous diary (i.e., private\nnotebook) and shares its contents with others, this is a breach of privacy for the author of\nthe diary, but it is not a breach of anonymity because the author is not identified. However,\nif the author of the diary can be identified due to the handwriting, this breach in privacy\nwould now become also a breach of anonymity.\nSeveral lines of research have shown that anonymity (in the sense of not being\nidentifiable) often promotes antisocial and anti-normative behavior. For example, Chiou\n(2007) had Taiwanese youth respond to three sexual messages (interspersed with six non-\nsexual messages) over the computer, in a web camera (low anonymity), personal photo\n(medium anonymity), or nickname (high anonymity) condition. Chiou found that\nparticipants' responses to sexual messages were most explicit in the high anonymity\ncondition, lowest in the low anonymity condition, and moderate in the medium anonymity\ncondition. Likewise, Silke (2003) observed that public acts of violence by paramilitary\nfoot-soldiers in Northern Ireland were exacerbated in terms of seriousness and\nAnonymity and punishment\naggressiveness when perpetrators took measures to conceal their personal identities\n(wearing masks).\nOn the other hand, recent findings from evolutionary game theory have\ndemonstrated the importance of social accountability (i.e., indirect reciprocity or reputation\nmanagement) for the stabilizing of norm conformity and prosociality (Milinski, Semmann,\nand Milinski, 2000). For example, Milinski et al. (2002) found that when information about\nparticipants' past decisions in an indirect reciprocity game were made known to other\nplayers, contributions to a public good were significantly higher than when participants'\npast decisions were unavailable. Moreover, when the opportunity to build a reputation is\navailable and there are a limited number of potential interactive partners, people compete\nfor the best reputation through costly (i.e., altruistic) giving (Barclay and Willer, 2007).\nOne possible explanation for why anonymity often loosens adherence to social\nnorms is that cues that motivate reputation-enhancing behavior (i.e., cues indicative of\nbeing visible to others) are often absent in \"anonymous\" settings. Evidence for this\nhypothesis comes from several lines of research that have demonstrated increased prosocial\nbehavior as a result of introducing implicit, social-presence cues (e.g., human-like eyes,\nhuman voice) into an ostensibly \"anonymous\" setting (Bateson, Nettle, and Roberts, 2006;\nBurnham (2003), for example, devised a Dictator Game experiment with three\nconditions--a \"no photo\" treatment, a \"dictator photo\" treatment, and a \"recipient photo\"\ntreatment. The Dictator Game assigns one player the role of \"dictator\" and another player\nthe role of \"recipient.\" The dictator is given a sum of money and must decide how much of\nit he/she will share with the recipient. The recipient is simply a passive recipient in the\ngame and has no sanctioning power over the dictator (cf. the Ultimatum Game). In\nBurnham's \"no photo\" treatment, participants simply performed an anonymous Dictator\nGame. In the \"dictator photo\" treatment, an instant photograph of the dictator was enclosed\nalong with their decision to the recipient; that is, in this condition participants performing\nthe role of dictator believed that they could be identified by recipients (which raised the\npossibility of interactions outside the laboratory). In the \"recipient photo\" treatment,\ndictators viewed an instant photograph of the recipient prior to their decision; that is, in this\ncondition, participants performing the role of dictator could identify the recipient of their\naction (which introduced social presence cues into the \"anonymous\" environment). The\noutcome was that dictators were most selfish (i.e., they gave the least amount to the\nrecipient) in the \"no photo\" (i.e., true anonymity) condition. However, in the two\nexperimental conditions, there were significantly more equitable and generous offers,\nsuggesting that both the presence of social cues (\"recipient photo\") and concerns about\nbeing identified (\"dictator photo\") promote generous behavior.\nThus, while researchers have investigated the effects of perceived anonymity on\nsocial behavior, it remains unclear the extent to which perceptions of privacy motivate\nsimilar behaviors. In particular, we are not aware of any study that has distinguished\nmethodologically between a breach of privacy (i.e., knowing that others will learn about\none's actions but that one's identity will be protected) and a breach of anonymity (i.e.,\nknowing that others will learn about one's actions and also that one will be identified as the\nactor).\nAnonymity and punishment\nEvolutionary accounts of altruistic punishment and the present study\nNorms of cooperation and fairness may evolve only when enough people are\ncommitted to punishing norm violations (Henrich and Boyd, 2001). However, punishment\nitself represents a second-order public good (Boyd, Gintis, Bowles, and Richerson, 2003;\nYamagishi, 1986)--i.e., the benefits of punishment can be enjoyed by all members of a\ngroup regardless of individual contributions. Because the act of punishing norm violators is\ncostly (i.e., one must expend time and energy to punish, and one risks retaliation and\npossible injury), it is in an individual's best interest not to punish, so as to avoid the costs\nof punishing. Nevertheless, people often do punish norm violators (at least in laboratory\nexperiments), despite the costs and even when the actions of norm violators do not directly\nGintis (2000) and Henrich and Boyd (2001) have argued that punitive dispositions\nevolved through group selection. Henrich and Boyd (2001), for example, presented a multi-\nstage model whereby once norms for cooperation and punishment stabilize within a \"pay-\noff biased\" and \"weak conformist transmission\" population, they may invade other\npopulations and come to dominant by avoiding costly punishment (see also Boyd et al.,\n2003; Gintis, Bowles, Boyd, and Fehr, 2003). Another possibility is that individuals\nengaging in altruistic punishment were rewarded from third parties (i.e., group members) in\nreproductive benefits (Miller, 2000; Smith, Bliege Bird, and Bird, 2003), which made it\nbeneficial (in the long run) for individuals to punish norm violations.\nReputation-based explanations for altruistic punishment appear to fall short in that\nthey fail to account for observations of altruistic punishment in anonymous settings, where\nthere are no ostensible opportunities to build a reputation (e.g., Fehr and G\u00e4chter, 2002;\nFehr and Fischbacher, 2004). This kind of altruistic behavior (that occurs between non-kin\nin the absence of cues for direct or indirect reciprocity) has been labeled \"strong\nreciprocity\" (Gintis, 2000; Fehr, Fischbacher, and G\u00e4chter, 2002) and there are principally\ntwo evolutionary accounts for this behavior. According to Gintis et al. (2003), strong\nreciprocity is an adaptive dispositional trait, which evolved through group selection.\nAccording to Burnham and Johnson (2005), strong reciprocity is, by definition,\nmaladaptive, and they suggest that strong reciprocity (as it has been operationalized in\nlaboratory experiments) may be caused by inadvertent \"triggering\" of individual-level\nindirect-reciprocity mechanisms under presumably anonymous conditions (referred to as\nthe \"evolutionary legacy hypothesis\"; see Haley and Fessler, 2005, for a similar argument).\nIn the present study, all participants were assigned the role of the \"third party\" in a\nthird-party punishment game (a one-shot economic game; see Fehr and Fischbacher, 2004)\nand had to decide how much to spend of their own endowment to punish an anonymous\ndictator who \"selfishly\" distributed 0 to an anonymous recipient. We manipulated\nparticipants' perceptions about having their punishment decisions revealed to the\nanonymous recipient (privacy breach) vs. having their decisions revealed and their\nidentities revealed to the recipient (anonymity breach). Participants were randomly\nassigned to one of three experimental conditions. In the control condition, participants were\ngiven the impression that their economic decisions would be kept private and their\nidentities kept strictly anonymous. In the privacy breach condition, participants were told\nthat the anonymous recipient would hear about their economic decision, but would not\nAnonymity and punishment\nknow their names (thus had no way of identifying them). Finally, in the anonymity breach\ncondition, participants were informed that the recipient would be made aware of both their\neconomic decision and their names (and thus could potentially identify them).\nNo significant difference in punishment behavior was expected between the privacy\nbreach and anonymity breach conditions. However, altruistic punishment in these\nconditions was expected to be greater than in the control condition (i.e., HA\n: anonymity\nbreach = confidentiality breach > control). This prediction follows from the hypothesis that\nconcerns about reputation are inadvertently activated by the privacy breach cue (despite\nostensible anonymity). Alternatively, participants may strategically reason that their\neconomic behavior is equally anonymous in the privacy breach and control conditions, and\nthus adjust their behavior accordingly. If this is the case, there should be no difference in\npunishment behavior between the privacy breach and control conditions, with greater levels\nof punishment in the anonymity breach condition (i.e., HB\n: anonymity breach > privacy\nbreach = control).\nWe also had participants justify their economic decisions in writing and report, by\nselecting from a list of emotion terms, those emotions they experienced while making their\ndecision. In regards to participants' justifications, we expected that participants who\npunished the dictator would justify their actions in terms of concerns about fairness and\njustice, as suggested by previous findings (e.g., Dawes, Fowler, Johnson, McElreath et al.,\n2007; Hoffman et al., 1996). We made no predictions about justifications of non-punishers.\nFinally, in regards to participants' reports of their emotional experience, we expected\npunishers to report having had experienced the negative social emotions of anger/outrage,\nand the positive social emotions of pride/righteousness. From an appraisal perspective,\nanger/outrage arises from perceiving a negative event or social transgression as certain,\nunder human control, and brought about by others (Lerner and Keltner, 2000; Smith and\nEllsworth, 1985). Pride/righteousness is thought to arise from perceptions of the self as\nresponsible for a positive event or adhering to a social norm (Fessler and Haley, 2003;\nTracy and Robins, 2004). On the other hand, non-punishers were expected to report feeling\nthe negative social emotions of guilt and shame. Guilt/shame is thought to arise from\nperceptions of the self as responsible for a negative (usually interpersonal) event or norm\nviolation (Baumeister, Stillwell, and Heatherton, 1994; Tangney, Stuewig, and Mashek,\nMaterials and Methods\nForty-two students from Queen's University, Belfast, Northern Ireland (21 females,\nconditions. In all three conditions, participants were instructed that they were the \"third\nparty\" in a \"three-player economic game.\" The economic game was said to entail one\nplayer (the dictator) who was to distribute a sum of ten 1 coins between him- or herself\nand a second player (the recipient). In other words, this was a Dictator Game in which the\ndictator had absolute control over how many coins (if any) the recipient would receive. The\nparticipants were instructed that these two other players were seated in separate rooms and\nthat the dictator would be making his or her decision in private. In actuality, aside from the\nparticipant there were no other players. [Note that, in the study, the dictator was referred to\nAnonymity and punishment\nas \"distributor\" to avoid connotations associated with \"dictator\" (e.g., \"cruel,\" \"tyrant\").\nThroughout this paper, however, we use the conventional moniker of \"dictator.\"]\nAs third party, participants were given a total sum of five 1 coins and informed\nthat every 1 coin they \"left behind\" (i.e., that they did not take with them) would serve to\n\"deduct two coins from the dictator's total earnings.\" (The term \"punish\" was never used.)\nIt was emphasized to participants that their decision only influenced the dictator's outcome\nand in no way affected the recipient's outcome.\nParticipants were randomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions (14\nparticipants in each condition). In the control condition, participants were instructed that\nthe recipient would not find out about participants' economic decision. In fact, control\nparticipants were told that the recipient was completely unaware that there was a third party\nin the game. In the privacy breach condition, participants were instructed that the\nexperimenter would be disclosing their economic decision to the recipient, but that the\nparticipant's name would not be disclosed; that is, they could not be identified by the\nrecipient or the dictator. In the anonymity breach condition, participants were instructed\nthat the experimenter would be disclosing both their economic decision and their names to\nthe recipient, but their name would not be disclosed to the dictator; that is, the recipient\nwould be able to identify them, but the dictator could not. It is important to note that for all\nthree conditions, participants were guaranteed anonymity from the dictator and thus did not\nhave to fear extra-laboratory retaliation. Also, all laboratory sessions were carried out\nidentically, aside from the experimental manipulation.\nBefore participants made their decision, they received a sealed, opaque envelope\nwith the dictator's decision inside. All participants learned that the dictator kept the entire\nsum of money (all 10 \u00a31 coins). Past research has shown that people often construe\ndistributions less than half the total amount as violation of a \"fairness norm\" warranting\nParticipants then made their own decisions about how much money they would like\nto \"leave behind\" and thus \"deduct\" from the dictator. To do this, they were instructed to\nplace the amount in an envelope marked \"third party\" and drop the envelope in a slot box\nnear the door before leaving. Participants were informed that they would not be interacting\nwith the experimenter or anyone else after making their decisions, but instead could leave\nthe building as soon as they were done. This was done to mitigate participants' concerns\nabout interacting with the experimenter and other players after making their decision. After\nsubmitting their envelope, participants completed a brief questionnaire, which asked them\nto justify their decision and select from a list of emotion terms \"any emotions experienced\nwhen making their economic decision.\" These included the following emotion terms:\nanger, anxiety, guilt, shame, excitement, righteousness, fear or worry, admiration,\ncontempt, pride, outrage, envy, or none.\nAfter completing this form, participants exited the laboratory with whatever amount\nof coins they decided to keep. This provided participants with a clean get away.\nParticipants did not have to interact with anyone after making their decisions nor did they\ncommunicate with other participants between sessions. Participants were later fully\ndebriefed about the study over email.\nAnonymity and punishment\nResults\nThe main dependent measure was the number of coins sacrificed by the participant\nto punish the selfish dictator. UK5 was the maximum number of coins that could be\nsacrificed.\nFigure 1. Distributions of UK used to punish dictator by experimental condition (N = 14 x 3)\nFigure 1 presents the distribution of UK used to punish by participants within each\ncondition. Overall, punishment was observed most often in the anonymity breach condition\n(n = 12; 85.7% gave at least 1), although the majority of participants punished the dictator\nto some extent within the other conditions as well (n = 10; 71.4%). Instances of 0 were\nmost frequent in the control (28.6%) and privacy breach conditions (28.6%), while\ninstances of 5 (i.e., full punishment) were observed most often in the privacy (35.7%) and\nanonymity breach conditions (28.6%).\nThe mean amount used to punish the dictator in the control condition was 1.57 (SD\nanonymity breach condition, the mean was 2.43 (SD = 1.87). This pattern of means was in\nthe predicted direction. However, to test our main hypothesis (HA\n: anonymity breach =\nprivacy breach > control), we conducted three planned contrast tests: anonymity vs.\nprivacy, privacy vs. control, and anonymity vs. control. Although comparisons of the\nexperimental conditions against the control condition failed to reach conventional levels of\nAnonymity and punishment\nin the direction predicted by our hypothesis (HA\n) and not the alternative (HB\n: anonymity >\nprivacy = control). As predicted, there was no difference between the anonymity and\nBecause we predicted that there would be no difference between the experimental\nconditions, we pooled the data from those conditions and ran a t-test, comparing the\ncombined experimental conditions against the control condition. The results, again, failed\nto reach conventional levels of significance (t(40) = 1.33, p = .191; Levene's test for\nequality of variance, p = .130). The calculated effect size (ES) of the observed difference\nwhich suggests a possible Type II error.\nWhen punishment behavior was considered as a dichotomous variable (i.e., those\nwho punished [1-5] vs. those who did not [0]), a Chi-square analysis revealed that only\nin the anonymity breach condition were participants committed to punishing above chance\nconditions). In other words, participants in the anonymity breach condition consistently\npunished the dictator, while participants in the other conditions were not consistent.\nIn terms of gender effects, no specific hypothesis was made. A 3 (condition) x 2\nalthough a condition x gender interaction approached conventional levels of significance\n(F(2, 36) = 2.75, p = .077). One-way follow-up tests revealed that this nearly significant\ninteraction effect may be explained by a significant difference between male and female\nParticipants' written justifications for their economic decisions were coded by both\nthe first author and a second rater na\u00efve to the study's hypotheses (Cohen's k = .76; see\nTable 1 for justification categories and frequencies). Justifications reflected participants'\nrationales for deducting or not deducting money from the dictator. Some participants\nprovided rationales that related to multiple justification categories. In these cases, multiple\ncodes were assigned. Table 1 is organized by number of coins used to punish the dictator--\ntwo or more, one, or none. Punishment behavior was divided into sub-categories of \"two or\nmore\" and \"one\" because many participants who gave only 1 to punish felt inclined to\njustify why they did not give more money. Participants who gave \"two or more,\" however,\ntended to focus on what they did give, rather than what they did not give.\nReasons for punishing included concerns about fairness and justice (90.6%; n = 29)\nand feeling bad for the recipient (9.4%; n = 3). (One person invoked a fairness/justice\nrationale to justify their not punishing, but they were treated as an outlier and therefore\nomitted.) \"Feeling bad for the recipient\" justifications only occurred in the anonymity (n =\n2) and privacy breach (n = 1) conditions. Reasons for not punishing (or not punishing\nmore) involved the desire for personal gain (42.9%; n = 12), need for money (14.3%; n =\n4), having nothing to gain from punishing the dictator (14.3%; n = 4), or not being able to\nhelp the recipient (17.9%; n = 5). Finally, justifications from three participants were\nunscorable or merely restated what the dictator had done without elaboration.\nAnonymity and punishment\nTable 1.

However, participants who gave \"two or more\" or \"one\" also\nreported experiencing guilt to a certain extent (18.8%; n = 6).\nTable 2. Emotions reported by participants punishing with two or more, one, or none\nTwo or\nmore\nOne\nNone\nTotal\nAnonymity and punishment\nDiscussion\nThe results from this brief study were generally supportive of our hypothesis that a\nbreach of privacy would promote altruistic punishment in a manner similar to a breach of\nanonymity due to the reputational consequences it would have been likely to entail in the\nancestral past. Participants in the privacy and anonymity breach conditions sacrificed more\nmoney to punish an anonymous dictator, who allocated 0 to an anonymous recipient, than\nparticipants in the control condition, who were guaranteed privacy and anonymity.\nParticipants in the privacy and anonymity breach conditions sacrificed, on average, half of\ntheir endowment to punish, while control participants sacrificed about one-third.\nAlthough contrast tests of these differences failed to reach conventional levels of\nsignificance, the pattern of results conformed to our prediction (HA\n: anonymity breach =\nprivacy breach > control), which was inspired by the general evolutionary argument (i.e.,\nthe evolutionary legacy hypothesis) that it was difficult--if not impossible--to ensure\nanonymity in the ancestral past; therefore, the human mind may be biased to respond to a\nbreach of privacy as though it were a breach of anonymity. Although provisional, these\nfindings call into question the conclusions of other investigators who promised their\nparticipants anonymity but nevertheless informed these participants that their economic\ndecisions would be made known to other players (e.g., Fehr and G\u00e4chter, 2002).\nIn terms of the consistency at which participants punished, participants in the\nanonymity breach condition consistently punished the dictator, while participants in the\nprivacy breach and control condition were not consistent. Interestingly, participants in the\nprivacy breach condition appeared to oscillate between sacrificing none (or a trivial\namount) and sacrificing all of their money to punish. This suggests perhaps that some\nparticipants were responding to the privacy breach cue as though it were a threat to\nanonymity (or an opportunity to build a reputation), while others were not. We might\nspeculate that some participants were able to consciously override concerns about\nreputation elicited by the privacy breach cue (by attending to the experimenter's guarantee\nof anonymity), while others viewed this condition as offering possible opportunities for\nreputational gain. Future research might investigate this possibility using a cognitive load\nmanipulation.\nDespite lower levels of altruistic punishment in the control condition, the majority\nof control participants did punish to some extent. There are two competing evolutionary\nexplanations for this behavior: First, this behavior may reflect behavioral dispositions for\n\"strong reciprocity\" (i.e., dispositions to punish even when there exist no present or future\nrewards for punishing) that evolved through group selection (see Fehr, Fischbacher, and\nthat evolved to maximize individual fitness (e.g., through reputation management) are\ninadvertently triggered by cues embedded within the experimental context--cues that may\nbe reduced, but never fully eliminated by design parameters (see Burnham and Johnson,\n2005). For example, in the context of our third-party punishment game, all participants\nreceived information about the existence of two other players (an anonymous dictator and\nrecipient). Despite being guaranteed privacy and anonymity in the control condition,\ninformation about the existence of these other players may have been sufficient to trigger\nconcerns about being identified. Future research should certainly investigate this possibility\nfurther.\nAnonymity and punishment\nUnexpectedly, male participants in the control condition were significantly less\naltruistic than female participants. This is consistent with the position that women are more\ncommitted to norm enforcement than men (see Eckel and Grossman, 1996b). Another\npossibility is that men, more than women, require incentives such as social recognition to\npunish, while women are unilaterally concerned about norm conformity (see Iredale, Van\nVugt, Dunbar, 2008, for evidence pertaining to giving behavior). Since there was no\ndifference between men and women in the other conditions, our findings suggest the latter\nexplanation to be more plausible.\nParticipants who punished the dictator primarily justified their actions in terms of\nviolations of \"fairness\" and concerns about \"justice.\" For example, a typical justification\nfor punishing was as follows:\n\"The unfairness of the [dictator's] decision affected my choice. Had they distributed\nthe money evenly I would not have taken any of their money away and kept all of\nmy money. However because they wanted to keep all the money and not give the\nrecipient any, I did not mind sacrificing some of my money to detract money from\ntheir sum. Were it not for my own self interest I would have left all my money to\nleave the [dictator] with no money\" (control condition)\nThe above quotation also highlights the dominant justification for not punishing (or\nnot punishing more than one could have), namely, the desire for personal gain (\"Were it not\nfor my own self interest...\"). Also, a number of participants reported not punishing because\nsuch action would not benefit the recipient in any manner. It is impossible to determine\nwhether any justifications in the present study, however, were truly motivational or merely\nrepresent post hoc justifications for punishment decisions, since they were not\nexperimentally manipulated.\nInterestingly, although very rare, it was only in the anonymity and privacy breach\nconditions where participants reported \"feeling bad for the recipient\" as justification for\npunishing the dictator. One possibility is that by broadcasting one's sympathy for the\n\"victim\" of this social norm violation these participants were capitalizing on the\nopportunity to communicate their prosocial posture to the recipient. However, because this\ntype of justification was uncommonly reported, we can only speculate. Future studies\ncould examine this possibility further by informing participants that their justifications will\nbe transmitted to the recipient, in addition to their economic decisions.\nParticipants were also asked to nominate from a list of emotion terms those\nemotions they had experienced when making their economic decision. Limitations of this\nemotion-word task include the fact that reported emotional states may be post-hoc\nreconstructions or causally epiphenomenal, and also that the list was predetermined and\nmay therefore have failed to capture other emotions experienced (e.g., \"disgust,\"\n\"annoyance\").\nDespite these important caveats, the negative social emotions of anger/outrage and\npositive social emotions of pride/righteousness were, as predicted, reported by participants\nwho punished. These data on affect are important because emotions are generally\nconsidered by evolutionary scholars to be the proximate drivers behind adaptive behaviors\nin line with appraisal theorists who argue that anger/outrage arises from perceptions of a\nnegative event or transgression as certain, under human control, and brought about by\nsomeone external to self (Lerner and Keltner, 2000; Smith and Ellsworth, 1985), and that\nAnonymity and punishment\npride/righteousness arises from perceptions of being morally responsible and having chosen\nthe socially appropriate course of action (Fessler and Haley, 2003; Tracy and Robins,\n2004). In the present study, the dictator's transgressive behavior was presented as certain\n(i.e., there was no doubt that the dictator was the cause of the event) and deliberate (i.e., the\ndictator could have chosen another course of action), which satisfies the appraisal criteria\nfor anger/outrage. Participants who punished were responsible for their decision, which\nwas perceived by many to be the \"right\" course of action--thus, satisfying the appraisal\ncriteria for pride/righteousness.\nEmotion categories of excitement and contempt were also reported by participants\nwho punished. This was not predicted, but may be explained by the fact that in Western\nsociety \"contempt\" shares a taxonomic structure with \"anger\" (i.e., negative/ interpersonal)\nand \"excitement\" shares a taxonomic structure with \"pride\" (i.e., positive/ active/ reward)\nParticipants who did not punish (or who punished very little) reported experiencing\nguilt more than any other emotion (although whether guilt is an emotion is debated; see\nElison, 2005), as predicted; however, against expectations, shame was not reported by non-\npunishers. One possibility is that the conditions for shame were not present in our study.\nAccording to Tracy and Robins' (2004, 2006) appraisal model, guilt and shame both arise\nfrom an internal attribution of responsibility for a negative event or a failure to live up to\nsocial standards (e.g., committing a transgression or lacking desirable qualities). Guilt and\nshame, however, differ in that guilt arises from perceptions of the event as unstable,\ncontrollable, and incongruent with global aspects of the self, while shame arises from\nperceptions of the event as stable, uncontrollable, and congruent with global aspects of the\nself (see also Tangney, 1995; Tangney et al., 2007). If this is correct, we might speculate\nthat non-punishers failed to report shame because they perceived their decisions to be\nstrategic (i.e., controllable) and not emerging from a stable, enduring characteristic of the\nself (e.g., the self as \"selfish\" or \"undesirable\"). Future studies could test this possibility\nmore systematically by comparing the justifications of guilt-prone and shame-prone\nindividuals' for punishing or not punishing.\nIt is important to point out, of course, that unlike in the ancestral past, contemporary\nindustrial society provides mediated-communication technologies (such as telephones,\nradios and computers) that make possible a specific type of anonymity--\"visual\nanonymity\"--that was not present in the ancestral past. Visual anonymity entails being\ninvisible to one's interactive partner (or having one's interactive partner invisible) during\nsocial exchange (see Joinson, 2003). Visual anonymity entails invisibility, but it does not\nnecessarily entail anonymity (in the sense of \"not being identifiable\"). When people\ncommunicate over the telephone or computer (for example, by Instant Relay Chat), they do\nso under visual anonymity. They cannot be seen, but they may be identified (e.g., by their\nvoice, or deliberately disclose their name). Future research should investigate the extent to\nwhich evolved human psychological systems are co-opted by (or respond to) these social\nartifacts of contemporary technologies, as well as determine the fitness value of such\nresponses in these evolutionarily novel contexts.\n"
