The study, which was based on a questionnaire survey of 1,776 respondents in organizations in the Czech Republic,\nproposed a number of hypotheses related to demographic and organizational variables and tests using ANOVA. Results\nof the data analysis revealed similarities to findings in Western countries, in which men show higher job satisfaction than\nwomen. Age does not seem to have a significant effect on job satisfaction. There is low job satisfaction in public/governmental\norganizations and among young people entering the job market. It is suggested that it is necessary to develop a human\nresources strategy for the public/governmental sector that will not only increase its social prestige but also increase positive\nfeelings among its employees. The need to better prepare undergraduates for the demands of the job market is also discussed.\n",

Generally, constructs and measure-\nment instruments have been developed in Western countries.\nConsequently, job satisfaction has been studied extensively\nin Western Europe and the United States. However, empiri-\ncal studies indicate that these studies cannot be directly\napplied to the analysis of organizational behavior in the\nCzech Republic (e.g., Luk\u00e1sov\u00e1, Frankov\u00e1, & Surynek,\nIn the past decade, there have been a number of studies\ninvolving non-Western cultures, including studies from\nTaiwan (e.g., Chen & Silverthorne, 2008; Cheung &\n2003). Recently, investigations of the Middle East have also\nbeen undertaken (e.g., Abdulla, Djebarni, & Mellahi, 2011;\npaucity of empirical data from transient post-Communist\neconomies from Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), which\nincludes the Czech Republic. Little is known about the fac-\ntors that influence job satisfaction in post-Communist coun-\ntries as they change their behavioral patterns during the\ntransition from a centrally planned economy to a market\neconomy (Lange, 2009). The importance of understanding\nthe organizational behavior of people from CEE countries\nhas emerged from the fact that some features of the recent\nsocioeconomic development of those countries are very spe-\ncific and differ from both Western and Eastern countries.\nMoreover, life under Communist regimes had long-term\nimpacts on CEE citizens' values and beliefs (Inglehart &\nStudies in some CEE countries have been based on\nsmaller samples and focused on specific professions--for\nexample, public relations practitioners in Bulgaria (Karadjov,\nKim, & Karavasilev, 2000) hospital staff (Kaarna, P\u00f5lluste,\nLepnurm, & Thetloff, 2004) and family doctors (Kalda,\nMaaroos, & Lember, 2000) in Estonia, managers\n(Alonderiene, 2010) and dentists in Lithuania (Puriene,\nPetrauskiene, Janulyte, & Balciuniene, 2007), salespersons\nin Poland (Brashear, Lepkowska-White, & Chelariu, 2003),\nand nurses in Slovakia (Gurkov\u00e1, C\u00e1p, Ziakov\u00e1, & uriskov\u00e1,\n1University of Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9, Czech Republic\nCorresponding Author:\nMarek Frank, Faculty of Informatics and Management, University of\nRepublic.\nEmail: marek.franek@uhk.cz\nOrganizational and Sociodemographic\nDeterminants of Job Satisfaction in the\nCzech Republic\nMarek Frank1, Hana Mohelsk\u00e11, V\u00e1clav Zubr1, Pavel\nBachmann1, and Marcela Sokolov\u00e11\n Keywords\njob satisfaction, personal factors, work-related factors, Central and Eastern Europe, Czech Republic\n2 SAGE Open\nworkers have received a great deal of attention.\nHaraszti (1977) has argued that Soviet-style labor rela-\ntions produced demotivated, demoralized, and unsatisfied\nworkers. Although it is quite difficult to make such general-\nized statements about all European Communist countries, it\nis known that during the last decade of Communist rule\n(1980s), job dissatisfaction commonly existed in the Czech\nRepublic (known until 1992 as Czechoslovakia), which was\ncaused by insufficient work organization, bad workplace\nrelations, incompetent superordinates, inefficient reward\nsystems, and limited opportunities for career advancement\n(typically, formal political activity was required).\nConsequently, low job satisfaction was associated with low\njob performance, which resulted in the economy's overall\npoor performance (e.g., Mozn\u00fd, 1999). In public and official\ncommunications, however, these negative phenomena were\nhidden. For this reason, there are no empirical data describ-\ning job satisfaction in organizations during that period.\nHowever, following the collapse of the Communist political\nand centrally planned economic systems in CEE countries,\nthe last two decades have been characterized by a very rapid\nsocioeconomic and political transition. The extent and field\nof the recent institutional changes in the transition econo-\nmies of CEE countries have been quite unusual (Peng, 2003).\nDespite initial difficulties, most of these countries now have\nmarket economies that are more stable than before (Olson et\nal., 2006). However, there is a question of whether the lega-\ncies of Communist industrial relations still influence Czech\nemployees' organizational behavior. Unfortunately, our\nknowledge about changes in organizational behavior during\nthis period of transition is still quite limited.\nThe first empirical data about job satisfaction in the Czech\nRepublic are available from 1997 from the International\nSocial Survey Program (ISSP), which focuses on registering\nwork orientation. Several studies based on those data have\nbeen published (Medgyesi & R\u00f3bert, 2003; Sousa-Poza &\nlevels of job satisfaction in CEE countries were quite low\ncompared with Western and Northern Europe. Four CEE\ncountries (Hungary, Slovenia, Bulgaria, and the Czech\nRepublic) are among the eight countries with the lowest job-\nsatisfaction levels. A subsequent survey conducted in 2005\n(see http://www.issp.org) showed that job-satisfaction levels\nin the Czech Republic are still one of the lowest among the\n21 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and\nDevelopment (OECD) countries. The study, based on data\nEuropean countries from a sample of 20,000 employed\nrespondents, again confirmed that job-satisfaction levels\nwere considerably higher in Western European countries\nthan in Eastern European countries (Borooah, 2009). Data\nfrom the European Employee Index collected in 2008 and\nsecond-to-last in job satisfaction (see Eskildsen, Kristensen,\n& Antvor, 2010). Determinants of job satisfaction in Western\nand Eastern European countries have been analyzed by\nferences between particular CEE countries were not exam-\nined in these studies.\nAll of these studies have shown that during the past two\ndecades, the level of job satisfaction in the Czech Republic\nhas been quite low. To understand this situation, we need\nmore information about the impact of particular factors that\ninfluence job satisfaction. Thus, the objective of this study\nwas to examine sociodemographic and organizational factors\nthat determine job satisfaction in a sample from the Czech\nRepublic and to compare them with findings from developed\nWestern countries. This study continues our previous\nresearch on a smaller sample (Frank & Vecea, 2008), which\nprimarily focused on the personal correlates of job satisfac-\ntion. The aim of this study is to investigate relationships\nbetween job satisfaction and sociodemographic and personal\ncharacteristics (gender, education, age, and occupational\nlevel), along with relationships between job satisfaction and\nsome work-related situational factors (organization size,\norganization ownership, and organizational culture).\nReview of the literature\nA classic definition describes job satisfaction as a pleasur-\nable or positive emotional state resulting from the appraisal\nof one's job or job experience (Locke, 1976). Measurements\nof job satisfaction include both intrinsic and extrinsic satis-\nfaction (e.g., Ryan & Deci, 2000). Typically, intrinsic satis-\nfaction includes achievement, responsibility, recognition,\nand dependence, whereas extrinsic satisfaction is composed\nof salary, additional bonuses, relationships with coworkers,\nand working conditions. Job satisfaction plays a role in job\nperformance (e.g., Judge et al., 2001). Job satisfaction is con-\nsidered a cause of turnover and absenteeism, along with their\njob satisfaction is associated with general life satisfaction\nMany factors can affect the level of job satisfaction. The\nliterature often distinguishes between the situational and per-\nsonal characteristics of job satisfaction (e.g., Spector, 1997).\nWhereas situational characteristics represent job characteris-\ntics (organizational, work-related factors), personal charac-\nteristics represent an individual's personal (e.g., age, gender,\neducation) and dispositional (e.g., personality traits)\nfeatures.\nAge is an employee characteristic that is often thought to\ninfluence job satisfaction. Several decades ago, Rhodes (1983)\nconducted a meta-analytic study based on a review of more\nthan 185 studies and concluded that job satisfaction is posi-\ntively and linearly linked with age. Older employees are more\nsatisfied than younger employees with their jobs. Later, Clark,\nOswald, and Warr (1996) noted that many older people have\nsucceeded in moving into occupations with characteristics that\nFrank et al. 3\nare more desirable. They have expectations of their jobs that\nare more realistic, and their mental structures change with age-\ning. Interestingly, some of the differences between age groups\nmight be accounted by different rates of labor-force participa-\ntion--typically, approximately 90% of young people are eco-\nnomically active, whereas the rate of employment is lower\namong older people (Clark et al., 1996).\nIn the 1990s, new insight into this association was pro-\nemployees. Their investigation provides strong evidence for\na U-shaped relationship between job satisfaction and age,\nmeaning that younger and older employees are more satis-\nfied than middle-aged employees. Specifically, overall job\nsatisfaction is at its lowest at age 36 and increases thereafter.\nThis finding was confirmed in later research by Gazioglu and\nemployees. Fargher et al. (2008) have conducted a study on\ndata from European countries (Austria, Belgium, Denmark,\nFinland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, The\nNetherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom) collected in\njob satisfaction as a function of age in a Western European\nsubsample. In a CEE subsample (Czech Republic, Estonia,\nHungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia),\nhowever, the U-shaped pattern was visible but not statisti-\ncally significant. In contrast, Eskildsen, Kristensen, and\nWestlund (2003), in a survey conducted in the Nordic coun-\ntries (Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden), have\nreported that job satisfaction increases linearly with age.\nInterestingly, a study by Luthans and Thomas (1989), con-\nducted in the United States, has found that workers older\nthan 40 years of age become less satisfied with their jobs. An\nexplanation for this may involve both processes of resigna-\ntion and pressure from modern technologies, high work\noverload, and the increasing focus on productivity.\nThe labor market in the Czech Republic is dissimilar to\nmarkets in the above-mentioned Western countries.\nUnfortunately, there are no investigations available that\ndescribe relationships between job satisfaction and age in the\nCzech Republic and other transient economies of CEE begin-\nning in the early 1990s. As stated above, very rapid political,\nsocial, and economic changes imposed great pressures, pri-\nmarily on middle-aged and older generations of employees.\nOrganizations' transition processes were characterized by\nrapid technological changes, internationalization develop-\nments, privatization, and pressure for higher quality products\nand higher work productivity. In addition, during that period,\nolder employees suffered from age discrimination. All of\nthese phenomena caused the middle and the older genera-\ntions to feel threatened and distressed. Our previous research,\nsatisfaction during that period slightly significantly decreased\nwith age (r = -.17). However, we assume that later, around\nthe 2010s, people who have recently become members of the\nmiddle and the older generations would have become more\nadapted to changes due to generational shift.\nEducation is an additional factor often found to cause dif-\nferences in the level of job satisfaction. However, the evi-\ndence of an association between job satisfaction and\neducation is contradictory. Studies from the 1970s reported a\npositive association between job satisfaction and education\n(e.g., Weaver, 1980). However, in their meta-analysis involv-\nMoch, and Pooyan (1987) found that the correlation between\njob satisfaction and education does not differ significantly\nfrom zero because patterns of associations differ by organi-\nzational type. In studies conducted in the United Kingdom\ntion decreases with increasing educational levels. The expla-\nnation is that education that does not result in extrinsic\nrewards (e.g., money, prestige, autonomy) leads to dissatis-\nfaction. A subsequent study by Clark and Oswald (1996) has\nprovided empirical support for this proposal: Their analyses\ninitially found a positive effect of education on job satisfac-\ntion. However, this positive effect disappeared when the\neffect of income was controlled.\nLange (2009) did not find any significant associations\nfrom CEE countries. A study by Frank and Vecea (2008) in\nthe Czech Republic found a very weak positive association\nbetween job satisfaction and education. Significant differ-\nences were seen only between employees with an educa-\ntional level of \"skilled worker\" and those who completed\nsecondary school or are working and currently engaged in\nuniversity-level studies (distance learning).\nNumerous studies have investigated gender differences\nin reported levels of job satisfaction. In terms of associa-\ntions between job satisfaction and education, their findings\nare also contradictory in some respects. Some researchers\nhave found women to be more satisfied than men (Clark,\n2000). Others have reported men to be more satisfied than\nlarge body of studies has reported that there are no signifi-\ncant gender differences (Brief, Rose, & Aldag, 1977;\nevidence of gender bias in CEE countries. There are sub-\nstantial differences between male and female employees,\nand it seems that some of those differences reflect the sur-\nviving influence of the Communist gender order (Lange,\nresult in male employees having higher levels of job\nsatisfaction.\nIn view of the above literature, we have the following\nexpectations:\nHypothesis 1: There are no age-related differences in job\nsatisfaction.\nHypothesis 2: Educational level has no impact on job\nsatisfaction.\nHypothesis 3: Men are more satisfied with their job than\nare women.\n4 SAGE Open\nTable 1. Sample Characteristics.\nItem % Frequency\nAge\nEducation\nYears of experience (tenure)\nOrganization ownership\nOrganization size\nJob level\n Manager/supervisory responsibility\nemployee\nNext, we focus on work-related factors that influence job\nsatisfaction. There is evidence that job satisfaction is also\ninfluenced by an employee's position in an organization.\nRobie, Ryan, Schmieder, Parra, and Smith (1998) performed\na meta-analysis of the relationship between job level and job\nsatisfaction, analyzing data from 35 independent studies\ninvolving more than 18,000 employees. They found that job\nsatisfaction increases with the level of one's job position. In\ngeneral, managers report higher levels of job satisfaction\nthan do regular employees (Eskildsen et al., 2003). Huang\nand Vliert (2004) analyzed data from a multinational com-\ncountries. They reported that job level is associated with job\nsatisfaction in individualistic countries but not in collectivis-\ntic countries. In addition, they found a positive relationship\nbetween job level and job satisfaction only for jobs that pro-\nvide opportunities for individuals to use their professional\nskills and abilities, that is, in individualistic countries.\nEarlier research has revealed that job satisfaction is influ-\nenced in some way by organization size (e.g., Ingham, 1970;\nTalacchi, 1957). Moreover, frequently it has been observed\nthat large companies pay more than small firms (i.e., the\nemployer size-wage effect, for example, Brown & Medoff,\nLang and Johnson (1994) proposed that the balance of intrin-\nsic and extrinsic values moderates organization size and job\nsatisfaction. Investigations from the United Kingdom (Clark,\n1990) that are more recent indicate lower levels of satisfac-\ntion in larger organizations. Idson (1990) proposed that lower\nlevels of satisfaction in larger organizations can be explained\nby those organizations' inflexible work environments. Ritter\nand Anker (2002) reported that the smallest employers (up to\n10 employees) generate the lowest job satisfaction in Latin\nAmerica but the highest job satisfaction in Hungary and\nUkraine. Their explanation relates to the fact that in transi-\ntion economies, small companies are more dynamic in con-\ntrast to the previously state-run enterprises, which are rigid.\nInvestigations of Western countries do not show system-\natic differences in job satisfaction between the government\nand the private sector (e.g., Kankaanranta et al., 2007).\nPatterns of employment in public organizations differ from\nthose of private or semipublic systems. In most countries,\ncompared with the private sector, public sector salaries are\nlower, promotion is slower, and rewards are not always\nrelated to work performance (Rainey, 1991). In contrast, the\npublic sector usually offers a stable work environment and\nhigher job security. During the Czech Republic's process of\neconomic transition, government employees suffered from\nlow incomes and a bureaucratic organizational culture.\nFrank and Vecea (2008) found the highest level of overall\njob satisfaction in international corporations, followed by\norganizations with foreign owners, organizations with Czech\nowners, and public/governmental organizations.\nBased on previous evidence, we hypothesize as follows:\nHypothesis 4: Managers are more satisfied with their\njobs than are employees in nonmanagerial positions.\nHypothesis 5: The highest level of job satisfaction is\nfound in the smallest organizations.\nHypothesis 6: The lowest level of job satisfaction is\nfound in public/governmental organizations.\nResearch method\nSample\nA sample of 1,776 respondents participated in the study.\nRespondents ranged from 17 to 74 years of age.

Table 1 shows\nthe characteristics of the employees and organizations sur-\nveyed. The respondents worked in various occupations\ncovering a wide spectrum of activities (for details, see\nFrank et al. 5\nMeasurements\nThe survey questionnaire consisted of three sections. The\nfirst section contained three demographic questions: gender,\nage, and educational level. The second section contained five\nquestions concerning the characteristics of the respondents'\norganizations: ownership (Czech ownership, foreign owner-\nship, international corporation, or public/governmental orga-\nnization), size (up to 50 employees, up to 250 employees, up\ndents' job levels (manager/supervisory responsibility, non-\nsupervisory responsibility), and type of business.\nThe third section included the 36-item scale \"Job\nSatisfaction Survey,\" which was developed by Spector\n(1985). This scale was used to measure the respondents' per-\nceived level of job satisfaction. Because the original version\nis in English, the scale was translated to Czech. The method\nof parallel translation was used. Two people independently\ntranslated the scale from English to Czech, and discussions\nbetween the translators resolved discrepancies. The full text\nof the Czech version of the scale is available on the web page\nof the original version's author (see http://shell.cas.usf.\nedu/~pspector/scales/jsstranslate.html).\nThe scale was composed of nine subscales describing\nvarious facets of job satisfaction: Pay (Cronbach's  = .85),\nPromotion (Cronbach's  = .84), Supervision (Cronbach's\n = .76), Fringe Benefits (Cronbach's  = .73), Contingent\nRewards (Cronbach's  = .82), Operating Conditions\n(Cronbach's  = .64), Coworkers (Cronbach's  = .70),\nNature of theWork (Cronbach's  = .80), and Communication\n(Cronbach's  = .77). The Cronbach's alpha for total satisfac-\ntion was .93. Respondents were instructed to indicate the\nextent of their agreement with each item on a 6-point scale\nranging from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (6).\nProcedures\nWe attempted to create a sample of employees from various\nfields in the business and nonprofit sectors. The data were\ncollected by part-time undergraduate students. Typically, the\nUniversity of Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9's part-time undergraduates are\nfrom the Northeastern regions of the Czech Republic. Thus,\nwe collected data from the Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9 and Pardubice\nregions, along with part of the Vysocina region. Given that\nthe data were collected by part-time students of different\nages, working in various types of organizations, who had\nmiscellaneous reasons for studying while they worked, we\ndid not assume any systematic selection bias in the data set.\nThe data used in this study were collected in January and\nFebruary 2013. Part-time undergraduate students enrolled in\nmanagement or psychology courses at the University of\nHradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9's Faculty of Informatics and Management\nwere invited to administer paper-and-pencil questionnaires\nin the companies and organizations where they worked.\nTypically, each undergraduate collected approximately 20\nTable 2.

To achieve high statistical power, we made\nan effort to obtain a sample of approximately 2,000 partici-\npants. Ultimately, 1,950 respondents participated in the\nstudy; 174 questionnaires were excluded due to various\nerrors and missing values.\nStatistical analyses were conducted using Statistica 8\nsoftware (Statsoft, Inc.).\nResearch findings\nTable 3 shows the average scores on overall job satisfaction,\nas well as the average scores on particular facets of job satis-\nfaction. The first hypothesis proposed that there are no sig-\nnificant differences among particular age groups with respect\nto the level of job satisfaction. One-way ANOVA was used to\ntest this hypothesis by comparing the means of the three age\ngroups. ANOVA did not indicate a significant effect of age\np = .116. Moreover, Pearson's correlation indicated that cor-\nrelation between age and overall job satisfaction was about\nIn the next step, we looked for age differences in particu-\nlar facets of job satisfaction. In most of them, except for pro-\nmotion, supervision, and operating conditions, we did not\nfind significant differences among the scores for particular\nage groups. The results revealed significant differences in\n0.007, among the age groups.TheTukey Honestly Significant\nDifference (HSD) post hoc test yielded significant differ-\nences in satisfaction with promotion between the youngest\nand oldest age groups. Older employees were less satisfied\nthan younger ones. Moreover, we found significant differ-\ncant differences in satisfaction with supervision between the\nmiddle and oldest age groups--that is, that older employees\nare less satisfied. Finally, the results revealed significant dif-\nferences in satisfaction with operating conditions,\nhoc test yielded significant differences between the younger\nage group and the other age groups. Young employees were\nmore satisfied with operating conditions. In conclusion, we\nfind that the oldest employees were less satisfied with respect\nto some facets of job satisfaction. With respect to other fac-\nets, however, there were no significant differences among the\nage groups. Thus, H1 was partially confirmed.\nThe second hypothesis proposed no significant differ-\nences between education and level of job satisfaction. One-\nway ANOVA was used to test this hypothesis by comparing\nthe means of the six levels of education. The ANOVA did not\nFrank et al. 7\nindicate a significant effect of education on the level of over-\nstep, we looked for an effect of education on particular facets\nof job satisfaction. The ANOVA revealed a significant effect\nof education on satisfaction with supervision, F(2, 1773) =\npost hoc test showed that differences in the satisfaction of\nskilled workers versus working undergraduates were mostly\nsignificant. Clearly, these analyses confirmed a lower level\nof job satisfaction among less-educated employees (skilled\nworkers), but did not reveal some type of linear association\nbetween level of education and job satisfaction. Thus, H2\nwas partially confirmed.\nThe third hypothesis proposed that males are more satis-\nfied with their jobs than are females. The t test for indepen-\ndent samples indicated significant differences between the\naverage scores of overall job satisfaction for males and\nfemales (t = 3.143, p < .01). Males were more satisfied than\nfemales. However, the effect size was small (Cohen's d =\n0.138). In a subsequent analysis, we checked gender differ-\nences for particular facets of job satisfaction. The results\nrevealed that males are significantly more satisfied than\nConversely, females are significantly more satisfied than\nThe fourth hypothesis proposed that managers are more\nsatisfied with their jobs than are employees without supervi-\nsory responsibility. The t test for independent samples indi-\ncated significant differences in overall job satisfaction\nbetween managers and nonsupervisory employees (t = 5.779,\np < .001). Managers are more satisfied than nonsupervisory\nemployees, with the effect size being moderate (Cohen's d =\n0.311). Furthermore, analysis of particular facets of job sat-\nisfaction indicates that managers are significantly more satis-\nfied than are nonsupervisory employees with pay (t = 7.176,\nCohen's d = 0.200). The differences were not significant for\nsupervision and coworkers. Thus, H4 was confirmed.\nThe fifth hypothesis proposed that the highest level of job\nsatisfaction is found in the smallest organizations. One-way\nANOVA was used to test this hypothesis by comparing the\nmeans of overall job-satisfaction scores in four types of orga-\nnizations divided by size. The ANOVA revealed the signifi-\ncant effect of organization size on overall job satisfaction,\nhoc test showed statistically significant differences only\nbetween the smallest organizations of up to 50 employees\nTo clarify the nature of these differences, analyses of par-\nticular facets of job satisfaction were performed.

Furthermore, analysis of particular\nfacets of job satisfaction indicates that public/governmental\nemployees are the least satisfied with pay, F(3, 1772) =\nwas confirmed.\nDiscussion and Conclusion\nIn this study, we aimed to extend our knowledge about the\nimpact of selected personal and work-related factors on job\nsatisfaction in the Czech Republic. We were interested in\nfinding out whether the patterns of associations between par-\nticular personal and work-related determinants and job satis-\nfaction in the Czech Republic are similar to those in Western\ncountries. Our data reveal patterns of associations similar to\nthose observed in Western countries. However, some differ-\nences were found.\nAdifferent pattern of association was found for age. Some\nWestern European countries showed a U-shaped pattern of\n8 SAGE Open\njob satisfaction with age, whereas the Nordic countries\nshowed a linear increase. Although our older data from 2007\n(Frank & Vecea, 2008) revealed a slightly significant\ndecrease of job satisfaction with age, in the current data,\noverall job satisfaction was not affected by age. A significant\nnegative correlation with age was found only in the three\nfacets of job satisfaction, namely, promotion, supervision,\nand operating conditions. Clearly, this finding supports our\nassumption that newly middle-aged and older employees in\nthe Czech Republic have become relatively adapted to the\norganizational changes that primarily occurred in the 1990s.\nThe positive message of this outcome is that the level of\noverall job satisfaction of the older age group did not tend to\ndecline. Conversely, there is a negative message in that the\nyoungest group of Czech employees have a low level of sat-\nisfaction compared with the U-shaped relationship between\nage and job satisfaction observed in some Western European\ncountries.\nBecause of the paucity of further relevant data, we can\noffer only a relatively speculative explanation. First, Czech\nemployers often complain that graduates of various types of\nschools lack appropriate preparation for job requirements\n(Doucek, Maryska, & Novotn\u00fd, 2013; Kalouskov\u00e1 &\nVojtch, 2008). According to this critique, Czech schools,\ncolleges, and universities do not appropriately educate their\ngraduates for the potential demands of the job market.\nEmployers argue that education often suffers from a lack of\npractical skill and experience training (e.g., communication,\nteam work, and trustworthiness). It might be that because of\ninappropriate preparation by the Czech schools, entry-level\nemployment is unpleasant or even stressful for young\nemployees, resulting in a lower level of perceived job satis-\nfaction. Second, it has often been reported (Kalouskov\u00e1 &\nVojtch, 2008) that young Czech graduates have unrealistic\nexpectations about high wages or possibilities of rapid pro-\nmotion, which also can lead to perceived job dissatisfaction.\nThese unrealistic expectations may also be a manifestation\nof naive hopes that emerged at the beginning of the period of\nthe socioeconomic transition. In the Czech Republic, the\nyounger generation did not always have realistic hopes about\nthe rapidity of success in the new \"capitalist\" society (e.g.,\npared young adults' ideals about future jobs in post-Commu-\nnist CEE countries and the United States, finding that\nwanting a well-paying job is associated with poorer eco-\nnomic conditions, whereas preference for career success is\nassociated with better economic conditions.\nIt was observed that the associations between educational\ndegree and the level of job satisfaction in the Czech Republic\nare similar to the patterns of those associations observed in\nWestern countries. More specifically, a higher degree of edu-\ncation does not mean a higher level of job satisfaction. The\ndetailed analysis of our data revealed significant differences\nbetween the job satisfaction of skilled workers and that of\nemployees with higher educational levels. Unfortunately, the\ncategory of employees with an elementary-level education\nwas almost missing in our sample. Thus, the data did not\nenable a precise analysis of the patterns of those associations\nin groups of employees with lower educational levels.\nConversely, no increase in job satisfaction for workers with\nhigher educational levels was observed. As already stated,\neducation that does not result in a higher salary, promotion,\nor prestige tends to lead to dissatisfaction. In the Czech\nRepublic, the situation is similar to that in Western Europe,\nwhere the rate of bachelor's or master's degree holders is\ngradually increasing (Kouck\u00fd, 2009). Conversely, the num-\nber of prestigious, well-paid jobs is limited.\nAs we predicted, a higher overall job satisfaction was\nfound in men. It turned out that men were overall more satis-\nfied than women with pay, promotion, fringe benefits, and\ncontingent rewards. Males' higher job satisfaction with these\njob facets is consistent with the well-established fact that, on\naverage, in the Czech Republic women are paid less than\nmen. Women also have fewer possibilities for promotion\nFurthermore, it was confirmed that organizational size\nand type also affect job satisfaction. Consistent with the\nabove-mentioned findings, the highest overall job satisfac-\ntion score was found in the smallest organizations (i.e., those\nwith up to 50 employees). In small organizations, employees\nare satisfied with contingent rewards, the nature of the work,\noperating conditions, coworkers, and communication. In\ncontrast, employees in the largest organizations are satisfied\nwith pay and fringe benefits (employer size-wage effect). The\nlowest level of job satisfaction is found in organizations of\napproximately 50 to 250 employees, which cannot offer\nmonetary rewards similar to those offered by large compa-\nnies or (conversely) a level of flexibility and informal rela-\ntionships similar to those offered by the smallest\norganizations.\nWe observed a low level of overall job satisfaction in pub-\nlic/governmental organizations that was not observed in pub-\nlic organizations in the West. Generally, the public sector\noffers lower pay and benefits than the private sector, along\nwith fewer and slower career advancement opportunities\n(Rainey, 1991). This was confirmed by our data. Moreover,\ndissatisfaction with working conditions was also identified,\nwhich most likely reflects the poor equipment and facilities\nthat are quite often typical of Czech public/governmental\norganizations. Whereas lower salaries in the public sector are\ntypically compensated by job security or some form of social\nprestige, in the Czech Republic, public employees do not\nenjoy such advantages. Because of political instability, gov-\nernment organizations are periodically restructured and suf-\nfer from budget cuts. Moreover, according to public opinion,\ngovernment employees are often perceived as parasitic on\nthe private sector.\nFinally, there is the question of the reason for the often-\nreported low level of job satisfaction in the Czech Republic.\nOur analysis of the determinants that influence job\nFrank et al. 9\nsatisfaction did not satisfactorily clarify this phenomenon\nbecause patterns of associations between particular deter-\nminants and job-satisfaction levels showed many similari-\nties with findings obtained in Western countries. Thus, any\nexplanation should utilize generally known facts and asso-\nciations. It is very likely that a crucial factor influencing the\noverall low level of job satisfaction in the Czech Republic\nis the level of general satisfaction with life. In the Czech\nRepublic, life satisfaction levels are substantially lower\nthan in economically developed Western countries (e.g.,\nB\u00f6hnke, 2008). As stated above, job satisfaction is corre-\nlated with life satisfaction (e.g., Judge & Watanabe, 1993).\nRecently, Georgellis and Lange (2012) analyzed associa-\ntions between life satisfaction and job satisfaction using\ndata from the European Values Survey. The results showed\nthat the Czech Republic is one of the countries with the\nstrongest link between life satisfaction and job\nsatisfaction.\nIn addition, we assume that the low level of overall job\nsatisfaction in the Czech Republic has some link to rapid and\nsubstantial processes of economic transition, which in the\n1990s elicited much pressure on both employees and society\nas a whole. These processes eroded the level of general life\nsatisfaction in the Czech Republic, which in turn affected the\nlevel of job satisfaction.\nThis study has several implications. As noted, our data\nrevealed the low satisfaction levels among public employees.\nBecause this sector is crucial for the effective functioning of\nboth various public services and governmental administra-\ntion, the implications of this study indicate the need for a\nhuman resources strategy that will improve public employ-\nees' positive feelings in the workplace. Whereas the budget\nin this sector is always limited, one of the recommendations\nmay involve an improvement in operating conditions along\nwith (at a minimum) the establishment of fair methods of\nrecognition, promotion, and rewards. Moreover, another way\nto increase public employees' level of job satisfaction would\nbe to increase the social prestige of the public/governmental\nsector by changing public perceptions of public\norganizations.\nNext, on the assumption that the lower level of job satis-\nfaction among young people is due to inappropriate prepara-\ntion by the schools, educational authorities should implement\nadditional approaches. Although universities have broader\ngoals than preparing their graduates for work, it would be\nquite reasonable to change one aspect of the Czech univer-\nsity. In their complaints about the educational process,\nemployers often note that Czech universities are much more\nliberal institutions than Western universities in terms of\ndemands on the students. There are no strict demands with\nrespect to deadlines, the precision of student work, or require-\nments for obtaining credits (Sp\u00edka, 2008). We believe that\nfocusing on these deficiencies would be beneficial not only\nfor employers and young, first-time employees but also for\nthe schools themselves.\nLimitations\nOur research had several limitations. Respondent selection is\nthe first limitation. As we have explained, the data were pri-\nmarily collected from two regions of the Czech Republic--\nHradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9 and Pardubice. However, this deficiency is\nsomewhat ameliorated by the fact that the Czech Republic\nhas a socioeconomic composition that is relatively homoge-\nneous. The country consists of 14 regions. The region of the\ncapital city of Prague is a bit different (e.g., it has the highest\nsalaries and the lowest rate of unemployment; moreover, the\nprevalent political orientation is right-wing). Also different\nare two regions that in the past had a great deal of heavy\nindustry but now suffer a higher rate of unemployment (i.e.,\nthe Moravskoslezsk\u00fd and \u00dasteck\u00fd regions). The Hradec\nKr\u00e1lov\u00e9 and Pardubice regions have relatively higher living\nstandards and a lower rate of unemployment. Thus, the data\ngathered here can be applied to the greater Czech Republic.\nA further limitation is that the category of employees with\nlower educational levels was underrepresented in our sam-\nple. Another possible limitation is the method of data collec-\ntion by part-time students. However, this disadvantage is\npartially compensated for by the diversity of those students'\njobs because they were working in different areas of the pri-\nvate and public/governmental sectors. The last limitation of\nthis study is that this research did not analyze all work-related\nfactors. Income, which is often assumed to affect employee\nperformance, was not examined. In the Czech Republic, it is\nnot common to inform others about the level of one's own\nsalary because quite often, people are afraid of the envy of\ntheir colleagues. Thus, had we asked our respondents this\nquestion, they might have refused to complete the question-\nnaire or would have left the item blank. Despite these limita-\ntions, we believe that our data provide results that enlarge\nour findings on job satisfaction in CEE countries.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research and/or authorship of this article: The work was sup-\nported by a research grant from the Faculty of Informatics and\nManagement at the University of Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9 (FIM UHK Grant\ndata collection and analysis, the decision to publish, or the prepara-\ntion of the manuscript.\nReferences\nAbdulla, J., Djebarni, R., & Mellahi, K.
