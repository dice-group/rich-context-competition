It defies definition because it is\nextremely complex, often contradictory, and constantly\nAs a result, no single definition of postmodernism has been\nwidely accepted. Owing to this fact, I outline a number of\ndefinitions and features of postmodernism that are appropri-\nate to my reading of Hayden White's philosophy of history in\nthis essay.\nJean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard provides one of the most influen-\ntial definitions for postmodernism. Lyotard (1984) defines\npostmodernism as \"incredulity toward metan-arratives\" (p.\nxxiv). According to Lyotard, in post-modernism, faith in\nmetanarratives has ebbed, and thus, knowledge has not had\nto seek its legitimation universally but locally (p. 60).\nBuilding on Lyotard's definition, Linda Hutcheon (1989) in\nher \"Incredulity Toward Metanarrative\" argues that post-\nmodernism \"is characterized by no grand totalizing master\nnarrative but by smaller and multiple narratives which do not\nseek (or obtain) any universalizing stabilization or legitima-\ntion\" (p. 186). Based on these definitions, postmodernism\nrejects metanarratives in favor of mininarratives that are pro-\nvisional, contingent, and relational and makes no claim to\ntotality, objectivity, universality, and absolute truth.\nBecause postmodernism maintains that there exists no\nabsolute truth, it follows that there exists no basis for abso-\nlute meaning; rather, meanings are individually and/or\nsocially constructed. This implies that there exists no single\nfixed meaning and interpretation of history, but plurality of\nreadings and interpretations, not to mention that the interests\nof individuals, groups, and nations can play a significant role\nin forming their readings and interpretations. In addition,\npostmodernism sees history as linguistic constructs and man-\nmade discourses, which are not given or natural. These con-\nstructs and discourses--which consist of a set of words,\nselected and assembled by historians into narratives with\nplots--are pregnant with a galaxy of devices that make them\nindeterminate and contradictory, ironical and paradoxical. It\nis worth noting that to revisit and reexamine the historical\ntexts, postmodernism foregrounds ironies and paradoxes that\nexist within those texts, mainly because ironies and para-\ndoxes, due to their critical and subversive power, can help\nthe readers and researchers to pinpoint the contradictions\nwithin historical texts. The implication of this is that post-\nmodernism does not deny the existence of history but invites\nthe readers and researchers to rethink and reenvision it, and\nthis is an attempt to rehistoricize rather than dehistoricize\nhistory.\nMoreover, postmodernism denies that the historians are\nobjective observers of historical events and objective record-\ners of historical accounts. Historians record what they wish,\n1Department of English, University of Turku, Finland\nCorresponding Author:\nMehdi Ghasemi, Department of English, FI-20014, University of Turku,\nTurku, Finland.\nEmail: mehgha@utu.fi\nRevisiting History in Hayden White's\nPhilosophy\nMehdi Ghasemi1\n Keywords\nHayden White, postmodernism, professional historiography, rehistoricization, optionalism, deconstruction.\n2 SAGE Open\nand their own limitations, interests, and biases of any kind\nultimately affect and surface in their accounts. In this cli-\nmate, postmodernism seeks for self-reflexive history wherein\nreaders can be more aware of some of the limitations, inter-\nests, and biases behind the historians' writings. Owing to\nthese reasons, postmodernism rejects professional historians\nand their belief in the scientific status of history and histori-\nography, teleology, totality, certainty, objectivity, universal-\nity, and essentialism. In his \"Historical Fiction, Fictional\nHistory, and Historical Reality,\" Hayden White (2005a)\nwrites \"What we postmodernists are against is a professional\nhistoriography\" (p. 152). This statement inspired me to reex-\namine a number of White's oeuvre from the perspective of\npostmodernism so as to find out in what ways and to what\nextent White is a postmodernist? In addition, I highlight a\nnumber of preoccupations of professional historiography and\nargue how White deploys the discourse of postmodernism to\ndismantle them.\nWhite (1978) in his \"The Historical Text as Literary\nArtifact\" maintains that while emplotting a set of events\n(e.g., a, b, c, d, e, . . . , n), the historians are required to give\nmeanings to them through describing or characterizing them.\nIn this process, the historians may privilege the \"status given\nto certain events or set of events in the series,\" shown by\nWhite with the capitalized letters:\n1. A, b, c, d, e, . . ., n\n2. a, B, c, d, e, . . ., n\n3. a, b, C, d, e, . . ., n\n4. a, b, c, D, e, . . ., n. (p. 54)\nSuch accounts of history indicate both subjectivity and\nplurality of narratives that question the existence of one sin-\ngle, monolithic, total, or grand narrative. As an example,\nWhite (1966) refers to Burckhardt's Civilization of the\nRenaissance and states that \"[Burckhardt's] intention was\nnot to tell the whole truth about the Italian Renaissance but\none truth about it\" (p. 44, emphasis in original). He continues\nthat \"there is no such thing as a single correct view of any\nobject under study but that there are many correct views\" (p.\n47, emphasis in original). The stated example followed by\nthese statements clearly show that White denies the existence\nof one grand narrative as the ultimate Truth with regard to an\nevent--in this case, the Italian Renaissance--and avoids\nconfining history to one definitive monolithic narrative.\nWhite's position here is based on postmodernism style of\nthought that breeds skepticism toward ultimate Truth as well\nas the objectivity of grand narratives. It should be noted that\npostmodernism as a way to detotalize and reinscribe the\ndominant order of hierarchy rejects any totalizing or unify-\ning view of history. This is to say that postmodernism pro-\nvides a foundation for countering and deconstructing the\ngrand narratives of history that are to substantiate their domi-\nnance and legitimation. The deconstruction of grand\nnarratives is thus an attempt to free thoughts from\nthe hegemony of grand narratives and to clear space for\nmininarratives, which raise difference, heterogeneity, and\nmultiplicity. Under these circumstances and as a result of\nreplacement of grand narratives with mininarratives, post-\nmodernism is dynamic, ceaselessly oscillating between two\npoles of \"making\" and \"unmaking,\" \"presentation\" and \"rep-\nresentation.\" As Hutcheon (1988) observes, \"Postmodernism\nis a contradictory phenomenon, one that uses and abuses,\ninstalls and then subverts\" (p. 3). These nonstop movements\nbetween these poles help researchers to expand their realms\nof insight and embrace plurality of narratives. Seen in this\nlight, grand narrative accounts of history that claim reference\nto absolute Truth are not truer than other mininarrative\naccounts of history.\nIn his attempt to replace grand, all-encompassing narra-\ntives with petits r\u00e9cits, which signifies the exigency of plu-\nrality of narratives, White (1987) then takes a further step in\nhis Metahistory when he writes,\nIn my view, \"history,\" as a plenum of documents that attest to\nthe occurrence of events, can be put together in a number of\ndifferent and equally plausible narrative accounts of \"what\nhappened in the past,\" accounts from which the reader of the\nhistorian himself, may draw different conclusions about \"what\nmust be done\" in the present. (p. 283, emphasis in original)\nIn this excerpt, White, in addition to stressing the exi-\ngency of plurality of narratives, certifies the plurality of\nreadings and interpretations. To this end, White shifts the\nlocus of attention from the historian/author as the prime\n\"author\"ity to the text and the interaction between the text\nand the reader. From my standpoint, this is a postmodern\nattempt to free history from the shackles of an authoritarian\nideology, imposed by the historian/author, through under-\nmining the authority of the author and empowering the read-\ners. White (2000) clearly states the exigency of neglecting\nthe historians'/authors' intentions when he writes, \"when we\nare concerned with the history of historical writing, it is the\nintentions of the text that should interest us, not the inten-\ntions of the writer\" (p. 406). Moreover, he highlights the\ndetachment between the author and the text in his interview\nwith Ewa Domanska (1993): \"I am inclined to follow people\nlike Foucault and Barthes. So I say, the text in some sense is\ndetached from the author\" (p. 16). The detachment of text\nfrom the author recalls Roland Barthes's theory of \"the Death\nof Author.\" Admittedly, the death of author paves the way for\n\"the birth of readers\" and naturally the arrival of newly born\nperspectives that bring about the plurality of readings as well\nas the multiplicity of interpretations, which are in line with\nthe aims of postmodernism.\nThe plurality of readings and the multiplicity of interpre-\ntations, which aim to liberate us all from the coercive ideas\nof absolute Truth, bring undecidability to the narratives. This\nsense of undecidability then makes the narratives in Roland\nBarthes's term \"writerly texts,\" opening the space for diverse\ninterpretations to arise, which altogether exhibit a postmod-\nern sensibility. Under these circumstances, the readers are no\nlonger passive recipients and consumers but active partici-\npants and producers of meanings from history transcripts.\nThey play a creative role in the process of decoding and con-\nstructing meanings as they are required to go through this\nprocess of meaning-making, and naturally, the meanings\nthey make may greatly differ from one another. In this cli-\nmate, postmodernism can be seen as a departure from one\nsingle monolithic interpretation and the arrival of miscella-\nneous interpretations.\nIn addition to the exigency of the plurality of narratives\nand the plurality of readings and interpretations, White bears\ndown on the plurality of interests. As White (1978) writes,\nno historical event is intrinsically tragic; it can only be conceived\nas such from a particular point of view or from within the context\nof a structured set of events of which it is an element enjoying a\nprivileged place. For in history what is tragic from one\nperspective is comic from another. (p. 47)\nFurthermore, in \"Literary Theory and Historical Writing,\"\nWhite (1999a) rewords this idea as such: \"[History] is made\non both sides of the barricades, and just as effectively by one\nside as by the other\" (p. 13). In these excerpts, in addition to\nstressing multivoicedness and plurality, White notes that\nwhile a historical narrative for a group brings dignity and\nidentity, it can at the same time be considered a nekbah and\ndisgrace for another group. Both of these statements are in\nline with another tenet of postmodernism, which claims that\ntruth is community-based; it is simply relational, local, and\nperspectival, and whatever we accept as truth is dependent\non the interests of the community we favor. Naturally, differ-\nent groups, nations, and even individuals favor different\naccounts or narratives according to their own social, national,\nreligious, political, and economic interests, and connections\nof any type, which rebuts the idea of \"disinterested objectiv-\nity\" in professional historiography.\nAs seen in all excerpts above, White makes a triangular\nmove from the plurality of narratives to the plurality of read-\nings and then to the plurality of interests. White (1987) in\nMetahistory sketches his pluralistic standpoint as such: \"we\nare free to conceive `history' as we please, just as we are free\nto make of it what we will\" (p. 433). In such a climate, the\nplurality of narratives, readings, and interests foregrounds\npolyphony, or in Ihab Hassan's term \"multivocation,\" a post-\nmodern feature that maintains that there exist multiple ver-\nsions of reality or truths as read, seen, and interpreted from\ndifferent perspectives.\nFrom another perspective, according to postmodern\nscholars Mas'ud Zavarzadeh and Donald Morton (1991),\nhistory should not be accounted as a solid and fixed narrative\nbut \"a contestation of diverse textualizations\" (p. 54). This is\nwhat White most clearly wants to communicate in a number\nof his oeuvre, showing that history is not fixed any more but\nconstantly in flux and process, and as a result, it is the history\nof \"becoming\" rather than the history of \"being.\" In this way,\nhe interrogates the idea of fixed historiography, exploring the\npossibilities of situating different perspectives in rewriting\nhistory, which releases historiography from being seen as a\nfixed entity. In his essay, \"Literary Theory and Historical\nWriting,\" White (1999a) quotes Frank R. Ankersmit as\nsaying,\nThe great books in the field of the history of historiography . . .\ndo not put an end to a historical debate, do not give us the feeling\nthat we now finally know how things actually were in the past\nand that clarity has ultimately been achieved. On the contrary:\nthese books have proved to be the most powerful stimulators of\nthe production of more writing--their effect is thus to estrange\nus from the past, instead of placing it upon a kind of pedestal in\na historiographical museum so that we can inspect it from all\npossible perspectives. (p. 7, emphasis in original)\nSeen in his light, history and historiography are not final\nand ultimate but a process that is never completed. To clarify\nmy argument, I would like to liken historiography to a chess\ngame rather than a puzzle. As we know, one single place has\nbeen predetermined for each piece in a puzzle, and in case\nwe wrongly place it, the image is not truly created. This is an\nexample for a system of \"being\" or a closed machinery sys-\ntem. However, in a chess game, we have various moves and\noptions before ourselves, and with each move, a new trend is\nopened before us. This is an example of the system of\n\"becoming\" or an open or organic system.\nWe can think of White's synoptic table as a chessboard\nwith each item as a man. To White, any of the modes of\nemplotment can be combined with any of the modes of argu-\nment and any of the modes of ideology, and thus, one can\nhave a history written as \"mechanistic anarchist ironic com-\nedy\" or \"organicist radical metaphoric satire.\" This state-\nment clearly shows that historians decide and impose their\nown modes of emplotment. Postmodernism argues that what\nwe call knowledge is a special kind of text or discourse that\nputs together words and images in ways that seem pleasing\nto readers or to members of a nation or a group. In the system\nof becoming, the historiographers enjoy a sense of \"optional-\nism,\" which helps them freely choose among different modes\nof emplotment. In other words, the optionality of tropology\nleaves enough room for the use of different modes of ideo-\nlogical and argumentative implications. This is to say that\nWhite's view of emplotment rests on human choices, and\nadmittedly miscellaneous factors can affect human choices.\nThis leads me to conclude that the application of optionalism\nin historiography paves the way for the interference of human\nchoices in historical writing that rebuts the objectivity of his-\ntoriography. White (1999a) deals with the interference of\nhuman choices in historical writing when he enumerates\nthree tropological abductions:\n1. Representation in which the preparation of chronicles\nof events occur. I would like to liken it to cooking in\n4 SAGE Open\nwhich the cook prepares the required ingredients and\nraw materials for his own purpose according to his\nown cuisine.\n2. Transformation in which the historians choose among\ndifferent types of plot structure to shape the chroni-\ncles into a story based on a sequential order. In this\npart, the cook chops some of the raw materials and\nputs the ingredients into the pot one or two at a time.\n3. Constitution in which the historian establishes mea-\nning whether cognitive, ethical, or aesthetic for the\nobjects, and to me, it is like adding some spice to the\ndish and serving it. It merits noting that the amount of\nspice used may change the nature of the work from\nbeing \"meaningful\" to \"meaning-full\" in Keith\nAdmittedly, in all these three tropological abductions, his-\ntoriographers' personal preferences and national, social,\npolitical, and economic interests directly and at different lev-\nels interfere in their works; what materials to use, what\nemplotment modes to use, and what meanings to constitute,\nnot to mention their limitations and deficiencies all and all\ncan affect the nature of their products. Moreover, I would\nlike to argue that the analysis of these tropological abduc-\ntions is indeed to \"wage a war on totality\" as it provides\nWhite with a possibility to dissect the professional historiog-\nraphy and detotalize it through interrogating its historical\nknowledge and objectivity. The dissection of professional\nhistoriography then helps White (2005a) discover \"the\nresources of poiesis (invention) and artistic writing\" (p. 152)\nused in it and its ties with art, the means that endowed it pro-\nfessionality, and this is a reverse move toward the time prior\nto emplotment. As White (2005b) states in his \"The Public\nRelevance of Historical Studies: A Reply to Dirk Moses,\"\nThe salvation of professional historiography . . . [is] in reversing\nor rather amending our notions of history's importance as a field\nof study, the revision of history's so-called \"methodology,\" and\nmost importantly a return to the intimate relationship it had with\nart, poetry, rhetoric, and ethical reflection prior to\nIn my view, White's reverse move toward the time prior to\nemplotment is a self-reflexive cognition and intuition, which\nas a process of self-revising and self-monitoring illuminates\nthe artificiality of the professional historiography.\nWhite also proffers the exigency of this reverse move\ntoward the time prior to emplotment in his \"The Modernist\nEvent.\" In that essay, White (1999b) raises the issue of the\ninvention of plotless and subjectless historiography in the\n20th century as well as \"the creation of the new genres of\npostmodern parahistorical representation\" (p. 66). However,\nif then so, it seems that the fragmented style of writing and\nits nonlinearity, its time distortion and dislocation \"explode\nthe conventions of the traditional tale\" (p. 82). White's quest\nfor the invention of plotless and subjectless historiography is\na postmodern intention that deconstructs the concepts of\nlocation and time so that the narratives no longer follow a\nprogressive coherent linear plot, which brings about \"disinte-\ngration\" in Hassan's term and results in the creation of omni-\ntemporality, dislodgment, and \"multiperspectival setting\"\nwith different variables.\nIn such a climate, the historian sounds to provide the read-\ners with the unknitted wools of the history garment, making\nthe grounds for reworking and reknitting of its contents,\nwhich is to involve the readers in the process of history\nreknitting, and this is in line with \"participation,\" a postmod-\nern technique. I also would like to argue that this reverse\nmove toward the time prior to emplotment recalls Charles\nRussell (1985) who believes that postmodernism asserts and\nthen undermines such principles as order, meaning, and con-\ntrol. White's (1966) quest for the invention of plotless and\nsubjectless historiography is also stated in his \"The Burden\nof History,\" wherein he requires \"a history that will educate\nus to discontinuity more than ever before; for discontinuity,\ndisruption, and chaos is our lot\" (p. 50). No doubt, disconti-\nnuity, disruption, and chaos can bring about alternative\npoints of view and multiplicity of interpretations. However,\nthese conditions that raise unresolved paradoxes are insatia-\nble to the professional historians and their fans who seek for\ncontinuity as well as absolute and final meaning, but to post-\nmodern thinkers, they provoke new articulations and contra-\ndictions and pose the questions that may eventually lead to\nthe answers of different heterogeneous types.\nFurthermore, White (2005b) in his \"The Public relevance\nof Historical Studies: A Reply to Dirk Moses\" favors \"cul-\ntural relativism\" (p. 337) as the best policy that can lead to\ntolerance rather than intolerance to understand the position\nof the other side. It merits noting that from the perspective of\ncultural relativism, all groups produce specialized thought,\nand each group's thought is equally valid. No group can\nclaim to have a better interpretation of the \"truth\" than the\nothers. Considering this fact, White then introduces the pro-\nfessional historians as the ones who are afraid of relativists\nbecause the relativists might reveal the factitiousness of their\nworks and impugn the authenticity of their products. White\n(2000) in his response to Georg G. Iggers criticizes the objec-\ntive position of these historians, adding that \"historical facts\nare invented . . . they do not come `given'or as `data'already\npackaged as `facts'\" (p. 398). This fact is also echoed by\nLinda Hutcheon. As Hutcheon (1988) writes,\nWhat [postmodernism] does say is that there are all kinds of\norders and systems in our world--and that we create them all. . . .\nThey do not exist \"out there\", fixed, given, universal, eternal;\nthey are human constructs in history. (p. 43)\nThis is an attempt to increase incredulity toward objectiv-\nity and genuinity, claimed by the professional historians, and\nto imply the exigency of fluidity rather than fixity when\ndealing with historical events. As White (2005a) writes in his\n\"Historical Fiction, Fictional History, and Historical Reality,\"\nIt is no longer a matter of searching in obscure archives for the\none new document that will authorize the admission of at least\none hitherto unknown \"fact\" to the normative narrative account\nof a community's history. Anyone opening up any topic on\n\"Google\" will find an intimidatingly long list of sources,\nsecondary and primary, that could take a lifetime to examine,\nmuch less analyse or interpret. (p. 151)\nFrom the above excerpt, it is inferred that White is to\navoid the trap that reduces history and historiography to\n\"only one way of being,\" and this is in line with the ultimate\nend of postmodernism and its quest for the dissolution of fix-\nity. In addition, White intends to question the authenticity of\none single document coming from a particular archive as the\nonly genuine and legitimate source of knowledge. It is worth\nnoting that in \"The Burden of History,\" White (1966) speaks\nof dynamism and states that in a dynamic universe--like\ndynamic science and dynamic art--history can bring new\nperspectives to the camp. This standpoint indicates that\nWhite considers history a dynamic field, too, and this is to\ntake distance from professional historiography, characterized\nby causality, totality, and fixity. White's belief in dynamism\nin science, art, and history is based on the postulate of post-\nmodernism that aims to reject essentialist objective views\nwhile seeing society, history, and culture in transformation.\nFurthermore, what the professional historians see as an\nevent that has actually happened in the past is seen by White\nas a \"text\" written by human beings. And we all agree that a\ntext is made of language that can be paradoxical, ambiguous,\nironical, and indeterminate. It should be stated here that post-\nmodernism denies the fixity of language and its interpreta-\ntion, mainly because language is itself pregnant with a galaxy\nof devices that offer optionalism of meanings and pluralism\nof interpretations. Diction or the choice of words with deno-\ntative and connotative meanings; the play of signifiers with a\ngalaxy of signifieds; the presence of different (mis)spellings\nand puns, which can puzzle the readers, are just a few fea-\ntures of language as a dynamic entity that can add fuel to the\nfire of indeterminacy and create ambiguity and (mis)lead the\nreaders to various interpretations. Seen in this light, post-\nmodernism thus denies both the ability of language or dis-\ncourse to refer to an independent world of facts and things\nand the determinacy or decidability of textual meaning.\nIt should be noted that postmodernism favors uncertainty\nand marginalizes fixed meaning, and accordingly, it avoids\nresolving the contradictions and indeterminacies, which\nexist in language structures. The presence of contradictions\nand indeterminacies liberates the imagination from old and\nfixed meanings and results in hermeneutical plurality. Seen\nin this light, unresolved paradoxes to postmodern thinkers\nprovoke new articulations and raise questions that may (mis)\nlead to different answers. As a result, as Ihab Hassan (1987)\nnotes, interpretation becomes \"prejudicial, uncertain, and\nrefers to this fact as such:\nBecause language offers a variety of ways of construing an\nobject and fixing it in an image or concept, historians have a\nchoice in the modalities of figuration they can use to emplot\nseries of events as manifesting different meanings. There is\nnothing deterministic about this. The modes of figuration and of\nexplanation may be limited, but their combinations in a given\ndiscourse are virtually unlimited. . . . The words, grammar, and\nsyntax of any language obey no clear rule for distinguishing\nbetween the denotative and connotative dimensions of a given\nIn addition, we should bear in mind that postmodernism\nsubverts the neutral status of language as a disinterested\nmedium of representation, and no doubt, it is already\ninflected with power relations.\nMoreover, we need to take language deficiency in repre-\nsenting the past and its reality into account, which deprives\nthe historiographers from recording the events as they have\nreally been. Here, I would like to refer to two statements in\nWhite's (2000) response to Iggers that recall Jean\nBaudrillard's idea of \"hyperreality.\" According to White,\n\"The representation of a thing is not the thing itself\" (p. 396).\nHe continues that \"historical knowledge is always second-\norder knowledge\" (p. 398). The former statement may sig-\nnify that the perception can be different from expression.\nThis difference may partly originate from language as a par-\ntial and deficient medium. The latter statement signifies that\nhistorical knowledge is based on \"hypothetical construc-\ntions\" and distant from a genuine and objective investiga-\ntion. According to Baudrillard (1990), postmodernity is\ndefined by a shift into hyperreality in which simulations\nreplace the real, and accordingly, reality is no longer real, but\nhyperreal. For instance, in painting, the artist puts together\ndifferent colors to make an image to represent a thing. In his-\ntory, the historian attempts to put words together so as to\nrecord and represent an event, but admittedly in both cases,\nreality is no longer real, and consequently, what we achieve\nis not a \"reflection\" but a \"representation\" of events that--\ndue to the reasons mentioned--is not genuine.\nAccordingly, the representation of an event does not offer\na thorough and total view of the event. In his \"The Modernist\nEvent,\" White (1999b) enumerates a number of events,\noccurred in the 20th century, such as the two world wars, the\nGreat Depression, the population explosion, and so on, and\nclaims that \"these kinds of event do not lend themselves to\nexplanation in terms of the categories underwritten by tradi-\ntional humanistic historiography\" (pp. 70-71). As White\nwrites, \"historians are challenged in both their access to the\npast and in their representing it. . . . There is no past available\nBecause the past is no longer open to our perception and\n6 SAGE Open\ninspection, we cannot be certain that any description of it is\nadequate to it. The unavailability of past raises the question\nwhether we have access to any overall truth about the pres-\nent. Reading from this perspective, I think, like the past, the\npresent is not \"available to our inspection,\" either, and thus,\nthe historians today in action more or less suffer from the\nsame limitations of historians in the past. It sounds that the\nsame holes, originating from the fallibilities from which his-\ntory is and has suffered in the past--namely, deficiency of\nrecords, language deficiency, and partiality in representing\nthe events, as well as the fallibility of producers--abound\nand are still available to us in the present. To testify the exis-\ntence of holes in the historical representations and the\nunavailability of overall truth of events, White (1999b)\nquotes Gertrude Stein saying that an event may be an \"out-\nside without inside\" (p. 82).\nIn what ways, however, can the historians remark the\nexistent holes in the Great Whole of History? To answer this\nquestion, we should study four types of trope, including met-\naphor, metonymy, synecdoche, and irony, enumerated by\nWhite. However, which one of these tropes is of more sig-\nnificance for White? To my surprise, White (1999b) states\nthat \"I have no reason to prefer synecdochic historians to\nironic ones or vice versa\" (p. 12). He speaks as a father who\nclaims that he loves all his children equally; however, I agree\nwith Frank R. Ankersmit (1998) who believes that irony is\nmore prominent in White's tropology, an access to or a\nglimpse of past. Likewise, Richard T. Vann (1998) refers to\nirony as a \"super-trope\" (p. 151), believing that \"White never\ndenied that his own stance was ironic\" (p. 152). It should be\nnoted that irony with its critical power provides the ground to\nquestion, and this is in line with postmodernism intention as\nwell as White's who refuses to look at history and historiog-\nraphy as a system of \"being.\" This way of referring to the\npast is in line with Hutcheon's (1988) idea when she writes,\n\"one never returns to the past without distance,\" and that dis-\ntance in postmodernism is \"signaled by irony\" (p. 39). In\naddition, this device, according to Hutcheon (1988), is \"dou-\nble-voicings, for they play one meaning off against another\"\nThe emphasis on irony, thus, helps the researchers to\nremark a number of existent holes in the structure of history\nas irony has a subversive potential that can remove the text\nfrom its totality and essentialized genuinity. For that reason,\nUmberto Eco (1983) states, \"the past . . . must be revisited,\nbut with irony, not innocently\" (p. 67), simply because irony\ncan pinpoint the cracks in the walls of castle of history and\nprovide a unique opportunity for researchers to identify the\ncontradictions in it. I would like to argue that White's\n"
