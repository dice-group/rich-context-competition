However, the efficacy\nof zofenopril was better than that of ramipril in QII, QV, and particularly QIII (odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence\nhospitalization, particularly striking in the QIII (OR: 0.40, 0.19-0.85; p<0.05). Mortality rate did not significantly differ\nbetween the two treatments in any Q.\nConclusions: In the SMILE-4 study the propensity analysis confirmed the efficacy of zofenopril in the prevention of long-\nterm cardiovascular outcomes irrespective of the cardiovascular risk profile of post-AMI patients.\n",

This analysis was performed to further\ninvestigate the cardiovascular risk reduction profile of\nzofenopril in the clinical setting of the SMILE-4 study\nand to increase the power of the study, by correcting for\nsome potential confounding factors, in an attempt to re-\nevaluate the study results at the light of the primary impact\nof the therapy rather than of factors related to the study\npopulation.\nMaterials and methods\nStudy design\nThe full methodology of the SMILE-4 study has been\ndetailed elsewhere.6 In short, male and non-pregnant\nfemale patients aged 18\u00ad85 years with a confirmed diag-\nnosis of ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) or\nnon-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) in the\n24-hour period preceding enrolment (treated or not with\nprimary percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty\n(PTCA), treated or not with thrombolysis and recom-\nmended pharmacologic treatment) and with clinical and/\nor echocardiographic evidence of LVD were enrolled in\n79 hospitals in eight different countries. The study was\nconducted in accordance with the Guidelines for Good\nClinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki and the\nprotocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board\nof the University of Bologna as well as by the local ethics\ncommittees when required (see "
