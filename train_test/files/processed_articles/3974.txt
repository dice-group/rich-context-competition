Past research that has examined NFC\nas an interaction between whether interactivity on health web sites affected comprehension and attitudes, but no research\nto date has examined whether cognitive need interacts with eHEALS and subsequent information seeking behaviors. The\npresent study tests eHEALS and its connection to need for cognition (NFC) in the role of online health information seeking\nbehaviors. Results showed that high eHEALS individuals were more likely to seek out online health information and were\nmore likely to have higher NFC scores. NFC did not emerge as a moderator on the relationship between eHealth literacy\nand online health information seeking behaviors. Future directions are discussed, in particular, examining eHEALS as a\nconstruct of efficacy and further need to examine eHEALS with need for cognition in health communication research.\n",

Norman et al., 2007);\nasthma management in low-income families (Wise et al.,\n2009); and self-management for adjustment after curative\nbreast cancer (van den Berg, Gielissen, Ottevanger, & Prins,\n2012). It is crucial for individuals to develop eHealth literacy\nskills to better understand, evaluate, and use the health-\nrelated information that is disseminated online (Jensen,\neHealth literacy (C. D. Norman & Skinner, 2006) has a reli-\nable and consistent measure known as eHEALS that, in\nrecent research, has shown promise as a tool for assessment\nin using information technology for health purposes (e.g.,\neHealth literacy skills are especially important to develop\nin young adults because these skills will inform their deci-\nsion-making processes later in life. Linking electronic health\ninformation seeking behaviors to need for cognition (NFC)\nis important to see if there are differences among young\nadults who are less vested in cognitive thought as opposed to\nthose who are. This investigation can give insight as to how\nyoung adults are developing their health-related decision-\nmaking skills along with their NFC, two processes that will\ncarry them through their adult life. Research has examined\nthe use of the electronic health literacy scale (eHEALS, C. D.\nNorman & Skinner, 2006), but studies have yet to connect\nhealth literacy to NFC, particularly in the young adult\npopulation.\nA growing body of research in the leading journals on\nhealth communication has cited a critical need to conduct\nresearch on how health literacy skills in young adults influ-\nence health information-seeking behaviors, particularly\nthrough the use of new Internet technologies (Benjamin,\nPaek & Hove, 2012). As such, this study aims to address how\nhealth literacy impacts young adults' information-seeking\nbehavior on the internet. This study is also interested in\nexamining a possible relationship between higher levels of\neHealth literacy and young adults' engagement in healthy\nbehaviors, such as engaging in physical activity.\nIn the present study, eHEALS is connected to NFC and\nonline health information seeking behavior. Furthermore, we\npropose that eHEALS items could be measuring health\nself-efficacy rather than literacy, thus building off prior work\n1The University of Akron, OH, USA\n2Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nRebecca K.

Past research that has examined NFC\nas an interaction between whether interactivity on health\nwebsites affected comprehension and attitudes (Lustria,\n2007), but no research to date has examined whether NFC\ninteracts with eHEALS and subsequent information seeking\nbehaviors. Thus, this study aims to contribute to the growing\nbody of literature on eHealth literacy and information seek-\ning behaviors by (a) examining the relationship between\ncognitive need and use of seeking out health information\nonline; (b) the role of eHealth literacy, seeking out informa-\ntion online, and whether cognitive need plays a role in that\nbehavior; and (c) the connection between levels of eHealth\nliteracy and enactment of healthy behaviors.\neHealth Literacy\nHealth literacy is, as defined in the U.S. Department of\nHealth and Human Services Healthy People 2010 report,\n\"the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain,\nprocess, and understand basic health information and ser-\nvices needed to make appropriate health decisions\" (Location\n12). Health literacy goes beyond basic reading ability. It\nincludes the ability to understand instructions on drug usage,\nappointment cards and brochures, and directions, as well as\nthe ability to navigate complicated health care systems. The\neHealth literacy scale (eHEALS), though, provides a mea-\nsure of an individual's self-perceived skill and self-efficacy\nin using information technology for health purposes (C. D.\nNorman & Skinner, 2006). eHEALS has been tested in inter-\nvention trials and population surveys in multicultural sam-\nples with strong internal consistency and reliability.\nThe National Institutes of Health (2012) has current\nefforts dedicated to continuing to develop and improve\nhealth literacy. The U.S. Department of Health and Human\nServices (2012) has compiled recommendations for develop-\ners and practitioners to develop easy to use health web sites\nthat put action behaviors first and engage people.\nThe Elaboration Likelihood Model and\nNeed for Cognition\nNeed for cognition (NFC) is one of the most studied indi-\nvidual factors in message processing and persuasion\n(Cacioppo, Petty, & Kao, 1984). The Elaboration\nLikelihood Model (ELM; Petty & Cacioppo, 1986) and\nHeuristic Systematic Model (Chaiken, Liberman, & Eagly,\n1989) designate NFC as a way to assess individual differ-\nences in cognitive effort. ELM is a model that focuses on\nhow attitudes develop and change over time, and desig-\nnates NFC as the central factor that influences cognitive\ninvolvement. Based on the role of persuasion and message\nprocessing, people high in NFC tend to enjoy thinking\nwithout external influences and tend to more closely scru-\ntinize communication in addition to processing informa-\ntion more actively and more in-depth (Chang & McDaniel,\nimportantly, though, individuals high in NFC are more\nintrinsically motivated to think as opposed to those who\nare low in NFC (Haugtvedt & Petty, 1992). Similarly, high\nNFC individuals tend to engage in online activity that\nrequires more cognitive effort (Tuten & Bosnjak, 2001).\nRecommendations on examining health literacy have sug-\ngested that a key connection is the individual's need to\nengage in cognitive thought (Safeer & Keenan, 2005) and\nthat the NFC scale can lend important insight.\nResearch on cognitive involvement, or the degree to\nwhich an individual is intensely involved in some stimulus,\nhas largely been examined using theoretical frameworks\nsuch as the Elaboration Likelihood Model (e.g., Petty &\nCacioppo, 1986), which examine the role of one's level of\ncognitive involvement when presented with stimuli. The\nneed for cognition (NFC) is a variable that examines the\nextent to which one is involved with some stimuli that\nrequires some cognitive output. For example, relatively\nrecent research has explored NFC in terms of listening style\npreference and the relationship between high and low cogni-\ntion (Worthington, 2008), the interaction of NFC and mes-\nsagetypeonpositivehealthencouragement(Williams-Piehota\net al., 2006), and understanding the dimensions of perceived\ninteractivity in social interactions (Sohn & Lee, 2005). What\nis still missing from the literature is an exploration as to how\nNFC relates to eHealth literacy, particularly in the young\nadult population.\nNeed for Cognition as a Moderator\nin eHEALS and Health Information\nSeeking Behavior\nResearch using the NFC scale has explored how others'\nreactions to news presented on the Internet affects individ-\nual perceptions of public opinions and as a result, their per-\nsonal opinion (Lee & Jang, 2010). NFC was used as a\nmoderator on the effects of approval rating and individual\ncomments. High NFC individuals were more reliant on\napproval ratings, but low NFC individuals remained unal-\ntered. Other research looked at the effectiveness of testimo-\nnials compared with informational health messages in\nregard to personal involvement (Braverman, 2008). There\nremains a need, however, to look at whether NFC is a factor\nin one's use of the Internet to seek out information about\nhealth issues. New measures, such as the electronic health\nBritt and Hatten 3\nliteracy scale (eHEALS; C. D. Norman & Skinner, 2006),\nhave emerged as a response to the growing need for examin-\ning electronic health literacy. But, as the authors earlier sug-\ngest, items in eHEALS tend to reflect efficacious beliefs\n(i.e., \"I know how to use the Internet to answer my health\nquestions,\" \"I have the skills I need to evaluate the health\nresources I find on the Internet\"), rather than literacy-based\nitems. In any case, eHEALS has been found to be a tight fit-\nting scale with high correlational values and a strong body\nof support (Knapp, Madden, Wang, Sloyer, & Shenkman,\nmultiple languages (e.g., Koo, Norman, & Chang, 2012;\nMitsutake, Shibata, Ishii, Okazaki, & Oka, 2011).\nResearchers have used NFC as an interaction term with\nother constructs. Individual attitudes such as trust in media\nsources may interact with gratifications sought when people\nshape their media usage (Tsfati & Cappella, 2005). Some\nresearch has investigated the interactive effects of NFC; for\ninstance, Priester and Petty (1995) examined source credibil-\nity and its interaction with NFC on persuasion and message\nprocessing. They found that message processing of low NFC\nindividuals tended to be influenced by source credibility,\nwhereas high NFC individuals tended to be less influenced\nby source credibility. Here, NFC interacted with source trust-\nworthiness, providing an early rationale for NFC as an inter-\naction term. More recently, Tsfati and Cappella (2005)\nexamined the role of NFC as interacting with media skepti-\ncism and the joint effect on media exposure. NFC signifi-\ncantly interacted with media skepticism in the effect on\nmainstream news exposure--which Tsfati and Cappella\nargue that, as NFC goes up, the connection between news\nskepticism and news exposure disappears, thus supporting\nNFC as a moderator.\nWith regard to online information seeking behaviors,\nLustria (2007) conducted an experiment to examine the\neffects of web interactivity on comprehension and attitudes\ntoward health websites and whether individual differences\nmoderated the effects. In that research, two websites on skin\ncancer were created by the researcher and evaluated by par-\nticipants. Lustria found that whether or not the website had\ninteractive information affected comprehension and atti-\ntudes, and predicted that high NFC individuals would have a\nhigher comprehension score of website information com-\npared with low NFC individuals. This is compelling because\nit suggests that high NFC individuals are more likely to\nengage in effortful information-seeking behaviors, and fur-\nthermore, that they understand more than those who do not\nenjoy thinking as much; importantly, comprehension is a\ncritical facet of eHealth literacy.\nThose higher in NFC may be more willing to invest time\ninto satisfying that cognitive need, such as exposing them-\nselves to new information, resulting in a decrease in selective\nexposure of media sources (Tsfati & Cappella, 2005). When\nNFC is high, the likeliness to have a cognitive need to seek\nout health information could also be high. On the other hand,\nwhen NFC is low, people may be less likely to seek out infor-\nmation online if they do not have a reason.\nResearch Design\nTo increase generalizability in the findings, this study used a\nsurvey design with university undergraduate students.Asurvey\ndesign (Alreck & Settle, 2004) allowed the researchers to\ndirectly ask participants questions about their use of the Internet\nfor health purposes, the critical issues recommended by the\nCDC for college students, and answered the NFC and eHEALS\nscales. The present manuscript addresses the following ques-\ntions: First, does need for cognition have a relationship with\nwhether an individual has sought out health information online,\nand second, does it predict future intent to seek out health infor-\nmation online? With new measures like eHEALS, is there\nsome relationship between level of cognitive exertion and this\nscale? The following research questions are offered:\nResearch Question 1: Will high NFC individuals will be\nmore likely to have sought out health information\nonline than low NFC individuals?\nResearch Question 1a: Will high eHEALS individuals\nwill be more likely to have sought out health informa-\ntion online than low eHEALS individuals?\nResearch Question 2: Will individuals who score high\non the NFC scale will also be high in self-efficacy,\naccording to the eHEALS scale?\nResearch Question 3: Will NFC moderate the relation-\nship between health literacy/efficacy (eHEALS) and\nhealth information seeking behavior?\nFinally, in an attempt to contextualize the contribution of\nNFC and eHEALS, we sought out the relationship between\neHealth literacy and healthy behaviors in the areas identified\nas key by the Centers for Disease Control: substance abuse,\nsleep, vaccination, sexual health, diet, and mental health. As\nsuch, the final research question asks,\nResearch Question 4: Does eHealth literacy contribute\nto healthy behavior?\nMethod\nOn IRB approval, data were collected in 2012 over a period\nof 3 months at a large Midwestern University in the United\nStates. An online survey was distributed in a computer lab to\nuniversity students. The survey was created to assess stu-\ndents'use of the Internet to address health concerns or issues.\nThe survey included the eHEALS scale (C. D. Norman &\nSkinner, 2006) and the abbreviated version of the Need for\nCognition scale (Cacioppo et al., 1984).\nA description of the survey is below, and the appendix\ncontains the full survey.\n4 SAGE Open\nStudy Tool: Survey Measures\nIn the survey, participants first answered a series of demo-\ngraphic questions, followed by a question that asked whether\nthey have a health condition that requires regular interaction\nwith a physician. Participants were not asked to elaborate on\nthis answer. The majority of participants did not report a con-\nAfter this, participants answered the eHEALS scale. Then,\nthey completed four questions relating to how they maintain\ntheir general health, followed by blocks of four questions in\neach of the following areas: exercise, substance abuse, sleep,\nvaccination, sexual health, diet, and mental health. These\nhealth areas were selected because they were listed as the\nAmerican College Health Association's (2012) recommen-\ndations based on extensive research as the key issues affect-\ning undergraduate students. Finally, participants responded\nto the NFC scale (unchanged). On completion of those ques-\ntions, participants had completed the survey and were\nthanked for their time. The survey instrument is included as\nan appendix.\nThe eHEALS scale1 is an 8-item measure of electronic health\nliteracy ( = .93) to measure users' knowledge, comfort and\nskills at finding, evaluating and using electronic health infor-\nmation (C. D. Norman & Skinner, 2006). Descriptives for\nscale was developed to potentially serve as a way to identify\npeople who may or may not benefit from referrals to an elec-\ntronic health intervention. However, given the questions of\nthe eHEALS scale, it can be argued that eHEALS is a better\nmeasure of electronic health self-efficacy. In the present\nmanuscript, study results point toward eHEALS as related to\nself-efficacy, rather than as a pure measure of literacy.\nNeed for Cognition\nThe Need for Cognition scale ( = .81; NFC) refers to the\ntendency to engage in cognitive efforts and to enjoy such\nefforts. The initial NFC included 34 items, and two proce-\ndures resulted in decreasing the number of items in the scale\nate items that denoted ** were reverse coded. The descrip-\nResults\nAtotal of 420 participants took the survey, ranging in ages 18\ndominantly reported Caucasian/White as their ethnicity\nand four missing values.\nResearch Question 1 asked, \"Will high NFC individuals\nwill be more likely to have sought out health information\nonline than low NFC individuals?\" We ran a linear regres-\nsion using the control variables of gender and age and the\nquestion \"I have used Internet resources to help me under-\nstand or manage my health needs this semester\" as the\ndependent variable and need for cognition scale as the pre-\ndictor. The results of this regression are given in Table 1. No\nrelationship was found between these variables (r = .036, p <\n.501). A second model regressed NFC onto intent to seek out\nhealth information (as opposed to past behavior), and again,\nQuestion 1 was not supported.\nResearch Question 1a asked \"Will high eHEALS indi-\nviduals will be more likely to have sought out health infor-\nmation online than low eHEALS individuals?\" Research\nQuestion 1a regressed the eHEALS score with \"I have used\nInternet resources to help me understand or manage my\nhealth needs this semester.\" A significant relationship was\nported, albeit with a small relationship (see Table 2 for the\nregression model).\nResearch Question 2 asked \"Will individuals who score\nhigh on the NFC scale will also be high in self-efficacy,\naccording to the eHEALS scale?\" For Research Question 2,\na linear regression was run with the question \"I have used\nInternet resources to help me understand or manage my\nhealth needs this semester\" as the dependent variable and the\neHEALS score as the predictor (see Table 3). When the NFC\nscore was entered into a regression model with eHEALS\nscore as the dependent variable, a positive relationship was\nfound (r = .179, p = .001). There was a small but significant\nrelationship that at least suggests that individuals high in\nNFC may also be high in Internet health self-efficacy, accord-\ning to eHEALS.\nFinally, Research Question 3 suggested that as NFC\nincreases, the relationship between health self-efficacy and\nTable 1. Regression Model on High NFC Individuals Likeliness to Seek Out Health Information Online.\nB SE  t Sig. Zero-order Partial Part\nNote. NFC = need for cognition.\nBritt and Hatten 5\nhealth information seeking behavior becomes stronger. For\nResearch Question 3, an interaction term was created\n(eHEALS \u00d7 NFC). A linear regression showed that the inter-\naction between eHEALS and NFC was not a significant pre-\ndictor of health information seeking behavior (p = .792).\nThus, Research Question 3 was not supported.\nResearch Question 4 asked, \"Does eHealth literacy con-\ntribute to healthy behaviors?\" in the areas identified by the\nCDC as crucial for college students, including substance\nabuse, sleep, vaccination, sexual health, diet, and mental\nhealth. To answer this question, a composite term Healthiness\nwas created by taking the mean of each of the areas of sub-\nstance abuse, sleep, vaccination, sexual health, diet, and\nmental health. The mean of Healthiness was M = 3.66, SD =\n0.53. For R1, a linear regression was run with eHEALS as\nthe dependent variable and the predictors Age, Gender, and\nHealthiness composite. With all components in the model, a\nshows the full model. Indeed, when looking at the full model,\nafter controlling for Age and Gender, Healthiness contrib-\nuted 21.3% of the variance in the model, and was significant\nat p = .0001. Based on these results, we have evidence that\nsuggests that eHealth literacy may contribute to healthy\nbehaviors. However, because this was a preliminary ques-\ntion, we recommend further studies examine the relationship\nwith these constructs in much greater depth.\nDiscussion\nThe first research question asked if high NFC individuals\nwould have been more likely to seek out health information\nonline than those who do not. Although support for this\nresearch question was not found, demographic factors should\nbe considered. It may be that this particular population have\nnot been as active, given that they are a younger demographic\nand may not have had as many experiences to necessitate\ntime spent seeking out this health information. A recent\nreport from the Pew Internet and American Life Project\n(2010) found that the \"millennial\" generation--today's teens\nand young adults in their twenties--are split among their\nhealth information seeking online. According to that report,\nmation on the Internet, but groups above the age of 17 are\nmore likely to begin to use the Internet for health informa-\ntion. In fact, according to the Pew Internet and American\nLife Project, 72% of adults aged 18-29 look for health infor-\nmation online, although it is unclear how that breakdown\noccurs in that age range. Given that the average age of par-\nticipants in the current study is 20.48, it may be that at this\npoint in their lives, it is simply too soon to tell whether such\na difference exists. It may also be that as a college demo-\ngraphic, health issues may not have been as salient for this\npopulation. Finally, this population may not have been the\nmost generalizable group because participants were under-\ngraduates. At the same time, it is curious that high scoring\neHEALS individuals were more likely to have sought out\nhealth information online. It may be that there is a greater\nconnection with health self-efficacy and health information\nthan there is with whether one is high or low in their need for\ncognition. As such, there remains a need to test eHEALS and\nhealth information seeking behaviors with other populations,\nincluding young adults.\nAlthough Research Question 1 did not find a relationship\nbetween high NFC individuals and health information seek-\ning behaviors, support for Research Question 1a suggests\nthat individuals who are higher in eHEALS are more likely\nto seek out health information online. This is consistent with\nother research that has found a positive relationship between\nliteracy skills and seeking out information (Kinengyere,\non perceived ability to use Internet resources, this makes\nsense. Findings from Research Question 1a suggest a need to\nexamine the role of health self-efficacy and information\nseeking behaviors among different demographics. It also\nTable 2.

Regression Model Predicting High NFC Scores Are Also High in Self-Efficacy.\nB SE  t Sig. Zero-order Partial Part\nNote. NFC = need for cognition; eHEALS = eHealth literacy.\n6 SAGE Open\nsuggests the role of enhancing self-efficacy in online health\ninterventions, as individuals with higher self-efficacy are\nmore likely to seek out information on particular health\nissues. Similarly, the relationship between eHEALS and high\nNFC scores (Research Question 2) was found to be signifi-\ncant, which makes sense, given that both measures attempt to\nbetter understand individual characteristics in cognitive need\nand perceived capability.\nWhen examining the role of NFC as a moderator between\neHEALS and health information seeking behaviors, no rela-\ntionship exists. While NFC was positively related to eHEALS\nand information seeking, it could be that it serves more of a\npredictive, rather than moderating role. Recent research\nexamining the role of NFC as either a predictor or moderator\nin a smoking intervention found NFC did not moderate the\nrole of a tailored intervention on actual smoking abstinence\nResults for Research Question 4 indicated that high levels\nof eHealth literacy do contribute to individuals engaging in\nhealthy behaviors (e.g., physical activity), a finding sup-\nported by earlier work (Neuhauser & Kreps, 2010). This\nrelationship could be causal in either direction: Individuals\nwho have high eHealth literacy, by definition, are more able\nto understand healthy behaviors and their benefits, and thus\nengage in these behaviors more frequently. On the other\nhand, individuals who frequently participate in healthy\nbehaviors might have the vocabulary, experiences, and moti-\nvation to help them discover and better understand health\ninformation online. Further work in this area can more\nclosely evaluate this relationship.\nConclusion\nThis study examined the role of a relatively new but vali-\ndated measure (eHEALS) that seems to be a relatively valid\npredictor of whether an individual has the capacity to engage\nwith eHealth information sources. There are several limita-\ntions in the study, however. Firstly, while young adults were\nselected purposefully for the present study, various demo-\ngraphics should be examined in future research. This type of\nresearch should study mothers and fathers of young adults in\ncollege and compare their use of the Internet for health-infor-\nmation seeking behaviors, in addition to exploring how they\nthemselves understand eHealth. Elderly adults should also be\nexamined in terms of their ability to use the Internet for\nhealth information, whether they are successful in finding\nwhat they look for, and what their recommendations are for\nimprovement, which would be helpful in understanding web\nusability as well.\nIn addition, while this research suggests that eHEALS\ncould be a potentially better measure of efficacy rather than\nliteracy, it did not directly study the role of self-efficacy on\nelectronic health information seeking behaviors. Future\nresearch should seek to study the eHEALS measure more\nclosely with traditional efficacy research.\nThis study had mixed results with regard to the role of\nNFC and eHEALS. The results from this study point toward\na need to develop intervention materials when conducting\neHEALS research and more closely examine how NFC oper-\nates within that frame. For instance, a prime way to develop\nan intervention would be one on making decisions about get-\nting the HPV vaccine. That would include providing priming\nmaterials, which could be in print or another media, and con-\ntain statements that are gain or loss framed with regard to\ngetting the vaccine (Rothman, Martino, Bedell, Detweiler, &\nSalovey, 1999). Gain-framed messages seem to positively\ninfluence preventive health behavior (Witting, Boere-\nBoonekamp, Fleuren, Sakkers, & Ijzerman, 2012). The way\nan individual high in NFC interprets those types of messages\ncould lend critical insight into the factors that contribute\ntoward getting the vaccine--and even more so on a theoreti-\ncal level.\nMultiple avenues for further research exist based on these\nresults. A replication of the study with a broad demographic\nmay give information as to whether demographics were a\nfactor with the lack of support for NFC. It may also be that\nhighly cognitive individuals may be more motivated to seek\nout health information online, but that NFC simply is not the\nbest measure to capture that information. Further research\nshould continue to assess, quantitatively and qualitatively,\nthe need for cognition, along with emerging measures on\nhealth literacy and self-efficacy, to better understand such\nbehaviors.\nFinally, need for cognition states that high cognitive\nmisers are more likely to engage in thought-provoking acts,\nwhereas low cognitive misers are less likely to think in-\ndepth. The theory behind eHEALS (Norman & Skinner,\n2007) is that it purports that electronic health literacy com-\nprises assessing comfort and skill in using information tech-\nnology for health. For instance, in a clinical environment,\nTable 4. Regression Model of eHealth Literacy on Healthiness.\nB SE  t Sig. Zero-order Partial Part\nBritt and Hatten 7\neHEALS can potentially serve as a way to identify those who\nmay or may not benefit from eHealth resources and interven-\ntions. But to better assess this outcome, eHEALS should be\nconnected to need for cognition because its items focus on\npatient efficacy, rather than traditional literacy skills. Indeed,\nto a lesser extent, eHEALS is a tool for usability testing of a\ngiven health web site or technical interface based on the self-\nefficacy of a patient. Considering the need for high or low\nthought should be included in this framework because it can\ndirectly affect the way users interact with a health web site\nbased on its messages, images, and multimedia content.\nInterventions that subsequently connect eHEALS to cogni-\ntive thought not only makes it more valuable from a usability\nperspective, but for better assessing the user.\nThe implicit connection between eHEALS and NFC\nhas implications for future interventions on eHealth in\nterms of literacy, efficacy, and message strategy. Indeed,\nNFC has shown to moderate the processing of health\ninformation (Williams-Piehota, Schneider, Pizarro,\nMowad, & Salovey, 2003), because the meaning behind\nthat information is processed in different ways. For\ninstance, findings from Williams-Piehota et al. (2003)\nshow that messages tailored to high or low NFC individu-\nals tended to be better at persuading mammography\nscreening.
