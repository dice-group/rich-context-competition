Patients with eGFR !60 ml/min\nper 1.73 m2 were excluded from the study.\nThe institutional review board of Yonsei\nUniversity Medical Center approved the\nstudy and all subjects provided written\ninformed consent prior to enrolment.\nStudy design\nPatients were randomly allocated to either\nthe control or nicardipine groups using a\ncomputer generated randomization method.\nAccording to the double-blind method-\nology, the patients, anaesthesia provider\nand the anaesthetist collecting the data\nwere blinded to the composition of the\nstudy groups. An independent researcher\nprepared the syringes containing the study\ndrug.\nAnaesthesia and surgery\nOn the patient's arrival at the operating\ntheatre, standard monitoring devices were\napplied and a 20 G catheter was inserted into\nthe radial artery under local anaesthesia to\nenable arterial pressure monitoring and\nblood sampling. Anaesthesia was induced\nusing 2 mg/kg propofol i.v. and tracheal\nintubation was facilitated using 0.6 mg/kg\nrocuronium i.v. The patient's lungs were\nmechanically ventilated with 50% oxygen in\nair at a tidal volume of 8\u00ad10 ml/kg and a\nrespiratory rate of 8\u00ad12 breaths/min to\nmaintain an end-tidal carbon dioxide of\nAfter induction of anaesthesia, patients in\nthe nicardipine group received 0.5 mg/kg per\nmin nicardipine continuous intravenous\ninfusion, and those in the control group\nreceived the same volume of normal saline\nthroughout the duration of surgery (until\nanaesthesia was reversed). Infusions were\ncarried out using an Orchestra\u00d5 infusion\ndevice (Fresenius Kabi, Bad Homburg,\nGermany). Anaesthesia was maintained\ncontinuous intravenous infusion and 1\u00ad3%\nsevoflurane. Ringer's lactate solution\nand normal saline were infused at a rate of\n10 ml/kg per h throughout surgery.\nPneumoperitoneum was induced by\ncarbon dioxide insufflation (12\u00ad15 mmHg)\nand patients were positioned in a 30 head-\ndown tilt. The robotic system (da Vinci\u00d5\nSurgical System, Intuitive Surgical Inc.,\nMountain View, CA, USA) was controlled\nvia telemanipulation by a surgeon at the\nmaster console. Pneumoperitoneum was\nreleased after the removal of the prostate.\nData collection\nIntra-abdominal pressure and the duration\nof pneumoperitoneum and anaesthesia were\nrecorded. Mean arterial pressure, heart rate\nand central venous pressure were recorded\nand arterial blood gas analyses were per-\nformed at three time points: prepneumoper-\nitoneum (10 min after intubation, before\nsurgical incision and with the patient in\nthe neutral position); pneumoperitoneum\n(1 h after the induction of pneumoperito-\nneum, with the patient in the 30\nhead-down tilt position); and postpneumo-\nperitoneum (20 min after the release of\npneumoperitoneum).\nSerum creatinine and haemoglobin were\nquantified every day at 06:00 hours, and the\ncorresponding eGFRs were calculated 1 day\nbefore surgery (baseline) and on postopera-\ntive days (POD) 1 and 3. The highest serum\ncreatinine concentration during the post-\noperative hospital stay was recorded.\nPostoperative urine output was recorded\nfor 3 days. Ringer's lactate solution was\ninfused at 1\u00ad2 ml/kg per h during the post-\noperative period. Postoperative data were\nanalysed by an investigator (H.H.) who was\nblinded to the composition of the study\ngroups.\nStatistical analyses\nData were expressed as mean \u00c6 SD or n.\nSample size was calculated based on eGFR\nSDs from an earlier study.10 It was deter-\nmined that 49 patients were required in each\ngroup to give a power of 80% to detect\n-level of 0.05, using the independent t-test.\nBetween-group comparisons were made\nusing 2 test, Fisher's exact test, Student's\nt-test, or Mann\u00adWhitney U test, as appro-\npriate. Within-group changes in serum cre-\natinine concentration and eGFR were\nmade using Student's t-test and Bonferroni\ncorrection. Statistical analyses were per-\nformed with SPSS\u00d5 version 16.0 (SPSS\nInc, Chicago, IL, USA) for Windows\u00d5.\nP-values <0.05 were considered statistically\nsignificant.\nResults\nThe study enrolled 100 male patients (mean\nwere randomly allocated between the con-\ntrol and nicardipine groups (n \u00bc 50 per\ngroup). Demographic and preoperative clin-\nical data are shown in Table 1 and intra-\noperative data are shown in Table 2. There\nwere no statistically significant between-\ngroup differences in demographic, or pre-\nand intra-operative data.\nPostoperative data are shown in Table 3.\nIn the nicardipine group, serum creatinine\nconcentrations were significantly lower than\nboth comparisons), but there were no sig-\nnificant postoperative changes in the control\ngroup. There were no significant between-\ngroup differences in serum creatinine con-\ncentrations at any timepoint, highest serum\ncreatinine concentration, or the number of\npatients with postoperative serum creatinine\nAt POD 1 and POD 3, eGFR was\nsignificantly higher than baseline in the\nnicardipine group (P < 0.05 for both com-\nparisons; Table 3). In addition, eGFR was\nsignificantly higher on POD 3 compared\nwith baseline in the control group (P < 0.05;\nTable 3). There were no significant between-\ngroup differences in eGFR at any timepoint,\nhowever. The change in eGFR from baseline\nto POD 1 was significantly higher in the\nnicardipine group than the control group\nThere were no significant between-group\ndifferences in urine output or change in\nhaemoglobin concentration (Table 3).\nNo major postoperative complications\nrequiring repeat surgery or postoperative\nintensive care occurred in either group.\nDiscussion\nContinuous infusion of nicardipine during\nRALRP increased postoperative eGFR in\nthe present study of patients with renal\ninsufficiency. This increase in eGFR was\nsignificantly different from the control\ngroup at postoperative day 1. Low-dose\nnicardipine (0.5 mg/kg per min) appears to\nattenuate the deleterious effects of pneumo-\nperitoneum and the marked head-down tilt\nin the immediate postoperative period after\nThere is a strong correlation between\noperative morbidity and mortality.11\nFollowing open surgical procedures, the\nmorbidity and mortality of patients with\nrenal failure reach almost 50% and 4%,\nrespectively.12 In addition, the immunocom-\npromised status of patients with renal failure\nincreases their risk of wound infections.13\nMinimally invasive surgery is rapidly repla-\ncing open procedures in many areas of\nsurgery owing to the advantages it offers\n(reduced blood loss, lower incidence of\ncomplications, and shorter hospital stay1),\nTable 1.
