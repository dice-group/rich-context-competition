For those with chronic diseases, these needs are necessary to manage\ntheir condition and go beyond purely the health system. A literature search found that studies published on identifying the\nneeds of people with chronic diseases fall into the following categories: standardized tools, comparison of needs between\nindividuals and health professionals, tools for evaluation, and description of needs. This review highlights the gap between\ntools used to assess health care needs versus needs for health. It found that a considerable portion of articles focused solely\non health care needs. Many tools focused specifically on psychological or psychosocial needs and only one tool identified\nincluded a broad range of needs for health. The literature fails to address the wider needs of people with chronic conditions\nand is still focused on medical interventions. Given the disease burden and the impact of needs outside of the formal health\nsystem, needs assessments should be able to capture the full range and scope of the needs of an individual.\n",

However, what do we mean by the\nword \"need\" especially with regard to meeting the individu-\nal's need or needs in terms of health and health care?\nNeeds are what is necessary for humans to develop and\nneed is created by something that is lacking and creates a\nstate of \"disequilibrium\" (Doyal & Gough, 1991). Alderfer\n(1972) states that needs are required to be met for the \"main-\ntenance of homeostasis.\" Needs are something necessary to\nachieve a given state of being, for example, being healthy, a\nmember of a family, a worker, and so on (McLean &\nMcMillan, 2009). Most authors agree that meeting basic\nneeds prevents \"serious harm\" and death (Doyal & Gough,\nthis definition, specifically referring to the avoidance of ill-\nness and improvement of quality of life (Loewy, 1990; C. B.\nthat needs and the way they are met are often determined by\nexperts and not people who they are supposed to benefit.\nNeeds as defined by experts are referred to as normative\nneeds. In looking at normative needs, these are defined\nthrough guidelines. As experts may disagree and also evi-\ndence may change over time, differences may exist in these\nnormatively defined needs. It is also debatable if these needs\nare applicable to the population as a whole.\nNeed in health care is caused by some form of \"distur-\nbance in health and well-being\" (Donabedian, 1973). Cohen\n(1996) states that health care is a basic need as if the person\ndoes not receive this care he or she will greatly suffer from it.\nAlso health and therefore health care are necessary for par-\nticipation in society, which makes it an essential need\n(Loewy, 1990). In addition, needs in health care are \"teleo-\nlogical\" in that they serve a purpose rather than being needed\nthemselves (Asadi-Lari, Packham, & Gray, 2003a; Baldwin,\n1998). For example, the need for insulin itself is linked to it\nbeing necessary for survival. McKee (1996) discusses the\nrequirement to differentiate between the need for health care\nand the need for health. The need for health care is based on\ninterventions and can be viewed as a medical approach,\nwhereas health incorporates wider social issues. The Medical\nSubject Heading (MeSH) \"Needs assessment\" is defined as\n1University Hospitals of Geneva and University of Geneva, Switzerland\nCorresponding Author:\nDavid Beran, Division of Tropical and Humanitarian Medicine, University\nHospitals of Geneva and University of Geneva, Rue Gabrielle-Perret-\nEmail: david.beran@unige.ch\nNeeds and Needs Assessments: A Gap in\nthe Literature for Chronic Diseases\nDavid Beran1\n Keywords\nneeds, needs assessments, chronic conditions, diabetes\n2 SAGE Open\n\"Systematic identification of a population's needs or the\nassessment of individuals to determine the proper level of ser-\nvices needed\" (National Library of Medicine, 2012). This\nterm captures the difference discussed by McKee between\nhealth care needs and needs for health. This review will assess\nwhether for chronic diseases and diabetes needs assessments\nfocus on the delivery of health care services or address wider\nsocial issues to assess the gap in the literature.\nMethod\nEntering the term \"needs assessment\" into PubMed, with a\nlimit on the term only appearing in the title and abstract, no\nlimits on language and articles published in the past 20 years\nyields 2,418 results. Adding the search term of \"chronic dis-\nease\" yields 18 results. From these, 9 were excluded as it was\nfelt that they did not fit in with this precise definition of the\nMeSH term. For example, 3 of these articles focused on the\nneeds of professionals for specific training. This process is\ndetailed in Figure 1.\nFurther hand searches of articles referenced in these publi-\ncations by the author enabled another 75 articles to be identi-\nfied. Again, the MeSH definition of needs assessment was\napplied focusing only on publications dealing with chronic\nconditions or diabetes, but no limit was placed on time of\npublication. A specific focus on diabetes was also used to\nidentify some of these further publications. Diabetes was cho-\nsen as it has been argued that it is a good condition to be used\nas a tracer for health systems and their management of chronic\nNolte, Bain, & McKee, 2006). Each article was assessed\nbased on the definition and then classified into different cat-\negories as well as assessed if it addressed health care needs\nand/or needs for health.\nResults\nA total of 63 articles were reviewed to assess whether they\nassessed health care needs or needs for health. Fifty-eight\narticles focusing on chronic diseases or diabetes were classi-\nfied into the following categories:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Standardized tools;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Comparison of needs between individuals and health\nprofessionals;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Tools for evaluation;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Description of needs.\nEach of these types of tools plays a role in assessing the\nrange and scope of needs an individual may have taking dif-\nferent approaches. Five were specifically for diabetes and\nproposed frameworks for assessing need in diabetes. Of the\n58 articles, 23 of these (40%) did not address needs for health\nand focused solely on health care needs (see Tables 1-4). The\nfollowing sections detail the main tools as well as including\na summary table highlighting if both health care needs and\nneeds for health are assessed and which specific needs for\nhealth are included.\nStandardized Tools\nSpecific tools such as the Camberwell Assessment of Need\n(CAN) have been developed to measure the health and social\nneeds of people with mental health problems and have been\nused in various settings (Iliffe et al., 2004; Institute of\nPsychiatry, 2007). Specifically, for palliative care, the\n\"Problems and Needs in Palliative Care\" questionnaire\nassesses the needs of people and is used as a self-reporting\nquestionnaire (Osse, Vernooij-Dassen, Schade, & Grol,\n2007). It employs a checklist to help people identify their\nown needs and how and who should respond to these. This\nfocuses on different areas of need such as daily activities,\nphysical symptoms, autonomy, social issues, psychological\nissues, spiritual issues, financial problems, and other issues\nthe individual may have. Another tool is the \"Supportive\nCare Needs Survey\" (Bonevski et al., 2000). This tool has as\nits aim to assess the needs of people with cancer. It looks at\ndifferent types of needs psychological, health system, treat-\nment, information, and impacts on lifestyle of cancer.\nStandardized tools were also used to assess the needs of\npeople with diabetes. These focused on specific subpopula-\ntions, for example, adolescent females who live with Type 1\ndiabetes (Dickinson & O'Reilly, 2004) or Hispanic patients\nin inner city New York (Engel, Shamoon, Basch, Zonszein,\n& Wylie-Rosett, 1995). Other tools identified were used in\nspecific contexts such as assessing needs in clinical trials\n(Bradley, 1994) or identifying needs for a given patient during\nSearch term: \"Needs assessments\" entered into\nPubMed\nAdding term \"chronic disease\"\nApplying MESH deinition of \"Needs assessment\"\nResults: 9\nHand searches of 9 articles bibliographies\nApplying MESH deinition of \"Needs assessment\"\nTotal 63 articles included in review\nFigure 1.

Another structured tool\nin diabetes, the Diabetes Patient Assessment Questionnaire\n(DPAQ) focuses on improving the care process by collecting\nsubjective and objective data from the patients as well as\ncarrying out an assessment of their needs (Campbell &\nBennett, 2002). Table 1 summarizes the different tools\nincluded in this section as well as describing which needs\nthey address.\nTable 1.

Five out of 11 of these studies focus only on\nhealth care needs (Table 2). Many of these studies note that\nthere are significant differences in the needs identified by\nprofessionals versus those seen as important by patients\nRuggeri, Mazzi, & Dall'Agnola, 2000; Lauri, Lepisto, &\nTools for Evaluation\nPoland, English, Thornton, and Owens (1970) define basic\nclinical needs of a hospital-based pediatric population as\n\"dietary,\" \"vital signs,\" \"cleanliness,\" \"suction,\" \"oxygen\ntherapy,\" \"toileting\" and \"turning.\" Poland et al. (1970)\nargue that these needs should be used as a measure of hospi-\ntal-based care rather than beds as each bed is occupied by a\npatient with very different needs depending on the reason for\nhis or her admission.\nTable 3.

DAWN = Diabetes Attitudes, Wishes, and Needs.\nThree studies use the CAN as tool for evaluation, one for\npsychiatric reform in Sweden (Arvidsson, 2003), another\nwith regard to outreach programs in the United Kingdom\n(R. MacPherson, Gregory, Slade, & Foy, 2007), and a third\nlooking at the link between meeting needs and Quality of\nLife (QoL) showing that unmet needs may not be a direct\nlink to poor QoL, but rather act as an influence on this (Slade\net al., 2004). Other approaches looked more at satisfaction\nof needs, looking to see if specific symptoms that children\nhad were responded to appropriately by the health system\n(Liberatos, Elinson, Schaffzin, Packer, & Jessop, 2000),\npeople's expectations and satisfaction with health care\nworkers (Bendtsen & Bjurulf, 1993), or if the consultation\nassessments for chronic diseases were also used by Chan\nthe needs of populations following natural disasters. It is\ninteresting to note that the majority of these studies do not\nevaluate needs for health, but rather health care needs\n(Table 3).\nDescription of Needs\nOther studies identified take a descriptive approach to the\nneeds of people with different chronic diseases and diabetes.\nA study of ethnic minority needs in cancer care by Moadel,\nMorgan, and Dutcher (2007) looked at unmet needs, unmet\npsychosocial needs, and \"unwanted needs.\" \"Unwanted\nneeds\" were those that did not fit with what individuals\nwanted and may have a negative impact. Needs for people\nwith cancer have been identified such as emotional, physical,\ndaily life, support, financial issues, information, and spiri-\ntual, but Moadel et al. state that it is unclear if they are appli-\ncable to the specific subpopulation they studied. This s of\nneeds for health that these studies highlight range from eco-\nnomic support, food, and psychological as described in Table\n4. In looking at health care needs, many studies focus on\ninformation needs, information on medicines, and their side\neffects (Beatty, Oxlad, Koczwara, & Wade, 2008; Coker,\n2003; Jansen, van Weert, van Dulmen, Heeren, & Bensing,\ndescribes those informational needs that include aspects such\nas understanding the actual procedure, anatomy and physiol-\nogy, management of risk factors, changes in lifestyle, and use\nof medicines.\nOne of the key problems identified in tailoring the\nresponse to the needs of the individual was that health care\nworkers are focused on treating the specific disease and do\nnot address the patient as a whole (Asadi-Lari et al., 2003b;\nBrown, 1963). This issue was highlighted in a variety of\nstudies where the specific needs of the elderly were not taken\ninto account (Deck, Richter, & Huppe, 2009; King, Martin,\nMorrell, Arena, & Boland, 1986). Other research shows that\npsychosocial/psychological needs are often not addressed\nwith a few studies specifically looking at diabetes and\ndepression (Claiborne & Massaro, 2000; Joska & Flisher,\nFive studies looking at diabetes take different approaches\nto identify needs. Hawthorne et al. (2011) looked at children\nand their parents' experience and how this should be used to\ninform practice. A cross-cultural assessment of need was\nconducted by Smide, Ekman, and Wikblad (2002) in Sweden\nand Tanzania with regard to different levels of satisfaction\naround different aspects of treatment in these two countries.\nTwo studies looked at needs of people with diabetes in sub-\nSaharan Africa, Msoka, Lugina, and Smide (2006) identify-\ning needs by looking at the quality of life of people with\ndiabetes and those without diabetes in Tanzania and de-Graft\nAikins (2004) in Ghana by taking a critical social-psycho-\nlogical approach. One of the largest needs assessments with\nregard to diabetes was the Diabetes Attitudes, Wishes, and\nNeeds (DAWN) Study conceived and initiated by Novo\nNordisk1 (Alberti, 2002). The aim of the DAWN study was\nto increase the \"understanding of the role psychosocial fac-\ntors play with regards to diabetes outcomes\" and to find\nways to \"improve the psychosocial management related to\nIt also had as its objectives to increase the understanding of\npatient perceptions surrounding diabetes and to identify the\nmain psychosocial barriers and solutions to improve man-\nagement of diabetes (Novo Nordisk, 2001). This study\neral) from Australia, Poland, Denmark, France, Germany,\nIndia, Japan, Norway, Spain, Sweden, The Netherlands,\nUnited Kingdom, and United States (Novo Nordisk, 2001;\nFrameworks for Assessing Need in Diabetes\nIn addition, for diabetes, specific frameworks with regard to\nneed were developed. For example, in exploring the experi-\nences of children with Type 1 diabetes, Miller (1999) finds\nthat children's descriptions could fall into the following\nthemes and subthemes:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"Finding out\"\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"Daily discipline\"\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"Being normal\"\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"Good things\"\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"Bad things\"\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"Support\"\nDickinson and O'Reilly (2004), in a study to gain insight\ninto the lives of adolescent females with Type 1 diabetes,\nused Van Manen's phenomenological framework, which\naims to describe and interpret lived experiences. They ana-\nlyzed five themes:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"Blending in with the adolescent culture\"\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"Standing out and being watched\"\n6 SAGE Open\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"Weighing the options and making choices\"\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"Being tethered to the system and to diabetes\"\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"Struggling with conflicts\"\nThe Zuluaga\u00adRaysmith model defines 10 basic needs for\nelderly people focusing on not only health issues but also\nbasic needs:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Physical health;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Mental, emotional, social, and spiritual health;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Income;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Accommodation;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Protection and security;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Knowledge;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Mobility;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Communication;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Self-development;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Need to make a contribution.\nThe model states that a deficit in any one of these may\nhave a negative impact on well-being.\nColes (1996) describes three models of adjustment to dia-\nbetes in that the physiological needs concern the manage-\nment of symptoms and everyday life, emotional needs relate\nto the distress level of the person with diabetes, social needs\nare linked to the person with diabetes' relationships and\ninteractions with others, and finally self-actualization with\nthe ability to function effectively with diabetes. Using this\nmodel, Coles states that lower needs need to be met first\nbefore moving to higher needs.\nIn a study looking at what children with Type 1 diabetes\nknow and want to know about their condition, Olsen Roper\net al. (2009) found that six themes emerged from this study:\n\"Care,\" \"Physiology,\" \"Consequences,\" \"Impact on the fam-\nily,\" \"Experience at time of diagnosis,\" and \"Cure.\" The care\ntheme was divided into three subthemes with Physical,\nEmotional, and Ambiguous care. Physical care was the prac-\ntical aspects of managing diabetes, such as insulin adminis-\ntration, diet, and on. Emotional care was linked to dealing\nwith the emotional and psychological aspects of diabetes.\nThe authors created the theme \"Ambiguous care\" for ele-\nments that could not be placed in the other two care sub-\nthemes. Physiology knowledge related to how the body\nworked, the impact of diabetes, and the science behind the\ndisease. Consequences related to the short- and long-term\ncomplications of diabetes. Impact on the family related to\nhow family members assisted children in the management of\ndiabetes.\nConclusion\nThis review of the literature was by no means systematic but\nhad as its aim to highlight the gap between tools used to\nassess health care needs versus needs for health. It found that\na considerable portion of articles focused solely on health\ncare needs. Many tools focused specifically on psychological\nor psychosocial needs. Different studies presented a variety\nof needs assessed from sexuality and intimacy to food, but\nonly the CAN addressed a wide range of needs. A medical\nview of needs is taken and, in some instances, these studies\nwere more \"satisfaction surveys\" or looking at the failings of\nguidelines or consultations than true assessments of needs.\nThese tools developed for chronic diseases or diabetes are\nstandardized and very specific and do not allow for a wide\nview or variation of needs for people at different disease\nstages and also in different contexts to be studied. The\nDAWN study focuses too much on psychological issues as\nwell as not presenting its methodology in detail. Msoka et al.\n(2006) fail to combine both the wider issues and clinical\ndo the opposite with too much of a medical focus.\nOsse, Vernooij-Dassen, de Vree, Schade, and Grol (2000),\nin a review of tools used to assess the needs of people with\ncancer and their families during palliative care, find that\nmost tools developed failed to address all aspects palliative\ncare and that these tools were often for research purposes and\nnot adapted to the clinical setting. Wen and Gustafson (2004),\nin a review, find that the tools developed did not always look\nat the needs at the different stages of the person's disease.\nThe focus of the MeSH term is on the population's needs\nor the individuals' to determine the proper level of services\nneeded. The focus of the literature is still very much on med-\nical interventions and not needs outside of the health system.\nFor people with chronic conditions, these needs may be more\nimportant than what is provided by the health system. It is\nimportant in addressing the burden of chronic diseases to\nlook beyond specific health system needs as most of the time\nthe individual manages his or her condition falls outside of\nthe realm of the health system (Beran, 2014). In parallel,\nnonmedical needs may affect clinical management and there-\nfore the health system needs to be aware of these and be able\nto include this in the management of the individual to ensure\ngood overall health.\nThe development of tools to assess the needs of patients\noften do not include the beneficiaries themselves and assess\nthe needs that health care workers feel are important\n(Richardson, Sitzia, Brown, Medina, & Richardson, 2005).\nThese assessments also fail to clearly define what they mean\nby need as all needs cannot be met by the health system, but\nin some cases it is important that the health care worker\nknows that this need is or is not met. Richardson et al. (2005)\nargue that needs assessments should be used\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 As a communication tool for the interaction between\nhealth care workers and their patients;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 As an integral part care;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 To identify patient needs;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 To identify areas where patients want health care\nworkers to focus on;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 To reassess the given situation of a patient;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 With a view that the outcomes should assist with clini-\ncal care;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 For monitoring and evaluation.\nTo provide adequate care for chronic conditions, govern-\nments need to assess the health needs of their populations\nand this should include the social, financial, or cultural fac-\ntors that can be potential barriers (Bobadilla, 1996; Kay,\nBengoa, & Assal, 2006; World Health Organization [WHO],\n2007). Needs are infinite, whereas resources for the health\nsystem are finite (Bobadilla, 1996), and therefore with\nincreasing need and limited resources, there is a widening\ngap between what people need and what can be provided.\nWith the increase in chronic diseases, these needs are also\nbecoming more complex and also should be adapted to each\nMcKee (1996), people managing health systems should\nidentify the needs of users of the health system and find a\nway to prioritize these. Therefore, a wider approach to care is\nneeded with an assessment of the individual's needs as an\nintegral part of the care process (Slade et al., 2004).\nInterventions would then take into account not only the clini-\ncal aspect of the illness but also all unmet needs the individ-\nual faces.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nNote\n1.
