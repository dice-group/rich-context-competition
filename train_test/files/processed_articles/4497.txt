    "abstract": "Abstract\nMindfulness should be associated with decreased automatic responding and with increased empathy and compassion.\nTherefore, given an opportunity to express judgments about other people, a highly mindful person should be less inclined\nto express negative and unnecessary judgments. The present study provided participants the opportunity to express\njudgments about photographs of other people in a procedure that attempted to control for potential demand characteristics\nassociated with self-report measures of mindfulness. Expressed judgments were panel rated, and the derived judgment\nscores were regressed with participant scores on the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) and the Five Facets of\nMindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ). Results demonstrated no overall significant relationship between judgments and MAAS\nor FFMQ total scores. However, a significant relationship between judgment scores and the \"act with awareness\" and the\n\"non-judgment\" facets of the FFMQ was observed. Judgment scores were also related to self-reported involvement in\nmindfulness activities such as meditation and yoga. These results suggest that self-reported mindfulness may not completely\nalign with behaviors that logically reflect right mindfulness. Moreover, social judgment may be a useful overt measure\nrelated to mindfulness. The results also provide empirical evidence of the very strong social tendency to negatively and\noften derogatorily judge other people.\n",

Although defini-\ntions and perspectives on mindfulness range from its Eastern\norigin in Buddhism to its practice in Western behavioral sci-\nence, mindfulness pertains to particular qualities of attention\nand awareness. In the West, mindfulness has been growing as\na psychological approach to cultivate positive mental health,\nand is often viewed as a technique or collection of techniques\nto produce psychological outcomes (Grossman, 2011; Hayes\n& Wilson, 2003). Whereas in the East, the practice of mind-\nfulness has existed for more than 2,500 years and is consid-\nered \"the heart\" of spiritual meditation (Thera, 1962). Yet,\nKabat-Zinn (2003) has argued that we are all mindful to a\ncertain degree, that \"it is an inherent human capacity,\" while\nthe role of Buddhism in mindfulness is \"to emphasize simple\nand effective ways to cultivate and refine this capacity and\nbring it to all aspects of life\" (p. 146).\nMindfulness training in clinical settings increases aware-\nness of automatic reactions to sensations, thoughts, and emo-\ntions that increase emotional distress and attempts to reduce\nthe vulnerability to these mind states. For example, mindful-\nness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) has been utilized to\nreduce the inclination toward negative thinking patterns that\nlead to depressive episodes. Patients are taught to \"disiden-\ntify with or `decenter'from negative self-evaluative, rumina-\ntive thinking patterns\" and interrupt the automatic habit of\nnegative thinking patterns and negative emotion (Hick &\n1999). Mindfulness interventions may also be an effective\ntreatment for chronic pain (Green & Bieling, 2012; Kabat-\nZinn, Lipworth, & Burney, 1985), stress (Shapiro, Schwartz,\neating disorders (Kristeller & Hallett, 1999), bipolar disorder\n(Weber et al., 2010), and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD;\nMany studies of cognitive processing and mindfulness\ntheory argue that our typical mode of operating is dominated\nby automatic processes that reduce our quality of experience\n(.

Automatic processes arise without awareness, inten-\ntion, or interference from other ongoing mental activity\nAccording to Usoof-Thowfeek, Janoff-Bulman, and\nTavernini (2011), automatic reactions even in deliberative\nprocesses become particularly evident when the deliberative\nresponse is associated with emotionally potent negative\nreactions (particularly disgust; Rozin, Lowery, Imada, &\nHaidt, 1999). Practicing mindfulness requires that one not\nonly observe their moment-to-moment experiences but also\ncompletely let go of (i.e., nonreact, to) such moments, par-\nticularly negative automatic reactions (Bishop et al., 2004;\nFrewen, Evans, Maraj, Dozois, & Partridge, 2008 Martin,\n(1992), there is potential for disconnection between oneself\nand one's own thoughts (i.e., \"the insight that one is not\none's thoughts\") that allows an individual to realize they\nhave \"a potential range of responses to a given thought\" (p.\n942). This range allows the individual to choose a response\nthat is deliberate, as opposed to automatic, resulting in more\nvolition of control.\nTo date, the investigation of mindfulness has almost exclu-\nsively utilized self-report as its primary measure. Many differ-\nent self-report scales have been created in efforts to measure\nmindfulness. The MindfulAttentionAwareness Scale (MAAS;\nformulated by Brown & Ryan, 2003), the Five Facets of\nMindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ; Baer, Smith, Hopkins,\nKrietemeyer, & Toney, 2006), the Cognitive and Affective\nMindfulness Scale (CAMS; Feldman, Hayes, Kumar, Greeson,\n& Laurenceau, 2007).), the Kentucky Inventory of Mindfulness\nSkills (KIMS; Baer, Smith, &Allen, 2004), the South Hampton\nMindfulness Questionnaire (\"MQ\"; Chadwick, Hember, Mead,\nLilley, & Dagnan, 2005), the Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory\n(FMI; Buchheld, Grossman, & Walach, 2001), the Toronto\nMindfulness Scale (TMS; Lau, Bishop, Segal, Buis, Anderson,\nCarlson & Devins, (2006)), and the Philadelphia Mindfulness\nScale (PHLMS; Cardaciotto, Herbert, Forman, Moitra, &\nFarrow, 2008) are some of the self-report measures that have\nbeen developed.\nThe MAAS, created by Brown and Ryan in 2003, consid-\ners mindfulness as \"an enhanced attention to and awareness\nof current experience or present reality\".(p. 822). It consists\nof 15 items with a 6-point Likert-type response scale with\npossible responses ranging from almost always to almost\nnever (Baer et al., 2006). Although the MAAS is among the\nmost commonly used form of mindfulness assessment, it\nprovides only one overall mindfulness score (much like the\nMQ); most other measures delineate multiple elements of\nmindfulness. Perhaps the most popular of these measures,\nthe FFMQ, divides mindfulness into five facets (mindful\nobservation, mindful describing, acting with awareness, non-\nreactivity, and nonjudgment), each with their own point\nvalue. In general, although mindfulness scales vary in differ-\nent ways, they all are self-report measures.\nThe self-report measure of mindfulness is likely to be\nresults from several studies have supported the validity of\nthe MAAS and FFMQ (e.g., Brown, Ryan, Loverich, Biegel,\n& West, 2011), there is still debate about the overall validity\nSauer et al., 2013). One problem may be that the adaptation\nof mindfulness to accommodate Western ideals may be dis-\nvery clear that self-report measures have common problems\nthat can lead to misinterpretations. Perhaps, most notably,\nself-report measures are associated with demand character-\nistics that may lead to biased responses (Vartanian &\nPowlishta, 2001). The term demand characteristic refers to\n\"task-orienting cues\" that may produce subject bias\n(Rosnow, 2002). For example, people often have a tendency\nto present themselves in a \"brighter light\" (social desirabil-\nity response sets) than they truly are . Vartanian and\nPowlishta (2001) performed a series of studies using the\nconcept of an imaginary audience to manipulate subject\nresponse. Subject's responses changed when they felt they\nwere being critically evaluated by the audience. Likewise,\nNichols and Maner (2008) found that having foreknowledge\nabout the nature of a study would affect the way that partici-\npants responded. Despite that psychologists are quite sensi-\ntive to the potential problem presented by demand\ncharacteristics, Nichols and Maner (2008) reported that few\nresearchers actually attempt to control for demand charac-\nteristics. Moreover, demand characteristics appear more\ninfluential when people are asked to rate themselves\n(Luchins, 2011). Thus, reporting about one's own \"mindful-\nness\" may be particularly vulnerable to such biases. Hipol\nand Deacon (2012) mentioned that \"Demand characteristics\nmay have artificially inflated respondents' endorsement of\ntechniques widely considered to be effective, such as those\nassociated with CBT\" (p. 184). We performed a review and\nmeta-analysis of published studies related to mindfulness\nfor inclusion of control procedures to decrease demand\ncharacteristics and potential subject bias. We conducted a\nsearch in the PsycINFO database (including only linked full\ntext publications) published between the years 2012 and\n2013. \"Mindfulness\" was entered as the search title, which\nresulted in 141 text-link studies. Each study was examined\nfor control procedures and/or the use of blinding or disguise\ntechniques, which would reflect concern for subject bias and\ndemand characteristics. None of the studies appeared to\nhave included any relevant control procedures, and only 12\nstudies described any concern for subject bias or demand\ncharacteristics. Therefore, self-report studies of mindfulness\nwould be served by the inclusion of control procedures for\ndemand characteristics and subject bias. Alternatively,\nexploration of alternative methods to measure mindfulness\nshould be explored (Feldman, Hayes, Kumar, Greeson, &\nHakan et al. 3\nMindfulness should reduce vulnerability to automatic\nresponses (Frewen, Evans, Maraj, Dozois, & Partridge,\n2008). Although emphasis has been placed on reducing vul-\nnerability to automatic self-ruminations, Grossman (2010)\nhas pointed out that automatic judgments of all kinds are sus-\npended by the mindful one (Bodhi, 1984). Apparently, auto-\nmatic responses are ubiquitous and include automatic\nattitudes toward the self, activation of social stereotypes\nPratto & Bargh, 1991), social judgment (Murphy & Zajonc,\nMonteith, Zuwerink, & Elliot, 1991). Negative information\nappears to be especially prone to automatic processing\nand bigotry are likely to involve automatic processes\nweight people are often automatically disliked, ridiculed,\nand judged to be lower in intelligence and many other social\ncharacteristics (e.g., DeJong, 1980; Grover, Keel, & Mitchel,\nThe current study measures the relationship of mindful-\nness to social judgments. We did this by simply asking peo-\nple their opinions about both famous and nonfamous people\npictured in a survey. The survey was described to partici-\npants as a public opinion survey to disguise its true nature\nand reduce potential reactivity. Pilot investigations indicated\nthat not only are people frequently willing to give such judg-\nments about people they generally know little about (whether\nthey are famous or not), they are also often negative and\nderogatory in those judgments. Participants' responses to the\n\"public opinion survey\" were then correlated with responses\nto the MAAS and to the FFMQ, which were both presented\nas \"self-reflection\" surveys. We argue here that negative\njudgments about people who are not directly known are\nlikely to arise from automatic processes and should be related\nto at least some components of common self-report mindful-\nness measures. Moreover, the mindful individual should be\nless inclined to express such judgments, automatic or not,\nbecause mindfulness is related to compassionate ethics\n(Greenberg & Mitra, 2015) and mindfulness training has\nbeen found to increase compassion, empathy, and \"perspec-\ntive taking\" (Kingsbury, 2009; Shapiro, Astin, Bishop, &\nMethod\nParticipants\nRoughly half of the subjects (n = 48/99) were randomly\nencountered at different school buildings around the campus\nof the University of North Carolina Wilmington (UNCW).\nResearchers approached participants who appeared to be\nalone and uninvolved in any consuming activities, such as\nhomework or eating. The participants were asked whether\nthey had 15 to 20 min to participate in a survey. If the partici-\npants agreed, a script was read aloud informing them that the\nfirst of three surveys was a \"public opinion survey\" about\npublic figures. The script explained that the survey responses\nwere anonymous and encouraged participants to answer the\nquestions as honestly as possible. Other participants (n = 51)\nwere recruited via a recruitment website and were offered\ncredit to participate in a scheduled laboratory assessment.\nThese participants were administered the same surveys in the\nsame way. The participants as a whole (n = 99) included 36\nmales and 63 females who were of an average age of 22 years\n(SD = 7.9 years). The education status of the sample included\nthree individuals with high school diplomas, 25 college fresh-\nseniors, seven graduate students, and three individuals with\npost graduate degrees. The sample consisted of people identi-\nfying as Caucasian (n = 85), Asian (n = 5), and Hispanic (n =\n9). All procedures were approved by the UNCW Institutional\nReview Board (IRB) for human subjects and researchers fol-\nlowed all ethical guidelines created by the IRB for studying\nhuman subjects. All subjects read and signed an informed\nconsent agreement describing their rights as participants.\nMaterials\nThe materials for this study included three surveys: the\n\"Public Opinion Survey\" (the Judgment survey; Appendix I),\nthe FFMQ (Baer et al., 2008), and the MASS (K. Brown &\nRyan, 2003). The researchers constructed the Judgment sur-\nvey, which was disguised as a \"public opinion survey\" when\npresented to the participants. The covert nature of the public\nopinion survey was intended to reduce demand characteris-\ntics and allow or entice expression of social judgments and\nopinions from the participant if they were prone to do so. The\nlogic utilized in the construction of the Judgment survey was\nthat a more mindful individual would be less likely to express\njudgments (particularly negative, unnecessary judgments),\nbecause the automatic nature of negative judgment and ste-\nreotyping is contrary to the practice of mindfulness. The\nJudgment survey began with a demographics page that col-\nlected specific information from participants including age,\ngender, current educational status, race, religious affiliation,\nand religious devoutness. The next five pages of the survey\nincluded pictures of five different individuals, of which three\nwere famous (to add credibility to the public opinion survey\ndisguise). Pictures were chosen with the following criteria:\nAll were of roughly the same size and image quality, and\nbased on research panel assessment, all pictures were pre-\ndicted to elicit negative judgments in many participants (how-\never, pilot investigations suggested strongly that almost any\nindividual presented in the photographs would be effective).\nTwo of the pictures were of anonymous individuals who were\nfound on the Internet by the researchers. The celebrity photos\n4 SAGE Open\nFigure 2. The distribution of MAAS scores was normally\ndistributed.\nNote. MAAS = Mindful Attention Awareness Scale.\nwere of pop singer, Justin Bieber; reality TV star, Snooki\nPollizi; and heavyweight boxing champion, Mike Tyson. The\ntwo anonymous pictures included one female and one male.\nThe female was shown in a suggestively provocative pose,\nwhereas the male was frequently described as being \"nerdy.\"\nBeneath each picture, the survey asked, \"Do you know who\nthis is? Who?\" and \"What do you think about this person?\" If\nparticipants did not know who the individual was, they were\nstill asked to give their opinion of the individual. Each photo\nwas followed by scales, where participants rated the individ-\nual on intelligence, style, and morality. The scales were\nincluded to reduce attention to the primary dependent vari-\nable (their open-response judgments). The final section of the\nsurvey was constructed to examine regressions between their\nexpressed judgments, and their involvement in yoga, medita-\ntion, or martial arts as well as other (disguise) activities\n(working out, watching TV, reading, listening to music, out-\ndoor recreations, shopping, and crafts). Participants were\nasked to rate how often they participated in each activity on a\nscale from 1 (not at all) to 7 (very frequently).\nThe FFMQ and MAAS were administered on computers\nthrough the \"Select Surveys\" website (http://appserv01.uncw.\nedu/selectsurveynet/SurveyList.aspx). The FFMQ is a\n39-item survey that was developed from the KIMS. The\nFFMQ measures five specific facets of mindfulness: observ-\ning, describing, acting with awareness, nonjudging of inner\nexperience, and nonreactivity to inner experience. Items\nrelated to these five facets are rated on a 5-point Likert-type\nscale ranging from 1 (never or very rarely true) to 5 (very\noften or always true). Higher scores are argued to reflect more\nvey that is also commonly used to assess the mindfulness of\nan individual. The specific purpose of the MAAS is to mea-\nsure the presence or absence of attention to, and awareness of,\nthe present moment. Each question describes an event, and\nrespondents indicate on a 6-point Likert-type scale ranging\nfrom 1 (almost always) to 6 (almost never) how often they\nrecall experiencing that event (K. Brown & Ryan, 2003).\nProcedure\nThe participants were read a script that explained that three\nsurveys would be presented. The surveys were given in a spe-\ncific sequence with the Judgment survey presented first so\nthat the mindfulness surveys could not potentially prime par-\nticipants to respond more mindfully than they otherwise\nwould. The first pictured page of the Judgment survey (Justin\nBieber) was completed in an interview process with the\nresearcher to insure that they understood the nature of the\nquestions. The participants completed the rest of the survey\nindependently. Researchers were careful to avoid any discus-\nsion of the concept of mindfulness; and to further reduce\ndemand characteristics, the FFMQ and the MAAS were pre-\nsented as self-reflection surveys. The subset of participants\nwho were recruited around campus (n = 48) used researchers'\nlaptops to access the surveys. Participants in the lab (n = 51)\nutilized the lab computers.\nResults\nThree participants were excluded from the data analysis: Two\npeople did not finish the survey and another participant was\ndeemed to have provided inauthentic responses. The remain-\n(SD = 16.23). The means and standard deviations for each of\nthe FFMQ subscales, respectively, were FFMQ observe,\nindicated that the scores on these mindfulness measures were\nnormally distributed (see Figures 1 and 2).\nFigure 1. The distribution of FFMQ total scores was normally\ndistributed.\nNote. FFMQ = Five Facets of Mindfulness Questionnaire.\nHakan et al. 5\nThe Public Opinion Surveys (Judgments)\nThe researchers rated Judgment survey comments for each\nphoto (n = 5) on a 7-point Likert-type scale where 1 was\nextremely positive, 7 was extremely negative, and 4 was\nneutral. Scoring of expressed judgments differentiated\nbetween description, preferences, and outright derogatory\njudgments. Higher total judgment scores, therefore, were\nassociated with more negative and derogatory judgments.\nEach comment was read and rated independently (n = 4\nresearchers) and the average of the ratings was taken if\nthere was disagreement. The average total judgment score\nlated for each participant by adding five averaged ratings of\nthe participant's comments on the Judgment survey. A fre-\nquency analysis demonstrated relatively normal distribu-\ntion for \"total judgment scores\" (see Figure 3); many\ncomments were positive or neutral, but a significant pro-\nportion of the comments were negative (n = 68; mean judg-\nment scores above 4) or very negative (n = 20; mean above\n5). For example, derogatory comments such as \"Slut\" or\n\"Whore\" in reference to the anonymous female, and com-\nments such as \"lesbian fag\" in reference to Justin Bieber\nwere frequently encountered.\nTo conduct a simple regression between FFMQ, MAAS,\nand judgment scores, the judgment scores were first normal-\nized. Total judgment scores for each subject were divided by\n5 (the number of comments made by each participant) to pro-\nduce an average judgment score. The difference between the\naverage judgment score and 4 (the neutral point of our rating\nscale) was calculated. It was found that the normalized judg-\nment scores did not have a significant regression relationship\nwith the FFMQ total score, or the MAAS scores (see Table 1).\nA similar regression was assessed between the normalized\njudgment scores and each of the five facets of the FFMQ.\nSignificant relationships between normalized judgment\nscores and FFMQ subscales were found for only two of the\nfive facets, \"act with awareness\" (Figure 4) and \"non-judg-\nment of inner experience\" (Figure 5).\nThe relationship between normalized judgment scores\nand self-reported mindfulness activities such as, yoga, medi-\ntation, and martial arts was assessed (Figure 6). Because of\nrelatively low representation of any individual mindfulness\nactivity, self-reported involvement in yoga, meditation, and\nmartial arts were summed. The relationship of \"normalized\njudgment scores\" to reported mindfulness involvement was\njudgment scores were not significantly related to any other\nself-reported activities (TV watching, listening to music,\nshopping, working out, reading, outdoor recreation, and\ncrafts). Researchers then analyzed whether the MAAS or the\nFFMQ predicted participation in any of the listed activities.\nA significant relationship was indicated between the FFMQ\nand total mindfulness activity scores (mean mindfulness\nwas not observed between the MAAS and the total mindful-\nness activities score. The FFMQ or the MAAS did not pre-\ndict participation in any of the self-reported nonmindfulness\nactivities.\nAlthough positive judgments might be considered auto-\nmatic social responses, we considered the idea that positive\njudgments, in some way, differed from automatic negative\njudgments. Simple regressions were conducted in which sub-\njects who had positive judgment scores (generally made\npositive judgments about pictured individuals) were elimi-\nnated from analysis (n = 12). A regression of this data subset\n(the remaining normalized judgment scores that excluded the\npositive subjects) revealed significant regressions between\nthese judgment scores and the FFMQ total (r = .211), F(1,\ntrend relationship with FFMQ nonjudgment scores (r =\nnormalized data, without participants who demonstrated\npositive judgment scores with total mindfulness activities\ntrend relationship between the negative scores with MAAS\nAdditional simple regressions were run to assess the rela-\ntionship between self-reported mindfulness scores and\n\"judgment scores\" for celebrity versus anonymous photos.\nThe results were not significant; participants judged people\nsimilarly regardless of whether the pictured individual was\nknown or unknown. In addition, gender and age (though our\nage range was fairly truncated) did not appear to play a role\nin these effects.\nEach photograph was accompanied by rating scales for\nparticipants to provide further evaluations of the pictured\nindividuals.Although they were meant to be part of the exper-\nimental disguise, these ratings were assessed. The total rat-\nings across intelligence, style, and morality were summed,\nand a regression was conducted between summed ratings and\nFigure 3. The distribution of \"judgment\" scores was normally\ndistributed.\n6 SAGE Open\nthe judgment scores derived from their open-ended com-\nments. The relationship between these ratings and judgment\nscores demonstrated a strong positive relationship (Table 2\nand Figure 8); as FFMQ total scores increased, so did positive\nratings on these scales. Likewise, there was a significant\nregression relationship between scaled responses and FFMQ\ntotal (see figure 7), but not between these scaled response rat-\nings and other FFMQ subscales or MAAS scores (Table 2).\nDiscussion\nThe hypothesis of the present study was that mindfulness\nshould be inversely related to negative social judgments\nbecause mindfulness training reduces vulnerability to auto-\nMassion, Kristeller, Peterson, Fletcher, Pbert, Santorelli,\nempathy and compassion. Negative social judgments about\npeople who are not directly known to us are likely to reflect\nautomatic emotional reactions (e.g., Devine, 1989; Murphy &\nZajonc, 1993;). We recognize that one might refrain from\njudging for reasons unrelated to mindfulness, but we contend\nthat in general, the mindfully disposed individual should be\nless likely to express such judgment. We found meaningful\nregressions between \"judgment scores\" and two subcompo-\nnents of the FFMQ (\"act with awareness\" and \"non-judgment\nTable 1.

FFMQ = Five Facets of Mindfulness Questionnaire.\nHakan et al. 7\nof inner experiences\"). These two facets of the FFMQ do\nseem most logically related to automatic social judgment. We\nalso found that the tendency to judge negatively was inversely\ncorrelated with self-reported involvement in mindfulness\nactivities (meditation, yoga, and martial arts). This strength-\nens our confidence that social judgment measures are mean-\ningfully related to mindfulness (the same relationship was\nobserved between FFMQ total scores and mindfulness activi-\nties, but not for the MAAS). Yet, mindfulness practice did not\nassure lower judgment scores. Therefore, we may question\nthe validity of self-reported mindfulness involvement, or we\nmay question the notion that practice in, and of, itself guaran-\ntees actual mindfulness.\nThe fact that we did not see a significant relationship\nbetween MAAS scores or FFMQ total scores and our social\njudgment scores suggests possible issues in the self-report of\nparticularly that mindfulness surveys do not directly measure\nautomatic response tendencies or judgment of other people).\nIn addition to issues of bias, mindfulness surveys also require\naccurate self-knowledge and memory. This requirement may\nbe especially difficult given that we may recall inaccurately\nand that mindfulness is likely to vary across time and con-\ntext. A wider issue may exist in the debated connections\nbetween mindfulness as exercised and measured in our\nWestern culture versus \"right mindfulness\" that arises from\nBuddhist ethical traditions (Greenberg & Mitra, 2015).\nGreenberg and Mitra (2015) among others argue that mind-\nfulness without ethicality essentially is not mindfulness.\nWe were concerned in the present study about the poten-\ntial subjectivity associated with quantifying open-ended\njudgments. To address this concern, we utilized an indepen-\ndent panel rating process. Although this does not eliminate\nconcerns, we did find that our raters had very high inter-rater\nreliability (r = .87). Furthermore, the regression between our\nratings of judgment and the participants summed intelli-\ngence, style, and morality ratings were very strong. This can\nbe taken as support for the validity of our panel ratings.\nIf one accepts the logic that mindfulness should decrease\nautomatic social judgments, then the failure to find a signifi-\ncant relationship between judgment scores and either the\nFFMQ total, other FFMQ subscales, or the MAAS scores\nfurther suggests difficulties with these widely used self-\nreport measures of mindfulness. Self-report measures of per-\nsonal, internal, and subjective attributes are particularly\nvulnerable to the influence of demand characteristics and\nyet, it appears that the use of mindfulness surveys is rarely, if\never, accompanied by procedures to reduce this potential\nissue. Many studies of mindfulness are likely to have unin-\ntentionally included demand characteristics by studying peo-\nple who are engaged in certain mindfulness activities or by\nTable 2.

The present study used simple disguise and care-\nful dialogue to reduce subjects' knowledge about the nature\nof the surveys and to eliminate any information that might\nlead subjects to recognize our ultimate interest in their opin-\nions about \"public figures.\" Although we cannot say whether\nsubject bias influenced survey responding or not, we do\nargue that procedures to minimize subject bias should be a\nstandard in studies of mindfulness.\nThe present study provided participants the opportunity\nto express their opinions about selected famous and nonfa-\nmous individuals pictured in a paper survey. A potential\nconcern may be that the present results were specific to the\nphotos that were selected. The pictures were selected by a\npanel of researchers with the aim of including individuals\nwho would likely garner controversial opinions. However,\npilot investigations using a variety of different photo-\ngraphed individuals produced results that were entirely\nconsistent with the work reported here. The only apparent\ncriterion that seems necessary to elicit such judgments is\nthat the photo be at least slightly provocative. Although a\nsurvey was used, the responses to the survey are argued to\nbe an overt behavioral manifestation of relative mindful-\nness, because mindfulness training tends to reduce auto-\nmatic judgments (especially negative ones) and to increase\nempathy and compassion. The participants may have had\nsome knowledge of the famous individuals in the public\nopinion survey, based on media accounts of their behavior.\nWe argue that in reality, even famous people are only indi-\nrectly known by most of us, and that the media can greatly\ndistort their public representation. Nonetheless, there was\nno general difference in our participants' tendency to judge\npictures of famous versus nonfamous individuals. We do\nnot argue that mindful people are free from the tendency to\njudge or are immune from harsh judgment of others, rather\nthat there should be a lower tendency for this kind of\nexpression. Therefore, even if we had selected pictures of\noutrageous public personas, we believe that the mindful\nindividual will still be less inclined to judge. Perhaps, in\npractical terms, it is not possible for any human being to\nbe completely free of judgment. However it is better that\nour judgments are discerning ones, free of automatic,\nunchecked, emotionally generated, and potentially counter-\nproductive impulsive outcomes.\nA surprising proportion of judgments were generally\nnegative and a meaningful percentage (20%) expressed\nderogatory evaluations. Although it was not a primary issue\nfor our study, we think it is important to emphasize the fre-\nquency with which highly derogatory comments were\nencountered. Although we may all recognize that expression\nof negative derogatory opinions are often encountered\nwithin our culture, we may not realize the extent to which\nthey are occurring.\nConclusion\nWe have constructed a new measure that we argue represents\none overt reflection of right mindfulness. Automatic social\njudgments are easily elicited from participants in a way that\ndisguises purpose and, therefore, avoids some of the poten-\ntial pitfalls of self-report approaches to measuring mindful-\nness. Our results indicate that automatic social judgments are\nnot related to FFMQ total scores or to MAAS scores but are\nrelated to the FFMQ subscales \"act with awareness\" and\n\"non-judge.\" Social judgment scores did meaningfully pre-\ndict involvement in mindfulness type activities such as yoga.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAnderson, A.
