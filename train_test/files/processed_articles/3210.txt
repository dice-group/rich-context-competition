This is because many of the\neconomic variables are not directly observable to the banks, but markets can\nprovide information on such variables. In this paper, it is shown that the ability of\nthe bank to extract information from markets depends crucially on the credibility of\ninflation target.\nAn intuition behind this can be obtained from the following example. Consider an\neconomy in which the bank wishes to keep track of the natural interest rate, which\nis the equilibrium real interest rate under flexible prices. By keeping track of the\nnatural rate, the bank can offset the effects of changes in the natural rate on\ninflation. Assume that the bank cannot directly observe inflation expectations and\nthe natural interest rate. Suppose now that the bank observes an increase in\nnominal interest rates. There are two possible reasons. One reason is that the\nprivate agents may have revised their expectations about the inflation target.\nAnother reason is that future natural interest rate may have increased. When\ninflation target is perfectly credible, then the first reason would disappear. If the\nbank knows that inflation expectation is pinned down by its inflation target, it could\ninfer the natural interest rate from nominal interest rates. However, when the\ninflation target is not fully credible, the bank cannot tell if the observed increase in\nthe nominal rate is due to a revise in the perceived inflation target or due to a\nchange in the natural rate. This can de-stabilise inflation.\nWith this intuition, we show that under imperfect credibility the learning process\nof both private agents and the central bank causes higher order beliefs to become\nrelevant, thus increasing the persistence and volatility of inflation. This mechanism\nis capable of generating high persistence and volatility even though the underlying\nshocks are purely transitory.\nNicht-technische Zusammenfassung\nEine wichtige Aufgabe von Zentralbanken ist es, Informationen \u00fcber die\nwirtschaftliche Entwicklung insbesondere aus dem Verhalten der Finanzm\u00e4rkte zu\ngewinnen. Denn oft sind diese Variablen nicht direkt beobachtbar. In diesem\nPapier wird gezeigt, dass die F\u00e4higkeit der Notenbank, solche Informationen zu\ngewinnen, ganz wesentlich von der Glaubw\u00fcrdigkeit des Inflationszieles abh\u00e4ngt.\nDas folgende Beispiel soll dies intuitiv deutlich machen. Angenommen, die\nNotenbank will den nat\u00fcrlichen Zins, das hei\u00dft den Gleichgewichtszins bei flexiblen\nPreisen, realisieren. Die Bank soll nicht in der Lage sein, die Inflationserwartungen\nund den nat\u00fcrlichen Zins direkt zu beobachten. Wenn nun der Nominalzins\nansteigt, kann das zwei Gr\u00fcnde haben: Zum einen kann der private Sektor seine\nMeinung \u00fcber das Inflationsziel der Notenbank ge\u00e4ndert haben. Zum anderen\nkann der k\u00fcnftige nat\u00fcrliche Zins gestiegen sein. Wenn das Inflationsziel\nvollst\u00e4ndig glaubw\u00fcrdig ist, dann entf\u00e4llt der erste Grund. In diesem Fall kann die\nNotenbank den nat\u00fcrlichen Zins aus dem Nominalzins ablesen. Wenn aber das\nInflationsziel nicht vollst\u00e4ndig glaubw\u00fcrdig ist, dann wei\u00df die Notenbank nicht, ob\nder Zinsanstieg auf eine Revision des erwarteten Inflationszieles oder auf eine\nVer\u00e4nderung des nat\u00fcrlichen Zinses zur\u00fcck zu f\u00fchren ist.\nEntsprechend dieser Idee zeigen wir, dass bei unvollst\u00e4ndiger Glaubw\u00fcrdigkeit\nder Lernprozess des privaten Sektors und der Zentralbank (\u00fcber die Annahmen\ndes jeweilig anderen) dazu f\u00fchrt, dass die Unsicherheit der Vorstellungen (und\nandere Momente h\u00f6herer Ordnung) relevant werden und zu Persistenz und\nVolatilit\u00e4t der Inflation f\u00fchren. In der Tat kann die Persistenz und Volatilit\u00e4t gro\u00df\nwerden, obwohl die eigentlichen Schocks nur vor\u00fcbergehender Natur sind.\n1 Introduction\nThe objective of this paper is to analyse how uncertainty about inflation target\naffects the degree of uncertainty central bank faces and hence the stochastic\nproperties of inflation. When the private agents are uncertain about inflation tar-\nget, they generate their belief about the target, which we call `perceived inflation\ntarget'. It is in general quite difficult for the bank to observe perceived inflation\ntarget. First of all, there are no direct measures of perceived inflation target that\nare available for central banks. As proxies, several survey measures of long-term\ninflation expectations are available, for example, the Michigan Survey and the\nSurvey of Professional Forecasters in the case of the United States. Also, it is\npossible to extract information on inflation expectations from financial variables\nsuch as inflation-indexed bonds. However, private agents' inflation expectations\nare affected not only by their perceived inflation target but also by their expecta-\ntions about future conditions of the economy, such as future demand and supply\nshocks. Therefore, the measures of inflation expectations are only noisy mea-\nsures of perceived target. Recently, Bekaert et al. (2005) and Kozicki and Tinsley\n(2005) report their estimates of perceived inflation target in the United States. For\nreport that the perceived inflation target is estimated to be around 8%,1while\nBekaert et al. (2005)'s estimate is around 14%. From policy point of view, the\ndifference between 8% and 14% is too large -- the policy prescription can be\nvery different depending on which to believe. Those examples imply that it is not\na trivial task to extract information about perceived inflation target. As a result,\nthe private-sector uncertainty about inflation target creates uncertainty facing the\nbank about the perceived inflation target. In this paper, we focus our analysis on\nhow this uncertainty distorts bank's stabilisation policy, and draw some implica-\n1Their estimate of the target is around 3.5%.\ntions for inflation dynamics.\nIt is shown that uncertainty about inflation target contributes to inflation per-\nsistence and volatility through two channels. One channel is the private-sector\nuncertainty about the inflation target. The private-sector learning about the target\ncreates inflation persistence, as is shown in Erceg and Levin (2003). The other,\nwhich is our main focus, is the central-bank uncertainty about the perceived in-\nflation target. This uncertainty makes it more difficult for the bank to estimate the\nstate of the economy, leading policy errors. Thus the degree of uncertainty facing\nthe bank is endogenously determined by the credibility problem. In other words,\nimperfect credibility is bad not only because it fails to fix inflation expectations, but\nalso because it makes the bank's stabilisation policy more difficult.\nAn intuition behind this can be obtained from the following example. Consider\nan economy in which the bank wishes to keep track of the natural interest rate,\nwhich is the equilibrium real interest rate under flexible prices.2 By keeping track\nof the natural rate, the bank can offset the effects of changes in the natural rate\non inflation. Suppose now that the bank observes an increase in nominal interest\nrates. There are two possible reasons. One reason is that the private agents\nmay have revised their expectations about the inflation target. Another reason\nis that future natural interest rate may have increased. When inflation target is\nperfectly credible, then the first reason would disappear. If the bank knows that\ninflation expectation is pinned down by its inflation target, it could infer the natural\ninterest rate from nominal interest rates. However, when the inflation target is not\nfully credible, the bank cannot tell if the observed increase in the nominal rate is\ndue to a revise in the perceived inflation target or due to a change in the natural\nrate. This can de-stabilise inflation. With this intuition, we show that under imper-\nfect credibility the learning process of both private agents and the central bank\ncauses higher order beliefs to become relevant, thus increasing the persistence\n2In section 2 we will consider a model of this kind.\nand volatility of inflation. This mechanism is capable of generating high persis-\ntence and volatility even though the underlying shocks are purely transitory.3\nOur model can naturally connect the literature on monetary policy under data\nuncertainty and that on imperfect credibility. In a series of papers, Orphanides\nthe output gap and natural unemployment rate, was responsible for the `Great\nInflation' of the 1970s-1980s in the United States. While his work takes the mea-\nsurement problem as exogenously given, our paper shows that the measurement\nproblem can arise endogenously from lack of credibility.\nOur model also predicts that the measurement problem can decrease as mon-\netary policy gains more credibility. This implies that inflation becomes less volatile\nand less persistent. In recent years, a large amount of literature has documented\nchanging stochastic properties of inflation and output--the so-called `Great Mod-\neration'. For example, Benati (2004) reports that output and inflation in the UK has\nbecome less persistent and volatile since the UK introduction of inflation target in\n1992. Our model can explain this empirical fact. One of the controversial issues in\nthe literature is whether the Great Moderation was caused by good luck (shocks\nbecame smaller) or good policy. The existing literature has mainly supported the\ngood-luck hypothesis (See, for example, Ahmed et al. (2004), Stock and Watson\nin the literature may confuse good policy with good luck. His insight is that the\nexisting literature does not take into account the impact of systematic component\nin monetary policy on inflation expectations. That implies that any fluctuations\ncaused by de-anchored expectations may get confused with genuine non-policy\nshocks. In our model the change in the stochastic properties of inflation is purely\n3Woodford (2002) and Amato and Shin (2003) consider the roles of higher order beliefs in mon-\netary models. They consider higher order beliefs among firms under strategic complementarity\nand how this setting generates persistent effect of monetary policy. On the contrary, we focus on\nthe interaction of beliefs between private agents and the central bank.\ndriven by learning by both central bank and private agents. By using stochastic\nsimulation based on our model, we confirm Bernanke's conjecture.\nThe structure of the paper is as follows. The next section layouts the model.\nSection 3 derives equilibrium, and Section 4 analyses inflation dynamics in our\nmodel and draws policy implications. Section 6 concludes.\nWe present a very simple model of inflation determination. It consists of two\nequations: a Fisher equation that relates the nominal interest rate and the natural\ninterest rate (equilibrium real interest rate), and a monetary policy rule that sets\nthe nominal interest rate as the instrument of monetary policy. The model can\nbe interpreted as a model of inflation determination in an economy under flexible\n2.1 Structural equations\nThe first equation in our model is the linearised Fisher equation of the form:\nt = rn\nt\nwhere t is nominal interest rate at time t, rn\nt\nis the natural interest rate at time t, t\nis inflation rate at time t. The expectation operator Et|p represents the expectation\nconditional on the private-sector information at time t. The information set is\ndefined in Section 2.2.\nEquation (1) can be interpreted as a log-linear approximation to the Euler\nequation of the representative household in an endowment economy with flexible\nprices. A log-linearised Euler equation in such an economy is given by\nt = [(Et|pyt+1 - yt) - (Et|pgt+1 - gt)] + Et|pt+1, (2)\nwhere yt and gt are respectively the log-deviation of exogenous output and de-\nmand shock from their steady state values, and  is the inverse of the elasticity\nof intertemporal substitution. By denoting\nrn\nt\n [(Et|pyt+1 - yt) - (Et|pgt+1 - gt)], (3)\nwe obtain (1). Notice that rn\nt\nrepresents the equilibrium real interest rate under\nflexible prices, that is, the natural interest rate.5\nThe second equation in the model is a monetary policy rule. It is assumed\nthat the central bank chooses the nominal interest rate by following the simple\nmonetary policy rule:\nt = (t - \nt\n) + \nt\n+ Et|crn\nt\nHere \nt\nis the central bank's inflation target at time t, and Et|c is the expectation\noperator conditional on the bank's information set at time t. The information set of\nthe bank is specified in Section 2.2. Equation (4) assumes that the bank tries to\nkeep track of the path of the natural interest rate rn\nt\nconditional on its information\nset. We interpret this term as representing the stabilisation policy of the bank. As\nis shown in Section 2.3, the bank can offset the effect of the changes in rn\nt\non\ninflation by keeping track of rn\nt\n. Finally, by assuming  > 1, the monetary policy\nrule (4) satisfies the so-called Taylor principle.\n5See, for example, Woodford (2003) for this concept.\nWe assume that the inflation target consists of the long-run component (),\nand the transitory shock (t):\n\nt\n=  + t, (5)\nwhere t is i.i.d. with mean zero.This assumption is similar to Erceg and Levin\n(2003), who also assume that the inflation target varies due to a combination of\ntransitory and highly persistent shocks.6 Combining (4) and (5), one obtains\nt = (t - ) +  + Et|crn\nt\nwhere\nt  (1 - )t.\n2.2 Information structure\nNow we specify the information structure. On one hand, the private agents are\nassumed to know the monetary policy rule (4), including the parameter value for\n. They observe inflation rate t, the nominal interest rate t and the natural rate\nrn\nt\n. Later we assume that the central bank cannot observe the natural rate. As is\nshown in Aoki (2006), this assumption can be justified as the equilibrium informa-\ntion structure of a certain island economy.7The private agents also observe the\nbank's estimate of rn\nt\nat time t that is denoted by Et|crn\nt\n. The underlying assump-\ntion is the situation in which the bank publishes its assessment of the current\neconomic conditions.8 Following Erceg and Levin (2003), we assume that the pri-\n6They assume that the auto-regressive root of the persistent shock is 0.999.\n7Aoki (2006) considers an island economy where information is dispersed such that no one\ncan observe aggregate variables directly. However, the paper shows that the equilibrium of this\neconomy is equivalent to that of economy where there exits the representative household who\nhas perfect information regarding the aggregate states while the central bank does not.\n8By equation (3), this assumption is equivalent to the assumption that the bank announces\nits forecasts of the growth rates of demand shocks (such as the government expenditure) and\nvate agents cannot directly observe the underlying components of \nt\n, while they\ncan infer \nt\nfrom knowledge of the bank's reaction function. This may be either\nbecause the bank does not explicitly announce its long-run target , or because\nthe target is not fully credible. In this case, for example, when they observe a\nhigh nominal interest rate, they cannot tell whether this is because  is low or\nt is high. In each period, they update their belief about . Let Et|p be the\nperceived inflation target at time t conditional on the private-sector information at\ntime t.\nOn the other hand, the bank knows the form of the IS equation (2), including\nthe value of . It observes inflation, the nominal interest rate and the inflation tar-\nget. However it cannot observe the natural rate rn\nt\nand the private-sector inflation\nexpectations Et|pt+1. In our model, the latter assumption is equivalent to the as-\nsumption that the bank cannot observe the perceived inflation target Et|p. This\nimplies that, when the nominal interest rate is high, the bank cannot tell whether\nthis is because the natural rate is high or inflation expectation is high. In each\nperiod, the bank estimates the natural rate and the perceived target. Let Et|crn\nt\nand Et|cEt|p respectively denote the bank's estimate of the natural rate and\nthe perceived target conditional on the bank's information set at time t.\nIn equilibrium, the endogenous variables {t, t}\nsatisfies equations (1)\nand (6), taking the exogenous variables ({rn\nt\n, t}\n) as given. Expectations\nof each of the bank and the private agents are rational conditional on each of\nthe information set. Our main objective is to analyse the interaction between the\nuncertainty facing the private sector and the uncertainty facing the central bank,\nand to draw its implications for inflation dynamics. In order to be able to obtain\nclear results, let us focus on the simplest case. From now on, we assume the\nnatural interest rate and monetary policy shock are i.i.d. normal and independent\noutput. Publishing those forecasts are not uncommon in practice. For example, the Bank of\nEngland publishes its forecast of GDP in the Inflation Report.\nfrom each other. 9 More specifically, we assume\nrn\nt\nr\n\nIt is assumed that the distributions are known and common knowledge.\n2.3 Equilibrium when inflation target is observable\nAs the benchmark case, it is useful to discuss the rational expectations equilib-\nrium when  is known and common knowledge. In this case, the agents can\nalso infer t from the monetary policy rule (6), implying that the agents have per-\nfect information. It is then shown that information is fully revealed to the bank\nas well as to the private agents in equilibrium. In order to show this, suppose\ninformation is fully revealed in equilibrium. This implies that both the bank and\nthe private agents can infer time-t variables. It also implies that for any future\nvariables t+, Et|ct+ = Et|pt+  Ett+, where Et denotes the expectations\noperator under full information. In particular, the bank can infer rn\nt\nin equilibrium\nso that Et|crn\nt\n= rn\nt\n. Then, from (1) and (6), it is straightforward to show that the\nequilibrium inflation is given by\nSince monetary policy satisfies the Taylor principle, the equilibrium is uniquely\ndetermined. Because we assume t is white noise (8), equation (9) implies that\nEtt+1 = . The bank thus infer that inflation expectations are pinned down\n9We can extend our analysis to the case in which the natural rate follows an AR(1) process,\nwhich does not change our main results. The results in the the case of AR(1) are available upon\nrequest.\nby  even if it cannot directly observe expectations. Then, from (1) it can infer\nrn\nt\nbecause Ett+1 is identified. Therefore we have confirmed that information\nis fully revealed to the bank even though rn\nt\nis not directly observable. In other\nwords, when  is credible, the bank is not subject to uncertainty regarding the\nmeasurement of the natural rate.\nEquation (9) implies that inflation fluctuation does not involve any persistence\nwhen t is white noise. The other disturbance, rn\nt\n, does not affect inflation fluc-\ntuations because the bank fully offsets its effects on inflation. In this sense, the\nbank's stabilisation policy works perfectly. To summarise, once the bank's infla-\ntion target is known to the private sector and becomes common knowledge, all of\nthe uncertainty in the model disappears. Now let us analyse the equilibrium when\n is not credible.\n3 Equilibrium with uncertain inflation target\n3.1 Equilibrium given belief\nAlthough beliefs are determined endogenously in equilibrium, it is useful to see\nhow inflation depends on the beliefs of the central bank and the private agents.\nComplete analysis of the equilibrium is in Section 3.3. From (1) and (6), inflation\nis given by\nt\n- Et|crn\nt\nEquation (10) shows that t depends on the deviation of rn\nt\nfrom the bank's esti-\nmate Et|crn\nt\n. If one takes expectation of the both sides of (10) conditional on Et|c,\nBy solving this equation forward, the bounded solution for t in terms of the bank's\nbelief is given by11\nCompare (12) with (9). Equation (12) can be reduced to (9) when  is com-\nmon knowledge. In contrast, under our information structure, t depends on the\nsecond-order belief, namely, the bank's belief about Et|p. Intuitively, the bank's\ninformation problem is the inability to distinguish rn\nt\nand Et|pt+1, and the latter\ndepends on Et|p. An imprecise estimate of Et|p results in an imprecise\nestimate of rn\nt\n. This represents the negative feedback effect from the private-\nsector uncertainty about inflation target to the bank's estimate of the state of the\neconomy (rn\nt\n).\nAlternatively, one can take expectations of the both sides of (10) conditional\non Et|p and solve forward to obtain\nt =  - -1t + -1(Et|p - ) + Et|p\n\nt+j\n- Et+j|crn\nt+j\nThis expression implies that inflation depends on the perceived inflation target\nand the private-sector expectations about the bank's current and future estimation\nerrors of the natural rates.\n10Here we use the fact that Et|ct = t.\n11Here we use the fact that mj[Et|cEt|pEt+1|cEt+1|p...Et+j|cEt+j|p]-j-1t+j = 0 when\nt is bounded\nThe interaction between the uncertainty facing private agents and that facing\nthe bank also has implications for inflation expectations. Equation (12) implies\nthat\n.\nTherefore, inflation expectation Et|pt+1 is given by\nEquation (14) shows that Et|pt+1 = Et|p. Inflation expectation depends on\nthe third-order belief, that is, how the private agents expect that the central bank\nwill mis-estimate the perceived inflation target in the future. Inflation at time t\ndepends on the private-sector expectations about future monetary policy, and\ntherefore it depends on the private-sector expectation about how the bank will\nmis-estimate the natural rate in the future, as is shown in equation (13). The\nbank's estimate of the natural rates is related with its estimate of the perceived\ninflation target. Note that Et|pEt+1|crn\n= 0 even if Et|prn\n= 0. When the\nprivate agents expect that the bank's estimate about the perceived inflation tar-\nget is different from their own perceived target, they will expect that the bank will\nincorrectly estimate the natural rates. In other words, uncertainty about Et|p\ndistorts the bank's estimation of rn\nt\n, and the private agents understand this infor-\nmation problem the bank faces.\nNow we turn to the filtering by private agents and the central bank.\n3.2 Evolution of the private-sector belief\nIn each period, the private agents update their perceived long-run inflation target\n. From monetary policy rule (6), the observation equation for the private agents\nis given by\nt - t - Et|crn\nt\nThe left hand side of equation (15) is observable, and the right hand side is not. In\nequation (15), we use the assumption that the bank's estimate of rn\nt\nis observable.\nDenote by zt the linear combination of the observable variables of the private\nsector:\nzt  t - t - Et|crn\nt\n.\nUnder assumption (8), the distribution of zt is given by\n\nThe filtering problem of the private agents is to distinguish the transitory compo-\nnent t from the constant term (1 - ). This is a classic inference problem\nfrom a normal distribution with unknown mean and known variance. From now\non, it is useful to work with `precision,'   1/2\n\n, rather than variance 2\n\n. Let\nthe initial prior (at time 0) on (1 - ) be\nwhere \nis the initial prior about , and 0|p is the initial precision. Then the\nposterior mean after t observations is given by (see DeGroot (1970))\nEt|p =\nzt\nwhere \u00af\nt\nt\nzs. Define\nt \n.\nThen, one can rewrite (18) as\nEt|p = t\n+\n\u00af\nzt.\nThis means that Et|p is a weighted average of the initial belief \nand the\nnews \u00af\nz. Furthermore, since zt = (1 - ) + t, (18) can be expressed as\nEt|p = t\n+ (1 - t) +\n\u00af\nwhere \u00af\nt\nt\ns. Notice that t  0 as t  . Also, \u00af\nt  0 by the law of\nlarge numbers. Therefore, as the private agents observe more information over\ntime, they will eventually learn . Alternatively, we can write (19) in a recursive\nform:\nEt|p -  = bt(Et-1|p - ) +\nwhere\nbt \n,\nt|p  t-1|p + .\nEquation (20) gives the evolution of the perceived inflation target.\n3.3 Evolution of the bank's belief\nNext, we compute the optimal filtering problem by the central bank. The bank's\nobservation equation is given by the Fisher equation (1). The bank's observable\nvariable is the nominal interest rate t, and the unobservable variables are rn\nt\nand\nEt|pt+1 that is given by (14). Notice that Et|pt+1 is determined endogenously\nin equilibrium. Here it is necessary to solve the filtering problem and equilibrium\nsimultaneously, since equilibrium depends on the bank's policy, and the bank's\npolicy depends on its estimate of the natural interest rate.12 This estimate in turn\ndepends on the statistical properties of the bank's observables and the natural\nrate in equilibrium. In Appendix A, it is shown that the evolution of the bank's\nestimation error of the natural rate is given by\nrn\nt\n- Et|crn\nt\n= dt\nBt\nrn\n- Et-1|crn\n+ (1 - dt)rn\nt\nwhere Bt and dt are time-varying deterministic parameters that are given in Ap-\npendix A. Equivalently, it is shown in Appendix A the evolution of the bank's esti-\nmation error of the perceived inflation target can be written as\nEt|cEt|p -Et|p = dtbt Et-1|cEt-1|p - Et-1|p +(1-dt)\nt\nBt\nrn\nt\nThere is a close relationship between those estimates. Indeed, Appendix A shows\nthat the relationship is given by\nEt|cEt|p - Et|p =\nt\nBt\nrn\nt\n- Et|crn\nt\nEquation (23) implies that imprecise estimate of the perceived inflation target re-\nsults in imprecise estimate of the natural rate. This is due to the bank's inability to\ndistinguish inflation expectations and the natural rate when it observes the nomi-\nnal interest rate.\nmodels.\n4 Inflation dynamics under uncertain inflation tar-\nget\n4.1 Variance and autocorrelation of inflation\nNow we are able to complete our analysis of inflation dynamics. Using (12) and\n(23), Equilibrium inflation can be written as\nt =  - -1t + ~\n~\nt  -1 (Et|p - ) + (Et|cEt|p - Et|p)\nt\nBt\nrn\nt\n- Et|crn\nt\nwhere Et|p -  and rn\nt\n- Et|crn\nt\nrespectively evolve according to (20) and\n(21). The first two terms ( - -1t) of equation (24) are identical to (9), that\nis, the equilibrium inflation when the inflation target is credible.The term ~\nt rep-\nresents inflation fluctuations that are caused by the credibility problem. The term\n-1(Et|p - ) represents fluctuations that are caused by private-sector un-\ncertainty about the inflation target. When the perceived inflation target deviates\nfrom the true target, fluctuations in inflation expectations add more fluctuations to\nthe equilibrium inflation. The term -1t/Bt rn\nt\n- Et|crn\nt\nrepresents the fluctu-\nations caused by central-bank uncertainty about the perceived target. This term\narises from the bank's inability to distinguish the natural rate and inflation expec-\ntations when inflation target is not credible.\nEquation (20) implies that Et|p -   0 as t  , therefore that the\nprivate-sector uncertainty diminishes over time and the private agents will even-\ntually learn about . This in turn implies that the uncertainty facing central bank\nalso diminishes over time. Therefore, the contribution of ~\nt to overall inflation per-\nsistence and volatility decrease over time and t   - -1t as t  . We\ncan compute the variance and autocorrelation of inflation. In Appendix B, those\nare given by\n\n(bt - )2 +\n\n\nj=k\nt+j\n\nr\nt\n+\n\n\nj=k\nt+j\n\nk\n\n\n\nj=k\n\nr\n\n\nj=k\n\nk\nwhere gt  btdt and ht  t\nBt\n(1-dt). Since limt gt = 1, limt bt = 1 and\nlimt ht = 0, it is easily shown that the variance and autocorrelation satisfy13\nlim\nt\nV[t] = (/)2, lim\nt\nwhich correspond to the variance and autocorrelation of the inflation process\nwhen inflation target is observable (equation (9)).\n4.2 A reduced-form estimation of model-simulated data\nIn order to investigate the properties of inflation in our model further, we conduct\na simple stochastic simulation of our model. We generated 1000 sets of artificial\nnormally-distributed shocks of 40 periods in each set, and obtained the stochastic\nprocess of the inflation under the learning process of the private-sector and the\ncentral bank.\nThen, we consider the reduced-form dynamics of inflation by estimating an AR\nt = c + (L)t-1 + t, Vr[t] = 2\n\nBy model selection criterion (AIC), we set the AR lag order to one. The es-\ntimated AR parameter  , the standard deviation of the innovation 2\n\n, and the\nvariance of inflation Vr[t] are calculated for each data set, and the summary\nstatistics are averaged over 1000 sets. In order to examine how these statistics\nchange under the learning process of the private-sector and the central bank, an\nAR model is estimated over the first 20 periods and the second 20 periods sepa-\nrately. Note that our data frequency should be interpreted as annual rather than\nquarterly, since our model is a flexible price model.\nIn the simulation, several parameters must be specified. We choose the cen-\ntral bank's inflation target, , of 2%, and the private-sector prior in (17), \n,\nvalues are roughly in line with the US economy at the beginning of 1980s. With\nregard to the uncertainty that the central bank initially faces, E0|c\n- \n, we\nassume that it ranges from zero to five.14 The standard deviation of monetary\npolicy shock, , is set to 1%, and hence  = 1. According to Roberts (2004),\nation of natural rate of interest, r, is set to 1.5%, and hence r = 0.44. This\nvalue is based on the result of Laubach and Williams (2003), who estimate r as\nbetween 1.1 and 2.6 using US data. The policy coefficient, , is set to 1.5, like\nTaylor rule. Finally, we set the precision of initial prior, both 0|p and 0|c , to one.\nIn Appendix C we examine some robustness against changing those parameters.\nFinally, notice that we have assumed the structural shocks rn\nt\nand t are white\n14This range is in line with differences between the estimate of Bekaert et al. (2005) and Kozicki\n ]\n[\nt\nVar \n\n\n\n -\np\np\nc\nE\n|\n|\n|\n\n \n -\np\np\nc\nE\n|\n|\n|\n\n \n -\np\np\nc\nE\n|\n|\n|\n\n\nFigure 1: Time-varying persistency and volatility\nnoise processes. Therefore, the persistence reported below are purely driven by\nlearning by central bank and private agents. In reality, the natural rate can be a\npersistent process. This implies that the persistence reported below should be\ninterpreted as the lower bound that our theoretical model can generate.\nFigure 1 shows the simulation results. The following two features are of par-\nticular importance. First, as the difference in the initial beliefs between the private\nsector and the central bank, i.e. E0|c\n-\n, become large, both the estimated\nAR parameter  and the standard deviation of the innovation  become large in\nthe first-half period. A larger gap in initial beliefs between the private sector and\nthe central bank make the central bank's estimation of the economy more diffi-\ncult, which results in higher persistence and higher volatility of inflation process.\nSecond, for any value of E0|cE0|p - E0|p,  and  become smaller in the\nsecond half period than the first half period. This is because the private agents\nand central bank eventually learn about the inflation target and the perceived in-\nflation target respectively. Accordingly, both inflation persistence and the volatility\nof inflation decline in the second half period. Now we draw some implications of\nthis simulation result.\n4.3 Nominal anchor and measurement of economic activity\nFigure 1 shows that inflation is persistent and volatile in the early phase of learn-\ning. (20) shows that t has persistent effects on ~\nt through the private-sector\nfiltering. This implies that the private-sector uncertainty about  results in per-\nsistent inflation through learning. This agrees with Erceg and Levin (2003), who\nconsider a similar economy in which the private-sector learning about inflation\ntarget can make inflation process persistent.15 In our model, there is another\nchannel through which imperfect credibility contributes to inflation persistence\nand volatility, namely, the bank's uncertainty about perceived inflation target. The\nfact that the bank cannot directly observe perceived inflation target implies that\nit cannot identify inflation expectations and the natural interest rates. This fact\nde-stabilises inflation because it prevents the bank from fully offsetting the effects\nof the fluctuations in rn\nt\nOur model shows that the lack of strong nominal anchor and the measure-\nment problem of economic activity are closely related with each other. In a series\neconomic activity, such as the output gap and natural unemployment rate, was\nresponsible for the `Great Inflation' of the 1970s-1980s in the United States. He\nshows that in the 70s the real-time estimate of the natural unemployment rate\nwas too low and the estimate of the potential output was too high. This lead to\nexcess monetary expansion, resulting in high inflation. While his work takes the\nmeasurement problem as exogenously given, our paper shows that the imper-\nfect credibility can endogenously amplify the measurement problem. Our model\n15Erceg and Levin (2003) assume that the central bank has perfect information, which in our\nmodel corresponds to the case of E0|c\n- \n16See equation (6). When Et|crn\nt\n= rn\nt\n, then inflation does not depend on rn\nt\n.\nimplies that the measurement problem becomes serious when monetary policy\nlooses credibility. On the contrary, gaining credibility can make the measurement\nproblem less serious. This has important policy implications. If we take the mea-\nsurement problem as exogenously given, a policy prescription would be not to\nrespond actively to those economic variables subject to measurement errors. For\nexample, Orphanides and Williams (2005) argue that it is desirable for monetary\npolicy not to respond actively to the unemployment gap because the gap can be\nsubject to large measurement errors. On the other hand, our model implies that\ngaining credibility helps the bank to reduce the measurement problem.\n4.4 Learning and time-varying stochastic process of inflation\nFigure 1 shows that the persistence and volatility of inflation decline as both of\nthe agents and central bank learn. It is interesting to compare this observation\nwith some empirical studies. Recently, several articles have documented that\nmacroeconomic volatility in several OECD countries have declined over the past\ntwenty years -- the so called `Great Moderation.' 17\nFor example, Benati (2007) found that under inflation targeting inflation per-\nsistence declined significantly and exhibits almost no persistence in UK, Canada,\nSweden and New Zealand, while it was highly persistent between the breakdown\nof Bretton Woods and the introduction of inflation targeting. In Benati (2004), he\nfound that the volatility of GDP and inflation in the UK has decreased since the in-\ntroduction of inflation targeting in 1992. Our model can offer an explanation of his\nfindings. As inflation targeting becomes credible, the private-sector uncertainty\nabout the long-run inflation rate has decreased over time. At the same time, this\nhas a favourable feedback to the stabilisation policy of the Bank of England. A\ndecrease in the private-sector uncertainty has reduced the uncertainty facing the\nbank. As a result, the bank's stabilisation policy has improved, making inflation\nprocess less volatile and less persistent.\nOur simulation, even though it is stylised, has some interesting implication for\nthe econometric analysis of the Great Moderation. In the literature, two com-\npeting explanations for the Great Moderation are considered very likely. One is\n\"good policy\", i.e. improvements in monetary policy. Another is \"good luck\", i.e.\na fortuitous reduction in exogenous shocks. Several prominent studies have pro-\nvided support for the good-luck hypothesis. Roughly speaking, those econometric\nstudies interpret the changes in estimated parameters of the model as changes\nin policy or economic structure, and the changes in the variances of innovations\n(residuals) as representing the changes in underlying economic shocks. In our\nsimulation, both  and  in equation (27) change, implying that this looks as if\nboth good policy and good luck occur. However, in our simulation, what changed\nbetween the first subperiod and the second subperiod is the perceived inflation\ntarget and the bank's estimate of the perceived target. We kept the monetary pol-\nicy rule (6) and variance of shocks (, r) constant. This agrees with Bernanke\n(2004)'s view on the literature on the Great Moderation. He argues that the exist-\ning studies may incorrectly identify the effect of good policy as good luck. Econo-\nmetricians typically do not measure exogenous shocks directly but instead infer\nthem form movements in macroeconomic variables that they cannot otherwise\nexplain. When the central bank's inflation target is incredible, the change in de-\nanchored inflation expectation may result in what appear to be change in exoge-\nnous shocks. Shocks in this sense may certainly depend on monetary policy\nregime. Accordingly, as the inflation expectation becomes to be anchored grad-\nually, the standard deviation of innovation in the reduced form regression may\nbecome smaller even when the magnitude of exogenous shock (structural shock)\nis constant. This makes an econometric analysis based on reduced-form regres-\nsion incorrectly lead to good-luck bias. This is exactly what happened in our\nsimulation study. Imperfect credibility creates fluctuations in inflation expectations\nthrough the private-sector learning. This diminishes over time as agents learn.\nIn addition to this, imperfect credibility creates additional uncertainty facing the\nbank, which makes policy erratic. This also contributes to innovation variances\nthat diminish over time.\n5 Conclusion\nIn this paper, we analysed how private agents' uncertainty about inflation target\nand the central bank's uncertainty are related with each other. The model is ca-\npable of generating high persistence and volatility even when there is no intrinsic\npersistence and structural shocks are white noise. We also show that the degree\nof the bank's data uncertainty is endogenously determined by the degree of pri-\nvate agents' uncertainty about inflation target -- the measurement problem can\narise endogenously from lack of credibility. Although much of the previous litera-\nture has already suggested the great importance of considering data uncertainty\nin the conduct of monetary policy, it has taken the data uncertainty as exoge-\nnously given. Our model implies that decreasing the private agents' uncertainty\nabout inflation target can make the measurement problem less serious for the\ncentral bank.\nOur model can have some implications for yield curve. As Gurkaynak et al.\n(2005) shows, long-term nominal interest rates tend to be sensitive to changes in\ncurrent monetary policy actions when there is uncertainty about nominal anchor.\nThis is because current monetary policy actions bring some news about long-run\ninflation target. Our model predicts similar results. While their model predicts\n`shifts' in the yield curve in response to monetary policy, our model would predict\nboth `shifts' and `the change in slopes'. We plan to investigate this question in\nfuture research.\nFinally, it would be interesting to examine some other monetary policy regimes\nwith stronger nominal anchor. In the present paper, it is assumed that the bank\nchanges the nominal interest rate in response to deviations of inflation from its\ntarget value. It would be interesting to analyse price level targeting in the context\nof interest-rate rules, or monetary-aggregate control instead of interest-rate con-\ntrol. As is well known, price level targeting and monetary aggregate control have\nstronger nominal anchor than inflation targeting. It would be important to anal-\nyse how those different policy regimes perform under imperfect credibility about\nnominal anchor.\nAppendix\nA Bank's filtering problem\nA.1 Constructing an observation equation of the bank\nFrom (1) and (14), the bank's observation equation is given by\nt = rn\nt\nt+|p\nIn order to solve the bank's filtering problem, it is convenient to rewrite (A.1) in\nterms of \n. By taking the conditional expectation Et|c of equation (19) and\nsubtracting that conditional expectations from (19), we have\nEt|cEt|p - Et|p = t Et|c\n- \nand therefore\nEt|pEt+1|c\n- Et|p = t+1 Et|pEt+1|c\n- \nHere we use the fact that Et|p\n= Et|p. Equation (A.2) shows that what\nmatters to the difference between the perceived inflation target and the bank's\nbelief the perceived target is the difference of the initial belief (\n) between the\ntwo of them. As t  , the difference will disappear. This is because (19)\nimplies that the private agents eventually learn about the inflation target, and the\nbank knows this fact.\nSubstituting (A.3) into (A.1), one obtains\nt = rn\nt\n- \n.\nSubstituting (19) into the above equation, and collecting the variables that are\nobservable to the bank to the left hand side and the unobservables to the right\nhand side, one obtains\n\u00af\nt = rn\nt\n.\nEquation (A.4) involves the private-sector expectations about the bank's future\nbelief about \n. This is an implication of the forward-looking nature of inflation.\nThe term Et|pEt+1|c\ncomes from the last term in equation (A.1), which in turn\ncomes from private-sector inflation expectations about future monetary policy.\nThe private sector expectations about future monetary policy depends on their\nexpectations about the bank's filtering in the subsequent periods.\nNow the remaining task is to compute the equilibrium and the bank's filtering.\nThe right hand side of equation (A.4) still contains endogenous variables, namely,\nEt|pEt+1|c\n. This should be determined jointly with the bank's filtering. In the\nnext section, we will compute the equilibrium and the filtering by the method of\nundetermined coefficients. We first guess the equilibrium form and solve the\nfiltering given that guess, and then compute the equilibrium given the filtering.\nA.2 Deriving the equilibrium and the bank's filtering\nDefine Xt as the bank's observable variables (the right hand side of equation\nXt  t - (1 - t) -\n\u00af\nt.\nFirst of all, notice that, in this economy, the state of the economy can be repre-\nsented by Xt, rn\nt\n, \n, and Et-1|c\n. Therefore, we guess that the equilibrium\ntakes the following form:\nAtXt = rn\nt\n+ Bt\n+ CtEt-1|c\nwhere At, Bt, Ct are time-varying coefficients to be determined. Since Et-1|c\nis observable to the bank at time t, we can define the new observation equation\nof the bank as\nAtXt - CtEt-1|c\n= rn\nt\n+ Bt\nAgain, the left hand side is observable to the bank, and the right hand side is\nunobservable. Equation (A.6) shows that the bank's filtering problem reduces\nto the sequential updating of a constant, \n. A slight complication is that it\ninvolves a time-varying coefficient Bt. Define the new observable variable as Yt \nAtXt - CtEt-1|c\n. From the normality assumption (7), Yt is again normally\ndistributed:\nYt  N Bt\nr\n.\nLet the prior distribution be:\n,\nwhere t-1|c is the bank's precision at the end of time t - 1 (i.e., before the bank\nobserves time-t variables). Then the prior for Bt\nis given by (see DeGroot\nBt\n N BtEt-1|c\n,\nt\nThen, the posterior mean of Bt\nis given by\nBtEt|c\n= dtBtEt-1|c\nwhere\ndt \nt\nt\nr\n. The updating equation of t|c can be written as\nt|c =\nt\nUsing the definition of Yt, one can rewrite (A.8) as\nEt|c\n= dt - 1 - dt\nCt\nBt\n+ (1 - dt)\nAt\nBt\nThis implies that, at time t + 1,\nEt|c\nTaking expectations conditional on the private-sector information at time t, and\narranging terms, one obtains\nEt|pEt+1|c\n+ dt+1Et|c\nHere we use the assumption that the bank announces Et|c\nat time t. Sub-\nstituting (A.12) into (A.11), and then substitute the resulting equation into (A.4).\nThen we can verify that the equilibrium is indeed given by:\nAt\nBt\nXt\n= rn\nt\nBt\n.\nBy comparing our guess (A.5) and (A.13), we have the following three identities:\nAt\nBt\nBt\nBy substituting (A.9), we notice that equations (A.15) and (A.10) represent a sys-\ntem of deterministic (non-linear) difference equation with respect to Bt and t|c\nt\nt|c\nt\nt|c + r\nt|c =\nt\nOnce Bt and t|c are solved, dt is solved by (A.9), equations (A.14) and (A.16)\nrespectively solve At and Ct.\nNotice that equation (A.15) and (A.10) show that Bt depends both on Bt-1\nand Bt+1. Dependence on Bt-1 is just a direct implication of recursive filtering.\nDependence on Bt+1 is an implication of the interaction between forward-looking\nnature of inflation and the bank's filtering. In our model, the current equilibrium\nvariables depend on the private-sector expectations about future monetary policy.\nAnd future monetary policy depends on how the central bank will estimate the\nfuture state of the economy. This is represented in equation (A.12). Therefore,\nthe way the bank will estimate the state of the economy in the next period will\naffect the current equilibrium. As a result, the bank's filtering in the current period\nis affected by its filtering in future periods.\nfocus on `stationary' filtering by central bank, so that the Kalman gain is constant\nover time. In our model, since the bank's learning is about a constant \n, filter-\ning is not stationary. That is the main reason why the bank's Kalman gain, namely,\ndt is not constant over time. In general, even if the bank is estimating time-varying\nvariables, Kalman gains are not necessarily constant. Therefore, the dependence\nof equilibrium on the future Kalman gain of the central bank is a general property\nof rational equilibrium models with forward-looking private sector.\nLet us finish this section by characterising the stochastic properties of the\ncentral-bank uncertainty. By using (A.11), (A.5), and (A.15), the evolution of\nEt|c\nis given by\nEt|c\n= dtEt-1|c\n+ (1 - dt)\n+\nrn\nt\nSubstitution of (A.18) into (A.2) yields\nEt|cEt|p - Et|p = tdt Et-1|c\n- \n+\nrn\nt\n.\nEquation (A.19) clearly shows the dependence on the bank's current estimate\nof the economy on its future filtering (dt+1). It also shows that Et|cEt|p -\nEt|p  0 as t  .\nFinally, as discussed in 3.3, there is a close relationship between the bank's\nestimates of the perceived inflation target and the estimates of the natural rate.\nTaking the conditional expectation Et|c of equation (A.6) and subtracting that con-\nditional expectations from (A.6), we have\nrn\nt\n- Et|crn\nt\n= Bt Et|c\n- \nUsing (A.20) and (A.2), we can see that Et|cEt|p - Et|p represents the\nbank's estimation error about rn\nt\nEt|cEt|p - Et|p =\nt\nBt\nrn\nt\n- Et|crn\nt\nwhich is equation (23). Therefore, the central-bank uncertainty about the real rate\nand about the private-sector belief are related with each other.\nB Variance and autocorrelation of inflation\nWe can rewrite equation (24) as\nt =  + -1 (Et|p -  - t) + (Et|cEt|p - Et|p)\n  + -1 [t + t] , (B.1)\nwhere\nt  Et|p -  - t\nand\nt  Et|cEt|p - Et|p.\nBy using (20), t can be written as\nbt - \nBy using (22), t can be written as\nt = gtt-1 + htrn\nt\nwhere gt  btdt and ht = (1 - dt)t/Bt. Note that 0 < gt < 1, mtgt = 1,\nand ht > 0, limt ht = 0.\nSince t and rn\nt\nare independent so are t and t. Therefore we have\nV[t] = -2(V[t] + V[t]) (B.4)\nand\nEquation (B.2) implies that\nV[t] =\n\n\n(bt - )2 +\n\n\nj=k\n\n\nand\nCo[t, t-1] =\n\n\n\n\nj=k\n\n\n .\nSince 0 < bt < 1 and limt bt = 0 we obtain limt V[t] = 2\n\nand\nlimt Co[t, t-1] = 0.\nEquation (B.3) implies that\nr\n\nt\n+\n\n\nj=k\n\nk\n\nand\nr\n\n\n\nj=k\n\nk\n\nSince 0 < gt < 1, limt gt = 1, 0 < ht, limt ht = 0, we obtain limt V[t] =\nC Robustness analysis of Section\nIn this Appendix, we confirm that the above basic results shown in Section 4\nare robust against different parameters. Table 1 shows the parameter for four\nrobustness analysis.\nTable 1: Parameter values for sensitivity analysis\nCase 1: higher perceived target Initial perceived inflation target is set\nto 20 %. This may correspond to the case of the introduction\nof inflation targeting in some emerging countries. When Chile,\nIsrael and Hungary adpted inflation targeting, the inflation rates\nCase 2: less aggressive monetary policy  is set to 1.1, which is\nlower than the original Taylor rule\nCase 3: smaller monetary policy shock  is set to 0.5 % and\nCase 4: More stubborn belief The initial value of the private-sector\nprecision parameter, 0|p, is 10, which means that the private\nsector is more convinced by their own belief.\nFigure 2-5 shows that higher volatility of inflation in the first-half period results\nfrom higher perceived target (Case1), less aggressive monetary policy (Case2),\nlarger monetary policy shock (Case3) and more stubborn belief (Case4). In all\nthese cases, as in the benchmark case, the larger E0|c\n- \n, the larger the\nvolatility of inflation in the first-half period. Also, the estimated AR parameter ,\nthe standard deviation of the innovation  , and hence the volatility of inflation\nVr[t] become smaller in the second half period than the first half period.\nBenchmark ( , Black line) vs. Higher perceived target (  , Gray line)\n ]\n[\nt\nVar \n\n\n\n -\np\np\nc\nE\n|\n|\n|\n\n \n -\np\np\nc\nE\n|\n|\n|\n\n \n -\np\np\nc\nE\n|\n|\n|\n\n\n|\n=\n\np\n|\n=\n\np\n\nFigure 2: Robustness analysis: case 1\nBenchmark ( , Black line) vs. Less aggressive monetary policy ( , Gray line)\n.\n=\n.\n=\n\n ]\n[\nt\nVar \n\n\n\n -\np\np\nc\nE\n|\n|\n|\n\n \n -\np\np\nc\nE\n|\n|\n|\n\n \n -\np\np\nc\nE\n|\n|\n|\n\n\nFigure 3: Robustness analysis: case 2\nBenchmark ( , Black line) vs. Smaller monetary policy shock ( , Gray line)\n=\nu\n=\nu\n\n ]\n[\nt\nVar \n\n\n\n -\np\np\nc\nE\n|\n|\n|\n\n \n -\np\np\nc\nE\n|\n|\n|\n\n \n -\np\np\nc\nE\n|\n|\n|\n\n\nFigure 4: Robustness analysis: case 3\nBenchmark ( , Black line) vs. More stubborn belief ( , Gray line)\n ]\n[\nt\nVar \n\n\n\n -\np\np\nc\nE\n|\n|\n|\n\n \n -\np\np\nc\nE\n|\n|\n|\n\n \n -\np\np\nc\nE\n|\n|\n|\n\n\n|\n=\np\n|\n=\np\n\nFigure 5: Robustness analysis: case 4\nReferences\nAhmed, S., Levin, A., Wilson, B., 2004.
