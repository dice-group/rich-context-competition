The main pathophysio-\nlogical mechanism of PM is infiltration of\nCD8\u00fe T cells and macrophages into muscle\nfibers, leading to lysis of the muscle fibers.1\nIn clinical practice, we still depend on the\nphysician's clinical assessment, mainly\nincluding manual muscle strength testing\nand measurement of serum muscle enzyme\nlevels, to evaluate the disease activity and\nprognosis. The serum levels of many inflam-\nmatory factors are reportedly increased in\npatients with inflammatory myopathies,2,3\nand IL-6 may be a biomarker of disease\nactivity or outcome. Macrophage migration\ninhibitory factor (MIF) is a potent and\npleiotropic cytokine that is secreted by acti-\nvated T cells and macrophages and plays a\ncritical role in inflammatory and autoim-\nmune diseases. It has anti-apoptotic, pro-\nproliferative and pro-inflammatory effects\nand may act as a modulator in cytokine\nresponses.4 MIF plays important roles in\nmany inflammatory diseases. Interestingly,\nMIF can induce the cytokines IL-6 and\ntumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), which\nare known as the most useful biomarkers\nin patients with PM.3 MIF inhibitor can\nsignificantly decrease IL-6 and TNF-a pro-\nduction.5 Moreover, MIF is a modulator of\nglucocorticoid sensitivity and may thus\nimprove the status of high-dose glucocorti-\ncoid therapy in patients with PM. The con-\ncentrations of MIF in skeletal muscle are\nreportedly higher in patients with inflam-\nmatory myopathies.6 However, the signifi-\ncance of the serum MIF level in patients\nwith PM is still unknown. In this study,\nwe explored clinical significance of the\nserum MIF level in patients with PM.\nMaterials and methods\nPatients\nIn total, 36 inpatients with PM were\nenrolled in Zhejiang Provincial People's\n2014. Patients with PM satisfied the criteria\nwell as the consensus guidelines for PM in\nChina. We excluded patients with sporadic\ninclusion body myositis, muscular dystro-\nphy, and other myopathies. All patients\nunderwent muscle magnetic resonance\nimaging. Patients with overlapping syn-\ndromes were excluded. According to the\nestablished disease activity tools described\nby the International Myositis Assessment\nand Clinical Studies Group, we used the\nmeasures of global activity, muscle\nstrength, physical function, and laboratory\nassessment. Twenty-five patients had\nan active disease status and 12 patients\nwere in remission when serum samples\nwere obtained (two serum samples from\none patient were obtained: one during\nactive disease and one during remission).\nDetailed clinical and laboratory data were\ncollected. Patients with active disease were\ninitially administered 1.0 to 1.5 mg/kg/d of\nglucocorticoids, and the glucocorticoids\nwere gradually tapered according to the\nclinical assessment. Two patients were fol-\nlowed during treatment, and their serum\nsamples were obtained when related labora-\ntory data were checked every week. Serum\nsamples were voluntarily obtained from\n10 healthy age- and sex-matched controls.\nAll serum samples were stored at \u00c080C\nprior to analysis. The study was approved\nby the local ethics committee, and informed\nconsent was obtained from patients\nand controls.\nMethods\nEnzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for\nMIF. The serum MIF concentration was\ndetected by a commercially available\nELISA kit (Quantikine ELISA for human\nMIF; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN,\nUSA). According to the protocol, all of\nthe reagents, working standards, and\nserum samples were prepared before detec-\ntion. A total of 100 ml of Assay Diluent\nwell microplate, and 50 ml of standard, con-\ntrol, or serum samples was then added to\neach well. The microplate was incubated for\n2 hours at room temperature on a horizon-\ntal orbital microplate shaker. The micro-\nplate was then washed four times with\nwash buffer. MIF conjugate (200 ml) was\nadded to each well of the microplate,\nwhich was incubated for another 2 hours.\nAnother four washes were repeated. Next,\n200 ml of substrate solution was added to\neach well, and the microplate was incubated\nfor 30 minutes at room temperature.\nFinally, 50 ml of stop solution was added\nto each well, and the optical density was\ndetermined within 30 minutes using a\nmicroplate reader set to 450 nm.\nELISA for IL-6. The serum IL-6 concentration\nwas detected by a commercially available\nELISA kit (Quantikine ELISA for human\nIL-6; R&D Systems). According to the pro-\ntocol, all of the reagents, working stand-\nards, and serum samples were prepared\nbefore detection. A total of 100 ml of\nAssay Diluent RD1W was added to each\nstandard, control, or serum samples was\nthen added to each well. The microplate\nwas incubated for 2 hours at room temper-\nature on a horizontal orbital microplate\nshaker. After washing four times with\nwash buffer, 200 ml of IL-6 conjugate was\nadded to each well of the microplate, and\nincubation was performed for another 2\nhours. The microplate was washed another\nfour times. A total of 200 ml of substrate\nsolution was added to each well, and the\nmicroplate was incubated for 20 minutes\nat room temperature. Finally, 50 ml of stop\nsolution was added to each well, and the\noptical density was determined within 30\nminutes using a microplate reader set to\nStatistical analysis\nThe serum MIF concentration is expressed\nas the mean \u00c6 standard deviation.\nStatistical differences between two groups\nwere evaluated by an independent-samples\nt test. Spearman's correlation test was used\nto evaluate the relationship of the MIF\nconcentration and laboratory data or glu-\ncocorticoid dose. A p value of <0.05 was\nconsidered statistically significant. All data\nwere analyzed with the statistical software\npackage SPSS 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago,\nResults\nIn total, 36 patients with PM were enrolled,\ncomprising 29 women and 7 men with a\ncentration in 25 patents with active PM was\ntion in the 12 patients in remission was\nlower than that in the patients with active\nconcentration in the healthy controls was\nlower than that in patients with active PM\n(p \u00bc 0.045). However, there was no signifi-\ncant difference between the healthy controls\nand patients in remission (Figure 1).\nThe mean serum IL-6 concentration was\nin remission. These concentrations were sig-\nnificantly higher than those in controls (8.14\nmean IL-6 concentration in patients with\nactive PM was significantly higher than\nthat in patients in remission (p \u00bc 0.043).\nThe serum MIF concentration was\nnegatively correlated with the serum IL-6\n(Figure 2). When the serum samples were\nobtained, no significant difference in the\nserum MIF concentration was found\nbetween patients with active PM who were\nand were not receiving glucocorticoid thera-\npy. Additionally, no relationship was found\nbetween the serum MIF concentration and\nglucocorticoid dose. Other parameters, such\nas the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and\nserum levels of creatine kinase (CK), lactate\ndehydrogenase, aspartate transaminase, ala-\nnine transaminase, and C-reactive protein,\nshowed no significant correlation with the\nserum MIF concentration.\nTwo patients were followed up during\ntreatment. Both patients were newly diag-\nnosed and given 1 mg/kg/d of a glucocorticoid\nfor treatment. Patient 1 had muscle weakness\nfor 1 month when the treatment began, while\nPatient 2 had muscle weakness for 6 months.\nIn Patient 1, serum samples began to be\nobtained after nearly 1 month of treatment.\nIn Patient 2, the first serum sample was\nobtained before treatment. We observed two\npeaks in the serum MIF concentration during\ntreatment when the CK levels were descend-\ning, and the levels decreased when the CK\nlevels normalized (Figures 3 and 4).\nDiscussion\nMIF acts as both a potent cytokine and a\nhormone-like molecule. Many researchers\nhave found that MIF can induce TNF-a\nin monocytes, IL-6 and IL-12 in peritoneal\nmacrophages, and IL-6 and IL-8 in synovial\nfound no induction of TNF-a, IL-6, or\nIL-12 release by synovial fibroblasts or\nmacrophages using very highly purified\nMIF. MIF can be produced by many cell\ntypes, mainly by activated T cells and\nIL-6(pg/ml)\nMIF(ng/ml)\nFigure 2.

Clinical course of Patient 1.\nMIF, macrophage migration inhibitory factor; CK, creatine kinase.\nregeneration of inflammatory disorders of\nskeletal muscle, while the random migra-\ntion of macrophages can be inhibited by\nMIF. Few studies have focused on MIF in\nrelation to skeletal muscle. In the present\nstudy, we found that the MIF concentra-\ntion was higher in patients with active\nPM. However, there were no significant dif-\nferences between patients in remission and\nhealthy controls. Reimann et al.6 also found\nthat the MIF concentrations in protein\nlysates were higher than in controls. This\nmay suggest that MIF plays a role in\npatients with active PM.\nThe serum IL-6 level may be a sensitive\nbiomarker of disease activity in dermato-\nmyositis16,17 and is reportedly an important\nproinflammatory cytokine in the inflamma-\ntory process of PM. Therefore, we evaluat-\ned the serum IL-6 concentration in the\npresent study. Although IL-6 and MIF are\nboth inflammatory factors, we unexpectedly\nobserved that the serum IL-6 concentration\nwas negatively correlated with the serum\nMIF concentration in patients with PM.\nA previous study showed that MIF was\ndetected not only in inflammatory cells\nbut also in muscle fiber membranes, sug-\ngesting that MIF is also involved in the\nresponse to muscle fiber damage.6\nWhether a balance in MIF exists between\ninflammation and regeneration in patients\nwith PM requires further research. In an\nin vitro experiment, glucocorticoids affect-\ned MIF production in a bimodal way: low\nconcentrations of glucocorticoids induced\nMIF production, and high concentrations\nof glucocorticoids inhibited MIF produc-\ntion.9 Another in vivo study showed that\nMIF could be up-regulated by endogenous\nglucocorticoids in rats with adjuvant-\ninduced arthritis.18 In humans, the serum\nMIF concentration is influenced by exoge-\nnous glucocorticoids even after adjusting\nfor disease activity variables.19 We found\nno significant differences in the serum\nMIF concentration between patients with\nactive PM who were and were not receiving\nglucocorticoid therapy as well as no rela-\ntionship between the serum MIF concentra-\ntion and glucocorticoid dose. Exogenous\nglucocorticoids are not the main factor\nimpacting the MIF concentration in\npatients with active PM. Consequently,\nunlike IL-6 as a proinflammatory factor,\nMIF may play another role in PM.\nWe also followed up two patients during\ntheir treatment. In these patients, glucocor-\nticoids were given at 1 mg/kg/d, and\nthe dose was not changed until the CK\nlevel had normalized to exclude the effects\nof the glucocorticoids. While the CK level\nwas descending, we observed two peaks\nin the MIF concentration. MIF, which\nhas anti-apoptotic, pro-proliferative, and\nmacrophage-attracting functions,4 may\nhave another effect in the regeneration\nafter muscle injury. MIF was detected at\nmuscle fiber membranes, at the borders of\ninfiltrates, or in necrotic fibers in the skele-\ntal muscle of patients with PM. Focal sar-\ncoplasmic reactivity was also observed,\nespecially in fibers showing sarcolemmal\nMIF immunoreactivity.6 The MIF concen-\ntration decreased when the CK level nor-\nmalized. These data suggest that MIF\nplays a role not only in the inflammatory\nprocess of PM but also in the early stage\nof the regeneration response. Further stud-\nies involving more patients should be per-\nformed to confirm this result.\nIn conclusion, MIF and IL-6 play impor-\ntant roles in the inflammation associated\nwith PM. MIF acts as a potent and pleio-\ntropic cytokine and may also be involved in\nthe early stage of regeneration in PM. MIF\nmay be a biomarker of disease activity and\noutcome.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial, or\nnot-for-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
