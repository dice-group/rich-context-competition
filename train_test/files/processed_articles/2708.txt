Introduction\nDespite decades of policy initiatives, race continues to account for disparities in income, unemployment,\nwages, and wealth in the United States [1\u00ad3]. The persistence of racial inequalities over the past four\ncenturies presents a considerable dilemma for both scholars and non-scholars [4]. Specifically, how do\nAmericans explain persistent economic gaps between Blacks and Whites in the United States?\nUncovering the factors that affect Americans' understanding of socioeconomic disparities between\nBlacks and Whites in the United States is important because prior studies have demonstrated strong\nlinks between racial attitudes and support for racial race-based policies as well as government\nspending on social policies among states [5\u00ad7].\nOver the past five decades, a number of studies have sought to uncover the factors that shape\nAmericans' beliefs about race-related issues [8]. Given that many Americans view racial inequality as\na moral issue, a growing body of literature in this area focuses on the role of religion in shaping Americans'\nattitudes toward racial inequalities [9]. Prior research has uncovered statistically significant associations\nbetween religion (e.g., religious affiliation, religious service attendance, fundamentalist religious\nbeliefs) and racial attitudes [10\u00ad12]. Nevertheless, researchers have yet to investigate the possible\nassociation between congregational size and racial attitudes. This neglect is curious, given ongoing\nattention to the roles of religious institutions in shaping racial attitudes. This neglect also occurs\ndespite evidence that an increasing percentage of Americans are attending religious services in larger\nThe present study adds to literature on religion and racial attitudes by investigating links between\ncongregational size and beliefs about the Black/White socioeconomic gap among church attendees in\nthe United States. Though we are not the first to examine links between religion and outcomes related\nto racial inequality, there are key differences between the current study and prior works on this issue.\nFirst, to date, our understanding of religious differences and racial attitudes among Americans has\ncome mainly from case studies and/or individual-level survey data. As a result, we lack systematic\ninformation about whether and/or how structural features of religious congregations may shape racial\nattitudes. In order to overcome the limitations of individual level data, we took advantage of a unique\ndataset--the National Congregations Study (NCS) linked with individual responses from the General\nSocial Survey (GSS)--to investigate the association of religion and racial attitudes. Second, rather than\nfocus on associations between religion and racial attitudes within one religious group, our study\nexamines if the relationship between congregational size and racial attitudes is independent of other\nknown individual and congregational correlates. This study proceeds as follows. We provide a brief\nreview of the current literature relevant to this study and lay out our hypotheses. The remainder of our\npaper shows and discusses the estimated association between congregational size and beliefs about\nracial inequality among religious adherents in the United States using an analysis of the GSS and\nthe NCS.\n2. Background\nThe relationship between religion and racial attitudes continues to garner attention from researchers\nin the sciences and humanities as well as from the popular media. Most studies in this area have focused\non the relationship between religious denominations and beliefs about racial inequality [15,16]. For\ninstance, in a well-cited work, Emerson and colleagues [17] showed that denominational affiliation\naccounts for variations in racial attitudes. In comparison to non-evangelical Whites, evangelical\nWhites were more likely to deny that racial discrimination and a lack of educational opportunities\nundergird Black/White disparities in socioeconomics. Emerson and colleagues also found that White\nevangelicals were more likely than non-evangelical Whites to attribute Black/White socioeconomic\ndisparities to blacks' lack of perceived motivation. Other studies in this area also highlight the role of\nother institutional characteristics in accounting for variations in racial attitudes among religious\nadherents in the United States. For example, prior studies have found that the size of an organization's\nracial minority population accounts for variations in racial attitudes, while other studies have shown\nthe importance of other institutional characteristics such as the ability of congregations to serve as\n3. Congregational Size as a Predictor of Anti-Structural and Individualist Understandings of\nRacial Inequality\nThough we know of no work that directly explores the association between congregational size and\nracial attitudes, there are several reasons to expect that congregational size is a statistically significant\npredictor of racial attitudes in the United States. Sociologists have long suggested that larger organizations\nrequire increased differentiation and bureaucratization. For instance, Simmel [21] argued that smaller\norganizations were more effective at maintaining a high degree of social solidarity, shared beliefs, and\negalitarian dialogue among individuals. Other studies have demonstrated that (a) affiliation with larger\norganizations requires the reinforcement of certain practices to maintain administrative and communicative\nefficiency and (b) increasing organizational size creates differentiation at decelerating rates, which in\nturn, leads to bureaucracy, separation, and un-involvement [22,23]. Consistent with the claim that\nlarger organizations are associated with decreases in social solidarity, beliefs, and egalitarianism, some\nsociologists of religion [24] have argued that adherents in larger congregations are more prone to\n\"free-riding\". Free-riding is a condition in which individuals may benefit from a collective goods\nproduced by organizations they did little to help produce [25]. A free-rider in congregation is the\nindividual who attends the potluck dinner without bring a meal. In large congregations, aggregate\nlevels of participation are reduced by the presence of free-riders [26,27]. Taken together, these studies\nsuggest that larger congregations are less effective at maintaining social solidarity and shared beliefs.\nFor a congregation to change the racial attitudes of an individual, it must be a salient environment for\nan individual. Tight social bonds are a defining feature of strong congregations [24,26]. The absence of\nthese bonds renders a congregation less likely to change prevailing views and values. Large congregations,\nespecially very large congregations, may suffer this fate. They may attract thousands to weekly\nservices without ever helping most of those gathered become more than a crowd of strangers. Since\nsocial isolation and anti-egalitarian attitudes have been shown to increase support for anti-structural and\nindividualist explanations of racial inequality [28], we hypothesize the following:\nHypothesis One: Individuals who attend religious services in larger congregations will exhibit\nsupport for anti-structural and individualist understandings of racial inequality.\n4. Congregational Size as a Predictor of Structural and Anti-Individualist Understandings of\nRacial Inequality\nAn alternative perspective is that attending religious services in larger congregations is\nassociated with stronger levels of support for structural rather than individualist attitudes toward racial\ninequality [29\u00ad32]. Specifically, the \"size as an asset\" view of the relationship between congregational\nsize and individual level beliefs/attitudes contends that larger congregations offer higher quality\nresources that meet the specialized needs of congregations. Several supporting reasons appear. First,\nStonebraker [33] found that \"a denomination comprised of large congregations will produce more total\nministry than a similar-sized denomination comprised of smaller congregations\". Second, these\nspecialized ministries or small groups make the religious experiences within a larger organizational\nmore manageable, as small groups provide individuals with social relationships. Given this, it should\ncome to no surprise that researchers have found that small groups are associated with increasing a\nsense of congregational embeddedness s, more frequent attendance, and higher rates of involvement\namong religious affiliates [34,35]. Third, the presence of small groups, and specifically, the social\nrelationships within organized religious life have been important in breaking down racial barriers\nwithin very large congregations [36]. For instance, Edwards [37] discovered that membership within a\ncongregational small group was one important factor that led individuals to form the type of social\nrelationships needed to shape racial attitudes. Finally, researchers have drawn links between congregational\nsize and racial diversity. This interest has largely come in the wake of Scott Thumma's influential\nworks on megachurches, or Protestant congregations with at least 2000 weekly attendees [38]. In\ncontrast to the popular belief that very large Protestant congregations are overwhelmingly comprised\nof individuals from similar racial or ethnic backgrounds, Thumma found that fifty-five percent of\nmegachurches made intentional efforts to become diverse in 2005. At the same time, a little more than\nthirty percent of all megachurches identified as a multiracial congregation, meaning that no one racial\ngroup comprises more than 80 percent of membership. This is important because, as Yancey [39] and\nothers have reasoned, multiracial religious congregations seem to exhibit the ideal contact conditions\nof equal status, common goals, cooperative tasks, support from authorities, and opportunities to\ndevelop intimate relationships that result in positive racial attitudes. The voluntary nature of\ncongregations tends to attract those with similar ideologies and statuses. Members have incentive to\nwork together for religious or congregational goals through involvement in small groups, Bible classes,\nworkshops and other ministry activities, all of which provide opportunities for friendship formation.\nFriendships across racial groups can help challenge individualist ideas about racial/ethnic differences\nand highlight structural factors that perpetuate inequality in society. In this sense, larger congregations\nmay be associated with stronger support for structural and anti-individualist racial attitudes.\nHypothesis Two: Individuals who attend religious services in larger congregations will exhibit\nsupport for structural and anti-individualist understandings of racial inequality.\n5. Data and Methods\nData for these analyses are drawn from two sources: the GSS and the NCS. We use individual-level\ndata from the 1998 and 2006 GSS, nationally representative cross-sectional survey of U.S. adults\nconducted by the National Opinion Research Center. Since 1994 the GSS has sampled roughly\nyears the survey included two extensive special modules of items on religion and spirituality. These\nindividual-level GSS data are combined with data from the 1998 and 2006 NCS, a survey of a\nnationally representative sample of religious congregations in the United States. The 1998 and 2006\nGSS included a set of items asking respondents who say they attend religious services at least once or\ntwice a year to report the name and location of their religious congregation [40]. This procedure\ngenerated a nationally representative sample of American congregations. Because each NCS\ncongregation was nominated by at least one GSS respondent who attended that congregation,\ncongregation-level data gathered by the NCS can be linked to individual-level data collected from the\nGSS respondent who attends that congregation. This linkage enables us to examine the effects of\ncongregational characteristics on individuals. The response rates for the NCS were 80 percent in 1998\n2006. The GSS/NCS data are ideal for the goal of our study, which is to test claims regarding general\nassociations between congregational size (as reported by clergy or other church personnel) and racial\nattitudes (as reported by members). Since the GSS/NCS does not draw on samples of multiple\nindividuals within congregations, it is not surprising that 85 percent of our respondents are the only\nperson in the sample from their congregation. Multi-level modeling with data that contain small\nsample sizes at different levels of analysis tends to bias results. Therefore, we did not use multilevel\nmodeling in this study.\n5.1. Dependent Variables\nOur dependent variables are based on the following questions within the GSS: On the average,\nblacks have worse jobs, income, and housing than white people. Do you think these differences are:\nA. Mainly due to discrimination.\nB. Because most blacks have less in-born ability to learn.\nC. Because most blacks don't have the chance for education that it takes to rise out of poverty.\nD. Because most blacks just don't have the motivation or will power to pull themselves out of poverty.\nRespondents answered Yes or No to each statement (A through D). Following previous research,\nstructurally-oriented racial attitudes attribute economic gaps between Blacks and Whites to systemic\ndeficiencies within social structures and institutions. Therefore, respondents who adhere to structural\nexplanations are those who answered affirmatively to question A (mainly due to discrimination) and/or\nC (lack of educational opportunities). We created separate dummy variables for discrimination\n(coded 1 if yes and 0 if no) and education (coded 1 if yes and 0 if no). Individualist explanations for\nracial inequality contend that blacks' personal choices (e.g., government dependency) and/or innate\ninferiority contribute to persistent racial economic inequality. For our individualist measure, respondents\nwho selected lack of motivation (option D) as an explanation for the Black/White socioeconomic gap\nwere coded as 1, with those not selecting this explanation coded as 0. We exclude option B from our\nanalysis, since less than six percent of respondents in our survey responded yes to this question.\n5.2. Independent Variables\nThe primary independent variable in this study is congregational size. The NCS asked, \"How many\npersons--counting both adults and children--would you say regularly participate in the religious life\nof your congregation--whether or not they are officially members of your congregation?\" Because\ncongregation size is highly skewed, we used the logged number of regular participants in our\nstatistical models.\n5.3. Control Variables\nPrior studies have shown that a number of social factors are associated with racial attitudes [28].\nTherefore, included a variety of control variables to account for these factors. Our study is necessarily\nrestricted to individuals who identify with a religious congregation. We also control for Catholic\nchurches and congregations from other faiths outside Protestant and Catholic Christianity. Protestant\nchurches serve as the reference group in statistical analyses. At the individual level, we control for\nrace/ethnicity, age, education, gender, political ideology, home ownership, church attendance, and\nregion. The GSS asks respondents to identify their racial classification based on three options: Black,\nWhite, and Other Race. Following prior works [41], we recoded this variable to divide the racial\ncategories into four dummy codes: Black, White, Hispanic, and Other Race. In this case, respondents\nin the \"other race\" category are individuals who selected the GSS's \"other race\" option and do not\nclaim any Hispanic ancestry.\nTable 1 presents descriptive statistics for predictor variables in our analysis. Our measure for age\ncaptures all respondents from age 18 to 89. Education is a continuous variable that captures years of\neducation. Female is a dummy variable coded 1 if female and 0 if male. Political ideology is measured\non a 7-point scale, ranging from 1 = extremely liberal to 7 = extremely conservative. We used an\nordinal measure for church attendance that ranges from 1 = those who attended religious services once\nor twice in the past year to 5 = those who attended services more than once a week. We measure region\nusing dummy variables for Midwest, Northeast, West, and South. Since prior studies have shown that\nresiding in the South is associated with racial attitudes, South is the reference category in our statistical\nmodels. Given that we are using two years of GSS data, we dummy coded the variable for year such\nTable 1.

Statistical Procedure\nTo test the effect of congregation size, we estimated a series of logistic regression models for the\nthree dependent variables. Tables 2 and 3 report results for structural explanations of racial inequality.\nTable 4 repeats the analysis for individualist explanations. We report the logistic regression results as\nodds ratios in all tables.\nTable 2. Estimated odds ratios for Americans' support of racial discrimination as an\nexplanation for the black/white socioeconomic gap, General Social Survey/National\nVariables Odds Ratio Standard Error p-Value\n6. Results\nTable 2 presents the odds ratios predicting discrimination as a source of the Black/White socioeconomic\ngap. The logged number of regular attendees in a congregation is inversely related to the likelihood\nthat respondents affirm discrimination as an explanation for racial inequality. A one unit increase in\nthe logged number of regular attendees is associated with a 15 percent decrease in the odds of\nsupporting racial discrimination as an explanation for racial inequality. Race/ethnicity, age, gender,\npolitical ideology, and region are statistically significant predictors of racial discrimination as an\nexplanation for Black inequality. Blacks and Hispanics are more likely than Whites to hold this view,\nas are older adults, women, and respondents living in regions outside of the South. In contrast, holding\nconservative political views is associated with decreased support for this view.\nTable 3 presents odds ratios predicting whether respondents affirm the education explanation for the\nBlack/White socioeconomic gap. In this model, the logged number of regular attendees is not\nsignificantly related to support for the education option. That is to say, congregation size seems to have\nno bearing on the belief that a lack of educational opportunities is the root of racial inequality. Other\nsignificant correlates to this explanation are race/ethnicity, education, political ideology, and region.\nBlacks, more educated respondents, more politically liberal respondents, and non-southerners are more\nlikely to attribute black/white socioeconomic differences to blacks' lack of educational opportunities.\nTable 3. Estimated odds ratios for Americans' support of education as an explanation for\nthe black/white socioeconomic gap, General Social Survey/National Congregations Study\nVariables Odds Ratio Standard Error p-Value\nTable 4 presents odds ratios predicting whether respondents affirm motivation as an explanation for\nthe Black/White socioeconomic gap. The logged number of regular attendees is a statistically insignificant\npredictor of support for this view. Blacks are less likely than Whites to support this view, whereas\nHispanics and other races are actually more likely than Whites to do so. Older and more educated\nrespondents, as well as interviewees that are more politically conservative respondents also affirm\nmotivation as a reason for racial inequality. Women, more education, and residents outside the South\nare associated with a rejection of motivation to account for Black/White socioeconomic differences.\nTable 4.

Discussion\nOur primary aim in this study was to investigate the association between congregational size and\nattributions of Black impoverishment among religiously active Americans. We proposed competing\nhypotheses. Our results reveal that as congregation size increases, the odds of attributing Black/White\nsocioeconomic differences to racial discrimination decrease. That is to say, individuals who frequent\nlarger congregations exhibit less support for the structural view that racial discrimination is a source\nfor economic disparities between Blacks and Whites in the United States. There was, however, no\nassociation between congregational size and the other measure for structuralist racial attitudes (lack of\neducational opportunities) used in this study. If persons in larger congregations shy away from some\nstructural explanations for inequality, it follows that they would align themselves with more\nindividualist explanations. This expectation was not supported by our findings. The logged number of\nregular attendees had no association with the opinion that lack of motivation accounts for Black/White\nsocioeconomic differences. Hence, we find partial support for our first hypothesis. Persons in larger\ncongregations hold racial attitudes that are somewhat anti-structural but not individualist, as seen in\nour results, structural and individualist thinking about race do not exist as opposing poles on an\nideological continuum. They are independent orientations. Nevertheless, the pronounced conundrum of\nlargeness is noteworthy because more churchgoing Americans than ever before are attending larger\ncongregations. Moreover, if this trend continues, an increasing percentage of religious Americans may\nreport more anti-structural understandings of racial inequality.\n8. Conclusions\nOur findings lead us to several suggestions for future research. One recommendation is to explore\nthe possible mediators and moderators of links between congregational size and racial attitudes. For\ninstance, prior studies suggest that larger congregations may face greater difficulty than previous\nobservers have recognized in fostering perceptions of social warmth and intimacy. Members of big\ncongregations report significantly lower levels of anticipated support than members of other congregations,\nand this disparity is not offset in congregations with more vibrant and varied small groups, the\navailability of special-purpose groups to join, or opportunities for informal sociability before and after\nworship services [27]. Yet, prior studies also indicate that small groups offset some of that effect, by\nproviding individuals in larger congregations with an opportunity to foster social relationships, which\nin turn, increases feelings of social embeddedness [20,42]. Since social embeddedness and has been\nshown to shape racial attitudes, some of the association between congregational size and racial\nattitudes may be explained by the presence of small groups within a congregation. Additional research\nis necessary to test if and how congregational small groups moderate racial understandings. In\naddition, future studies to examine the race/ethnicity of respondents and the racial/ethnic composition\nof congregations as moderating influences on the relationships between congregation size and racial\nattitudes. Larger congregations are often more racially diverse than smaller congregations [43].\nMarti's [20] ethnographic research on multiracial congregations suggests that, within these diverse\nreligious contexts, ethnic identities can be transcended (or at least minimized) in order to unite\ncongregants around a shared religious identity. In addition to Marti, other scholars [9] have identified\nthat positive interracial relationships within multiracial congregations helped to alleviate racial\ntensions and promote more progressive attitudes toward racial issues, particularly among Whites.\nFinally, we propose a continued examination of ethnic/racial interaction within congregations that\nhave more than 2000 average weekly attendees (megachurches). The absence of strong in-group bonds\nmay be at work to preserve anti-structural attitudes toward racial inequality in these settings. So while\nefforts to diversify in very large congregations show evidence of the kind of institutional support and\ncommon goal-making conducive to reducing racial prejudice [44\u00ad47], it is possible that the main\ningredient, contact among individuals across racial lines, is lacking [48]. Given the growing number of\nindividuals in very large congregations, it is important to consider the potential of these religious\nsettings for altering attitudes toward structural racism. Based on our findings, when it comes to race\nrelations, bigger (congregations) may not be better. In fact, in a supposedly post-racial era, the specter\nof prejudice persists among larger crowds of the faithful.\nAuthor Contributions\nRyon Cobb designed the study and conducted statistical analysis.
