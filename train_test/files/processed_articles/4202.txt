Universities\nin Ghana have become attractive to students from other\ncountries, particularly in SSA. Public universities in Ghana\nare internationally recognized in terms of the quality of pro-\ngrams offered, teaching, research, and knowledge transfer.\nSeveral public universities, have well-developed interna-\ntional programs and partnerships with leading institutions\nsuch as Harvard, Yale, and Princeton, giving more credibility\nto their academic programs. However, in spite of these over-\nwhelming developments, there remain inequalities in the\nHigher Education system in Ghana; access has not been\nbroadened to include all social groups. Available data sug-\ngest unequal distribution of higher education among women,\nminorities, individuals from low socioeconomic status, and\nspatial-based disparities. Using enrollment data from univer-\nsities, policy document from the Ministry of Education\n(MOE), and the National Council for Tertiary Education\n(NCTE) in Ghana, and academic research reports, the authors\nprovide descriptive and critical analyses of higher education\ndisparities in Ghana. The authors provide a brief anatomy of\nthe tertiary education in Ghana, followed by a descriptive\nexamination of the various levels of inequalities that have\npersisted in the system with particular reference to access\nand participation--disparity based on students' socioeco-\nnomic status, gender-based disparities, regions of origin, and\nthe type or location of secondary schools. The authors utilize\nthe Gini coefficient and Lorenz curve concepts to explain the\nlevels of disparity in tertiary education in Ghana.\nOverview of Higher Education in Ghana\nTertiary education in Ghana dates back to the early 1940s\nwhen Mr. Justice Asquith was appointed by the British gov-\nernment to investigate the principles that will guide the\nestablishment of universities in the Colonies in 1943 (Daniel,\n1997). Historically, the British model of education\nbequeathed to Ghana like many Sub-Saharan African (SSA)\n1West Chester University of Pennsylvania, PA, USA\n2Albany State University, GA, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nFrancis Atuahene, Department of Educational Development Services,\nWest Chester University of Pennsylvania, 222 Lawrence Center, West\nEmail: fatuahene@wcupa.edu\nA Descriptive Assessment of Higher\nEducation Access, Participation, Equity,\nand Disparity in Ghana\nFrancis Atuahene1 and Anthony Owusu-Ansah2\n Keywords\nAfrica, Ghana, higher education access, participation, disparity, equity\n2 SAGE Open\ncountries was designed to educate an elite corps who will\ngradually take up roles in the civil service played by expatri-\nates (MOE, 2008). The first Higher education institution\nestablished in Ghana was the University College of Gold\nCoast in 1948 and later renamed the University of Ghana\nthere were three public universities in Ghana (UG, the\nKwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology\n[KNUST], and the University of Cape Coast [UCC]). In\naddition, there were other professional institutions offering\npostsecondary programs in the country. Starting with a few\nthis level until the government issued a white paper in 1991\non the reforms to the Tertiary Education System, a precursor\nof the report of the University Rationalization Committee\n(URC). The URC undertook a comprehensive review of\npostsecondary education in the country and came out with\ndetailed proposals designed to overhaul the education system\n(MOE, 2008). The recommendations of the URC provided\nthe basis for innovation in higher education. The committee\nrecommended among other things, strategies to expand\naccess particularly for the poor and female students; the cre-\nation of a new University in the northern part of Ghana;\nupgrading of the existing polytechnics into tertiary education\nstatus under the Polytechnic Law (PNDC; Provisional\ntant recommendation by the URC report was the unification\nof all postsecondary educational institutions into a single,\nunified, and coordinated system with greater public account-\nability (Republic of Ghana, 2002). While the URC acknowl-\nedged that the Government cannot exclusively finance higher\neducation, the report recommended that universities embark\non innovative financial diversification approaches such as\nthe introduction of cost-sharing and cost-recovery mecha-\nnisms, while tuition remained constitutionally free. These\nmajor developments led to massive expansion of access and\nment of the three public universities was 14,500, and by\nOver the past two decades, the number of tertiary institu-\ntions in Ghana has grown positively, particularly private\nand private universities accredited by the National\nAccreditation Board (NAB) in Ghana. Of these, there are 6\npublic universities, 49 private universities--two of which are\nchartered and have been given presidential authority to\naward degrees, 38 Teacher Training Colleges (TTCs) that\nhave been upgraded to university status, 18 Nursing Training\nColleges, and 10 Polytechnics. In addition to these, there are\nseveral private universities that have not received accredita-\ntion, but running several postsecondary education programs\nin the country. In the public universities, the enrollment\ngrowth rate has not reflected the proportionate expansion in\nacademic facilities to ensure equity, and inclusion of all\nsocial groups. For example, during the period between 1990\nand 2004, the average annual growth rate reached 18% for all\ntertiary institutions combined, and 16% for universities alone\nthe total enrollment in the tertiary sector was just more than\n135,000. At the polytechnic level, enrollment increased from\n(Effah, 2011). These developments are due to various poli-\ncies adopted by the Government to enhance higher education\nin Ghana. Another example is the policy of differentiation\nbeing implemented to allow accreditation of some polytech-\nnics to run select bachelor's degree programs, thereby reduc-\ning pressure on universities to expand access and participation\n(Effah, 2011). In spite of this growth, universities and poly-\ntechnics are not fully equipped with the required infrastruc-\nture to admit the number of qualified students seeking\nparticipation. Every year, many qualified students are denied\naccess to tertiary education due to limited institutional\nfacilities.\nAccess, Participation, and Equity\nAs indicated hereinbefore, public tertiary education in Ghana\nwas initially developed as residential institutions because of\ntheir national character and the model adopted from the met-\nropolitan institutions in Britain (Republic of Ghana, 2002).\nAdmission to any of the public universities in Ghana is influ-\nenced by the availability of academic and residential facili-\nties, as well as Government subsidies to institutions. With the\ngrowing demand for participation and the unequaled pace of\nexpansion in residential facilities, access to higher education\nis determined by available capacities of universities and\npolytechnics. Although, enrollment increased from as low as\nremain greater percentage of students who are excluded from\nties increased by 57%, while polytechnics registered an\nimpressive enrollment rate of 21.4%. Presently, universities\nare filled beyond reasonable capacity, and many academi-\ncally qualified students are denied admission. The lack of\nadequate academic and residential facilities means that uni-\nversities have to embark on highly selective admission pro-\ncedures. For instance, enrollment trend at the UG provides\nan expos\u00e9 of the accessibility challenge facing public univer-\nsities in Ghana. In 2001, the total number of applications (see\nstudy in various programs (representing an acceptance rate\nof 96%, see Figure 2). However, this trend began to change\nas the number of applications increased in successive years.\nIn 2011, for example, the total number of qualified applicants\nAtuahene and Owusu-Ansah 3\n52% of the qualified applicants were admitted to study in\nvarious programs. The status of the 48% of students who\nwere denied admission remains unknown. It is possible that\nsome of the qualified students may have been accepted into\nother tertiary institutions in the country, because in practice,\nstudents usually apply to multiple institutions. As Eshiwani\n(1999) indicated, although the expansion of access to higher\neducation led to training of the required manpower capacity\nneeds of most African countries in the earlier days of inde-\npendence, \"the current growth exceeds the capacity of\nAfrican economies to meet the high demand for university\neducation\" (p. 33). However, the fact that many students are\nfaced with the challenge of accessing universities and pro-\ngrams of their choice due to limited academic facilities\nmeans that Ghana is potentially underutilizing a greater per-\ncentage of its human resource capacity.\nMoreover, in discussing access and participation issues, it\nis important to note that globally, higher education accessibil-\nity is becoming a major national concern for all countries.\nWhile enrollment has increased at the primary and secondary\neducation levels, similar trends have not been witnessed at the\npostsecondary levels. Over the past three decades, the number\nof students attending postsecondary education has increased\nfrom five to six million resulting in tertiary enrollment annual\naverage growth rate of 8.6% with SSA recording the highest\nparticipation growth rate (United Nations Educational,\nScientific and Cultural Organization Institute for Statistics\n[UNESCO-UIS], 2009). Available statistics show that in SSA,\nenrollment rose by an annual growth rate of 10% between\nremains a huge gap between the secondary and tertiary Gross\nEnrollment Ratios (GER) in the region. For example, the\npopulous country in Africa registered a primary GER of 96%,\nsecondary GER of 32%, and tertiary GER of 10%.\nAlternatively, Kenya's GER within the same period was 96%\nfor primary education, 49% for secondary, and 6% for tertiary.\nIn Ghana, the secondary Net Enrollment Ratio (NER) in 2007\nComparing these statistics with a non-African country, India,\nfor instance, registered 112% primary GER, 54% secondary\nand 12% tertiary, which was even higher than the combined\nGER of all SSAcountries of 95% primary, 32% secondary and\ninstructive that the problem of access at the university is also a\ntransition and progression issue from the pretertiary levels.\nThe primary GER of 94.9% compared with Junior and Senior\ntion problem from primary to secondary education levels,\nwhich definitely affects the transition and progression to the\nmale to female primary GER was 97% to 92.8% compared\nwith the respective GER of 83.9% and 77% at the Junior High\nSenior High School levels, respectively. Clearly, by the time\nstudents graduate from High School, a greater percentage of\nthem would have dropped out. As a point of banality, one can\ncandidly remark that if retention rates at the pretertiary educa-\ntion increases, and if many students were to qualify for univer-\nsities, the existing institutional capacities will definitely be\ninadequate for such massive demands. The worse-case sce-\nnario would be either institutions overstretch their capacities\nand accept more students, which will potentially affect quality\nor completely deny some students admission.\nStudents\nApplications Qualified Admitted Enrolled\nFigure 1.

Similarly, the World Bank (2011)\nreported that while Junior High School GER reached 79.5 in\n2009, the current estimated transition rate from Junior to\nWhile high drop-out rates at the Junior High School\naccounts for the low Senior Secondary School GER, other\nsocioeconomic and institutional factors, as well as high fail-\nure rates in the Basic Education Certificate Examination\n(BECE) play a major role in students'transition and progres-\nsion between Junior and Senior High School levels (MOE,\nBECE by the West Africa Examination Council (WAEC)\nrevealed that, most of the students who took the exam per-\nformed abysmally as compared with the previous years,\nleading to most students not being able to obtain admission\ninto the Senior High Schools. It was noted in the WAEC\nreport that most schools scored below 50% in the exam. In\ncentral region alone about 77 schools scored 0% in the exam.\nIt is important to note that while generally tertiary education\nin Ghana has relatively seen expansion in the number of stu-\ndents attending, unfortunately, not all groups have benefited\nproportionately from the recent expansion. Ensuring partici-\npation for women remains a major policy snag for universi-\nties, although there have been efforts to bridge this gap.\nGender-Based Disparity in Higher\nEducation\nGender-based disparity in education as argued by Assi\u00e9-\nLumumba (2008) \". . . is one of the areas that differentiates\neconomically advanced from developing countries\" (p. 18).\nAlthough SSAwitnessed more than 66% increase in the num-\nber of students attending tertiary education between 1999 and\n2005, access to the relevant age group remains relatively low\nWhile the global Gender Parity Index (GPI) increased to 1.05\nmen substantially increased in some countries such as the\nCongo, the Gambia, Lesotho, and Nigeria, women's partici-\npation in tertiary education improved significantly in Burkina\nFaso, Ethiopia, Malawi, and the United Republic of Tanzania\nOverall higher education access for female students has\nnot seen much improvement despite the general consensus\nabout the need to correct gender-based disparity (Figure 3).\nOne often-cited reason for the low participation rate of\nfemales in African universities is the misguided colonial\neducational policy, which did not have specific place for\nwomen in higher education. Historically, the colonial higher\neducation model for which Africa traces its modern universi-\nties was primarily designed to educate males who will pro-\nvide administrative assistance to the colonial government,\nthus universities did not have any voice or important place\npractice did not change during the immediate years after\nindependence as most first- and second-generation African\nleaders did not proactively make plans to improve women\nparticipation in higher education, thereby perpetuating the\nlong-standing inequity. As Mama argued,\nAfrican governments have not formally excluded women from\nparticipation in higher education as the colonial policies did, but\n\"they have tended to treat the attainment of nation-statehood as\na collective restoration of conventional masculinity . . . which\nhas precluded full and equal participation of women in the\nIn Ghana, access to and participation in higher education\nby females has generally improved numerically over the past\nfew decades, but disparity persists between male students.\nNo. of Students\nFigure 3.

The increase in enroll-\nment is high in the polytechnics, private universities, and\nprofessional institutes. For example, the percentage of enroll-\nment in private universities and professional institutes rose\nBank, 2011). Probably, the entry requirements are less com-\npetitive than those in the universities (Morley, Gunawardena,\nKwesiga, Lihamba, & Odejide, 2006; Morley, Leach, &\nLugg, 2009; Morley, Lihamba, Mwaipopo, Forde, & Egbenya,\ngap in enrollment and retention remains one of the more vex-\ning issues facing the Ghanaian education system\" (p. 12).\nGhana has evidently seen an impressive increase in its\nhigher education with Gross Enrollment Ratio increasing from\nfemale and male students have not been achieved, as the pro-\nportion of male to female student remains unequal. In 1999,\nLorenz Curve in Figure 4, for example, provides a further esti-\nmation of how Ghana is lagging in achieving gender parity or\nequality in its tertiary education system. As a measure of\nequality, the Lorenz curve maps the cumulative educational\nshare against the cumulative population share ordered from\nthe least represented in the tertiary education to the most rep-\nresented on the y- and x-axes, respectively (d'Hombres, 2010).\nThe Lorenz curve provides a geometric representation of edu-\ncational inequalities. The 45\u00b0 diagonal line differentiates the\nLorenz curve. As depicted by the Lorenz Curve in Figure 4,\nthe relationship between cumulative proportions, its initial and\nfinal points have coordinates (0, 0) and (1, 1), respectively. If\neach gender group had the same enrollment distribution, the\nLorenz Curve would be equal to the equality line. As enroll-\nment distribution between female and male students is not\nequal, the Lorenz Curve falls below the equidistribution line.\nThe surface of the area between the 45\u00b0 line, along with which\nenrollment distribution of both social groups (male and\nfemale) is the same on the Lorenz curve, determines the degree\nof inequality in the enrollment distribution and participation.\nThe bigger the surface, the more unequal the educational dis-\ntribution and however, the larger the distance of the curve\nfrom the diagonal line, the larger the inequality. From Figure\n4, it is evidenced that educational inequalities exist between\nmale and female students with access favoring male students\nwho are closer to the equidistribution line.\nVarious systemic factors have been cited to explain gen-\nder-based inequities in higher education in Ghana. Ironically,\nsome of the factors that were discussed over a decade ago in\na study by Daddieh (2003) were observed in recent studies\nfactors causing the high rate of gender-disparity are Socio-\ncultural considerations, gendered social practices within\nhouseholds, financial difficulties associated with women edu-\ncation, lack of role models for girls in schools, and hostile\nschool environment, which has been documented as sexual\nharassments from male students, inadequate institutional\nfacilities, and so on. Socioeconomically, poor parents tend to\nsacrifice their girls' education in favor of males when they\nhave to make the financial decision to send only one child to\nschool. Culturally, in most rural areas when family budget is\ntight, there is the entrenched perception of parents sacrificing\ntheir daughters' education and request of them to participate\nin economic activities to supplement household income. Girls\nare more likely than males to support their family either by\nengaging in selling goods and services or babysitting their\nyounger siblings especially in the rural areas. As articulated\nby Daddieh, \". . . negative parental attitudes and cultural prac-\ntices have tended to devalue female educational achieve-\nments, and thereby undermine their educational participation\"\nabout the value of women's education is gradually fading\naway in the Ghanaian society, some culturally endemic areas\ncontinue to perpetuate binary gender roles which have\nreduced women to household chores--a notion perceived tra-\nditionally, as the proper role and place of women in society.\nMoreover, the high female drop-out rate at the primary\nand secondary education levels can generally be attributed to\nfactors which include: financial stress and Socio-cultural\nconstraints--early customary marriages, teenage pregnancy;\nunfavorable school environment such as poor sanitary facili-\nties (e.g., toilets), lack of female role models, parents' level\nof education, high incidence of poverty in the family cause\nearly labor entrance by children, and so on (Casely-Hayford,\nabaselinestudy,CampaignforFemaleEducation(CAMFED;\nCumulave % of Enrollment\nLorenz Curve of gender-based educational inequality\nEquality Line Male Female\nFigure 4.

A study by Morley et al. (2007) found that female\nstudents drop out from primary school because some face\nunbridled sexually aggressive gestures from male students. A\nsimilar report by the World Bank (2011) accounted that pri-\nmary school dropouts are predominantly high for girls espe-\ncially those from disproportionately rural settings and poorer\nhouseholds. Moreover, girls in deprived and nondeprived\ndistricts more consistently drop out of Junior High Schools\nthan boys. Academically, a comparison of male and female\nAfrica Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE)\nshow that in all subjects taken at the Senior High School\nentrance examinations, male students outperformed their\nfemale counterparts. As admission to the higher education\ninstitution depends on students' success in the WASSCE, it\ncomes as no surprise that male students have a better chance\nat success to enter the university.\nAnother important factor that impacts students' participa-\ntion in higher education is their families' socioeconomic\nbackground. Historically, postcolonial African leaders per-\nceived the development of tertiary-level skills as essential to\nupward mobility in the labor force and a measure of social\nand economic progression (Assi\u00e9-Lumumba, 2008). Socially,\nparents' educational backgrounds largely determine their\neconomic and financial sustainability and their ability to\npositively contribute toward their children's education.\nParticularly, a mother's level of education impacts her chil-\ndren's attendance and performance in school (UNESCO,\n2011). However, most often financial hardship militates\nagainst women's ability to pursue higher education, thereby\naffecting their contributions to their children's education.\nInstead of being in school, children in the rural areas in par-\nticular are made to work to support family income. In the\nextreme cases, girls from low socioeconomic backgrounds\neither get married too early or some of them become victims\nof sexual abuse, which could potentially lead to teenage\npregnancy either caused by male peers or teachers. As\nthe poverty of households often makes girls vulnerable to the\nadvances of so-called \"sugar daddies\" and even male teachers.\nThe resultant pregnancies exacerbated the rate of female\ndropouts, because girls are almost invariably expelled from\nschool, but not the real culprits--the boys who got them pregnant\nin the first place. (p. 26)\nHowever, Governments continue to press for the need to\nincrease graduate output of female students. Various policies\nhave been put in place at all levels of education to correct the\nhistorical and systemic marginalization of women. At the\nbasic education level, for example, the Girl-Child Unit of the\nGhana Education Service (GES) has been created to develop\nand maintain strategies aimed at increasing the retention rate\nof girls in Junior High Schools and ensuring their continua-\ntion at the Senior High School. While the Unit has made\nremarkable progress over the years, it faces several problems\nsuch as inadequate funding by the GES in some districts to\nfully support all their programs, lack of operation, and moni-\ntoring vehicle for easy accessibility to remote districts, lack\nof motivation for hardworking coordinators in assisting\ndeprived areas in the district, and difficulty in mobilizing\nstakeholders to improve the quality of teaching and learning\nfor girls. Although, gender-based disparity remains an issue\nof policy concern, spatially, individuals from economically\ndeprived regions face more challenges in accessing higher\neducation than those in economically advantaged urban areas\nparticularly, in the cities. The following discussion focuses\non how region of residence/origin affects students' chances\nof participating in higher education.\nSpatial Disparity and Higher Education\nAccess\nWhile gender-based disparity remains an entrenched prob-\nlem in higher education in Ghana, spatial or geographical\ninequality is very profound.

Participation in higher education\ndepends on the location and quality of Senior High School\nattended, which is also a proxy to measure ones performance\nin the Senior Secondary School Examinations (SSSCE).\nPerformance in SSSCE/WASSCE depends on the geographi-\ncal location or region of the high school, academic program,\nand of course the quality of teachers in the school. Students\nwho have the opportunity to attend one of the top-ranked\nSecondary Schools, staffed with quality teachers and com-\nparatively better educational facilities tend to perform better\nthan their peers who attended mediocre Senior High School,\npredominantly located in rural areas in historically disadvan-\ntaged regions of the country, which have substandard aca-\ndemic infrastructure or facilities. Apparently, most of the\nbest schools are located in the urban areas. Studies have\nshown that students who attended the top-ranked Senior\nHigh Schools dominate public universities. A study by\nfuture doctors, scientists, engineers, architects, pharmacists,\nand other professionals graduating from tertiary institutions\nin Ghana came from only 18 of the country's 504 Senior\nSecondary Schools. This is because only few schools are\nwell equipped with the facilities and quality teachers required\nto implement rigorous science intensive programs.\nUnfortunately, the best science schools are well-resourced\nand predominantly located in the urban areas.\nIn a similar study, Manuh, Sulley, and Budu (2007) argued\nthat \"the most significant factor enhancing the chances of\naccess to university in Ghana was the region (and indeed,\nlocation) of residence\" (p. 82). About 70% of students in the\nfive public universities reside in only three regions, namely,\nthe Greater Accra (GAR; that is, capital), Ashanti (ASH),\nand Eastern Regions (ER), suggesting that students from\nthese regions have the best chance at gaining entry into the\nuniversity (Manuh et al., 2007). Manuh et al. study found\nenrollment variations in five of the nation's publicly funded\nuniversities and that 50% of students had come from only 29\nsecondary schools in the country. Available Institutional data\nat the UG and Kwame Nkrumah university indicate that\nenrollment in these institutions are dominated by students\nfrom about 50 of the more than 500 Senior Secondary\nSchools, with the majority of them from schools located in\neconomically advantaged regions of the country. A recent\nqualified students in Ghana were from deprived parts of the\ncountry. Approximately 5% selected from this group was\ncompared with 15% from nondeprived schools. Only 1.16%\nof students selected were from deprived schools compared\nwith 11.59% from nondeprived schools. The odds of being\nadmitted to any of the tertiary educational institution in\nstudents who had the opportunity to attend schools located in\nnondeprived regions.\nIn expanding the analysis on the magnitude of higher edu-\ncation inequities based on individuals region of residence in\nGhana, the Gini educational coefficient was employed using\nthe Gini Coefficient formula by Brown (1994):\nGini = - +\n( ) -\n( )\n=\n-\n+ +\ni\nk\ni i i i\n ,\nwhere Gini = Gini coefficient, X\ni\n= Cumulative proportion of\nthe regions, and Yi = Cumulative proportion of students\nenrolled in universities.\nAs a measure of inequality, the Gini coefficient is based\non the graphical representation of the Lorenz curve of the\ndistribution of education by regions. The coefficient varies\nbetween 0, which reflects complete equality and 1, which\nindicates complete inequality. Increasing values of the Gini\nrepresents level of educational inequality among regions.\nThe overall regional-analysis shows notable inequalities in\nthe distribution of higher education in Ghana. The Lorenz\ncurves in Figures 7a and 7b show a comparison of the trend\nof educational disparity of the ten geographic regions in\nties--KNUST, the UCC, and the UG. The Lorenz curves\nshow that tertiary education in Ghana is distributed in favor\nof the top 5 regions--ASH, CR, ER, GAR, and Volta (VR).\nThe educational Gini coefficient in Figure 8 shows wide\nvariations in the distribution of tertiary education by regions\nin Ghana. Statistically, the probability of getting access to\nhigher education is higher for individuals residing in ASH\n86% and 81% of the students, respectively, enrolled in the\nthree public universities named the top-five regions as their\nplaces of origin.\nFigure 7a. Lorenz curve of educational inequality--Top 5\nregions.\nNote.

Students who do not meet the universities'\ncompetitive admission cutoff points and departmental\nrestrictive requirements, but who meet the minimum entry\nrequirements have the option to apply for admission as\ntuition paying. Students who meet the competitive require-\nments are admitted on regular status. Regular students do not\npay tuition, but they pay Academic User Facility and\nResidential User Facility fees, and other institutional imposed\ncharges. Economically, one must have the financial support\nto either apply or continue as \"tuition-paying\" student.\nIntuitively, the ability to pay depends on several factors such\nas socioeconomic status, which also depends on student's\nfamily income background, level of parents' education, and\nof course the location and region of residence. The data\nreveal that in both admission streams, students who are able\nto participate in higher education are those from the five top\nregions identified hereinbefore. By all measures, access to\nhigher education comes into conflict with one's socioeco-\nnomic status and ability to pay.\nWhen compared, Figures 9 and 10 show that the majority\nof students who were attending the UG as regular and tuition\nof the country. Most important of all, the fact that participa-\ntion in universities is disproportionally distributed in favor of\nthe economically viable regions for regular and fee-paying\nstudents shows persistent inequity.

There is no other\nfactor that militates against students' access to tertiary edu-\ncation than their socioeconomic background, ceteris pari-\nbus. Constitutionally, pretertiary education in Ghana is\ntuition free, nonetheless there remain certain incidental\nfees that work against students from poor socioeconomic\nbackgrounds especially, those in the rural areas and in par-\nticular girls. Thus, the socioeconomic status of parents is a\ncrucial factor in deciding whether a student stays in pri-\nmary school or progresses to the next higher level of\nschool, and the opportunity to attend university. However,\nat the primary levels, there have been several policy initia-\ntives such as the school Capitation Grant Scheme intro-\nduced in 2005 to eliminate school fees to expand access for\npoor students. In principle, the Capitation Grant is designed\nto eliminate indiscriminate charges such as fees at the\nbasic educational level, especially for the poor and those in\nthe rural settings who research had shown were not access-\ning education because of the costs, and enable schools to\nutilize the available funds to improve the quality of educa-\ntion (Akyeampong, 2011). These programs contributed to\nincrease in enrollment at the primary school for girls. The\nelimination of fees also benefited the poor in remote areas.\nNevertheless, as Akyeampong (2011) indicated, the\nCapitation Grant Scheme instituted in Ghana is a one-time\nshot approach because, at some point the enrollment\ngrowth rate reaches a norm, and in some cases it begins to\nplateau. Moreover, providing the facilities at the primary\nschool level without a concomitant overhaul of facilities at\nthe upper educational levels is a short-sighted policy goal.\nSimilarly, eliminating school fees as a demand-side strat-\negy to increase enrollment at the primary school level does\nnot in itself lead to high attendance and participation rates\n(Akyeampong, 2011). Thus, although fee-free policies\nhave been employed in many developing countries to\nimprove educational access to the poor and minority stu-\ndents, the results have not necessarily translated into high\nattendance and completion of schooling (Akyeampong,\nAnother dimension to this problem is that while higher\neducation in Ghana remains tuition free for regular students,\nthere exist several charges such as, registration fee, technol-\nogy fee, examination fee, academic facility user fee, medical\nservices fee, venture capital fee, and so on that make it very\nexpensive for individuals from low socioeconomic status to\nafford the cost of participation. Realistically, government\nalone cannot afford to finance higher education considering\nthe skyrocketing enrollment rates coupled with the increas-\ning per-unit cost of financing tertiary education. Likewise,\nthe present state of the Ghanaian economy means a greater\npercentage of students are incapable of financing their edu-\ncation without government's subsidies.\nA plethora of studies (Bock & Cammish, 1997; Casely-\neconomic status affect their ability to access and participate\nin all levels of education particularly, at the tertiary education\nlevel. For most 4-year colleges and universities, especially\nselective institutions, enrollment is contingent on students'\nacademic preparation at the elementary and secondary school\nlevels. Across the world, students from low socioeconomic\nstatus find it difficult to enroll in selective institutions and for\nthose who made it through are usually academically ill-pre-\npared, although they perform competitively as their peers\nfrom high-ranked secondary schools (Kirst, 2007).\nIndividual's economic background can either serve as a bar-\nrier or incentive to apply to college or university because of\nthe cost involve in attending specific schools. However,\nTierney (1980) argued that socioeconomic status by itself\nmay not affect the cost of applying to specific institution for\nminority students, but practically, students from low-income\nstatus may be hesitant to apply to specific selective and elite\ninstitutions even though they may be academically capable\nIn the United States, Bowen, Kurzweil, and Tobin (2005)\nasserted that low-income students are less likely to apply to\none of the group of 31 selective colleges or universities that\nfall under the Consortium on Financing Higher Education\n(COFHE). A similar argument was made by McPherson and\nSchapiro (1991) that students from low socioeconomic back-\ngrounds are less likely to be admitted to COFHE and are\nmore averse to be accepted. Berg (2010) indicated, \"statisti-\ncally, the least academically qualified students from wealthy\nfamilies have as much chance of going to college as the high-\nest performing kids from low-income families\" (p. 55). For\neconomically disadvantaged students, the opportunity cost\nof participating in higher education is a major economic\ndecision.\nFor many low-income Ghanaian students, the decision to\ntake loans for private university or apply as \"full fee-paying\"\nif they do not meet the competitive entry requirements set by\npublic universities is a difficult one. Hence, there are aca-\ndemically competent students who for economic reasons\nchose different paths to higher education. For example, in the\npast some students chose TTCs for economic reasons.\nPractically, there is a major incentive to attend TTC in Ghana\nbecause, not only are TTCs tuition free, but also students\nreceive stipend from the government. In addition, TTC stu-\ndents get employed immediately after they graduate from\ncollege. This is because the Government sends them to vari-\nous schools throughout the country as teachers. As observed\nThe subject area of Education attracted the most students from\ndeprived backgrounds . . . While this is an important pathway, it\nis also a profession in Africa with a low exchange rate in the\nlabor market, thus reinforcing economic hierarchies. (p. 21)\nEven though socioeconomic status is the first barrier to\nhigher education access for most poor students, admission\nselectivity to public universities remains the second major\nthreat to participation. For instance, qualified students who\ndid not meet the university's competitive cutoff point, but are\nfinancially capable can apply as tuition paying to participate\nin university education or even apply to one of the private\ninstitutions. However, qualified students who do not meet\nthe competitive admission cutoff point, but are financially\nincapable dread losing the opportunity to participate in\nhigher education. The existing competitive entry require-\nments into universities based on achievement in WASSCE is\na major stumbling block for students from lower socioeco-\nnomic backgrounds.\nAvailable fee structure for the 1st-year regular students\nGhanaian-tuition-paying status, their tuition and fees is in the\nUG), Ghanaian tuition-paying students pay GH\u00a2 2,003\nstudents in various applied sciences. There are variations in\ntuition and fee within different programs in the same institu-\ntion and among public universities. In addition to the pub-\nlished fees, students are required to pay other incidentals fees\nsuch as residential facilities user fee, and hall dues.\nNonresidential students also incur other expenses for accom-\nmodation, textbooks, transportation, food, personal, and mis-\ncellaneous expenditures. For the average Ghanaian, and\nlow-income students, paying for the yearly fees in addition\nto all the other incidental expenditures is an uphill struggle.\nHigher Education in Ghana is disproportionately \"consumed\"\nby the richest 20% of the population. Male students from the\nhighest income quintile (Q5) are more than seven times more\nlikely to enter and successfully complete HE than those from the\npoorest quintile (Q1). The situation is even more precarious for\nthe female category where students come from only the richest\nHowever, instead of providing support for students from\nlow socioeconomic status, universities and government pol-\nicy penalize students for not performing well in high school,\nby rewarding the \"brightest\" students who had access to the\nbest secondary schools in the country, thereby perpetuating\ninequality. Pillay (2009) contended that students from the\nhighest income quintiles dominate universities and \"often\npublic funding mechanisms act to exacerbate such inequities\nby providing free higher education to the `best' students who\ninvariably come from the wealthiest households.\" The case\nof Ghana clearly mirrors this point where students who did\nnot meet the competitive admissions \"cutoff points\" are\nadmitted to pay tuition; meanwhile the majority of these stu-\ndents are from either high schools with substandard facilities\nor from poor socioeconomic background. Students from\npoorer income quintiles\nhave much lower enrollment and completion rates. Students\nfrom economically deprived households have not only fewer\nchances than their rich counterparts to be enrolled in school, but\nthose that are have an even smaller probability of completing a\nProgram-Based Disparities\nAnother area of inequality in higher education in Ghana is\nthe type of academic program that a student pursues.\nGenerally, there is huge disparity between the percentage of\nstudents enrolled in the Arts- and Humanities-related pro-\ngrams and Science, Technology, Engineering and\nMathematics (STEM) fields. Available statistical data show\nthat while women participation in higher education has\nincreased considerably over the past few years, there remains\na huge gap between male and females in STEM fields. Pillay\nparticipation rates for women in SSA is \"substantially\" lower\nthan males, where women have managed to enter higher\neducation, their participation is often concentrated in so-called\ntraditional women's disciplines such as humanities and\neducation, rather than in commerce, engineering, and science.\nIn Ghana, while government policy suggests a 60:40\nenrollment goal for programs in Science & Technology and\nArts & Humanities, respectively (Ministry of Education,\nScience, and Sport [MOESS], 2010), enrollment trends over\nthe past few decades indicate that this policy goal is far from\nbeing realized. For example, STEM and Arts and Humanities\nfor STEM, and Arts and humanities, respectively (MOESS,\nrespectively, in favor of Arts/Humanities (NCTE, 2012). At\nAtuahene and Owusu-Ansah 11\nthe UG, the percentage of students enrolled in science-related\n17.3%. In view of this, the NCTE recommends pegging the\nSTEM and Arts/Humanities growth at 5% and 3%, respec-\nreverse the present trend. However, a study by Somuah (2008)\ncited in the 2010 Education Sector Performance Report indi-\ncated that if Ghana wants to increase STEM education within\n12 years, universities may have to peg their enrollment growth\nto 8% for science-related disciplines and 0% for the Arts/\nHumanities. Similarly, polytechnics have to increase science\nenrollment by 6% and Arts/Humanities by 1% (MOESS,\n2010). By making such proposition, the Government assumes\nthat student interest in pursuing Arts or Humanities may\ndecline in favor of STEM courses. However, the implementa-\ntion of such policy prescription can potentially derail indi-\nvidual's career focus as well as creating fertile grounds for\ndiscriminatory admission practices that favor students in the\nsciences. As shown in the Figure 11, the number of students\nenrolled has generally increased but those in the sciences\nincreased by small margin. It is equally important to point out\nthat the KNUST and University of Mines and Technology\n(UMAT) are science-based institutions, although KNUST has\nover the years expanded the number of Arts and Humanities\nprograms offered.\nAt the UCC, the ratio of STEM and Arts & Humanities\njected rate of 60:40. Also, when broken down by gender, the\nratio of male to female was 63:37 in Arts and Humanities and\n78:22 in the STEM. Even though women usually dominate\nin the Arts and Humanities fields, the data show that male\nstudents outnumbered females in all broad fields of academic\nprograms in universities in Ghana.\nHowever, the low numbers of students in STEM is not\nbecause of lack of students' interest in science-related\ndisciplines, but universities do not have adequate physical\ninfrastructure--lack of science laboratories and workshops;\ninadequate human capacity--research faculty, technicians;\nlack of enforcement of Science and Technology enrollment\ntargets by tertiary educational institutions. At the pretertiary\neducation level (Senior High School) only a limited number\nof schools offer rigorous General Science education because\nmost of the schools do not have the resources to facilitate sci-\nence and math education. As Effah (2011) posited, \"there are\nan insufficient number of science schools and where they do\nexist, particularly in the rural areas, they do not have required\nlaboratories to facilitate the teaching of science and mathe-\nmatics\" (p. 377). Several factors could explain the disparity in\nthe Arts & Humanities, and STEM fields. Among the notable\nones are (a) lack of academic instructors in science- and tech-\nnology-related fields at the Senior High School level, (b) lack\nof science and laboratory equipment at the lower educational\nlevels, (c) low level of morale and motivation especially for\nwomen to pursue STEM disciplines at the secondary school\nlevel, (d) lack of financial support for institutions to run\nhighly intensive science laboratories, and so on (MOESS,\n2010). There is also limited number of well-trained science\nand mathematics teachers at the postgraduate level to teach at\nthe second cycle institutions. This is even worse at the poly-\ntechnics and private universities. Private universities tend to\ngravitate toward offering programs in the Arts, Humanities,\nand Social Sciences than Physical Sciences. In view of the\nfact that private universities are quite, recent development\nand considering that the operation of a highly intensive sci-\nence program is logistically and financially expensive, it will\nbe more pragmatic for these new institutions to focus on pro-\ngrams that do not require expensive equipment needed to run\nand maintain quality STEM programs. However, the immedi-\nate consequence of this is that, universities and polytechnics\nare not producing enough graduates with the skills needed to\nEnrollment Trend by Academic Programs\nMale\nFemale\nSource. Data from National Council for Tertiary Education (2012).\nspur technological innovation and economic growth (United\nNations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD],\nIn view of the deficiency faced by many of the second\ncycle institutions, the Government established the national\nSecondary Schools throughout the country. The centers were\ncreated within a 40-km radius to bridge the gap between\nwell-resourced and underresourced schools. The goal was to\nhelp students in school who do not have science laboratories\nfor rigorous science programs to have access to the SRC\nthrough weekly visits to the centers. The advantage of this\nmodel was to create one center that will serve a greater per-\ncentage of students instead of having to establish one for\neach school, which was financially impossible. While the\ncenters have contributed to teaching and learning of science,\nmost of the centers have experienced various forms of fund-\ning and logistical challenges such as transportation for shut-\ntling students to the centers, limited number and type of\nequipment available in the centers, maintenance of equip-\nRealizing the challenges faced by some of the centers, the\nMOE in 2011 contracted with Educational Training\nEquipment (Eduteq) to upgrade facilities in 200 schools to\nenhance the SRC Projects. As at the end of 2012, the first\nphase of this project was completed with the installation of\nequipment in 83 centers, while the remaining 117 are sched-\nuled for installation in 2013. The strength of the nation's sci-\nence, technology, and innovation base depends on the quality\nof education and training in science and mathematics in basic\nand second cycle schools to produce the number of students\nwho are well prepared for courses in science, mathematics,\nengineering, and technology at the polytechnics and universi-\nties (Ministry of Environment, Science and Technology\n[MEST], 2010). Cognizance of this need, government current\npolicy projects to ensure that, 60% of all students in the public\nuniversities and 80% of those in the polytechnics and voca-\ntional institutions will enroll in science-related disciplines by\nthe year 2020. Efforts are being made to promote postgradu-\nate education in scientific disciplines targeting 10% of the\nstudent population in tertiary educational institutions enroll-\ning at the postgraduate level, and provide incentives for stu-\ndents and graduates of science and technology (MEST, 2010).\nProgram-based disparity is not only restricted to students,\nbut it is evident within the teaching and academic staff.\nAvailable statistical data from the NCTE (see Figure 12)\nshow huge gender-disparity among faculty members. Using\ndata from the UCC and the NCTE, there were 3,105 full-time\nUndoubtedly, the male faculty and staff far exceed their\nfemale colleagues even in the so-called traditional fields\nwhere society has prescribed as the fitting academic disci-\nplines for women. Areas such as the arts, humanities, social\nsciences, and education are all male dominated. By all\nstandards, the human resource capacity, particularly at the\nuniversity level is persistently masculine; the ratio of male to\nfemale in support services is 5:1. Tettey (2010) argued that\nthe low proportion of female postgraduate students is a chal-\nlenge to faculty regeneration for universities.\nThe foregoing discussions have revealed that higher educa-\ntion in Ghana over the past two or so decades has witnessed\ndifferent levels of developments. Governments have provided\nthe financial support to expand access and participation, uni-\nversities have introduced several policies to improve their\nfinancial diversification approaches; universities are also\nstreamlining their admission processes, and have introduced\naffirmative action policies and quota system to increase female\nparticipation, as well as reserving admission slots for students\nfrom historically deprived Senior High Schools. However,\nvarious factors such as gender, region of origin, location of\nhigh school, and socioeconomic status of students continue to\nchallenge students' ability to access and participate in higher\neducation. Nonetheless, there still remain several policy initia-\ntives designed by the Government and institutions to broaden\naccessibility and participation for females, minorities, and\nindividuals from historically disadvantaged regions.\nPolicies Initiatives and Way Forward\nThe first policy initiative addresses spatial-based disparity.As\npart of efforts to provide opportunities for students who\nattended high schools in the rural areas, public universities in\nGhana have been accepting students from institutions that\nhave been identified by the GES as the Less-Endowed\nSecondary Schools (LESS) and who meet the minimum entry\nrequirements set by universities. Under the present competi-\ntive admission standards established by universities, some of\nthese students may not have been accepted into the university.\nThe UG, for example, has been admitting students from LESS\nFull-Time Teaching Faculty in Public Universities by Gender\nMale\nFemale\n% Male\n% Female\nFigure 12.

At the\nUCC, the Joint Admission Board identifies students from the\nLESS and admits them to pursue various programs.\nAnother important development is the creation of the reme-\ndial science program, the mature students' entrance examina-\ntions by the UCC, and the concessionary selections of students\nfrom deprived schools identified by the Joint Admissions\nBoard. This program accepts applications from students who\ndid not meet the highly selective admission requirements, but\ndemonstrated the potential to succeed in higher education.\nStudents who participate in this program are brought to the\nuniversity to take remedial classes and take final examina-\ntions. Successful students are accepted to pursue various aca-\ndemic programs of their interest.Available data from the UCC\nsity admitted about 80 students from a number of deprived\nareas from the several LESS in the country. At the KNUST,\nthe former Vice Chancellor, Professor Adarkwa in his\ndemic year, a total of 243 students (representing 3.5% of the\ntotal admission) comprising 183 males and 60 females were\noffered admissions under the LESS protocol (Adarkwa, 2007).\nwere qualified by admission criteria. In all, 12,008 students\nHowever, due to admission competitiveness and the lowering\nof cutoff points for all academic programs, the university was\nnot able to admit students from the LESS.\nIn addition to the above policies and programs, affirma-\ntive action policies have been instituted in university admis-\nsion since the mid-1990s as a corrective measure of the\nlong-standing historical gender-based disparities. To correct\nthis problem, universities have adopted various quota poli-\ncies such as lowering the admission cutoff points by 1 point\nfor female students in various programs. \"What this meant\nwas that if admissions for a program stopped at aggregate 12,\nall girls with that aggregate were guaranteed admission, or if\nthere was space for one aggregate below the cutoff, it was\nfilled with women\" (Tagoe, 2008, unnumbered document).\nAt the UCC, as a result of the affirmative action policy the\nUniversity increased its female enrollment from 2,091 dur-\ndates who applied for admission to the University (Morley\nMoreover, to address the socioeconomic-based disparity,\nthe MOE approved the Capitation Grant Scheme in 2005 to\neliminate school fees for all basic schools. Through its suc-\ncessful pilot implementation in 2004, it was observed that\neliminating school fees bridged the gender gaps in basic\nschools. For instance as a result of the Capitation Grant pro-\ngrams, enrollment at the Kindergarten rose from about\nwithin a period of one academic year.3 At the same time, pri-\nmary education showed expansion of female enrollment with\nan increase in the net enrollment rate from 59.1% during\nEducation Initiative [UNGEI]). The increase in enrollment\nwas particularly higher for girls than for boys, thus further\nnarrowing gender gaps. The national primary GPI has also\nimpacted the completion and graduation rates, the plethora\nof data available show its immediate success, particularly for\nthe poor and people from the rural areas of the country.\nConcluding Remarks\nHigher education in Ghana has seen outstanding develop-\nment relating to accessibility and participation. Within a\nperiod of 15 years, tertiary education enrollment increased\nment has seen considerable degree of improvement with a\nGhana has made positive and impressive progress toward\nincreasing access to education and narrowing gender gaps at\nthe pretertiary education levels, yet these developments have\nnot trickled down to the tertiary education level. Disparities\npersist among gender, rich and poor, location and regions of\norigin, academic programs, and the type of high school a stu-\ndent attended.\nWhereas providing access to higher education to all qual-\nified Ghanaians is financially impossible, there are certain\npolicies that could be streamlined to address the huge dis-\nparity rates. The first point of departure is a massive review\nof the \"full fee-paying\" policy being implemented by uni-\nversities alongside the student loan scheme. Generally, most\nGhanaians have come to realize that tertiary education can\nno longer subsist under the socialist agenda, although cur-\nrent developments show that tertiary education is indeed not\ncompletely free. Economically, there remains a small per-\ncentage of the Ghanaian population who are financially\ncapable of paying tuition fee, but financially, the majority of\nthe students will not be able to afford it. Psychologically, for\nstudents to embrace the idea of paying tuition for their edu-\ncation at the university level, they should be given enough\nloans to cover the cost of tuition, as well as other charges\nsuch as academic and residential facility user fees, and so\non. The implementation of the present student loan scheme,\nwhere all students, irrespective of their socioeconomic sta-\ntus are given the same amount is an affront to cost-sharing\nmechanisms. Thus, any efficient cost-sharing policy must be\naccompanied by a corresponding student loan scheme that is\ndesigned to expand access and participation. Moreover,\nthere should be a well-established need-based financial aid\nscheme that provides support for needy students. However,\nthe efficiency of a need-based student loan scheme depends\non the availability of accurate and reliable national database.\nThe current need-based assessment compiled by the Student\nLoan Trust Fund (SLTF) statistically lacks validity and reli-\nability as it is based on self-reported data from students.\nAnother important consideration is borrowers aversion to\nloans. Providing huge loan amount to students does not\neliminate the psychological fear of repayment after gradua-\ntion especially with the present rate of unemployment.\nUniversities have to reevaluate their curricular to prepare\nstudents with the skills needed for self-employment and the\nknowledge-based economy. When students are positive\nabout getting employment on graduation, borrowing for\ntheir education will be evaluated based on the social and\nprivate returns to their investment than the debt they accu-\nmulated while attending college.\nFurthermore, affirmative action and quota policies are\nperceived as some of the alternative policy initiatives\ndesigned to address educational inequities and disparities.\nOpponents have criticized this idea as reverse discrimination\nagainst male students. However, in the Ghanaian society,\nuniversities should be encouraged to raise the acceptance\nrates for students from LESS regardless of the level of com-\npetition in a given admission year particularly, for female\napplicants. This should be continued until such a time that\nthe country achieves gender parity at the higher education\nlevel. While admitting academically underprepared students,\nuniversity should consider establishing academic support\ncenters that will offer remedial support services for students\nwho may not be ready for college.\nAnother important policy development that has impacted\nhigher education participation in Ghana is the upgrading of\npolytechnics and TTCs into tertiary education status. To\ncomplement this initiative however, there is the need for\nefficient national curriculum development to established\ninstitution-wide articulation agreement to enhance easy\ntransfer of credits from one tertiary education to another.\nThis will not only provide credibility to the academic pro-\ngrams offered by the polytechnics, but also an easy route for\nstudents to enter the tertiary education system while reduc-\ning the pressure on public universities. In addition, it will\nenable the country to reconstitute higher education into a\nsingle unified system. While granting polytechnics the\naccreditation to run selected bachelor's degree programs is a\nnovel policy idea, this arrangement should not replace the\nexistence of efficient articulation agreement that builds\nstrong partnerships among colleges, polytechnics, and\nuniversities.\nIn conclusion, higher education access and participation in\nGhana is stratified by four equity concerns: gender-based dis-\nparity, socioeconomic status, spatial disparity, and program-\nbased disparity. The available data suggest that higher\neducation is inequitably distributed in favor of males, and\nindividuals from upper income bracket. Data from the Ghana\nLiving Survey indicate that higher education in Ghana is\ndominated by 67% of individuals from the richest quintile\nand 10% from the poorest two quintiles. Students from rural\nareas and regions with deprived economic and social infra-\nstructure do not have equal access to tertiary education as stu-\ndents from relatively economically endowed regions such as\nASH, ER, GAR, and CR. However, universities have devel-\noped various strategies to address the equity problems.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nNotes\n1. In this paper, higher education is used interchangeably with\ntertiary and postsecondary education. In Ghana, Tertiary edu-\ncation comprises of education provided by universities, poly-\ntechnics, colleges, and professional institutes.\n2. Reasons for exclusion may include: not meeting the restrictive\nand competitive admission requirements set by the universi-\nties and departments; not having the financial support to apply\nas tuition paying or one of the private universities. Although\nhigher education is theoretically tuition fee, there are several\ncharges that make it quite expensive for students without\nstrong family support. Besides, almost all the public universi-\nties in Ghana are concentrated in the main urban cities, which\nfavor students who either live in the cities or have strong urban\nties. The cost of living in these urban cities is very high.\n3. United Nations Girls Education Initiative (UNGEI) http://\nwww.ungei.org/infobycountry/ghana.html\nReferences\nAdarkwa, K. K. (2007).
