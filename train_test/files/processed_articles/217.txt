Fleishman2\n'Center for Organization and Delivery Studies, Agency for Health Care Policy and Research.\n2Center for Cost and Financing Studies, Agency for Health Care Policy and Research.\nMeasures of functional disability typically contain items that reflect limitations in performing activities of daily liv-\ning (ADLs) or instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs). Combining IADL and ADL items together in the same\nscale would provide enhanced range and sensitivity of measurement. This article presents psychometric justification\nfor a combined ADUIADL scale. Data come from 2,977 disabled respondents in the 1989 National Long-Term Care\nSurvey. Respondents indicated whether they received human help on 7 ADL items; they also indicated whether they\nwere unable to perform each of 9 IADL items due to health reasons. Factor analyses using tetrachoric correlations\ndemonstrated that 15 of the 16 items reflected one major dimension. Item response theory (IRT) methods were used\nto calibrate the items; a one-parameter IRT model fit the data. Item calibrations showed that ADL and IADL items\nwere not hierarchically related. Analyses showed that a simple sum of item responses could be used to derive a mea-\nsure of functional disability. Implications of using a 15-item ADUIADL scale for eligibility determination and for\ncomparing groups are discussed.\nSTUDIES of health status and quality of life, especially\nstudies of elderly persons, frequently assess functional\ndisability. Measures of functional disability play a key role\nin studies of the aging process, in clinical decision making,\nin evaluating the outcomes of treatment, in determining eli-\ngibility for certain services, and in estimating the preva-\nlence of service needs. Nagi's (1965) model provides a\nconceptual foundation for the development of measures of\nfunctional disability. This framework makes important dis-\ntinctions between impairments, functional limitations, and\ndisability. Impairments are anatomical, physical, or mental\nabnormalities or losses in one physical system, such as a\nmissing limb or brain damage; functional limitations refer\nto performance at the level of the whole organism, such as\nreaching or walking. Disability refers to limitations in per-\nformance of social roles and tasks in the context of the\nsocio-cultural and physical environment. In this frame-\nwork, disability refers to the social result of the interaction\nbetween disease, impairments, and functional limitations\ning is a functional limitation, it may or may not lead to a\nproblem with any activity, such as dressing or preparing\nmeals. In contrast, difficulty or needing help with bathing is\na disability because bathing is an important activity, such\nthat failure to perform this activity may have negative im-\nplications for personal health and for the performance of\nimportant social roles.\nThe concept of functional disability distinguishes basic\ndaily activities that are necessary to function personally\nand in the community from other major social roles, such\nFunctional disability refers to limitations in performing in-\ndependent living tasks, which are often further divided into\nactivities of daily living (ADLs), which include basic activ-\nities of hygiene and personal care, and instrumental activi-\nties of daily living (IADLs), which include basic activities\nnecessary to reside in the community, such as shopping,\nmanaging finances, housekeeping, and meal preparation\nMany more elderly persons have disabilities in IADLs\nthan ADLs. Although only about 2 million elderly persons\nare disabled in ADLs, approximately 4.1 million are dis-\nabled either in IADLs or ADLs (Stone & Murtaugh, 1990).\nWhen measuring functional disability, for some purposes it\nis desirable to include both ADL and IADL items. By in-\ncluding both types of activities a greater range of disability\ncan be measured. This article addresses the issues of\nwhether and how IADL and ADL items should be com-\nbined to yield an overall measure of functional disability.\nDifferent approaches for measuring functional disability\nvary in the manner in which they combine IADL and ADL\nitems. One common approach is to maintain separate mea-\nsures of ADLs and IADLs (e.g., Jette et al., 1987; Stern,\ndistinct constructs. A second common approach is to in-\nclude information on IADL disability only for those individ-\nuals without any ADL disability (e.g., Airman & Walden,\nThis approach treats ADLs and IADLs as one construct, and\nthus simplifies the measurement of functional disability by\nproviding a summary score. By including IADL informa-\ntion for those without ADL disability, the second approach\nextends the range of disability measurement and avoids a\nnarrow focus on only severe functional disability. But it ig-\nnores information about IADLs among those with ADL dis-\nability. Both approaches avoid combining ADL and IADL\ninformation for each respondent, regardless of ADL status.\nA third approach, which is considered in this article, is to\ndevelop a functional disability score that synthesizes all in-\nformation about ADL and IADL disabilities for each re-\nspondent in a psychometrically appropriate manner.\nCombining ADL and IADL items into one measure re-\nquires (a) determining if the measure is unidimensional,\nand (b) determining how to combine responses to several\nquestions into an aggregate score. With regard to the first\nissue, if separate questions measure different constructs,\ncombining responses into an overall score is misleading\nand inappropriate. With regard to the second issue, unjusti-\nfied protocols for combining responses to multiple items\nmay result in incorrect inferences about the relative disabil-\nity of individuals or groups. This article examines the legiti-\nmacy of and the proper procedure for combining ADLs and\nIADLs, using factor analysis and item response theory\nDimensionality. -- Controversy exists over whether\nfunctional disability is a unidimensional or multidimen-\nsional construct. If it is unidimensional, then ADLs and\nIADLs can be combined into one scale and a single score\ncan describe a unique level of disability. If, on the other\nhand, it is multidimensional, a set of measures is necessary\nto provide a functional disability profile for an individual.\nLawton and Brody (1969) suggested that IADLs require \"a\ngreater complexity of neuropsychological organization\"\nthan ADLs. However, they did not explicitly consider\nIADLs as a dimension distinct from ADLs. They observed\nthat, although IADL tasks were typically more complex\nthan ADLs, some overlap in degree of complexity between\nADLs and IADLs was possible.\nSubsequent research addressing the issue of dimensional-\nity is diverse and results are inconsistent. Some studies sug-\ngest that functional disability is multidimensional and have\nfound three or four separate constructs (Clark, Stump, &\nson, 1991). Other studies argue that ADLs and IADLs com-\nprise only one dimension (Kempen & Suurmeijer, 1990;\nent conclusions may result from differences in the specific\nitems used, and from variation in the methods used to deter-\nmine dimensionality.\nThe set of items analyzed in prior studies often includes\na mixture of items measuring impairments, functional limi-\ntations, and functional disabilities. Analyzing items reflect-\ning multiple constructs may affect the number of dimen-\nsions ascertained. For example, some studies include items\nconcerning bowel and bladder incontinence (Jagger, Clarke,\ncomprise a separate dimension in factor analyses. Incon-\ntinence is often measured in terms of bowel or bladder\ncontrol, reflecting an abnormality in a particular physical\nsystem; phrased in this manner, such items measure impair-\nments, not a functional disability. Other studies combine\nfunctional disabilities with functional limitations, such as\nwalking up stairs or upper or lower body limitations (e.g.,\nbending and reaching; Clark et al., 1997; Haley, McHorney,\n& Johnson, 1991). Few studies have focused on a core set\nof ADL and IADL activities when assessing dimensionality\nPrior studies have typically used factor analysis or prin-\ncipal components analysis to determine dimensionality, al-\nthough the decision rules and methods have varied (Fitz-\nfor conflicting results may be that some studies factor ana-\nlyze dichotomous variables, indicating presence or absence\nof a limitation for a particular task. Standard factor analysis\nmethods using Pearson correlation coefficients, however, are\nnot appropriate when variables are discrete or highly skewed\ntors may appear as a result of items with similar degrees of\nskewness loading together. Results may therefore be sensi-\ntive to the distribution of responses to the items. In addition,\nthe magnitude of Pearson correlations between dichotomous\nitems may have an upper limit less than 1, depending on the\nrelative skewness of both variables.\nWhen factor analyzing dichotomous variables, a recom-\nmended approach is to use tetrachoric correlations. Tetra-\nchoric correlations assume that observed dichotomous vari-\nables represent unobserved continuous variables with a\nbivariate normal distribution; the tetrachoric correlation es-\ntimates the relationship between these latent continuous\nvariables. The range of tetrachoric correlations is not con-\nstrained by disparate and skewed marginal distributions of\nobserved variables. In this study, we perform factor analy-\nses of dichotomous variables measuring functional disabili-\nties (i.e., ADLs and IADLs) using tetrachoric correlations\nand the statistically appropriate generalized least squares\nScaling procedures: IRT models. -- After the issue of di-\nmensionality has been resolved, the researcher must con-\nsider the psychometrically appropriate procedure for com-\nbining items into multi-item scales. Item response theory\n(IRT) provides a sophisticated framework for developing\nmeasurement scales and calibrating individual items within\na scale. For many years, IRT has been used to develop edu-\ncational and psychological tests (Lord, 1980). Only re-\ncently has IRT been applied to assess health status mea-\nsures (Haley, McHorney, & Ware, 1994; Granger et al.,\nCross, & Golden, 1989). Previous research applying IRT\nmethods to assess disability has analyzed heterogeneous\nsets of items that combine ADLs, IADLs, impairments, and\nfunctional limitations; the present research applies IRT\nmethods to a standard set of IADL and ADL items.\nAs applied to functional disability, IRT assumes that\nthere exists an unobserved (latent) continuous dimension of\ndisability, symbolized by 0, and that each individual can be\nplaced along this dimension at a point that reflects the\nextent of his or her functional disability. IRT estimates item\ncharacteristic curves (ICCs) for each item. The ICC shows\nthe probability of a positive response on a specific dichoto-\nmous item as a function of the latent disability level 6. In\nthe present context, the ICC shows how the probability of\nreporting a specific ADL or IADL disability varies, depend-\ning on one's underlying level of disability. (Figure 1 shows\nfour different ICCs.)\nIRT offers several advantages over classical psychomet-\nric approaches. First, classical item statistics, such as the\nproportion answering an item correctly or the item-total\ncorrelation, depend on the composition of the sample and\nthe specific combination of items used. Classical item\nstatistics are typically based on correlations, which are af-\nfected by the variances of the variables. In contrast, IRT\nitem parameter estimates are invariant (within a linear\ntransformation) to the population distribution of the trait\nbeing measured, analogous to regression coefficients (Ham-\nbleton, Swaminathan, & Rogers, 1991). Second, the IRT\nmodel is nonlinear, with an S-shaped ICC. In the analysis\nof dichotomous variables, nonlinear models have several\nadvantages that make them more attractive than the linear\nmodel of classical test theory (Waller et al., 1996). Third,\nIRT provides an estimate of reliability for each item. Unlike\nclassical test theory, which assumes that the scale's reliabil-\nity is constant for all respondents regardless of 6, in IRT an\nitem's reliability is not constant but varies, depending on 0.\nIRT thereby provides a mechanism for selecting items to\nmeasure a specific level of 9 most accurately. Fourth, IRT\nprovides a framework for assessing item bias.\nThe shape of the ICC is determined by two item parame-\nters (3, and a, where \"i\" refers to different items. Items may\nvary in their parameters, and their ICCs will have different\nshapes. (3,, the location parameter, represents the point\non the latent dimension that corresponds to a .5 probability\nof a positive response to the item (in a two-parameter\nIRT model). A high value of (3, implies that a high probabil-\nity of making a positive response to the item will be\npredominantly limited to individuals with high values of\n0. a, indexes the discrimination ability of the item (the\nslope of the curve). The greater the value of this param-\neter, the more sharply the item discriminates among indi-\nviduals with different values of 0 (at the point of inflection\nof the ICC). This parameter is roughly analogous to a factor\nloading in factor analysis; the greater the magnitude, the\ngreater the degree to which responses are affected by the la-\ntent variable. (3, reflects the point along the range of 0\nwhere the item discriminates best. Each item provides in-\nformation about 0 over the entire range of disability, but the\namount of information varies across the range of 0, and the\nmaximum information occurs at the value of the location\nparameter (Lord, 1980). Thus, one item may provide infor-\nmation about relatively mild levels of disability, whereas\nFigure 1. Illustrative item characteristic curves.\nanother item may discriminate best at severe levels of dis-\nability. IRT provides estimates of the (3, and a parameters\nfor each item.\nDescriptions of the IRT model typically refer to the loca-\ntion parameter ((3,) as the item's \"difficulty.\" The greater the\nmagnitude of this parameter, the lower the proportion of\npeople who answer positively. In the familiar context of\nIRT modeling -- educational testing -- estimates of ability\nare derived. In the gerontological literature, interest focuses\non disability. We have chosen to be consistent with this lit-\nerature and scale the items to measure disability. To avoid\nconfusing double negatives, we refer to the item's \"loca-\ntion,\" instead of its \"difficulty.\"\nOne- and two-parameter IRT models must be distin-\nguished. In the one-parameter model, all items have equal\nslopes (a,), and the ICCs for all items are parallel. With a\none-parameter model the location parameter establishes an\nunequivocal order of the items. In the two-parameter\nmodel, a, varies across items, and the ICCs may cross each\nother. In Figure 1, ICCs 1, 3, and 4 have the same slope,\nwhereas the slope is different for Item 2. The probability of\na positive response to Item 1 is higher than Item 2 at some\nlevels of disability and lower at other levels.\nThe number of parameters in the IRT model has signifi-\ncant implications for estimating each person's latent dis-\nability level, 8y. In a one-parameter model, the estimated\ndisability score for an individual depends only on the num-\nber of items that person answers positively. For example, all\npersons with four positive responses to a set of items re-\nceive the same estimated disability score, regardless of the\nparticular items each person answered positively. In con-\ntrast, with a two-parameter model the score depends on the\nparticular pattern of responses as well as the number of\nitems answered positively.\nThe goals of this article are to assess the dimensionality\nof ADLs and IADLs and to use IRT methods to estimate\ndisability scores for individuals. Several studies applying\nthe IRT methodology have assumed a one-parameter model\nwithout testing to see if it is appropriate (Haley, McHorney,\npare the one- and two-parameter IRT models. We discuss\nthe implications for research and for using functional dis-\nability measures to determine program eligibility.\nMETHODS\nData\nData are from the 1989 National Long-Term Care Survey\n(NLTCS; Manton, Corder, & Stallard, 1993). This survey\nwas designed to serve two purposes: (a) to provide a nation-\nally representative cross-sectional sample of functionally\ndisabled persons in 1989, and (b) to link with the prior\nfunctional disability. The original (1982) sample was taken\nfrom a Medicare enrollee frame provided by the Health\nCare Financing Administration. Persons who were impaired\ncluded in the 1989 survey and provided data on ADL and\nIADL problems. In addition, a screening process was used\n1984 surveys, as well as a sample of Medicare enrollees who\ning interview to determine if they had IADL or ADL prob-\nlems that had lasted or were expected to last three months. A\ntotal of 15,255 older adults (unweighted) completed screen-\ning interviews (Clark et al., 1997). Those with ADL or IADL\nproblems were eligible for the detailed 1989 survey, in addi-\ntion to those with prior impairment or institutionalization. A\ntotal of 4,463 people received the detailed interview.\nBecause the health status of a large number of disabled\npaired or institutionalized group were not functionally dis-\ncross sectional sample of functionally disabled persons, we\nrestricted the study sample to the 2,977 persons who were\nfunctionally disabled in at least one of sixteen ADLs or\nIADLs in 1989. This is a nationally representative sample\nof elderly functionally disabled persons in the community.\nMeasuring ADL and IADL Disability\nThe screened-in sample was given a detailed interview\nabout demographic characteristics, health status, impair-\nments, disabilities, number of caregivers and amount of\nADL and IADL help received. Measures of functional dis-\nability included activities of daily living (Katz et al., 1963)\nand instrumental activities of daily living (Lawton &\nBrody, 1969). The survey measured seven ADLs (bathing,\ndressing, getting around inside, transferring, toileting, in-\ncontinence, and feeding) and nine IADLs (preparing meals,\ndoing housework, doing laundry, shopping, managing\nmoney, taking medicines, telephoning, going places outside\nof walking distance, and getting around outside). The refer-\nence period was the week prior to the interview. For ADLs,\na positive (disabled) response was defined as receipt of\nhuman help to perform the task; human help included\nstandby as well as hands-on help. Use of special equipment\nto perform a task, in the absence of human help, was coded\nas nondisabled. This decision is consistent with a large\nbody of literature, beginning with Katz et al. (1963), that\ndistinguishes between dependence and independence. For\nincontinence, a positive response was defined as receiving\nhuman help with cleaning up accidents or with managing\na device, rather than bowel or bladder control per se; this\nreflects a focus on ability to maintain hygiene after acci-\ndents, rather than on propensity to have episodes of inconti-\nnence. (By focusing on maintaining hygiene, this item rep-\nresents a functional disability rather than an impairment,\nand thus is conceptually consistent with the other functional\ndisability items.)\nFor IADLs, the interview asked whether the person usu-\nally performed the task, whether the person could perform\nthe task if necessary, and whether any inability was due to\nhealth problems. Respondents were coded as disabled on\nIADLs if they usually did not perform the task, could not\nperform the task, and their disability resulted from a health\nproblem. In the survey, housework was defined as either\nheavy (e.g., scrubbing floors) or light (e.g., straightening\nup). However, persons were screened into the survey based\nonly on the light housework item. We limited consideration\nto light housework because persons disabled only in heavy\nhousework were ineligible for the survey.\nEstimation Procedures\nThe first phase of the analysis examined the dimensional-\nity of the 16 ADL and IADL items. As a cross-validation\nprocedure, the sample was split into halves, and analyses\nwere conducted separately for each half. In the first half,\nexploratory factor analyses were conducted; in the second\nhalf, confirmatory factor analyses were conducted. Both\nanalyses were based on the tetrachoric correlations among\nthe items, using the LISCOMP program (Muthen, 1988).\nIRT analyses were performed using the BILOG-MG pro-\ngram (Zimowski et al., 1996). BILOG-MG estimates the\nitem parameters by a marginal maximum likelihood proce-\ndure; estimates of each person's latent disability score are\nderived using a Bayesian (EAP: expectation a posteriori)\nThe analyses were limited to the subset of respondents\nwho had at least one \"disabled\" response to the initial set of\n16 items; those who gave a \"nondisabled\" response to all\n16 items were removed from the analyses. Ancillary analy-\nses were conducted, using the entire sample of 4,463, and\nthe ordering of items in terms of location parameters was\nidentical to that reported below. In fact, some IRT methods\ncannot provide an estimate of 9 for people who answer all\nitems correctly or incorrectly, and these respondents are au-\ntomatically removed from the analysis (Wright & Stone,\n1979). (The EAP method can provide such an estimate,\nhowever.) People who give a uniform response to all items\nprovide relatively little information concerning item param-\neters, and estimates of their 6 are relatively imprecise. If a\nlarge proportion of people give uniform responses to all\nitems, this points out that the scale is not sensitive to varia-\ntions outside of a specific range.\nRESULTS\nSample\nThe study sample consists of functionally disabled per-\npresents the frequency of positive responses (indicating dis-\nability) on each of the 16 IADL or ADL items. The propor-\ntion of the sample indicating a positive response ranged\nfrom 73% for \"going places outside of walking distance\" to\n14% for \"help with incontinence.\" Generally, IADL items\nhad the highest proportions with a positive response, and\nADL items typically had the lowest. However, there were\ntwo anomalies: \"bathing,\" an ADL, had the fourth highest\nproportion with a positive response, and \"telephoning,\" an\nIADL, had the third lowest.\nExploratory and Confirmatory Factor Analyses\nExploratory factor analyses of the tetrachoric correlations\nfor the first half of the sample (n = 1,489) revealed that the\nfirst eigenvalue was substantially greater in magnitude than\nthe remaining eigenvalues. The first three eigenvalues were\neigenvalues less than 1.0. One method for determining the\nnumber of factors, the scree method, looks for a large drop\nin the eigenvalues and then a trailing off of subsequent val-\nues (Rummel, 1970). If the first eigenvalue is large relative\nto the second, this suggests that the items are approximately\nunidimensional (Lord, 1980). A second rule for determining\nthe number of factors is the number of eigenvalues greater\nthan 1. The first method suggests a one-factor solution,\nwhereas the second suggests a three-factor solution.\nTable 2 presents the estimated factor loadings for a three-\nTable 1.

The ADL\nitems had strong (>.5) loadings on one factor; three items\n(\"managing money,\" \"taking medications,\" and \"using the\nphone\") that typically reflect cognitive confusion or poor\nmemory loaded strongly on the second factor. The IADL\nitems, however, tended to have moderate loadings on both\nthe second and third factors. Removing one item (\"go\nplaces outside of walking distance\") resulted in a clearer\nfactor structure: ADL items, IADL items, and \"cognitive\nIADL\" items each loaded strongly on one factor and rela-\ntively less strongly on the others. These results, combined\nwith the fact that \"go places outside of walking distance\"\ncould reflect the availability of transportation rather than\ndisability, led us to discard this item from further analyses.\nEigenvalues were recalculated, based on the reduced set of\n15 items. The large first eigenvalue pattern was maintained.\nAlthough the three-factor model was clear and inter-\npretable, the factors themselves had moderately strong cor-\nfactor model, the ADL items loaded strongly (>.76O) on the\nfirst factor and IADL items loaded strongly (>.714) on the\nsecond.

Ham-\nbleton, Swaminathan, and Rogers (1991) noted that the uni-\ndimensionality assumption of IRT is met adequately if a\ndominant component or factor underlies responses to the\nitems. The results thus justify estimating unidimensional\nitem-response models for these data. Consequently, IRT\nanalyses proceeded, based on a one-factor model.\nIRT Analyses\nTable 4 presents results of IRT analyses of 15 items for\nthe entire sample of 2,977 respondents. Both one- and two-\nparameter models were estimated.

Other items maintained the same rel-\native order in both models.\nSeveral factors suggest that the one-parameter model\nprovides an acceptable fit. First, the fit of the two-parameter\nmodel was not markedly better than the one-parameter\nmodel, insofar as a 2% reduction in chi-square was substan-\ntively trivial. Second, many of the items had slope parame-\nters of similar magnitude. Third, the correlation between\nthe estimated 6s in the one- and the two-parameter models\nwas .994. We therefore decided that the improvement in fit\nof the two-parameter model did not outweigh its added com-\nplexity. Subsequent analyses focused on the one-parameter\nmodel. The reliability of the one-parameter scale was .88,\nbased on estimates of true-score and error variance derived\nItem location parameters. -- The item location parame-\nters for the one-parameter model ranged from a low of\nthis is a one-parameter IRT model, the ordering of item lo-\ncation parameters was consistent with the proportion re-\nsponding positively to each item (Table 1). Although there\nwas a general clustering of IADL items at the low end and\nADLs at the high end of the scale, IADL and ADL items\ndid overlap in terms of their location parameters. For exam-\nple, \"bathing\" had the third lowest location after \"shop-\nping\" and \"laundry.\" At the high end of the scale, five out of\nthe highest six items were ADLs, but \"telephoning\" was lo-\ncated with ADLs. \"Getting around inside\" preceded \"light\nhousework,\" based on the point estimates, although confi-\ndence intervals for their locations did overlap.\nOne of the features of IRT is that the distribution of item\nlocation parameters determines the breadth of disability the\nscale measures and how well it differentiates disability lev-\nels in a particular range. Large gaps in item location param-\neters identify points at which 0 is measured with relatively\nless precision, and suggest that the precision of the scale\ncould be improved by adding additional items with location\nparameters that fill the gaps. Examining the location param-\neters for the one-parameter model reveals several clusters\nof items with gaps between the clusters (Table 4).\nBecause \"shopping\" had by far the lowest location pa-\nrameter, including this item in the scale helps to identify\ndifferences in disability at the low end of the range. \"Laun-\ndry\" and \"bathing\" were at the next level, but there was a\nlarge gap between them and \"shopping\" with respect to the\nand -.103). \"Getting around outside\" and \"preparing\nmeals\" were next in terms of their location along the dis-\nability dimension. The next group of six items had similar\nlocation parameters in the middle of the continuum, rang-\nand \"toileting\" and \"telephoning.\" A further gap occurred\nbetween these items and the last two items (\"feeding\" and\n\"incontinence\"). Overall, the 15-item scale has maximum\nprecision at .5, near the \"light housework\" item. This re-\nflects the relatively large number of items with location pa-\nrameters between .3 and .6.\nEstimates of disability. -- Table 5 presents the distribu-\ntion of the IRT estimates of disability (6j). As noted, these\nestimates were derived using a Bayesian approach, as the\nmean of the posterior distribution of 6. A feature of the one-\nparameter IRT model is that all persons with the same num-\nber of positive responses have the same estimated 6. The\ndistribution of disability estimates thus has 16 discrete val-\nues. (Because we dropped one item from the analysis, it\nwas possible for some respondents to answer all the re-\nmaining items negatively, resulting in a raw score of zero.)\nBecause the origin and unit for the scale of 6 is arbitrary,\nwere normalized to a mean of zero and a\nvariance of 1. To aid in interpretation of the 0 estimates,\nand to have a metric similar to a count, the expected num-\nber of items on which a respondent was disabled was cal-\nculated for each value of 0. This was accomplished by in-\nserting the item parameter estimates and the estimate of 0\ninto the formula for the item characteristic curve for each\nitem, using this formula to calculate the probability of an-\nswering each item in the affirmative, and summing these\nprobabilities across all 15 items (Hambleton, Swaminathan,\nIn general, the intervals between expected scores were\nroughly equal. Only one interval, between raw scores of 8\nand 9, was as much as two times the average. Relatively\nsmaller than average intervals appeared between 0 and 1, 1\nand 2, and 5 and 6. The number of items with positive re-\nsponses (the \"raw count\" score) correlated .99 with the 0\nestimate from the one-parameter model and with the ex-\npected score. This result, together with the relatively equal\nspacing between the expected scores, suggest that a simple\ncount of the IADLs and ADLs may be a reasonable approx-\nimation to the 0 estimate from the one-parameter model\nwhen measuring disability.\nTable 5. Distribution of Estimated Disability Scores Table 6. Estimated Disability by Gender, Race, and Age Groups\nEstimated\nTheta Raw Count N\nExpected\nCount\nMean Hours\nof Help\nRelationships with Other Variables\nWe examined the relationship of the 15-item scale with\nseveral relevant variables, including a measure of the total\nnumber of hours of IADL and ADL help received in the last\nweek. In the 1989 NLTCS, for each ADL and IADL, the re-\nspondent named both formal and informal caregivers. For\neach caregiver (up to six), respondents indicated how many\nhours of ADL help and how many hours of IADL help were\nprovided in the last week. The correlation between the\nIADL/ADL scale and total hours of IADL/ADL help was\n.7. In a regression analysis of total hours of help on 3 sepa-\nrate scales, corresponding to the three factors postulated in\nthe IADL/ADL scale alone, indicating little gain in ex-\nplanatory power from separating functional disability into\nthree variables, rather than one. Table 5 shows that the\nmean hours of help ranged from 7 hours a week for persons\nwith no disabilities to 99 hours for persons with 15 disabili-\nties. This demonstrates the broad range of disability needs\nthat this scale covers, from needs averaging as little as 1\nhour a day to essentially around-the-clock help.\nTable 6 presents mean estimates of 0 for groups based on\ngender, race (White/non-White) and age (less than 80 vs 80\nor older). As expected, older disabled respondents had\nhigher mean disability than younger ones. In addition, aver-\nage disability was higher among disabled non-Whites than\namong disabled Whites. It is surprising that mean disability\nwas higher among men than among women (5.6 for men vs\n5.0 for women based on the raw count; t = 3.3). Previous\nresearch has shown that women are more likely than men to\nbe functionally disabled (Dawson, Hendershot, & Fulton,\nlikely than men to have nonfatal chronic conditions (Ver-\nbrugge, 1987). The present results show that, despite over-\nall lower prevalence rates, among the disabled, men have\nmore severe disability than women.\nWhen interpreting this finding, one concern is that, con-\ntrolling for their underlying level of disability, men would\nbe more likely to respond positively to IADL items because\nVariable Estimated 8\nExpected\nCount Raw Count\nGender\nMale\nFemale\nRace\nWhite\nNon-White\nAge\nthey may not normally do these activities. In other words,\ngender bias in types of activities routinely performed might\nexplain this result. To deal with this concern, some re-\nsearchers reduce the number of IADL items used for men\n(Lawton & Brody, 1969). Another approach, which was\nused in the NLTCS, is to ask if inability to do an IADL is\ndue to health problems. This approach should reduce the\ngender bias problem, but may not be sufficient to remove\nit totally.\nA major advantage of IRT is its capability of systemati-\ncally assessing differential item functioning (DIF). If an\nitem has substantially different parameters in different sub-\ngroups, this suggests that the item may be \"biased,\" reflect-\ning a variable in addition to the one being measured\n(Thissen, Steinberg, & Wainer, 1992). We tested for gender\nDIF by performing a multiple-group IRT analysis and exam-\nining the largest differences in location parameters for men\nand women. For women, location parameters were lower for\nthree items (\"shopping,\" \"going outside,\" and \"bathing\"),\nand were higher for three other items (\"taking medications,\"\n\"telephoning,\" and \"light housework\"). Removing the latter\nthree items from the scale did not alter the conclusion that\nmen were more disabled (expected counts were 4.97 for\nformer set of items would make men even more disabled\nrelative to women.) Although an extensive DIF analysis is\nbeyond the scope of this article, these results illustrate the\npotential for IRT to illuminate issues of DIF.\nDISCUSSION\nThis article has addressed the question of whether IADL\nand ADL items can be combined into a single scale to mea-\nsure functional disability. Results suggest two major con-\nclusions. First, factor analyses indicated that 15 ADL and\nIADL items can be represented as a one-dimensional con-\nstruct. This justifies combining these items into a single\noverall scale. Major advantages of the 15-item IADL/ADL\nscale are its larger range, compared to scales based solely\non IADLs or on ADLs, as well as its parsimony, compared\nto using separate ADL and IADL scales. Second, IRT anal-\nyses explicitly compared the one- and two-parameter IRT\nmodels and found that the one-parameter model adequately\nrepresented the data. The implication of this finding is that\nthe total number of items with a \"disabled\" response is\nsufficient to represent a person's level of functional disabil-\nity. In addition, the analysis identified gaps in the scale\nwhere discrimination could be improved by additional well-\nchosen items.\nDimensionality\nPrior analyses that obtained a multidimensional structure\ngenerally used more heterogeneous sets of items, which in-\ncluded measures of bowel or bladder continence and physi-\ncal limitations in addition to ADLs and IADLs. Item het-\nerogeneity may have contributed to the emergence of\nmultiple dimensions. One exception is Fitzgerald et al.\n(1993), who used a standard set of IADL and ADL items;\nthey found four correlated factors including an incontinence\nfactor. Their study sample, hospitalized persons aged 45\nand over, was very different from the other studies. In addi-\ntion, like many studies, they used principal components\nanalysis with dichotomous variables, which may result in\nadditional artifactual factors.\nStump, and Wolinsky (1997) fit a three-factor model using\n10 of the 15 items considered in this article (excluding\ndressing, meal preparation, getting around outside, help\nwith incontinence, and eating). They used items from the\nscreener, which did not provide as much detail as corre-\nsponding items from the community interview. They found\nthat a three-factor model fit adequately for the whole sam-\nple, as well as for subgroups of White men, White women,\nand Black women. However, Clark et al. did not report in-\nterfactor correlations, nor did they directly compare one-\nand three-factor models.\nThe use of Pearson correlations in factor analyses of di-\nchotomous items, as in some prior studies, may result in a\nbias toward multiple-factor solutions. For dichotomous (or\npolytomous) items, the maximum value of Pearson correla-\ntion coefficients may be constrained to be less than 1.0 due\nto differential skewness of the items. This may lead, in turn,\nto relatively low estimates of interitem or interfactor corre-\nlations. Using data from the first half of the sample, a stan-\ndard principal components analysis, which used Pearson\ncorrelations among the 15 items and specified 3 factors,\nyielded interfactor correlations ranging from .40 to .52.\nThese interfactor correlations were lower in magnitude than\nthose obtained using tetrachoric correlations, and they\nmake a weaker case for selecting a unidimensional repre-\nsentation for these items. The choice of a correlation coeffi-\ncient may thus have led other investigators to prefer multi-\nfactor models.\nThe use of tetrachoric correlations when analyzing di-\nchotomous items is considered the methodological \"gold\nstandard\" (Stump, Clark, Johnson, & Wolinsky, 1997). How-\never, tetrachoric correlations rely on the assumption that\nthat underlying latent variables are normally distributed.\nChecks of this assumption in the current data, using the\nmethod proposed by Muthen and Hofacker (1988), sug-\ngested that this assumption was violated in a number of in-\nstances. The effects of violating this assumption on esti-\nmates of factor loadings and interfactor correlations are\nlargely unknown, however (Muthen, 1993). More method-\nological work needs to be conducted to develop procedures\nfor dealing with any such violations in applied research.\nAlthough the present results warrant treating these items\nas unidimensional, for some purposes, distinguishing three\nfactors might have heuristic value. It is possible that the\nthree factors might have different sets of antecedents or\nconsequences. However, when examining the consequences\nof functional disability, using a single scale offers analytic\nadvantages; in particular, including multiple subscales, with\nsubstantial intercorrelations, into a single regression model\ncan give rise to problems of collinearity and related diffi-\nculty in interpreting regression coefficients. In addition, the\npresent results do suggest that, in contrast to one- or three-\nfactor models, a two-factor model (ADLs and IADLs) was\nnot the best representation of these data. Neither the scree\ntest nor the number of eigenvalues greater than 1 pointed to\na two-factor model; in addition, solutions with two factors\nlacked the simple factor structure of a three-factor model\nand also revealed very high interfactor correlations. The\ncommon practice of deriving one scale of ADLs and a sepa-\nrate scale of IADLs may not be justified.\nIRT Analyses\nThe IRT analyses demonstrated that a one-parameter\nmodel fit the data adequately. Although a likelihood-ratio\ntest showed that the two-parameter model fit significantly\nbetter than a one-parameter model, a large sample size can\nproduce significant differences that are substantively trivial.\nMoreover, the extremely high correlation between the indi-\nvidual disability estimates from the one- and two-parameter\nmodels implies that the two-parameter model does not add\na great deal of information beyond the one-parameter\nmodel. The one-parameter model also has the advantage of\nassuring that items can be ordered unambiguously, in the\nsense that their ICC curves do not cross. In sum, the one-\nparameter model provides a simple and parsimonious rep-\nresentation for these data, whereas the slightly improved fit\nof the two-parameter model is outweighed by its added\ncomplexity. If a two-parameter model had been preferred,\nthe implication would have been that an optimal disability\nscore would have to consider the pattern of responses to each\nitem, not simply the total number of \"disabled\" responses.\nIRT provides other valuable information for assessing\nand developing measurement scales. First, the IRT esti-\nmates of 0 can be treated as comprising an interval scale\n(Wright & Stone, 1979); in contrast, the number of disabled\nitems does not possess interval-scale properties. Whereas\nthe product-moment correlation between the IRT estimate\nof 0 and the number of \"disabled\" responses will often be\nses, such as when estimating change in 0 over time, having\nan interval scale would be useful. Second, unlike classical\ntest theory, IRT highlights the fact that a scale's reliability\nfluctuates across the latent dimension, depending in part on\nthe combination of item location parameters. Examination\nof the scale's measurement precision at each point along\nthe latent dimension aids in further item and scale develop-\nment. Third, comparisons of item parameters across differ-\nent subgroups provide a means of testing for differential\nitem functioning, which may affect group comparisons.\nIRT provides explicit procedures for selecting items to\nmeasure particular ranges of 0 with precision. For example,\ninterest may center on measuring relatively severe levels of\ndisability. ADLs are often used for this purpose. IRT item\nlocation parameters could be used to select a subset of\nitems focused on this range. IRT analyses in this article\nsuggest that most, but not all, ADL items do reflect high\nlevels of disability, but \"bathing\" had a location parameter\nlower than some IADL items, while \"telephoning\" had a lo-\ncation parameter higher than many ADLs. Thus, for mea-\nsuring severe disability, improvements may be possible by\nadding IADL items, such as \"telephoning,\" to the standard\nset of ADL items. Moreover, if the number of items to mea-\nsure severe functional disability is limited, one might con-\nsider removing \"bathing\" from a set of ADL items. On the\nother hand, to measure less severe disability, \"bathing\"\nmight be combined with IADL items.\nThe IRT analyses excluded a large number of people\nwithout any measured disability. For the purposes of cali-\nbrating the scale, persons with a score of zero provide mini-\nmal information concerning the performance of the items.\nAnalogously, if one administered a mathematics test con-\nsisting of simple addition problems to college students, one\ncould conclude only that the test was too easy for the large\nnumber of persons with perfect scores. For this group, one\nwould not have a precise measure of their mathematics\nability, nor could one differentiate among them in terms\nof mathematics ability. Nevertheless, a score of zero on the\nADL/IADL scale does provide some important informa-\ntion. It is likely that an expanded disability scale, one which\nwas more sensitive to milder forms of disability, would pro-\nvide further discrimination among this group. Future efforts\nin scale development could address this issue.\nAdvantages of IRT over Gunman Scaling\nHistorically, ADLs and IADLs have frequently been ana-\nlyzed using Guttman scaling. If items follow a pure\nGuttman pattern, they have a hierarchical relationship; that\nis, they have a specific order in terms of increasing diffi-\nculty (i.e., higher location parameters). Katz et al. (1963)\nargued that the ADL items were approximately hierarchi-\ncally related, with an order (in terms of difficulty): bathing,\ndressing, toileting, transferring, incontinence, and feeding.\nThese items have very high Guttman coefficients of repro-\nducibility and scalability for home care and nursing home\nOne problem with Guttman methodology is that it as-\nsumes a deterministic, not a stochastic, model. In other\nwords, the ICC in the Guttman model specifies that, below a\ncertain difficulty level, a person has a zero probability of a\npositive response to the item, and, above that level, a posi-\ntive response is certain. The absence of a random error com-\nponent is unrealistic. Another problem is that the Guttman\nmodel presumes a specific ordering of items. However, sev-\neral different orderings of items can produce satisfactory\nGuttman scale coefficients of reproducibility and scalability\n(Lazaridis et al., 1994). Finally, it is often unclear how to\nscore respondents who have imperfect scale patterns. For\nexample, Katz developed his ADL scale by observing the\npatterns of items, combining a number of different patterns\ninto a single level of disability, and developing an \"other\"\ncategory for patterns that were not pure scale types. Often\nresearchers use high Guttman scale coefficients to justify or-\ndering people by counting the number of tasks with limita-\ntions, despite the fact that a number of response patterns do\nnot conform to the pure Guttman pattern.\nThe hierarchical relationship between IADLs and ADLs\nhas received less attention than relationships among ADLs\nor among IADLs, and Guttman scaling has been used to ad-\ndress this issue. Lawton and Brody (1969) suggested that\nIADLs were more complex than ADLs, implying that these\nitems would consistently have a lower location on a disabil-\nity scale. Spector et al. (1987), using Guttman scaling,\nfound that two IADLs, \"shopping\" and \"transportation,\"\nrepresented a lower level of disability relative to ADLs. The\npresent study, which used a much larger number of IADLs\nthan Spector et al. (1987), demonstrates that IADLs and\nADLs overlap in terms of item location parameters. For ex-\nample, \"getting around outside\" and \"preparing meals\"\nwere located between \"bathing\" and \"dressing.\" Suurmeijer\nsimilar overlap with IADL and ADL items. Thus, IADL\nand ADL items do not necessarily have a strict hierarchical\nrelationship.\nImplicationsfor Eligibility Determination\nStates are using functional disability measures to deter-\nmine who is eligible for long-term care and to determine\ntriggering criteria for the insured event in long-term care\npolicies. Although approaches vary, essentially all states\nuse activities of daily living, but many do not include in-\nstrumental activities of daily living criteria (U.S. General\nAccounting Office, 1994). Using a scale that includes both\nADLs and IADLs may enable more precise assessment of\nthe level of functional disability of applicants than using\nADLs alone. This would also affect who would be eligible\nfor these programs.\nWe compared an eligibility criterion based on the\nIADL/ADL scale to an ADL-only criterion, with the con-\nstraint that roughly the same number of persons would be\neligible under both criteria. Although the equal number cri-\nterion cannot be precisely met, a close comparison is be-\ntween a cutpoint of 4 or more ADL deficits using an ADL\nonly scale and 9 or more deficits on the ADL/IADL scale.\nWith this comparison, the eligible populations are 735 and\n713, respectively. By considering both ADLs and IADLs\nwhen scoring disability, the IADL/ADL scale cutpoint of 9\nor more deficits would include 86 persons with less than 4\nADLs who have at least 6 IADL deficits. It excludes 108\npersons with four or more ADLs who have few IADL\ndeficits. Thus, in about 15% of these cases, the ADL only\ncriterion and the IADL/ADL criterion lead to discrepant\nconclusions. (Of course, this discrepancy would depend on\nthe specific ADL cutpoint.) The extent of this misallocation\ncan be viewed by looking at the mean hours of ADL and\nIADL help received. Those eligible using the ADL only cri-\nterion, but not eligible with the ADL/IADL criterion, aver-\naged 45 hours of care; those eligible with the ADL/IADL\ncriterion, but not eligible with the ADL only criterion, aver-\naged 51 hours of care. Those eligible under both criteria\naveraged 78 hours of care; those not eligible averaged 18\nhours. As expected, the ADL/IADL scale, rather than the\nADL scale only, more effectively targets persons who\nwould receive more hours of ADL and IADL care.\nFuture Research\nWe have demonstrated the feasibility and validity of\ncombining ADLs and IADLs into one scale for a represen-\ntative sample of functionally disabled elderly persons living\nin the community. It is important to remember that the scal-\ning properties are dependent on the exact items and defini-\ntions of disability used. An important research question is\nthe degree to which different definitions of disability affect\nscale properties. In this study the ADL items measured the\nreceipt of human help, including receipt of standby help.\nOther studies have included use of mechanical help in\ndefining ADL disability; still others present definitions that\nexclude both standby and mechanical help (Leon & Lair,\nOther surveys and researchers define disability in terms\nof respondent reports of difficulty in performing tasks, and\nthey may or may not separate out those who receive human\nhelp. Using a definition in terms of difficulty may introduce\nvariation due to respondents' different conceptions of what\nis \"difficult\"; on the other hand, such a definition has the\nadvantage of extending the range of measurement of dis-\nability by including persons who have difficulty but do not\nneed human help. In contrast, a definition reflecting re-\nceived help restricts the range of disability measured, and it\nconfounds aspects of the person's support network with dis-\nability. Ideally, a measure of disability based on human\nhelp should be defined in terms of need rather than in terms\nof receipt, so that it avoids a confound with availability of\ncaregivers. However, no consensus exists on the proper way\nto measure need. Sensitivity analyses are necessary to as-\nsess how changes in wording, definitions of disability, and\nresponse scales alter IRT item parameters.\nIRT analyses can identify points along the range of 9 in\nwhich additional items would improve the precision of the\nscale. \"Gaps\" between item location parameters indicate\nsuch points. Future efforts need to improve the scale by de-\nveloping items to address the gaps identified in the analy-\nses, including at the low end of the scale (between \"shop-\nping\" and \"laundry\"), at the moderately high end (between\n\"toileting\" and \"telephoning\"), and at the high end of the\nscale (between \"toileting\" and \"telephoning'V'feeding'7\n\"help with incontinence\"). Future research should also ex-\ntend the range of the scale by developing items to measure\nless severe functional disability.\nFuture research should examine whether item locations\nare independent of demographic and impairment character-\nistics. For example, comprehensive analyses of possible dif-\nferential item functioning by gender, which cross-validate\nthe DIF analyses in the present article, would be valuable.\nFuture DIF analyses should also examine if item parame-\nters are sufficiently constant across the age spectrum to jus-\ntify using the scale to compare elderly persons with\nyounger persons. Further, the present research needs to be\nreplicated for other populations, such as the under-65 dis-\nabled, to assess whether the scale provides a common mea-\nsure of disability across all impairment groups. A study of\nthe Functional Independence Measure, a measure com-\nmonly used in medical rehabilitation, indicated that there is\nlittle item bias for motor items except for burns and back\npain groups (Heinemann, 1993). The extent that these re-\nsults apply to ADL/IADL scales must be determined.\n"
