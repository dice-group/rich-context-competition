    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis article investigates accrual, role, and impact of social capital of the southern Sudanese formerly known as the Sudanese\nrefugee Lost Boys living in the greater Kansas City area. Since their resettlement in the United States in 2000, Sudan has seen\na dramatic transition in its long geo-political conflict since its independence in 1956 ending up in cessation of the south from\nthe north. This cessation has created the newest country in the world (South Sudan). Simultaneously, a group of refugee\nBoys commonly known as the Lost Boys of Sudan has renounced being called so. Instead, they prefer being called \"South\nSudanese.\" The study uses semi-structured interviews to assess the degree of social capital of each refugee participant\nrelative to types of \"capital\" valued in mainstream American society. An adjunct inquiry is finding what type of social capital\nendured by each of these Boys played a key role in helping them cope/integrate into American mainstream society.\n",

Before most could\neven step foot in their \"motherland,\" there emerged a major\nobstacle to their return. In December 2013, the newest country\nplunged into yet another conflict between the southerners\nthemselves. This conflict has been termed as civil war by some\ninternational monitoring agencies (\"The Descent Into Civil\nStart of the Historic Journey of the Lost\nBoys\ntheir homes due to outbreaks of violence in southern Sudan\n(Messina & Messina, 2007, \u00b6 2).

Further, they did not know whether their fami-\nlies were alive or dead.

Many of the Boys did not know\ntheir birth date and were assigned an age (minors or legal\nadults) by the U.S. government to facilitate their resettlement\nprocess in the United States (Messina & Messina, 2007, \u00b6 2).\nThe intention of randomly assigning them ages was to make\nthem eligible to receive benefits under government pro-\ngrams for unaccompanied minors in the United States\nwas enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in\n2002 that established a new status for refugee unaccompa-\nnied children under the term \"unaccompanied alien chil-\ndren\" (UAC). To qualify under this act, one had to be less\nthan 18 years, lack lawful immigration status, and by the\ntime of arrival in the United States one should be without\nparents or guardians who would take care of that individual.\nThis seems to contradict the Refugee Act of 1980 as stipu-\nlated in the Congressional Research Service (CRS) Report\nfor Congress that states, \"(1) to provide a uniform procedure\nfor refugee admissions; and (2) to authorize federal\nassistance to resettle refugees and promote their self-\nConsequences of Arbitrary Assigned\nAge\nThe demographic age resettlement arrangements immedi-\nately raised unforeseen challenges. Whereas minors were\nplaced under foster families where they received social and\neducational support, those resettled as legal adults had to\nsecure employment immediately to fend for themselves;\nthey were provided with apartments rent-free for 3 months\nbut had to start paying rent thereafter. Acquisition of\nEnglish language skills was primary to secure even a man-\nual job in the United States. Another challenge that emerged\nwas the lack of previous work experience as most had not\nworked in Africa. School-aged children rarely work in\nAfrica as the vast majority depended on their parents as\nproviders. In contrast, U.S. children as young as 16 years\nold are permitted to work. Orphaned and resettled in the\nUnited States, they soon discovered that nothing was free.\nThis point was driven home when legal adults were\ninformed that as soon as they started working, they had to\nrepay the purchase price of the airplane tickets which\nallowed them to leave Africa as well as certain medical\nexpenses (Bixler, 2005). Some Boys found it necessary to\nwork two or three jobs to pay their bills and tuition, and to\nremit some money to family and friends back in Africa\nBoys needed to accrue substantial valued social capital in\ntheir new host country which they lacked from Africa:\nbeing fluent in English language, working individually,\nkeeping time, being efficient, working hard and becoming\nU.S. Refugee Policies and Utilization of\nSocial Capital by the Lost Boys\nThe Lost Boys who reside in the Kansas City area moved\nthere due to secondary migration reasons. Secondary migra-\ntion refers to any circumstances that prompt immigrants to\nmove from one location within the United States to another.\nAccording to the Office of Multicultural Affairs, it is very\ncommon for immigrants to relocate to other states and cities\nin search of better work, cheaper housing, safer neighbor-\nhoods, or to be closer to friends or family. The Office of\nRefugee Resettlement (ORR) is aware of secondary migra-\ntion and has a clause that caters for this in Sec. 412. [8 U.S.C.\nIn their empirical research on why East African immi-\ngrants moved to live in Kansas City and Missouri, Janzen\net al. found socio-economic reasons as the most important\nfactors:\nLife was more straight-forward in the Midwest than in big cities\nof the East; educational and job opportunities were available\nmore advantageously; raising families was possible. (Janzen,\nAn Ethiopian immigrant, Daniel Fikru, who migrated to\nKansas City, confirms the above assertion by saying,\nKansas City is not a crowded place. There's a lot of opportunity.\nHousing, education is affordable. (Beardsley, 2005, \u00b6 6)\nA participant in my study affirmed the above by saying,\nAlot of Lost Boys came from other states to Kansas City because\nof educational and job opportunities. Another thing is that if you\nhave a Lost Boy who is your friend in another location, you can\ncall him to come and live with you. (Mabeya, 2011)\nIndeed Berger confirms Janzen et al. by explaining that Peter\nNyarol Dut, one of the Lost Boys, left Houston, Texas, for\nKansas because he was frustrated with trying to make ends\nmeet and trying to get educated (Berger, 2004). More so,\nhe felt discriminated against. He found it difficult to adjust\nto the urban environment in Houston. An article by Nancy\nBeardsley of Voice of America asserted that new waves of\nimmigrants were transforming Kansas City and Missouri.\nThis included African Americans moving from the south-\nern United States to more northern states (Beardsley,\nDemographics of the Lost Boys in the\nKansas City Area\nMore than 100 Sudanese refugee Lost Boys were living in\nthe Kansas City metropolitan area at the time of this study.\nThe exact number of Lost Boys at any given time is difficult\nto verify because of constant undocumented migration that\noccurs; therefore, the accounted number of refugees varies\nthey arrived in Kansas City, they were received by St. James\nUnited Methodist Church and former Kansas City Mayor,\nEmmanuel Cleaver, who assisted in settling the Lost Boys. In\nother cases, early arrivals assisted later refugee arrivals (Gak,\n2006). Gak, president of the Brothers' Organization for\nRelief, says, in May 2000, nine Lost Boys arrived in Kansas\nCity and were soon followed by 25 others. Later, 25 more\nLost Boys arrived in Kansas City and by 2001 there was a\ntotal of 59 Lost Boys living in the greater Kansas City area.\nAccording to Gak, most of the Lost Boys who live in Kansas\nCity relocated from other U.S. states (Gak, 2006). One study\non East African immigrants living in the Kansas City area\nDinka origin living in Olathe, Kansas itself (Myers, 2004).\nThey were partly assisted in their resettlement by religious\nand charitable organizations.\nFrom Table 1, it is clear that the Lost Boys were not\ndirectly resettled in the Kansas City area in 2000. One politi-\ncal reason is that Kansas had been demographically viewed\nas White, mainstream Americana by the media for many\nthe then Kansas Senator, Sam Brownback (now governor),\nhad opposed the resettlement of Somali Bantu refugees from\nAfrica citing their huge populations and cultural differences\n(Barnett, 2003, \u00b6 1). He later supported a bill that allowed\nresettlement of refugees fromAfrica to Kansas partly because\nstates have no control over refugee resettlement programs\naccording to the Refugee Protection Act of 2001. He has\nsince met with some Lost Boys (Mabeya, 2011).\nThe Research Question\nThis study narrows down on a prior dissertation study on\nrefugee Sudanese Lost Boys in the greater Kansas City Area,\nand seeks to address the following ethnographic and demo-\ngraphic research question through investigation: What fac-\ntors and developments shaped the Lost Boys' experiences in\nAmerica?\nSocial Capital Theory\nSociologists have argued that it is important for people to\nacquire social capital, and that the acquisition of social capi-\ntal can improve a person's material and social circumstances.\nThis assertion is supported by Coleman who argues that\nsocial capital can determine what kinds of resources are\nmade available to individuals and/or group as it is defined by\nits function (Coleman, 1988). Coleman also argues that inte-\ngration of people into a new society is done on an individual\nbasis and not necessarily as a group because each individual\nhas different amounts of social capital. For instance, in his\nstudy of migrants living in Europe, Castles found that some\nhad \"integrated,\" some joined \"multi-cultural\" communities,\nand some were marginalized and experienced cultural \"seg-\nregation\" (Castles, 1993). In my primary investigations, like\nCastles, I found the Lost Boys had a fairly wide range of\nexperiences during their more than 10 years stay in the\nUnited States, providing evidence of their segmented assimi-\nlation (Alba & Nee, 2003). Bol Biong Bol (executive direc-\ntor of the Sudanese Community Association, a San\nDiego-based organization that helps refugees assimilate in\nAmerica) supports my assertion by explaining,\nThe hard fact is that in the U.S., Social Darwinism is still the\noperating principle. As time goes by, we will have some Lost\nBoys who will be very successful, and we will have some people\nwho will remain on the lower economic level, and we will have\nWhat constitutes social capital has generated varying\ninterpretations and definitions among scholars and is ever\nexpanding. For instance, Fukuyama says, \"social capital can\nTable1.

For example, all the above\nthinkers treat social capital as a valued good thing. However,\nmuch is not said about lack of the \"valued\" social capital.\nPerhaps a more in-depth analysis and synthesis of social\ncapital is done by Woolcock (2003). After reviewing social\ncapital theory, Woolcock distinguished and summarized\nsocial capital theory into three major categories: bonding,\nbridging, and linking. In the following section, I will explain\neach of them in detail and how they relate to the integration\nprocess of the Lost Boys.\nBonding social capital can be said to be horizontal, mean-\ning it occurs among people who are homogeneous (the Lost\nBoys consider themselves brothers though most were not\nblood related). This is a \"vital capital\" that helps them in\ntimes of difficulty. Bonding brings and ties people of similar\nsituations together (e.g., a family, an affinity group, ethnic\ngroup, club, or church). Horizontal bonding creates networks\nof individual or groups of refugees which enhance commu-\nnity productivity and cohesion that can become positive\nsocial capital asset. Putnam calls this productivity and cohe-\nsion the \"Super Glue\" of society (Putnam, 2000). It is the\ninward looking of social networks that mobilizes solidarity\namong a group. In some cases, immigrants/refugees relocate\nto areas where their own ethnic communities reside and thus\nwill share both economic and social assets. According to\nDustmann, immigrants are very rational when it comes to\nchoosing their place of residence in a new country. They\nquickly become aware of favorable and unfavorable condi-\ntions in their new environment that are associated with devi-\nTherefore, immigrants/refugees who are resettled in unfa-\nvorable environments with limited social opportunities will\nrelocate after some time to places where they think they will\nlikely maximize their opportunities and more so be closer to\ntheir families and friends. The Lost Boys who participated in\nthis study relocated from other cities/states because of avail-\nability of opportunities in the greater Kansas City area which\nhad initially attracted a small number of them. As time went\nby, those who were already settled in the greater Kansas City\narea spread word about a welcoming environment in Kansas\nCity area, availability of opportunities, and a an ever grow-\ning population of the Sudanese community. The new infor-\nmation started to attract more and more Lost Boys. One\nnotable observation that I made was that those who relocated\nto the Kansas City area first were legal adults. Legal adults\nwere free to emigrate from one city/state to another, whereas\nthe movement of the minors was constraint for a period of\ntime because they lived and were taken care of by foster\nfamilies. They had to attain a legal adult age of 18 years and\nthis is under the U.S. laws. This age-based resettlement had\nconsequences in accrual of social capital. From the findings\nof my dissertation study of the refugee Lost Boys in the\ngreater Kansas City area, minors who started off with little\nsocial capital had advantage over the legal adults in the long\nrun. Minors received not only social and educational support\nfrom foster families, but as time went by, they created strong\nsocial bonds with those foster families that lead some foster\nfamilies treat them as adopted children, thus enjoying the\ncomfort of a real family. Those that were resettled as legal\nadults largely had to fend for themselves; they were provided\nwith apartments rent-free for 3 months and banded together\nto minimize expenses and to provide stability in their new\nenvironment. More so they endured unique hardships, like\ncaring for younger Boys during their exodus and in the refu-\ngee camps in Kenya. Trying to find employment immedi-\nately after resettlement without the benefit and care of foster\nfamilies, acquiring English in a new country was a great\nchallenge especially to those who had no working skills from\nAfrica. Besides all these, the elder Boys felt obligated to\nremind the younger Boys of Sudanese culture, values, and\nways of life, once again fulfilling a sort of parenting role that\nwas critical for the development of normative behavior,\nthough younger Boys differ in their receptivity to retaining\nSudanese culture.\nAs opposed to bonding social capital that is horizontal,\nbridging social capital is vertical, where social networks\noccur between socially heterogeneous groups (Dolfsma &\n1999). Bridging social capital is outward-looking and pro-\nvides for a better linkage to friends and relationships from\nother ethnic/racial groups in society. For Putnam, it is the\nstrength between the segments of society or what he calls\nsible for resettling the Lost Boys believed that dispersing the\nBoys would allow faster integration into American society\n(see Table 1). This is in accordance with the Refugee Act of\nIronically, it turned out separating these Boys did not help\nthem integrate faster; rather it increased their stress level and\nmarginalization in America especially those who were con-\nsidered legal adults. Donkor argues in her study of the Lost\nBoys that lack of proficiency in English for legal adults led\nsome to socialize with fellow refugees as they feared margin-\nalization by the host society (Donkor, 2008). To compensate\nfor deficiency of bridging social capital, they often banded\ntogether in enclave communities to provide for mutual sup-\nport and to minimize expenses in their new environment.\nUnlike those resettled as minors, legal adults were expected\nto successfully secure employment on arrival so that they\ncould support themselves and repay the costs of their airfare\nand other expenses from Africa, and to start the integration\nprocess into the mainstream society with little assistance. To\nget them started, they were provided with apartments rent-\nunlike the legal adults, those who were considered minors\nwere placed in foster families. The foster families served as\ntheir surrogate parents by providing them with all the basic\nneeds (clothes, shelter, and food). The foster families also\nfacilitated their entrance into American learning institutions.\nGoing to school helped minors acquire English language skills\nand integrate them into U.S. culture by participating in school-\nrelated activities and immersion in their home environments.\nThey were in a situation where they could more easily learn\nEnglish. Both at home and in school, they could complete their\neducation in American schools, where they could establish\nsocial networks and friends (an important kind of social capi-\ntal), and they could devote themselves to their studies and\nacquire the kind of skills that would make it possible to\nadvance in school, complete high school, go to college, and in\nsome cases, obtain advanced degrees (Mabeya, 2011).\nApart from bonding and bridging social capital is linking\nsocial capital. Linking social capital refers to unlike people\nin dissimilar situations, such as connections to people with\nauthority/power, whether politically, socially, or economi-\ncally. This enables minority and disadvantaged members to\nleverage access to a wider range of resources than might be\nsocial capital includes vertical connections to formal institu-\ntions. These resources for immigrants and refugees include\nsocial welfare, host agencies, service providers, and other\nessential social services. Religious institutions in the United\nStates, for instance, provided the Lost Boys with support\nthey didn't get from their parents. Coleman argues that par-\nents are an important source of social capital to their children\n(Coleman, 1988). Indeed, nearly all the Lost Boys lacked\nparental guidance and upbringing Therefore, their experi-\nences were shaped by religion which provided them with\nspiritual, social, physical, and material capital (though other\ngovernment agencies provided for their safety, protection,\nand employment). Religious institutions also provided sol-\nace as well as an avenue under which the Lost Boys inter-\nacted with other ethnic and racial groups. Some Boys met\ntheir wives through religious organizations. Therefore par-\nticipating in religious activities gave them the ability to con-\nnect and integrate with a wider population (Mabeya, 2011).\nOther than religious institutions, schools and familial struc-\nture provided a means in which the Lost Boys acquired nec-\nessary social capital needed for integration. Bourdieu argues\nthat schools provide a source of transmission of America's\np. 40-58). After acquiring education in schools, the Lost\nBoys were able to convert the acquired cultural capital into\neconomic capital by securing employment and earning an\nincome. This eventually assisted them into an upward social\nResearch Instruments and Procedure\nThis is a diversity-oriented study in which a multiple case\nstudy model largely provides the methodology for the collec-\ntion of data from participants (Yin, 1994). Eisenhardt asserts\nthat if all or nearly all the variables provide similar results,\nthere exists substantial support for the development of a pre-\nliminary theory describing the phenomena (Eisenhardt, 1989).\nThis study draws from Ager and Strang's demographic\nand cultural/ethnographic criteria in examining key human\ndevelopment indicators to elucidate the degree of social capi-\ntal each Lost Boy participant had acquired since their reset-\nData Analysis\nAfter data collection, an analysis is done employing a the-\nmatic system in which common traits from the data are iden-\ntified.Athematic system is utilized to provide confidentiality\nof individual participants. A multiple case study framework\nis used to analyze 40 cases. Common traits that emerge are\ngiven serious consideration since they reflect major indica-\ntors of integration and/or marginalization as well as the\nimpact of the American society on the participating Lost\nBoys accrual of social capital. The common traits thus\nbecome the major themes of this study. They are as follows:\neducation/professional skills, economic empowerment, and\nnaturalization. These themes are further synthesized using\nthree social capital dimensions: linking, bridging, and bond-\ning social capital (Woolcock, 2003). Eventually after the\nanalysis, a copy was sent to each participant for validation\nand accuracy verification.\nResults: Laying Down the Three Major\nThemes\nInterview data revealed that all participant Lost Boys consis-\ntently possessed similar forms of bonding and bridging capi-\ntal, but varied significantly in linking capital. This can be\nattributed to the amount of social capital each Lost Boy par-\nticipant possessed by the time of this study depending on the\nresettlement criteria (minors verses legal adults).\nEducation/Professional Skills (Bonding\nSocial capital)\nEducation is viewed as crucial to successful living and is\nhighly valued as a cultural capital in the United States, while\nit has been given low priority in countries such as southern\n6 SAGE Open\nSudan. Brophy asserts, \"The education system in Southern\nSudan has always been under resourced\" (Brophy, 2003,\np. 2). The Lost Boys were acutely aware that education was\nthe primary means of securing a good paying job. It remains\none of the most important tools of societal development; it is\nthrough education that individuals and societies achieve eco-\nnomic and social progress (Mabeya, 2011). Collier's investi-\ngation reveals that protracted civil war is concentrated in\npoorly educated countries and regions (Collier, 2000). He\nfound that chances for conflict are drastically reduced in\ncountries where a higher percentage of youth are attending\nschools. Sommers (2002) arrive at similar conclusions,\nobserving that\nit is war that makes the case for providing educational responses\nto the needs of children and youth who are at risk of civil war\nmore than any other circumstance as their education is a vital\nprotection measure from child soldiering. (Sommers, 2002,\nSummary findings \u00b6 6)\nFor the Lost Boys, education was the gateway to a suc-\ncessful life in the United States. The Lost Boys didn't have a\nchance to get educated in Sudan, mainly due to a hostile envi-\nronment and lack of resources. Furthermore, most families\nvalued cattle over education and thus, many participants went\nto the fields to look for grazing land. At the time of the inter-\nviews, all participants in this study were either attending edu-\ncational institutions or had graduated from a 2-year college.\nAcademic qualification was one of the requirements used\nas a criterion for resettlement in the United States. The first\ngroup was comprised of Lost Boys resettled in the United\nStates with some education but not instructed in English while\nthey were in Africa. Acquiring proficiency in the English lan-\nguage is a vital capital in the United States for immigrants. It\ndoesn't only enhance integration but is a necessary tool for\nsecuring a job. With the help of resettlement agencies, this\ngroup was placed in foster care and enrolled in schools as they\nwere identified as minors according to U.S. laws. The second\ngroup arrived in the United States without any English lan-\nguage skills but was expected to work upon arrival in the\nUnited States because they were considered to be legal adults\nunder the U.S. law. The third group consists of Lost Boys who\narrived in the United States with elementary or high school\neducation. While very few participants attended school in\nSudan, all the participants in the third group received some\neducation at refugee camps in Ethiopia or Kenya where they\nstudied Arabic or English, respectively. Once resettled in the\nUnited States, some in this group pursued further education\nwhile others looked for jobs and began working.\nThe First Group\nEight participants were classified as minors upon their arrival\nin the United States and were subsequently placed in foster\ncare. Five out of the eight had acquired some form of education\nin the refugee camps in Africa. More so, residing with foster\nfamilies gave them an early opportunity improving their pro-\nficiency in English. Foster families also assisted them in pay-\ning tuition, provided housing, and helped them with other\ndaily living expenses. The following participant stunned me\nwith his level of language proficiency:\nI did get support from foster families, yes I did. They would take\nme to school; take me to my ummm . . . ,like if I had to run they\nwould come and pick me up or drop me off until I had my car.\nAnd they actually gave me my third car, it was a Chevy Malibu\n`98. It was a very nice car and they paid for it till it was done. I\nam now independent . . . it's not like I need help from them\nanymore. I'm living on my own. (Mabeya, 2011)\nThe Second Group\nEight participants in this study, considered legal adults, had\nnot acquired English language skills prior to resettling in the\nUnited States. This group of Lost Boys went through the\nrefugee camps in Egypt and was instructed solely in Arabic.\nThis group faced great challenges in trying to learn English,\nobtaining work, and integrating with Americans and other\nAfrican immigrants because they didn't share a common lan-\nguage. They felt isolated from the rest of mainstream\nAmerican society. Moreover, this group found it difficult to\nintegrate with other African immigrants without a common\nAfrican language with which to communicate. According to\naUnitedNationsEducationalScientificCulturalOrganization\n(UNESCO) study on \"Linguistic Diversity\" published by\nUNESCOPRESS, there are approximately 1,400 dialects in\nAt the time of this study, nearly all the Lost Boys lacking\nsignificant proficiency in English were enrolled in English as\na Second Language (ESL) courses in Kansas City. With\nsome hard work in their studies with the English language,\nthey hoped not only to communicate with Americans, but\nalso with other nationalities present in the United States.\nFrom my observations and listening, the following partici-\npant described great challenges of speaking English\nproficiently:\nYea, it is difficult to get job because people from Kansas don't\ntrust you. Some people, they don't need somebody who don't\nknow English. That one is difficult. They are good people but\nproblem is English. You don't know how to speak good English,\nyou don't want to write good English, some people don't trust\nThe Third Group\nTwenty-four participants, considered legal adults, went\nthrough the Kenyan refugee camps of Kakuma and had\nreceived English instruction in both elementary and high\nschool subjects. This group of Lost Boys joined institutions of\nhigher learning in Kansas City after resettling in the United\nStates. Some of them have graduated from a 2-year program\nof study and were working, although they looked forward to\nfurthering their education as one participant explained:\nYou know what, whenever you have a higher level of education,\nit is almost guaranteed will have good living standards, having a\nhouse or raising a family, helping those back home. This is the\nimportant things that come with having high education level.\nThat is how I look at it. (Mabeya, 2011)\nEconomic Empowerment (Bridging\nSocial Capital)\nFor the Lost Boys and other similar groups of refugees, eco-\nnomic empowerment can only be attained through employ-\nment. Securing a job for most foreigners in the United States\nrequires complex networking with Americans and estab-\nlished foreigners living in the United States. According to\nHalpern's report prepared for the U.S. Department of Health\nand Human Services (see also U.S. RefugeeAct of 1980), eco-\nnomic self-sufficiency is very important for successful reset-\ntlementofrefugees(Halpern,2008).Economicself-sufficiency\nis defined as the total earnings of a family that enables it to\nsupport itself without external financial assistance according\nto federal regulation (Halpern, 2008). McKinnon argued that\nthe resettlement program for the Lost Boys in the United\nStates was one of the most successful ever in U.S. history,\ngiven that nearly all the Boys of legal age were employed after\nresettlement (McKinnon, 2008). The ORR published the\nemployment percentage of the Lost Boys at 85%, whereas that\nrate was 55% for other refugees in the United States in 2003\n(ORR, 2014). Moreover, the ORR report found economic\nopportunity, language, and education to be important in eco-\nnomic self-sufficiency (ORR, 2007). A study done by Potocky\nand McDonald identified the length of residence, citizenship,\nand secondary migration to be closely related to economic\nself-sufficiency (Potocky & McDonald, 1995). However,\nsome legal adult Lost Boys with minimal or no professional\nskills found mainly manual jobs with low wages that were\nunattractive and difficult to sustain. This affected the Boy's\nability to financially support themselves and attend college.\nThis section categorizes the participant refugee Lost Boys\ninto four groups relative to the major theme of employment.\nParticipants in the first group were resettled as minors, were\nlegally barred from working and instead were placed in foster\ncare and taken to American schools. The second group was\ncomprised of Boys who were considered young adults upon\narrival. The third group arrived in America with some skills\nand education accrued in Africa. The fourth group acquired\nemployment experience and skills only after arrival in the U.S.\nThe First Group\nDue to their young ages and scarcity of employment oppor-\ntunities, 10 participants didn't work in Africa. Although they\nwere sent out to the fields to look after family cattle, this\nwasn't generally considered a job, rather it was viewed as an\nobligation to the family and these children were not paid.\nThis group of Lost Boys resettled in the United States under\nthe legal care of foster families. These families received\nassistance from the government and other refugee agencies\nin support of resettlement programs including financial and\nfood assistance, as well as tax breaks from state and federal\ngovernment. These Boys weren't allowed to work in the\nUnited States because they were considered minors accord-\ning to U.S. laws. However, they attended school prior to\nattaining working age. At the time of this research, all Boys\nin this category had become young adults, moved out of their\nrespective foster family homes, and were living on their own\nor with other Lost Boys. One participant said,\nWhen I first came to the U.S., I was placed in a foster family in\nCalifornia. I was told I was a minor by resettlement agencies. I\ndid not know my really age though they said my age was thirteen\nyears. The foster family took care of me. They paid for my\nschool. They were nice people. They let me play with their\nchildren. They bought me clothes, books, and food. I really felt\nat home. When I become nineteen years, they assisted me to get\na job. I got a job in a store and wanted to start living alone. So I\nlooked for my own house and moved out. Live in California was\ntoo expensive and so I had to relocate to Kansas City where I\nhave friends and life here isn't very expensive. (Mabeya, 2011)\nThe Second Group\nThis group of eight Lost Boys were young adults when they\narrived in the United States. They were required to start\nworking immediately after resettlement; however, most of\nthem possessed no working skills prior to their arrival as they\nlacked the opportunity to go to school in Africa. For those\nwho managed to attend school, they were handicapped as\nthey were instructed solely in Arabic in Egypt and spoke no\nEnglish. This group had difficulty obtaining employment\nbecause they lacked work experience and English language\nproficiency. As a result, most of them could only secure tem-\nporary jobs as manual laborers. One participant said,\nI don't have a job in Africa. I did not go to school in Africa. I\nonly took care of my family cattle. My parents had a lot of cattle.\nI think the number was one to seven thousand. My grandfather\ngave my dad a lot of them before he died. I like cattle a lot. Now\nthat I am in the U.S., I have to be on my own. I have to pay my\nbills. I have to go to school and pay tuition. Man, it is a lot\ndifficult here. I can't get a nice paying job because I don't speak\ngood English. But one day when I speak good English I will get\nThe Third Group\nThis group of 10 participants possessed some education and\nworking skills accrued in Africa. McKinnon would identify the\nresettlement of the third group of participants as \"successful\"\n8 SAGE Open\nbecause they secured employment and enrolled in post-\nsecondary educational programs (McKinnon, 2008).\nAlthough their English wasn't perfect, they were able to learn\nAmerican English, and as a result employers were ready to\nhire them. Some had work experience from their days inAfrica.\nIn addition, this group received educational instruction in the\nKenyan refugee camps, where English was a part of the cur-\nriculum. It was easy for participants in this group to fill out an\napplication for employment on their own. Some of them had\nalready earned 2-year degrees and were working. One partici-\npant described his work experience in Africa and in the United\nStates in the following way (translation is word for word):\nIn the U.S. it is difficulty here. You don't have job, that one is\ndifficult because no friends to go to live with. People don't do that\nhere because you can work and go to school and you go to do\nsomething good.You don't have job, that one is difficult. InAfrica,\nyou don't have job, it is good because some people don't care\nabout money. Your friends, your uncles, your aunties can help you.\nYou know. You eat food free, you sleep free. You know. That one\nis different here. It is a nice place. Everything is good. But if you\ndon't have help, it is difficult. We agree. I don't have English to\nwrite application because somebody is busy and don't have time to\nfill my application. I don't have to do anything. (Mabeya, 2011)\nThe Fourth Group\nThis group of 14 participants didn't have work experience in\nAfrica. Most of them went to school in Kenyan refugee\ncamps, though they lacked work experience as job opportuni-\nties in refugee camps were limited. This group acquired\nworking skills in the United States only after they arrived.\nThis group did not have a lot of problems getting simple man-\nual jobs because they could speak English and most of them\nreceived on-site job training. Six of these participants worked\nin nursing homes and were already trained as certified nurs-\ning assistants (CNA). Here is what one participant said,\nI did my high school in Kenya in the refugee camp of Kakuma.\nWhen I arrived in the U.S., I was advised that it was easy to get\na good paying job at a nursing home but I had to have some\ntraining. So I took a three month course and graduated as a CNA.\nIt was not hard for me to get a job because they need people to\nwork in nursing homes. Many Americans don't like doing this\njob. I like it and it pays so well. (Mabeya, 2011)\nNaturalization (Linking Social Capital)\nAfter attaining the required federal residency period in the\nUnited States, most of the refugee Lost Boys managed to\nobtain U.S. citizenship by naturalization. The Fourteenth\nAmendment of the U.S. Constitution provides the legal frame-\nwork for individuals of foreign countries to be naturalized in\nthe United States. The Refugee Act of 1980 allows refugees to\nbe accepted into the United States on humanitarian grounds for\nunlimited stay so long as the countries of origin were still in\nconflict. Refugees accepted into the United States can change\ntheir status to permanent residents after physically living in\nthe United States for 1 year (Congressional Report, June\n1997). Permanent residents are allowed to reside in the\nUnited States for an unlimited period of time, and after 5\nyears, permanent residents can further change their status to\nbecome fully naturalized citizens. For the Lost Boys, becom-\ning a naturalized American citizen was important because this\nallowed acceptance and integration into mainstreamAmerican\nsociety. It also provided them with access to important privi-\nleges accorded to American citizens, like traveling freely in\nand out of the United States, bringing their families to the\nUnited States, claiming unemployment benefits if they lost\ntheir jobs, access to student loans, and getting federal jobs like\njoining the military.\nIn this section I will categorize the participant refugee\nLost Boys into three groups. The first group consists of those\nwho had not become American citizens. The second group is\nthose who had become U.S. permanent residents. The third\ngroup is naturalized citizens.\nThe First Group\nFifteen participants had not become U.S. permanent resi-\ndents or citizens, and they cited different reasons as to why\nthey hadn't done so. Among some of the reasons they gave\nwere the costs of processing the application to change their sta-\ntus. Some said it was not their first priority because no one\nforced them to leave, while others said they had not met the\nrequired stay period for them to change status. However, every-\none in this group indicated that they were eager to change their\nstatus in due time. They were aware of the benefits of becom-\ning a permanent resident or U.S. citizen. All participants in this\ngroup were resettled as minors. One participant said,\nI would have been long time ago but I was not able because I had\na lot of financial problems. However I would like to become a\ncitizen so that I can be able to fly to Africa and other places in\nthe world. I don't want to go to Africa and then get stuck over\nthere. I don't want to struggle coming back. I need to get my\ncitizenship so that I can be a free man. (Mabeya, 2011)\nThese participants said they had not visited Africa because\nthey were afraid they would be prevented from re-entering\nthe United States. They heard from others who lived in the\nUnited States for a long time that their visas were not renewed\nand they were barred from America after visiting family in\nAfrica. So, citizenship could guarantee their ability to travel\nfreely to and from Africa, and to obtain other benefits, such\nas bringing their families to the United States.\nThe Second Group:\nComposed of 15 participants, this group already successfully\napplied for and became permanent U.S. residents. They said\nlife for them was a bit easier than when they were just refugees.\nThey could get student loans, travel in and out of the United\nStates, but they could not vote.\nMan you need to understand what being a U.S. permanent\nresident is. Are you one or are you a citizen? Being a permanent\nresident is different from being a refugee. Refugees are treated\nlike not really human beings. Now that I am a permanent resident\nI can do a lot of things like travelling in and out of the U.S., I can\nalso claim unemployment if I don't have a job. I don't care if I\ndon't vote because I don't like politics after all. (Mabeya, 2011)\nThe Third Group\nThis group had 10 participants who had become U.S. citi-\nzens. They looked more relaxed and talked more freely than\nother Lost Boys. They said they considered themselves like\nany other American. Among other things, they cited they\ncould vote in federal elections like any American. One par-\nticipant had the following to say:\nWhen I was living in Kakuma, there are those Americans who\nwere working in the refugee camps. They were so proud of\nthemselves. They put on everything American. I just felt like a\nvery low class person as compared to them. Now that I am an\nAmerican, when I travel to Africa, my friends in the refugee\ncamps are jealous of me. I told them I am an American and I\nshowed them an American passport (smile). (Mabeya, 2011)\nNearly all participants said they intended to stay in the United\nStates for a long time after becoming U.S. citizens, though\nmany of them said they were willing to go to Africa to visit\nfamily and friends. Some were reluctant to answer this ques-\ntion. One said,\nThat is the same question senator Sam Brownback asked me\nwhen I met him 2007. I don't know how long I will stay here but\nat some time in my life I will go back to Sudan. For now I am\nWhat I found from these participants is that most of them did\nnot care much about the responsibilities that went with\nAmerican citizenship. Most of them said they did not want to\nserve in the jury, serve in the military, or vote. This participant\nsummarized and said what he looked forward to by saying,\nI did not become an American citizen by coming here to charge\nAmericans. Americans gave me a chance to come over and live\nwith them. That is why they gave me citizenship. I am proud of\nthat. I am not going to send Americans to jail. That is the work\nof Americans who were born here. I don't even understand some\nof theAmerican crimes. I also won't want to serve in the military.\nI run from war and I did not come here to go to war nor do I want\nto vote. I don't like politics at all. I just want a quiet life. Build\nAnalysis\nResearch in this study identifies advantages and challenges\nassociated with arbitrarily assigning resettlement ages to\neach of the Lost Boys and accrual of individual social capital\nover 10 years. One of the most significant findings of this\nstudy was that defining \"experience\" as a function of\nassigned age proved problematic for most of the Boys;\nyounger Boys did not enter the job market at a \"low\" level.\nLegal adults had started earning an income from unskilled\nlow paying jobs, to the envy of minors who were not allowed\nto work at the time of their resettlement. Interestingly, one\ncan discern from this study how much more social capital is\npossessed by Lost Boys who were resettled as minors more\nthan a decade ago.\nAs time went by, there is a reverse trend in terms of acqui-\nsition of social capital by the younger Boys. The minors\nplaced under foster families' became dependents, but ended\nup having a better opportunity of acquiring English lan-\nguage. They were also placed in schools where they social-\nized with American children, established social networks,\nand built friendships. This helped them greatly improve their\nEnglish language skills, gave them the opportunity to acquire\nimportant kinds of social capital, and provided structure for\nimmersion into American culture. Eventually, these Boys\nstarted to lose the social capital that they had brought with\nthem from Africa and acquired social capital of the American\nsociety. They learned new cultural values of their new coun-\ntry as they settled and became Americanized. The ones who\nwent to school found that the social capital they brought with\nthem was not really valued by Americans and was insuffi-\ncient at best (Donkor, 2008). In American schools, they\nlearned to discard (what might be considered in America)\nlow-value capital (working as groups, holding hands, and\nforehead cuttings--that is highly valued in South Sudan) and\nreplaced it with higher-valued capital of the kind esteemed\nby educators, employers, and American society such as\nworking individually, keeping time, being efficient, and\nbecoming successful. Their degree of social capital accrual\nthus can be measured by the extent to which they were able\nto discard the values of their homeland and adopt American\nvalues. In this case, they increased their stock of American\nsocial capital, which made them more likely to integrate into\nU.S. society (Donkor, 2008). For instance, in schools they\nwere told how important it was to shake hands with the peo-\nple they met in interviews. They were told they could be\nfired for uncleanliness, if they had body odor, or missed\nwork as time is important in America. Some companies fired\nrefugees because of body odor, thus they were advised to use\ndeodorant daily. They were also told to learn to speak good\nEnglish and to work hard (Mabeya, 2011).\nBecause they became proficient in English, this group of\nBoys easily obtained better jobs after completing their col-\nlege education. Some were even in supervisory positions,\nmanaging American citizens working under them. For\ninstance, three participants joined the military and were\ntraining as officer cadets by the time of this study. After com-\npletion of their cadet training, they were expected to be mili-\ntary officers in rank. In athletics, Lopez Lomong, one of the\nLost Boys though not a participant in this study, was chosen\nas the U.S. flag bearer of the U.S. Olympics team in China\n(Hersh, 2008). Some participants in this study like Lomong\nhad joined college football and basketball teams as their\nphysical height is advantageous in competitive sports.\nUnfortunately, those Boys who were resettled as legal\nadults were immediately placed to work. This group of Boys\nseemed to struggle with balancing work and getting an edu-\ncation. Through their experiences and my observations, they\nhad few opportunities to go to pursue a degree, or become\nproficient in English. Legal adults largely had to fend for\nthemselves, thus reducing their chances of increasing their\nsocial capital in the new host society; they were provided with\napartments rent-free for 3 months but started to pay rent\nthereafter. This forced most of them to band together in\nenclave communities to provide mutual support to minimize\nexpenses to provide stability in their new environment. This\ngreatly hindered their ability to learn the English language as\nthey socialized only with fellow refugees rather than\nAmericans. They feared marginalization by the host society\n(Mabeya, 2011). Donkor, in her study of the Lost Boys,\nargued that those Lost Boys living in ethnic enclaves were\nless assimilated intoAmerican society because of difficulty in\ndeveloping social networks that included American citizens\n(Donkor, 2008). In other words, they lacked social capital.\nConcluding Remarks\nThis study examined the accrual of social capital of the\nSudanese refugee Lost Boys before and after their resettle-\nment in 2000 in the Kansas City area. What emerged out of\nthe age-based resettlement arrangement of the Lost Boys\nreveals that those considered minors and placed in foster\nfamilies eventually became better integrated socially because\nthose foster families became their surrogate families thus\nproviding them with bonding social capital. For instance,\nminors received social and educational support from the fos-\nter families, though they were behind relative to employment\nwhen compared with the Boys settled as adults. Those Boys\nsettled as legal adults' endured hardships, like trying to find\nemployment immediately after resettlement without the ben-\nefit and care of foster families, and acquiring English lan-\nguage proficiency in a new country that would have provided\nthem with bridging social capital. This made it extremely\ndifficult to secure employment because they lacked skills\nand/or were not proficient in English upon arrival, thus mak-\ning it difficult to acquire economic empowerment. Therefore,\nas stated earlier, \"experience\" defined by age was a handicap\nonce the amount of social capital of the participants of this\nstudy was analyzed. It was interesting from this study to find\nout how much extra social capital was possessed by Lost\nBoys resettled as minors relative to those resettled as adults,\nespecially given the fact that all of these Boys are now legal\nadults living in the United States. Thus, resettlement by age\ncontributed greatly to accrual of social capital for those reset-\ntled as minors and a barrier for those resettled as legal adults.\nThe legal adults had the disadvantage of having to start\nworking immediately, which impeded their integration into\nAmerican society. Unlike the minors, they had no support\nfrom foster families and were unable to attend school imme-\ndiately after resettling. In this case, the Lost Boys, though\nresettled at nearly the same time in the United States, had a\nwide range of accrual of social capital and integration experi-\nences. However, one important aspect is that both groups\nbenefitted from support given to them by the federal and\nstate governments, church-based communities, and organi-\nzations. This provided them with necessary linking social\ncapital that they needed to facilitate their integration process.\nAcquiring American citizenship/naturalization allowed the\nLost Boys access to federal resources that are not easily\navailable to other un-naturalized immigrants or refugees.\n"
