This panoply of approaches can\nappear foreign, challenging, and impenetrable, especially to\ninexperienced qualitative researchers. As a category label,\nqualitative research lends some stability to this quasi-chaotic\nsituation. However, differences between the approaches can\nstill make qualitative research amorphous. Qualitative\nresearchers tend therefore to struggle to typify its attributes\nwithout resorting to oversimplifications. Some authors (e.g.,\nSale, Lohfeld, & Brazil, 2002) do not acknowledge this\nproblem. Others such as Punch (2005) argue for starting with\nsimplified definitions of qualitative research, including state-\nments, in introductory research textbooks, about what quali-\ntative research is not. For example, Punch (2005) states that\n\"qualitative research is empirical research where the data are\nnot in the form of numbers\" (p. 3) and other authors suggest\nthat qualitative research is \"a not so-descriptive adjective\"\n(Schwandt, 2001) of research that \"produces findings not\narrived at by statistical procedures or other means of quanti-\nthere are textbooks that speak to the variety of approaches\nand traditions on which qualitative research draws in\ndisciplines such as health care (Grbich, 1999). Alternatively,\nauthors may typify this research loosely--for example, as\nnatural, inductive, and people-centered (e.g., Bogdan &\nBiklen, 2007)--which further risks distorting its inherent\ncomplexity. The result can be to confuse novice qualitative\nresearchers or generate broadly held misunderstandings.\nCritics may rejoin that this stereotyping of textbook accounts\nof qualitative research exacerbates continuing misunder-\nstanding and mistrust of qualitative research. However, I\nbelieve that it highlights an unmet need to typify this research\nin nuanced ways, a need exposing confusion over the mean-\ning of \"typical.\"\nTo answer this confusion, I wish to draw on ideas of the\nGerman philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein (1953) and sug-\ngest that qualitative research has no essential nature--no\nclear set of one or more predefining attributes that individu-\nally must always be present. Instead, qualitative research\nderives meaning from its use to convey attributes whose\n1University of Auckland, New Zealand\nCorresponding Author:\nStephen Buetow, Associate Professor, Department of General Practice\nand Primary Health Care, University of Auckland, Private Bag 92019,\nAuckland Mail Centre, Auckland 1142, New Zealand.\nEmail: s.buetow@auckland.ac.nz\nHow Can a Family Resemblances\nApproach Help to Typify Qualitative\nResearch?

As Wittgenstein (1953) explains,\n\"The [meaning and] strength of the thread [signifying here\nthe categorization of qualitative research] does not reside in\nthe fact that some one fiber runs through its whole length, but\nin the overlapping of many fibers\" (p. 32a). No feature,\ntherefore, needs to be common to all qualitative research.\nInstead, we require only a \"network of similarities overlap-\n\"Typical\" fibers are those that suffice for the fabric of quali-\ntative research to hold. Rosch's (1981) prototype theory fur-\nther recognizes that some fibers or family resemblances may\nbe better than others at serving this function.\nThis article draws on these ideas to typify qualitative\nresearch on the basis of overlapping attributes in five related\ndomains: philosophy and theory, purpose, approach to rea-\nsoning, data collection, and use of numbers. In each domain,\nan italicized typification of qualitative research highlights\nprototypical features for the sake of being simple and clear\nwithout over-sacrificing complexity (Mosenthal, 1986). This\ntypification dwells within a larger discussion of domain fea-\ntures that are overlapping but not necessarily universal--fea-\ntures that the current approach to defining qualitative\nresearch can miss by assuming \"that there are universal fea-\ntures of all forms of qualitative research,\" not merely spe-\ncific ones (Dixon-Woods, Shaw, Argarwal, & Smith, 2004,\nMost qualitative research textbooks similarly start by\ndescribing standard features of qualitative research within\nspecific methodological design options (e.g., Creswell,\n2003), research perspectives (e.g., Flick, Von Kardorff, &\nSteinke, 2004), or paradigmatic approaches (e.g., Lincoln &\nGuba, 1985). In contrast, a family resemblances approach\ncan typify qualitative research by producing a single clear\nimage of sufficient overlapping features that typify this\nresearch more comprehensively than does the requirement\nfor all features to be present within the individual domains.\nFamily resemblances still privilege common features--and\ntherefore a post-positivist conceptualization of qualitative\nresearch--and can overlook differences that question salient\npatterns and facilitate theory building. However, reference to\nprototypes gives weight to the importance of features of the\ntypification. And, like a wide-brim umbrella, the typification\ngives shelter to diverse features, can be constantly checked,\nand can oversee an evolving pedagogy and curriculum for\nteaching qualitative research.\nPhilosophy and Theory\nSome researchers mix qualitative (and quantitative) methods\nto address their research question (Creswell, 2003)--which\nmay seek to solve a problem in the real world or widen\ninsights into, and understanding of, a complex issue--and\nincrease confidence in their research findings (O'Cathain,\napproach to bridging differences that can be important in\npractice, but want to suggest that philosophical differences,\neven between quantitative research and qualitative research,\nare frequently overstated in degree and importance.\nOverlapping the different types of qualitative research (and\nquantitative research) are important similarities in philoso-\nphy and theory, which too often go unrecognized.\nI contend that the different types of qualitative research\nare similar and their underlying philosophical differences\ntend to be unimportant or exaggerated. Qualitative research\ndraws on highly abstract, global, and non-testable theories\ncalled meta-theories, such as post-positivism, social con-\nstructionism, and pragmatism, which are much more similar\nto each other than is typically acknowledged. Post-positivist\nresearchers believe in the existence of an objective, material\nreality beyond the mind and language. However, as Burr\n(2003) admits, so too do most of the relativists among the\npragmatists and social constructionists, just as \"most realists\nacknowledge the power of language to construct the world in\nsome respects\" (p. 88). The differences between these groups\ncan be subtle. A key difference between their respective\napproaches is that social constructionists and pragmatists,\nunlike post-positivists, tend to avoid or at least de-emphasize\nthe question of reality per se.\nPragmatists replace the distinction between appearance\nand reality with one between more and less useful descrip-\ntions. The value of these descriptions derives from their use-\nfulness not as mirrors but as tools for producing things that\npeople want. For pragmatists such as Putnam ), the tools are\n(usefully) answerable to an objective reality, whereas other\npragmatists, such as Rorty, reduce reality to agreement\nresemble social constructionists, who, doubting that the real-\nity of an external world can be directly known, do not con-\ncern themselves with its nature. Instead, they seek consensus\non what can be apprehended through discourse--as lan-\nguage-in-use--in a given, historical and cultural context. In\ncommon with the pragmatists, they acknowledge that \"lan-\nguage can be used to refer to reality for practical purposes\"\n(Burr, 2003, p. 93). For example, most social constructionists\naccept that high blood pressure exists, but point out that once\nwe discuss it, it becomes the social construct of hyperten-\nsion, which is useful as well as real on the basis of the con-\ntext-bound, arbitrary thresholds delimiting hypertension\nfrom normotensive blood pressure. Post-positivists agree\nthat the world is open to interpretation, that incomplete\nunderstanding of this world varies between people, and that\nlanguage contributes to this variation. Yet, for them, knowl-\nedge of the world and its positive use depend less on how\ndiscourse constructs the world than on how reality is tenta-\ntively understood. They reject any pragmatist premise that\ntruth necessarily depends on \"what works.\"\nThe notion that qualitative research is more value-laden\nand subjective than \"objective\" quantitative research is\nsimilarly too simple. Values permeate both types of research\nat all stages, including the assumptions made, questions\nposed, methods used, what the research expects to find, and\nhow findings are recognized and then interpreted for mean-\ning, explanation, publication, and other use. All qualitative\nresearch and quantitative research therefore incorporate sub-\njective acts. Qualitative researchers, however, most openly\nacknowledge this fact; distrust claims that objectivity makes\nthem passive recipients of external information; and reflect\non how their values influence their research and its objectiv-\nity. However, this self-awareness and self-reflection, among\nother things, can enhance their objective comprehension of,\nand ability to manage, the influence of their own subjective\nexperience (Ratner, 2002). For all these reasons, I de-empha-\nsize philosophical differences between types of qualitative\nresearch (and even between quantitative research and quali-\ntative research).\nPurpose\nFrom recognizing all research as value-laden, and de-stabi-\nlizing the opposition in qualitative research between what is\nsocially constructed and what is real, I now wish to suggest\nthat qualitative research seeks most importantly to generate\nrich data, typically from small samples. This research tends\nto be exploratory, although it can also test, seek to confirm,\nand generate ideas. Reasons for qualitative research seeking\nto produce rich data include, but do not depend on, a search\nfor in-depth understanding of lived experiences and beliefs,\nideally in a natural setting (Lincoln & Guba, 1985). However,\nmost qualitative research is not naturalistic--the formal\nqualitative interview, the most common method of qualita-\ntive data collecting, produces non-naturally occurring talk\n(Murphy & Dingwall, 2003)--and understanding is not\nalways the key purpose of qualitative research. Just as impor-\ntant may be instrumental, emancipatory, and symbolic uses\nAll these uses depend on qualitative data whose richness\nderives from their contextual depth, is feasible to achieve in\nsmall samples, and speaks to the value of generalizations\nbeyond specific settings (Payne & Williams, 2005). Given\nthe smallness and selected nature of these samples, some\nsocial constructionists minimize or deny the need to general-\nize from one set of circumstances in qualitative research to\nanother (Payne & Williams, 2005). Indeed, a challenge has\nbeen mounted to \"the possibility of generalizability in any\ntype of research, be it qualitative or quantitative . . . because\nfindings are always embedded within a context\" (Polit &\ngeneralization is overrated as a source of scientific progress\n(Flyvbjerg, 2006). However, increasing demand for general-\nizable and useful knowledge comes from qualitative\nresearchers who view the generalization of qualitative\nresearch as both possible and important. From the perspec-\ntive that \"generalization is a matter of degree, rather than a\nknowledge can be generalized from one or a small number of\ncases, to all instances similar to those studied (Ayres,\nKavanagh, & Knafl, 2013). A family resemblances approach\naccommodates the capability of qualitative research to have\na purpose of generating data that may be generalizable.\nThree modes of generalization elaborate on this purpose\n(Lewis & Ritchie, 2003). First, \"representational generaliza-\ntion\" addresses in qualitative research the question of\nwhether sample findings can represent the phenomenon of\ninterest and on that basis be generalized to a target popula-\ntion. The second mode is the \"theoretical generalization\" of\ngeneral principles and conditions that make different experi-\nences possible. It can include a need to revise or reject a\nproposition when even one observation does not fit the\ndeveloping schema. The third mode is \"inferential general-\nization\" of sets of patterns; sometimes also referred to as\nnaturalistic generalization (Stake, 1995), transferability\n(Lincoln & Guba, 1985), case-to-case translation (Firestone,\nenable readers to have the detailed descriptions they need to\nassess whether empirical findings can be generalized beyond\nthe sample setting. In summary, unifying the different types\nof qualitative research is the aim of constructing rich data,\ntypically from small samples, which often can be generalized\nin different ways.\nApproach to Reasoning\nThe source of all three of the modes of generalization from\nqualitative research is analysis rather than probability, and\nlogical inference rather than statistical inference (Mitchell,\n1983). Purposefully selected qualitative samples are appro-\npriately typified as not amenable to generalization on a sta-\ntistical basis, yet even quantitative research seldom meets the\nassumptions of the statistical inference procedures it never-\ntheless over-applies; many quantitative studies start from the\nsample rather than the population and do not sample ran-\ndomly or achieve random or representative samples (Polit &\nBeck, 2010). Logical inference for generalization entails a\nform of induction. However, inductive reasoning can also\ncontribute to analogy and concept formation outside the\ndomain of generalization (Tsang & Williams, 2013).\nWidely typified as being mainly inductive, qualitative\nresearch includes bottom-up reasoning from specific obser-\nvations to identify patterns and generate concepts, hypothe-\nses, and theory. This typification is clearest when approaches\nto qualitative data analysis (QDA) are explicitly labeled as\ninductive, for example, by Thomas (2006). However,\nalthough mainly inductive, the practice of qualitative\nresearch typically demonstrates a recursive cycle of analogi-\ncal, inductive, and deductive reasoning (Bendassolli, 2013).\nThis cycle lessens differences between qualitative research\nand quantitative research, the latter being typically misrepre-\nsented as merely deductive.\n4 SAGE Open\nAnalogical reasoning involves the logic of comparison\nand contrast. For example, inferential generalization requires\nresearchers to generate thick descriptions of local particulars\nto give readers of their research sufficient information to\ncompare the similarity of their own case setting against the\nsetting described by the research. This comparison involves\nreaders in reasoning whether, on balance, these situations are\nalike enough on a large number of relevant attributes to war-\nrant an empirical, intuitive type of inferential generalization.\nTheoretical generalization may similarly invoke analogical\nreasoning, but here the researcher explicates a theory, which\nis likely supported by analogy (Rossman & Yore, 2009).\nAnalogical reasoning may draw on inductive reasoning or\ngenerate arguments that are deductively valid.\nDeductive reasoning--from a pre-existing framework\nthat entails its conclusions--is actually common in qualita-\ntive research. It is evident in several ways. Pre-existing\nresearch and orienting concepts or theory are likely to sensi-\ntize the researcher to a problem requiring investigation. It\ncan also give focus to the study objectives. Qualitative\nresearch seldom realizes Scriven's (1991) \"goal free\" ideal\nof evaluating only actual effects against demonstrated needs\n(p. 56). Indeed, the so-called framework approach to QDA\nwas developed for policy-relevant research in which the\nstudy objectives are structured explicitly and transparently in\nadvance to satisfy funding requirements (Ritchie & Spencer,\nConspicuously here, but also in qualitative research in\ngeneral, the study objectives stated and any existing frame-\nwork will guide the collection and analysis of data, a priori\nby informing the identification of relevant study domains\nand incipient coding categories (MacFarlane & O'Reilly-de\nBr\u00fan, 2012). Although typically noted to generate rather than\ntest prior hypotheses (Thomas, 2006), most qualitative\nresearch is iterative, non-linear and seeks deductively to\nrefine and confirm the early ideas and patterns that it identi-\nfies (inductively) from the study data. Because induction can\nlead to false conclusions, these processes include looking for\ndisconfirming (or deviant) cases that do not fit the patterns\nthat the researcher finds. Disconfirming cases that are found\nare drawn upon analogically to hone meanings of the pat-\nterns and themes in the context of rival explanations. Themes\nand new theoretical ideas are also checked against pre-exist-\ning knowledge (Rudnick, 2014). Less generally, deductive\nreasoning is apparent in qualitative approaches such as Yin's\n(1994) case study method and pattern-matching (Hyde,\n2000). These approaches state theoretical propositions before\ndata gathering commences or, in the case of analytic induc-\ntion, from the first case or early cases. They then test the\npropositions, their premises, or both. This testing involves\ndeducing expected consequences and comparing them with\nwhat the data show. When the data describe one observed\ncase, a general rule may be reasoned to best account for that\ncase. This (abductive) reasoning from a single case is a spe-\ncial form of induction. Meanwhile, other approaches, such as\nreplication case study designs and \"hold-out\" samples, fur-\nther formalize the use of deductive testing procedures. Hold-\nout samples denote data archived to test propositions\ndeveloped through early data analysis (Hyde, 2000).\nDeduction is even evident in highly inductive approaches\nsuch as classic grounded theory, where \"deduction and veri-\nfication are the servants of emergence\" (Heath & Crowley,\nits inductive elements, Strauss and Corbin perpetuate the\nmyth in their own version of grounded theory--QDA--that\ntheory can \"emerge from the data\" (Strauss & Corbin, 1998,\np. 12). Seldom can researchers initially and temporarily put\naside their prior knowledge, beliefs, and full range of every-\nday, conscious experience; keep an open mind; and let data\nspeak for themselves. Indeed, QDA emphasizes deductive\nreasoning by using predetermined categories (such as condi-\ntions, context, and consequences) to cluster open codes (that\ncan be integrated with a core category to produce a theory).\nOver time, however, QDA has become more inductive by\nrequiring ongoing data comparisons to facilitate the develop-\nment of theory.\nData Collection\nHaving suggested why qualitative research is mainly induc-\ntive but also tends to involve analogical and deductive rea-\nsoning, I now want to consider the collection of data around\nwhich such reasoning takes place. There is a tendency to\ntypify qualitative data collection as involving naturalistic\nobservation and semi-structured or unstructured interviews\nthat pose open questions as part of a dialogue. This dialogue\nis more than \"a tool of inquiry . . . [and signifies] a wholly\nengaged encounter\" that aims to be caring, democratic,\nand--by giving voice to interviewees--emancipatory (Kuntz\ntaught to avoid \"problematic\" interviewing practices such as\nasking closed--and, in particular, leading--questions (Ezzy,\nHowever, these generalizations oversimplify qualitative\ninterviewing. Qualitative interviews are not power-free\nmeetings of equals. They are hierarchical interactions that\nhave latent potential for manipulation and exploitation\n(Kvale, 2006). Like a \"Trojan horse,\" they can be used to\ncreate trust, get behind interviewees' defense walls, and con-\ntrol the interview. In these terms, qualitative interviews are\nconversations, rather than open dialogues, purposefully con-\nducted to satisfy the research interest of the interviewer in\nuncovering or constructing how the interviewee understands\nand makes sense of their private life world. How the inter-\nview data are collected, interpreted, and reported remains\nlargely outside the control of the interviewee (Kvale, 2006).\nResearchers should not appropriate knowledge without\ngiving value back to participants--for example, by asking\nthem questions they want to be asked and listening actively\nto the answers. Nevertheless, closed questions can fit the\npurpose of qualitative interviews. Even though formal quali-\ntative interviews are not naturalistic, the use of closed ques-\ntions mirrors habitual aspects of everyday social interaction.\nAs detail-oriented probes, these questions can follow up, and\nfocus, responses from interviewees by requesting and facili-\ntating further, specific information from them. The questions\ncan also check or clarify the understanding of the interviewer\n(Roulston, 2011), require interviewees to justify their state-\ninterviews. Such control is important when time is scarce\nand interviewees dwell on material that does not answer the\nquestion posed, are loquacious, or appear to withhold infor-\nmation. Likewise, leading questions can appropriately char-\nacterize interviews because \"the decisive issue . . . is not\nwhether to lead or not to lead, but where the questions do\nstipulating the use of open and non-leading questions is pro-\nviding a framework wherein questions can lead participants\nto provide answers that accurately represent their world and\npoint of view and are relevant to serving the research aims of\nthe interviewer (Patton, 2002). In other words, the quality of\nformal interviews depends less on the types of questions\nposed than their ability to achieve the purposes of the\nUse of Numbers\nCompared with quantitative research, qualitative research\ncontinues to be typified as de-emphasizing the use of num-\nbers (Adler & Adler, 2012). Numbers are not, of course, a\nkey characteristic overlapping other features of qualitative\nresearch. However, a family resemblances approach allows\nrecognition of their relevance to different stages of, and\napproaches to, conducting qualitative research. Numbers can\nbe used to establish the rationale for qualitative research, be\nimportant to consider and describe in sampling for qualita-\ntive research, and characterize some forms of QDA.\nSmall samples typify, but are not unique to, qualitative\nresearch; they can also characterize quantitative research,\nmost notably single-subject trials of treatment safety and\neffectiveness. Moreover, the size of qualitative samples var-\nies. Diversity within the study group is likely to increase the\nsample size needed. Qualitative samples that are too small\nfor the purpose of a particular study can miss a key perspec-\ntive. Overlarge qualitative samples introduce redundancy\nand thus contribute inefficiently to the developing under-\nstanding of the researcher.\nIn turn, researchers may seek to analyze the content of\nqualitative data by enumerating in context the frequency of\nkeywords or ideas within analyzed text. The generated fre-\nquencies may be reported as numbers explicitly or implicitly\nthrough verbal language such as \"most\" or \"usually.\" This\napproach can represent \"an attempt not to infer meaning but,\nand it can appropriately facilitate and display pattern\nrecognition.\nHowever, as a point of difference from quantitative\nresearch, the use of simple counts in non-probability samples\ncannot give precision to statements about \"the frequency,\ntypicality or even intensity of an event\" (Sandelowksi, 2001,\np. 231). Counts of how many participants report something\nare also difficult to interpret or use to validate a viewpoint in\nthese samples. Participants' stories \"defy the anonymity of a\nnumber\" (Seidman, 2006, p. 9) because \"it is the quality of\nthe insight that is important, rather than the number of\nrespondents that share it\" (Wainwright, 1997, p. 11). Bradley,\nCurry, and Devers (2007) nevertheless exemplify the misno-\nmer that \"themes are recurrent unifying concepts or state-\nments about the subject of inquiry\" (p. 1760) even though\nrecurrence cannot suffice to identify themes because it is not\nthe same as importance (Buetow, 2010). Because codes can\nbe infrequent but important, and because inductive reasoning\ndoes not confer likelihood or probability (Rudnick, 2014),\nthe number of instances is also irrelevant to the ability to\ngeneralize findings on the basis of logic. My key point, how-\never, is that the relevance of numbers to qualitative research\ncan be easily overlooked in the absence of looking for family\nresemblances.\nConclusion\nThis discussion has sought to offer a more nuanced under-\nstanding of qualitative research. It has used a family resem-\nblances approach to typify qualitative research as a unified\ncollection of overlapping similarities, none of which is indi-\nvidually necessary or sufficient. This approach typifies qual-\nitative research more comprehensively than does requiring\npredefining features. My approach also helps to circumvent\nthe current plethora of competing definitions of, and\napproaches to, qualitative research. Instead, it yields a single\nclear image of qualitative research as producing rich data by\nselecting and engaging purposefully with small samples, and\nanalyzing them using iterative processes of abduction, induc-\ntion, and deduction--without taking an overtly unified\nstance on epistemological issues. These family resemblances\nreflect a loose kind of structure that still reduces the com-\nplexity of qualitative research to similarities and common\nfeatures, a characteristic typical of post-positivist epistemol-\nogy and methodology. However, the focus now is on what\nsome features--not necessarily all--have in common. The\nuse of prototypes minimizes this limitation by qualitatively\nhighlighting features that appear functionally most impor-\ntant.Afurther problem is that for observable features of qual-\nitative research to resemble one another (and so share a\nfamily resemblance) is different from them forming a natural\nfamily; thus, there is likely to be a \"gray zone\" in which\nsome examples of qualitative research--such as applications\nof a summative content analysis--do not look like qualita-\ntive research, whereas other non-qualitative research--such\nas a case report--looks qualitative. However, family resem-\nblances usefully approximate truth in terms of coherence\nwithin a system of consistent propositions. I invite readers\n6 SAGE Open\ntherefore to consider developing this approach, and my\napplication of it, to attend as simply as possible to the com-\nplex challenge of defining qualitative research.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAdler, P.
