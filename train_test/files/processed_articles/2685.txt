Judges and juries consistently produce\ncoherent patterns of noneconomic damages.\nI. Introduction\nPain and suffering and other noneconomic damages awarded by courts have generated\nmuch normative and policy debate in the United States (see, e.g., Bovbjerg et al. 1988;\nthe unpredictability of damages have led to controversial caps on noneconomic dam-\nages,1 such as the California Medical Injury Compensation Reform Act (MICRA) of\nStatutes capping damages have generated much litigation under U.S. state constitutions\n(Love 2012). Whether pain and suffering damages and other noneconomic awards are\ntoo capricious is also an important question in European legal systems (Karapanou &\ntended that the medical malpractice law, which can lead to millions of Taiwan dollars\n(NTD) in pain and suffering damages, has caused the younger generation of doctors to\nchoose high-profit and low-risk specialties, such as plastic surgery and dentistry, rather\nthan surgery. The highest judicial authority in Taiwan, the Judicial Yuan, has commis-\nsioned a leading tort scholar to develop a regression model to help judges determine\nthe amount of pain and suffering damages. In short, the stakes of assessing whether\npain and suffering damages are reasonable and predictable are high.\nFrom the law and economics perspective, a prerequisite for the torts system to\nachieve optimal deterrence is setting damages at expected losses (if not the actual\naccept is taken as the benchmark for quantifying pain and suffering, it is still difficult\nfor judges to set expected losses accurately (for the difficulty of assessing the value of\npecuniary losses, the better approach is using simple tables or formulas to assess pain\nand suffering damages to save administrative costs. Indeed, Ramseyer's (2015:10\u00ad34)\nstudy on the Japanese torts system shows that because the Japanese Supreme Court uses\npublicly available tables to assess pain and suffering damages and court-published\n1For instance, 31 states have adopted caps on noneconomic damages or total damages in medical malpractice\nlawsuits (Paik et al. 2016). Pain and suffering damages also are an instance of unbounded damages, which gener-\nate positively skewed award distributions (Kahneman et al. 1998; Guthrie et al. 2000), which in turn lead to\nreform proposals (e.g., Kahneman et al. 1998).\nprofessional negligence against health-care providers to $250,000.\nhandbooks to determine comparative negligence, most parties involved in traffic acci-\ndents settled. To strike a balance between optimal deterrence and saving administrative\ncosts, making pain and suffering damages predictable and reasonable is arguably\nsecond-best, as Ramseyer (2015) suggests.\nWhile most people would agree that $1 dollar or $1 trillion for pain and suffering\ndamages are unreasonable, in most real-world cases, it is hard to make persuasive argu-\nments that the court-adjudicated awards are reasonable or not. Unless a barometer can\nbe developed to measure and compare pain and suffering and a reliable formula can be\nused to inform decisionmakers how much money is sufficient to ease pains, assessing\nreasonable pain and suffering damages is an impossible mission.\nConsequently, policymakers should focus on the predictability of pain and suffer-\ning damages. Predictability does not ensure optimal deterrence, but unpredictability\ndooms optimal deterrence. Predictability also facilitates settlements. Unpredictability\nincreases health insurance premiums that further make certain efficient actions unsus-\nbased on tables or formulas are generally predictable, but not all jurisdictions have fol-\nlowed this scheme--for countries such as Taiwan and the United States, it is worth\nexploring whether discretionary pain and suffering awards connect to measurable\nfactors.\nThere are two types of predictability: statistical and legal. Statistical significance of\nkey variables and high goodness of fit make pain and suffering damages predictable in a\nstatistical sense. Yet to be predictable in a legally relevant way, the key variables have to\nbe easily measured by parties before litigation and closely related to the legal issue. For\ninstance, medical expenses and levels of injury are arguably good proxies for pain and\nsuffering, and they are easily ascertainable by the two parties without judicial adjudica-\ntion. Below we demonstrate that pain and suffering damages in Taiwan are to a large\nextent statistically and legally predictable. Granted, the R-squares of our OLS models\nare not close to 1, and a few variables, such as plaintiffs' comparative negligence, have\ncounterintuitive signs and statistical significance. These types of variables make pain and\nsuffering damages statistically predictable but perhaps less legally predictable, as com-\nparative negligence is difficult to ascertain by the two parties and its effect would sur-\nprise them.\nConnections between pain and suffering damages and objective factors have been\ninfrequently studied, probably because detailed data rarely are available.3 That is, wheth-\ner pain and suffering damages are statistically predictable is understudied. Prior empiri-\ncal investigations of pain and suffering damages utilize datasets from insurance\ncompanies (Viscusi 1988), insurance regulators (Kritzer et al. 2014), U.S. state court\nFlatscher-Th\n3Sharkey (2005:448--49) notes that although the National Center for State Court Project has tried to code the\ncomponents of economic and noneconomic damages, the data were so incomplete that the Center would rather\nnot publish them.\n  Injury Cases\nthe exception of some sources used in Kritzer et al. (2014) and Cohen and Miller\n(2003), the prior studies lack detailed information about pain and suffering and pecuni-\nary damages. The major determinants of pain and suffering damages thus remain\nunclear.\nUsing randomly sampled cases from Taiwan, we provide two innovative analyses of\npain and suffering damages. First, we obtained detailed breakdowns of damages catego-\nries and assessed their influences on pain and suffering damages. This unique dataset\nenables us to test empirical conjectures made by torts scholars that have not been able\nto be put to tests before. The observational research design does not allow us to make\ncausal inferences. Yet showing correlation (or lack of) among certain important varia-\nbles is an important step in further understanding the determinants of torts damages\nand a stepping stone for future scholars to design their researches to make causal infer-\nences. We find that proxies of pain and suffering--medical expenses and the level of\ninjury (minor vs. serious injury)--are associated with pain and suffering damages. The\nstrength of the medical expenses correlation is important for two reasons. Medical\nexpenses are inherently related to pain and suffering, and their association suggests a\ncoherence to the damages system. In addition, medical expenses outperform other\npecuniary components of damages in explaining pain and suffering. This is evidence of\njudges filtering out components of pecuniary damages that are less likely to be associat-\ned with pain and suffering. We also find that the victims' annual incomes, among other\nfactors, were not influential. The absence of association with income is important\nbecause it avoids providing higher-paid workers with greater pain and suffering damages\nthan lower-paid workers. Victims in medical malpractice cases tended to receive more\npain and suffering damages than those in car accident cases, consistent with scholarly\nconjecture. Victims' ages are negatively correlated with pain and suffering damages in\nmedical malpractice cases.\nSecond, our data include the amount of pain and suffering damages requested by\nplaintiffs. Using structural equation models that can control for the endogeneity prob-\nlem, we find that as the plaintiffs' requests for pain and suffering damages increased,\nthe judges awarded more.\nOur Taiwan dataset is rare in being a non-U.S. source of pain and suffering dam-\nages information. We exploit these novel data by comparing the Taiwan results with\nanalogous data from U.S. trial outcomes. We find little evidence that noneconomic dam-\nages form a higher percentage of total damages in the United States than in Taiwan.\nWe do, however, present evidence that noneconomic awards, by both U.S. juries and\njudges, are higher per unit of economic damages than those in Taiwan, all by judges (as\nthere is no jury system in Taiwan as of 2015). This research thus extends the prior pain\nand suffering literature to the study of career judges in a civil-law country.\nThe predictability of pain and suffering damages in a certain jurisdiction is not\nreadily generalizable. A study on judicial behaviors, however, reveals patterns that other\njurisdictions might share. We posit that judges endeavor to give rational awards but at\nthe same time may be influenced by biases and heuristics. (A fuller explanation of our\ntheoretical account of judges' behaviors will come in Section III.) The contribution of\nthis article is to demonstrate the predictability of pain and suffering damages in a\ncountry where such damages are subject to judges' discretion. The judicial decision-\nmaking patterns revealed by our study could inform researchers in other countries with\ncomparable torts damage systems.\nSection II of this article describes Taiwan's law relating to pain and suffering dam-\nages. Section III addresses our hypotheses and methodology. Section IV reports and dis-\ncusses our results. Section V addresses the results' relation to U.S. data, and Section VI\nconcludes.\nII. Taiwan's Pain and Suffering Damages Law\nPursuant to Articles 193 and 195 of the Taiwan Civil Code, victims of a tortious act can\nrequest the tortfeasor to pay pecuniary damages and pain and suffering damages.4 For\nexample, medical doctors can be liable to compensate a patient for both types of dam-\nages if they failed to diagnose the patient with cancer or other major diseases. Courts in\nTaiwan5 break down damages in such cases into 10 subcategories, as shown in Table 1.\nWe will occasionally use the labels in Table 1 to refer to damages types.\nNo table or formula exists for courts to determine the amount of pain and suffer-\ning damages. The Civil Code provides no guidance. A few leading cases rendered by the\nSupreme Court of Taiwan in the 1950s and 1960s declared that the following factors\nTable 1: Types of Awarded Damages\nLabel Expense Type Expense Item\nA1 Already incurred Medical treatment and operation\nA2 Already incurred* Nursing care, medical devices, and nutritious food\nE1 Estimated future Medical treatment and operation\nE2 Estimated future* Nursing care, medical devices, and nutritious food\nA3 Already incurred Victim's lost salary during hospitalization and recovery\nE3 Estimated future Victim's future lost salary (discounted to present value or paid as annuities),\nif the tortious act decreases the victim's capability to work and earn\nA4 Already incurred Increased traveling expenses (e.g., taxi fares to and from hospitals)\nA5 Already incurred Property damages (e.g., repair fee for damaged cars)\nE4 Estimated future Other expenses (including, among others, increased traveling expenses)\nPS Pain and suffering damages\n*A2 and E2 can each be further divided into nursing care, medical devices, and nutritious food, but during the\ncoding process, we pool these three items together.\nSOURCE: Chang et al. Pain and Suffering Damages Data Set 2015.\n4Taiwan Civil Code Art. 193I promulgates: \"If a person has wrongfully injured another and caused the injured\nperson to lose or decrease his laboring capacity or to increase the necessary living expenses, the tortfeasors shall\ncompensate the injured person.\" Taiwan Civil Code Art. 195I prescribes: \"If a person has wrongfully infringed\nthe body, health, reputation, liberty, credit, privacy or chastity of another, . . . the infringed party may claim rea-\nsonable pain and suffering damages.\"\n5Judges in Taiwan are career judges who serve on the bench after passing a judiciary examination and receiving\ntraining for two years. As of December 2015, there is no jury system in Taiwan, though a pilot program on intro-\nducing a \"lay observer system\" is under way (Huang & Lin 2013).\n  Injury Cases\nshould be considered: the socioeconomic status, total assets, annual income, age, educa-\ntional background, and the like of both sides, the plaintiff's level of pain and harm, the\nvictim's negligence, the defendant's repentance, and so on. Other than these factors,\nno conventional wisdom or rules of thumb exist for quantifying pain and suffering to\ndate. In practice, the plaintiff generally simply claims an amount and contends that it is\njust, with little supporting evidence. The court decisions usually start with a template dis-\ncussion that carbon-copies the list of factors emphasized by the leading cases,6 then\nsummarize the facts of the case at hand, and award an amount at the end. As judges\nhave never elaborated their formulas and rarely provided concrete information regard-\ning the factors, it is doubtful to what extent those factors listed in the template argu-\nments affect the final amount of pain and suffering damages. In other words, the\nfactors prescribed by the Taiwan Supreme Court failed to enhance legal predictability.7\nCourts in Taiwan will review the receipts of all pecuniary expenses and only grant\nplaintiffs reasonable expenses. Due to the mandatory national health-care system that\ncovers most medical treatments and medication, only medical expenses that are not cov-\nered by the health-care plans (such as co-payment, certain special medicines and opera-\ntions, and domestic nursery care) can be recovered by the victim from the tortfeasor.\nPlaintiffs do not have an incentive to claim unrealistically high amounts of pain\nand suffering damages. First, filing fees are proportional to the amount of claimed total\ndamages (roughly, around 1 percent of the total claimed damages).8 Second, the losing\nparty has to pay filing fees. In a tort lawsuit, a plaintiff usually has to pay part of the fil-\ning fee if the court does not grant all her claims. The plaintiff generally has to pay [1 \u00ad\n(court award/plaintiff's claim)] 3 filing fee. Hence, claiming a high amount of pain\nand suffering damages increases both the filing fee and the probability of bearing a\nhigher percentage of the filing fee. Nevertheless, plaintiffs expecting the return rate of\noverclaiming to be higher than 1 percent will still overclaim.9 One important caveat:\nwhen a plaintiff makes pain and suffering damages claims as part of the criminal pro-\nceedings against a defendant, and the defendant was found guilty, the plaintiff does not\nhave to pay filing fees for her civil lawsuit in the court of first instance.\n6Not all courts use the same template. The factors that a court explicitly claims to take into account slightly\ndiffer.\n7In unreported tables, we explored the factors that Taiwanese courts purport to have considered in determining\npain and suffering damages. The information provided in the written court decisions is often insufficient to\ndetect meaningful association between those factors and the amount of pain and suffering damages. That is,\naided by regression models, we still cannot ascertain whether these factors are statistically predictable.\n8Pursuant to Article 77-13 of the Civil Procedure Code of Taiwan, the filing fee is assessed in the following way:\nthreshold of NTD 10 million, NTD 100 million, and NTD 1 billion, respectively. For all the cases in our dataset,\nthe filing fee is slightly higher than 1 percent of the worth of the claims.\n9One of us, in another article, uses the expected judicial award predicted by hedonic regression models as the\nbaseline to measure whether plaintiffs overclaim (Chang et al. 2015).\nTaiwan can generally be considered a civil-law country. Almost all judges are career\njudges who may or may not have (most have not) practiced law before serving on the\nbench. Most jurists in Taiwan major in law as an undergraduate, and only a minority of\njurists are trained in a JD-like graduate program. Jurists who pass the bar exam (its pass-\ning rate has always been below 11 percent) and finish six months of practical training are\nqualified to practice law. Jurists who pursue a career as judges or prosecutors have to take\nthe court officer examination. Those who pass the examination receive training in the\nAcademy for the Judiciary for two years. At the end of their training, based on their\ngrades, preferences, and available openings, they will become judges or prosecutors. Judg-\nes are tenured, and thus presumably less influenced by external political influences. For\ncivil matters, there are three levels of courts: district courts, appellate courts, and the\nsupreme court. The former two can determine both questions of fact and questions of\nlaw, while the supreme court only deals with questions of law. Appealing to the appellate\ncourt is as of right, whereas large-stake cases represented by attorneys can be appealed to\nthe supreme court, subject to its discretion (Eisenberg & Huang 2012; Chen et al. 2015).\nIII. Hypothesis and Methodology\nA. Major Research Questions\nOur core empirical question is to identify the major determinants of court-adjudicated\npain and suffering damages. Our dataset contains detailed information regarding the\ncomponents of damages (in every case, we can break down total damages into 10 com-\nponents; see Table 1). Hence, we can measure the association of pain and suffering\ndamages with various factors holding others constant. Although we explore the associa-\ntion of several factors with pain and suffering damages, a purely kitchen-sink approach\nis not preferred. A behavioral theory of judicial decision making in nonpecuniary dam-\nages would inform the empirical strategy. Lack of demographic information about the\njudges prevents us from directly testing any demographic theory. We instead focus on\nhow the victims' behaviors, characteristics, and litigation strategies affect the amount of\npain and suffering damages.\n1. Severity of Injury as Proxy for Pain and Suffering\nOur first conjecture, based on discussions with dozens of judges in all three levels of\ncourts in Taiwan, is that judges consciously base the amount of pain and suffering dam-\nages on the severity of injury. \"Severity of injury\" in this article represents an abstract\nstandard that varies among judges and is not specified by any statute, regulation, or\ncourt precedent. Indeed, no criterion has been explicitly endorsed by any court deci-\nsions.10 As long as judges make a common-sense judgment of severity of injury, the\nseverity of injury shall be associated with certain quantifiable measures, such as medical\n10There are a few ways to measure percentage of lost earning capacity, as discussed below, but most cases in our\ndataset do not involve assessment of lost earning capacity.\n  Injury Cases\nexpenses and level of injury (minor vs. serious injury). Our first hypothesis is that both\nthe medical expenses and level of injury are positively associated with pain and suffering\ndamages.\nThe level of injury and medical expenses are our proxies for the severity of injury,\nnot necessarily the judges'. Statistically significant and positive relations between these\nproxies and the amount of pain and suffering damages, however, would suggest that no\nmatter which criterion judges used to render their decisions, the criterion must be high-\nly correlated with our proxies. We use both proxies because a dummy variable capturing\ntwo levels of injuries is insufficiently sophisticated to capture the variety of injuries.\nWithin each level of injury, the medical expenses, a continuous variable, serve to pro-\nvide a more refined categorization of the severity of injury. Using medical expenses\nalone as a proxy, on the other hand, would fail to capture the categorical differences\nbetween a minor injury and a serious injury.\nThat the levels of injury and pain and suffering damages are positively correlated is\nempirically plausible11 and should be justifiable, while the relation between medical\ntures that pain and suffering damages might be positively correlated with medical expenses\noni et al. 2013), but points out that the data avail-\nable then only enabled researchers to test pain and suffering damages versus all kinds of\npecuniary damages mixed together. Kritzer et al. (2014) provide a review of the relevant\nliterature and a rare study of the relation between noneconomic damages and economic\ndamages. They report a mixture of consistent and inconsistent patterns across multiple\ndatasets. Kritzer et al. (2014:38) conclude that \"there tends to be considerably more vari-\nability in the relationship between non-economic and economic damages than between\npunitive and compensatory damages.\" Our detailed data allow us to assess which subcate-\ngory of pecuniary damages is most strongly correlated with pain and suffering damages\nand test whether Avraham's (2006) conjecture is empirically valid.12 The association should\nbe normatively acceptable, to the extent that the medical expenses capture the severity of\ninjury well (we do not have external criterion to verify this) and as long as the medical\nexpenses in our dataset are not constrained by the income or wealth of the victim.13\nance Commissioners (NAIC) and find a consistent relationship between the jury verdict awards and the level of\ninjury in several jurisdictions in the United States. Flatscher-Th\nlevel classification and find similar results in Austria.\n12Note that although pain and suffering damages in the United States could be assessed by judges or juries (see\nSection V), what Avraham (2006) has in mind might be jury awards. In this sense, our data on court-adjudicated\npain and suffering damages in Taiwan cannot be used to test the claim. In Section V, though, we compare our\nTaiwan data with the U.S. data to shed light on this issue.\n13Summary statistics shown in Table 2 demonstrate that the medical expenses are not as high as a U.S. reader\nwould guess, as the mean is USD 15,514 and the median is USD 2,904. The highest several medical expenses con-\nsist mostly of estimated future nursing care (E2). That means that at the time of litigation, the victim did not yet\nhave to pay for it. Once the tortfeasor compensates the victim, the latter can afford to pay for the necessary nurs-\ning service.\n2. Other Predictors\nIn addition to the level of injury, which we hypothesize to exert the most influence on\nthe amount of pain and suffering damages, other factors may affect the assessed amount.\nAgain, while we cannot establish causation with this research design, associations can be\nexplored. Two predictors are explored here; others are discussed in Section IV.\nFirst, a victim's age could be a predictor of pain and suffering damages, but theo-\nretically it is unclear whether judges should take age into account. Avraham (2006:111)\nchampions a system in which age is negatively correlated with pain and suffering dam-\nages, other things being equal, as permanent injuries produce more total pain for youn-\nger victims. Nonetheless, according to the adaptation theory (Bronsteen et al. 2008;\nreturn to their preinjury stage, or at least rebound, after a few years (but see Huang\n2008). Hence, age is largely irrelevant for total pains. Although we cannot examine\nwhether victims adapt, our data enable us to test whether judges consider age to be rele-\nvant to total pain.\nSecond, adjudicators may use plaintiffs' future lost income as a reference point. If\nthis is the case, white-collar workers would tend to receive more pain and suffering dam-\nages, although it is unclear whether high-wage earners suffer more pain than the\nlow-wage earners for a given bodily injury, and whether the rich would need more com-\npensation to ease their pain (Avraham 2006:114). Pecuniary damages to property would\nbe another example of dubious factors. In lawsuits involving car accidents, such a refer-\nence would give Lexus owners more pain and suffering damages than Toyota owners.\nSome prior empirical papers have found that objective losses positively correlated with\npain and suffering damages. Hans and Reyna (2011:141), using U.S. state court data,\nfound that the amount of noneconomic damages is positively correlated with that of\npecuniary damages. Other empirical studies have also found that jury-determined pain\nand suffering damages are often some multiple of the plaintiff's pecuniary losses or at\nleast significantly correlated with the pecuniary losses (Bovbjerg et al. 1988; Viscusi\nciently refined to tease out the different effects of medical expenses and nonmedical\nexpenses such as lost income and property damages.\n3. Anchoring Effect by Plaintiffs' Claims\nWe do not assume that judges are always rational. Most judges would prefer to give rea-\nsoned decisions. Nevertheless, in tasks such as assessing pain and suffering damages,\nwhere a large amount of awards have to be determined without clear guidelines, judges\nmight also be subject to the spell of heuristics. In other words, the court-adjudicated\npain and suffering damages may not be entirely rational.\nPsychological experiments have shown that, other features held constant, the\nhigher the requested amount of compensation (the ad damnum clause), the higher the\n  Injury Cases\njury verdict (Campbell et al. 2014). This is the well-known anchoring effect (Ariely\nirrelevant one, might influence the amount of pain and suffering damages.\nIn a tort lawsuit that leads to awards of pain and suffering damages, several num-\nbers exist and potentially become anchors. We submit that the plaintiff's requested\namount of pain and suffering damages is more likely than other amounts to serve as an\nanchor. Plaintiffs' requested amounts are directly related to the issue. Thus, before a\njudge turns to how much pain and suffering damages to award, she would need to\nremind herself of the requested amount (as her adjudicated amount cannot surpass the\nrequested amount). This makes the requested amount more likely to anchor a judge's\ndecision. Our hypothesis is that as judges have to determine a number without legisla-\ntive guidance, plaintiffs' requests, holding constant other variables, have a substantial,\nstatistically significant, and positive effect on the pain and suffering award. This empiri-\ncal examination has strong policy implications. Plaintiffs in a handful of states in the\nUnited States are not allowed to bring up the ad damnum clause (Franklin et al.\n2008:299). Yet in many other states, plaintiffs can specify a dollar amount, on the\nassumption that juries or judges are free to regard it as irrelevant (Diamond et al.\ngest that the effect is too strong for judges and juries to resist and that the current prac-\ntice of assessing pain and suffering damages is not normatively flawless.\nA caveat is in order. Judges are likely to be influenced by meaningful and mean-\ningless anchors (Rachlinski et al. 2006), but most literature focuses on the meaningless\nanchors, whereas the experimental researches that study meaningful anchors are able to\nisolate the effect of meaningful anchors by holding other factors strictly constant. In an\nobservational study like ours, it is difficult to control for everything. Although, as elabo-\nrated below, the structural equation model used can control for the endogeneity prob-\nlem, the plaintiffs' requested amount of pain and suffering damages itself contains both\nthe meaningful and meaningless parts--the former reflect the true pain and suffering\nwhile the latter capture the exaggeration. Yet we have no reliable method to tease out\nthe portions of these two parts. Hence, even when the plaintiff claim variable is statisti-\ncally significant, we do not know which parts drive the result. The strongest claim we\ncan make is only that the statistically significant result is consistent with the experimen-\ntal literature in finding an effect of meaningless anchors.\nB. The Data\nAll civil cases decided by the district courts in Taiwan since 2000 are available for down-\nload on the official website of the judicial administration (Judicial Yuan) of Taiwan.16\n15For introduction to the anchoring effect in law, see, e.g., Teichman and Zamir (2014). Other legal studies that\nfound the anchoring effect in legal settings include Guthrie et al. (2000), Wistrich et al. (2005), and Rachlinski\n16http://jirs.judicial.gov.tw/FJUD/ (website in Chinese).\nUsing carefully chosen keywords,17 we limited the district court cases yielded by our\nsearch to ones the plaintiff won and ones rendered between January 1, 2008, and\nDecember 31, 2012. The research period was chosen because other research teams in\nTaiwan have collected data on similar issues before 2008 and are collecting data on simi-\nlar issues resolved in appellate courts. Our data thus fill in a potential data gap. More-\nover, we focus on decisions by the court of first instance. As emphasized by Guthrie\nfirst instance. Many of these decisions are final in that they are not appealed. Such cases\navoid the selection issues that arise in studying appellate cases, for example, the parties'\ndecisions to appeal and settle cases pending appeal. Small claim and summary proceed-\ning cases are excluded because the judgments in these cases usually do not contain\nenough information about the cases.\nWe searched for and coded pain and suffering damages cases related to personal\ninjury. Death cases were excluded because they are doctrinally and substantively differ-\nent.18 We limited our search to two types of tort cases--medical malpractice and car\naccident--to focus on negligent (rather than intentional) infringements that have simi-\nlar background facts within the categories. Medical malpractice is a hotly debated tort\nissue in many jurisdictions, whereas car accident cases are numerous and thus not trivial.\nAfter irrelevant cases were filtered out,19 44 medical malpractice cases that ended with\nan award of positive pain and suffering damages were found and coded. By contrast,\nmore than 3,000 car accident cases showed up in our search. We coded a random sam-\nple of one-tenth of the car accident cases. To assure geographic representation of the\nwhole country, we stratified the sample by judicial district to obtain 10 percent of car\naccident cases from each of the 20 jurisdictions. This resulted in 297 car accident cases\nin our dataset. A few cases have multiple plaintiffs. In 18 of the 341 observations, victims\nwere in persistent vegetative state. Scholars and judges may have very different views\nregarding whether these victims should be awarded pain and suffering damages or how\nmuch discount or premium should be given to them. We thus omit these 18\nobservations from the following analysis.20 The total number of observations is thus\n17The search terms are, of course, in Chinese and hard to translate. The literal translation of the search terms\nfor car accident cases are: (road traffic OR traffic accident OR car accident NOT state responsibility) AND (Article 195 OR\nArticle 194) AND (defendant pays OR defendants jointly pay). The literal translation of the search terms for medical\nmalpractice cases are: (medical dispute OR medical incident OR medical malpractice) AND (defendant pays OR defendants\njointly pay).\n18Under Taiwan law (Civil Code Art. 194), claimants for pain and suffering damages in death cases are the\ndeceased party's spouse, children, and parents, not the deceased party's estate or heir. Also, in death cases, the\ndeceased party may neither experience long pain and suffering nor spend on medical expenses.\n19In some cases, the plaintiffs did not request pain and suffering damages. Our search terms also capture cases\nin which the tort victims were dead---these cases are analyzed in Chang et al. (2015b).\n20In Section V, when comparing the Taiwan data with the U.S. data, we include the vegetative state cases, as there\nis no sufficient information to exclude this type of cases from the U.S. data.\n  Injury Cases\n323.21 Unreported regression analysis reveals that the results are essentially the same if\nthese 18 observations are taken into account.\nWe examined whether substantial differences in awards existed across 12 court dis-\ntricts.22 There was no significant difference in the ratio of pain and suffering damages to\nnon pain and suffering damages across the courts (Kruskal-Wallis p 5 0.33; ANOVA (natu-\nral log of ratio) p 5 0.19).23 The absence of difference persisted when we subdivided the\nsample into car accident cases and medical malpractice cases. The absence of intercourt\ndifference persisted when using the ratio of pain and suffering damages to total damages.\nAs Figure 1 shows, the pain and suffering damages awarded in car accident cases\nby courts in Taiwan exhibit a somewhat bell-shaped distribution (after a natural log\ntransformation) around USD 10,000.24 The skewed distribution supporting the natural\nlog transformation is typical of unbounded award outcomes. The pain and suffering\ndamages in medical malpractice cases, if awarded at all, were no less than USD 3,333\n(100,000 NTD). In all but three cases, courts in Taiwan awarded pain and suffering\nmedical expenses ended with two or more zeroes in only 17 cases. This preference for\nround numbers in noneconomic damages is consistent with Hans and Reyna's\nTable 2 provides selected summary statistics of the dataset.

Pain and Suffering Damages Data Set 2015.\n25Oren Bar-Gill suggests to us that whether the victim was present in the courtroom and whether the victim's injury\nis visible to the judge may affect the amount of pain and suffering damages. From the written decisions, we can\nhardly tell whether the victim was present. We interviewed a few attorneys and judges, and were informed that most\nattorney-represented victims do not show up in the courtroom. Although a few self-represented victims would try to\nshow their scars to the judges, most plaintiffs rely on photos and medical reports to demonstrate their injuries\nbecause the tort lawsuits usually take place months after the accident, and most wounds would have healed. We go\nback to the written decisions and try to code a dummy variable on whether the injury would be visible, and it turns\nout that (at least part of) the injuries in almost all cases are visible. Therefore, we do not change our models.\n26We transform all damages and expenses into natural log forms to promote normality. Unreported regression\nmodels use un-logged damages and expenses, but the residuals exhibit heteroscedasticity, violating the assump-\ntion of OLS models.\n  Injury Cases\nTable 2: Summary Statistics\nPanel A: Continuous Variables\nN Mean Median SD Min.

Medical expenses include the costs\nof medicine, doctor visits, hospital expenses, medical devices, nursing care, and nutri-\ntious food (A1 1 A2 1 E1 1 E2). Expenses of nursing care are often higher than other\nsubtypes of medical expenses combined in serious injury cases. Thus, medical expenses\nare more exactly \"medical and caring expenses.\" For brevity's sake, we use medical\nMinor injuries and serious injuries are distinguished based on the standard stipulated\nin the Criminal Code of Taiwan. That is, a serious injury is one of the following conditions:\n1. Destruction of or serious damage to the sight of one or both eyes; 2. Destruction of or\nserious damage to the hearing of one or both ears; 3. Destruction of or serious damage to\nthe functions of speech, taste, or smell; 4. Destruction of or serious damage to the function\nof one or more limbs; 5. Destruction of or serious damage to the power of reproduction;\nand 6. Other serious injury to body or to health that is either impossible or difficult to cure.\nPEC includes one variable, the natural log of nonmedical expenses, which is used\nin the first two regression models. Future lost salary (E3) is decomposed into three ele-\nments: \"number of years of lost earning capacity\" (using a square root transformation to\npromote normality), \"plaintiff's annual income\" (in natural log), and \"percentage of\nlost earning capacity,\"27 and they are used in one model.\nPL includes a variable on the percentage of plaintiffs' contributory negligence (in\nour dataset, from 0 to 0.75) and a dummy variable on whether plaintiffs retain attor-\nneys. A variable on plaintiffs' ages and a dummy variable indicating whether plaintiffs'\nages are missing are included, as are an interaction term of plaintiffs' ages and a dum-\nmy variable on serious injury. In one model using only car accident cases, three more\nvariables are used:28 a dummy variable on whether the plaintiff drove a sedan or other\nmotor vehicle such as a taxi and a truck; and two variables that distinguish whether the\nplaintiff was a pedestrian, passenger, or driver.\n27In some cases, victims lose working and earning capacity only for a few years. In the regression models, we use\nthe three component variables of the future lost salary only if the victim loses part of the capability permanently\n(there are 64 such observations).\n28We have coded many details regarding the car accidents such as the vehicles used by plaintiffs and defendants\nduring the accidents. We are not aware of any good theory that predicts whether these factors will or will not\naffect the judges' decisions. A lot of degrees of freedom would be consumed if all of these variables are included\nin models. We select these three variables based on least angle regression, a model-building algorithm that values\nparsimony as well as accuracy (Efron et al. 2004). It is worth emphasizing that other variables in the models are\nchosen based on their theoretical importance.\n  Injury Cases\nDF includes the natural log of the number of natural-person defendants; a dum-\nmy variable for whether the defendants include a corporation; a dummy variable for\nwhether the defendant is a minor and whether his/her parents are vicariously liable; a\nvariable on the number of medical doctor defendants; and a dummy variable for wheth-\ner the defendants are represented by attorneys. We also distinguish whether the party\nwas a driver, a passenger, or a pedestrian.29\nTYPE includes a dummy variable that indicates whether it is a car accident case or\na medical malpractice case; another dummy variable further distinguishes, in medical\nmalpractice cases, whether doctors performed substandard treatments/operations or\nfailed to diagnose a latent cancer/illness.\nDt is a series of dummy variables (one for each year) that controls the timing of\nthe judgment. Di are a series of court dummy variables that control for the variance\namong jurisdictions.\nWe report four models. The first model uses both the car accident cases and med-\nical malpractice cases. The second model uses only the car accident cases and adds a\nfew variables to test whether the other facets of the accidents influence the damages\nawards. The third model uses only the car accident cases and, on the one hand, con-\ntains selected variables from the first model, but, on the other hand, adds three more\nvariables related to victims' future lost salary. The fourth model uses only the medical\nmalpractice cases. Due to the small number of observations, this final model is parsimo-\nnious, using only the few key variables.30\n2. Structural Equation Model\nOur data include the amount plaintiffs requested in pain and suffering damages. Such\ninformation has not been available in prior pain and suffering studies. Due to endoge-\nneity, we do not include it in the above single-equation regression models. The\nrequested amount is not independent of other explanatory variables such as medical\nexpenses and level of injury. However, the requested amount is of obvious interest and\npotential importance. It might be expected to influence the awarded amount in two\nways. First, higher requested amounts put higher numbers before the judge. Anchoring\ntheory suggests that higher requested numbers will be associated with higher awarded\nnumbers independently of the merits of an increased award. Second, higher requested\namounts may be associated with factors that should increase awards but are not repre-\nsented by observable variables in a single-equation regression model. The plaintiffs, in\nformulating the requested amount, may have access to information about the degree or\n29In unreported regression models, we also include the plaintiff's and defendant's annual incomes. There are\nmany missing values for annual income of plaintiffs and defendants. Including these variables in the regression\nmodels would greatly reduce the number of observations and degrees of freedom. Thus we exclude them in the\nreported models. In unreported models, parties' incomes are not statistically significant in OLS and SEM models.\n30Plaintiffs' comparative negligence could not reasonably be included in Model (4) because it had a nonzero val-\nue in only one case. Recall that Model (4) is about medical malpractice, and naturally the plaintiff/patient is\ninfrequently negligent.\nnature of pain and suffering that we cannot observe. To account for the more complex\nrelationship among the variables in models that include plaintiffs' requests and to con-\ntrol for the endogeneity problem,31 we employ a structural equation model,32 which\ntakes the following form:\nPSD and INJURY represent the same variables as in the single-equation models. CLAIM\nis the natural log of plaintiffs' requested amount of pain and suffering damages.\nINJURY, PL, and TYPE with a subscript s represent selected variables from the single-\nequation models. PLA includes plaintiffs' claimed medical expenses and a dummy vari-\nable on whether such expenses equal zero.\nIV. Findings and Discussion\nA. Medical Expenses and Level of Injury Best Explain Pain and Suffering Damages\nTable 3's models indicate that medical expenses are highly statistically significantly asso-\nciated with pain and suffering damages (p < 0.001 in all but the last model). For Models\n(1), (2), and (4), a 1 percent increase in medical expenses is associated with about a\n0.25 percent increase in pain and suffering damages. The first-row graphs in Figure 2\ndemonstrate that the quadratic fitted line for medical expenses and pain and suffering\ndamages is almost straight, suggesting that the relation between the two logged variables\nis close to linear.33\nUnlike medical expenses, nonmedical pecuniary damages do not have statisti-\ncally significant association with pain and suffering damages. Figure 2 provides a\ngraphical exposition of the lack of association, particularly in the case of minor\n31An endogeneity problem occurs when an explanatory variable is correlated with the error term. If the\n\"independent variable\" is correlated with the error term in a regression model, the estimate of the regression\ncoefficient in OLS regression may be biased. There are many methods of correcting the bias, including instru-\nmental variable and structural equations regression. The models we are considering are known as a recursive sys-\ntem (Wooldridge 2010:228); the identification of these models is guaranteed. Endogeneity arises as a result of\nthe recursive model specification. Using OLS for recursive systems does not give the most efficient estimates so\nbetter estimation methods are usually applied.\n32Economists refer to models that combine explicit economic theories with statistical models as structural econo-\nmetric models. The estimation method we are applying is called structural equations modeling (SEM). The\nresults of the structural equations are estimated simultaneously by the Stata command \"sem\" (acronym for structur-\nal equation models) or \"gsem\" (acronym for generalized structural equation models). The term \"generalized\" is\nmore like generalized linear models---that is, regression models for nonnormal data. This should not be confused\nwith general linear models, which are for normal-distribution-based linear models with a full covariance matrix\nthat is to be estimated along with the linear effects---these types of models include the two-stage least square mod-\nel. An alternative is the two-stage least squares estimation; however, we use the SEM approach.\n33Unreported regression models include a quadratic term, the square of natural log of medical expenses, but this\nvariable is not statistically significant.\n  Injury Cases\nTable 3: Regression Models of Court-Awarded Pain and Suffering Damages\nAll Cases Car Only Car Only Med-Mal Only\nDependent variable: natural log of court\u00adadjudicated pain and suffering damages\nCourt and year fixed effects Yes Yes No No\nP driving types No Yes No No\nNOTE.

These findings\nunderpin the conjecture that judges emphasize medical expenses over nonmedical expenses.\nThe level of injury (minor injury or serious injury) is statistically significant, except\nin Model (4), which has only 33 observations, all medical malpractice cases.

Neither variable on nonmedical pecuniary damages is statistically significant.\n  Injury Cases\nand years lost earnings variables. Only in the cases in which the victims ask for future lost\nsalary would the court determine these factors. In addition, 38 of the 290 car accident\ncases have missing percent earning capacity lost, and the other two variables have a similar\npattern. The composition of the missing and the nonmissing groups must be different and\nthere may be some underlying selection. Since the regression models only include percent\nof earning capacity if it is permanent, the nonmissing group tends to have more serious\ninjuries. In addition, victims in the nonmissing group tend to be working adults, not retir-\nees or children. The main takeaway from Model (3) in Table 3 is that even within the non-\nmissing group, the effects of medical cost and injury level still dominate those of the\npercent earning capacity lost, plaintiff annual income, and years lost earnings.\nMedical expenses and level of injury are highly associated, as shown in Figure 3. The\nstatistical significance of both the serious injury dummy variable and the medical expense\nvariable suggest that when the medical expenses are the same, victims with serious injuries\nreceive more pain and suffering damages than those with minor injuries. Also, within the\ninjury category, higher medical expenses predict higher pain and suffering damages.\nNote that medical expenses are unlikely to influence judicial decisions by being\nan anchor, as such expenses are a combination of several types of incurred and\nexpected medically-related expenses. Their sums are not computed in the written judg-\nments. That is, medical expenses are not one number (but several different numbers)\nfor judges. That being said, as we discuss below, judges may still suffer from the anchor-\ning effect (created by plaintiffs' claims) and may adjust the amount of pain and suffer-\ning damages according to factors that are normatively harder to justify.\nFigure 3: Court-adjudicated medical expenses by injury level.\nMedical expenses (log 10 of USD)\nminor serious\nLevel of Injury\nCar accident case Med-mal case\nNOTE: Expense amounts are in USD.

Accounting for Plaintiffs' Requested Pain and Suffering Damages\nWe now explore whether, in addition to the other influences on the pain and suffering\naward, the plaintiff's pain and suffering damages request is associated with the judge's\npain and suffering award. We cannot meaningfully model the defendant's counterclaims\nconcerning pain and suffering damages35 due to their variety and lack of explicit\namounts.36 At least three reasons suggest that the request should be relevant. First, judg-\nes will not award more than the plaintiff's request. The request therefore caps the pain\nand suffering award and should be nonrandomly associated with it. Second, plaintiffs\nhave an incentive to make reasonable pain and suffering requests because the filing fee\nincreases as the requested amount increases. Third, the medical or other pecuniary\ndamages that inform a pain and suffering request are known to the plaintiff, as are oth-\ner intangible aspects of the case.\nBecause the requested amount is not independent of other damages factors, we\nuse a structural equation approach in which the structural equation includes the plain-\ntiff's requested pain and suffering amount and an additional equation that models the\nplaintiff's requested amount as a function of objectively observable factors. Table 4\nreports the results. The model accounts for the sample design, as described above.\nThe model is analogous to Table 3's first model to facilitate comparing the effect\nof including the requested pain and suffering amount with a model that does not\ninclude the requested amount. The pain and suffering award equation uses key explana-\ntory variables from Model (1) in Table 3, but drops insignificant variables. The results\nof the structural equation model largely confirm what is found in the OLS model. The\neffects of plaintiffs' claims and attorney representation warrant more discussion.\n1. Evidence for the Anchoring Effect\nThe award equation in the structural equation model shows a strong, significant associa-\ntion between the requested pain and suffering award and the actual pain and suffering\naward. This is evidence that the plaintiff's request, independent of objective measures of\npain and suffering, is associated with the judge's pain and suffering award. The request\nequation models the plaintiff's requested pain and suffering damages. Rather than using\ncourt-adjudicated medical expenses, it uses the natural log of the plaintiff's claimed\nmedical expenses, in addition to a dummy variable that equals 1 when such expenses\nare zero. The judge's award is not used as an explanatory variable because the award is\nunknown when the plaintiff makes a damages request. The presence of a lawyer for the\ndefendant is not included in the model because the plaintiff does not know whether\nthe defendant has a lawyer when the damages request is made. The request equation\n35Diamond et al. (2011:174) find that juries are less inclined to reject the defendant's claim than the plaintiff's\nclaim.\n36An unreported table shows that almost half the defendants simply counter that plaintiffs' claims are too high.\n  Injury Cases\nshows that the request is significantly associated with other explanatory variables in the\naward equation. This is, of course, plausible since the same principal factors that influ-\nence the judge's award likely influence the plaintiff's request.\nThe association between a plaintiff's pain and suffering request and higher pain and\nsuffering awards could be interpreted as evidence of an anchoring effect.37 After objective\nmeasures of the qualitative nature of harm and the quantitative monetary loss are\naccounted for, the size of the requested amount remains associated with the judge's pain\nand suffering award. Absent an experimental setting, it is difficult to isolate a pure anchor-\ning effect from other unobservable factors that may increase the judge's pain and suffering\naward. Thus, our finding is consistent with the psychological literature on anchoring, but\nit is not affirmative evidence that the anchoring effect exists in litigation.38\nIn the anchoring interpretation, judges are thought to follow the \"anchor and adjust\"\nprocedure (Tversky & Kahneman 1974:1128). That is, judges use the plaintiff's request as the\nstarting point and adjust it by taking into account medical expenses and other factors we found\nstatistically significant. Judges, however, make insufficient adjustments and thus award plain-\ntiffs with more pain and suffering damages than they otherwise would without the anchor.\nThe anchoring effect is normatively problematic. It increases legal unpredictability\nof damages awards (Avraham 2006:95). Like cases are treated not alike simply because\nplaintiffs for whatever (often strategic) reasons claim higher. The existence of a possible\nanchoring effect also suggests that though judges have, overall speaking, done an admi-\nrable job in basing pain and suffering damages on factors that are highly relevant to the\nvictims' pain, judges are still human, and they fall under the spell of anchors.\n2. Attorney Influence\nThe model also suggests the mechanism through which lawyers may affect the judge's\npain and suffering award amount. Table 2 shows that only 39 percent of plaintiffs had\nattorneys. The plaintiff having a lawyer is not significant in models of the pain and suf-\nfering award (Table 3). Nonetheless, it is highly significant in the equation modeling\nthe requested pain and suffering amount (Table 4). This suggests that the lawyer effect\nis indirect and not readily detected in single-equation models (such as Models (1) and\n(2) in Table 3). The presence of a plaintiff lawyer increases the request, which in turn\nincreases the judicial award.39 (A single-equation model that includes the pain and\n37This finding is consistent with the experimental result on the same issue reported in Chapman and Bornstein\ninclined to reject the plaintiff's request than the defendant's counterclaim, particularly regarding the pain and\nsuffering damages. They conjecture that the general suspicion about plaintiffs may be at work there.\n38One of us, using a more refined empirical strategy and a different dataset, tries to tease out the anchoring\neffect in real-world settings (Chang et al. 2016). We defer the job of identifying the anchoring effect outside the\nlaboratory to that article.\n39Our finding of a positive association between pain and suffering recoveries and the presence of an attorney is\nconsistent with O'Connell and Simon's (1972:23--24) finding such an association in automobile accident cases.\nTheir early study lacked the specific controls available to us.\nsuffering request yields results consistent with those in Table 4). The dummy variable\non whether defendants retain attorneys is statistically significant in the OLS model\nreported in Table 3, while it is not statistically significant in the structural equation mod-\nel reported in Table 4. One of us, in another paper, focuses on teasing out the effect of\nattorney representation and attorney experience in torts litigation (Chang et al. 2015);\nthus, we will not go into further detail here.\nHaving a lawyer is associated with a higher requested damages amount. Nevertheless,\nhaving a lawyer is not in itself exogenous since lawyers may be sought in and attracted to cases\nwith higher damages. To check the influence of the mechanism by which lawyers are selected,\nwe used Stata's generalized structural equation modeling feature (the gsem command) to add\nTable 4: Structural Equation Model Relating to the Requested Pain and\nSuffering Award\nPain & Suffering\nAward\nPain &\nSuffering Request\nTotal Effects of\nVariables on Awards\n(A) (B) (C)\nPlaintiff's pain and suffering request\n(natural log)\nMedical expenses (allowed by\nthe court; natural log)\n5 1 if plaintiff's claimed medical\nexpenses are zero\nNOTE.

We assumed that the\nstakes of the case would be most influential to a lawyer's presence for plaintiffs. For the plain-\ntiff lawyer equation, the explanatory variables we used were whether the plaintiff was seriously\ninjured, the total damages other than pain and suffering, and the degree of the plaintiff's\nfault. For the defendant lawyer equation, we added to these variables whether the defendant\nwas a corporation and whether the plaintiff had a lawyer. The results reported in Table 4 did\nnot materially differ when these equations were added.40\nC. Lost Income and Pain and Suffering\nCases in which victims request compensation for reduced earning capacity are an important\nsubset of observations. For permanent reduction in earning capacity, courts usually award the\nvictim a lump sum consisting of lost salary from the time of judgment to the mandatory retire-\nment age,41 discounted to present value. The compensation is mainly based on three factors:\nyears until retirement, current annual salary, and percentage of lost earning capacity. To\ndetermine the percentage, courts often rely on the \"schedule of impairment\" declared by a\ngovernment agency for labor insurance purposes.42 The annual salary is a matter of proof.43\nOne might expect that the percentage of reduced earning capacity would serious-\nly compete with or supplement medical expenses and the level of injury as measures of\nvictims' pain and suffering. The more one loses earning capacity, the more pain and\nsuffering (due to the injury itself and the sense of fulfillment from working) one may\nincur. On the other hand, a bodily impairment that causes substantial suffering may not\nalways reduce earning capacity. Losing an eye may be a case in point. Thus, in some\ncases, reduced earning capacity may be an inadequate proxy for pain and suffering. It is\ntherefore of interest to address the relation between earnings and pain and suffering in\nmore detail. Model (3) in Table 3 includes three measures of permanently reduced\nearning capacity: annual income, percentage of lost earning capacity, and years of lost\nearning capacity. The regression result shows that they do little to add to medical\nexpenses and injury levels as an explanation of pain and suffering.44\n40Plaintiff being represented by a lawyer was significantly associated with serious injury. Defendant being repre-\nsented by a lawyer was significantly associated with whether the plaintiff had a lawyer and whether the defendant\nwas a corporation.\n42In 34 percent of the cases, courts explicitly refer to such a schedule.\n43In 56 percent of the cases, courts use the victim's actual preinjury salary. In 40 percent of the cases (usually\nwith minor victims), courts use the minimum wage to calculate lost salary.\n44We have tried several other unreported model specifications, but the results are consistent: as long as the dum-\nmy variable representing injury levels and the medical expense variable are included in the regression models,\nnone of the three variables regarding future lost salary are statistically significant. In unreported models, we have\nreplaced the three component variables with one variable that captures the amount of total future lost salary.\nThe result is essentially the same.\nThe insignificance of the three components of future lost salary is empirically\nunsurprising and normatively acceptable. Regarding annual income, utility theorists\nhave posited how the utility of a given dollar changes when the rich become poor and\nempirical evidence of utility changes appears, judges can understandably regard the\namount of salary as irrelevant to pain and suffering.45\nIn addition, percentage of lost earning capacity is itself correlated with positive amount\nvictims who lost more earning capacity higher pain and suffering damages, once judges have\naccounted for the severity of the victims' injuries. Another reason for the insignificance of lost\nearning capacity might be that the percentage of lost earning capacity is ascertained in only\nabout 17 percent of our observations, so we do not have sufficient statistical power to sort out\nits effect. Finally, the number of years of permanently lost earning capacity is highly correlated\nwith the victim's age, but because not all victims work or claim lost income, the number of\nobservations that contains years of lost earning capacity is not large. The statistical insignifi-\ncance of this variable might be attributed to the lack of statistical power. Below we will demon-\nstrate that the victim's age is sometimes a statistically significant variable.\nD. Other Variables of Interest\nOther than plaintiffs' comparative negligence, none of the variables besides medical\nexpenses and injury levels are consistently statistically significant at the 5 percent level.46\nWe discuss three interesting aspects of the empirical results below.\nA few words regarding optimal deterrence here. Shavell (2004:240) notes that to\nattain optimal deterrence, courts may award expected losses if they cannot ascertain actual\nlosses in individual cases. If judges aim to award expected losses (and largely ignore the var-\niation of facts across cases), in cases where pecuniary damages are low, courts might be\ninclined to award higher pain and suffering damages, so that the overall compensation\nawards would be similar across cases, creating specific deterrence for the tortfeasors. By con-\ntrast, if judges aim to award actual losses, low pecuniary damages would often come with\nlow nonpecuniary damages, as victims in those cases may not have been seriously injured.\nOur dataset suggests that judges in Taiwan appear to aim for compensating victims for their\nactual losses. The Pearson correlation coefficient between pecuniary damages and pain and\n45Avraham (2006:114) has argued that it is unjustified to base pain and suffering damages on incomes. Note also\nthat the Pearson correlation coefficient between natural log of plaintiff incomes and natural log of court-\nadjudicated medical expenses is only 20.087. Thus, the lack of statistical significance of the plaintiff income vari-\nable cannot be attributed to the presence of medical expenses in the model.\n46Unreported regression models show that the annual income of both parties does not have statistically signifi-\ncant effects on the amount of pain and suffering damages. We have tried to use both \"positive income only\" and\n\"positive plus no income\" in our models. The results are the same. Note that the annual incomes used in the\nunreported models here are not necessarily the same as the incomes used in the calculation of lost salary. In the\nlatter, sometimes courts do not use the actual annual income (such as when the victim was not working). Some-\ntimes, victims who are working do not claim for lost salaries.\n  Injury Cases\nsuffering damages is 0.636 (p< 0.001). Unreported scatterplots and the positive coefficients\nfor medical expenses and nonmedical expenses in Table 3 also provide a consistent story.\n1. Victim's Fault\nOne interesting issue is whether the victim's own fault influences the amount of pain and\nsuffering damages. In Taiwan, judges take into account the plaintiff's comparative negli-\ngence at the end of the damages computation process. That is, the various types of damages\nare first determined and summed, and then the deduction percentage (the comparative\nnegligence attributed to the victim) is applied across the board.47 The plaintiff's compara-\ntive negligence thus reduces both her pecuniary and her pain and suffering damages.\nFigure 4 shows the relation between pain and suffering damages and the percent\nof negligence attributed to the plaintiff (0\u00ad75 percent in our dataset). It does not show\na strong association between the two, but the positive slope of the line is puzzling. It is\ncounterintuitive for judges to increase the amount of pain and suffering damages when\nthe victim herself is more at fault. The regression models reported in Tables 3 and 4,\nFigure 4: Percentage of plaintiff's negligence and compensation level.\nPain and suffering damages (log10 USD)\n% negligence by plaintiff\nPain and suffering amount\nLowess line for all observations\nLowess line for nonzero fault observations\nNOTE: Damage amounts are in USD and the figure includes 323 Taiwan court cases decided from 2008 through\n2012. Jittering is used to facilitate viewing similar data points. The lowess lines are nonparametric lines that best\nfit the data. It shows a modest upward-sloping trend.\nSOURCE: Chang et al. Pain and Suffering Damages Data Set 2015.\n47For instance, assume that total pecuniary damages are $75 and pain and suffering damages are $25---total com-\nhowever, confirm the figure; the comparative negligence variable is statistically signifi-\ncant and is consistently positive.\nThe bunching of observations at zero fault for plaintiffs led us to explore models\nthat also included a dummy variable that equals 0 when the plaintiff's fault was nonzero\nand 1 when it was zero. Neither the zero-fault dummy variable nor the fault variable are\nstatistically significant. Nevertheless, in the regression model that contains only the 123\nobservations in which plaintiffs are at fault, the fault variable is still statistically signifi-\ncant at the 5 percent level. Perhaps the cases with highest plaintiff fault resulted in\nmore pain and suffering that is not captured by our injury-related variables. Negligence\nby the defendant and substantial negligence by the victim might lead to worse results\nthan in cases in which the victim is modestly negligent or not negligent.\nAnother possible explanation arose in a round-table discussion with several of Tai-\nwan's most experienced judges. A few judges suggested that judges may be compassion-\nate toward the tort victim and, despite the victim's own fault, be unwilling to\nsubstantially reduce the postdeduction compensation. Hence, judges may award higher\npain and suffering damages than they otherwise would in anticipation of the fault-based\nreduction.48 The result of the structural equation model, reported in Table 4, echoes\nwith this compassion theory: plaintiffs do not claim higher when they are more at\nfault--it is judges who increase the pain and suffering awards when plaintiffs are more\nat fault. A caveat, however, is in order. While plaintiffs more or less know whether they\nare at fault and to what extent they are comparatively negligent, they cannot accurately\npredict their levels of court-adjudicated fault. We use the court-adjudicated fault in the\nplaintiff-claim equation in the structural equation model because there is no other way\nto ascertain plaintiffs' evaluation of their fault at the time of their claims.\n2. Victim's Age\nWe discussed above whether the length of enduring pain would influence the amount\nof the pain and suffering damages. There, the length is measured by the years of lost\nearning capacity. Here, we use the victim's age as an approximation.\nThe effect of age may vary, depending on the nature of injury. If the injury is persistent,\nthe victims are likely to suffer for the rest of their lives. Their ages are likely to be negatively\ncorrelated with the pain and suffering awards, as judges may reason that those with more years\nahead of them may feel more total pain over their whole lives. By contrast, provided that the\ninjury is not persistent, after some years victims may adjust to the body impairment and their\npain and suffering decreases--this is the psychological theory of adaptation (Sunstein\n48Sharkey (2005:391) hypothesizes an analogous effect when laws cap damages, pointing out that \"where noneco-\nnomic damages are limited by caps, plaintiffs' attorneys will more vigorously pursue, and juries will award, larger\neconomic damages, which are often unbounded.\"\n49Interestingly, the Tribunals of Milan and Rome in Italy use tables to compute the pain and suffering damages\nfor personal injuries. The damages decrease with age. We thank Alice Guerra for this information.\n  Injury Cases\nOur findings to some extent confirm the aforementioned hypothesis. As Figure 5\nshows, in serious injury cases, pain and suffering awards are indeed negatively correlated\nwith the victims' ages. When victims suffer from minor injuries, courts appear to have a\ndifferent approach toward age. In car accident cases, the victims' ages are positively cor-\nrelated with pain and suffering awards, while in medical malpractice cases, the victims'\nages are negatively correlated.\nRegression results confirm the scatterplot. In medical malpractice cases, Model (4)\nin Table 3 shows that age has a negative sign and is statistically significant at the 5 percent\nlevel. As for car accident cases, Models (1) and (2) in Table 3 show that victim ages and\nthe interaction term of ages and serious injury are not statistically significant. The signs of\nthe age variable and the interaction term are positive and negative, respectively.\nThe puzzle lies with the different effects of age. In car accident cases, no matter\nwhether the victims suffered minor or serious injuries, their ages have no statistically sig-\nnificant effect. It appears that judges subscribed to the adaptation theory, perhaps\nbelieving that even victims who suffer from persistent pain (more likely to correlate with\nserious injuries in our coding) would return to the preinjury hedonic level in a few\nyears. This would be counterevidence to \"adaptation neglect\" (Sunstein 2008:158). In\nFigure 5: Victim age, case type, injury type, and pain and suffering damages.\nCar accident, minor injury Car accident, serious injury\nMedical malpractice, minor injury Medical malpractice, serious injury\nPain and suffering damages Fitted line\nPain and suffering damages (log10 USD)\nAge of victim\nNOTE: Damage amounts are in USD and the figure includes 103 car accident cases and 16 medical malpractice\nSOURCE: Chang et al. Pain and Suffering Damages Data Set 2015.\nmedical malpractice cases, adaptation theory cannot explain the results. There, judges\nappeared to believe that pain and suffering will never subside, thus total expected life\nmatters. Hence, younger victims were given more pain and suffering damages. Our data,\nwith many missing values, do not enable us to fully untangle this puzzle.\n3. Car Accident Versus Medical Malpractice\nCar accident cases and medical malpractice cases exhibit different patterns. Figure 1\nand unreported statistics show that the mean, median, and 25th and 75th percentiles of\npain and suffering damages in the medical malpractice cases are higher than those in\nthe car accident cases. The case type dummy variable in our regression model (Model\n(1) in Table 3) is statistically significant, again suggesting that, other things being equal,\nthe medical malpractice cases are associated with more pain and suffering damages.\nAvraham (2006:95) has conjectured that victims in car accident cases might\nreceive less pain and suffering damages than those in medical malpractice cases because\nbeing injured in a special relationship causes more pain. As Koehler and Gershoff\n(2003) find, human beings are \"betrayal averse.\" Medical doctors are \"agents of\nprotection.\" When doctors mistreat patients and become \"agents of harm,\" people feel\nmore painful toward the injury than the same level of injury incurred without betrayal.\nThis conjecture is borne out by our data. The structural equation model reported in\nTable 4 provides a more nuanced explanation: the different pain and suffering awards\nare mainly driven by plaintiffs' claims; that is, plaintiffs claim more pain and suffering\ndamages in medical malpractice cases. More specifically, the total effect is the sum of\nthe direct effect and the indirect effect--the direct effect measures the influence of a\nvariable directly on court awards, whereas the indirect effect measures the influence of\na variable on court awards through its influence on the plaintiff's request (Freese &\nKevern 2013:31). The medical malpractice dummy variable has strong total and indirect\neffects but a weak direct effect. This suggests that plaintiffs take into account the case\ntype in claiming pain and suffering damages. The weak direct effect suggests that judges\ndo not disagree with plaintiffs' judgments regarding the effect of case type on pain and\nsuffering damages. The highly statistically significant total effects suggest that case types\nultimately influence the court-adjudicated pain and suffering damages.\nE. Pain and Suffering Damages as a Percentage of Total Damages\nThe prior literature on pain and suffering damages and the literature on the relation\nbetween ordinary damages and punitive damages have focused on the percentage of\n\"subjective\" damages (i.e., the pain and suffering damages or the punitive damages) in\ntotal damages. Figure 6 contains two sets of box plots in which the horizontal line repre-\nsents the median value of the percentage of damages consisting of pain and suffering\ndamages and the boxes show the interquartile range. The left-hand box plots show the\npain and suffering award as a percentage of the combined pain and suffering award\nplus medical expenses. The right-hand box plot shows pain and suffering awards as a\npercentage of the total award.\n  Injury Cases\nFor car accident cases, the median percentage of pain and suffering damages in\nrelation to medical expenses is about 70 percent and the 25th percentile is near 50 per-\ncent. So, in about 75 percent of the cases, the pain and suffering damages exceed the\nmedical expenses. For medical malpractice cases, the median percentage of pain and\nsuffering damages in relation to medical expenses is over 90 percent and the 25th per-\ncentile is over 70 percent. In almost all the medical malpractice cases, the pain and suf-\nfering damages exceed the medical expenses. The right-hand box plot in Figure 6\nindicates that, for car accidents, in about 50 percent of the cases, pain and suffering\ndamages exceed pecuniary damages (including nonmedical expenses and lost salary). In\nmedical malpractice cases, pain and suffering damages exceed pecuniary damages in\nabout 90 percent of the cases. Section V discusses the results in comparison to U.S.\nresults.\nFigure 6: Pain and suffering damages as percentages of damages.\nPS damages as % of (PS damages + medical expenses)\nCar accident Medical malpractice\nPS damages as % of all damages\nCar accident Medical malpractice\nNOTE: PS 5 pain and suffering. The figure shows the distributions of pain and suffering awards as percentages of\ndamages by tort type. In these box plots, the horizontal line in each box is the median value or 50th percentile.\nThe height of the box is a measure of spread of the distribution, called the interquartile range or IQR. It shows\nthe 25th to 75th percentiles of the distribution. Extending out from the box are the \"whiskers.\" The bottom whis-\nker represents the 25th percentile minus 1.5 times the IQR. The top whisker represents the 75th percentile plus\n1.5 times the IQR. Data points above and below the whiskers are considered outliers. The figure includes 290 car\naccident cases and 33 medical malpractice cases decided in Taiwan court cases from 2008 through 2012.\nSOURCE: Chang et al. Pain and Suffering Damages Data Set 2015.\nV. Relation to U.S. Trial Outcomes\nWe have information about the relation between pain and suffering damages and pecu-\nniary loss, as shown across the range of pecuniary loss in Figure 2 and as summarized in\nFigure 6. Given the attention devoted to the behavior of U.S. juries with respect to pain\nand suffering damages payments, it is of interest to compare the outcome of Taiwan tri-\nals to that of U.S. trials. Doing so requires using a dataset that contains reasonably\ndetailed information on U.S. trial outcomes. Data that specifically focus on pain and suf-\nfering awards are rare (Avraham 2006), so we use a dataset that reports on economic\nand noneconomic damages, of which pain and suffering damages are the major\ncomponent.\nThe U.S. dataset for this part of our study comes from the Civil Justice Survey of\nState Courts, a National Center for State Courts-Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) project\nthat has yielded four major datasets. The Civil Justice Survey gathered data directly from\nstate court clerks' offices on tort, contract, and property cases disposed of by trial in fis-\nods corresponds to a separate BJS dataset. The first three datasets covered state courts\nof general jurisdiction in a random sample of 46 of the 75 most populous counties in\nvey included 46 of the 75 most populous counties selected to maintain backward com-\npatibility with the earlier Civil Justice Surveys. The 2005 survey expanded coverage by\nadding 110 counties to represent the 3,066 smaller counties not included in the coun-\ntry's 75 largest counties.51 The 2005 data included all completed trials in the studied\ncourts in the United States in 2005, or 32.7 percent. Based on the sample design, the tri-\nals from the 46 counties are estimated to represent 10,813 general bench and civil trials\ndisposed of in the nation's 75 most populous counties. Trials from the 110 smaller\ncounties are estimated to represent 16,315 general civil and bench trials from outside\nthe nation's 75 most populous counties (BJS 2008; authors' calculations).\nWe extracted from the 2005 data information about economic damages and non-\neconomic damages for automobile accident cases and medical malpractice cases, the\ntwo case categories in the Taiwan data. Given the concern about the high fractions of\ndamages in the United States that consist of pain and suffering awards (Bovbjerg et al.\ninclude jury and bench trials. The three datasets include all completed trials in all three years in most of the\ncounties.\n51For a summary of the data and methodology, see Bureau of Justice Statistics (2008) and Inter-University\nConsortium for Political and Social Research (2009).\n  Injury Cases\nthat consist of pain and suffering awards in the Taiwan trials data with the fractions of\ndamages that consist of noneconomic damages in the U.S. trials data. Panel A of Table\n5 reports the results for automobile cases and Panel B reports the results for medical\nmalpractice cases. For the BJS data, we report results separately for judge trials and for\njury trials.\nTo those who attribute to U.S. juries unusually high percentages of damages awards\nthat consist of noneconomic damages, the results should be startling. Professional judges\nin Taiwan's civil-law system do not award meaningfully lower noneconomic damages as\nfractions of recoveries than do U.S. juries.52 Even within the United States, the table pro-\nvides no evidence of meaningful differences between judges and juries. Too few U.S.\njudge-adjudicated medical malpractice cases exist to support inferences about that category\nof cases, but the other table rows contain a reasonable number of cases.\nOther differences between the two legal systems caution against hasty conclu-\nsions based on the two countries' data. For example, to the extent that the measure of\nnoneconomic damages in the U.S. data includes components other than pain and suf-\nfering,53 the percentage of U.S. awards that consist of pain and suffering is systemati-\ncally lower than the percentages in Table 5. This suggests that pain and suffering\nawards by Taiwan judges likely are a higher percentage of total damages than are pain\nTable 5: Percentage of Damages Consisting of Noneconomic Damages\nMean Median SD N\nA. Car Cases\nB. Medical Malpractice Cases\nof state court trials ending in 2005. Cases where victims are in a permanent vegetative state are not excluded\nfrom this table.\nSOURCE (Taiwan data): Chang et al. Pain and Suffering Damages Data Set 2015).\n52The absence of difference may be partially attributable to U.S. states' statutory damages caps, as two of the 532\njury trials on car accidents and 33 of the 81 jury trials on medical malpractice were affected by state laws capping\ndamages. According to BJS (2008), MA, MO, MT, LA, NE, OH, SD, TX, WV, IN, FL, and CA have statutory dam-\nages caps in medical malpractice cases, whereas MI, KS, CO, NM, SC, and VA have broader statutory caps on\nnonpecuniary damages. Hawaii enacted statutory caps for pain and suffering damages.\n53As Kritzer et al. (2014) note, many state legislatures have defined additional categories of noneconomic dam-\nages, including disfigurement, loss of society, and loss of consortium. The codebook for BJS (2008) does not\ndefine nonpecuniary damages. See http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/cgi-bin/file?comp5none&study523862&ds5\nand suffering awards by U.S. juries and judges.54 On the other hand, Taiwan's national\nhealth-care system covers most routine medical treatments and medication (see Section\nII), so the medical expense portion of pecuniary damages in Taiwan likely is lower than\nthat portion of pecuniary damages in the United States for similar injuries. The relatively\nlower medical expenses tend to make pain and suffering damages a higher percentage of\ntotal damages than in the United States. Put differently, the percentage of Taiwan awards\nthat consist of pain and suffering would be, again, systematically lower than the percen-\ntages in Table 5 if the tortfeasors have to pay to the victims the medical expenses covered\nby the national health-care system. Despite these and other systemic differences, our results\nare evidence suggesting the absence of dramatic differences in the percentages of noneco-\nnomic damages awarded in the two countries.\nFigure 7: Relation between noneconomic and economic damages, Taiwan and the\nUnited States.\nPain & suffering damages (log10 USD)\nEconomic damages (log10 USD)\nCar, Taiwan judges\nNoneconomic damages (log10 USD\nEconomic damages (log10 USD)\nCar, U.S. judges\nNoneconomic damages (log10 USD\nEconomic damages (log10 USD)\nCar, U.S. juries\nPain & suffering damages (log10 USD)\nEconomic damages (log10 USD)\nMedical, Taiwan judges\nNoneconomic damages (log10 USD\nEconomic damages (log10 USD)\nMedical, U.S. judges\nNoneconomic damages (log10 USD\nEconomic damages (log10 USD)\nMedical, U.S. juries\nNOTE: Y-axis is noneconomic damages for the U.S. data and pain and suffering damages for the Taiwan data.\nSOURCE (Taiwan data): Chang et al. Pain and Suffering Damages Data Set 2015).\n54Pain and suffering awards were found to not constitute a high proportion of awards in Illinois medical malpractice\n  Injury Cases\nSimilarity extends to another important feature of damages, the relation between\nnoneconomic damages and economic damages. Figure 7 contains scatterplots of that\nrelation for the Taiwan and U.S. data. The first row's graphs cover automobile accident\ncases and the second row's graphs cover medical malpractice cases, with U.S. cases again\nseparated by judge and jury trial. Each subfigure also shows the best-fitting regression\nline from a simple regression of noneconomic damages as a function of economic dam-\nages. To facilitate comparison, the figure shows the Taiwan damages in USD and uses\ncommon x and y scales for all graphs.\nFigure 7 confirms strong associations between economic and noneconomic dam-\nages in the datasets. All scatterplots, except that of five medical malpractice judge-tried\ncases, suggest a significant positive relation between economic and noneconomic dam-\nages. As noted in our discussion of the Taiwan case results, increasing noneconomic\ndamages likely reflect greater noneconomic losses being associated with greater pecuni-\nary harm, or anchoring on the pecuniary loss, or a combination of the two. Simple\nregression models, reported in Table 6, confirm the figure's impression. Each model\ncontains a single explanatory variable, economic damages, and either noneconomic\ndamages (U.S. data) or pain and suffering damages (Taiwan data) as the dependent\nvariable.\nThe coefficients for medical malpractice cases across the datasets are reasonably\nconsistent, as shown in Panel B of Figure 7.55 But, as suggested by Figure 7's second row,\nsubstantially less of the variance is explained in the jury-tried medical malpractice cases.\nTable 6: Regression Models of Noneconomic Damages\nCoefficient Std. Err. p Value N R2\nA. Car Cases\nB. Medical Malpractice Cases\nNOTE: The models all use economic damages (natural log10 USD) as the explanatory variable. Taiwan models\nuse pain and suffering damages (natural log10 USD) as the dependent variable. U.S. models use noneconomic\ndamages (natural log10 USD) as the dependent variable. Taiwan data are from court cases from 2008 through\nSOURCE (Taiwan data): Chang et al. Pain and Suffering Damages Data Set 2015).\n55Kritzer et al. (2014:tbls. 3, 8) analyze additional pain and suffering datasets. The additional data come from Cook\nCounty (Chicago), California, and other jury verdict reporters, which may have a systematic bias toward reporting large\nawards. Those data for U.S. and Cook County car awards show similar coefficients to the U.S. case coefficients in Table\n6. Those data for Cook County and California medical awards show similar coefficients to the medical coefficients in\nPanel B except that a dataset for a mixture of non-California states results in a coefficient of 0.434 (p 5 0.031).\nThis is in part a function of pooling data across heterogeneous U.S. states. Panel B breaks\ndown the U.S. medical case data into New York County cases, Cook County cases, and oth-\ner counties' cases.56 Among the three groups, coefficients substantially and significantly\ndiffer, with large differences in the variance in noneconomic damages explained.\nFigure 7 and Table 6 also show differences between the countries. U.S. awards are\nconsistently higher. Part of this difference may be due to differences in general economic\nconditions. Taiwan's 2012 per-capita purchasing power was about 74 percent that of the\nUnited States.57 Almost no Taiwan awards exceed USD 1 million and several are less than\nPanel A shows that the coefficient for economic damages is much smaller in Taiwan cases,\nsuggesting a lesser increase in pain and suffering damages per unit increase in economic\ndamages than in U.S. cases. Figure 7's first row shows this difference in slopes. This differ-\nence persists in median regression models, which reduce the influence of the large U.S.\nawards. The increased slope is not limited to U.S. juries as the slopes for the U.S. decision-\nmakers are similar and do not significantly vary (note again the small N of court-\nadjudication cases in the United States) (for similar finding, see Hans & Reyna 2011). The\nhigher slope may be attributed to U.S. noneconomic damages in the BJS data including\ncomponents other than pain and suffering. Also, U.S. juries may be concerned that a third\nor so of the damages will be paid to contingent-fee attorneys; thus, they up the ante when\ndetermining the awards. By contrast, attorneys in Taiwan collect fixed fees (Chang & Tu\n2016); thus, even compassionate judges do not have to be concerned with attorney fees.\nVI. Conclusion\nConcerns have been expressed in Taiwan about the variability of damages for pain and\nsuffering. We show that in car accident and medical malpractice cases, these damages\nare strongly correlated with measurable quantities and are not numbers randomly gener-\nated by judges. The amount expended for medical expenses and the level of injury are\ntwo key variables that explain much of the pain and suffering award. We also provide\nevidence that the requested amount influences the awarded amount beyond the impor-\ntant objective influences on awards. Judicial anchoring on the plaintiff's requested\namount may increase pain and suffering awards beyond the amount forecast by observ-\nable variables.\nEvidence of the basic rationality of pain and suffering damages has implications\nbeyond Taiwan. In the United States, concerns about damages for pain and suffering\ndamages have led to many statutes capping damages. Caps on damages are likely to\n56New York County and Cook County were the only two counties with more than six jury-tried medical malprac-\ntice cases won by plaintiffs.\n  Injury Cases\nreduce access to counsel, given the reduced expected recoveries (Garber et al. 2009). In\nthe classes of cases studied in the two countries, we show that noneconomic damages in\nthe United States do not constitute a higher percentage of the total damages award\nthan do pain and suffering damages in Taiwan. Given the evidence of rationality of the\nTaiwanese system, this should reduce concerns based on the substantial portion of dam-\nages consisting of pain and suffering damages in the United States (e.g., Viscusi\n1988:207). Both countries' systems show strong associations between noneconomic dam-\nages and economic damages. Reform proposals in both countries should be considered\nin light of the consistent evidence of rationally functioning systems.\nConcerns about pain and suffering damages in Taiwan and the United States\nshould also be considered in light of data from other countries. Karapanou and Visscher\n(2010a) compare pain and suffering awards from European country cases with amounts\nthat might be awarded if a metric from health-care economics, quality-adjusted life years\n(QALYs), were used.59 QALYs are based on surveys of people in various health condi-\ntions. QALYs in two states of health can be compared to quantify the difference between\ntwo states. Karapanou and Visscher (2010a) employed a conservative approach to mone-\ntize differences in health conditions based on QALYs, which they use to monetize pain\nand suffering. They compare their conservative estimates for amputations, spinal\ninjuries, and deafness to awards in court cases from Germany, Greece, Italy, and the Neth-\nerlands. They conclude that pain and suffering damages in Europe are systematically too\nlow--in our parlance, unreasonable. Policymakers should seriously study QALYs or other\nmetrics that could set reasonable and predictable pain and suffering damages.\nLastly, our Taiwan data are a product of judges' behavior; U.S. data come from\nboth judges and juries. Given the tendency of the media and policymakers to focus on\nU.S. juries, some similarities are worth noting. Taiwan judges, U.S. judges, and U.S.\njuries all produce strong statistically significant associations between noneconomic dam-\nages and economic damages. The three sets of decisionmakers also produce reasonably\nsimilar percentages of total awards that consist of noneconomic damages. Policy recom-\nmendations based solely on data relating to juries that recommend reducing their\nresponsibility (e.g., Kahneman et al. 1998) omit the relevant comparison group, judges.\nReferences\nAriely, Dan (2008) Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions.
