Blood samples for dexlansoprazole plasma concentrations and\nintragastric pH measurements were collected through 24 hours postdose on days 1 and 5 of\neach period.\nResults: Bioequivalence between the 30 mg ODT and 30 mg capsule dosage forms was\ndemonstrated by the primary endpoints of dexlansoprazole peak concentration (Cmax\n) and\nsystemic exposure (AUC) values contained within the prespecified 90% confidence interval\n(CI) range of 0.80\u00ad1.25. Additional primary endpoints of intragastric mean pH values and\npercentage of time with pH > 4 over the 24-hour postdose interval were equivalent for\ndexlansoprazole ODT and dexlansoprazole capsule. Treatment-emergent adverse events\nwere reported in 23% and 28% of participants receiving the ODT and capsule formulations,\nrespectively. Headache was the most common adverse event in both treatment regimens\nConclusions: Administration of dexlansoprazole 30 mg ODT or 30 mg capsule provided\nequivalent plasma exposure when either was administered as a single dose or as once\ndaily doses for 5 days. Pharmacodynamic equivalence between the two formulations was\ndemonstrated by similar intragastric pH parameters on both day 1 and day 5. No effect\nof day on dexlansoprazole pharmacokinetics was observed. Dexlansoprazole ODT and\ndexlansoprazole capsule were both well tolerated.\n",

GERD develops when the lower esopha-\ngeal sphincter does not close properly, allowing\nstomach contents to return back up the esopha-\ngus, most prominently resulting in symptoms of\nheartburn, acid regurgitation and erosive\nesophagitis (EE) [Zhao and Encinosa, 2008; Katz\net al. 2013]. Current therapies, such as antacids,\nhistamine-2 receptor antagonists and proton-\npump inhibitors (PPIs), aim to reduce acid in the\nstomach, though PPIs are the treatment of choice\nfor relief of GERD symptoms, as well as for heal-\ning of EE [Katz et al. 2013].

Routine use of over-the-\ncounter drugs or nicotine products, or prior use of\nany investigational drug was not allowed. Female\nparticipants who were pregnant, lactating, or\nintending to either become pregnant or donate\nova before, or 30 days after the study, were also\nexcluded from the study. Other exclusion criteria\nincluded prior use of dexlansoprazole or lansopra-\nzole and a known hypersensitivity to any compo-\nnent of the dexlansoprazole ODT, dexlansoprazole\ncapsule, or other PPIs. If any participant violated\nthe exclusion criteria after randomization, he or\nshe was removed from the study.\nApproximately 52 male and female adults (26 per\ntreatment sequence) were to be selected for par-\nticipation in the study.

There\nwas a minimum 7-day washout period between the last dose in the first treatment period and the first dose of\nthe second treatment period. A follow-up phone call was made 5 to 10 days after the last dose of study drug to\ninquire of any ongoing adverse events, new adverse events, and concomitant medications taken since final dose.\nODT, orally disintegrating tablet.\nTherapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology 9(6)\nthey received either the dexlansoprazole 30 mg\nODT or dexlansoprazole 30 mg capsule once\ndaily for 5 days. Dexlansoprazole ODT was\nadministered on the tongue and participants were\ninstructed to allow the tablet to completely disin-\ntegrate before swallowing the granules without\nchewing. No water was allowed with administra-\ntion of the ODT. Dexlansoprazole capsules were\nswallowed intact with water (240 ml) and partici-\npants were allowed to drink at any time except for\n1 hour prior to and 1 hour after dosing. FDA\nguidance recommends assessment of bioavailabil-\nity to be conducted under fasting conditions [US\nFood and Drug Administration and Center for\nDrug Evaluation and Research, 2003]. Therefore,\nboth ODT and capsule were administered follow-\ning an overnight fast of 10 hours, and no food\nwas allowed for 4 hours postdose on days 1 and 5\nwhen pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic\nassessments were performed. No food was\nallowed overnight and for 1 hour postdose on\ndays 2 through 4, when no pharmacokinetic and\npharmacodynamic assessments were performed.\nThe FDA guidance also recommends conducting\nthe bioequivalence study with the highest mar-\nketed dosage strength [US Food and Drug\nAdministration and Center for Drug Evaluation\nand Research, 2003]. The current study com-\npared the bioavailability of the 30 mg ODT with\nthe 30 mg capsule since the dexlansoprazole\nODT product is only manufactured in the 30 mg\ndosage strength [Takeda Pharmaceuticals\nSample collection\nBlood samples (3 ml each) for determination of\nplasma dexlansoprazole concentrations were\ndrawn into evacuated collection tubes containing\npotassium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid on\ndays 1 and 5 of each treatment period.

Higher dexlansoprazole plasma\nconcentrations may be observed in participants\nwho are deficient in the CYP2C19 enzyme\n[Takeda Pharmaceuticals America, Inc., 2016].\nTherefore, one 10 ml whole-blood sample for\nCYP2C19 genotyping was collected before\ndosing on day 1 of treatment period 1 from each\nparticipant.\nPlasma dexlansoprazole concentrations were\nmeasured by a validated liquid chromatography\ntandem mass spectrometry assay at PPD, Inc.\n(Middleton, WI, USA). The validated detection\nlimits for dexlansoprazole were from 2.00 ng/ml\nto 2000 ng/ml, and values below this range were\nconsidered to be zero for pharmacokinetic\nanalyses.\nIntragastric pH recording for pharmacodynamic\nanalysis of dexlansoprazole was performed for\n24 hours beginning immediately prior to study\ndrug administration on day 1 and day 5 of treat-\nment periods 1 and 2. A single-channel anti-\nmony probe attached to a data recorder unit\nmanufactured by Sandhill Scientific, Inc.\n(Highlands Ranch, CO, USA) was used for pH\nrecording. The unit was calibrated with standard\nbuffers (pH approximately 1 and 7) before each\nuse. On day -1 of period 1, the probe was\ninserted into the stomach via the nares to a dis-\ntance of approximately 10 cm past the lower\nesophageal sphincter. This preparatory insertion\nwas to verify that insertion of the probe could be\ntolerated and to obtain the length of the probe\ninsertion to be used on day 1 and day 5 of both\ntreatment periods. On days 1 and 5 of each treat-\nment period, the probe was inserted into the\nstomach via the nares to the predetermined\nlength identified on day -1. To minimize the\ndiscomfort of probe insertion, administration of\na topical anesthetic was permitted. Standard\nclinical procedures were employed for this pro-\ncedure, including permitting consumption of\nwater during the procedure. The continuous pH\nrecording session commenced immediately prior\nto study drug administration. Intragastric pH\nwas sampled and recorded every 2 seconds\nthrough the time of dosing until 24 hours post-\ndose on days 1 and 5 of each period.\nEndpoints\nThe primary endpoints in this study included the\npharmacokinetic parameters Cmax\nand AUC, and\npharmacodynamic parameters describing intra-\ngastric pH during the 24-hour period postdose\n(Table 1). Secondary endpoints included pharma-\ncokinetic parameters used to measure the extent\nto which a drug is active within systemic circula-\ntion and pharmacodynamic parameters describing\nthe intragastric pH in 6-hour intervals (Table 1).\nM Kukulka, S Nudurupati et al.\nThe time to reach Cmax\n(Tmax\n), terminal elimina-\ntion half-life (T1/2\n), apparent clearance after\nextravascular administration (CL/F) and apparent\nvolume of distribution after extravascular admin-\nistration (Vz/F) were secondary pharmacokinetic\nendpoints; secondary pharmacodynamic end-\npoints consisted of the mean pH and percentage\nof time with pH > 4 during the 6- to 24-hour\nperiod following dose.\nTreatment-emergent adverse events and overall\nsafety profiles of once daily doses of dexlanso-\nprazole ODT and capsule were assessed using\nsafety variables that included physical examina-\ntion findings, clinical laboratory testing, vital\nsign measurements, and 12-lead electrocardio-\ngram. Treatment-emergent adverse events were\ndefined as adverse events that began or wors-\nened during the period between receiving the\nfirst dose of study drug and 30 days following\nthe last dose. Adverse events were classified as\nserious if they were life-threatening, resulted in\ndeath, required hospitalization or extension of\npre-existing hospitalization, led to incapacita-\ntion, or necessitated intervention to prevent any\nof the aforementioned situations.\nStatistical analysis\nAll data analyses were generated using Statistical\nAnalysis System (SAS) Version 9.2 (SAS Institute,\nCary, NC, USA). Pharmacokinetic parameters\nwere derived from plasma concentrations meas-\nured on days 1 and 5 of each treatment period\nand were estimated using Phoenix WinNonlin\nVersion 6.3 software (Certara, Princeton, NJ,\nUSA). For each treatment regimen, descriptive\nstatistics for pharmacokinetic parameters were\ngenerated for all evaluable participants. Actual\nsampling times were used over scheduled sam-\npling times in all relevant computations.\nIndividual ratios of the two regimens for dexlan-\nsoprazole Cmax\nand AUCs on the original scale\nand the difference on the natural log scale were\nsummarized; geometric means were calculated\nfor dexlansoprazole Cmax\nand AUCs.

No formal statistical analyses\nwere conducted, based on CYP2C19 genotype.\nAfter dosing, pharmacodynamic parameters were\ncalculated for each formulation. The median\nintragastric pH was determined over 15-minute\nintervals from pH values collected every 2 sec-\nonds. The 15-minute medians were used to\nreduce the variability in pH measurements. The\nmean pH was then calculated as the average of\nthese 15 minute-interval medians over the\n24-hour period (primary endpoint) or over the\n>6-hour to 24-hour interval (secondary end-\npoint) postdose. A second parameter measured\nduring these intervals was the percentage of time\nwith intragastric pH > 4 (defined as the percent-\nage of the 15-minute median pH values that were\ngreater than 4). With consideration of relevant\nmeasures of variance in the literature, pharmaco-\ndynamic equivalence between the ODT and cap-\nsule was declared if the 90% CIs for the difference\nin percentage of time with pH > 4 between regi-\nmens were contained within the prespecified\nResults\nStudy population\nThere were 26 healthy adults in each treatment\narm enrolled in the study (Figure 1).

Both products\nare formulated with a dual delayed-release mech-\nanism; they contain two types of enteric-coated\ngranules designed to release drug in a pH-depend-\nent manner. The dual delayed-release technology\nis designed to provide an initial release of drug\n1\u00ad2 hours following dosing, and a subsequent\nrelease 4\u00ad5 hours after administration. The cap-\nsule should be swallowed whole, which may prove\ndifficult for some patients.\nDifficulty with swallowing has been reported in\nalmost 20% of patients in one survey, with 3% of\npatients citing frequent difficulty with swallowing\n[Cho et al. 2015]. Patients with frequent difficulty\nswallowing were also significantly associated with\nfrequent heartburn and acid regurgitation [Cho\net al. 2015]. In general, patients who have diffi-\nculty swallowing have been found to be less com-\npliant with their treatment regimens, and this lack\nof adherence can potentially adversely affect\npatient morbidity [Carnaby-Mann and Crary,\n2005]. An ODT formulation represents a more\nconvenient mode of delivery to patients with dif-\nficulty swallowing, with improved ease of admin-\nistration, reduced physiological stress, better\ncompliance and no increased risk of airway com-\nMaalouf, 2013]. A study of the pill-swallowing\nexperience in adults found that 76% of partici-\npants preferred ODT delivery to a conventional\ntablet, which some find difficult to swallow\nQuantification of systemic drug exposure by\nCmax\nand AUC values is used to determine the rela-\ntive bioavailability of different formulations. Prior\ninvestigation of the pharmacokinetics and pharma-\ncodynamics of the delayed-release dexlansoprazole\ncapsule have indicated that pharmacodynamic\neffects, such as change in pH, are related to AUC\nlevels [Vakily et al. 2009]. Similar AUC levels\nand comparable pharmacodynamic parameters\nobserved in this study indicate similar acid sup-\npression activity between the ODT and capsule\nforms. The results presented here demonstrate\npharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic equiva-\nlence for the 30 mg dexlansoprazole ODT and\n30 mg dexlansoprazole capsule. The determina-\ntion of bioequivalence allows the 30 mg ODT to\nbe prescribed for the same indications for which\nthe 30 mg dexlansoprazole capsule is approved\n[Takeda Pharmaceuticals America, Inc., 2016].\nImportantly, no difference in systemic exposure\nbetween the two dosage forms was observed after a\nsingle dose or after daily doses for 5 days. The\n24-hour pH control was equivalent between each\nformulation after a single dose or after daily doses\nfor 5 days. In addition, percentage of time with\nintragastric pH > 4 was similar over the 24-hour\nperiod following administration of either the ODT\nor capsule, including during the >6-hour to\n24-hour interval, a timespan covering nighttime\nacid production over to the next morning. For\nboth ODT and capsule formulations, greater pH\ncontrol was observed on day 5 than on day 1; the\ndifference may be partly attributed to lower intra-\ngastric pH values prior to the beginning of the\n24-hour pH-monitoring period on day 1. The\ncumulative inhibitory effect following multiple\ndaily dosing is anticipated due to the prolonged\nbinding of the active form of PPIs (sulfenamide)\n[Vakily et al. 2009]. The majority of adverse events\nwere mild and considered unrelated to the study\ndrug; no serious adverse events were reported.\nBoth dexlansoprazole 30 mg capsule and 30 mg\nODT are approved for use in adults as a treat-\nment for heartburn associated with symptomatic\nnonerosive GERD for 4 weeks, maintenance of\nhealed EE for up to 6 months and relief of heart-\nburn [Takeda Pharmaceuticals America, Inc.,\n2016]. The ODT formulation of dexlansopra-\nzole was developed as a more convenient method\nof delivery than those traditionally reserved for\npatients with difficulty swallowing. Further\noptions that add to the dosing flexibility of the\nODT formulation include administering dex-\nlansoprazole ODT granules orally via syringe or\nvia nasogastric tube after disintegration in water\n(Kukulka et al., manuscript in preparation).\nEvaluation of the pharmacokinetic and pharma-\ncodynamic profiles of dexlansoprazole 30 mg\nODT reported herein suggests that this novel\nformulation may be used as a substitute for the\n30 mg capsule, with added benefits of simpler\nadministration for patients who may have diffi-\nculty swallowing.\nTherapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology 9(6)\n"
