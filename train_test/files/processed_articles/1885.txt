Iron deficiency was defined as at least two abnormal results out of three biomarkers of iron\nstores. IDA was defined as a low hemoglobin level in the presence of iron deficiency. H. pylori infection was\nmeasured by serology. Complex survey estimators were used in the analysis. For 7,462 survey participants aged\n3 years, H. pylori infection was associated with decreased serum ferritin levels (percent change \u00bc \u00ff13.9%, 95%\nconfidence interval (CI): \u00ff19.5, \u00ff8.0) but not with levels of free erythrocyte protoporphyrin, transferrin saturation,\nor hemoglobin (percent change \u00bc 1.5%, \u00ff2.8%, and \u00ff1.1%, respectively). Multinomial logistic regression anal-\nyses indicated that H. pylori infection was associated with the prevalence of IDA (prevalence odds ratio (POR) \u00bc\ninfection was associated with a 40% increase in the prevalence of iron deficiency (POR \u00bc 1.4, 95% CI: 0.9, 2.0)\nafter controlling for relevant covariates. In the United States, H. pylori infection was associated with iron deficiency/\nIDA regardless of the presence or absence of peptic ulcer disease.\nanemia; anemia, iron deficiency; Helicobacter pylori; iron; peptic ulcer\nAbbreviations: cagA, cytotoxin-associated gene A; IDA, iron-deficiency anemia; NHANES, National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey.\nIron deficiency, defined as decreased total body iron\ncontent, is among the most common nutritional deficiencies\nin the world. Iron deficiency results in impairments in im-\nmune, cognitive, and reproductive functions, as well as\ndecreased work performance. Iron deficiency develops\nthrough three stages: 1) iron depletion, 2) iron-deficient\nerythropoiesis, and 3) iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) (1).\nAlthough the mechanisms remain unclear, clinical and epi-\ndemiologic studies suggest that infection with Helicobacter\npylori is associated with iron deficiency and IDA (2, 3).\nBarabino (2) hypothesized that gastritis increased levels of\nneutrophil-derived lactoferrin, and since H. pylori has a\nlactoferrin-binding protein receptor, the infection would\nresult in increased iron losses related to bacterial turn-\nover. A study of children in Alaska showed that anemia re-\nsponded to oral iron replacement but recurred when iron\ntherapy was discontinued, suggesting that mild chronic\nbleeding was involved (4). It seems likely that the patho-\ngenesis is multifactorial, including combinations of reduced\niron absorption related to decreased acid secretion, in-\ncreased iron loss from microbleeding, and utilization by\nbacteria.\nReprint requests to Dr. Victor M.

Specifically, we tested whether mean levels\nof different markers of iron stores or prevalences of iron\ndeficiency, IDA, and anemia from other causes differed ac-\ncording to H. pylori infection status. We also examined\nwhether this relation was limited to adults with a history\nof peptic ulcer disease.\nDetails on the design and methods of NHANES have\nbeen published elsewhere (8). In brief, the National Center\nfor Health Statistics collects data on a representative sample\nof the civilian, noninstitutionalized US population in 2-year\ntory, and examination data were collected from 9,965 survey\nparticipants to obtain national estimates of the prevalence of\nselected health conditions.

The specific laboratory methods used to mea-\nsure levels of hemoglobin and iron indicators have been\ndescribed elsewhere (6). Briefly, hemoglobin was measured\nusing an automated electronic counter, while immunoradio-\nmetric, colorimetric, and fluorescence extraction assays\nwere used to measure serum ferritin, iron and iron binding\ncapacity, and free erythrocyte protoporphyrin, respectively\nmeasured using the Wampole enzyme-linked immunosor-\nThus, the sample population for this cross-sectional study\nconsisted of participants aged 3 years. We excluded the\nrecords of participants without valid information on anemia\nand iron-store status; this left an analytic sample of 7,462\nparticipants.\nIn our analyses, we took into account the complex survey\ndesign of NHANES, using replicate weight jackknife esti-\nmators available in SAS-callable SUDAAN (version 8.1;\nResearch Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, North\nCarolina) to characterize the distribution of indicators of\niron stores and the prevalences of iron deficiency and IDA\nby H. pylori infection status and other selected variables.\nMean values and standard errors for serum ferritin, percent\ntransferrin saturation, and erythrocyte protoporphyrin were\ncompared using multiple linear regression analysis that con-\ntrolled for several potential confounders. We examined as\npotential confounders selected factors that have been pre-\nviously found to be associated with iron deficiency or\nH. pylori infection in NHANES. Forty percent of the US\npopulation uses multivitamin and mineral supplements\n(10); information on iron intake from supplements was not\nreadily available in the current NHANES. We also found\nTABLE 1.

There-\nfore, we decided to limit the analysis to actual levels of\nbiomarkers of iron stores.\nPrevious studies with NHANES data have used the pov-\nerty income ratio as a proxy for socioeconomic status (11).\nThe poverty income ratio is computed as reported household\nincome divided by the US poverty threshold, which is de-\ntermined annually by the Bureau of the Census and adjusted\nfor inflation. The National Center for Health Statistics cal-\nculated these values for each record. For assessment of renal\ninsufficiency in adults, we used cutoff values of estimated\nglomerular filtration rates derived from serum creatinine\nlevels as done in NHANES III (12). Levels of vitamin C\nhave been found to be inversely related to H. pylori infection\n(13) and to enhance iron uptake (14). We selected variables\nfor these linear and logistic models by entering those that\nseparately or jointly changed the crude point estimates in\na meaningful way (presented in the reduced model) (15). We\nalso obtained results for all potential confounders (presented\nin the full model).\nThus, the analyses controlled for age, gender, ethnicity,\nplace of birth, education, poverty income ratio, current preg-\nnancy status, number of previous pregnancies, vitamin C\nintake, diabetes, hypertension, and renal insufficiency.\nMultiple linear regression analysis was used to take ad-\nvantage of the full range of values for the outcome variables.\nThe levels of all markers of iron deficiency were logarith-\nmically transformed, and the percent change was obtained\nby retransforming the values to the original scale. The log-\narithmic transformation centered the distribution of data on\nsome markers and simplified the process of estimating dif-\nferences between means, which were expressed as percent\nchange. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to\nmodel the prevalence of iron deficiency (determined to be\npresent or absent using age- and gender-specific cutoff val-\nues). Prevalence odds ratios and their 95 percent confidence\nintervals were calculated in bivariate, stratified, and multi-\nvariate analyses of the association between H. pylori infec-\ntion and iron deficiency, while multiple multinomial logistic\nregression was used to assess the relation between H. pylori\ninfection and a three-level dependent variable: 1) IDA,\n2) anemia from other causes, and 3) no anemia and normal\nvalues for iron-store indicators. Multinomial logistic regres-\nsion allowed us to compare two categories of anemia (IDA\nand anemia from other causes) using a common referent.\nRecords that had missing data on covariates or were not\napplicable (e.g., for missing data on current pregnancy sta-\ntus, females other than those aged 12\u00ad59 years and all males)\nwere treated as a separate category in multivariate analyses.\nTo address the specific question of whether the H. pylori\nassociation was explained by ulcers and bleeding resulting\nfrom this infection, we used data on history of peptic ulcer\ndisease available for the subset of adult NHANES partici-\npants. Specifically, we created a four-level composite expo-\nsure variable that combined H. pylori infection status and\nhistory of peptic ulcer, using persons exposed to neither as\nthe reference category. We assessed effect modification by\nrelevant covariates, such as race/ethnicity, using this com-\nposite exposure variable approach. Statistical interaction\nin the context of linear regression was tested using a chi-\nsquared test for product terms. Population attributable\nfraction estimates of the prevalence of iron deficiency due\nto H. pylori infection were calculated using Greenland\nRESULTS\nIn the study population, 27.1 percent (95 percent confi-\ncent (95 percent CI: 2.7, 4.1) had H. pylori infection, iron\ndeficiency, IDA, and anemia from other causes, respectively.\nThe distribution of the correlates of these three conditions is\nshown in table 1. No results of statistical testing are shown\nin table 1; its main purpose is to depict the patterns of\noccurrence of the dependent and independent variables ac-\ncording to select covariates. H. pylori infection increased\nwith age and was more prevalent among racial/ethnic mi-\nnorities, persons born outside the United States, non-\nbreastfed children, the poor, and persons in the lowest\nquintile of vitamin C intake. The prevalence of iron defi-\nciency was increased among females, ethnic minorities,\npregnant women, and women with multiple previous preg-\nnancies. Some of the stratum-specific estimates of IDAwere\nunreliable because of small numbers; however, increases in\nprevalence were noted among the same groups that experi-\nenced iron deficiency, as well as other subgroups (females\naged 16\u00ad69 years and the foreign-born), while no differen-\nces in the prevalence of IDA were found by poverty income\nratio. Anemia from other causes was more prevalent among\nnon-Hispanic Blacks, non-Mexican-American Hispanics,\npoor persons, women who were currently pregnant or had\nhad previous multiple pregnancies, persons who had been\nmedically diagnosed with diabetes or high blood pressure,\nand persons with serum creatinine levels compatible with\nrenal impairment. We found no relation between iron de-\nficiency/IDA and smoking or regular alcohol intake, and\nthese factors were not considered in further analyses as\ncovariates.\nTable 2 presents the results of multiple linear regression\nanalysis of the biomarkers of iron deficiency. H. pylori in-\nfection was associated with an important decrease in levels\nof serum ferritin across the entire US population, after simul-\ntaneous adjustment for relevant covariates. The associations\nbetween H. pylori infection and other indicators of iron\nstores were of comparatively small magnitude or were null.\nAs table 3 shows, results of the multinomial analysis in-\ndicated that the prevalence of IDA among H. pylori-infected\nparticipants was increased. Point estimates were meaning-\nfully changed by age, gender, ethnicity, and gestational his-\ntory (current and past). In a reduced model, we added\npoverty to these variables as a proxy for socioeconomic\nstatus. The relations between the prevalence of H. pylori\ninfection and IDA were similar in the reduced model after\nadjustment for this set of variables and in the fully adjusted\nmodel. Table 3 also shows the H. pylori infection prevalence\nodds ratio for anemia from other causes: prevalence was\nincreased by 30 percent in both the reduced model and the\nfull model. In addition, after adjustment for all covariates\nvia multiple logistic regression analysis, the prevalence of\niron deficiency increased by 40 percent among H. pylori-\ninfected participants. Measures of association from the re-\nduced model were consistent with such an increase.\nTen percent of US adults reported ever having been di-\nagnosed with peptic ulcers, and half of them tested positive\nfor immunoglobulin G H. pylori antibodies, while 88 per-\ncent of H. pylori-infected adults in our study population had\nno history of medically diagnosed ulcers. The association\nbetween H. pylori infection and iron deficiency/IDA seemed\nslightly stronger among adults who reported a history of\nmedically diagnosed peptic ulcer disease, as shown in table 4,\nwhile serum ferritin levels and prevalences of iron de-\nficiency or IDA among persons with a history of peptic\nulcer disease but without antibodies to H. pylori were\nsimilar to those of persons who had neither H. pylori in-\nfection nor a history of peptic ulcer.\nThe relations between H. pylori infection and iron defi-\nciency and IDA seemed stronger among non-Hispanic\nWhites and persons of other/mixed ethnicity and seemed\nweaker or nonexistent among other persons in other racial/\nethnic groups (data not shown). The percent change in serum\nferritin level associated with H. pylori infection status among\nnon-Hispanic Whites and persons of other race/ethnicity was\n\u00ff21.5 percent, while among non-Hispanic Blacks, Mexican\nAmericans, and other Hispanics, it was 2.9 percent (v2 test\nOn the basis of our findings, if the association was causal,\ncases of iron deficiency in the United States might be related\nto H. pylori infection.\nDISCUSSION\nWe found, in the most current cross-sectional data on the\ninfected persons aged 3 years had a mean serum ferritin\ndeficit of 9 lg/liter. On the basis of quantitative phlebotomy\nstudies (17), this translates to a loss of 72\u00ad90 mg of storage\niron. We found a weak-to-moderate increase in prevalences\nof iron deficiency and IDA among H. pylori-infected per-\nsons in the US population. We also found a weaker increase\nfor anemia from other causes, suggesting that H. pylori\nproduces anemia by altering iron metabolism. Overall, our\ndata suggest that H. pylori may cause microbleeding and/or\naffect iron uptake and thus deplete iron stores in persons\nwith iron deficiency and IDA, independently of ulcer dis-\nease. However, the associations between H. pylori infec-\ntion and iron deficiency and IDA seem to be stronger\namong persons with a history of peptic ulcer, suggesting\nthat ulcers may play a role in that small subpopulation.\nWe did not observe differences in iron deficiency/IDA\nTABLE 2.

The pathogenesis of iron deficiency is likely to be\ncomplex and possibly different in different age groups. For\nexample, in children, iron loss seems likely, whereas in\nelderly persons with atrophic gastritis, low acid secretion\nand reduced gastric juice ascorbic acid could result in im-\npairment of iron absorption.\nOne clinical trial of H. pylori eradication and/or iron sup-\nplementation found an effect on anemia in the H. pylori\neradication treatment group that was comparable to the ef-\nfect in persons who received only iron supplementation (18).\nOur study controlled for several potential confounders of\nthe iron deficiency-H. pylori association. We found no ev-\nidence of confounding by socioeconomic status using the\npoverty income ratio. However, there might still have been\nsome degree of uncontrolled confounding by socioeco-\nnomic status, since this measurement of poverty is based\non current income. Given that approximately one third of\nour sample comprised children under 18 years of age, data\non occupation and education of the head of the household\ncould have provided a better measurement of socioeco-\nnomic status but were not examined in this study. We were\nable to control for major predictors of anemia in the United\nStates, such as age, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status,\ncurrent pregnancy, gestational history, and kidney disease,\nincluding those associated with major chronic diseases\nsuch as diabetes and hypertension. The most important\nconfounder in these data was not socioeconomic status\nbut race/ethnicity. Differences in the H. pylori prevalence\nodds ratios reported here deserve further investigation,\nsince African Americans seem to have lower hemoglobin\nconcentrations (19\u00ad21) after results are controlled for in-\ncome. That could also be the case for Mexican Americans.\nThis issue merits further research. Given the cross-\nsectional nature of this study, caution should be taken\nwhen interpreting the results, particularly since serology\nmay misclassify H. pylori infection status, as it measures\npast status rather than current status. Data on the cytotoxin-\nassociated gene A (cagA) type of H. pylori infection\nlic when we conducted this study. However, at least one\nstudy found the association between IDA and H. pylori to\nbe unrelated to cagA type (19). We did not explore the\npotential relations between infections with other agents\nand iron deficiency, which could possibly have confounded\nthese results. These issues deserve further examination in\nAs Dubois and Kearney (3) have noted, most epidemio-\nlogic studies conducted so far have been cross-sectional.\nTwo of them, carried out in Denmark (22) and Germany\n(23), were national health surveys targeting the adult pop-\nulation. These surveys found decreased levels of serum fer-\nritin among persons infected with H. pylori (22, 23). The\nGerman survey also found a 16 percent decrease in levels of\nserum ferritin among adults (23), while the Danish study\nfound associations among men and postmenopausal women\n(22). Another large cross-sectional study conducted in\nAlaska (24) found that H. pylori infection was associated\nwith decreasing levels of serum ferritin and that this asso-\nciation seemed stronger among adolescents and women of\nchildbearing age. Children and adolescents were also stud-\nied in population-based surveys in South Korea (25\u00ad27);\nthese studies found an association between H. pylori and\niron deficiency. A study conducted in Australia found an\nassociation among women (28), and a cross-sectional study\nconducted in New Zealand reported differences in serum\niron levels among men (29). A recent study of pregnant\nwomen in Germany reported an association between current\nH. pylori infection and hemoglobin levels (30). A recent\nabstract on a cross-sectional study based on NHANES III\ndata also reported significant differences in serum ferritin\nand iron deficiency and IDA by H. pylori infection status\nthat seemed to hold irrespective of cagA type (31), which\nagrees with the results of the German study (23).\nBesides being the most recent large national survey, the\nand pregnant women and used validated indicators of the\nprevalences of iron deficiency and IDA.

Our findings are\nconsistent with those of previous studies that examined the\nassociation between H. pylori infection and serum ferritin\nlevel. It also adds information on the relations between in-\nfection and the prevalences of IDA and anemia from other\ncauses.\nIDA is a condition with important health consequences\nregarding reproduction, immunity, work performance, and\npossibly cognitive development (1). Thirty-five percent of\nthe cases of iron deficiency and 51 percent of the cases of\nIDA in our study population involved H. pylori infection.\nSignificant fractions of the prevalences of iron deficiency\nand IDA (14 percent and 32 percent, respectively) could\nbe related to H. pylori infection. The trend of decreasing\nand its subsequent leveling off (6, 7), does not lead to\na straightforward interpretation of trends in H. pylori infec-\ntion, since it was first measured in NHANES III. Moreover,\nthe prevalence of iron deficiency in our study was based on\nfewer subjects than those of NHANES III, limiting the sta-\ntistical power of comparisons of time trends for specific\nhigh-risk groups. It is possible that the dramatic decline in\nthe prevalence of iron deficiency seen since the 1960s and\n1970s was entirely due to public health interventions that\nfocused on iron supplementation and fortification. Achiev-\ning further declines might require addressing other causes\nof iron deficiency, including infection, such as that from\nH. pylori. The overall evidence is consistent with a continu-\ning decline in H. pylori infection, particularly in developed\ncountries. However, the available data on the prevalence of\nH. pylori infection in the US population are consistent with\na slow decline. This may reflect the significant increase in\nthe number of foreign-born persons, particularly Mexican\nAmericans, who immigrated to the United States in the\n1990s and now constitute the main reservoir of H. pylori\ninfection and related disease in the United States (32, 33).\nEmerging evidence seems to place H. pylori infection next\nto helminthiasis as a communicable cause of anemia (34).\nTherefore, new initiatives designed to further decrease prev-\nalences of iron deficiency and IDA in high-risk groups may\nneed to address the eradication of H. pylori infection, a class\nA carcinogen that also causes peptic ulcer and gastritis.\n"
