The strength of this technique is that it allows\nthe client to consider the moral spectrum from different\nangles, assisted by a listening grid in which values and\nnorms are interrelated, in order to arrive at a moral\nconviction.\nIn this article, we present a modified listening grid, in\nwhich we pay particular attention, alongside the what, to\nhow clients talk about themselves. Do they talk as if they\nwere spectators? Are they aware what this talking does to\nthem? And, in the light of that experience, how do they\nperceive what is good from the past and what they will\nstrive for in the future? By focusing on both the what and\nthe how of this moral talk, clients discover a picture of the\nconviction that will enable them to make a decision.\nMoral Counseling: A Method in\nDevelopment\nMoral counseling is defined as the professional support or\nsupervision of clients when making decisions of which the\noutcome can be justified in moral terms, such as good, just\nor wise. Together with the client, the moral counselor\nexamines what the moral problem is: does it involve a\nchoice or a dilemma, or is there an unavoidable necessity\nto make a decision? This involves looking at what possible\ndecision fits the ``I'' that must be rediscovered. Moral coun-\nseling can therefore definitely be recommended for clients\nwho feel they have to make a decision that does not accord\nwith their self-image \u00ad in short, if the decision to be taken\npropels them into a crisis situation.\nThe authors have considerable experience supervising\nclients faced with difficult healthcare choices: questions\nabout life and death (e.g. abortion, euthanasia, and stopping\ntreatment), questions about suitable intensive-care and\nneonatal treatment, and questions about organ donation\n(De Groot, 2016). But moral counseling can also be used\noutside the healthcare sector, for clients concerned about\nwhat is the moral course of action to take (prospective)\nand whether, seen from the present moment, their actions\nwere the just ones (retrospective).\nOur method is related to Carl Rogers' discussion style\n(client-centered method) (Rogers & Dorfman, 1951;\nRogers, 1966). Rogers' primary focus is the counselor's\nstance (realness, acceptance and respect, and empathic\nunderstanding) (Rogers & Freiberg, 1969). What this\nmeans for actual interventions by counselors became\nclear to us when we began using William Stiles' taxonomy\n(Stiles, 1992) to analyze those interventions.

With these concepts, the\nfocus was on the content of the client's statements, the\nwhat. By reflecting on our courses and counseling practice,\nwe have gained new insights, which Hans Evers describes\nelsewhere as contemplative listening. Using ideas from this\napproach, we look at how clients talk about themselves.\nFollowing Evers' example, we have chosen below to use\nthe terms ``contemplative listening in moral issues'', and\n``auditor'' rather than ``counselor''.\nRogers and Stiles: From Tracking to Providing Space\nWorking in accordance with the method outlined, material\nwas collected in an open, associative interview (Maso &\nSmaling, 1998), in which facts, emotions, attitudes and\nconvictions could be addressed. The principles of client-\ncentered therapy (the therapist's congruence or genuine-\nness, unconditional positive regard, a complete acceptance,\nand a sensitively accurate empathic understanding) were\napplied (Rogers, 1966). Initially, we found all interventions\neffective provided they were of a ``tracking'' nature. We\nstarted by using Stiles to analyze our discussions (Stiles,\n1992). His definitions of the different interventions helped\nus gain a better understanding of the process by which\npeople arrive at their convictions. Stiles also draws attention\nto the intent of an intervention. For example, a question can\narise out of curiosity or judgment on the part of the auditor\n(QQ) , but also from the client's need to check whether the\nreflection provided is correct. In the first instance, the dis-\ncussion agenda is taken over by the auditor, rather than giving\nthe client space to arrive at their own conviction. This led to\na different view of the desired interventions. ``Allowing\nspace'' became the key issue, rather than ``tracking''. We\nopted for a radical application of the interview style that\nStiles describes as ``acquiescence''. Four interventions\n(Edification, Confirmation, "
