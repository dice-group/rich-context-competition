They\nwere also a force to reckon with in community activities;\nhence, they were addressed as Iya Loja (important woman in\nthe market place), Iya laje (astute business woman), Iya lode\n(a female public figure), Erelu (a female chief in Egba land),\nwhich are female chieftaincy titles to eulogize and recognize\nthe various achievements and hard work of women (Ekejiuba,\nSator, 1992). In the pre-colonial era, women in the south-\nwestern region of Nigeria and some other parts had their\nshare of social responsibilities and leadership roles\n(Uwaezuoke & Ezeh, 2008). During colonization, women\nbecame disadvantaged because they were predominantly\nnot-lettered and ill equipped for white- or blue-collar jobs.\n. . .The overall feeble position of female education in comparison\nto the male counterpart did not augur well for the social,\neconomic and political development of women in Nigeria. At a\ntime when literary education was becoming the master key to a\nsuccessful life in modern society, the different agencies\nresponsible for the instruction of the Nigerian youth invested in\nupgrading the formation of boys to the detriment of girls.

Notwithstanding, they are yet to form\ncritical mass at the top; therefore, the social predictors of\nfemale academics' career growth and leadership position in\nthe oldest six south-west Nigerian Universities are examined\nin this study. Studies have indicated that several factors mili-\ntate against the careers of women and their attainment of\nleadership in academia, some of which are sex-harassment\n(African Association of Political Science, 1994; Aina &\nflicts (Oti & Oyelude, 2006), the challenges of being female\nin highly gendered academic institutions (Gaidzanwa 2001;\nMorley, Sorhaindo, & Burke, 2005; Odejide, Akanji, &\nof female academics' career growth and leadership position\nare yet to be explored, especially in Nigerian Universities.\nIn the past two decades, participation of women in higher\nSingh, 2002), but despite this improvement, women still lag\nbehind as academic staff and have slow career advancement\ncompared with that of men (Chesterman, 2004; De la Rey,\nWomen make up about half of the workforce in most devel-\noped countries (United States, Australia, and Canada), yet\nthey occupy less than 5% of senior executive seats (Morley,\nThis implies that while the women are flooding the manage-\nrial pipeline, their efforts to attain the most senior levels are\nbeing blocked (Rindfleish, 2002). Rindfleish argued that\nwomen's participation in paid workforce has been one of the\nmost remarkable social changes over the past 40 years, yet\nwomen are excluded from the most senior positions within\norganizations and executive boards; Chovwen (2004) and\nKamau (2004) also drew similar conclusions. According to\nSingh (2002), women make up less than three quarters of the\nacademic staff of Universities, and are less than 10% among\nthe very top position. This study however examines the pre-\ndictive nature of social support variables: attitudes toward\nwomen; spousal, parental, and collegial support to the career\ngrowth; and leadership of female academics in Nigerian\nUniversities.\nLiterature Review\nThe literature reviews past studies on social support and its\ninfluence on the careers of women in general and academic\nwomen to be specific.\nSocial Support and Women's Career\nSocial support has been defined as the \"actions of others that\nare either helpful or intended to be helpful\" (Deelstra et al.,\namong workers that enhance individuals' psychological or\nbehavioral functioning. These may include mentoring, pro-\nviding emotional support, assisting others with assigned\ntasks, and teaching about social power structures (Hill,\nBahniuk, Dobos, & Rouner, 1989). Beginning with the earli-\nest need-fulfillment theories of job satisfaction, social sup-\nport has been identified as a predictor of job satisfaction\nSocial support also predicts a variety of negative out-\ncomes, including absenteeism and turnover (Winstead,\nDerlega, Montgomery, & Pilkington, 1995), burnout\n(Myung-Yong & Harrison, 1998), and depression and anxi-\nety (El-Bassel, Guterman, Bargal, & Su, 1998; Olson &\nShultz, 1994). Findings may be mixed because the construct\nof social support is multifaceted (Bahniuk, Dobos, & Hill,\n1990). The source of support may be a supervisor, mentor, or\ncolleague, spouse, and parents or parent figure. The content\nof the support may include information, appraisal, assistance\nwith tasks, or emotional support (Bahniuk et al., 1990;\nSpousal and Parental Support\nHarris, Winskowski, and Engdahl (2007) found perceived\nspousal support and workplace social support to predict job\nsatisfaction and job tenure. Scott and King (1985) found that\nspousal support is a predictor of whether women college stu-\ndents will return to school, while Cutrona and Suhr (1994)\nand Derlega, Barbee, and Winstead (1994) found that lack of\nsocial support is a predictor of negative outcomes, including\nabsenteeism, burnout, depression, and anxiety.\nThough family issues have been found to interfere in the\ncareers of men and women, Colletti, Mulholland, and Sonnad\n(2000) found social and family issues to be a major concern\nfor both male and female academic surgeons. However, both\nmen and women report differences in the conflict between\nfamily and career responsibilities and perceptions of balanc-\ning those responsibilities for men and women. Two thirds of\nmen and women reported that the demands of their surgical\nfaculty position adversely affect their relationships with\nspouses. Men reported a slightly higher tendency to miss\nfamily activities because of job demands (35 [77%] vs. 6\n[67%]), while women were significantly more likely to miss\nwork activities because of family responsibilities (5 [56%]\nIn addition, women have been known to be caregivers\nwhy they have excelled in careers like Nursing, secretarial\nprofession, and teaching at lower levels. Studies have also\naffirmed that they give support to their spouses, children, and\nHammed, & Awaebe, 2010), but women themselves lack the\nnecessary support that may be required to foster the growth\nthey need in their different careers and life's endeavors\nstrong determinant of career progression of female academ-\nics in a university in Nigeria, the career mobility of these\nacademic women is slower; they begin to have full concen-\ntration and career mobility as their children become more\nmature and able to take care of themselves.\nA study found that mothers are the most critical influence\nfor developing leadership qualities and readiness in their\ndaughters during their upbringing (Matz, 2002). Contrary to\nMatz's finding, fathers are also influential for girls and young\nwomen in the development of leadership competencies\nWomen's Career and Collegiality\nSignificant among the factors influencing women's career\nare workplace and collegial supports, which have been iden-\ntified as important factors in job satisfaction (Harris et al.,\n2007). A small but growing body of literature has identified\nthat supportive work environments are important factors that\ninfluence tenure achievement for faculty (Young & Wright,\n2001). Specifically, support (or lack thereof) from colleagues\nand deans or departments heads has been identified as an\ninfluential piece of the tenure process (Ifedi, 2008; Olson &\ngeography professors, findings indicated that all faculty\nmembers benefit significantly from supportive collegial\nenvironments and supportive department chairpersons\nThe role of collegial support specifically relating to par-\nenting academics who are seeking tenure has been investi-\ngated (O'Laughlin & Bischoff, 2005; Young & Wright,\n2001). Recent qualitative and quantitative work has exam-\nined how departmental support for balancing dual roles is\ndifferently experienced by men and women on the tenure\ntrack (O'Laughlin & Bischoff, 2005; Grant, Kennelly, &\ners on the tenure track, Young and Wright found that moth-\ners perceived their experiences in the tenure-making process\nto be very different from their non-mother colleagues. In\nthis qualitative study of 22 mothers, respondents reported\nfeeling as though their colleagues questioned their abilities\nto be productive or competitive when compared with non-\nparenting colleagues, while respondents also reported feel-\ning that parenting and non-parenting men were not subjected\nto the same degree of judgment or scrutiny. One third of the\nrespondents also reported that they lacked support from\ncolleagues.\nSome findings validate the claim that universities in\nwhich female academics achieve senior positions are those in\nwhich some supportive practices toward women exist. For\ninstance, Chesterman (2004) sought to verify if five\nAustralian universities where women achieved promotion,\nand remained in senior positions, had particular cultural\ncharacteristics that supported and sustained women.\nUniversities around Australia had been encouraged by gov-\nernment equity legislation to adopt a proactive measure\ntoward the promotion of women into senior management.\nAcross all five universities, there was unanimity about the\nfactors that encouraged women to apply for senior positions\nand that sustained and supported them in those positions.\nThese were clear supports from organizational leaders, a\ncritical mass of other women in senior positions, opportuni-\nties to network, and strong statements on values. Those inter-\nviewed indicated that the most significant support was that\nfrom the chief executive or the direct superior to the woman.\nExecutives had to go beyond rhetoric, and demonstrate their\nsupport of women and equity through endorsement of wom-\nen's performance, encouragement of women to apply for\npromotion, and commitment of resources to development,\nsuch as training courses.\nCollegial support includes sharing friendships, personal\nproblems, and confidences. Bahniuk et al. (1990) found that,\namong business managers, instrumental support from col-\nleagues and mentoring predicted higher levels of job satis-\nfaction, along with perceived success, managerial level, and\nincome. The relationship between workplace social support\nand the length of time an employee chooses to remain at the\nsame job (job tenure) has recently been explored. Positive\nrelationships with supervisors have been reported to strongly\npredict job tenure (Buckingham & Coffman, 1999; Van\nBreukelen, Van Der Vlist, & Steensma, 2004; Vecchio &\n4 SAGE Open\nBoatwright, 2002). Collegial support, mentoring, and career\nshadowing have also been found to be rewarding, and deter-\nminants of job satisfaction and leadership especially for\njunior female academics (Eliason, Berggren, & Bondestam,\nand collegial support, another factor that influences women's\ncareer is societal attitude toward their career life and leader-\nship influence.\nAttitudes Toward Women in Career\nand Leadership\nResearch has reiterated that general attitudes of superiors and\nsubordinates to women in career and leadership position are\nTherefore, many women in male-dominated careers suffer\nisolation, rejection, and opposition (Chovwen, 2004; Kamau,\n2004). Those who have sufficient social support are more\nlikely to progress faster and succeed than those who do not\nSome studies affirmed that academic women face overt\nand covert discriminatory practices and micro-politics in the\nuniversity system (De la Rey, 1998; Odejide, Akanji, &\nOdekunle, 2006), which undermines their career growth, vis-\nibility, and space in decision-making positions. Is this atti-\ntude cultural or universal?\nTheoretical Framework\nThis study is grounded in the Role Congruity Theory\nadvanced by Eagly and Karau (2002). Role congruity theory\nof prejudice toward female leaders proposes that perceived\nincongruity between the female gender and leadership roles\nleads to two forms of prejudice: (a) perceiving women less\nfavorably than men as potential occupants of leadership roles\nand (b) evaluating behavior that fulfills the prescriptions of a\nleader role less favorably when it is enacted by a woman.\nOne consequence is that attitudes are less positive toward\nfemale than male leaders and potential leaders. Other conse-\nquences are that it is more difficult for women to become\nleaders and achieve success in leadership roles. Evidence\nfrom varied research paradigms substantiates that these con-\nsequences occur, especially in situations that heighten per-\nceptions of incongruity between the female gender and\nleadership roles.\nResearch has shown that women who attain success in\ntypically male occupations are less liked and more derogated\nthan equally successful men (Chovwen, 2004; Heilman,\nWallen, Fuchs, & Tamkins, 2004). This disfavor can have\nnegative effects on females' career outcomes, as women at\nthe upper levels of management receive fewer promotions\nthan comparable men (Heilman et al., 2004). Research shows\nthat \"a woman's success can create new problems for her by\ninstigating her social rejection\" (Chovwen, 2004; Heilman\ndence to why women do not gain social support in careers\nand leadership; parents may be scared that success will bring\ntheir daughters social rejection, husbands' perception of\ninsecurity, and fear of role reversal and colleagues' fear of\ncompetition from the \"weaker sex\" (Kamau, 2004).\nMethodology\nResearch Design\nThis study adopts a descriptive research design of the ex-post\nfacto type. Close-ended questionnaires were constructed to\nelicit responses from respondents.\nPopulation\nThe population of study included 511 female academics\nfrom graduate assistant to professor and 300 male academics\nin the senior cadre in six universities in south-west Nigeria.\nResearch Instruments\nThree research instruments were used to collect data for the\nstudy. They were as follows:\n1. Social Factors Instruments: Comprising four ques-\ntionnaires: (a) Spousal support questionnaire (devel-\noped by the researcher). Respondents were female\nacademics; questions were 17 close-ended items.\nQuestions centered on the kind of support female\nacademics receive from their husbands, for example,\n\"my husband baby sits, does school run, takes care of\nthe children when I'm away, goes to the market, sup-\nports me financially, and so on.\" (b) Parental influ-\nence questionnaire was developed by the researcher.\nRespondents were female academics; questions were\n18 close-ended items, which elicited the kind of rap-\nport/relationship female academics had with their\nparents or locus parentis in retrospect and the influ-\nence it has on their career, for example, \"my father/\nmother had high expectation of me,\" \"my father/\nmother instilled in me a love for learning,\" \"my\nfather/mother believed that having a career for a\nwoman was very important.\" (c) Academic men col-\nlegial support (developed by the researcher). These\nwere 16 close-ended items. It elicited responses from\nmale academics on their working relationship with\ntheir female colleagues, some of the statements were\n\"I have excellent working relations with my female\ncolleagues,\" \"I like my female superiors,\" and so on\n(d) Academic men attitude toward women (adapted\nfrom Spence & Helmrich, 1978) scales. It comprised\n19 close-ended statements. This was meant to mea-\nsure the general attitude of male academics toward\nwomen, which is either egalitarian or traditional,\nsuch as women should take increasing responsibility\nfor leadership in solving intellectual and social prob-\nlems, husband and wife should be allowed the same\ngrounds for divorce, a woman should not expect to\nhave quite the same freedom as a man, and so on.\n2. Academic Women's Career Growth Questionnaire\n(Developed by the Researcher): This comprises 13\nstatements such as \"my university encourages the use\nof personal initiative on the job,\" \"my personal career\ngrowth is stunted because I have not met the demand\nof publishing scholarly articles,\" \"career growth in\nthe university system favors men more than women,\nand so on.\"\n3. Academic Women's Perception of Leadership Position\nQuestionnaire (Developed by the Researcher): These\nare 16-item statements which elicited responses from\nfemale academics. Some of which are \"leadership\ntakes one away from research and publication, so I\nwould rather not lead\"; \"I prefer leadership in teach-\ning to administrative leadership\"; and \"leadership\nrequires too much politics which I am not prepared\nfor.\"\nProcedure and Sampling Techniques of the Study\nA multi-stage sampling technique was used for the study.\nThe first stage involved the listing of all-approved federal-\nand state-funded universities in Nigeria and the extraction\nand stratification of Universities in south west of the country,\nsix oldest universities in each state of the south-western\nNigeria were purposively selected. This was under the\nassumption that they will have adequate number of academic\nwomen needed for the sample, as critical mass of female\npopulation as academics is still difficult to come by.\nIncidentally, the oldest universities in the region are four fed-\neral and two state universities out of five federal and nine\nstate universities in the southwest as at the time of data col-\nlection; this represents 45% of the university population at\nthe time of data collection. Questionnaires were adminis-\ntered to 600 female academics from assistant lecturer to pro-\nfessor. They were purposively selected because they were\nthe major focus of the study. Proportionate stratified random\nsampling was used in their selection from each of the\nUniversities. However, 511 questionnaires were returned and\nanalyzed for the female academics. Three hundred male aca-\ndemics from senior lecturer to professor were disproportion-\nately selected (50 from each university) under the assumption\nthat they are colleagues of academic women. Two hundred\nand ninety-seven of these were returned and analyzed.\nReliability and Data Analysis\nThe reliability of the instruments was determined through a\npilot study of 50 randomly selected respondents from two\nprivately owned universities. Reliability coefficient was\nobtained using Cronbach's alpha: social, r = 0.87; career\ngrowth, r = 0.79; and academic leadership questionnaires,\nr = 0.84. Data were analyzed using multiple regression.\nResearch Questions\nResearch Question 1: What are the composite effects of\nsocial predictors (parental influence, spousal and aca-\ndemic men collegial support, and attitudes toward women)\non female academics'(a) career growth and (b) leadership\nposition?\nResearch Question 2: What are the relative contributions\nof social predictors (parental influence, spousal and col-\nlegial support, and attitudes toward women) to female\nacademics' (a) career growth and (b) leadership position?\nResearch Question 3: To what extent would social pre-\ndictors (parental influence, spousal and collegial support,\nand attitudes toward women) predict female academics'\n(a) career growth and (b) leadership position?\nResults\nResearch Question 1a\nWhat is the composite effect of the social variables (parental\ninfluence, spousal and collegial support, and attitudes toward\nwomen) on female academics' career growth?\nFrom Table 1, parental influence has a negative and weak\nrelationship which is significant with career growth\n(R = -.175; p < .05). The table also shows that spousal sup-\nport has a positive, weak, and significant relationship with\nthe dependant measure (R = .162; p < .05). However, colle-\ngial support (R = .028; p > .05) and attitude toward women\n(R = .054; p > .05) have very weak positive relationship,\nwhich are not significant with career growth. To determine\nthe composite effect of the four social variables on career\ngrowth, Table 2 is presented.\nTable 2 shows that the four social factors parental influ-\nence, spousal support, collegial support, and attitude toward\nwomen jointly correlate positively with career growth (R =\nance in career growth is due to the four social factors leaving\nthe remaining 93.2% to other factors and residuals.

The\ncomposite effect is presented in Table 5.\nTable 5 shows that the four social factors parental influ-\nence, spousal support, collegial support, and attitudes toward\nwomen have positive multiple relationship with female aca-\ndemics' leadership position (R = .480). Also, the R2 value of\n.230 indicates that they could explain 23.0% of the variance\nin leadership positions. The remaining 77.0% is due to other\nfactors and residuals. This composite effect is tested for sig-\nnificance on Table 6.\nTable 6 shows that the composite effect of the social fac-\ntors as indicated by the R value of .830 is significant (F =\nTherefore, social factors have significant composite effect on\nfemale academics leadership positions.\nResearch Question 2a\nWhat are the relative contributions of parental influence,\nspousal and collegial support, and attitudes toward women to\nfemale academics' career growth?\nTable 7 shows that parental influence made the greatest\ncontribution to female academics' career growth ( = .197;\np < .05). This is a significant contribution. Spousal support is\nnext in decreasing magnitude ( = .183; p < .05). This is also\na significant contribution. The third on the list in the order is\nthe contribution of attitude toward women ( = .078; p > .05)\nwhile the lowest contribution is that made by collegial sup-\nport ( = .016; p > .05). These two factors made no signifi-\ncant contributions to female academics' career growth.\nResearch Question 2b\nWhat are the relative contributions of the social factors\nparental influence, spousal and collegial support, and atti-\ntudes toward women to female academics' leadership\nposition?\nTable 8 shows that attitude toward women made the great-\nest contribution to leadership position ( = .428; p > .05).\nThis is followed by collegial support ( = .419; p < .05),\nparental influence ( = .368; P < .05), and spousal support (\n= .250; p < .05) in that order. All these contributions are\nsignificant.\nResearch Question 3a\nTo what extent would the social variables parental influence,\nspousal and collegial support, and attitudes toward women\npredict female academics' career growth?\nFrom Table 7, both parental influence (B = -.112;\nTable 1.

This study has gone\nfurther to show that apart from being a predictor of job satis-\nfaction and other variables, social support is a predictor of\ncareer growth. It also predicts whether a woman will seek\nleadership position or not.\nContrary to the submission of Winstead et al. (1995), who\nfound that social support predicted burnout (Myung-Yong &\nHarrison, 1998), depression, and anxiety, (El-Bassel et al.,\nwho had spousal and parental support in retrospect have\nmore confidence to perform leadership roles and advance\nbetter in their career than those who do not.\nThis study agrees with Harris et al. (2007) on spousal sup-\nport predicting job satisfaction and tenure, but disagrees with\nworkplace social support as predictors of job satisfaction and\njob tenure. This is because spousal support predicted career\ngrowth and leadership position, while collegial support and\nattitude toward women could not predict women's career\ngrowth, but predicted leadership position. This could be due\nto the fact that leadership position is more political and elec-\ntive; therefore, women would need the physical support of\nthe male majority, whereas they need more of individual hard\nwork, resilience, and the spirit of competition to grow in\ntheir career, they also require understanding and the support\nof their husband at the home-front for them to have signifi-\ncant growth.\nThis study corroborate earlier findings which reiterate\nthat general attitudes of superiors and subordinates to women\nin career and leadership position are most of the time unwel-\nbeen found to affect women negatively. This study found\nattitude toward women and academic men's collegial\nTable 4.

This\nresearch found the above to be true, as women could grow in\ntheir career as long as they are able to meet requirements for\npromotion through hard work; but negative attitudes and\nlack of support affect their reaching leadership position. On\nthe other hand, they may attain leadership through their\nefforts but may not receive the necessary acceptance and\nMoreover, negative attitudes and lack of spousal support\nmight also count against their candidacy if they are seeking\nelective positions in a male-dominated career, because men\nas well as jealous women will not vote for them (Odejide,\nImplications for Women in Career and\nLeadership\nIt is pertinent to note that though women are entering into\nacademics in significant numbers, they are still a minority.\nFurthermore, the culture of academics is still very much dic-\ntated by male hegemony. Aside from these, the lives of\nfemale academics is also shaped and greatly influenced by\nculture and their experiences in the home. This can go a long\nway to determine how far they go in aspiring to lead or sus-\ntaining leadership position. Women's desire and aspiration to\nlead is shaped by the kind of relationship they have with their\nparents, this goes a long way in building their self-confi-\ndence. Moreover, if women really desire to lead, especially\nin a male-dominated environment, they must learn the rules\nof the game. They must learn how to gain the support of their\nmale colleagues who are in the majority, bearing in mind the\npatriarchal culture of Nigerian men wanting to dominate\neven when they are less qualified.\nConclusion\nThis research investigated whether social support which\ncomprises four variables would predict female academics'\ncareer growth and leadership position. It was found that as a\nwhole, social support predicted career growth and leadership\nposition. However, when taken independently, two of the\nvariables, spousal support and parental influence, were sig-\nnificant in the prediction of career growth and leadership\nposition. Notwithstanding, all four independent variables\n(spousal support, parental influence, academic men collegial\nsupport, and attitude toward women) predicted leadership\npositions. This means that women academics were prepared\nfor the odds the occupation offered, being in a male-domi-\nnated occupation, though their career is generally slower\ncompared with their male academics due to the pressure\nfrom marriage, childbearing, and rearing. They are in no way\ninferior intellectually to their male colleagues. Academic\nwomen are reluctant leaders because they view leadership\nfrom a different perspective and nurse the fear of failure. It\nwas concluded that academic women need to seek the\nsupport of spouses. Parents need to encourage their female\nchildren to aspire against all social odds. Academic men\nneed to change their stereotype behavior toward their female\ncolleagues.\nFraught with limitations emanating from the small sam-\nple, the miniature geographical location of south-western\nNigeria and the limitation of the universities to Federal and\nState alone, nonetheless, the results of this study is valid.\nThey provide a significant insight into the predictive nature\nof social support variable to female academics' career grow\nand leadership positions. Future research can compare the\ncareer growth and leadership positions of never-married\nfemale academics and the married; this is with the view of\nfinding out the influence of marital status on women's career.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research and/or authorship of this article: The research is an\nexcerpt from the dissertation writing grant supported by The\nCouncil for the Development of Social Science Research in Africa\n(CODESRIA) Small Grant for Thesis Writing, November, 2008.\nReferences\nAfrican Association of Political Science.
