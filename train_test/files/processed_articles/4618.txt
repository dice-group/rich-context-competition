    "abstract": "Abstract. The silhouette illusion published online a number of years ago by the Japanese Flash\ndesigner Nobuyuki Kayahara has received substantial attention from the online community. One\nfeature that seems to make it interesting is an apparent rotational bias: Observers see it spinning\nmore often clockwise than counter-clockwise. Here, we show that this rotational bias is in fact due to\nthe visual system's preference for viewpoints from above rather than from below.\nVisual perception is riddled with ambiguities. In most cases they are resolved by means\nof firm assumptions about the regularities of the visual world. Some of these are very well\nknown and appear in every textbook on visual perception. For instance, most students of\npsychology are familiar with the demonstrations of bumps that change into troughs (and\nvice versa) when turned upside down--the switch in perceived relief being due to the visual\nsystem's very reasonable assumption that light normally comes from above rather than from\nOther visual heuristics have not achieved the same degree of visibility even though their\neffects are at least as significant as the `light-from-above' heuristic. To this latter category\nbelongs the `viewing-from-above' (VFA) bias. It has been described in many different contexts,\nbut never explicitly enough to make it into textbooks and become established in the general\nawareness of students and scholars of vision science. This bias can affect the ambiguity\nof a Necker cube and other inherently depth-ambiguous figures to a degree at which their\nperception becomes virtually unambiguous.\nThe ambiguity inherent in a Necker cube can be interpreted in terms of the two possible\nviewpoints from which the cube can be looked at. Observers tend to choose the viewpoint\nthat looks at the object from above rather than from below. The origin of this insight remains\nobscure. Kornmeier et al (2009) write that \"It is well known that the cube-front-side bottom\nis the preferred initial percept of most observers\", but none of the papers they cite in that\nfound, though, in more recent publications. Sundareswara and Schrater (2008) report that for\nlong exposures of Necker cubes the view-from-above interpretation is seen about 60% of the\ntime. For very short presentations, the preference is almost 100%, a result that fits our own\nfrom-above bias for line drawings of surface shapes. Ooi et al (2001) provide experimental\nevidence that relative height in the visual field is used as a depth cue, which in turn implies\nthe viewing-from-above assumption.\nHere, we want to show that the VFA bias also explains `rotational' biases in the Silhouette\nIllusion, which has been created by Japanese artist Nobuyuki Kayahara and was published\n\u00b6 Author to whom all correspondence should be addressed.\nFigure 1. Mean and standard errors of the mean of the percentage of `counter-clockwise' responses as\na function of camera elevation. Each of the 21 subjects was presented with a total of 196 trials. Each\ntrial showed an orthographically projected wireframe cube rotating at 45 deg/s counter-clockwise\nabout a vertical axis. Presentation time was 0.5 s with intertrial intervals of 2 s. The initial azimuthal\nviewpoint was randomized, but camera elevation changed systematically and adopted values between\n-30 and +30 deg. Note that switching the direction of rotation of the 3D cube has the same effect on\nthe 2D stimulus as switching the sign of the camera elevation does. For instance, a counter-clockwise\nrotating cube rendered with a camera at -30 deg elevation results in the same stimulus as the clockwise\nrotating cube rendered with +30 deg camera elevation. Observers clearly prefer the interpretation that\nassumes a view from above.\nonline on his website in 2003 (http://www.procreo.jp/labo/silhouette.swf). It shows the silhouette\nof the static figure of a female dancer pirouetting about a vertical axis. The dancer stands on\none foot and stretches out the other. Like a Necker cube and other depth-ambiguous figures,\nthis silhouette can be interpreted as spinning either clockwise or counter-clockwise (Wallach\nSince it was first published, Kayahara's silhouette illusion has travelled the Internet quite\nextensively, and it appears in the context of all sorts of weird theories and applications (for\ninstance, as a `test' to distinguish `right-brainers' from `left-brainers'). One feature that may\nhave sparked some of these ideas is the fact that, even though both spinning directions can\nbe seen, it is more often perceived to rotate clockwise than counter-clockwise. An online poll\nfridays_tk421_why_cant.php) reports that about two thirds of the 1600 people who answered\nthe poll see the dancer spinning clockwise and only one third counter-clockwise.\nLooking at the animation carefully reveals that the direction from which it is rendered\nis not exactly perpendicular to the axis of rotation. Tracking the tip of the outstretched\nfoot frame by frame results in an ellipse with an aspect ratio of 0.12, which translates into a\ncamera viewpoint of either 6.8 deg above or below a horizontal plane. Assuming orthographic\nprojection, the ambiguity between the spinning direction, on the one hand, and the sign\nof the camera elevation, on the other hand, can not be resolved. Therefore, the observed\nclockwise bias could as well be due to a VFA bias (figure 2).\nTo test this hypothesis, we recreated the silhouette animation using different camera\nelevations and measured the percentage of time in which the two possible percepts were\nseen, as well as the number of reversals that occurred. We also varied the speed with which\nthe figure is spinning in order to cover the wide range of spinning speeds at which the\nsilhouette illusion appears on the Internet.\nFigure 2. The middle column shows four frames of the rotating silhouette of a human figure. The\nsequence can be interpreted in two ways, depending on the perceived order of the surfaces of the body\nin depth. The left column illustrates the interpretation in which we look at the figure's back in the first\nframe. As a consequence, the figure rotates clockwise as we go though the sequence of frames (from\ntop to bottom), and we look at it from a slightly elevated viewpoint (10 deg). In the right column we\nillustrate the other interpretation. We look at the front of the figure in the first frame, the figure rotates\ncounter-clockwise, and the viewpoint is 10 deg from below. An animated version of this illustration\ncan be found at http://www.biomotionlab.ca/projects/depthambiguity.php.\nKayahara's orignal silhouette was based on a model provided by the commercially\navailable rendering software Poser. We also used Poser (version 8, Smith Micro Inc.) and\npicked from the current version a model that was as similar as possible to the one used by\nKayahara: The figure of a young woman adopting the same pose as Kayahara's dancer. The\nfigure was rendered orthographically from four different viewpoints, which only differed in\ncamera elevation: +10 deg (ie, 10 deg from above), +3 deg, -3 deg, and \u00ad10 deg. In addition,\nwe generated versions of the stimulus with three different spinning speeds: 25 deg/s, 100\ndeg/s, and 175 deg/s. Combining the two factors, our experiment contained a total of 12\ndisplays. All renderings showed a black silhouette on a white background.\nThe 3D figure used to render the 2D stimuli was always rotated counter-clockwise. Note,\nhowever, that rendering a clockwise spinning figure with a camera looking from above would\nhave created exactly the same sequence of images as our rendering with the camera from\nbelow looking at a counter-clockwise spinning figure. Likewise, a clockwise spinning figure\nshown from below is the same as a counter-clockwise spinning figure rendered from above.\nEach of the 24 participants in the study was presented with each of the 12 displays once.\nAccounting for potential order effect, we created 24 different orders based on a Latin square\nlogic.\nA single trial lasted 4 min. During the whole duration of the trial, subjects had to keep\npressing one of two keys in order to indicate when the figure appeared to be spinning\nclockwise and when it was spinning counter-clockwise. When either no key was pressed or\nboth keys were pressed, an unpleasant warning sound reminded the observer to keep exactly\none key pressed.\nFigure 3 shows data from one observer to illustrate typical behaviour and data analysis.\nIf the camera is elevated 10 deg with respect to horizontal, this observer sees the figure\nspinning counter-clockwise for 60% of the time. That also means he sees the figure from\nabove for about 60% of the time. When rendered with a camera looking from 10 deg below\nthe horizontal, he sees the figure rotating clockwise (and therefore from above) again for 60%\nof the time. The symmetry between these two cases indicates that this observer shows no\nrotational bias--neither clockwise nor counter-clockwise. The VFA bias is expressed in terms\nof the slope of the linear regression fitted to the data. In the case of this particular observer,\nthis slope is 0.015 deg-1 on average over the three spinning speeds. The number of reversals\nhe experienced averaged to 3.4 reversals per minute.\nFigure 3. Data from a single, typical observer. Separately for the three different rotation speeds, we\nplotted the percentage of time during which the observer pressed the key indicating counter-clockwise\nrotation. Camera elevations are indicated with respect to a counter-clockwise rotating 3D figure. The\nviewing-from-above bias is quantified in terms of the slope of linear functions fitting the data. Blue: 25\ntest). A two way ANOVA revealed no effects of rotation speed. The proportion of time seeing\nthe figure spinning clockwise was 0.508 (sem 0.012) , again with no effects of rotation speed.\nOn average, observers experienced 3.68 reversals per minute (sem 0.25). This frequency was\nnot affected by rotation speed, but we found somewhat less reversals if the camera elevation\nThe average slope of 0.012 deg-1 predicts that at a camera elevation of \u00b1 6.8 degrees,\nthe one used in Kayahara's original silhouette illusion, we should see a `rotational bias' that\nfavors one over the other spinning direction at a rate of 58.2 %. The value of 66% reported in\nthe online poll is even larger, which is most likely due to much shorter exposure durations.\nAt least for the Necker cube, it has been shown that the VFA bias is much more pronounced\nfor the initial percept and then reduces to smaller values for longer stimulus exposures\n(Sundareswara and Schrater 2008). At 4 reversals per minute, the initial percept probably\ndominates the data obtained in online studies like the one cited above.\nLast but not least, we should say that Kayahara's original silhouette is in fact a much richer\nstimulus than it seems. Being a silhouette it is depth-ambiguous because it lacks any cues\nfrom self-occlusion. On the other hand, it does contain two subtle depth cues--however,\nwith conflicting information. Tracing the end of the outstretched hand shows that the camera\nelevation with respect to the hand is only 6.0 deg, which is a little less than the value for\nthe foot. That means that the figure was rendered with a perspective camera positioned\nabout 75 meters away from the figure (assuming a vertical distance of 1 m between foot and\nhand). According to this perspective cue, the view from above and therefore the clockwise\nrotation is the `true' rotation. However, another cue to the rotation of the figure is provided\nby the shadow the feet cast on the ground. The ellipse circumscribed by the shadow of the\noutstretched foot--at least assuming that the ground is horizontal and that we are looking at\nit from above--clearly suggests counter-clockwise rotation. There are good reasons for the\nappeal that Kayahara's silhouette figure has experienced in the media.\nThe main purpose of this study was to rectify the mystery that has developed around the\nsilhouette illusion as it gained tremendous public attention as a tool to `probe your brain' on\nthe Internet. Reports of rotational biases for silhouettes or Necker cubes appear regularly\neven at established conferences on visual perception (as could be experienced at ECVP in\nLausanne this year). If the viewing-from-above bias would have received the same awareness\nand visibility as the light-from-above bias this would have been very unlikely to happen.\nAcknowledgements.
