We investigated whether in unstable angina with marked immune system activation a selective upregulation\nof the circulating T-cell renin\u00adangiotensin system, modulated by angiotensin II, could occur.\nMethods: We studied 13 unstable angina patients, 10 patients with stable angina and 10 healthy subjects. After\nT-lymphocyte isolation, mRNAs for angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1-R)\nwere quantified at baseline and after angiotensin II stimulation. ACE activity in cell pellet and supernatant and angiotensin\nII cell content were measured.\nResults: Plasma renin activity was similar in controls, stable and unstable angina patients. At baseline ACE and AT1-R\nmRNA levels were higher (P<0.05) in T cells from unstable angina patients than in T cells from stable angina patients and\ncontrols, and further increased after angiotensin II addition to cultured T cells. ACE activity of unstable angina T cells\nwas significantly higher than that of T cells from controls and stable angina patients. Only in T cells from unstable angina\npatients did angiotensin II stimulation cause the almost complete release of ACE activity in the supernatant.\nConclusions: The circulating T-cell-based renin\u00adangiotensin system from unstable angina patients was selectively\nupregulated. In vivo unstable angina T cells could locally increase angiotensin II concentration in tissues where they\nmigrate independently of the circulating renin\u00adangiotensin system.\n",

In previous studies1 we demonstrated that in patients\nwith unstable angina the cardiac RAS is activated and sus-\ntains an increased de novo production of cardiac angiotensin\n(Ang) II. Upregulated cardiac RAS participates in the coro-\nnary microvessel inflammation of unstable angina and\nstrengthens the immunomediated component of myocardial\ninflammation. Indeed, in unstable angina myocardium-\npositive immunostaining for angiotensin-converting enzyme\n(ACE) co-localised with T cells and endothelial cells. In\nagreement with this finding, experimental and human stud-\nies showed that Ang II may be produced by T cells that are\nfully equipped with RAS components and specifically can\nexpress the gene for key components of the RAS, such as\nACE and angiotensinogen.2\u00ad4 According to these findings,\nAng II acts on and is produced by inflammatory cells,5 can\naffect T-cell behaviour by angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1-\nR) and induce cellular interferon-gamma (IFN-) secretion\nand interleukin 2 production.6 T-cell RAS is functionally\nPersistent and selective upregulation of\nrenin\u00adangiotensin system in circulating\nT lymphocytes in unstable angina\nMirella Coppo, Manuela Bandinelli, Marco Chiostri,\nLoredana Poggesi and Maria Boddi\n Keywords\nAngiotensin-converting enzyme, angiotensin II, T cell, unstable angina, renin\u00adangiotensin system\nDepartment of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University of\nFlorence, Italy\nCorresponding author:\nMirella Coppo, Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine,\nUniversity of Florence, Largo Brambilla 3, 50134 Florence, Italy.\nEmail: mirella.coppo@unifi.it\nOriginal Article\n2 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System\nautonomous from circulating and various tissue-based RAS\nand can synthesise Ang II that acts as a positive feedback\nloop on inflammatory cells to amplify the inflammatory\nreaction further.7\u00ad9 In our previous paper we showed that in\nhypertensive patients with low grade inflammation the T-cell\nRAS response to Ang II is amplified in comparison with T\ncells from controls and hypertensive individuals without\ninflammation. Our findings gave strong support to the\nhypothesis that T-cell RAS activity was strictly related to\ninflammatory lymphocyte activation. In unstable angina\npatients, circulating T cells are activated and sustain the\nacute systemic inflammation that precipitates plaque insta-\nbility. Serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) is\na sensitive indicator of inflammation, which is closely related\nto the progress of plaque and markedly increases in acute\ncoronary syndrome (ACS). The increase in hs-CRP is slight\nor absent in patients with stable coronary plaques. Up to\nnow, no data are available about the behaviour of circulating\nT-cell RAS of patients withACS or stable angina. This study\nwas aimed at investigating whether an activation of cell-\nbased RAS could be present in circulating T cells from\npatients with unstable or stable angina with increased or nor-\nmal hs-CPR levels. We also investigated whether in vitro the\naddition of Ang II could stimulate or inhibit cultured T-cell\nRAS from unstable or stable angina patients.\nMaterials and methods\nWe examined 13 patients with unstable angina in classes\nIIB (n=5) and IIIB (n=8) and 10 patients with stable angina\nin Canadian classes II (n=4) and III (n=6), who had been\nadmitted to the cardiological intensive therapy unit of\nCareggi Teaching Hospital, Florence, Italy.\nWe excluded those patients on ACE inhibitors and/or\nAng II receptor antagonists and those with acute or chronic\ndiseases accompanied by evidence of circulating RAS acti-\nvation. Ten subjects in apparent good health comparable for\nage and sex to unstable and stable angina patients formed\nthe control group.\nThe protocol of the study complies with the principle of\nthe Helsinki declaration and was approved by the ethical\ncommittee of our institution. All patients gave written\ninformed consent to participate and to have blood samples\ntaken for the study.\nThe main demographic and clinical characteristics of\nenrolled patients are shown in Table 1.\nExperimental procedures\nT-lymphocyte isolation\nVenous blood was drawn from the antecubital vein, col-\nlected in a sterile flask containing 3.8% sodium citrate\n(9/1, vol/vol); the method for T-lymphocyte isolation was\ndetailed in our previous report.6 Magnetic beads conju-\ngated with antihuman CD 3 (Miltenyi Biotec, Germany)\nwere used for the positive selection of T lymphocytes. In\neach incubation experiment mRNA expression of ACE,\nAT1-R, IFN- and ACE activity and Ang II concentrations\nwere evaluated in T-cell pellets. ACE activity was also\ninvestigated in the supernatants, because ACE can be shed\nby T cells.6 To study the effect of stimulation by Ang II on\nACE and AT1-R T-cell gene expression, ACE activity and\nAng II concentrations, T lymphocytes had been cultured in\na cell incubator in humidified atmosphere with 5% carbon\ndioxide for 6, 18 or 24 hours, with and without the addition\nReal-time polymerase chain reaction for ACE\ngene, RT\u00adPCR analysis for AT1-R and IFN-\ngenes\nIsolation of total RNA was performed as previously\ndescribed.6 FAM-labelled probes and primers for ACE\nTable 1.

ACE gene expression\nwas calculated as 2Ct (Ct\n= Ct\nof the target gene minus Ct\nof -actin); mRNAs for AT1-R and IFN- were semi-\nquantified versus the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-\n3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) by reverse\ntranscriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT\u00adPCR) (Applied\nBiosystems) using specific primers at annealing tempera-\nture and cycle number as reported in Table 2.\nMeasurement of pellet and supernatant ACE\nactivity\nT-cell ACE activity was measured by the quantification of\nhippuric acid, produced during the enzymatic reaction of\nACE on a synthetic substrate hippuryl\u00adhistidyl\u00adleucine\nand assayed by high-pressure liquid chromatography\n(HPLC) analysis using a spectrophotometric detector at\n228 nm absorbance as previously described.6 Ang II levels\nwere expressed as fmol/mg proteins.\nMeasurement of plasma renin activity, Ang II\nand hs-CRP\nPlasma renin activity (PRA) measurement was performed\nwith a commercial kit (Sorin Biomedica, Saluggia,\nVicenza, Italy).

In cultured unstable angina T\ncells the Ang II concentration was significantly higher\n(P<0.01) than that assayed in controls and stable angina\npatients, both at baseline and after Ang II stimulation\n(Table 3).\nDiscussion\nOur data show that in unstable angina patients with high hs-\nCRP levels but not in stable angina patients with low hs-\nCRP levels, circulating T-cell RAS was upregulated under\nbaseline conditions, independently of Ang II stimulation.\nThe exaggerated upregulation of unstable angina T-cell\nRAS was mainly sustained by the high levels of ACE gene\nexpression and resulted in a marked increase in T-cell ACE\nactivity and Ang II concentration associated with an\nincreased baseline AT1-R gene expression. In T cells from\nstable angina patients a slight increase in ACE gene expres-\nsion was found, but it did not result in higher ACE activity.\nStimulation of unstable angina cultured T-cell RAS by Ang\nII further amplified the T-cell ACE and AT1-R gene activa-\ntion and resulted in a higher intracellular Ang II concentra-\ntion and in the almost complete release of T-cell ACE\nactivity in the supernatant. These findings strongly suggest\nthat in vivo in unstable angina patients T-cell RAS could\nincrease the local Ang II concentration inside plaques or in\nmicrovessels of left ventricular myocardium where they\nmigrate. T cells are involved in the process of endothelial\ndysfunction contributing to plaque destabilisation10 and the\nFigure 3.

In a previous study we\ndemonstrated that the cardiac RAS acts locally and sustains\ngeneralised inflammation in the smaller coronary vessels of\npatients with unstable angina11 by the novo production of\nAng II; in unstable angina patients the heart can contribute\nAng II to the circulation and play a role in maintaining sys-\ntemic inflammation of unstable angina. The demonstration\nof the upregulation of circulating T-cell RAS in unstable\nangina patients shows that T cells are actively involved in\nthe microvessel inflammation and can further amplify the\nsystemic and cardiac activation of the immune system, also\nby the cell-based synthesis of Ang II. In agreement with our\ndata, previous research indicated that inflammation and\nimmune cell infiltration are associated with cardiovascular\ndiseases and play a major role in the development of athero-\nsclerosis.12,13 Clinical trials have shown that early adminis-\ntered ACE inhibition improves prognosis in patients with\nmyocardial infarction and unstable angina14 and indirectly\nsuggests a role of RAS in ACS. The Heart Outcomes\nPrevention Evaluation study showed that an ACE inhibitor\nreduced cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction15 and\nthe need for revascularisation after stenting, and reduced\nsubsequent events in patients with angina pectoris.16 In\npatients with non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarc-\ntion, enalapril and ilbesartan treatment started at admission\nor at discharge was associated with a decrease in the levels\nof markers of inflammation, endothelial dysfunction and\nischaemia at 60 days.As a whole, these findings support that\nRAS activation is involved in the inflammatory stress asso-\nciated with atherosclerotic damage of coronary vessels.Ang\nII is one of the most potent mitogens that induce monocytes\nentering into vessel walls to cause inflammatory response in\nvascular smooth muscle cells,17 and might be associated\nwith the development of atherosclerosis via regulating spe-\ncific T-cell phenotypes.18\nIn the past few years, a lymphocytic-based RAS was\nshown in humans that operates as an autonomous source of\nAng II, independent of circulating and tissue RAS.19\u00ad21\nAccording to these findings, lymphocytes are endowed not\nonly with ACE activity, as first reported,20 but also with all\nRAS genes necessary for Ang II synthesis and can autono-\nmously modulate the intracellular Ang II concentration.\nUnder physiological conditions, Ang II upregulates lym-\nphocytic RAS throughAT1-Rs.6 In our previous paper about\nhypertensive patients with low grade inflammation, the\nT-cell RAS response to Ang II is amplified in comparison\nwith T cells from controls and hypertensive patients with\nhs-CRP less than 2mg/dl, suggesting that T-cell RAS activ-\nity is strictly related to inflammatory lymphocyte activa-\ntion.21 In T cells from hypertensive patients with low grade\ninflammation, no activation of T-cell RAS was found under\nbaseline conditions withoutAng II stimulus. Remarkably, in\nT cells from unstable angina patients with high hs-CRP lev-\nels, T-cell RAS was activated also under baseline conditions\nindependently of Ang II stimulus. The amount of Ang II\nsynthesised by unstable angina T cells could not modify\nAng II concentration in plasma, as shown by normal PRA\nand Ang I and II levels found in this and previous work,22\nbut they could affect the local Ang II concentration in tis-\nsues where they migrate. In vitro we showed that Ang II\nstimulation caused the almost complete release of ACE\nactivity by T cells in supernatant; this finding strongly sup-\nports the concept that the upregulation of unstable angina T\ncells is aimed at increasing extra (plaques and coronary\nmicrovessels) more than intra T-cell Ang II concentrations.\nThe in vitro marked release of ACE enzymatic activity\ninto the supernatant by cultured T cells from unstable\nangina patients could translate in vivo into the local activa-\ntion of other cells endowed with AT1-R, such as endothe-\nlial cells and monocytes localised inside coronary plaques\nor coronary microvessels.23\nTable 3.

Our findings show that in unstable angina\nthe activation of T cells is associated with the selective\nupregulation of T-cell RAS. Unstable angina T cells can be\nthe key step between inflammation and RAS activation\nthat can reciprocally potentiate according to a positive\nfeedback loop.\nAccording to our findings the role of culprit lesion\nplayed by unstable plaques could be mediated by the\nincreased Ang II production by activated circulating T\ncells migrated inside those plaques.24,25\nStudy limitations\nACE and Ang II can induce or suppress specific classes of\nT cells. In an experimental model proinflammatory T\nhelper (Th)1 and Th17 cell induction was associated with\nincreased Ang II in both CD4 T cells and monocytes.\nDifferent T-cell populations are known to operate with\nopposite roles on the immune system; we did not make\ndistinctions betweenT-cell subtypes so we cannot specify\nto what T-cell subpopulation Ang II upregulation was\nlinked. However, in experimental models 8 weeks of\nexogenous Ang II treatment accelerated the development\nof atherosclerosis and prompted a switch from a stable to\nunstable plaque that was associated with a change in\nCD4+ T-lymphocyte activity; valsartan inhibited the\neffect of Ang II and significantly increased the frequency\nof Th2 and Treg cells.26 In different atherosclerotic-prone\nmodels the proatherogenic properties of Th1 were shown\nand evidence from clinical investigations was collected\nthat the upregulation of the Th1 immune response was\noverwhelming in patients with ACS,27,28 and that an Ang\nII-due imbalance between Th1 and Th2 response might\nplay a role in plaque rupture.29,30 Recently, in healthy sub-\njects, cultured Th1 and Th17 cells, as well as related\ncytokines including IFN-, were notably increased by the\naddition of Ang II in a dose-dependent manner, and the\npromoted effects were significantly inhibited after treat-\nment with Ang II antagonists.18 As a whole, these findings\nstrongly suggest that the activation of T-cell RAS found in\nangina patients is part of the dysregulation in T-cell popu-\nlation underlying ACS.\nConclusions\nOur findings strongly suggest that the activation of T-cell\nRAS found in unstable angina and not stable angina\npatients is part of the dysregulation in T-cell population\nfunction underlying ACS. T-cell RAS could play a major\nrole in the promotion of the widespread coronary inflam-\nmation and plaque destabilisation in UA patients.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any funding agency\nin the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
