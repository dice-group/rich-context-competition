Multivariate logistic regression with a ro-\nbust estimate of variance was used to analyze a 7-category nominal response of:functional status (4 levels), institu-\ntionalization, death, and missing. Weightedpercentages for functional status transitions and stability (unchanged sta-\ntus) showed that unchanged or improvedfunctioning were at least as common as death or worsenedfunctional status.\nInitial disability level, morbidities, and self-rated health were the strongest predictors of disability status after 2-years.\nThe two-state model revealed that a previous transition (positive or negative) increases the riskfor a subsequent transi-\ntion, independent of initial disability level. The predictive and explanatory quality of the two-state model is substan-\ntially improved over single-state models, particularly from its ability to identify subgroups of individuals with marked\nfunctional status instability.\nDISABILITY patterns among elderly persons provide key\ninformation about the heterogeneity of burden in the\ncommunity from morbidity, in terms of loss of independence,\ndecreased life satisfaction and social isolation (Mor, Wilcox,\nRakowski, & Hiris, 1994), and in the level and duration of\nhealth care service needs (Manton & Soldo, 1992).\nKnowledge of the segways and longitudinal patterns in func-\ntional status transitions is increasingly being sought by health\ncare planners to refine their risk assessment models developed\nto manage disability in an epoch characterized by population\naging and health care reform. The challenge is that disable-\nment is a many varied thing. For some persons, disability may\noccur late in life and progress rapidly to the point at which in-\nstitutional care is necessitated or death occurs. For others, it\nmay produce a more dynamic pattern, with varying sequences\nof fluctuations and reversals in disability interrupted by peri-\nods of stability (Guralnik & LaCroix, 1992). For example, in\npopulation-based prospective studies, a considerable propor-\ntion of disabled elderly persons report improved functioning\nover periods of a few years to several years (Branch & Ku,\nIt is known from epidemiological, demographic, and medi-\ncal data that the linkages of major functional disability with\naging are often correlational but not causal. Aging is the venue\nfor the transitions of accumulated risk factor exposures to\nfunctional impairments, and later to limitations in functioning\n(Nagi, 1976). In large observational studies of elderly persons,\nusing periods of follow-up ranging from 2 to 6 years, ad-\nvanced age is but one of many factors associated with risk for\ndisability and use of healthcare and community services\nAppreciable variability in disability is found for type of co-\nmorbidity, predispositional factors such as gender, and the in-\ndividual's social resources. Morbidity holds a primary position\nin the disablement process and has a complex association with\ndisability. The number of chronic diseases and illnesses is lin-\nearly associated with prevalent and incident disability (Fried\n& Guralnik, 1997). The type of disease may produce different\npatterns of functional disability (Buchner & Wagner, 1992;\nVerbrugge, 1992.). Other important predictors of disability\nconnected to disease and illness include current functional sta-\ntus, and global self-rated health perception (Crimmins & Saito,\nOlder-aged women have a higher prevalence of disability and\nchronic disease, particularly cardiovascular diseases (Manton,\n1988a), and survive longer than similarly disabled men\nand the availability of close social contacts during aging ap-\npear to prolong life (House, Landis, & Umberson, 1988), and\npromote health and adaptation to impairment processes result-\ning in more time spent in the community (Bradsher et al.,\nWhile this body of work has been quite important in de-\nscribing the heterogenous patterns in disability and need for\nlongterm care services in the community, a general limitation\nhas been the reliance upon a single time interval (single-state\nmodel) to study transitions which are assumed to hold over\nmultiple time periods. Very little work has explored patterns of\ndisability over multiple intervals, such as in a two-state model\nwhere an initial transition can be observed to effect transitions\nin disability status in a subsequent period. As a result, there is\nvirtually no prospective information on the prognostic impor-\ntance of functional status decline on subsequent disability, and\nwhether some subgroups of elderly persons have markedly\nmore functional status instability than others. Similarly, the\nfunctional status prognoses of those observed with improved\nfunctional status over an interval has not been well described.\nThe general limitations of single-state models was recognized\nby Mor et al. (1994) in their own reliance on a six-year model\nfor transitions. Documenting the dynamic variability in dis-\nability may provide important insight regarding the prognostic\nimportance of an initial decline on subsequent transitions and\ncould be useful in identifying risk for marked functional status\ninstability, such as sustained functional decline.\nThis study extends the disability literature by comparing\nand contrasting prospective single-state and two-state func-\ntional status transitions among elderly persons who partici-\npated in the Longitudinal Study on Aging (LSOA). Analyses\nwere undertaken to document increased precision possible in\npredicting functional status in two-state models over single-\nstate models and to identify individual predictors of marked\nfunctional status instability.\nMETHODS\nSample\nData for this study come from all four interview waves of the\nLSOA. The LSOA is based on the 1984 National Health\nInterview Survey, Supplement on Aging (SOA) conducted by\nthe National Center for Health Statistics. The LSOA provided a\nfollow-up to the SOA to examine change in living arrange-\nments and functional limitations over time among elderly per-\nsons who, based upon their age, were likely to experience\nchange in functional disability. Re-interviews were conducted\nand living in a household residence at the time of the interview\nattempt. Those without telephones were contacted by mail with\na self-administered questionnaire. Proxies were used for re-\nspondents who were not available on the day of the interview,\nmost commonly from health impairments (Fitti & Kovar,\nDue to budgetary constraints, the first LSOA re-interview\nSOA participants. This sample was selected to include: all\nSOA panel members 80 years and over; all persons of black\nethnicity ages 70 to 79; one-half of the remaining sample age\nin the same household as one of the above selected persons\nparticipants. Thus, four waves of data collection were at-\ntempted for 5,151 SOA respondents (Sample A), and three-\nwaves were attempted on 2,376 persons not re-interviewed in\n1986 (Sample B). Because the focus of this paper relates to\nfunctional status transitions observed over 2-year intervals\nbased only on Sample A, the four-wave sample.\nThe self-response rate in the initial LSOA survey was high,\nrequiring the use of proxy reports in approximately 8% of\nhouseholds. In the subsequent re-interview periods, proxy re-\nports ranged from 31% to 36%. The data used in this study in-\ncluded both that derived from self-reports and proxies. This\nmethod was preferred because non-response may be related to\nsubstantial declines in health and functioning, as reported in\nthe LSOA for mortality and level of disability (Kovar, 1989).\nIn addition, there is evidence from other sources suggesting\nthat proxy reports involving behaviors or health conditions\nwhen the respondent is cognitively impaired or severely ill\n(Rodgers & Herzog, 1989) may be advantageous over nonre-\nsponse. In the latter cases, these proxy reports were judged to\nbe more precise and more stable over time than self-reports. In\nthe LSOA proxy respondents were chosen who could likely\nprovide reliable and accurate information; most lived within\nthe same household as the respondent.\nMeasures\nFunctional status was assessed by self-report from items re-\nferring to activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental ac-\ntivities of daily living (IADLs). ADLs represent common, ev-\neryday tasks required for self care (Katz et al., 1963) which, in\nthe LSOA, included the ability to: bathe/shower, dress, eat,\ntransfer, and use a toilet. IADL items capture a range of inde-\npendence more complex than ADLs (Lawton & Brody, 1969),\nand represent less severe dysfunction than ADLs (Spector,\nKatz, & Fulton, 1987). IADL items in the LSOA included: the\nability to prepare meals, shop, manage money, use a telephone,\ndo heavy house work, and do light housework. Similar to other\nreports on functional status transitions (Manton, 1988b; Mor et\nal., 1994) we created distinct categories of functional disability\nbased upon whether an individual was unable to perform the\nspecified activity. A respondent was classified as being (1) inde-\npendent: able to perform all ADL and IADL activities; (2)\nIADL disabled only: unable to perform one or more IADLs but\nhad no ADL disabilities; (3) moderately ADL disabled: unable\nto perform one or two ADL activities; and (4) severely ADL\ndisabled: unable to perform more than two ADL activities.\nCompeting risks to functional transitions include institution-\nalization and death; hence, each was included as a possible\noutcome in our 7-category response. Institutionalization infor-\nmation was updated for each 2-year interval (LSOA interview\nson identified by the participant during the baseline interview).\nUsing a combination of LSOA information and results from\nrecord matches with the National Death Index (NDI), deaths\nwere identified and assigned to the interview wave based on\ndate of incidence. This methodology has been shown to im-\nprove the accuracy of identifying deaths in the LSOA com-\npared to using only NDI or LSOA information, and is de-\nscribed in detail elsewhere (James, Miller, Anderson, Worley,\nCovariates, modeled as baseline (1984 SOA interview) pre-\ndictors of functional status transitions, included the respon-\ndent's gender and race, and baseline values for age, living ar-\nrangements, functional status, self-rated health, number of\nillnesses, and comorbidity. The transition models (described\nbelow) add updated information for age and functional status,\nas time-dependent covariates. The respondents living arrange-\nment was measured from both marital status, and if unmarried,\nwhether living alone versus with others. This allowed us to in-\nclude unmarried persons (e.g., widowed) who live with some-\none for assistance. Self-rated health was rated as excellent/very\ngood, good, or fair/poor. Participants with missing values for\nthe self-rated health item were combined with the fair/poor\ncategory. The latter coding decision was consistent with the\nLSOA documentation (1991) which stated that those not re-\nsponding to self-report health questions were very old, ill, or\nboth. Self-assessed number of illnesses had a range of 0 to 10\n(the highest level was truncated as 10 or more) and was treated\nas a continuous variable. Based upon the work of Manton\ndisease type (acute/fatal vs chronic/nonfatal), two classes of\ncomorbidity were investigated: cardiovascular diseases (CVD)\nincluding coronary heart disease, stroke (or cerebrovascular\naccident), hardening of the arteries, or angina pectoris; and\nmusculoskeletal diseases (MSD) including osteoporosis,\narthritis, or whether the respondent ever had a broken hip.\nThese disease groups have a high prevalence among older\nadults in general and were reported to account for approxi-\nmately 85% of all morbidities reported in the Long-term Care\nStudy (Manton, 1989). CVD was introduced as a disease\ngrouping likely to produce a relatively fast pace of functional\ndecline, while MSD was introduced as a disease likely to pro-\nduce a relatively slow pace of decline. The CVD and MSD\nclassifications were constructed from 1984 self-reported preva-\nlent health conditions. Note that comorbidity, self-rated health,\nand number of illnesses were assessed only at baseline in the\nLSOA and therefore reflect only the status reported in 1984.\nStatistical Modeling\nMultivariate logistic regression was used to analyze a 7-\ncategory, nominal response: 4 levels of functional status\n(independent, IADL disabled, moderately ADL disabled,\nseverely ADL disabled), institutionalization, death, and oth-\nerwise unknown status. Thus, each model adjusts the prob-\nability of functional status transitions for competing risks\nfrom institutionalization, death, and having missing infor-\nmation on status. Predictors considered in the models in-\nclude variables representing previous functional status, age,\ngender, race, self-reported health, CVD, MSD, number of\nillnesses, marital status, and living arrangements (i.e., lives\nwith others versus lives alone). By including previous func-\ntional status in these models, we are able to predict the\nprobability of transitions from precedent to antecedent\nfunctional status states. Age, as measured in one-year incre-\nments in 1984, was parameterized in all models to estimate\na cross-sectional effect of age on the probability of the ob-\nserved transition. Change in age since 1984 was used to es-\ntimate the longitudinal effect of aging using parameteriza-\ntions similar to those described by Laird, Donnelly, and\nWare (1992). Inclusion of this longitudinal aging effect is\nequivalent to including a variable representing time from\n1984 to the beginning of each two-year period in our mod-\nels. Interactions between time (longitudinal aging) and pre-\nvious functional status were explored to indicate whether\ncertain transition probabilities exhibited a pace of decay\nwhich was specific to time under observation. A statistically\nsignificant longitudinal aging interaction term would indi-\ncate that the multiple 2-year time periods contain different\nassociations between covariates and functional transition\nprobabilities, and thus must be analyzed separately by in-\nterval. Transition probabilities were estimated by regressing\nend-of-period status on beginning-of-period status using a\nparameterization representing all possible patterns of\nchange. This model was selected because tests of quadratic\nand cubic orthogonal polynomial terms relating the two pe-\nriod-statuses were highly significant (p < 0.0001), thus in-\nvalidating the assumption of a linear effect associated with\nthe use of change scores.\nInteraction terms were included in the models to investigate\nthe possible effect modifications between initial functional sta-\ntus and each of the following covariates: gender, age, CVD\nand MSD. Interactions between comorbidity status (CVD &\nMSD) and time (longitudinal aging) were also explored to as-\nsess the potential differential impact of these comorbidities on\nfunctional status 2 versus 4 years later.\nGeneralized estimating equations, adopting the assumption\nthat repeated observations for a subject are independent of one\nanother, were used to estimate parameters in all models (Liang\n& Zeger, 1986). A robust estimate of the variance of estimated\nused to account for dependency within the primary sampling\nunits (PSUs) for the original SOA survey (Kovar, Fitte, &\nChyba, 1992). Because the PSU references the highest level of\nclustering, with repeated functional status outcomes taken on\nparticipants falling within single PSUs, this use of the robust\nvariance estimate also accounts for dependence between the\nmultiple measurements obtained for each participant (Korn &\nGraubard, 1995). When there is no dependence between out-\ncomes within PSUs, these methods reduce to maximum likeli-\nhood techniques.\nAll of the results presented were calculated with weights\nthat account for the unequal probabilities of selection and\nnon-response adjustments. Potential instability of the estima-\ntion process resulting from multicollinearity of predictor vari-\nables was investigated by inspecting the bivariate correla-\ntions between pairs of predictors and regressing each\npredictor variable on all other predictor variables, thus deter-\nmining how any single variable behaved in the presence and\nabsence of other variables in the model. This latter analysis\nprovided us with an indication of the percentage of variation\nof each predictor that could be explained by all other predic-\ntors. All variables chosen a priori for investigation were in-\ncluded in the models except those which displayed multi-\ncollinearity with other covariates. Because marital status was\nso closely related to living arrangements (alone versus with\nothers), we chose to retain the latter variable because of its\nbroader applicability to living arrangement types. Stability of\nmodel parameter estimates and associated variances were in-\nvestigated by: 1) fitting both single and two-state transition\nmodels after entering each covariate solely into the model,\nand 2) re-fitting our final model containing all covariates\nmultiple times, each time removing a single covariate from\nall variables contained in the final model. All multivariate lo-\ngistic regression models were fit using the MULTILOG pro-\ncedure of SUDAAN (Shah, Barnwell, & Bieler, 1996). Re-\nsults from these models are presented in terms of the odds\nratios (Agresti, 1990) for being in each of the seven end-of-\nperiod outcome states relative to having no disability along\nwith their 95% confidence intervals.\nAs an illustration of odds ratios are obtained from the\nmultivariate logistic regression analyses, consider a model\nusing gender and race as predictors of our seven outcome\ncategories (independence, IADL disabled, moderate ADL,\nsevere ADL, institutionalized, death, missing). The models\nthat we fit use \"Independent\" as the reference category for\neach of the logistic models that can be obtained from the\nother response categories. For example, the logistic model\nfor White males relating the probability of being \"IADL\ndisabled\" to the probability of being \"Independent\" would\nbe specified as:\nlog (Pmb IADL disabled/ Prob Independence) = |i, + TC\n+ TR\n,\nwhere jx,, TG/\n, and iR]\nrepresent the intercept, gender effect,\nand race effect, respectively, for this logit model. The ratio of\nthe odds of being \"IADL disabled\" relative to \"Independent\"\nfor men versus women, controlling for White race, is deter-\nmined as follows:\nORgmkt\n= exp [ log (Pmb IADL disabled/Prob Indep)^ - log (Pmb IADL disabled/Prob lndep)m\n= exp [ CM-i + T\nc/\n+ T\u00ab;) - (M-i + TK\n,) ]\n= exp(Tc ;\n)\nSingle-State Transition Models. -- Transition probabilities\nfor the 7-category nominal response described above were cal-\nculated for two-year transitions considering the subject's func-\ntional status state at the previous time point. For this model,\ntional status was updated to reflect their reported condition at\nthe start of each two-year period. This was done to allow the\nprobability of a transition within the specified interval to be a\nfunction of the most recent functional status information. Both\ncross-sectional and longitudinal aging effects were included in\nthis model.\nWhen modeling transition data, a general difficulty encoun-\ntered is that some competing risks are considered to be absorb-\ning states, or conditions which essentially designate attrition\nfrom the study, such as death. Institutionalization and missing\nfrom follow-up can be temporarily absorbing states, as some\nindividuals later return to the community, are traced, or have\nproxies to provide updated survey information. Persons with\nmissing data for one period remained active in the LSOA, and\nin many instances (n = 317), had assessments completed in\nsubsequent LSOA reinterview periods. In our transitional mod-\nels that use multiple periods of follow-up for each participant,\nwe included all participants that possessed covariate informa-\ntion at the beginning, and outcome information at the end, of\neach specific interval.\nTwo-State Transition Model. -- To explore whether the two-\nyear transitions in the single-state model might also be depen-\ndent on the participant's functional status measured four years\nprior, we used available data from the two, four-year periods\ntained the same covariables as those included in the single-\nstate, two-year transitional model, but also included functional\nstatus measured four years prior as an additional predictor.\nThus, the probability of the two-year transitions between\nchanges in functional status in the previous two years. In this\nmodel, if functional status measured two years prior is a sig-\nnificant predictor, and functional status measured four years\nprior is not, then this result favors a conclusion that the proba-\nis only dependent on the functional status measured in 1986 or\n1988, respectively. In contrast, if both prior functional status\nmeasures are significant, then there exists evidence that the\ntwo-year transition probability depends on functional status\nmeasured both 2 and 4 years prior.\nRESULTS\nSample Characteristics\nTable 1 presents weighted percentages for the covariables\nconsidered in our analyses for each LSOA wave in Sample A.\nAt baseline (1984), this cohort predominantly consisted of\nWhite females most of whom were either living with a spouse,\nTable 1. 1984 Characteristics of LSOA Participants for\nThose Contributing Functional Status Information\nat Each Follow-up: Weighted Percentages\nBaseline Characteristic\nGender\nMale\nFemale\nAge, yrs\nRace\nWhite\nOther\nMarital Status\nMarried\nNever married\nOther\nLiving Arrangement\nWith others\nAlone\nSelf-rated Health\nExcellent/very good\nGood\nFair/poor/dont't know\nCardiovascular Disease\nYes\nNo\nMuscular Skeletal Disease\nYes\nNo\nYes\nNo\nIndependent\nIADL disabled\nModerately ADL disabled\nSeverely ADL disabled\nFollow-up Cohort\nor widowed (other). Approximately one-third lived alone.\nBetween one-quarter and one-third reported having fair to poor\nhealth; nearly one-quarter (23.9%) reported ever having one or\nmore CVD conditions; and more than one-half (55.9%) reported\never having one or more MSD conditions. Nearly 30% had\nsome level of functional disability. These 1984 data are also pre-\nsented for those who were alive and contacted at the beginning\npact of attrition on sample characteristics. It is evident that attri-\ntion from death, institutionalization or having unknown infor-\nloss of participants who: were men, were older, reported some\nlevel of functional impairment, had proxy-reported information,\nhad CVD, or reported having fair-to-poor health.\nFunctional Status Transitions\nTable 2 presents the weighted percentages for men and\nwomen for aggregated 2-year functional status transitions\ntion at the end of the period sharply increased with more\nsevere disability at the beginning of the period 7.4% to\n36.7%; however, men were more likely than women to die\nat each level of disability. It is also evident that women re-\nporting any level of disability (IADL or greater) were more\nlikely to have been institutionalized during the two-year pe-\nriod than men. Considerable heterogeneity in functional\nstatus transitions is evident. The weighted percentages of\nmen with improved status in 2 years, by level of disability\n(IADL, moderate ADL, & severe ADL), ranged from 13.0\nlarge percentage of persons were also classified with un-\nwomen with severe ADL disability, and 21.4% of men and\n28.3% of women with moderate ADL disability had un-\nchanged status. Taken together, having either unchanged or\ndecline (e.g., same or improved status) was more common\nthan death and institutionalization at each level of disability\nfor women and men at all levels of functional status, except\nsevere ADL disability.\nPredictors of 2-year Functional Status Transitions\nTable 3 presents adjusted odds ratios (and 95% CI) from the\nsingle-state, multivariate model predicting the combined 2 year\nperiod transition probabilities. For each covariate, the odds are\nspecific for each competing outcome state, relative to being in-\ndependent and adjusted for the effects of all other covariates\nlisted. After controlling for the level of functional status at the\nprevious interview (2 years prior), there was no longitudinal\naging effect. Additionally, we found no interaction between the\nlongitudinal aging effect and the previous functional status vari-\nable (p = 0.357). Initial age, self-rated health, and level of func-\ntional impairment were each strongly related to each of the five\noutcomes shown in the Table. The pattern of odds ratios (OR)\nfor gender are consistent with unadjusted probabilities which\nshowed that men were less likely to have disability than women\n(albeit the 95% CI for those with severe ADL includes 1.0), and\nmore likely to die. Whereas, the odds for women to be institu-\ntionalized by the end of the interval is larger than for men ad-\njusting for all model covariables. However, the 95% CI for this\nodds ratio marginally included 1.0 and thus did not reach for-\nmal statistical significance (p < .05).\nAn increasing level of disability was strongly associated with\nhaving moderate or severe ADL disability, being institutional-\nized or having died. For those beginning the interval with some\ndisability, the odds of reporting worse functional status at the\nend of the interval, relative to reporting independence, are much\ngreater than these same odds for persons reporting indepen-\ndence at the beginning of the interval. This result is consistent\nwith the unadjusted, weighted percentages reported in Table 2,\nwhere approximately 64% of persons reporting independence\nat the beginning of the interval also report independence at the\nend of the interval. Persons starting the period with moderate or\nsevere disability are quite unlikely to report independence at\nthe end of the interval. Thus, the odds ratios associated with\nthese two categories are quite large. For all levels of disability\nexcept severe disability, stability is generally the most frequent\noutcome, resulting in the large odds ratios for stable functional\nstatus. Among those reporting severe disability at the beginning\nof an interval, the odds for moderate disability, institutionaliza-\ntion, and death are also quite large relative to the infrequent oc-\ncurrence of a report of independence.\nTable 2. Two-Year Transitions in Functional Status: Weighted Percentages\nBeginning of\nperiod status\nIndependent\nMen\nWomen\nIADL disabled\nMen\nWomen\nModerate ADL\nMen\nWomen\nSevere ADL\nMen\nWomen\nIndep\nIADL\ndisabled\nModerate\nADL\nEnd of Period Status\nSevere\nADL\nInstit.\nDeath\nMissing\nFinally, having poor self-rated health, and a self-reported\nhistory of MSD or CVD, were strongly associated with greater\nodds of being in a disabled state relative to independence.\nHaving MSD exhibited a trend (p > .05) toward being less\nlikely than those without MSD to become institutionalized or\nto have died, relative to being independent. Interaction effects\nbetween initial functional status and gender, age, MDS, and\nCVD, as well as interactions between time (longitudinal aging)\nand CVD did not reach statistical significance ofp < .05.\nOur investigation of the sensitivity of our results to the pres-\nence of specific covariates found that the odds ratios for func-\ntional status at the beginning of the period were affected by the\npresence/absence in the model of either self-rated health or age\nin 1984. When self-rated health or age were entered into a\nmodel containing only the previous functional status variable,\nthe odds ratios for functional status decreased within a 10% to\n30% range. Similarly, when either of these variables was\ndeleted from the final model containing all other covariates,\nthe odds ratios for functional status increased by similar per-\ncentages. The presence/absence of any other variables in the\nmodel did not greatly impact the estimates for the functional\nstatus variable. The presence of covariates decreased the vari-\nances of the functional status parameter estimates, relative to\nthe variances obtained from a model containing only the previ-\nous functional status variable. Thus, the large confidence inter-\nvals present in Table 3 for several of the odds ratios represent-\ning the effect of previous functional status are primarily a\nresult of the data sparseness present in the cross-classification\nof initial functional status and subsequent status two years\nhence.\nFinally, from our investigations of bivariate correlations, and\nthe amount of variation in any single covariate that could be\nexplained by all other covariates, we concluded that multi-\ncollinearity most likely did not pose a threat for estimation of\nparameters in our multivariable model. In particular, our bi-\nvariate analyses indicated that the other covariates most highly\ncorrelated with the variable representing previous level of\nfunctional status were: self-rated health (r = 0.32), number of\nillnesses (r = 0.26), presence of cardiovascular disease (r =\n-0.24), presence of musculoskeletal disease (r = -0.18), and\nTable 3.

Among the remaining correlations,\nthe greatest correlations were between gender and whether the\nparticipant lived alone (r = 0.32), self-rated health and the\nnumber of illnesses (r = 0.28), self-rated health and the pres-\nence of CVD (r = -0.24), and the number of illnesses and the\npresence of MSD (r = -0.22). All remaining correlations be-\ntween covariates were smaller than \u00b1 0.20. Using multiple re-\ngression, we determined that the largest amount of total vari-\nability for any single covariate, that could be explained by all\nother covariates, was for the number of illnesses, which was\n46%. All covariates explained only 26% of the variability in\nprevious level of functional status.\nWhether Previous Functional Status Predicts Subsequent\n2-year Period Transitions\nThe weighted percentages for 2-state, 2-year functional sta-\ntus transitions are shown in Table 4. These provide a compari-\nson of the predicted transition probabilities associated with 2\nyears prior status, as stratified by 4 years prior status. These\ndata reveal patterns in functional status heterogeneity over\ntime, as presented graphically in Figures la and lb. Initial sta-\nbility (unchanged statuses 4 years to 2 years prior) predicts\nsubsequent period stability (2 years prior to end-of-period sta-\ntus). The probability of subsequent period stability diminishes\nwith increasing disability status 4 years prior. Among those\nwho were independent 2 years prior (Figure la), having had\nsevere ADL disability 4 years prior is associated with a sub-\nstantially smaller probability of continuing to have indepen-\ndent status than when only IADL disability is present 4 years\nprior (i.e., 21.7 vs 43.5). Likewise, the probability of having\nworsened status increases with increasing disability 4 years\nprior. This same pattern is evident among those with IADL\ndisability 2 years prior (Figure lb.). Also evident in this pattern\nis that persons who had improved functional status in the ini-\ntial period (4 years to 2 years prior) have a much larger chance\nof having continued worsening status than having either con-\ntinued stability or improvement.\nTable 5 presents the adjusted odds ratios and 95% CI for the\nfunctional status variables when two previous states of func-\ntional status, adjusted for all covariates listed in Table 3, are\nused to predict subsequent status. The p-value for the term rep-\nresenting functional status 4 years previous is highly signifi-\ncant adjusting for the 2 years prior status (p < .0001), indicat-\ning that the predicted probabilities for groups defined by\nfunctional status 2 years prior are refined to reflect their func-\ntional status 4 years previous. The two-state model reveals\nsubstantially more heterogeneity in functional status transi-\ntions than does the single-state model. After accounting for\nfunctional status obtained 4 years prior, the odds ratios ob-\ntained for functional status obtained 2 years prior are consis-\ntently smaller than those presented in Table 3 for the single-\nstate model. The significant odds ratios associated with 4 years\nprior status indicate that the odds related to end-of-period sta-\ntus associated with 2 years prior status depend upon the level\nof disability reported 4 years prior.

In addition, our investigation regarding\nthe sensitivity of our two-state modeling results to the presence\nof specific covariates produced results almost identical to those\ndescribed for the single-state model. Only the presence of either\ninitial age or self-rated health in this model decreased the odds\nratios associated with the previous functional status variables.\nDISCUSSION\nPrevious reports have documented the complex and dy-\nnamic nature of functional disability among elderly persons\ntable finding from the prospective models is evidence that the\nprocess of functional change among elderly persons is not uni-\ndirectional (Manton, 1988b). A substantial proportion of those\nwith disabilities will remain stable or actually improve over\ntime; many more will remain in the community with medical\nand home care assistance irrespective of functional transitions.\nOur study builds upon the literature by examining short- and\nlong-term patterns in disability by incorporating prior changes\nin status using a two-state model to more fully observe the di-\nversity in functional status transitions. To our knowledge, this\nis the first report on functional transitions among elderly per-\nsons using this approach.\nDue to data sparseness in functional status transitions across\nour 7-category outcome, we chose to combine all 2-year peri-\nods (for the single-state models), and all 4-year periods (for the\ntwo-state models). Because this method assumes common ef-\nfects for distinct time periods, we investigated for interactions\nIndependent Two Years Prior IADL Disabled Two Years Prior\nEnd of period Status\nStatus 4 years ago\n\u00b7Independent E3IADL Disabled\nEModerate ADL \u00b7Severe ADL\nSame Worse\nFigure la: Two-year transition status by four years prior functional sta-\ntus: Independent.\nI.\nEnd of period Status Same Worse Better\nFigure lb: Two-year transition status by four years prior functional sta-\ntus: IADL Disabled.\nTable 5.

Our testing\nrevealed no significant interactions, which supported our as-\nsumption of common effects across intervals and provided evi-\ndence that our updated measures of disability for each distinct\n2-year period adequately captured the aging of the sample.\nConsistent with findings reported by Manton (1989) from\nthe National Long-term Care Survey (LTCS), and Guralnik,\nLaCroix, & Abbott, (1993) for the EPESE study, our single-\nstate model revealed a substantial percentage of subjects in the\nLSOA initially with some degree of disability who reported ei-\nther the same level or lesser disability after two years. For ex-\nample, 21.3% of persons with moderate ADL disability had\nimproved status, while 13.8% of those with severe ADL dis-\nability had improved status. The likelihood of improving di-\nminished for persons with severe ADL disability. In the LTCS,\nmore than 20% of persons with severe disability had improved\nstatus. We note that the LTCS used a method of classifying\ndisability that was similar, but not identical, to ours, and that\nthe LSOA included a more aged cohort than the LTCS. Also\nconsistent with reports by these other investigators was our\nfinding of relatively high proportions of persons with moderate\nto severe disability (IADL or greater) who reported the same\nOur examination of transitions by gender revealed that\nwomen had greater stability than men. Crimmins and Saito\n(1993) studied transitions in LSOA participants who survived\nthe initial 2-year period, and had reported that women had less\ndeterioration of IADL and ADL functional statuses. Our re-\nsults demonstrate that women as a group have better outcomes\nat each initial disability level. Thus, considering functional sta-\ntus, from the single-state model men and persons moderately\nADL disabled appear to have the highest risks for a change in\nstatus over 2 years. Men were more likely to die, and also sub-\nsequently, men who remain in the community appear to have\nless disability than women. Women, however, appear more\nlikely to be institutionalized than men, perhaps a consequence\nof their better survival with disability (Manton, 1990). Persons\nwho lived with others at the beginning of the period had higher\nodds for being severely ADL disabled and lower odds of being\ninstitutionalized during the period.\nIndependent of initial functional status and all other vari-\nables considered, each of the health status measures signifi-\ncantly predicted the outcomes studied. Variables representing\nthe presence of musculoskeletal-related morbidity (MSD) and\ncardiovascular diseases (CVD) were constructed to capture\nthese highly prevalent forms of morbidity associated with dis-\nability among elderly persons (Fried & Guralnik, 1997). MSD\nwas included to exemplify a slow, progressive disease, while\nCVD exemplified a faster-paced disease which may have more\nimportance in predicting disability over relatively short time\nintervals. While we found, as others have (Crimmins & Saito,\nMSD and CVD related diseases is associated with greater dis-\nability, there were no distinct patterns in disability risk between\nmorbidity groups with the exception of a trend for persons ever\nhaving CVD, to be more likely to become institutionalized\nthan those without CVD (however, the 95% CI for the odds in-\ncluded 1.0). The interaction effects between CVD and MSD\nwith time were non-significant. Thus, we did not find evidence\nthat declines with CVD occur at a faster pace than with MSD\nthat was predicted by Manton and Soldo (1992) from cross-\nsectional data from the LTCS. Verbrugge and colleagues\n(1992) found arthritis was associated with less death and insti-\ntutionalization than non-arthritic illnesses over a 2-year period\nin the LSOA. However, our model used a different morbidity\ncategorization and controlled for baseline perceived health sta-\ntus and number of illnesses. In a more extensive analysis (data\nnot shown), we found that over a 6 year interval functional sta-\ntus declines associated with having MSD appeared slower than\nwith CVD. This was evidenced by larger odds for having\nthese estimates was above 1.0 for the odds only with MSD.\nThus, in our study, only when we allowed for appreciable attri-\ntion from mortality over a longer time period did a differential\npattern of disability emerge by disease type.\nGeneral health status has also been shown to predict disabil-\nity and mortality among elderly persons (Borawski, Kinney, &\nincrease in the number of illnesses from the LSOA list of\nprevalent conditions was associated with increasing odds for\ndeath. Reporting perceived health status as either \"excellent/\nvery good\" or as \"good\" versus \"fair/poor or missing\" was\nstrongly associated with less disability and a smaller probabil-\nity of death and institutionalization in the period, adjusting for\nall other covariates. Subjective appraisals of health in the\nLSOA, as in other large epidemiological studies, are robust\npredictors of functional transitions and mortality (Kaplan &\npsychological well-being, general physical illness states, and\nlevels of disease severity which may be more crudely captured\nby diagnostic categories.\nThe central contribution of our study to the literature on\nfunctional transitions was our test of the two-state model.\nCombining reinterview information on functional status from\nseveral 2 -and 4- year periods, we demonstrated that the proba-\nbility of functional transitions is dynamic. Specifically, proba-\nbilities based on status 2 years prior is dependent upon disabil-\nity 4 years prior. Information from a previous state,\nincorporated with that from a recent state, significantly refines\nmodels of disability risk. This study builds upon the work of\nWolinsky and colleagues (1993) who first demonstrated that\nfunctional health status between two time points was signifi-\ncantly associated with later period institutionalization and\ndeath. Our two-state models for functional transitions were de-\nrived from all 2-year and 4-year time periods to overcome the\nproblem of data sparseness given the sample size and transi-\ntion events in the LSOA. Still, in many cases the odds ratios\nand 95% confidence intervals become large, and we must cau-\ntiously interpret trends in the data when the confidence inter-\nvals just include 1.0.\nThe 2-year transitions obtained in the LSOA revealed con-\nsiderable and statistically significant heterogeneity based upon\nstatus 4 years prior, and using two time periods resulted in im-\nproved discrimination of functional transitions over single-\nstate models. Wolinsky and colleagues (1993) similarly found\nthat two-state models more precisely predicted nursing home\nplacement. An unanticipated finding was that an initial transi-\ntion in functioning involving improved status (as well as an\ninitial decline), can bode for subsequent decline. This suggests\nthat, for some elderly persons, even positive transitions may\nsignal general instability rather than processes underlying re-\ncovery or vitality as is implicitly assumed in the literature (e.g.,\nclosely examine this occurrence, and more broadly identify\ncovariates of a previous functional decline which modify the\nrisk of subsequent transitions using data inclusive of lifestyle\nfactors, health promoting practices, and post-hospitalization\nhealth care. Much of this information is not available in the\nLSOA. We also need to learn more about not only how to pre-\nvent declines, but also how to lengthen the rebounds from\nfunctional loss by promoting healthy lifestyles and timely\nhealth care.\nOur study has some potential limitations. First, there is little\ndata in the literature on the reliability of functional status infor-\nmation over time in the circumstance when there has been no\nchange in status. This measurement property has not been\nquantified in the LSOA; however, we assume that this error is\nrandom, and, hence, diluted the precision of our estimates and\nour ability to observe patterns in functional transitions. The use\nof proxy reports for functional status information when the re-\nspondent was too sick or otherwise unable to complete the\nLSOA interview may have resulted in systematic error. There\nare too few conclusive studies documenting costs and benefits\nof using proxy reports in gerontological studies (Moore, 1988;\nRodgers & Herzog, 1989), and some have found proxy reports\nto be more reliable then respondent reports (Rodgers &\nHerzog, 1989). Several factors argue against removal of prox-\nies in the LSOA (Crimmins & Saito, 1993). Since the most\ncommon reason for proxy reports was respondents' physical\nand mental impairment, eliminating the latter would seriously\njeopardize the representativeness of the sample data. Most\nproxy reports of functional status information in the LSOA are\nprovided by persons living within the household of the respon-\ndent, and who are thus capable of providing quality informa-\ntion. Another caveat of our results is that our measurement\nscale for disability compared three hierarchical levels of dis-\nability, which differentiated between IADLs and ADLs com-\nmon in gerontological research (Weiner et al., 1990). However,\nrecent scaling work with these measures (Fitzgerald, Smith,\nMartin, Freedman, & Wolinsky, 1993; Johnson & Wolinsky,\nthat ADLs have a more complex structure, such as a cognitive\ncomponent and advanced activities and further, that some do-\nmains of ADLs have differential predictive validity for transi-\ntion, such as nursing home placement and mortality. Thus, ad-\nditional insight on risk for functional status instability in\ntwo-state models may be gained by examining these different\ndimensions of ADLs. We also could not examine subsequent\nperiod outcomes associated with adaptation to functional dis-\nability, per se, and in the context of impairment. Hence, it is\nuncertain whether those with reported improved status, yet\nhigher risk for subsequent declines, have inherent health insta-\nbilities patterned as cycles of recovery and recurrent illness\nepisodes, or whether short-term, yet appreciable, gains in func-\ntioning were realized from adaptations to disability. Successful\nadaptation to disability may result in gains in functioning,\nlengthening the time spent without severe disability. The\neffectiveness of adaptations may also be hypothesized to vary\nby disease type. With acute life-threatening diseases, such as\nsevere CVD, adaptation might produce relatively small gains\nin subsequent period functioning as compared to the gains pos-\nsible from slower paced chronic diseases, such as arthritis, for\nwhich gradual declines in functional status over time from dis-\nuse may be substantially avoided (Buchner & Wagner, 1992).\nThe considerable plasticity in functioning is intriguing from\na health care and policy perspective. There appears to be a\nresidual potential that at least some of the variability observed\nmay be affected by early interventions aimed at maintaining\nfunctioning in older adults, and to sustain improvements in\nfunctioning with timely interventions. Models which identify\nthose who are at highest risk for instability may require func-\ntional status information from more than one time interval.\n"
