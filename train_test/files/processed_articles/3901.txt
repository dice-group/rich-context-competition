We do not propose here to provide\nany sort of `how to' guide on access, data collection or writing. Instead, we hope to help\nattune potential laboratory ethnographers to some of the themes they may choose to col-\nlect data about and to analyse. In doing so we take lead from Atkinson (2015), in that we\nseek to identify `some generic phenomena, some generic social processes, that repay\nclose and systematic attention'(2015: 2). We do so through a set of ethnographic vignettes\nthat report novel findings from our own laboratory ethnographies to explicate certain\nways of thinking. Key to our perspective is the commitment to the interactionist tradition\nin ethnographic work that focuses upon interactive practice and the detailed observation\nof how scientific work is accomplished through interaction (Atkinson, 2015; Atkinson\nWe begin with a brief introduction to the STS tradition of laboratory ethnography\nbefore outlining the specific field sites we have worked in that we draw upon later in the\narticle. We then articulate a set of related themes through which the ethnographer may\nwish to situate their own fieldwork: the epistemic and the extended laboratory; the inter-\naction order; sensory ethnography (both learnt and created); spaces, places and rhythms,\nand the performativity of conferences. Each of these accounts develops themes articu-\nlated in Atkinson (2015) by applying them in the context of STS through our own field-\nwork sites. Importantly, by stressing the themes interrelated nature, we re-emphasise that\ngood ethnography should never try to explain all that is observed through one explana-\ntory mechanism, nor should it try to explain what is observed through every explanatory\nmechanism.\nKnorr Cetina (1995) claims the first published laboratory study was Thrill (1972),\nalthough Lynch's 1974 fieldwork was the first true to the STS tradition (Lynch, 1985a).\nShe divides early STS work into (i) the controversy studies of Bloor (1976), Collins\n(1975) and Barnes (1977) that looked at how scientists assert legitimacy for their knowl-\nedge claims during disputes, and (ii) `the study of unfinished knowledge' that closely\ninspects science in the making (Knorr Cetina, 1995: 140). This second group, led by\nTraweek (1988), most keenly employed the detailed ethnographic observation of day-to-\nday work to document how normal scientific knowledge is accomplished. This given,\nthese authors still adopt different approaches to their laboratory studies, with Latour and\nWoolgar employing the `anthropologist of science'(1986: 27) perspective through which\nmundane scientific practice is treated as a strange and alien culture, in contrast to Knorr's\n(1977) focus on understanding the scientific work as the scientists do. Lynch, a student\nof Harold Garfinkel, pursued an ethnomethodological approach.\nHess (2001) labels all of these early studies `first generation' STS ethnography, with\ntheir focus on `the way in which concerns with evidence and consistency were interwo-\nven with situationally contingent events, local decision-making processes, ... the inter-\npretative flexibility of evidence ... and other social or non-technical factors' (2001:\n234). He contrasts this with `second generation' STS ethnographies that are orientated\ntowards social problems, with a wider range of field sites beyond the physical working\nspaces of scientists to study lay groups, social movements, and political activities. The\nwork we describe here remains within the working spaces of scientists, fitting Hess's\n`first generation', and continuing an ongoing strain of STS pursuing ethnography within\nargue the importance of fieldwork, in our case in scientific workspaces, as a rewarding\nand satisfying research endeavour, and we hope to inspire further work in this form. In\nwhat follows, we articulate what to observe and how to think about scientific work-\nspaces through examples from our own work.\nIn the remainder of this article we draw upon five of Neil Stephens' projects: (i) an\nethnography with an interdisciplinary team of stem cell scientists, engineers, and physi-\ncists, who sought to produce novel imaging technologies for cell culturing; (ii) Neil's\ncurrent work in a laboratory developing robotic surgical tools to aid the implantation of\ncochlear implants; (ii) a yearlong project seeking to sonify the culturing practice of cell\nbiologists in order that other scientists could better understand the protocol used through\nsound alone; (iv) a four-year ethnography of the UK Stem Cell Bank, an institution that\nholds all human embryonic stem cell lines in the UK and regulates their use (Stephens\net al., 2008, 2011); and (v) an ongoing eight-year study of scientists who seek to tissue\nengineer meat for human consumption (O'Riordan et al., 2015; Stephens, 2013,). We\nalso use two of Jamie Lewis'ethnographies: (vi) a twelve-month study of a Huntington's\nDisease research laboratory and animal house (Lewis and Atkinson, 2011; Lewis et al.,\n2013; Lewis et al., 2014); and (vii) a laboratory conducting work in the genetics of neu-\nropsychiatric conditions. While our ethnographies have been conducted independently,\nwe have also written comparative work on Jamie's Huntington's disease (HD) study and\nNeil's work in the UK Stem Cell Bank (Stephens et al., 2013). These two projects also\ninvolved Paul Atkinson as a team member.\nWe report previously unpublished findings from these ethnographic sites as a set of\nvignettes to provoke reflection on what laboratory ethnography can do, and how ethnog-\nraphers can go about doing it.\nEthnography of the epistemic\nThe classic theme of laboratory ethnography is that scientific knowledge production is\nan accomplishment and, as such, the epistemic is situated and cultural (Hess, 2001;\nKnorr Cetina, 1995). While we believe ethnographic work can fruitfully move beyond\nfocusing upon this alone, it remains vital that this fundamental focus upon the epistemic\nis not lost, and that new ethnographies continue to explore knowledge production as situ-\nated within new technical domains and new political contexts. The epistemic component\nof laboratory ethnography was foregrounded in Jamie's work in a laboratory testing the\nefficacy of cells grafts to alleviate symptoms of HD. The laboratory functioned through\na set of relations between four spaces: the `dry' laboratory, where mathematical analysis\nis conducted; the `wet'laboratory, where experiments are conducted, and in this case, the\nbrains of rodents are analysed; the `clinic', where patients were enrolled into clinical tri-\nals; and the `animal house', where rodents are kept, cared for, and prepared for experi-\nmental procedure.\nCentral to Jamie's analysis is the production and use of what are known as `animal\nmodels': animals - frequently rodents \u00ad that have been subject to physical\ninterventions and discursive and documentary regimes to configure them as models of\nhuman disease states. Jamie was told that in the case of HD the disease is reduced to a\nlimited set of phenomena \u00ad for example, gait, attention span, balance - that are ren-\ndered observable in the animal models. These models are induced using three main\nstrategies: inactivating an existing gene (knock-out rodents), inserting a foreign gene\n(transgenic rodents), or making a non-genetic change (lesioned rodents), with each\nstrategy intended to mimic the observable cognitive and motor deficits of patients with\nHD. As Jamie has shown elsewhere, typically establishing such equivalence involves\naccepting good-enough solutions based upon the judgements and skillsets that inform\nthem (Lewis et al., 2013). Here, we analyse an instance when Jamie observed these\njudgements and skillsets in action in the animal house while watching the training of\nmice for a balance test.\nA technician was busy with four small cages containing a mixture of normal and\ntransgenic grey mice. The technician explained that the next day she would be running\nthe test `for real' during which she would not know which ones were transgenic. For\nnow, however, it was fine for her to know as she focused upon training the mice to\nwalk up a raised thin ramp leading to a fixed box at the top. The ramp was tapered,\ngetting thinner as it went, allowing her to test the hypothesis that transgenic mice\nwould struggle with the ascent as their feet, mirroring some of the behaviours associ-\nated with HD, slipped off the beam. She explained to Jamie that initially the bar was\nnot raised, but the experiment did not work, because the mice simply remained at the\nend they were placed. She suggested raising the ramp to encourage the mice to move.\nAs each mouse was placed with their tail facing the box (their heads facing away), they\nwere encouraged to turn and scuttle up the beam into the house where they would be\nrewarded with a treat. The technician tested all twenty mice and timed their ascents,\nwith some moving with agility and others more clumsily. Jamie asked the technician\nwhether those that struggled to walk up the beam were the transgenic mice. She smiled\nsaying `yes, well, for the most part', but explained that some mice are simply not that\ngood at walking up the bar. Presumably, some mice, like some humans, are more com-\nfortable with heights than others. The time data of all the ascents were sent to the PI to\nrun some statistics, with the technician explaining that the PI is `brilliant at finding\npatterns in numbers'.\nThe role of technicians is often under-represented in the scientific process (Shapin,\n1989). It was clear, though, that the technician's skills and judgements were paramount\nto modelling aspects of HD in the laboratory. There are clearly multiple reasons why a\nmouse may or may not walk up a beam swiftly with some of these nothing to do with any\ngenetic manipulation. As someone who has studied, cared for, and trained the mice, the\ntechnician was able to provide further context about the mouse's performance, gaining\nan insight into its personality, its walking ability, its likes and dislikes. This tacit knowl-\nedge, gleaned from the day-to-day labour and skilled handling of animals, is constitutive\nof the epistemic work of HD. In concert with the statistical and observational work of the\nother laboratory spaces, the animal house, as part of the extended laboratory, contributes\nto the accomplishment of scientific knowledge, which is made not discovered, through\nsituated and culturally informed practice. This is a well-made point in ethnographic STS,\nbut still one to which ethnographers should remain attentive.\nThe interaction order of scientific meetings\nCentral to the work of any ethnographer is the study of interaction. Team meetings are\nkey sites of the interaction order (Goffman, 1983); they are local and intimate encoun-\nters that deserve detailed ethnographic inspection. To achieve this, the laboratory eth-\nnographer can draw upon the insights of conversation analysis, and analysis of the\nembodied and material aspects of performance, without necessarily engaging in fully-\nfledged conversation analysis transcript work (Atkinson, 2015). Neil's study with the\ninterdisciplinary group of stem cell scientists, physicists, engineers, and chemists\nexplored this in terms of the boundary-work and performative display of disciplinary\nidentity during the project's day long group meetings. Importantly, the account not only\nargues that interdisciplinary work is performed, but details how this performance occurs,\nand how asymmetrical relationships within it are embedded within a mundane interac-\ntional grammar.\nThe meetings Neil observed were intended to bring together the entire consortium\n(normally based in three separate campuses across two cities) to update each other on\nprogress, ensure all team members were getting the support they needed, check where\nthe group were in relation to their milestones, and to foster an interdisciplinary environ-\nment. They occurred every three months, with each hosted by a different disciplinary\ngroup, in their respective departmental building. Such mobility was intended to capture\nthe sharing of disciplinary spaces and the non-hierarchical environment sought by the\nteam. Despite different geographical settings, the meetings retained a standardised pat-\nterning in their temporal, spatial, and interactional structuring. While the rooms used\ntook various shapes - from long and narrow, to square - the team members frequently\nformatted the furniture around a rectangle of tables, allowing each attendee to face each\nother for discussion or face a speaking position and projector for presentations.\nThe meetings also retained a formal structure starting with a greeting by the Principal\nInvestigator (PI) who would remind the group of the milestones and the project timeline.\nThis was followed by two or three forty-minute talks from postdocs, followed by lunch\nand then another two forty-minute talks, before a closing PI raises once more the mile-\nstones set for the next three months. An informal structure also quickly arose featuring a\nlayered use of language based around disciplinary expertise. During presentations, or in\nconversations addressing the whole group, speakers would typically soften the most eso-\nteric terminology in an attempt to develop a mutually accessible repertoire. Often during\nformal presentations, or during group discussion, subsets of more specialised discourses\nwould occur concurrently. The physicists, the engineers, or the cell biologists, would\nhave hushed conversations employing specialist terminology accompanied by gestures\nsuch as moving the hands close to the face, and lower volumes of talk, to minimise intru-\nsion of this disciplinary talk into the group space.\nThis layering of a shared group repertoire and closed specialist repertoire, the differ-\ning material and embodied practices that support them, and the occasional interruptions\nthat disrupt it, are both performative of, and responsive to, the doing of the interaction\norder of this interdisciplinary meeting space. However, Neil notes it was clear that one\nspecialist terminology \u00ad that of cell culturing \u00ad held a privileged position above other\ndisciplines, in that the esoteric cell biological terminology interrupted and dominated the\nshared discussion space more frequently, and for longer durations, than any other phras-\ning. Group esoteric physics discussions, for example, were held between few speakers,\nrarely lasted long, and typically handed topic control back to the shared group through\nrepair work like `we'll discuss this later', accompanied by hand gestures identifying a\nsmall subset of team members. In contrast, group esoteric cell biological discussions\ncould be extended, with turns exchanged between multiple speakers with expertise in\ncell culturing unhindered by interruptions from others, or a sense that such language\nexcluded non-biologists. This asymmetric intrusion and turn-taking captures a moral\norder within the team meeting; in this case, prioritising cell biology, but potentially\nfavouring other disciplines when found as a structural component of interaction in other\nsettings. The work of the ethnographer is to note not only its occurrence, but also the\nmundane interactional features upon which its performance is based.\nSensory ethnography: learning what's sensible\nSTS is increasingly attentive to multimodality, with long standing interests in the visual\nmented with a growing literature on the audible (Mody, 2005; Pinch and Bijsterveld,\n2012), and new works focusing upon touch, taste, and smell (Alac, 2011; Greiffenhagen,\n2014; Nishizaka, 2011).Afocus upon the sensory remains in ethnographic work, with some\nreminding us to retain the long-standing tradition of sensory attentiveness (Atkinson,\nethnography attuned to emplacement (Pink, 2015).\nNeil has conducted two laboratory ethnographies that focus on how epistemic and\ntechnical innovation is rendered sensible through interaction, employing the dual mean-\ning of sensible as both perceivable and comprehensible. The first is an example rendering\nthe imperceptible as sensible, and is based on an account of his very first encounter in the\nrobotic surgery laboratory.\nThe robotic surgical tool laboratory developed a range of devices, but the main focus\nof their work at the time of the ethnography was a drill designed to cut through human\ntissue (skin, fat, muscle) with high precision and the capacity to predict what tissue lay\njust ahead of its current position. The primary purpose the laboratory developed it for\nwas to aid in operations to insert cochlear implants into the inner ear while reducing\ndamage to the hearing tissues.\nWithin the first ten minutes of being by the laboratory bench, Neil was shown the\nrobotic surgical drill. The silver handheld device was rectangular; around 16cm in\nlength, with a small drill bit extending a few cm from one end, with coiled wires run-\nning from the other end to a laptop perched above more computer hardware. It had\nalready been explained to him that, based upon existing modelling of tissue, the drill\nand its software could predict what tissue type lay just ahead of it as it drilled into the\nbody basing its calculations on force and torque readings from the drill bit itself. In use,\nthe drill could be held by a surgeon pushing it into the inner ear and towards the sensi-\ntive and important hearing tissue of the endosteal membrane. The one automated func-\ntion of the drill was to stop, based on its prediction of the immediate tissue environment,\njust as it touched the membrane, but without damaging it. This precision, Neil was told,\nwould be impossible for a surgeon unaided. The measurements were imperceptible to\nhumans because they were so small.\nOver the course of the ethnography, it became clear that the laboratory had a number\nof strategies for rendering this imperceptible precision sensible. On day one, Neil partici-\npated in what had become something of a welcoming ceremony for visitors to the labora-\ntory, and a key guided practice in experiencing the drill's sensitivity: the act of drilling\ninto an egg. The lead scientist retrieved an egg from the laboratory fridge, and demon-\nstrated how the tool could drill through the shell of the egg but would stop when it\ntouched the membrane that separated shell from the egg white without damaging the\nmembrane. Neil was then given the opportunity to try himself. Pressing the drill, as it\ndrilled into the eggshell, the soft vibrations of the tool were perceivable, as was the drill-\ning sound. Neil had never drilled into an egg before, and knowing how much pressure to\napply was not obvious. The scientist encouraged him to push harder as the shell pow-\ndered and a small hole less than 2mm wide was created. Holding the drill straight was no\nsimple task for a complete beginner, and Neil had several aborted attempts as the drill\nslipped, leaving half-finished holes in the egg's surface. The moment of the first success-\nful drill was marked by the predictive capacity of the drill itself, as its algorithms deter-\nmined the membrane had been reached, and the drill, and its accompanying noise and\nvibrations, ceased.\nRemoving the drill, the scientist gestured toward the successful hole as evidence of\nthe tool's precision. Neil, again demonstrating no native competency, was not sure what\nhe should see and how this confirmed anything. To him, the successful hole, and the\nholes from the multiple aborted attempts, all looked the same. The scientist assured him\nthey were different, and took the egg to a microscope so the holes could be better\ninspected. After a few moments of balancing the egg, finding the holes, and focusing the\nmicroscope, the scientist invited Neil to view the magnified image, which again to Neil\nappeared as a set of white circles. Explaining the image, the scientist provided an account\nof how the white of the membrane was different to the white of the shell. Neil surmised\nthat, since this membrane tone of white extended continuously across the hole, that the\nmembrane was, as suggested, undamaged and that the drilling was successful.\nThis account then demonstrates just one strategy of how the drill's imperceptible\nsensitivity is rendered sensible, both perceivable and comprehensible. This was accom-\nplished through a choreographed demonstration based upon multi-sensory experience.\nThe sensory alignments of feeling and hearing the drill, seeing the white circles (by\nnaked eye and microscope), and having their interpretation narrated, was performative of\nthe drills capabilities. It invoked a particular interpretation of a sensory realm, which was\ntaught and enacted through interaction.\nSensory ethnography: creative sensory alignments\nThe second of Neil's ethnographies on the sensory in scientific work explored what those\ninvolved in the project called `the Stem Cell Orchestra'. Here, Neil was both participant\nin, and ethnographer of, the research team. The core interdisciplinary group consisted of\ntwo musicians, two biologists, Neil, and a bioinformatician. Bioinformatics is a special-\nism that applies computing to biology, often in the context of `big data' (Lewis and\nBartlett, 2013). This project was based upon developing the team's in-house bioinfor-\nmatics software `ProtocolNavigator'. The programme was designed to replace cell biol-\nogists' lab books with an electronic version that could record the procedure of each\nexperimental protocol, share it with other scientists, and display the protocol via a novel\nflowchart based graphical interface. The challenge of the Stem Cell Orchestra was to add\nsonification to the software so that protocols could be translated into an audible represen-\ntation as opposed to a visual one, and to articulate why the audible version improved\nscientific practice. Like the robotic egg surgery example, this account again highlights\nthe sensory alignments required in sharing interpretations of an epistemically productive\nsensory realm. However, the two cases differ in that while the egg example performed a\npre-scripted set of actions, interpretations, and sensitising practices, the Stem Cell\nOrchestra case examples the creative production of a sensory realm and the interactional\nencounters invoking the alignments that render their interpretation sensible.\nCell culturing research is usually conducted at a hooded cell culture bench. Cells are\nseeded into wells in a plate, expanded within the well, harvested out of the well, washed,\nand seeded again into new wells. During this ongoing reseeding process, drugs, dyes or\ngrowth factors can be added to some of the wells (while others are left untouched as\ncomparative controls) to record what difference the added materials make. Experiments\ncan last several weeks, and typically involve short bursts of reseeding activity separated\nby long periods of incubation during which the cells remain untouched. In this case, the\nlaboratory was working with cancer cells and adding the dye DRAQ7. As an ethnogra-\npher, Neil observed and audio recorded team meetings. As a contributor to the project\nfrom an STS perspective, he articulated the challenges of recording, sonifying, and then\nsharing an essentially tacit cell culture practice.\nTo help sonify the DRAQ7 protocol the musicians would first have to understand how\nit worked. This involved lengthy discussions at team meetings and visits to the cell cul-\nture laboratory to watch and video record the experiment being conducted. They observed\npipetting, felt the warmth of the incubator, and knelt down to hear the clicking of the\nfridge as it cooled down to the appropriate temperature. They asked questions, joked\nabout the complexity, and articulated the rhythms of seeding, harvesting, and incubating.\nBack in team meetings, they would sit with synthesisers, pre-recorded sounds, or impro-\nvised vocalisations to suggest soundscapes and earcons that capture both the essence,\nand some epistemically valuable content, relating to the cell culture work (cf. Supper,\n2015 on how sonification experts do similar in conferences).\nOver the course of a year, a sonic repertoire of rhythms, melodies, and harmonic\nratios were developed that led up to a defining moment in the first feedback session,\nwhen cell culturers from outside the core group joined a project meeting to hear the\nresults, and discuss whether they could make sense of them. During this meeting, a\nnovel sensory realm was articulated, through playing sounds, watching an accompany-\ning visual animation, conversation, and the embodied work of gesturing, humming, and\ntapping out rhythms. Through these processes of in situ negotiation, the group agreed\nthat some key components of cell culturing practice were recognisable, and thus sensi-\nble, in the sonification, while others were said to be missing the mark. For example, the\nrich sustained string sound was agreed to capture the warmth of incubation, and the\ncymbal recognised as demarking the passage of time, although the exact amount of time\nremained unclear. Through re-listening, suggestive comments, and invocations of prior\nexperiences of laboratory work or musical environments, the group agreed on the par-\ntial emergence of a sensible sensory realm; one in which new alignments between cym-\nbal rhythms and hours of incubating, and piano chords and cell culture well plates,\nmade the sonification of bioinformatics cell culture protocol software a perceivable and\ncomprehendible practice.\nAs both the robotic surgery and the Stem Cell Orchestra examples show, laboratories\nare sensory spaces, replete with both phenomena to be sensed and technologies that\nsense. They are also sites of interaction and shared sense-making around the proper inter-\npretation and enactment of these sensory alignments. Laboratory ethnography offers the\nopportunity to document not only the work these sensory realms achieve, but also how\nthey are accomplished through interaction. By attuning their analysis to a multi-modal\nsensuousness the ethnographer can work to further extend the reach of STS beyond the\nvisual into the interconnections of sensory epistemics.\nSpaces, places and rhythms\nEthnographic fieldwork is not conducted in vacuum, it is situated, and we should con-\nsider the choreography of social life in these spaces (Atkinson, 2015). Space bannisters\n\u00ad simultaneously constrains and guides \u00ad social life and work, shaping the organisation\nof everyday life in situ. The scientific workspace is no different in this regard to any other\nplace of work. Laboratory ethnography therefore benefits from attending to the rhythms\nof day-to-day work, the movements and flows of matter and matters, transformations and\ntransitions, and boundaries and barriers.\nScientific work is accomplished, furnished and anchored in the laboratory. These\ncome in different shapes and sizes: some are large and spacious; others small and con-\nfined, some are busy and heavily populated, others quiet and conspicuous by the absence\nof workers. Many are gated communities; others are linked closely to clinics and hospi-\ntals. Some are distant from the city and prying eyes (for example, the UK Stem Cell\nBank, Stephens et al., 2008) and some are transient spaces that pop-up as portable pack-\nTo reflect the importance of place and space in biomedical work, Neil, with col-\nleagues, coined the term performative architecture to describe how the organisation and\narchitecture of buildings reflects and frames the social actions within it (Stephens et al.,\n2008). The UK Stem Cell Bank building is therefore simultaneously symbolical and\npractical, performing aspects of cleanliness, sterility and safety. These ideas develop\nupon Thrift (2006) who comments on the `radical redesign of scientific space, reflected\nin the construction of numerous new performative buildings' (2006: 292). New life sci-\nence buildings such as these, he argues, are designed not only to intentionally produce\nintense social action between scientists, but are also built to reflect the state and status of\nbioscientific innovation.\nJamie's ethnographic work articulates another, different, example. He studied a group\nworking on psychiatric genetics that recently left their old laboratory space in an early\n2000s building attached to a working hospital, to move to a purpose-built, state-of-the-\nart construction, similar to those described by Thrift. Architecturally, the laboratory's\nnew building has clean lines and razor sharp edges symbolising the cutting-edge work\nconducted inside. The glass exterior is not only modern but enacts the transparency and\naccountability of the work inside. The cathedral like atrium on the bottom floor has a\nlarge white space that performs openness, welcoming visitors and publics, yet the revolv-\ning access door means that guests cannot simply slip in unaccounted. There is also a\ncoffee shop, a large lecture theatre, two training rooms and a hub for postgraduate\nresearch activity.\nThe building has a rhythm; weekday mornings and afternoons are the domain of the\nresearcher and support staff, public events are confined to late afternoons/early evenings,\nand only the deadline or experimental protocol-tied researcher and the occasional secu-\nrity guard are seen at night or weekend. The building also has multiple purposes: it is\nhome to a hospital research clinic as well as an out-of-sight animal house.\nThe different functions of the building's spaces are contested. The open plan offices\non floors 1, 2 and 3 are shared between the laboratory and another research institute.\nThey work to provide durability to the social networks, symbolising collaborative and\ninterdisciplinary research by creating a critical mass of expertise. Big science, we are\ntold, requires scientists coming together co-located in these innovative incubators\n(Thrift, 2006). However here the symbolic and the functional come into conflict, as the\nsymbolic openness of glassless windows in the shared atrium allows the noise of mul-\ntiple users to reverberate through the offices spaces upstairs. This is escalated during\nlate afternoon and early evening public events downstairs, in which film showings,\nchoirs, or school visits create an overlapping sensory realm of differing interpretations\nof what constitutes reasonable noise. Staff complain about the volume inhibiting their\nconcentration, through informal conversations, emails, and formal requests for action.\nSome seek alternative working spaces. This contestment overlays the hierarchies of the\nbroader institution. Senior researchers and academics are provided with their own,\nquieter, offices, mid-career academics with shared offices, and early career researchers\nare located in the hubbub of the open plan area. When the flows of noise lead to the\nunderuse of the building, the spare office space is offered to PhD students from other\ndepartments, for whom space restrictions mean they have no desk in their own disci-\nplinary spaces. In this way, the building becomes a different type of interdisciplinary\nspace, more performative of the frustrations of resource limitations and design blun-\nders than innovative capacity.\nSpaces, places and temporalities are locally occasioned, locally ordered and locally\nnegotiated. Architectures, as physical things, give durability to the functional and sym-\nbolic work imagined by their creators, but they retain some flexibility in the reconfigura-\ntion of their physical and symbolic ordering, which occurs through the interactions of\npeople in, around, and through these spaces (cf. Gieryn, 2002). They can be contested\nand reconfigured, be that through the simple rearranging of furniture in the `three\nmonthly meetings' or the move to install glazing in open plan areas. Ethnographers\nshould be attentive to these spaces, places and temporalities. In studying their choreog-\nraphy and interactional forms orchestrated through them we see that place is always in\nthe making (Hurdley, 2015), often sedimented, but rarely settled; it is an accomplishment\nworthy of study.\nConferences as performative sites\nConferences are a key set of encounters in which scientific fields come together to inter-\nact, yet they remain under-analysed in STS (Gonz\u00e1lez-Santos and Dimond, 2015; Supper,\n2015). Claims and counter-claims are made, bonds are confirmed or broken, and new\nideas are presented as part of the pathway to rendering them legitimate and knowable.\nBoth presenting papers, and being an audience member, are types of performance that\nrequire analysis of how they are put together (Atkinson, 2015; Dimond et al., 2015).\nEating spaces, hotel lobbies, and mingling opportunities are also important sites of sci-\nentific work.\nConferences form part of the calendar, frequently on an annual basis, and, beyond just\npresentations, host award ceremonies, early career researcher support opportunities,\njournal editorial board meetings, and academic society AGMs. In established disciplines,\nthe conference works to reinforce a field's identity through performances of progress that\nretain continuity with the past. They have a grammar, an interaction order, which is rec-\nognisable across multiple disciplines.\nHere, we focus on Neil's research on a new, emergent, field: `cultured' or `in vitro'\nmeat. The technology involves the application of tissue engineering (a typically bio-\nmedical practice) to producing meat. Cells are taken from an animal (typically an agri-\ncultural animal, but any animal is possible) and expanded under laboratory conditions\ninto larger quantities of muscle tissue that is then presented as food. Laboratory research\nin the field began just after the millennium, beginning with as few as two laboratories\nactive and today perhaps as many as ten. The field had its highest profile moment in 2013\nwhen the world's first laboratory grown hamburger was cooked and tasted at a London\npress conference intended to publicise the potential environmental, ethical, and health\nbenefits of a meat made `outside of a cow' (O'Riordan et al., 2016). The field remains\nsmall, and spreads across the university and private sector. Every so often, a new labora-\ntory will display its latest prototype product accompanied by promissory accounts of\nhow close it is to commercialisation (often tempered by issues about how much future\nfunding could be made available). The field remains optimistic that progress is being\nmade and that initial high end products will be delivered in the near future.\nNeil's work studies the ontological ambiguity of this technology to explore how the\nfield seeks to establish a stable categorisation of tissue engineered muscle as food and, in\nsome instances, as meat as we know it today (Stephens, 2013). Here, we explore the role\nof conferences as key sites of this work as participants operate to produce a shared nar-\nrative among themselves, and perform that narrative beyond the field.\nBetween 2008 and 2015, four key conference-like international events occurred in the\nfield. The second, the `European Science Foundation Exploratory workshop in In Vitro\nMeat'was held in Gothenburg in 2011, with Neil in attendance. The event was genuinely\na meeting place; many of the scientists present had never met (or in many instances even\nemailed) the scientists from other countries. The workshop's introductory character was\nfelt across the event through those initial handshakes, the presentations on preliminary\nfindings, and the closing press conference in which the technology was introduced to the\nSwedish press.\nThe event featured an explicit conversation among attendees on the naming of\ntheir technology and, by implication, their field. The merits of many names were\narticulated, but the main contenders were the existing `in vitro meat' and the keenly\nadvocated for (by a small portion of attendees) `cultured meat'. More than `a name'\nwere at stake in this discussion, as the very status of the technology and the partici-\npants' research programmes were implicated. The term `in vitro' remained the prefer-\nence for some participants as it was seen as the scientifically accurate phrase. That\nsaid, it was recognised that the term could alienate some people in a way less likely\nwith `cultured', which benefitted from the combined meanings of `cell culture', `fer-\nmented' and `artistic or classy' (cf. Datar, 2015). `Cultured' was embraced by some\nwho deemed it more appealing to potential consumers, and was accepted by others\nbecause the cell-culturing element meant it remained within a scientific repertoire.\nHowever, it was clear many in the room would not accept a term that distanced the\nscience altogether; many present identified themselves as basic science researchers,\nnot marketers, and that any name would need to be of the scientific realm, with a\nsubsequent renaming of the technology to be led by a different set of professionals\n(perhaps in public relations) in a future moment once the technology shifted from\nresearch to commerce. As such, through the exchange on naming, the field were\ndefining themselves, the proper category of work they engaged in, and the status of\nthe technology and the tissue itself.\nAll conferences do work: they site interaction and perform and enact moments of\nscience-in-the-making. For the ethnographer, they provide valuable research opportuni-\nties whatever the status of the field. In studying what is accomplished and how accom-\nplishment happens at conferences the laboratory ethnographer can only enrichen their\nunderstanding of scientific practice and improve their studies.\nConclusion\nEthnography should be attentive to the diversity of practices, orders, and frames of inter-\npretation enacted in the contexts studied, while still producing a focused account that\ndoes not try to explain everything through everything (Atkinson et al., 2008). This is true\nof the laboratory as it is of any other field site. In this article, we have provided a set of\nethnographic vignettes intended to provoke reflection upon some of this diversity, while\nretaining a focus upon how scientific work is accomplished through interaction, set in\nand through spaces, places and rhythms, including the extended laboratory and the con-\nference. We have no problem with Hess' second wave of STS ethnography moving\nbeyond the laboratory and encourage this work, although we do not report on it directly\nhere. Instead, we have reasserted the classic STS focus on the epistemic context of\nknowledge in the making and controversial science, while emphasising the interaction\norder and the sensory realm. We have done so to provoke laboratory ethnographers to\nconsider the structural forms that routinely shape scientific practice in their own work. In\nthis regard, the article is a call for the continued reinvigoration of laboratory ethnogra-\nphy. We hope people will be confident in their ethnography, attentive to diversity, and\ncontinue to produce ethnographically grounded STS.\n"
