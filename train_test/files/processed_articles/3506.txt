    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) replicates many clinically relevant features of human essential hypertension and\nalso exhibits behavioral symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and dementia. The SHR phenotype is highly\ncomplex and cannot be explained by a single genetic or physiological mechanism. Nevertheless, numerous studies including\nour own work have revealed striking differences in central catecholaminergic transmission in SHR such as increased vesicular\ncatecholamine content in the ventral brainstem. Here, we used immunolabeling followed by confocal microscopy and elec-\ntron microscopy to quantify vesicle sizes and populations across three catecholaminergic brain areas--nucleus tractus\nsolitarius and rostral ventrolateral medulla, both key regions for cardiovascular control, and the locus coeruleus. We also\nstudied colocalization of neuropeptide Y (NPY) in norepinephrine and epinephrine-containing neurons as NPY is a common\ncotransmitter with central and peripheral catecholamines. We found significantly increased expression and coexpression of\nNPY in norepinephrine and epinephrine-positive neurons of locus coeruleus in SHR compared with Wistar rats.\nUltrastructural analysis revealed immunolabeled vesicles of 150 to 650 nm in diameter (means ranging from 250 to\n300 nm), which is much larger than previously reported. In locus coeruleus and rostral ventrolateral medulla, but not in\nnucleus tractus solitarius, of SHR, noradrenergic and adrenergic vesicles were significantly larger and showed increased NPY\ncolocalization when compared with Wistar rats. Our morphological evidence underpins the hypothesis of hyperactivity of\nthe noradrenergic and adrenergic system and increased norepinephrine and epinephrine and NPY cotransmission in specific\nbrain areas in SHR. It further strengthens the argument for a prohypertensive role of C1 neurons in the rostral ventrolateral\nmedulla as a potential causative factor for essential hypertension.\n",

Recent experiments with optogenetic activation of\nC1 neurones in the RVLM have further implicated this\ncell group in a variety of other physiological processes\nincluding arousal and breathing (Burke et al., 2014;\nCotransmission is a common feature of peripheral and\ncentral N/E-ergic neurons (Teschemacher and Johnson,\n2009). For example, although C1 neurons in the RVLM\nsynthesize and release catecholamines, these neurons are\nalso equipped with the machinery for glutamatergic sig-\nAbbott et al., 2014). In addition, many studies have\ndocumented that, in the periphery as well as in the\nbrain, N/E-ergic neurones frequently coexpress neuro-\nGray, 1995). Moreover, it is well established that NPY\ncan be coreleased with N/E in the periphery (Lundberg\nJohnson, 2010) and that cotransmission modulates N/E\nsignaling in context of blood pressure control (Chalmers\nHerring, 2013). A mouse model in which NPY is over-\nexpressed in N/E neurones globally has elevated sympa-\nthetic activity and is prone to stress-induced\nhypertension, supporting the idea that NPY contained\nwithin N/E-ergic fibers plays a role in sympathetic drive\n(Ruohonen et al., 2009). Within the CNS, NPY also\ninfluences cardiovascular regulation, but the effects are\nmediated via multiple pathways and may be sympatho-\nexcitatory or -inhibitory, depending on the brain area\nNPY is acting upon (Vallejo and Lightman, 1986; Fuxe\ntral N/E\u00adNPY cotransmission was demonstrated in a\nstudy where the RVLM was stimulated, causing not\nonly an increase in blood pressure via the descending\nexcitation of spinal preganglionic sympathetic neurons\nbut also release of NPY immunoreactivity into the sub-\nThere is a consensus that N/E in the brain are predom-\ninantly released from nonjunctional varicosities and\nmodulate regional circuitry via volume transmission\n(O'Donnell et al., 2012). An increasing body of evidence\nsupports the idea that astrocytes are a primary target for\ncentral N/E release and essential for mediating modula-\ntion of synaptic transmission in healthy brain function\nvolume transmission mode calls for N/E storage in\nlarge dense core vesicles (LDCV) located outside of pre-\nsynaptic zones (Trueta and De-Miguel, 2012). Although\nprevious electron microscopic (EM) studies ascribed two\ndistinct vesicle populations to central N/E-ergic neurons,\nsmall clear vesicles (diameter range 40\u00ad60 nm) and LDCV\n(80\u00ad120 nm), the evidence for functional N/E storage\nindeed appeared stronger for the LDCV population\nNirenberg et al., 1995). The first direct evidence that\nthis type of release actually exists in the brain came\nfrom our microamperometric recordings, which demon-\nstrated rare but very large quantal release events in cen-\ntral N/E-ergic neurons (Chiti and Teschemacher, 2007),\nwhich could not be easily explained by the earlier EM\nobservations. However, a comparative and quantitative\nanalysis of N/E-containing vesicular populations across\nseveral N/E-ergic nuclei of the brain has never been per-\nformed. Moreover, it was never tested whether a patho-\nlogical phenotype associated with altered central N/E-\nergic transmission may be associated with ultrastructural\nchanges in the N/E-ergic vesicular populations.\nAn obvious pathology to focus on in the context of\nincreased central N/E activity is neurogenic hypertension.\nWe therefore chose to draw comparisons between a con-\ntrol rat model, the Wistar rat (WR) and the spontan-\neously hypertensive rat (SHR), which shows a complex\n2 ASN Neuro\nphenotype consistent with overactivity/overreactivity in\ncentral N/E transmission. Not only is this strain a com-\nmonly used model for studying essential hypertension\net al., 2012), but it also carries traits consistent with fea-\ntures of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD;\ndementia (Sabbatini et al., 2002). Using microampero-\nmetry, we demonstrated earlier that in SHR, there is a\nmajor shift toward much larger N/E quantal release\nevents in the RVLM, but up to now there was no\nknown morphological correlate for these surprisingly\nlarge release events.\nGiven the paucity of information about the types of\nN/E-containing vesicles in the brain and their costorage\nof NPY, we decided to undertake an EM study using\nmore advanced methods of tissue fixation and immunola-\nbeling, which have been developed specifically by others\nand ourselves to preserve fragile vesicular structures\nimmuno-gold labeling of dopamine-b-hydroxylase (DbH)\nand vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) with\nvalidated antibodies at the ultrastructural level. By com-\nbining light fluorescent microscopy and EM, we have\nobtained by far the greatest sample of measurements of\nN/E-ergic vesicles in mammalian CNS to date. The aim of\nthe current study was twofold. Our first objective was to\nmap NPY coexpression in central N/E-rgic neurons rele-\nvant to hypertension and ADHD, based on three of the\nmost relevant N/E-ergic groups: A6 in the LC, A2 in\nthe NTS, and C1 in the RVLM. Second, we intended to\ncarefully evaluate the N/E containing vesicular structures\nin these groups, in order to get a clear view of their sizes\nand NPY content and any differences between the WR\nand the SHR strains.\nMaterials and Methods\nAnimals\nAnimal experiments were carried out in accordance\nwith the U.K. Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986,\nconsistent with the Guide for the Care and Use of\nLaboratory Animals published by the U.S. National\nInstitutes of Health (NIH Publication, 8th Edition,\n2011), and approved by the University of Bristol\ngroup-housed an enriched environment under a\nstandard 12-hr light/dark cycle, with free access to food\nand water. Experiments were conducted in nine adult\nLaboratories, UK), with three animals of each strain allo-\ncated to confocal microscopy and, to EM analysis, three\nanimals each for brainstem preparations and for LC,\nrespectively.\nImmuno-Fluorescence Confocal Microscopy\nAnimals were terminally anesthetized using pentobarbital\n(400 mg/kg i.p.) and perfusion-fixed transcardially with\n4% paraformaldehyde. Sections of 40 lm were prepared\nfrom the brainstem and pons regions on a freezing micro-\ntome. Free floating sections (40 lm) were placed in block-\ning solution for 1 to 2 hr (3% goat serum; 1\u00ad2% bovine\nserum albumin (BSA); 0.1% phosphate buffered solution\n[PBS]-Triton X-100) at room temperature and subse-\nquently incubated with primary antibodies (1:200 DbH\nmonoclonal, kind gift of Dr. Grouzmann, Lausanne) in\nThe DbH antiserum was previously characterized in\nWestern blots, as well as by immunohistochemistry stu-\ndies, where it selectively labeled N/E-ergic neurons,\nand, at a subcellular level, both secretory vesicle lumen\nand vesicle membranes (Nosjean et al., 2002; Fortune\nalso reliably labeled central N/E-ergic neurons in all\nestablished locations. The NPY antiserum provided by\nDr. Grouzmann belongs to the immunoglobulin G1 sub-\nclass with high affinity to the 11 to 24 amino acid epitope\nregion and with no cross-reactivity for peptide YY and\npancreatic polypeptide (Grouzmann et al., 1992).\nSections were then incubated in Alexa Fluor anti-\nrabbit-594 (Invitrogen) and Biotin anti-mouse (Vector),\nfollowed by Streptavidin-Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-\nbody (Invitrogen) for 1 to 2 hr, respectively. Negative con-\ntrols were performed by omitting the primary antibody.\nFluorSave (CalBiochem) was used to mount sections.\nFluorescent images were acquired with a confocal laser\nscanning microscope (Leica SP1, Leica Microsystems,\nWetzlar, Germany). For each animal, approximately 66\nbrainstem sections containing NTS (44 rostral and 22\ncaudal, relative to the area postrema), 40 sections for\ncaudal ventrolateral medulla, 33 sections for RVLM,\nand 20 pontine sections containing LC were evaluated.\nAVV Transduction\nTissue for EM processing was selected from N/E-ergic\nneuron-dense areas in NTS, RVLM, and LC, which\nwere preselected by specific expression of enhanced\ngreen fluorescent protein under the control of the\nPRS\u00c28 promoter using adenoviral vector (AVV) trans-\nTeschemacher et al., 2005). The approach has the advan-\ntage of labeling living neurones, allowing us to rapidly\nlocalize and preselect N/E-ergic areas for EM sample\npreparation.

Twelve to fifteen days following AVV transduction,\nthe animals were sacrificed with an overdose of pentobar-\nbital (400mg/kg, i.p.) and perfusion-fixed transcardially\nwith 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Brain sections of\n200 mm were sliced with a vibratome (Camden\nInstruments, Loughborough, UK), and green fluorescent\nN/E-ergic cells were identified under a fluorescence micro-\nscope (Leica DM IL LED; Leica Microsystems). A tissue\npuncher (Leica) was used to extract 1-mm circular tissue\nblocks that were incubated in cryoprotectant (20% bovine\nserum albumin, 100 mM trehalose in PBS), loaded into a\n0.2-mm deep carbon-coated membrane carrier (Leica\nMicrosystems), and subjected to (virtually instantaneous)\nhigh pressure freezing (EM PACT2 \u00fe RTS; Leica\nMicrosystems; Verkade, 2008). Samples were subsequently\nfreeze-substituted (AFS2 \u00fe FSP, Leica Microsystems) and\nembedded in Lowicryl HM20 as previously described (van\nsliced (Reichert Ultracut E) and placed on Pioloform-\ncoated copper slot grids (2\u00c2 1 mm; Agar).\nUltrastructural Immuno-Gold Labeling\nGrids were placed on 100 mM glycine in PBS to quench\naldehyde and then in 0.1% BSA-cTM (Aurion,\nWageningen, the Netherlands) in PBS (blocking solu-\ntion). This was followed by incubation of alternating sec-\ntions in primary antibodies of either of the two N/E-ergic\nmarkers, DbH (1:20 rabbit polyclonal; Abcam, see ear-\nlier) or VMAT2 (1:40 rabbit polyclonal; Millipore\nof Dr. Grouzmann as described earlier), in blocking solu-\ntion for 1 hr. The specificity of the VMAT2 antiserum\n(rabbit polyclonal; Millipore AB1598P) had been previ-\nously established by multiple Western blot and immuno-\nhistochemistry studies, including subcellular distribution\nusing electron microscopy (Liu et al., 1994; Peter et al.,\nfirmed by substitution of the primary antibody with non-\nimmune serum or by preadsorption of the primary\nantibody with the peptide antigen. In our study, the anti-\nserum labeled the membrane of LDCV, following a pat-\ntern consistent with DbH immunolabeling and in an\nidentical pattern to that described by previous work in\nboth rat brain tissue and the adrenal gland (Peter et al.,\nSections were subsequently labeled with secondary\nantibodies (10-nm colloidal gold donkey antirabbit for\nDbH/VMAT2 and 15-nm colloidal gold goat antimouse\nfor NPY; Aurion) in blocking solution for 45 to 60 min.\nSections were then counterstained in 3% uranyl acetate\nand lead citrate. Images of the ultrastructure and\nimmuno-gold labeling were acquired on a Tecnai12\nBiotwin transmission electron microscope equipped with\na bottom-mount 4 \u00c2 4k CCD camera (FEI company,\nEindhoven, the Netherlands). Immunolabeling was opti-\nmized to achieve efficient labeling of N/E-ergic vesicles\nwhile minimizing nonspecific gold staining, which was\nconfirmed by the absence of gold particles from structures\nrenowned for background labeling, such as nuclei, mito-\nchondria, and myelin sheaths. Negative controls were\nperformed by omitting primary antibodies, which\nresulted in the absence of gold labeling in all brain\nareas examined.\nEM image analysis was performed on four to six sec-\ntions per resin block per rat (n \u00bc 3) for each brain region.\nThis approach yielded statistically significant outcomes\nand allowed consistent random sampling of the ultra-\nstructure and antigenicity representative for each investi-\ngated brain region. The horizontal and vertical radii of\nvesicles were measured in Fiji/ImageJ, and they were\naveraged for the purpose of further evaluation. DbH\nand VMAT2 labeling appeared in a consistent pattern\nof dense core vesicles, with VMAT2 labels observed asso-\nciated with vesicular membranes and DbH labeling seen\nat either membrane or lumen of the vesicle. The size dis-\ntributions and number of vesicles labeled by the two mar-\nkers were alike and thus pooled for analysis.\nStatistical difference between vesicle distributions\nbelonging to different brain areas in either WR of SHR\n4 ASN Neuro\nwas studied by application of the two-sample\nKolmogorov\u00adSmirnov (KS) test (http://www.physics.\ncsbsju.edu/stats/KS-test.n.plot_form.html).\nMathematical Model for Extrapolation of Imaging\nData to Vesicle Population Distribution\nTo reconstruct distributions of real vesicle diam-\neters based on our imaged sections, we used a mathem-\natical model based on weighted contributions of\nrandomly sectioned coexisting subpopulations of spher-\nical objects.\nSectioning of a sphere-like object results in discs of a\nrange of diameters, from 0 at its base and apex, to the\ntrue diameter through the center of the sphere\n(Figure 1(a)). In a more complex setting, if multiple\nspheres of different sizes are sectioned simultaneously,\nany but the largest resulting disc may stem from a smaller\nsphere, cut closer to its center, or from a larger sphere,\ncut at a level more distant from its center. EM image\nanalysis yields cross sections of such a heterogeneous\npopulation of sphere-like vesicles at random levels, occa-\nsionally including sections through their largest diameter\nat their centers. Therefore, analysis of vesicle sections\nunderestimates the true vesicle diameters and skews the\nsize distributions leftward (Figure 1(b)).\nTo estimate the real vesicle diameter distribution in\nour study, we modelled the overall vesicle size distribu-\ntion using the weighted contributions of coexisting vesicle\nsubpopulations, optimizing the weighting by least-\nsquares linear regression to fit the observed data. With\nequal probability of optical sectioning of a vesicle at any\nlevel, from base through center to apex, we assumed\nequal distribution of sin (f) between \u00c01 and \u00fe1\n(Figure 1(a)). The resulting diameters of each section\nthen correspond to 2 \u00c2 cos (f) scaled to the true vesicle\ndiameter (D) as obtained through sectioning the vesicle\ncenter. For any given vesicle population with a uniform\ndiameter, EM imaging is therefore predicted to yield a\ndistribution of optical cross sections, which is negatively\nskewed with a maximum bin corresponding to the true\nvesicle diameter (Figure 1(b)). We used a template which\nassumes that all vesicles are optically sectioned with equal\nprobability at 1-nm distances and which incorporates ves-\n(Figure 1(b) to (e)). By weighting the contributions of\neach vesicle size group, we simulated a distribution that\ncorrelated well (linear regression R2 > .95) with our raw\ndata (Figure 1(e)). The solution of the problem closely\nresembles the approach described by Wicksell (1925) and\nis applicable to a size range of below one order of mag-\nnitude as in the present study. This simple approach may\nbe easily followed using widely available spreadsheet soft-\nware (e.g., Microsoft Excel; see Online Supplemental\nMaterial).\nResults\nDbH and NPY Expression and Coexpression at Light\nMicroscope (Cellular) Level\nConfocal imaging of WR as well as SHR brain sections\nrevealed that the majority of neuropeptide Y releasing\n(NPY-expressing) neurons across all investigated N/E-\nergic cell groups coexpress DbH. Viewed from the other\nperspective, the majority of N/E-ergic cell bodies in ros-\ntral NTS (A2 neurons), caudal ventrolateral medulla (A1\nneurons), and RVLM (C1 neurones) coexpressed NPY\n(Figure 2(a) to (c), (e)). In contrast, the caudal part of\nthe NTS contained more N/E-ergic and fewer NPY-ergic\ncells as compared with the rostral NTS (Figure 2(c)),\nresulting in a lower degree of colocalization in both rat\nIn the LC, the area with the highest density of N/E-\nergic neurons, only partial colocalization of N/E with\nNPY was found (Figure 2(c)). Here, a significant differ-\nence was observed between WR and SHR. Although the\nnumber of DbH-expressing cells was similar (Figure\n2(d)), NPY-positive cells were much more abundant in\nleading to a higher degree of DbH-NPY colocalization\nFigure 2).\nEvidence of Preservation of Ultrastructure and\nAntigenicity of N/E-ergic Vesicles in EM Samples\nThe EM approach employed in this study was optimized\nfor the best compromise between preservation of ultra-\nstructure and antigenicity of tissue from NTS, RVLM,\nand LC. Dehydration issues appeared to be minimal,\nbased on the insignificant cytosolic extraction, and freez-\ning artifacts were also, in general, absent as indicated by\nthe intact appearance of nuclei, the delineation and struc-\ntural integrity of the nuclear, vesicular, and plasma mem-\nbranes, and preservation of myelin sheaths (Figure 3;\nBrown et al., 2009). Organelles such as the endoplasmic\nreticulum, ribosomes, Golgi, mitochondria, multivesicu-\nlar bodies, and individual synapses were easily recognized\n(Figure 3). Small clear vesicles sections of 40 to 60 nm\ndiameter and LDCV sections of over 80 nm and varying\nelectron opacity were clearly identifiable (Figure 3).\nLDCV were spherical or slightly ellipsoid, with a trend\nto deviation from spherical shape in the larger vesicles\n(Figure 3(d) to (f)). Antigenicity was well maintained as\nconfirmed by immunolabeling with colloidal gold par-\nticles for DbH and VMAT2 (10 nm gold) and NPY\n(15 nm gold); small clear vesicles and most dense core\nvesicles of diameters under 120 nm were unlabeled\n(Figures 3 and 4). Labeled LDCV were found in peri-\nkarya, as well as putative dendrites, putative varicosities,\nKourtesis et al. 5\nFigure 1. Extrapolation of imaging data to true vesicle population distribution by a mathematical model which corrects for eccentric\noptical imaging.

In WR, the distribution\nand was skewed toward the right, with mean and median\ndistribution of N/E-ergic LDCV was shifted to the right\nurements are consistent with markedly larger sizes of cen-\ntral N/E-ergic LDCV than had been reported by earlier\nstudies.\nDetailed analysis revealed significant area-specific dif-\nferences in LDCV section sizes. While NTS and RVLM\npopulations in WR were not significantly different from\none another and were strongly right skewed, both differed\nsignificantly from the more normally distributed LC\npopulation (Figure 5(b)). In SHR, the RVLM contained\na population of N/E-ergic LDCV, which was significantly\nlarger than that in NTS but significantly smaller than that\nfound in LC (Figure 5(c)).\nIn the NTS, N/E-ergic vesicle populations were not\ndifferent between WR and SHR (Figure 6(a), left and\n6(d)). However, in RVLM as well as LC, SHR tissue\ncontained larger vesicles (Figure 6(a), middle and right,\n(e), and (f)). The distribution of diameters of NPY-\npositive LDCV was not significantly different to what\nwas found for N/E-labeled LDCV in the corresponding\nN/E-ergic sections (Figure 6(a) and (b)). However, the\nnumber of NPY-positive vesicles appeared higher in the\nRVLM of SHR as compared with WR. Thus, the signifi-\ncant differences between WR and SHR in RVLM and\nLC, as described earlier for N/E-ergic LDCV, also held\nfor NPY-labeled vesicle sections (Figure 6(b)) and for the\nsubpopulation of vesicles colabeled for N/E and NPY\n(Figure 6(c) to (f)). These data suggest a significant\nincrease in N/E-ergic vesicle size and in the frequency\nof colocalization with NPY in RVLM and LC of SHR.\nReconstruction of Vesicle Size Distributions by\nCorrection for Eccentric Optical Sectioning and\nEstimation of Intravesicular N/E Concentration\nSectioning of cell organelles occurs at random and there-\nfore diameter measurements based on EM images of the\nvesicles will underestimate their true diameters and vol-\numes. Using our mathematical model (see Methods sec-\ntion, Figure 1), we simulated the distribution of the true\ndiameters of vesicles from which the EM image measure-\nments were taken. The model weights the contribution of\ndifferently sized vesicle groups to the total population and\npredicts the resulting distribution of optical sections. We\nassumed a mixed population of different sized vesicles\nand weighted each size group individually to optimize\nthe correlation between EM data distribution curves\nand simulated data.\nThis analysis suggested that across the three brain\nareas investigated, in WR, 57% of labeled N/E-ergic ves-\n(Figure 7(a)).\nIn SHR, only 20% of N/E-ergic vesicles belonged to\n(Figure 7(a)). Therefore, large vesicles were much more\nabundant in SHR.\nWhen applying the regression model to the different\nN/E-ergic brain areas separately, the resulting true vesicle\ndistributions retained the overall shape of the vesicle\nimage distributions (Figure 5), but, as expected, the\npeaks were slightly right shifted as vesicles were now\nrepresented by their maximal diameters rather than off-\ncentered, smaller cross sections. Smaller diameter\n(<150 nm) vesicles were no longer represented in the\nrandomly from a uniform population of vesicles with D \u00bc 500 nm.

In WR, major\nin SHR were not only shifted to larger diameter\nranges but were also broader and showed multiple\npeaks (Figure 7(c)).\nThese observations consistently suggest that, in the\nSHR, there is area-specific reorganization of catechol-\namine packaging in a way, which would favor release of\nlarge transmitter quantities upon individual fusion\nevents.\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we combined EM with confocal imaging\nand mathematical modeling to characterize central N/E-\ncontaining vesicles at a new level of precision. Our new\ndata help to explain how central N/E neurons operate in\nthe volume transmission mode. We also mapped central\ncoexpression and colocalization of N/E and NPY at cel-\nlular and vesicular levels. To investigate the cross-links\nbetween central N/E-ergic and NPY-ergic transmission,\ncontrol of blood pressure, and modulation of impulsivity,\nwe compared these transmitter systems between WR and\nSHR, a genetic rat model with altered catecholaminergic\ntransmission.\nAt cellular level, we found considerable but area-\nspecific overlap between N/E-ergic and NPY-ergic\nsystems and differences in colocalization in the LC of\nthe SHR. At the ultrastructural level, we established a\nclear morphological correlate for the previously detected\nextra large quantal N/E release events and revealed that\nin SHR, there are many more large LDCV in the pre-\nsympathetic C1 area and in the A6 group, which is likely\nto affect the physiological consequences and cellular tar-\ngets of these central modulator systems. This analysis has\nbeen made possible by the combination of the advanced\ncryo-preservation methods used here with the greatly\nincreased probability of locating N/E processes in the\ntissue by fluorescence microscopy prescreening.\nRemarkably, we found specifically labeled N/E-ergic\n400 nm for WR and SHR, respectively. This size range is\nconsiderably larger than documented by previous litera-\nture for the brain, although comparable to adrenal chro-\nmaffin granules, and consistent with volume\ntransmission, particularly as their location was invariably\nremote from synapse-like structures. Quantal content of\ncatecholaminergic vesicles is related to their volume\n(Colliver et al., 2000), and large quanta, once released,\nare more likely to saturate local transport/reuptake mech-\nanisms and allow farther diffusion of N/E to reach more\nremote and a wider range of target cells. Previous work\nfrom our own group for the first time described central\nexocytotic N/E release and measured quantal sizes using\namperometry in explants from rat brainstem of young\nrats (Chiti and Teschemacher, 2007; Teschemacher\net al., 2008). The majority of exocytotic events released\naround 105 molecules of N/E per quantum but larger\nevents ranging up to 107 N/E molecules were detected.\nIf we assume similar vesicle anatomy in young and adult\nrats (as used in the present study), our current findings\nput us in the position to estimate vesicular volumes, cor-\nrelate them with quantal size, and thus suggest intravesi-\ncular N/E concentrations of around 10 mM in NTS and\nEarlier studies appear to have overlooked large-sized\nvesicle populations, potentially due to use of detergents\nand resulting diffuse reaction products that may have\nlimited the spatial resolution and accurate distinction\nbetween adjacent vesicles. On the other hand, we may,\nto some extent, have underestimated and biased against\nthe populations below 150 nm in diameter because we\noptimized our labeling procedure to enhance specificity\nat the cost of labeling density. Indeed, when comparing\nvesicle imaging data with simulated true LDCV diam-\neters, actual detected N/E-ergic vesicles were found less\nfrequent in the lower range of bins up to 100 nm than our\nmodel predicted (Figure 1(e)).\nDespite the obvious similarities, such as their overall\ncellular morphology and their ability to synthesize\nFigure 2.

We hypothesize that changes in these parameters\nmay correlate with described functional deficits in the\nSHR. A potential driver for vesicle enlargement in SHR\nmay be the upregulated expression of intravesicular N/E-\nchelating proteins such as chromogranin A (O'Connor\nInterestingly, N/E-ergic vesicles in LC were larger than\nin other inspected areas in both, WR and SHR, but in\nSHR the shift toward larger sizes was particularly dra-\nmatic. A parallel shift to larger diameters was seen for\nNPY-labeled vesicles in SHR. The fraction of N/E-NPY\ncolocalizing vesicles was increased from 41% in WR to\n54% in SHR, whereby in both rat strains, the NPY-cola-\nbeling was found in the larger of N/E-ergic vesicles. While\nit is still under debate whether the symptoms of ADHD\nrepresent hyper- or hypofunction of the central N/E-ergic\nsystem, it is generally accepted that an optimum N/E-\nergic tone in the prefrontal cortex is required for ade-\nquate executive function, where release must be counter-\nbalanced by uptake transporter activity (Russell and\net al., 2012). Conversely, an unbalanced NPY-ergic\nsystem has been implicated as potential causative factor\nnificant changes in NPY expression levels across different\nbrain areas have been reported in SHR (Maccarrone and\nJarrott, 1985).

Overall expression and coexpression of\nN/E and NPY in the RVLM were, however, not different\nat the light microscopic level, indicating that the same\nneuronal population has increased transmitter levels\nand cotransmission in the hypertensive strain.\nImportantly, the increased vesicle sizes in SHR are in\nagreement with larger quantal sizes, which we observed\nin amperometric recordings from prehypertensive RVLM\ntissue (Teschemacher et al., 2008). This, in turn, is\nexpected to result in an increase of the impact and\nrange of signaling in SHR and may anatomically under-\npin the prohypertensive function of C1 activity as a\nFigure 7.

This lack of difference between\nrat strains was reflected in similar size distributions of\nN/E-ergic and NPY-ergic vesicles, and an only modest\nincrease in colocalization of both transmitters in N/E-\nergic vesicles from 24% in WR to 32% in SHR.\nTherefore, for A2 neurons in the NTS, the morphological\nevidence is also in agreement with earlier amperometric ana-\nlysis from our group, which had suggested a comparable\nrange of quantal N/E-ergic release events in young prehy-\npertensive WR and SHR (Teschemacher et al., 2008).\nWhile a large body of previous work and our own\nstudy provide clear functional links between signaling\nmediated by N/E and NPY, the exact nature of this inter-\naction is still elusive. As NPY activates several types of\nGi\n-protein-coupled receptors which may be located pre-\nor postsynaptically with respect to N/E-ergic neurons\nor their axonal projections, predictably, the effects of\ncotransmission are complex and area specific (Gehlert,\n2004). In addition, nonneuronal brain cells must be\ntaken into account as, according to recently published\ntranscriptomes of mouse forebrain, astrocytes express\npredominantly b1-, and also a1- and a2-adrenoceptors\nand Y1 receptors at lower levels (Cahoy et al., 2008;\nZhang et al., 2014). Clues on the functional impact of\nNPY cotransmission can be gained from studies that\nhave applied NPY into N/E-ergic brain areas or sites\nreceiving N/E-ergic input. For example, in the LC, Y2\nreceptor activation enhances N/E-ergic signaling and is\nimplicated in anxiolytic actions, while Y1 receptors\nappear to counteract Y2 actions (Illes et al., 1993;\nKask et al., 1998). Regarding cardiovascular regulation,\nNPY within the RVLM as well as NTS was shown to\nmodulate blood pressure differentially via antagonistic\nactions of Y1 and a2-adrenoceptors or of Y1 and Y2\nreceptors (Diaz-Cabiale et al., 2007). Interestingly, simi-\nlar to N/E, NPY also acts on astrocytes where it induces\nglycogenolysis (Sorg and Magistretti, 1991), which will\ninevitably lead to release of L-lactate. The recent discov-\nery of a signaling role for L-lactate in the brain possibly\nopens a new avenue here, as it seems feasible that the\nlarger vesicles in SHR with higher NPY content would\nallow more effective recruitment of astrocytes by chem-\nical signals released by N/E-ergic cells (Tang et al., 2014).\nWe believe that this interaction needs to be studied fur-\nther in order to clarify how a shift in the vesicular content\nof N/E or NPY affects the signaling between N/E-ergic\nfibers and their downstream targets.\nIn summary, we have performed extensive quantitative\nanalysis of central N/E-containing vesicles and\ncolocalization between N/E and NPY at light and EM\nlevel. This has allowed us to draw a numerically repre-\nsentative comparison between WR and SHR, a widely\nused model for essential hypertension and ADHD.\nChanges which were detected in the SHR are consistent\nwith the notion of altered catecholaminergic signaling\nand suggest that area-specific aberrant transmitter release\nmechanisms reflect the specific neurological and behav-\nioral phenotype of SHR.\nSummary\nIn an animal model for hypertension and attention-defcit/\nhyperactivity disorder, the storage compartments\ncontaining adrenaline-like signaling molecules were sig-\nnificantly larger in specific brain areas and contained\nmore of the chemical comessenger, neuropeptide Y, sug-\ngesting an extended and altered signaling range.\n"
