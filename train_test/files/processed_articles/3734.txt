Sixty-seven children aged 9 years completed an assessment of motor competence (measured using\nthe Movement Assessment battery for Children), physical fitness (assessed using the Test of Physical Fitness), and reading\n(measured using the Wordchain test). The testing procedures were repeated after 32 months. For the 9-year-old group,\nthere was a low, negative correlation between motor competence and reading overall, r = -.031 (girls: r = -.207; boys: r =\n.180). Correlation between fitness and reading was also low (r = .064). Girls had a higher correlation between fitness and\nreading than boys (r = .404; 17.7% shared variance, vs. r = -.138). When the children were 12 years old, there was still a low\nassociation of motor competence and fitness with reading. These low associations can be used to support the task specificity\nprinciples of learning.\n",

Although there has been research\nperformed on this topic for many years (see, for example,\nAyres, 1965), the renewed interest may be caused by concern\nthat today's children do not maintain appropriate levels of\nphysical activity and physical fitness (Tremblay et al., 2011),\nand there have also been reports of declining motor compe-\ntence (Bardid, Rudd, Lenoir, Polman, & Barnett, 2015;\nKambas et al., 2012). Despite the known benefits to health\nevidence suggests that many children do not meet the recom-\nmended amount of daily physical activity (Kolle, Steene-\nJohannessen, Andersen, & Anderssen, 2010; Verloigne et al.,\n2012). In addition, evaluation of education systems world-\nwide by testing children's skills and knowledge in important\nkey subjects may have increased the focus on academic\nresults and efforts to improve the educational systems (The\nProgramme for International Student Assessment [PISA]).\nSeveral mechanisms related to changes in brain structure\nand cognitive function have been discussed when explaining\nthe possible effects of physical activity on brain health in\nchildren (for a complete overview, see reviews by Donnelly\nNiemann, 2013). The constructs of physical activity, physi-\ncal fitness, cardiovascular fitness, and motor competence are\ninterrelated, but the results indicate that these different\naspects of exercise and activity are differently associated\nwith the brain structure, cognition, and function (Haapala,\nfitness and higher cardiovascular fitness in children has been\nrelated to a larger volume of the subcortical structures such\n1Department of Psychology, Norwegian University of Science and\nTechnology, NTNU, Trondheim, Norway\n2Reykjavik University, Reykjavik, Iceland\n3Department of Neuroscience and Movement Science, Norwegian\nUniversity of Science and Technology, NTNU, Trondheim, Norway\n*These authors contributed equally to this work.\nCorresponding Author:\nHermundur Sigmundsson, Department of Psychology, Norwegian\nUniversity of Science and Technology, 7491 Trondheim, Norway;\nReykjavik University, Reykjavik, Iceland.\nEmail: hermundurs@svt.ntnu.no\nAssociations of Physical Fitness and Motor\nCompetence With Reading Skills in 9-\nand 12-Year-Old Children: A Longitudinal\nStudy\nHermundur Sigmundsson1,2,*, Kjellrun Englund1,\nand Monika Haga3,*\n Keywords\nlongitudinal, movement skills, physical activity, academic performance, children\n2 SAGE Open\nas the basal ganglia and hippocampus (Chaddock et al.,\nare more fit have a higher integrity of white matter micro-\nstructure and cortical thickness (see Hillman et al., 2017).\nThese structures are related to the modulation of executive\ncontrol such as inhibition, memory, cognitive flexibility, and\nattention, which are cognitive operations that often are\nreferred to as \"gate keepers\" to learning and academic\nachievement (Voelcker-Rehage & Niemann, 2013).\nMore recently, studies on the association between motor\ncoordination and cognitive function in children have emerged\nbetween this kind of research and specific brain structures\nand functions is unclear. According to Koutsandr\u00e9ou,\nWegner, Niemann, and Budde (2016), improvement of the\nworking memory is significantly better for children undergo-\ning motor exercise compared with a cardiovascular exercise\ntraining group and a control group. It is suggested that coor-\ndination and motor skill learning taps into the neurophysio-\nlogical motor system to a greater extent than the metabolic\nprocesses involved in fitness and physical activity, and that\nthis has specific mechanistic effects on the brain structure\nand function via influence of the neural synapses and net-\nwork (Koutsandr\u00e9ou et al., 2016; Voelcker-Rehage &\nNiemann, 2013). The underlying mechanisms that are differ-\nent between types of physical activity and brain structure/\nfunction are diverse and complex, and they are beyond the\nscope of the present study.\nReading is a skill that, in many societies, will determine\nsuccess because decoding of written text to attain meaning is\na prerequisite to gain knowledge from books. The reading\nprocess presupposes the graphemic encoding of visually pre-\nsented words that in turn is recoded into speech and meaning\nis activated in semantic memory corresponding to compre-\nhension (Revlin, 2013).At some point in the reading process,\nthere is a need to recognize individual words. Word decoding\ncan be defined as \"the accurate and fast retrieval of the pho-\nnological code for written word forms\" (Verhoeven, 2011, p.\n38) and has a central role in children's reading development\n(Stanovich, 2000). Age differences are intuitively present in\nreading, but sex differences are also found; girls display bet-\nter general reading comprehension compared with boys\n(Mullis, Martin, Kennedy, & Foy, 2007). Sex differences are\nalso observed in word processing because physiological evi-\ndence reveals differences in event-related field patterns dur-\ning word recognition, that is, more strength of activation and\ninvolvement of different neural structures in women (see, for\noverview, Walla, Hufnagl, Lindinger, Deecke, & Lang,\nhemispheres are equally involved in word processing com-\npared with males where the left hemisphere is more involved,\nthat is, hemispheric asymmetry. However, researchers have\nalso suggested that there is a strong influence of sex hor-\nmones on cognitive functions (Kimura, 1996) and cerebral\nlateralization (Geschwind & Galaburda, 1985). In this\nrespect, Geschwind and Galaburda (1985) argued that testos-\nterone slows down the development of the left hemisphere\nduring prenatal period. This causes difference in abilities\nbetween the genders, girls being superior in verbal abilities.\ndefined physical fitness as a set of inherent or achieved per-\nsonal attributes that relate to the ability to perform physical\nactivity. Physical fitness is a multifaceted concept, and some\nfitness components included in this term seem to be espe-\ncially important markers of various health outcomes in\nyoung people, namely cardiorespiratory fitness, flexibility,\nmuscular fitness, and speed/agility (Ortega, Ruiz, Castillo, &\nSj\u00f8st\u00f8m, 2008). Muscular fitness is the capacity to perform\nwork against resistance, while speed and agility is the ability\nto move quickly and change direction of the body rapidly\nand in a controlled way (Gallahue & Ozmun, 2006).\nCardiorespiratory fitness is the overall capacity of the cardio-\nvascular, respiratory, and skeletal muscle system to use oxy-\ngen for energy production, and it has been positively\nassociated with cognition and brain health. Castelli, Hillman,\nBuck, and Erwin (2007) found that a higher aerobic fitness\nperformance (measured by Pacer, 20-m shuttle run) was pos-\nitively related to reading achievement (p < .001) among chil-\ndren in the third and fifth grades. Children with a higher\ncardiovascular fitness are also found to perform better com-\npared with their less-fit peers in executive function processes\n(e.g., memory, attention, and inhibitory control; Chaddock\nthe findings that executive functioning is a mediator of the\nrelationship between physical fitness and academic achieve-\nment (Van der Niet et al., 2014). Moreover, a higher fitness\nlevel in children affects the speed of the neuroelectric\nresponses associated with specific language processing abili-\nfound no association between cardiovascular performance\n(assessed by a maximal exercise test with cycle ergometer)\nand academic skills. Similarly, Kantomaa et al. (2013) did\nnot find any association between cardiovascular fitness and\ngrade-point average in adolescents. Moreover, van der Niet\net al. (2014) showed that the different measures included in\nphysical fitness (including 20-m shuttle run, 10 \u00d7 5-m shuttle\nrun, sit-ups, and standing broad jump) correlated differently\nwith the academic outcomes of interest (mathematics, read-\ning, and spelling). For example, standing broad jump had\nhighest correlations to academic performance, then 20-m\nshuttle run, 10 \u00d7 5-m shuttle run, while sit-ups had the lowest\ncorrelation. Other fitness components, such as muscle fitness\nand flexibility, did not relate to academic achievement (gen-\neral academic achievement, reading, and mathematics;\nCastelli et al., 2007). In addition, an intervention study by\nBassin and Breihan (1978) found no significant improve-\nments (p > .05) in reading achievement after a period of\nexposure (3 times a week, in \u00bd-hr sessions during a 20-week\nperiod) to different motor activities (including coordination\nand rhythm, agility, speed, strength, flexibility, balance, and\nSigmundsson et al. 3\nendurance) among children in the second grade compared\nwith a control group and an experimental group.\nMotor competence can be defined as an individual's level\nof performance when executing different motor acts (Burton\nSigmundsson & Haga, 2016), and the term encompasses\nboth fine and gross motor skills/activities. When measuring\nmotor competence, typical aspects in focus are balance/pos-\ntural control, speed, sureness, and accuracy of movement\ncoordination. Compared with the health-related components\nfound in physical fitness, test items on motor competence\ntests demand little muscular strength or endurance, and aero-\nbic performance (Fj\u00f8rtoft, Pedersen, Sigmundsson, &\nto influence several aspects in a child's development, includ-\ning psychosocial factors (e.g., self-esteem; Vedul-Kjes\u00e5s,\nSigmundsson, Stensdotter, & Haga, 2012), probability of\nparticipation in a physical activity (Holfelder & Schott,\n2014), overall performance on different fitness components\nweight and obesity (D'Hondt et al., 2013; Hendrix, Prins, &\nDekkers, 2014). More recently, motor competence has been\nstudied in relation to cognitive function and academic per-\nformance in children. Haapala et al. (2015) highlighted how\ndifferent measures of motor performance are not equally\nlinked to cognition in children, because better cognition\n(measured by Raven Colored Progressive Matrices) was sig-\nnificantly associated with better overall motor performance\n(calculated as the sum of shuttle run, balance, and manual\ndexterity) and better performance in the shuttle run test and\nbalance test (modified flamingo balance test), but not with\nstanding long jump, 15-m sprint, and manual dexterity in the\nentire sample. Similar findings were also reported by Haapala\net al. (2014), because children with a lower performance,\nthat is, results in the lowest third, in overall motor perfor-\nmance, shuttle run, and manual dexterity in Grade 1 had sig-\nnificantly worse reading fluency and arithmetic skills\ncompared with children with higher performance in motor\ncompetence, while no such association was found between\nbalance and academic performance.\nIntervention studies that investigated the effects of motor\nskills and physical activity (measured by Motor Skills\nDevelopment as Ground for Learning (MUGI) that specially\nfocused on balance and coordination) on school performance\nfor a period of 9 years revealed better marks (Swedish,\nEnglish, and mathematics) in the intervention group than the\ncontrol group (p < .05), and a larger proportion from the\nintervention group qualified for upper secondary school.\nHowever, both these associations were found for boys but\nnot for girls (Ericsson & Karlsson, 2012). Results also indi-\ncate that participating in an exercise program focusing on\nbimanual coordination activities can contribute to improved\nreading comprehension (p < .05), but not decoding (p > .05;\nmeasured using the Gates-MacGinitie Reading Test) in chil-\nAlthough the evidence is still vague and insufficient, there\nmight be some indications of a reduction in the strength of\nthe association between motor skills and cognitive skills in\npubertal children (greater than 13 years of age) compared\nwith prepubertal children, and that this might be explained\nby a more separate development in these two domains as\nthey get older (Van der Fels et al., 2014).\nThus, exploring the relative contribution of the different\ncomponents included in these two different constructs (e.g.,\naerobic and muscular fitness and manual dexterity, hand\u00adeye\ncoordination, and balance) on cognitive skills could there-\nfore contribute to a more comprehensive picture of the pos-\nsible mechanisms (Castelli et al., 2007). A longitudinal\ndesign could also provide a better understanding of these\npossible processes during development (Hillman et al., 2017;\nHillman et al., 2008). The purpose of this study was therefore\nto explore the possible associations of physical fitness and\nmotor competence with reading skills in children aged 9 and\nMethod\nStudy Design and Participants\nSixty-seven school children aged 9 to 10 years (the total popu-\nlation in that age group in the school selected) completed\nassessments of motor competence (Movement Assessment\nBattery for Children [MABC]; Henderson & Sugden, 1992),\nphysical fitness (Test of Physical Fitness [TPF]; Fj\u00f8rtoft,\nPedersen, Sigmundsson, & Vereijken, 2011), and reading\n(Word Recognition Test [WCT]; H\u00f8ien & T\u00f8nnesen, 1997).\nThe entire sample (N = 67, 31 girls and 36 boys) was obtained\nfrom a local mainstream primary school in an urban area. The\nsample included children from a wide range of socioeconomic\nbackgrounds and reflected the population of children attending\nschools in this area. The mean chronological age for the entire\ngroup was 9.7 (SD = 0.3) years; the overall range was 9.3 to\n10.2 years. No participant had any behavioral or medical con-\ndition that would qualify as an exclusion criterion for this study.\nThe testing procedures were repeated for the entire sam-\nple after 32 months. From the initial sample, data from 9\nchildren were missing. The mean age was 12.1 years (SD =\n0.2) for the whole group (N = 58) at the second sampling, and\nthe group consisted of 28 girls and 30 boys.\nMeasurements\nReading.Reading was tested using the Wordchain Test\n(WCT) in Norwegian, the ordkjeder (Wordchains; H\u00f8ien &\nT\u00f8nnesen, 1997). In the WCT, the participants were given a\nbooklet containing rows presented in the form of 90 chains\nsimilar to the following:\nPeghousefishone sandcoffeebluehome lambglassbootcat\nmudswanbrightrocket\nSubjects were given 4 min in which to divide as many\nchains as possible into their component words by drawing a\n4 SAGE Open\nline where the gap should be. Both speed and accuracy of\nword recognition is measured (Miller-Guron & Lundberg,\n2000). Higher scores on WCT indicate better performance.\nThe WCT measures speed and accuracy of word recognition,\nand has proved to be a reliable and valid test to assess iso-\nlated word decoding proficiency (Jacobson, 1993; Miller-\nPhysical fitness. The TPF is a measure that aims to provide\nreliable and objective quantification of children's physical\ndifferent test items: three items based on jumping, two on\nthrowing, one on climbing, and three on running.

The MABC\nis an extended version of Test of Motor Impairment (TOMI;\nStott, Moyes, & Henderson, 1984). The MABC provides a\nglobal test of motor competence and is designed for children\nin the 4- to 12-year age group. The test is standardized and\nrequires the participant to perform a motor task in a specified\nway. The test provides a quantitative evaluation of the child's\nor adolescent's motor competence. Each age group is tested\non eight items in three subcategories: manual dexterity, ball\nskills, and static and dynamic balance. The test contains dif-\nferent tasks for different ages. A child's performance is ref-\nerenced to a standardized sample value from individuals of\nsame age. Lower MABC scores indicate better motor com-\npetence. The MABC has a minimum test\u00adretest reliability at\nany age of 0.75 and an interrater reliability of 0.70 (Hender-\nProcedure\nAll participants and parents provided informed consent before\nparticipation in the study, and all procedures were performed\nin accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The partici-\npants were tested using the MABC and WCT on the same day,\nand then using the TPF 1 week later. The assessment of motor\nperformance took place in a quiet room during normal school\nhours. The assessment of physical fitness took place in a sport\nhall. All participants were tested individually by assistants\nwho had been trained in the test protocols. Each test item was\nexplained and demonstrated to the participant before testing.\nDuring the testing, participants were given verbal encourage-\nment and support. If the participants made a procedural error,\ninstructions and demonstrations were repeated and the partici-\npant made a new attempt. The participant wore clothing and\ntrainers suitable for physical activity during both tests.\nData Reduction and Analysis\nFor the statistical analysis, SPSS Version 19 for Windows\nwas used (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). A total TPF score\nwas calculated by transforming test item scores into stan-\ndardized scores (z scores) using the overall sample mean.\nHigher z scores indicate higher performance on the tasks.\nThe total test score for each child was calculated as the aver-\nage z score. Pearson product\u00admoment correlation was used\nto investigate the possible associations between the MABC,\nTPF, and WCT.

The results are shown in Table 1. Higher scores on the\nTPF and WCT indicate better performance (better physical\nfitness and reading skills), while lower scores on MABC\nindicate better motor competence. Table 1 shows the perfor-\nmance on all test items using the TPF test and the WCT, and\nresults improved from 9 years of age to 12 years of age. It is\ndifficult to determine the changes in the MABC because the\ntest items at age 9 years are different than those used at age\n12 years (the test battery contains of different tasks in the age\nThe correlation (Pearson's, two-tailed) between total\nMABC, TPF, and WCT scores for the 9- and 12-year-old chil-\ndren are presented in Table 2.

For boys, there was a positive\ncorrelation, indicating that higher motor competence is related\nto lower reading performance (lower WCT score), or the\nreverse. The correlation between physical fitness and reading\nskills for the entire group was also low (r = .064). However,\nthere was a significant correlation between physical fitness\nand low (r = -.138).

The correlation\nis negative for the entire group (9 and 12 years) and for girls,\nbut positive for the boys at 9 and 12 years (i.e., better perfor-\nmance in MABC correlates with a lower performance on the\nWCT or vice versa). These results are partly supported by\nearlier findings that showed no strong association between\nmotor competence and academic achievement (Haapala\nness and academic performance (Haapala et al., 2015;\nKantomaa et al., 2013; Resaland, Aadland, Moe, Aadland, &\nSkrede, 2016). It is challenging, however, to compare across\nstudies because of the diverse measurement used to assess\nthe different variables.\nIn the 1960s, there were attempts to explore and explain\nhow perceptual-motor functioning could increase educa-\ntional effectiveness, and perceptual-motor training was a pri-\nmary intervention method in special education (Kephart,\n2004). Behind such a hypothesis, there was an assumption\nabout the existence of underlying general abilities in both the\nmotor and cognitive domains, and that they shared common\nunderlying processes. However, a meta-analysis concluded\nthat interventions based on perceptual-motor training were\nnot effective for the improvement of academic or cognitive\nvariables (Kavale & Mattson, 1983). More recently, similar\nfindings have emerged in intervention studies that showed no\neffect of increased physical activity on academic perfor-\nmance in numeracy, reading, and English (Resaland et al.,\n2016). Empirical evidence to support the construct of such\ngeneral abilities is also lacking; for example, correlation\nbetween the eight test items and also within each of the\nMABC subgroups (manual dexterity, balance, and ball skills)\nis low (Haga, Pedersen, & Sigmundsson, 2008). In addition,\nvery low correlations are reported between six test items of\nstatic and dynamic balance (Drowatsky & Zuccato, 1967) as\nwell as between three fine motor tasks in adults (Lor\u00e5s &\nSigmundsson, 2012). For cognitive skills, intercorrelations\nbetween mathematics tasks are found to be relatively low-to-\nmoderate, indicating that the nine test items shared less than\nTherefore, because of the low correlations within separate\ndomains (i.e., the motor and cognitive domains), the low cor-\nrelation between skills in different domains (motor compe-\ntence and reading) is not surprising.\nExcept for a significant and moderate correlation between\nphysical fitness and reading in 9-year-old girls (r = .404;\n17.7% shared variance), no significant associations between\nfitness and reading skills where found in either age group.\nThese results are in accordance with the relatively low rela-\ntionships between motor competence and reading, and may\nconfirm the lack of spillover from the physical modality to\nthe cognitive modality. There is no consensus about this\nassociation in children, but the associations between physical\nfitness and cognitive skills seems to be stronger when com-\nparing children with high and low fitness levels, with the lat-\nter having worse academic or cognitive achievement\nScudder et al., 2014). Thus, a possible association could be\nexaggerated by comparing groups at the extremes of the\ndistribution.\nThe significant differences between girls and boys in the\n9-year-old age group (see Table 2) and the significant corre-\nlation between fitness and reading in girls may be explained\nby earlier maturation of the neural network that is more\nimportant for executive function in girls than in boys (Giedd,\nRaznahan, Mills, & Lenroot, 2012). However, this associa-\ntion is not found when the children are 12 years old. This\ncould be linked to the suggestion by Hillmann et al. (2017)\nthat variability is a hallmark of cognitive performance\nbecause both maturation and experience influence structure\nand function.\nPhysical activity and fitness are reported to have effects\non executive functions (Davis et al., 2011; Kamijo et al.,\n2011) and they may provide some benefits for learning.\nHowever, research indicates that to develop skills such as\nreading, specific training is needed. Dehaene et al. (2010)\nsuggested that learning to read means reorganizing neural\ncircuits in the brain; the changes that reading makes to our\nbrain result mainly from the effect of our experience with\nreading. These findings can be used as an argument for task\nspecificity principles of learning across cognitive and motor\nskills, because the processes associated with learning may\nseem relatively independent and specific (Hadders-Algra,\nduction, coordination and motor skill learning taps into the\nneurophysiological motor system, which is characterized by\nits plasticity (Kleim & Jones, 2008). A perspective that has\nbeen translated into the domain of human motor behavior is\nthe \"neuronal group selection theory\" (NGST; Blauw-\nHospers, Dirks, Hulshof, Bos, & Hadders-Algra, 2011;\nSmith, 1994). Within this theory, experience and stimuli\nserve as the basis for motor development and learning,\nemphasizing that development is a process of selection\nwithin the central nervous system. This means that behav-\nioral experience increases connections within specific areas\nof the brain and strengthens the neural network involved in\nthe generation of successful movement. Under this perspec-\ntive, the gradual learning and performance of an efficient\nSigmundsson et al. 7\nmovement solution for a given task is experience-dependent,\nbecause it builds on self-produced instances of trial and error\n1994). Training/executing specific tasks will reinforce the\nneural networks that are involved in a particular task, thus\nmaking this behavior more plausible to be performed the\nnext time (Sporns & Edelman, 1993). NGST may support the\ntask-specificity hypothesis of learning (Edelman, 1987,\n1992) and the low association of motor competence and\nphysical fitness with reading in this study can be generally\ninterpreted as support for specificity in learning skills.\nA challenge in this field is also how the different con-\nstructs are conceptualized and measured (Donnelly et al.,\n2016). It is difficult to obtain a pure measure of the basic\ncomponents of physical fitness in children. Even in test and\nlaboratory settings, only an indirect indication of the differ-\nent basic components is likely. Because physical fitness is\nmeasured by performing movements, elements of motor\nFj\u00f8rtoft et al. (2011) suggested that the constituent compo-\nnents of a skill are not known, nor is it known how they com-\nbine to make up the complex skill, making it hard to find an\nisolated measure of the basic components. Movement tests\ndo not always discriminate well between motor competence\nand physical fitness (Vandendriessche et al., 2011), and\ntherefore, finding the independent contributions of each phe-\nnomenon to the outcomes of interest is impeded. Thus, the\nassociation between these variables and cognitive function\nmay depend on the specific content of the specific fitness test\nand the tasks used to measure motor competence.\nStronger associations are found between cardiovascular\nfitness and academic achievement when field-based running\ntest were used as a measure compared with ergometer cycle\ntests (Haapala et al., 2015). Haapala also suggests that, in\nchildren, motor competence may have a greater effect on\nexecutions of such fitness tasks, as the running technique is\nnot as well developed; this suggests that motor performance\nis more important for academic achievement compared with\ncardiovascular fitness.\nIt is also unclear whether fitness is related to better perfor-\nmance in cognitive outcomes because of indirect factors,\nsuch as motivation and attention to tasks, or if fitness has a\nmore direct effect on specific subprocesses related to reading\n(Scudder et al., 2014). It might be that physical fitness is\nmore related to executive functions (Tomporowski, Davis,\ncan be regarded as premises for the learning process and aca-\nThis study has some limitations. First, the statistical power\nof the relative small sample must be taken into account.\nSecond, possible sex differences are not sufficiently discussed\nin this article. Furthermore, the data are not adjusted for socio-\neconomic status, which is an important confounder that could\nboth predict academic performance and moderate the associa-\ntion between physical fitness and academic skills.\nConclusion\nDifferent types of physical activity may have the potential to\nenhance the metabolic mechanism and improve executive\nfunction and academic performance. A challenge to target is\nhow to conceptualize and measure the different constructs\nincluded in motor competence and physical fitness. However,\nto learn and improve academic skills, it is possible that prac-\ntice should be specific to the particular cognitive skill that is\nbeing performed. The results from this study may support the\nprinciple of specificity in learning, because the results for\nboys (9 and 12 years old) and girls (12 years old) in this\nstudy showed very low associations of physical fitness and\nmotor competence with reading skills.
