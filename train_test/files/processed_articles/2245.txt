Data col-\nlection and procedural details have been published else-\nincluded a nationally representative sample of 12 642 stu-\nThe sample was selected using a 3-stage stratified clustered sam-\npling procedure, with school districts as the primary sampling\nunit. The survey was administered in classrooms by indepen-\ndent research staff. Black/African American and Hispanic stu-\ndents were oversampled to produce reliable estimates for these\nstudents. Questions were validated in several countries in tar-\nget age groups. Youth assent and active or passive parental con-\nsent were obtained as required by participating school dis-\ntricts. The institutional review board of the Eunice Kennedy\nShriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Devel-\nopment approved study procedures.\nVARIABLES\nTelevision viewing time was assessed by asking (separately for\nweekdays and weekends), \"About how many hours a day do\nyou usually watch television (including videos and DVDs) in\nyour free time?\". Response categories included \"none at all,\"\n\"about half an hour a day,\" \"about 1 hour a day,\" \"about 2 hours\na day,\" and so on to \"about 7 or more hours a day.\" Similar\nquestions and identical responses were used to assess com-\nputer use. The survey asked (separately for weekdays and week-\nends), \"About how many hours a day do you usually play games\non a computer or games console (PlayStation, Xbox, Game-\nCube, etc) in your free time?\" and \"About how many hours a\nday do you usually use a computer for chatting online, Inter-\nnet, e-mailing, homework, etc, in your free time?\". Weekday\nand weekend responses were combined to obtain average daily\nhours of TVV and computer use. The combined variable for\ncomputer use for games and other purposes was used in final\nanalyses because of the lack of an independent contribution of\nseparate computer use variables in regression models.\nEating behaviors were assessed by asking, \"How many times\na week do you usually eat or drink . . . \" followed by \"fruits,\"\n\"vegetables,\" \"sweets (candy or chocolate),\" and \"Coke or other\nsoft drinks that contain sugar\" (soda), with response options\nfor \"never,\" \"less than once a week,\" \"once a week,\" \"2 to 4\ndays a week,\" \"5 to 6 days a week,\" \"once a day, every day,\"\nand \"every day, more than once.\" Skipping breakfast was as-\nsessed by asking (separately for weekdays and weekends), \"How\noften do you usually have breakfast (more than a glass of milk\nor fruit juice)?\". Weekday response options included \"I never\nhave breakfast during weekdays,\" \"1 day,\" \"2 days,\" \"3 days,\"\n\"4 days,\" or \"5 days.\" Weekend response options included \"I\nnever have breakfast during the weekend,\" \"I usually have break-\nfast on only 1 day of the weekend (Saturday OR Sunday),\" and\n\"I usually have breakfast on both weekend days (Saturday AND\nSunday).\" Weekday and weekend responses were combined to\ncreate a single variable indicating whether breakfast was skipped\nat least 1 day per week. Eating at a fast food restaurant was as-\nsessed by asking, \"How often do you eat in a fast food restau-\nrant (for example, McDonald's, KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell)?,\"\nwith response options for \"never,\" \"rarely (less than once a\nmonth),\" \"once a month,\" \"2 to 3 times a month,\" \"once a week,\"\n\"2 to 4 days a week,\" and \"5 or more days a week.\"\nSnacking during TVV and computer use were assessed in\nparticipants in grades 7 through 10 by asking, \"How often do\nyou eat a snack while you . . . \" followed by \"watch TV (in-\ncluding videos and DVDs)\" and \"work or play on a computer\nor games console,\" with response options for \"never,\" \"less than\nonce a week,\" \"1 to 2 days a week,\" \"3 to 4 days a week,\" \"5 to\n6 days a week,\" and \"every day.\" Leisure-time vigorous physi-\ncal activity was assessed by asking, \"Outside school hours: how\nmany hours a week do you usually exercise in your free time\nso much that you get out of breath or sweat?,\" with responses\nfor \"none,\" \"about half an hour,\" \"about 1 hour,\" \"about 2 to\n3 hours,\" \"about 4 to 6 hours,\" and \"7 hours or more.\"\nStudents reported age, sex, race (\"What do you consider your\nrace to be?,\" with response options for \"black or African Ameri-\ncan\" [hereafter referred to as black], \"white,\" \"Asian,\" \"Ameri-\ncan Indian or Alaska native,\" \"Native Hawaiian or other Pa-\ncific Islander,\" and \"other\" with a blank space provided), and\nethnicity (\"What do you consider your ethnicity to be?,\" with\nresponse options for \"Hispanic or Latino\" and \"not Hispanic\nor Latino\"). We combined responses to create a 4-category race/\nethnicity variable: non-Hispanic white (white), non-Hispanic\nblack/African American (black/African American), Hispanic, and\nother. Socioeconomic status was assessed by the Family Afflu-\nence Scale, a measure with demonstrated content and external\nvalidity44 that was developed for the Health Behaviour in School-\naged Children Study on the basis of responses to questions about\ncomputer and automobile ownership, whether the student shares\na bedroom, and frequency of family vacations.\nDescriptive statistics were calculated and compared by sex, age,\nand race/ethnicity using regression analysis for continuous out-\ncomes and the Pearson/Wald test for binary outcomes. Mul-\ntiple logistic regressions assessed relationships between TVV\n(hours per day) and daily intake of fruit, vegetables, sweets,\nand soda, as well as skipping breakfast at least 1 day per week\nand eating at a fast food restaurant at least 1 day per week. We\nexamined interactions of TVV with age, sex, and race/ethnicity\nwithmultiplicativeinteractiontermsandstratifiedanalyseswhere\nwarranted. Relationships between TVV and dietary behaviors\nafter controlling for frequency of TV and computer snacking\nwere explored in grades 7 through 10; we further examined the\ninteraction of TVV and TV snacking in this subpopulation. All\nindependent variables were continuous except sex and race/\nethnicity. Analyses accounted for the complex survey sam-\npling design using STATA, version 11 (StataCorp).\nRESULTS\nThere were significant sociodemographic differences in\nmost eating behaviors except fast food, which was not\ndifferent by sex but was more frequent for older (aged\n13 years) vs younger (13 years) participants and for\nracial/ethnicgroupscomparedwithwhiteyouth(P.001)\n\u00a92012 American Medical Association.

Odds of daily intake of fruit\nand vegetables were higher for younger than older par-\nticipants, for girls compared with boys, and for white and\nother groups compared with black and Hispanic youth.\nOdds of daily intake of sweets were highest for older vs\nyounger youth, for girls vs boys, and for black youth com-\npared with other racial/ethnic groups. Odds of drinking\nsoda at least daily were highest for older vs younger youth,\nfor boys vs girls, and for black and Hispanic youth com-\npared with other racial/ethnic groups. Skipping break-\nfast was more common for older than younger partici-\npants, for girls vs boys, and for black, Hispanic, and\n\"other\" youth vs white participants.\nTelevision viewing did not differ by age group but was\nlowerforgirlsthanboys(approximately0.1h/d)andhigher\nfor black participants vs other racial/ethnic groups (ap-\nproximately1.0-1.4 h/d). Computer use was lower for\nyoungervsolderparticipants,forgirlsvsboys,andforwhite\nvs other racial/ethnic groups. Television snacking did not\ndiffer by sex or age but was more frequent for black youth\nvs other racial/ethnic groups. Computer snacking was less\nfrequent for girls than boys (approximately0.25 d/wk) and\nmore frequent for black participants vs other ethnic/\nracial groups (approximately0.8-1.2 d/wk). Leisure-time\nvigorous physical activity was lower for girls vs boys (ap-\nproximately0.4 h/wk) and higher for white participants\nvsotherracial/ethnicgroups(approximately0.2-0.4h/wk).\nTelevision viewing time was inversely related to fruit\nand vegetable intake and positively related to sweets and\nsoda intake, fast food intake, and skipping breakfast in\nmodels adjusted for computer use, physical activity, age,\nsex, family affluence, and race/ethnicity (Table 3). Re-\nlationships differed by age and race/ethnicity (Figure);\nwe did not find differences by sex. Relationships with soda\n(Figure, A) and fast food (Figure, B) intake and with skip-\nping breakfast (Figure, C) differed according to race/\nethnicity, whereas relationships with skipping break-\nfast differed as well by age (Figure, C). There was a positive\nrelationship of TVV with soda intake for all race/\nethnicities, although the relationship was weaker for black\nvision viewing time was positively related to fast food in\ntionship with fast food was not significant for black youth.\nSkipping breakfast was not related to TVV in youth aged\n13, there was a positive relationship between TVV and\nskipping breakfast in white youth (adjusted odds ratio,\nblack youth and no significant relationship in Hispanic\nlar between white and other participants.\nTelevision viewing time and TV snacking were inde-\npendently related to eating behaviors in participants in\ngrades 7 through 10 in adjusted models (Table 4).

The relation-\nship of TVV with this unhealthy combination of eating\nbehaviors may contribute to the documented relation-\nship of TVV with cardiometabolic risk factors.4,45,46\nMany of our prevalence estimates vary somewhat from\npreviously reported findings, likely because of differ-\nences in assessment methods. Our estimates of TVV (2.4\nh/d) and computer use (2.8 h/d) are similar to and more\nthan an hour greater, respectively, than previous esti-\nmates.38,47 Reported vigorous physical activity in our\nsample is substantially lower than previous estimates of\nskipping breakfast in our sample (54.8%1 d/wk) was\nhigher than a recent National Health and Nutrition Ex-\namination Survey estimate (20%).50 In addition, our es-\ntimate of frequency of eating at a fast food restaurant is\nlower than findings of a study of California adolescents,\nin which 46% reported eating fast food at least 2 times\nper week51 and recent estimates from a nationally rep-\nresentative sample reporting a mean 2 to 3 fast food meals\nper week,52,53 although multiple fast food meals may be\nconsumed on a single day.\nRelationships of TVV with soda intake, fast food, and\nbreakfast behaviors differed according to race/ethnicity.\nThe relationship with soda intake was attenuated for black\nparticipants compared with white participants, al-\nthough relationships were positive for all groups. In ad-\ndition, the relationship of TVV with fast food was not sig-\nnificant for black youth, whereas this relationship was\npositive in other racial/ethnic groups.

These findings are poten-\ntially explained by a relationship of TVV with sleep du-\nration and morning sleepiness in youth that may vary with\nrespect to factors associated with child age and race/\nethnicity.54 Our results indicated that relationships of TVV\nand intake of fruit and vegetables did not differ accord-\ning to race/ethnicity, contrary to findings of a previous\nstudy using data from the 1999 national Youth Risk Be-\nhavior Survey.42 In addition, relationships were not dif-\nferent according to sex, as has been suggested in previ-\nous research.6,41 Likely because of the heterogeneous\nmake-up of the \"other\" subgroup, we found few differ-\nences from white participants, apart from overall lower\nodds of drinking soda daily and higher odds of skipping\nbreakfast. Differential associations by race/ethnicity sug-\ngest the importance of social, cultural, or other contex-\ntual factors42,55 that may contribute to variability in as-\nsociations of TVV with eating behaviors. However, despite\ndifferential associations by sociodemographic factors, our\nfindings of associations of TVV and eating behaviors across\nall races/ethnicities were nearly universally inconsistent\nwith healthful eating patterns.\nOur results demonstrated relationships of TV snack-\ning with several eating behaviors after adjustment for TVV,\ncomputer use, physical activity, computer snacking, and\nsociodemographic characteristics. Although a measure\nof overall snacking frequency was not available, our find-\ning of independent relationships of eating behaviors with\nboth TV and computer snacking suggest that these mea-\nsures represent specific modes of snacking rather than\nserving as proxies for overall snacking. Results indicat-\ning positive relationships of TV snacking with candy and\nsoda intake and with eating at a fast food restaurant sup-\nport previous research documenting adverse associa-\ntions of eating while watching TV and nutritional qual-\nresearch has also demonstrated a positive association of\neating while watching TV on food quantity consumed in\nundergraduates29 and children.36 This evidence sug-\ngests TV snacking may influence the amount and qual-\nity of food consumed.\nRelationships of TVV with eating behaviors were es-\nsentially unchanged after adjustment for TV snacking,\nand we found no evidence of effect modification be-\ntween TVV and TV snacking, suggesting that TV snack-\ning does not fully account for relationships between TVV\nand eating behaviors. This evidence, together with our\nfinding that TVV was strongly and positively related to\nthe intake of highly advertised foods and either weakly\nrelated or unrelated to rarely advertised foods, supports\na hypothesized influence of TV food advertisement ex-\nposure on dietary intake consistent with experimental re-\nsearch.58,59 Although data indicate a recent decrease in\nadolescents' exposure to candy and soda advertise-\nments, exposure to fast food restaurant advertisements\nhas increased.60 In addition, the nutritional quality of ad-\nnatively, these findings may reflect a clustering of\nunhealthy behaviors related to unobserved factors, such\nas an increased tendency to snack during essentially un-\noccupied time or preferential selection of foods condu-\ncive to snacking. Associations of TVV and TV snacking\nwith eating behaviors were evident after adjustment for\nseveralcovariatesintendedtoreduceconfoundingbychar-\nacteristics such as general preference for health and re-\nlated behaviors, although the potential for residual bias\npersists in observational research.\nInterpretation of these findings must take into ac-\ncount the relative strengths and weaknesses of this study.\nOur findings rely on a brief assessment of dietary intake\nrather than a more detailed method (eg, food frequency\nquestionnaire or dietary recall), which may have hin-\ndered our ability to detect significant relationships. An\nimportant limitation is the cross-sectional study design,\nwhich does not allow for determination of causality be-\ncause of the inability to establish temporality and the po-\ntential for confounding by unobserved factors. Thus, we\ncannot rule out, for example, the possibility that youth\nwith poor dietary behaviors, including a greater ten-\ndency toward snacking, are more likely to watch TV. How-\never, previous interventions to reduce TVV in children\nand adolescents have shown evidence of a beneficial in-\nfluence on eating while watching TV65,66 as well as on total\nporting a causal role of TVV on dietary intake. In addi-\ntion, the internal validity of our findings is strength-\nened by our adjustment for several behavioral and\nsocioeconomicconfounders.Ourstudyisfurtherstrength-\nened by the high participation rate and the use of a rep-\nresentative sample of US adolescents, including over-\nsampling of black and Hispanic youth to enable subgroup\nanalysis.\nThese findings show that TVV is related to a cluster\nof unhealthy eating behaviors in US adolescents after con-\ntrolling for TV snacking, computer snacking, socioeco-\nnomic variables, computer use, and physical activity. Re-\nlationships of TVV with eating behaviors were modified\nby age and race/ethnicity, suggesting the importance of\ncultural or social factors. Future research should eluci-\ndate the independent contributions of TVV, food adver-\ntising, and TV snacking on dietary intake in this popu-\nlation. If these relationships are causal, efforts to reduce\nTVV or to modify the nutritional content of advertised\nfoods may lead to substantial improvements in adoles-\ncents' dietary intake.\nCorrespondence: Leah M.
