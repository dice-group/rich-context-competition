Participants were drawn from a population-based longitudinal study, and they completed\nthe Adelaide Activities Profile and a battery of tests measuring cognition and sensory functioning. Hierarchical\nregression analyses revealed that, after sensory functioning was controlled for, activity was a significant predictor\nof current levels of speed, picture naming, incidental recall, and verbal fluency, and of cognitive change in speed,\npicture naming, and incidental recall. Commonality analyses demonstrated that activity accounted for a notable\namount of the total variance in cognition, and that there was prominent overlap in shared variance between\nactivity and age, and between sensory functioning and age. These findings suggest that engaging in general\nlifestyle activities may help to promote successful cognitive aging.\nTHE cognitive reserve hypothesis suggests that there is\na developmental plasticity with regard to cognition,\nwhereby the cognitive functioning of older adults can be altered\nwithin a limited range by environmental factors (Baltes, Reese,\nfactor that has received a large amount of research interest is an\nengaged lifestyle. It has been proposed that older adults who\nlead a more active lifestyle can promote their cognitive\nfunctioning within the limits of their reserve capacity (Scarmeas\nThe majority of research in this area has focused on the effect\nthat engaging in physical, mental, or social activity has on the\ncognitive functioning of older adults. Physical activity, as\nmeasured by exercise participation or physiologically by aerobic\ncapacity, has been shown to benefit the cognitive functioning of\nolder adults (Pignatti, Rozzini & Trabucchi, 2002; Schuit,\nFeskens, Launer, & Kromhout, 2001). Leading a cognitively\nintense lifestyle, such as work or leisure time spent reading or\nplaying bridge, has also been shown as a good predictor of\ncognitive functioning in old age (Pushkar Gold et al., 1995;\nSchooler & Mulatu, 2001). Similarly, occupational cognitive\ncomplexity has been shown to influence the intellectual\nfunctioning of older workers (Schooler, Mulatu, & Oates,\n1999). In addition, social activity in the form of increased social\nnetworks and emotional support, as measured by the amount of\ntime engaged in social situations, has also been linked to higher\ncognitive functioning (Seeman, Lusignolo, Albert, & Berkman,\n2001). Further studies that have examined the combined effect\nof physical, mental, and social activities, using self-reports and\ninformant reports of how often specific activities are engaged in,\nhave also demonstrated that declines in activity with increasing\nage are reflected in declines in cognition in both a cross-\nsectional and longitudinal context (Christensen et al., 1996;\nChristensen & Mackinnon, 1993; Mackinnon, Christensen,\nHofer, Korten, & Jorm, 2003). These findings are further\nsupported by experimental research demonstrating that changes\nin activity level are directly related to changes in cognitive\nfunctioning in older adults, as has been demonstrated for\ncognitive activity (Willis & Schaie, 1986) and physical activity\nAlthough the precise mechanisms of the relationships\nbetween an engaged lifestyle and successful cognitive aging\nare not clear, it has been suggested that physical activity may\nbenefit the cognitive functioning of older adults by improving\ncerebral blood flow (Hall, Smith, & Keele, 2001). The cognitive\nbenefit derived in older age from a cognitively and socially\nintense lifestyle is commonly explained within Schooler's\n(1989) environmental complexity hypothesis. This suggests that\nthe enriched environment and cognitive complexity provided by\na cognitively or socially intense lifestyle can create more\ndendritic branches and synaptic connections in the brain, as has\nbeen shown for animals (Greenough, McDonald, Parnisari,\nThe direction of the causal relationship between activity\nengagement and cognitive functioning in older adults was\nrecently debated by Hultsch, Hertzog, Small, and Dixon (1999),\nPushkar and colleagues (1999), and Hertzog, Hultsch, and\nDixon (1999). These researchers examined whether the re-\nlationship between activity and intellectual functioning may be\nbetter viewed in terms of how intellectual functioning influences\nactivity engagement. However, subsequent longitudinal re-\nsearch suggests a reciprocal relationship between activity and\nintellectual functioning, whereby cognitive functioning pro-\nmotes activity engagement and activity engagement simulta-\nneously enhances cognitive functioning (Schooler et al., 1999;\nCurrently research within this field is tempered by in-\nconsistent findings in the literature. Although many researchers\nhave provided support for the engagement hypothesis, many\nothers have failed to detect a relationship between activity and\ncognitive functioning in older adults. For example, Aartsen,\nSmits, Tilburg, Knipscheer, and Deeg (2002) examined the\neffect of the amount of self-reported engagement in social, ex-\nperiential, and developmental activities on immediate recall,\nJournal of Gerontology: PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCES Copyright 2005 by The Gerontological Society of America\nfluid intelligence, information processing, and scoring on the\nMini-Mental State Examination, but they failed to detect\na relationship. Similarly, Albert and colleagues (1995) found\nno relation between strenuous physical activity and cognitive\nfunctioning in a large sample of African Americans. It is\nplausible that a contributing factor to these inconsistent findings\nis the lack of a specific definition of what an active lifestyle is.\nTypically, an active lifestyle has been measured by informant\nratings of activity engagement, physiological measures of cardio-\nrespiratory fitness, or self-reported amount of engagement in\nspecific types of activities (which is sometimes a factor of the\namount of effort required in these activities and can be measured\neither currently or asked retrospectively in either a scale or time\nof participation format). This makes it difficult to compare the\nresults of different research studies. Furthermore, vital activities\nthat influence cognition may be overlooked. Researchers com-\nmonly assess activity levels by examining how often older\nadults engage in a restricted range of specific cognitive, phys-\nical, or social activities, thus providing an indication of how\nspecific activities influence cognition. For instance, Mackinnon\nand associates (2003) examined six activities including reading\na newspaper, engaging in physical activity, being involved in\ninterests or hobbies, spending time sitting around without doing\nvery much, spending time in planned activities, and having\na daily nap. Measuring a restricted range of activities may under-\nestimate the potential influence of activity because it creates\nsmall interindividual variation and may overlook many activities\nthat older adults engage in. This is particularly important in the\ncurrent society, in which a vast amount of everyday activities,\nbeyond traditional reading and writing, are available to older\nadults, such as paid and volunteer work.\nAnother important issue is the use of both cross-sectional and\nlongitudinal research designs. Longitudinal research is useful\nfor examining how activity influences cognitive performance\nover time; however, because of financial and time constraints,\nmany studies in the cognitive aging field utilize a cross-sectional\nmethodology. The extent to which these two research designs\ndifferentially influence findings is not yet clear. Therefore,\ncomparisons between cross-sectional and longitudinal findings\ncould usefully clarify the utility of these designs.\nA further issue is whether confounding variables are\ncontrolled for. In research, it is common for education and\nsocioeconomic status to be statistically controlled for, with the\nrationale that these are factors known to influence cognition.\nHowever, a key mediator that is often disregarded is sensory\nfunctioning. Age-related changes in sensory functioning are\nthought to indicate age-based changes in the central nervous\nsystem, which are reflected in biological markers of aging such\nas vision and hearing. This is also known as the common-cause\nhypothesis (Baltes & Lindenberger, 1997; Hofer, Berg & Era,\n2003). Changes in sensory functioning are particularly impor-\ntant in this field of research, as they influence both the capacity\nto engage in activities by limiting functional capacity to perform\nactivities, and the cognitive functioning of older adults (Anstey\nIn the current study we sought to further examine the\nrelationship between an engaged lifestyle and the cognitive\nfunctioning of older adults by addressing some of the\naforementioned issues. First, we examined the effect of an\nengaged lifestyle on cognitive aging in terms of a generally\nactive lifestyle, rather than the effect of separate and specific\nphysical, mental, or social activities. The definition of\na generally active lifestyle that we use here covers activities\nthat many older adults have been demonstrated to regularly\nengage in, and it encompasses activities that are based in the\nphysical, social, and mental domains. Using this broader\ndefinition of a generally active lifestyle means that findings\nfrom this research will be directly relevant to a broad range of\nolder adults rather than an exclusive subset. It also allows for an\nexamination of how engaging in a broad range of relatively\nsimple activities integral to daily functioning can influence\ncognitive aging. Using a broader measure of activity, which\nencompasses measures of routine events such as shopping,\ndoing housework, and caring for sick friends or relatives, as well\nas traditionally measured activities such as participating in\nvolunteer work and going on outings, provides a more accurate\nreflection of the daily activity level of older adults. We used the\nAdelaide Activities Profile (AAP; Clark & Bond, 1995) as an\nindex of general lifestyle activities. The AAP is valuable in\nexamining the link between an active lifestyle and cognitive\nperformance, because it is specifically designed to measure the\ntype of activities engaged in by older adults and has been dem-\nonstrated to be reliable and valid for the measurement of activity\nlevel in community-dwelling older adults (Clark & Bond).\nSecond, in this study we examined the effect of a generally\nactive lifestyle on both current cognitive functioning (cross-\nsectional) and on cognitive change over a 6-year interval (longi-\ntudinal). This allows for a comparison of the effect of current\nactivity level on current cognitive functioning, and the effect of\nprevious activity level on cognitive change over a 6-year interval.\nThird, we examined the relationship between general activity\nand cognition after we controlled for the effects of sensory\nfunctioning, which is known to influence both activity level and\ncognitive functioning.\nSpecifically, our aims in the current study were to determine\nthe following: (a) whether general lifestyle activities influence\ncognitive functioning after the influence of sensory function-\ning is controlled for, and (b) whether activity and sensory\nfunctioning account for age-related variance in current cognition\nand cognitive change. Our subsidiary aim was to examine the\nrelative contributions of age, activity, and sensory functioning to\nthe explained variance in cognition. We achieved these aims\nby examining the Australian Longitudinal Study on Ageing\n(ALSA) data set across two waves of data collected over a 6-\nyear interval. ALSA is a population-based study that examines\nthe psychological, medical, and demographic profile of older\nadults residing in South Australia.\nMETHODS\nParticipants\nWe drew participants for the current study from the ALSA.\nThe initial sample consisted of 2,087 participants and was\nconstructed by means of the South Australian Electoral Roll\n(see Andrews, Clark, & Luszez, 2002, for a more detailed\noverview of the recruitment of participants). Currently, three\nmain waves of psychological data collection have taken place.\nAdditional cognitive measures central to this study were only\nintroduced at the second and third wave of data collection.\nTherefore, we included only those participants who took part in\nthe second and third data-collection points in the present study.\nThis enabled us to examine data over a 6-year interval from the\nsecond wave (Time 1) to the third wave (Time 2). We screened\nfor dementia by using the Mini-Mental State Examination\n(MMSE; Folstein, Folstein, & Mc Hugh, 1975). We removed\nparticipants with a score below the clinical cutoff from the\nsample.\nwhom were female. We evaluated the background character-\nistics of self-rated health and premorbid intelligence. Partic-\nipants rated their general health on a 5-point scale from 1\n(excellent) to 5 (poor). We assessed premorbid intelligence with\nthe revised version of the National Adult Reading Test (NART-\nR; Blair & Spreen, 1989), which involved articulation of a list\nof words that violate the phoneme\u00adgrapheme rules. The mean\nrevealed a significant change in health (t \u00bc 4.78, p , .001) and\nsmall albeit significant change in NART-R scores to be\nsomewhat surprising, given that it is purported as a measure\nof premorbid intelligence (Crawford, Deary, Starr, & Whalley,\n2001). In addition, participants recorded the age at which they\ndiscontinued their education from 1 (never went to school) to 7\n(18 years or over). The median age at which participants\ncompleted their schooling was a score of 3 (discontinued\nschooling at 14 years of age), which is equivalent to completion\nof primary schooling and midcompletion of secondary\nschooling.\nA comparison between the current subsample of individuals\nand the noncontinuing participants on the main variables of\ninterest to the study revealed that the current sample performed\nsignificantly higher on the cognitive outcome measures and\nengaged in significantly more activities, although the differ-\nences were moderate. There were no significant differences in\nself-rated health, education, or NART-R errors.\nMeasures\nLevel of activity. --We used the AAP (Clark & Bond, 1995)\nas a measure of general activity level. The AAP provides\na wide-ranging profile of the lifestyle activities of older adults\nby measuring people's behavior and physical capacity to carry\nout a number of daily tasks. The AAP consists of 21 questions\nthat deal with how often a person completes certain activities\nintegral to daily functioning within a typical 3-month period.\nParticipants respond on a 4-point scale of 0 to 3 to indicate\nincreasing frequency of activity. These response scales were\ntailored to individual activities based on the likely frequency of\neach activity in order to overcome possible polarized or skewed\ndistributions. On the basis of a principal component analysis\nconducted by Clark and Bond, the AAP questions were\ngrouped into four distinct categories: household maintenance\n(seven items, e.g., gardening, car maintenance), domestic\nchores (eight items, e.g., washing dishes, preparing a main\nmeal), social activities (four items, e.g., participating in outdoor\nrecreation or sports, participating at a club) and service to others\n(five items, e.g., caring for other family members, doing\nvolunteer work). The principal component analysis demon-\nstrated that the four factors accounted for 43.55% of the total\nvariance. The scale construction process was calculated by\ncomparing the individuals in the original sample with those in\na validation sample, which demonstrated congruence between\nthe four factors of .94 to .99. The reliability coefficients of the\nsubscales were also shown to be good, ranging from .51 to .80.\nHence, the AAP has been demonstrated to be reliable and valid\nfor use in community-dwelling older adults as a measure of\nlifestyle activities. For the purposes of the current study, we\nstandardized each subscale to a mean score of 50 with\na standard deviation of 20, as recommended for research\npurposes by Clark and Bond.\nSensory functioning. --We used the biomarkers of auditory\nacuity and visual acuity as measures of sensory function. By\neach ear, we assessed auditory acuity. We used a standard\nbracketing technique, and the final criterion was the average of\nthe thresholds achieved in the left and right ear at each\nfrequency, as measured in decibels. We measured corrected\ndistance visual acuity for each eye with a Snellen chart at\na distance of 3 m. We recorded the smallest line that\na participant read successfully with the left or right eye,\nwhereby at least half of the characters in the line were correctly\nread. The final score was the logarithm of the smallest line\nsuccessfully read.\nCognitive Outcome Measures\nSpeed of processing. --We used the Digit Symbol Sub-\nstitution test (DSST), a subtest of the Revised Wechsler Adult\nIntelligence Scale (Wechsler, 1981), as a measure of speed of\nprocessing. The DSST required participants to complete a series\nof 93 digit\u00adsymbol substitutions. The final score was the\nnumber of correctly substituted symbols completed within a\nPicture naming. --We used an abbreviated version of the\nBoston Naming Test (BNT; Mack, Freed, Williams, &\nHenderson, 1992) as a measure of visual confrontation naming.\nThe BNT comprises 15 line sketches of common objects.\nParticipants were required to name the object illustrated in the\ndrawing. The final score was the number of items named\ncorrectly without cues.\nVerbal fluency. --We used the Excluded Letter Fluency Test\n(Crawford, Bryan, Luszcz, Obonsawin, & Stewart, 2000) and\nthe Uses for Common Objects Test (Getzels & Jackson, 1962)\nas measures of verbal fluency. The Excluded Letter Fluency\nTask requires participants to articulate as many words as\npossible that do not contain a specified letter. Two 60-s trials\nwere completed requiring participants to generate words not\ncontaining the letters e and a. The Uses for Common Objects\nTask requires individuals to construct novel uses for everyday\nobjects. Two 90-s trials were completed requiring participants to\ngenerate as many novel and unique uses as they could for\na bottle and a paperclip. The final score for each test was the sum\nof the correct responses achieved across the two trials.\nIncidental recall. --We used two measures of incidental\nrecall following the administration of the DSST and the BNT.\nAfter the Digit Symbol Substitution test, participants were\nasked to recall as many of the symbols as they could from the\nprevious task. Following the BNT, participants were required to\nname any of the pictures that they could remember. The final\nscore for each task was the correct number of items recalled.\nProcedure\nDuring each wave, data collection was conducted in two main\nphases. The initial phase comprised an interview in the\nparticipants' own home, during which background information\nwas obtained and questionnaires, such as the MMSE and the\nAAP, were completed. Approximately 2 weeks later, partic-\nipants were invited to complete the second phase of data\ncollection, which involved a clinical assessment interview,\nduring which the neuropsychological measures of cognition\nwere administered and the sensory functions were measured.\nStatistical Analyses\nWe conducted hierarchical multiple regression analyses to\nexamine the contribution of a generally active lifestyle to (a)\ncurrent cognitive functioning using the Time 1 measures of\ncognitive performance (cross-sectional analyses), and (b)\nchange in cognitive function over a 6-year interval (longitu-\ndinal analyses) using residualized change scores of cognitive\nperformance. Following the regression analyses, we performed\ncommonality analyses to provide a clearer understanding of\nthe relative contributions of age, general lifestyle activities,\nand sensory functioning to the explained variance in cog-\nnition. During all analyses, we excluded missing data\npairwise.\nRESULTS\nPrior to analysis, we examined the data set for outliers. We\nattenuated the influence of extreme univariate outliers, defined\nas a case with a standardized score in excess of 3.29, by\nassigning a raw score to those cases that were one unit above\nthe next most extreme case, as recommended by Tabachnick\nand Fidell (2001). This successfully reduced the influence of\noutliers.\nDescriptive and inferential statistics for the subscales of the\nAAP, the raw scores for measures of sensory functioning, and\nthe raw scores for each cognitive outcome measure at Time 1\nand Time 2 are presented in Table 1. We performed a series of\npaired sample t tests to determine changes in these measures\nwith time. There were significant differences between the mean\nscores for each measure, indicating a decrease in engagement in\nactivities and performance on tests of cognitive functioning\nacross time, with the exception of social activity, which in-\ncreased with time.\nWe created composite scores for variables with more than\none measure to avoid overmodeling of the data in regression\nanalyses. From the average of the standardized scores of each\nmeasure, we calculated these scores for sensory functioning,\nverbal fluency, incidental recall, and the AAP.\nPrior to regression analyses, we conducted a series of\nPearson product moment correlations between age, activity,\nsensory functioning, and cognitive outcome measures at Time 1\nand Time 2. The correlation coefficients are presented in Table\n2. In accordance with our expectations, age and activity were\nsignificantly correlated with each cognitive measure at Time 1\nand at Time 2. Sensory functioning at each wave also showed\na significant correlation with each cognitive measure at Time 1\nand Time 2.\nOn the basis of these correlations, we performed a series of\nhierarchical multiple regression analyses to determine if activity\ncontinued to contribute to the variance in each cognitive\nfunction after we statistically controlled for the influence of\nTable 1.

We present the\nregression analyses separately for the cross-sectional and\nlongitudinal examinations; these analyses are followed by\ncommonality analyses to partition the variance in each\ncognitive outcome measure.\nCross-Sectional Analyses\nWe carried out one three-step hierarchical model for each\ncognitive outcome measure. We devised the model to allow an\nexamination of (a) whether current activity influences current\ncognition, beyond the influence attributable to current sensory\nfunctioning, by testing if activity was a predictor of cognitive\nfunctioning after we statistically controlled for the influence of\nsensory functioning; and (b) whether activity and sensory\nfunctioning account for age-related cognitive ability, by testing\nif age was a predictor of cognitive functioning after we con-\ntrolled for the variance attributable to sensory functioning and\nactivity. In the model, we entered sensory functioning(T1)\nat Step\n1, followed by activity(T1)\nat Step 2 and age at Step 3. The results\nare presented in Table 3.\nThe regression models demonstrate that sensory functioning\nwas a good predictor of current cognition, particularly for speed\nof processing. In relation to our first aim, current activity\ncontributed significantly to the variance in all indicators of\ncurrent cognition after we controlled for the influence of\nsensory functioning. Activity contributed a 4% increase in total\nvariance explained for speed of processing, 3% for picture\nnaming, 4% for incidental recall, and 5% for verbal fluency. In\nrelation to our second aim, prior entry of activity and sensory\nfunctioning did not reduce the contribution of age to a non-\nsignificant amount, suggesting that additional variables are also\nresponsible for age-related declines in cognitive functioning.\nWe then conducted a commonality analysis (Pedazhur, 1982)\nto partition the variance in each cognitive outcome measure that\nis unique and shared among the predictors of activity, sensory\nfunctioning, and age. The results are presented in Table 4. The\nunique variance attributable to each of the predictors was small.\nThe amount of shared variance between age and activity and\nbetween age and sensory functioning was substantially larger\nthan the shared variance between sensory functioning and\nactivity. Age accounted for the largest amount of total variance\nin cognition. For speed of processing and picture naming, this\nwas followed by sensory functioning and then activity, whereas\nthis order was reversed for incidental recall and verbal fluency.\nImportantly, the total variance accounted for by activity was\nnotable, ranging from 5% to 14%.\nLongitudinal Analyses\nWe conducted longitudinal analyses by using a similar three-\nstep hierarchical model as for the cross-sectional analyses. We\nentered sensory functioning at Step 1, followed by activity(T1)\nat\nStep 2 and age at Step 3. We entered sensory functioning as\na residualized change score, which we derived from the actual\nvalue of sensory functioning at Time 2 minus the value pre-\ndicted by the regression equation, using Time 1 as a predictor for\neach case, as recommended by Menard (1991). We did this to\ncontrol for the influence of sensory functioning on activity and\ncognition at both time points. We also examined cognitive\nchange by using a residualized change score of cognition as the\noutcome measure. We selected residualized scores of cognition\nover an absolute difference score because of the wide variance\nin age-related declines in cognition in older adults. The results\nare presented in Table 5.\nThe regression models demonstrate that sensory functioning\nonly accounted for a moderate amount of variance in cognitive\nchange scores for picture naming and verbal fluency and did not\nmake a significant contribution to speed of processing or in-\ncidental recall. In relation to our first aim, activity contributed\nsignificantly to the variance in change scores for speed of\nprocessing, picture naming, and incidental recall, after we\ncontrolled for the influence of sensory functioning, but it made\nno significant contribution to change scores for verbal fluency.\nActivity contributed a 1% increase in total variance explained\nfor speed of processing, 3% for picture naming, and 3% for\nincidental recall. In relation to our second aim, prior entry of\nTable 3. Hierarchical Multiple Regression Analysis for Cross-Sectional Analysis Predicting Current Cognition\nfrom Sensory Functioning, Activity, and Age\nNotes: This is a cross-sectional analysis that uses current cognition scores as dependent variables. Current cognition scores, sensory functioning, and activity\nare taken from Time 1. The beta weights are the actual weights at each step.\nTable 4.

Age remained a significant,\nalthough moderate, predictor of speed of processing and\nincidental recall, after prior entry of sensory functioning and\nactivity. This suggests that, in combination, sensory functioning\nand activity account for a large portion of the age-related\nvariance in cognitive change for some cognitive measures.\nWe again conducted a commonality analysis to partition the\nvariance in cognitive change that is unique and shared among\nthe predictors of activity, sensory functioning, and age. The\nresults are presented in Table 6. The unique variance accounted\nfor by each of the predictors was marginal. Again, there were\nrelatively large amounts of shared variance between age and\nactivity, and between age and sensory functioning, in compar-\nison with the shared variance between sensory functioning and\nactivity. There was no consistency as to which predictor\naccounted for the largest amount of total variance in cognition.\nThe total variance accounted for by all predictors was marginal.\nDISCUSSION\nIn the present study we aimed to examine whether general\nlifestyle activities contribute to current cognition and cognitive\nchange over a 6-year interval in a sample of older adults after\nwe controlled for the influence of sensory functioning, and\nwhether sensory functioning and activity accounted for age-\nrelated declines in current cognition and cognitive change. We\nextended the findings of previous research by (a) using an index\nof general lifestyle activity rather than a restricted list of\nspecific activities, (b) using both a cross-sectional and longi-\ntudinal design, and (c) controlling for the influence of sensory\nfunctioning. In addition, we performed commonality analyses\nto provide new information concerning the unique and shared\nvariance accounted for in cognition by age, activity, and sen-\nsory functioning.\nCross-sectional regression analyses revealed that current\nactivity level accounted for a significant amount of variance in\ncurrent levels of speed of processing, picture naming, incidental\nrecall, and verbal fluency beyond the variance attributable to\nsensory functioning. These results suggest that a generally active\nlifestyle is associated with higher levels of current cognitive\nfunctioning in older adults. These findings are in accordance\nwith previous cross-sectional studies (Christensen et al., 1996;\ncontinued to predict cognitive functioning after we controlled\nfor activity and sensory functioning, suggesting that other\nfactors also influence the age-related variance in cognition.\nLongitudinal regression analyses revealed that general\nlifestyle activities were a significant predictor of change scores\nfor speed of processing, picture naming, and incidental recall,\nafter we controlled for sensory functioning, but not for verbal\nfluency. This suggests that general lifestyle activities influence\nsome domains of cognitive change in older adults, although the\nadditional variance accounted for by activity was moderate.\nThese findings are consistent with previous longitudinal\nresearch (Mackinnon et al., 2003). After we controlled for the\nvariance attributable to activity and sensory functioning, age no\nlonger made a significant contribution to change in picture\nnaming, and sensory functioning accounted for all of the age-\nrelated variance in change in verbal fluency. In contrast, age\ncontinued to contribute a significant, although negligible,\namount of variance in change in speed of processing and\nincidental recall. This suggests that sensory functioning and\nactivity account for a worthy amount of the age-related variance\nin cognitive change.\nThe observation that activity was not a unique predictor of\nchange in verbal fluency contradicts the cross-sectional findings,\nwhich showed activity to be a unique predictor of each cognitive\noutcome measure. Thus, although cross-sectional research is\nimportant for identifying relationships between variables, lon-\ngitudinal research is imperative for disentangling how variables\ninfluence age-related changes in cognition.\nOverall, these findings support the proposal that general\nlifestyle activities make a significant contribution to both current\ncognition and cognitive change in older adults. However, it\nTable 5. Hierarchical Multiple Regression Analysis for Longitudinal Analysis Predicting Cognitive Change\nfrom Sensory Functioning, Activity, and Age\nNotes: This is a longitudinal analysis that uses score changes as dependent variables. Sensory functioning is a change score, and activity is taken from Time 1.\nThe beta weights are the actual weights at each step.\nTable 6.

The strength of the relationship\nidentified between activity and cognitive aging was similar to\nthe relationship found by Pushkar Gold and colleagues (1995),\nwho also used an encompassing measure of activity in\na longitudinal study. This suggests that broader measures of\nactivity may more adequately identify the extent to which\nengaging in general lifestyle activities benefits older adults'\ncognitive performance. However, Hultsch and associates (1999)\nalso used a more encompassing activity measure and failed to\nprovide convincing support for the influence of activity on\ncognitive functioning. An examination of the participant sample\nfrom the aforementioned studies reveals that both the study by\nPushkar Gold and colleagues and the study by us examined\na population-based sample of individuals with relatively low\neducation and health ratings, whereas the individuals in the\nstudy by Hultsch and associates were healthier and more\neducated. It is therefore plausible that although a broader\nactivity measure may be useful for detecting a relationship\nbetween activity and cognitive functioning, this relationship is\ngreater in an average population-based sample than a healthier\nand educationally superior one. Further research is required to\nmore fully examine this notion.\nThe commonality analyses revealed that the unique cognitive\nvariance attributable to age, activity, and sensory functioning\nwas moderate and that the largest portion of the total variance\nwas related to shared variance between age and activity and\nbetween age and sensory functioning. This highlights the\nimportance of including measures of sensory functioning when\nexamining the relations between age, activity levels, and\ncognition. The total variance attributable to activity was note-\nworthy, which supports the proposal of activity as an important\npredictor of cognition.\nThe finding that sensory functioning was a good predictor of\ncurrent cognition and a moderate predictor of cognitive change\nis consistent with previous research (Anstey & Smith, 1999;\nBaltes & Lindenberger, 1997). This finding adds further\nsupport to the growing body of literature that attributes\na fundamental role to sensory functioning as a physiological\npredictor of cognitive development across the life span, and it\nagain highlights the need to control for sensory functioning\nwhen examining cognitive performance in older adults.\nThe large change experienced in cognitive functioning with\nincreasing age, as shown in the current study, is a common\nfinding in the cognitive aging literature (eg. Collie, Shafiz-\nAntonacci, Maruff, Tyler, & Currie, 1999; Newson, Kemps, &\nidentify the mechanisms by which cognitive skills can be\npreserved, or even enhanced, in older age so as to develop\npractical intervention strategies to combat age-related cognitive\ndecline. However, not all predictors of cognitive decline are\namenable to change. For example, older adults have minimal\ncontrol over declines in sensory functioning and health. By\ncontrast, they can readily modify their engagement in general\nlifestyle activities. Thus, encouraging older adults to lead active\nlifestyles offers a practicable strategy for promoting cognitive\nfunctioning and enabling independent living to an older age.\nIdentifying techniques to enhance cognitive functioning in\nolder adults is all the more important, given the demographic\npredictions of a burgeoning increase in the ratio of older to\nyounger adults in the near future.\n"
