From 1999 to 2011, consumption of hydrocodone more than doubled and consumption\nof oxycodone increased by nearly 500% (42). During the same time frame, the OPR-related\noverdose death rate nearly quadrupled (15). According to the United States Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention (CDC), the unprecedented increase in OPR consumption has led to the\n\"worst drug overdose epidemic in [US] history\" (58). Given the magnitude of the problem, the\nCDC recently added opioid overdose prevention to its list of top five public health challenges (13).\nOverdose mortality is not the only adverse public health outcome associated with increased\nOPR use. The rise in opioid consumption has also been associated with a near doubling in visits\nindividuals seeking treatment for addiction to OPRs (66, 68). The correlation between opioid sales,\nOPR-related overdose deaths, and treatment seeking for opioid addiction is striking (Figure 1).\nAddiction is defined as continued use of a drug despite negative consequences (1). Opioids are\nhighly addictive because they induce euphoria (positive reinforcement) and cessation of chronic\nuse produces dysphoria (negative reinforcement). Chronic exposure to opioids results in structural\nand functional changes in regions of the brain that mediate affect, impulse, reward, and motivation\n(83, 91). The disease of opioid addiction arises from repeated exposure to opioids and can occur\nin individuals using opioids to relieve pain and in nonmedical users.\nAnother important feature of the opioid addiction epidemic is the relationship between OPR\nuse and heroin use. According to the federal government's National Survey on Drug Use and\nHealth (NSDUH), 4 out of 5 current heroin users report that their opioid use began with OPRs\n(54). Many of these individuals appear to be switching to heroin after becoming addicted to\nOPRs because heroin is less expensive on the black market. For example, in a recent sample of\nRate\nYear\nRates of OPR sales, OPR-related unintentional overdose deaths, and OPR addiction treatment admissions,\nChanges may still occur before final publication online and in print\nNon-Hispanic white Non-Hispanic black\nPercent of all heroin admissions\nYear\nopioid-addicted individuals who switched from OPRs to heroin, 94% reported doing so because\nOPRs \"were far more expensive and harder to obtain\" (16, p. 24).\nThe increased prevalence of opioid addiction has also been associated with increases in heroin-\nrelated morbidity and mortality. For example, since 2001, heroin addiction treatment admissions\nfor whites ages 20\u00ad34 have increased sharply (Figure 2). During this time frame, heroin overdose\nThe current opioid addiction crisis is, in many ways, a replay of history. America's first epidemic of\nopioid addiction occurred in the second half of the nineteenth century. In the 1840s, the estimated\nnational supply of opium and morphine could have supported a maximum of 0.72 opioid-addicted\nIt reached its peak in the mid-1890s, when the supply could have supported a maximum of 4.59\nopioid-addicted individuals per 1,000 persons. The ceiling rate then began to decline, and by 1920\nthere were no more than 1.97 opioid-addicted individuals per 1,000 persons in the United States.\nThe epidemic had diverse origins. Mothers dosed themselves and their children with opium\ntinctures and patent medicines. Soldiers used opium and morphine to treat diarrhea and painful\ninjuries. Drinkers alleviated hangovers with opioids. Chinese immigrants smoked opium, a practice\nthat spread to the white underworld. But the main source of the epidemic was iatrogenic morphine\naddiction, which coincided with the spread of hypodermic medication during 1870\u00ad1895. The\nmodal opioid-addicted individual was a native-born white woman with a painful disorder, often\nof a chronic nature.\nNineteenth-century physicians addicted patients--and, not infrequently, themselves--because\nthey had few alternatives to symptomatic treatment. Cures were scarce and the etiology of painful\nconditions was poorlyunderstood.An injection of morphine almost magically alleviated symptoms,\npleasing doctors and patients. Many patients continued to acquire and inject morphine, the sale\nof which was poorly controlled.\nThe revolutions in bacteriology and public health, which reduced diarrheal and other diseases\ncommonly treated with opium; the development of alternative analgesics such as aspirin; stricter\nwww.annualreviews.org \u00b7 The Opioid Addiction Epidemic 25.3\nChanges may still occur before final publication online and in print\nprescription laws; and admonitions about morphine in the lay and professional literature stemmed\nthe addiction tide. One important lesson of the first narcotic epidemic is that physicians were\neducable. Indeed, by 1919, narcotic overprescribing was the hallmark of older, less-competent\nphysicians. The younger, better-trained practitioners who replaced them were more circumspect\nabout administering and prescribing opioids (5).\nFor the rest of the twentieth century, opioid addiction epidemics resulted from transient in-\ncreases in the incidence of nonmedical heroin use in urban areas. After World War II, these\nepidemics disproportionately affected inner-city minority populations, such as the large, heavily\npublicized increase in ghetto heroin use and addiction at the end of the 1960s (24, 37).\nIn 1986 a paper describing the treatment of 38 chronic pain patients concluded that OPRs could\nbe prescribed safely on a long-term basis (61). Despite its low-quality evidence, the paper was\nwidely cited to support expanded use of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain. Opioid use increased\nacceleration was fueled in large part by the introduction in 1995 of OxyContin, an extended\nrelease formulation of oxycodone manufactured by Purdue Pharma.\nprograms through direct sponsorship or financial grants and launched a multifaceted campaign\nto encourage long-term use of OPRs for chronic non-cancer pain (86). As part of this campaign,\nPurdue provided financial support to the American Pain Society, the American Academy of Pain\nMedicine, the Federation of State Medical Boards, the Joint Commission, pain patient groups,\nand other organizations (27). In turn, these groups all advocated for more aggressive identification\nand treatment of pain, especially use of OPRs.\nFor example, in 1995, the president of the American Pain Society introduced a campaign en-\ntitled \"Pain is the Fifth Vital Sign\" at the society's annual meeting. This campaign encouraged\nhealth care professionals to assess pain with the \"same zeal\" as they do with vital signs and urged\nmore aggressive use of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain (9). Shortly thereafter, the Veterans'\nAffairs health system, as well as the Joint Commission, which accredits hospitals and other health\ncare organizations, embraced the Pain is the Fifth Vital Sign campaign to increase the identi-\nfication and treatment of pain, especially with OPRs. Similarly, the American Pain Society and\nthe American Academy of Pain Medicine issued a consensus statement endorsing opioid use for\nchronic non-cancer pain (31). Although the statement cautioned against imprudent prescribing,\nthis warning may have been overshadowed by assertions that the risk of addiction and tolerance\nwas low, risk of opioid-induced respiratory depression was short-lived, and concerns about drug\ndiversion and abuse should not constrain prescribing.\nPrior to the introduction of OxyContin, many physicians were reluctant to prescribe OPRs\non a long-term basis for common chronic conditions because of their concerns about addiction,\ntolerance, and physiological dependence (80). To overcome what they claimed to be \"opiopho-\nbia,\" physician-spokespersons for opioid manufacturers published papers and gave lectures in\nwhich they claimed that the medical community had been confusing addiction with \"physical\ndependence.\" They described addiction as rare and completely distinct from so-called \"physical\ndependence,\" which was said to be \"clinically unimportant\" (60, p. 300). They cited studies with\nserious methodological flaws to highlight the claim that the risk of addiction was less than 1% (28,\nIn addition to minimizing risks of OPRs, the campaign advanced by opioid manufacturers\nand pain organizations exaggerated the benefits of long-term OPR use. In fact, high-quality,\nChanges may still occur before final publication online and in print\nlong-term clinical trials demonstrating the safety and efficacy of OPRs for chronic non-cancer\npain had never been conducted. Surveys of patients with chronic non-cancer pain receiving\nlong-term OPRs suggest that most patients continued to experience significant chronic pain and\ndysfunction (25, 76). The CDC and some professional societies now warn clinicians to avoid\nprescribing OPRs for common chronic conditions (29).\nAlthough increased opioid consumption over the past two decades has been driven largely\nby greater ambulatory use for chronic non-cancer pain (8), opioid use for acute pain among\nhospitalized patients has also increased sharply. A recent study found that physicians prescribed\noften in high doses (34). The Joint Commission's adoption of the Pain is the Fifth Vital Sign\ncampaign and federally mandated patient satisfaction surveys asking patients to rate how often\nhospital staff did \"everything they could to help you with your pain\" are noteworthy, given the\nassociation with increased hospital use of OPRs.\nPolicy makers and the media often characterize the opioid crisis as a problem of nonmedical OPR\nabuse by adolescents and young adults. However, several lines of evidence suggest that addiction\noccurring in both medical and nonmedical users, rather than abuse per se, is the key driver of\nopioid-related morbidity and mortality in medical and nonmedical OPR users.\nOpioid Harms Are Not Limited to Nonmedical Users\nOver the past decade, federal and state policy makers have attempted to reduce OPR abuse and\nOPR-related overdose deaths. Despite these efforts, morbidity and mortality associated with OPRs\nhave continued to worsen in almost every US state (10). Thus far, these efforts have focused\nprimarily on preserving access to OPRs for chronic pain patients while reducing nonmedical\nOPR use (89), defined as the use of a medication without a prescription, in a way other than as\nprescribed, or for the experience or feeling it causes. However, policy makers who focus solely on\nreducing nonmedical use are failing to appreciate the high opioid-related morbidity and mortality\nin pain patients receiving OPR prescriptions for medical purposes.\nThe incidence of nonmedical OPR use increased sharply in the late 1990s, peaking in 2002\nwith 2.7 million new nonmedical users. Since 2002, the incidence of nonmedical use has gradually\nusers has declined, overdose deaths, addiction treatment admissions, and other adverse public\nhealth outcomes associated with OPR use have increased dramatically since 2002.\nA comparison of age groups of nonmedical OPR users to age groups suffering the highest rates\nof opioid-related morbidity and mortality suggests that strategies focused exclusively on reducing\nnonmedical OPR use are insufficient (Figure 4). Although past-month nonmedical use of OPRs\nis most common in teenagers and young adults between the ages of 15 and 24 (65), OPR overdose\ndeaths occur most often in adults ages 45\u00ad54, and the age group that has experienced the greatest\nincrease in overdose mortality over the past decade is 55\u00ad64 (15), an age group in which medical\nuse of OPRs is common. Opioid overdoses appear to occur more frequently in medical OPR users\nthan in young nonmedical users. For example, in a study of 254 unintentional opioid overdose\ndecedents in Utah, 92% of the decedents had been receiving legitimate OPR prescriptions from\nhealth care providers for chronic pain (39).\nMiddle-aged women and the elderly are more likely than other groups to visit doctors with\ncomplaints of pain (4). The development of iatrogenic opioid addiction in these groups may\nexplain why they have experienced the largest increase in hospital stays resulting from opioid user\nwww.annualreviews.org \u00b7 The Opioid Addiction Epidemic 25.5\nChanges may still occur before final publication online and in print\nNumber of new users (in thousands)\nYear\nFirst-time nonmedical use of pain relievers.

Source: 56.\nopioid-addicted, consistent findings in samples of OPR overdose decedents show that deaths are\nmost common in individuals likely to be suffering from opioid addiction. A study of 295 unin-\ntentional OPR overdose deaths in West Virginia found that four out of five decedents (80%) had\na history of a substance use disorder (33). Another study found that among 254 opioid overdose\ndecedents in Utah, about three-fourths (76%) had relatives or friends who were concerned about\nthe decedent's misuse of opioids prescribed for pain (39).\nThe sharp increase in the prevalence of opioid addiction is a key driver of opioid-related\nmorbidity and mortality. The misattribution of the opioid crisis to nonmedical use or abuse rather\nthan to addiction has stymied efforts to address this crisis because it suggests a different set of\npolicies. When the opioid crisis is reframed from an \"epidemic of opioid abuse\" to an \"epidemic\nof opioid addiction,\" the strategies required to control the epidemic become clearer.\nThis section organizes strategies for curbing the epidemic of opioid addiction into primary, sec-\nondary, and tertiary prevention. Although some specific interventions are discussed, we do not\nprovide an exhaustive list. Rather, our purpose is to demonstrate that prevention strategies em-\nployed in epidemiologic responses to communicable and noncommunicable disease epidemics\napply equally well when the disease in question is opioid addiction. Interventions should focus on\npreventing new cases of opioid addiction (primary prevention), identifying early cases of opioid\naddiction (secondary prevention), and ensuring access to effective addiction treatment (tertiary\nprevention).\nPrimary Prevention\nThe aim of primaryprevention is to reducethe incidence of a disease or condition. Opioid addiction\nis typically chronic, life-long, difficult to treat, and associated with high rates of morbidity and\nmortality. Thus, bringing the opioid addiction epidemic under control requires effort to prevent\nnew cases from developing.\nwww.annualreviews.org \u00b7 The Opioid Addiction Epidemic 25.7\nChanges may still occur before final publication online and in print\nPreventing addiction caused by medical exposure to OPRs. The incidence of iatrogenic\nopioid addiction in patients treated with long-term OPRs is unknown because adequately designed\nprospective studies have not been conducted. However, opioid use disorders appear to be highly\nprevalent in chronic pain patients treated with OPRs. A survey performed by Boscarino et al.\nof 705 chronic pain patients treated in specialty and primary care outpatient centers found that\n26% met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) IV criteria for opioid\ndependence, and 35% met DSM V criteria for an opioid use disorder (6, 7). A systematic review\nof studies utilizing opioids for low back pain found that aberrant drug abuse\u00adrelated behaviors\nsuggestive of addiction occurred in up to 24% of patients on long-term OPRs (50). Many patients\non long-term OPRs worry about dependence and addiction and express a desire to taper or cease\nopioid therapy (76).\nTo reduce the incidence of iatrogenic opioid addiction, health care professionals must prescribe\nopioidsmorecautiouslyfor both acuteand chronicpain.Unfortunately,thecampaign to encourage\nOPR prescribing has left many health care providers with a poor appreciation of opioid risks,\nespecially the risk of addiction, and an overestimation of opioid benefits. Despite these risks and\nthe lack of evidence supporting long-term efficacy, OPR prescribing for chronic non-cancer pain\nincreased over the past decade while use of nonopioid analgesics decreased (20). This pattern\nhighlights the need for prescriber education that explicitly corrects misperceptions about OPR\nsafety and efficacy. If clinicians treating pain more often substituted nonopioid analgesics and\nnonpharmaceutical approaches for OPRs, evidence suggests the incidence of opioid addiction\nwould decline and outcomes for patients with chronic non-cancer pain would improve.\nMany prescribers are unaware that evidence of long-term effectiveness for OPRs is lacking\nand that risks, in addition to addiction, include respiratory depression leading to unintentional\noverdose death; serious fractures from falls (71, 77); hypogonadism and other endocrine effects that\ncan cause a spectrum of adverse effects (88); increased pain sensitivity (2); chronic constipation\nand serious fecal impaction (81); and chronic dry mouth, which can lead to tooth decay (79).\nProviding prescribers with accurate information about opioid risks and benefits could result in\nmore informed risk/benefit appraisals. Indeed, one of the lessons learned from the nineteenth-\ncentury opioid addiction epidemic was that physicians were educable. By the early 1900s, aggressive\nopioid prescribing had become the hallmark of older, less-competent physicians (5).\nSeveral states, including Iowa, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Ohio, Tennessee, and Utah, have\npassed mandatory prescriber education legislation (89). In addition, the US Food and Drug Admin-\nistration (FDA) is requiring manufacturers of extended release and long-acting OPRs to sponsor\neducational programs for prescribers. Unfortunately, some of these educational programs, includ-\ning those required by the FDA, imply that OPRs are safe and effective for chronic non-cancer\npain instead of offering prescribers accurate information about OPR risks and benefits (84). It\nremains unclear whether or not educational programs such as these will reduce OPR prescribing\nfor common conditions where risks of use are likely to outweigh benefits.\nSome opioid manufacturers have reformulated OPRs to make them more difficult to misuse\nthrough an intranasal or injection route. These so-called abuse-deterrent formulations (ADFs)\nmay offer safety advantages over easily snorted and injected OPRs, but they do not render them\nless addictive. Opioid addiction, in both medical and nonmedical OPR users, most frequently\ndevelops through oral use (85). Some opioid-addicted individuals may transition to intranasal or\ninjection use, but most continue to use OPRs orally (47). Thus, ADFs should not be considered\na primary prevention strategy for opioid addiction.\nIn 2013, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene released emergency\nroom guidelines on OPR prescribing (55). Recommendations included in the guidelines call for\nsubstituting nonopioid analgesics when possible, avoiding use of extended-release OPRs, and\nChanges may still occur before final publication online and in print\nlimiting the supply to three days. Reducing patient exposure to OPRs and reducing the supply of\nexcess OPRs in the homes of discharged patients may be effective strategies for preventing opioid\naddiction that can occur from both medical and nonmedical OPR use.\nPreventing addiction caused by nonmedical exposure to OPRs. Individuals who use OPRs\nnonmedically are at risk for developing opioid addiction. Thus, efforts to reduce nonmedical use\nare an important primary prevention strategy. Adolescents and young adults who experiment with\nnonmedical use are most likely to obtain OPRs for free from friends or family members who had\nreceived a legitimate prescription (70). This information suggests that more cautious prescribing\nis required to prevent nonmedical use of excess OPRs. Unused OPRs in medicine chests should\nbe immediately discarded or returned to a pharmacy, which became permissible in October 2014\nafter the Drug Enforcement Administration made a federal regulatory change (82).\nAlthough OPRs have an abuse liability similar to that of heroin (17), they are commonly per-\nceived as less risky. Seventy-three percent of eighth graders surveyed in 2013 perceived occasional\nuse of heroin without a needle as high risk, but only 26% perceived occasional use of Vicodin as\nhigh risk (41). Eighth graders also perceived occasional Vicodin use as less risky than occasional\nmarijuana use, less risky than smoking 1\u00ad5 cigarettes per day, and less risky than moderate alcohol\nuse.\nIndividuals who perceive the risk of nonmedical OPR use to be low may be more likely to\nmisuse OPRs. A 2004 survey found that college students who perceive a low level of risk from\nOPRs were 9.6 times more likely to use OPRs nonmedically, as compared with those who perceive\nthese medications as harmful (3). Although the ability for causal inference from this type of cross-\nsectional survey is limited, this finding suggests that social marketing campaigns designed to\nincrease perceived harmfulness of OPRs may be an effective prevention strategy.\nSecondary Prevention\nThe aim of secondary prevention is to screen for a health condition after its onset but before it\ncauses serious complications. Efforts to identify and treat opioid-addicted individuals early in the\ncourse of the disease are likely to reduce the risk of overdose, psychosocial deterioration, transition\nto injection opioid use, and medical complications.\nPhysicians are frequently the source of OPRs for opioid-addicted medical and nonmedical\nusers (43). Contacts with medical professionals present valuable opportunities for early identi-\nfication of opioid addiction. However, detection of opioid addiction in OPR users can be very\ndifficult. Opioid-addicted chronic pain patients may demonstrate aberrant drug-related behaviors,\nsuch as presenting for early refills. However, some opioid-addicted pain patients, especially those\nprescribed high doses, may not demonstrate drug-seeking behavior. Opioid-addicted individuals\nreceiving OPR prescriptions are often reluctant to disclose their concerns about addiction with\nprescribers because they fear being judged, being cut off from a legitimate supply, or being labeled\nas malingerers for feigning pain.\nThe difficulty of diagnosing opioid addiction in individuals motivated to conceal their condi-\ntion suggests that prescribers should seek collateral information before prescribing OPRs. Urine\ntoxicology can be used to verify a patient's self-reported drug ingestion history (53). However,\nurine toxicology of patients on long-term OPRs is not a reliable strategy for identifying opioid\naddiction. Urine toxicology cannot determine if a patient is taking extra doses or if a patient is\nusing OPRs by an intranasal or injection route.\nOpioid-addicted individuals may receive OPR prescriptions from multiple providers, a prac-\ntice referred to as \"doctor shopping.\" Doctor shoppers can be identified through use of state\nwww.annualreviews.org \u00b7 The Opioid Addiction Epidemic 25.9\nChanges may still occur before final publication online and in print\nprescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs). Some state PDMPs send unsolicited reports\nto the medical providers of doctor shoppers. Research suggests that unsolicited reports increase\nprescribers' ability to detect opioid addiction, sometimes prompting actions such as coordinating\ncare with other providers and modifying their own prescribing practices, as well as screening and\nreferring for addiction treatment (78).\nPrescribers in most states can consult their state PDMP before prescribing OPRs. PDMPs may\nbe especially useful in emergency rooms and other settings where opioid-addicted individuals feign\npain to obtain OPRs. Too often, however, patients identified as doctor shoppers are simply turned\naway, without hospital staff attempting to link these patients to addiction treatment services. Efforts\nmust be made to help these clinicians understand that drug-seeking patients are suffering from\nthe chronic, life-threatening disease of opioid addiction.\nOne challenge to PDMP effectiveness has been the low rate of provider use of these data\n(48). To increase prescriber utilization, Kentucky, Tennessee, and New York passed legislation\nmandating that prescribers check the PDMP before prescribing controlled substances. Data from\nthese states indicate that PDMP utilization increased rapidly subsequent to the mandate, which\ncorrelated with declines in opioid prescribing (KY, TN, NY) and a sharp drop in visits to multiple\nproviders (TN, NY) (35).\nTertiary Prevention\nTertiary prevention strategies involve both therapeutic and rehabilitative measures once a disease\nis firmly established. The goal of tertiary prevention of opioid addiction is to prevent overdose\ndeaths, medical complications, psychosocial deterioration, transition to injection drug use, and\ninjection-related infectious diseases. Doing so is accomplished mainly by ensuring that opioid-\naddicted individuals can access effective and affordable opioid addiction treatment.\nOpioid addiction treatment. The need for opioid addiction treatment is great and largely unmet.\nAccording to the NSDUH, an estimated 2.1 million Americans are addicted to OPRs, and 467,000\nare addicted to heroin (70). Unfortunately, these estimates exclude many opioid-addicted pain\npatients because NSDUH participants are told by surveyors that \"we are only interested in your\nuse of prescription pain relievers that were not prescribed for you or that you used only for the\nIn 2005, there were an estimated 10 million chronic pain patients receiving daily, long-term\n(42) suggests that the number may now exceed 10 million. Applying the prevalence estimates of\nDSM V opioid dependence found by Boscarino et al. (6) in pain patients taking long-term opioids\nwould indicate that an additional 2.5 million chronic pain patients may be opioid-addicted. Thus,\nthe total number of Americans suffering from opioid addiction may exceed 5 million.\nTreatment of opioid addiction includes pharmacotherapies and psychosocial approaches, in-\ncluding residential treatment, mutual-help programs (e.g., Narcotics Anonymous), and 12-Step\ntreatment programs. These modalities may be used as stand-alone interventions or in combination\nwith pharmacotherapy. Psychosocial opioid addiction treatment approaches show value and are\nan important treatment option (63). However, research with greater specificity and consistency is\nneeded to better evaluate outcomes.\nPharmacotherapies for opioid addiction include agonist maintenance with methadone and\npartial-agonist maintenance with buprenorphine and antagonist treatment with naltrexone, which\nis available in a monthly injection. Methadone and buprenorphine work by controlling cravings.\nNaltrexone works by preventing opioid-addicted individuals from feeling the effects of opioids.\nChanges may still occur before final publication online and in print\nNaltrexone may be helpful in highly motivated and carefully selected patients. However, patients\ntreated with naltrexone may be at increased risk of overdose death should relapse occur (23).\nMultiple well-designed randomized controlled trials provide strong evidence that buprenor-\nphine maintenance and methadone maintenance are safe and effective treatments for opioid ad-\nwith reduced overdose risk and improved maternal and fetal outcomes in pregnancy (19, 44, 51,\n72). Despite strong evidence supporting the use of buprenorphine and methadone, fewer than\n1 million Americans are receiving these treatments (87).\nMethadone poses a substantially greater risk of respiratory depression than does buprenorphine\nand can be obtained only from licensed opioid treatment programs (OTPs). The lack of OTPs\nin many communities presents a major challenge to expanding access to methadone. In contrast,\nbuprenorphine, a partial opioid agonist, has a better safety profile than does methadone and can be\nprescribed in an office-based setting (26). Barriers to accessing buprenorphine include federal lim-\nits on the number of patients a physician may treat, ineligibility of nurse practitioners to prescribe\nit, and inadequate integration of buprenorphine into primary care treatment. Access to buprenor-\nphine treatment could be expanded if the federal government eased or remove regulatory barriers.\nHarm-reduction approaches. Tertiary prevention strategies also include harm-reduction ap-\nproaches to improving health outcomes and reducing overdose deaths. In the subset of opioid-\naddicted individuals who are heroin injection drug users, evidence suggests that access to syringe\nexchange programs can prevent HIV infection (22). These efforts have been less effective at pre-\nventing hepatitis C infection, which is increasing rapidly in young, white IDUs (32).\nExpanding access to naloxone, an opioid overdose antidote, can prevent overdose deaths by\nreversing life-threatening respiratory depression. In the 1990s, syringe exchange programs began\ndistributing naloxone to injection drug users for the purpose of rescuing peers. Evidence shows that\nclients of syringe exchange programs demonstrated the ability to successfully reverse overdoses\nwhen they had been provided with naloxone and training (73). In addition, providing family\nmembers of opioid-addicted individuals and nonparamedic first responders with naloxone may be\nan effective strategy for rescuing overdose victims (21, 90). At present, there are more than 188\ncommunity-based naloxone distribution programs in 15 states and the District of Columbia (11).\nCONCLUSION\nThe increased prevalence of opioid addiction, caused by overprescribing of OPRs, has led to a\nparallel increase in opioid overdose deaths. Efforts to address this crisis that focus exclusively\non reducing nonmedical OPR use have been ineffective. Middle-aged and elderly individuals\ncommonly exposed to OPRs for pain treatment have experienced the largest increase in rates of\nopioid-related morbidity and mortality. Recognition that opioid addiction in both medical and\nnonmedical users is a key driver of opioid-related morbidity and mortality will result in a more\neffective response to this public health crisis. Just as public health authorities would approach\nother disease outbreaks, efforts must be made to reduce the incidence of opioid addiction, identify\ncases early, and ensure access to effective treatment.\nPreventing opioid addiction requires strategies that foster more cautious and selective OPR\nprescribing.However,ifprescribingisreduced without also ensuringaccess to addiction treatment,\nthe opioid overdose death rate may remain at a historically high level and the use of heroin may\ncontinue to increase. Coordinated efforts from federal agencies, state agencies, health care insurers,\nand health care providers are required to address the needs of millions of Americans now struggling\nwith this chronic, life-threatening disease.\nwww.annualreviews.org \u00b7 The Opioid Addiction Epidemic 25.11\nChanges may still occur before final publication online and in print\nDr. Alexander is Chair of the FDA's Peripheral and Central Nervous System Advisory Committee,\nserves as a paid consultant to IMS Health, and serves on an IMS Health scientific advisory board.\nThis arrangement has been reviewed and approved by Johns Hopkins University in accordance\nwith its conflict of interest policies.
