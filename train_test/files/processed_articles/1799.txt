Purpose: We\nused latent class analysis (LCA) to assess patterns of physical activity among adults, using the 7 d of accelerometer data from the 2003\u00ad\n2004 NHANES. Methods: For each participant, we determined the daily minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA),\nvigorous physical activity (VPA), and minutes of MVPA that occurred in bouts of 10 min. Participants were then categorized into\npatterns of activity, using LCA and adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics. Results: For overall MVPA, five classes of physical\nactivity were defined, including two least active classes, which averaged less than 25 min of MVPA per day and represented 78.7% of\nthe total study population. The most active class averaged 134 min of MVPA per day and comprised 0.9% of the population. The\nresults for bout minutes of MVPA were similar to the patterns produced for overall MVPA, with the exception of a ``weekend warrior''\nclass with moderate levels of physical activity Monday through Friday but with a much higher level of activity on the weekend,\nparticularly on Sunday. This class represented 1.8% of the population. Only 1.4% of all days achieved 10 min or more of VPA, and in\n91.1% of all days, participants accumulated less than 1 min of VPA. The LCA analysis of VPA did not produce stable results, because\nof the small number of participants registering any minutes of VPA. Conclusion: Our results indicate that a very large portion of\nthe U.S. population may be classified into patterns of physical activity that represent low levels of MVPA throughout the week.\nThe LCA analysis provided a novel approach for assessing patterns of objectively measured physical activity in epidemiologic studies.\nBecause of the increased concern about the lack of\nphysical activity in the United States, many annual\nnational health surveys such as the Behavioral Risk\nFactor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and the National\nHealth Interview Survey (NHIS) collect information on\nphysical activity levels. Reports and research from these\nsurveys cover various aspects of the nation`s levels of\nphysical activity (or inactivity), such as general physical\nactivity trends (12), trends among certain subpopulations\nsuch as Hispanics (1), percent of the U.S. population\nmeeting the Healthy People 2010 leisure-time physical\nactivity goals (6), or associations between physical activity\nand health care expenditures (26). These reports, however,\nhave in the past relied on self-report, which, when\ncompared with objectively measured physical activity, have\nbeen shown to have low correlations in the range of 0.14\u00ad\n0.53 (24). In addition, participants are generally categorized\ninto activity levels on the basis of overall descriptions of\nactivity frequency and intensity, without attempting to\ncategorize the potential differences in the pattern of\naccumulated physical activity over time.\nnation Survey (NHANES), physical activity as measured by\naccelerometry was added to the battery of assessments\namong those participants 6 yr old and older who were\nambulatory, providing the first nationally representative\nsample of objectively measured physical activity in the\nUnited States. In addition, the accelerometry data were\ncollected during a 7-d period, allowing for an assessment of\nthe number of minutes of physical activity accumulated by\neach participant on each day of a 7-d week.\nUsing latent class analysis (LCA), we assessed whether\npatterns, or classes, of physical activity exist among adults\nin this sample during the 7-d period.

For example, one class may have a very low\nmean number of minutes of physical activity from Monday\nto Friday, with a high average number of minutes of\nphysical activity on Saturday and Sunday (i.e., a ``weekend\nwarrior''). Another group, possibly active workers, may\nhave a large mean number of minutes of physical activity\nduring the work week but low mean minutes of physical\nactivity on the weekend.\nA recent study attempted to assess the effect of the\nweekend warrior activity pattern on the risk of mortality\n(14). In this study, the mortality outcomes of the weekend\nwarrior, defined as those who accumulate a large quantity\nof physical activity (Q 1000 kcalIwkj1) during a short\nperiod of time (1\u00ad2 dIwkj1), were compared with those\nwho accumulate a similar amount of activity (Q 1000\nkcalIwkj1) for a longer period of time (3+ dIwkj1), along\nkcalIwkj1) or sedentary (G 500 kcalIwkj1). Among low-\nrisk men, defined as nonsmokers, BMI G 25 kgImj2, no\nhistory of hypertension, and without hypercholesterolemia,\nweekend warriors demonstrated the lowest relative risk of\nmortality, indicating that as long as the accumulated\nphysical activity is sufficient, then the benefits will be\naccrued. Among high-risk men, defined as having any of\nthe above risk factors, only the regularly active showed\nimproved mortality risks as compared with the most\nsedentary group.\nMuch is now known about the overall levels of activity in\nthe United States, but few studies have attempted to define\npatterns of physical activity. The pattern in which individ-\nuals accumulate their physical activity can be highly\nvariable. To meet the recommended guidelines of 30\nbe undertaken in various ways. For example, one could be\nphysically active all 7 d for a defined duration (~20\nminIdj1), whereas another individual may be physically\nactive twice per week at a much longer duration (70 min\neach). In both cases, the cumulative time spent in activity is\nthe same (140 minIwkj1). Varying the intensity of the\nactivity could also influence activity patterns. Using LCA\nmay help highlight strategies for how inactive people may\naccumulate additional physical activity, such as by adopting\na weekend warrior pattern of activity. In addition, LCA may\nallow future analysis to assess whether different patterns of\nphysical activity are associated with improved health\noutcomes.\nnationally representative health survey with a target\npopulation of civilian, noninstitutionalized U.S. citizens.\nCertain populations were oversampled, including low-\nincome persons, Mexican Americans, African Americans,\nconsists of an interview, from which sociodemographic\ninformation is collected, and a physical examination, from\nwhich various biological markers of health are ascertained.\nconsecutive days of accelerometry measurements among\nall ambulatory participants 6 yr old and older who agreed to\nwear the monitor for a week. Written informed consent was\nobtained from all participants.\nMeasuring Physical Activity with Accelerometry\nAccelerometers are small, electronic devices that record\nthe acceleration of change in bodily motion, either in one\nplane or in multidimensions. They are particularly useful in\nmeasuring physical activity because they eliminate the\npotential for recall bias and social desirability bias, and\nthe ActiGraph Model 7164 accelerometer manufactured by\nActiGraph (formerly MTI/CSA) to collect information on\nparticipants` physical activity. This lightweight, uniaxial\nmonitor is a technically reliable instrument, both within and\nacross monitors (18). NHANES used 1-min epochs to\nassign a ``count'' value, a relative measure of the changes in\nmomentum that occurred during these periods, which may\nthen be translated into an estimate of physical activity\nintensity.\nModerate and Vigorous Physical Activity Cut\nPoints Based on Calibration Studies\nThe accelerometer cut point used by this study to\ntranslate the count value into an estimate of moderate-to-\nvigorous physical activity (MVPA) was based on a\nweighted average of published cut points for adults\nNHANES researchers. Each study listed in Table 1 reports\na cut point for MVPA, and these were then weighted by\ntheir sample sizes to arrive at an N-weighted average cut\npoint of 2020 counts per minute for MVPA.

The latter classification was\nmotivated by the physical activity recommendations pub-\nlished by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n(CDC) and the American College of Sports Medicine\n(ACSM) (23), which call for activity to be accumulated in\nbouts of 10 min or more to achieve health benefits. To\nallow for brief periods of rest common during activities--\nfor example, to pause for a water break while playing\nbasketball--the criteria used to define a bout required a\nrunning average of 70% of the counts to be above the cut\npoint. Once the series of accelerometer minutes fell below\n70% of minutes in MVPA, the bout was considered over.\nThus, bout minutes of MVPA were a sum of all minutes of\nMVPA accumulated in these bouts. Those who never\nachieved a 10-min bout were assigned their longest bout\nshorter than 10 min in length. Bout minutes of VPA were\nnot assessed, because too few participants achieved the\nrequired 10 consecutive minutes of VPA.\nImputation of Missing Daily Minutes of MVPA\nand/or VPA\nEven though accelerometer data were present for most\ndays, within each day there may be extended periods of\nzero counts, indicating either a nonwearing period or a\nperiod with no detectable movement. Periods consisting of\n1 h or more of consecutive zeros were treated as missing\ndata. In addition, periods of monitor malfunctioning were\nalso considered missing (e.g., 10 min of identical consec-\nutive nonzero count values). After dividing each day into\nsegments corresponding roughly to nighttime (midnight to\nimputed using the expectation maximization (EM) algo-\nrithm, an iterative imputation technique that uses the values\nof an individual`s other, nonmissing data as predictors to\nestimate the expected value of the total minutes of MVPA/\nVPA for each missing segment of time (4). Imputation was\nonly performed for those participants providing one or more\ndays of complete data, and remaining participants were\nexcluded. Given this strategy, 88.5% of the population had\nat least one time segment imputed on at least 1 d, but 49.7%\nof the population had no time segments imputed for four or\nmore days; overall, this only led to the imputation of 20.6%\nof the total time across all days.\nSelf-Reported Variables\nAge was recorded at the time of the interview, and those\nover 85 yr of age were assigned a truncated value of 85. For\ndescriptive purposes, age was categorized into decades but\nwas left continuous in the final LCA. Gender was recorded\nat the time of interview. Race, ethnicity, and country-of-\norigin questions were recoded into the following categories:\n1) Mexican American, 2) other Hispanic, 3) Non-Hispanic\n(NH) black, 4) NH white, and 5) other race, including\nmultiracial. Education was categorized as less than high\nschool, high school or GED, and more than high school.\nThe poverty income ratio (PIR) was recorded as a ratio of\nthe self-reported family income to the poverty threshold\nbased on family size. The smallest value of 0 indicated no\nfamily income, and the highest value was truncated at 5,\nindicating a family income at least five times the poverty\nthreshold for family size. For descriptive purposes, the\npoverty ratio was categorized into integer values but was\nleft continuous in the final class analysis.\nStatistical Methods\nDescriptive statistics. One thousand two hundred\nthirty-nine participants from our base study population were\nexcluded because of missing covariate information or\nbecause their accelerometer data were missing or invalid\n(no days of adherent wear time). To determine whether the\nanalysis sample differed from the subgroup excluded\nbecause of missing/invalid data, we used chi-square tests\nto compare categorical variables, and we used t-tests to\ncompare the mean of continuous variables. Using SAS\n(Cary, NC) survey procedures, sample weighted means,\nstandard deviations, standard errors, and 25th, 50th, and\n75th percentiles were computed for overall MVPA, bout\nminutes of MVPA, and VPA for each day of the week. To\naccount for item nonresponse, the sampling weights were\n65+), gender, and race (Mexican, NH black, and white/\nLatent class analysis. Employing LCA, we used each\nparticipant`s 7 d of total MVPA/VPA to determine whether\nnatural groupings, or classes, of people exist who tend to\naccumulate their minutes of physical activity in a similar\npattern during the 7 d. Classes can be thought of as groups\nof people who share similar means for the various indicators\nof class--in this case, the 7 d of accumulated MVPA/VPA.\nThe most general probability density function used to define\nthe LCA model is as follows:\nG\npg\nf \u00bdyj~\ng\nOn the left side of this equation, the probability distribution\nfunction defines a distribution for y, the vector of minutes\nof MVPA/VPA across the 7 d, conditioned on K(5), the\nvector of mean MVPA across the 7 d, and 3(5), the\ncovariance matrix for the multivariate normal distribution of\nhttp://www.acsm-msse.org\n632 Official Journal of the American College of Sports Medicine\nCopyright @ 200 by the American College of Sports Medicine.

On the right side, for each underlying class\n(indexed by G), the probability function for the vector y is\nweighted by probability of being in the each of these\nspecific classes. Kg\n(5) is the vector of predicted means for\nthe gth group, and 3g\n(5) is the covariance matrix for the\ngth group. The overall probability distribution for y is, thus,\na probability-weighted sum of each class`s probability\ndensity for the given values of y (7).\nIf the distribution f is assumed to be a multivariate\nnormal distribution with G components, then the probability\ndensity function of an individual in the Gth class is\nf \u00f0yj~g\nwhere yi\nis the vector of minutes of MVPA/VPA across the\nseven times for the ith subject, Kg\n(5) is the vector of\npredicted means across the seven times t for the ith subject,\n(5) is the covariance matrix for the multivariate normal\ndistribution of the 7 d of MVPA/VPA, and |3g\n(5)| is the\ndeterminant of the covariance matrix (7).\nThus, the likelihood function used to maximize this\nmodel for all participants across all class possibilities is\nL \u00bc k\nN\n~\nG\npig\ng\nwhere N indexes the subjects and G indexes the classes,\nand, again, the pi\nweights the probability function for the\ngth class. This likelihood function is identical to the\nmultivariate normal distribution with the addition of the\nprobability-weighted class memberships (2).\nThe probability of being a member of a particular class is\nassigned to an individual according to Bayesian posterior\nprobabilities, using a prior probability proportional to the\nsize of the particular class relative to the entire population.\nThus, the probability of an individual being a member of\nclass g is\nPg\njyi\n\u00bc Pg\njzi\n\u00c2 f \u00bdyi\nj~\ng\nG\nPg\njzi\n\u00c2 f \u00bdyi\nj~\ng\nwhere Pg\nis the prior probability of being in class g,\nconditioned on the covariates. The numerator in this case is\nthe prior probability that subject i belongs to class g,\nmultiplied by the probability density for the observed 7 d\nof MVPA for yi\n, given the predicted means and covariance of\nthe 7 d of MVPA in class g. The denominator is the sum of\nthe probability densities for all possible class memberships\ngiven the individual`s set of indicator values yi\n, weighted by\neach class`s specific prior probability (11). Individuals were\nassigned to the class with their highest posterior probability\nof class membership, referred to as modal allocation.\nSelecting the number of classes. One of the most\ndifficult tasks of LCA is determining the proper number of\nclasses that adequately describe the population without\noverspecifying the number of class groupings, thereby\nlosing the interpretative value of the classes. Several criteria\nwere used to select the appropriate number of classes. We\nfirst used the bootstrap likelihood ratio test (BLRT), which\ncompares the fit of k classes to k j 1 classes, because it\noutperformed the Lo\u00adMendell\u00adRubin likelihood ratio (16)\nin controlling both type I and type II error (22). Second, we\nconsidered a measure referred to as ``entropy'' that is the\naverage highest predicted probability of class membership\n(20). This measure ranges from 0 to 1, with lower entropy\nindicating little confidence that individuals belong in the\nclass with their highest assigned probability, whereas an\nentropy of 1 would indicate certainty that individuals\nbelong in their assigned class. Third, if one or more class\nsizes were too small to be of any public health relevance,\nthe number of classes was reduced. Finally, substantive\nknowledge was used to establish the appropriate number of\nclasses (19). There should be a correspondence between the\nestablished classes and some practical interpretation of what\nthe classes indicate. As Muthen (the author of the MPLUS\nstatistical software) concludes, ``Substantive theory,\nauxiliary information, and practical usefulness will continue\nto have to guide the statistical analysis'' (19).\nSpecifying Variance Estimates\nIn a completely unrestricted model, LCA will estimate a\nseparate variance\u00adcovariance matrix for each class. If the\nnumber of latent classes or the number of variables is large,\nso are the parameters to be estimated. Thus, a typical\nstrategy is to impose restrictions, such as constraining\ncovariances to zero or constraining classes to have the same\nvariance\u00adcovariance matrix (i.e., 3g\nstrained models allow for more parsimonious and stable\nBecause the mean minutes of physical activity for the\nlowest activity class had significantly lower variances than\nin the more active classes, a model that allowed this lowest\nactivity class to have variances that differed from all of the\nother activity classes was selected. For all but the lowest\nactivity class, we allowed weekend and weekday variances\nto differ, but we constrained them to be equal across\nclasses. In this way, we tried to create a parsimonious,\nstable model that still captured some of the complexity of\nthe substantive issues of the analysis.\nThe LCA was performed using MPLUS. The modeling\nwas conducted by requesting a range from 1 to 6 classes a\npriori as the number of group memberships to predict.\nBeyond six classes, the sample size of the more active\nclasses became very small, and the activity patterns during\nthe 7 d became highly unstable. Whereas MPLUS allows\nfor complex survey sampling in conjunction with LCA\nmodeling, the software does not currently account for\nsurvey sampling when computing the BLRT statistic. As\nsuch, this analysis, designed to establish an appropriate\nPATTERNS OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise\nd\nCopyright @ 200 by the American College of Sports Medicine.

In this perspective, the latent classes\n(represented by circles) are derived from the patterns of\nphysical activity across the 7 d of the week (squares indicate\nobserved variables). Simultaneously, the sociodemographic\ncharacteristics are used to help predict who falls into each of\nthe derived activity classes by providing more refined prior\nprobabilities based on the distribution of the sociodemo-\ngraphic characteristics within each class. The Bayesian\nposterior class membership probabilities are then based on\nthese prior probabilities. Because the reporting of the direct\neffects of the sociodemographics on class membership is\ncomplicated and beyond the scope of the current analyses,\nthese results will be presented in future work.\nThis research was approved by the public health institu-\ntional review board of the University of North Carolina at\nChapel Hill.\nRESULTS\nNHANES physical examination. We excluded those under\nage 20, to more clearly focus this research on an adult\nprovided data for the accelerometer portion of the survey.\nFinally, an additional 450 participants were excluded\nbecause of missing covariate data (e.g., education, house-\nhold income) or because they had no days of valid\naccelerometer data with which to impute the other, missing\ndays, leaving a final population of 3802 participants.\nBecause imputation was not performed on the assessment\nof bout minutes of MVPA, only the 3462 participants who\nprovided at least three valid days of data were included in\nthe analysis of bout minutes.\nFIGURE 1--Structural equation model for the prediction of the latent\nclasses based on the minutes of physical activity across the 7 d of\nthe week, with sociodemographic characteristics predicting class\nmembership.\nTABLE 2.

Statistically significant (P G 0.05) differences were\nfound between the categorical distributions of age, education,\nthe poverty index, and race/ethnicity. Whereas the chi-square\ntests for the categorized age and poverty index ratio were\nsignificant, the t-tests for the continuous age (P value = 0.82)\nand poverty index ratio (P value = 0.21) were not. For age,\nthis seems to be attributable to the missing data being\noverrepresented by the younger and older participants in the\nvarious age categories, leading to a similar mean age (50.8 yr\nold for those in the final sample vs 51.0 yr old for those not\nincluded in the final sample). Similarly, for the poverty index,\nthe poorest and richest were least likely to provide complete\ndata, again leading to a similar mean (2.6 for those in the\nfinal sample vs 2.5 for those not included in the final sample).\nThe weighted median minutes of MVPA/VPA and bout\nminutes of MVPA are presented in Table 3 by day of the\nweek. The median number of minutes of overall MVPA\nwhereas the median minutes for overall VPA were zero for all\ndays but Tuesday and Thursday. Bout minutes of MVPA had\na median of 2.0 for all days. The median values were\nsubstantially lower than the mean for all types of physical\nactivity and for all days of the week, suggesting nonnormally\ndistributed data, but the means and standard deviations are\npresented for comparison with other published data.\nThe analyses of the class memberships for the overall\nminutes of MVPA produced a BLRT test statistic that\ndetected a statistically significant improvement in fitness at\nthe G 0.0001 level for all numbers of classes, ranging from 1\nto 6. This indicates that separating the population into six\nclasses was justified on the basis on these criteria. Whereas\nentropy decreased as the number of classes increased, it was\nstill high (0.94) for five and six classes. Because the six-class\nanalysis resulted in very small active classes, we settled on a\nmore parsimonious, five-class model for presentation.\nFigure 2 shows the plot of the mean minutes of total\naccumulated MVPA for five classes. The largest sample-\nweighted percentage of the population fell into the lowest\ntwo classes--roughly 79% of the total population. These\ntwo lowest classes encompassed activity averaging less than\n25 minIdj1 of MVPA. The highest activity class, with a\nmean of 134 min of MVPA per day, only constituted 0.9%\nof the population. This class also demonstrated a high level\nof activity Monday through Friday, with less activity on the\nweekend, with a particularly pronounced decrease on\nSunday. All classes demonstrated this dip on weekends\ncompared with weekends, to varying degrees.\nWhen participants were required to accumulate their\nminutes in bouts, the BLRT test justified as many as six\nclasses at the G 0.0001 level; however, the two most active\nclasses were very sparsely populated (0.4% and 0.5% of the\npopulation). Given this, we settled on five classes, which\nalso allowed for a direct comparison with the overall\nminutes of MVPA. Figure 3 shows the class means for\nTABLE 3.

The\ntwo most active classes represented 0.6% and 4.0% of the\nsample-weighted population, just slightly less than the two\nmost active overall MVPA classes, which had 0.9% and\n4.5% of the population, respectively. Roughly 93.5% of the\nentire population is now classified into the lowest two\ngroups. In addition, for the bout analysis, the second-least-\nactive group now has a mean of 10.3 bout minutes of\nMVPA per day, whereas the second-least-active group in\nthe overall MVPA analysis had a mean of 21.0 min across\nall 7 d. Thus, when only bout minutes are counted, a much\nlarger percentage of the population was classified into the\nlowest groups, and these groups are less active.\nEven though the number of minutes accumulated in bouts\ntends to shift the classes into lower levels of mean activity\nlevel, the general patterns are very similar to the overall\nMVPA analysis, with one exception. A class emerged with\nmoderate levels of physical activity Monday through\nFriday, but with a much higher level of activity on the\nweekend, particularly on Sunday. This class, representing\n1.8% of the population, will be referred to as the ``weekend\nwarrior'' class. The six-class analysis of the overall minutes\nof MVPA (data not shown) also demonstrated this weekend\nwarrior class, although with a smaller percentage of the\nThe VPA analysis did not produce stable results (very\nlarge and very small class sizes), because of the very low\nnumber of participants accumulating any VPA. For exam-\nple, both the three- and four-class VPA analyses produced a\nmost active class with only two and one participants,\nrespectively--a trivial class assignment from both a\nsubstantive and analytical perspective.\nDISCUSSION\nThis modeling represents the first time that objectively\nmeasured physical activity data have been analyzed using\nLCA. Whereas a large portion of the population presented\nlittle activity, a weekend warrior class did emerge, as did a\nhighly active class with less activity on the weekend. We\nare unsure whether these activity patterns were driven by\nspecific types of activity, such as work-related activities.\nIn the analysis of the overall minutes of MVPA, the\nstatistical significance of the BLRT statistic indicated that\nsix classes were justified on the basis of the data. However,\nclass size for the more active groups displayed a small\nsample size, and, as such, the reduced model with only five\nclasses provided a more parsimonious model.\nAn inactive class emerged in overall MVPA that\nrepresented nearly 34% of the entire population. This class\naveraged 5.3 min of MVPA per day. The second-least-\nactive class, with a mean of 21.0 min of MVPA per day,\nalso represents a class of which many, if not most, would\nnot have accumulated 30 min of MPVA on most days of the\nweek. Together, these two groups represent a very large\nproportion of the population with PA levels significantly\nbelow the recommended levels (23). Determining the\nsociodemographic and behavioral characteristics of these\ngroups, to target appropriate physical activity interventions,\ncould lead to significant improvements in activity levels in\nthe United States and, thus, in the overall health of the\nnation.\nThe analysis of the bout minutes of MVPA produced\npatterns similar to those found in the analysis of the overall\nminutes of MVPA, with the important exception of the\nweekend warrior class. From Monday through Friday, this\nclass had significantly less activity than the class above it\n(e.g., the class representing 4.0% of the population), but\nbecause of the significant increase in physical activity of the\nweekend warriors on Saturday and Sunday, and the decrease\nin the other group during this period, their means were\nrelatively similar. The weekend warriors accumulated a daily\nmean of 31.5 min of MVPA, whereas the more active group\nFIGURE 3--Five latent classes: bout minutes of MVPA.

The\nhealth outcomes of these two groups would be interesting to\ncompare, because they represent two populations that both\nachieved the recommended minimum total accumulation of\nMVPA, accumulated their minutes in bouts, and have similar\nmean minutes of MVPA, although they accumulated their\nMVPA minutes in very different manners.\nA recent article using self-report data from NHANES and\nthe BRFSS reports a prevalence of the weekend warrior\npattern in the U.S. population--defined as accumulating Q\n150 min of MVPA on 1 or 2 d in a week--of approximately\n3% and 1%, respectively (13). Our results, although based\non objectively measured accelerometer data, found that a\nsimilar proportion of the population (1.8%) could be\nclassified as weekend warriors according to bout minutes\nof MVPA.\nAnother important difference between bout minutes of\nMVPA and the analysis of overall MVPA minutes is that\nthe more active groups in the bout-minutes analysis had\nsignificantly fewer participants than in the overall MVPA\nanalysis. In fact, the two most active classes in the six-class\nanalysis of bout minutes of MVPA (data not shown) only\ncontained 0.4% and 0.5% of the population. The utility of\nclass assignments with such small populations is an\nimportant consideration in mixture modeling, especially if\nthe analyses include associations between class assignment\nand any outcomes. If the six class levels of bout minutes of\nMVPA were used to simultaneously model health out-\ncomes, the two most active classes would likely not be large\nenough to generate proper associations with the health\noutcomes, particularly if the outcomes were rare.\nThis challenge was made most explicit in the analysis of\nthe VPA. Only 1.4% of all days had 10 min or more of VPA,\nand in 91.1% of all days, participants accumulated less than\n1 min of VPA (data not shown). Because of the highly\nskewed data, the model assumptions generally failed to pro-\nduce results. When classes were successfully modeled, their\nsizes were too small to serve any useful analytic purposes.\nThese low levels of VPA are troubling when considered\nin light of the Healthy People 2010 goals of increasing to\n30% ``the proportion of the adults who engage in vigorous\nphysical activity that promotes the development and\nmaintenance of cardiorespiratory fitness three or more days\nper week for 20 or more minutes per occasion'' (25). Not\nonly does this analysis reflect a much lower percentage of\nthe adult population achieving this goal than desired, it also\nreflects a much lower percentage than the 27.4% of adults\nreported to have met this goal in 2005 by the BRFSS (5). In\nfact, only 23 participants registered 20 min of VPA on at\nleast 3 dIwkj1, representing only 0.9% of the sample-\nweighted total population. Because the BRFSS assessment\nwas based on self-report, this discrepancy could reflect a\nlarge amount of overreporting present in the BRFSS levels.\nIt could also reflect that the cut point for VPA was too high,\nthereby missing many minutes of activity in our population\nthat should have been classified as VPA.\nAlthough we chose LCA as our modeling strategy, other\npossibilities were also considered for the method of\nmodeling classes. Latent class growth analysis (LCGA)\nand growth mixture modeling (GMM) have recently found\nwide application in the social sciences as an effective\nmethod for modeling growth trajectories with longitudinal\ndata (8,10). It was determined, however, that the 7 d of PA,\nalthough contiguous in time, did not constitute a longitudi-\nnal analysis analogous to, for example, the development of\nchildhood obesity according to age in adolescence. This\ndecision was based, in part, on the desire to impose no\nrestrictions on the shape of the classes across 7 d. In other\nwords, we did not want to force the physical activity classes\nto follow a ``growth'' pattern. With this conceptualization,\nphysical activity is more analogous to multiple continuous\nmeasurements of academic ability such as math, verbal,\nspatial, etc., and, as such, it should be modeled with LCA.\nOne question that remains from the LCA is whether any\nrelevant undetected patterns exist that may have been\nmissed by this analysis. For example, although many\npeople work Monday through Friday, others do not;\ntherefore, their ``weekend'' may fall on days other than\nSaturday and Sunday. Other missed groups may include\nactive workers who work weekends but do not work some\ndays during the normal work week, or those who participate\nin leisure-time activity every other day. Future analysis may\nchoose to order days differently, such as by least to most\nactivity, instead of by day of the week, leading to a class\nanalysis that would still capture overall activity but would\nbetter assess the regularity of activity. Depending on the\npurpose of the analysis, this or other strategies may provide\npreferred results.\nSeveral limitations of this work are worth noting. The\nanalysis population had a sociodemographic distribution\nthat differed from those who were excluded because of\nnonresponse or inappropriate data, which, in turn, could\nhave affected the overall patterns found. Another weakness\nwas that, because of the small number of participants\nregistering sufficient levels of VPA, this part of the analysis\nwas unsuccessful. This would have been an interesting\ngroup to assess, and, possibly, with different analytical\ntechniques or a larger study population, such an analysis\nwill be possible in the future. Accelerometers do not capture\nall types of physical activity, particularly static activities\nsuch as raking leaves or riding a bike (17). Therefore,\nalthough the current analyses do not rely on self-report, they\nmay still not reflect the true activity levels of the U.S.\npopulation. Similarly, the cut points for what constitutes\nMVPA and VPA are also sensitive to the types of activities\nbeing done. Changing these cut points would affect the\namount of physical activity that participants were credited\nfor, which, in turn, could have affected the outcomes of the\nlatent class analysis. An analytical weakness worth noting\nwas that the BLRT test statistic was not available with the\nsimultaneous use of the NHANES sample weights, and,\ntherefore, the sample weights were not used for this\nPATTERNS OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise\nd\nCopyright @ 200 by the American College of Sports Medicine.

Adding the sample weights could have affected\nthe final decision for the number of classes as well as the\npattern that these classes assumed.\nThese data represent objectively measured physical activ-\nity from a large, nationally representative sample of the U.S.\npopulation. Physical activity was assessed in several ways, to\nanalyze the class membership patterns for different patterns\nof physical activity. Our results indicate that a very large\nportion of the U.S. population may be classified into patterns\nof physical activity that represent low levels of MVPA\nthroughout the week. The levels of VPA were most\nsurprising, indicating that fewer than 1% of the population\nengaged in VPA for at least 20 min on three or more days\nper week. In addition, a weekend warrior class emerged for\napproximately 2% of the population. The LCA analysis\nprovides a novel approach for assessing patterns of objec-\ntively measured physical activity in epidemiologic studies.\nThis research was supported by the National Institutes of Health\nGrant NIDDK 56350 award to the Department of Nutrition`s Clinical\nNutrition Research Center.\nREFERENCES\n1.
