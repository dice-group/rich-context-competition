BMD of the hip was measured by dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and lateral DXA\npictures of the lumbar and thoracic vertebrae were performed.

After initial ablative treatment with radio-\nactive iodine these patients are treated with L-thyroxine\n(L-T4) in relatively high doses in order to suppress\nendogenous thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)-levels\nand to minimize potential TSH-mediated stimulation\nof tumor growth (1, 2). Adequate monitoring of TSH\nsuppression has become possible since the development\nof second and third generation TSH assays (3, 4). The\ndegree of TSH lowering required to obtain maximal\nsuppression of tumor growth has been subject of dis-\ncussion (5\u00ad8). Most recommendations suggest main-\ntaining TSH levels lower than 0.1 mU/l (1), although\nin recent guidelines TSH levels between 0.1 and\n0.5 mU/l are recommended in case there is no residual\ndisease after 1 year in low risk DTC patients (9). Long-\nterm administration of supraphysiological doses of L-T4\nmay have adverse side-effects. In addition to physical\ndiscomfort, loss of weight, atrial fibrillation and cardiac\ndysfunction (10, 11), the possible negative effects on\nbone mineral density (BMD) and bone remodeling\nresulting in osteopenia and loss of bone strength are\nan important issue (12). Several mechanisms may be\ninvolved in the development of osteopenia secondary\nto suppressive therapy with L-T4 such as direct or indir-\nect stimulation of osteoclast activity by this hormone.\nRecently also direct effects of TSH on bone remodeling\nhave been described (13). TSH inhibits osteoclast for-\nmation and survival and also inhibits osteoblast differ-\nentiation, and is therefore a negative regulator\nof skeletal remodeling. Loss of bone mass is a uniform\nOnline version via www.eje-online.org\nfeature of overt hyperthyroidism; in several studies a\nhistory of overt hyperthyroidism is a risk factor for\nhip fracture later in life (17, 18), and is one of the\ncauses of excess late mortality in previously hyperthyr-\noid patients (19). Symptomatic bone disease is not a\nprominent feature of subclinical hyperthyroidism. How-\never, mild (subclinical) hyperthyroidism in subjects\nwith multinodular goiter was associated with decreased\nforearm bone density, while in postmenopausal women\nwith hyperthyroidism who were treated with methima-\nzole a higher bone density of the distal forearm was\nfound compared with untreated women (20, 21). In\naddition the risk of osteoporotic fractures may be\nincreased (22). Studies in patients with suppressive\nL-T4 therapy for DTC have generated conflicting results.\nSome authors (23\u00ad26) found no evidence of lower\nbone mass in this patient group, while others reported\nmore or less deleterious effects on bone mass (27\u00ad29).\nIn most of these studies however, numbers were small,\npatient selection was not well defined and characteriz-\nation of patients was limited. The aim of our study\nwas to evaluate the impact of long-term suppressive\ntherapy with L-T4 on BMD in a large cohort of well-\ncharacterized patients with DTC, and in the subgroup\nof patients with suppressive therapy for more than 10\nyears. In addition, the prevalence of vertebral fractures\nwas assessed using lateral spine radiographs and mar-\nkers of bone formation and resorption were measured\nin serum.\nSubjects and methods\nPatients\nwith DTC from the outpatient clinic of the University\nHospital Maastricht (Maastricht, The Netherlands)\nwere asked to take part in this cross-sectional study.\nSixty patients agreed to participate. They all had under-\ngone total thyroidectomy and radioactive iodine\nablation and were taking a suppressive dose of L-T4\n(goal of therapy: TSH ,0.05 mU/l) for a median\nperiod of 5 years (range 1\u00ad52 years). In the last 6\nmonths prior to entering this study, TSH-levels were\nin the remaining subjects (mean TSH in the total\nwho had a TSH-level of 6.1 mU/l was excluded from the\nstudy. Therefore complete data are available from 59\npatients; written informed consent was obtained in\nall. To affirm that this patient group was under con-\ntinuous suppressive therapy with L-T4 we checked\nserial serum TSH levels in a group of 32 patients with\nsuppressive dose of L-T4 for .5 years resulting in a\nThe general characteristics of the patients studied are\nsummarized in Table 1. Of the 40 women, 26 were pre-\nmenopausal and 14 postmenopausal. All patients had\nhistologically proven differentiated papillary or follicular\nence parameter: 8\u00ad18 pmol/l) and the mean dose of\nused avitamin D analogue and calcium supplementation\nbecause of postoperative hypoparathyroidism. No\npatient had taken estrogen replacement therapy or\nbisphosphonates. Calcium intake of all patients was\nassessed on the basis of a detailed dietary list. Risk factors\nfor osteoporosis as well as daily activities and exercise\nwere assessed by a validated questionnaire (30), in\nwhich sports, daily and work activities are scored with\na minimum of zero and a maximum of eighteen. None\nof the 25 patients who declined to participate had\nimpaired mobility or symptoms related to vertebral frac-\ntures. Mean age of this group was 49 years and there\nwere seven postmenopausal women in this group.\nBMD and morphometric measurements\nBMD of the hip was measured by dual energy X-ray\nabsorption (DXA, Hologic QDR 4500, Hologic Inc.,\nBedford, MA, USA, NHANES-III reference group). The\nTable 1 Patients characteristics.\nFemale\nPremenopausal Postmenopausal Male\nPostop. hypoparathyroidism 6 1 3\nData are expressed as numbers or means^S.D., numbers if appropriate or median (range).

No data on bone mineral density of the\nlumbar spine were obtained. Standard procedures sup-\nplied by the manufacturer for scanning and analysis\nwere performed. Calibration with the manufacturer's\nspine phantom and quality control analysis was per-\nformed daily. The coefficient of variation for BMD\nmeasurements was 1.0%. A lateral radiograph of the\nspine was made for evaluation of the presence of ver-\ntebral fractures. This was done by one classified and\nexperienced person with morphometry. Anterior,\nmiddle and posterior height were recorded in all ver-\ntebrae from T4 to L4 (if possible). On the basis of\nthese morphometric measurements prevalent vertebral\ndeformity was defined as a reduction of height of 20%\nor more (McCloskey\u00adKanis method; 31).\nLaboratory assays\nAll serum samples were frozen at 220 8C immediately\nafter collection. All analyses were measured within\none badge at the same time to reduce variability.\nSerum TSH was measured using the commercially\navailable delayed enhanced Lantanide fluorescence\nimmunometric assay (DELFIA-method, Perkin Elmer,\nWallac, Turku, Finland), measured on an automatic\nimmunoanalyser of the same manufacturer. Serum\nFT4 was measured using a commercially available\nsolid phase fluoroimmunoassay (DELFIA-method,\nPerkin Elmer, Wallac, Turku, Finland); the normal\nreference range in our laboratory is 8\u00ad18 pmol/l. As\nmarker for bone formation procollagen serum level of\ntype I amino-terminal propeptide (PINP) was measured\nand as marker for bone resorption serum level of car-\nboxy-terminal cross-linked telopeptide of type I collagen\n(ICTP). PINP and ICTP were determined using commer-\ncial RIA kits (Orion Diagnostica Oy, Espoo, Finland). For\nPINP the interassay coefficient of variation was 3.2%,\nthe intraassay CV 2.5% and the lowest detectable con-\ncentration was found to be 0.4 mg/l. For ICTP the inter-\nassay CV was 3.5%, the intraassay CV 2.3% and the\nlowest detectable concentration was found to be lower\nthan 0.1 mg/l. Study samples were compared with\nserum samples from age and sex-matched controls.\nAll gave informed consent. None of them were known\nto have thyroid diseases, and all had normal physical\nexamination and normal results of routine lab\nmeasurements.\nStatistical analysis\nResults are reported as means^S.D. or median and\n(range) where appropriate. T- and Z-scores of the\nfemoral neck and total hip (using NHANES-III) were\ncalculated for the total group, for men, for pre- and\npostmenopausal women, and for a group of patients\nwho received suppressive L-T4 therapy for 10 years or\nmore. Comparison between groups was done using Stu-\ndent t-test with correction for multiple comparisons\namong groups if the data were normally distributed\nand by Kruskal\u00adWallis test if the data were not nor-\nmally distributed. Pearson's correlations were used to\ncalculate the relationship between BMD and duration\nof suppressive therapy. To assess the influence of con-\nfounding factors on the bone mineral density measure-\nments, a multiple regression analysis (stepwise method)\nwas performed with BMD of the total hip (Z-score) as a\ndependent variable and known risk factors for osteo-\nporosis (sex, weight below 60 kg, mother with hip frac-\nture, fractures in previous medical history,\npostmenopausal state, and corticosteroid use), duration\nof suppressive therapy, body mass index (BMI), calcium\nintake, physical activity, L-T4 /kg/day, serum FT4, and\npostoperative hypoparathyroidism as independent vari-\nables. Another multiple regression analysis (stepwise\nmethod) was done with BMD Z-scores as dependent\nvariable and age, weight, L-T4 /kg/day, serum FT4,\nnumber of risk factors and physical activity index as\nindependent variables. Patients in the highest and\nlowest quartile of BMD T-scores were compared on pre-\nsence of risk factors with a chi-square test. All analyses\nconsidered statistically significant.\nResults\nBMD and general characteristics\nRelative to the background population (NHANES refer-\nence group) bone mineral density was not decreased in\nTable 2 Bone mineral density.\nFemale\nPremenopausal Postmenopausal Male\nData are expressed as means^S.D. *for $10 years.\nBMD in patients on suppressive L-thyroxine therapy 25\nwww.eje-online.org\nthe three study groups (Table 2).

These patients did not report earlier fractures\nor pain episodes.

The goal of suppressive L-T4 therapy is to\nTable 3 Risk factors and questionnaires.\nFemale\nPremenopausal Postmenopausal Male\nData are expressed as numbers or means^S.D.\nwww.eje-online.org\nmaintain TSH levels ,0.05 mU/l with a high normal\nFT4. In our study the dose needed to achieve this\nlevel of suppression was 2.2 mg/kg of body weight per\nday, which resulted in FT4 levels of 20% above the\nupper limit of normal. In all studies on this subject in\nwhich a significant bone loss was observed patients\nstudy Kung et al. found significantly lower BMD in\nthe lumbar spine, femoral neck and trochanter\nnopausal women, and their L-T4 dose was 3.3 mg/kg\nof body weight per day (28). The same group followed\na small group of 15 postmenopausal women (3.0 mg\nL-T4/kg of body weight per day) and found a bone\nloss of 6.7% in the total hip after 2 years (32), which\ncould be prevented by calcium supplementation\n(1000 mg/day). Diamond et al. demonstrated a nega-\ntive effect on BMD in both pre- and postmenopausal\n2.8 mg/kg/day and found a significant correlation\nbetween the total cumulative dose of L-T4 and BMD,\nsuggesting that overzealous L-T4 therapy may lead to\nbone loss. Studies in which doses lower than\n2.5 mg/kg body weight per day were used, including\nnot observe any negative effects on BMD. Before the\nintroduction of second and third generation TSH\nassays in the late eighties, it was more difficult to moni-\ntor suppressive L-T4 therapy, because the detection\nlimit was within the normal range. Therefore dosing\nof L-T4 could not be titrated optimally and was prob-\nably unnecessarily high. These high L-T4 doses have\navailable TSH assays are more sensitive and thereby\nallow better dose titration, thereby preventing\nunwanted loss of BMD. The presence of postoperative\nparathyroid dysfunction could also contribute to the\nlow incidence of osteoporosis in our population. Para-\nthyroid hormone (PTH) is generally thought to have a\nnet catabolic effect on bone, including a more pro-\nnounced stimulatory effect on osteoclast than on osteo-\nblast activity (35). Abugassa et al. found a higher bone\nmass in the proximal femur, lumbar spine and distal\nradius in a group of 13 patients treated with calcium\nand/or dihydrotachysterol because of postoperative\nhypoparathyroidism after thyroidectomy for DTC, com-\npared with patients with normal parathyroid function\nafter the same surgical procedure (36). We also found\nin the ten subjects with postsurgical hypoparathyroid-\nism a significantly higher BMD of the femoral neck.\nHowever the total hip measurements showed no differ-\nence between these two groups, and mean Z-scores in\nthe group without hypoparathyroidism were not\nlower than the reference population. A total of five\npatients met the WHO criteria for osteoporosis in the\nmeasurements of total hip, trochanter or femoral\nneck BMD. Our risk factor analysis indicated that this\ngroup could be identified with the known clinical risk\nfactors such as postmenopausal state, mother with\nhip fracture, fracture above 50 years, immobilisation,\ncorticosteroid use and low body weight. Although no\nlong-term effect on BMD was found, a significant\nincrease of bone resorption as measured by serum\nlevels of ICTP was observed. The marker of bone for-\nmation PINP was not altered. Other studies in DTC\npatients with suppressive L-T4 therapy reported an\nincrease in markers of both bone formation and resorp-\ntion. Kung et al. reported increases in hydroxyproline in\nsuggesting increased bone turnover. It is not clear why\nthis change in balance between bone formation and\nbone resorption in our patients did not lead to bone\nloss in the longterm. Perhaps the increase in bone\nresorption is not substantial enough to affect BMD.\nOne might also speculate that the compliance with\nL-T4 therapy might be lower in between hospital\nvisits (37, 38). Also a catch-up effect might have\noccurred in the periods of thyroid hormone withdrawal\nand subsequent hypothyroidism for diagnosis or treat-\nment of recurrent or metastatic disease. Vertebral frac-\nture is a hallmark of osteoporosis. Only one of the\nprevious studies in patients with DTC has evaluated\nprevalent vertebral fractures in a very small group\n(n \u00bc 12) and reported no significant difference in the\nincidence of spinal deformity between TSH-suppressed\nTable 4 Number of patients with clinical risk factors in all 4\nquartiles of BMD (T-scores).\nNo. of patients\nin quartile\nNo. of patients with\n$1 clinical risk factor\nTable 5 Bone markers total group (in serum in mg/l).\nFemale Male\n*P , 0.05 vs age matched controls.
