This study examined whether light to moderate alcohol use is also associated with lower risk of incident\nphysical disability over two 5-year periods in 4,276 noninstitutionalized adults in the United States, aged 50 years\nor older, by using data from 3 waves of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Epidemiologic\nday or 4 per drinking day for women) was associated with reduced risk for incident disability or death over 5 years,\ncompared with abstention (adjusted odds ratio \u00bc 0.77; P \u00bc 0.008). Among survivors, light/moderate drinking was\nassociated with lower risk for incident disability, compared with abstention (adjusted odds ratio \u00bc 0.75;\nP \u00bc 0.009). In stratified analyses, disability risk decreased with light/moderate drinking in a dose-dependent\nfashion in men and women with good or better self-reported health but not in men or women with fair or worse\nself-reported health. Alcohol consumption in moderation might reduce the risk of developing physical disability in\nolder adults in good health but not in those in poor health.\nactivities of daily living; alcohol drinking; longitudinal studies\nAbbreviations: CI, confidence interval; GEE, generalized estimating equations; NHEFS, National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey Epidemiologic Follow-up Study.\nMore than 1 in 5 adults, aged 75 years or older, has some\ndegree of physical disability, defined as difficulty carrying\nout daily activities (1). The link between alcohol consump-\ntion by older adults and the risk of becoming disabled is not\nclear (2), but light to moderate alcohol use by older adults is\nassociated with lower mortality (3, 4), fewer cardiovascular\nevents (5, 6), and less dementia (7) and diabetes (8). Al-\nthough many studies suggest that, compared with absti-\nnence, light to moderate alcohol use is associated with\nless (9\u00ad16), and heavy drinking with more, disability (9,\n17\u00ad20), some studies have found no alcohol\u00addisability as-\nhave been either cross-sectional or limited to a single follow-\nup period, and few adequately controlled for poorer out-\ncomes in those who quit drinking because of poor health\nand for survival bias resulting from mortality associations\nwith alcohol consumption. Many studies were restricted to\nsingle demographic groups; thus, some of the inconsistencies\nbetween studies may reflect true differences in the alcohol\u00ad\ndisability association across demographic and health groups.\nTo address these gaps in the evidence base, we examined\nthe association between alcohol consumption and the devel-\nopment of disability in a nationally representative, prospective\ncohort of US adults aged 50 years or older, using data from\n3 waves of the National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey Epidemiologic Follow-up Study (NHEFS) surveys\nThe NHEFS surveys were a series of 4 follow-up surveys\naamoore@mednet.ucla.edu).\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1971\u00ad\n1975) of a multistage, stratified, probability sample, repre-\nsentative of the US civilian, noninstitutionalized population,\naged 1\u00ad74 years, with oversampling of people aged 65 years\nor older, those living in poverty, and women of childbearing\nage (24). NHEFS surveys collected self-reported informa-\ntion on alcohol use and physical functioning from face-to-\nlater surveys.

We defined abstinence as consuming fewer than 12\ndrinks in the previous year, based on the definition used in\nthe National Health Interview surveys (28). We wanted to\nuse a clinically easy-to-use definition of light to moderate\ndrinking and based our drinking categories on those sug-\ngested by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and\nAlcoholism (28). Accordingly, we calculated the number\nof drinks consumed per week (by multiplying the reported\nusual number of days per week that alcohol was consumed\nwith the reported usual number of drinks per drinking day)\nto classify drinkers in 2 groups: Those who drank less than\n15 drinks per week and less than 5 drinks per drinking day\n(4 per day for women) were classified as light to moderate\ndrinkers, and those who drank 15 or more drinks per week\nor 5 or more drinks per drinking day (4 or more per day for\nwomen) were classified as heavy drinkers (29). Alcohol data\nin 1987 were missing and had to be imputed (by carrying\ncontributing to period 2 analyses). We felt that such an\nimputation was justified because alcohol consumption pat-\nterns were fairly stable: In the 2,088 persons with alcohol\ndata in both periods, 83% were in the same drinking group\n(abstainer, light to moderate drinker, heavy drinker) in the 2\nperiods. Because this imputation could have led to bias in\nour findings, we conducted a sensitivity analysis in which\nwe reran the model after excluding these persons.\nprevious years was ascertained. Using these data, we created\na former drinker indicator variable to identify those who\ndrank in the past (12 or more drinks in a prior year) but\nwere currently abstinent, because older adults who discon-\ntinue drinking often do so because of a health condition (30)\nand are at increased risk for poor outcomes (31).

Participants were defined as having incident dis-\nability over a period if their global disability indicator at the\nend of the period was 1.\nIn exploratory analyses, we also examined disability as\na count of the number of functional domains (range, 0\u00ad8) in\nwhich the response was 1 (some difficulty) or higher, with\nthe count at 1987 as the outcome for the first period and the\ncount at 1992 as the outcome for the second period. By\ndefinition, everyone in the analytical sample had a disability\ncount of zero at the start of the period.\nStatistical analyses\nThe generalized estimating equations (GEE) method\n(34) was used to model the log odds of incident disability\nover a follow-up period as a function of alcohol consump-\ntion (3 categories: abstainer, light to moderate drinker, and\nhol assessment for period 1 and 1987 alcohol assessment\nfor period 2), length of the follow-up period (since actual\nlength of follow-up varied from period 1 to period 2 and\nfrom participant to participant), an indicator for period 1\nversus period 2 (to model a period effect: a secular change\nin disability incidence from one time period to the next),\nand history of former drinking and other relevant covari-\nates measured at the start of the period (NHEFS 1982\u00ad\nperiod 2). We used an exchangeable correlation structure\nwith GEE to account for correlation between repeated ob-\nservations in the same individual (i.e., correlation between\nobservations from periods 1 and 2 in participants who\ncontribute to the analyses for both periods). All analyses\nwere weighted by NHEFS sampling weights to make the\nresults representative of the US civilian, noninstitutional-\nized population aged 50 years or older. The SAS procedure\nGENMOD (35) was used to implement GEE with empir-\nically calculated standard errors by use of the Huber-White\nsandwich correction (36).\nSelection of covariates for inclusion in the model was\nbased on known associations with impairment of physical\nfunction and amount of alcohol consumption. The covari-\nates in the model were as follows: 1) age (a linear term and\na squared term); 2) gender; 3) race (white vs. other than\nwhite); 4) education (less than high school education vs. at\nleast a high school education); 5) employment status (work-\ning vs. other); 6) annual income (less than the median $7,000\nvs. at least $7,000); 7) marital status (married vs. other than\nmarried); 8) current smoking status (smoker vs. nonsmoker);\n9) number of medical conditions (0, 1, 2, or 3 or more)\nreported by the subject (from a list of 13 conditions queried:\nhigh blood pressure, cancer, diabetes, stroke, heart failure/\nheart attack, hip fracture, arthritis, asthma/emphysema, liver\nTable 1.

Comparing the study sample (n \u00bc 4,276) with the\nrest of the cohort who met the age criterion and were not\ndisabled at baseline but were excluded because of missing\ndata (n \u00bc 584), we found that those in the study sample\nwere slightly younger; more likely to be white, more edu-\ncated, married, and working; and more likely to have higher\nincome, to participate in regular exercise, and to report good\nhealth (Table 1).\nabstained from drinking at baseline, 48% of the sample\n(51% of men, 45% of women) were light to moderate\ndrinkers, 10% of the sample (17% of men, 4% of women)\nwere heavy drinkers, and 8% were former drinkers.\nIn addition, 22% percent of the sample either died (7%) or\nbecame disabled (15%) over 5 years: The risk was similar in\nmen and women (P \u00bc 0.8) but substantially higher in those\nwith poor or fair self-reported health (42%) compared with\nthose with excellent, very good, or good self-reported health\n16% developed disability; again, the risk was higher in those\nwith poor or fair self-reported health (31%) than in those\nwith excellent, very good, or good self-reported health\nthe second period, we found that risks were slightly higher\nin the second period when participants were a few years\nAbstainers Light/Moderate Drinkers Heavy Drinkers\nLevel of Alcohol Consumption\n5-Year Risk (%)\nDisability or Death\nDisability Among Survivors\ndisability risk as a function of alcohol consumption level in the US\ncivilian, noninstitutionalized population aged 50 years or older.\nCivilian, Noninstitutionalized Population Aged 50 Years or Older\nAlcohol Consumption\nIncident Disability\nor Death\nIncident Disability\n(Among Survivors)\nOdds Ratio\nInterval\nOdds Ratio\nInterval\na Adjusted for age, gender, race, education, marital status, income, employment, smoking status, regular exercise,\nhistory of heart attack, history of stroke, number of comorbid health conditions, self-rated health, period, length of\nfollow-up, and the following interactions: age 3 gender, marital status 3 gender, and age 3 race.

Because mortality risk was also lowest in\nlight/moderate drinkers (6.0% vs. 8.4% in abstainers and\n6.9% in heavy drinkers), it is possible that alcohol's associ-\nation with the incident disability-or-death outcome is a re-\nflection of the alcohol\u00admortality association. To address this\npossibility, we excluded those who died and examined the\nrisk of incident disability by alcohol consumption level\namong the survivors. In unadjusted analyses, the risk of in-\ncident disability among survivors was also lowest in light-\nabstainers and 15.6% in heavy drinkers) (Figure 3).\nThis association of light/moderate drinking with reduced\ndisability risk persisted after controlling for potential con-\nfounders. Compared with abstainers, light to moderate\ndrinkers had 23% lower adjusted odds for incident disability\nor death and, among survivors, 25% lower adjusted odds for\nincident disability (Table 2). Heavy drinkers and former\ndrinkers had risks similar to those of abstainers in both\nanalyses.

On the basis of these results, we reran\nthe models separately in 4 strata defined by gender and self-\nreported health. To allow for the possibility that benefit or\nharm may accrue at different levels of consumption in the 4\nstrata, we divided the light/moderate drinking category into\n2 subcategories: light drinking, defined as consuming 7 or\nfewer drinks per week; and moderate drinking, defined as\nconsuming more than 7 but fewer than 15 drinks per week.\nThe association between light/moderate drinking and re-\nduced disability risk was seen only in women in good or\nbetter health, and there was a suggestion that there might be\na dose response in both men and women with good or better\nhealth (Table 3).\nTo test for a dose response, we reran the stratified models\nwith number of drinks per week as a continuous predictor,\nafter excluding the heavy drinkers. Each additional drink\nper week was associated with 3% lower odds of disability\nin men in good or better health, 7%\u00ad8% lower odds in\nwomen in good or better health, and a statistically non-\nsignificant 5%\u00ad10% greater odds in those in fair or worse\nhealth (Table 3). We next added a quadratic term (square of\nthe number of drinks per week) to the models to test for\nnonlinearity in the dose response. The squared term did not\nmake significant contributions to the associations, except in\nwomen in good or better health, where it made a significant,\npositive contribution (P \u00bc 0.047) to the model for incident\ndisability or death, implying that the benefit in healthy\nwomen peaks at around 9 drinks per week (Figure 4). To\nexamine the nature of the dose effect in heavy drinkers, we\nreran the stratified models in heavy drinkers, once with num-\nber of drinks per week as continuous predictor and once with\nnumber of drinks per drinking day as predictor. Among those\nin fair or worse health, only 13 women and 63 men were\nheavy drinkers; hence, these analyses were conducted only\nIn both sexes, neither number of drinks per week nor number\nof drinks per drinking day had a significant association with\nincident disability risk (P > 0.35 for all).\nIn exploratory analyses (in survivors), we reran the strat-\nified models using the follow-up disability count score\n(range, 0\u00ad8) as outcome and Poisson regression (with GEE\nto account for correlation of data between period 1 and period\n2). Results were similar to the results from the main models.\nLight to moderate drinking was beneficial only in men and\nwomen in good or better health. Among the women in good\nor better health, compared with abstainers, the follow-up\ndisability count score was 40% (95% confidence interval\n88) lower in moderate drinkers. Among those who were\nnot heavy drinkers, each additional drink per week was asso-\nwomen in good or better health and 4% (95% CI: 0, 8) lower\ndisability scores in men in good or better health. There were\nno quadratic dose effects in either group.\nDISCUSSION\nIn a population-based sample of nondisabled Americans\naged 50 years or older, we observed that light and moderate\ndrinkers were less likely to become disabled than abstainers.\nHowever, the benefits from light/moderate drinking were\nseen only in men and women in good, very good, or excel-\nlent self-reported health. In these individuals, there was\na dose response, where disability risk reduction was larger\nat higher levels of drinking, up to 9 drinks per week in\nwomen and 15 drinks per week in men. Although a causal\nrelation between alcohol consumption and disability pre-\nvention cannot be directly inferred from an observational\nstudy, the suggestion of a dose response strengthens the\nevidence for a causal relation. One potential causal pathway\nmight be through reduction in cardiovascular events (37,\n38). Stroke is the chronic condition that has the largest\nimpact on disability-free survival in old age (39); because\nmoderate alcohol use is known to protect against cerebro-\nvascular disease (6), it is possible that some of the disability\nrisk prevention from light/moderate alcohol consumption\ncomes from preventing strokes. However, adjustment for\nstroke in our analyses did not alter our findings, suggesting\nresidual confounding by severity of stroke (which we could\nnot adjust for) and/or subclinical cardiovascular disease.\nThe associations between light/moderate drinking and re-\nduced disability risk were stronger in women than in men.\nThere are several possible reasons for this finding, including\ngender differences in binge drinking (40) and the pace of\nalcohol consumption (41). Moreover, alcohol consumption\ndeclines (with aging) faster in men than in women (42); this\nNo. of Drinks Per Week\nRelative Odds, Compared\nWith Abstainers\nLinear Model\nQuadratic Model\ncivilian, noninstitutionalized women aged 50 years or older in self-\nreported good, very good, or excellent health, who are not heavy\ndrinkers, as a function of number of drinks per week.\ncould have led to more confounding by the ill effects of past\nheavy drinking in men than in women.\nLight to moderate alcohol consumption appears to have\ndisability prevention benefits only in men and women in\nrelatively good health. It is possible that those who report\npoor health have progressed too far on the pathway to dis-\nability to accrue benefits from alcohol consumption and that\nalcohol consumption may even be deleterious for them. We\nfound that even light/moderate consumption may be asso-\nciated with increased disability risk in those in poor or fair\nself-reported health. Alcohol's interactions with medica-\ntions may be responsible for increased disability risk in\nthese individuals (43). Further studies are needed to exam-\nine if people with certain specific health conditions or on\nspecific medications are more prone to disability from alco-\nhol consumption.\nUnlike other studies (31), this study did not find increased\nrisk for incident disability in former drinkers compared with\nlifelong abstainers. People who quit drinking often do so for\nhealth-related concerns (30). The increased risks in these\nindividuals might be secondary to their underlying health\nconditions. In our study, we controlled for health conditions\nby including a count of medical conditions and indicators of\nstroke, heart attack, and self-reported health. With these\ncontrols, former drinkers were not at increased risk for in-\ncident disability.\nOur study had some limitations. Like other epidemiologic\nstudies of the effects of alcohol consumption on health out-\ncomes, this study also relied on participants' reports of cur-\nrent and past consumption levels. However, a tendency in\nabstainers and very light drinkers to overreport and in heavy\ndrinkers to underreport their consumption would only have\nreduced the strength of the estimated association between\nlight/moderate drinking and incident disability risk. Disabil-\nity status was also obtained from self-report, but the validity\nof self-reported disability data has been well established\n(44, 45). Levels of both alcohol consumption and disability\nwere evaluated at discrete time points in our study; thus, we\ndid not capture historical information about levels of drink-\ning and did not distinguish between transient and permanent\nforms of disability. Like those in other prospective cohort\nstudies, the participants in this study are likely to be health-\nier and from higher socioeconomic strata than the general\npopulation. The use of NHEFS sampling weights in our\nanalyses at least partially compensates for such differences\nin sampling probability and makes our findings representa-\ntive of the general population.\nIn conclusion, this large, nationally representative,\nprospective cohort study of alcohol consumption as a pre-\ndictor of incident disability found that light/moderate\ndrinking is associated with 33%\u00ad65% reduction overall\n(and 3%\u00ad8% reduction with each additional drink per week)\nin the odds of incident disability in men and women in good\nself-reported health, as well as possibly increased odds of\nincident disability in men and women in poor self-reported\nhealth. Further research is needed to discover the biologic\nunderpinnings of this association, to understand why\nalcohol's benefits are seen only in those in good health,\nand to determine whether and how definitions of harmful\ndrinking have to be tailored to an individual's overall health,\nspecific comorbidities and medications used, and social\ncircumstances.\n"
