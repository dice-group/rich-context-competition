We describe how paid and unpaid home care hours received by older unmarried Americans change in\nresponse to disability dynamics. We test whether responses to disability declines and improvements are symmetric; that is,\nwe test whether reductions in care hours that are due to disability improvements are of similar magnitude to increases in\ncare hours that are due to disability declines.\nMethods. Using a national sample of older unmarried Americans, we examine changes in total hours, paid hours, and\nunpaid hours of care in response to declines and improvements in personal care (activities of daily living, or ADLs) and\nroutine care (instrumental ADLs, or IADLs) disability. We model changes in the total hours of care received in the past\nmonth and jointly model changes in unpaid and paid hours, using Tobit models.\nResults. Changes in the total hours of care received respond to both increases and decreases in the count of ADL\nlimitations and appear close to symmetric. In contrast, responses to IADL disability dynamics appear to be far less\nsymmetric: Although increases in the count of IADL limitations are met with substantial increases in the total hours of\ncare, decreases are not met with correspondingly large declines in care. The same general pattern is found for unpaid and\npaid care, and for Medicaid-funded home care.\nDiscussion. Disability and care are not static constructs in old age. Older unmarried persons experience worsening,\nstabilizing, and recovery of function, and their care hours change accordingly. Evaluations of home care programs must be\ncognizant of such dynamic realities.\nTHE cost of providing home-based long-term-care services\nto older Americans with disabilities reached $37 billion in\n(Congressional Budget Office, 1999). There are also substantial\nuncompensated hidden costs associated with the many hours of\n``informal'' care provided primarily by family members of per-\nsons with chronic disabilities (Ettner, 1996). Although married\nolder persons with disabilities most often rely on a spouse\nto provide care (Spillman & Pezzin, 2000), those without a\nspouse are subject to a more fragmented--and potentially less\nstable--array of care choices.\nConservative projections suggest the number of older\npersons with disabilities could exceed 12 million by the year\npotential family caregivers is also projected, in part because\nof fertility declines and increasing demands from work (Wolf,\n2001). Thus, despite studies suggesting recent improvements in\nold-age functioning (Freedman, Martin, & Schoeni, 2002), the\nanticipated growth in the sheer number of older Americans with\ndisabilities who require formal home care services remains\na policy concern.\nIn light of these demographic trends, policy makers have\nshown interest in restraining the future growth in public spend-\ning for home-based care while supporting America's families.\nAt the federal level, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, for\nexample, shifted the Medicare home health benefit from a\ncost-based to prospective payment system, thereby providing\nincentives to contain the length of time older Americans with\ndisabilities receive home care services for medical conditions.\nOther recent federal initiatives have aimed to expand family-\nprovided support through mechanisms such as tax deductions\nand respite programs (U.S. Department of Health and Human\nServices, 2001). States are also concerned about growth in long-\nterm-care expenditures under the Medicaid program, and many\nhave adopted cost-containment strategies to curb home care\nRelated to these policy initiatives are discussions of ap-\npropriate targeting of home care services to those in need (Kane,\n1999). Evaluations of targeting often rely on cross-sectional\nevidence comparing the characteristics of those receiving home\ncare services with those who do not. Such exercises ignore the\ninherently dynamic underpinnings of both the disablement pro-\ncess and care decisions. Here we provide additional insight into\ndiscussions of home care service allocation by considering\nthe care process from a more dynamic perspective and by con-\nsidering both paid and unpaid sources of care simultaneously.\nIn this context, effective targeting implies not only getting\npeople with few informal resources the services they need when\nthey acquire a disability, but also increasing such services for\nthose whose disability worsens and reducing such services for\nthose who improve.\nThe framework we develop here is unique in that it allows\nus to explore whether responses to disability declines and\nimprovements are symmetric; that is, we test whether reductions\nin response to disability improvements are of similar magnitude\nto increases in response to disability declines. In doing so we\ndistinguish between paid and unpaid hours and between re-\nsponses to changes in personal care (e.g., difficulty bathing,\nJournal of Gerontology: SOCIAL SCIENCES Copyright 2004 by The Gerontological Society of America\ndressing, or eating) and routine care (e.g., difficulty managing\nmoney, shopping, or using the telephone). We also identify\ncircumstances under which services remain in place despite\nimprovements in functioning. Our analysis focuses on a sub-\ngroup of older persons most likely to experience shifts in care:\nthose who are unmarried.\nBackground\nStudies of paid and unpaid care for elderly persons cut across\nseveral disciplines. Policy makers have been largely concerned\nwith recent increases in the utilization of paid care and in\nminimizing substitution of formal for unpaid family-provided\ncare. To assist the medical community in targeting high-risk\npatients, epidemiologists and clinical researchers have identi-\nfied risk factors associated with paid care use. Demographers\nhave focused on the role of kin availability in constraining the\nchoice of living and care arrangements. Social gerontologists\nhave investigated family caregiving and the burdens associated\nwith providing care to frail older relatives. Finally, economists\nhave focused on the trade-offs between caregiving and work\nand on the role of market factors in the demand for care.\nDespite the widespread interest in personal care arrange-\nments, the literature is limited in two respects. First, most studies\nfocus on care arrangements at a point in time and thus provide\nlimited insight into the dynamic process driving changes in care\narrangements for an individual. Second, most studies focus on\nthe structure of care--for example, whether an older person\nwith a disability uses community-based or institutional care,\nor whether the care is provided by an unpaid provider, paid\nprovider, or some combination thereof--rather than the volume\nof care provided under a given the arrangement. However, the\nvolume of service use, both in total and by type of provider, is\nprobably the most crucial factor in calculating the costs of\nproviding care to older persons with disabilities.\nAlthough the literature on disability trajectories is growing\n(for a review see Wolinsky, Stump, Callahan, & Johnson,\n1996), there are only a few studies using measures of changes\nin disability to predict care use (Langa, Chernew, Kabeto, &\nstudies show that increases in limitations in activities of daily\nliving (ADLs) and in instrumental ADLs (IADLs) result in\na greater tendency to live with others and to use paid care or\na ``mixed'' (paid and unpaid) care network. Studies of changes\nin community-based care have also been few in number. A\nstudy by Miller and colleagues (1994), using a national sample\nof elderly persons with chronic disability, suggests that care\ntransitions could be quite frequent even over short periods of\ntime. The authors found that, over a 2-year period, sources of\ncare changed for at least 20% of persons initially receiving\nunpaid care and for over 50% of persons initially receiving\nboth unpaid and paid care. Similarly, using a sample of 476\ncaregivers in Wisconsin, Seltzer and Li (2000) found that 36%\nof women with an elderly husband or father experienced a\ntransition to or from a caregiving role over a 3-year period.\nWe know of only one past study that has included disability\nchanges to predict changes in home care hours. Using the first\nand second waves of the Asset and Health Dynamics of the\nOldest Old (AHEAD) study, Langa and colleagues (2001) found\nlarge increases in weekly hours of paid home care use between\npositively related to these changes. However, the authors\nignored potentially important changes between the first and\nsecond waves of AHEAD in the survey questions used to obtain\nhours of care. Moreover, changes in ADLs and IADLs were\nincluded in their model as continuous variables ranging from\u00ff6\nto \u00fe6 and from \u00ff5 to \u00fe5, respectively. This specification\nassumed symmetric responses; that is, increases in care hours in\nresponse to one additional ADL limitation were assumed to be\nequivalent to decreases in care hours in response to one fewer\nlimitation. In addition, rather than considering in a single\nframework both unpaid and paid hours of care, the authors\nmodeled only the receipt of paid home care and included\npatterns of unpaid home care as predictors of paid care, an\napproach that ignores the possibility that the two may influence\none another.\nMany behavioral phenomena exhibit asymmetric responses\nto opposing external forces. For example, in tight labor markets\nwages tend to rise, yet during recessions they may be ``sticky''\ndownward, failing to fall. Similarly, individual decision making\nseems to exhibit asymmetric reactions to a given level of risk\nattached to potential gains compared with potential losses.\nThere are several reasons to anticipate that the hours of care\nused by older persons with disabilities will, as well, respond\ndifferently to comparably large declines and improvements in\nfunctional levels, other things being equal. This is particularly\nlikely for unpaid IADL services provided by family mem-\nbers, which have substantial social and affective components.\nTime-use patterns connected to shared meals, housekeeping,\nor provision of transportation that are established in times of\ncare needs may be maintained or only partly reduced if the\ncare recipient recovers the capacity for self-care. If an older\nparent moves in with a child in response to ADL needs, then\nthe coresidence may be maintained despite later recovery of\nfunction. Coresidence, in turn, fosters the provision of IADL\nassistance even if that assistance is not strictly necessary. Some\nstudies have also documented some degree of unpaid ADL\nassistance received by older people who, according to their self-\nreported accounts, do not ``need'' such help (Bootsma-van der\nRegarding paid care, especially to deal with ADL needs, we\nwould expect third-party payers for such services to enforce\ndeclines in service levels in response to functional improve-\nment and, accordingly, reduced levels of assessed need. How-\never, the monitoring of changing care needs may be imperfect,\noccurring at large or irregularly spaced time intervals. Discre-\ntion on the part of case managers and home health aides can\nalso lead to situations in which clients' functioning improves\nbut services are not reduced (Jenkins, 1997). Thus, both un-\npaid and paid care services may respond asymmetrically to\nchanges in the severity of disability. The responses exhibited\nby each type of care may differ from each other as well. We\ndescribe our empirical approach to these issues in the para-\ngraphs that follow.\nMETHODS\nData\nWe use the first three waves of the AHEAD study, conducted\nby the Institute for Social Research at the University of\nMichigan. The AHEAD study is a national prospective panel\nsurvey of initially noninstitutionalized persons born in 1923 or\nearlier. The purpose of the study is to provide an understanding\nof the implications of health dynamics in old age for transitions\nin economic well-being, for changes in family and marital\nstatus, and for reliance on public and private support systems.\nHouseholds were selected on the basis of a multistage area\nprobability sample plan, with oversampling of Blacks,\nHispanics, and Florida residents. For details, see Soldo, Hurd,\nstudy, the AHEAD study was integrated with its parent project,\nthe Health and Retirement Study (HRS).\nThe AHEAD study is uniquely suited to examine questions\nof how care arrangements are put into place over time. At each\nAHEAD collects data on care arrangements, health status and\ntransitions, kin networks, familial resources, and demographic\ncharacteristics. Although question changes preclude compar-\nAHEAD95 and HRS98 waves obtained information on dis-\nability and hours of care provided by nonspousal helpers in an\nidentical fashion.\nWe restrict our analysis to those who were alive and un-\nmarried at all three waves and who reported difficulty in 1995\nwith one or more out of six ADLs or with one or more out of\nfive IADLs. We exclude those living in an institution in 1995 or\n1998 in order to focus our analysis on home- and community-\nbased care. Our final sample size consists of 746 unmarried\ncommunity-based older Americans who report difficulty with\none or more ADL or IADL activities. Sample characteristics\nare provided in Table 1. To compensate for differential prob-\nabilities of selection, we base estimates on weighted data.\nModeling Approach\nWe use the change score regression approach commonly\nfound in the evaluation literature (Allison, 1990). In effect, we\nview changes in care needs, whether improvements or declines\nand whether for ADL or IADL services, as ``treatments'' and\nthe associated changes in care hours as ``responses'' to them. In\norder to isolate the effect of disability dynamics on changes in\nthe volume of care, we model changes in the hours of care\nWe first address hypotheses about the effect of disability\ntransitions on the total volume (measured in hours) received by\nolder persons with disabilities. Because we measured hours of\ncare in a continuous fashion by using hours of care per month,\ndenoted \u00c1Vi\nt\u00ff1,t--was also a continuous variable, which could\ntake on both positive and negative values. In the population, the\ndistribution of changes in care hours is, in effect, unbounded.\nAt the individual level, however, two constraints on estimation\nmust be noted. For those receiving no care at t \u00ff 1 (i.e., for\nthose with Vi\nt\u00ff1,t must be greater than or equal to\n0. For individuals with Vi\nt\u00ff1 . 0, declines cannot exceed Vi\n(i.e., \u00c1Vi\nt\u00ff1,t  \u00ffVi\nt\u00ff1). Such constraints manifest themselves\nin the data as heaping at \u00ffVi\nt\u00ff1, a problem also common to the\nanalysis of cross-sectional measures of hours. This problem has\nbeen dealt with in the unpaid care literature (see, e.g., Wolf,\nFreedman, & Soldo, 1997) by use of a Tobit specification.\nThe two constraints described reduce to a single constraint:\nChanges in care hours are censored at\u00ffV t\u00ff1. We therefore used\na Tobit model of changes in hours with individual-specific\ncensoring at \u00ffVi\nt\u00ff1. Because in the population care-hours\nresponses are unbounded, as explained herein, the Tobit index\nfunction produces coefficients that allow for a test of symmetry.\nSymmetry exists if the effect of declines in disability on the\ntotal hours of care is the opposite of the effect of improvements\nin disability. That is, symmetry exists if the coefficient on\na variable representing a given amount of functional improve-\nment equals the negative of the coefficient on another variable\nrepresenting the same amount of functional decline. To test\nfor symmetry in unpaid and paid care hours, we extended the\nanalysis by jointly modeling changes in the number of formal\nTable 1.

Respondents were asked to provide information\nabout caregivers by using three sets of questions, which were\nidentical in both years. The first set of questions asked about\nany difficulty with ADLs (walking, bathing, dressing, eating,\ntransferring, or toileting), the second set asked about any\ndifficulty with IADLs (preparing meals, taking medicine, using\nthe telephone, or shopping), and the third set (considered an\nIADL for our purposes) focused on difficulty with a single task:\nmoney management.\nThe same general approach was taken for each of the three\nsets of activities. For ADL activities, for example, respondents\nwere first asked whether they had any difficulty, and, if so,\nwhether someone helps, with each of the specific ADL items.\nAfter completing all six ADL items, respondents reporting that\nsomeone helps them with one or more activities were then\nasked to identify caregivers who helped in the past month with\nthose activities for which they reported receiving help. This pro-\ncess was repeated for IADL and money management activities.\nAfter caregivers were identified for the three sets of activities,\nrespondents were asked, regarding each helper (but excluding\nspouses and employees of nursing homes), how many days per\nweek each caregiver provided help in the past month, how\nmany hours per day that caregiver usually helped, the gender of\nthe caregiver, and whether the helper was paid.\nTo remain consistent with the monthly reference period in\nthe questions about hours of care, we calculated each care-\ngiver's hours of care in the past month by multiplying for each\nhelper the reported number of hours per day by the reported\nnumber of days per week, times 52 and then divided by 12.\nSumming the hours for each caregiver, we calculated the total\nhours of care received in the past month. We also summed hours\nprovided by unpaid caregivers to yield unpaid hours in the past\nmonth and summed hours provided by paid caregivers to yield\npaid hours in the past month.\nIn a small number of cases, the hours of care were in-\ncomplete or missing entirely for a respondent because of\nmissing information on one or more caregivers. For 42\ninformation on hours per day or hours of care in the past month\nfor one or more helpers. We assigned to caregivers with\nmissing information the average number of hours of care\nprovided by caregivers of the same type (male nonagency,\nfemale nonagency, or agency based) in networks with the same\n3 respondents in 1998, we also imputed probabilistically\nwhether the caregiver was paid, based on the type of helper and\nthe size of the network.\nPredictors\nThe main predictors of interest are changes in the disability\nlevel of respondents. For both ADLs and IADLs, we included\ncategorical indicators of the change in the count of limitations\nand decreases of 1 or of 2 or more compared with an omitted\ncategory of no change). As a further control for one's place in the\ndisability continuum, we also included continuous variables\nindicating the number of each type of activity limitation in 1995.\nHours of care can respond to many factors besides changes\nin disability: Unpaid caregivers can experience events in other\nlife domains that impinge on their availability; programmatic\neligibility for paid services can be achieved or exhausted; pri-\nvate insurance stop-loss thresholds can be crossed; and so on.\nAccordingly, in all models we included a number of variables\nthought to reflect the preferences of older individuals with\ndisabilities and their families and shown to be related to care\nhours in past studies. These covariates include age (Kemper,\nstudies have shown that hours received of both informal and\nformal care are influenced by the number of children that\na person has, with different effects for sons and daughters\npotential supply of informal care hours was represented by a\nseries of variables indicating the number of sons and daughters\nthat respondents had. We also explored the effects of the num-\nber of sons-in-law and daughters-in-law but found no substantial\neffect. Although they were available in the AHEAD study, we\nomitted measures of coresidence with a child and distance to\nnearest child in our models, because decisions about living\narrangements are likely to be made jointly with care arrange-\nments (Pezzin, Kemper, & Reschovsky, 1996; Pezzin & Schone,\n1999). Financial resources of the respondent were classified into\nlow, medium, and high on the basis of 1993 income and liquid\nasset quintiles for the entire AHEAD sample.\nFinally, the implications of asymmetric responses for policy\nmakers will vary depending on the source of care. If unpaid\ncaregivers demonstrate ``sticky'' behavior to improvements\nin health, policy makers may be less apt to intervene than if\nMedicaid providers do so. We investigated the source of pay-\nment for caregivers providing such services in two ways.\nAlthough sample sizes were too small to estimate complex\nmodels, we descriptively examine the mean changes in hours of\ncare by source of payment for a caregiver (completely out of\npocket vs. insured in part or in full) and mean changes in\nunpaid and paid hours for those reporting Medicaid coverage.\nRESULTS\nDisability and Care Hour Dynamics\nWithin this cohort of unmarried older Americans with ADL\nor IADL limitations, average care hours increased by ap-\nproximately 30 hr over the 3-year period, from 77 hr/month\ncare hours increased; they were on average 12 and 17 hr higher\nAlso consistent with much of the cross-sectional literature,\ntotal, unpaid, and paid hours of care were generally higher at\nmore severe disability levels. The exception to this pattern was\nfound among unmarried older persons with no ADL limitations\n(i.e., with IADL limitations only), a group receiving more\nunpaid care hours that those with one or two ADL limitations.\nThe largest changes were observed for those with one or two\nADLs or with three or more IADLs at baseline.\nA more dynamic perspective is provided in Table 3, in which\nwe present mean hours of care in 1995 and changes between\ning the same time interval. In this and remaining tables, ``\u00ff2\nor more'' indicates declines of two or more in the count of\nlimitations (e.g., fewer activity limitations), whereas ``\u00fe2 or\nmore'' indicates increases of two or more in the count of limita-\ntions (e.g., more activity limitations).\nThe descriptive statistics in Table 3 suggest a highly\nasymmetric relationship between disability and care dynamics.\nThose who experienced declines of two or more in the count\nof ADL limitations began on average with 81 hr of care, the\nbulk of which was in unpaid hours. This group reduced their\ntotal hours of care by only approximately 20 hr per month,\nwith reductions stemming from declines in unpaid hours. Con-\nversely, those who experienced an increase of two or more\nin the count of ADL limitations doubled their care hours from\nsplit between paid and unpaid sources.\nA similar pattern was observed with respect to IADL tasks.\nIn response to declines of two or more in the count of IADL\nlimitations, older unmarried persons decreased their care hours\nbetween unpaid and paid care hours, with unpaid care hours\ndeclining by nearly one third and paid care hours increasing by\n16 hr per month. Increases of two or more in the count of IADL\nlimitations were met with substantial increases in total hours,\nof the additional hours came from unpaid sources (86 additional\nunpaid vs. 58 additional paid hours).\nWe also find asymmetric care dynamics when we restrict the\nanalysis to those reporting Medicaid coverage. As shown in\nTable 4, although sample sizes are small for some cells, hours\nprovided by paid caregivers increase dramatically in response\nto increases of two or more in the count of IADL limitations\n(\u00fe168 hr) but do not change appreciably in response to declines\nin the count of IADL limitations.\nAre responses of total hours of care to ADL and IADL\ndynamics symmetric?--In the first few columns of Table 5,\nwe present the effects of ADL and IADL disability changes\ncontrolling for preferences, resources, opportunities for care,\nand baseline ADL and IADL disability. We also present tests of\nsymmetry; that is, we compare the coefficients, for example, for\n``\u00fe2 or more ADLs'' and ``\u00ff2 or more ADLs.'' Statistically\nsignificant departures from the null hypothesis of b\u00c1D\n\u00bc\u00ffb\u00ff\u00c1D\nindicate asymmetric responses. (For other model coefficients,\nsee the first column of Table 6.)\nChange in total care hours respond to both increases and\ndecreases in the count of ADL limitations. For those persons\nexperiencing large disability changes (e.g., increases or\ndecreases of two or more in the count of ADL limitations),\nresponses appear close to symmetric (e.g., b \u00bc\u00ff113 for those\nexperiencing declines in the count and b \u00bc 87 for those experi-\nTable 2.

Formal tests indicate that the null hypothesis\nof symmetry cannot be rejected at even the p , .10 level.\nIn contrast, responses to IADL disability dynamics appear to\nbe far less symmetric. Although increases in the count of IADL\nlimitations lead to substantial increases in the total hours of care\n(e.g., b \u00bc 261 for ``\u00fe2 or more''), comparable decreases in\nthe count are not followed by correspondingly large declines\nin hours (e.g., b \u00bc \u00ff67 for ``\u00ff2 or more''). In other words,\nresponses to declines in IADL functioning are nearly 3 times\nthe volume of responses to improvements (p , .05 for test of\nsymmetry).\nAre unpaid and paid care responses symmetric?--In the last\ntwo columns of Table 5, we present coefficients on changes in\nADL and IADL limitations from the bivariate Tobit models,\nin which changes in hours of unpaid and paid care are\njointly estimated. Remaining coefficients are presented in the\nlast two columns of Table 6. We find that unpaid care\nhours demonstrate a similar pattern to total care hours. That is,\nunpaid care hours appear to respond more to declines than to\nincreases in the count of ADL limitations, but we cannot reject\na formal test of symmetry even at p , .10. However, unpaid\nhours have an asymmetric response to a change of one in the\ncount of IADLs. Paid hours display the same general pattern\nof symmetry with respect to ADL disability dynamics, but\nresponses to IADL dynamics appear asymmetric. In particular,\npaid care hours increase with an increase of two or more in the\ncount of IADL limitations but do not decline in response to\ndeclines of two or more in the count. Because of the small\nnumbers of cases experiencing declines of two or more in the\ncount of IADL limitations, statistical tests fail to reject the null\nhypothesis of symmetry.\nDISCUSSION\nWe have provided a dynamic perspective on the hours of\ncare provided to older unmarried persons with disabilities who\nlive in the community. We found, like Spillman and Pezzin\nand unpaid care hours received by older unmarried Americans\nwith disabilities increased during the 1990s. Unlike previous\nanalyses, however, we find that for this population, care hours\nrespond in different ways to shifts in ADL and IADL disability.\nResponses to ADL dynamics are relatively symmetric--\nincreasing as disability worsens and decreasing as recovery\nensues. In contrast, responses to IADL needs appear to be\nasymmetric. Unpaid care hours respond to both increases and\ndecrease in the number of IADL limitations, but more so to the\nformer than the latter. Paid care hours increase in response to\ndeclines in IADL functioning but do not decrease in response to\nIADL improvements. That is, once a paid arrangement has been\nput into place to meet the need for preparing meals, taking\nmedicine, using the telephone, shopping, or managing money,\nthe care remains in place despite improvements in ability.\nOur study is limited in three important respects. First, the\nmeasure of disability dynamics we adopted has some inherent\ndisadvantages. Perhaps most important, the measure does not\ncapture improvements or declines in difficulty with specific\nactivities, thus raising the possibility that asymmetric responses\nsimply reflect declines and improvements in fundamentally\ndifferent areas of functioning. We investigated whether declines\nin IADL functioning were more likely than improvements in\nIADL functioning to involve time-consuming activities (e.g.,\nshopping) and found that this is not the case. We also found\nfew statistically significant relationships between changes in\ndifficulty with specific activities and in hours of care received.\nWe therefore represented disability trajectories with changes in\nthe number of activity limitations. Our measure of disability\nalso does not capture changes in the degree of difficulty with\na given activity over time. Indeed, answers to questions about\ndifficulty may in part reflect getting help, because older un-\nmarried persons were not instructed whether to consider help\nor equipment when answering questions about having difficulty\nwith a given activity. At least one study suggests, however, that\nthe questions used to elicit information about personal care are\na reasonable indication of underlying difficulty without help or\nspecial equipment, if used (Freedman, 2000).\nSecond, because of data limitations, our analysis could not\naddress how married older persons balance paid and unpaid\ncare over time. Other studies suggest married older persons are\nless likely to use paid home care (Katz, Kabeto, & Langa, 2000;\nTable 5.

Until that time, it\nremains unclear how married older persons handle declines in\nhealth and what, if any, the repercussions are for joint care\ndecisions.\nThird, we were unable to control for the changing policy and\nprice regimes for home care that occurred during this period.\nThe paid home care hours recorded in our data reflect services\nprovided by a variety of programs, including Medicaid-funded\nhome health and personal care services, personal care covered\nthrough Medicare's home health benefit, and services re-\nimbursed by private insurance and those paid out of pocket.\nThese different programs are subject to very different supply,\nreimbursement, and regulatory provisions that may have\nMedicare home health benefit, for example, which represent an\nunknown proportion of the paid services in our data, increased\nexperienced contractions of approximately the same magnitude\ntions have been attributed in part to the implementation of the\nBalanced Budget Amendment of 1997, which began the shift in\nMedicare's home health benefit from a cost-basis benefit to\na prospective payment system. Given that our data span from\nhence only months into implementation of the transitional\ninterim payment scheme, our estimates are likely to reflect more\nof the former regime than the current prospective payment\nsystem. Certainly, a further evaluation of the consequences of\nimplementation of a Medicare home health prospective pay-\nment for the hours and balance of care of older Americans with\ndisabilities deserves attention.\nThe asymmetries in home care dynamics revealed by our\nanalysis have both research and programmatic implications.\nCross-sectional multivariate analyses of variations in the inten-\nsity of home care generally exhibit relatively low explanatory\npower. Our results suggest that part of the unexplained varia-\ntion in home care usage results not from omitted current-period\nvariables but from omitted prior-period variables, in particular\nvariables describing the past trajectory of disability and of re-\nsponses to it. In addition, to the extent that current-period varia-\ntions in service use reflect prior-period variations in disability\nseverity and service use, issues related to equity in the allocation\nof services are raised.\nOur results neither address the question of appropriateness\nof service levels, either before or after a change in disability\nseverity, nor suggest that individuals are receiving more or\nfewer of the formal services for which they might be eligible\nthrough publicly funded programs. However, asymmetric\nresponses to changes in disability severity imply the existence\nof cross-sectional differences in service use that are unrelated to\ncurrent circumstances. Our results suggest the possibility that\nsome older persons with disabilities may be receiving differ-\nent levels of publicly and privately funded home care services,\nparticularly for routine care tasks such as shopping and house-\nkeeping, for reasons unrelated to their current needs; this is a\nsuggestion worth addressing in future research.\nOur findings of asymmetry in changes in paid service use\nmight be linked to programmatic intervals for assessing clients'\nfunctioning. During the period covered by the data analyzed\nherein, Medicare home health practices (which cover personal\nTable 6.

According to a study\nof 72 Medicaid home care programs (Congressional Research\nService, 1993), for example, 40% of existing programs required\nreassessments on an annual basis and another 50% once every\n6 months, and the remaining 10% less frequently. In contrast,\nMedicare's home health prospective payment system requires,\nevaluations. The dynamic framework adopted in this study\ncould be used to explore optimal review intervals for public and\nprivate programs alike.\nAnd what of the unpaid caregiver, most often the daughter,\nwho continues to provide care with shopping, cooking, and\ncleaning after her parent's difficulties have eased? Although\nhorizontal equity is not of programmatic concern here, why\nsuch behavior is occurring is an interesting question for future\nresearch. We can suggest several possibilities for further\nexploration. Perhaps permanent changes to work schedules\nmade in anticipation of a long parental illness may free up\na caregiver's time to continue routine care activities. Perhaps\ncaregivers enjoy the nonmonetary rewards of participating\nin intergenerational transfers, or perhaps they are helping in\nanticipation of future monetary rewards or in response to\npast transfers (Henretta, Hill, Soldo, & Wolf, 1997; Walker,\nMartin, & Jones, 1992). It may be that continued coresidence of\ncaregiver and care recipient fosters this helping behavior. In our\nsample, coresidence occurred in roughly 30% of cases; others\nhave noted the complex interrelationships of care and living\narrangement decisions (Pezzin & Schone, 1999; Pezzin et al.,\n1996). Finally, public incentives (e.g., tax credits or deductions\nfor family caregivers) may also play some role (Gerald, 1993).\nFinally, our analysis underscores the point that disability and\ncare are not static constructs in old age. Older persons who ex-\nperience disability worsen, stabilize, and recover, and their care\nhours change accordingly. Evaluations of home care programs\nmust be cognizant of such dynamic realities. Moreover, although\nequitable service allocations are difficult to achieve and maintain\nin the presence of substantial heterogeneity in disability\ntrajectories, home care programs and policies have to be built\naround the premise that old-age disability is a dynamic construct\nif policy makers are to take aim at such a goal.\n"
