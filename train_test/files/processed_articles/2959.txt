    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe paper discusses the question of whether financial participation of multilateral\ndevelopment banks does prompt private investors to inject more risky equity capital in\nemerging market banks. Using a theoretical model, it is stipulated that the presence of an\nofficial lender in a project gives the recipient country a stronger economic incentive to honor\nits contractual obligations instead of possibly restricting access to the investment position. An\ninnovative endogenous variable measuring the amount of invested equity capital which, given\na country's historical risk profile, can be considered \"at risk\" is tested in the empirical\ninvestigation. The observed outcome for the group of investors receiving co-financing by the\nInternational Finance Corporation (IFC) and/or the European Bank for Reconstruction and\nDevelopment (EBRD) is related \u00ad applying a propensity score matching approach using\ninformation on the characteristics of non-participants \u00ad to the amount these firms would have\ninvested had they not been selected for official support. The econometric results show that the\n\"treatment effect\" is significantly positive as stipulated.

In the literature, this particular topic has not yet attracted much attention. Having its\noriginal applications in labor market economics (pertaining to job training programs, for\nexample), econometric evaluation of the impact of participation in reform programs has\ntypically been confined to assessing the effectiveness of IMF country programs. Evidence on\nthe \"treatment\" effects of multilateral agencies' support at the firm level is still scarce,\nhowever.\nBuilding on a theoretical model by Asiedu and Villamil (2000), the paper starts from the\nassumption that the presence of an official investor in an FDI project gives the recipient\ncountry a stronger economic incentive to honor its contractual obligations. High-risk countries\ndo not themselves dispose of devices wherewith to improve their standing with international\ninvestors in the short run. Here, using the instruments multilateral development banks have to\noffer \u00ad loan subsides, technical assistance and, most importantly, provision of co-financing \u00ad\nmay work to lower a host country's required threshold of political safety that needs to be\ncrossed for it to receive FDI at all. Essentially a coalition of stakeholders, the multilateral\nagency may threaten to suspend its loans to the non-cooperative country altogether. This\nshould lead its government to weigh its options carefully if the expected future stream\nsubsidized lending that would be lost after a default represents a significant portion of the\ncountry's external financing. Therefore, participation of a multilateral agency can be thought\nof as a deterrent to expropriation or similarly detrimental events such as payment restrictions\nor denial of access to investors' property.\nIn order to measure the extent to which IFC/EBRD participation increased German banks'\nwillingness to enter high-risk environments, the study uses an innovative dependent variable\nwhich measures investors' equity capital that, given a country's risk profile, can be deemed\n\"at risk\". This \"exposure\", aptly called \"capital-at-risk\", is a product of the absolute amount\nof investment multiplied with the country's probability of sovereign default which itself is\nderived by linking the sovereign risk rating of the country to global historical five-year default\nrates on government bonds.\nFor the econometric estimation of the treatment effect propensity score matching is used. The\neconometric outcome shows that in the German case co-financing by multilateral\ndevelopment banks has indeed had a positive impact on the extent of risk-adjusted FDI. These\nresults are shown to be statistically significant at conventional levels. Moreover, applying the\nmatching procedure changes the relevant outcome of control group banks by up to nearly 30%\nof the initial simple average, thereby exemplifying the importance of choosing the correct\ncounterfactual outcome.\nWhile the estimation results are suggestive of significant effects relating to involvement of\nmultilateral agencies in FDI projects, a number of limitations have to be kept in mind. The\nstudy analyzes FDI projects of a single country of origin, and with only 77 evaluated projects\nthe sample size is relatively small. The investigation also rests on some important\nassumptions about non-systematic influence of unobserved bank characteristics and the\nwillingness of control group banks to receive the treatment. Finally, it is not possible to derive\nconclusions on the welfare effects for the international community at large, since the\ninsurance effect of involving multilaterals may prompt moral hazard effects and the\npossibility of over-investment in certain projects. Nonetheless, the results of this study should\nbe understood as a first indication that multilateral development banks can assume an effective\nrole in fostering direct investment in risky emerging markets.\nNichttechnische Zusammenfassung\nSogar gro\u00dfe multinationale Finanzkonglomerate suchen zuweilen bei der Ansiedlung in\neinem hochriskanten Umfeld die Unterst\u00fctzung durch eine multilaterale Entwicklungsbank\n(,,multilateral development bank\" \u00ad ,,MDB\"). Ausgehend von dieser Beobachtung untersucht\ndie vorliegende Arbeit, ob die Verf\u00fcgbarkeit von Kofinanzierung durch solche Institutionen\nwie die International Finance Corporation (IFC), eine Privatsektoraktivit\u00e4ten f\u00f6rdernde\nGesellschaft innerhalb der Weltbankgruppe, oder die Europ\u00e4ische Bank f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau und\nEntwicklung (EBWE) derartig unterst\u00fctzte deutsche Banken dazu veranlasst hat, zwischen\n1998 und 2001 mehr ,,risikoangepasstes\" Eigenkapital als gew\u00f6hnliche Investoren in\nausgew\u00e4hlten Schwellenl\u00e4ndern mit sich entwickelnden Finanzm\u00e4rkten zu investieren. In der\nLiteratur hat dieses spezielle Thema noch keine gro\u00dfe Aufmerksamkeit gefunden. Die\n\u00f6konometrische Evaluation der Wirkung der Teilnahme an Reformprogrammen, die\nanf\u00e4nglich in der Arbeitsmarktsforschung (z.B. bezogen auf berufliche Fortbildungs-\nma\u00dfnahmen) angewendet wurde, hat sich bislang \u00fcberwiegend auf die \u00dcberpr\u00fcfung der\nEffektivit\u00e4t von IWF-L\u00e4nderprogrammen beschr\u00e4nkt. Die Evidenz zu den ,,Behandlungs-\neffekten\" (,,treatment effects\") der Unterst\u00fctzung durch multilaterale Institutionen ist auf\nEinzelfirmenebene jedoch noch sp\u00e4rlich.\nAuf der Grundlage eines theoretischen Modells von Asiedu und Villamil (2000) geht die\nUntersuchung zu Beginn von der Annahme aus, dass das Vorhandensein eines \"offiziellen\"\nInvestors in einem Direktinvestitionsprojekt dem Empf\u00e4ngerland einen st\u00e4rkeren\n\u00f6konomischen Anreiz zur Einhaltung seiner vertraglichen Pflichten vermittelt. Hochriskante\nL\u00e4nder verf\u00fcgen selbst nicht \u00fcber die Mittel, um ihr ,,Standing\" bei internationalen Investoren\nkurzfristig zu verbessern. Hier kann die Nutzung der Instrumente, die multilaterale\nEntwicklungsbanken anbieten k\u00f6nnen \u00ad Kreditsubventionen, technische Hilfe und die\nbesonders wichtige Bereitstellung von Kofinanzierungen \u00ad, bewirken, dass die Mindest-\nschwelle an politischer Sicherheit in einem Gastland, die \u00fcberschritten werden muss, um\n\u00fcberhaupt Direktinvestitionen (,,foreign direct investment\" \u00ad ,,FDI\") zu erhalten, gesenkt\nwird: Die multilaterale Institution als De-facto-Koalition der Anspruchsberechtigten kann\ndamit drohen, ihre Kredite an unkooperierende L\u00e4nder zu sperren. Dies sollte die Regierung\nsolcher L\u00e4nder dazu bewegen, ihre Optionen besonders gr\u00fcndlich f\u00fcr den Fall abzuw\u00e4gen,\ndass der erwartete Zustrom an subventionierten Krediten, der nach einem Zahlungsausfall\n(,,default\") ausbliebe, einen erheblichen Anteil der externen Finanzierung des Landes\nausmacht. Daher kann die Beteiligung einer multilateralen Institution als Abschreckung\nhinsichtlich der Enteignung oder \u00e4hnlich sch\u00e4dlicher Ereignisse wie Zahlungsbeschr\u00e4nkungen\noder dem verweigerten Zugriff auf das Investoreneigentum verstanden werden.\nUm abzusch\u00e4tzen, inwieweit die Beteiligung der IFC bzw. EBWE die Bereitschaft der\ndeutschen Banken zum Markteintritt in einem Hochrisikoumfeld erh\u00f6ht hat, verwendet die\nStudie eine innovative unabh\u00e4ngige Variable, die das Eigenkapital der Investoren misst, das\nvor dem Hintergrund des Risikoprofils eines bestimmten Landes als risikobehaftet gelten\nkann. Dieses ,,Exposure\", treffend ,,capital-at-risk\" genannt, ist das Produkt aus absolutem\nInvestitionsvolumen und der Wahrscheinlichkeit des staatlichen Zahlungsausfalls (,,sovereign\ndefault\") eines Gastlandes. Diese wird ihrerseits durch die Verkn\u00fcpfung des L\u00e4nderrisiko-\nRatings eines Staates mit der entsprechenden globalen historischen Ausfallrate von\nStaatsanleihen f\u00fcnf Jahre nach deren Begebung berechnet.\nF\u00fcr die \u00f6konometrische Sch\u00e4tzung der Behandlungswirkung wird ein sogenanntes\n,,propensity score matching\" eingesetzt. Die Sch\u00e4tzergebnisse zeigen, dass die\nKofinanzierung durch multilaterale Entwicklungsbanken im Falle Deutschlands tats\u00e4chlich\neine positive Wirkung auf die H\u00f6he der risikoangepassten Direktinvestitionen gehabt hat. Es\nwird gezeigt, dass diese Ergebnisse statistisch signifikant sind. Zudem ver\u00e4ndert die\nAnwendung des Matching-Verfahrens das relevante Ergebnis der Banken in der\nKontrollgruppe um bis zu 30% des urspr\u00fcnglichen Durchschnittswerts. Dies veranschaulicht\ndie Bedeutung der Wahl des richtigen ,,kontrafaktischen\" Ergebnisses \u00ad also desjenigen,\nwelches sich f\u00fcr die Programmteilnehmer im hypothetischen Fall ihrer Nichtteilnahme\neingestellt h\u00e4tte.\nObwohl die Sch\u00e4tzergebnisse signifikante Effekte hinsichtlich der Beteiligung multilateraler\nInstitutionen bei Direktinvestitionsprojekten suggerieren, sollte eine Reihe von\nEinschr\u00e4nkungen nicht au\u00dfer Acht gelassen werden. Die Studie analysiert FDI-Projekte eines\neinzigen Ursprungslandes, und mit lediglich 77 evaluierten Projekten ist der Stichproben-\numfang relativ klein. Auch st\u00fctzt sich die Untersuchung auf einige wichtige Annahmen \u00fcber\nden nichtsystematischen Einfluss von unbeobachteten Bankencharakteristika und die\ngrunds\u00e4tzliche Teilnahmebereitschaft der nichtgef\u00f6rderten Banken in der Kontrollgruppe.\nLetzten Endes ist es auch nicht m\u00f6glich, R\u00fcckschl\u00fcsse auf die Wohlfahrtswirkungen f\u00fcr die\ninternationale Gemeinschaft insgesamt zu ziehen, da die Versicherungswirkung der\nBeteiligung von multilateralen Institutionen Moral-Hazard-Effekte und die M\u00f6glichkeit von\n\u00dcberinvestitionen in bestimmte Projekte nach sich ziehen kann. Gleichwohl sollten die\nErgebnisse dieser Arbeit als erstes Indiz dahingehend verstanden werden, dass multilaterale\nEntwicklungsbanken eine wirksame Rolle bei der F\u00f6rderung von Direktinvestitionen in\nriskanten Schwellenl\u00e4ndern einnehmen k\u00f6nnen.\nContents\n2.2 Discussion of Model Extensions 7\n2.2.1 Forbearance of the Multilateral Agency 7\n3 Endogenous Variable 9\n4 Estimation Method and Exogenous Variables 12\n4.1 The Problem of Self-Selection in Program Evaluation 12\nDoes Co-Financing by Multilateral Development Banks Increase\n\"Risky\" Direct Investment in Emerging Markets? \u00ad\nEvidence for German Banking FDI\n1 Introduction\nMultinational development banks such as the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the\nmain private sector arm of the World Bank, or the European Bank for Reconstruction and\nDevelopment (EBRD), operating analogously in the Central and Eastern European transition\ncountries, have for years been taking stakes (equity or debt) in foreign direct investment (FDI)\nprojects in emerging market economies that were initiated by investors located in\nindustrialized countries. Founded already in 1956, IFC shares commercial risks with foreign\ninvestors when they are not yet prepared to invest on their own account (for details on IFC's\noperations in banking sector projects see Box 2, Appendix). Similarly, EBRD has helped\nmobilize private investment and improve the investment climate by loans and equity\nparticipations since its establishment in 1991. At times, even large financial conglomerates\nthat undoubtedly have accumulated the needed expertise and experience for venturing into\nemerging markets request and indeed attain support by these institutions in apparently\ndifficult projects, which leads one to wonder about the economics of such a decision.\nIt is often alleged that having such international financial institutions participate in foreign\nbusiness ventures helps mitigate project risks. For example, IFC (2002) perceives itself as a\ncatalyst to help clients implement investment plans and to mitigate risk, thereby enabling\ninvestors to proceed with plans that they otherwise would not implement in light of perceived\nrisks. This paper does not attempt to verify this statement with respect to ordinary commercial\nrisks but concentrates on the issue of sovereign risk, investigating whether German banks that\nobtain project-related co-financing from the IFC or the EBRD invest more \"risk-adjusted\"\nequity capital in emerging banking markets1 than do ordinary investors. As events during the\nrecent Argentinean crisis have shown \u00ad banks were virtually disowned by the forced\nasymmetrical \"pesification\" of assets against deposits \u00ad, host country governments may\nperceive the banking sector to be a \"strategic\" industry for economic development. What\nfollowed were discussions at the international level2 about the safety of FDI in the financial\nsector and whether instruments or institutions can be devised for protecting foreign investors\nagainst political risks. Analyzing this question with respect to the role of multilateral\n1 The financial sector represents one of IFC's so-called high-impact sectors, where spillover effects to other parts\nof the economy are significant. Financial sector projects accounted for about 40% of IFC commitments on\n2 For example the Working Group of the Committee on the Global Financial System on \"FDI in the financial\nsector of emerging market economies\" at the Bank for International Settlements, Basle.\ndevelopment banks in FDI projects is the motivation for this study. It is restricted to banking\nFDI because inclusion of other sectors would have implied arduous accounting for various\nindustry-specific factors which multilateral development banks' consider when deciding\nwhich projects to co-finance. The obvious question of whether officially supported projects\ndisplay a higher profitability3 cannot be answered in this paper because the data series on\nearnings are not yet long enough.\nThe investigation is organized as follows: Section two presents a clear-cut model that outlines\nthe incentives underlying the host country's decision to possibly expropriate the foreign\ninvestment position and explains the existence of different investment levels given varying\ncountry risk profiles across locations. An innovative variable measuring the amount of\ninvestment capital adjusted for the probability of sovereign default and, accordingly,\nexpropriation is presented in section three. The following section illustrates the propensity\nscore matching approach used for measuring the treatment effect associated with official co-\nfinancing and the derivation of exogenous variables needed for estimating the individual\nprobability of receiving the treatment. Section five gives an understanding of how the sample\nof countries and projects was arrived at. Finally, estimation results and significance checks\nare presented in section six, followed by a brief conclusion in the last section.\n2 The Model\nThe theoretical underpinning to this paper is a model propagated by Asiedu and Villamil\nwell as to a lesser extent on that by Thomas and Worrall (1994). Central to all of these papers\nis the notion that a country's decision to default on its external debt obligations is influenced\nby economic incentives which lend themselves to modeling.\nIn a two-country setting, the host (or recipient) country has a capital stock which is less than\nthe optimal stock, i.e. the marginal product of the domestic capital stock f\u00b4(kd) is still higher\nthan the required rate of return r. The investor from the foreign country can either receive a\nreturn  from utilizing a safe storage facility or expect to receive r by investing in the host\ncountry. Note that Asiedu and Villamil refer to capital injection by lending rather than equity\nparticipation, but the results remain valid if r is interpreted as a constant required rate of\nreturn instead of a fixed interest rate. In general, r> >0, actuating foreign firms to invest as\nmuch as possible in a given project.\n3 There is, however, some evidence that IFC-sponsored projects have, on average, been less successful than other\nforeign investment projects undertaken independently; see Mavrotas (2002), p. 9, footnote 9.\nHowever, the host country government is subject to countervailing incentives. It can either be\n\"good\", i.e. honor the contractual agreements and receive (discounted) returns f (k) from the\ncombined capital stock k = kf (foreign-supplied) + kd (domestic) less the return r paid on kf\nfrom now on to infinity:\n\n=\n- -\n-\n-\n=\n-\n-\n=\nt\ns\nd\nd\nt\ns\nt\nk\nk\nr\nk\nf\n\u00df\nk\nk\nr\nk\nf\n\u00df\nk\nG )]\n(\n)\n(\n[\n)]\n(\n)\n(\n[\n)\n(\nr\n\u00df\nand\nk\nk\nk\nwhere d\nf \n=\n+\n= .\nThe factor \u00df is not simply a discount factor as in Eaton and Gersovitz (1983) but includes a\ncountry-specific risk parameter  denoting \"the probability of survival, an idiosyncratic factor\nthat reflects the `patience\u00b4 of decision makers in the poor country\".4 High-risk locations where\nthe government, trying to remain in office, is myopic, will have a low  and thus a large\ndiscount on expected returns. Eaton and Gersovitz (1983) account for part of the country risk\nby discounting income from foreign capital f\u00b4(kt\n) * kt\nf by multiplying the term with (1-t\n),\nwhere t\nis a \"tax\" rate on foreign capital and =1 means full expropriation.5\nAlternatively, the government can choose to be \"bad\", i.e. expropriate the foreign investor's\nholdings. Hence, it enjoys the entire return on capital f (k) at time s = 0 and loses access to\nforeign capital henceforth \u00ad f (kd) rather than f (k) \u00ad, thus being left with the (discounted)\nnational income (in autarky):\n\n+\n=\n-\n-\n+\n=\n+\n=\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\nt\ns\nd\nd\nt\nt\ns\nt\nt\nk\nf\n\u00df\n\u00df\nk\nf\nk\nf\n\u00df\nk\nf\nk\nB .\nClearly, the host country government will honor its obligations as long as the repayment\nincentive constraint G(k)  B(k) holds in every state. This constraint ensures that the contract\nis self-enforcing which means that the long-term benefits of fulfilling the contract exceed\nshort-term gains to be had by repudiating claims. It is effectively the threat of halting\ninvestment flows altogether that works to forestall expropriation.6\nIn solving the optimization problem, the capital stock k maximizing the host country's present\ndiscounted utility of income W is then chosen, subject to the repayment incentive constraint:7\n7 Asiedu and Villamil (2002, p. 479) subject the maximization problem to the additional constraint that the\nforeign investor must receive at least the return available from the storage facility, which is fulfilled here by\nassumption.\n),\n(\n)\n(\ns.t.\n)],\n(\n)\n(\n[\n)\n(\nmax k\nk\nB\nk\nG\nk\nk\nr\nk\nf\n\u00df\nk\nW d \n\n-\n-\n-\n=\nBy taking the Lagrangian, the first-order conditions turn out to be:\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n( k\nB\nk\nG\nand\n\u00df\n\u00df\nr\nr\nk\nf =\n+\n-\n=\n-\n\n\n\n.\nInvestment is at its efficient level when marginal revenue f\u00b4(k) equals marginal cost r.\nAccordingly, any \"wedge\" between the two expressions represents an efficiency loss due to\nsub-optimal enforcement of the investment contract that leads to under-investment.8 The\nright-hand side of (4) and thus the degree of inefficiency depend on the discount factor \u00df, the\nrate of return r and the extent to which incentive constraint  binds (if it does,  > 0).\nObviously, it is desirable for the right-hand side to approach zero. This is the case when 0,\ni.e. the constraint becomes weak, \u00df1, i.e. political risk decreases, and r0, i.e. a lower rate\nreturn is to be paid to the investor which is bounded from below by the interest rate  on the\nrisk-free storage facility. Since r cannot be zero under normal circumstances, it is not a\nvariable to be altered with a view to bringing about the optimal solution. This task is\neffectively left to the risk measure \u00df as it also has a bearing on whether the constraint will\nbind or not. Accordingly, the host country's characteristics determine its discount factor,\nwhich in turn influences the flow of FDI. In their earlier paper, Asiedu and Villamil (2000)\nshow that the variation in \u00df yields three ranges of foreign investment, of which only case 3 is\ntruly efficient:\nCase 1: B(k) > G(k) (constraint set is empty),\nCase 2:  > 0 (constraint binds): f\u00b4 (k) > r ,\nCase 3:  = 0 (constraint does not bind): f\u00b4 (k) = r .\nIn case 1, rational investors anticipate expropriation by the host country government and will\ntherefore avoid direct investment. Case 2 describes an intermediate solution: as the constraint\nbinds, the remaining inefficiency owing to a non-zero numerator in (4) renders the investment\nlevel sub-optimal, i.e. there is under-investment since no commitment technology exists with\nwhich to induce both parties to adhere to the first-best solution after the initial investment has\ntaken place.9 Case 3 represents the optimal state: the constraint does not bind \u00ad there is no risk\nof expropriation at any time \u00ad and foreign investors inject capital until marginal revenue\nequals marginal cost.\nA numerical example will illustrate why these different zones exist. Suppose that \u00df is near\nzero, i.e. host country officials are extremely short-sighted. Then B(k) > G(k) (see also figure\n1, Appendix), i.e.:\n).\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n,\n.\n,\n)]\n(\n)\n(\n[\n)\n(\n)\n(\nd\nd\nd\nk\nk\nr\nk\nf\nk\nf\nTherefore\n\u00df\nand\n\u00df\n\u00df\nif\nbecause\nk\nk\nr\nk\nf\n\u00df\nk\nf\n\u00df\n\u00df\nk\nf\n-\n-\n>\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n-\n-\n>\n-\n+ \nThe utility of confiscating the existing foreign capital stock is greater than honoring the\ncontract because the government does not adequately value future capital injections from\nabroad and will thus aim to avoid paying the return on the modest foreign capital it is still\nlikely to receive.\nAt the other extreme \u00ad when \u00df approaches one \u00ad the repayment incentive constraint will tend\nto be satisfied, i.e. B(k)  G(k). This is because both of the above expressions involving \u00df go\nto infinity as the series cease to converge. However, for very large magnitudes of r(k-kd), the\ncountry's incentive to rid itself of the external payment burden turns strong, and B(k) will\nonce again exceed G(k). The upper (feasible) bound of kmax\nis where B(k) intersects with the\ndownward-sloping curve of G(k), i.e. with B\u00b4(k) > 0 and G\u00b4(k) < 0 (see figure 3, Appendix).\nBy contrast, the lower bound kmin\nis determined by the minimal threshold of \u00df in order for the\nconstraint to bind which is the case at the intersection of both functions, with both B\u00b4(k) and\nG\u00b4(k) > 0.

Note that kmax\ndoes not\nnecessarily coincide with the optimal capital stock k* if at that point the utility of income\nW(k), being a function of G(k), is not maximized, which is the case if G\u00b4(kmax\n) < 0. The\noptimum is determined by G\u00b4(k*) = 0 and G\u00b4\u00b4(k) < 0. On the other hand, under-investment\ntakes place if k* cannot be attained because the incentive constraint would not be fulfilled at\npoint k* (see figure 2, Appendix). Hence, there will only be the constrained capital stock kc\nwhich is lower than k* if B(k) > G(k), even though G\u00b4(k) > 0. Unconstrained investment ku\nwill be possible if and only if G(k*)  B(k*) and \u00df*  \u00dfmin\n, with \u00df* being the discount factor\ncorresponding to k*. Thus, the three cases can be characterized in more detail as follows:\n.\ninvestment\nforeign\nned\nunconstrai\n;\n*\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n*,\n(\n:\n,\ninvestment\nforeign\nd\nconstraine\n*;\n)\n(\n)\n(\n*)\n,\n(\n:\nautarky,\nfinancial\ni.e.\n,\ninvestment\nforeign\nno\n);\n(\n)\n(\n)\n,\n(\n:\nmin\nmin\nmin\n\u00df\n\u00df\nand\nk\nB\nk\nG\n\u00df\n\u00df\nCase\nk\nk\nbut\nk\nB\nk\nG\n\u00df\n\u00df\n\u00df\nCase\nk\nG\nk\nB\n\u00df\n\u00df\nCase\nc\n\n\n\u00de\n\n<\n\n\u00de\n\n>\n\u00de\n\nClearly, it is desirable for both parties to the contract to widen the area where case 3 applies,\nor, for high-risk environments, case 2 instead of case 1. The problem is that the perceived \u00df is\nvirtually exogenous, i.e. the host country has hardly any mechanisms at its disposal to\ncredibly increase its discount factor in the short-term. Over time, assessments of country risk,\nfor instance by credit rating agencies, may change thanks to improved macroeconomic and\npolitical stability, but usually this tends to be a protracted process.\nAsiedu and Villamil (2002) discuss policy options available to the host country to tackle this\nperceived commitment problem. All of these options involve external assistance supplied by\neither industrialized countries or, more appropriately, by multilateral development agencies.\nThe recipient country can either (a) request a loan subsidy from a bilateral lender, (b) ask for\ntechnical assistance or (c) solicit a multilateral development bank's financial support. In case\n(a), the subsidized interest rate  is lower than the required rate of return r, with the external\nrepayment obligation r(k-kd) being lowered to r(1-) (k-kd) +  (k-kd),  being the share of\nsubsidized external financing. By calibration the authors show that for any level of subsidized\nloans both thresholds \u00dfmin\nand \u00df* are lower than before. It is not hard to see that the effect of\nsubsidization is twofold: in the short run, the incentive constraint is fulfilled for lower values\nof \u00df, and over the medium term, the country disposes of more low-cost funds which act to\nrelease budgetary resources for implementing structural reforms. Case (b), technical\nassistance, works in a different way: by updating production processes, the host country's\nproductivity is strengthened and f (k) rises by the factor [1+()], with  denoting the amount\nof resources spent on technical assistance. In turn, this also lowers the threshold \u00dfmin\n.\nThe final case (c) is the one on which this study centers. It is hypothesized that, by having a\nmultilateral agency participate in an FDI project, \u00dfmin\nis lowered to the point at which\ninvestment, if constrained, takes place. Asiedu and Villamil (2002, p. 486) argue that at times\na single lender \u00ad here by means of \"uncoordinated\" bilateral aid \u00ad may not be able to reduce\n\u00dfmin\nsufficiently. Therefore, if the individual discount factor is very low, several investors may\nbe needed to overcome the autarky scenario because the required funding may exceed a single\ndonor country's allotted resources. This is where the usefulness of charging a multilateral\ndevelopment bank (MDB) with coordinating the lending effort comes into play. Absent\ncentralized lending, the recipient country might lean towards selective default on some\ncreditors. If instead lenders form a coalition under the roof of the MDB, the host country\ngovernment will weigh its options more carefully because the future stream of subsidized\nlending that would be lost when defaulting on multilateral loans might be substantial, even\nforbidding. Put differently, the additional payoffs arising from multilateral financing that\nwould be lost after a possible default in the autarky situation matter strongly when the\ncountry, as can be expected in the case of emerging markets, is a frequent customer with the\nmultilateral agency. Thus, if a large share of a country's current and future external financing\ncomes from the World Bank or one of the regional development banks, default against these\ninstitutions is really not an option, as doing so would result in the cessation of all lending\noperations already scheduled.\nApplied to the question under study, participation of a multilateral in an FDI project acts as a\ndeterrent to the conceivable expropriation of the foreign subsidiary as there is much more at\nstake for the host country than just the expected payments from a particular project. Losing all\nof one's multilateral subsidized credit may seem a harsh penalty for a possibly minor selective\ndefault, but it is certainly something to be reckoned with when taking hold of a project in\nwhich a multilateral agency is invested.10\n2.2 Discussion of Model Extensions\n2.2.1 Forbearance by the Multilateral Agency\nIn extending the model, we may ease the strong restriction of an automatic freezing of future\nofficial credit somewhat by introducing a leniency factor \u00b5 (with 0  \u00b5  1) denoting the\nprobability that the multilateral development bank, keen on minimizing its losses, and thus all\nother private creditors, assured by the implicit guarantee of MDB forbearance, will decide11\nnot to stop lending to the host country even though the rights of the agency are infringed\nupon.12 This variable is deemed to depend on the country's track record with its external\ncreditors that is partially reflected in its current \u00df, and on the amount of total debt and equity\ncapital \"owed\" to the MDB (\"too-big-to-fail\" doctrine). Therefore, the host country will\nviolate its external obligations only if B(k) \u00ad G(k) > 0, i.e.:\n)]\n(\n)\n(\n[\n)]}\n(\n)[\n,\n(\n)\n(\n{\n)\n( >\n-\n-\n-\n-\n+\n-\n+ d\nf\nMDB\nd k\nk\nr\nk\nf\n\u00df\nk\nf\nk\n\u00df\nk\nf\n\u00df\n\u00df\nk\nf \u00b5 .\n10 A theory of the relationship between the multilateral agency and the host country under asymmetrical\ninformation and diverging interests is elaborated by Pallage and Robe (2003) who show that the agency can\nsupplement its inferior state of information about the success of the projects at hand by requiring that the country\ninvest its own funds in the project that the agency wants undertaken.\n11 It is assumed that this decision is made in the same period as the initial investment and expropriation in order\nto integrate this event into the static model.\n12 As the recent past has shown, this less restrictive assumption is supported by empirical evidence. The MDB\nhas a politically motivated self interest in preventing the debtor from defaulting against the MDB and has\noptions at its disposal to avert such an event. For instance, after the Argentinean default towards its private\ncreditors, the IMF and the World Bank essentially deferred Argentina's debt service by floating exactly the funds\nneeded to prevent the country's multilateral debt from becoming past due.\nNote that the leniency factor provides the host country with a countervailing incentive\nconcerning its discount factor. As its reputation as a decent borrower rises in line with prudent\nmacroeconomic management and investor relations, it will have greater leeway to tamper with\nits external obligations. On the other hand, the country is given the incentive to become a\nsubstantial borrower, and in turn this status will materialize only if the country initially plays\nby the rules. Thus, at least in the short run the leniency factor will be quite low (near zero) for\nthe bulk of emerging markets, and they must fear getting cut off from official finance in the\ncase of default. Applied to the wide spectrum of emerging market economies, this also means\nthat the benefit of involving an MDB tends to diminish as the state of development advances.\n2.2.2 Threat of Judicial Enforcement\nOne can further alter the model by incorporating the likelihood that the investor is able to\nrecoup all or part of the initial investment with the help of an enforcement technology such as\nthe one provided by courts. Indeed, Krasa and Villamil (2000) account for imperfect judicial\nenforcement that both parties will want to avoid because using it causes a deadweight loss.\nThe foreign government, in deciding to disown the investor, must make allowances for the\npossibility of getting sued in court after an expropriation. To forestall this outcome, the\ngovernment may determine to voluntarily pay the investor a certain sum of money that would\nbe sufficient to avert judicial enforcement. This payment will have to at least equal the\nexpected legal costs of a lawsuit to be borne initially by the plaintiff plus the amount of\ninvestment the investor could reasonably expect to recoup by legal action multiplied by the\nsubjective probability of a ruling in favor of the investor. Thus, the utility from non-\ncooperation is further expanded to:\n(\n)]}\n(\n)[\n,\n(\n)\n(\n{\n)\n(\n)\n( f\nf\nMDB\nd k\nx\nc\nk\nf\nk\n\u00df\nk\nf\n\u00df\n\u00df\nk\nf\nk\nB \n-\n-\n+\n-\n+\n= \n\u00b5 ,\nwhere c = the supposedly fixed legal costs,  = the probability of the investor's legal success\nand x = the share of the investment likely to still be recouped (0  x  1). Alternatively, should\nthe government decide to take its chances and wait for the lawsuit to evolve, the set-up would\nhave to become intertemporal and thus unnecessarily complex.13 Such a setting would mean\ntaking the model too far considering its rather straightforward purpose. Hence, the construct\nof a lump-sum payment appears to be an elegant way to model the financial pressures\nassociated with possible judicial enforcement mechanisms.\n13 The model would then have to be a dynamic non-cooperative game with several decision knots. Put simply,\nfirst the MDB makes the decision whether or not to suspend payments to the recipient country. In case of\nforbearance, the investor then decides whether or not to take legal action. If the investor sues, the court then rules\nwhether or not the claim is valid. If the ruling is in favor of the plaintiff, the investor must then try to enforce its\nclaim, which may or may not be feasible. In effect, a series of contingent probabilities would have to be\naccounted for, all of which are hardly quantifiable.\nNevertheless, calculating this compensatory payment appears to be a daring task as none of\nthe parameters are readily available. Most problematically, there is no established legal\npractice in such cases that would help determine the likelihood of a lawsuit's success.14 Given\nthe lack of dependable evidence, that would suggest that the allowance for contingent\nreimbursements should be substantial, the probability weighting factor  and thus the chances\nof judicial enforcement will be close to zero. Even so, the foreign government may want to\ndisplay its (possibly feigned) willingness to cooperate by making some voluntary payment in\nline with the one modeled above. In the end, having an independent MDB stand ready to help\nenforce the contract by threatening to withhold development credit causes the constraint  to\nbind. Regarding the \"loss\" of investment capital this parallels the \"court scenario\" where the\ngovernment must expect an outflow of capital by way of the investor's entering an action.15\nIf, indeed, the involvement of multilateral institutions helps mitigate ad-hoc the risk of default\nin high-risk environments, commercial investors in such projects should be willing to commit\nlarger amounts of risky capital compared to regular investment projects without official\nbacking. The next section describes the derivation of an appropriate dependent variable.\n3 Endogenous Variable\nAnalogous to the VaR-concept applied in the finance literature, this study proposes a variable\nmeasuring the capital-at-risk (CAR), which, unpretentiously, is defined as the absolute amount\nof FDI capital invested in a given foreign bank multiplied by the probability of an individual\nhost country's defaulting on any of its sovereign debt issues over the medium term.16 In other\nwords, abstaining from complementary legal enforcement technology, the CAR represents the\nexpected ex-ante (at least temporary) loss of capital, or \"exposure\", given the likelihood that a\nparticular host country will violate contractual agreements by imposing (additional) capital\naccount restrictions which inhibit the immediate access of foreign nationals to their\ninvestment and its payoffs.17 Admittedly, that risk may sometimes be less severe than a\ncountry's sovereign risk because the government may decide to leave the investment project\nuntouched regardless of possible multilateral participation. On the other hand, the government\nmay decide to disown private investors before defaulting on its sovereign debt issues. Absent\n14 Of the 80 cases that the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) has concluded\nsince 1972 (see www.worldbank.org/icsid/cases/conclude.htm), 34 ended with ICSID rendering an award to the\nclaimant, 28 were discontinued upon arriving at a settlement, and the remaining cases were either discontinued at\nthe claimant's request or outright rejected as ICSID declined jurisdiction over the dispute. In other isolated cases,\nGerman investors have been able to obtain warrants from commercial courts that in principle would enable them\nto seize the debtor country's physical foreign assets, of which there are almost none to be had in reality.\n15 The second event is not always entirely contingent on the first because an impatient investor may preemptively\nsue the country in court regardless of what the MDB will do. However, in most cases the investor will await the\noutcome of the MDB's attempt to enforce its claims.\n16 As the sample comprises four years (see section 5), the absolute amount of equity capital was adjusted in each\ncase for minor inflationary effects using the German GDP deflator.\n17 This harmful action need not necessarily be outright expropriation as discussed in the model.\ncompelling evidence in favor of either position, it appears fair to assume that a country under\nfinancial distress is going to obstruct foreign investment projects after a sovereign default.\nThe idea of relating invested capital to the probability of default is employed by Razin et al.\n(2001) who in a lending scenario determine the risk-free required rate of return by adding the\nresidual value of the firm weighted by the default probability to the contracted principal and\ninterest payments weighted by the no-default probability. The probability-weighting approach\nis also implicit in the discussion instigated by Eaton and Gersovitz (1983, p. 87), who contend\nthat \"risk neutral lenders will set the interest rate so that the probability of repayment times\nthe amount to be repaid just equals the gross return that can be made on a safe loan\".\nSimilarly, if expected returns on investment do not ex-ante differ substantially across\nemerging market economies, risk-conscious investors will therefore invest smaller amounts in\nhigh-risk locations, anticipating that a larger fraction of their investment will be subject to\ndefault owing to more pronounced sovereign risk. As Eaton and Gersovitz (1983, p. 95) put it:\n\"Unable to forswear repudiation and expropriation, capital-importing countries receive less\nprivate capital than otherwise\". This verdict is valid unless the perceived (sovereign) default\nrisk can be mitigated in the eyes of investors by means of involving a multilateral\ndevelopment bank with preferred creditor status.18 In this case, and this is the hypothesis to\nbe tested in the empirical investigation, the capital-at-risk with MDB participation can be\nexpected to exceed the resultant value without official support.19\n18 The term preferred creditor refers to external creditors of sovereign countries who are legally entitled to be\ngiven priority among a group of creditors. Multilateral agencies such as the World Bank or the IMF could argue\nthat a claim for preferential treatment is justified by their status as international organizations and their function\nin the global economic order. Historically, the legal validity of preferences with regard to external debt has been\nrecognized by international tribunals in certain cases. However, in international law there is no general basis to\nsupport the priority claim of any individual creditor or class of creditors. The status of preferred creditor is not\nprescribed by a compulsory standard of international conduct. It can, therefore, be achieved only by virtue of\nparticular international law, i.e. through an agreement to that effect between debtor and creditor, and is thus an\noptional standard for international behavior. In other words, there is not such a thing comparable to \"statutory\npreferred creditors\" under general international law. In the international practice the status of preferred creditor\nis mainly acquired through a specific agreement. The needed consensus can either involve an unilateral act of\nwill of the debtor, or, more commonly, take the form of a multilateral treaty that includes the requirement of\npreferential treatment as a condition for receiving financial assistance; see Martha (1990), pp. 806-812. While\nthe legal basis may appear convoluted, international practice has shown that countries do honor the multinational\nagencies' preferred creditor status, mainly for the economic reasons referred to above.\n19 Another way for German investors to cope with high-risk environments is to obtain political risk insurance\nthat is offered by the World Bank entity MIGA or in Germany by PriceWaterhouseCoopers on behalf of the\nGerman government. Commenting on the U.S. equivalent OPIC, Eaton and Gersovitz (1983, pp. 98-99) argue\nthat this type of insurance does not provide an incentive to carefully weigh the opportunities and risks in a given\ndestination country. Even worse, probably knowing that investors' concern about default is less severe in that\ncase, host governments are less compelled to compare the utilities of honoring contracts and non-cooperation. In\nsuch a case one could, therefore, argue that there is no such thing as capital-at-risk but solely the \"loss\" of up-\nfront insurance fees should the insurance eventually prove to be unnecessary. Therefore, there is less of a truly\nrisky position held by direct investors. Problematically, some host countries that are prone to commit hostile acts\nagainst investors are barred ex-ante from insurance. An even greater obstacle to empirical testing is the fact that\nMIGA does not have very many banking projects in its portfolio. In general, according to a MIGA official\npolitical risk insurance is far less likely to be obtained for banking FDI than it is for manufacturing FDI. For\nthese reasons, this study refrains from measuring the effects of political risk insurance.\nThe probability of default of sample countries is derived from medium-term default rates of\nsovereign debt as supplied by leading rating agencies. The first two columns of Table 1 below\nshow Moody's and Standard & Poor's historical default rates for sovereign bonds five years\nupon issuance, i.e. typically the transition rates for issues downgraded from a speculative\ninvestment rating to selective default20 over that time span.\nThe ratings of the two most prominent rating agencies do not differ substantially, as the table\nTable 1: Credit Ratings and Default Rates\nRating S&P Sov 5yr\nMoody's Sov 5yr\nAverage Sov 5yr S&P Corp 5yr\nMoody's Corp 5yr\nA\nBBB\nSource: Standard & Poor's (2003) and Moody's (2003); * also includes ratings \"Ca\" and \"C\".\nSub-letter grades (e.g. BBB-) were estimated by regressing the average sovereign default rates\n(third column above) on the sub-values of Euromoney's credit rating (scores 0-10; original\norder reversed) using a third-order polynomial.22 Note that there is no default rate for\nsovereign issues CCC and lower. This does not mean there have not been any defaults on\nsuch highly speculative instruments. On the contrary, according to S&P the CCC/CC default\nrates were 83% and 100% after one and three years, respectively. However, S&P also advises\nthat with the number of defaults still being very low, the statistical base is subject to small\nsample bias. It remains yet to be seen how the default rates will evolve as more and more\nhigh-risk issuers tap the market for sovereign debt.23\n20 Standard & Poor's generally defines default as the failure of an obligor to meet a principal or interest payment\non the due date (or within the specified grace period) contained in the original terms of the debt issue. For that\nmatter, Moody's definition differs somewhat as the borrower is considered in default even if the delayed\npayment is made within the grace period. Apart from missing repayments, both agencies' definition of default\nalso comprises a country's offer to reschedule its obligations on less favorable terms (lower coupon or par value)\nin order to avoid a more severe event of default; see Moody's (2003), p. 4, and Standard & Poor's (2003), p. 17.\n21 The striking difference in the BBB ratings is probably due to a diverging rating for Indonesia, which was\ninitially rated investment grade by S&P while, presumably, being included by Moody's in the speculative\ninvestment cohort from the outset; see Standard & Poor's (2003), p. 5.\nomitted to render the fit virtually perfect).\n23 The number of emerging market issuers placing sovereign bonds for the first time has picked up sharply since\nthe mid-1990s. After a temporary slump due to the Asian and tech-related stock market crises, the number\nappears to have leveled off at around three new issuers per year; see Grigorian (2003), pp. 14, 19.\nIt might have been reasonable to set the default rate for such issues uniformly at 50%, as this\nnumber takes account of the historical five-year default rates for CCC/CC-rated corporate\nissues \u00ad the lower of the two ratings is 50.7% (see column four) \u00ad to which the sovereign\ndefault rates are expected to converge over time.24 Up until recently, the so-called sovereign\nceiling set the upper limit for corporate issues. In other words, the rating of a domestic\ncorporation effectively never exceeded the one for its country.25 However, to still make a\ndistinction between relatively \"viable\" countries with a CCC rating and those in or close to\ndefault, the empty continuum, i.e. the range between credit ratings lower than BBB- and\nhighly risky countries in default or without rating, is filled by linking the default probability to\nEuromoney's comprehensive country risk score, which, in the event, ranged between 34.93\nand 16.71. An exponential trend of default rates as has been shown to be the case with better-\nrated issues shall not be assumed. Instead, for simplicity, a linear relationship is implied:\nBangladesh, having the highest country risk score of the sub-sample, is given the estimated\ndefault rate immediately below the one of a B- rating, while lowest-rated Yugoslavia is\nassigned a 65.6% probability of default (for a full list of country rates see Table 7,\nAppendix).26 With the derivation of risk-weighting factors accomplished, we can now turn to\nthe estimation procedure in the next section.\n4 Estimation Method and Exogenous Variables\n4.1 The Problem of Self-Selection in Program Evaluation\nAs mentioned before, the purpose of this investigation is to determine whether there is indeed\na causal effect of a certain \"treatment\" \u00ad in this case a multilateral development bank's\nparticipation in an FDI project \u00ad on said outcome variable, CAR, experienced by units in the\npopulation of interest which is the group of projects with MDB participation.\n24 Standard & Poor's (2003) review of historical default rate stresses that the difference in default probability\nbetween sovereign and corporate issuers as shown in the right hand-side columns of Table 1 should not be\nviewed as significant because of the small number of rated sovereigns ever having defaulted on their bonds. As\nthat number rises over time, the sovereign default rate should broadly parallel the default rates for similarly rated\ncorporate issuers. For reference, columns four and five display Moody's and S&P's five-year default rates for\ncorporate issues. As can be seen, the differences between the average sovereign default rates and those for the\ncorporate side are relatively small already now that the base of speculative grade sovereign issuers is just\nbeginning to take shape.\n25 See Kr\u00e4ussl (2003), p. 32. This longstanding notion was recently annulled in the Argentinean case when\nsovereign bond spreads rose above corporate ones; see Schobert (2003), p. 175. Even so, the sovereign ceiling is\nby and large substantiated by the incidents of default observed across the letter grades displayed in Table 1.\n26 The two projects in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip (Palestine authorities) were assigned a country risk\nscore of 10, while the one on the British Virgin Islands received a score of 40, which in 1999 was about the\naverage of the small island economies in the Caribbean.\nAt first glance it might appear sufficient to simply compare the average outcome of the\n\"treated\" units given their participation in the program (Y1\n| D = 1) and \"non-treated\" ones\ngiven their staying aloof (Y0\n| D = 0).27 Hence, the observed outcome for the treated unit i is:\nYi\n+ Di\n).28 Problematically, the hypothesized effect of the treatment cannot be\nisolated as there may be more than one factor which is driving this result. It might as well be\nthat superior (inferior) firms predominately self-select into the sponsorship program. As each\nunit can be assumed to take individual performance characteristics into account in applying to\na program, its specific component of the treatment effect will then be correlated with the\ndecision process.29 If treated banks are more (less) capable than their non-treated counterparts,\nthere is reason to expect that they should perform better (worse) even if they were not chosen\nfor the program. The catch is that this situation cannot be observed because they do enjoy\nparticipation by an MDB. That is, we have no information about the performance in the\nhypothetical counterfactual situation \u00ad a typical missing-data problem.\nHence, constructing the counterfactual is the central issue that evaluation techniques seek to\naddress. The objective is to construct an optimal control group of non-participants whose\noutcomes closely emulate the unobserved results program participants would have displayed\nin the hypothetical case of non-participation.30 In other words, a proper measure of program\neffectiveness would isolate the impact of the program on the outcome and compare it to what\nwould have resulted in the absence of the program.31\n4.2 Propensity Score Matching\nThe non-parametric propensity score matching approach deals with the problem of selection\nbias by instructing to select observable project characteristics so that units with the same\n\"values\" of these factors will not exhibit systematic differences in their reactions to reform.\nThis approach can be described as \"selection on observables\" and thus differs markedly from\nthe well-known Heckman selection model that aims to correct for selection on\nunobservables.32 Matching overcomes the common failure to \"weight comparably\" by\ncreating a control group and then re-weighting its data in order to equate the distribution of\nobservable characteristics in the participant and non-participant samples:33 Every treated unit\nis matched to a non-treated unit which at the time before the treatment is as similar as\n27 Given that the selection criteria are applied to both groups, D=0 indicates that the project at hand either did not\nmeet the eligibility criteria or, more likely, was not submitted for consideration in the co-financing program.\n33 See Heckman et al. (1997), p. 626. The authors give an example of the \"classical\" application for the matching\nestimator which is the evaluation of the effectiveness of job training programs.\npossible, if not virtually identical, in its characteristics. Outcome differences between the\ngroups can then be attributed to the treatment.34 Therefore, it is possible under some\nassumptions to estimate the average treatment effect (ATT) at the population level \u00ad a\nconcept that goes back to the work of Rubin (1974). Algebraically, the causal effect that\nresults from co-financing by the MDB is:\n|\n[\n]\n|\n[\n]\n|\n-\n=\n=\n=\n- D\nY\nE\nD\nY\nE\nD\nY\nY\nE .\nWhile the first term can be estimated as the mean value of the outcome variable of treated\nunits, the second term denotes the \"correct yardstick\"35, which is the unobservable\ncounterfactual result which is the outcome the participants would have experienced, on\naverage, had they not participated.36 This method is termed \"observational\" (or \"non-\nexperimental\") because it uses data of non-participants to infer counterfactual outcomes for\nprogram participants.37 Note that the matching approach only delivers unbiased results if the\nconditional independence assumption (CIA) postulated by Rubin (1977) is fulfilled:\n(\n|\n)\n,\nCIA\nx\nX\nD\nY\nY =\n .\nThe condition describes the situation where participation in the program and potential\noutcome are independent for units with the same set of conditioning variables (X = xi\n). Put\ndifferently, under the CIA the outcomes of country group units are independent of the\nparticipation status, once observable characteristics are controlled for. Assuming this non-\ncorrelation, the selection occurs only on observables. Importantly, the set of conditioning\nvariables completely determines the participation decision: all units, if offered the treatment,\nwould choose to participate. This means that knowledge of the relevant variables suffices to\nconstruct a control group with the desired similarities to the participants.38 The independence\nassumption is a necessary condition because a Heckman correction is not performed in non-\nparametric treatment models. If the CIA is valid \u00ad there are on average no systematic\ndifferences between firms with and without \"official support\" and therefore no selection bias\n\u00ad then E(Y0\n| D = 0, X = xi\n) can reasonably be used as a measure of potential outcome for the\nprogram participants:\n,\n|\n[\n]\n,\n|\nx\nX\nD\nY\nE\nx\nX\nD\nY\nE =\n=\n=\n=\n= .\ndecision cannot be observed among non-participants. These units may have abstained either because they were\nnot invited to participate or because they were rejected by the decision-making body after filing an application;\nThe average effect of treatment on the treated then is:\n,\n|\n[\n]\n,\n|\nx\nX\nD\nY\nE\nx\nX\nD\nY\nE\n=\n-\n=\n=\n= .\nHowever, the CIA is entirely fulfilled only if all variables that influence the participation\nstatus are known as well as quantifiable. This stipulation may not hold for non-experimental\ndata if the treatment decision D depends on additional variables which are not independent of\ngiven X.39 It is, therefore, crucial to emulate the actual decision-making process of the\nsponsoring agency as accurately as possible so that after-the-fact deviations from the agency's\npostulated measurable selection criteria are virtually non-systematic. This set of criteria used\nin matching can be considered a \"filter\" for re-establishing the conditions of an experimental\nsetting. Under the assumptions of matching, the only remaining difference between treated\nunits and members of the control group is program participation.40 However, there may also\nbe non-measurable factors \u00ad for example, information asymmetries among investors \u00ad that\ninfluence the resultant volume of investment. In the absence of such firm-level information, it\nis therefore necessary to assume that, on average, the two groups do not differ in this respect.\nTo characterize similar firms, a large number of their exogenous properties is required in\nlarger samples to ensure validity of the CIA (high \"dimensionality\" of X). This necessity\nrepresents an obstacle to estimating the causal effect because there are hardly any firms that\nare virtually identical in all of their characteristics.41 To overcome this \"curse of\ndimensionality\", the study matches the propensity scores between groups which is the\nprobability that a given project has received treatment, given a set of individual characteristics\nthat are depicted by the conditioning variables:42\nsupport\ncommon\n~\n;\n~\nPr\n]\n|\n[\n\n<\n<\n= X\nX\nx\nfor\nwith\nx\nX\nAs Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983) show, it is sufficient to condition on the one-dimensional\npropensity score to ensure statistical independence between potential outcome and acceptance\ninto the program if the CIA is indeed fulfilled. In this study the propensity scores are obtained\nby a probit estimation of a dummy variable indicating whether or not a given bank is a\nparticipant on all the relevant firm characteristics before the participation decision made by\n43 Common support signifies the ability to find comparable control group units for program participants. There\nwill be a bias if not all projects are on common support; see Heckman et al. (1997), p. 611.\nHaving estimated the propensity scores, each treated unit i is \"paired\" to some group of\n\"comparable\" non-treated units using a certain measure of proximity with respect to their\nscores. There are a number of matching estimators that can be grouped into \"individual\nneighborhood\" (\"one-to-one\" procedure, such as \"nearest neighbor\" or, in case of substantial\ngaps between units, \"caliper\" matching) estimators and those using \"weights\". In the present\nstudy, an estimator from the second group is used since, given the relatively small sample\nsize, there may not be a close-by nearest neighbor, or a \"near-perfect twin\", within the control\ngroup. For this reason, kernel-based matching is applied which represents a weighted average\nover the outcomes of multiple non-treated units in the control group where the weight given\nto non-treated unit j is proportional to the proximity of the observables of units i and j.45 The\nassociated matched outcome is:46\n,\n:\nby\nweighted\noutcome\ns\ngroup'\ncontrol\nthe\nwith\n,\n^\n)\n(\n}\n{\n}\n{\n}\n{\n\u00e5\n\u00e5\n\u00e5\n=\n\n=\n\n=\n\n\u00f7\n\u00f7\n\u00f8\n\u00f6\n\u00e7\n\u00e7\n\u00e8\n\u00e6 -\n\u00f7\n\u00f7\n\u00f8\n\u00f6\n\u00e7\n\u00e7\n\u00e8\n\u00e6 -\n=\n\u00f7\n\u00f7\n\u00f8\n\u00f6\n\u00e7\n\u00e7\n\u00e8\n\u00e6 -\n\u00f7\n\u00f7\n\u00f8\n\u00f6\n\u00e7\n\u00e7\n\u00e8\n\u00e6 -\n=\nD\nj\nj\ni\nj\ni\nij\nj\nD\nj\nj\ni\nj\nj\ni\nD\nj\ni\nh\np\np\nK\nh\np\np\nK\nw\ny\nh\np\np\nK\ny\nh\np\np\nK\ny\nwhere p is the propensity score, h is the bandwidth and K(\u00b7) denotes the Kernel function. In\nthe empirical application the Gaussian Kernel is used.47 Consequently, the difference between\nthe observed outcome and the matched outcome is the treatment effect \u00ad here, the hoped-for\nimpact of involving a multilateral development bank in a banking FDI project.\nPropensity score matching is being increasingly applied in the literature on the firm-level\neffects of foreign takeovers. For example, Pfaffermayr and Bellak (2003) use both nearest\nneighbor and caliper matching to determine the difference in growth of firm size and\nproductivity upon the takeover for Austria, while Ilmakunnas and Maliranta (2003) as well as\nMartins (2003) use \u00ad in addition to applying the regular propensity score matching \u00ad the\n45 In other words, if the weights are derived from a symmetric, non-negative and unimodal kernel, the average\nplaces a higher weight on units close in terms of their characteristics and a lower weight on those with more\ndistant propensity scores; see Heckman et al. (1997), p. 630, where one also finds a good overview of alternative\nrelated \"difference-in-differences\" estimator to determine the post-takeover productivity and\nwage differentials in the Finnish and Portuguese economies, respectively.\n4.3 Exogenous Variables\nAs mentioned before, to obtain the propensity scores a probit regression of the participation\nlikelihood on the units' characteristics, represented by certain exogenous variables, needs to\nbe run. The exogenous variables required to depict the sample projects' characteristics were\nderived by interviewing IFC officials.48 As it turns out, there are five central selection criteria\nthat are regularly applied by IFC's decision-making bodies (name, definition and source of\ncorresponding exogenous variables in parentheses):\nBox 1: Systematically-applied selection criteria for IFC banking projects\n\u00a7 A lack of development of the financial market abroad (CREDGDP, specified as 100\nminus claims on the private sector49 divided by GDP; taken from the World Bank's World\nDevelopment Indicators),\n\u00a7 the quality/stringency of banking regulation and supervision in the host country\n(BANKREG; taken from the database compiled by Barth et al. (2001)50),\n\u00a7 the prior experience of the individual German investor in emerging market FDI\nprojects (EXPERIENCE, a binary choice variable set to equal one if there were at least\nfive previous projects at the decision point; derived from a database of the Deutsche\nBundesbank containing the German FDI stock statistics),\n\u00a7 the investment target's return on assets in % (RETURN; derived from the FDI database),\n\u00a7 the investment target's equity capitalization in % (CAPRATIO; paid-in equity capital51\ndivided by total assets; derived from the FDI database).\n48 Interviews conducted with banking projects officers at the IFC in Washington D.C. on April 17 and 22, 2003.\nNo such interview was solicited from the other multilateral agency included, the EBRD in London, as the\nnumber of German banking FDI projects sponsored exclusively by this multilateral agency only amounted to\nfive (i.e. 25 % of the sub-sample of treated investors). It is to be assumed that EBRD's selection criteria do not\ndiffer substantially from those applied by IFC.\n49 Includes gross credit from the financial system to individuals, enterprises, non-financial public entities not\nincluded under net domestic credit, and financial institutions not included elsewhere.\n50 The scores of BANKREG range from 0 to 20 points and were derived by summing up the individual scores\nassigned to responses to a survey questionnaire distributed among national banking supervisory agencies. The\nsupervisors responded to 16 questions relating to the official supervisory power (sub-classified into prompt\ncorrective action, restructuring power, declaring insolvency power) and 4 questions on supervisory forbearance\ndiscretion. A single point was assigned when the answer was favorable with respect to actual supervisory power;\nof missing data scores were re-calculated using the information contained in the corresponding database). As the\ntwo survey areas of banking supervision are closely intertwined, the two scores were combined into a single one,\ncalled BANKREG here. The non-evaluated Palestine territories were assigned a rating of zero by default.\n51 Note that, due to lack of information, the equity capital could not be risk-adjusted.\nNote that the first two criteria can be termed macroeconomic as they describe the banking\nenvironment in the host countries while the other variables depict characteristics at the firm\nlevel. It cannot be ruled out that in particular cases IFC applies other, not objectively\nmeasurable standards. These subliminal factors are then non-systematic, however.\nThe following table gives an overview of the means, standard deviations and extreme values\nof the variables employed:\nTable 2: Statistical Properties of Exogenous as well as Endogenous Variables\nVariable Observations Mean Std. Deviation Minimum Maximum\nThe negative mean for the return variable may come as a surprise but it should be borne in\nmind that almost all of the projects are at an infant stage and that set-up costs dominate the\npicture. This supposition is substantiated by the wide distribution of capital ratios. Some of\nthe banks were initially financed by equity only (see the maximum of 100%). Tables 8 and 9\n(Appendix) show the descriptive statistics for the treatment and control group, respectively.\n5 Sample Selection\nTo bring about relative homogeneity of investment projects and thus to fulfill the central\nindependence assumption to the greatest possible extent, the sample of host countries was\ncarefully restricted to comparable cases. In doing so, apart from G7, EU and EFTA countries\nas well as Australia and New Zealand, some advanced financial centers such as Hong Kong,\nTaiwan, and Singapore were omitted. Other relatively developed emerging market economies,\nsuch as some of the countries which will accede to the EU, remained in the sample, as did a\nnumber of developing countries in Africa whose financial markets, given private equity flows\ninto the banking sector at least from Germany, are to be called emerging.\npreliminary). Usable firm-level data are available in the Bundesbank's FDI stock statistics\nonly from 1996 onward. The late starting year was chosen, for one thing, to account for\nchanged investor behavior in the aftermath of the Asian crisis. For another, by leaving out\nFDI projects initiated before 1998, it is ensured that in-sample projects in more advanced\ncountries serve rather specialized purposes since the large commercial banks surely entered\nseveral periods beforehand. Next, all majority-owned subsidiaries were eliminated from the\nsample because the MDBs would not co-finance such projects that are dominated by one\ninvestor. Two projects that were unambiguous outliers (their capital-at-risk was greater than\nfull-sample average CAR multiplied by five times the variable's standard deviation) had to be\nexcluded as well.\nAll told, the restricted sample comprises 77 FDI projects undertaken by 21 German\ninvestors52 in 47 emerging financial markets (for a list of countries see Table 7, Appendix).\nOf these projects, 20 were identified to have been co-financed53 by IFC and/or EBRD.54\nUsually, firms solicit the participation of IFC or EBRD shortly after making the initial\ninvestment. Only in rare instances is there a consortium of private and official investors\nseeking to establish a jointly-owned bank abroad.\n6 Empirical Results\n6.1 Absolute Capital-at-Risk\nPropensity score matching is appropriate for testing the hypothesis of this paper because\nit does not require an outcome equation to be estimated. Put simply, the matching method\nignores the question of why a certain bank carried out an FDI project in a given location.\nRather, it simply measures the relevant (i.e. counterfactual-based) difference in the dependent\nvariable given that a certain project was supported by a multilateral development bank.\nApplication of the propensity score matching approach introduced above yields the probit\nestimation and the matching outcome in Table 3.\nNote that both exogenous macro variables turn out to be highly significant for the decision\nwhether a project given its characteristics is to be supported. The variable depicting lack of\nfinancial market development, CREDGDP, is significant even at the 1% level. This finding is\nfully in line with the primary task of IFC in this area which is fostering the establishment of\nprivate banks in underdeveloped financial markets. Prior exposure of investors in emerging\nmarkets also matters for the selection, as the high z-value of EXPERIENCE illustrates. The\n52 While investment targets were restricted to those operating in the financial sector, no such limitation was\nimposed on investors. Nonetheless, only 3 firms investing in 4 different projects abroad were classified as\nbelonging to non-financial sectors.\n53 Eight projects were co-financed by lending, four projects by providing equity capital, and another four projects\nreceived hybrid financing. For the remaining four projects no exact information was available on the type of\ncapital invested.\n54 To the best of the author's knowledge, none of the other MDBs (e.g. the ADB, AfDB, IADB) co-financed\nGerman banking FDI projects over the sample period.\nunexpected lack of significance of the other two firm-level variables may owe something to\neither variable misspecification or the mere fact that the MDBs selected a number of projects\ndespite lackluster performance on these banks' part. It may well be that these variables do not\nmatter as much in the decision-making process after all.\nTable 3: Propensity Score Matching and Treatment Effects (Absolute Capital-at-Risk)\nProbit estimation, matching method: kernel, metric: propensity score, observations: 77, pseudo R2: 0.2265\nVariable Coefficient z-score P>|z|\nTreated Group\nControl Group\nDifference\nThe lower part of Table 3 displays the treatment and matching effects.55 Average capital-at-\nrisk of the treated group of banks after matching was roughly DM 420,000 (or 52.8%) higher\nthan the control group's risk-adjusted investment. This shows that banks are indeed willing to\ninvest more risky funds if the venture is backed by MDB co-financing. Notice that by\napplying the matching routine the hypothetical outcome of the treated banks had they not\nparticipated exceeds the simple mean of the non-participating banks by almost DM 60,000 (or\n8.2% of the initial value) which illustrates that applying matching procedures can make a\ndifference in project evaluation.\nNevertheless, these treatment results still need to be checked for statistical significance.\nBootstrapping can be used to give some idea of the sampling variability of the estimators.56\nThe procedure is performed to determine confidence intervals and is based on the empirical\ndistribution in place of the true population distribution, assuming that the former is a good\nestimate of the latter. The sampling distribution of an estimate is its probability distribution\nunder independent repetitions of the sampling process. Knowledge of this distribution enables\nmeasurement of the precision and bias of the estimate as well as development of confidence\nintervals. Essentially, from the sample N observations are drawn (with replacement), with N\n55 All 77 projects were on common support (results not shown in table); on the notion of common support, i.e. all\ntreated units have a counterpart in the non-treated group, see Blundell and Costa Dias (2000), pp. 445-446.\nequal to total sample size. Next, the resampling procedure is repeated by drawing on total k\ntimes from the actual sample. The number of replications was set at k=1000, which is thought\nto produce generally very good estimates.57 This procedure produces k realizations of the\nestimated treatment effect. For the 90% level of significance, the confidence interval is\nobtained as the distance between the 50th and 950th realizations in the set of ordered estimates.\nFrom the resulting data set of estimated statistics, the standard deviation can be calculated.58\nNote that the estimated statistic is not necessarily a better estimate than the one observed in\nthe original sample. In fact, a bias can be calculated as the difference between those two\nvalues.59 The resulting bootstrap distribution may involve a bias which can be adjusted by the\nprocedure suggested by Efron (1982), who also recommends applying a bias correction if the\nrelation of the bias to the standard deviation is greater than 0.25 (i.e. 25%).\nTable 4: Bootstrap Statistics for Absolute Capital-at-Risk\nVariable Observed Bias Std. Error [90% Confidence Interval] Method\nVariable Observed Bias Std. Error [95% Confidence Interval] Method\nthan this threshold, which means that the bias-corrected bootstrap estimate60 is used. The\nbootstrap outcome demonstrates that the capital-at-risk variable is significant at the 10% level\n58 The following standard formula is used for calculating the standard deviation:\nns.\nreplicatio\nof\nnumber\nestimates,\ned\nbootstrapp\nthe\nof\naverage\n*\n,\nsample\nth\ni\nthe\nusing\ncalculated\nstatistic\n*\n.\n*\n*\n)\n(\n)\n(\n=\n=\n=\n\u00fa\n\u00fa\n\u00fb\n\u00f9\n\u00ea\n\u00ea\n\u00eb\n\u00e9\n-\n-\n\u00e5\nk\ni\nwhere\nk\ni\n\n\n\n\n60 For biased statistics, i.e. where the distribution is non-symmetrical, the bias-corrected method is thought to\nproduce confidence interval with better coverage probability than the alternative percentile method (the results\nof which are consequently suppressed in Table 4); see StataCorp. (2003), p. 118. The bias-corrected intervals can\nbe shown to be \"second-order accurate\", i.e. the errors in matching go to zero faster than when using the normal\nand percentile methods; see Efron and Tibshirani (1993), pp. 184-186 on the application of the bias-corrected\nmethod, and p. 187 on its superiority to the other two methods.\n(CAR is different from zero at that significance level as the confidence interval is greater than\nzero). Another bootstrap at the 5% level did not produce a significant outcome.\n6.2 Size-Adjusted Capital-at-Risk\nOne could object that the significant result presented above is due to differences in project\nsize, i.e. equity capital invested abroad. While there is no indication that either multilateral\nagency has a preference for co-financing relatively large FDI projects \u00ad a disposition which\ncould be driving the estimation outcome \u00ad a conceivable size effect is now removed by\nrelating the absolute values of capital-at-risk to total assets of the investment target.\nTable 5 shows that the treatment effect is still present for the normalized endogenous variable,\nCAR_TA (the unchanged probit estimates were omitted to save space):\nTable 5: Treatment Effect (Size-Adjusted Capital-at-Risk)\nSample (Procedure) CAR_TA\nTreated Group\nControl Group\nDifference\nBy removing the influence of project size, the outcome for treatment effect now amounts to\n80.8%. Notice the strong impact of applying the matching technique. The difference between\nthe observed and the matched hypothetical outcome rises from 8.2% to 29%, now even\nincreasing the treatment effect. As Table 6 illustrates, the outcome becomes significant even\nat the 5% level (again, the bias-corrected estimator needed to be chosen):\nTable 6: Bootstrap Statistics for Size-Adjusted Capital-at-Risk\nVariable Observed Bias Std. Error [90% Confidence Interval] Method\nVariable Observed Bias Std. Error [95% Confidence Interval] Method\n7 Conclusion\nFor the given set of German banking FDI projects in emerging markets the estimation\noutcome verifies the hypothesized positive impact of having a multilateral development bank\nacquire a stake in the foreign business venture. German firms benefiting from co-financing on\npart of a multilateral agency have, compared to their non-sponsored counterparts, invested a\nsignificantly higher amount of equity capital on average (in absolute terms or relative to\nproject size) that is subject to the risk of expropriation or similarly harmful measures\ninstigated by the foreign government. It is the exposure to these specific political risks that the\nnovel endogenous variable of a sovereign risk-adjusted capital position seeks to capture.\nMoreover, the matching approach has been shown to provide meaningfully different results\nthan a simple comparison over across-group averages.\nA word of caution is in order, though. It would be presumptuous to derive general conclusions\nfrom the estimation outcome presented in this paper. Instead, the results should be taken with\na \"grain of salt\" because the number of observations in the sample is undoubtedly quite small.\nNaturally, the treatment effect may be weaker or non-existent when other data sets \u00ad countries\nas well as sectors \u00ad are put to the test. Moreover, the study is based on some arguably bold\nassumptions such as the non-systematic influence of unobserved firm characteristics on\nprogram participation and outcome or the supposed willingness of non-participants to stand\nready for \"treatment\" by the multilateral development banks. Lastly, it remains an open\nquestion whether the observed treatment effect is indeed more widely beneficial at the global\nlevel. While it may well be that the induced rise in FDI increases the utility of the host\ncountry, the risk-mitigating effect of involving MDBs may also lead to moral hazard on the\npart of investors and thus to possible misallocation of capital.\nFurther research will certainly have to be carried out to validate the theoretical considerations\nabout the role of supranational third-party lending or equity participation. Nevertheless, the\nresults of this study should be understood as an initial indication of the effective role\nmultilateral development institutions may play in private foreign investment projects.\nAppendix\nBox 2: IFC selection procedure for co-financing of banking projects in emerging\nmarkets. Condensed protocol of the interviews contacted at IFC in April, 2003.\nIn making a decision on whether to co-finance direct investments in the banking sector of\ndeveloping countries carried out by commercial banks or parastatal development banks, IFC\ntakes into account determinants at the country and sector level as well as data pertaining to the\ninvestment target. Despite applying a number of generally-agreed determinants, the final\ndecision still involves a certain degree of discretion since it is also based on the findings of a\nthorough on-site examination conducted by IFC staff. IFC's internal decision process works\nas follows. First, an investment proposal is made based on basic investment information\nwhich is then refined to a so-called \"project data sheet\" to be submitted for early review to the\ncorporate investment committee. If the tentative verdict on a particular project is favorable, a\nteam of specialists is then sent abroad to examine the actual financial situation of the\ninvestment target and, based on the findings, put together an appraisal report. This document\nrepresents the factual input to an ensuing high-level decision meeting which precedes formal\napproval by IFC's Board of Directors.\nApparently, IFC is of the opinion that a good deal of skepticism is required when interpreting\nbanks' balance sheet and profitability data. Taking information on non-performing loans at\n\"face value\" may be misleading as the standard of \"90 days past due status\" is not\nconsistently enforced across countries. In fact, some countries exhibit great leniency towards\nsuch loan classification, granting banks as much as two years time upon suspension of credit\nservicing to finally grade such loans as non-performing. Eyeballing collateral is potentially\ndeceptive as well since it may not be marketable after all and thus worth less than recorded.\nRegarding banks' provisioning, the loan loss reserves listed in the balance sheets may not be\nconsistent in a cross-country comparison because of internationally differing accounting\ntreatments.\nIn sum, while data on asset quality (non-performing loans or loan loss provisions) and capital\nadequacy (risk-adjusted equity to total assets) may be indicative of trouble ahead, they in turn\ncannot ensure viability of a given project. Foreign equity participation in an emerging market\nbank is likely to guarantee that the direct investment target is not blatantly undercapitalized.\nHowever, a well-capitalized target bank is supposed to be more likely to get selected. Other\nsupposedly reliable measures of bank performance or efficiency of capital invested, if\nmeasured consistently, are return on equity (RoE) or return on (total) assets (RoA).\nFocussing on single efficiency measures and taking into account country and sector\ninformation, the set of factors influencing the investment decision is limited to the following,\nconsistently measurable variables:\n\u00a7 Banking sector abroad: As a general rule, IFC financially supports FDI projects in under-\ndeveloped financial sectors. This means that an investment by a large German commercial\nbank in such a market is as likely to be co-financed as one originated by a parastatal\ndevelopment organization such as Deutsche Investitions- und Entwicklungsgesellschaft\n(DEG). Insufficient development may take various forms pertaining to the degree of\ncompetition or market insufficiencies: dominance by state-owned banks, tantamount to a\nlow share of private sector banks, lack of medium or long-term financing, or a low rate of\ncredit to the private sector relative to GDP. Given availability of data, the latter criterion\nwas chosen for the empirical analysis. Furthermore, markets in which the quality of\nbanking regulation and supervision is rather poor generally run the risk of being neglected\nby IFC. The investigation uses a corresponding data set compiled by Barth et al. (2001).\n\u00a7 German investors: The German company making the initial investment in a foreign bank\nis called the sponsor or, at times, \"technical partner\", whereas the latter term may also\napply to consulting firms not making financial contributions. As the reliability and the\nexpertise of the sponsor by virtue of imposing better corporate governance do matter a\ngreat deal for the project outcome, IFC also takes into account the characteristics of the\nsponsors. Theoretically, ratings could used to distinguish between the quality of investors.\nHowever, most of the German financial institutions are rated investment grade, which\nmeans this selection criterion does not apply. Rather, IFC looks at either the success of\nheretofore joint projects with the Corporation or, in the case of new sponsors, previous\nexperience in doing business in emerging markets. A proxy for such experience is the\nnumber of equity investments (subsidiaries) in emerging markets at the time of IFC's\nselection decision.\n\u00a7 Foreign target banks: Arguably the most important determinant of project success is the\nsoundness and profitability of the foreign bank to be invested in. As has been argued\nabove, one should predominantly try to measure the efficiency of banking operations in\nterms of level and efficient use of capital. Indicators are, therefore, the ratio of paid-in\nequity capital to total assets and the return on total assets. For cross-country consistency,\nthe latter ratio was chosen in the empirical investigation.\nLastly, why are there equity and debt investments? As a general rule, IFC floats equity only if\nthe project is deemed adequately profitable ex-ante (discounted cash flow analysis yielding an\ninternal rate of return of approximately 15%) and if an exit option can be secured. This option\nmay consist in a put-back to the sponsor at book value (or a multiple of earnings) or in the\nrequirement for the mature investment target to go public and achieve a certain trading\nvolume, in which case the put option would be eliminated. Should neither method be viable,\nIFC would consider debt financing, by either senior debt or quasi-equity, i.e. subordinated or\nconvertible debt as well as preference shares.\nTable 7: List of Host Countries in the Sample\nEurope No. of\nUnits\nInitial\nYear\nAvg.
