Self-report and records data for the general population indicate\nthat proximate mental and physical health of minority suicides was at least as poor as that of white suicides.\nMethods: This cross-sectional mortality study uses data from Multiple Cause-of-Death (MCOD) public\nuse files for 1999\u00ad2003 to describe and evaluate comorbidity among black, Hispanic, and white suicides.\nUnintentional injury decedents are the referent for multivariate analyses.\nResults: One or more mentions of comorbid psychopathology are documented on the death certificates\nof 8% of white male suicides compared to 4% and 3% of black and Hispanic counterparts, respectively.\nCorresponding female figures are 10%, 8%, and 6%.

Suicide ranked fourth as a cause of potential\nyears of life lost before age 65 years for (non-Hispanic)\nwhites, seventh for Hispanics, and ninth for (non-His-\npanic) blacks. Suicide is avoidable mortality [2,3], and the\nproximate mental and physical health of decedents is sali-\nent to its understanding. To better comprehend the rela-\ntionship between proximate health and suicide, we\naccessed national vital statistics data to describe and eval-\nuate comorbidity in white, black, and Hispanic suicides.\nUntenable as biological constructs, race and ethnicity are\nsocial constructs with important implications for health\ndisparities and healthcare delivery [4]. Questions about\nthe reliability and validity of multiple cause-of-death data\nadded impetus to our research.\nAlthough we assume that black and Hispanic suicides\nexperienced at least as much proximate mental and phys-\nical illness as white suicides, we expect that medicolegal\nauthorities record less comorbidity on their death certifi-\ncates. This assumption and expectation stem primarily\nfrom comparative survey research on the general US pop-\nulation. A study utilizing the Sample Adult component of\nshowed that blacks and Hispanics report being in worse\nhealth, having more physical limitations and annual bed\ndays, less health insurance coverage, fewer physician vis-\nits, and more unmet mental healthcare needs than whites\n[5]. These groups also compare unfavorably on objective\nmeasures of healthcare access and management [6]. With\nthe focus more specifically on mental health, an analysis\nSurvey showed that blacks had a higher prevalence of\ndepression than whites and Hispanics [7]. An analysis of\ncated no difference in the prevalence of serious psycholog-\nical distress between blacks and whites [8]. While the\nprevalence was equivalent between Hispanics and whites\nat ages 18 through 64 years, it was almost three times\nhigher for Hispanics at ages 65 and older. Limited to a\ncomparison between blacks and whites, the National Sur-\nvey of American Life revealed 45% excess chronicity in\nmajor depressive disorder among blacks [9]. Turning back\nto racial-ethnic treatment disparities, an analysis of the\nCollaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys found\nthat 36% of Latinos and 41% of African-Americans with a\npast-year depressive disorder had received mental health\ntreatment compared to 60% of non-Latino whites [10].\nOur expectation of relative underdocumentation of comor-\nbidity on the death certificates of the minority suicides is\npartially supported by a records-based study [11]. Subjects\nwere adult enrollees in TennCare, Tennessee's Medicaid-\nwaiver managed care program, a public assistance program\nwhich offers equal financial access to all low-income\ngroups [12]. This study found that only 29% of African-\nAmerican suicides and possible suicides, as compared to\n51% of white opposites, used prescribed antidepressants in\nthe year prior to their deaths [11]. The authors interpreted\nthis differential as indirect evidence that serious mood dis-\norders are underdiagnosed or undertreated in African-\nAmericans. However, they acknowledged that African-\nAmericans may have been more likely to receive nonphar-\nmacological therapy than whites, and thus could have been\nless likely to have antidepressant prescriptions filled. They\noperationalized their possible suicides as decedents whose\ndeaths were officially classified under injury of undeter-\nmined intent, and no subjects had a record of chronic psy-\nchosis or serious medical illness.\nMeta-analyses which combine studies of predominantly\npatient samples affirm that both comorbid psychopathol-\nogy and physical disease are suicide determinants [13-16].\nReinforcement comes from two national multiple cause-\nof-death (MCOD) analyses, an Australian suicide study\n[17] and a US replication [18]. Implying high bi-national\nreliability of MCOD data, comparison of their multivari-\nate results revealed identical suicide-associated comorbid-\nities: depression and mood disorders, schizophrenia, and\ncancer. By contrast, gender-specific prevalences of comor-\nbid psychopathology were almost three times as high in\nAustralian suicides. Moreover, the prevalence of comor-\nbid physical disease was twice as high in Australian as US\nmale suicides, and there was 78% excess prevalence\namong Australian female suicides compared to US coun-\nterparts. The magnitude of these prevalence gaps was sur-\nprising, as was the revelation that only among Australian\nsuicides was comorbid psychopathology more prevalent\nthan comorbid physical disease. While both nations are\neconomically and technologically sophisticated democra-\ntion [1,19], life expectancy and healthy life expectancy at\nbirth in Australia exceed US expectancies by approxi-\nmately three years [20,21]. Indeed, the prevalence gaps\nand differential weight of comorbid psychopathology\nindicate that Australian death certificates surpass those of\nthe United States in documenting true comorbidity\namong suicides. We subsequently ascertained that Aus-\ntralian death investigations are more standardized than\nthose in the United States, and that US coders have less\ncapacity than Australian counterparts to access medicole-\ngal records to help resolve outstanding questions [[22];\npersonal communication, Robert N. Anderson, National\nDeath certificates are essential for conducting epidemio-\nlogic surveillance, planning and prioritizing healthcare\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nexpenditures and services, and formulating policy for pre-\nventing traumatic deaths at state and national levels.\nMoreover, mortality data from the National Vital Statistics\nSystem are more universal, standardized, and timely than\ndata from other major health databases [23]. Neverthe-\nless, critics cite persuasive empirical evidence from valida-\ntion studies to charge that death certificates are seriously\nmedical examiners and coroners showed that few had\nreceived any formal training in death certification in their\nmedical school training or residencies [28]. Death certifi-\ncation still receives scant attention in medical school and\nhospital training [29-31]. An additional complicating fac-\ning deficits will impede ascertainment and recording of\ncomorbidity on the death certificates of suicides. We are\nmotivated by these factors and the US-Australian preva-\nlence gaps, as well as by the healthcare utilization litera-\nture, to assess whether comorbidity is underdocumented\nin black and Hispanic suicides relative to white suicides.\nMethods\nMCOD public use files from the National Vital Statistics\nSystem within the National Center for Health Statistics are\nour data source for this cross-sectional mortality study. To\nhelp stabilize age-, gender-, and racial-ethnic-specific\ncomorbidity prevalence estimates, we chose a five-year\nprecoded under the International Statistical Classification of\nDiseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision ICD-10\n[33]. Our study group comprised white, black, and His-\npanic decedents whose underlying cause of death was\nintentional self-harm (X60\u00adX84) or sequelae of inten-\nWe employed a comparison group in order to identify sui-\ncide-associated comorbidities through multivariate analy-\nsis. This group comprised white, black, and Hispanic\ndecedents whose underlying cause of death was uninten-\ntional injury (V01\u00adX59), sequelae of transport uninten-\ntional injury (Y85), or sequelae of other unintentional\ninjury (Y86). We further confined our study and compar-\nison groups to persons who died at ages 15 years or older\nin the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Fifteen years\nwas the minimum age cutoff because suicide was rarely\nreported among children and younger teens [34], who\nconstituted less than 1% of all suicides during the obser-\nvation period. [1] Relevant given the nature of the racial-\nethnic comparisons in this study, Hispanic blacks com-\nprised only 1% of Hispanic suicide subjects. This finding\nholds independent of gender.\nSuicide almost invariably becomes the official underlying\ncause of death when medicolegal authorities rule a death\nas suicide in a timely manner [35]. Concordance between\na suicidal mention on the death certificate and its assign-\nment as the underlying cause approaches 100% [36].\nUnlike deaths attributed to a chronic disease, comorbidity\nenumerated on the death certificates of suicides is almost\nnecessarily antecedent owing to the typically acute nature\nof injury mortality. However, antecedence does not imply\ncausality.\nReplicating the methods of the prior US MCOD suicide\nstudy [18] in a racial-ethnic context, we disaggregated\ncomorbidity into 14 types within two major subheadings:\nmental/behavioral disorders and physical disease. Our\nprevalence calculations drew upon all potential comorbid\nmentions on a death certificate \u00ad up to 20. However, we\ncounted only one condition where more than one was\nassociated with a particular type of comorbidity. Each of\nthe 14 types served as a distinct outcome variable in a\nseries of unconditional logistic regression analyses that we\nperformed to identify suicide-associated comorbidities in\nthe MCOD dataset for whites, blacks, and Hispanics,\nrespectively. We adjusted the odds ratios for age (three\nder. Our results provide a preliminary basis for assessing\nthe reliability of the comorbidity data in relation to sui-\ncide. In a sensitivity analysis we eliminated our covariates,\nage and gender, from the model. All variables derived\nfrom the MCOD database.\nSampling variability was not an issue in this study since\nthe data represented complete counts. However, to allow\nfor random variation in our cross-tabulated prevalence\ndata on suicides, we conducted two series of Chi-square\ntests before reporting on differentials and patterns. Our\nfirst series were two-by-three tests. For each category of\ncomorbidity, distinguishing presence or absence, we sep-\narately assessed statistically significant variation within\ngender and across racial-ethnic groups and age groups,\nrespectively. These results justified our series of two-by-\ntwo tests. In these tests we compared white suicides with\nblack suicides and Hispanic suicides, respectively, within\nspecific comorbidity categories for all ages and also within\neach of our three age groups for each gender. Then sepa-\nrately for each racial-ethnic group within gender, we sim-\nilarly compared cause-specific comorbidity prevalences\nacross these age groups. To assess change in prevalence\nacross age, we simply compared the youngest age group\nwith the middle age group and then the middle group\nwith the oldest group. In the prevalence tables, we identi-\nfied each estimate which was calculated on the basis of a\ncell size with fewer than 20 cases.\nTo address the question of whether comorbidity was rela-\ntively underdocumented on the death certificates of\nminority suicides, we cross-validated selected prevalence\n(page number not for citation purposes)\ndata from our study with corresponding data for 2004\nfrom a CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)\nstudy which utilized the US National Violent Death\nReporting System (NVDRS) [37]. Approximating a real-\ntime environment, the NVDRS combines data from the\noffices of coroners and medical examiners, police reports,\ndeath certificates, toxicology laboratories, and interviews\nwith family and friends of the decedents. Our cross-vali-\ndation was confined to schizophrenia and depression and\nmood disorders, given accessible NVDRS data. We com-\nputed black-to-white and Hispanic-to-white prevalence\nratios for a given type of comorbidity in each study. Then\nfor the two minorities separately, we calculated the ratio\ndifference as a percentage of the initial ratio, which served\nas the criterion standard. The product estimated the\ndegree of underreporting or overreporting of a condition\namong black or Hispanic suicides relative to white sui-\ncides. Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS (ver-\nResults\nPrevalence of comorbidity\nWe first report on differentials in the prevalence of comor-\nbidity documented on death certificates between white\nand minority suicides and also on within-group patterns\n(Tables 1, 2, 3). We highlight only statistically significant\nvariations ( ; p < 0.05). Psychopathology is more than\ntwice as prevalent among white male suicides compared\nto minority counterparts (Table 1). Specifically, 8% of\nwhite male suicides have at least one mention of comor-\nbid psychopathology documented on their death certifi-\ncate, compared to 4% of black male suicides and 3% of\nHispanic male suicides. Corresponding figures for female\nsuicides are 10%, 8%, and 6%. While manifesting less\nminority-majority divergence than in the case of comor-\nbid psychopathology, the prevalence of comorbid physi-\ncal disease documented on the death certificates of male\nsuicides is lower for blacks and Hispanics than for whites.\nAmong female suicides, the prevalence is only lower than\nwhites for Hispanics. Confined to subjects with comor-\nbidity documented on their death certificates, mean\nnumber of mentions does not vary with majority-minor-\nity status.\nTables 2 (males) and 3 (females) show the prevalence of\ndocumented comorbid psychopathology and physical\ndisease disaggregated by age and racial-ethnicity. Comor-\nbidity as a whole increases monotonically with age except\namong Hispanic female suicides. Comorbid physical dis-\nease peaks at the oldest ages. By contrast, comorbid psy-\nchopathology peaks at middle age except among black\nfemale suicides. Hispanic males aside, mood disorders\nand depression predominate among psychopathologies\nirrespective of gender. These conditions are four times\nmore prevalent among white male suicides than corre-\nsponding Hispanics and nearly three times more preva-\nlent than in corresponding blacks. The prevalence of\nmood disorders and depression in white female suicides\nis twice as high as in Hispanic counterparts and 1.5 times\nhigher than in black counterparts. The prevalence of circu-\nlatory disease is relatively high among black female sui-\ncides and white suicides of both genders.\nSuicide-associated comorbidities\nWith odds ratios adjusted for age and sex, and uninten-\ntional injury decedents as the referent, logistic regression\nanalyses of suicide-associated comorbidities reveal many\nsimilarities and some differences across racial-ethnic\ngroups (Table 4). Suicide is positively associated with\nTable 1: Comorbid medical conditions in suicides by gender, racial-ethnicity, category, and measure, United States, 1999\u00ad2003\nMedical Condition (ICD-10)/Measure Males Females\nWhite Black Hispanic White Black Hispanic\nTotal Disorders/Diseases\n* Calculated only for subjects with at least one mention of a comorbid condition on their death certificates.\n**Percentage of suicides with at least one mention of that comorbidity category on their death certificates.\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nTable 2: Prevalence of comorbid medical conditions in male suicides by age, racial-ethnicity, category, and type: United States, 1999\u00ad2003\nWhites Blacks Hispanics*\n* Percentage black is 1.2.\n**Prevalence estimate may be unreliable since it is based on a cell size with less than 20 cases.\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nTable 3: Prevalence of comorbid medical conditions in female suicides by age, racial-ethnicity, category, and type: United States,\nWhites Blacks Hispanics*\nOther communicable\n(A+B residual)\n* Percentage black is 1.3.\n**Prevalence estimate may be unreliable since it is based on a cell size with less than 20 cases.\nTable 4: Logistic regression results for suicide-associated comorbidities in three racial-ethnic groups: United States, 1999\u00ad2003\nWhites Blacks Hispanics\nMedical Condition (ICD-10) Odds\nRatio*\nRatio\nRatio*\nMental/Behavioral Disorders\nPhysical Disease\n* Odds ratios adjusted for gender and categorical age (15\u00ad34; 35\u00ad64; 65+ years).

It is positively associated with\ncancer among whites and blacks only, and with residual\nmental health disorders among whites and Hispanics. A\npositive link between suicide and nervous system disease\nis limited to Hispanics. Although the point-estimated\nodds ratio for suicide-associated mood disorders and\ndepression is strikingly high across all three racial-ethnic\ngroups, black suicides are 61 times more likely than black\nunintentional injury decedents to have such diagnoses\nrecorded on their death certificates. Main results are not\nmodified by the elimination of age and gender as covari-\nates from the basic multivariate model.\nCross-validation\nIn comparing our prevalence data with the criterion stand-\nard, NVDRS data, we are reporting on the two psycho-\npathologies positively associated with suicide in each of\nthe three study groups; namely, mood disorders and\ndepression, and schizophrenia. White suicides in the\nNVDRS register seven times more comorbid mood disor-\nders and depression, under an additivity assumption, and\n14 times more comorbid schizophrenia than white coun-\nterparts in the MCOD dataset (Table 5). Respective black-\nto-white and Hispanic-to-white prevalence ratios indicate\nsubstantial underreporting in the MCOD dataset of\ncomorbid mood disorders and depression for minority\nsuicides relative to white suicides. By contrast, there is evi-\ndence of high relative overreporting of comorbid schizo-\nphrenia.\nDiscussion\nNot limited to patient populations, MCOD data offer a\nunique and enduring record of comorbidity among com-\npleted suicides in the United States. We used these data for\ncomorbidity among suicides in three racial-ethnic groups:\nwhites, blacks, and Hispanics. As we expected, but con-\ntrary to health disparities in the general population, less\ncomorbid psychopathology is documented on the death\ncertificates of black and Hispanic suicides than those of\nwhite counterparts. Collectively, our study and its prede-\ncessors [17,18] make us rather sanguine about the reliabil-\nity of MCOD data in predicting suicide-associated\ncomorbidities. By contrast, we are skeptical about the\nvalidity or, more particularly, the sensitivity of comorbid-\nity that is documented on the death certificates of suicides.\nResting on limited cross-validation with NVDRS data\n[37], we infer that mood disorders and depression,\nalthough not schizophrenia, are profoundly underdocu-\nmented on death certificates for blacks and Hispanics rel-\native to whites.\nEven the NVDRS is likely to be wanting in the documen-\ntation of comorbid psychopathology among suicides. For\nif we emphasize the absolute instead of the relative, psy-\nchological autopsy studies provide compelling evidence\nthat comorbid psychopathology is probably grossly\nunder-documented on the death certificates of suicides\nirrespective of racial-ethnicity and type of disorder. A\nmeta-analysis of 27 of these in-depth studies of record\nreviews and interviews with survivors estimated that 87%\nof suicides had a mental disorder [38]. A systematic\nreview, which included meta-analyses conducted sepa-\nrately on 22 case-control studies and 54 case series,\nreported 90% prevalence of mental disorders in suicide\ncases compared to 27% in controls, and 91% prevalence\nin suicides from the case series [39]. Few of the case-con-\ntrol studies involved US adults.\nHIV was not a determinant of suicide in any of the three\nracial-ethnic groups in our study, even though a 1994\nmeta-analysis identified this disease as a risk factor [13].\nThis finding more refinedly affirmed such a finding from\nTable 5: Prevalence, prevalence ratios, and relative misreporting of selected comorbid mental disorders in black and Hispanic suicides\nusing two data sources, United States\nNational Violent Death Reporting System* Multiple Cause-of-Death Data**\nMental Disorder Prevalence Prevalence Ratio Prevalence Prevalence Ratio\nWhite Black/White Hispanic/White White Black/White Hispanic/White\nRelative Misreporting of Prevalence in Multiple Cause-of-Death Data\nBlacks Hispanics\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nthe first US MCOD suicide study [18]. Posited by the\nauthors of that study as an ex post facto explanation,\nreceipt of effective antiviral therapy could have altered the\nmindset of HIV-positives by removing a hitherto immi-\nnent and grave threat to survival. Thus, if tenable, minor-\nity-majority status may not modify this explanation. To\nthat point, another recent US study attributed a relative\nreduction in HIV mortality to some closure of the life\nexpectancy gap separating blacks from whites [40]. Never-\ntheless, blacks and Hispanics continue to bear a dispro-\nportionate share of the diminishing national HIV/AIDS\nburden [41,42]. The absence of HIV as a suicide determi-\nnant in these groups may be a marker of success by the\nhealthcare system in delivering appropriate therapy to\nminority HIV-positives. Epidemiologists and social scien-\ntists may further clarify the relationship between HIV and\nsuicide utilizing longitudinal data.\nA longitudinal evaluation of race and Hispanic origin on\ndeath certificates indicated excellent agreement between\nself-report and death certificate proxy report for blacks\nand whites and good agreement for Hispanic subgroups\n[43]. Nevertheless, our results could have been distorted\nby racial-ethnic heterogeneity, such as between African-\nAmericans and black Caribbean Americans and native-\nborn and foreign-born Hispanics, respectively\nNational Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related\nConditions showed that Mexican-Americans manifested a\nlower lifetime risk of psychiatric comorbidity than US-\nborn non-Hispanic whites [46]. There was, however, no\ndifferentiation of risk among their foreign-born counter-\nparts.\nRacial-ethnic variation in the respective prevalences of\ncomorbid psychopathology and physical disease may be\nreal, and simply reflect differences in suicide etiology [47-\n53]. Alternatively, the data are consistent with our expec-\ntation that this variation may be partially or wholly arti-\nfactual. Such artifactuality would likely be a function of\ninteractions between family, friends, and acquaintances\nof decedents with medicolegal authorities, variations in\nsocial pressure to withhold psychological information\nacross racial and ethnic groups, and differential fastidi-\nousness with which authorities compile medical records\non suicides. However, this research could not assess the\nmerits or relative contributions of these factors. Beyond\nthe highly restricted comparisons, our cross-validation of\nthe documentation of comorbid psychopathology on\ndeath certificates of suicides was further constrained by\nthe fact that the NVDRS covers only a minority of states \u00ad\nsystem comingles personal reports from family and\nfriends on the proximate mental status of decedents with\ndiagnostic data. Thus, any improvement in the sensitivity\nof documentation of comorbid psychopathology among\nsuicides, rendered by the NVDRS, likely means dimin-\nished specificity.\nGaps between minority and white suicides in comorbidity\nprevalence, which we estimated from MCOD data, are\nattenuated for physical disease compared to psychopa-\nthology. While unable to validate a relative data deficit for\nany physical disease, as we did for two types of psychopa-\nthology, the observed gaps are congruent with previously\ndocumented and variable healthcare utilization and\naccess. Returning to psychopathology, we found no asso-\nciation between alcohol use or other substance use disor-\nders and suicide \u00ad a result mirroring findings from prior\nMCOD studies [17,18]. These relationships are probably\ncomplex. For example, an analysis of data from the 1993\nUS National Mortality Followback Survey showed that\nproblem drinking was positively associated with suicide\nin whites but negatively associated in blacks [55]. A cross-\nnational systematic review of the relationship between\nalcohol use disorders and injury in hospital emergency\ndepartment patients inferred a weak association [56]. In\nour study, positive links between both alcohol and other\nsubstance use disorders and suicide may have been\nmasked by the universal strength of the depression-sui-\ncide nexus or by our conventional choice of unintentional\ninjury decedents as the control population. A study limi-\ntation is that a change in the coding of education in the\nMCOD dataset for 2003 precluded us from incorporating\neducational attainment as a covariate, and as the only\npotentially suitable proxy for socioeconomic status, in our\nregression analyses.\nConclusion\nA comprehensive and accurate record of comorbidity on\ndeath certificates would advance suicide surveillance well\nbeyond the capacity afforded by underlying cause-of-\ndeath information alone. Researchers could utilize\nenhanced data to fortify the evidence base for suicide, not\nonly through improving description, but by better\ninforming etiology, policy, prevention, and evaluation.\nSubstantial amelioration of likely relevant comorbidity\ndocumentation for all racial-ethnic groups would follow\nfrom a formal commitment by medical schools and teach-\ning hospitals to train students and residents in death cer-\ntification, implementation of equivalent in-service\ntraining for practicing providers, and routinization and\nstandardization of timely psychological autopsies in all\ncases of suicide, suspected suicide, and other traumatic\ndeaths of equivocal cause. While these actions would\nimprove understanding of suicide and lead to more effec-\ntive interventions, we predict that some racial-ethnic gaps\nin the documentation of comorbidity among suicides will\npersist as long as access to and utilization of healthcare\nremain incommensurate with need. We plan to expand\nour research by examining comorbidity among possible\nsuicides. Results may have implications for improving the\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nsensitivity of suicide certification across racial-ethnic\ngroups. Attention has been drawn to a racial paradox;\nnamely, that while blacks manifest a risk for suicide equal\nto or greater than that of whites, their suicide rate is less\nthan half [57]. Variable ascertainment of comorbid\ndepression or cancer, for example, might contribute to\nthis paradox through differentially affecting the tipping\npoint where authorities rule a true suicide a suicide.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nIRHR and SS conceived and designed the study.
