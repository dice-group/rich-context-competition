In this context, a question that arises is the evolution of\nthe processes allowing anticipation with regard to the acquisition of knowledge relative to\nspecific situations. We sought to study this question by focusing on boundary extension, the\ntendency to overestimate the scope of a previously perceived scene. We presented to novice,\nbeginner, and expert car drivers road scenes in the form of approach sequences constituting very\nbriefly displayed photographs (i.e., 250 milliseconds each), in order to determine the effect of\nexpertise at an early stage of scene perception. After three presentations, participants had to\njudge whether a fourth photograph was the same, closer up, or further away than the third one.\nWhen experts and beginners showed a classical boundary extension effect, novices presented no\ndirectional memory distortion.

This phenomenon is known as\nboundary extension (BE; Intraub & Richardson, 1989; e.g., Intraub, 2012, for a review) and\nrefers to the tendency to overestimate the scope of a previously perceived scene, with the\nobserver's memory including information relative to the information likely to have been just\noutside the original scene's boundaries.\nWhile this phenomenon is often described as an error relative to the content of a\npreviously perceived scene, it nevertheless presents an important adaptive value; indeed, it\nenables the VS to realize good predictions relative to the information present just beyond the\nedges of a view (e.g., Intraub & Dickinson, 2008). Moreover, BE is observed both with\nparadigms that simulate visual scanning--that is, with photographs presented for\ndurations commensurate with an eye fixation (250 milliseconds) and with retention\nintervals imitating a saccade (42 milliseconds)--and with saccade-contingent paradigms in\nwhich the phenomenon is tested after an actual saccade (e.g., Intraub & Dickinson, 2008).\nTheoretically, this observation is significant as it suggests that anticipating the upcoming\nlayout plays a role in the process of visual integration. It also suggests that BE\nparticipates in coherent and continuous representations of the surrounding world (e.g.,\nIntraub & Dickinson, 2008), for instance, by priming the visual perception of the\nupcoming layout (Gottesman, 2011). To account for the rapid deployment of BE, Intraub\nand Dickinson (2008) suggested that the phenomenon should not result from an ad hoc\nextrapolation process, but may be deployed during scene understanding, the detection of\nlayout automatically activating a larger spatial framework. Thus, this phenomenon has been\nobserved in various situations, such as situations in which one can expect good memory (e.g.,\nwith low memory loads, cf., Munger, Owens, & Conway, 2005), during the life span (Seamon,\nSchleger, Heister, Landau, & Blumenthal, 2002), or in the haptic modality. In this last case,\nBE has been observed in equivalent proportions between blindfolded-sighted subjects and a\nblind-and-deaf observer, who was also considered as a ``haptic expert'' (Intraub, 2004). The\nfact that BE has been generalized to other sensory modalities suggests that anticipating the\nupcoming layout is a fundamental aspect of scene representation. More recently, Intraub,\nMorelli, and Gagnier (2015) even suggested that observation of BE in different sensory\nmodalities underlies a unitary scene representation.\nThese observations led Intraub and her colleagues to develop an alternative model to\nthe traditional visual-cognitive model of scene perception, the Multisource model\n(e.g., Intraub, 2012). Contrary to the traditional model that argues that scene perception\nrelies on a single source of information, that is, the visual input, the Multisource model\npostulates that scene perception relies on different sources of information, with spatial\ninformation at its core. This model is thus close to grounded cognition theories (e.g.,\nBarsalou, 2008) insofar as it considers that the observer is part of the scene he or she\nperceives. During perception, the egocentric framework generated by spatial information is\n``filled in'' by other sources of information, such as visual and amodal information, the\nfunction of the latter being to continue the textures and surfaces of the scene just beyond\nthe edges of the perceived view. Moreover, during the first fixation on a view, the rapid\nidentification of the semantic category (i.e., gist) to which the perceived scene belongs (e.g.,\nPotter, 1976) activates conceptual and contextual knowledge that generate expectations\nrelative to its surroundings (Intraub, 2012). Thus, the extrapolation process would occur\nduring scene perception (e.g., Intraub & Dickinson, 2008) by continuing the surfaces and\ntextures of the scene just beyond the edges of the view in an amodal form (i.e., abstract).\nWhen the stimulus disappears, the observer encounters difficulty in discriminating the\nextrapolated information (abstract) from the visual information (concrete), resulting in\nspatial layout extrapolation. In this regard, BE is apprehended as a source monitoring\n2 i-Perception\nerror (Johnson, Hashtroudi, & Lindsay, 1993), in which a part of the internally driven\ninformation is combined with external information.\nAccording to the Multisource model (Intraub, 2012), top-down expectations derived from\nconceptual and contextual knowledge would play a central role in spatial layout extrapolation.\nWhile the literature stresses the importance of knowledge relative to the gist of the perceived\nscene in the BE process, a question that arises is whether spatial layout extrapolation is\nmodulated by the knowledge the observer has of the perceived scenes. The cognitive\nexpertise paradigm seems relevant to address this question. Indeed, it permits variation in\nthe amount of information available in LTM by contrasting novices and experts in a\nparticular field. It is well known that expert knowledge modifies the perception of scenes\ndepicting the perceiver's field of expertise, experts processing these scenes more effectively\nthan novices (e.g., Didierjean & Gobet, 2008, for a review). This cognitive advantage\nmanifests itself, for instance, with a larger visual span (Reingold, Charness, Pomplun, &\nStampe, 2001), the activation of automatic and parallel encoding procedures (Reingold,\nCharness, Schultetus, & Stampe, 2001), or the tendency to anticipate more than novices the\nprobable evolution of the perceived situations (e.g., Didierjean & Marme\nIn this study, we chose to compare the performances of novices and experts in the field of\ncar driving. In most domains, age covaries with expertise. In addition to the two groups of\nsubjects, we thus tested a third group of beginners belonging to the same novice age class.\nIf we obtain an effect of expertise on BE, this group will enable us to determine whether the\nobserved effect results from an effect of age or from an effect of the amount of information\navailable in LTM.1 Moreover, as semantic knowledge related to the perceived scene is\nactivated quickly after scene apparition (e.g., Davenport & Potter, 2004), we chose to test\nthe effect of expertise at an early stage of scene perception by presenting road scenes for short\npresentation durations (250 milliseconds). To increase the ecological value of our stimuli, we\ndecided to present the scenes in the form of approach sequences, a choice motivated by the\nfact that these sequences transmit the dynamic information acquired during real driving\nsituations better than the same stimuli presented in a static form. Indeed, expert\nknowledge is often highly contextualized and influences behavior only in very ecological\nsituations (e.g., Didierjean et al., 2014). Consequently, we used an adapted version of the\ncamera distance paradigm (CDP; e.g., Intraub & Dickinson, 2008) developed by Munger\net al. (2005) to determine whether BE and RM are related phenomena. In Munger et al.'s\nexperiment, photographs were presented not in isolation, as in the classical version of the\nparadigm, but with sequences designed in such a way as to elicit RM by depicting an induced\napproach motion of the self. These sequences involved the display of three photographs that\nremained on screen very briefly. Each photograph was displayed for 250 milliseconds,\nfollowed by the presentation of a blank screen for 250 milliseconds (Figure 1).\nImmediately after the end of the sequence, a fourth photograph appeared and the observer\nwas asked to judge whether this photograph was closer up, further away, or strictly the same\nas the last photograph in the sequence. The authors found not an RM effect (which would\nhave manifested itself by remembering the last scene of the sequence as a closer up view)\nbut rather a BE effect, leading them to suggest that gist information within a scene is\nprocessed before movement. They also observed variations of BE patterns on approach\nsequences as a function of individual differences in BE ratings obtained with single\nphotographs. Indeed, the participants who extended boundaries with single photographs\nshowed a trend toward less BE with approach sequences, whereas participants who did\nnot extend boundaries (i.e., boundary restriction [the effect opposite to BE] or no\ndirectional distortion) of photographs presented in isolation showed BE with approach\nsequences. These observations suggest that BE is modulated by individual differences.\nMe\n\u00b4ne\n\u00b4trier et al. 3\nIn this sense, one can wonder whether differences in expert knowledge may be a factor of\nvariation in spatial layout extrapolation.\nOur first objective is to replicate the observations realized by Munger et al. (2005).\nAccording to these authors, BE seems to occur before RM in this ``competitive'' situation\nbetween both effects, and we expect a BE phenomenon in all expertise levels. Our second\nobjective is to test how BE is modulated by expert knowledge. Indeed, (a) as stated by the\nMultisource model (Intraub, 2012) which postulates that knowledge plays a central role in\nspatial layout extrapolation, and (b) as a result of the important amount of knowledge\navailable in experts' LTM (e.g., Didierjean & Gobet, 2008), we expect greater BE first in\nexperts and then in beginners.\nMethod\nParticipants\nFifty-six subjects took part in the experiment and were divided into two groups according to\ntheir car driving expertise level:\n\u00ad 20 novices (mean age \u00bc 19; SD \u00bc 1 year 4 months) who were students at the University of\nFranche-Comte\n\u00b4 (France) and who had never taken driving lessons.\n\u00ad 20 beginners (mean age \u00bc 21; SD \u00bc 2 years) who were students at the University of\nFranche-Comte\n\u00b4 (France) and had had their driving licences for 2 years on average\nFigure 1. Depiction of a trial. Each trial was initiated by a 600-millisecond central fixation point before the\napproach sequence appeared on screen. The sequences constituted three briefly presented photographs, and\nparticipants had to compare the scope of a fourth picture to the third.\n4 i-Perception\n\u00ad 16 experts who were driving instructors (mean age \u00bc 39; SD \u00bc 9 years 1 month), and who\ndeclared that they had been giving driving lessons for 10 years on average (SD \u00bc 8 years).\nThe choice of car driving instructors was motivated by the fact that they spend a lot of\ntime on the road.\nAll participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. None was informed of the\nobjectives of the experiment, and all of them gave their consent verbally.\nMaterials\nThe experiment was presented on a 15-inch-screen MacBook Pro computer and was run by\nPsyscope software. During the experiment, participants were seated approximately 50 cm\nfrom the computer screen.\nStimuli\nTen approach sequences constituting three photographs were created for this experiment.\nEach photograph depicted road scenes perceived from the driver's viewpoint and began with\na wide-angle version of the scene before finishing with a close-up version of the same scene.\nThe second photograph (medium version) was realized by cropping the wide-angle version by\napproximately 30%, and the third photograph of the sequence (close-up version) was realized\nby cropping the medium version by about 30%. Each photograph was screen-centered and\nmeasured 14 \u00c2 10 cm. An additional sequence was presented during the familiarization phase.\nProcedure\nWe used an adapted version of the CDP to approach sequences developed by Munger et al.\n(2005). In this version of the paradigm, each of the photographs constituting the sequence\nwas displayed very briefly, for 250 milliseconds, and the ISIs also lasted 250 milliseconds\n(cf. Figure 1). Two hundred and fifty milliseconds after the disappearance of the last\nphotograph of the sequence, a fourth photo appeared on screen. The subject's task was to\ncompare the scope of the fourth stimulus to that of the third, by indicating on a 5-point scale\nwhether this fourth photograph was strictly the same (0 value of the scale), a closer up version\n(a little: \u00c01; much: \u00c02), or a wider angle version (a little: 1; much: 2) of the third photograph.\nAs in Munger et al.'s (2005) procedure, which did not use distractors (i.e., closer up and wider\nangle versions of the third photograph during boundary rating), the test photograph was\nalways strictly the same as the third photograph and stayed on screen until the subject\nvalidated his or her answer (e.g., Gagnier & Intraub, 2012, for a version of the CDP\nwithout distractors). BE occurred when this photograph was judged to be closer up. Each\nsequence was preceded by a central fixation point of 600 milliseconds. Participants were\nexposed to the familiarization phase before individually completing 10 trials in a random order.\nResults\nFigure 2 represents the mean boundary ratings observed for each expertise level. To\ndetermine whether a memory distortion occurred, we computed the .95 confidence\nintervals (represented by error bars). If the mean boundary rating does not differ\nsignificantly from zero, no directional memory distortion has occurred. However, a\nsignificant negative value indicates that the observers' representation included more\nMe\n\u00b4ne\n\u00b4trier et al. 5\nbackground than the original picture, suggesting a BE effect. Conversely, a significant\npositive value shows that the observers' memory included less background, demonstrating\na boundary restriction effect. The mean boundary ratings observed for each expertise level\nare presented in Figure 2. While results indicate no directional distortion in novices, they\nreveal a BE effect in beginners and experts.\nAn ANOVA computed on subjects' mean boundary ratings with Expertise as a between-\ncomparisons computed on novices' and beginners' mean boundary ratings indicated an\neffect of Expertise, t(38) \u00bc 2.09, p < .05, d \u00bc .66. Besides, the comparison of beginners' and\nexperts' mean boundary ratings permitted us to ensure that the effect observed was not due to\nage, a factor that covariates with expertise. The results showed equivalent mean boundary\nratings between these two groups of subjects, t(34) \u00bc 0.926, ns.\nDiscussion\nThe principal objective of this study was to test the effect of expert knowledge on spatial\nlayout extrapolation. We proposed a BE task during which road scenes were presented in the\nform of approach sequences to car drivers with different levels of expertise: novices,\nbeginners, and experts. The results of the present study partially corroborate Munger\net al.'s (2005) findings as they reveal a prevalence of BE and an absence of an RM-like\neffect. Moreover, BE appeared to be sensitive to expert knowledge with beginners and\nexperts extrapolating spatial layout, whereas no directional memory distortion was\nobserved in novices. These results indicate that expert knowledge is a source of\nexpectations likely to modulate BE. Analogous to Munger et al.'s (2005) findings, one\npossible explanation is that beginners and experts may have incorporated a part of the\nlarger spatial context perceived in the wide-angle version of the scene into their memory in\nequivalent proportions. This may have resulted in a source monitoring error (Johnson et al.,\n1993) in which the observers were unable to discriminate the contextual information acquired\nFigure 2. Mean boundary ratings observed as a function of expertise level. Error bars represent the\nconfidence intervals (.95). Significant negative values indicate boundary extension.\n6 i-Perception\nat the beginning of the approach sequence from the visual information actually depicted in the\nlast photograph of the sequence. Given the contingencies of the BE task presented here, this\ninterpretation differs slightly from the explanation traditionally provided by the Multisource\nmodel, which postulates that source monitoring errors causing BE result from a difficulty in\ndiscriminating external (i.e., visual and concrete) information from internally driven\ninformation (i.e., extrapolated information, which is abstract in nature). These observations\nsuggest that BE is explained by a source-monitoring error which, depending on the tasks or the\nsituations, may involve confusion between external and internal information in some cases and\nin others, as in the present study, a confusion between two external (i.e., concrete) sources of\ninformation.\nThe absence of directional memory distortion in novices can be linked to the\nobservations realized by Bla\n\u00a8 ttler, Ferrari, Didierjean, and Marme\nstudy that aimed to examine the effect of expertise on RM, the authors proposed a\nclassical RM task during which they presented simulated aircraft landing scenes to\nnovices and experts (i.e., expert pilots from the French Air Force). While experts\nshowed a classical RM effect, novices surprisingly showed no memory distortion. The\nauthors interpreted this result as reflecting the weight of specific knowledge in motion\nextrapolation. They argued that while RM is a particularly robust phenomenon\n(Hubbard, 2015) that has been observed in many different situations (but see Kerzel,\n2003), in the vast majority of studies, the observers were not actually real novices\nrelative to the scenes presented. In their experiment, which used visual simulations based\non synthesized images of aircraft landing scenes seen from the pilot's viewpoint, novices\nwere ``true'' novices and the RM effect was not observed. However, in our study, the\naccurate memory observed in novices can hardly be interpreted as a lack of semantic\nknowledge relative to road scenes as these scenes are familiar to novices, at least as\npassengers (e.g., Jordan & Hunsinger, 2008). As Me\n\u00b4 ne\nobserved BE in novices with still road photographs displayed for 5 seconds, it seems\nmore plausible to suppose that BE in novices has not had sufficient time to develop.\nHowever, given that Munger et al. (2005) showed that BE is affected both by stimulus\ntype (still photograph vs. approach sequence) and the individual differences in BE ratings\nwith single photographs (i.e., baseline BE), this hypothesis must be treated with caution.\nThe mechanisms affecting BE in approach sequences (e.g., priming effect as a result of the\npresentation of a wider-angle version of the to-be-memorised scene) deserve further\nresearch, including the field of expertise. Indeed, one limitation of the present research\nis that it did not include a baseline BE rating, as in Munger et al.'s study.\nThus, our findings suggest that expert knowledge modulates BE. The equivalent spatial\nlayout extrapolation observed in beginners and experts suggests that drivers quickly become\nsensitive to the semantic information depicted by road scenes. The absence of directional\ndistortion in novices leads us to question whether they extrapolate spatial layout at a later\nstage of scene perception, given that the scenes remained on screen only briefly (750\nmilliseconds). Indeed, using still road photos, Me\n\u00b4 ne\n\u00b4 trier and Didierjean (2013) observed BE\nin driving novices at a later stage of scene perception (5 seconds). Moreover, in the present\nexperiment, novices verbally reported having perceived no difference between the last image of\nthe approach sequence and the test photograph. This might be explained by the perceptual\nadvantage classically observed in experts; that is, experts process the scenes depicting their field\nof expertise more effectively than novices (e.g., Reingold, Charness, Schultetus, et al., 2001).\nAnalyzing the time course of BE may enable us to determine the evolution of the extrapolation\nprocess during scene perception as a function of expertise, a question that seems all the more\nrelevant as BE occurs very quickly (e.g., Dickinson & Intraub, 2008).\nMe\n\u00b4ne\n\u00b4trier et al. 7\nIn conclusion, this study suggests that expert knowledge is involved in BE. Indeed, BE was\nobserved only in car drivers. The effect of expertise on BE suggests that the amount of\nknowledge available in LTM affects the spatial layout extrapolation process for scenes\ndepicting the field of expertise of the observer at an early stage of scene perception. One\nquestion that arises from these observations, then, is whether BE requires more time to be\ndeployed in nondrivers. Analyzing the time course of the phenomenon may help to answer\nthis question. Moreover, an equivalent amount of BE was observed between beginners and\nexperts, suggesting that the advantages of specific knowledge on the perception of scenes\ndepicting the observer's field of expertise emerge quickly. Such a mechanism seems adaptive\nin nature, enabling subjects to process the environment in which they are embedded\nmore effectively.\n"
