Three hundred fifty-four (167 male)\nyoung adults participated in multiple iterations of a public goods game under intergroup\nand individual competition conditions.

We extended\nthese findings by showing that men's investment in the in-group varied dynamically by\ncondition depending on the outcome of the previous trial: In the group condition, men, but\nnot women, decreased spending following a win (i.e., earning an in-group bonus). In the\nindividual condition, men, but not women, increased spending following a win.

Boys and men form and\nSex differences in in-group cooperation\nmaintain large, well integrated groups more easily than do girls and women, especially\nwhen competing against other same-sex groups (Browne, 2007; Geary, Byrd-Craven,\nHoard, Vigil, and Numtee, 2003; Lever, 1976). Men compete intensely for position within\nthese groups, but once a dominance hierarchy is established, they typically maintain\nfriendly relationships with all in-group members and become increasingly skilled at\ncoordinating group behavior. (Parker and Seal, 1996; Rose and Rudolph, 2006; Savin-\nWilliams, 1987). Men are also more sensitive than women to between-group hierarchies\nand posses stronger biases against out-groups, especially during conflict (Sidanius, Pratto,\nand Bobo, 1994; Sidanius, Pratto, Mitchell, 2001; Van Vugt, De Cremer, and Janssen,\n2007). These sex differences have been implicated, at least indirectly, in many real world\nphenomena, ranging from sports fandom (Winegard and Deaner, 2010) to ethnic conflict\n(Thayer, 2009) and suicide terrorism (Atran, 2003; Ginges, Hansen, and Norenzayan,\nTo the extent that sex differences in ease of coalition formation and associated\ncognitions are related to an evolutionary history of male-male coalitional competition\n(Geary, 2010), they should be especially pronounced during competitions with other\ngroups. Indeed, intergroup competition has been shown to increase cooperation in an\neconomic game (Bornstein, Gneezy, and Nagel, 2002), and one proximate reason for this\nseems to be a motivation to help the in-group (rather than a motivation to harm the out-\ngroup; Halevy, Bornstein, and Sagiv, 2008). Van Vugt, De Cremer, and Janssen (2007)\nused a public goods game to experimentally study sex differences in in-group cooperation.\nAs elaborated below, when men believed they were competing against a rival group, they\nmade larger contributions to their group than they did when there was no rival group.\nWomen's contribution to their group, in contrast, did not vary with cues indicating the\npresence or absence of a rival group. Van Vugt and colleagues' studies confirm that men's\nbias toward in-group cooperation is heightened during between-group competitions but\nthey only tested this bias in a one-shot public goods game. The relative balance between\nselfish and altruistic decisions can change dynamically across iterations of these types of\neconomic games, contingent on the outcomes of previous trials (Axelrod and Hamilton,\n1981; Monterosso, Ainslie, Toppi, Mullen, and Gault, 2002). Thus, we extended Van Vugt\net al.'s procedure to include multiple trials and experimentally manipulated trial outcomes,\nand explored potential mediators and moderators of individual and sex differences in level\nof in-group cooperation.\nIntergroup vs. Intragroup Competition\nSocial psychologists have documented the ease with which people demonstrate in-\ngroup favoritism and form biases against out-group members. (Billig and Tajfel, 2006;\nDiehl, 1990; Sidanius and Ekehammar, 1983). When in-group members are presented with\nan external threat, it may be especially important for them to cooperate with one another to\ndeal effectively with the threat. Because men were more likely to be participants in\nintergroup conflict during hominid evolution (and during written history) (Geary, 2010;\nPinker, 2011), they should exhibit stronger group biases than women. As noted, Van Vugt\net al. (2007) tested and confirmed this hypothesis using a one-shot public goods game.\nMore precisely, in the Van Vugt et al. (2007) study, men and women were assigned\nto one of two conditions consisting of six-person, same-sex groups. Each individual began\nwith an endowment of approximately four dollars, which could be kept or invested publicly\nSex differences in in-group cooperation\nin the group. If the group of six individuals contributed approximately 16 dollars to the\ngroup, each individual would receive a bonus of approximately eight dollars. However, if\nthe public investment failed to reach 16 dollars, each individual would lose the money they\nchose to invest publicly, while keeping the portion they kept for themselves. Participants in\nthe individual condition were told the experiment was being conducted at 10 different\nuniversities in England and were told that researchers were interested in how well\nindividuals performed. Instructions were the same in the group condition with one\nexception: participants were told that the researchers were interested in how well student\ngroups performed relative to groups at rival universities. The authors hypothesized that this\nwould induce a coalitional psychology among group members (i.e., they would perceive\nstudent groups at rival universities as an out-group). Results showed that men cooperated\nsignificantly more in the group condition than in the individual condition, whereas\nwomen's level of cooperation was similar across conditions. These results were robust\nwhether individuals participated in a binary (i.e., invest all or none in the public domain) or\ncontinuous (i.e., invest any desired amount in the public domain) public goods game.\nThis evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that men's cooperative behaviors are\nmore sensitive to group competition than are women's. However, Van Vugt et al. (2007)\ndid not assess cooperative behavior across multiple trials. Given the temporal dynamics of\nbetween-group competition, a one-shot game is not likely to fully capture the real world\ntemporal trade-offs involved in deciding whether to act altruistically or selfishly. In fact,\ngiven the unpredictability of these dynamics (Monterosso et al., 2002), economic games\nmay never fully capture real life decision making. Nevertheless, an iterated public goods\ngame provides a much needed extension of Van Vugt et al.'s experimental paradigm.\nUnderlying Sociocognitive Differences\nMen in one of Van Vugt et al.'s (2007) group conditions reported heightened in-\ngroup identification that in turn mediated their increased in-group investment relative to the\nindividual condition. There are also stable individual and sex differences in sociocognitive\nprocesses that may contribute to the sex difference in cooperative, group dynamics. (Geary,\n2010). Women, for example, generally score higher on tests of empathy and religiosity than\ndo men (Baron-Cohen, Knickmeyer, and Belmonte, 2005; Stark, 2002). This may bias\nwomen to consider the welfare of group members when competing both individually and\nagainst a group. Men, on the other hand, generally score higher on social dominance scales,\nwhich reflect sensitivity to dominance and competition (Levin, 2004). Especially relevant\nto coalitional psychology, Haidt and Graham (2007) have identified five dimensions of\nmoral reasoning, three of which are directly linked to between group psychology.\nSpecifically, the moral foundations of loyalty, authority, and purity define rules and\nobligations for treatment of in-group members and for maintaining group stability (see also\nHaidt, 2007). Two of the five dimensions, i.e., care and fairness, appear to reflect broader\nconcerns, beyond the in-group, regarding the care and protection of the vulnerable and the\nequal distribution of resources and rights. We explored whether individual differences on\nmeasures of these five dimensions of morality mediated individual or sex differences in\nsensitivity to between group competition.\nCurrent Study\nSex differences in in-group cooperation\nThe current study was designed to extend Van Vugt et al.'s (2007) finding that men\ncooperate relatively more in conditions of group threat whereas women's cooperation with\nother members of the in-group is not influenced by a perceived group threat. We extended\ntheir procedure in two ways. First, we used an iterated public goods game that allowed us\nto provide false feedback on the level of cooperation of other group members. Second, we\nadministered a battery of sociocognitive measures designed to find potential moderators\nand mediators of individual and sex differences in cooperation and sensitivity to between\ngroup competition.\nMaterials and Methods\nThe participants were 354 undergraduates (167 male) at a large Midwestern public\nuniversity. They were recruited to participate in same-sex groups of six, but many\nscheduled participants did not keep their appointments, resulting in group sizes ranging\nbetween two and six (M = 4.3, SD = 1.2, Table 1). Written consent was obtained from all\nparticipants.\nTable 1. Group Sizes\nGroup\nSize\nNumber of\nGroups (%)\nNumber of\nParticipants (%)\nPublic Goods Game\nEach participant engaged in a computer-based public goods game. Participants were\ngiven $3 and were instructed that they could keep this money or choose to invest some or\nall of it in the group. All participants made their investment to the group using a computer\nkeyboard, with computers separated by dividers so that other participants would not be able\nto see how much they invested. If the group invested a total of $12 or more, they would\nreceive a $5 bonus on top of whatever amount they chose not to invest into the group fund.\nIf fewer than 6 individuals showed up for the experiment, participants were told that the\nunoccupied computers made contributions to the group based upon the average responses\nthat previous participants had given. However, all participants, regardless of group size,\nwere actually given predetermined feedback about whether or not the group had\ncontributed enough money for the $5 bonus. Participants underwent three trials of this\ngame, following the experimental design shown in Figure 1; participants were informed\nthat the third trial determined the amount of money the participant received (see appendix\nfor full participant instructions).\nSex differences in in-group cooperation\nFigure 1. Experimental design\nGroup Prime\nParticipants were randomly assigned to either a group or an individual condition. In\nthe former, participants were told that the study in which they were participating was part\nof a larger experiment that included all of the schools in their university's athletic\nconference, including some of the university's principle rivals. In this condition, as the\nparticipant played the public goods game, the logo of each university in the athletic\nconference remained visible at the top of the computer screen throughout. Participants were\ninformed that the researchers were interested in how well student groups at this university\nperformed at different tasks compared to groups of students at these other universities.\nIn the individual condition, participants were still informed that the study in which\nthey were participating was part of a larger experiment that included all of the schools in\ntheir university's athletic conference, but without mention of the university's rivals or any\nvisible university logos. Participants were informed that the experimenters were interested\nin how well students individually performed at different tasks.\nSociocognitive Measures\nThe following scales were used to explore potential sociocognitive mediators or\nmoderators of sex and individual differences in investment patterns. Participants filled out\nthe scales in random order after completing the experimental portion of the study.\nSocial dominance orientation scale. This scale measures the extent to which an\nindividual prefers inequality between social groups. The SDO contains 14 questions each\nof which are answered on a 1(very negative) to 7 (very positive) scale. Questions include,\n\"Some groups are simply not the equals of others,\" and \"To get ahead in life, it is\nsometimes necessary to step on others.\" (Pratto et al., 1994).\nSex differences in in-group cooperation\nQuest scale. The 12 item Quest scale measures the degree to which an individual's\nreligious beliefs involve an open ended view of the existential dilemmas of life. Each\nquestion ranges from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (9). Questions include, \"As I\ngrow and change, I expect my religion also to grow and change.\" (Batson and Schoenrade,\nReligious fundamentalism scale. The 12 item scale measures the degree to which an\nindividual believes his or her religious beliefs to be the intrinsic and inherent truth about\nhumanity and god. Individuals who score highly on this scale tend to believe that there are\nforces opposed to their religious beliefs and that these forces must be vigorously fought and\ndefeated. They also believe that those who act in accordance with the fundamentals of their\nreligion have a special relationship with god. The scale ranges from strongly disagree (-4)\nto strongly agree (4). Items asked on the scale include, \"God has given humanity a\ncomplete, unfailing guide to happiness and salvation, which must be totally followed.\"\nMoral foundations questionnaire. The 30 item scale assesses valuation of five\nmoral dimensions: whether an act causes harm or provides care (harm/care), whether an act\nis unjust or fair (fairness/reciprocity), whether an act shows disobedience or respect of\nauthority (authority/respect), whether an act is carnal or pure (purity/sanctity), and whether\nan act shows betrayal or loyalty (in-group/loyalty). The first 15 items ask how relevant\ncertain statements (e.g. \"Whether or not someone acted unfairly\") are in deciding whether\nor not something is right or wrong. These are answered using a 0 (not at all relevant) to 5\n(extremely relevant) scale. The second set of 15 items asks the participant to rate their\nagreement with a series of statements. Each question is also answered using 0 (strongly\ndisagree) to 5 (strongly agree) scale. Items in this section of the questionnaire include, \"I\nam proud of my country's history\" and \"Justice is the most important requirement for a\nsociety.\" (Graham, Haidt, and Nosek, 2009).\nResults\nSpending by Group and Sex\nThe first spending trial yielded findings similar to Van Vugt et al.'s (2007) one-shot\nexperiment. Analyzing spending on this trial as an all or nothing decision (coded as 1 if the\nparticipant invested all $3 in the group and coded as 0 otherwise), yielded a significant sex\nby group-prime interaction using logistic regression (z = 2.05, p = 0.04).\nSex differences in in-group cooperation\nFigure 2. First-trial sex differences in the percent of individuals who invested all of their\nmoney in the group\nThe interaction was not significant, however, when spending was analyzed as a continuous\nSpending Across Trials\nA multilevel model with sex, group prime, and two outcome variables were used as\npredictors of investment in the public good (measured continuously). The first outcome\nvariable was whether the participant had won (i.e., received a payout of $5 because the\ngroups' combined contribution was > $12) in the immediately preceding trial and the\nsecond was whether the participant had lost in the immediately preceding trial (coded as 1\nif the participant had lost in the immediately preceding trial and coded as 0 otherwise). The\nparameter estimates for these effects are displayed in Table 2. These indicate a main effect\nfor previous loss (individuals contributed more after a loss). A nonsignificant trend toward\na sex by previous win interaction indicated that, in the individual condition, men gave more\nafter a win relative to women.\nSex differences in in-group cooperation\nTable 2.

This interaction is shown in Figure 3 (this same interaction remains\nsignificant when individuals' first and second trials only are considered in the model or\nwhen only their second and third trials are considered in the model, and can be seen when\ndata are plotted across trials given participants' previous win/loss feedback, condition, and\nsex; Appendix: Figures 4 and 5). The `No' trials on the x-axis indicate contributions on the\nfirst trial of the experiment or on the second trial, if their group did not contribute enough\nto win the bonus on the first trial. The `Yes' trials are contributions immediately after their\ngroup won the bonus. On trials following a win, women invested similarly whether or not\nSex differences in in-group cooperation\nthey were exposed to the group prime. Men, however, invested less after a previous win\nafter exposure to the group prime and more after a previous win without the group prime.\nResults were not influenced by group size or its interaction with sex1.\nFigure 3. Three way sex by group prime by previous win interaction for continuous\nspending\nPotential Mediators\nTo search for potential mediators of the sex by group prime by previous win\ninteraction, each sociocognitive variable was entered into a separate model identical to the\nmodel in Table 2, except with the sociocognitive variable, group prime, previous win, and\nprevious loss and interactions between them as additional predictors. The three way\ninteraction between the sociocognitive variable, group prime, and previous win was\nevaluated. In none of these 12 models did this interaction reach statistical significance (ps >\n0.10). Therefore, further analyses for mediation were not performed, as the first condition\nfor such analyses was not met.\nNotably, the model that came closest to yielding a significant result was a main\neffect for the fairness dimension of Graham et al.'s (2009) moral foundations measure.\nIndividuals who endorsed this item, that resources should be equally distributed among\n1 To test whether group size influenced variables of interest, we ran 15 regression models with sex, group\ncondition, and group size predicting each of the 12 sociocognitive variables and spending at each of the 3\ntimepoints. None of these models yielded a significant effect of group size. Therefore, we found no evidence\nthat group size affected participants' behavior or social cognition in this study.\nSex differences in in-group cooperation\nDiscussion\nOur research investigated sex differences in cooperation under group or individually\ncompetitive conditions using a multi-trial public goods game. Results from the first trial\nwere consistent with Van Vugt et al.'s (2007) finding that men's public investment was\nhigher when competing against an out-group than when there was no such competition,\nwhereas women's investment was not influenced by the presence or absence of an out-\ngroup. Our findings also revealed that both men and women adjusted their public\ninvestment in response to outcomes from previous trials, indicating that the level of\ncooperation for both sexes changed dynamically. Generally, there was an increase in public\nspending after a previous loss\u00adwhen the total contributions of the group were not sufficient\nto earn the bonus\u00adand a decrease in such spending after a previous win\u00adafter a bonus was\nearned. However, the pattern was more nuanced for men. This is because men made a\nsmaller public contribution in the group condition following a win, and made a larger\ncontribution in the individual condition following a win. In short, men were more sensitive\nto perceived between group competition than were women, and to the perceived level of\ncooperation among other group members. These results are consistent with the hypothesis\nthat men have an evolved sensitivity to competitive situations and outcomes, especially\nwhen these involve between-group competition (Bugental and Beaulieu, 2009; Yuki and\nThe finding that men contributed more to the group than women for the initial\ninvestment, when competing against out-groups, but then decreased public spending after\ntheir group had received the bonus suggests they may more finely calibrate their investment\nin the group than women. This investment is contingent on the investments of others and in\ntheory according to the perceived strength of the out-group. When a male coalition faces a\nrelatively strong out-group, in-group cohesion becomes particularly important, that is, men\nmust contribute more to the group for the group to stay competitive (Benensen, Markovits,\nThompson, and Wrangham, 2009). However, when men perceive a rival group as relatively\nweak, or that their marginal contributions (contributions above and beyond those of other\nin-group men) will not affect the outcome, they may act in a more individualistic and\nselfish manner. Studies of suicide terrorism, perhaps the ultimate form of group sacrifice,\nconsistently demonstrate that they are perpetrated by relatively weak groups (Atran, 2003,\n2006; Pape, 2003). In a similar vein, historians and moralists have long lamented that\nopulence increases hedonism and unwillingness to make extreme sacrifices for the larger\ngroup (Gibbon, 2001; Plutarch, 2001). When professional basketball teams play back-to-\nback games at the same site, after controlling for relative team strength and home court\nadvantage, it is the team that lost the first game that is more likely to win the second, that\nis, it appears that individuals of the losing team may increase their efforts following a loss\nIn light of this, it is somewhat counterintuitive that men in the individual condition\ninvested more publicly following a previous win. It appears to be the case that different\npsychological mechanisms are activated in men depending on whether they are in the group\nor individual condition. We speculate that men in the individual condition engage in a form\nof competitive altruism to facilitate the likelihood that they will be considered desirable\ncoalitional partners and/or mates (Barclay, 2004; Hardy and Van Vugt, 2006), but this\nremains to be tested. Given the importance to men of being part of a successful group, such\nSex differences in in-group cooperation\na strategy may be rational. It must be noted, however, that none of the group members were\naware of each other's previous investments, making this explanation open to doubt.\nWe were surprised that not one of the sociocognitive variables we measured\nmediated or moderated the spending differences between the sexes, given Van Vugt and\ncolleagues' (2007) finding that heightened identification with the in-group mediated men's\nincreased investment in the public group during a between-group competition. Further,\nnone of the variables we measured accounted for individual differences in investment, with\nthe possible exception of the fairness dimension, Graham et al.'s (2009) moral foundations,\nwhich was, somewhat paradoxically, negatively related to public investment. One potential\nexplanation is that participants represent themselves on the moral foundations items as they\nhope to be perceived and not as they are. Alternatively, participants may hold themselves to\na different moral standard than they hold others, with the most moralistic individuals being\nthe most hypocritical. However, the gist is that the mechanisms that mediate men's\ndynamic investment in their group during intergroup competition were not captured by the\nsocial dominance, religiosity, or morality measures used in this study.\nMen's in-group psychology likely affects real world behavior. Our results could\nmanifest in conditions that involved some type of investment by men during any between-\ngroup competition, but the specifics of the investment will depend on the context of the\ncompetition. In the current study, it involved money but in contexts involving physical,\ncoalitional competition, for example, it could manifest as higher or lower levels of\nbehavioral risk taking, that is, risking actual injury to facilitate their group's\ncompetitiveness.\nLimitations of our study should be noted. First, the amount of money offered to\nwinners was not large, making it difficult to extend these results to conditions where the\ncosts and benefits of cooperation could be substantial. Second, the group condition featured\na relatively male-biased prime (rival athletic Universities) which leaves open the possibility\nthat women may be more responsive to intergroup competition when presented with an out-\ngroup prime that might be similarly salient to men and women (e.g., nationality, religion).\nHowever, a basic corollary of men being more sensitive to group competition is that most\nprimes should be male biased (Geary, 2010). Also, we did not assess every construct that\ncould possibly affect investment in the in-group. Future studies of mediators of sex\ndifferences in cooperation might include constructs such as empathy.\nReferences\nAltemeyer, B., and Hunsberger, B. (2004).

You are going to play a public goods game and fill out\nsome questionnaires.\nThe Oxford Experiment is part of a larger experiment that is taking place at all of the\nUniversities in the Big 12 conference. We are interested in investigating how well you\nperform AS A GROUP compared to OPPOSING BIG 12 UNIVERSITIES. Before we\nbegin the experiment, I will walk you through the instructions of the public goods game\nand make sure that you understand how the game works. If you have any questions please\nask.\nIn this game each of you will receive three dollars which you may choose to keep or invest\nin the group. To do this, simply look at your computer screen and press the number key\ncorresponding to the amount you wish TO INVEST IN THE GROUP.\n(If there are not six people read this: Since there are not six people, the empty computer(s)\nwill invest an amount in the group which is equal to the average investment of (males or\nfemales) who have participated)\nIf the group invests a total of 12 or more dollars each individual will receive a five dollar\nbonus on top of the money that you chose to keep for yourself.\nSo, for example, if you chose to invest two dollars into the group and the group as a whole\nhit the target of 12 or more dollars, you would receive the five dollar bonus plus the dollar\nyou decided to keep. However, if you invested the two dollars and the group did not make\nthe target, you would only keep your dollar and would not receive a bonus.\nAny questions?\n(Answer any questions at this time and give participants a short verbal quiz to make sure\nthey understand the rules fully).\nYou will play a total of three rounds. You will actually get paid based on your responses\nfrom the last round of play. Remember, we are comparing your performance AS A\nGROUP to other Big 12 Universities.\nAfter you are done with the public goods game you will be asked to fill out a few\nquestionnaires. When you have completed the questionnaires, please see me. I will debrief\nyou at that time and you will be free to go. Are there any questions?\nIndividual Condition\nWelcome to the Oxford Experiment.

A mixed model confirmed that the sex*previous win*group\nprime interaction remained significant for participants in these trials alone (F[1,339] =\n7.40, p = 0.007) even without controlling simultaneously for previous loss effects\nFigure 5 shows the separate contributions on the second and third trails for men (upper left\npanel) and women (upper right panel) who won on the second trial and those who lost on\nthe second trial (lower panels). The mixed model for only these conditions did not include\nprevious loss, as in the second and third trials previous loss is perfectly negatively\ncorrelated with previous win. In this model, sex*previous win*group prime is marginally\nSex differences in in-group cooperation"
