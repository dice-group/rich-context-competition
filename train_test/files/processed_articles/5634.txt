The womenfolk being mostly illiterate or with low\nlevels of education face shortage of work in the home turf and have inhibitions\nin working as manual labour in the non-agricultural sector. But with an increase\nin family income and improvement in the education level of females, more and\nmore females start entering the labour force, especially into non-manual or service-\noriented jobs. That is why the participation of females in the labour force in\ncomparison with the economic growth is supposed to be U-shaped (Goldin, 1994).\nThis article examines how the experience has been in India especially among rural\nfemales who account for the major share of the rural population.\nFor developing countries, average patterns of women's labour force participation\nare more mixed, ranging from as low as 21 per cent in the Middle East and North\nAfrican region to as high as 71 per cent in the East Asian and Pacific region in 2010.\nThe gender gaps in labour force participation are also highest in the Middle East\nand North African and South Asian regions, where men's participation rates exceed\nwomen's rates by over 50 percentage points.1 The labour force participation rate\n(LFPR) in India is around 40 per cent, but gender-wise, for females it is only 22.5\nper cent.2 The gap in male\u00adfemale labour force participation is such that the LFPR\nfor rural females of the age group over 15 years is only 35.8 per cent, while for rural\nmales it is more than double at 81.3 per cent.3 This is quite baffling in a country with\na huge demographic dividend of the working population. Studies undertaken to\nanalyse this trend of low and declining female LFPR (FLFPR) has attributed it to\neducation and income effect (Rangarajan, Kaul, & Seema, 2011; Vinoj, 2013). In a\nculturally diverse country like India, socio-cultural aspects also have a say in the\neconomic participation of the women. India's policies on liberalization, privatiza-\ntion and globalization initiated in the early nineties and more than two decades\nof reform-induced economic growth have driven the economy to a double-digit\ngrowth. This article examines how the participation of the female labour force has\nVIKALPA\nThe Journal for Decision Makers\nManagement, Ahmedabad\nSAGE Publications\nsagepub.in/home.nav\nhttp://vik.sagepub.com\nfared, during this period of positive growth, espe-\ncially in rural areas, wherein almost 70 per cent of the\nfemale population lives (Census 2011).4 The trend anal-\nysis in the paper covers five quinquennial National\nSample Survey (NSS) Rounds on the Employment and\nThe pursuit of neoliberal economic policies5 has led to a\ndiscussion of both defeminization and feminization of\nlabour force in the economic literature. But, according\nto the National Sample Survey Organization (NSSO)\nEUS, the rural female LFPR (RFLFPR) has been almost\nhalf of the rural male LFPR, while in the urban areas, the\nFLFPR is even less than half of the male LFPR (Table 1).\nWhile the FLFPR marginally revived in urban areas\nTable 1: Labour   Rate per 1000 of Age\n15-plus Years as per Usual Status\nRural Urban\nNSSO Rounds Male Female Male Female\nof the female labour force being concentrated in rural\nareas, the focus of this paper is on addressing the\nissue from the rural angle. Table 2 captures the age\ncohort-wise distribution of rural female labour force\nacross the Rounds. It emerges that there has been a\nindicating that the rural females of this age group are\nin the education space. Similarly, in the 15\u00ad19 and\n20\u00ad24 age-cohort, a decline in the LFPR is seen in\nTable 2: Age-wise Distribution of Rural  \nParticipation Rate per 1000 as per Usual Status\nAge Group\nThe LFPR reaches its prime in the age group of 30\u00ad49\nwhen there was a rise in labour force participation, the\nFLFPR is seen declining. To understand why women\nwho were earlier in the labour force were leaving, the\nactivity status of rural females outside the labour force\nwas looked into (Table 3).\nTable 3: Females Engaged in NSSO Activity Codes 92 and 93\nNSSO\nRounds\nSource: Authors' calculations using NSSO unit level data:\nNote. Code 92--attended to domestic duties only; Code 93--\nattended to domestic duties and also engaged in the free\ncollection of goods (vegetables, roots, firewood, cattle feed,\netc.), sewing, tailoring, weaving, etc. for household use.\nAs may be seen from Table 3, the proportion of rural\nfemales who reported themselves as engaged primarily\nin domestic duties and activities for household\nbeen around 64 per cent during this period. The women\nwho spent their time in domestic duties belonged to all\nage groups. The proportion of rural females aged 15\u00ad29\nyears who spent their time in domestic duties increased\nIn other words, in the economically active age group\nwere outside the labour force in the rural and urban\nwomen who move out of the labour force get into full-\ntime domestic duties and/or do activities for their own\nconsumption. Table 4 highlights the probable reasons\nfor moving out of the labour force. It is evident that\nmost of the women spend more than 80 per cent of\ntheir time in domestic duties as purportedly there is no\nother person to carry out these duties. The proportion\nof rural women engaged in domestic duties and prefer-\nring to stay in the household has declined from 70 per\nterms, the proportion of females who expressed their\nwillingness to work has increased from 30 per cent to 34\nper cent, and the majority of them wanted to work on a\nregular part-time basis so as to attend to their domestic\nduties also. This implies that there has been a change\nin the sentiment among rural women to be engaged in\neconomically productive activities.\nAs may be seen from Table 5, the rural females have\ngiven preference for women-centric work which\ncan be discharged from the household or within\nthe periphery of the household in the nature of self-\nemployed. Although a majority of rural females have\nasked for venture capital, a decline in trend for this\nassistance and an increase in demand for training\nmay be noticed across the rounds. The preference for\nwomen-centric jobs also implies that rural females\nprefer activities which can easily blend with their\ndomestic duties. To further understand the work\npreferences, the workforce distribution of rural\nfemales was looked into.\nTable 4: Responses of Rural Women in the NSSO EUS Reporting Activity Status as Domestic Duties under Codes 92 and 93\n1 Required to spend most of the time in\ndomestic duties (%)\n2 Out of the females in (1), the percentage\nof females reporting `no other person to\ndo domestic duty' as the reason for being\nengaged in domestic duties\n3 Out of the females in (1), the percentage of\nfemales not willing to work\nTable 5: Responses of Rural Women Reporting Activity Status as Domestic Duties under Codes 92 and 93 and are Willing to Work\n(v) Preferred economic activity--animal husbandry, tailoring,\nspinning and weaving, manufacture of wood products, leather\ngoods, food processing, etc. (in decreasing order of preference)\nRural Female Workforce Distribution\nMore than 70 per cent of the rural female workforce\n(Table 6) is engaged in agriculture, and the proportion\nof workforce engaged in agriculture in principal\nand subsidiary capacity is around 75 per cent across\na spurt in RFLFPR, the proportion of rural females\nengaged in agriculture in principal or subsidiary\ncapacity was found to be lower than that in 1999\u00ad\n2000. But the proportion of females engaged in the\ntrend in the share of employment in agriculture both\nin principal and subsidiary capacity is evident from\nRural females engaged in manufacturing as a prin-\nrural females engaged in manufacturing as a subsid-\nwas the loss of jobs for women who were engaged\nin manufacturing. This may be due to the decrease\nin demand for the products from traditional indus-\ntries which led to the loss of jobs for women. In the\nnon-manufacturing sector that consists of the construc-\ntion sector apart from public utilities, there has been a\nservices sector, the share of rural females in the prin-\nbeen a fluctuation in their participation. Thus, in the\npast two decades, while the services sector has shown\na rise in jobs for the rural females, agriculture shows\na declining trend and in the industry sector a reversal\nis noticed only in the last two rounds. But only if the\ndecline in agriculture jobs is commensurate with the\nincrease in jobs in the non-farm sector, can the situa-\ntion of loss of jobs be arrested.\nDistribution of Rural Female Workforce by\nEmployment Status\nAgriculture is the main sector that employs the rural\nfemale workforce. The employment status of the work-\nforce engaged in agriculture over the rounds may be\nseen in Table 7.\nIn the agriculture sector, among rural females who\nreported themselves as self-employed, there was an\nincrease in the proportion of the own account worker\ncategory both in the principal status and subsidiary\nstatus. But what is disturbing is that a large proportion\nof rural females in agriculture are working as unpaid\nhelpers both in principal and subsidiary capacity. The\nsudden spurt in the labour force and workforce in\ntion of rural females engaged in agriculture working\nas helpers and a decline in those working as casual\nlabour. This may be attributed to distress employ-\nment as agriculture and allied activities grew at a rate\nVol. III).\nTable 6: Share of Rural Female Workforce by Sector and Activity Status (age group 15-plus)\nAgriculture Manufacturing Non-manufacturing Services\nNSSO\nRounds\nPrincipal Subsidiary Principal Subsidiary Principal Subsidiary Principal Subsidiary\nTable 7: Proportional Distribution of Workforce by Employment Status\nAgriculture\nOwn Account Worker Employer Helper Unpaid Regular wage/\nSalaried\nCasual Labour in\nOther Types of Work\nNSSO Rounds Principal Subsidiary Principal Subsidiary Principal Subsidiary Principal Principal Subsidiary\nNote. Self-employed has been split into three sub-categories, namely own account worker, employer and helper who are\nmainly family members and unpaid. The category, casual labour in public works, was removed as it was insignificant.\nThe distribution of the workforce by employment\nand activity status in the manufacturing sector may\nbe seen in Table 8. The rural female working as an\nemployer under the self-employed category was\nalmost non-existent in all the rounds. However, those\nworking as the own account worker in the principal and\nsubsidiary capacity saw an increase. Those reported\nworking as unpaid, though considerable, shows a\ndeclining trend. This raises the doubt as to whether\nfamily members who were earlier working as helpers\nstarted reporting as own account workers. While rural\nfemales working in the regular wage/salaried category\nin principal capacity saw an increase, those working in\nsubsidiary capacity were almost insignificant.\nRural females working as casual labour in principal\ncapacity show a decline, while in the subsidiary\ncapacity there are wide fluctuations. Thus, out\nof the small proportion of workforce engaged in\nmanufacturing, the increase in the share of the\nregular employed is a positive sign of decent jobs\nbeing created.\nIn the non-manufacturing sector, a majority of the rural\nfemales are found working as casual labour in other\ntypes of work (Table 9).\nBut in the last two rounds, there is a decline in rural\nfemales working in principal capacity as casual labour\nin other types of work and an increase in the proportion\nof females working in subsidiary capacity as a casual\nworker in public works. Can this be interpreted as a\nshift by the rural females with the loss of jobs in manu-\nfacturing and agriculture to the non-manufacturing\nsector especially construction and working in subsid-\niary capacity?\nTable 8: Proportional Distribution of Workforce by Employment Status\nManufacturing\nOwn Account Worker Helper Unpaid Regular Wage/Salaried Casual Labour in Other Types of Work\nNSSO Rounds Principal Subsidiary Principal Subsidiary Principal Principal Subsidiary\nTable 9: Proportional Distribution of Workforce by Employment Status\nNon-manufacturing Sector*\nOwn Account\nWorker\nHelper\nUnpaid\nRegular Wage/\nSalaried\nCasual Labour in\nPublic Works\nCasual Labour in\nOther Types of Work\nNSSO Rounds Principal Subsidiary Principal Subsidiary Principal Principal Subsidiary Principal Subsidiary\nNotes. *Includes public utilities and construction sector.\nTable 10: Proportional Distribution of Workforce by Employment Status\nServices\nOwn Account\nWorker\nHelper\nUnpaid\nRegular Wage/\nSalaried\nCasual Labour in other Types\nof Work\nNSSO Rounds Principal Subsidiary Principal Subsidiary Principal Subsidiary Principal Subsidiary\nIn the services sector, a good trend of rural females\nengaged as regular wage/salaried class in principal\ncapacity is seen steadily increasing (Table 10).At the same\ntime a decline in rural females engaged as own account\nworkers, helpers and casual labour can also be observed.\nThe ILO Research Paper No. 10 (Kapsos, Silberman,\n& Bourmpoula, 2014) attributes the decline in female\nlabour force participation to the rising number of\nfemales in the age group of 15\u00ad24 attending educational\ninstitutions, an increase in household income levels,\nand the measurement issue in capturing female work\nin NSSO surveys. The next section explores the effect of\nthese factors on female labour force participation.\n \nWith the introduction of the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan8\nand the Right to Education Act, 2009, there has been an\nimprovement in the basic education level up to 14 years\nof age. But for better employability, the enhancement of\nskills after 14 years is a prerequisite. A look at the mean\nyears of education after 14 years shows an increasing\nyears for rural females and three-plus years for urban\nfemales in the last two NSSO rounds (Table 11).\nTable 11: Enrolment Ratio and Mean Years of Education of\nEnrolment\nRatio\nMean Years of Education\nNSSO\nRounds\nRural\nFemale\nUrban\nFemale\nRural\nFemale\nUrban\nFemale\nSource: Authors' calculations from NSSO unit level data: 1993\u00ad\nAmong the rural females in the 15\u00ad24 age group, who\nreported their current status under Code 91,9 that is,\nattending educational institutions, reveal that only 8 per\ncent of the females in this age-cohort were in Code 91 in\nper cent of the women in the 15\u00ad24 age bracket were not\nattending educational institutions and their LFPR was\n23 per cent implying that 57 per cent of the women were\nengaged in domestic duties. Furthermore, the mean age\nof marriage in rural India being 20.8 years (Statistical\nReport, 2012), for the majority of rural females in the\nprime age, entry into the labour force may perhaps be\nhindered by social factors such as marriage and domestic\nduties. Hence, the argument that fall in the rural LFPR of\nthe females in the 15\u00ad24 bracket is due to an increase in\ntheir attending education institutions (education effect)\nis not fully substantiated by available data. However,\nwith schemes like the Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha\nAbhiyan (RMSA) focusing on improving accessibility,\nquality and outreach of secondary education with special\nfocus on more female teachers in schools, separate toilet\nblocks for girls, incentives to girls students, and hostel\nfacilities, etc., an increase in the mean years of education\nof rural females would be evident in the years to come.\nAnother factor that can facilitate entry of female youth\nis the declining fertility rate. The total fertility rate (TFR)\nthe rural females are seen withdrawing from the labour\nforce and engaging in domestic duties. Therefore, the\nnatural question that arises is: Could the withdrawal\nfrom labour force be due to the absence of distress\nemployment (income effect)? (Rangarajan et al., 2011).\n \nTo assess the impact of income effect on withdrawal\nof females from the labour force, the household\nMPCE (monthly per capita employment) data from\nwas examined. The household level MPCE data\nwas used to form decile classes. These decile classes\ndivided the households into 10 classes such that the\nlowest class represented the lowest 10 per cent in the\nspectrum of income distribution and the top or the\nhighest decile class represented the top 10 per cent of\nthe households in terms of their expenditure. Using\nMPCE for the study of the income distribution may\nnot be a good proxy for income in higher classes as\nthen the savings and expenditure on certain other\nluxurious activities/items like tourism and jewellery,\nto name a few, are not accounted for. However, in the\nlower classes of income where the expenditure on\nfood, housing, clothing, education and medicine form\na high percentage of the total MPCE, the approxima-\ntion works quite well.\nFigure 1: Rural FLFPR vs MPCE Decile Classes\nLFPR (in percentage)\nDecile Class\nSource: Authors' calculations from NSSO unit level data.\nIt is observed from Figure 1 that there has been a decline\nin the rural FLFPR among all the MPCE decile classes11\nFLFPR is 9.2 per cent on average in the first three decile\nclasses, 8.8 per cent in the middle three decile classes\nand 6.6 per cent in the upper four decile classes.\nThe magnitude of improvement in the average per\ncapita consumption expenditure in rural areas varies\nbetween 9 per cent and 15 per cent up to the 6th decile\nclass, whereas for the rest 4 deciles, it varies between\nfemale labour force participation in the lower decile\nclasses may be attributed to income effect because the\nfemales might have withdrawn from distress employ-\nment, but the same argument does not support the\nwithdrawal of females belonging to the middle and\nhigher decile classes (Figure 1).\nThe decile class-wise distribution of workforce into\ndifferent employment status reveals that as compared\nwomenworkingasaself-employedownaccountworker\nin the lower and middle decile classes, while a decline\nis observed especially in the higher decile class women\nworking as an unpaid helper. The data also suggests an\nincrease in regular salaried/wage employed across all\ndecile classes and a significant increase in casual workers\nin public works. The proportion of females in casual\nworks other than public works declined significantly,\nespecially in lower decile classes, whereas it increased\nin higher decile classes (Table 13).\nTable 12: Decile Class-wise Average MPCE of Rural Households\nin India\nSource: Authors' calculations from NSSO EUS rounds: 2004\u00ad\nThis clearly indicates a shift to casual work in the\npublic works category which can be attributed to\nthe Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment\nGuarantee Act (MGNREGA). But the average person-\ndays generated per household under MGNREGA has\nbeen hovering between 45 and 50, which suggests that,\nalthough preferred, the work opportunity generated by\nMGNREGA is not sufficient. Also, another key impor-\ntant implication is the fall in the unpaid helper cate-\ngory. The movement or shift in the employment status\nacross decile classes clearly indicates that women have\npreference for a decent kind of work. Also, as alter-\nnatives to remunerative employment are provided\nby programmes like MGNREGA, they do not prefer\nworking as unpaid workers. This motivation towards\nremunerative employment is well supported if we take\na look at trends in wage rates.\nAlthough MPCE is a proxy for per household income,\nwage data as available in NSSO covers only two sets of\nemployment, namely, casual and regular job, leaving\nout the self-employed where nearly 50 per cent of the\nfemale workforce is engaged. However, an attempt\nto analyse the wage data of workers in regular and\ncasual employment (Table 14) shows that in terms of\nwitnessed more increase in their wages/salaries. In\nrural areas, the female wages/salaries for regular\nfor males.\nTable 13: Proportionate Percentage Change in the Distribution of Female Workforce in Different MPCE Decile Classes (2004\u00ad2005\nSelf-employed Casual Worker\nDecile Classes Own Account Worker Employer Unpaid Worker Regular Wage/Salaried In Public Works Other\nTable 14: Percentage Change in Wages/Salaries of Workers in Rural India\nRegular/Salaried\nWorkers\nCasual Workers in Work Other\nthan Public Works\nCasual Workers in Public Works\n(other than MNREGA)\nYear Male Female Male Female Male Female\nIn the case of casual workers involved in works other\nthan public works, the wages for female workers\nappreciated by 63 per cent as against 50 per cent\ninvolved in public works other than MNREGA,\nwomen workers experienced better hike in their\ncompensation/wages.\nThese results are in contradiction with the argument\nthat it was the increase in income of the head of the\nhousehold which caused women especially in rural\nareas to withdraw from labour force. The labour\nmarket outcomes in monetary terms were much better\nfor females than for males. Drawing from the labour\nsupply theory in economics, since the wage outcomes\nare higher for females, this must increase the opportu-\nnity cost of the leisure or the tendency to stay out of\nlabour force by the choice per se. This should, in turn,\nbe a motivating factor for them to come out and work.\nBut it is also important to take cognizance of the sectoral\nwage changes.\nIt can be observed from Table 15 that rural females\nexperienced a rise in wages in mining, manufacturing,\nconstruction, trade, hotels and restaurant, and\ntransport. The services sector experienced a less\nproportionate increase in wages of females as\ncompared to that of males. The manufacturing sector\nwhich employed 10 per cent of the female workforce\nsaw a sharp increase in wages of female workers as\ncompared to their male counterparts. Construction is\nanother sector where there is a significant rise in wages\nfor women with a 5.14 per cent increase in jobs created\nfor females. There is a steep fall in the proportion of jobs\nin agriculture and allied activities for females between\nthese two NSSO rounds. Although manufacturing,\nMale Workers Female Workers\nSector\n% Change in\nWages/Salary\n% Change in Share in Employment\n% Change in\nWages/Salary\n% Change in Share in Employment\nTransport, storage and\ncommunications\nconstruction, trade, hotels and restaurants can be\neconomically fruitful sectors for female workforce, the\nshare of female workforce in regular employment in\nthese sectors was only 5.6 per cent as compared to 10\nlost jobs in agriculture did not find place in other sectors\nof the economy. Looking at the educational profile of\nthe rural female labour force (Figure 2), clearly, it is\nthe low educational attainment of rural females that\nacts as a barrier to their smooth inter-sectoral labour\nmobility. Nearly 69 per cent of the rural females are\neither illiterate or have educational attainment only up\nto the primary level.\nIlliterate\nUp to\nPrimary\nSecondary\nHigher\nSecondary\nGraduation\nand above\nSource: Authors' calculations from NSSO unit level data.\nThus, more than the income effect, it is the lack of\nsufficient opportunities commensurate with the skill\nlevels of the women in rural areas that has caused the\nwithdrawal of females from the labour market.\nGender Gap\nTable 16 shows the male\u00adfemale gap in the LFPR across\nmedian rates.\nCategory Minimum Median Maximum\nSource: Authors' calculations from NSSO rounds: 1993\u00ad\nIt is evident that the gender gap between male and\nfemale labour force participation is 25 percentage\npoints in rural India (median value of 55\u00ad30). Across\nrural India, it can be seen that during the period from\nother major states experienced an increase in the gender\ngap between male and female labour force participa-\ntion (Table 17). It ranges from 2 percentage points in\nHimachal Pradesh to 43 percentage points in Bihar.\nThe maximum increase in the gender gap between\nKarnataka, Gujarat, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab,\nJharkhand and Odisha.

To\nanswer this, Table 18 analyses the state-wise change in\nsectoral workforce composition in rural India between\nIt is observed that agriculture, which was the primary\nwork area of women, has seen a decline across these\nstates. However, the women workers who have been\ndisplaced from agriculture did not find place in\nnon-farm sectors. The jobs created were mostly in the\nconstruction and utilities sector where women have a\nvery small share in employment. Even in the service\nsector, jobs created were in transportation, storage,\ncommunications, trade, hotels and restaurants which\nalso did not benefit those who had to leave agricul-\nture. With rural females mostly employed as the own\naccount worker, unpaid helper or casual worker, the\nswitch over to unskilled work in other sectors was\nlimited considering their educational profile. Hence,\nthe women in rural areas can be said to have experi-\nenced more of a discouraged worker effect that further\npushed them out of the labour market.\nMeasuring the   Participation\nIt has been pointed out that there are measurement\nissues with the NSSO surveys which have been the\nreason for a significant underestimation of the female\nwork (Kapsos et al., 2014).Alarge number of literature is\navailable on data underestimation. Women are involved\nin subsistence and extended SNA activities12 which are\noften uncounted or undercounted. The flexible time\narrangements and indulgence in unpaid family work\nmay result in reporting or probing errors. The NSSO\nschedule does capture subsidiary activities and also tries\nto collect details on extended SNA activities. The use of\ntime use surveys (TUS) has been advocated in various\nstudies, but carrying it out is difficult and cumbersome\ntaking into consideration the sample size of regular\nemployment\u00adunemployment survey (Hirway, 2000).\nAlso, getting the responses from the people of the\nactivities with small time slots is difficult.\nAmong all the arguments, income effect, education effect\nand the problem of underestimation, what is left unno-\nticed is the structural transformation of the economy and\nits resultant impact on the female labour market in the\nwhole process. With an increase in income levels of the\nhouseholds, a woman no longer prefers working as an\nunpaid worker or a helper or as a casual worker unless\nthe work is remunerative (as in MGNREGA). However,\nsuch opportunities are limited in rural India and as a\nresult women are not finding jobs matching their pref-\nerence (regular part-time jobs close to their households).\nFurthermore, with low skill levels, jobs in the non-farm\nsector are also limited. These factors perhaps have led to\nthe withdrawal of women from the labour force.\nThe decline observed in rural female labour force\nparticipation is due to a complex mix of several forces\nworking simultaneously. While the focus is on educa-\ntion and income effect, our findings reveal that the lack\nof sufficient non-farm jobs in rural areas has forced\nwomen to stay out of the labour market. The wage\nconditions prevalent in the rural labour market show\nState Agriculture Manufacturing Non-manufacturing Services Total Change Total Change as % of Workforce\nthat female workers have experienced a better hike in\nwages/salaries; it implies that the gender gap in terms\nof wages/salaries has started declining. But the oppor-\ntunities available in rural India which are compatible\nwith their education levels are dying out. Dedicated\nefforts in skilling, re-skilling and improving their\neducational outcomes through infrastructure develop-\nment, female teacher availability, incentives along with\ncreating an adequate number of favourable job oppor-\ntunities are necessary to harness their potential.\nConsidering the constraints experienced by the rural\nfemales to enter the labour force (Tables 4 and 5),\npolicy initiatives are required to make them econom-\nically active. The initiatives should focus on microfi-\nnance-supported self-help group-centred activities,\nwhich will make them economically active along\nwith handling domestic duties. Also, this will help\nto address the need for working finance assistance as\nexpressed by the females willing to accept work. If\nsuch policy initiatives materialize and the 34 per cent\nwomen in activity codes 92 and 93, who are willing to\nwork, enter the labour force, the rural female participa-\ntion rate would increase from the current 25.3 per cent\nFurthermore, rural manufacturing should create jobs\nthat can be undertaken by women in their household\nor as a community. Such focused steps can increase the\nparticipation of rural females back into the labour force.\nFor females in the 15\u00ad24 age group who are about\nto enter the labour force, vocational and basic skills\ntraining need to be provided so that they can enter\nthe labour market overcoming social inhibitions and\nrestrictions. Lack of adequate infrastructure in terms\nof roads and connectivity can also be deterring women\nfrom undertaking work in the nearby areas. Thus,\nimproving connectivity between the villages and the\nsatellite towns and small cities will also enhance female\nlabour force participation.\nIndia has already started realizing its demographic divi-\ndend and female population which account for nearly\n50 per cent of the population is an asset to be utilized\ncarefully if we have to reap this window of opportu-\nnity. Declining fertility rate and child dependency ratio\nare factors which can facilitate female workers to come\nout. In short, a bubbling rural economy is the need of\nthe hour to create jobs and absorb the bulging econom-\nically active female population.\nNOTES\n*\nThe views expressed are personal and do not represent the\norganization the authors represent.\nWomen are less likely than men to participate in the\nlabour market in most countries.
