Ratliff1, Jessica A. Barber1, Laura B. Palmese1, Erin L. Reutenauer1 and Cenk Tek1\nThe incidence of obesity in the United States has reached epidemic proportions. Previous research has shown several\nmedications exert noticeable effects on body-weight regulation. Histamine-1 (H1) receptor blockers commonly used\nto alleviate allergy symptoms are known to report weight gain as a possible side effect. Therefore, we investigated the\nassociation between prescription H1 antihistamine use and obesity in adults using data from the 2005\u00ad2006 National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Adults taking prescription H1 antihistamines were matched by age\nand gender with controls and compared on the basis of body measurements, plasma glucose, insulin concentrations,\nand lipid levels. Prescription H1 antihistamine users had a significantly higher weight, waist circumference, and insulin\nconcentration than matched controls. The odds ratio (OR) for being overweight was increased in prescription H1\nantihistamine users. H1 antihistamine use may contribute to the increased prevalence of obesity and the metabolic\nsyndrome in adults given these medications are also commonly used as over-the-counter remedies.\nshort communications\n \nB levels accounted for lipid measurements. A detailed description of the\nStatistical analysis\nThe association between prescription H1 antihistamine use with BMI,\nglucose concentration, insulin concentration, and lipid levels was deter-\nmined using linear regression. Samples were weighted according to\nNHANES guidelines (7). Logistic regression was used to determine the\nodds ratio (OR) for prescription H1 antihistamine users in relation to\noverweight status (BMI >25), as well as insulin and glucose concentra-\ntion, and lipid levels. All analyses were performed using SPSS, version\n17.0 for Windows (SPSS, Chicago, IL).\nResults\nTable 1 shows the comparison of means between prescription\ncontrols (n = 599; mean age 45.6) on outcome measures associ-\nated with weight. The racial composition of the prescription H1\nantihistamine users was as follows: 80% non-Hispanic white,\n8% non-Hispanic black, 8% Hispanic, and 4% others. The racial\ncomposition of the control group was as follows: 72% non-\nHispanic white, 10% non-Hispanic black, 13% Hispanic, and\n5% others. The most prevalent H1 antihistamines used were\ncetirizine (50%) and fexofenadine (37%). After adjusting for\ngender, prescription H1 antihistamine users had \nsignificantly\nhealthy controls. There were no differences in fasting glucose\nlevels, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein- or high-\n\ndensity lipoprotein-cholesterol, triglycerides, and apolipopro-\ntein B levels between groups (data not shown). There were no\nsignificant differences based on gender or ethnicity for any of\nthe outcome variables.\nFor both males and females using prescription H1 anti-\nhistamines, the odds of being overweight were significantly\nder, odds of being overweight were significantly increased\nence was not significantly increased (OR, 0.98; 95% CI,\nsignificantly increase the OR for elevated glucose, insulin,\nor lipid levels, and there were no \ndifferent effects among the\nantihistamines.\nDiscussion\nWe found a relationship between prescription H1 antihista-\nmine use and an increased risk of obesity in US adults over\nthe age of 18. Compared to age- and gender-matched controls,\nprescription H1 antihistamine users had significantly greater\nweight, BMI, waist circumference, and insulin levels.\nAtypical antipsychotics with potent H1 antagonistic prop-\nerties are strongly correlated with weight gain. New genera-\ntion antipsychotics with high antihistaminic properties such\nas olanzapine induce weight gain (8). However, the current\nanalysis excluded atypical antipsychotics and focused on\nantihistamines prescribed for allergy relief. A previous\nstudy (9) found an association between obesity and allergy\nand adolescents, but did not explore this relationship in adults\nor the impact of prescription H1 antihistamine use. One pos-\nsible reason for the increased weight observed with prescrip-\ntion H1 antihistamines may be due to an increased sedation\naccompanied by their use. Although the second-generation\nhistamines prescribed in this analysis are considered\nnonsedating, this may be mitigated by other factors. Cetirizine,\nthe most commonly prescribed H1 antihistamine in the sam-\nple, is an active metabolite of hydroxyzine, an older sedating\nantihistamine, so it still possesses minor sedative qualities (10).\nSecond, these medications are deemed nonsedating at their\nprescribed dosage; however, the dosage and usage for these H1\ndata set. It is possible that prescription H1 antihistamine use\nprovided some sedation that resulted in decreased energy\nexpenditure and weight gain.\nPrescription H1 antihistamine use was also associated with\na higher waist circumference and insulin concentration com-\npared to age- and gender-matched controls. Central obesity\nis highly associated with increased insulin levels and insulin\nresistance (11). Additionally, elevated waist circumference is\none of the criteria for metabolic syndrome, a cluster of dis-\norders that increase the risk for diabetes and cardiovascular\ndisease. The mechanism through which histamine modu-\nlates insulin function and energy expenditure has not been\nfully elucidated (12). Histamine promoted glucose uptake in\nrat, but not human adipocytes (13). In humans, insulin has\nbeen shown to upregulate H1 receptor expression (14). H1\nreceptor expression is also modulated by leptin levels (15),\nwhich become elevated when insulin levels are increased. The\nTable 1Distribution of weight, BMI, waist circumference, and\ninsulin concentration in H1 antihistamine users and matched\nMeasure H1 antagonist Control Significance\nWeight (kg)\nBMI (kg)\nWaist circumference (cm)\nInsulin (pmol/l)\nshort communications\n \nthe weight observed with prescription H1 antihistamine use is\nrelated to the disruption of H1 receptor expression and bind-\ning leading to impaired insulin and leptin signaling. More\nresearch is necessary to determine the extent of histamine's\nrole in energy metabolism.\nThe OR for being overweight in prescription H1 antihista-\nmine users was 1.55. ORs, as calculated in this study, tend to\nbe an overestimation of the actual relative risk, but provide a\nworthwhile approximation. Although two-thirds of Americans\nare overweight or obese, it is crucial to further examine factors\nassociated with weight gain.\nAnalysis of this nature provides some limitations. First, the\nanalysis was conducted on twice as many women as men.\nAccording to the limited sample, the association between pre-\nscription H1 antihistamine use and obesity seems stronger in\nmen compared to women, so more research should be con-\nNHANES data set only reports prescription medication use.\nSeveral H1 antihistamines are available without a prescription,\nso the actual number of individuals in the sample taking an H1\nantihistamine is unknown. An estimated 50 million people in\nthe United States suffer from allergies, with ~35\u00ad50% of them\nusing over-the-counter antihistamines; thus, this analysis may\nbe underestimating the impact of antihistamines. Because\nH1 antihistamines are increasingly accessible, they may be\n\ncontributing to weight gain and increased development of\nmetabolic syndrome. Although causation cannot be attributed\nto prescription H1 antihistamine use only based on this cross-\nsectional analysis, it is imperative to explore the relationship\nbetween increased antihistamine use, obesity, and underlying\nrisk factors.\n"
