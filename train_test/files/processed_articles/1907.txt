Given that\nthe science of HIV/STD prevention\nfor young people is predicated on\nthe critical assumption that self-\nreported sexual behaviors are valid,\nit is important to determine the de-\ngree of association that exists be-\ntween STD testing and self-reported\nbehavior in young adults. Although\nsome data suggest that self-report of\nsexual behaviors may be prone to\nbias,11\u00ad13 an evaluation using a nation-\nally representative sample has not\nbeen reported.\nThe primary purpose of this study was\nto determine if young adults' reports\nof recent sexual behavior (presence of\npenile/vaginal sex in the previous 12\nmonths) correspond with the pres-\nence of laboratory-confirmed nonviral\nSTDs assessed by nucleic acid amplifi-\ncation testing among a nationally rep-\nresentative sample of young adults.\nThe secondary purpose of this study\nwas to identify potential factors re-\nlated to discrepant reporting (ie, those\nwho had a laboratory-confirmed posi-\ntive STD result but who reported ab-\nstaining from sexual intercourse in 12-\nmonths before survey assessment and\nSTD testing) in this nationally repre-\nsentative sample.\nMETHODS\nStudy Design and Sample\nData from the National Longitudinal\nStudy of Adolescent Health (Add Health)\nwere used for this study. Participants\nwere initially recruited in 1994 (grades\n7\u00ad12) for wave 1 of Add Health. Stratified\nsampling of high schools ensured that\nthe sample was nationally representa-\noriginal participants were reinter-\nviewed.Additionaldetailsaboutthesam-\nple and methods have been described\nelsewhere.5\nData Collection\nData collection occurred in the partic-\nipants' homes. Self-reported mea-\nsures in wave 3 were collected by in-\nhome interviewers using audio\ncomputer-assisted self-interviewing to\nreduce reporting bias to sensitive\nhealth-risk behaviors. Evidence sug-\ngests that this method of data collec-\ntion optimizes the validity of adoles-\ncent and young adults' responses to\nsensitive questions.14 Wave 3 also in-\ncluded the collection of biological\nspecimens to detect STDs. Participants\ncollected first-catch urine specimens\nthat were assayed for Chlamydia tra-\nchomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae\nusing the Abbott LCx Probe System (Ab-\nbott Park, IL). Specimens were stored\nhours after donation. Aliquots were as-\nsayed for the presence of Trichomonas\nvaginalis by using an in-house poly-\nmerase chain reaction enzyme-linked\nimmunosorbent assay with estab-\nlished and acceptable estimates of\nData Analysis\nThe analyses reported here are based\n3 participants who consented to un-\ndergo STD testing, which represents\n92% of the wave 3 sample. There were\nsome differences in rates of refusal to\nundergo STD testing as a function of\nrace (white and Asian participants\nwere slightly more likely to refuse),\nage (those who refused were slightly\nolder), and education (those who had\ncompleted high school were slightly\nmore likely to refuse). There were no\ngender differences in rates of refusal.\nSampling weights provided by Add\nHealth were applied to all analyses to\nmaintain a nationally representative\nsample. All subsequent references to\nweighted percents in this article,\ntherefore, are presumed to accurately\nreflect the young adult population of\nthe United States who originally were\na nationally representative cohort of\nmiologic evidence that suggests that\nSTDs are disproportionately prevalent\namong minority youth, we compared\nblack, Hispanic, Asian, and other-race\nparticipants (a combination of the re-\nmaining ethnic categories) separately\nfrom white participants (the referent\ncategory) in the analyses as a control\nvariable. Gender, age, and level of edu-\ncation also were used in this capacity.\nAnalyses were conducted by using\nStata (Stata Corp, College Station,\nARTICLES\nTX),17 which takes full advantage of Add\nHealth's complex sampling design and\nweights to obtain correct SEs (and,\ntherefore, significance levels) for all\nanalyses. Procedures to perform a\ndesign-based analysis using Add\nHealth data, described by Chantala and\nTabor18 were followed to both maintain\nnational representation and to obtain\nunbiased parameter estimates. Logistic\nregression models were developed, ad-\njusted for the complex survey design, to\ncalculate adjusted odds ratios that per-\ntain to STD prevalence and participants'\ndiscrepant reports of abstaining from\nrecent (previous 12 months) penile/vag-\ninalsexandtestingpositiveforanSTDat\nwave 3 assessment.\nRESULTS\nDescriptive Findings\nmale participants (weighted percent:\n49.1).

Of all wave 3 partici-\npants who provided a urine sample for\nSTD screening, 964 (weighted percent:\n6.0) tested STD-positive for at least 1 of\nthe 3 assessed STDs. Of the STD-\npositive participants, 838 (weighted\npercent: 89.5) reported sex with at\nleast 1 partner in the previous 12\nreported abstaining from sexual activ-\nity during the previous 12 months be-\nfore assessment, and 60 of the latter\nparticipants (weighted percent: 5.9)\nreported never having penile/vaginal\nsex in their lifetime. Thus, 118 partici-\nticipants who tested positive for an\nSTD) demonstrated a discrepancy in\ntheir STD test results and self-report of\nrecent sexual activity.\nResults of Logistic Regression\nAnalyses\nControlling for age, level of education,\ngender, and race (white), females\nwere 36% more likely than were males\nto have a positive STD test (adjusted\nRace also was associated with a posi-\ntive STD test; with black participants\nbeing more than 6 times more likely\nthan white participants to test positive\nother-race participants (aOR: 3.52\nalso associated with testing positive\nfor an STD.

Indeed, more than 10% of\nthose with a positive STD test self-\nreported being abstinent in the previ-\nA second logistic regression model was\nconstructed to identify the determinants\nof discrepant findings (ie, a positive STD\ntest and self-report of abstaining from\nsex in the previous 12 months) among\nthose who tested positive for an STD.\nWith age, gender, level of education,\nand race (all minority groups com-\npared separately to white partici-\npants) entered into the model, findings\nindicate that none of these sociodemo-\ngraphic factors were significantly as-\nsociated with discrepancies between\nSTD test results and self-report among\nSTD-positive participants.*\nDISCUSSION\nFindings from this nationally represen-\ntative sample of US young adults sug-\ngest that the vast majority of STD-\npositive participants (89%) had\nconcordant self-reports of recent pe-\nnile/vaginal sex that matched their\nSTD-positive status. At the same time,\nhowever, the findings suggest that\nmore than 10% of STD-positive partici-\npants had discrepant results. This\nmeans they had a positive STD test but\nreported abstaining from sex in the\nprevious 12 months. It is interesting to\nnote that 6% of STD-positive partici-\npants reported no lifetime history of\npenile/vaginal sex.\nIn controlled analyses, it was intrigu-\ning that reporting penile/vaginal sex in\nthe previous 12 months increased the\nodds of testing positive for 1 of 3 STDs\nby only 2.1 times. In a logistic regres-\nsion model, an obtained odds ratio of\nthis magnitude would represent a\nmodest effect. In this case then it can\nbe said the value of young adults' self-\nreport to the prediction of a positive\ntest result was only modest. This coun-\nterintuitive finding suggests that sole\nreliance on young adults' self-reported\n*A more complex set of analyses, which involved all\nparticipants and examined interactions between\neach demographic category and self-reported ab-\nstinence as predictors of STD test results, yielded\nthe same pattern of results.\npenile/vaginal sexual activity as a\nmarker for STD acquisition risk may be\nimprecise and, further, could be prob-\nlematic. From a national behavioral sur-\nveillance perspective, researchers\nshould be cautious about making infer-\nences regarding STD risk among this\npopulation on the basis of responses to\nself-report surveys assessing recent\nsexual activity.\nAlthough the findings indicate discrep-\nancies between young adults' positive\nSTD status and their self-reported sex-\nual behavior, the use of a disease\nmarker (ie, STDs), although represent-\ning an objective and quantifiable\nmarker of sexual behavior, is not with-\nout controversy, nor is it a panacea for\navoiding bias associated with self-\nreport. With respect to intervention\nstudies, it is important to recognize\nthat reliance on incident STDs as a\nmeasure to evaluate the efficacy of an\nSTD/HIV risk-reduction program may\nnot be an appropriate outcome for ev-\nery study. It is unlikely, for instance,\nthat the incidence of STDs will be\nchanged in a short-term study con-\nducted in a population with little sexual\nactivity or in a community with a low\nprevalence of STDs. Conversely, popu-\nlations with a high degree of sexual ac-\ntivity and a high prevalence of STDs are\nideal for studying the effects of behav-\nioral interventions on STD incidence.\nMoreover, studies that incorporate\nSTDs as the primary outcome measure\nwill need to be conducted with suffi-\nciently large samples to provide suffi-\ncient statistical power to detect differ-\nences in STD incidence.\nWith respect to observational studies,\nthe use of STDs as a marker of risky\nsexual behavior may not reflect the\ntrue prevalence of risk behaviors in a\npopulation. Indeed, being a marker of\ndisease, STD prevalence, observed in\ncross-sectional studies, or STD inci-\ndence observed in longitudinal stud-\nies, may represent a marked underes-\ntimate of actual sexual risk behaviors\n(eg, proportion of young adults who\nare sexually active or frequency of sex-\nual intercourse) in a young adult pop-\nulation. Acquiring an STD is not only a\nfunction of unprotected sexual inter-\ncourse, but also reflects the preva-\nlence of STDs in young adults' socio-\nsexual network, risk of sex partners\n(ie, concurrency), and frequency and\nproficiency of correct condom use.\nThe lack of associations regarding dis-\ncrepancies between STD status and\nself-reported sexual behavior is strik-\ning. Although it may be reasonable to\nexpect that discrepancies in reporting\nwould vary by gender, race, age, or ed-\nucation, this was not observed. In es-\nsence, discrepant reporting may be\nlikely among young adults regardless\nof gender or race. Thus, future re-\nsearch should test novel assessment\ntechniques designed to minimize oc-\ncurrences of discrepant reporting for\ndiverse populations of young adults.\nFrom a clinical standpoint, the discrep-\nancies between STD positivity and self-\nreported sexual behavior identified in\nthis nationally representative sample\nsuggest that routine STD screening\nmay be beneficial and necessary to re-\nduce STD morbidity among young\nadults. In addition, given that no socio-\ndemographic characteristics differen-\ntiated young adults with discrepant re-\nsults (ie, STD-positive but reported no\nrecent penile/vaginal sex) from those\nwithout (ie, STD-positive but reported\npenile/vaginal recent sex), routine\nscreening for common STDs may be\nuseful for all young adults, regardless\nof self-reported sexual history, race,\ngender, or age.\nThe study is not without limitations,\nand plausible alternative hypotheses\nthat may explain, in part, the finding of\ndiscrepancies in having a laboratory-\nconfirmed STD and young adults' self-\nreported abstinence. Foremost is the\nabsence of a baseline measure of STD\nstatus. Specimens were collected only\nas part of the wave 3 assessment; thus,\nthe STDs identified are \"prevalent\"\nSTDs, not necessarily incident infec-\ntions. Also, only urine specimens were\ncollected for STD testing, which gener-\nally only detect STDs acquired through\npenile/vaginal sex, thereby not detect-\ning STDs transmitted through other\nmeans of sexual contact (ie, anal sex\nor oral/genital sex). Although urine\ntests could capture urethral infections\nacquired through anal sex among men\nwho have sex with men,19 no informa-\ntion was collected about this behavior.\nSecond is the duration of the time in-\nterval from the wave 2 to the wave 3\nassessment. The question used to cat-\negorize participants into those with\nsexual experience and those who were\nabstinent is based on the wave 3 retro-\nspective assessment of young adults'\nprevious 12 months. Thus, given that\nthe time interval between wave 2 and\nwave 3 assessments is longer than 12\nmonths, coupled with the fact that STD\nspecimens were not collected in wave\n2, participants could be accurate and\nreliable in their reporting of absti-\nnence (over the previous 12 months)\nat wave 3 and still have an STD because\nthe infection could have been acquired\nbefore the 12 month assessment inter-\nval, at a time when they may have been\nsexually active (eg, wave 2). Although\nstudies that report on persistent C tra-\nchomatis infections among women\nsuggest it can persist for more than 1\nstudies also report that among asymp-\ntomatic women, 50% of C trachoma-\ntis infections clear within 1 year of in-\nfection, and 82% within 2 years of\ninfection. In addition, clearance rates\ndiffered by age of first sex, oral contra-\nceptive use, and serotype,21 and none\nof these studies report on persistence\nof infection in males, or clearance\nrates in males. Thus, we have no way to\naccurately estimate how often persis-\ntent infections occurred in this mixed\nARTICLES\ngender sample of young adults. In ad-\ndition, the accuracy of the STD tests\nused in the Add Health study is less\nthan perfect, and therefore some\nfalse-negatives and false-positives\nwere inevitable. It is difficult to esti-\nmate the rate of false-positives as\nthese data were obtained from a na-\ntionally representative community-\nbased sample and most available esti-\nmates of the sensitivity and specificity\nof the STD assays are based on clinic\nsamples. However, the false-positive\nrate (typically computed by subtract-\ning a test's specificity from 1) was\nlikely quite small, as reported specific-\nities for the STD assays used by Add\nseveral studies.22\u00ad24 Another limitation\nis the length of the interval that as-\nsessed young adults' sexual behavior.\nGiven the length of the reporting inter-\nval, the previous 12 months, young\nadults' retrospective recall could be\ninaccurate (they did have sex, but do\nnot recall having sex), making the as-\nsessment of sexual behavior unreli-\nable. In this case, the data would still\nbe invalid; however, the source of bias\nwould be attributable to poor recall,\nnot volitional underreporting of sexual\nbehavior, which is also a likely source of\nbias. Indeed, recent data suggest that\nshorter recall periods yield more reli-\nable reports of sexual behaviors.25 Poor\nrecall, although plausible, may be more\nlikely among younger adolescents\nwhosesexualbehaviorissporadicorep-\nisodic rather than older adolescents or\nyoung adults who have a greater fre-\nquency and regularity of sexual inter-\ncourse.Singly,ormorelikely,acombina-\ntionoflimitationsmaypartlyaccountfor\nthe observed discrepancy between\nyoung adults' positive STD status and\nself-reported abstinence.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe findings indicate discrepancy be-\ntween young adults' positive STD sta-\ntus and self-reported penile/vaginal\nsexual behavior. Specifically, more\nthan 10% of young adults detected with\n1 of 3 assessed STDs reported being\nabstinent in the year before testing. In\naddition, none of the sociodemo-\ngraphic factors assessed, including\nage, level of education, race, and gen-\nder, were significantly associated with\ndiscrepant findings (ie, STD-positive\nand self-reporting no recent penile-\nvaginal sex) in this nationally repre-\nsentative sample. The implications of\nthe findings suggest that although self-\nreport remains necessary, it may\nnot be sufficient to provide a precise\nestimate of STD-positive young adults'\nsexual risk behavior. When appropri-\nate, other objective and quantifiable\nnondisease biological markers are\nneeded to more precisely gauge young\nadults' sexual behavior as well as cor-\nroborate their self-report of sexual be-\nhaviors. Finally, from a clinical per-\nspective, the implications of our\nfindings are that all young people re-\nceiving clinical services, whether their\nsexual history indicates they are re-\ncently sexual active or not, should be\ntested for prevalent STDs, like those\nassayed in this study. Importantly, our\nfindings reveal that if pediatricians\nand adolescent medicine physicians\ndo not test all young people, there are\nlikely a substantial number of missed\ncases of STDs that will go undiagnosed,\nuntreated, and spread to future sex\npartners.\n"
