We utilized a U.S. nationally representative study to examine\nwhether CMV infection is associated with all-cause and CVD-related mortality. We also assessed whether CRP level mediated\nor modified these relationships.\nMethodology/Principal Findings: Data come from subjects $25 years of age who were tested for CMV and CRP level and\nwere eligible for mortality follow-up on December 31st, 2006 (N = 14153) in the National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey (NHANES) III (1988\u00ad1994). Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95%\nconfidence intervals (CI) for all-cause and CVD-related mortality by CMV serostatus. After adjusting for multiple confounders,\nCMV seropositivity remained statistically significantly associated with all-cause mortality (HR 1.19, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.41). The\nassociation between CMV and CVD-related mortality did not achieve statistical significance after confounder adjustment.\nCRP did not mediate these associations. However, CMV seropositive individuals with high CRP levels showed a 30.1% higher\nrisk for all-cause mortality and 29.5% higher risk for CVD-related mortality compared to CMV seropositive individuals with\nlow CRP levels.\nConclusions/Significance: CMV was associated with a significant increased risk for all-cause mortality and CMV seropositive\nsubjects who also had high CRP levels were at substantially higher risk for both for all-cause and CVD-related mortality than\nsubjects with low CRP levels. Future work should target the mechanisms by which CMV infection and low-level\ninflammation interact to yield significant impact on mortality.\nCitation: Simanek AM, Dowd JB, Pawelec G, Melzer D, Dutta A, et al.

This pathogen is never cleared from the\nbody, persisting in a number of tissues via hypothesized\nmechanisms including chronic productive infection and/or latent\ninfection with periodic subclinical reactivation [2,3]. Recently,\nCMV has been linked to a variety of chronic diseases with an\ninflammatory component including cardiovascular disease (CVD)\n[4\u00ad7], cancer [8,9], cognitive decline including vascular dementia\nSeveral mechanisms have been hypothesized to link CMV\ninfection and CVD in both human and animal studies [15\u00ad20].\nCMV antigen and DNA have been identified in atherosclerotic\nvessels of the human cardiovascular system [21\u00ad23] and murine\nmodels suggest an inflammatory link with CVD progression\n[19,20]. It has been hypothesized that CMV either directly infects\nthe vessels of the heart and replicates at low levels, or is delivered\nto the vessel wall by infected circulating monocytes arriving at sites\nof cardiovascular injury or inflammation [24]. The presence of\nCMV in the vessel walls may induce smooth muscle cell\nproliferation and migration, increased uptake of oxidized low-\ndensity lipoprotein and expression of cytokines and chemokines as\nwell as increased procoagulant activity by endothelial cells\ndirect invasion as a result of molecular mimicry, whereby viral\nantigens trigger an immune response cross-reacting on self-\npeptides expressed on uninfected host tissues [16,27,28]. For\nexample, two CMV-derived proteins, UL122 and US28, are\nheat shock protein (HSP) 60 [29,30]. Thus, infection with CMV\nmay contribute to progression of atherosclerosis and other CVD\nhealth outcomes via several mechanisms.\nCMV has also been associated with other chronic diseases of\naging, including physical impairment, cognitive decline and cancer\n[8\u00ad14]. The specific mechanisms responsible for these associations\nhave not been fully elucidated, but are likely to have an immune\nand inflammatory component. Indeed, CMV seropositivity\nbelongs to a cluster of immune factors constituting an ``immune\nrisk profile'' associated with all-cause mortality at 2, 4 and 6-year\nfollow-up in elderly Swedes in the OCTO/NONA longitudinal\nstudies [31\u00ad34]. CMV is a driver of age-associated immune\nchanges in elderly populations which lead to a reduction in the\nnumber of nai\n\u00a8ve T cells available for fighting new infections [34\u00ad\n37]. Reactivations or superinfections may result in higher titers of\nCMV immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies and increased levels of\npro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor\nnecrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) [38\u00ad40]. C-reactive protein (CRP)\nlevels also increase as a consequence of reactivation or leakage of\nthe virus from host cells, via the action of IL-6 produced in the\nliver [17,41\u00ad43]. These inflammatory markers have been linked to\nboth all-cause and CVD-related mortality [44\u00ad46]. Thus, CMV\nmay impact both CVD-related and all-cause mortality through its\naffects on chronic inflammatory and immune-related changes seen\nwith aging.\nAlthough not all studies have supported a relationship between\nCMV and chronic disease outcomes [47,48], a majority of\npublished studies have reported a significant relationship between\nCMV and mortality, in conjunction with markers of inflammation\nrelationship between CMV antibody titer and all-cause/CVD\nmortality among elderly Latinos finding that subjects with CMV\n1.01, 1.80) times higher risk for CVD mortality in models adjusted\nfor age, gender, education and comorbidity index [49]. The\nauthors found the effect of CMV on mortality was partially\nmediated by a composite measure of two inflammatory markers,\nTNF-a and IL-6, but not CRP since it was unrelated to mortality\nin their study population [49]. In contrast, Blankenberg et al.\nfound CMV to be associated with cardiac mortality among\npersons with existing coronary artery disease (CAD) only in\nsubjects with elevated IL-6 levels (hazard ratio (HR) 3.2, 95%\nconfidence interval (CI): 1.4, 7.3) and not in those without IL-6\nelevation, suggesting effect modification by IL-6 in the association\nbetween CMV and CVD-related mortality [52]. Also examining\nthe effect of CMV antibody titers on mortality, Strandberg et al.\nassessed 7-year risk for mortality in a small cohort of community-\ndwelling 75\u00ad90 year-olds with underlying CVD in Finland [50].\nThe authors found that mortality was significantly greater among\nsubjects in the highest CMV IgG quartile, compared with the\nlowest quartile and that this association remained significant after\ncontrolling for several covariates including CRP, suggesting that\nCRP did not mediate this pathway [50]. Furthermore, Muhlestein\net al. examined the association between seropositivity to CMV, H.\npylori and Chlamydia pneumonia infections, as well as high CRP level\nand mortality among patients with a mean age of 65 years that\nwere predominantly male and had angiographically demonstrated\nCAD [51]. Of the three pathogens assessed, only seropositivity to\nCMV was significantly predictive of mortality. The authors also\nfound that risk for mortality was greatest among CMV seropositive\nsubjects with CRP levels in the highest tertile, suggesting a joint\neffect of CMV seropositivity and high CRP level on mortality\namong their sample of individuals with underlying CAD [51].\nEven though these studies suggest an association between CMV,\ninflammation and mortality, they were conducted in predomi-\nnantly older age populations, of specific gender or race/ethnic\ngroups and/or among participants who have underlying CAD or\nCVD health conditions. While one cross-sectional study conducted\namong a U.S. population-based cohort of individuals aged 45 and\nolder found that CMV was associated with reported history of\nCVD, it remains unclear whether a temporal relationship exists\nbetween CMV and mortality in the U.S. population [6].\nMoreover, the role of inflammatory markers such as IL-6, TNF-\na and CRP as mediators or effect modifiers of the relationship\nbetween CMV and mortality is unclear [14,49\u00ad52]. Some studies\nsupport mediation by these markers, while others suggest effect\nmodification [14,49\u00ad52]. Therefore, research examining whether\ninflammatory markers mediate or modify the relationship between\nCMV and mortality in the U.S. is needed.\nThe purpose of this study was to examine whether seropositivity\nfor CMV predicts all-cause as well as CVD-related mortality and\nwhether CRP mediated or modified these relationships in a\nnationally representative U.S. population of individuals aged 25\nand older.\nMethods\nEthics statement\nThe University of Michigan Institutional Review Board\nStudy population\nData come from the National Health and Nutrition Examina-\nmultistage stratified probability survey which collects information\non the health and nutrition of the United States civilian\nnoninstitutionalized population. The survey was carried out by\nthe National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention and is meant to be representative\nof the U.S. population. In addition, we used data from the\nNHANES III-Linked Mortality file in which the mortality status of\nNHANES III participants, $17 years of age, was determined by\nprobabilistic matching between NHANES III participants and the\nU.S. National Death Index (NDI) [53].\nA total of 33994 subjects were interviewed in NHANES III.\nOur study sample is limited to subjects that were 25 years of age\nand older (range 25\u00ad90 years of age) at time of examination\n(0.3%) were excluded from the analyses of CVD-related mortality\nbecause their cause of death could not be ascertained.\nLaboratory Analyses\nCMV-specific IgG was measured by a commercially available\nEnzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) (Quest Interna-\ntional, Inc., Miami, FL). Sera with values near the ELISA cutoff\nwere confirmed with a second ELISA assay (bioMerieux, Inc.,\nDurham, NC). If the results from the first two tests disagreed, an\nImmunofluorescence Assay (IFA) (Bion International, Inc., Park\nRidge, IL), was used and results from this test were provided as the\nfinal seropositivity test result. The sensitivity and specificity of\nthese tests have been estimated to be 98% and 99%, respectively\nCytomegalovirus, Inflammation and Mortality in US\n[1,54]. Although CMV IgG and IgM antibody titer levels are\navailable in NHANES III, values for subjects over age 49 were\ntop-coded, making them unusable as a predictor of mortality.\nSera collected for the purpose of CRP testing were stored at -70\nC and analyzed within 2 months using a modification of the\nBehring Latex-Enhanced CRP assay on the Behring Nephelom-\neter Analyzer systemTM (Behring Diagnostics, Westwood, MA).\nBoth within and between-assay quality control procedures were\nused and the coefficient of variation was 3.2%\u00ad16.1% through the\nperiod of data collection. The limit of detection for CRP was\nSera collected for the purpose of cholesterol testing were frozen\nand stored at -20 C, then shipped on dry ice within four weeks to\nthe Johns Hopkins University Lipid Research Clinic Laboratory\nwhich participates in the Lipid Standardization Program of the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention. Total cholesterol was\nmeasured enzymatically on a Hitachi 717 analyzer using a\ncommercially available reagent mixture (Boehringer Manheim\nDiagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) [55].\nMeasures\nResults from the CMV IgG antibody tests were dichotomized as\nseronegative or seropositive based on the ELISA results. Results\nfrom the CRP tests were dichotomized as low: ,0.3 mg/dL and\nhigh: $0.3 mg/dL according to commonly used cut-off values\nthought to have clinical significance for prediction of heart attack\nor stroke [56]. Combined CMV serostatus and CRP level was\ncategorized as CMV seronegative/low CRP, CMV seronegative/\nhigh CRP, CMV seropositive/low CRP and CMV seropositive/\nhigh CRP.\nMortality status was obtained primarily from the NDI; however,\nother sources of mortality status included indication of deceased\nstatus from the Social Security Administration, the Centers for\nMedicare and Medicaid Services, or death certificate review [53].\nCause of death was coded using the International Classification of\nclassified as CVD-related deaths and included, causes of death\nsuch as hypertensive heart disease, atherosclerosis including\ncoronary and cerebrovascular disease, heart failure, and aortic\naneurysms. Persons who survived the entire follow-up period were\nadministratively censored on December, 31st 2006. Follow-up time\nfor each person was calculated as the difference between the\nNHANES III examination date and the last known date alive or\ncensored [57]. Persons who died of non-CVD causes were\nconsidered censored at the date of death for CVD mortality\nanalysis.\nCovariates hypothesized to be potential confounders of the\nrelationship between CMV serostatus and mortality included age,\ngender, race/ethnicity, country of origin, body mass index (BMI)\n(kg/m2), smoking status, diabetes status and education level,\nbecause these factors have been shown to predict both risk for\ninfection and mortality [1,58\u00ad62]. Age in years at examination was\nself-reported and treated as a continuous variable. Gender was\ndichotomized as female and male. Race/ethnicity was self-\nreported as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican-\nAmerican or Other. Country of origin was reported as the state or\nforeign country in which subjects were born and was categorized\nas U.S. or Other. Education level was chosen as a marker of life\ncourse socioeconomic position most likely to precede CMV\ninfection and self-reported as years of education and treated as\ncontinuous [63,64]. BMI (kg/m2) was computed from weight and\nBMI $30. Smoking status was self-reported and categorized into\nnever (did not smoke 100+ cigarettes in one's lifetime), past\n(smoked 100+ cigarettes in one's lifetime but do not currently\nsmoke) and current smoker (smoked 100+ cigarettes in one's\nlifetime and currently smoke). Diabetes was self-reported as\nwhether a doctor ever informed subjects they had diabetes or\nnot and dichotomized as reported or not reported. In addition, use\nof non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) was hypothe-\nsized as a confounder in the association between the combined\neffect of CMV serostatus/CRP level and mortality [65,66].\nSubjects were considered to use NSAIDs if they reported use of\nprescription drugs in the past month with a primary classification\nof NSAID according to the Product Information Branch, Center\nfor Drug Evaluation and Research at the U.S. DHHS Food and\nDrug Administration or if subjects self-reported taking any Advil,\nNuprin, Medipren or Ibuprofen in the past month [67].\nTotal serum cholesterol and hypertension were hypothesized as\nmediators in the pathway between the combined effect of CMV\nserostatus/CRP level and CVD-related mortality. Serum total\ncholesterol level was dichotomized as low (,240 mg/dL) and high\n($240 mg/dL) according to the National Cholesterol Education\nProgram Expert Panel [68] and hypertension was reported as ever\nhaving been told by a doctor or health professional that you had\nhypertension, also called high blood pressure.\nStatistical analyses\nStatistical analyses were performed using SAS, version 9.2, with\nSAS-callable SUDAAN, version 10.0.1 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary,\nNC) [69]. All analyses used appropriate weights and adjustments\nfor strata and clustering used in the complex study design used in\nNHANES III. Bivariate relationships between CMV serostatus,\nCRP level, all-cause and CVD-related mortality and potential\nconfounders including age, gender, race/ethnicity, country of\norigin, education level, BMI (kg/m2), smoking status, diabetes\nstatus and NSAID use were assessed. Covariates were considered\nconfounders based on a priori hypotheses and if they were\nassociated with the exposure and associated with the outcome\namong the unexposed [70]. T-tests (two-tailed) for difference in\nmeans and Pearson chi-square tests of independence for\nproportions and test for trend among demographic groupings\nwere calculated.\nKaplan-Meier survival curves were plotted for all-cause and\nCVD-related mortality by CMV serostatus to examine the\nunadjusted association between CMV serostatus and all-cause/\nCV-related mortality. Survival time was measured in months since\nmobile or home examination. Cox proportional hazard models\nwere used to estimate the confounder adjusted HR and 95% CI\nfor the association between CMV serostatus and all-cause/CVD-\nrelated mortality first in models adjusted for sociodemographic\nfactors (age, gender, race/ethnicity, country of origin and\neducation level), then, in models additionally adjusted for clinical\nfactors (BMI (kg/m2), smoking status and diabetes status and last\nin models also controlling for CRP level. In order to assess whether\nCRP level mediated the relationship between CMV and mortality\nwe compared the HR for all-cause and CVD-related mortality,\nbefore and after controlling for CRP in the fully adjusted model.\nAdjusted Wald F statistics were estimated to compare follow-up\ntime in months from exam to death between those CMV\nseronegative versus CMV seropositive in fully adjusted models.\nTo assess whether CRP modified the relationship between\nCMV and all-cause/CVD-related mortality we first examined the\ncrude association between combined CMV serostatus and CRP\nlevel by plotting unadjusted Kaplan-Meier survival curves for all-\ncause and CVD-related mortality by combined CMV serostatus\nCytomegalovirus, Inflammation and Mortality in US\nand CRP level over the follow-up period. Survival time was\nmeasured in months since mobile or home examination. Next we\nused Cox proportional hazard models to estimate the confounder\nadjusted HR and 95% CI for the association between CMV\nserostatus/CRP level and all-cause/CVD-related mortality first in\nmodels adjusted for sociodemographic factors (age, gender, race/\nethnicity, country of origin and education level) and second, in\nmodels adjusted for clinical factors (BMI (kg/m2), smoking status,\ndiabetes status and NSAID use). Last, adjusted Wald F statistics\nwere estimated to compare follow-up time in months from exam to\ndeath between each combination of CMV serostatus and CRP\nlevel, adjusting for covariates.\nTo examine whether more proximal risk factors for CVD,\nincluding total cholesterol level and hypertension, lie in the\npathway between the combined effect of CMV seropositivity/high\nCRP level and CVD-related mortality, we compared the HR for\nCVD-related mortality for those CMV seropositive with high CRP\nlevel to individuals that were CMV seronegative with low CRP\nlevel, before and after controlling for these factors.\nResults\nWeighted estimates of the bivariate relationships between\ncovariates of interest and CMV serostatus are shown in Table 1.\nThe weighted proportion of those seropositive to CMV was 66.7%.\nHigher mean age, female gender, non-white race/ethnicity, country\nof origin outside the U.S., lower mean education level, low BMI\nBMI (25# BMI ,30), reported diabetes and high CRP level\n($0.3 mg/dL) were associated with CMV seropositivity.

During the mean 13.7 years of\nfollow-up from exam, the population estimate for the proportion\ndying from all causes was 18.9% and the proportion dying from\nCVD-related mortality was 8.0%.\nThe unadjusted Kaplan-Meier survival curves for all-cause\nmortality by CMV serostatus are shown in Figures 1 and 2.\nOverall mean survival duration since time of exam for those CMV\nseronegative subjects. Table S1. shows the HR and 95% CI from\nCox proportional hazard models examining the association\nbetween CMV and all-cause/CVD-related mortality, mutually\nadjusted for hypothesized confounders. After adjusting for age,\ngender, race/ethnicity, country of origin, education level, BMI\n(kg/m2), smoking status and diabetes status, CMV seropositivity\nremained statistically significantly associated with all-cause mor-\nexam to death from all causes was significantly different between\nCMV seronegative and CMV seropositive subjects (Adjusted Wald\ncause mortality was not further attenuated after controlling for\n1.01, 1.41). Although the magnitude of effect for CVD-related\nmortality was similar to that of all-cause mortality, the association\nbetween CMV and CVD-related mortality was not statistically\nsignificant in the fully adjusted model and follow-up time from\nexam to death from CVD-related mortality for those CMV\nseropositive versus seronegative was not statistically significantly\nadjustment for CRP level did not further attenuate the association\nbetween CMV and CVD-related mortality (HR 1.19, 95% CI:\nFigures 3 and 4 show the unadjusted Kaplan-Meier survival\ncurves for all-cause and CVD-related mortality by the four\ndifferent permutations of CMV serostatus and CRP level.

Hence, even after confounder adjustment,\nFigure 1. Kaplan-Meier survival curve for all-cause mortality by cytomegalovirus serostatus.

After adjusting for age, gender, race/ethnicity, country of origin, education level, BMI (kg/m2), smoking status\nand diabetes status, follow-up time from exam to death from all causes was significantly different between CMV seronegative and CMV seropositive\nsubjects (Adjusted Wald F = 4.66, p-value = 0.0358). CMV = cytomegalovirus and MEC = mobile examination center.\nCytomegalovirus, Inflammation and Mortality in US\nsubjects that were CMV seropositive and had high CRP had a\n30.1% higher risk for all-cause mortality and 29.5% higher risk for\nCVD-related mortality compared to CMV seropositive subjects\nwho had low CRP levels. The follow-up time from exam to death\nfrom all-causes for CMV seropositive individuals with high CRP\nwas significantly different from CMV seropositive individuals with\nmodels. In addition, the follow-up time from exam to CVD-\nrelated death for CMV seropositive individuals with high CRP was\nsignificantly different from CMV seropositive individuals with low\nmodels. After adjustment for total cholesterol level and hyperten-\nsion, the HR for CVD-related mortality among those CMV\nseropositive with high CRP level compared to individuals that\nwere CMV seronegative with low CRP, was attenuated by 3.5%\nDiscussion\nThis study examined whether seropositivity for CMV, an\nindicator of prior infection with this persistent herpesvirus,\npredicts all-cause as well as CVD-related mortality and whether\nCRP mediates or modifies this relationship in a nationally\nrepresentative U.S. population of individuals 25 years of age and\nolder. The results of our study suggest that CMV seropositivity is\nindependently associated with all-cause mortality, after control-\nling for age, gender, race/ethnicity, country of origin, education\nlevel, BMI (kg/m2), smoking status and diabetes status.\nFurthermore, adjustment for CRP level did not attenuate this\nrelationship.\nAfter confounder adjustment, CMV serostatus was no longer\nsignificantly associated with CVD mortality. It is possible that the\nstrong relationship between CMV and all-cause mortality\nobserved in this study indicates that CMV seropositive subjects\nare dying of competing causes before they have the chance to\ndevelop CVD, attenuating the relationship between CMV and\nCVD-related mortality. High levels of CRP, however, augmented\nthe effect of CMV seropositivity on both all-cause and CVD-\nrelated mortality. Among CMV seropositive subjects, those with\nhigh CRP levels showed approximately a 30% higher risk for all-\ncause mortality and for CVD-related mortality, compared to those\nwith low CRP levels. Adjusting for CVD risk factors such as high\ntotal cholesterol and hypertension resulted in a moderate\nattenuation (decrease of 3.5%) of the association between\ncombined CMV seropositivity and high CRP level and CVD-\nrelated mortality, supporting the hypothesis that CMV seropos-\nitivity along with subclinical inflammation impacts risk for\nmortality in part through their combined contribution to other\nmore proximal CVD risk factors. Nonetheless, these markers of\nCVD did not completely attenuate the association, indicating that\nother factors may also be on the pathway or that there is a direct\nrelationship between CMV infection, CRP levels and CVD-\nrelated mortality. Thus, our research suggests that efforts\nFigure 2. Kaplan Meier survival curve for cardiovascular disease-related mortality by cytomegalovirus serostatus.

After adjusting for age, gender, race/ethnicity, country of origin,\neducation level, BMI (kg/m2), smoking status and diabetes status, follow-up time from exam to death from CVD was not significantly different\nbetween CMV seronegative and CMV seropositive subjects (Adjusted Wald F = 2.66, p-value = 0.1092. CMV = cytomegalovirus and MEC = mobile\nexamination center.\nCytomegalovirus, Inflammation and Mortality in US\nidentifying the mechanisms of these additive effects and targeted\nCVD intervention studies among subpopulations with these\nbiomarker risk profiles are warranted.\nIt has been suggested that individuals who are CMV\nseropositive and also have a subclinical inflammatory profile are\nmore susceptible to the atherogenic effects of CMV infection,\nwhereas those without a subclinical response are not as susceptible\n[43,51]. Studies support a correlation between increased CRP and\nincreased CMV antibody titers- a marker of reactivation - but the\ndirectionality among these two biological markers is unclear\n[49,50,71]. If elevated CRP is a marker of ``reactivating'' CMV\ninfection, whereas low CRP indicates resolved or ``latent'' CMV\ninfection, we would expect CRP levels to be increased during\ntimes of CMV reactivation and for CMV infection to be most\ndetrimental under these circumstances. Since CMV has been\nfound to directly invade cardiovascular tissues [21\u00ad23], periods of\nCMV ``reactivation'' may accelerate the atherogenic process by\nincreasing the detrimental effects of tissue invasion such as smooth\nother hand, if, as hypothesized, molecular mimicry plays a role in\nthe relationship between CMV and CVD-mortality, the immune\nsystem may become hyper-stimulated during periods of CMV\n``reactivation'' leading to an exacerbated attack against host tissues\npresenting cross-reacting human peptides [27\u00ad30]. For these\nreasons, the greatest physiological harm caused by CMV is likely\nto occur during ``reactivation'' events, possibly at a subclinical\nlevel. If subclinical ``reactive'' CMV infection is most important in\nthe etiology of mortality, then situations that cause CMV\nreactivation over the lifecourse, such as stress, inflammation\ncaused by co-infections, immunosuppression and aging may play\nimportant key roles in determining the extent to which CMV\ninfection is detrimental to health.\nAlthough CMV IgG and IgM antibody titer levels are available\nin NHANES III, values for subjects over age 49 were top-coded,\nmaking them unusable as a predictor of mortality. It was also not\npossible to correlate antibody levels as an indicator of ``reactivat-\ning'' versus ``latent'' CMV infection in our study population. In\naddition, approximately 64% of our study population had CRP\nlevels under the limit of detection (,0.3 mg/dl), because more\nsensitive assays that are currently available for measurement of\nhigh-sensitivity CRP below this limit of detection were not used in\nNHANES III, making it difficult to examine CRP levels\ncontinuously. Hence, one limitation of our study is that were\nunable to examine the relationship between CMV antibody titer\nand CRP level more closely, which might have allowed us to\nidentify a more precise interaction between CMV infection and\nCRP levels and their effect on all-cause and CVD-related\nmortality. Another limitation associated with using CRP as a\npredictor of mortality is that very high values of CRP may\nrepresent acute infection or injury not necessarily associated with\ncardiovascular disease. In addition, the causal relations and\ntherapeutic implications pertaining to CRP and CVD are\nFigure 3.

However, other inflammatory markers\nthat have been shown to play a significant role in the pathway\nbetween CMV and mortality, such as IL-6, are not available in\nNHANES III. Thus, it was not possible to determine whether\nother inflammatory markers in addition to CRP mediate or\nmodify the relationship between CMV and mortality. Nonetheless,\nFigure 4. Kaplan-Meier survival curve for cardiovascular disease-related mortality by combined cytomegalovirus serostatus and c-\nreactive protein level. Unadjusted Kaplan-Meier survival curves for cardiovascular disease (CVD)-related mortality by combined cytomegalovirus\n(CMV) serostatus and C-reactive Protein (CRP) level for 13963 subjects, $25 years of age, in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES) III from 1988\u00ad2006. After adjusting for age, gender, race/ethnicity, country of origin, education level, BMI (kg/m2), smoking status, diabetes\nstatus and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, follow-up time from exam to CVD-related death for CMV seropositive individuals with high CRP\nlevel was significantly different from CMV seropositive individuals with low CRP level (Adjusted Wald F = 9.10, p = 0.0040). CMV = cytomegalovirus,\nCRP = C-reactive Protein and MEC = mobile examination center. High CRP level: $0.3 mg/dL.\nTable 2. The Combined effect of Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Serostatus and C-reactive Protein (CRP) Level on All-Cause/\nCardiovascular Disease (CVD) -related Mortality in Subjects 25 Years of Age and Older in NHANES III.\nHazard Ratio (95% Confidence Interval)\nAll-Cause Mortality CVD-related Mortality\nCombined Factors\n{Model 1 for all-cause mortality (N = 14029) and for CVD-related mortality (N = 136981) adjusted for age, gender, race/ethnicity, country of origin and education level\nand reduced by 124 subjects due to missing data on country of origin and/or education level.\n{Model 2 for all-cause mortality (N = 13611) and for CVD-related mortality (N = 13569) adjusted for age, gender, race/ethnicity, country of origin, education level, body\nmass index (kg/m2), smoking status, diabetes status and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use. Model 2 for all-cause mortality reduced by an additional 418\nsubjects and model 2 for CVD-related mortality reduced by an additional 322 subjects due to missing data on body mass index, smoking status, diabetes status and/or\nnon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.\nCytomegalovirus, Inflammation and Mortality in US\nour exposure of interest, CMV serostatus, was laboratory-\nconfirmed and CRP was measured by standard methodologies\nAnother limitation to our study is that we utilized the updated\nNHANES III Linked Mortality Public-use File which was subject\nto data perturbation in which synthetic data was substituted for the\nactual date of death and underlying cause of death for selected\ndescendent records in order to reduce risk of respondent re-\nidentification [76]. Despite the data perturbation of date of death\nfor selected decedents in the public-use file, a comparison study\nbetween the public-use and restricted-use file (which does not\ncontain perturbed data) conducted by the NCHS, found that\nanalysis of all-cause and cause-specific mortality (heart disease,\nischemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease, in particular)\nby sociodemographic factors including as age, sex, race/ethnicity\nand education level to be comparable across files and concluded\nthat the discrepancies between the public-use and restricted-use\nfile were minor and that analysts should use the public-use file with\nconfidence [76]. Importantly, mortality status was rigorously\nverified by two sources (National Death Index (NDI) and/or death\ncertificate review) [53]. Furthermore, NDI is a validated method\nfor matching deaths in the U.S. to population-based datasets and\nfor obtaining cause of death [77].\nSeveral studies have examined the relationship between CMV\nand mortality [14,49\u00ad52]. However, these earlier studies have only\nexamined the relationship among specific gender and racial/\nethnic subgroups, often among subjects with existing CVD and\nprimarily compared mortality by CMV antibody titer level (not\nCMV serostatus). To the best of our knowledge, our study is the\nfirst to utilize a large, nationally representative U.S. population\nyears) to examine the relationship between CMV serostatus, CRP\nlevel and all-cause/CVD-related mortality. Therefore, the popu-\nlation studied here is much broader in age and on average younger\nthan the study populations utilized in several earlier studies\nexamining the impact of CMV infection on mortality. A moderate\nincrease in risk among a large population with a wide age range in\nthe US has important implications for potentially shifting the\npopulation burden of diseases [78].\nIf CMV infection plays a strong role in the etiology of all-cause\nand CVD-related mortality in conjunction with high CRP level,\nthe elimination of CMV infection via the development and\nadministration of treatments or vaccines [79] and/or targeting the\ninteraction of infection and CRP levels may reduce mortality rates\nin the United States. Colugnati et al. predicted that a vaccination\nagainst CMV would not need to have high efficacy nor wide-\nspread coverage to make a substantial impact on CMV\ntransmission and elimination of CMV from the population has\nthe potential to greatly reduce the incidence of disease attributable\nto CMV infection [6,80]. Therefore, elimination of CMV\ninfection is a potentially feasible and important avenue of study\nfor preventing mortality from all-causes and CVD in the United\nStates.\nSupporting Information\nTable S1 The Relationship between Cytomegalovirus\nSerostatus, C-Reactive Protein Level and All-Cause/\nCardiovascular Disease-Related Mortality in Subjects 25\nYears of Age and Older in NHANES III.\n"
