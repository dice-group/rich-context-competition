We offer the tripartite paradigm of cultural humility, transformative complicity, and\nempowerment to reduce power imbalances between service providers, elderly persons, and their communities. A force\nfield analysis considers the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPAC) and Accountable Care Organizations (ACO)\nto understand the restraining and driving forces affecting the institutionalization of inter/transdisciplinary teams. Effective\nevidence-based models that humanize geriatric services are offered to counter the current biomedical emphasis of Medicare/\nMedicaid policies and less-than-responsive geriatric institutional and educational systems. We highlight Bloom and Farragher's\nSanctuary Model of compassionate and democratic practices to address the negative effects of moral entrepreneurship and\nageism. The case of Florence, an LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, and questioning) grandparent with multiple health\nissues, is analyzed from biomedical, person in the environment, and a strength-based perspective.\n",

She is taking care of her teenage grandchild,\nidentifies herself as a member of the LGBTQ (lesbian, gay,\nbisexual, trans, and questioning) community, suffers from\nnumerous health challenges, is economically vulnerable,\nlives in an increasingly gentrified multi-ethnic neighbor-\nhood, and is in the early stages of dementia.\nMore than likely, even the best health care professional\nwill not be able to fully meet Florence's multiple needs.\nLimited resources exacerbated by the restrictions of overly\nspecialized knowledge, fragmented services, compounded\nsocial stigma, underprepared and culturally unresponsive\nhealth professionals, and confounding Medicare and\nMedicaid policy directives make effective treatment under\nthese circumstances nearly impossible (Hill, 2015; Turner,\nHinton, Gallagher-Thompson et al., 2015; Urbaska,\nSzczeniak, & Rymaszewska, 2015). In the case of an eco-\nnomically vulnerable elder like Florence, the marginalizing\neffects of compounded stigma are known to have serious\nconsequences, especially when her sexually underrepre-\nRobinson-Wood & Weber, 2016).
