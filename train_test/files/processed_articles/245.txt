Overweight was defined using the International Obesity Task\nForce reference of body mass index (BMI)-for-age. Differences between groups were\ntested using analysis of variance and Cochran\u00adMantel\u00adHaenszel tests.\nResults: Of the 95 overweight children, 36.8% remained overweight 2 years later\n(`tracking group'). Urban boys were three times more likely than rural boys to remain\noverweight (63.2% vs. 21.9%). At baseline, the tracking group had higher BMI, body\nweight and fat intake (% of energy), and lower carbohydrate intake (% of energy),\nthan the non-tracking group (who shifted from overweight to not overweight); they\nwere more likely to have a high-fat or high-meat diet, but less likely to have a diet high\nin carbohydrate or vegetables and fruit. During the follow-up, the tracking group\nincreased fat intake and reduced carbohydrate intake while the non-tracking group\ndid not; and they also grew slower in height but faster in weight. Tracking of\noverweight seemed to be related to tracking of high-meat (relative risk (RR) 2.4, 95%\nConclusion: Considerable changes in children's overweight status during childhood\nand adolescence were observed in China, a transitional society. Dietary patterns,\nparticularly dietary composition, seemed to influence the tracking patterns of\noverweight.\n",

Childhood and\nadolescence are identified as two critical periods for the\ndevelopment of obesity4, and extensive efforts have\nbegun to focus on the prevention and management of\nobesity during this period5. Numerous studies from\nindustrialised countries have shown that large proportions\nof obese children remain obese through adolescence and\ninto adulthood6\u00ad8. Most previous research has focused on\ninvestigating the risk factors for the development of\nobesity \u00ad studying why non-obese individuals become\nobese. Few studies based on free-living populations\nhave examined why obese children have different body\nweight status at older ages, although some small-scale\nintervention studies have tested the effects of vigorous\nbehaviour and lifestyle modification efforts9 \u00ad12. Such\nstudies will provide useful insights into the development\nof effective programmes, particularly for preventing\noverweight children from becoming obese adults.\nAnother major gap in the literature is the lack of\nunderstanding of the effects of childhood diet on\nobesity13. Although dietary intake is widely viewed as a\ncrucial determinant of obesity, to our knowledge only\nlimited longitudinal studies have examined this topic in\nfree-living children, and findings are inconclusive13 \u00ad17.\nMany previous studies have examined the association\nbetween children's dietary intake and body composition\n*Corresponding author: Email youwang@uic.edu\nPreliminary results were presented at the Federation of American\nSocieties for Experimental Biology (FASEB) 2001 Conference held at\nDownloaded from http:/www.cambridge.org/core.

Surprisingly, very few studies have\ndetected a positive relationship between energy intake\nand fatness, particularly in studies conducted in industri-\nalised countries13. Underreporting and other measure-\nment errors are suggested as possible explanations for the\nfailure to detect these associations20 \u00ad22. In a comprehen-\nsive meta-analysis, Parsons et al.13 concluded that findings\nabout the effects of various dietary factors are incon-\nclusive, and current literature provides little evidence to\nsuggest a relationship between any aspect of childhood\ndiet and fatness in adulthood in industrialised countries.\nIt is argued that the relationship between dietary intake\nand body composition may be more complex than what is\nindicated by a simple model of energy balance23,24.\nIncreasing evidence from studies, mainly in adults,\nsuggests that diet composition influences food and energy\nThis study examined the dynamic patterns of over-\nweight among Chinese children and their predictors. We\nfocused on the influence of dietary intake on tracking of\noverweight. Longitudinal data from the China Health and\nNutrition Survey (CHNS) were used. Over the past two\ndecades, China, while undergoing extremely rapid socio-\neconomic changes, has become a society where people's\nliving standards, lifestyles, diet and nutritional status are\nhighly heterogeneous28 \u00ad30. This provides an excellent\nsetting for enhancing our understanding of the aetiology\nof childhood obesity.\nMaterials and methods\nStudy design\nThe CHNS was a longitudinal study initiated in 1989 in\neight provinces that vary substantially in geography,\neconomic development, public resources and health\nindicators. Data have been collected in four rounds\n16 000 individuals. School-aged children have been\nincluded since 1991. More details about the study design\nand data collection are provided elsewhere31.\nSubjects\nOur analysis focused on 95 children who were initially\noverweight at baseline (1991) and were resurveyed in\nhad completed anthropometric measures. Individuals\nwere lost to follow-up mainly because of physical absence\nwhen the later surveys were conducted, e.g. being away\nfrom home due to attending school, working or visiting\nrelatives. Our analysis shows that the children's main\nbaseline sociodemographic characteristics such as age, sex\nand urban\u00adrural residence were not significantly different\nbetween those who were followed and those who missed\nused in the present study.*) The School of Public Health at\nthe University of North Carolina and the Chinese Academy\nof Preventive Medicine have reviewed and approved the\nprocedures for the protection of human subjects during\ndata collection.\nData collection\nAnthropometry\nMeasurements of body weight, height, triceps skinfold\nthickness and arm circumference were obtained from all\nfamily members (i.e. children and their parents) in each\nsurvey. Weight was measured in light, indoor clothing to\nthe nearest 0.1 kg with a beam balance scale. Height was\nmeasured without shoes to the nearest 0.1 cm using a\nportable stadiometer.\nDietary data\nDetailed household food consumption data and individual\ndietary intake data were collected for three consecutive\ndays in each survey. The sample was randomly allocated\nfrom Monday to Sunday and almost equally balanced\nacross the seven days of the week from each sampling\nunit. Household food consumption was determined by\ninventory change from the beginning to the end of each\nday. Individual dietary intake data (24-hour recall) for the\nsame three consecutive days were obtained from all family\nmembers. For young children (under 10 years), the\nmothers reported their dietary intake. The collection of\ndata on household food consumption and individual\ndietary intake allowed a check on the quality of each\nagainst the other. At the time of data collection, the\nindividual and household dietary data were compared and\nused to identify major discrepancies. When significant\ndiscrepancies were found, the household and the\nindividual in question were revisited and asked about\ntheir food consumption to resolve these discrepancies.\n*The 1997 data were not used in the present study because of several\nconsiderations. First, one of the eight provinces did not participate in\nthe 1997 survey. As a result, the sample size was reduced considerably\nin 1997. Second, only a small number of children (,15%) remained\noverweight in 1997 based on the International Obesity Task Force\n(IOTF) standard that we used. The small numbers did not allow us to\nmake meaningful comparisons between the two groups. Third, we\nsuspect that the IOTF reference might have a low sensitivity in\nidentifying overweight individuals in older adolescents from\ndeveloping countries31. However, no local body mass index (BMI)\nreference for child and adolescent overweight is available in China.\nFinally, increasing evidence shows a close association between\nsexual maturation and obesity. Our previous research and others\nfound that the median age of menarche among Chinese girls is\naround 13.7 years. Therefore, to limit our analysis within a 2-year\nwould help minimise the influence of puberty and that of other\nfactors listed above.\nY Wang et al.\nDownloaded from http:/www.cambridge.org/core.

Great\nefforts were made in the field to survey all subjects within a\nshort period in the autumn in each survey. The 1991\nChinese food consumption table34 was used to calculate\nsubjects' nutrient intakes.\nQuality control\nThe survey team comprised 20\u00ad23 nutritionists for each of\nthe provinces in each round of the survey. All interviewers\nhad at least a college degree and they had attended 10-day\ntraining sessions for each survey. Most interviewers had\nexperience of conducting other national health and\nnutrition surveys. Interviewers were required to follow a\ncarefully developed protocol similar to that used in the US\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys\n(NHANES)35. In addition, inter- and intra-observer\nreliability and equipment checks were conducted during\nthe training and data collection.\nMeasures and study variables\nDefinition of overweight\nBMI (weight (kg)/[height (m)]2) has been used widely in\nadults to define overweight and obesity1. Currently BMI is\nincreasingly accepted for use in children and adoles-\ncents1,36\u00ad40. We chose to use the IOTF sex\u00adage-specific\nBMI cut-offs to define child overweight, which corre-\nreference was developed on the basis of data from six\ncountries world-wide. In addition, if in 1991 a mother or\nfather's BMI was $25 kg m22, they were classified as\noverweight; if BMI was ,18.5 kg m22, they were classified\nas underweight1.\nDietary intakes\nEach child's diet was characterised by using his/her 3-day\naverage macronutrient intakes and food group consump-\ntion. Two main food groups, meats and vegetables and\nfruit (VF), were selected based on the University of North\nCarolina\u00adInstitute of Nutrition and Food Hygiene China\nFood Grouping System, which was developed by the\nauthors (Wang et al., 1998, unpublished). The Food\nGrouping System separates over 1400 foods into five major\ncategories (i.e. (1) grains, cereals and products; (2) veg-\netables and fruits; (3) animal source products; (4) cooking\noil, seasoning and other condiments; and (5) other) and\n39 food groups (e.g. the VF category was further\ndivided into seven groups including fresh vegetables,\nfresh fruits, dried vegetables, pickled vegetables, etc.).\nMeats and VF were highlighted in this study because they\nare likely to influence the energy density of an individual's\ndiet and total energy intake (TEI), and thus affect\nadiposity. Meats included red meats such as pork, beef\nand lamb, poultry, game, organ meats, fish and meat\nproducts. Note that, in general, fruit consumption in China\nis quite low, especially in rural areas29. Thus, vegetables\nwere the major component of the sample's VF\nconsumption.\nWe chose to use `relative measures' (e.g. proportion of\nTEI derived from a certain macronutrient) instead of\nabsolute measures (e.g. amount of nutrient or food intake)\nto study the effects of dietary intake on overweight over\ntime. This is because biological requirements for nutrients\nand energy keep changing with age during childhood and\nadolescence, and also vary by sex and maturation\nstatus41,42. Furthermore, increasing evidence suggests\nthat the composition of the diet affects adiposity, although\nvery few studies have found a positive relationship\nbetween TEI and obesity13.\nWe computed children's TEI as a `percentage of the\nChinese Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA)\n(%RDA)'34, along with dietary fat and carbohydrate\nintakes as `percentages of energy (%E) from each of\nthese macronutrients' (see Table 1). Moreover, because\nthe Chinese RDA for energy intake is provided only for\nage groups for children (see Appendix) and because\nbiological energy requirements vary by body size,\nchildren's TEI was also expressed as `energy/height'\nnot weight was used, because the outcome variable in\nthe present study was obesity. Consumption of meats\nand VF was measured as `grams per 1000 kcal'\n(mg kcal21). We focused on examining the structure of\nthe children's diet instead of absolute amounts of dietary\nintake. Such energy adjustment also allowed for\naddressing reporting errors and bias43. Several special\ntypes of dietary intake patterns were defined and are\npresented in Table 1.\nData analysis\nBased on children's BMI, we first examined the dynamic\nThen, we compared the differences between the over-\nweight tracking and non-tracking groups (Groups 1 and 2,\nsee below).

Relative\nrisk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) are presented.\nLogistic regression analysis could not be performed owing\nto small sample size44. For continuous variables, we\nconducted analyses of variance using General Linear\nModels to test the differences between groups, adjusted\nfor age and gender. Next, using Cochran\u00adMantel\u00ad\nHaenszel tests we studied the association between\ntracking of overweight and tracking of dietary intake\npatterns. Finally, similar analyses were performed to\ncompare the two groups' experience during the follow-up\n(i.e. changes in dietary intake and growth in height and\nweight). Note that we also considered more completely\nspecified models, which included a number of thesis\nvariables simultaneously. But we chose not do this due to:\n(1) our small sample size; and (2) some of the variables\nbeing highly correlated, e.g. the correlation coefficient (r)\nbetween baseline fat and carbohydrate intakes was 0.99;\nand r \u00bc 0:37 for BMI and weight. Furthermore, collinear-\nity was detected when the dietary intake variables were all\nincluded. A separate concern relates to the possible need\nof adjustments for multiple comparisons. These adjust-\nments were not made because they are recommended for\nclinical trials, but not for observational epidemiological\nstudies45 \u00ad49.

The ratio of growth in weight-to-height\nwas 0.9 vs. 0.2. We also compared these two groups with\nthe other two groups (those who initially were not\noverweight). The overweight tracking group had a similar\nheight growth rate to those who remained non-over-\nweight. Non-overweight children who became over-\nweight in 1993 grew slower in height but faster in\nweight than the other three groups. These suggest that\ngrowth patterns and sexual maturation may influence\nchildren's risk of remaining overweight.\nDiscussion\nStudies conducted in industrialised countries show that\napproximately one-third of obese children and one-half of\nobese adolescents remain obese as adults, but the rate\nvaries considerably between studies6,7. In general, obesity\ntracking patterns seem to be influenced by the length of\nfollow-up, definitions of obesity, initial age when obesity\ndeveloped, degree of initial obesity status, social\nenvironmental factors and genetic disposition6,7. Follow-\ning 95 overweight children in China, a society under rapid\nsocio-economic transitions, we found that only over one-\nthird of children remained overweight over a 2-year\nperiod. Our results are consistent with Mo-suwan et al.'s\nfindings in Thailand50. They reported that 12% of children\nremained overweight over a 5-year period. They defined\noverweight using the 85th percentile of BMI derived from\nthe US NHANES I data36. These findings may suggest\nconsiderable opportunities to help reverse overweight\nchildren's body weight status.\nSeveral factors may help explain the low tracking in\noverweight we observed. First, this may be due to the rapid\nchanges in socio-economic factors and people's lifestyles in\nChina over the past two decades28,30. Overweight children\nmight have changed their lifestyles considerably during the\nfollow-up as a result of the changes in their environments.\nSecond, we used the IOTF reference to define overweight,\nwhich might have underestimated the tracking proportion.\nPrevious findings from other studies and ours indicate that\napplying references based on data from wealthy\npopulations in developing countries may be problematic,\nreference as well as the WHO reference36 used by\nMo-suwan et al. in their tracking study50 may have a\nlower sensitivity for identifying overweight individuals\namong adolescents than among children in developing\ncountries51,52. Moreover, the phenomenon may also be\nrelated to the high prevalence of stunting among Chinese\nchildren at young ages54. Stunting is suggested as a risk\nfactor for childhood obesity55,56. We suspect that catch-up\ngrowth occurring at older ages, well-documented\npreviously57, may have helped reverse some children's\noverweight status. Nevertheless, our findings indicate that\nenvironmental and behavioural factors affect one's risk of\nremaining overweight.\nTable 5 Comparison of changes in dietary intake (expressed as mean (SE)) during the follow-up (1991\u00ad1993) between\nthe overweight tracking and non-tracking groups: adjusted for baseline BMI and corresponding dietary intake\nChange during the\nfollow-up\nNon-tracking group\nTracking group\nDifference\n( \u00bc `tracking' 2 `non-tracking')\nSignificance of the difference\n(P-value)\nSE \u00ad standard error; BMI \u00ad body mass index; RDA \u00ad Recommended Dietary Allowance; E \u00ad energy; CHO \u00ad carbohydrate;\nVF \u00ad vegetables and fruit.\n Least-square means (SE) were calculated based on analysis of variance of General Linear Models.

Dietary intake related to the tracking\nof overweight. Children who tracked overweight were\nmore likely to have a higher baseline fat intake but lower\ncarbohydrate intake; and were more likely to have a high-\nmeat diet, but less likely to have a high-carbohydrate or\nhigh-VF diet. Overweight children who tracked high-fat\nand high-meat diets were more likely to remain\noverweight. It is likely that the associations may be even\nstronger than what we observed if intra-individual\nvariations in dietary intake can be corrected43,58.\nAlthough energy balance in particular is the\nfundamental biological basis for the influence of diet on\nobesity, we did not observe a significant association\nbetween energy intake and tracking of overweight. There\nare several possible explanations. First, our small sample\nsize \u00f0n \u00bc 95\u00de did not provide us with adequate statistical\npower. Second, we could not adjust for children's physical\nactivity, which may be a potential confounder. Third, these\noverweight children might have changed their energy\nintake during the follow-up as indicated by our data.\nFor example, we found that both the tracking and non-\ntracking groups reduced their TEI relative to the Chinese\nRDA and their body size, but the tracking group reduced\nless than the non-tracking group. Finally, similar to many\nother studies conducted in free-living populations, we\ncould not measure children's TEI accurately, while\nmeasures of diet composition (e.g. %E from fat) may be\na better indicator of children's actual energy intake levels.\nWe think that the composition of the sample's diets will be\nmore accurate or reliable than their reported absolute\namounts of foods/nutrients consumed. Goldberg and\ncolleagues reported that the majority of previous nutri-\ntional epidemiological studies that used 24-hour recalls\nhave underestimated individuals' TEI59. Energy adjust-\nment generally reduces measurement error43.\nOur data suggest an association between fat intake and\ntracking of overweight. A number of mechanisms have\nbeen suggested to explain why higher fat intake is linked\nhigh-fat (as %E from fat) diet are likely to have higher TEI.\nSecond, excess energy from fat can readily be stored in\nbody adipose tissue depots with very high efficiency.\nFor example, about 96% of excess energy from fat but only\n60\u00ad80% from carbohydrate may be stored as body fat.\nThis also helps explain why our subjects who had higher\ncarbohydrate intakes were less likely to track overweight.\nRecently, based on clinical trials conducted between 1966\ndietary fat intake without restriction of TEI prevents\nweight gain in subjects of normal weight and produces a\nweight loss in overweight subjects.\nThe linkage between meat consumption and tracking of\noverweight is likely related to the impact of diet\ncomposition on TEI. Children who consume more meat\nare likely to have a higher TEI due to the higher energy\ndensity and fat content of their diets. Pork is the main type\nof meat consumed in China, which usually has a high fat\ncontent29. But we suggest that people should be cautious\nto recommend reducing children's meat consumption in\ndeveloping countries like China, where a large proportion\nof the population do not have adequate protein intake and\nsuffer from a range of nutrition deficiencies29,54. In these\npopulations, higher meat consumption will help the\nchildren obtain adequate amounts of the high-quality\nprotein, vitamins and minerals needed for growth and\nThe study of tracking of obesity in children and\nadolescents is complicated by their complex linear growth\npatterns. Few studies have examined the linkage between\ntracking of obesity and children's linear growth patterns.\nPreviously, De Simone et al. reported that obese subjects\nhad a less notable growth spurt during puberty than lean\nchildren61. Falorni et al.62 found that, compared with non-\nobese children, obese Italian children had a significantly\ngreater height velocity before puberty; but around the age\nof puberty, their growth spurt was reduced and more\nprecocious. As a result, obese children were shorter than\nnon-obese individuals. These obese children had partici-\npated in a weight-reduction programme. It is less clear\nwhether such findings are applicable to free-living\nchildren, but previous evidence suggests that children's\nlinear growth is not influenced by the treatment of\nobesity63. Based on longitudinal data collected for a large\nSwedish cohort of children \u00f0n \u00bc 3650\u00de; He and Karlberg\nrecently reported a positive association between BMI gain\nand height gain during childhood (2\u00ad8 years); but BMI\ngain during childhood was associated with reduced height\ngain in adolescence. However, they found no direct\ncorrelation between BMI gain in childhood and final\nWe found that, during the follow-up, the tracking group\ngrew faster in weight but slower in height than the\nnon-tracking group. The ratio of growth in weight-to-\nheight was 0.9 vs. 0.2 for the two groups.

In fact, we found that\nthe tracking group had a similar height growth rate to non-\noverweight children. Rather, it was children who were not\noverweight at baseline but became overweight who grew\nslower in height but faster in weight than all the others.\nThis suggests that the growth patterns accompanying\nsexual maturation during late childhood and adolescence\nmay influence children's risk of having different over-\nweight outcomes, although causality cannot be proved\nwith our data. A large body of literature shows that sexual\nmaturation is related to obesity65\u00ad 70. The complex causal\nrelationship between maturation and fatness is yet to be\nunravelled but clearly merits further examination.\nThe present study has several limitations. First, data on\nphysical activity were not collected and, as a result, we\nwere unable to examine how physical activity may\ninfluence tracking of overweight. Second, only 95 children\nwere overweight at baseline and could be studied. The\nsmall sample size limits our statistical power to detect\nsome significant results. For example, our sample size\nallows for detecting a significant difference of\nin VF consumption between the tracking and non-tracking\ngroups, while the observed differences were 5.0 and\nthe IOTF reference to classify overweight might have\ncaused some misclassifications. Finally, we could not\nexamine how genetic factors might influence tracking of\noverweight. It will be of interest to understand the role\nplayed by the interaction between genetics and environ-\nIn conclusion, despite considerable changes in\nchildren's overweight status during childhood and adoles-\ncence and equally remarkable shifts in diet and socio-\neconomic factors, the dietary intake patterns of Chinese\nchildren appear to influence the dynamics of childhood\noverweight. Further studies based on larger samples and\nlonger follow-up periods are needed before being able to\nextrapolate from our findings to the broader context.\n"
