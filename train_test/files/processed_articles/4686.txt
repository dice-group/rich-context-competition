Individuals with mental illness are experiencing human rights violations on a global scale\nboth within and outside of psychiatric institutions. These violations include denial of employment, marriage, procreation,\nand education; malnutrition; physical abuse; and negligence. This information was reviewed and compiled into the following\narticle, along with interpretations of current implications and suggestions for future research. It is evident that more\nsupports need to be instilled, especially within the context of low- and middle-income countries lacking adequate staffing\nand accessible services. Furthermore, legislation needs to be modified, updated, or created with relevant systems in place\nto make these laws enforceable.\nKeywords\npsychiatry, behavioral sciences, rights, criminology, social sciences, sociology of health and illness, sociology, sociology of\nmental health, social work\nIntroduction\nIt is estimated that approximately 500 million individuals\nglobally are affected by mental illness (International Labour\nOrganisation, 2000). The World Health Organization\n(WHO; 2012) speculates that depression alone will rank\nsecond highest in the global burden of disease by 2020. In\nCanada, it is believed that mental illness will affect\napproximately 20% of the population in their lifetime\n(Regehr & Glancy, 2010). According to recent figures, the\ndirect and indirect economic cost of mental illness is\nestimated to range from 48 to 50 billion dollars (Lim,\nJacobs, Ohinwaa, Schopflower, & Dewa, 2008). This\nsignificant expense is not expected to decrease, but rather\nincrease over time and moreover affect the labor force\nwhile straining the world economy (International Labour\nOrganisation, 2000). Given the inherent vulnerability of\nthose with mental health issues and the stigma of being a\nburden on society, it is essential that human rights are\nacknowledged for this population and also that human\nrights violations are globally recognized and curtailed.\nReports show that individuals with mental health issues are\nmaltreated and marginalized due to the nature of their\nillness. This trend is attributed to a number of factors\nincluding culture, ethnicity, religion, language, and poverty.\nAlthough there are ongoing discourses over the\ntreatment of individuals diagnosed with mental illness and\nthose exhibiting mental health symptoms around the world,\nit is important to note that the severity of abuse varies from\none culture to another based on inherent beliefs. For\ninstance, just as in certain cultures, women are not accorded\nequal rights and are relegated to the background, some\ncultures perceive the mentally ill as not being part of\nnormal society; therefore, those with mental illness are\nsubjected to varying forms of abuse. The maltreatment and\nabuse of the mentally ill have been widely captured in\nThe focus of this study was to explore the literature on\nhow mental health issues affect the rights of individuals\nwith mental illness. The rationale for this literature review\nis to examine globally the human rights abuses of mental\nhealth issues and shed light on its impact on economies\nworldwide. Furthermore, this review intends to explore\n1Lyle S.

It encompasses ones quality of\nlife and general well-being. Culture, language, ethnicity, and\nreligion play a significant role in the interpretation of mental\nhealth causes. Studies show that being diagnosed with or\nexhibiting symptoms of mental health issues exposes a person\nor community to labeling. Such people are branded as socially\ninadequate and are associated with resulting shame,\nhumiliation, and loss of face. In most cultures, groups with low\npositions in hierarchical social structure experience high rates\nof mental health problems (Rosenfield, 2012). In modern\nsociety, connection with mental illness exposes a person to\nlevels of medicalization and marginalization.\nIn certain cultures, mental illness is perceived as a sign\nof weakness or curse. This negative connotation results in\nfamily members distancing themselves from or maltreating\nthose who are ill. Furthermore, those with mental illness are\ndeemed unproductive and perceived as not contributing to\nthe upkeep of the family. It is also argued that the lack of\nresources in African countries as well as in other\ndeveloping countries makes it difficult for governments to\nenhance the treatment or improve the conditions of the\nmentally ill, which inevitably exposes many to abuses.\nOver the years, research has shown that stigma plays a\nsignificantly debilitating role in the treatment of the\nmentally ill (Barke, Nyarko, & Klecha, 2011; Link et al.,\n2001). The literature on stigma describes how individuals\nwith disabilities, including mental illness, often find\nthemselves on the periphery of society. This circumstance is\ndeemed \"an attribute that is deeply discrediting\" (Goffman,\n1963, p. 3). Such individuals are marginalized, mistreated,\nand often stigmatized in society. Individuals with mental\nillness are often viewed as \"strangers\" where this\ncharacteristic of \"strangeness\" frequently results in social\ndistancing (Baumann, 2007). Unfortunately, as this\ntreatment is prevalent in both the industrial and developing\ncountries, the argument could be made that governments are\nfailing to put in place measures or systems to enhance the\ntreatment of the mentally ill. Thus, very limited progress\nhas been made to improve the lot of the mentally ill who are\nostracized in society.\nMethod\nThe intent of the study was to review the global literature on\nthe subject and examine how different cultures respond to this\ntopic. The search criteria included papers on the treatment of\nthe mentally ill in various countries throughout the world. The\nmajor databases used to identify the articles were PubMed,\nPubMed Central Canada, SAGE Journals, African Journals\nOnline, Scholars Portal, EBSCOHost, ProQuest, PsycINFO,\nand Google Scholar. The WHO database was also examined\nfor the purpose of this venture. Only papers published in\nEnglish were allowed for consideration in this review. The\nreview examined peer-reviewed published articles, policy\npapers, as well as government publications since 2000.\nKeywords or statements of combinations of these terms were\nincluded in the search along with librarian assistance.\nKeywords (and a combination of these words) included mental\nhealth*, mental illness*, rights, human rights*, psychiatry*,\nhuman rights violations and mental illness, colonial psychiatry,\nand deprivation of liberty. This method yielded numerous\narticles related to mental illness and human rights.\nIn the process of searching the literature, keywords (rather\nthan titles and abstracts) were used to examine the documents\nfor matches. All of the references were recorded and stored\nelectronically using refworks. Tracking was conducted after\nreading the papers and bibliographies were reviewed for\nfurther documents. The criteria for inclusion included both\nqualitative and quantitative articles on human rights and\nmental illness. For the purpose of this study, literature reviews\nand meta-analyses were not included. In the event that the\nsame data were reported by two different papers, only the first\nreport has been included. Papers published in peer-reviewed\njournals and gray literature were included.\nGiven this study's objective on mental health and human\nrights violations, certain articles were excluded from\nreview, in cases where it was determined that the study,\narticle topic, or demographic lay outside of the purview of\nthis article. Information was recorded down in the form of\nnotes, entered into a literature table (see Appendix), and\ncategorized by themes which are represented in the\nfollowing \"Results\" section.\nIn total, approximately 1,000 articles, book chapters, and\ndissertations were found. Of these, 200 papers were reviewed\nbecause they either focused or had some discussions on mental\nhealth and human rights abuses. Articles were excluded for\nnumerous reasons including the following: reported the same\ndata as other papers, did not explore issues being looked at,\nliterature reviews and meta-analysis. Nevertheless, the most\nsignificant were those that focused on mental health and\nhuman rights or articles that reflected research conducted\ninternationally. Of the resulting articles, book chapters, and\ntheses elicited from the search, 37 articles were deemed\nappropriate and utilized for the purpose of adequately\naddressing human rights and mental illness. Thus, from the\n200 papers reviewed, a preliminary review narrowed the\nfindings to 37 articles and government publications\u00ad\u00ad31\narticles and 6 government documents. Articles that did not\nspecifically focus on human rights and mental illness were\nexcluded. Theses and book chapters that did not directly\naddress the issues of human rights and mental illness were\nexcluded as well.\nMfoafo-M'Carthy and Huls 3\nResults\nIlliteracy and Mental Health\nThe findings emphasized the importance of taking note of\nthe co-morbidity of illiteracy and mental illness. This has\nbeen linked to an increased likelihood of experiencing\nhuman rights violations, as illiteracy can adversely affect\nthe ability to reach out for formal supports. In India,\nilliteracy has a greater influence on women than men,\nwhere despite free education, women are less likely to be\nencouraged to attend school (Vijayalakshmi, Ramachandra,\nStigmatization may also play a role in the educational\nopportunities for those with mental health issues as\nreflected by the high incidence of dropouts. Students with\nmental illness can face teasing, harassment, and prejudice\nfrom their peers, and arguably, their teachers (WHO, 2010).\nDevelopment Programs and Mental Health\nDespite the creation of development programs intended to\nimprove the lives of the world's most vulnerable\npopulations, such programs exclude, often intentionally, the\nmentally ill as part of their recipients. A striking example is\nthe Bangladesh Vulnerable Group Development Program,\nwhich stipulates that service users needed to be \"mentally\nand physically sound\" to access the program (WHO, 2010,\np. 3). UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon clarifies the\nimplications of this exclusion:\nThe rate of mental disorders and the need for care is highest\namong disadvantaged people\u00ad\u00adyet these are precisely the\ngroups with the lowest access to appropriate services. At the\nsame time, fear of stigma leads many to avoid seeking care.\nThe consequences are enormous in terms of disability, human\nsuffering and economic loss. We have a pressing obligation to\nscale up care and services for mental disorders, especially\namong the disadvantaged, while stepping up efforts to protect\nthe human rights of those affected. (WHO, 2010, p. 7)\nThis inequality even extends to emergency and disaster\nsituations. After Hurricane Katrina in the United States,\nFederal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)\nallegedly discriminated against those with mental health\nissues based on the belief that these individuals were\nFurthermore, the unemployment rate for mentally ill\nindividuals is approximately 70% to 90%; yet, development\nprograms that create job opportunities often omit these\nindividuals in their planning and enactment of projects\nPrison Settings and Mental Health Court\nIn fact, individuals with mental illness who are receiving\ncare in psychiatric institutions suffer greater human rights\nviolations than individuals who are in correctional facilities.\nWhile those in psychiatric care may not have committed a\ncrime, they are subjected to a similar removal of rights and\nliberties as with a criminal offender. Comparable with their\ncriminal counterparts, individuals with mental illness are\nperceived as \"more dangerous [and] less competent\"; two\nqualities that are not welcome within general society\nAn additional area of concern regards individuals\ndetermined to be not criminally responsible and therefore\ndetained either in the psychiatric section within a prison or\nin a designated wing within a hospital setting. According to\nFellner (2006), the majority of incarcerated individuals in\nthe United States of America are struggling with mental\nhealth issues:\nIndeed, one of the primary roles of prisons in the United States\ntoday is to house the mentally ill. Prisoners have rates of\nmental illness that are two to four times greater than the rates\nof members of the general public. (p. 1)\nHousing of the mentally ill in prisons can be partially\nattributed to the lack of community-based services that\nwere to be developed as a result of hospital closures\nRegardless of the environment, the intent is to provide\npsychiatric treatment to accommodate the unique needs of\nthe prison population. However, issues arise, such as the\ncohabitation of varying degrees of mental health severities,\nlack of appropriate professional training for staff members\n(Naudts et al., 2005), disciplining individuals instead of\nproviding psychiatric support, verbal abuse and neglect\nfrom staff, and the exacerbation of mental illness due to\nconfinement (Fellner, 2006). As symptoms of mental illness\nmay be viewed by untrained prison staff as behavioral\nissues, these prisoners can build lengthy disciplinary\nrecords, which could potentially negatively affect their\nrelease time (Fellner, 2006; Matejkowski, Caplan, &\nCullen, 2010). Reintegration into society and the\nopportunity for parole are often contingent upon program\nparticipation; yet, these classes infrequently consider the\nadditional support that individuals with mental illness may\nrequire. In addition, programs may not address certain life\nskills that are unique to those with mental illness such as\ncompliance with medication (Matejkowski et al., 2010).\nSzasz (as cited in Breeding, 2006) suggests that those\nwith mental illness who have been involuntarily admitted\nmay be treated worse than their criminal counterparts:\nA prisoner will be released after he completes his sentence, and\npossibly before. A mental patient may be required to undergo a\nchange in his \"inner personality\"--a change that may be\ninduced by measures far more intrusive than anything\npermitted in a jail--before the psychiatric authorities let him\ngo. And they may never let him go. Commitment, unlike a\nsentence, is for an indefinite period. (p. 252)\n4 SAGE Open\nBreeding (2006) further highlights the contradiction of\njustice: Individuals in mental health court are guilty until\nproven innocent. The added danger is that an individual's\nrefutation of a diagnosis can be interpreted as a symptom of\ntheir mental illness.\nPhysical Health and Mental Health\nThe gap in service provision for those with mental illness\ntransfers into the health care system as well. Those with\nmental illness are at a higher risk of acquiring considerable\nphysical health problems, which potentially shortens their\nlifespan (WHO, 2010). Human rights violations occur\nfrequently within health care settings, if these services are\navailable to those with mental health issues at all (P. Hunt\n& Mesquita, 2006). An example of this neglect can be\nfound in a shelter in Indonesia that houses individuals with\nmental illness. During a 7-month time period, 181 of the\n644 individuals died of diarrhea or lack of nourishment\nTarantola (2007) points out a cyclical relationship\nbetween physical and mental health. Those who experience\nhuman rights violations are at an increased risk of\nexperiencing physical health concerns. Poor health, in turn,\nincreases individuals' susceptibility to human rights\nDecision-Making Ability and Mental Illness\nCallaghan and Ryan (2012) review the practices of\ncompulsory treatment in Australia and stated that this form\nof treatment should only concern individuals who are\nunable to make independent decisions. While this could\nequally result in a human rights violation, the authors\nsuggest the following criteria for an individual who is able\nto make decisions: ability to comprehend, recall, repeat, and\nutilize the information presented to them (Boyle, 2011;\nHuman Rights emphasized that temporarily detaining an\nindividual who does not offer consent, nor has the capacity\nto do so, could be considered a deprivation of liberty. In\nresponse, the Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards was\nimplemented to ensure the rights of individuals in this\nSocial/Cultural Stigmatization of Mental Illness\nWhile medical conditions typically have tests, lists of\nsymptoms, and clear treatment methods, mental illness are\nnot as \"tangible\" and can therefore be viewed as less\ncredible, which only furthers stigmatization (Loo, Trollor,\nunderstanding of mental illness conducted through a\nbiomedical lens rather than from the perspective of \"social\njustice, quality of life, human rights and human security\"\nof applying Western standards and mental health techniques\nin countries where there are alternative understanding of\nmental illness, descriptive language, and treatment\ntechniques. Some countries continue to rely on traditional\nand/or faith healers, family, and community to remedy their\nmental health issues (Giacaman et al., 2011; Vijayalakshmi\ninsistence that medication is more effective than counseling\nin low-income countries may be influenced by underlying\ntones of colonialism or even as a means to create further\nprofit for the pharmaceutical industry.\nFurther to not knowing their rights, individuals with\nmental health concerns are often stigmatized by societal and\ncultural views. From \"not . . . a human being at all\" to being\nseen as \"facing punishment for their past actions,\"\nindividuals struggle to find support within their community,\nnot to mention on a higher systemic level (Drew et al.,\nexacerbated with the viewpoint that the cause of mental\nillness is internal and not something that can be addressed\nfrom a social or systemic shift (Kogstad, 2009). In India,\nthe principle of karma can impede those with mental illness\nfrom reaching out for support due to its implied culpability\n(Vijayalakshmi et al., 2013). Society also stereotypes those\nwith mental illness as feeble, aggressive, of lower\nintelligence, or even victim to paranormal influences\nAs evident throughout this review, it is important to\nconsider culture when studying the types of treatments\noffered in different communities. For example, out of the\n25 nations reviewed by the World Health Organization's\nAssessment Instrument for Mental Health Systems\n(WHO-AIMS), Korea ranked third in terms of\ninvoluntary admissions to hospital. This has created\nconcern regarding forcible admission; however, it is\nsuggested that these numbers must be viewed through a\ncultural lens. Bola, Park, and Kim (2011) indicate that\nthese numbers can be attributed to the fact that stigma\nprevents individuals from voluntarily accessing\ntreatment; also, these services may not be adequately\nsupported financially for individuals.\nAddressing Stigma\nGiven the scope of individuals who are affected and how\nthis relates to national levels of success and accountability,\nimplementing education and awareness programs is\nessential to decreasing stigmatization (Mwanza et al.,\n2011). However, it should also be noted that stigmatization\nis a primary cause of human rights violations and that\nlabeling individuals can in fact cause further harm to this\npopulation. This gap seems to have been addressed on a\ngrassroots level by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs)\nand community efforts through support groups and\nimplementation of traditional healing practices (Dhanda &\nMfoafo-M'Carthy and Huls 5\nThe concept of spreading awareness is imperative to\nnormalizing a stigmatized population, as lack of\ninfrastructure and monitoring in psychiatric institutions\nleaves the public unaware of the aforementioned human\nrights violations (P. Hunt & Mesquita, 2006). However, the\nnotion of education surrounding mental health standards\nfaces a financial barrier, as this agenda is much more\naccessible to countries that are recognized as high income.\nThrough their research, Drew et al. (2011) identify that the\nmajority of low-income and middle-income countries were\nnot adequately equipped to support those needing to access\nmental health services.\nViolations\nViolations of individuals diagnosed with mental health\ndisorders vary from one culture/country to another. These\nviolations may be dependent on the cultures of the country\nin question or the resources available to those countries. For\ninstance, more resources are allotted to the treatment of\nmental illness in high-income countries than in low-income\ncountries. In high-income countries, it is ensured that\ntrained professionals are available to treat individuals\ndiagnosed with mental illness. To be specific, the income\nlevel of the world based on its Gross Domestic Product\n(GDP) is divided in categories. According to the World\nBank, economies are measured by their gross national\nincome (GNI). According to the 2011 GNI, a lower income\ncountry was considered USD $1,025 or less; a lower\nincome country was $12,476 or more (World Bank Data,\n2013). High-income countries are often developed\ncountries; middle-income countries as well as some\ndeveloping countries contain emerging markets; and low-\nincome countries mostly consist of developing countries.\nThe violation and stigmatization of individuals\ndiagnosed with mental illness include discrimination\nsurrounding employment, marriage, parenting, and family\nplanning; access to health services; sexual violence; access\nto housing; entitlement to vote; and access to basic\nWHO, 2010). While it may be presumed that these\nviolations are specific to underdeveloped countries, the\ninability to marry exists in Bulgaria, Russia, Thailand, and\nIndia. In Switzerland, though known for its neutrality,\napplications of nationality can be declined if an individual\nstruggles with intellectual disabilities. In addition, only\nCanada, Ireland, Italy, and Sweden (out of 63 countries\nassessed) do not place legal limitations on voting for\nindividuals with mental illness (WHO, 2010).\nThe violation of the mentally ill has been reported as\noccurring in a variety of settings ranging from home life to\nschools, prisons, work environments, and social services\n(Drew et al., 2011). The traits of the mental health care\nsystem are regularly identified as inadequate and\nemotionally or physically abusive (Cooper, Ssebunnya,\nKigozi, Lund, & Flisher, 2010). Individuals are often\ninstitutionalized for long periods of time without\nappropriate cause and are then subjected to conditions that\ninclude violence, substandard nutrition and cleanliness,\ntorment, unconsented treatment as extensive as\nelectroconvulsive therapy (ECT; P. Hunt & Mesquita,\ncontrol method (Mayers, Keet, Winkler, & Flisher, 2010).\nViolations in Zambia have included denial of food,\nrestriction of movement, poverty due to cost of treatment,\nand being brought to hospital in chains or in the company of\narmed officials (Mwanza et al., 2011). Treatment can also\nfail to involve basic social communication, as some believe\nthat this would not be helpful to an individual with mental\nWhile the Cochrane Review highlights the lack of\nempirical evidence for the effectiveness of isolation and use\nof restraint, these practices, along with sedation, are\nfrequently implemented within institutions. The review also\nreferences that within the literature, certain qualitative\nstudies have in fact pointed to negative outcomes. Another\nconcern that is equal to the use of possibly nonbeneficial\npractices is the intent behind the use, as sedation can be\nimplemented for purposes of control rather than as a means\nof support for the individual (Mayers et al., 2010).\nFurther violations can be witnessed in a number of\ndifferent countries. As described by Yamin and Rosenthal\nin a space that was built for 50 individuals and were not\nprovided with treatment. In Hungary, individuals were\nadministered obsolete medication and kept in beds that\nwere caged, thereby limiting their movement. In Turkey,\nPeru, and Bulgaria, institutions engage in the dangerous\npractice of unmodified ECT, which does not utilize\nanesthesia.\nCertain countries perpetuate human rights violations\ndue to the lack of appropriate and accessible staffing.\nLess than 50% of hospitals in Bangalore, India, have\npsychologists available to their patients. Some of these\nviolations occur due to a long-standing history of\ncultural or faith-based practice regarding treatment of the\nmentally ill (WHO, 2010). For example, in Somalia, an\nindividual may be placed in a hollow with hyenas. The\nintent is to scare the \"dijinns, or evil spirits\" from the\nperson, and therefore the symptoms of mental illness\npractices can involve restriction of movement through\nchains or attempts to remove spirits by whipping the\nmentally ill person (Doku et al., 2011).\nThese violations extend to accessing of justice, civil,\nand political rights. In England and Wales, a report by\nMind discovered that 60% of individuals with mental\nillness who approached police regarding a crime felt that\nthe authorities did not treat the report with severity. In\ncertain instances, reports are not documented due to the\n6 SAGE Open\nbelief that individuals with mental illness are unreliable\nWithin the population of individuals with mental\ndisorders, there are subgroups who are at an increased risk\nof violation. For example, those of varying ethnicities and\nrace are more likely to experience prejudice and women are\nmore likely to be sexually abused and even sterilized\nwithout consent (P. Hunt & Mesquita, 2006). Kastrup\n(2011) notes the disparity between mental health support\nfor those within marginalized populations, as well as the\nlack of human rights fulfillment.\nIn 1993, the slogan \"Human Rights Are Women's\nRights\" became a prominent message. During the World\nConference on Human Rights in Vienna (Jansen, 2006), it\nwas agreed that violence against women was considered a\nhuman rights issue. This practice is most notably seen\nduring times of war, when sexual violence against women\ncan increase and be used as a tool of war. This violence can\nlead to fear or mental health issues that deter women from\nbeing active community members, which further\nexacerbates the issue of human rights (Jansen, 2006).\nViolations can also be seen within the very institutions that\nare meant to support women with mental health issues, such\nas in Kosovo, where incidents were reported in which\nwomen were raped in psychiatric institutions while the\nviolence was witnessed by staff and humanitarian workers\nLegislation\nDespite the issues of mental health violations documented\nin the literature, it has also been observed that significant\nlegislations are documented pertaining to the treatment of\nindividuals with disability including those with mental\ndisorders. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights\n(UDHR) encompasses 30 articles; however, no articles\nidentify the need for rights around mental health concerns,\nand only one article (Article 25) alludes to the importance\nof social service access (The United Nations, n.d.). Instead,\ninformation about mental health can be found in the United\nNations Convention on the Rights of Persons with\nDisabilities. As defined here, disabilities include \"long term\n. . . mental . . . impairments . . . which in interaction with\nvarious barriers may hinder their full and effective\nparticipation in society on an equal basis with others\" (The\nTo ensure that human rights are honored in relation to\nmental health, WHO developed the Mental Health and\nHuman Rights Project, which focuses on mental health\nlegislation within a global context (WHO, 2006). This project\nwas supplementary to the United Nations Principles for the\nProtection of Persons With Mental Illness and the\nImprovement of Mental Health Care, which was established\nin 1991 and created a minimum level of human rights\nrequired in mental health practice (WHO, 2005). However,\nthe principles (known as the Mental Illness [MI] Principles)\nhave been critiqued as being ineffective and contrary to the\nUDHR. It is noted that the MI Principles are not legally\nbinding and fail to institute any form of international\nsupervision (Weissbecker, 2009). The UN Secretary-General\nstated that they \"offer in some cases a lesser degree of\nprotection than that offered by existing human rights treaties,\nfor example, with regard to the requirement for prior\nand Mesquita (2006) indicate that \"several international\nhuman rights instruments allow for exceptional\ncircumstances in which persons with psychiatric disabilities\ncan be involuntarily admitted to a hospital or other\ndesignated institution\" (p. 344). However, such vague terms\nprotect the regular occurrence of human rights violations\n(Kogstad, 2009). The case of Harry v. Mental Health Review\nBoard in Australia illustrates an example of improper use of\nmental health law to alleviate embarrassment from family or\ncommunities (Freckelton & McGregor, 2010).\nThese statements call into question the voice of the service\nuser and whether human rights in regard to mental health are\nindeed being honored. This concern is exacerbated by the\nfact that individual countries are able to enact their own\nregulations, definitions of mental health disorders, and\nprinciples. As a result, more than 40% of countries lack a\nmental health policy and more than 30% of countries lack a\nmental health program (P. Hunt & Mesquita, 2006). In some\ncountries such as Zambia, policies exist but are antiquated,\noffensive, and based on colonial eras (Mwanza et al., 2011).\nThe lack of legislation can also be attributed to the use of\ntraditional and faith-based practices, which often go\nIn addition, legislation may be put in place to manipulate\nsocial participation. According to WHO (2005), \"In many\ncountries a diagnosis of personality disorder has been used\nagainst vulnerable groups, especially young women,\nwhenever they do not conform with the dominant social,\ncultural, moral and religious standards\" (p. 21). This\nmethod of mental health diagnoses is also used for political\npurposes to attribute personality disorders to those who may\nbe viewed as a nonconformist (WHO, 2005). In addition, in\nIndia, women viewed as oppositional can be branded as\ninsane (Davar, 2008). To create uniformity among the\nconcept of mental health, Tarantola (2007) suggests a more\nholistic understanding, which would include emotional,\nsocial, and cultural influence and welfare.\nWhile the intention of establishing universal guidelines\nsuch as UDHR, UNCRPD (UN Convention on the Rights\nof Persons with Disabilities), and MI Principles is important\nfor those within the government and legislative context, this\ndoes little to provide information to those who are directly\naffected. A survey participant from Jordan stated that \"the\nmost important right is my right to have the knowledge of\nall of my rights and to be empowered to [confront]\nThis right to knowledge relies heavily, however, on the\nassumption that the legislation in fact supports those with\nMfoafo-M'Carthy and Huls 7\nmental health issues. Uganda's mental health system is an\nexample of a legislation that is in accordance with\ninternational policy; yet, it is criticized for its perpetuation\nof stigmatization and violation of human rights for those\nwith mental health concerns (Cooper et al., 2010). These\nguidelines additionally rely heavily on agreement,\ncommitment, compliance, and mutual understanding of the\nissues of mental health and human rights.\nDiscussion\nHuman rights violations not only affect the physical,\npsychological, emotional, and spiritual well-being of\nservice and nonservice recipients with mental disorders but\nalso significantly influence potential service recipients'\naccess to mental health services, thereby creating a dynamic\nwhere not receiving any form of treatment or support may\nbecome more desirable (Loo et al., 2010).\nFurthermore, culture, religion, and traditional practices\nplay a role regarding which type of mental health treatment\nis sought out by individuals. Some individuals do not\nbelieve that mental illness exists or that only the physical\nsymptoms need to be addressed (McDaid, Knapp, & Raja,\n2008). This view can be partially attributed to lack of\nprofessional and public knowledge, resulting in the\nstigmatization of this population.\nAbsence of resources may be symptomatic of an\noverlying cause of lower socioeconomic status. While\ndedication to mental health and humane treatment of these\nindividuals is a noble cause, this may not be feasible in\ncertain countries. Ethiopia is home to 77 million people but\nonly 18 psychiatrists, who are all employed in one hospital,\nlocated in the capital city (Alem, Jacobson, & Hanlon,\n2008). Even if legislation were put into place, what would\nbe enforced in the rural areas where individuals are not\nreceiving formal care? Bruckner et al. (2011) estimate that\nmiddle-income countries just to have adequate staffing. A\nproposed solution is to increase staff presence and\nemphasize community-based care, which would increase\naccess and honor the human rights of individuals.\nAccording to Yamin and Rosenthal (2005),\nFrom a human rights perspective, people are entitled to live in\nand receive care in the community not because it is more\nefficient, but because all human beings develop their identities\nwithin social contexts, and have rights to work and study, as\nwell as be with friends and family. (p. 297)\nResearch into why human rights violations occur may be\nbeneficial in creating a comprehensive plan to better ensure\nhuman rights of those with mental health issues. A\npsychiatrist in Ghana presents the following dilemma:\n. . . people are trying to do their best to help people with\nmental illness, but when there is inadequacy and all those\nthings set in, we don't intentionally try to violate people's\nrights. But when you keep someone in the mental hospital and\nyou can't provide for the person, you then of course, you are\nFurthermore, it is evident that legislation needs to be\ncreated which honors human rights, as there is a clear\ndisparity between experiences of those with mental health\nconcerns and the intent of human rights (Kogstad, 2009).\nHowever, it is also clear that these movements be\nconsidered within the contextual framework of culture and\nreligion. P. Hunt and Mesquita (2006) suggest that\nlegislation should consider the following when making\ndecisions surrounding human rights and mental health:\n\"participation, autonomy, dignity, inclusion, monitoring,\nand accountability\" (p. 332). In response to this need for\nindividual voice, the International Diploma on Mental\nHealth Law was conceived, it comprised of an\ninterdisciplinary team including service users and aiming to\nprovide education, awareness, and reform on a country-\nwide basis (Drew et al., 2011). The Mental Health and\nPoverty Project (MHaPP) is an initiative focusing on the\ncyclical nature of poverty and mental health in Ghana,\nZambia, South Africa, and Uganda (Mwanza et al., 2011).\nWhile more integrated, this initiative solely focuses on\nAfrican countries, which possibly negates the presence of\nhuman rights violations in more \"developed\" countries and\ncreates further stigmatization for a continent that is already\nbranded by poor global opinion.\nClearly, the prevalent issue of human rights violations in\nthe context of mental health can no longer be ignored.\nHowever, given the additional factors and barriers of\nincome status, accessibility, culture, religion, and traditional\npractices, it will be a challenge to create an understanding\nand enforcement of universal human rights. To completely\ndismiss cultural tradition would only contradict another set\nof human rights, thereby exchanging one form of violation\nfor another. Thus, discussion is necessary regarding how\none can balance the rights of traditional or faith-based\npractice with the UN's view of human rights.\nThis therefore creates the need for both advocates and\nresearchers to continue challenging and embarking on\nstudies that will improve the lot of the mentally ill. For\nprogress to enhance mental health treatment in numerous\ncountries, serious intervention and engagement from\ngovernmental bodies are necessary.\nDespite these arguments, one should not lose sight of the\nfact that programs have been introduced in the Western\nworld to improve the treatment of the mentally ill. For\nexample, the work of Winick and others on therapeutic\njurisprudence has been designed to shift the treatment of the\nmentally ill from the medical model to a more collaborative\napproach. This shift in direction commenced in the 1980s as\nan interdisciplinary scholarly approach to enhance the\nthen, a number of interventions have been introduced in the\ntreatment of the seriously mentally ill in the Western world,\n8 SAGE Open\nincluding Community Treatment Orders (CTOs) or\nMandated Outpatient Treatment which legally compels\nindividuals diagnosed with mental illness to follow through\nwith a proposed treatment or else risk being hospitalized\n(A. M. Hunt, da Silva, Lurie, & Goldbloom, 2007; Kisely,\nCampbell, Scott, Preston, & Xiao, 2007; Mfoafo-M'Carthy\nIn addition, it should be noted that the study adds to the\nliterature on issues of human rights abuses of the mentally\nill and contributes to the discourse. Also, it continues to\nbring attention to the stigmatization of the mentally ill and\nthe need for more education and understanding of the needs\nof this marginalized community.\nLimitation\nThis review may not be considered exhaustive due to the\nfact that the literature reviewed were only English language\narticles, this eliminates the cross-cultural perception of the\nstudy as articles in other languages were excluded. Also, all\nthe articles reviewed focused solely on Westernized\nperception or definition of mental illness, which does not\nenhance the diversity of the discourse.\nConclusion\nBased on the findings of this review, the literature clearly\narticulates the importance of creating a system that will\ncurtail the marginalization and stigmatization of individuals\ndiagnosed with mental disorders. The review identified\nlegislations intended to limit the human rights violations of\nindividuals with mental health issues, yet not much has\nbeen achieved. Even in the Western world, programs\nincluding the work of Winick on therapeutic jurisprudence\nand other treatment options such as CTOs aimed at\nenhancing treatment to limit mental health violations have\nnot made a significant impact. A major factor to improving\nthe conditions of the marginalized is to curb violations\nagainst the mentally ill through meaningful engagement and\npolitical will on the part of governments. The observation is\nthat, despite laws governing the treatment of those with\nmental health issues, much has not been done to address\nstigmatization of individuals diagnosed with serious mental\nillness. In developing countries and other parts of the world,\nfamily members with mental health issues continue to be\nmarginalized, medicalized, and ostracized, hence exposing\nthem to human right abuses.\nAppendix\nSummary Table for Literature Review\nAuthor Article Type of Publication Key points Findings\nAlem, Jacobson, and\nCommunity-based mental\nhealth care in Africa:\nMental health workers'\nviews\n\u00b7 Shift from hospital-based\ncare to community-based\ncare in West\n\u00b7 This strategy is less easily\nimplemented in low-income\ncountries in Africa due to\nshortage of mental health\nprofessionals with adequate\ntraining, lack of social service,\nrole of traditional and faith\nhealers\nBola, Park, and Kim\nReassessing the High\nProportion of Involuntary\nPsychiatric Hospital\nAdmission in South Korea\nStudy--\nComparison,\nestimation, data\nanalysis\n\u00b7 Article addresses the\nconcern around the large\nnumber of involuntary\nhospital admission in South\nKorea; the statistics have\ncaused concern that it is \"an\nexcessively coercive system\"\n\u00b7 Article suggests that involuntary\nadmission needs to be\nconsidered within the cultural\ncontext of a collectivist society\nBoyle (2011) Early Implementation of the\nin Health and Social Care\nJournal article \u00b7 Reviews Mental Capacity\ncapacity, who makes\ndecisions, criteria for\ncapacity\n\u00b7 The Act states that those\nindividuals who do not have the\nability to make decisions be given\nsupport to do so.
