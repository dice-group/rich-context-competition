The objective of this\nstudy was to assess sociodemographic characteristics and selected, common smoking-related diseases as\npredictors of invalid reporting of non-smoking. Valid self-reported smoking may be related to the degree\nto which smoking is a behavior that is not tolerated by the smoker's social group.\nMethods: True smoking was defined as having serum cotinine of 15+ng/ml. 1483 \"true\" smokers 45+\nyears of age with self-reported smoking and serum cotinine data from the Mobile Examination Center\nwere identified in the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Invalid non-smoking was\ndefined as \"true\" smokers self-reporting non-smoking. To assess predictors of invalid self-reported non-\nsmoking, odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for age, race/ethnicity-gender\ncategories, education, income, diabetes, hypertension, and myocardial infarction. Multiple logistic\nregression modeling took into account the complex survey design and sample weights.\nResults: Among smokers with diabetes, invalid non-smoking status was 15%, ranging from 0% for\nMexican-American (MA) males to 22%\u00ad25% for Non-Hispanic White (NHW) males and Non-Hispanic\nBlack (NHB) females. Among smokers without diabetes, invalid non-smoking status was 5%, ranging from\n3% for MA females to 10% for NHB females. After simultaneously taking into account diabetes, education,\nrace/ethnicity and gender, smokers with diabetes (ORAdj\nfrom high school (ORAdj\n1.41\u00ad18.58) were more likely to self-report as non-smokers than smokers without diabetes, who were\nhigh school graduates, and MA females, respectively. Having a history of myocardial infarction or\nhypertension did not predict invalid reporting of non-smoking.\nConclusion: Validity of self-reported non-smoking may be related to the relatively slowly progressing\nchronic nature of diabetes, in contrast with the acute event of myocardial infarction which could be\nconsidered a more serious, major life changing event. These data also raise questions regarding the\npossible role of societal desirability in the validity of self-reported non-smoking, especially among smokers\nwith diabetes, who did not graduate from high school, and who were NHB females.\n\u00a9 2007 Fisher et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.\nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0),\nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBackground\nSmoking is a major risk factor for many diseases [1],\nincluding highly prevalent conditions such as heart dis-\nhypertension [15,16]. According to the Standards of Med-\nical Care in Diabetes, hypertension is a common comor-\nbidity of diabetes, \"In these patients, other cardiovascular risk\nfactors including obesity, hyperlidemia, smoking ... should be\ncarefully assessed and treated.\" [17]. These standards of care\nsupport smoking cessation counseling as a necessary com-\nponent of comprehensive approaches to manage patients\nwith diabetes because smoking is related to macrovascular\nand microvascular complications of diabetes [17]. How-\never, neither health care providers nor individuals with\ndiabetes are sufficiently aware of the increased risk of\ndeveloping cardiovascular disease for smokers with diabe-\ntes [18,19]. Preventive care to reduce the risk of future car-\ndiac events includes interventions targeting type 2\ndiabetes, obesity and insulin resistance such as the use of\nmedications and lifestyle changes to stop smoking,\nincrease exercise, and incorporate diet modification to\nlower blood glucose levels, blood pressure, and choles-\ndiabetes-related preventive care has been low [25].\nWhile smoking status is routinely measured through self-\nreport, the validity of such self-reported smoking data\nmay be suspect because individuals may give invalid self-\nreport of their smoking status. Carbon monoxide and nic-\notine/cotinine are widely used biomarkers of tobacco or\ntobacco smoke exposure providing objective measures of\nsmoking data [26-32]. Nearly all studies reporting smok-\ning status collect self-reported data that are very rarely val-\nidated. For example, there were 191 original articles,\nclinical practice, clinical implications of basic research\nand health policy reports with \"smoking\" in the text of the\nNew England Journal of Medicine from January 2001\ncotinine-determined smoking measures.\nSelf-reported smoking status underestimates smoking\nprevalence in certain populations [33-35]. Data relevant\nto identifying smokers who deny smoking in a meta-anal-\nysis on validity of self-reported smoking status reported\nan average 13% of \"true\" smokers reported invalid non-\nsmoking status, with a wide variation ranging from 0% to\n94% [36]. This wide variation may be related to the differ-\nent study designs including distinct objective measures of\nsmoking such as carbon monoxide, carboxyhemoglobin,\nthiocyanate, serum or salivary cotinine, and very different\nstudy populations.\nOne important question is whether the proportion of\nrespondents who smoke but report they are not smoking\nis a systematic (i.e. differential) misclassification bias so as\nto confound the relationships between predictors and\ndependent variables. Smoking misclassification bias has\nbeen found with a correlation as low as 0.40 between self-\nreported and cotinine-determined smoking [31]. Invalid\nreporting of smoking may explain the effect of a main\nexposure (eg. beta-carotene), indicating the need to\ninclude biomarkers of smoking in epidemiologic studies\n[31]. In other words, if smoking is measured with error,\nand smoking is associated with an exposure of interest, it\nwill be difficult to rule out smoking as the true cause of the\nassociation between the exposure of interest and the out-\ncome, hence leading to a biased estimate.\nWhen looking at the evidence, with respect to significant\nproportions of smokers who self-reported as non-smokers\nin population-based studies, it may be expected that the\nmore social pressure exists against smoking in a society or\nthe personally relevant social network of the smoker, the\nlarger may be her/his propensity to deny smoking. It is\nhypothesized that people who have or have had smoking-\nrelated severe diseases such as diabetes or myocardial inf-\narction have a strong propensity to deny smoking. Thus,\nthere are sociodemographic characteristics such as age,\nrace/ethnicity, gender, education and income, along with\nsmoking-related diseases in which patients are advised\nnot to smoke, that may be of relevance for invalid self-\nreported statements.\nThe current literature supports a recommendation that\nself-reported smoking status be confirmed by biochemical\npatients deny smoking [38], even after having been\ninformed that they would be tested for tobacco smoke\nexposure [39]. A research approach referred to as the\n\"bogus pipeline\" strategy, informs study participants that\ntheir self-reports can or will be verified by a monitoring\ndevice [40]. As applied to self-reported tobacco use, par-\nticipants are informed that their self-reports can or will be\nverified by a biochemical test, then specimens are col-\nlected but not analyzed. This approach may not be rele-\nvant to the third National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES III) participants because\nthey were aware that their serum would be tested for many\ncomponents, but there was not a focus on the cotinine\nassay.\nTypically, studies reporting on validity of self-reported\nsmoking for different groups have used a single covariate,\ncategories [45]. While the question of the accuracy of self-\nreported smoking has been previously reported, this ques-\ntion has not been approached through a population-\nbased study simultaneously assessing age, race/ethnicity-\ngender, education, income, and smoking-related diseases\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nas predictors of invalid self-reported non-smoking by\n\"true\" smokers. Previous studies focused on self-reported\nsmoking as the denominator, not on \"true\" smokers. That\nis, previous studies investigated the question, among\nthose who report they smoke or do not smoke, what pro-\nportion truly smoke or do not smoke. But, there has not\nbeen a focus on the question, among those who truly\nsmoke, what proportion report they do not smoke.\nThe objectives of our study include: (1) Describe sociode-\nmographic characteristics and smoking-related disease\nstatus for valid and invalid reporting of smoking status by\n\"true\" smokers; and (2) Assess predictors by quantifying\nthe association between invalid self-reported non-smok-\ning and age, race/ethnicity, gender, income, education,\ndiabetes, myocardial infarction, and hypertension, among\n\"true\" smokers in NHANES III [46].\nMethods\nStudy population\nsurvey of civilian noninstitutionalized individuals, repre-\nsentative of the US population. NHANES employs a com-\nplex, multistage, stratified, clustered sample design.\nNHANES includes questionnaire, laboratory assays and\nclinical examination measures of health outcomes and\nexplanatory variables. The data relevant to this study are:\nresponses to questions regarding age, race/ethnicity, gen-\nder, household income, education, history of tobacco use,\ndiabetes, myocardial infarction, hypertension, and labo-\nratory assay of serum cotinine. This study was reviewed by\nthe Case Western Reserve University institutional review\nboard and approved as exempt under 45 Code of Federal\nthe Data Use Restrictions for the NHANES III public-use\ndata set.\nParticipants provided informed consent to voluntarily\nparticipate in the interview, or the interview and examina-\ntion, or the interview, examination and laboratory tests\npleted the Household Adult Questionnaire indicating\nthey did not currently use smokeless tobacco, pipe or\ncigars, and completed the Mobile Examination Center\n(MEC) question \"How many cigarettes have you smoked\nin the past 5 days?\" and reported they did not use nicotine\ngum in the past 5 days. Among the 7295 participants with\nMEC smoking status 410 (4.3% weighted percent) did not\nhave serum cotinine data, resulting in 6885 adults, ages\n45+ years, who did not use smokeless tobacco, pipe,\ncigars, or nicotine gum with MEC smoking status and\nweighted percent) cotinine-determined smokers 45+\nyears of age in the NHANES III data set who did not cur-\nrently use smokeless tobacco, pipe, cigars, or nicotine\ngum. We restricted our analyses to 45+ year olds because\nstudies investigating diabetes and myocardial infarction\ntypically assess individuals who develop the condition at\nDefinition of main outcome\nThe main outcome was invalid non-smoking status,\ndefined as \"true\" smokers who self-reported as non-smok-\ners during the MEC component of NHANES III. Cotinine\nis a biochemical measure of tobacco exposure, it is a\nmetabolite of nicotine indicating exposure during the pre-\nvious 1 to 2 days [29]. Serum cotinine was assayed using\nan isotope dilution, liquid chromatography, tandem mass\nspectrometry method with a limit of detection of 0.03 ng/\nml [46]. Thus, we used this gold standard to identify\n\"true\" smokers as those adults with serum cotinine levels\nsmokers was based on the finding that serum cotinine\nlevel has a bimodal distribution, with a separation\nbetween the two peaks at serum cotinine level of 10\u00ad15\nng/ml. This distinguishes active tobacco use and second-\nhand smoke exposure because the highest serum cotinine\nlevel in a nonsmoker exposed to second hand smoke is\ncutpoint of 15 ng/ml of serum cotinine to identify coti-\nnine-determined smokers who self-reported they cur-\nrently do not smoke. Henceforth, we will refer to cotinine-\ndetermined smokers as \"true\" smokers.\nDefinition of explanatory variables\nTo meet the objectives of our study we assessed the role\nthat smoking-related diseases may play in the validity of\nself-reported smoking status by focusing on three highly\nprevalent smoking-related diseases. We also assessed soci-\nodemographic characteristics that play a role in disease\nstatus and may play a role in the amount of social pressure\nagainst smoking in the individual's social network. Thus,\nthe potential explanatory variables for invalid self-\nreported non-smoking status by \"true\" smokers were age,\nrace/ethnicity, gender, household income, education, dia-\nbetes, myocardial infarction, and hypertension status. Age\ncategories previously used for NHANES publications [48],\nwith six race/ethnicity-gender categories, namely Non-\nHispanic White (NHW) females, Non-Hispanic Black\n(NHB) females, Mexican-American (MA) females, NHW\nmales, NHB males, and MA males. The race/ethnicity cat-\negory \"other\" was excluded due to small or zero cell\ncounts. Household income and education were dichot-\nomized as categories previously used in NHANES publica-\ntions, such that household income was defined as less\ndichotomized as high school graduate (Yes/No) [49,50].\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nTo further elucidate potential explanatory variables, we\nassessed three highly prevalent smoking-related diseases\nin which patients are advised not to smoke, namely diabe-\ntes, myocardial infarction, and hypertension. While we\nhypothesized that people who suffer from these smoking-\nrelated diseases may have a strong propensity to deny\nsmoking, we recognize the current clinical guidelines rec-\nommend that all patients who use tobacco be advised to\nquit [51], not just those who already have disease. For\nmales, diabetes status was based on their response to\nwhether they were ever told by a doctor that they had dia-\nbetes or sugar diabetes (Yes/No). Females were defined as\nhaving diabetes if they had been told by a doctor that they\nhad diabetes or sugar diabetes when they were not preg-\nnant. Women with diabetes only during pregnancy were\ndefined as not having diabetes. Participants responding\nthat a doctor ever told them that they had a heart attack\nwere defined as having a history of myocardial infarction,\nand those responding that they were told by a doctor or\nother health professional that they had hypertension, on\ntwo or more different visits were defined as having hyper-\ntension.\nStatistical analyses\nWe compared invalid self-reported non-smoking among\nage, race/ethnicity-gender categories, education, and\nhousehold income for \"true\" smokers with and without\ndiabetes, history of myocardial infarction, and hyperten-\nsion. This study compared two distinct measures of smok-\ning status, self-reported questionnaire data and laboratory\nassay results for serum cotinine. SAS-callable SUDAAN\n[52] was used for all analyses, to account for complex sur-\nvey design and sample weights in NHANES III. To assess\npredictors of invalid self-reported non-smoking we quan-\ntified the association between invalid self-reported non-\nsmoking and age, race/ethnicity-gender categories\n(reported to indicate interaction), income, education, dia-\nbetes, history of myocardial infarction, and hypertension\nby calculating the odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence\ninterval (CI) for both the unadjusted or crude OR\n(ORCrude\n), and the adjusted OR (ORAdj\n) using multiple\nlogistic regression modeling, simultaneously adjusting for\nthe potential explanatory variables.\nResults\nOverall descriptive summary\nThe descriptive summary for invalid self-reported non-\nsmoking by \"true\" smokers, who do not currently use\nsmokeless tobacco, pipe, cigars or nicotine gum is\nreported in Table 1, along with the ORCrude\nfor the associ-\nation between invalid self-reported non-smoking and the\npotential explanatory variables. The overall invalid\nreported non-smoking was 5.8%. Older \"true\" smokers\n=\n2.26) more likely to report invalid non-smoking than\nNHW smokers (5.8%).

There was no statistically significant\nassociation between invalid self-reported non-smoking\nand gender, income, history of myocardial infarction, or\nhypertension.\nInvalid self-reported non-smoking by \"true\" smokers with\nand without diabetes\nThe age-specific descriptive summary of \"true\" smokers\nself-reporting their smoking status is reported in Table 2,\nalong with six gender-race/ethnicity specific categories,\nstratified by diabetes status.

Among \"true\" smokers without diabetes the pro-\nportion self-reporting invalid non-smoking was higher for\nwithout diabetes, 5.1% self-reported as non-smokers,\nranging from 2.5% of MA females, to 6.8% of MA males\nand 9.5% of NHB females.\nInvalid self-reported non-smoking by \"true\" smokers with\nand without a history of myocardial infarction\nIn Table 2, the proportion of \"true\" smokers with a history\nof myocardial infarction reporting non-smoking was\n(1.9%). Among 45+ year old \"true\" smokers with a history\nof myocardial infarction, 6.4% self-reported as non-smok-\ners, ranging from 0.0% of MA females, to 37.0% of MA\nmales. Among \"true\" smokers without a history of myo-\ncardial infarction the proportion self-reporting invalid\nnon-smoking was higher for 65+ year olds (12.4%) than\nsmokers without a history of myocardial infarction, 5.8%\nself-reported as non-smokers, ranging from 3.3%\u00ad6.6%\nof MA females, MA males, NHW females, NHB males and\nNHW males, to 11.8% of NHB females.\nInvalid self-reported non-smoking by \"true\" smokers with\nand without hypertension\nIn Table 2, the proportion of \"true\" smokers with hyper-\ntension reporting non-smoking was higher among older\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nwith hypertension, 7.0% self-reported as non-smokers,\nranging from 2.9% of MA females, to 15.6% of MA males.\nAmong \"true\" smokers without hypertension the propor-\ntion self-reporting invalid non-smoking was higher\namong older smokers with 13.2% of 65+ year olds com-\n\"true\" smokers without hypertension, 5.3% self-reported\nas non-smokers, ranging from 3.2%\u00ad4.9% of MA females,\nNHW females, MA males, and NHB males, to 11.0% of\nNHB females.\nAssociation between invalid self-reported non-smoking\nand diabetes, history of myocardial infarction,\nhypertension, and socioeconomic status\nThe most parsimonious model for the association\nbetween invalid self-reported non-smoking and diabetes,\nsimultaneously adjusting for education, and race/ethnic-\nity-gender is reported in Table 3.

Our study found \"true\"\nsmokers with diabetes were more likely to report invalid\nnon-smoking than \"true\" smokers without diabetes, but\nhaving a history of myocardial infarction or hypertension\ndid not predict invalid reporting of non-smoking. A pos-\nsible explanation for these different results regarding pre-\ndictors of invalid self-reported non-smoking may be\nrelated to the relatively slowly progressing chronic nature\nof diabetes compared to acute myocardial infarction\nwhich could be considered a more serious, major life\nchanging event. This possibility is based on the finding\nthat smokers who had a history of myocardial infarction\nwere over four times more likely to quit smoking than\nthose being diagnosed with diabetes [53], and that dura-\ntion of diabetes was not associated with smoking [54].\nThus smokers who had a history of myocardial infarction\nmay be more likely to truly quit smoking than smokers\nwith diabetes or hypertension.\nA possible explanation for our results differing from pre-\nvious reports may be related to our modeling approach.\nWe assessed invalid self-reported non-smoking by \"true\"\nsmokers as the outcome, fitting diabetes, education, race/\nethnicity and gender main effects along with an interac-\ntion term, whereas the other approaches were based on\nunadjusted analyses or multiple regression analyses of\nself-reported smoking without interaction terms. The\nincorporation of an interaction term for race/ethnicity\nand gender allows for the ascertainment of \"true\" smokers\nwho are more likely to report non-smoking, in order to\ndevelop a targeted approach to identify smokers for smok-\ning cessation interventions. This is important in light of\nthe findings that health care providers and individuals\nwith diabetes are not sufficiently aware of the increased\nrisk of developing cardiovascular disease for smokers with\nTo the best of our knowledge our study is the first popula-\ntion-based report on invalid self-reported non-smoking\nrestricted to those who do not currently use smokeless\ntobacco, pipe, cigars, or nicotine gum. Even though there\nmay be some invalid responses to the use of non-cigarette\ntobacco products, these products were used much less fre-\nquently in NHANES III with 4990 current cigarette smok-\ncurrent cigar users and 148 current pipe users. If the pro-\nportion of adults who report invalid non-tobacco use is\nsimilar for each tobacco group, cigarette users would be\nimpacted the most because of the higher prevalence. This\nmay explain why our results differ from previous reports.\nDue to this restriction, our study had limited statistical\npower related to the small sample size in the age, race/eth-\nnicity-gender specific subgroup analyses, especially when\nthe analyses were stratified by diabetes, history of myocar-\ndial infarction, and hypertension history. While the oldest\n(i.e., 65+ year old) \"true\" smokers were more likely to self-\nreport non-smoking than 44\u00ad64 year olds, the effect of\nage was not assessed further due to the small sample size\nof younger smokers with diabetes or history of myocardial\ninfarction who self-reported as non-smokers.\nDeception may explain most of the invalid self-reports of\nnon-smoking [55]. Social desirability related to the social\nunacceptability of cigarette smoking [56] is an additional\npossible explanation of the invalid self-reported non-\nsmoking status by \"true\" smokers. That is, NHB female\nsmokers, smokers with diabetes or who did not graduate\nfrom high school may be more prone to being influenced\nTable 3: Association between invalid self-reported non-smoking and diabetes, education, and race/ethnicity-gender, 45+ year olds,\nExplanatory Variable ORAdj\nBold font identifies the statistically significant associations (* p < 0.05).\nNote, all adults did not currently use smokeless tobacco, pipe, cigars, or nicotine gum, and had serum cotinine data. Invalid self-report was defined\nas \"true\" smokers self-reporting as non-smokers. Valid self-report was defined as \"true\" smokers self-reporting as smokers.\nHS: High School; NHW: Non-Hispanic White; NHB: Non-Hispanic-Black: MA: Mexican-American\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nby social pressure to not smoke and thus provide the\nsocially desirable non-smoking response.\nIn addition, other researchers have investigated potential\nexplanations for serum cotinine levels in non-smokers,\nincluding dietary intake of food items previously reported\nto have measurable levels of nicotine, such as potatoes,\ntomatoes, eggplant, cauliflower, green peppers, iced tea,\nand brewed tea [29]. These food items were not significant\nin the regression models for adults [29].\nWe believe this limitation is outweighed by the following\nstrengths of our study: 1) focusing on the most relevant\npatient management, public health surveillance, and\nstudy design issues of \"true\" smokers by incorporating an\nobjective measure to complement self-report; 2) analyses\nrestricted to those who did not currently use smokeless\ntobacco, cigars, pipes, or nicotine gum addressed the lim-\nitation of cotinine being elevated in users of snuff and\nchewing tobacco [36]; 3) our modeling approach\nincluded race/ethnicity-gender interaction; 4) NHANES\nIII sampling methodology is designed to represent the US\npopulation; 5) high quality and quantity of question-\nnaire, examination and laboratory data collected in an\nunbiased manner such that the participants were unaware\nof our study on predictors of invalid self-reporting of non-\nsmoking status.\n\"True\" smokers reporting non-smoking have higher mor-\ntality rates, higher prevalence of tobacco-related cancer,\nand higher prevalence of a history of myocardial infarc-\ntion compared to true nonsmokers [43]. Our findings\nindicate that the impact of invalid self-reported non-\nsmoking on morbidity and mortality may slightly under-\nestimate the true impact for 45\u00ad64 year olds, with a more\nsubstantially under-estimate for 65+ year olds. In addi-\nsmoking prevalence [57,58] is based on self-reported data\nthat are generally reported to be valid [36]. However,\napparently not considered was the wide variability in the\nproportion of smokers reporting they were not smokers\nranging from 0% to 94% [36]. Our findings raise concerns\nregarding invalid self-reported non-smoking by specific\nage, race/ethnicity-gender, education or diabetes. Addi-\ntional research using a similar approach with larger sam-\nple sizes, that simultaneously takes into account\nsociodemographic and health status characteristics is\nneeded to investigate this study's findings further.\nThese findings have potentially important general impli-\ncations. An objective assessment of tobacco use, either\nthrough a targeted approach by health care providers, or\nas the general protocol when collecting tobacco use data\nin a population surveillance, clinical, or epidemiologic\nstudy, identifies smokers who deny smoking. Three gen-\neral implications are: 1) Identification of smokers who\ndeny smoking provides an opportunity for health care\nproviders to present tobacco cessation counseling to those\nindividuals who would not otherwise receive such advice,\nwith the objective being the improvement of the individ-\nual patient's health. 2) Collection of an objective measure\nof current tobacco use may provide a better estimate of the\ntrue prevalence rates in the population and/or among the\nspecific age, race, and gender subgroups. 3) Using an\nobjective measure of tobacco use in a clinical or epidemi-\nologic study addresses the possible explanation that the\nresults may be due to systematic misclassification bias of\nself-reported tobacco use.\nOne approach to address smoking misclassification in\nclinical or epidemiologic studies would be the develop-\nment of a statistical approach, similar to those available\nbut limited to a single covariate [59,60]. Alternative\napproaches include incorporating objective smoking\nmeasures to complement self-report by excluding \"true\"\nsmokers who report never, or former tobacco use, or to\ncreate and assess a separate category of \"true\" smokers\nwho report never or former tobacco use. Even though\nobjective tobacco use measures identify current \"true\"\ntobacco-users, and most smoking-related diseases are\nchronic requiring a smoking history, by excluding \"true\"\nsmokers self-reporting non-smoking (i.e., never or former\nsmoking) this decreases smoking misclassification bias,\nand may decrease bias associated with other inaccurate\nresponses such as self-reported disease status. Further\ninvestigation of questions assessing the validity of self-\nreported smoking status may also be useful.\nConclusion\nWe found non-random or systematic bias, indicating the\ninability to determine the direction in which reported esti-\nmates differ from the true effects (under-estimate, over-\nestimate, or true estimate). Validity of self-reported non-\nsmoking may be related to the relatively slowly progress-\ning chronic nature of diabetes, in contrast with the acute\nevent of myocardial infarction which could be considered\na more serious, major life changing event. These data also\nraise questions regarding the possible role of societal\ndesirability in the validity of self-reported non-smoking,\nespecially among \"true\" smokers with diabetes, NHB\nfemales, and those who did not graduate from high\nschool. Health care providers may consider using objec-\ntive measures of tobacco use, especially among those sub-\ngroups that are more likely to deny smoking, followed by\ntobacco cessation counseling and intervention informa-\ntion. Studies collecting self-reported smoking data must\naddress the potentially invalid reporting of non-smoking,\nand should include a statement about the potentially\nbiased estimate.\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nCompeting interests\nThe author(s) declare that they have no competing inter-\nests.\nAuthors' contributions\nMAF conceived of the study, completed the analyses,\ninterpreted findings and led the writing.
