Popkin\n Key words: cluster analysis, physical activity, sedentary,\nchildren, incident overweight\nIntroduction\nResearch on physical activity, including studies evaluat-\ning physical activity patterns and obesity, typically sepa-\nrates measures of activity during work and leisure time and\nmeasures of inactivity such as television viewing and video\ngame playing. Clearly for many individuals, physical activ-\nity and sedentary behavior covary in meaningful ways and\nare not randomly distributed; that is, they are correlated\nwithin the same individual. In studying these factors sepa-\nrately, we may miss major overall dimensions of activity\nand inactivity that affect obesity. While consideration of\nmultidimensionality or patterning of health behaviors has\nbeen used regularly in other disciplines, the physical activ-\nity field has not yet embraced methodologies to deal with\nthis issue. This paper presents one method for examining\nthese co-occurring behaviors in a joint manner rather than as\nindependent factors and examines how this approach differs\nfrom the more traditional method of studying the activity-\ninactivity-obesity nexus.\nUnderlying the concern for this study is the worldwide\nobesity pandemic. Obesity is particularly common among\nadults but is increasingly found among children and ado-\nlescents (1\u00ad8). Reduction in physical activity is ascribed as\none of the major causes for the increased energy imbalance\namong children (9,10), yet because of the paucity of longi-\ntudinal data on youth physical activity patterns in develop-\ning countries, this hypothesis remains relatively unstudied\nin these locations. Furthermore, with the exception of a few\nstudies examining television viewing and obesity, results of\nstudies evaluating activity and/or inactivity and their rela-\ntionship to youth obesity are inconsistent and are far from\nThe costs of publication of this article were defrayed, in part, by the payment of page\ncharges.

Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies\nhave shown that obese children spend less time in moderate\nand vigorous physical activity and that children who engage\nin the least vigorous physical activity or the most television\nviewing tend to be the most overweight (11\u00ad18). While it\nmay seem intuitively obvious to combine the roles of ac-\ntivity and inactivity or to examine them together, the focus\ninstead has been on examining each dimension separately,\nusually in separate studies. Thus, an important methodolog-\nical consideration is to evaluate the use of methods that\ncombine activity and inactivity in new ways.\nThis study uses longitudinal data on Chinese youth to\nexamine alternate ways of representing physical activity and\ninactivity patterns as exposures for child obesity. Cluster\nanalysis can be used to place children in mutually exclusive\ngroups delineated by both their activity and inactivity be-\nhaviors. This technique has been used frequently in health\nbehavior\u00adhealth outcome research, particularly in studies of\ndietary patterns and relevant health outcomes (19\u00ad22);\nhowever, thus far in our knowledge, non-hierarchical clus-\ntering methodologies have not been similarly used to create\npatterns of activity and inactivity. Data reduction method-\nologies such as factor analysis have been used in past\nstudies using activity and inactivity data to try to limit the\nnumber of explanatory variables and, thus, provide a more\nreliable measure of overall activity (23), but this method\ndoes not give each child a unique pattern and is more\ndifficult to interpret and use as a basis for developing\noverall patterning measures. For further information spe-\ncific to pattern analysis methodology, see studies by Hu (24)\nand Togo et al. (25). For this paper, we used select measures\nof activity and inactivity to form patterns, or clusters, po-\ntentially addressing an important methodological consider-\nation and evaluated their ability to predict overweight sta-\ntus.\nResearch Methods and Procedures\nStudy Population\nThe China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS)1 is a\nlongitudinal monitoring survey with data collections in\npopulation represents a diverse mixture with respect to\nsocioeconomic factors such as income, employment, and\neducation, as well as other health, nutritional, and demo-\ngraphic factors. Additional details are available on the In-\nternet (http://www.cpc.unc.edu/projects/china). This paper\nfocuses on data collected in the survey years of 1997 and\n2000. Detailed physical activity data on children and ado-\nlescents were first collected in 1997, with the first follow-up\nThe analysis sample of children and adolescents con-\nsisted of subjects between 6 and 18 years of age who were\nenrolled in school at the time of data collection. The 1997\nbetween 6 and 18 years of age who were surveyed in both\nyears made up the longitudinal cohort. Children not attend-\ning school were excluded before analysis because of differ-\nences in the survey questions asked of those respondents\nattending school vs. those not attending school. Further\nexclusions were made on the basis of incomplete or incon-\nsistent height, weight, demographic, and activity data.\nVariable Creation\nRespondents attending school were asked to report hours\nand minutes per week spent in each of a number of active\nand inactive pursuits; active pursuits were queried sepa-\nrately for time spent outside of and during school hours,\nwhereas inactive pursuits were queried only regarding time\nbefore and after school. Descriptive analyses showed that\nthe majority of school-aged youths did not participate in\nphysical activity outside of school hours. For those activi-\nties completed while at school, the questionnaire did not\ndistinguish between organized physical education and in-\nformal activities at recess or lunchtime. Activity variables\nmin/d. For further descriptive details regarding activity and\ninactivity measures in the CHNS, see Tudor-Locke et al.\nFour physical activity variables (gymnastics in school,\nteam sports in school, track or swimming in school, and\nactive commuting) and two physical inactivity variables\n(television/video watching, and reading/writing/drawing/\nhomework) were used in final cluster formation. We did not\nuse the remaining activity/inactivity variables because of\nthe low prevalence in the sample, where the overwhelming\nmajority of respondents indicated 0 min/wk participation.\nInitially, all activity and inactivity variables were included\nin cluster formation because we thought there might be an\nimportant subset of children who participated in these spe-\ncific less prevalent activities; inclusion, however, did not\nilluminate such a pattern and increased the noise of the\nresulting clusters to a degree that made them difficult to\ninterpret. Thus, we limited our usage to variables that had\n10% prevalence within the analysis sample. The majority\nof the excluded variables were those representing physical\nactivity and not inactivity. Specifically, because the major-\nity of youths did not engage in physical activity outside of\nschool hours, these activities were excluded from cluster\nformation. Similarly, the variables querying the inactive\npursuits \"board games\" and \"listening to the radio\" were\nexcluded from cluster formation.\n1 Nonstandard abbreviations: CHNS, China Health and Nutrition Survey.\nPatterning Activity\u00adBMI Relationship, Monda and Popkin\nHeight and weight were measured directly by trained\nhealth workers following a standard protocol. Body weight\nwas measured in lightweight clothing to the nearest 0.1 kg\nand height to the nearest 0.1 cm. BMI was calculated as\nweight (kilograms) over height squared (meters squared).\nIndividual BMI percentile was computed by standardizing\nto the Centers for Disease Control 2000 age- and sex-\nspecific growth charts for individuals (31). For this paper,\noverweight was considered to be 85th percentile.\nCluster Analysis Strategy\nCluster analysis methods attempt to find natural group-\nings in data by clustering respondents into groups (clusters)\nbased on their variable values (24,32). Partition, or non-\nhierarchical, cluster analysis methods break the data into a\nuser-specified number of nonoverlapping groups. Compu-\ntationally, the goal is to minimize variability within clusters\nand maximize variability between clusters. Cluster variabil-\nity is measured with respect to their means for classifying\nvariables such that when more than one variable is used, the\ndistances between clusters are measured in multidimen-\nsional space. After generation, cluster membership becomes\na variable with which to perform further analyses--in our\ncase, the primary exposure variable.\nWe created physical activity/inactivity clusters using the\n1997 data, specifying three-, four-, five-, and six-cluster\nsolutions. There was little benefit in using the less parsimo-\nnious five- or six-cluster solution over the four-cluster so-\nlution. Inspection of the resulting clusters revealed that the\ninactivity variables were more apt to differentiate between\nclusters than activity variables. Thus, to enable further dif-\nferentiation on the activity level, we reran the clustering\nmethods using only the four activity variables and achieved\nsubstantial differentiation with a three-cluster solution. The\nfour inactivity clusters were cross-tabbed with the three\nactivity clusters, and relevant categories based on level\n(low, moderate, high) of activity and inactivity were\ngrouped to form a final seven-cluster solution. The cluster\nanalysis algorithms provide the researcher with a set of\nclusters that are internally consistent but completely driven\nby the data and somewhat complex to interpret. From earlier\nstudies, we learned that a critical final step is to use the\nclusters to design groupings--in this case, based on the\nvariables involved in the cluster analysis--that are readily\nter analysis will always produce a classification solution\nwhether or not it makes any intuitive sense or has any\npredictive benefit. Thus, the predictive validity of the clus-\nters was assessed cross-sectionally using overweight status\nas a criterion variable that is expected to vary across cluster\nbut was not used in cluster generation. All clusters were\noriginally created with the use of PROC FASTCLUS algo-\nrithms (version 8.1; SAS Institute, Cary, NC); however, to\ntrack activity patterns longitudinally, we manually recoded\nthe computer-generated clusters so that respondents could\nbe assigned to clusters using the same protocol in both\nsurvey years.\nData Analyses\nPhysical activity/inactivity clusters were entered as indi-\ncator variables into the model. We first conducted cross-\nsectional analyses among children 6 to 18 years of age for\noverweight status and activity/inactivity cluster. Second, we\nconducted longitudinal analyses to examine whether activ-\nity/inactivity cluster membership in 1997 significantly pre-\ndicted overweight status 3 years later. Third, to evaluate\nwhether further insight was gained using cluster analysis\nmethods, we ran logistic regression models in which total\nminutes per day spent in active and inactive pursuits were\nentered as separate variables into the model (called herein\nthe \"traditional\" model). Both continuous and categorical\ncoding schemes were evaluated. To test for interaction of\nthe activity and inactivity variables, we performed a likeli-\nhood ratio test of the interaction terms. For both the cross-\nsectional and longitudinal models, we failed to reject the\nnull hypothesis that the coefficients of the interaction terms\nequaled zero, and, thus, we removed the interaction terms\nfrom the models and proceeded with the reduced (main\neffects) models as our final models. All cross-sectional\nlogistic regression models were adjusted for age, sex, and\nurban/rural residence; longitudinal models of incident over-\nweight were further adjusted for baseline overweight status.\nResults\nSelectivity Analysis\nThe cross-sectional analysis sample from 1997 comprised\nindividuals. For 2000, the analysis sample was comprised of\nindividuals. Of the children with complete anthropometric\nrespectively, excluded because they were not in school. In\nboth time periods, children not in school were significantly\nolder, more rural, of lower income, and, in 1997 only, less\nlikely to be overweight. In the longitudinal sample, of the\ncollection periods, 503 were excluded because of missing or\ninconsistent height, weight, or demographic data, bringing\nthe final total to 1175. Individuals in the longitudinal anal-\nysis sample were younger than those in the cross-sectional\nsample, but no other significant differences were found.\nTable 1 presents the distributions of sociodemographic and\nPatterning Activity\u00adBMI Relationship, Monda and Popkin\nsectional analysis and excluded samples and those of the\ncombined longitudinal sample. Age group was defined as\n12 years and 12 years, a cut-point that has been used in\nearlier analyses on this sample of Chinese youth (30). It is\nat this age that Chinese children leave primary school and\nweight, BMI, and percentage overweight increased,\nwhereas percentage underweight decreased, although none\nof these differences was significant.\nCluster Breakdown\nAfter clustering, we needed a simple way to identify and\nrepresent the clusters in our analyses. Because the clusters\ndid not differentiate on type of activity (e.g., there was not\na \"gymnastics\" cluster), we chose to differentiate on overall\namount of time spent in active and inactive pursuits (Figure\n1; Table 2). Thus, \"low\" activity refers to the clusters of\nchildren who did not participate in gymnastics, team sports,\nor track/swimming but did actively commute to school.\nFurthermore, the differentiation between \"moderate\" and\n\"high\" activity levels was based on a child's participation in\nteam sports and slightly higher average levels of time spent\nin track/swimming. Inactivity was also more easily de-\nscribed using amount of time spent rather than type of\ninactive pursuit. All children with either moderate or high\nlevels of inactivity spent time both watching television/\nvideos and reading/homework; they merely differentiated in\nthe average amount of time spent. Oddly, we discerned no\n\"low\" inactivity cluster; rather our sample distinguished\nthose individuals who reported no time spent in inactive\npursuits. We acknowledge that there is likely something\nunique about these children, that it is unlikely they spend no\ntime in inactive pursuits, but that we failed to capture them\nwith the relevant explanatory variables available to us. In\nmodels using activity/inactivity cluster as the exposure vari-\nable, clusters were entered in as indicator variables with the\nlow activity/no inactivity cluster serving as referent. We\nselected this cluster as the referent because not only did it\nhave the lowest mean level of overall physical activity, but\nalso its members showed the highest levels of prevalent\noverweight. We felt that these characteristics would aid in\nthe meaningful interpretation of results.\nTable 1.

Cluster break-\ndown did not change drastically among the three samples;\nthe moderate physical activity/moderate inactivity cluster\ncomprised the majority of individuals, and the low phys-\nical activity/high inactivity cluster comprised the least in\nall three. Figure 1 is a representation of the mean levels\nof each of the six used activity and inactivity variables\nper cluster within the longitudinal sample. As seen in\nFigure 1, the majority of time captured was in inactive\npursuits, especially reading and homework, and the most\ncommon activity was walking or biking to school.

All\nmodels were controlled for age, sex, and urban or rural\nresidence; incident models were additionally controlled for\nbaseline overweight. Table 3 summarizes these findings.\nUsing the 1997 data in cross-sectional analyses, we found a\nsignificant reduction in the odds of overweight among those\nindividuals who were either moderately or highly active\ncompared with those with low levels of activity and no\nreported inactivity (low physical activity/no inactivity).\nThose with low levels of activity and either moderate or\nhigh levels of inactivity (low physical activity/moderate\ninactivity and low physical activity/high inactivity) were not\ndifferent from the referent group. Activity level seems to be\ndriving this relationship because we see no noticeable effect\ncaused by level of inactivity. Results for the cross-sectional\nrelationship between activity/inactivity cluster and over-\nnone were significant (data not shown). Longitudinal mod-\nels used to predict prevalent overweight in 2000 from ac-\ntivity/inactivity cluster in 1997 among a cohort of school-\nchildren revealed reduced odds of overweight for those\nmoderately or highly active regardless of level of inactivity.\nAdditionally, children in the low physical activity/moderate\ninactivity cluster were significantly less likely to be over-\nweight than those in the low physical activity/high inactivity\ncluster, who were not significantly different from the refer-\nent cluster. Note, however, that these two clusters are not\nsignificantly different from each other; thus, we cannot\nascribe the reduced odds of overweight within those who\nhave low activity to decreased inactivity. Nonetheless, this\ndifference is meaningful because the low physical activity/\nmoderate inactivity cluster had, on average, higher mean\nlevels of active commuting than the low physical activity/no\ninactivity cluster (Figure 1), although they are both labeled\nas \"low\" active. The longitudinal results did not change\nactivity/inactivity cluster by controlling for baseline over-\nweight in the models.\nLogistic Analyses of Overweight Status using Traditional\nModeling Techniques\nTo evaluate whether there was any benefit to clustering\nactivity and inactivity, we ran traditional logistic regression\nmodels where total times spent in active and inactive pur-\nsuits were modeled as separate exposure variables within\nthe same model. We summed the total times spent in the\nfour physical activity variables and the two inactivity vari-\nables and tested their respective associations with over-\nweight using both continuous and categorical coding strat-\n60 min/d; total inactivity was categorized as 1, 1 to 3,\nand 3 h/d. Categorizations were based on the univariate\ndistributions of the summary variables. Results are summa-\nrized in Table 4. Analyses of the cross-sectional relationship\nTable 3.

Curiously, increasing amounts of inactivity also\nshowed an inverse relationship with odds of overweight;\nhowever, these relationships were not significant using ei-\nther categorical or continuous coding. The cross-sectional\nresults did not particularly deviate from those seen using\ncluster analysis methods. In longitudinal models predicting\nprevalent overweight, we saw a similar decrease in the odds\nof overweight with increasing activity, although this rela-\ntionship was significant only at the 60 min/d category.\nAdditionally, we again saw the curious, although nonsig-\nnificant, inverse relationship between increased inactivity\nand odds of overweight. Arguably, it is incident overweight\nthat we are most concerned with in modeling this relation-\nship, and, thus, it is an important methodological finding\nthat incident longitudinal models, in contrast to similar\nmodels using cluster analysis, failed to show any relation-\nship of activity or inactivity, coded in either manner, and\noverweight.\nDiscussion\nProfound social and economic developments in China\nover the last 20 years have resulted in shifts in nutrition and\nphysical activity, predominantly in the urban areas, that\nundoubtedly play a role in the emerging obesity problem\n(34). Although researchers intuitively understand the energy\nin\u00adenergy out equation, teasing out the relationship among\nactivity, inactivity, and overweight is complex because of\nits multifactorial nature and many modifying factors, par-\nticularly during the growing years of childhood and adoles-\ncence. The rapid economic and acculturation transforma-\ntions in China include increases in motorized transport,\nwhich we have shown elsewhere to be associated with\nincreases in adult overweight and obesity (35); thus, indi-\nvidual patterns of activity and inactivity would be expected\nto vary and be quite heterogeneous depending on a number\nof socioeconomic and other factors. Respondents were que-\nried about home production activities including cleaning,\nchildcare, gardening, and other chores, and we might expect\ntheir values to differentiate among socioeconomic strata;\nhowever, although these are important sources of physical\nactivity in other developing countries (36), they do not have\nthe same relevance in China, with a majority of respondents\nreporting that they do not perform these activities.\nActivity and inactivity in Chinese youth take on different\nforms than in developed countries such as the United States.\nChinese children spend very little time in before- or after-\nschool sports and other physical activities; the majority of\nthis time is spent in the rigors of preparing for school\nTable 4.

For example, 76.9% of the longitudinal sam-\nple reported participating in physical activity during school,\nwhereas only 8.8% reported participating in any physical\nactivity before or after school hours. In terms of sedentary\nbehaviors, although 90% of households in China own a\ntelevision set, time spent watching television and videos is\nstill more constrained than in the United States, where there\nis greater opportunity and allowance for these types of\nbehaviors. However, American-style satellite programming\nhas only recently been introduced on a large scale, and we\nexpect future research by this group and others to find\ntelevision viewing rapidly increasing among children and,\nfurthermore, to have the type of impact on overweight found\nmore, as television viewing displaces other forms of inac-\ntivity (e.g., homework) in the before- and after-school hours\nof Chinese youth, subsequent research should additionally\ninform the question on the specificity of television viewing\non overweight status.\nUsing cluster analysis techniques in our longitudinal\nanalyses, we were able to uncover an effect of activity/\ninactivity patterns on childhood prevalent and incident over-\nweight over and above that which we found using tradi-\ntional multivariate regression. With clustering techniques,\nwe found that, regardless of level of inactivity, moderate or\nhigh levels of activity resulted in reduced prevalence and\nincidence of overweight in our longitudinal cohort. We were\nunable to reproduce this relationship using traditional meth-\nodologies. Interestingly, we found no measurable increases\nin benefit with high levels of activity over moderate levels\nof activity within any strata of inactivity. Lack of an effect\nat this level could be caused by cluster definition and lack of\nvariability between the two levels. Furthermore, we were\nunable to distinguish any differentiation in overweight prev-\nalence or incidence on the basis of inactivity level. Earlier\ncross-sectional studies done by this group also found lack of\nan effect caused by inactivity in 6- to 11-year-old Chinese\nchildren (39). In the analyses herein, lack of an effect may\nbe caused, in part, by the lesser variability seen within\ninactivity variables; thus, our clusters tell us more about,\nand are driven in formation by, activity. It is notable that we\nfound activity level to be protective against overweight\nregardless of level of inactivity. In fact, the lowest odds of\nincident overweight were observed in the cluster of youth\nwith the highest levels of both physical activity and inac-\ntivity. In a population that is likely to increase their seden-\ntary behaviors as the economic transformation goes for-\nward, continued dominance of school-based physical\nactivity and active commuting may provide an important\nhindrance to increasing levels of overweight and obesity.\nSome limitations of this study warrant consideration. We\nhad a substantial number of children lost to follow-up (n \n344). Those lost to follow-up were more likely to be older,\nmore urban, and of higher income (data not shown). While\noverweight prevalence decreased with increasing age in this\nsample, there were also increases in overweight in urban,\nhigher-income populations. Thus, it is difficult to predict\nwhat effect losing these data points might have had. Addi-\ntionally, because the physical activity/inactivity clusters that\nwere generated are sample-specific, our results are some-\nwhat limited in overall use and specifically limited to\nschoolchildren. Another limitation is that the data collection\nmethod left an amount of time unaccounted for, and we\nwere unable to assess what type(s) of inactivity our cluster\nof low physical activity/no inactivity children engaged in.\nFortunately these children clustered together and formed a\nrelevant group; however, without being able to define the\nways in which they were inactive, we are unable to infer\nbehavioral traits and draw logical conclusions based on\nthese characteristics. Finally, all measures of activity and\ninactivity were self-reported, and, thus, they are susceptible\nto the weaknesses of such data collection techniques. Fur-\nthermore, parents assisted younger children (10 years of\nage) with the survey and may have provided a proxy report\nof their physical activity and inactivity habits. Although the\nvalidity of proxy reports is uncertain, their use is widespread\nand bypasses the biases that may be associated with recall in\nyounger subjects.\nThere are also many strengths of this study. We were able\nfor the first time to analyze physical activity and inactivity\ndata in a longitudinal cohort of diverse children from eight\nprovinces in China, an understudied population that is un-\ndergoing rapid transition that will likely affect their nutri-\ntional status. We were able to show that the cluster analysis\nmethodology is useful in capturing extant behavioral pat-\nterns of activity and inactivity, their predictive ability was\nestablished by association with overweight status, and we\nwere able to find an effect of activity longitudinally where\nwe could not if restricted to traditional regression method-\nologies. By examining activity patterns as they relate to\noverweight status cross-sectionally and longitudinally in an\nexposure-subsequent outcome or exposure-incidence man-\nner, this paper advances the science in ways previously\nunstudied. Cluster analysis allows us to simultaneously cap-\nture activity and inactivity, dimensions of behavior that are\nclearly linked, and we have shown for this sample of Chi-\nnese youth that the proposed approach of creating overall\npatterns of activity and inactivity offer major advantages\nover earlier approaches, where distinct categories of activity\nand inactivity are examined separately. Employing these meth-\nods has furthered our ability to examine the relationship be-\ntween activity patterns and child overweight status in China\nand is a potentially valuable approach for others to explore.\nPatterning Activity\u00adBMI Relationship, Monda and Popkin\n"
