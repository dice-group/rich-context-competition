But, evidence of the poor empirical performance of the\nCAPM has accumulated in the literature. For example, based on their empirical\nresults regarding the relation between market Beta and average return, Fama and\nFrench (1996) conclude that the CAPM is no longer a useful tool for empirical\nfinancial market analysis. Most empirical studies of the conventional CAPM take,\nhowever, neither the fat-tails of return data nor the price relationship between an\nasset of interest and the bench market portfolio into account.\nIn the framework of a univariate Beta-model we consider a stable long-run CAPM\ntaking account of the fat-tails of stock returns and the common stochastic trends\nbetween stock prices. Using the same data used by Fama and French (1996), the\nstable long-run CAPM demonstrates that Markowitz rule of the expected returns\nand variance of returns can (still) --without any use of firm specific variables--\nexplain the variation of the cross-sectional average returns.\nKeywords: CAPM; Stable Paretian distribution; Stochastic common trend.\n Introduction\nCentral banks are more and more concerned with the financial market because of\nits importance not only for their monetary policy, but also for the regulation of\nfinancial institutions regarding risk management. Despite numerous theoretical and\nempirical criticisms, the capital-asset-pricing model (CAPM) has been and is still\none of the most popular standard tools for financial researchers and practitioners\nto quantify the trade-off between risk and expected return in financial markets.\nMarkowitz (1952) argues that investors would optimally hold a portfolio with the\nhighest expected return for a given risk. Based on the so-called mean-variance ef-\nficient portfolio, Sharpe (1965) and Lintner (1966) develop the well-known Sharpe\nand Lintner version of CAPM (henceforth, Sharpe/Lintner CAPM or conventional\nCAPM), in which the expected return of an asset must be linearly related to the\ncovariance of its return with the return of the market portfolio. The economic the-\nory for the CAPM is intuitively clear and the empirical implication of the CAPM is\nplausible, since risky assets will usually yield higher returns than investment free of\nrisk. In line with many reports on anomalies in the 70s and 80s, however, evidence\nof the poor empirical performance of the conventional CAPM has accumulated in\nthe literature. More recently, based on their empirical results regarding the relation\nclared the end of the CAPM as an empirical tool for the analysis of trade-off relations\nbetween risk and returns on stocks. To improve the empirical performance of the\nconventional CAPM, some modifications are also considered in the literature. Most\nof the modifications are performed by including some firm specific variables such as\nfirm-size in Banz (1981) and book-to-market ratio in Fama and French (1992). Some\nof the modifications are based on another probability principle (without any firm\nspecific variables), such as the time-varying market Beta by Jagannathan and Wang\n(1996). Guo and Whitelaw (2000), for example, consider a structural asset-pricing\nmodel in the context of time series, and find a significant positive relationship be-\ntween return and risk. See, for more debate about the CAPM, a nice summary\npaper of Jagannathan and McGrattan (1995).\nIn this paper, we consider a possible modification of the conventional CAPM to\nimprove its empirical performance. For this modification, we examine properties of\nempirical financial data and take them into account:\n1The views expressed in this paper are those of the author, and not necessarily those of the\nDeutsche Bundesbank. I acknowledge the helpful comments of H. Herrmann.\n\u00b7 since the influential works of Mandelbrot (1963), the infinite\u00advariance sta-\nble Paretian (usually -stable) distribution2 has often been considered to be\na more realistic distribution for asset returns than the normal distribution,\nbecause asset returns are typically fat\u00adtailed and excessively peaked around\nzero--phenomena that can be captured by -stable distributions with  < 2.\n\u00b7 Second, the conventional CAPM is based on (excess) returns and, hence, con-\ntains no information of stock prices. Note that returns are first difference of\nlog-prices3 and the log-prices are typically assumed to be random walks (more\nprecisely, martingale). When two stock prices (although each of them follows\na random-walk process) have a common stochastic trend and build a long-\nrun equilibrium, one can use this level information to improve the empirical\nperformance of the CAPM.\nThe modified version of the conventional CAPM introduced in this paper will there-\nfore be based on the empirical evidence for the -stable distributed stock returns\nand the common stochastic trends between stock prices and, hence, may be called\nan (-) stable long-run CAPM (SLCAPM). Consequently, the SLCAPM contains\nnot only the (usual) market Beta as a short-run market Beta, but also a long-run\nmarket Beta in terms of a long-run relationship, and the returns are allowed to be\nnon-normally distributed. An empirical application of the SLCAPM for the Ger-\nman Stock Index (DAX) will show how the stable long-run market Beta can be\nused for measuring risks. In order to demonstrate the empirical performance of the\nSLCAPM, we compare our model with some well-known alternative CAPMs such\nCAPM4) and the conditional CAPM of Jagannathan and Wang (1996) (henceforth,\nCCAPM). Using the same data as Fama and French (1992) and Jagannathan and\nWang (1996), it turns out that the SLCAPM explains --without any firm specific\nvariables such as firm-size, book-to-market equity and/or human labour-- over 60\npercent of the cross-sectional variation in average returns. This result is compared\nwith that of the BMCAPM, which explains (with two firm specific variables, firm-\nsize and book-to-market equity) 55.12 percent of the cross-sectional variation in\naverage returns and the CCAPM, which captures nearly 30 percent without firm\nspecific variables and 55.21 percent with one firm specific variable, human labour.\nAs the main result of this paper, it turns out that the stable long-run market Beta\ncontributes a substantial improvement in the empirical performance of the conven-\ntional CAPM and the SLCAPM still conforms to the original spirit of Markowitz\n2A brief overview of the -stable distribution is given in Section 2.2.\n3Letting Pt denote the price of an asset at time t and assuming no dividends, the return over\nperiod (t - 1, t] is typically modelled as rt = 100 \u00d7 log(Pt\n4This kind of modification is usually called a multifactor model in the literature.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present empirical\nevidence for -stable distributions in financial data and give a short summary of\n-stable distributions. We also examine the existence of long-run relationships in\nempirical financial data and discuss the compatibility of the long-run relationships\nand market efficiency. In Section 3, we introduce the SLCAPM. Estimation of\nthe short-run market Beta and the long-run market Beta as well as tests for the\nvalidity of the SLCAPM are discussed. Section 4 shows an empirical application of\nthe SLCAPM. In Section 5, using the cross-sectional regression method by Fama\nand MacBeth (1973) a substantial improvement in the empirical performance of the\nconventional CAPM through the SLCAPM is presented. Section 6 summarizes the\npaper and contains some concluding remarks.\n2 Empirical evidence\nIn this Section we examine the empirical properties of returns and asset prices\nand present evidence of fat-tails in returns and long-run relationships (common\nstochastic trends) in prices.\nIt is now well-known that most financial data (high-frequency data) have thicker\ntails in their density than those of the normal density. For a demonstration of\nthe phenomenon we take two data sets which we will use in our empirical analysis\nlater. One of them is the daily returns of the DAX from June 19, 1989 to June\n18, 1999, and the other monthly returns of the CRSP data. Figure 1 shows the daily\nstock prices, returns and the empirical density of the returns (solid line) compared\nwith the standard normal density (dotted line). The return process shows some\nvolatility clustering. In fact, the empirical density of the returns is excessively\npeaked around zero, and at the same time has thicker tails than those of the normal\ndensity. The conditional heteroscedasticity in Figure 1b results in the fat-tails in\nthe unconditional density in Figure 1c. Figure 2 shows the same results as Figure 1.\nSee, for more illustration and discussion on fat-tails in economic variables, Rachev,\n2.2 A short summary of -stable Distributions\n-stable distributions, as a generalization of the normal distribution, are described\nby four parameters (, b, , \u00b5) with   (0, 2], b  [-1, 1],   (0, ] and \u00b5 \n(-, ).5 The shape of the -stable distribution is determined completely by the\nstability (or tail-thickness) parameter , when b = 0. Skewness is governed by the\nskewness parameter, b, the symmetric case corresponding to b = 0. The scale and\nlocation parameter of the distributions are denoted by  and \u00b5. For  = 2, the\n-stable distribution reduces to the normal distribution with variance 22 and, for\n = 1 and b = 0, Cauchy distribution. For  < 2 all moments of order  or higher\nare infinite and tails become thicker, i.e., the magnitude and frequency of outliers\nincrease as  decreases. Thus, a stable distribution has no finite variance except\n = 2 (i.e., the normal distribution is the only member of the -stable family with\nfinite variance), and no finite mean when   1. Closed-form expressions of -\nstable distributions exist only for a few special cases.6 However, the logarithm of\nthe characteristic function of the -stable distribution can be written as\nln (t) =\n\n\n\n-|t|[1 - ib sign(t)tan\n] + i\u00b5t, for  = 1,\n-|t|[1 + ib\nsign(t) ln |t|] + i\u00b5t, for  = 1.\nAll probability density functions of stable distributions are continuous (Gnedenko\nsupport of all stable distributions is (-, ), except if  = 1 and b = \u00b11, where\ndetails on the -stable distributions see Zolotarev (1986) and Samorodnitsky and\nTaqqu (1994). It is worth noting that a strong argument in favour of the -stable\ndistribution for financial modelling over any other fat-tailed distributions such as\nt-distribution is that only the -stable distribution can serve as limiting distribution\nof sums of independent identically distributed random variables (Zolotarev, 1986).\nThe estimated stability parameter for the daily DAX in Figure 1 is 1.81, 1.84\nthe maximum-likelihood estimation (DuMouchel, 1973), the Hill estimation (Hill,\n2.3 Common stochastic trends\nTo check possible common trends in asset prices, we test for integration in each\nasset price, including DAX, and for co-integration in each univariate Beta model.\nFor the unit roots test, Dickey/Fuller test (Dickey and Fuller, 1979) and KPSS test\n(Kwiatkowski, Phillips, Schmidt and Shin, 1992) are applied, where the Dickey/Fuller\ntest assumes non-stationarity under the null, whereas the KPSS test stationarity.\nFor co-integration test, we apply the usual t-test, i.e. t-test of the loading coefficient\n5To avoid confusing with the market Beta, , of the CAPM, b denotes the skewness parameter\ninstead of the usually used .\n6The normal distribution ( = 2), Cauchy distribution ( = 1, b = 0) and L\u00b4\nevy distribution\n( = 0.5, b = 1) belong to the special cases.\nfor the co-integration residuals pre-estimated and the so-called tECM\n-test, considered\nThe first two columns of Table 1 show the result of tests for unit roots. The\nresults of tests for co-integration are summarized in the last two columns. None of\nthe 30 stock prices can be regarded as a stationary process by the two tests used.7\nThe two tests for co-integration show somewhat different results. About one-half\nof the individual series is co-integrated with DAX at 90% significant level by the\nt-test, while about two-thirds by the tECM\n-test. Note that in a dynamic setting the\n-test is a more powerful test than the usual t-test (see, for more details on this\ntopic, Kremers, Ericsson and Dolado, 1992). 7 assets are not co-integrated with\nDAX according to any of the tests. As the result shows, the empirical evidence for\nco-integration is, however, not very strong. A possible explanation is given: Shiller\nand Perron (1985) explore the power of unit root tests with respect to span and\nfrequency of observation, and conclude that the test power depends more on the\nspan of the data than on the number of observations. They also summarize that\nif the span is held fixed as the number of observations is increased, power tends\ntowards the size of test. This means that the high frequency data with a short span\n(this is the case for our empirical analysis, namely 252 observations during only one\nyear, which corresponds, for example, to 12 observations for monthly data) are not\nlong enough to detect a long-run relationship.\n2.4 The common stochastic trend and the efficient market\nhypothesis\nThe analysis of co-integration, introduced by Engle und Granger (1987) in financial\ndata, is not new, and there are many empirical works which report the existence of\nco-integrating relationships in financial data; see, for example, Corhay, Rad and Ur-\nbain (1993). According to the co-integration theory, many economic time series are\nnon-stationary (integrated), but a certain linear combination of them can be station-\nary, i.e., co-integrated. If more than two economic time series are co-integrated, one\ncan use this stationary property of the relation among the time series and perform a\nforecasting exercise with a finite forecast error. I.e., the existence of co-integration\ncan generally be interpreted as predictability, which is not compatible with the effi-\nSamuelson (1965) argues that, in an informationally efficient market, price changes\nmust be unpredictable if they fully incorporate the expectations and information\nof all market participants. Based on this idea, Fama (1970) develops the concept\nof market efficiency designated in the literature as EMH. The alleged inconsistency\n7The result remains unchanged when using the critical values taking non-normality into account\nbetween co-integration and EMH has been critically debated by many authors in\nrecent years. Three viewpoints on this issue are in order.\nThe first group of authors argues that the findings of co-integration in financial\nmarkets imply a violation of market efficiency. Baillie and Bollerslev (1989, 1994),\nfor example, find (fractional) co-integration in nominal dollar spot exchange rates\nand MacDonald and Power (1993) in monthly prices for the shares of 40 companies\nin the UK. Using the monthly averaged stock-price indexes of nine major industrial\ncountries, Masih and Masih (2001) find a causal transmission among the indexes in\nthe context of error-correction models. In a slightly different setting, Bollerslev and\nEngle (1993) analyze co-persistence in the conditional variance between more than\ntwo return processes, indicating a direct predictability of the conditional variance.\nThe authors in this group, therefore, believe in the predictability of financial data\nand ignore the EMH.\nThe second group of authors asserts the impossibility of co-integration in finan-\ncial market theoretically and/or shows no co-integration empirically. Based on the\nincompatibility between the predictability of co-integration and the unpredictability\nistence of co-integration relationships among the financial data. Granger (1992, p. 3)\nwrote that \"\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 then price changes would be consistently predictable, and so a money\nmachine is created and indefinite wealth is possible\". The argument of Granger is\nbased on the logic that co-integration is a causal relationship which contains at\nleast one exogenous variable and, hence, co-integration would necessarily imply pre-\ndictability. Diebold et al. (1994) find a contradictory result in comparison with that\nof Baillie and Bollerslev (1989), who used the same data and found evidence of\nco-integration.8 Based on a vector autoregressive error-correction model, Barkoulas\nand Baum (1997) present empirical evidence of no co-integration of foreign exchange\nmarkets.\nNote that the EMH must not only be defined by unpredictability, and that the\nexistence of co-integration must not necessarily imply predictability, either. The\nthird group of authors emphasizes, therefore, the consistency of the EMH and co-\nintegration. Fama (1991) argues that the predictability of stock returns from div-\nidend does not in itself yield evidence for or against market efficiency. Using the\nmoving-average representation of co-integrated variables, Dwyer and Wallace (1992)\ndemonstrate that co-integration in financial markets can be consistent with market\nefficiency, and argue that there is no general equivalence between market efficiency\nand co-integration, or a lack of co-integration. Engle (1996) also discusses pre-\ndictability in an efficient market, and concludes that co-integration has nothing to\ndo with EMH.\n8In a later paper of Baillie and Bollerslev (1994), this contradiction is resolved through the\nintroduction of fractional co-integration.\nWe likeweise claim that co-integration is compatible with EMH. Co-integration\ndoes not necessarily enable us to predict variables in a co-integrated model when\ndata\u00adgenerating processes of asset prices are driven by fundamentals. Regarding pre-\ndictability, Crowder (1994) emphasizes the role of exogeneity and causality in a co-\nintegrating relationship. Caporale and Pittis (1998) correctly argue that (given one-\ndirectional causality and exogeneity, which is usually assumed for a co-integrating\nrelationship) k variables can be predicted in an n-dimensional co-integrating sys-\ntem with k co-integrating relationships. When both the price of market portfolio\nPt\nand the price of an individual asset pt\nare driven by fundamentals which are\nnot specified in a co-integrating relationship, the direction of causality between Pt\nand pt\ncannot be observed in one direction, but maybe (detected by tests) partly\nin one direction and partly in the other. This is a very plausible scenario because\neach individual asset price is contained in the market price. Moreover, it is not\neasy in high-frequency data to distinguish cause from effect and vice versa. The\ncausal structure in this case will then be detected by the usual tests, as if they\nhave an instantaneous causality. We examine this kind of causality in the empirical\ndata using Geweke's measure (Geweke, 1982) of causality9, which is also adopted in\nBracker, Docking and Koch (1999), and the cross-correlation test of Hong (2001).\nThe result of Geweke's measure of causality for the DAX is summarized in Table\n2. The first column of Table 2 shows the causality of DAX to each individual asset.\nFew of them are significantly caused by the DAX. The second column shows the\ncausality of the reverse direction. Few individual assets are causal to the DAX,\n9This test is a likelihood-ratio test performing usually bivariate case, say x and y, assumes no\ncausality under the null, and causality of one variable to the other under the alternative. The\nlikelihood value, under the restriction 2\nu\n, come from the restricted model\np\nai\nxt-i + ut\n,\nand, under no restrictions, 2\ne\nresults from the unrestricted model\np\nai\nxt-i +\nq\nbj\nyt-j + et\n.\nThe test statistic is formulated as the likelihood ratio of the restricted and unrestricted variance\nLR = n ln(2\nu\ne\n), which is asymptotically 2(q)-distributed. For a large value of the likelihood\nratio, y is causal to x. If x and y in the equations above are rotated, one tests whether x is causal to\ny under the alternative hypothesis. In the framework of seemingly unrelated regression equations,\none can also detect instantaneous causality based on the likelihood-ratio statistic. For this case, the\nlikelihood value under restriction is the product of two 2\nu\ns resulting from two restricted models of x\nand y; and the determinant of the residual covariance matrix of the seemingly unrelated regression\nequations under no restriction. This residual covariance matrix is usually estimated with the\nfeasible generalized ordinary least squares method (Zellner, 1962), which reduces to ordinary least\nsquares under null hypothesis.\neither. The Granger-causality between DAX and its individual assets seems to be\nvery weak. The third column shows instantaneous causality. All individual assets\nare instantaneously causal to the DAX. This can be seen as empirical evidence of\nthe co-existence of common stochastic trends and market efficiency. For this case,\nco-integration does not imply the predictability of any variables in the system, al-\nthough the forecasting of the stationary equilibrium error with a finite forecasting\nerror is still possible. Stock and Watson (2001) examine empirical evidence of the\nforecasting ability of asset prices and conclude that some asset prices predict \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 in\nsome countries in some periods. Which series predicts what, when and where is,\nhowever, itself difficult to predict. Most empirical evidence, as summarized in Stock\nand Watson (2001), shows that \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 a significant Granger causality statistic contains\nlittle or no information about whether the indicator has been a reliable predictor. In\nline with that conclusion and the empirical evidence of Stock and Watson (2001), we\nconclude the co-existence of co-integration and MEH, because predictability does\nnot necessarily mean creating a money machine, as Granger (1992) worries.\n3 The stable long-run CAPM\nLet r denote the (excess) return on an asset and R be the return on the market\nportfolio of all assets in an economy. The Black version of the Sharpe/Lintner\nCAPM (Black, 1972) accounting for the absence of the risk-free asset is formulated10\nwhere  is defined as\n = Cov[r, R]/Var[R]. (2)\nThe fundamental, R, is usually specified as a benchmark portfolio for financial\nmarket analysis in practice. Based on the empirical evidence surveyed above, the\nconventional CAPM can be modified by the following assumptions.\nAssumption 1 The asset return r is symmetric -stable (S\nS) distributed with\nThe assumption 1 is a (stable) generalization of the traditional distributional as-\nsumption of normality on financial returns since Bachelier (1900). The restriction,\n  (1, 2], is needed because there exists no first moment when   1. This restric-\ntion, however, does not describe a real restriction for empirical financial analysis,\nbecause the stability parameters of most financial returns lie between 1.5 and 1.9.\n10For simplicity, the firm index is suppressed.\nThe restriction of symmetry (b = 0) is needed to avoid complications for estima-\ntions and tests of the ex-post SLCAPM. The following Lemma follows assumption\n1 immediately.\nLemma 1 The asset price, pt\n, follows a L\u00b4\nevy motion with an increment between t\nand s p(t) - p(s)  S(, 0, (t - s)1/, 0) for 0  s < t < .\nThe L\u00b4\nevy motion is also a (stable) generalization of Brownian motion, whose incre-\nments are normally distributed. For more details on properties of L\u00b4\nevy motion, see\nAssumption 2 Each pair of the two returns, rt\nand Rt\n, is bivariate symmetric\ndistributed.\nAssumption 2 implies that the two L\u00b4\nevy motions have the same . This means\nthat all assets in a benchmark, including the benchmark itself, must have the same\nstability parameter.11 Assumption 2 ensures the linearity of the relationship between\nexpected return and risk under assumption 1. See, for more details on the relation\nbetween symmetry and linearity, Theorem 4.1.2 in Samorodnitsky and Taqqu (1994,\np. 175). The next assumption concerns the relationships between asset prices.\nAssumption 3 For each pair of the two L\u00b4\nevy motions, pt\nand Pt\n, there exists a\nconstant c, so that the linear combination\npt\n- cPt\n zt\n,\nwhere zt\nis an -stable distributed stationary process.\nAssumption 3 means a stationary relationship between level variables, and, hence,\nimplies the explanatory power of the correction of the disequilibrium in level for the\nexpected return. Under assumption 3, equation 1 can be written as\nwhere s and l are defined as\ns = [r, R]\n/\nR\nand l = [p, P]\n/\nP\n11For a small sample, it is actually more or less restrictive. But there is no reason --either\neconomically or statistically-- why each asset has different 's just as all assets have the same\n. All assets in a benchmark are influenced by the same market events, so that `the same ' is\nmore possible. On the other hand, one can also argue that the firm-specific influence is stronger\nthan the general market trend, so that `the different ' is more possible. If two variables in the\nbivariate Beta model have different s, the statistical dealing of the bivariate SLCAPM is much\nmore complicated (but tractable).\nrespectively. Above, [r, R]\n([p, P]\n) is covariation of r and R (p and P), and R\n(P\n)\nis variation of R (P). Covariation (variation) is a stable generalization of the concept\nof covariance (variance) of the normally distributed random variables. See, for more\ndetails on covariation and variation, Samorodnitsky and Taqqu (1994, p. 87).\nThe ex-post version of the SLCAPM can also be written as an single-equation\nerror-correction form, in which an error-correction term takes account of the price\ninformation, i.e. the long-run covariance risk.\nrt\n= sRt\n+ \u00af\nb[p - lP]t-1\nwhere \u00af\nb is a loading coefficient for the so-called error-correction term of the long-\nrun equilibrium. This form is an extension of the conventional CAPM, which is\nconsistent with any arbitrary relation between the two prices in the framework of\na univariate Beta model. In contrast to the conventional CAPM, the SLCAPM\nis consistent with a certain relation between the two prices, namely a long-run\nequilibrium relationship when it exists. According to the SLCAPM, the risk of an\ninvestment is measured by both the usual (short-run) market Beta and the long-run\nmarket Beta, and the relations between expected return and the two market Betas\nare linear.\nThe theoretical background for the stable CAPM was originated by Samuelson\n(1967), who shows the existence of mean-variance (variation) efficiency under the\nnon-existence of second moment. This means that the Markowitz portfolio theory\nstill works under Assumption 1, namely -stable distributed returns. This provides\nthe SLCAPM with an economic foundation which is still based on the Markowitz\ntheory, namely the rule of expected returns and variance (variation) of returns. Sim-\nilarly to the CCAPM of Jagannathan and Wang (1996), the SLCAPM is, therefore,\na generalized form of the probability principle of mean-variance efficiency. This\nis a decidedly different aspect of the SLCAPM from some mostly used modified\nis performed by including firm-specific variables.\n3.2 Econometric Estimation and Test of the SLCAPM\nThe econometric models for estimating the two unknown market Betas in (3) are\ngiven as follows:\nrt\n= sRt\n+ us\nt\npt\n= lPt\n+ ul\nt\nwhere, in the framework of regression analysis, both Rt\n(Pt\n) and us\nt\n(ul\nt\n) are typically\nassumed to be independently -stably distributed.\nFor the estimation of the short- and long-run market Beta in (6) and (7), we\napply the best unbiased (BU) estimator of Blattberg and Sargent (1971). The BU-\nestimators for s and l in (6) and (7) are given as\nBU\n^\ns =\nT\n|Rt\n]rt\nT\n|Rt\n,\nBU\n^\nl =\nT\n|Pt\n]pt\nT\n|Pt\n,\nrespectively, for   (1, 2], which is equivalent to ordinary least squares (OLS),\nwhen  = 2. The asymptotic distribution of the BU-estimator is again a function\nof -stable random variables. See, for more details on the asymptotic analysis of\nthe BU-estimator, Kim and Rachev (1998). For the empirical application of the\nBU-estimator, the tail-thickness parameter  must be known. When  is unknown,\nsome estimates of  are usually substituted for the true .\nAlternatively, equation 7 can be estimated by the so-called fully-modified (FM)\nOLS method introduced by Phillips (1991).\nFM\n^\nl =\nT\nPt\nPt\np+\nt\nPt\n- ^\n+\n,\nwith\np+\nt\n= pt\n- ^\n^\nRt\n, ^\n+\n= ^\n- ^\n^\n^\n,\n^\n\n\nT\n^\nt\n^\nt\n+\nl\nw(l, s)\nT\n(^\nt-s\n^\nt\n+ ^\nt\n^\nt-s\n)\n\n =\n\n\n^\n^\n^\n^\n\n ,\n^\n\n\nT\n^\nt\n^\nt\n+\nl\nw(l, s)\nT\n^\nt-s\n^\nt\n\n =\n\n\n^\n^\n^\n^\n\n .\nAbove, ^\nt\n= [BU\n^\nul\nt\nRt\n] and w(\u00b7) is a weight function, which yields positive semi-\ndefinite estimates, where l is a lag-truncation parameter. The FM-estimator is\ndesigned originally for normally distributed (co-)integrated variables, but the semi-\nparametric correction of endogeneity of the exogeneous variable,12 and serial corre-\nlation in the residuals still works for errors with infinite\u00advariance.\nTesting the null hypothesis of the conventional CAPM against the alternative of\nthe SLCAPM is of interest, namely:\n: CAPM vs H1\n12Actually, the assumption of independence between Rt(Pt) and us\nt\n(ul\nt\n) barely holds in the\nex-post version of CAPM because of the construction of a benchmark portfolio. Note that, by\nits construction, a benchmark portfolio contains the residual process, including the endogenous\nvariable, in the framework of the univariate Beta model.\nEquivalently, an appealing test of whether the data are consistent with the SLCAPM\ncan be performed simply by the usual t-test (called tECM\nin Kremers, Ericsson and\nDolado, 1992) on the loading coefficient in (5) as:\n: \u00af\n: \u00af\nKim (2000) provides finite-sample distributions for the t-statistic.\n4 An empirical application\nFor our empirical work, we use the daily DAX and its 30 assets from the Karls-\nobservations), where the composition of the DAX was not changed.\nA pre-test needed for estimating a SLCAPM is the checking symmetry (Assump-\ntion 2) of each pair in the bivariate SLCAPM, which ensures the linearity of the\nregressions in (6) and (7). This can be done by the test of bivariate symmetry of\nsults of the test of bivariate symmetry are reported in Table 3. The null hypothesis\n13The test procedure is based on the tail estimators of the spectral measure. It is assumed that\n, X2t], t = 1, . . . , n, are two-dimensional, mutually independent -stable random vectors\ni.

The result shows that evidence of bivariate symmetry is strong enough for\nthe univariate Beta, which is assumed to be a linear relation between the returns of\nindividual assets and the benchmark portfolio in the SLCAPM.\nThe estimates of the short- and long-run Betas are reported in Table 4. The first\ncolumn of Table 4 shows the average returns and the second the Beta-coefficient in\nthe conventional CAPM in (2), while the third and the fourth show the estimated\nshort- and long-run market Beta for the SLCAPM in (4). The differences between\nthe two estimates of the Beta in the conventional CAPM and of the short-run Beta\nin the SLCAPM are moderate for most regressions. The long-run Beta-coefficient\nshow how large the normalized covariance between an asset price and the price of\nthe market portfolio may be. The high positive l (greater than one) means an over-\nproportional development of the price level of an asset in comparison with the market\nprice. The low l means that the price of an asset develops under-proportionally in\ncomparison with the market price, or partly in an opposite direction to the market\nprice in the long run. If one takes information on the Beta-coefficient from the\nconventional CAPM (in the second column of Table 4), Bayer (0.71) has almost the\nlike the DAX, while Preussag has gained from 3.53 to 3.93 in the same period. Bayer\nhas a large long-run Beta (1.17), but Preussag a small one (0.62). What is discussed\nabove is summarized in Figure 3. Figure 3 shows three asset prices, compared with\nthe DAX, of which the first one (SAP) has a high l (1.55), the second one (Hoechst)\na moderate l (0.97), and the last one (Preussag) has a low l (0.62).14 In the period\nRi\nshows the highest positive correlation with the DAX in the long run, namely 1.55,\nri\n= -0.44).

The Preussag, however,\nri\nThis is also the case for the Deutsche Telekom.\nDecisions on an investment based on the SLCAPM look similar to those based\non the conventional CAPM. One advantage is that one can use --besides the usual\nmarket Beta-- stable long-run information additionally. To sum up, the decision\nrule based on the SLCAPM can be summarized as follow: for a short-run investment,\nthe conventional rule is still valid, namely, when s = 1.0, the return tends to mirror\nFrom the functional limit theorem for n, one can easily verify that ^\nn follows asymptotically\na standard normal distribution. Assuming sufficiently large values of n and k, we reject the\nnull hypothesis of bivariate symmetry at significance level , when n\n> z/2, where z/2 is the\n100(1 - /2) percentile of the standard normal distribution.\n14For a better comparison, a level-shift for the illustration is performed.\nthe return on the market; when s > (<)1.0, the return tends to be greater (smaller)\nthan the return on the market. For a long-run investment, however, the long-run\nrisk factor plays an important role: when l > 1(< 1), the return tends to be\npositive (negative) for the case of increasing market price, and vice versa. Actually,\none can obtain information on both the risk factors from the SLCAPM.\n5 Empirical Performance\nIn this Section, using the cross-sectional regression of Fama and MacBeth (1973),\nwe perform a test to check the empirical performance of the SLCAPM. For doing\nthis, we use the same data used in Jagannathan and Wang (1996), i.e., the stock\ndata of nonfinancial firms listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and\nthe American Stock Exchange (AMEX) covered by the Center for Research in Se-\ncurity Prices (CRSP) alone. Jagannathan and Wang (1996) create 100 portfolios\nof NYSE and AMEX stocks, as in Fama and French (1992), which we also use.15\nThis is a time series of monthly returns for the period July 1963 to December 1990\n(330 observations). Using the same data ensures a powerful comparison among the\nmodels.\nIn the last few decades, many works have reported the lack of empirical support\nfor the conventional CAPM and, at the same time, many modifications have been\nstudied to improve the empirical performance of the CAPM. Fama and French (1992)\nempirically tested the following regression model, considered in Fama and MacBeth\nE[ri\ni\nwhere E[ri\n] is the expected return on the asset i, i\nthe corresponding market Beta\ndenote the expected return on a zero-beta and the market-risk pre-\nmium, respectively. In empirical tests E[ri\n] is usually replaced by the mean value\nof the observed returns. In a widely-cited paper of Fama and French (1992), the\npoor relationship between market Beta and average return is reported. They show\nthat the 1\nis insignificantly different from zero and the correlation coefficient, R2,\nis very low (1.35%). That is to say, the relation between market Beta and average\nextend the (unconditional) conventional CAPM to a conditional CAPM, relaxing\nthe assumption of constant Beta, and show, using the same data in Fama and French\n15See Jagannathan and Wang (1996) for details on creating the data set. I thank Prof. Wang\nfor kindly sending the data to me. They can now be obtained via the Internet, http://www.gsb.\ncolumbia.edu/faculty/zwang/exchange.\nWe now empirically test the SLCAPM as follows:\nE[ri\ns\ni\nl\ni\nis the long-run risk premium and s\ni\nand l\ni\nare the short- and long-run\nBeta for i-th asset. The results of bivariate symmetry tests and the estimated\nshort- and long-run Betas are given in Tables 5 and 6, respectively, where, in the\nfirst block of Table 6, the average returns are reported. For estimating the short-run\nBetas, the BU-estimation and the long-run Betas, both the BU- and FM-estimations\nare applied. Next, based on the cross-sectional regression, we test the empirical\nperformance of the SLCAPM. This can be done by regressing the estimated short-\nand long-run market Betas on the average returns as estimates of the unobservable\nexpected returns given in the first block of Table 6. The cross-sectional regression\nfor the SLCAPM is then given as\n\u00af\n^\n^\nl + ,\nwhere \u00af\nr = [\u00af\n, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u00af\nrN\n], with \u00af\nri\nrit\n, ^\ns = [^\ns\n, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , ^\ns\nN\n] and ^\nl = [^\nl\n, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , ^\nl\nN\n].\nFigure 4 illustrates a set of sequential correlation coefficients, i.e., the sample\nsequentially for each time length. Figure 4 shows the following:\n- The correlation coefficient of the SLCAPM for the full sample is 60.90 %,\nwhereas that of the conventional CAPM is 1.35 %, as reported in Jagannathan\n- The average correlation coefficient for the SLCAPM is 63.25 %, with a standard\ndeviation of 7.99 %, whereas that of the conventional CAPM is 17.04 % with a\nstandard deviation of 10.36 %. The highest (lowest) correlation coefficient for\n- One comment on the empirical result in Fama and French (1992): the empirical\nperformance of the conventional CAPM is surely not persuasive, but it should\nbe noticed that the empirical result in Fama and French (1992) is the second\nworst (lowest) correlation coefficient from the entire 200 sequential samples.\nThe result from the sequential correlation coefficient of the SLCAPM seems to be\npromising for applying the SLCAPM to empirical work. Since the SLCAPM is\nbased on the economic foundation, like the Sharpe/Lintner-CAPM without any\nfirm specific variable, the result also means that the mean-variance efficiency is still\nvalid as an economic hypothesis, describing the behaviour of investors in financial\nmarkets. Lastly, we compare the empirical performance of the SLCAPM with that\nof the recently published two modified CAPMs. The first one is the BMCAPM by\nFama (1992, 1996), which contains two firm-specific variables, firm-size and book-\nto-market equity. The other is the CCAPM by Jagannathan and Wang (1996).\nTable 7 shows the comparison. The first row of Table 7 shows the result for the\nconventional CAPM, as also given in Fama and French (1992) and Jagannathan and\nWang (1996). The coefficient for the (usual) market Beta is insignificant, and R2 is\nvery low (1.35%). That is to say, the conventional CAPM can be rejected for the\nunderlying data. The BMCAPM explains --with two firm-specific variables, firm-\nsize and book-to-market equity-- 55.12% of the cross-sectional variation in average\nreturns and the CCAPM, which captures nearly 30% without firm-specific variables\nand 55.21% with one firm-specific variable, human labour. The SLCAPM improves\nR2 slightly more than the two, namely to 60.90%, based on the BU-estimation, and\n68.17%, based on the FM-estimation, and all three coefficients are significant for the\nFM-estimates.\n6 Conclusion\nIn this paper we examined a possible modification of the conventional CAPM. Two\nrestrictive assumptions of the conventional CAPM, under which the relation between\naverage return and Beta is very weak, namely normality of returns and single-period\nstatic property, are generalized to the -stable Paretianity of returns and the long-\nrun (dynamic) setting. With an empirical application, we demonstrated that the\naverage returns are highly correlated with the long-run information that can be\ncaptured by the SLCAPM. Furthermore, it turned out that the SLCAPM improves\nthe empirical performance of the CAPM, and still corresponds to the Markowitz\nportfolio theory, mean-variance rule, and, hence, demonstrates that the CAPM is\nMore recently, Lettau and Ludvigson (1999) empirically test a conditional version\nof the consumption CAPM with consumption-wealth ratio as a conditioning variable\nand find a substantial improvement in the performance of the CAPM.17 It would also\nbe interesting to consider for future research --in line with the work of Jagannathan\nand Wang (1996)-- a conditional stable long-run CAPM, taking the time-varying\nproperty of the market Beta into account.\n16This is the title of an earlier version of the paper of Jagannathan and Wang (1996), as a\nlight-hearted answer to the title of a paper by Fama and French (1996), \"The CAPM is wanted,\ndead or alive\".\n17With a different data set, the conditional version of the consumption CAPM presents a high\nReferences\neorie de la sp\u00b4\neculation, Gauthier-Villars, Paris.
