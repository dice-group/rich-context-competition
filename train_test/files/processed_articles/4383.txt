ACE is a\ndipeptidyl carboxypeptidase that removes the C-terminal\ndipeptide from angiotensin I to produce the potent vasocon-\nstrictor and growth-promoting substance angiotensin I/I.\nThe ACE gene is mapped on chromosome 17q23 encoded\n287 bp Alu repeat sequence in introns 16 of the ACE gene\nis strongly associated with plasma and cellular ACE levels,\nand it indicates that the polymorphism may modulate the\nexpression of the ACE gene.7 Several studies have reported\nAssociation of angiotensin-converting\nenzyme (ACE) and fatty acid binding\nprotein 2 (FABP2) genes polymorphism with\ntype 2 diabetes mellitus in Northern India\nSyed Tasleem Raza1, Jalees Fatima2, Faisal Ahmed1, Shania\nAbbas1, Zeashan Haider Zaidi3, Seema Singh4 and Farzana Mahdi1\n Keywords\nACE, FABP2, genetic polymorphism, genetic susceptibility,T2DM\nDepartment of Biochemistry, Era's Lucknow Medical College and\nHospital, India\nDepartment of Medicine, Era's Lucknow Medical College and Hospital,\nIndia\nDepartment of Statistics, Era's Lucknow Medical College and Hospital,\nIndia\nDepartment of Physiology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Integral\nUniversity Lucknow, India\nCorresponding author:\nSyed Tasleem Raza, Department of Biochemistry, Era's Lucknow\nEmail: tasleem24@gmail.com\nOriginal Article\nthe involvement of the D allele of the ACE gene in hyper-\ntension and T2DM in various populations.8\u00ad10 In a study\ncarried out on South Indian diabetic nephropathy patients,\na significantly high frequency (80.2%) of the D allele was\nreported compared to T2DM cases with normal urine albu-\nmin.11 The I/I, I/D and D/D genotypes resulting from the\npolymorphic site of the ACE gene have been shown to have\nlow, intermediate and high plasma expression, respectively.\nWith that, the I/I genotype has been thought to confer pro-\ntective benefits while the D/D genotype is believed to con-\nfer deleterious effects on various disease pathogenetic\nmechanisms, particularly diabetic nephropathy.12 In addi-\ntion, characterization of the ACE I/D gene polymorphism\nhas also been suggested for decision making regarding anti-\nhypertensive treatment regimens.13\nFatty acid binding protein 2 (FABP2) genes play a key\nrole in the absorption and intracellular transport of dietary\nlong chain fatty acids. The gene for FABP2 is located in the\nlong arm of chromosome 4. The G to A polymorphism\nnine (Thr) for alanine (Ala).14 Carriers of the Thr54 allele in\nFABP2 have a twofold greater affinity for the absorption of\nthe long-chain fatty acids than those with the Ala54-\ncontaining FABP2.15 The associations between the FABP2\nAla54Thr polymorphism and increased fasting insulin (FI)\nconcentration, fasting fatty acid oxidation and reduced glu-\ncose uptake were identified in Pima Indians, an extreme\npopulation with high prevalence rates of obesity and\nallele is significantly associated with higher total choles-\nterol, with stroke incidence,16 elevation of fasting and post-\nnonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentrations.19 Currently,\nadequate data are not available regarding ACE I and FABP2\ngenes polymorphism and its susceptibility with T2DM\ncases in the North Indian population. Thus we conceived\nthe need for further study of ACE (I/D) and FABP2\n(Ala54Thr) gene polymorphisms and their susceptibility to\nT2DM in the North Indian population.\nMaterials and methods\nPatient selection\nhealthy controls were collected from the diabetic clinic of\nthe Department of Medicine of Era's Lucknow Medical\nCollege and Hospital, Lucknow with prior consent. Data\ncollection was done for each patient on clinical variables,\nincluding age, alcohol consumption, body mass index\n(BMI), height, weight, cigarette smoking, family history,\netc. Patients with overnight fasting plasma glucose (FPG)\nof more than 126 mg/dl on two consecutive events were\nincluded in the T2DM category while samples having a\nfasting blood glucose (FBG) level below 110 mg/dl without\nfamily history of diabetes were included in the study as\ncontrols. Patients with type 1 presentation, defined as dia-\nbetic ketoacidosis, acute presentation with heavy ketonuria\n(>3+), or uninterrupted requirement of insulin within one\nyear of diagnosis, were excluded. Ethical committee clear-\nances were obtained from the respective departments prior\nto the recruitment of subjects in this study.\nBiochemical estimations\nBMI was calculated according to the Quetelet equation by\nusing weight in kilograms/height in meters squared. Serum\ncreatinine (s. creat.) concentration was assessed by a kinetic\nJaffe's method. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and random\nblood glucose (RBG) (glucose oxidase-peroxidase method),\nserum cholesterol (cholesterol oxidase-peroxidase), serum\nTG (glycerol phosphate oxidase-peroxidase-amidopyrine\nmethod), High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol\n(immunoinhibition) were assessed by an XL-300 Transasia\nFully Auto Analyzer Transasia, Mannheim, Germany. Very\nlow-density lipoprotein was determined by enzymatic\nmethod. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels\nwere calculated by using the Friedewald formula.20\nHemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) was measured using a semiau-\ntoanalyzer (Transasia, Mannheim, Germany).\nDNA extraction\nFive milliliters of peripheral blood was collected from all\nthe subjects in 0.5 M ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid\n(EDTA) tubes. Genomic DNA was isolated from whole\nblood using the standard phenol-chloroform extraction\nmethod.21 DNA concentration was determined by spectro-\nphotometer and stored at -20\u00b0C.\nAnalysis of polymorphisms\nACE polymorphism\nPolymerase chain reaction (PCR) was employed for\ngenotyping of the ACE I/D polymorphism. Reactions\nwere performed with 10 pmol of each primer:22 forward\n2U Taq polymerase. PCR amplification was carried out\nunder these conditions: initial denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 5\nminutes, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for\nminutes. PCR products were separated on 2.0% ethidium\nbromide-stained agarose gel and visualized by a UVP\nBIOLMAGING gel doc system. The products were 490 bp\nfor allele I and 190 bp for allele D (Figure 1).\n574 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 15(4)\nFABP2 polymorphism\nPCR was employed for genotyping of the FABP2 gene pol-\nymorphism.

PCR amplification was carried out under\nat 5\u00b0C and 1 minute at 72\u00b0C; the PCR products were ana-\nlyzed on 2% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide to\ncertify the proper amplification. The amplified PCR prod-\nucts of 180 bp were digested with the addition of 2 U HhaI\nand 1 mmol/l dithiothrei-\ntol. After incubation at 37\u00b0C for two hours, digested sam-\nples were separated on 10% ethidium bromide-stained\npolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by a\nUVP BIOLMAGING gel doc system.

On analyzing the ACE gene poly-\nmorphisms in cases and controls, the I/I genotype was\nsignificantly more frequent in cases as compared to con-\nFABP2 polymorphism\nThe FABP2 gene has been proposed as a candidate gene\nfor diabetes and insulin resistance because the protein it\nencodes is involved in fatty acid absorption and metabo-\nlism.18 Numerous studies have assessed FABP2 gene var-\niants and their association with insulin resistance and\nT2DM. The most studied variant is the Ala54Thr varia-\ntion at codon 54, a missense variant that has a definite\neffect on the primary structure of the protein and affects\nits fatty acid binding properties. Previous studies have\nfound a significant association between the FABP2 geno-\ntype and occurrence of T2DM or decreased insulin\nsensitivity.14 Several studies have reported associations\nbetween this polymorphism and insulin resistance, BMI,\ndyslipidemia, stroke, metabolic syndromes and hypertri-\nserum TGs and higher BMI in Thr54 homozygotes in\nagreement with the earlier studies of Carlsson et al.,16\nwho demonstrated similar elevations of TG levels in the\nthe Ala54Thr variant was extensively associated with\nhypertriglyceridemia.36 Previous studies have failed to\nestablish ascertainable associations between the FABP2\ngene and T2DM in Asian Indians.11 The frequency of\nFABP2 Ala54Thr polymorphism described in other popu-\nlations fluctuates between 37% and 45% (Table 3) as in\nwhich is similar to the frequency of the Thr54Thr geno-\npopulations.
