Such an analysis of\nthese data could supplement current knowledge re-\ngarding whether the US folic acid fortification program\nhas modified national plasma tHcy concentrations.\nMETHODS: We examined tHcy data in the prefortifica-\nequations to the survey data based on method compar-\nison studies of separate samples. Persons with chronic\nkidney disease were excluded from the analyses.\nRESULTS: Mean plasma tHcy concentrations decreased\nby 8%, 9%, and 10% for adolescent, adult, and older\nmen and by 6%, 3%, and 13% for women, respectively,\nfrom before to after fortification. Concentrations re-\nmained unchanged between the first and third postfor-\ntification survey periods. Prevalence estimates of in-\ncreased plasma tHcy concentrations (13 mol/L) for\nolder men and women decreased from prefortification\nand 5%, respectively) but remained unchanged there-\nafter (16% and 14%, respectively [males] and 5% and\n9%, respectively [females]).\nCONCLUSIONS: After adjusting for method changes, we\nquantified a prefortification to postfortification de-\ncrease in circulating tHcy concentrations of about 10%\nin a national sample of the US population.

Decreases in tHcy concentrations were reported\nin the Framingham (12) and Chilean populations (15)\nafter introduction of folate fortification in the US and\nin Chile.\nThe   Examination\nSurvey (NHANES) began to monitor tHcy concen-\ntrations in the US population in 1991.

We describe the method\nadjustments necessary to allow comparison of tHcy\ndata across time, and we provide an account of changes\nin tHcy concentrations in the US population over the\nStudy Participants and Methods\nNHANES constitutes a series of periodic nationally\nrepresentative cross-sectional probability surveys of\nthe noninstitutionalized civilian US population. Con-\nducted by the National Center for Health Statistics at\nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,\nNHANES obtains a stratified, multistage, probability\nsample designed to represent the US population based\non age, sex, and race-ethnicity (24). During each sur-\nvey period, certain subpopulations are oversampled to\nallow for more precise estimates. Race-ethnicity cate-\ngories [non-Hispanic white (NHW), non-Hispanic\nblack (NHB), and Mexican-American (MA)] are based\non self-reported data (25). All respondents gave their\ninformed consent, and the NHANES protocol for each\nsurvey period was reviewed and approved by the Na-\ntional Center for Health Statistics Institutional Review\nBoard.\nMethods for determining tHcy concentrations changed\nacross the 4 survey periods (see Supplemental Table 1 in\ntheDataSupplementthataccompaniestheonlineversion\nof this article at http://www.clinchem.org/content/vol54/\nissue5). Because optimally prepared EDTA plasma was\nnot available during NHANES III, tHcy concentrations\nwere analyzed by HPLC in surplus serum from phase II\nAgriculture (USDA) Human Nutrition Research Center\non Aging (26). Whole blood was allowed to clot for\n30\u00ad60 min before centrifugation and removal of serum.\nwithin 30 min of collection to avoid an artificial increase\nin tHcy from continuous production in, and release\nfrom erythrocytes. Plasma tHcy was analyzed at the CDC\nNutrition Laboratory using a commercial fluorescence\npolarization immunoassay reagent set (Abbott Labora-\n(27),thenontheAbbottAxSYM\u00aeanalyzer(samereagent\nwere 3%\u00ad5% for both Abbott platforms during\nWe adjusted all tHcy data forward to the Abbott\nAxSYM\u00ae because that method was used for the longest\ntime period in NHANES and is the most widely used\nmethod in clinical laboratories. Owing to error in both\nanalytical methods, we performed method adjust-\nments by Deming regression analysis using Analyze-it,\na statistical plug-in for Microsoft Excel (Analyze-it\nSoftware), after log-transforming the data to account\nfor nongaussian distributions.\nBecause a different specimen matrix was used for\nNHANES III and no direct method comparison data\nwere available between the USDA HPLC and the Ab-\nbott AxSYM method, we adjusted tHcy data from\nNHANES III in 3 stages: USDA HPLC serum to USDA\nHPLC plasma; USDA HPLC plasma to CDC HPLC\nplasma; and CDC HPLC plasma to AxSYM\u00ae plasma.\nThe first 2 adjustments were based on data from an\nearlier report (23) in which USDA and CDC laborato-\nries performed a method comparison of their 2 HPLC\nassays (26, 29) to determine the magnitude of differ-\nences in tHcy concentrations between plasma and se-\nrum. Blood specimens from 30 donors were separated\ninto EDTA plasma (optimal processing) and serum\n(delayed processing) (23). For the serum-to-plasma\ndata adjustment, we used the USDA data for serum\nafter allowing the blood to clot for 60 min (n  30). For\nthe USDA HPLC plasma\u00adto\u00adCDC HPLC plasma data\nadjustment, we used the entire sample set (n  150).\nFinally, the CDC HPLC\u00adto\u00adAxSYM conversion was\nbased on a set of plasma samples that were measured as\npart of NHANES with these 2 methods and the IMx\nmethod (n  361). Therefore, the data from this sam-\nple set were also used to compare the 2 Abbott\nplatforms.\nStatistical analyses on method adjusted tHcy data were\nperformed using SAS (version 9, SAS Institute) and\nSUDAAN (version 9, RTI) software using sample\nweights to account for differences in nonresponse or\nnoncoverage and to adjust for planned oversampling of\nsome groups (24). The 95% CIs for all survey periods\nwere estimated with SUDAAN software by using Tay-\nlor series linearization, a method that incorporates the\nsample weights and accounts for the sample design. We\nused 3 age strata in our data analyses: 12\u00ad19 years (ad-\npersons).\nBecause impaired renal function has an apprecia-\nble influence on plasma tHcy concentrations (30), data\nwere excluded from analyses for all participants with\nwhom insufficient information was available to deter-\nsons, respectively). We followed the recommendations\nof the National Kidney Disease Education Program to\nestimate glomerular filtration rate as the best overall\nindex of kidney function (31, 32) and used the Na-\ntional Kidney Foundation classification system to de-\ntermine stages of CKD (33)(see Supplemental Text 1 in\nthe online Data Supplement).\nWe generated frequency distribution curves for\nthe entire population and for older persons for each\nsurvey period. Medians or geometric means (log10\n-\ntransformed data) were evaluated owing to the skew-\nness of the distribution curves. Prevalence estimates for\nindividuals with increased tHcy concentrations (13\nmol/L) (12, 15) and individuals with desirable tHcy\nconcentrations (9 mol/L) (34) were determined for\neach survey period.\nUsing an ANOVA model that included age (3 age\ngroups), sex (male or female), racial-ethnic group\n(NHW, NHB, MA, or other), and survey period (1991\u00ad\nfound significant (P  0.05) age  survey period and\nsex  survey period interactions. To assess whether\ncirculating tHcy concentrations (geometric means) or\nprevalence estimates changed between consecutive\nwhether prevalence estimates of increased or desirable\ntHcy values were significantly different between the 3\nyears compared with 12\u00ad19 years), we performed pair-\nwise comparisons using 2-tailed, 2-group t tests on age-\nand sex-specific subgroups. We considered the P value\nof each comparison significant if it was 0.017 (Bon-\nferroni multiple comparison adjustment, 0.05 divided\nby 3, the total number of comparisons). We deter-\nmined selected population percentile values (5th, 50th,\nand 95th) for tHcy for the prefortification period\nsidered to produce imprecise estimates of the 5th and\nResults\nUSDA HPLC plasma results (n  30) were on average\n9% lower than their serum results, with a constant rel-\native difference across all concentrations; all predicted\nplasma results were within 15% of the measured results\n(Table 1 and Supplemental Fig. 1A in the online Data\nSupplement for Deming regression plot). CDC HPLC\nplasma results (n  150) were on average 6% higher\nthan USDA HPLC plasma results. However, the rela-\ntive difference varied with tHcy concentration (8% and\n12% at the median and at the 13 mol/L cutoff value,\nrespectively). Because 97% of all predicted CDC HPLC\nresults were within 20% of the measured results, the\nmethod adjustment equation appeared to correct for\nthis concentration-dependent difference (Table 1 and\nSupplemental Fig. 1B in the online Data Supplement).\nAxSYM results (n  361) were on average 1% higher\nthan CDC HPLC results; 99.7% of all predicted AxSYM\nresults were within 20% of the measured results (Table\n1 and Supplemental Fig. 1C in the online Data Supple-\nment). Finally, AxSYM results (n  361) were on aver-\nage 6% higher than IMx results, with a constant relative\ndifference across all concentrations; 99% of all pre-\ndicted AxSYM results were within 20% of the measured\nresults (Table 1 and Supplemental Fig. 1D in the online\nData Supplement).\nTrends in Homocysteine Concentrations in the US\n22% of older persons were classified as having CKD (all\nstages). During the 3 postfortification survey periods,\n31%, respectively, of older persons were classified as\nhaving CKD. Exclusion of persons with CKD had a\nnoticeable impact on the frequency distribution curves\n(Fig. 1) and on the prevalence estimates of increased\nplasma tHcy concentrations, especially for older per-\nsons (approximately 10 percentage points lower prev-\nalence estimates for increased tHcy concentrations).\nFrequency distributions after excluding persons with\nCKD from the entire population and from older per-\nsons for each of the 4 survey periods illustrate how the\ndistribution in circulating tHcy concentrations\nchanged over time (Fig. 2). The width of the distribu-\ntion curve narrowed from before to after fortification,\nand the long upper tail disappeared almost entirely.\nwere almost entirely overlapping.\nBecause of the age  survey period and the sex  sur-\nvey period interactions, we present median concentra-\ntions of plasma tHcy and time trend analysis for age-\nand sex-specific subgroups in the 4 survey periods (Ta-\ncentrations of plasma tHcy decreased significantly in\nevery sex-age subgroup after the introduction of folate\nans, corresponding 3%\u00ad13% decreases). These pre- to\npostfortification decreases were largest for older per-\n(13%) for older women. When stratified further by\nrace-ethnicity, concentrations of plasma tHcy de-\ncreased significantly in most subgroups except for ad-\n0.0763, respectively). We found similar decreases based\non geometric means as reported here for medians.\nThere were no significant changes in tHcy concentra-\ntions across the 3 postfortification survey periods.\nAmong the 3 age groups, the prevalence of increased\nplasma tHcy concentrations (13 mol/L) was always\nhigher in older persons compared to the other 2 age\ngroups, both prefortification (approximately 20%\u00ad\nadults, and 10% in adolescents) and postfortification\n(approximately 5%\u00ad15% in older persons vs approxi-\nmately 3%\u00ad7% in adults, and 3% in adolescents)\n(Table 3).

Until\nnow, however, tHcy data could not be compared across\nsurvey periods because of changes in analytical meth-\nods and specimen matrices. We derived method ad-\njustment equations to allow for time trend analysis.\nThis process had several strengths: (a) sample sizes for\nmethod comparisons were of sufficient size, except the\nEDTA plasma-to-serum comparison; (b) all 3 method\ncomparisons spanned the reference interval of tHcy\nconcentrations; (c) each comparison was conducted\nover a period of several days to capture the interrun\nvariability; (d) the small adjustment between the Ab-\nbott IMx and AxSYM platforms was consistent with a\nFig. 1.

However, our findings\nthat serum samples had approximately 10% higher\ntHcy concentrations than optimally prepared plasma\nsamples correspond well with previous findings (37),\nindicating that this source of bias was properly ad-\njusted. Another limitation is the uncertainty generated\nin the 3-stage adjustment on the prefortification data\nto make it comparable to postfortification data. The\ncalculated propagated error for the 3-stage adjust-\nment, as computed from the r2, is 9%, small enough to\nallow the detection of a decrease in tHcy concentra-\ntions between pre- and postfortification. Because the 3\nmethod regression conversions increase the impreci-\nsuch imprecision would reduce the statistical power to\ndetect differences (toward the null) between the survey\nperiods.\nExcluding persons with CKD was an important\nstep in limiting our data analysis to the healthy US\npopulation.
