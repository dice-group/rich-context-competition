    "abstract": "Abstract\nGender bias continues to play a role in the gender discrepancy at executive levels in organizations across the United States,\nalthough women hold 51% of all middle management positions. Female middle managers may be overlooked for advancement\nto executive positions because of a lack of synergy between individual career planning and organizational development and\nadvancement practices. This may have significant implications for organizations as they struggle to recruit and hire qualified\nsenior leadership to close the widening leadership gap created as baby boomers leave the workforce in record numbers over\nthe next decade. One way to retain talented, knowledgeable, female middle managers is to incorporate career planning and\nadvancement programs, which increase visibility for both the individual and organizational leaders into potential advancement\nopportunities. This descriptive phenomenological study was designed to investigate and describe the lived experiences of\nfemale executives with career planning and advancement in organizations. Data collected from 16 female executives employed\nin organizations in Nashville, Tennessee, revealed that although individuals must make a commitment to career planning and\ntake responsibility for executing the plan, successful career planning and advancement are dependent on others beyond the\nindividual seeking advancement. The findings of this study are important for women who desire advancement to executive\nlevels and to organizational leaders who want to hire and promote the right person for the job regardless of gender.\n",

Career planning was defined\nas the action taken to access individual values, desires, goals,\ninterests, and career aspirations. Career planning also encom-\npasses evaluating opportunities; setting career goals; engag-\ning in purposeful networking; hiring a career coach; obtaining\ncareer counseling; identifying and taking advantage of edu-\ncational and developmental opportunities; and actively seek-\ning the advice and guidance of trusted peers, managers, and\nsubject matter experts (Dagley & Salter, 2004; McGrath,\nWomen in organizations often face obstacles in obtaining\nmentors, especially female mentors who may have better\ninsights into the challenges women face in achieving\nstudy conducted by Raggins and Cotton (1991) found that\nwomen had restricted access to mentors and reported a lack\nof availability and willingness of male leaders to engage in a\nmentoring relationship with females.

Insights\ngained from engaging in career planning with employees\nmay also help organizations develop and implement pro-\ngrams, policies, and procedures that more adequately pro-\nmote gender equality in recruiting, hiring, promotion, and\nsuccession planning practices (Levanon & Cheng, 2011;\nCreating a partnership between motivated female employ-\nees and organizational leaders by implementing a compre-\nhensive career planning element in the talent management\nsystem may be effective in mitigating the loss of female tal-\nent in organizations.

Increasing\nemployee retention rates and promoting from within saves\norganizations millions of dollars in costs associated with\nhigh employee turnover (Benko & Weisberg, 2007).\nResearch Question\nThis study was organized around one central question and\nsix sub-questions. The central research question was as fol-\nlows: What are female executives' perceptions of experi-\nences with career planning and advancement in\norganizations?\nTheoretical Framework\nThe theoretical framework for this study provides a founda-\ntion for understanding the obstacles to the advancement of\nwomen in organizations in the United States and includes the\ntheory of cascading gender bias (Warren, 2009), the double-\nbind dilemma (Catalyst, 2007), and the unwritten rules of\nadvancement (Sabattini, 2008). Each of these theories\ndescribes implications of gender bias for perceptions of\nwomen as leaders and the influence of gender stereotypes on\nthe advancement of women in organizations. These studies\naddress the hurdles women face as they pursue advancement\nin organizations and provided the theoretical underpinning\nfor this study.\nCascading Gender Bias\nThe theory of cascading gender bias identified potential for\nleadership bias to influence organizational human resource\nmanagement system. Warren (2009) described the double-\nbind dilemma and the unwritten rules to advancement as side\neffects of gender bias, which can prevent women from\nadvancing to the executive suite. Warren identified three\nmajor contributors to gender bias in talent management sys-\ntems: senior leadership effect, institutionalizing bias, and\ncompounding bias.\nSenior leadership effect describes two phenomena that\ncontribute to cascading bias. First, because both male and\nfemale managers apply a think leader\u00adthink male perspec-\ntive to performance evaluation, women are disadvantaged\nwhen being considered for leadership positions, regardless of\nthe gender of the hiring manager or influential organizational\nple generally prefer to work with and associate with others\nwho share their beliefs, values, and interest. Generally, peo-\nple feel most comfortable with others most similar to them-\nselves. Consciously or subconsciously, organizational\nleaders apply gender stereotypes to establish preferences\nSchulz and Enslin 3\namong potential candidates for executive openings and influ-\nence decisions about who is hired or promoted to top posi-\ntions (Warren, 2009). Because the majority of organizational\nexecutives are male, it stands to reason that the majority of\nindividuals promoted to executive positions will also be\neffect influences who gets assigned to high-visibility proj-\nects, takes part in networking opportunities, and receives\nStereotypes are built into talent management procedures,\nprograms, and tools and contribute to institutionalizing bias\n(Warren, 2009). Career path planning, secession planning, and\nmentoring programs can magnify the influence of leadership\nbias on the hiring, development, and promotion processes\nbuilt into talent management systems. Advancement and suc-\ncession planning criteria are often established and dictated\nwith top-down influence in organizations. Little consideration\nis given to whether criteria identified include characteristics or\ntraits that incorporate or perpetuate gender bias.\nWarren (2009) described compounding biases as \"gaps\nbetween the design and execution of talent management pro-\ngrams compound the disadvantages faced by women, espe-\ncially those seeking professional development and\nadvancement\" (p. 6).\nDouble-Bind\nThe double-bind dilemma for women in leadership estab-\nlished that women in organizations struggle to overcome\ncontradictory demands for performance, behavior, and lead-\nership. Catalyst (2007) described a double-bind as a set of\nconflicting demands that require women demonstrate contra-\ndictory behaviors that set them up for harsh judgment no\nmatter which behavior is adopted and forces women to\nchoose between equally unsatisfactory alternatives (Catalyst,\n2007). The double-bind manifests itself in three predica-\nments--extreme perception, the high competence threshold,\nand competent but disliked--and is manifest in masculine\nleadership theory and stereotypes (Catalyst, 2007).\nExtreme perceptions are a manifestation of gender stereo-\ntypes, which create the tendency for women to be described\nas nurturing and compassionate. Such stereotypes create a\npredicament in which, when female leaders behave as\nexpected (nurturing and compassionate), they are labeled too\nsoft. Alternatively, if a female leader is assertive and firm\n(unnurturing and uncompassionate), that woman will be\nlabeled too tough.\nHigh competency threshold describes a predicament in\nwhich women must deliver to higher standards than male\ncounterparts, often for smaller rewards. As a result, women\nface the high competency threshold when they are required\nto prove leadership ability repeatedly or when they must per-\nform more consistently and at a higher level than male coun-\nterparts only to receive the same or lower compensation,\nrecognition, or opportunities.\nThe predicament described as competent but disliked\ndescribes the phenomenon in which female managers and\nexecutives are challenged with balancing passiveness with\nassertiveness to satisfy the expectations of colleagues and\nmanagers. Regardless of experience, performance results,\nability, influence, or use of power, female managers must\nendure constant scrutiny and judgment from others who\ninevitably label them as too-soft or too-hard. Competent but\ndisliked is a predicament that describes the dilemma of being\nseen either as someone who takes-charge or someone who\ntakes-care. The result is that \" . . . female leaders are per-\nceived as likable or competent, but rarely both\" (Catalyst,\nUnwritten Rules of Advancement\nThe theory of unwritten rules for advancement identified\nspecific, undocumented behaviors that influence upward\nmobility in organizations. Sabattini (2008) described net-\nworking, gaining visibility, leveraging organizational poli-\ntics, developing strong communication skills, demonstrating\nstrong performance, obtaining mentoring, working long\nhours, and having a career plan as significant factors in the\nunwritten rules for advancement. Failures to identify,\nacknowledge, and adhere to the unwritten rules for advance-\nment could delay or even derail one's career. The unwritten\nrules to advancement were identified as a hurdle for women\nseeking advancement to executive levels in organizations\nbecause female workers often learn about the unwritten rules\nthrough observation and trial and error, rather than from rela-\ntionships built through mentoring or networking, and not\nknowing may delay or derail advancement (Sabattini, 2008).\nMethods, Techniques, or Modes of\nInquiry\nA descriptive phenomenological design was appropriate for\nthis research study because the purpose of this research was\nto explore and describe female executives' experiences and\nperceptions pertinent to career planning and advancement in\norganizations. Ten in-depth interviews and two focus groups\nwere used to thoroughly investigate and describe experi-\nences and perceptions. Focus group interviews involving\nthree female executives each were leveraged to triangulate\nthe data collected in the in-depth interviews and confirm the\nthemes that emerged in the data. All study participants were\nfemale executives employed in organizations in Nashville,\nTennessee, during the 2 years leading up to the study.\nData Sources, Evidence, Objectives, or\nMaterials\nThis study used purposeful and snowball sampling of female\nexecutives in the greater Nashville, Tennessee area.\nParticipants were recruited through email, in person, and over\n4 SAGE Open\nthe phone and were invited to participate in in-depth inter-\nviews or focus groups to share personal, lived experiences\nwith career planning and advancement in organizations.\nSixty-two women were invited to participate in this study.\nSixteen agreed to participate; 10 participated in in-depth\ninterviews and 6 participated in focus group interviews. The\n10 in-depth interviews and 2 focus groups that resulted in the\ncollection of data for this study were held in classrooms on\nUniversity of Phoenix campuses in Nashville, Tennessee,\nand Murfreesboro, Tennessee. In-depth interviews and focus\ngroups were conducted to the point of data saturation.\nStandardized interview protocols were developed and\npeer reviewed prior to the study. The protocols were used in\nall in-depth interviews and focus group interviews to ensure\nthat study participants in each session were provided with an\nopportunity to respond to an identical set of questions.\nDemographic and work history questionnaires were used to\ncollect demographic data such as age bracket, marital status,\neducation level, and work history detail including industry,\nsize of current organization, and years of experience in exec-\nutive positions. The researcher conducted the interviews fol-\nlowing the in-depth interview and focus group protocol.\nThe in-depth interview protocol was designed to mitigate\nthe potential for subjectivity and bias in individual interview\nsettings and guided each in-depth interview. In-depth inter-\nview questions were developed to provide data that may be\nhelpful to answering the research questions identified for this\nstudy. Questions were developed to ensure open-ended\nanswers describing participants'perceptions and experiences\nwith the phenomenon under study. Questions were devel-\noped in alignment with the research questions and to guide\nthe interview process. In-depth interview questions were\ndesigned to gather data rich descriptions of female execu-\ntives' lived experiences, beliefs, and perceptions relevant to\ncareer planning and advancement in organizations.\nValidation of study protocol and data collection tools is\nrecommended to ensure adequate design for eliciting data\nrich responses from the study subjects. Pilot interviews and\nfocus groups are effective tools for validating study protocol\nstudy protocol and demographics and work history profile\nquestionnaires ensured credibility and consistency in data\ncollection. The expert was a senior director of human\nresources for a medium sized firm and possessed extensive\nexperience with qualitative research, focus groups, and the\ndevelopment and validation of focus group protocol.\nTo evaluate the clarity of in-depth interview questions and\nthe effectiveness of the interview protocol, a pilot study took\nplace prior to the actual study. A pilot study is an effective\nway of validating study protocol (Leedy & Ormrod, 2010;\nSalkind, 2003). No questions were changed prior to conduct-\ning the actual in-depth interviews for this study. The pilot\nin-depth interview participant did not participate in the actual\nstudy. The pilot study revealed that the in-depth interview\nquestions were clear and concise and elicited open-ended\nanswers sufficient to collect data capable of answering the\nresearch questions posed for this study. No changes were\nmade to the in-depth interview protocol based on the results\nof the pilot in-depth interview.\nThe focus group protocol listed the predetermined ques-\ntions that were applied in each focus group interview.\nQuestions were developed before the focus group pilot inter-\nview based on themes identified in the analysis of data col-\nlected from in-depth interviews. The themes identified\ndictated the selection of the topics discussed and the format\nof focus group interview questions. Focus group questions\nwere developed to provide data that may be helpful to\nanswering the research questions identified for this study and\nrelevant to verifying themes identified in analysis of in-depth\ninterview data. Questions were developed to guide the focus\ngroup interviews, ensure open-ended answers in alignment\nwith the research questions, and facilitate candid discussion\namong focus group participants. One pilot focus group was\nconducted to evaluate the appropriateness of the focus group\nand to ensure the clarity of interview questions. Based on\nfeedback from the pilot focus group members, one question\nwas modified. Participants from the pilot study did not par-\nticipate in the actual study.\nThe demographics and work history profile were designed\nto gather demographic and work history details relevant to\ndescribing the sample relevant to this study. Work history\nand demographic data made it possible to identify and\ndescribe characteristics of the participants, the organizations,\nand the industries represented by the study sample. All study\nparticipants were asked to sign a signed consent form, were\nadvised of their right to withdraw from the study at any time\nwithout any repercussions, were assured of confidentiality,\nand were assigned pseudonyms to ensure protection of pri-\nvacy. The in-depth interview protocol, focus group protocol,\nand demographics and work history profile were reviewed\nby the International Review Board (IRB) to ensure adequate\nconsideration for participant privacy, anonymity, and\nconfidentiality.\nResults and Point of View\nAkey finding of this study was that gender bias was the prev-\nalent challenge experienced by women when applying career\nplanning and advancement in organizations. Barriers to\nadvancement for women in organizations were identified by\ndouble-bind, the unwritten rules to advancement, and cas-\ncading gender bias. These three barriers were also identified\nas obstacles women face as they pursue advancement to\nexecutive levels in organizations. Although the unwritten\nrules to advancement apply to all employees, networking and\naccess to mentors were two of the unwritten rules identified\nas unwritten rules that can represent seemingly insurmount-\nable barriers for women in male dominated environments\nSchulz and Enslin 5\n2008). Because women perceive a significant disadvantage\nin overcoming unwritten rules to networking (especially out-\nside working hours) and gaining access to mentors (Raggins\n& Cotton, 1999), the unwritten rules to advancement were\nidentified as gender specific challenges for the purpose of\nthis study.\nExperiences With the Double-Bind\nFemale executives who participated in this study shared per-\nceptions and experiences with the double-bind, which was\ndescribed by Catalyst (2007) as a set of conflicting demands\nthat earns women a label of either too nice or too brash,\nrequires women to work harder than male counterparts for\nthe same or less reward and recognition, and creates a need\nfor women to prove themselves capable and worthy of each\nopportunity, often doing the job long before receiving the\nformal promotion, whereas male counterparts are given\nopportunities and promoted based on potential rather than\nproven performance.\nCheryl explained her perceptions of the double-bind as a\nhurdle for women pursuing career planning and advance-\nment in organizations when she stated,\nA female needs to be worried, much more, about the respect\nlevel around her than the like level. That's something a female\nneeds to come to terms with. I think sometimes we are wired a\nlittle different, but when you get to that place, and accept that,\nyou become a stronger leader.\nAnother participant shared concerns about gender bias in\nthe workplace: \"I'm in a very male dominated environment.\nVery male dominated. Very few women [organization name\nomitted], in my department, and at my level and above. So,\nagain, you've gotta make sure you can hang in the meeting.\"\nShe went on to say, \"I feel like women almost have to try a\nlittle harder because there's an expectation that they're not\ngoing to be as business minded, if you will, as men. So it's a\nlittle bit harder to work.\"\nOne focus group participant commented on the need for\nwomen to vocalize their advancement desires because many\nmanagers assume women are not as career driven as men:\nIt does seem to be with men. It's almost just assumed, well of\ncourse they wanna advance. With women . . . I don't know. And\nso, I think it's really really important for women to make it\nclear--you know--just to have an idea what else they want to\ndo and try to be working and growing themselves to get there all\nthe time.\nA fellow focus group participant spoke up, vocalizing\nconcerns about the double standard often faced by women\nwho advocate for themselves. \"Yes,\" she agreed, \"And not in\na bitchy way, because when we speak up we're bitches, but\nwhen men speak up they're just being assertive.\"\nPat described how gender bias could work against both\nmale and female employees in low- and mid-level\nenvironments dominated by either gender. Pat pointed out\nthat low-level males trying to build careers in female domi-\nnated industries such as health care may face more gender\nbias than women in the same roles, but observed that women\nmay still be challenged by gender bias in pursuit of advance-\nment to executive levels even in traditionally feminine indus-\ntries. She stated,\nWell, I think not only for women but since we're talking about\nwomen, it's extremely important for women to have the degrees,\nto have the certifications, and to have the experience that they\nneed. And sometimes, I find . . . that there is sort of a bias. You\nknow, in nursing the bias is more toward men coming into those\npositions versus females, because it's generally a female career.\nYou know, that's really the majority of people in those positions.\nIn other positions, though, I think--depending on what it is--\nsometimes females are at a disadvantage because they are female.\nIn summary, data collected and analyzed for this study\nrevealed evidence of female executive's experiences with the\ndouble-bind and supported the evidence of gender bias pres-\nent in the three predicaments of the double-bind as presented\nExperiences With the Unwritten Rules to\nAdvancement\nFemale executives who participated in this study emphasized\nthe importance of individual commitment to career planning,\nand the responsibility for women to take ownership for pur-\nsuing career goals. Diane, a CEO with 20 years executive\nlevel experience in organizations, emphasized the necessity\nfor personal ownership in career planning and advancement,\nand the benefit of self-awareness gained through career plan-\nning: \"I think if we're aware of ourselves and of the opportu-\nnities, I really think there's power in that. And it's up to us to\ntake advantage of that knowledge.\" Another participant,\nBrenda, advised junior women to \"Do it! Number one, I\nmean, you just gotta do it! And it's got to be YOU.\"\nAnother participant explained how awareness of self and\nsurroundings helped her manage her career through a volatile\nand uncertain time:\nChanges were happening. The changes that were happening\nwere out of my control, so how could I be more in control of\nwhat I could control? And that's only the . . . you know . . . just\nme. And how could I make my skills better or more marketable\nso if I did get cut, you know, that my next opportunity--that I'd\nbe a better-prepared candidate.\nAnother participant said that women were responsible for\ntaking action to manage the trajectory of their own career\nwhenever possible. \"You have to innovate,\" she said. She\nwent on to explain how inequity in her work environment\nand a perceived need for change motivated her to develop\nand champion for the creation of a new position that resulted\nin her promotion to executive level:\n6 SAGE Open\nWhen I was a director of sales I had three counterparts. Four of\nus were covering the whole country, and I was so much more\neffective and better at my position than the other three. Yet, I\nfound out they were being paid more than me. They were three\nmen, and I was the only female. That crawled all over me. So\nthat's when I created the executive director level, sold it [to\nsenior management], and then I was promoted to executive\ndirector.\nAlthough every woman may not be in a position to create\nher own executive level position, a career plan is powerless\nwithout action. Erica precisely summed this up when she\ndeclared, \"I think that what a woman actually does plays a\nlarger role than the actual career planning.\"\nFemale executives who participated in this study described\nnetworking and building relationships with peers, mentors,\nand advocates as important factors in the lived experiences\nwith career planning and advancement in organizations. One\nstated,\nWomen need to have strong supporters and strong sponsors\nwithin their organizations to help them move up. And we, as\nwomen, have a duty and an obligation. We just had a legal\neducation thing on this the other day--lifting as we climb. We\nneed to remember that there are people above us, women above\nus, who lifted us and we need to lift the people behind us. And I\nbelieve career planning is such a big part of that. We need to talk\nto the younger women that we see in our organizations about\nthinking about career planning, about being deliberate in the\nchoices that you make.\nAnother said,\nI heard somebody put it in terms of having a personal advisory\nboard. Those people in your life that you can go and talk to and\nsay, \"I need to talk to you about my career,\" or \"I need to talk to\nyou about finances,\" or \"I need to see how you handled this\nsituation.\" And having those people that you trust to keep your\nconfidences and you also trust to be brutally honest.\nIn summary, in-depth interview and focus group partici-\npants for this study described experiences with the unwritten\nrules to advancement, specifically those rules related to\ncareer planning and to finding mentors and advocates who\nprovide support and act as champions.\nExperiences With Cascading Gender Bias\nThe basic principle behind cascading gender bias is that\nsenior leaders, the majority of whom are male, consciously\nor subconsciously apply masculine assumptions to evaluate\nleadership potential and capabilities for the purposes of hir-\ning, promoting, and succession planning (Warren, 2009).\nFemale executives who participated in this study described\nexperiences and observations related to cascading gender\nbias.\nCascading gender bias was evident in one participant's\nreference to the old boys club. \"I think women work harder\nthan men,\" the female executive stated. \"There are the old\nboys' clubs. And they are there, and they are prevalent.\" The\nparticipant paused a moment and then went on to say, \"I\ndon't think they are wrong. I'm not calloused by it. It's just\n. . . where do I fit in?\"\nWhen asked to describe the nature of the relationship\nbetween career planning and the advancement of women in\norganizations, another in-depth interview participant stated,\n\"It really depends on leadership, in my opinion. It is a top-\ndown perspective. If you work in an organization where\nwomen are seen as valuable in leadership roles then I think\nthose things trickle down.\" The female executive went on to\nsay, \"In different years, in the company that I'm at, there\nhave been ten women in top leadership positions. In other\nyears, there have been two. It really just depends on who was\npresident and CEO at the time.\"\nAnd yet another female executive described cascading\ngender bias as a hurdle to career planning and advancement\nin organizations when she said,\nI have faced hurdles. I have worked in environments where it\nwas very difficult for women to advance, largely because the\nleadership roles were filled with men who were looking to\npromote other men and not females. I have left those\nenvironments in order to continue to move up, realizing there\nwere no opportunities.\nIn summary, female executives who participated in this\nstudy shared observations and experiences in support of\nWarren's (2009) assertions that cascading gender bias influ-\nences and often dictates who gets recruited, hired, and pro-\nmoted in an organization.\nSummary: Results and Point of View\nGender bias was the prevalent challenge to career planning\nand advancement in organizations as described by female\nexecutives who participated in this study. Evidence of the\ndouble-bind, the unwritten rules to advancement, and cas-\ncading gender bias was evident in the data collected in 10\nin-depth interviews and 2 focus group interviews involving 3\nfemale executives each. Participants described how career\nplanning and engaging the support of mentors and advocates\nplayed a significant role in their advancement to executive\nlevel leadership, which supports past research indicating that\ncareer planning may help women overcome obstacles to\nadvancement in organizations (Sabattini, 2008; Sabattini &\nRecommendations\nThe findings of this study may help organizational leaders\ndevelop appropriate models and programs to address career\nplanning and advancement and increase the potential for hir-\ning and promoting the best person for the job regardless of\ngender. Women who desire advancement in organizations\nSchulz and Enslin 7\nmust take the initiative to engage in career planning follow\nthrough on the resulting career plan. Women must recognize\nthat successful career planning and advancement in organi-\nzations are dependent on people beyond the individual doing\nthe career planning and seek support from peers, mentors,\nadvisors, and advocates who can positively contribute to\ntheir success. Female executives must take responsibility for\ninforming and educating junior women about the unwritten\nrules for advancement and encourage women, minorities,\nand men to engage in career planning early and often in their\ncareers. Organizational leaders and human resource manage-\nment professionals must develop and implement mentor pro-\ngrams that ensure women gain access and support from\nmentors at executive levels. Females who seek career\nadvancement must make networking a priority and create\nvisibility for themselves inside and outside their current\norganizations.\nWomen in organizations must find the confidence and\nstrength to openly discuss gender bias as it presents itself in\nthe workplace, and organizational leaders must implement\npolicies and practices to ensure female workers can voice\nconcerns without fear of retribution or negative implications\nfor future advancement. Educational leaders must encourage\ncareer planning, in a broad sense, during the first 2 years of\ncollege and provide students with tools, information, and\ntraining necessary to develop a solid foundation for lifelong\ncareer planning. Women must take advantage of the tools\nprovided by educational institutions and should seek support\nfor career planning after graduating from college. Likewise,\norganizations must help women continue efforts toward\ncareer planning by offering self-assessment tools, access to\nmentors, training and development opportunities, and\ninsights into career paths and potential advancement oppor-\ntunities within the organization. Women who desire advance-\nment to executive levels in organizations must engage in\ncareer planning activities that enhance self-awareness;\nincrease visibility into development and advancement oppor-\ntunities; facilitate networking; and establish mentoring rela-\ntionships with individuals who can provide advice, coaching,\nand support.\nOrganizations must promote the formal career planning\nprograms, development programs, and tools available within\nthe organization to make it more likely that employees will\nbecome aware of and engage in career planning.\nOrganizational leaders must empower human resource man-\nagement teams to design and implement comprehensive\ncareer planning and advancement programs that inform and\nempower managers by making it possible to more efficiently\nand effectively match employees to development and\nadvancement opportunities. Organizational leaders must\nprovide managers and human resource departments with the\nnecessary resources for successfully implementing and\nmaintaining career planning and advancement programs.\nFinally, the findings of this study inspired the development\nof the comprehensive organizational career planning model,\nwhich can be applied for women, men, and minorities in\norganizations (Figure 1).\nAlthough the comprehensive career planning model\ndeveloped for this study has not been tested, the model was\ndeveloped by the researcher to address the need for career-\nplanning support in organizations and incorporates the find-\nings of this study. The model demonstrates a perpetual\nprocess for development, feedback, reflection, and learning\nthat has a strong foundation of continuous organizational\nsupport. Investments in organizational development pro-\ngrams that address all elements of the comprehensive organi-\nzational career planning model would benefit individuals\nand organizations by cultivating employee engagement,\nincreasing job satisfaction, providing visibility into opportu-\nnities for advancement, increasing employee retention,\nreducing turnover costs, increasing productivity, and enhanc-\ning visibility and insight for succession planning.\nLimitations\nThe limitations of the study included population size and\ngeographic area, which make it impossible to generalize the\nresults across the broader population. Other limitations\ninclude self-reporting by study participants and researcher as\ninterviewer, which may have introduced bias. Participant\nresponses may have been consciously or subconsciously\ninfluenced through nonverbal cues or tone and manner in\nwhich the interviewer asked questions. Although research\nprotocol was examined by experts prior to pilot studies to\nmitigate the potential for bias in interview questions and\nfocus groups were used to provide validation through trian-\ngulation, a researcher's engagement in the process may\nintroduce bias and affect results. Researcher bias was also\npossible in the interpretation of results.\nConclusion\nThe findings of this study have implications for individual\ncareer management, employee retention and productivity,\nand for closing the gender-gap in organizational leadership.\nCareer planning can empower women, men, and minorities\nto seek out and pursue development and advancement\nopporutnities. Engaging employees in organizatioanl career\nplanning programs and supporting career planning efforts\nmay serve to increase employee retention and boost employee\nloyalty, while serving to close the leadership gap at senior\nlevels in the orgnaization. Engaging highly motivated\nemployees in career planning and advancement programs\nmay also serve to better ensure that the best person is chosen\nfor the job regardless of gender.\nThe findings in this study are significant for providing\nmanagers and organizational leaders with additional insights\ninto the benefits for organizations and the benefits and barri-\ners for women with regard to career planning and advance-\nment in organizations. The findings may help policy makers\n8 SAGE Open\nand organizational leaders design future models and pro-\ngrams to aide with career planning and advancement in orga-\nnizations and for creating organizational cultures and\nstructures that are increasingly gender-neutral. These find-\nings may also provide organizational leaders with additional\ninformation about the factors influencing the lived experi-\nence of female employees with career planning and advance-\nment in organizations, and help educational institutions\ndevelop programs and tools that help students develop\nawareness for the importance of career planning to\nadvancement.\nFuture research may include repeating the research\ndesign, method, process, and protocol in other geographic\nareas of the United States to further explore the lived experi-\nences of female executives with career planning or to inves-\ntigate the lived experiences of male executives with career\nplanning and advancement. Recommended future research\nwould also investigate the emotional and experiential impli-\ncations for women who verbalize concerns about gender bias\nand gender inequality in organizational systems. Finally,\nfuture research should be conducted to explore the implica-\ntions of incorporating the comprehensive career planning\nCommitment\nCommitment\nAction\nMentoring\nAdvocacy\nAction Mentoring\nAdvocacy\nOnboarding\nTraining &\nDevelopment\nGap Analysis\nGoal Setting\nAnalysis\nEvaluation &\nFeedback\nEnhanced Engagement\nIncreased Job Satisfaction\nAdvancement\nHigher Retention\nLower Turnover Costs\nIncreased Productivity\nSuccession Planning\nFigure 1.
