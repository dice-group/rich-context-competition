    "abstract": "Abstract\nHistorically, real-world studies have indicated a spatial learning advantage for people who actively explore the environment\nthey inhabit as opposed to those whose experience is more passive. A common contrast is made between the spatial learning\nof car drivers and passengers. However, compared with walking and other forms of transportation, car-driving experience per\nse has a special status. An experiment was conducted to explore the dual hypotheses that active explorers learn more about\nthe layout of a virtual environment (VE) than passive observers and that real-world car drivers will learn more regardless of\ntheir experimental active/passive status. Participants explored a virtual model of a small town in active/passive, pairs. Active\nexploration was self-directed and goal driven, and all learning tasks were explicit. Consistent with many earlier studies in VEs,\nthere was no benefit from activity (controlling exploration/movement), arguably because input control competes with spatial\ninformation acquisition. When participants were divided according to whether they were licensed drivers or not, the results\nshowed that drivers were significantly more accurate than non-drivers at indicating the positions of target locations on a map,\nin both the active and passive conditions. An interaction showed that in the active condition, drivers had significantly better\nroute scores than non-drivers, and better than drivers in the passive condition. Driving may therefore be beneficial for spatial\nabilities over and above the general benefits of \"activity\" and when spatial skills are examined in VEs, driver experience is an\nimportant criterion that should be taken into account.\n",

Moreover, compared\nwith a pedestrian or a cyclist, the motorist controlling a vehi-\ncle is exposed to landmarks and spatial cues in rapid succes-\nsion, avoiding decay in short term or spatial working memory\nstores, potentially enhancing the development and coherence\nof spatial representations. This may explain why spatial\nmapping skills improve with driving experience (Maguire,\nWoollett, & Spiers, 2006). In professional London taxi driv-\ners, the size of the posterior hippocampus--a structure in the\ntemporal lobe traditionally implicated in cognitive spatial\nmapping (Morris & Parslow, 2004)--is enlarged, arguably\nreflecting repeated usage in navigating the complex array of\nstreets in the U.K. capital (Maguire etal., 2006). Woollett\nand Maguire (2010) found that taxi drivers were better at\nlearning the layout of a novel environment than matched\ncontrols, drawing more accurate sketch maps of a novel\nurban environment and better at \"executing routes\" through\nthat environment.\nGaunet, Vidal, Kemeny, and Berthoz (2001) have argued\nthat drivers' spatial learning may benefit directly from their\nbeing in control of their actions and displacements while\nexperiencing visual\u00admotor interaction and making autono-\nmous decisions concerning displacements in space. This is\nconsistent with a prominent model of spatial learning put for-\nward by Siegel and White (1975), which proposed that route\nlearning is an early stage of spatial learning, involving a\nsequence of decisions, taking place via the paired associa-\ntions of actions with landmarks (\"stimulus-response pair-\ning\") and facilitated by activity. From a recent extensive\ntheoretical review of the literature, Chrastil and Warren\n(2012) concluded that motor vehicle control and associated\nproprioceptive and vestibular feedback support the develop-\nment of route and survey map-type spatial knowledge of vir-\ntual environments (VEs), but that cognitive control--having\nto actively navigate and make decisions--is not contributory.\nSimilarly, Stulpnagel and Steffens (2012, Experiment 2)\nfound that tandem drivers were better at a landmark recogni-\ntion task than back seat passengers regardless of active/pas-\nsive navigation status. They concluded that vehicle control is\nimportant for landmark recognition, although cognitive navi-\ngation promotes better route and survey knowledge.\nThere are reasons for doubting whether vehicle control is\nalways beneficial in the way that Gaunet etal. (2001) suggest.\nBaddeley (1982) describes a conflict that he discovered\nbetween keeping his vehicle in lane while attempting to imag-\nine the layout of an American football pitch. This is important\nanecdotal evidence because it implies that, if the memory and\nprocessing of wider allocentric spatial information is compro-\nmised by the operation of vehicle controls, these are likely to\nshare common processing and compete for cognitive capacity\n(see also Pick, 2010). Indeed, a driver's actions in controlling\na vehicle can, in an experimental context (cf. Sandamas &\nForeman, 2014), arguably be considered a secondary task,\ncompeting with any other currently active spatial thinking or\nimagery and reducing the cognitive capacity available for the\nprocessing of environmental information linked to the encod-\ning of space. Of course, this is most likely to create difficulty\nfor novice drivers (including non-drivers tested in a driving\nsimulator), whose cognitive capacity is occupied largely by\nthe mechanics of driving. Paradoxically, therefore, while\ndriving may be seen as enhancing spatial processing of the\nenvironment--correlating with long-term driving experi-\nence--vehicle control may compete with and reduce spatial\nprocessing in the short term, especially in inexperienced or\nnovice drivers.\nThe present study employed the flexibility and reproduc-\nibility of a VE. Despite obvious differences between virtual\nand real environments, there exists considerable similarity\nbetween spatial knowledge acquired from each (see Peruch\n& Gaunet, 1998, for a review). Furthermore, Gaunet etal.\n(2001) suggest that active exploration of a VE with an input\ndevice shares important features with real-world active\nexploration such as the tight linkage between visual self-\nmotion and motor activity, and therefore driving simulators\noffer the opportunity to study relatively lifelike active navi-\ngation in a controlled environment (Aginsky, Harris, Rensink,\n& Beusmans, 1997). In past studies, equivalence of experi-\nence has not been matched between active and passive\ngroups, as active and passive perceptual experience has usu-\nally been confounded with the motoric activity involved in\nvehicle control. These factors can be separated using a VE.\nHowever, previous research using VEs to investigate\nactive/passive differences in spatial learning has been equivo-\ncal. The spatial learning advantage for active explorers,\nexpected from previous real-world studies, although reported\nin some VE-based studies measuring landmark object recogni-\ntion (Hahm etal., 2007) and route finding (Chrastil & Warren,\nWallet, Sauzeon, Rodrigues, Larrue, & N'Kaoua, 2010), has\nnot appeared consistently as many studies report no reliable\nactive advantage (see Gaunet et\nWilson, Foreman, Gillett, & Stanton, 1997; Wilson & Peruch,\n2002). For reviews of this issue, see Stulpnagel and Steffens\ncases, a passive advantage has been reported. For instance,\nSandamas and Foreman (2007) initially found that passive\nparticipants were better at a map placement task after experi-\nence of a VE than their active counterparts, subsequently find-\ning (Sandamas, Foreman, & Coulson, 2009) that the active\nadvantage could be restored if participants were given prior\ntraining with the input device used to explore the VE. Chrastil\nand Warren (2012) proposed that one reason for the unreliabil-\nity of activity benefit in desktop VEs is that they are impover-\nished in terms of the proprioceptive and vestibular information\nthat standard input devices provide for active explorers. In a\nfollow-up study however, they reported that vestibular infor-\nmation was not an important component for spatial learning in\na VE but that podokinetic and visual information are (Chrastil\nSandamas and Foreman 3\nproposed that the standard input devices commonly used to\nnavigate VEs may compete directly for cognitive capacity if\nthey are unfamiliar to the user and that this too could be a\nmajor factor in the unreliable findings reported for the benefits\nof the active exploration of virtual space.\nThe current study used measures of pointing accuracy,\nroute learning, and survey mapping to assess the general\nbenefits of activity (virtual vehicle control) for participants'\nlearning of the spatial layout of a novel virtual town, while\nalso considering what impact driver status itself might have.\nNote that in past studies, driver status has not usually been\nconsidered in relation to participant selection or used as a\nfactor in statistical analysis. Participants in the present active\ncondition navigated around a complex VE designed to look\nlike a small town center, using a steering wheel and pedal\ninput device (so having both motoric control and cognitive\ncontrol), whereas participants in the passive condition\nviewed exactly the same displacements as the active partici-\npants (but had no motoric or cognitive control).\nFor the purposes of the present study, in light of the above\nconflicting evidence, and as previous studies showing pas-\nsive advantage were conducted with input devices such as\nmouse, keyboard, or joystick rather than driving simulator\nequipment, we adopted a na\u00efve hypothesis (based on real-\nworld studies) that active participants who \"drove\" a virtual\nvehicle would learn more about the spatial layout of the VE\nthan passives, and perform better on both survey mapping\nand route knowledge tasks (cf. Chrastil & Warren, 2012;\naddress the impact of driver status (cf. Gaunet etal., 2001),\nactive and passive data were collected from a group of real-\nworld drivers and another having had no experience of car\ndriving. Better performance was expected from drivers than\nnon-drivers on all measures, irrespective of the experimental\ncondition in which they were tested.\nMethod\nParticipants\nTable 1 shows how participants were split across the two cat-\negories of driver status. Participants who were car drivers all\nconfirmed that they drove regularly and preferred car driving\nconfirmed that drivers were not older than non-drivers.\nSetting\nThe experiment took place in a large room (approximately\n7 m2) designated as the VR laboratory. The windows were\nblacked out to enhance the virtual image, with the lights\nswitched off, to increase the sense of immersion by reducing\nthe conspicuousness of objects in the room while partici-\npants explored the VE.\nApparatus\nThe VE was constructed using Superscape 3-D virtual reality\nsoftware run on an IBM compatible desktop PC with an Intel\nPentium 3 processor. The output image was fed directly to an\nElectrohome Projection Systems ECP 3500plus standard\nRGB projector. The 1 \u00d7 2 m image was projected onto a 2 \u00d7\n4 m screen (a white painted wall) 4.5 m from the projector,\nthe lower edge being 1 m above the floor level. The image\nwas thereby projected over the head of participants who sat\nat a desk, 3.5 m from the screen. Participants in the driver\ncondition sat with the input device in front of them. The\ninput device, chosen to give participants the feel of driving\naround the VE, was a thrust-master steering wheel and pedal\narrangement providing directional, acceleration, and brak-\ning control. The steering wheel was fixed to the desk with\nthe pedal unit sitting on the floor underneath it. This was\nremoved when the participants in the passenger condition\nviewed the VE.\nThe layout of the VE was designed to resemble, broadly\nspeaking, a typical small U.K. town center consisting of six\nblocks of buildings and trees bounded by roadways; four\ncross roads, a T-junction, and a centrally located roundabout\nwith 5 exits (see Figure 1). The virtual buildings were of sev-\neral types, including multi-storey office blocks, brick-\nrendered residential type houses, shops, including a super-\nmarket and newsagent (see Figure 2), a bank, and a church.\nIn addition to a roundabout, other street features included\nrailings, a pelican crossing, a post-box, a phone-box, two\nstatues, and a clock monument. Many of the objects within\nthe VE, such as the trees, street furniture, and generic build-\nings, were downloaded directly from the Superscape \"ware-\nhouse,\" although buildings dressed in the liveries of Barclays\nBank, Tesco, WH Smith, and KFC were created for the cur-\nrent study. In essence, the VE was designed to contain many\nof the elements and the complexities one would expect to\nfind in a small town center.\nTable 1. Participant Age and Sex by Driver Status.\nDriver Non-driver\nTotal\n Male Female Male Female\n4 SAGE Open\nProcedure\nParticipants experienced the VE in either the active (driver) or\npassive (passenger) condition. Participants in the active condi-\ntion were instructed that they would have 10 min to explore\nthe VE and that within that time they must find four readily\nidentifiable locations labeled variously as Home, College,\nBabysitter, and School, while also trying to \"get to know\" the\nlayout of the VE, so that the learning task was explicit. The\nexploration of each active participant was videotaped and\nshown to the following participant who would therefore be in\nthe passenger (passive) condition. Participants in the passive\ncondition were told that they were viewing a 10-min tape of\nsomebody \"driving around\" a VE and that they were to look\nout for four readily identifiable locations (the same locations\nthat participants in the active condition were told to look for)\nwhile also trying to \"get to know\" the layout of the VE. At 5,\n7, and 9 min, the experimenter asked all participants how\nmany of the target locations they had found and informed\nthem of the time they had left.Any participants who could not\nfind all four locations within the 10 min allowed for the task\ncould not proceed to the next stage of the experiment. This\nhappened in only one instance.\nBefore being introduced to the experimental environment,\nall active participants were given instruction on how to use\nthe input device and given the opportunity to \"drive\" around\na practice virtual road circuit until they reported that they felt\ncomfortable. Participants adjusted to the sensitivity of the\ncontrols in terms of turn and acceleration within the first\nminute and completed this task with ease. Importantly,\nSandamas etal. (2009) found that prior experience of an\ninput device to navigate a practice VE could restore the\nadvantage on a map placement task for active explorers over\npassive observers, while without input device training pas-\nsive participants were better (Sandamas & Foreman, 2007).\nThey interpreted this as indicating that untrained use of the\ninput device excessively loads working memory and acts as\na concurrent task interfering with the main task of learning\nthe layout of the test environment. This interpretation was\ngiven further support by the findings of Sandamas and\nOutcome Measures\nAfter experiencing the VE, measurement of participants'\nspatial knowledge acquisition was designed to evaluate both\nsurvey and route knowledge as per Siegel and White's (1975)\nmodel of spatial learning.\nSurvey mapping, street-level view\nPointing error (PE) scores.Participants were required to\npoint to unseen locations from a central point within the VE\nby aiming a cross hair in the center of the screen at the tar-\nget. This was achieved by rotating the viewpoint. The loca-\ntions were those four that participants were required to look\nfor during the exploration phase, plus one other that was\nhighly visible (a red statue). PE scores were calculated from\nthe cumulative difference between the true direction of the\ntargets and participants' indicated directions, measured in\ndegrees. The scores were summed and divided by 5 to give\nmean scores for PE (see Table 2; see also Foreman, Stanton,\nSurvey mapping, bird's eye view\nMap placement error scores.Each participant was given\nan A4 sheet of paper with the road layout of the VE printed\non it and asked to indicate as accurately as possible, by\nmarking the paper with the corresponding numbers, the posi-\ntions of the four locations they were asked to find during\nthe exploration phase of the study. Placement error scores\nwere then calculated by measuring distance in millimeters\nbetween the positions indicated by the participants and the\ntrue location positions. These distances were summed for the\nfour locations and divided by 4 to give mean scores for map\nFigure 1. A bird's eye (survey) view of the small town virtual\nenvironment.\nFigure 2.

Participants were required to travel via the\nshortest route between four pairs of locations within the VE;\nthe locations used were those participants were required\nto look for during the exploration phase. The start point of\neach route was adjacent to one of the locations. Participants\nwere \"transported\" directly to the start point and instructed\nto \"drive\" via the shortest route to the target location. Partici-\npants had to make four such journeys (college to home; home\nto the red statue; red statue to the baby sitter; baby sitter to\nthe school). Participants'displacements during this task were\nrecorded and subsequently scored using the following crite-\nria: 0 points for failing to reach the target location within the\npermitted time; 1 point for indirectly (doubling back, retrac-\ning steps, etc.) finding the target location; 2 points for find-\ning the target location directly (no doubling back or retracing\nsteps) but not via the shortest route; and 3 points for find-\ning the target location directly via the shortest route. Par-\nticipants' points were totaled to give overall \"route scores\"\nResults\nThe independent variables used in the following analyses\nwere \"condition\" (active/passive) and \"driver status\"\n(whether or not participants were real-world car drivers).\nThe dependent variables were PE scores (in degrees), MPE\nscores (in millimeters), and route scores.\nDescriptive Statistics\nTable 2 shows PE scores (in degrees), MPE scores (in milli-\nmeters), and route scores for condition by driver status.\nInspection of the means indicates a trend in favor of drivers\non all measures under all conditions except for route scores\nunder the passive condition.\nInferential Statistics\nThe scores in Table 1 were subjected to a 2 (condition [active/\npassive]) \u00d7 2 (driver status [Driver/Non-Driver]) independent\ngroups factorial ANOVA.\nA significant main effect for driver status was indicated\n(inspection of the means indicates that participants who were\ncar drivers [driver] were more accurate at indicating the posi-\ntions of target locations on a map, in both the active and pas-\nsive conditions, than participants who had indicated that they\nwere non-drivers [see Figure 3]), but not for PE scores,\n2 = .028. There were no significant main\np\nFrom Figure 3, we can see, from the lower MPE scores,\nthat drivers are more accurate at placing landmarks on a map\nof the VE regardless of the condition (active/passive) than\nnon-drivers.\nAsignificant interaction for driver status by condition was\np\n= .230 (see Figure 2).

Passive participants per-\nformed at the same level as their active counterparts when\npointing to currently non-visible locations within the VE,\nidentifying the positions of locations on an outline map of\nthe VE and driving routes within the VE. The current find-\nings, therefore, demonstrate that, for adults at least, activity\nin a VE does not necessarily confer an advantage for spatial\nlearning of that environment, supporting the findings of\nmany previous virtual world studies (e.g., Arthur, 1996;\n2002). Clearly, whether an active advantage does appear, as\nin studies such as those of Farrell etal. (2003), Hahm etal.\nincluding the nature of the input device and the degree of\ntraining with which participants are provided prior to begin-\nning the virtual exploration. Further specific study of these\nfactors is needed. Moreover, age effects might be anticipated\nas studies such as those of Siegel, Herman,Allen, and Kirasic\nand the virtual experiments of Sandamas and Foreman\n(2007) have all indicated that as humans progress from child-\nhood to adulthood they become less reliant on self-guided\nlocomotion through space to form good spatial representa-\ntions. Sandamas etal. (2009), however, did find that 7- to\n8-year-olds were able to demonstrate the benefits of activity\nwithin a VE after initial training with the input device.\nThe current findings are inconsistent with the conclusions\nof many real-world environmental studies including those of\nhave argued activity to be beneficial for spatial learning in\nadults, based on the performance of real-world drivers com-\npared with passengers. However, it should be noted that\nthese former studies were not controlled experiments per se,\nbut rather ecological/urban studies (Appleyard, 1970; Ladd,\ncar drivers to be better able to draw coherent city maps than\nbus passengers--and this has been often cited in subsequent\npapers as demonstrating the benefits of activity--it is unclear\nwhether this reflects the benefits of activity per se (i.e., the\nphysical act of driving and/or the mental act of making direc-\ntional choices) or whether it arises because they get to expe-\nrience more of the city that they are free to explore at\n\"geographic\" scale. In the current study, this confound was\naddressed as both active participants (who drove around the\nVE using the input device) and passive participants (who did\nnot have any control over exploration) experienced the envi-\nronment to the same extent; yet in this case, no differences in\nspatial learning emerged. Another advantage for drivers in\nthe real world is that the act of driving itself forces them to\nattend more closely to where they are going and anticipate\nthe routes they need to take (Chrastil & Warren, 2012). This\nmeans that environmental features such as street names, road\nsigns, potential landmarks, distance, and directional infor-\nmation carry more importance for the car driver than for the\ncasual passenger (see Beck & Wood, 1976). However, were\npassengers to attend to the environment during journeys to\nthe same extent that is mandatory for drivers, their spatial\nlearning could be equivalent to, or even greater than, that of\ndrivers as they are not distracted by performing the concur-\nrent task of physically driving. In the current study, both\nactive and passive participants were given the same instruc-\ntion to \"get to know\" the environment to attenuate any differ-\nences in attention between the groups, and no differences in\nspatial learning were found.\nFigure 4. Route scores by condition and driver status.\nSandamas and Foreman 7\nIt might be suggested that the findings of previous real-\nworld research, such as those of Appleyard (1970) and others\n(see above), may not reflect the benefits of activity per se but\nrather demonstrate benefits related to driving and consequent\nsuperior processing of spatial information. The current find-\nings go some way to supporting this notion in that we did\nfind a clear advantage on the map placement and route mea-\nsures of spatial learning for participants who were car drivers\nin the real world. For instance, car drivers were significantly\nbetter than non-car drivers at indicating the positions of tar-\nget locations on a map, regardless of the active or passive\ncondition in which they participated. Previously, Beck and\nWood (1976) suggested that experience with conventional\nmaps predicts the ability to use maps as a vehicle for the\nexpression for geographic knowledge, and Appleyard (1970)\nfound that drivers drew maps that were more complete and\ncoherent than those of passengers. Sandamas and Foreman\n(2007) found that greater experience in a VE led to better\nsurvey maps of the VE irrespective of the active or passive\nstatus of participants, although real-world driver status was\nnot considered and this could have been a factor. Therefore,\nthe current finding may be taken to demonstrate that car driv-\ners have a greater understanding of, and ability to use, maps\nor they have developed other skills through driving which\nthey are able to transfer to the understanding of new environ-\nments under a range of conditions including that of experi-\nencing them passively.\nIt was also found that real-world car drivers in the experi-\nmental active condition were better at navigating routes\nwithin the VE than non-drivers in the active condition and\ncar drivers in the passive condition. As the input device used\nin this study was a steering wheel, for directional control,\npaired with a set of pedals to control acceleration and brak-\ning, the situation closely replicated the experience of driving\na vehicle with which drivers were all familiar. Real-world\ncar drivers in the active condition may have benefited more,\nin terms of spatial learning, because they were able to explore\nthe VE by driving round it, consistent with their experience\nin real life. Added to this, it could also be argued that real-\nworld drivers using an input device that replicates driving are\nprobably better able to adapt to--and less likely to suffer any\ncognitive disadvantage such as reduced working memory\ncapacity from--this imposition than are non-drivers, as for\nchild participants (Sandamas & Foreman, 2007; Sandamas\netal., 2009). Furthermore, Foreman, Sandamas, and Newson\n(2004) did not find any advantage on a distance estimation\ntask for participants who used a step device to \"walk\" around\na VE over participants who experienced the VE actively,\nwith a joystick or passively; virtual distance underestimation\nwas consistent across groups.\nThe current study has also revealed a significant negative\ncorrelation between route scores and MPE scores indicating the\ninterdependent relationship between survey and route knowl-\nedge and that these two aspects of spatial learning appear to\ndevelop fairly quickly and in parallel as proposed by\nMontello (1998) rather than in a strictly hierarchical way\nover an extended period of time, as proposed by Siegel and\nmemory for landmarks and map drawing ability were posi-\ntively correlated after brief experience of a VE. Interestingly,\nPE scores did not correlate with either of the other two mea-\nsures of spatial learning in the current study or differentiate\nactive/passive or driver/non-driver groups. The implication\nmay be that the participants found the task too difficult and\nwere unable to orient themselves within the VE, despite\nbeing able to navigate around it and place landmarks on a\nmap of it. In addition, this finding may further illustrate the\nsensitivity of spatial learning to procedural, task, and mea-\nsurement differences as pointed out by Wilson (1999),\nChrastil and Warren (2012), and others, and therefore needs\nfurther investigation.\nObviously, the current findings raise many questions\nand research opportunities regarding the status of activity\nfor spatial learning in adults, the role driving has to play in\nthe development of specific spatial skills related to road-\ndominated environments and maps, and how best to use\nVEs in the future for transport and training, also the assess-\nment of age-related driving competences (Pick, 2010;\nPonds, Brouwer, & van Wolffelaar, 1988). The data also\nemphasize that driver experience is an important criterion\nthat should be taken into account when sampling partici-\npants for participation in spatial experiments. Furthermore,\ndriving and navigating should be regarded as representing\ncompeting \"dual tasks,\" especially for novice drivers;\ndriver status is therefore a factor that should be incorpo-\nrated in future into statistical analyses of any spatial learn-\ning data.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAginsky, V., Harris, C., Rensink, R., & Beusmans, J.
