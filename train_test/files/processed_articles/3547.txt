    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe regional policy level is often seen as a (potential) source of progressive policy-\nmaking in health (and in social policy more widely), complementing or substituting\nnational policy levels, which are perceived as underperforming. While it can certainly be\nargued that there are important opportunities to adopt regional approaches to tackle\nborder-crossing health issues, this article draws the attention to the fact that the linkage\nbetween (inter-)regional and national policy levels is not uni-directional. While in some\ninstances the regional level may indeed take the lead in the promotion of (the right to)\nhealth, in other instances it may well be the other way round. This article focuses on the\ncase of Colombia, where international economic rules have deeply permeated public\npolicies in the health sector. On one hand, Colombia has been opening markets through\nthe conclusion of regional integration arrangements (e.g. Andean Community and the\nPacific Alliance) and the new generation of Free Trade Agreements. On the other hand,\nColombia has been one of the most active emerging countries in promoting the right\nto health as a justiciable fundamental right, in line with the International Covenant on\nEconomic, Social, and Cultural Rights of the United Nations mainly due to the judicial\nactivism of the Colombian Constitutional Court with interesting implications for\nregional social governance. The article shows that national courts can play an important\nrole in the protection of the right to health in a context of economic integration and\nthe absence of regional balancing policies.\nCorresponding author:\nPhilippe De Lombaerde, United Nations University (UNU-CRIS), Potterierei 72, Brugge 8000, Belgium.\nEmail: pdelombaerde@cris.unu.edu\nArticle\n",

The regional level is thereby\nseen as a potential source of progressive policy-making, complementing or substituting\nnational levels, which are perceived as underperforming. This is very much in line with\nthe orientation of the broader literature (and normative theorizing) on global health gov-\nWhile we recognize that especially in cases of border-crossing health issues (communi-\ncable diseases, migration-related health issues, etc.) regional health policies are to be\nrecommended and that outward regional health diplomacy can contribute crucially to\ndefending the interests of the region in a context of globalization, we argue that the link-\nage between international/inter-regional/regional and national policy levels is not uni-\ndirectional. While in some instances the regional level may indeed take the lead in the\npromotion of (the right to) health, in other instances it may well be the other way round.\nIn this article, the latter instance will be more closely looked at in the case of Colombia.\nWe show that while there is a potential for regions to promote health, in practice, regional\nand inter-regional economic rules do not necessarily work in that direction so that\nnational institutions (mostly courts), or other actors, have to step in and protect the right\nto health in the absence of regional balancing policies.\nThe article speaks therefore to the more critical approaches to the contribution of\nregional arrangements, especially the ones in the economic sphere, to the protection of\nsocial rights, as exemplified by O'Brien (2008) in the area of labor rights. The question\nwhich emerges then is whether the literature on regional health policy or governance\ndoes not need more balanced assessments by taking overlapping memberships (e.g. the\nUnion of South American Nations [UNASUR], Andean Community [CAN], and free\ntrade agreements [FTAs]) into account as well as interacting policy areas (e.g. health\nand trade).\nThe article speaks also to the literature on health diplomacy and the protection of the\nright to health. In effect, this literature emphasizes the role that, for example, regional\norganizations and civil society actors can play as intermediaries in the relationships\nbetween national health policymakers, health service providers, and the people in need\nof medical services (or, rights bearers).1 Our contribution will be to show that at least in\nthe case of Colombia, the role played by regional organizations (through health diplo-\nmacy or other actions) should not be overestimated, while national actors such as courts\n(and the justiciability of the right to health) are playing an important role in the policy\ngame. Outside the legal discipline, this role is somewhat underestimated or even ignored.\nThe case of Colombia is relevant for several reasons. First, the protection of constitu-\ntional rights by its Constitutional Court is internationally recognized (Bonilla, 2014; ICJ,\ntic ideas abound on bipolar politics (i.e. left vs right) in South America, the case illus-\ntrates that social policy orientation in the region should be nuanced. And third, Colombia\nis a typical case of a country where policy-making takes place in an increasingly com-\nplex environment, characterized by multiple international commitments, including with\nthe World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Trade Organization\n(WTO), the United Nations (UN), the CAN, the UNASUR, the Pacific Alliance, and a\nseries of FTAs.\nThe article is organized as follows: In section `Contextualizing the protection of the\nright to health', the protection of the right to health will first be contextualized by refer-\nring to the international regulatory context. This is followed by a discussion of how the\nright to health is protected in Colombia, with specific attention for its constitutional\nframework and court activism (section `The right to health in Colombia'). In section\n`(Inter-)Regional Integration and the Right to Health', we analyze how the protection of\nthe right comes under pressure in a context of regional and inter-regional economic inte-\ngration arrangements (CAN and recent FTAs), and how the protection of the right to\nhealth is balanced (or not) with the protection of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR).\nSection `Conclusion' concludes.\nContextualizing the protection of the right to health\nThe concept of the international human right to health is a framework for states seeking\nto promote health care, in accordance with their economic resources and cultural mores\n(Kinney, 2001: 1458). The most important international treaty recognizing the right to\nhealth is the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and the International\nCovenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (ICESCR). The UN also created\nspecialized institutions such as the World Health Organization (WHO). At the regional\nlevel, the Organization of American States (OAS) recognized health as a public good in\nGeneral Comment (GC) 14 of the ICESCR Committee is the most important param-\neter defining the scope of the international right to health. It requires national health\nsystems to be institutionally capable to realize this right, which includes the availability,\naccessibility, acceptability, and quality of needed health care services and facilities. It\nalso defines the obligations of the states as the duties of respect, protection, and fulfill-\nment. In addition, the violation of the right to health was defined as the unwillingness to\nuse the maximum of its available resources for [its] realization. Concerning the duties of\nfulfillment, failures in recognizing the right to health mainly by legislative way, comple-\nmented with policies focused toward vulnerable groups, were seen as concrete violations\nnomic and cultural framework of each country, but the promotion of universal outcome\nmeasures seeks to evaluate its implementation with the help of human development indi-\nAt the national level, a general trend has been the progressive constitutionalization of\nthe right to health. Kinney and Clark (2004: 290) found that, first, the main constitutional\nprovisions worldwide aim at a healthy environment and workplace, the protection of the\nright to life, and to promote general welfare. Second, 67.5% of the constitutions world-\nwide include provisions addressing health care. However, many countries that spend\nimportant resources on health do not have relevant constitutional rules regarding this\nright. In countries with the highest per capita government expenditures for health care,\nonly 3 out of 16 have constitutional health duties. Third, no correlation was found\nbetween the intensity of constitutional commitments and the government expenditures\nfor health. The importance of legal remedies as access to courts and the opportunity to\nchallenge policymakers who fail to enforce constitutional mandates also varies across\ncountries. They conclude that legal actions are not the best option to obtain health care\nbecause when judges adjudicate in this sense, they become policymakers in an environ-\nment of scarcity. As a result, policy duties created by the constitution and international\nhuman rights treaties are standards to evaluate the performance of governments in the\nrealization of the Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (ESCR). Court intervention by\nproviding solutions for governmental failures in the enforcement of rights is limited by\nbudgetary restrictions which determine the realization of a satisfactory level of health\nAccording to the international literature on the right to health, the role played by the\nregional level is not very visible, and instead the duties of the countries in this respect are\ngradually expanding and becoming more demanding.\nThe right to health in Colombia\nProvided that the ESCR have the status of constitutional rights in Colombia, the Court\nhas been transforming their nature and scope by considering them as fundamental rights,\nthat is, the State should guarantee them in an immediate way, in strong contrast with the\ntraditional approach that rather considers them as goals of the State whose obligations\nare of progressive compliance. ESCR have been qualified as the corner stone of the legal\nreasoning of the Court, and among them, the right to health represents the paradigm of\nFollowing the general understandings at the international level, the Court also admit-\nted that those rights have an essential, non-negotiable nucleus that may not be restricted\nand another part of progressive fulfillment defined by law, that is, ESCR become funda-\nmental when disregarding them may affect the dignity of a person and should be fulfilled\nThe Court argued that if the State does not allocate fiscal resources to supply basic\nneeds, the judicial power can intervene because the protection of ESCR is one of its main\nfunctions in view of reaching the objectives of the Legal Social State (Cepeda, 2004).\nThis position of the Court has been questioned by economic authorities who consider the\nfulfillment of the ESCR as a goal of the State so that its duties can be limited, even if the\njudiciary orders the provision of the corresponding health services.\nIn 2010, the United Nations Economic and Social Council [UNESC] evaluated the\nprogress of Colombia on public health policy and highlighted the lack of updated infor-\nmation and statistics to assess whether ESCR were being implemented by Colombia. The\nCouncil recommended the strengthening of public health policy, to ensure universal\naccess to healthcare services, especially for vulnerable groups (United Nations Economic\nand Social Council [UNESC], 2010: 25). This position is the one shared by the Court\nwhich, despite economic constraints and criticisms, seems to be implementing binding\nrules in line with the international guidelines of the ICESCR.2 Although the impact of\nconstitutional case law on the enforcement of the right to health is remarkable, universal\nUN highlighted the unification of the healthcare systems in 2012 promoted by the Court,\nwhich means that the benefits are now equal for the contributory regime and the subsi-\ndized health plan, with a health insurance coverage of 96% (p. 41).\nThis unification of the healthcare system has been reached because of the action of the\nCourt. In fact, ruling T860/07 is considered as a real judicial statute on the provision of\nhealth services in which the Court ordered the government to take measures to eliminate\nthe regulation failures of health programs and, to assure its integral updating, the unifica-\ntion of both regimes and the appropriate and efficient provision of the service, emphasiz-\ning that the goal of universal coverage is to be reached.\nThis ruling is a real landmark case for the judicialization of health policies and it is the\nconsequence of the great impact of health litigation on health policies in Colombia.\nAlthough the case of Colombia is not unique (ICJ, 2008: 65\u00ad69), a study put in perspec-\ntive the relevance of this case by showing that Colombia is the middle-income country\nwith the highest per capita rate of right to health litigation with 3289 legal actions per\nmillion of persons, followed by Brazil (206), Costa Rica (109), Argentina (29), South\nAccording to these `jurisprudencial guidelines' for health policies, human dignity\ngives a fundamental character to the right to health, and therefore, human dignity may\ncondition healthcare services.3 This means that the duty of implementation of public\nhealth policy should be harmonized with guaranteeing the effectiveness of constitu-\ntional rights.\nA relevant aspect of public health policy is the regulation of the pharmaceutical mar-\nket which has a direct relation with regional integration and which finds \u00ad in Colombia\n\u00ad binding parameters in the law but also in related case law. The cost of medicines is\nindeed one of the major concerns in developing countries' healthcare systems. In\nColombia, in the period 2006\u00ad2008, public expenditure on pharmaceuticals represented\n1.3% of the gross domestic product (GDP), increasing to 3.2% of GDP in 2009 (Andia,\nderegulation of pharmaceutical prices by the government in 2006,4 which together with\nthe widespread use of health litigation provoked a strong pressure on the financing of\nof price control of medicines,6 in line with the order of the Court7 to the government to\nsolve the critical situation of overruns of prices of medicines for the health system. The\nfirst measures regulated the price of more than 300 medicines, taking as a reference a\nbasket of international prices and unified the prices of medicines for re-payment pur-\nposes by the public funds.8\nThe Court elevated the level of regulation of the market of medicines to a statutory\nlaw because its functioning is a determining factor to guarantee the three essential ele-\nments of the right to health: availability, accessibility, and quality.9 The Court supported\nthe price control of medicines by the government because a strict regulation of the mar-\nket of medicines would mitigate unsuitable practices in the health system, which make\nthat the prices of medicines are higher than in other countries or than international refer-\nence values. In short, in Colombia, the accessibility of medicines is now a constitutional\nduty, that is, pharmaceutical enterprises have also a constitutional social function when\ndeploying their activities, which implies duties, and the way to reach it is by the regula-\ntion of the prices of medicines in all phases of production and commercialization until\nthe final users of the product.\nAs a result, the Colombian government is also advancing new regulations for biologi-\ncal medicines whose patents will soon expire, and therefore, their price control is also an\nissue linked to the concept of bio-similar medicines10 whose relevance is high because\nbiological medicines represent almost 30% of the pharmaceutical market in Colombia\nand they are mostly financed by the public health system (Minsalud, 2014).\nThe development of bio-generics is a more complex issue than the chemical generics.\nThe issue concerns price controls, patents, but above all the technological capacity of\nemerging countries to regulate these processes and to produce biosimilars. The regula-\ntion of biosimilars by emerging economies has been strongly opposed by the United\nStates and the European Union (EU) and by the Biotechnology Industry Organization\n(BIO) arguing concerns about public health.11 Even more, they are announcing a poten-\ntial consultation before the WTO for those regulations seen as technical barriers to\ntrade.12 In Latin America, Brazil and Cuba are leading the way on this issue, but it is a\nfield where regional cooperation would appear as essential to reach a good level of regu-\nlation and production. The UNASUR is quoted as an adequate forum to reach concrete\n(Inter-)regional integration and the right to health\nRegional integration processes have gradually covered other domains than trade, the EU\nbeing the most emblematic case. In Latin America, which is characterized by multiple\nregional schemes, it is the UNASUR which seems to privilege political concerns over com-\nmercial issues and which has entered the health policy area. Concerning the right to health,\nthe main tension between its enforcement and international trade commitments of many\nregional and bilateral agreements is related to reaching universal coverage in health care in\nAccording to GC14, access to medicines is a crucial component of the right to health,\nwhich in turn is linked to the right to life (Ely, 2003). The Doha Declaration on the\nAgreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) and Public\nHealth of 200113 sought to flexibilize TRIPS enforcement in cases of public health crises\n(access to medicines) in developing countries. This declaration sought to balance incen-\ntives for the production of IPR (pharmaceutical subsidies or public funding to promote\ninnovation) with the promotion of its widespread use (flexibilization of patent regula-\ntions in developing countries, for example, by issuing compulsory licenses or by import-\nIn the `Special 301' Report,14 the US Trade Representative (USTR) also refers to this\nconflictive relation between IPR and the right to health.

In\nother words, the United States seeks a balancing between the need of granting compul-\nsory licenses to export pharmaceutical products to countries that cannot produce drugs\nfor themselves but seeking to reduce market access barriers that US pharmaceutical and\nThe emergence of the new generation of FTAs makes the issue more complex because\nthese agreements are considered as TRIPS-plus with respect to the protection of IPR.\nThat is, the United States and the EU seek to go further in the protection of IPR of their\npharmaceutical enterprises. However, a study of UNDP-UNAIDS (2012) concluded that\nthe advantages of TRIPS-plus protection in the new generation FTAs, that is, that they\nincrease foreign investment and/or innovation, have not been fully demonstrated. On the\ncontrary, the study alerted about their possible detrimental effects worldwide.15\nIn Latin America, and in the particular case of Colombia, regional/bilateral integra-\ntion has been closely related with trade and investment and therefore CAN regulations\nhave been modified in order to allow the signature of FTAs by their member states. In\ncontrast, UNASUR has been trying to propose regional measures seeking to protect the\nright to health at the regional level, for example, by the proposal to create the Banco de\nPrecios de Medicamentos, but these proposals still lack implementation. New regional\nintegration groups such as the Pacific Alliance are again more focalized on commerce\nthan the UNASUR, and members of the Alliance have been more active in the promotion\nof FTAs than the other members of the UNASUR. This explains why the Alliance does\nnot have any measure concerning health issues, but on the contrary, they seek to\nstrengthen the IPR regimes of its member states. However, Colombia made some reser-\nvations to the treaty with respect to its regulatory competences in the area of social ser-\nvices such as health.16\nAt the level of the FTAs, the case of Colombia illustrates how the judiciary is trying\nto respect ICESCR and the guidelines of the Committee, but, at the same time, it does not\noppose public policies aligned with trade liberalization. Although defenders of FTAs\nargue that the new generation FTAs include some conditionality related to the duty to\nrespect human rights in general (HRC, 2013: 94), this view contrasts with the concluding\npotential negative effects of the FTAs, by referring concretely to the COL-US FTAprovi-\nsions on IPR, because it might increase the price of medicines and affect the right to\nhealth. For this reason, the UNESC Council urged Colombia to take measures to ensure\nthe compliance with ESCR duties in all FTAs as well as to enforce policies to protect\nthese rights against the negative impact of the agreements, thereby concretely referring\nto the price of medicines.\nThe next sections further analyze how the new generation FTAs have clearly played a\nrole in the scope and accessibility to health services and how some regional organiza-\ntions, despite their good intentions, have also been subordinated to the binding rules of\nFTAs concerning the protection and enlargement of IPR at the cost of the right to health.\nAndean Community (CAN)\nAs early as 1971, the Andean Health Organism (ORAS-CONHU)17 was created as an\nintergovernmental institution, seeking to develop coordinated actions to grant the right to\nhealth. In 1999, the Andean Social Charter sought to find a compromise among member\nstates on the universalization of all rights, including ESCR. The charter also promoted\nthe non-privatization of the basic health services, the use of traditional medicine, and\ninternational cooperation in the prioritization of health programs. In 2012, the Andean\nParliament sought to give it binding character, but until now it remains a declaration of\nintentions.\nCAN member states have also been working with Mercosur and the Amazonian\nCooperation Treaty Organization (OTCA)18 to develop a South American agenda19\nwhich is mainly being conducted by the UNASUR.20 The scope and impact of these\nforms of regional cooperation are not clear (Ort\u00edz et al., 2011). So far, concrete common\nhealth policies of the UNASUR have not necessarily materialized and are not necessarily\nvery visible at the level of the member states.\nCAN, by contrast, is being recognized as a pioneer regional integration group in regu-\nlating IPR issues at the regional level. However, it has institutionally been affected by the\nsignature of FTAs by Colombia and Peru, countries that promoted prior reforms required\nfor this purpose (Helfer and Alter, 2014). The communitarian IPR regime has therefore\nbeen adapted to the parameters of the United States and the EU FTAs, which constitutes\na threat to the enforcement of the right to health to the benefit of IPR for trade partners.\nThe first step in the institutional change was taken when Decision 598/2004 revoked\nDecision 322/93 to allow FTA negotiations by member states with third countries. Then,\nthe reforms to the Andean IPR regime were actively promoted by Colombia and Peru\nbecause the Andean Tribunal of Justice (ATJ) had clearly ruled that CAN law is binding\nfor member states, including for international treaties signed by them. The ATJ held that\npatent registration of proof data for medicines would threaten free competition but also\nthe right to access to medicines because it may be a way to extending patents (Ruling\nDecision 486/0021 and left each member state the choice of whether to protect proof data,\nincluding by preventing third party commercialization based on proof data information.\nThis reform sought to validate a regulation of the Colombian government concerning the\nexclusive protection of test data rejected by the ATJ (Helfer and Alter, 2014). In fact, the\nprotection of proof data has been incorporated into the FTAs that Colombia signed with\nthe United States (16) and with the EU (231), a rule that has been seen as an obstacle for\nthe production of generic medicines (Wolfram, 2011, quoted by Saura Estap\u00e0, 2013).\nBolivia which challenged the new decision before the ATJ.22 This reform was proposed\nby Peru to facilitate FTA negotiations with the United States and sought to allow member\nstates to develop some IPR through national legislation, taking into account socioeco-\nnomic asymmetries and multilateral standards.23\nIn short, despite the institutional crisis of the CAN, the binding character of its IPR\nregulations is not a matter of discussion,24 and national powers are due to apply it, includ-\ning the judicial branch. Preliminary rulings are often used by national tribunals of\nmember states, and the rulings of the ATJ are part of the legal system. Helfer and Alter\naround 97% of their total preliminary rulings and Colombia is recognized as the most\nactive member of the Andean Community in IPR protection. In fact, it is the most active\nmember state in referring cases to the ATJ (around 2/3 of the ATJ preliminary rulings on\nIPR).25 Helfer and Alter (2014) found that intellectual property (IP) administrative agen-\ncies supported by the ATJ have tried to balance IPR in favor of access to medicines, but\nwith the pressures of the TRIPS and the Colombian and Peruvian FTAs, this position is\nbeing weakened at the cost of public health in these countries.\nNew generation FTAs and the right to health\nTensions between FTAs signed by Colombia with both the United States (2006) and the\nEU (2012), on one hand, and the protection of the right to health, on the other, have\nmainly been related with higher protection of IPR vis-a-vis TRIPS.26 Although this\nshould be a policy discussion, in Colombia the judiciary has been implicated in the anal-\nysis of these issues, giving in general a higher rank to the right to health than IPR by\nmeans of the constitutional control of statutes approving the FTAs by the Congress.27\nThe Court upheld all recently signed FTAs but clarifying that the authorities in charge\nof the execution and enforcement of FTAs are constitutionally bound and that their acts\nare subject to administrative and/or judicial control. This means that the effective consti-\ntutionality control should be realized when enforced. Constitutional competences of\nnational authorities to control the execution of the FTA remain therefore unaltered, and\nif the application of the FTA violates fundamental rights (as the right to health), it can be\nchallenged, which seems not totally compatible with the principle of pacta sunt servanda\nConstitutional case law on FTAs had a strong focus on human rights with particular\nreference to the right to life and the right to health. This way, Sanitary and Phytosanitary\n(SPS) measures were upheld because they sought the protection of health in accordance\nwith international treaties (e.g. WTO-SPS measures) and with constitutional regulations\n(consumer protection, right to a healthy environment, duty of the State to provide public\nhealth services, protection of the environment and food production). IPR were linked to\nthe binding commitments concerning public health, biodiversity, traditional knowledge,\nand the duty to adhere to some pending international conventions besides the interna-\ntional framework whose main parameters are the TRIPS of the WTO, the World\nIntellectual Property Organization (WIPO) treaties, and the CAN regulations. Therefore,\npatent registration is subject to these international treaties (Lizarazo et al., 2014).\nAlthough the Court found all the international commitments on IPR rights constitu-\ntional, it emphasized the potential and actual impact of IPR on fundamental rights, and\ntherefore, it held that FTAs should be enforced and interpreted according to the\nConstitutional Bloc,28 particularly regarding the right to health, the right to a healthy and\ndiverse environment, and the social goals of the State. Against the arguments in favor of\nsetting aside the US FTA, the Court did not refer to the challenges regarding WTO+\nclauses that may affect public health, but in exchange, it held that FTAs can be consid-\nered as instruments for the enforcement of the cited rights.29 And in any case, the Court\nmaintained that public policies may exclude the patentability of inventions to protect\nhigher constitutional or international interests as health, life of living organisms, and the\nAlthough the COL-EU FTA has even been more controversial, the Court upheld it.30\nDuring the negotiations, this agreement was accused of strengthening IPR with negative\nconsequences for public health and for free competition. Some initial assessments found\nit stricter than other FTAs, closer to the EU legislation, and without the flexibility\naccorded in the TRIPS and the Doha Declaration (Ifarma and Fundaci\u00f3n Misi\u00f3n Salud,\nWhen revising the COL-EU FTA, the Court held that the parameters of the Doha\nDeclaration are to be applied by the states-parties and that they should respect and imple-\nment the Global Strategy and Plan ofAction on Public Health, Innovation, and Intellectual\nProperty (GSPA-PHI) of 2008 of the WHO which seeks to avoid IPR abuses but also to\navoid restrictive measures to trade and the promotion of technology transfer. When ana-\nlyzing this FTA, the Court was less explicit in the higher hierarchy of the right to health\nvis-a-vis IPR. Concerning the regulation of patents, the Court clarified that the adhesion\nto the Budapest Treaty (Patent Treaty) is a requirement for Peru and Colombia. In addi-\ntion, the compensation mechanism in case of a `non-reasonable reduction' of the dead-\nline of pharmaceutical patents as a result of the first commercialization of the product\nwas upheld by the Court. Concerning the protection of proof data and other issues related\nto the security and effectiveness of pharmaceutical products, the Court upheld them\nbased on the argument that these issues have already been analyzed in other international\nagreements.\nAlthough the final text presented some improvements (i.e. references to the Doha\nDeclaration and to the GSPA-PHI), the Court avoided any discussion concerning patents\non pharmaceutical products. As also observed by Seuba and Garc\u00eda (2010), the COL-EU\nFTA is `TRIPS-plus' and the rules of observance seem to be stricter than the ones of the\nUS FTA. In this case, the Court, despite its recognized activism in defense of human\nrights, avoided any analysis on clauses with potential detrimental effects on public health\nto Colombia as they seek to give a stricter protection to IPR on pharmaceutical products\nthan the WTO rules, the CAN rules (cf. Decision 689/2008), and even rulings analyzing\nthe COL-US FTA (see also Seuba and Garc\u00eda, 2010).\napplications increased by almost 52% with a notorious relevance of the pharmaceutical\nsector and other related sectors of medical devices. It is also the country that has the larg-\nest demand for trademarks in the CAN, with pharmaceutical and other medical-related\ntrademarks prominently present (Ram\u00edrez, 2012: 31\u00ad33). In addition, new constitutional\nand statutory parameters of the price control of medicines upheld by the Court in 2014\ncould be considered as a non-accomplishment of FTA IPR clauses. However, the Court\nomitted to make the link between the FTA's patent regulations and the constitutional\nregulation of price control of medicines.\nLooking at the US FTA, Colombia has been systematically placed on the Watch List31\nof the Special 301 Report of the United States. In 2014, some progress in the protection\nof IPR was recognized, but the role of the Court is starting to be a concern as it affirms\nthat earlier progress on IPR legislation was reversed in 2013 when the Colombian\nConstitutional Court invalidated on procedural grounds the law enacting many IPR-\nrelated commitments made under the United States-Colombia Trade Promotion\nAgreement (CTPA). Also of concern for the USTA were Colombia's limitations on the\npatentability of certain pharmaceuticals and challenges related to pharmaceutical and\nCourt for the price control of medicines and the issue of bio-similar medicines will cer-\ntainly be an issue for the next report as well as the more flexible analysis of the EU FTA\non these issues.\nAn important issue is how the WIPO, the United States, the EU, and the industry are\nsystematically promoting technical assistance and capacity building on IPR to national\nauthorities (including the judiciary) seeking a better enforcement of FTAs (Abbott, 2007:\ncould also incline the balance in favor of IPR, at the cost of ESCR, which are currently\nhighly protected by some Latin American courts.\nConclusion\nOur hypothesis that the protection of ESCR, and more concretely the right to health,\ndepends also importantly on the will and capacity of national (judicial) actors to give\nbinding character to international and constitutional rules and to address policy failures\nhas been supported by the empirical evidence from the Colombian case, where rights-\nbased judicial adjudication has been crucial. Evidence also suggests that these national\nactors are only directly supported by the UN, which is highly committed to the universal\nenforcement of the ICESCR.\nThe new generation FTAs seek to strengthen the position of IPR holders mainly by an\nenlargement of the TRIPS and a progressive weakening of the Doha Declaration on Public\nHealth, despite the discourse of adopting it as well as the GSPA-PHI (Roffe and\nmously upheld all the FTAs, it also promotes the use of constitutional actions against rules\nthat would enforce FTAs when they violate the Constitutional Bloc. This position has\nbeen less radical when analyzing the COL-EU FTA. But when potential retaliatory meas-\nures against Colombia for not complying with an FTA would be proposed, will human\nrights rules be considered as an acceptable argument to ignore the FTA commitments?\nThe Court did not systematically analyze the potential conflict between FTAs and\nWTO+ or the CAN rules on ESCR issues, in strong contrast with the academic literature\nand political discourses. Contradictorily, it found that FTAs are constitutional because\nthey respect the WTO and the CAN regulations even if it argued that the constitutional\nanalysis of FTAs does not refer to the compatibility among international rules.\nOur article sought to highlight the role of the judiciary (i.e. the Court, and to a lesser\nextent the ATJ) in the enforcement of ESCR. Although they uphold public policies on\ntrade liberalization and structural adjustments, they enforce ESCR by giving them preva-\nlence over these policies. However, it should be admitted that case law is not the ideal\nway to regulate public policies on health and that case law of the Court has failures with\nrespect to the technical aspects of trade liberalization and IPR issues. In a way, case law\nseems also to fill the gaps left by absent health impact assessments (Lee et al., 2007).\nSo far, regional organizations to which Colombia belongs do not seem to have\nweighed heavily when it comes to the protection of the right to health. The role of the\nCAN in balancing free trade and health principles has been marginal, despite the case\nlaw of the ATJ. Although the ATJ supported IP administrative agencies in their attempts\nto balance IPR in favor of access to medicines (Helfer and Alter, 2014), recent develop-\nments (TRIPS and the Colombian and Peruvian FTAs) do not seem to lead in that direc-\ntion. The UNASUR has been trying to go further on these issues, but has still some way\nto go to arrive at concrete and measurable actions. It remains to be seen whether the\nremarkable position of the judiciary in the protection of the right to health will be weak-\nened by the proposed training of judges on IPR issues, which may be an attempt to con-\ntrol judicial activism on human rights.\nRegional integration policies in Latin America should try to fill gaps in the fields\nwhere the member states independently lack capacities, such as the improvement and\ncoverage of health care in border regions, but also with respect to innovation chains\nseeking technological progress in pharmaceutical and treatment areas in order to be less\ndependent on multinationals and to reach reasonable prices of medicines not only by\nmeans of price controls and patent limits.\nEuropean and US human rights conditionality in FTAs refers mostly to first-genera-\ntion rights, not to ESCR, promoting clauses with potential negative effects of certain\nIPR-related clauses on the enjoyment of the ESCR by the trading partners' populations.\nNew generation FTAs, mainly promoted by these economic blocks, tend to restrict the\nflexibility of the TRIPS and the related Doha Declaration, but they can also be seen as a\ndisintegrating factor as in the case of CAN by eliminating regional rules that limited IPR\nto the benefit of social policies of the member states and as in the case of the ongoing\ncompetition between integration models (Pacific Alliance vs UNASUR).\nA final \u00ad more general \u00ad conclusion refers to the implications of our analysis for the\nemerging field of global and regional health policy and health governance studies. This litera-\nture is convincing in its normative theorizing, but its empirical analyses might sometimes\nsuffer from selection biases. The observed global or regional policy developments that cor-\nroborate normative positions in favor of more policy intervention at those levels are not\nalways very deep and are sometimes (over-)compensated by global or regional health-related\ndevelopments in other policy areas (e.g. trade) or within overlapping regional arrangements.\n"
