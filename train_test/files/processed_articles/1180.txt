Brezausek,2 MS, and Jay Belsky,3 PHD\n1Department of Psychology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, 2Center for Educational\nAccountability, University of Alabama at Birmingham, and 3Birkbeck University of London\nObjective To investigate the effect of quantity and quality of early child care on children's\nrisk for unintentional injury. Methods A diverse cohort of 1,225 children was recruited\nfrom several sites in the United States and followed from birth until first grade. Quantity and\nquality of child care from birth until entry into kindergarten were used to predict unintentional\ninjuries from age 6 months until first grade. Measures from an evaluation at 6 months of age\nwere tested as covariates. Results Children who spent more time in nonparental childcare\nenvironments were at slightly reduced risk for unintentional injury after controlling for child\n(gender, temperament), family [socioeconomic status (SES)], parent (positive parenting), and\nchild care (quality of care) characteristics. Conclusions We discuss possible explanations\nfor the results, including the possibilities that childcare center environments are safer than the\nhomes of most preschoolers or that attendance in child care is nonrandom.\nKey words child care; children; injuries; safety.\nNearly 65% of 3- through 5-year-old American chil-\ndren--just under 8 million youngsters--spends their\nweekdays in childcare settings outside the home\n(Cohen, 2001). Recent efforts have documented a range\nof both positive and negative behavioral and mental\nhealth outcomes for children who spend significant por-\ntions of their early development in a childcare setting\n2003). Surprisingly, only a limited amount of empirical\nresearch has considered the effect of child care on chil-\ndren's risk for the leading cause of mortality among pre-\nschool-aged children, unintentional injuries.\nUnintentional injuries kill more American children,\nages 1\u00ad4, than the next several leading causes of death\ncombined (National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)\nVital Statistics System, 2001; National Safety Council,\n2001) and have been described by many authorities as a\nnational health care priority (e.g., National Center for\nInjury Prevention and Control, 2002; Sleet & Bryn,\n2003). Psychological and epidemiological research have\nidentified many risk factors for injury among preschool-\ners--among the strongest predictors are male gender,\nimpulsive or undercontrolled temperament, and inade-\nquate parenting or supervision (e.g., Brehaut, Miller,\niello, in press; Schwebel & Barton, in press; Schwebel &\nreviews)--but just a few empirical studies have com-\npared injury risk in young children attending child care\nversus those cared for at home. Results of those studies\nwere mixed. Most compared risk to children in child\ncare during the hours they were at childcare centers ver-\nsus risk to children not attending child care during the\nhours they were at home. In the earliest, such research,\nRivara and colleagues found injury risk was lower for\nchildren ages 5 and under in childcare centers than it\nwas for their counterparts cared for at home (Rivara,\nDiGuiseppi, Thompson, & Calonge, 1989). More recent\nreports replicated this finding for minor injuries among\nAll correspondence concerning this article should be addressed to David C.

Injury risk to\nchildren in family day care settings rather than childcare\ncenters has been examined in one empirical study\n(Kotch et al., 1997). The results indicated greatly\nreduced risk for children in family day care settings, but\nthe study's authors expressed concern about sampling\nbiases and recommended caution in interpreting results.\nJust one study compared overall risk of injury--that\nis, injury risk regardless of where the injury occurred--\nin children who attend child care compared to children\nwho do not attend child care (Gunn, Pinsky, Sacks, &\nSchonberger, 1991). In that study, random-digit tele-\nphone dialing was used to sample 1,775 households with\nchildren under age 5. As in other work, risk of injury for\nchildren attending child care during the time at child\ncare was lower than that of children not attending child\ncare during the time at home. However, children who\nattended child care had a slightly higher overall risk for\ninjury than did children who did not attend child care.\nBecause children who attended child care had a higher\nrisk of injury during the time they were at home than did\nchildren who did not attend child care, the overall risk\nfor injury was actually higher among those children who\nattended child care (Gunn et al., 1991).\nTogether, available evidence tentatively indicates\nthat childcare attendance might decrease children's risk\nfor injury while in child care but increase children's\noverall risk for injury. Several questions remain unan-\nswered. First, excepting the study by Gunn and col-\nleagues, there is little information on overall risk for\ninjury among children who attend or do not attend child\ncare. Ecological theories suggest time spent in one contex-\ntual environment affects behavior in other environments\n(Bronfenbrenner, 1977), so in this study, we considered\nchildren's overall risk for injury rather than focusing on\nonly the time at a childcare center. Second, excepting the\nstudy by Kotch et al. (1997) which admits sampling\nbiases, there is no information on risk for injury to chil-\ndren cared for in family day care settings.\nThird, there is little information on the effect of\nchild care on injury risk in large national samples.\nPrevious work (Kopjar & Wickizer, 1996; Kotch et al.,\nsamples. Fourth, previous work focused only on atten-\ndance at child care without considering the important\nvariable of the quality of that child care (Alkon et al.,\n2000). In this report, researchers considered not just\ntime in child care but also the quality of the childcare\nsetting. Fifth, and perhaps most critical, previous work\nfailed to control for anticipated effects of child behavior\nand family factors on injury. In this report, we con-\ntrolled for child temperament, family poverty, and\nmaternal parenting strategies.\nWe had two primary hypotheses. First, based on\nthe results from Gunn et al. (1991), we hypothesized\nchildren who spend more time in child care might have\nincreased overall risk of unintentional injury. Second,\nwe hypothesized that this effect would be moderated\nby quality of child care: children in high-quality child-\ncare centers might have somewhat lower risk of injury\ncompared with those in lower quality centers after\ncontrolling for potential child and family mediating\nfactors.\nMethods\nData Source and Participants\nData came from the National Institute of Child Health\nand Human Development (NICHD) Study of Early\nChild Care, a longitudinal investigation of the effects of\nearly child care on children's development. Participants\nwere recruited from 31 hospitals located in or near 10 US\ncities (Little Rock, AR; Irvine, CA; Lawrence, KS; Boston,\nMA; Morganton, NC; Philadelphia, PA; Pittsburgh, PA;\nCharlottesville, VA; Seattle, WA; Madison, WI). During\nbirth were visited in the hospital. Of these, 5,416 met\nthe study's eligibility criteria (briefly, English-speaking\nmothers age 18 or over who planned not to put children\nup for adoption, not to relocate in the next year, and\nwho lived in safe and accessible neighborhoods for\nresearch; for details, see NICHD Early Child Care\nResearch Network, 2000). A subset of this group was\nselected in accordance with a conditional-random sam-\npling plan designed to ensure recruited families reflected\nthe economic, educational, and ethnic diversity of the\ncatchment area at each site. When the infants were 1\nenrolled in the longitudinal study (see NICHD Early\nstudy design and recruitment, including informed con-\nsent procedures).\nOf the 1,364 families who took part in the NICHD\nStudy of Early Child Care, data from 1,225 are reported\nin this study. Missing cases arose for a variety of reasons.\nSeveral families did not participate in the mother\u00adchild\ninteraction (n = 92) or the Infant/Toddler HOME Inven-\ntory (n = 85); some failed to provide family income\n186 Schwebel, Brezausek, and Belsky\ninformation (n = 93); and many failed to consistently\nrespond to inquiries about children's injury history (n =\n92). If any of this information was missing, the family\nwas dropped from all analyses.\nIndependent samples t tests were used to compare\nthe sample reported at present with the sample with\nmissing data on all variables reported in regression anal-\nyses. Just two differences emerged, both concerning the\nchildcare variables. The sample included in the analyses\nwas cared for in childcare centers (M = 8.12 hr/week, SD =\n9.73) for more hours than the sample that was dropped\nThe sample of 1,225 families reported at present was\nfollowed longitudinally until first grade. It included 624\n12% African American, and 7% other ethnicities. Mothers\nMeasures\nMany measures were chosen from the NICHD Early\nChild Care Study data for this analysis, as detailed\nbelow.\nChild Gender\nParents reported child gender during the 1-month\nassessment period.\nFamily SES\nSES of the family was approximated by using an income\nto needs ratio. Income was based on the entire income of\nall members of the family living in the same household.\nNeeds were based on the poverty threshold during the\nyear of measurement, the number of people in the\nhousehold, and the number of children in the household\n(see Bilbrey, Batten, Appelbaum, & Wendell, 1994 for\ndetails).\nChild Activity and Affect During Mother\u00adChild\nInteraction\nChildren's activity and affect were measured at 6 months\nof age during the course of a 15-min semistructured,\nmother\u00adchild interaction session that was videotaped for\nsubsequent coding. During the first half of the session,\nmothers played with their infants, by using toys of their\nown choosing. During the second half, a standard set of\ntoys was provided by the experimenter for the mother to\nengage the infant. Three measures of interest for this\nreport were coded by trained observers watching video-\ntapes of the interaction: activity level, positive mood,\nand negative mood (Appelbaum, Batten, & Wendell,\n1994; reliability of coders was adequate, rs ranged from\nMaternal Parenting Behavior\nMaternal parenting behavior was assessed by using the\nInfant/Toddler HOME Inventory (Bradley & Caldwell,\n1988), which was administered when children were\n6 months of age. Observers visited the home, inter-\nviewed mothers, and made binary decisions concerning\nvarious aspects of the home environment and maternal\nbehavior decisions were made based on observations\nduring the visit and mother's answers to questions dur-\ning the interview. A series of factor analyses conducted\nby the NICHD Early Child Care team yielded a three-\nfactor solution. Of particular interest for this study was\nthe factor labeled \"positive involvement\" which included\nsix items from the measure (Little, Appelbaum, Batten,\n& Wendell, 1994). Example items include \"parent spon-\ntaneously vocalizes to child at least twice\" and \"parent's\nvoice conveys positive feelings toward child.\"\nChild Care Attendance and Quality\nChildcare attendance was measured based on parent report\nduring regular phone calls or interviews every 3\u00ad4 months.\nParents reported the average number of hours per week\ntheir children were in various types of childcare situ-\nations. For the purposes of this study, maternal\nresponses were aggregated into three categories: child\ncare in a childcare center (i.e., child care in a setting\ndesigned specifically for the care of children, with sev-\neral staff members and many children); child care in a\nfamily day care setting (i.e., child care in an individual's\nhome, typically with one caregiver and few children);\nand other childcare arrangements (most typically care\nby the parents or other relatives of the child). In gen-\neral, the childcare centers children attended were\nlicensed by local or state authorities (e.g., 99% of cen-\nters attended during the 6-month assessment were\nlicensed) but the family day care centers were not (only\n15% of family day care centers children attended at the\n6-month assessment were licensed by the state or com-\nmunity, registered with the city or county as a childcare\nprovider, or belonged to a group that organized family\nday care in the local area).\nTwo childcare attendance variables were of particu-\nlar interest for this report: the average number of hours\nper week children spent in childcare centers and the\naverage number of hours per week children spent in\nfamily day care environments, both of them computed\nfrom birth until age 5 and set to 0 if children did not\nspend any time in those environments. This method of\ncomputation was deemed most accurate, but created a\nsituation whereby children might have non-zero scores\non both variables. That is, a child who spent an average\nof 20 hr per week in family day care and 10 hr per week\nin a childcare center would receive non-zero scores for\neach variable and would be included in analyses based\non both those scores. Similarly, a child who changed\ntype of childcare attendance during development (e.g.,\nattended family day care while ages 1 and 2 and\nswitched to a childcare center from ages 3 through 5)\nmight receive scores on both variables based on the\naverage time across early childhood that he or she was in\neach type of childcare arrangement.\nMeasures of childcare quality were available via the\naverage of several variables from the Observational\nRecord of the Caregiving Environment (ORCE), an\nobservational rating of the childcare environment. The\nORCE was performed at both childcare centers and family\nday care environments on five occasions: when chil-\nthose five occasions, childcare environments were rated\nin 10-min intervals at least twice; a wide range of char-\nacteristics were coded. For this study, two measures\nwere standardized and averaged to generate an overall\nassessment of childcare quality. First, a composite\n\"total quality\" variable that was itself composed of the\naverage of five variables was considered. The five com-\nponents of the total quality measure were ratings of the\ncaregiver's sensitivity to nondistress, the caregiver's\ndetachment (reversed), the caregiver's stimulation of\ndevelopment, the caregiver's positive regard, and the\ncaregiver's flatness of affect (reversed). Second,\nresearchers considered the observer's overall rating of\nchildcare quality, a rating that was made on a 5-point\nscale with a higher score representing a better rating.\nThe two measures of childcare quality correlated\nscores were computed for the purposes of this analysis,\nthe average quality of care children experienced during\ntheir time in childcare centers between birth and age 5\nand the average quality of care children experienced\nduring their time in family day care centers between\nbirth and age 5. These values were set to 0 if data were\nmissing (most frequently because children did not\nspend time in the setting of interest).\nInjury History\nMothers reported their children's history of injuries\nrequiring professional medical attention on a quarterly\nbasis, either through telephone interviews or during\nscheduled home visits by experimenters. For the pur-\nposes of this study, all injuries of children when 6\u00ad60\nmonths of age were summed to create a single measure\nof injury history. Injuries were summed across the full\nstudy period (ages 6\u00ad60 months) for two primary rea-\nsons. First, a sizable developmental period was necessary\nto provide sufficient variance in the dependent variable\nfor a regression equation. If injury risk was examined\nover shorter developmental periods, statistical variance\nwould be lost. Second, we wished to examine how child\ncare influences children's risk for injury throughout early\ndevelopment. Tendency to be injured is a relatively stable\nindividual difference across development--that is, chil-\ndren who engage in injury risk behaviors at age 2 are also\nSchwebel & Plumert, 1999)--so we felt it appropriate to\nconsider risk throughout early childhood rather than\nacross shorter developmental stages.\nData Analysis Plan\nThe analysis plan consisted of four steps. First, descrip-\ntive statistics were considered for all variables of inter-\nest. Second, a correlation matrix was constructed to test\nhow predictors related to each other and how predictor\nvariables related to children's injuries. Third, to test the\nprimary hypothesis, we constructed two Poisson regres-\nsion equations. One tested the role of childcare centers\nin children's risk for injury and the other tested the role\nof family-based care in children's risk for injury. Last,\nrelative risk and percent attributable risk were com-\nputed to offer an epidemiological approach to interpret-\ning findings.\nResults\nDescriptive Analyses\nDescriptive statistics for all variables of interest are\nshown in Table I. Over the 54-month study period, children\ninjuries requiring professional medical attention.\nChildren were more likely to be injured at age 1\nOverall, 698 children in the sample reported no injuries\nbetween age 6 months and the end of first grade; 347\nreported one injury, 122 reported two injuries, and 58\nreported between three and six injuries.\n188 Schwebel, Brezausek, and Belsky\nCorrelation Matrix\nTable I also includes a correlation matrix. Several of the\nstatistically significant correlations were anticipated.\nThe three measures of child affect related to each other,\nfor example (activity level correlated .26 with positive\nmood and \u00ad.10 with negative mood; positive mood\ncorrelated \u00ad.28 with negative mood; all ps < .01). The\nincome:needs ratio was related to maternal parenting (r =\nand 0.21, ps < .01, respectively) and family day care (r =\nHours and quality of child care correlated negatively\nwith each other, r = \u00ad0.14, p < .01, for childcare centers\nand r = \u00ad0.06, p < .05, for family day care centers.\nOf particular interest in Table I were correlations\nbetween children's injuries and the other measures. Not sur-\nprisingly, injury history correlated with gender (r = \u00ad0.09,\np < .01), with boys injured more than girls; activity level (r =\n0.07, p < .05), with more active infants injured more; and\nwith positive mood (r = 0.07, p < .05), with more \"positive\"\ninfants injured more. Though effect sizes were small, these\nanticipated associations provide validational evidence for\nthe measure of injury used in this inquiry. Contrary to the\nprimary hypothesis, children who spent more time in child-\ncare centers (r = \u00ad0.06, p < .05) and in family day care envi-\nronments (r = \u00ad0.07, p < .01) were modestly protected from\ninjury. There were no indications of significant relations\nbetween injuries and quality of child care.\nRegression Analyses\nThe third and primary analyses were stepwise Poisson\nregression models with a logarithmic link function pre-\ndicting unintentional injuries. As shown in Table II, two\nmodels were constructed. The only difference between\nthe models were which childcare variables were entered;\nin the first, childcare center hours and quality were\nentered and in the second, family day care hours and\nquality were entered.\nThe first two steps of each model were identical;\nchild variables were entered in the first step and parent/\nfamily variables in the second. In the first step, replicat-\ning work with other samples, male gender, high activity\nlevel, and high positive mood, all emerged as statistically\nsignificant predictors of injury risk. The addition of fam-\nily SES and maternal parenting in the second step did\nnot change the model appreciably.\nIn the third step, hours and quality of child care\nwere entered into each model. In both cases, the amount\nof time children spent in child care predicted injury risk\nin a positive manner: the more time children spent in\nchild experienced. Results provided no support for the\nmoderational hypothesis in the final step, as the interac-\ntion term did not add significantly to the model from\nEpidemiological Approach\nTable III illustrates the data using an epidemiological\napproach. Relative risk (and its 95% confidence interval)\nand percent attributable risk are displayed for each of\nthe variables in the last step of the Poisson regression\nmodels. Results reflect findings in the regressions. Male\ngender and positive mood increased risk for injury.\nTable I.

Other variables--\nmost notably activity level, negative mood, and family\nday care quality--had moderately high percent attribut-\nable risk but were not statistically significant.\nDiscussion\nResearchers continue to debate whether attending child\ncare at young ages is advantageous, detrimental, or\nimmaterial to a child's development (e.g., Belsky, 2001;\nLamb, 1998; NICHD Early Child Care Research Net-\nit is a mistake to think simply in terms of whether child\ncare is good or bad for children--and for several rea-\nsons. First, child care is not a monolithic experience,\nbut rather one that varies on several dimensions: Some\nchildren spend lots of time in child care and others little\ntime; some children experience good quality care and\nothers poor. Second, the way in which child care affects\none aspect of development may differ from how it\naffects another. For example, in the NICHD Study of\nEarly Child Care, better quality care has been found to\nbe associated with modestly enhanced cognitive and\nlinguistic functioning, whereas more time in any kind\nof child care (i.e., of good or poor quality) has been\nfound to be predictive of modestly higher but not psy-\nchopathological levels of externalizing behavior prob-\nlems (NICHD Early Child Care Research Network,\nPrevious research suggests children are at reduced\nrisk for injury while physically in a child care setting\nyounger children (Kopjar & Wickizer, 1996) and when\nminor injuries are considered (Kotch et al., 1997). We\nsought to test a different question, however: how does\nattendance at child care--both in childcare centers and\nin family day care environments--affect a child's overall\nrisk for injury, in all contextual environments they\nencounter (Bronfenbrenner, 1977). Just one study has\ntested this question previously (Gunn et al., 1991), and\nit found that children who attended child care, although\nat reduced risk for injury while at child care, were at\nincreased risk for injury overall--largely because they\nexperienced an elevated risk for injury when at home.\nWe tested our hypotheses by using a large sample, con-\ntrolling for various child and family factors that influ-\nence injury risk, and with consideration of the quality of\nchildcare settings.\nAfter controlling for child and family factors that\npredict unintentional injury by themselves (and in com-\nbination with each other), results proved contrary to\nprevious results and to predictions. In our study, chil-\ndren who spent more time in child care experienced a\nsmall but statistically significant reduction in risk for\nunintentional injuries. We could detect no evidence that\nthis effect was restricted to good quality child care (or\nthat the reverse was true when child care was of poor\nquality). This result is consistent with research on chil-\ndren's risk in childcare settings (e.g., Rivara et al., 1989)\nbut inconsistent with research on children's injury risk\noverall (Gunn et al., 1991). It proved true for children\nboth in childcare centers, most of which were licensed,\nand for those in family day care environments, most of\nwhich were not licensed.\nThese findings lead to speculation concerning why\nmore time in child care might predict slightly reduced\nrisk for injury and what aspects of childcare attendance\nmight be associated with that reduction. One possibility\nis that childcare center environments are somehow safer\nthan the homes of most preschoolers. This possibility\ncan be verified in most US childcare centers, where\nsafety of childcare centers is highly regulated (e.g., par-\nticular staff:child ratio must be maintained, staff are\ntrained on child safety issues, and hazards are absent\nfrom playgrounds, restrooms, and play areas). However,\nour findings extended beyond childcare centers to fam-\nily day care environments, which are typically not regu-\nlated in the United States (including those attended by\nchildren in this sample), and we found that more time in\nfamily day care environments also protected children\nfrom injury.\nIt may be that it is not the environment but the\nadults working with children who teach children to act\nsafely. Childcare workers--whether at childcare centers\nor in family day care environments--may somehow be\nmore protective of children's safety than parents. This\npossibility is particularly appealing given our finding\nthat children in child care had a reduced risk of injury\nacross all environmental contexts they engaged in. We\nhad hoped our investigations of the role of child care\nand parenting quality might have revealed this possibil-\nity, but it is possible that our measures of quality were\ninsufficient.\nAnother explanation for our findings has to do with\nthe fact that attendance in child care is nonrandom. It may\nbe that the types of children who attend child care influ-\nence their risk of injury. Parents who choose to send their\nchildren to child care, for any number of financial, tem-\nperamental, or interpersonal reasons, may have children\nwho are at reduced risk for injury. As an example, many\nparents who send their children to child care are likely\nto value their careers and therefore may be motivated for\nsuccess in all aspects of their lives; this motivation may\nextend to creating a safer home environment for their\nchildren. Similarly, children who attend child care may\nbe conditioned to behave in somewhat different ways\n(e.g., with more cautious exploration of unknown envi-\nronments) than children who do not attend child care,\nand these differences might influence risk for injury.\nThe fact, however, that the analyses controlled for pre-\nexisting differences between the two groups suggests\nthat selection may not be the operative factor accounting\nfor the reported results.\nWhat might we conclude? Combined with previous\nwork, our findings indicate children who attend child care\nhave a slightly reduced risk of unintentional injury. Statis-\ntical effect sizes are small, but significant; this translates\ninto minor but meaningful influences on the lives of chil-\ndren. We must entertain the possibility that our findings\nare spurious--subject to type I statistical error or peculiar-\nities of our data, particularly because they contradict with\nthe previously-reported results of Gunn et al. (1991).\nHowever, the facts that our findings were consistent for\nboth childcare centers and family day care centers, that\nthey were maintained despite controlling for a number of\nchild and family factors, and that the data came from a\nlarge national sample in a longitudinal design, suggest the\nfindings are meaningful. What remains undetermined, and\nin need of continuing investigation, is why there might be\na difference in injury risk among children in child care\nversus those not in child care.\nLimitations\nLimitations of this research should be mentioned in\nclosing. First, the amount of variance accounted for in\nour regression equations was small. This was not sur-\nprising: a wide range of intrapsychic, interpersonal, and\nenvironmental factors contribute to children's risk for\nunintentional injuries and one would not expect child-\ncare attendance to play a major role in children's risk for\ninjury. Our objective was to examine whether attendance\nin child care might be one of many contributing factors,\nnot to explain all factors that might contribute to children's\ninjury risk. Statistically speaking, we anticipated a small\neffect size and therefore required a large sample to\nachieve the modest results we did; the variance explained\nby our regression equations was of lesser interest than\nthe influence of particular variables.\nA second limitation of this investigation stems from\nthe fact that some childcare providers refused to admit\nobservers from the NICHD research team. It was the\nsense of the NICHD researchers that such settings were\nlikely to be of poorer quality, on average, than those vis-\nited, observed, and rated for quality of care. To the\nextent that this was the case, it may have undermined\nour ability to detect effects of childcare quality on injury,\neither as a main effect or a moderator of time spent in\nchild care. This is because it seems plausible that it is in\nthe poorest quality child care where children are most at\nrisk of being injured due to the inadequacy of their\nsupervision.\nThird, this study was opportunistic and exploratory.\nThe data were not collected for the explicit purpose of\nstudying the effects of child care on children's uninten-\ntional injury risk and hypotheses were created following\ndata collection. Some of the measures were not ideal.\nMany measures were based on self-report. The maternal-\nreport measure of injury exemplifies this limitation.\nAlthough parental reports of children's injuries are rea-\nsonably reliable (Pless & Pless, 1995), particularly when\nreports are collected at short (e.g., quarterly) intervals to\nreduce recall biases (Harel et al., 1994; Peterson, Harbeck,\n& Moreno, 1993), measures from secondary reporters\n(e.g., fathers) or medical providers might have validated\nthe maternal reports used. Further, mothers may not\nhave reported all their children's injuries because they\ndid not know about the injuries. In particular, it is possi-\nble that some injuries incurred at child care were not\nreported to parents and therefore resulted in a false indi-\ncation that children in child care had fewer injuries,\nalthough this possibility seems relatively unlikely\nbecause for analytic purposes, researchers tallied only\ninjuries requiring professional medical attention.\nFourth, our decision to average amount of time chil-\ndren spent in child care through development, though\nproviding a good indication of time in child care over\nlong periods of development, restricts our ability to\nexamine developmental changes over smaller periods.\nFor example, it may be that children placed in family\nday care from the age of 6 through 24 months, and then\ntransferred into a childcare center, are at great risk for\ninjury whereas children who are in a childcare center\nearly in development and then transferred into family day\ncare are not. Our analyses were designed to look at large-\nscale trends, and relied on average time in various child-\ncare settings throughout early development, but do not\ninform questions related to shorter developmental periods.\nConclusion\nResults from this study indicate attendance at child care\nmay offer a slight protection from risk for child injury.\n192 Schwebel, Brezausek, and Belsky\nFrom a public health perspective, identification of even\na small effect in the relation between time in child care\nand risk for unintentional injury is meaningful. As\nstated in our introductory paragraph, nearly 65% of 3- to\n5-year-olds in America spend their weekdays in child-\ncare settings (Cohen, 2001). Unintentional injuries are\nthe leading cause of pediatric mortality (National Safety\nCouncil, 2001) and strike with alarming frequency in\nchildcare settings (Alkon et al., 1999). Prevention of a\nsmall portion of injuries at childcare centers will affect a\nlarge number of children and their families. From the\npragmatic public health viewpoint of preventing unin-\ntentional injury, identification and subsequent preven-\ntion based on a small effect size that affects many\nchildren might be considered as vital as identification\nand subsequent prevention based on a large effect size\nthat affects few children.\n"
