Of the reported 25.8 million Americans estimated to have\ndiabetes, 26.9% are over the age of 65. In certain ethnic groups, the proportion is even higher; almost 1 in 3 older Hispanics and\nAfrican Americans and 3 out of 4 Pima Indian elders have diabetes. As per the NHANES III (Third National Health and Nutrition\nExamination) survey, the percentage of physician-diagnosed diabetes increased from 3.9% in middle-aged adults (40\u00ad49 years)\nto 13.2% in elderly adults (75 years). The higher incidence of diabetes is especially alarming considering that diabetes in itself\nincreases the risk for multiple other age-related diseases such as cancer, stroke, cardiovascular diseases, Parkinson's disease, and\nAlzheimer's disease (AD). In this review, we summarize the current evidence on how aging affects pancreatic  cell function,  cell\nmass, insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity. We also review the effects of aging on the relationship between insulin sensitivity\nand insulin secretion. Understanding the mechanisms that lead to impaired glucose homeostasis and T2D in the elderly will lead\nto development of novel treatments that will prevent or delay diabetes, substantially improve quality of life and ultimately increase\noverall life span.\n1. Introduction\nAging is an important risk factor for metabolic disorders,\nincluding obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, and type 2\ndiabetes (T2D). Diabetes and its complications remain major\ncauses of morbidity and mortality in the USA [1]. It has been\nreported that the prevalence of T2D increases with age and\ndiabetes and three quarters have diabetes or prediabetes\n[5]. The higher incidence of diabetes is especially alarming\nconsidering that diabetes in itself increases the risk for\nmultiple other age-related diseases such as cardiovascular\ndisease (CVD), atherosclerosis, stroke, Alzheimer disease\n(AD), Parkinson's disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease\n(NAFLD), and cancer [6]. The pathogenesis of T2D in aging\nis characterized by two major features: peripheral insulin\nresistance and impaired insulin secretion from  cells [7].\nHere, we review how aging predisposes to diabetes and\nimpaired glucose tolerance through effects on insulin secre-\ntion and insulin action.\n2. Aging and Insulin Secretion\nAge-related defects in insulin secretion have been demon-\nstrated in rodents as well as humans. Glucose and amino\nacid are major stimuli for insulin release from the pancreatic\n cell. With aging, there is a decrease in insulin secretion\nfollowing stimulation with glucose as well as amino acid argi-\nnine [8]. Decrease in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion\n(GSIS) in vivo has been shown in rodents using the state-\nof-the-art hyperglycemic clamps [9]. In humans, disorderly\ninsulin release, a decrease in insulin pulse amplitudes, and\ndecreased response to glucose oscillations as well as alter-\nations in insulin clearance have all been demonstrated [10].\nWhen the insulin secretory defects are superimposed over an\nincreased need for insulin as in old age, impaired glucose\n2  \nhomeostasis, glucose intolerance, and diabetes can result.\nWe have demonstrated in rodent models that older rodents\nare unable to increase insulin secretion in proportion to the\nincreased demands imposed by insulin resistance [9], thus\ncontributing to impaired glucose tolerance. Similarly, studies\nin humans have demonstrated a secretory defect that is con-\nsistently observed even after controlling for insulin action.\nMany factors contribute to the decrease in insulin secretion\nin aging, including the age-associated loss of Sirt1-mediated\nGSIS [11], decreased -cell sensitivity to circulating incretins\n[10], age-associated decrease in mitochondrial function, as\nwell as increased oxidative stress [12]. In this section of\nthe review, we will specifically address age-related decline\nin various aspects of -cell function and mass that could\ncontribute to the observed defects in insulin secretion.\n2.1. Aging and Glucose Stimulated Insulin Secretion. Insulin,\nsecreted from pancreatic  cells, is the major hormone in reg-\nulating glucose homeostasis. The secretion of insulin from \ncells is a complex process involving the integration of multi-\nple stimuli, such as nutrients, hormones, neurotransmitters,\nand drugs, but the primary stimulus for insulin secretion\nis circulating glucose. Aging is associated with a marked\ndecline in GSIS in both humans and rodents [13, 14] and\nthe impairment of GSIS is one of the hallmarks of T2D\n[15]. It is widely accepted that there are five important\nand \"regulatable\" steps involved in glucose-induced insulin\nsecretion (as shown in Figure 1): (1) glucose is transported\ninto the  cells through the translocation of the glucose\ntransporters (GLUTs), especially GLUT2; (2) generation of\nATP through the oxidation of glucose; (3) elevation the ratio\nof ATP/ADP induces closure of cell-surface ATP-sensitive K+\n(KATP) channels, leading to cell membrane depolarization;\n(4) extracellular Ca2+ influx into the  cell; (5) a rise in\ncytosolic Ca2+ triggering the exocytosis of insulin granules.\nWe will systematically address how aging affects each of these\nprocesses.\n2.1.1. Aging and Glucose Transporters in  Cells. As shown\nin Figure 1, initiation of the glucose transport is the first\nstep that links glucose metabolism to insulin release in the\n cell. GLUT2 is the major glucose transporter expressed in\npancreatic  cells and ensures large bidirectional fluxes of\nglucose and other dietary sugars, such as fructose and gal-\nactose, in and out the cell due to its low affinity and high\ncapacity. Glucose transport is an earlier event in GSIS. Loss\nof pancreatic -cell GLUT2 expression in humans is associ-\nated with hyperglycemia and impaired GSIS [16], and the\nloss of GSIS directly correlates with decreased expression of\nthe  cell GLUT2 in several rodent T2D models [16]. Hou\net al. observed that high extracellular glucose concentrations\nenhance GLUT2 endocytosis, which leads to the insulin\nsecretion in GLUT2 overexpressed -cell line [17]. However,\nthe internalized GLUT2 protein undergoes rapid degradation\ninduced by chronic high-glucose stimulation, which indi-\ncates that hyperglycemia directly affects  cells function [17].\nMoreover, mice lacking GLUT2 in pancreatic  cell display\nan almost complete absence of first phase glucose stimulated\ninsulin secretion [16]. Taken together, these studies suggest\nthat GLUT2 is essential for GSIS and lack of GLUT2\ncauses hyperglycemia. GLUT2 expression was diminished in\nvery old animals compared with juvenile and adult rhesus\nmonkeys [18], implying the potential connection between\nage and GLUT2 expression level. Age-associated decrease\nin expression of GLUT2 has been demonstrated in aged\nrodent models along with other  cell specific genes [19]. The\nstudy by Ohneda et al. shows that GLUT2 is underexpressed\nwith increased age; however, neither the magnitude of the\nunderexpression of GLUT2 nor of the reduction in GLUT2\ntransport function in islets of Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats is\nsufficient by itself to explain the profound reduction in GSIS\n[20]. Compared to rodents, recent evidence demonstrates\nthat human  cells express three glucose transporters,\nGLUT3 may introduce differences in the regulation of\nglucose sensing in humans versus rodent islets.\n2.1.2. Effects of Age on -Cell Glucose Oxidation. After uptake\ninto  cells, glucose undergoes oxidation and eventually gen-\nerates ATP in cytosol and mainly mitochondria via the citric\nacid cycle also known as the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle,\nor the Krebs cycle (Figure 1). In the pancreatic  cells, glucose\noxidation results in the increase of ATP production which\nis required for insulin secretion. Islets from T2D patients\nexhibit lower ATP content and blunted GSIS, implicating the\nmitochondria in the pathogenesis of  cell dysfunction [22].\nThe metabolism of glucose is initiated by its phosphorylation\nby glucokinase (GCK), a member of a family of evolutionary\nand structurally related hexokinases. The reaction catalyzed\nby GCK is the first reaction in glycolysis as well as the\nfirst rate-limiting reaction in the metabolism of glucose\n[23]. GCK mRNA level is markedly decreased in diabetic\ncompared to the normal rats. The gene expression level of\nGCK was significantly increased with age in healthy rats\n[24], suggesting a potential mechanism by which  cells\nattempt to overcome age-associated glucose intolerance and\ninsulin resistance. Interestingly, there is evidence to show that\nglucose oxidation rates are lower in older animals [25]. By\nfrom pancreases of 2-month and 12-month-old rats, G. M.\nReaven and P. D. Reaven demonstrated that the amount of\nglucose converted to CO2 by islets from 12-month-old rats\nwas only half that of 2-month-old rats [25]. In humans, there\nis a lower glucose oxidation but higher lipid oxidation rates\nin elderly than in the young, suggesting that an enhanced\nRandle cycle may play a major role in producing a reduction\nin insulin-mediated glucose oxidation [26].\nMacDonald has pointed out that pancreatic islets contain\n40\u00ad70 times the activity of mitochondrial glycerophosphate\ndehydrogenase (GPDH) compared to other tissues [27],\nimplicating the potential importance of GPDH in islets.\nSince GPDH plays a crucial role in transporting and reducing\nequivalents from cytosol to mitochondria, a decrease in its\nactivity leads to an accumulation of cytosolic NADH and\nconsequently, an increase in the cytosolic NAD/NAD+ ratio,\na decrease in glycolysis, and a reduction in GSIS.

Aging and Calcium and Potassium Channels. Increased\nATP/ADP ratio from glucose oxidation reduces the whole cell\nK+ permeability, leading to cell membrane depolarization\nand extracellular Ca2+ influx into the  cell. These changes\nare thought to be mediated through the ATP-sensitive\nK+ (KATP) channels and voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels\n(Figure 1). Elevation of cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration\nprovides a link with the insulin exocytotic process. Studies\nfrom Ammon and colleagues have shown that raising the\neffect on K+ efflux from islets of 24-month-old male rats\nwhereas that from 24-month-old female rats were decreased.\nAlso, net uptake of Ca2+ was significantly diminished in islets\nof 24-month-old compared to islets of 3-month-old rats. In\nthe presence of 16.7 mM of glucose, islets of 24-month-old\nrats exhibited only 60\u00ad70% of the insulin release obtained\nwith islets from 3-month-old rats. These data suggest that\nthe decreased insulin secretory response to glucose during\nold age is due, at least in part, to inadequate inhibition of\nK+ efflux and diminished net uptake of Ca2+ [29]. However,\nit is important to consider that the differences in ion fluxes\ncould relate to age-related deficits in the steps leading up to\nion flux such as decreased glucose transport and oxidation.\n2.1.4. Effects of Age on Insulin Granule Exocytosis. The final\nstep of insulin secretion is the exocytosis of insulin granules\n(Figure 1). Insulin is stored in large dense core vesicles\n(LDCVs), also called insulin granule, and released by exo-\ncytosis, a multistage process involving vesicle trafficking,\ndocking, and eventually fusion with the plasma membrane\n[30]. Calcium constitutes the major stimulus for exocytosis.\nCa2+ regulates several steps in exocytosis, such as the size\nof vesicle pools, the fusion event, and the size of the fusion\npore, and may act on distinct protein targets [31, 32]. Since\nthe net uptake of Ca2+ is decreased with age [29], it is\nreasonable to speculate that insulin granule exocytosis is\nalso inhibited by age. To date, insulin secretion is known to\ninvolve the same soluble N-ethylmaleimide, sensitive factor\nattachment protein receptor (SNARE) isoforms as those\nutilized in synaptic vesicle exocytosis and neurotransmitter\nrelease, namely, Syntaxin 1, vesicle-associated membrane\nprotein (VAMP) 2, and synaptosomal-associated protein of\npairing of SNARE proteins on the vesicle membrane, termed\nv-SNARE (such as VAMP2), with cognate proteins on the\ntarget membrane, the t-SNAREs (syntaxin and SNAP-25). In\naddition, other proteins such as munc18/sec1 and munc13\nhave also been reported to be involved in the regulation\nof insulin granule exocytosis [38, 39]. Vanguilder and col-\nleagues showed that neurotransmission-regulating proteins\nsuch as VAMP2, Syntaxin1, and SNAP-25 decline with age in\n4  \nhippocampal synaptosomes in rats. Altered synaptic protein\nexpression may decrease stimulus-induced neurotransmis-\nsion and vesicle replenishment during prolonged or intense\nstimulation, two processes that are necessary for learning and\nthe formation and perseverance of memory [40]. However, it\nis still unclear whether these proteins also decline with age in\npancreatic  cells. Further studies are needed to address this\nquestion.\n2.2. Aging and -Cell Mass. The proliferation and apoptosis\nof  cells and islet neogenesis are three major factors that\ntightly regulate -cell mass. As shown in Figure 2, in this\nsection, we will review the effects of aging on these factors.\n2.2.1. Apoptosis and Proliferation. Pancreatic -cell mass is\nmainly controlled by the balance of cell proliferation and\napoptosis. It has been shown that age correlates with\ndecreased proliferative activity and enhanced sensitivity to\nglucose-induced -cell apoptosis [41] (Figure 2). In cultured\nislets from 2 to 3-month-old rats, increasing glucose from 5.5\nto 11.1 mM decreased -cell apoptosis and increased -cell\nproliferation, which was further augmented when glucose\nwas increased to 33.3 mM. In contrast, in islets from 7 to 8-\nmonth-old rats, increasing glucose concentrations from 5.5\nto 33.3 mM induced a linear increase in -cell death and\na decrease in proliferation. This has also been observed in\ncultivated human islets where age correlated positively with\nthe sensitivity to glucose-induced  cell apoptosis and nega-\ntively to baseline proliferation [41]. It is reported that there\nis a three-to-ten-fold increase in -cell apoptosis in diabetic\npatients compared to nondiabetic individuals as detected\nby TUNEL staining [42]. Maedler et al. demonstrated that\nhigh glucose induces apoptosis in human pancreatic  cells\nthrough inducing the expression of Fas and activation of\ncaspase 8 and 3 [43]. Reers et al. report that relative -fcell\nvolume in human pancreatic islets remains constant with\naging and -cell replication decreases age dependently, while\n-cell apoptosis does not change significantly [44]. However,\nthe most recent study performed on 4-month, 14-month\nand, 24-month-old Wistar rats has shown that there is a\nsignificant reduction in -cell proliferation and increase in\napoptosis in  cells in the islets [45]. The study also showed\nthat age associated decreases in activities of many antioxidant\nenzymes and suggests that an increase in oxidative stress in\nthe  cells contributes to the increased apoptosis [45].\nIslet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) or amylin is cosecreted\nwith insulin from  cells [46]. Amylin suppresses glucagon\nsecretion and helps to regulate glucose homeostasis. In\ninsulin-resistant states, hypersecretion of insulin results in\nincreased cosecretion of amylin. Careful analyses show that\nthe amylin could aggregate into amyloid plaques that in-\ncrease -cell apoptosis leading to reduced islet volume and -\ncell mass [47], and subsequent diabetes [48]. Accumulating\nevidence implicates toxic IAPP oligomers in the mediation of\n cell apoptosis in T2D. In support, freshly dissolved human\nIAPP (hIAPP, but not rodent IAPP) induces apoptosis when\nadded to cells in culture [49]. -cell-specific transgenic\noverexpression of hIAPP result in hyperglycemia in the\nAging\nProliferation Apoptosis Neogenesis\n?\n cell\n -cell mass\nFigure 2: Factors that control -cell mass in aging.  cell pro-\nliferation, apoptosis, and islet neogenesis are three major factors\nthat control -cell mass. Through differentially regulation of these\nfactors, aging modulates -cell mass, and subsequently insulin\nsecretion.\nmice [50]. Although research has shown that with age there\nis an increased deposition of amylin in the islets of diabetic\nindividuals but not nondiabetic individuals [2], it is still too\nearly to rule out the potential influence of aging on amylin\naggregation.\n-cell mass normally grows well into adulthood to pro-\nvide increased insulin secretion capacity to match the greater\ninsulin requirements of maturity [51]. -cell mass can slowly\nexpand in adult rodents in response to increased insulin\nrequirements or during pregnancy [52]. Several mechanisms\nhave been invoked to explain adult -cell mass expansion,\nincluding neogenesis from pancreatic ducts or hematopoietic\ntissues [53], replication of specialized -cell progenitors, and\nself-renewal by  cell [54, 55]. -cell proliferation and the\ncapacity of  cell to regenerate declines with age in mice [56].\nBasal -cell proliferation is severely decreased with advanced\nage. The rate of -cell proliferation gradually declines with\naging in rats to a steady state by 7 months of age [13].\nYoung mice respond to high-fat diet by increasing -\ncell mass and proliferation and maintaining normal blood\nglucose levels. Old mice, in contrast, do not display any in-\ncreases in -cell mass or -cell proliferation in response to\nhigh-fat diet and become diabetic. There is a four-fold\nincrease in  cell proliferation in young mice after the\nadministration of streptozotocin (STZ), a chemical that is\ntoxic to the  cells in mammals and normally is used for\ninducing insulin secretion deficiency models in rodents,\nwhereas no changes are observed in older mice [56].\nSimilarly, STZ stimulated -cell replication in young mice\nbut had little effect in old mice [57]. Partial pancreatectomy\ngreatly stimulated -cell proliferation in young mice but\nfailed to increase -cell replication in old mice [57].\np16Ink4a is an effector of senescence [58] and a potent\ninhibitor of proliferative kinase cyclin-dependent kinase 4\n(Cdk4) [59], which is essential for pancreatic  cell pro-\nliferation in adult mammals [60, 61]. Islets in vivo exhibit\nincreased p16Ink4a expression with age in rodents and hu-\nmans [62]. Another cyclin-dependent kinase, Cdk6, is not\nexpressed in mouse islets but is very effective in driving\n  5\n cell replication in human islets [63]. Ablation of p16 leads\nto improved -cell function with age [64]. Lack of Cdk4\nexpression in mice leads to insulin-deficient diabetes [65].\nTo perform their kinase activity, Cdks bind some kinds\nof regulatory proteins called cyclins. Without cyclins, Cdks\nhave little kinase activity. Mouse  cells express 3 D-cyclins,\ntermed cyclin D1, D2, and D3; D2 is the most abundant\none whereas D3 is nearly undetectable [66]. Prenatal islet\ndevelopment occurred normally in cyclin D2-/- or cyclin\nD1+/- D2-/- mice. However, -cell proliferation, adult mass,\nand glucose tolerance were decreased in adult cyclin D2-/-\nmice, causing glucose intolerance that progressed to diabetes\nby 12 months of age. Although cyclin D1+/- mice never de-\nveloped diabetes, life-threatening diabetes developed in 3-\nmonth-old cyclin D1-/+ D2-/- mice as -cell mass decreased\nafter birth. Thus, cyclins D2 and D1 were essential for  cell\nexpansion in adult mice [66]. In contrast, in the human \ncell, cyclin D3 is highly expressed, whereas cyclin D1 and D2\nlevels are much lower. Overexpression of cyclin D3 in isolated\nhuman islets, especially in combination with Cdk6, induced\nthe greatest increase in -cell proliferation when compared\nwith over-expression of other cyclins [63]. Although cell\ncycle proteins play crucial roles in the proliferation of\npancreatic  cells, less is known about the effects of aging on\nthe expression or/and activity of cyclins and Cdks; therefore,\nstudies in this area may contribute to a better understanding\nof the relationship between aging and loss of -cell mass.\n2.2.2. Islet Neogenesis.  cell proliferation is self-replication\nof the  cell, whereas islet neogenesis is the differentiation\nof progenitor cell or transdifferentiation of pancreatic non-\ncells to  cells. Neogenesis of islets occurring during normal\nembryonic development and in very early postnatal life can\nlead to -cell mass expansion. In addition to fetal [67] and\nneonatal [68] periods,  cell neogenesis has been shown to\nbe important in increasing -cell mass in the adult during\nperiods of increased insulin demand such as obesity [42]\nand pregnancy [69]. Rosenberg et al. developed a model for\nislet neogenesis in adult mammalian pancreas in the 1980s,\nwhich showed that pancreatic ductal cells can be induced\nto differentiate into normal functioning adult endocrine\ncells [70]. -cell neogenesis may occur through two path-\nways, stem/progenitor cell activation and transdifferentiation\nof adult pancreatic cells [71]. Islet neogenesis-associated\nprotein (INGAP), found in pancreatic exocrine secretions,\nappears to stimulate the growth and proliferation of duct\ncells and their differentiation into endocrine cells [72\u00ad74].\nINGAP and a bioactive 15 amino acid synthetic peptide\n(INGAP peptide) are inducers of islet neogenesis in a human\nislet system [73]. Other stimuli have been demonstrated to\nexert neogenic effects on the endocrine pancreas. The com-\nbination of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and gastrin has\nbeen shown to stimulate islet neogenesis in both animal\nand human studies [75]. Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1),\nan incretin from enteroendocrine L cells of the intestine,\nhas been shown to induce islet neogenesis in rodents [76].\nAlthough the potential for -cell replication appears to de-\ncline substantially with age as evidenced by decreased PDX\nexpression, the rate of islet neogenesis (expressed as percent-\nage of insulin positive duct cells) is not affected by aging in\nIn summary, various aspects of -cell mass and function\ndecline as a feature of age, thus contributing to the age-\nassociated defects in insulin secretion. This defect when\nsuperimposed for an increased need for insulin, could con-\ntribute to impaired glucose homeostasis, glucose intolerance\nand diabetes. In the subsequent section, we will discuss and\nreview literature on age-associated deterioration of insulin\naction.\n3. Aging and Insulin Action\nInsulin action is the ability of insulin to bind to its receptors\nlocated on tissues including muscle, liver, and adipose\ntissue and initiate signaling effects. The net physiological\nmetabolic effects that result from insulin signaling include\n(a) regulation of glucose homeostasis through a decrease in\nhepatic glucose output (via decreased gluconeogenesis and\nglycogenolysis) and increase in glucose uptake, primarily into\nstriated muscle and adipose tissue as well as (b) increase in\nlipid synthesis in fat cells, and attenuation of release of free\nfatty acid from triglycerides in fat. Insulin resistance results\nwhen normal circulating concentrations of the hormone are\ninsufficient to regulate these processes appropriately.\n3.1. Visceral Fat. It is well documented that aging is associ-\nated with a decline of insulin action [77\u00ad79]. The decline in\ninsulin action with age is thought to contribute to the high\nprevalence of impaired glucose tolerance and Type 2 diabetes\namong the elderly [80, 81]. Notably, some studies support\nthe hypothesis that the decline in insulin action in the elderly\npersons is related to increased abdominal fat rather than to\naging per se [82]. However, other studies suggested that age-\nassociated insulin resistance may not be explained solely by\nconcomitant abdominal obesity [83]. Abdominal fat (also\ncalled visceral fat, VF), which is located in and around the\nviscera, has been demonstrated to be strongly related to\nmany health conditions, including CVD, insulin resistance,\nand T2D [84]. Several cross-sectional studies suggest that\nvisceral fat increases throughout the lifespan in men and\nwomen of all ages and race, independent of increases in body\nweight [85\u00ad88]. Many factors contribute to the increased\nVF seen with aging such as physiologic decline in GH/IGF-\n1 axis, decrease in sex steroids as well as sedentary life\nstyle [89]. The mechanisms how VF links to the metabolic\nsyndrome are still not entirely clear, but it has been suggested\nto involve its anatomical location, leading to a \"portal\"\neffect of greater free fatty acids (FFAs) and glycerol release\n[90]. Gabriely et al. showed that extraction of VF from\n20-month-old Fischer 344 Brown Norway (FBN) rats was\nsufficient to restore peripheral and hepatic insulin action to\nthe levels of young rats. Moreover, removal of VF in Zucker\nDiabetic Fatty (ZDF) rats prevented the progressive decrease\nin insulin action and delayed the onset of diabetes, but VF\nextraction did not alter plasma free fatty acid levels [91].\nBorst et al. reported that VF removal in Sprague Dawley\n6  \n(SD) rats tended to improve glucose tolerance and lowered\nsome pro-inflammatory adipokines in serum; these animals\ndisplayed increased insulin-stimulated glucose transport in\nexcised soleus and digitorum longus muscles as compared to\ncontrol group. These studies provide verification that VF is\na potent modulator of both hepatic and peripheral insulin\naction [92]. Calorie restriction (CR) extends life span and\nretards age-related chronic diseases in a variety of species,\nincluding rats, mice, fish, flies, worms, and yeast [93]. Our\nstudies have shown that a reduction in fat mass, specifically\nVF, may be one of the possible underlying mechanisms of the\nantiaging effect of caloric restriction [94].\nNowadays, adipose tissue is recognized as an active\nmetabolic-endocrine organ, and obesity is considered as a\nlow-grade inflammatory condition strongly linked to adverse\nmetabolic outcomes. A putative key link between increasing\nfat mass and obesity-related complications, including insulin\nresistance, is a chronic low-grade inflammatory state within\nadipose tissue, related to infiltration by macrophages [95].\nWe and others have shown that VF depots display a\nunique profile of inflammatory mediators compared to\nsubcutaneous adipose tissue, including the clearly higher\nexpression levels of macrophage migration inhibitory factor\n(MIF) and chemokine receptor 2 in VF [96, 97]. Other\nstudies also suggested that VF is a stronger risk factor for\nmetabolic disorders and mortality than subcutaneous fat\n[82, 98]. MIF, a proinflammatory cytokine, can activate\nnuclear factor (NF)-B signaling but directly inhibits the\nthan the control mice [101]. The possible explanation is\naging is associated with inflammation and inflammation\ncould accelerate aging process, whereas lack of MIF could\ndownregulate NF-B, mediated inflammatory signaling,\nwhich will subsequently mitigate the process of aging [102].\nMacrophages are considered to be a significant source\nfor many fat-derived proinflammatory cytokines, and the\npercentage of macrophages in fat has been shown to increase\nin obesity [103]. Interestingly, our study suggested that the\npercentage of macrophages in the stromal vascular cell\nfraction from both visceral and subcutaneous fat increased\nwith age regardless of obesity status [104]. Taken together,\nincrease of VF is a hallmark of aging and a source of increased\nchronic inflammation. Inflammation could accelerate the\naging process [105] and eventually lead to the metabolic\ndysfunction. Breaking this vicious cycle by decreasing the VF\nwill be a potential therapeutic method for treating metabolic\nand related diseases (Figure 3).\n3.2. Lipids and Insulin Resistance. Lack of or resistance to\ninsulin leads to two metabolic crises: a marked increase\nin the rate of lipolysis in adipose tissue and activation of\nhepatic gluconeogenesis in spite of high plasma glucose\nlevels. The increased rate of lipolysis increases circulating\nFFA levels, which, in turn, exacerbates insulin resistance in\nthe whole body. It has been very well documented that the\nacute elevation of plasma FFA produces insulin resistance in\nalso shown that chronically elevated plasma FFA levels cause\nAging\nVisceral fat\nChronic\ninflammation\nAging\nVisceral fat\nChronic\ninflammation\nMetabolic\nsyndrome\nHypertension\nIR\nObesity T2D\nCVD\nFigure 3: Link between Aging, visceral fat, inflammation, and\nmetabolic syndrome. Visceral fat increases with age and the increase\nof visceral fat induces inflammation. Inflammation accelerates the\nprocess of aging. The vicious cycle of aging, visceral fat and\ninflammation increases the risk of metabolic diseases such as\nobesity, IR, T2D, CVD, and hypertension, CVD: cardiovascular\ndisease, IR: insulin resistance, T2D: type 2 diabetes.\ninsulin resistance, and lowering elevated plasma FFA levels\novernight normalizes insulin sensitivity in obese nondiabetic\nsubjects and significantly improves insulin sensitivity in\nobese diabetic patients [109]. The mechanisms by which\nelevated levels of FFA produce insulin resistance have not\nbeen fully understood. However, studies have shown that\nincreasing plasma FFAs acutely decreases insulin-stimulated\nglucose uptake and glycogen synthesis in human [110]. It is\nalso reported that increase of FFA level in human inhibits\nPI3 kinase activity in skeletal muscle [111], suggesting the\nimpairment of insulin signaling by FFA. Itani et al. pointed\nout that, with the infusion of FFA, increased accumulation\nof diacylglycerol (DAG) and protein kinase C (PKC) activity\nin muscle contribute to the impairment of insulin signaling\nsteatotic liver is also resistant to insulin in terms of inhibition\nof hepatic glucose production and stimulation of glycogen\nsynthesis. The high FFA levels may be the unifying mecha-\nnism that accounts for the insulin resistance in obesity, type 2\ndiabetes, lipodystrophy, and aging [113]. We and others have\nshown that the circulating FFA levels are significant higher\nin 9- to 20-month-old SD rats compared to 3-month old,\ndemonstrating that circulating FFA increases with age [113].\n3.3. Aging and Central Insulin Resistance. Although periph-\neral insulin resistance is a hallmark of the development of\nT2D, more recent evidence has shown that insulin resistance\nalso exists in central nervous system (CNS), and that central\ninsulin action plays an important role in regulating whole\nbody glucose metabolism. Like peripheral tissues, molecules\nin insulin signaling such as insulin receptor (IR), insulin\nreceptor substrates (IRS), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase\n(PI3K) are universally expressed in the brain, indicating\n  7\na potential role of insulin signaling in the brain. Koch et\nal. showed that mice lacking IR in CNS exhibit significantly\nmore severe impairment of peripheral glucose homeostasis\nthan mice lacking IR in the peripheral tissues [114]. Gelling\net al. has shown that central infusion of PI3K inhibitor\nattenuated insulin-induced glucose lowering by 35%\u00ad40% in\nboth acute and chronic insulin treatment paradigms, while\nhypothalamic overexpression of either IRS-2, a upstream\nkinase of PI3K, or protein kinase B (PKB/Akt), a key down-\nstream mediator of PI3K action, enhanced the glycemic\nresponse to insulin by 2 folds in STZ-induced diabetic rats,\nsuggesting that hypothalamic insulin signaling is an impor-\ntant determinant of the response to insulin in the man-\nagement of uncontrolled diabetes [115]. Interestingly, an\nincreasing body of evidence shows a link between diabetes\nand AD, a neurodegenerative disorder and the most common\nform of dementia. It has been reported that patients with\nT2D increase the prevalence of AD by two-to-three folds\n[116], and insulin levels and insulin activity in the central\nnervous system are reduced in AD [117]. Studies in human\nsubjects show that both peripheral and central administra-\nsuggesting impairment of insulin signaling in the brain as a\nrisk factor of neurodegenerative disorders, and restoration\nof insulin signaling could be a potential therapy for AD.\nThis brings an interesting question whether aging is also\nassociated with central insulin resistance. Fernandes et al.\ndemonstrated that the protein levels of elements in the\ninsulin signaling pathway such as IRs and SRC homology\nadaptor protein (SHC) did not change significantly in\nthe forebrain cortex and cerebellum of rats aged 1 d to\n60 wk. However, insulin induced tyrosine phosphorylation\nof IR and SHC, and the association of SHC/growth factor\nreceptor binding protein-2 (GRB2) decreased significantly in\nboth types of tissues [122]. Other studies showed that intra-\ncerebroventricular administration of insulin was more effi-\ncient at reducing food intake and body weight in 3-month-\nold rats than in 8- and 24-month-old rats, indicating the\ndevelopment of hypothalamic insulin resistance with age in\nWistar rats. Furthermore, the tyrosine phosphorylation of IR\nand IRS-2 and the phosphorylation of downstream target\ngenes such as Foxo1 and p70S6K declined, whereas serine\nphosphorylation of IR and IRS-2 increased with age in rat\nAging-associated increase in central and peripheral\ninsulin resistance could contribute to both diabetes and AD.\nThe field of central insulin resistance and its role in the\ndevelopment of neurodegenerative disorders and the control\nof whole body glucose homeostasis is complicated and\nfurther studies are needed to fully understand the underlying\nmechanisms. For a detailed review of the insulin signaling\nin the brain, we refer the readers to the following reviews\n4. Aging and Whole Body Glucose Homeostasis\nIt is clearly established that the risk for impaired glucose\ntolerance and diabetes increase with age in rodents and\nhumans. The specific factors such as increased VF and cir-\nculating FFA that contribute to impaired insulin action and\nvarious defects in -cell mass/function have been highlighted\nin the previous section. However, the integrated whole body\nglucose homeostasis is complex with various age-related\nparameters playing a crucial role on both aspects of glucose\nhomeostasis, namely, insulin action and insulin secretion.\nLeptin, a hormone secreted from adipose tissue, plays a key\nrole in energy intake and expenditure. Deficiency of leptin\nand its receptor leads to severe obesity, insulin resistance,\nand diabetes in rodents and humans. Resistant to the effects\nof leptin, termed leptin resistance, is seen in obesity and\naging. Leptin resistance associated with aging [127\u00ad129] and\ndecline in growth hormone (GH)/insulin-like growth factor\n(IGF)-1 axis [89] could play a key role in the alterations of\nglucose homeostasis in aging. Accumulating evidence sug-\ngests that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress plays a role in\nthe pathogenesis of diabetes, contributing to both pancreatic\n-cell function and peripheral insulin resistance [130]. It has\nbeen reported that aging is related to increase in proapoptotic\nmarkers with ER stress in multiple tissues, including lung,\nliver, kidney, and brain [131, 132]. In the past decade, a fam-\nily of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide- (NAD-) dependent\nprotein deacetylases, termed sirtuins, have been shown to\ncontribute to longevity. Sirtuins slow aging in worms, fruit\nflies, and mice [133]. Interestingly, overexpression of sirtuins\nor treat with activators of sirtuins, such as resveratrol\nprotect against metabolic decline in aging, increases insulin\nsensitivity, increases insulin secretion, improves life quality,\nmentioned variables, aging-associated sedentary life style\nand diminished physical activity may be important factors\nfor age-related changes of glucose homeostasis. Research has\nshown that healthy elderly with greater degrees of physical\nfitness have better glucose tolerance and lower level of insulin\nresistance than less active old people [134]. In addition,\naging is associated with defects in the balance of insulin\nsecretion and insulin action (demands). In the young, a\nhyperbolic relationship exists between insulin secretion and\ninsulin sensitivity, whereby pancreatic  cell compensates\nfor changes in whole-body insulin sensitivity through a\nproportionate increase in insulin secretion [116]. Our data\nshows that compared to younger animals, when challenged\nwith a prolonged hyperglycemic stimuli older animals are\nunable to maintain the insulin secretion proportional to the\nWhole body glucose homeostasis is a complex balance of\nglucose production and utilization by different tissues. Food\nintake and hepatic glucose production are the two sources\nof glucose production, while skeletal muscle contributes\nto the majority of the glucose uptake and utilization.\nUtilizing tracer technology, it is possible to differentiate\nbetween the effects on glucose production (liver) and\nglucose utilization (primarily the muscle). Hepatic glucose\nproduction (HGP) plays crucial roles in glucose home-\nostasis, both in the fasting and postprandial states. In\ncontrast to rodents, where there is an increase in HGP in\nage, there are no differences in either the basal hepatic\nglucose production or the dose-response curve of its\n8  \nsuppression by insulin between young and old individu-\nals [135]. The European Group for the Study of Insu-\nlin Resistance reported that hepatic glucose production does\nnot increase with age, when adjusted for lean body mass\n[136]. Furthermore, hepatic glucose output has not been\nshown to be increased in elderly patients with T2D [137].\nThus, hepatic insulin resistance does not seem play a sig-\nnificant role in decreased glucose tolerance of elderly people\nAs mentioned earlier, skeletal muscle is the major source\nof glucose utilization. Glucose is transported into the cells by\nglucose transporters. Through anaerobic and aerobic path-\nways, glucose is broken down to generate energy. GLUT4\nis the major glucose transporter in skeletal muscle respon-\nsible for insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Muscle GLUT4\nprotein level is not altered in obesity and T2D, however, its\nexpression levels decline with age, and are related to insulin\nsensitivity in normal controls [139]. European Group for the\nStudy of Insulin Resistance demonstrated that glucose uptake\nis not altered as a function of aging per se but is secondary\nto increased body fat accumulation [140]. Moreover, the\ndecrease of lean body mass [141] and contractile strength\nwith age are other factors that contribute to the reduction in\ninsulin stimulated glucose uptake. The above factors, along\nwith changes in body composition, accumulation of VF,\nand increase in circulating FFA levels, contributes to the\ndecreased glucose uptake with age.\n5. Conclusion and Perspective\nGlucose intolerance, insulin resistance, and T2D associated\nwith aging are leading causes of morbidity and mortality\nthrough its multiple complications as well as increases in the\nrisk for multiple other age-related diseases such as cancer,\nstroke, cardiovascular diseases, Parkinson's disease, and AD\n[6]. Though various factors that contribute to the changes\nin glucose homeostasis are relatively well characterized, there\nare still areas that are not yet fully elucidated such as the\nroles of aging on -cell mass and function, and the cross-\ntalk between central and peripheral insulin action. A com-\nprehensive understanding of all the defects that impair\nglucose homeostasis in the elderly will lead to development of\nappropriate, novel treatments that will substantially improve\nquality of life and over all life span.\nAbbreviations\nAD: Alzheimer's disease\nCdk: Cyclin-dependent kinase\nCNS: Central nervous system\nCR: Calorie restriction\nCVD: Cardiovascular disease\nDAG: Diacylglycerol\nER: Endoplasmic reticulum\nFFA: Free fatty acid\nGCK: Glucokinase\nGH: Growth hormone\nGLP: Glucagon-like peptide\nGLUT: Glucose transporter\nGPDH: Glycerophosphate dehydrogenase\nGRB2: Growth factor receptor binding protein-2\nGSIS: Glucose stimulated insulin secretion\nHGP: Hepatic Glucose Production\nIAPP: Islet amyloid polypeptide\nIGF: Insulin-like growth factor\nINGAP: Islet neogenesis-associated protein\nIR: Insulin receptor\nIRS: Insulin receptor substrate\nKATP: ATP-sensitive K+\nLDCV: large dense core vesicles\nMIF: Macrophage migration inhibitory factor\nNAD: Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide\nNAFLD: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease\nNF: Nuclear factor\nPI3K: Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase\nPKB/Akt: Protein kinase B\nPKC: Protein kinase C\nSD: Sprague Dawley\nSHC: SRC homology adaptor protein\nSNAP-25: Synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa\nSNARE: Soluble N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor\nattachment protein receptor\nSTZ: Streptozotocin\nT2D: Type 2 diabetes\nTCA: Tri-carboxylic acid\nVAMP: Vesicle-associated membrane protein\nVF: Visceral fat\nZDF: Zucker Diabetic Fatty.\n"
