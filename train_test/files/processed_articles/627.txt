Large\ndifferences persist when conditions are examined individually and when total episode charges are\nexamined. Based on our findings, a rough estimate of nationwide excess charges is $5-$7 billion for\nSignificant attention has been paid in recent years to persons who use\nthe emergency departments of the nation's hospitals for their primary\ncare. The fact that many patients obtain nonurgent care in emergency\ndepartments has been well documented.1 In fact, according to the National\nAmbulatory Medical Care Survey, more than half of the 89.8 million\nemergency department visits made in 1992 were for nonurgent care.2 Such\nuse of expensive emergency services is often pointed to as a source of excess\nhealth spending. It has been argued that significant savings, as well as\nincreased quality of care, could be achieved ifthese patients used appropriate\nsources of care. However, although some \"back-of-the-envelope\" estimates\nof the ratio of emergency department to non-emergency department costs\nhave been generated over the past fifteen years, broad-based, careful esti-\nmates of the excess cost of these visits have not been available.4 In this\nDataWatch we use data from the 1987 National Medical Expenditure\nSurvey (NMES) to study the difference between the charge for an emergency\ndepartment visit and the charge for a visit to another setting for patients\nwith several conditions that are not likely to require urgent attention.\nData And Methods\nData sources. We use data from the 1987 NMES household survey file,\nthe ambulatory visit file, and the health status questionnaire.5 NMES is a\nLaurence Baker is assistant professor of health research and policy at the Stanford University School\nof Medicine in Stanford, California, and is a faculty research fellow at the National Bureau of\nEconomic Research.

In the ambulatory care supplement, data are collected from per-\nsons on all contacts with the ambulatory medical care system, including\nvisits to medical provider offices, hospital outpatient units, and emergency\ndepartments. Total charges for each visit, procedures performed, and payers\nfor the visit also are included. The household survey file provides basic\ndemographics (age, race, sex, income, and so on), and the health status\nquestionnaire provides information on medical conditions, self-perceived\nhealth status, and other health-related variables.\nThe key variable of interest here is visit charges. This variable represents\nactual charges for the services performed, except when charges were re-\nduced to amounts allowed by third-party payers. In these cases, the data\ncontained the reduced amount.6 Since NMES expresses charges in 1987\ndollars, the values we present are also in 1987 dollars, except where noted.\nConstruction and selection of episodes. We examined charges for\nvisits and episodes of care. Episodes were constructed from the NMES visit\nfile by grouping visits made by an individual to any provider for the same\nInternational Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) diagnosis\ncode. Sequences of visits occurring before a break in service of four months\nor more were considered to be in the same episode.7\nWe identified a sample of episodes for analysis using a three-step process.\nFirst, we included only episodes for a select set of conditions that are not\nexpected to often require urgent care. NMES provides the ICD-9 code for\nthe patient's condition. Because coding is retrospective and may not cap-\nture all available information, the selection of codes to be designated as\nnonurgent is difficult. Although previous literature on nonurgent care in\nemergency departments has not often used the ICD-9 codes as the basis of\ncategorization, one retrospective chart review did incorporate diagnosis.8\nHere, a number of conditions were considered nonurgent, including super-\nficial injuries, uncomplicated fractures of any digit or metacarpal, pharyngi-\ntis (sore throat), upper respiratory tract infections, and gastroenteritis.9 We\nincluded episodes for the treatment of these conditions along with the\ntreatment of skin disorders (for example, diaper rash, eczema, corns, cal-\nlouses, and ingrown nails), head- and backaches, and miscellaneous symp-\ntoms (for example, conjunctivitis, earwax, hiccoughs, and heartburn).10\nSecond, since our estimates of charge differences may be biased if the\nillnesses or injuries treated in emergency departments are more severe than\nthose treated in the offices of medical providers, we excluded from consid-\neration episodes with characteristics that we expect to be correlated with\nhigher severity. Specifically, we excluded episodes for which the patient\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Episodes related to pregnancy also were excluded.\nFinally, since NMES only includes visits that occurred during 1987, our\ndata on episodes that actually began in late 1986 would be inaccurate. We\ntherefore excluded from our analysis of first visit charges all episodes begin-\nning before March 1987 for which the first visit was to the office of a\nmedical provider. Examination of the distribution of episodes indicated\nthat episodes for which the first visit was to an emergency department are\nnot likely to be censored. In all, after excluding episodes with missing data,\nour sample consisted of 3,305 episodes beginning in non-emergency de-\npartment settings and 779 episodes beginning in an emergency department.\nWe used only condition and severity in the selection process, excluding\ninformation related to visit appropriateness (for example, day of the week).\nWe do not wish to consider access issues here, but rather to compare costs\nwith those that would be incurred if all nonurgent cases were cared for in\nnon-emergency department settings.\nOur sample of emergency department-initiated episodes is about 10\npercent of the total number of emergency department-initiated episodes\nconstructed from the NMES visit file, much fewer than the 50 percent of\nemergency department visits that are widely agreed to be nonurgent. In\nconstructing our sample, we considered including episodes for treatment of\nadditional conditions so that the number of episodes in our sample might be\ncloser to 50 percent. However, since we must rely on ICD-9 codes to\nidentify episodes, including additional categories would have exacerbated\nthe potential for differences in severity to bias our findings. For example, we\ncould have included lacerations, since some lacerations are nonurgent, but\nin so doing, we might also have included truly urgent lacerations that are\nalso more likely to present in an emergency department. This would have\nmade it more difficult to compare charges. Faced with this trade-off, we\nchose the set of conditions discussed above in hopes of examining a range\nof conditions while minimizing the risk of improper comparisons.\nMethods. We examined charges for visits and for episodes of care,\nfocusing on the mean charge for emergency department and non-\nemergency department visits and, in the case of episodes, on the mean\ncharge for episodes that were initiated in the two settings.\nTo control for variation in patient characteristics and injury severity, we\nused regression adjustment techniques. Conceptually, these techniques use\nthe experiences of patients who went to a non-emergency department\nprovider to predict what the patients in our emergency department sample\nwould have been charged for their visits if they had gone to other providers\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

To implement the procedure, we used ordinary least squares to\nregress the first visit charges incurred by patients in the non-emergency\ndepartment sample on an extensive set of variables describing the charac-\nteristics of their visits (condition, treatments received, source of payment,\ntotal number of visits in the episode), health status, health insurance status,\nregular source of health care, and demographic characteristics.11 In some\nregressions we also controlled for medical history. We then used the regres-\nsion results to predict the charges that would have been incurred by the\nemergency department patients if they had gone elsewhere. Using the\nprojected charges, we can examine the difference between the charges for\ncare in the different settings by looking at the difference between the\namount that the emergency department sample was actually charged and\ntheir projected non-emergency department charge.\nNote that in the regression analysis, we control for the number and types\nof treatments received. This may cause us to understate the true underlying\ncharge difference, since treatment difference may reflect differences in\npractice style. However, treatment difference also may reflect differences in\nseverity. Including treatment in the regression will yield conservative esti-\nmates of charge differences.\nStudy Results\nFirst visit charges. We examined differences in the charges for first\nvisits in emergency department and other settings (Exhibit 1). We focus on\nfirst visits since they are likely to have similar content in both settings,\nwhile visits at other points in an episode may differ. The first two columns\npresent the distribution of the episodes over condition types. The last three\ncolumns present the unadjusted mean charge for the first visit from episodes\nbeginning in various settings. All charges are presented in 1987 dollars,\nexcept where noted. The differences are striking. Overall, the mean first\nvisit charge in a non-emergency department setting is $43, while the mean\nfirst visit charge in an emergency department is $144. Large differences\nbetween the two settings persist within the condition categories. In all\ncases, the differences are highly statistically significant.\nRegression-adjusted estimates of mean charges for first visits are pre-\nsented in the top section of Exhibit 2. The first column presents the actual\nmean charge for emergency department patients; the second column pre-\nsents the charge we project that these patients would have incurred with a\nnon-emergency department provider. For all condition categories com-\nbined, the projected non-emergency department charge is $50, while the\nactual charge of $144 was nearly three times higher. For conditions exam-\nined separately, large differences also persist.

Episodes for the treatment of fractures and gastroenteritis\nwere not separately examined since there were too few visits to permit\nreliable regression analysis.\nAlthough we carefully selected the episodes analyzed here to minimize\nthe possibility that severity bias would cloud our analysis, it is possible to\nmake additional exclusions from the sample to reduce this risk even further.\nIn doing so, however, we run the opposite risk of removing cases that\nshould be examined--those for which no severity bias exists. Nonetheless,\nto provide a conservative estimate of the difference, the bottom section of\nExhibit 2 presents actual and projected emergency department charges for\na subset of our original sample that excludes episodes in which patients\nreceived x-rays, scans, or surgical procedures. As expected, the mean actual\nfirst visit charge is notably lower in this sample than in the whole sample;\nthe projected charges are also lower. Since both actual and projected\ncharges fall by about one-third, the ratio of actual emergency department to\nprojected non-emergency department charges remains about the same--\nemergency department visit charges were about three times as much as\nnon-emergency department visit charges. However, the absolute difference\nis smaller in this sample than in the overall sample. For all conditions,\nemergency department visit charges were about $65 more than other visit\ncharges. Since this sample is likely to exclude some valid episodes, we\ninterpret this as a conservative estimate of the charge difference.\nIt is important to note that the regression techniques used can only\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

If there are\ndifferences in important unrecorded patient characteristics, especially con-\ndition severity, our estimates of the difference could overstate its size.\nTotal episode charges. When assessing the overall extent of excess\ncharges, it is important to consider episode charges as well as visit charges,\nbecause episodes begun in emergency departments may differ from episodes\nbegun in non-emergency department settings. One important possibility is\nthat the length of episodes may differ. For example, if office-based providers\nare more likely than emergency department providers to recommend\nfollow-up visits, episodes begun in a non-emergency department setting\nmay be longer. If this is the case, the differences observed in first visit\ncharges may overstate the differences in total episode charges.\nTo examine this issue, we first looked directly at the number of visits in\nepisodes. To reduce the possibility of truncation at the end of the NMES\nsample period, we examined only episodes that ended in or before October\n1987. Thus, the sample used here is somewhat smaller than that used\nabove. Exhibit 3 presents the mean number of visits in episodes that began\nin the two settings.

Taking all conditions to-\ngether, the average emergency department-initiated episode charge was\n$174, while we project that these episodes would have cost one-third as\nmuch, about $63 per episode, if they had begun in another setting. Actual\nand projected charges for specific conditions also are presented in Exhibit\n4. In general, emergency department-initiated episode charges were two to\nthree times more than those for episodes initiated outside an emergency\ndepartment. Estimates based on the restricted sample are similar, although,\nas before, the absolute size of the differences is smaller.\nEstimates of excess charges. Using these results, it is possible to con-\nstruct rough estimates of the overall excess charges associated with the use\nof emergency departments for nonurgent care. About 89.8 million emer-\ngency department visits took place in 1992.13 In our analysis of the NMES\ndata, we found that 10 percent of the emergency department-initiated\nepisodes of care were for the treatment of the narrow set of nonurgent\nconditions on which we focused. We thus suspect that about 10 percent of\nthe 89.8 million emergency department visits, or 8.98 million visits, were\nfor the treatment of these conditions. Applying the per visit charge differ-\nential we obtained earlier ($93.85, see Exhibit 2) to these visits, we esti-\nmate that the nationwide excess charges for the treatment of only our\naccounting for inflation in medical costs using the medical Consumer Price\nTwo assumptions underlie these estimates. First, we assume that we have\naccurately estimated the charge differences for the conditions that we\nexamined. Although we may have overestimated this difference by failing\nto completely control for severity or other unobserved factors, we hope to\nhave minimized this problem by carefully selecting the episodes examined\nand by using extensive controls in our regression analysis. The second\nassumption is that the first visit charge difference is representative of charge\ndifferences for other (for example, second) visits. We suspect that this is the\ncase since our analysis of total episode charges produced results similar to\nthose from the first visit analysis.\nHowever, $1.3 billion may be a significant understatement of nationwide\nexcess charges for the treatment of all nonurgent emergency department\ncases. One recent estimate indicated that 55.4 percent of 1992 emergency\ndepartment visits, or 49.7 million visits, were nonurgent.14 Under the\nassumption that the excess charge estimate we derived from the analysis of\nour set of conditions is applicable to all nonurgent emergency department\nvisits, a rough estimate of overall excess charges is $7.2 billion in 1993\ndollars.15 Unfortunately, we cannot assess the extent to which our findings\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Because $7.2 billion could be an overestimate, we have com-\nputed a more conservative estimate by applying the estimated charge differ-\nence obtained from our conservative restricted sample ($65.26, see Exhibit\n2). Here, we find estimated excess charges of $5 billion in 1993 dollars.\nPolicy Implications\nThese are rough estimates. But even these rough calculations suggest that\nthere are significant excess expenditures associated with the use of emer-\ngency departments for nonurgent care. They also suggest that policies that\nmake alternative, less expensive sources of care available to patients and\nthat encourage patients to use such facilities may achieve savings. Such\npolicies would have to address patients' incentives and knowledge regard-\ning appropriate sources of care. It is important to note, however, that it may\nstill be difficult to achieve all of these savings. Emergency departments\nprobably have substantial fixed costs, which may be difficult to reduce\nwithout shutting facilities down. If our estimates of excess charges do not\nrepresent excess variable costs, they may not represent achievable savings.\nThere are also significant access issues to be surmounted. In some places\nand at some times there may be no alternative sources of care available.\nMuch of this work was completed while the authors were at The Robert WoodJohnson Foundation\nand (Laurence) Princeton University.
