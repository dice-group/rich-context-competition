    "abstract": "Abstract\nClinical supervision is considered to be an essential component of psychotherapy training. However, research on supervisors'\nability to affect client outcome has been mixed. This investigation aims to answer two questions: (a) What is the perceived\nimpact of supervision on client outcome, and (b) how important is it to supervisors and supervisees that supervision affects\nclient outcome? A mixed-methods approach was used to examine the perspectives of both supervisors and supervisees. The\nsurvey consisted of survey questions and one open-ended qualitative question. Findings suggest that both supervisors and\nsupervisees perceive supervision as beneficial and important for impacting client outcome. Supervisees perceive supervision\nas more important in impacting outcome than supervisors. Existing literature suggests that supervision may not have as\nsignificant an impact on client outcome as previously believed; however, supervisors and supervisees perceive the supervision\nprocess as essential for psychotherapy training. Implications and future directions are discussed.\n",

Within most models of supervision, one of the supervi-\nsors' most important responsibilities is ensuring and protect-\ning client welfare (e.g., Ellis & Ladany, 1997). For example, in\ntheir competency-based model for supervision, Falender and\nShafranske (2004) stated, \"The most important task of the\nsupervisor is to monitor the supervisee's conduct to ensure . . .\nthe best possible clinical outcome for the client\" (p. 4).\nThis conceptualization implies that supervisors can and\nshould have an effect on client outcome. However, doubts\nhave been raised about the extent of impact supervisors\ncan have on client outcome due to the many variables at\nthe supervisor and supervisee levels that may moderate\noutcome (e.g., Holloway, 1984). These variables include,\nbut are not limited to, factors such as quality of the super-\nvisory working alliance (Ellis & Ladany, 1997) and the\nextent of collaboration in supervision (Rousmaniere,\nSwift, Babins-Wagner, Whipple, & Berzins, 2014). In their\ndiscussion of supervision research, Wampold and Holloway\n(1997) stated, \"Detection of a relation between supervision\nprocess and the patient's rating of patient change (the most\ndistal outcome) would be expected to be extremely small\"\nmodest expectations for supervisors' impact on client out-\ncome: \"Supervision may have an effect on client outcome;\nhowever, supervisors should recognize that the effect in\nmany instances may be minimal\" (p. 195).\nResearch on the supervisor-to-client outcome connection\nis similarly mixed. Three reviews of the literature have been\nconducted which examines this link (Freitas, 2002; Milne,\nthese reviews have found some support for the theory that\nsupervision may impact client outcome, methodological\nconcerns within the individual studies can be found in each\nof the three studies. These methodological issues are signifi-\ncant enough to raise serious doubts about their findings (e.g.,\nnonrandom assignment of participants, reliance on supervi-\nsor/supervisee self-report, use of outcome measures with\npoor psychometric properties).\nThe strongest evidence linking supervision to client out-\ncome can be found in three individual studies with stronger\nmethodologies (Bambling, King, Raue, Schweitzer, &\nLambert, 2006; Callahan, Almstrom, Swift, Borja, & Heath,\n1University of Alaska Fairbanks, USA\n2University of Idaho, Moscow, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nKatrina A.

Swift2\n Keywords\nsupervision, training, psychotherapy outcome\n2 SAGE Open\nnificantly different results, and despite stronger methodol-\nogy than the reviews cited above, the extent to which\nsupervision impacts client outcome is unclear. Bambling\nents were randomly assigned to 127 licensed therapists, half\nof whom received supervision for eight sessions of problem-\nsolving treatment. Clients of therapists receiving supervision\nhad higher scores on both measures of treatment outcome\nand working alliance (Bambling et al., 2006). Callahan and\ncolleagues (2009) used a naturalistic data set to examine the\noutcomes of 76 adult psychotherapy clients who were ran-\ndomly assigned to 40 trainee therapists, who were in supervi-\nsion with nine supervisors. Supervisors were found to\naccount for 16% of the variance in client outcome (Callahan\nin which the outcomes of trainees receiving supervision that\nincluded regular outcome feedback (n = 9) were compared\nwith the outcomes of trainees receiving supervision without\nregular outcome feedback (n = 10). Data included 115 psy-\nchotherapy cases collected over the course of a year. Trainees\nin the supervision-with-feedback condition had significantly\nbetter outcomes than trainees receiving supervision without\nfeedback. No significant differences were found between\nsupervisors within the treatment conditions (Reese et al.,\nOn the contrary, a recent study examined this topic with\na large sample from routine practice and found null results\n(Author & Coauthors, 2014). In this study, a 5-year archi-\nval naturalistic data set of psychotherapy outcomes from a\nprivate, nonprofit mental health center was used to test\nwhether client treatment outcomes (as measured by the\ning on who was providing the supervision (Lambert et al.,\ntherapists who were supervised by 14 supervisors. Results\nindicated that supervisors explained less than .01% of the\nvariance in client psychotherapy outcomes (Author, 2014).\nThus, the extent to which supervisors can affect client out-\ncome is still unclear. In light of these results, the question\nstill remains: To what extent does supervision impact cli-\nent outcome? In his summary of the research on the sub-\nject, Watkins (2011) concluded, \"After a century of\npsychotherapy supervision and over half a century of\nsupervision research, we still cannot empirically answer\nGiven this research, it is unrealistic to state that the pri-\nmary task of clinical supervision is to ensure the greatest\npossible treatment outcome for clients. Hence, there is a\nclear need to determine whether supervisors and supervisees\neven believe the supervision process is impactful on client\noutcome. If the existing literature suggests that supervision\nhas little impact on client outcome, it would be important to\ndetermine whether supervisors and supervisees share this\nperception.\nOur aim for this study, which has yet to be investigated,\nwas to use a mixed-methods design to better understand\nsupervisor and supervisee perceptions of the supervision\u00ad\nclient outcome relationship.\nThe first major goal of this investigation was to examine\nsupervisors' and supervisees' opinions of two questions: (a)\nWhat is the extent of impact supervisors can have on client out-\ncomes, and (b) how important is it that supervisors can affect\nclient outcome? Drawing from treatment-outcome literature\n(e.g., Lambert, 2013), these two questions explored four major\nareas of client outcome: positive impact of treatment, client\ndeterioration, client dropout, and speed/efficiency of treatment.\nIn addition, we sought to examine the relation between each\nparticipant's answers to the two research questions:\nResearch Question 1: What is the perceived impact of\nsupervision on client outcome?\nResearch Question 2: How important is it to supervisors\nand supervisees that supervision affects client outcome?\nThe second major goal of this study was to explore super-\nvisors' and supervisees' perspectives on how supervisors\naffect client outcome. In other words, what specific activities\nof supervision enable the supervisor to impact client out-\ncome? It is important to note that it is still unclear how super-\nvision may actually impact client outcome. Given the\nexploratory nature of this investigation, the authors did not\nmake any hypotheses about how supervisors and supervisees\nwould respond to the quantitative items or their open-ended\nqualitative responses to this topic.\nMethod\nParticipants\nSupervisors.The supervisor participants were 189 individu-\nals who were recruited through various listservs that were\nassociated with a variety of clinical, counseling, and educa-\ntion psychology graduate school programs. Of these partici-\nas male. Supervisors had an average age of 51.72 years (SD\nexperience practicing as a supervisor (SD = 9.7, range =\n1-46). The primary therapeutic modality most frequently\npracticed by supervisors was eclectic/integrative (28.7%),\nfollowed by cognitive-behavioral (17.9%), psychodynamic\n(15.9%), Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing\n(EMDR, 6.2%), interpersonal (5.6%), Rogerian/client-cen-\ntered (2.6%), experiential (2.1%), and other/no primary\nreported having their supervisees use quantitative outcome\nmeasures to assess client outcome.\nSupervisees.One hundred eighty-five supervisees com-\npleted the online survey. Supervisees came from a variety of\nRast et al. 3\ncounseling, clinical and education counseling graduate pro-\ngrams. Of the participants, the majority identified as female\ning with clients face-to-face. Supervisees were also asked to\nestimate the total number of clients they had worked with\nface-to-face and reported an average of 72.34 total clients\nsupervisees were in a master's program, 47.6% were in a\ndoctoral program, and 2.1% did not report their type of\ngraduate program. Supervisees reported that their primary\ntherapeutic modality was eclectic/integrative (29.3%),\nRogerian/client-centered (7.3%), interpersonal (6.3%),\nexperiential (2.6%), EMDR (.5%), and other/no primary\n(23.0%) modality. Supervisees reported that their supervi-\nsor's primary therapeutic modality was eclectic/integrative\n(18.8%), interpersonal (4.7%), Rogerian/client-centered\nmary modality (19.4%), and did not know their supervisor's\nof supervisees reported using quantitative outcome mea-\nsures to assess client outcome.\nTo explore whether any outstanding demographic differ-\nences existed, a series of independent-sample t tests and one-\nway ANOVAs were used to explore the demographic\ndifferences within supervisors' extent and importance on\nimpact scores. These tests explored both overall differences\nbetween the constructs of extent and importance of supervi-\nsion, as well as examined single-item variations for both\nsupervisors and supervisees. Within supervisees, a series of\nindependent-sample t tests and one-way ANOVAs were used\nto explore the demographic differences on extent and impor-\ntance of impact scores. All analyses were conducted through\nMeasures\nSupervisors. Supervisors completed an online survey with a\ntotal of 15 questions. The questions on the supervisor survey\nwere developed by the authors who are practicing supervi-\nsors and supervision researchers. The questions were then\npilot-tested with six practicing supervisors and revised for\nclarity. The first four questions in the survey were presented\nas a group, with the following header: \"For the specific areas\nbelow, rate the positive impact your supervision has on your\nsupervisees' clients' outcomes.\" The four areas were as fol-\nlows: (a) \"My supervision increases the positive impact of\nmy trainees' counseling/psychotherapy,\" (b) \"My supervi-\nsion prevents or reduces my trainees' client deterioration,\"\n(c) \"My supervision prevents or reduces my trainees' client\ndropout,\" and (d) \"My supervision increases the speed or\nefficiency of my trainees' counseling/psychotherapy.\" These\nquestions were answered along a 5-point Likert-type scale,\nfrom 1 = \"do not agree\" to 5 = \"totally agree,\" and a sum\nscore was computed.\nThe next four questions were presented as another group,\nwith the following header: \"When you consider the diverse\nrange of skills that someone must have to be an effective\nsupervisor, how important is the supervisor's overall ability\nto impact their supervisees' clients' outcomes?\" The four\nareas were as follows: (a) \"Increase the positive impact of\ncounseling/psychotherapy,\" (b) \"Prevent or reduce client\ndeterioration,\" (c) \"Prevent or reduce client dropout,\" and (d)\n\"Increase the speed or efficiency of counseling/psychother-\napy.\" These questions were answered also along a 5-point\nLikert-type scale, from 1 = \"no importance\" to 5 = \"highest\nimportance,\" and a sum score was computed. Cronbach's\nalpha for these items in this sample was .76, indicating fair\ninternal consistency.\nQuestions 9 and 10 asked whether supervisor participants\nhave their supervisees use quantitative measures to track\ntheir client outcome, and, if so, which measure(s). For the\nqualitative portion of this study, Question 11 asked, \"Other\nthan what has been identified above, please list any other\nways that you feel your supervision has a positive impact on\nyour supervisee's client's outcomes.\" This question allowed\nfor any length of answer. The remaining four items were\ndemographic questions (age, gender, primary therapeutic\norientation, and years of experience as a supervisor).\nSupervisees. Supervisees completed an online survey with a\ntotal of 18 questions. The questions on the supervisee survey\nwere developed by the authors who are supervisors, pilot-\ntested with six practicing supervisees, and revised for clarity.\nThe first four questions in the survey were presented as a\ngroup, with the following header: \"In your opinion, how\nmuch does your current primary individual supervisor help\nyou to help your clients?\" The four areas were as follows: (a)\n\"My supervisor helps me increase the positive impact of my\ncounseling/psychotherapy,\" (b) \"My supervisor helps me\nprevent or reduce the risk of my clients deteriorating,\" (c)\n\"My supervisor helps me prevent or reduce the risk of my\nclients dropping out,\" and (d) \"My supervisor helps me\nincrease the speed or efficiency of my counseling/psycho-\ntherapy.\" These questions were answered along a 5-point\nLikert-type scale, from 1 = \"do not agree\" to 5 = \"totally\nagree,\" and a sum score was computed. Cronbach's alpha for\nthese items in this sample was .87, indicating good internal\nconsistency.\nThe next four questions were presented as another group,\nwith the following header: \"In your opinion, how important is\nit that your supervisor is able to help you help your clients?\"\nThe four areas were as follows: (a) \"How important is it that\nyour supervisor can help you increase the positive impact of\nyour counseling/psychotherapy,\" (b) \"How important is it\nthat your supervisor can help you prevent or reduce the risk of\n4 SAGE Open\nclient deterioration,\" (c) \"How important is it that your super-\nvisor can help you prevent or reduce the risk of client drop-\nout,\" and (d) \"How important is it that your supervisor can\nhelp you increase the speed or efficiency of your counseling/\npsychotherapy.\" These questions were answered along a\n5-point Likert-type scale, from 1 = \"no importance\" to 5 =\n\"highest importance,\" and a sum score was computed.\nQuestions 9 and 10 asked whether supervisee participants\nhave their supervisees use quantitative measures to track their\nclient outcome, and, if so, which measure(s). Similar to super-\nvisor inquiry, Question 11 asked, \"Other than what has been\nidentified above, please list any other ways that you feel your\nsupervisor has a positive impact on your clients' outcomes.\"\nThis question allowed any length of answer. The remaining\nseven items were demographic questions (age, gender, pri-\nmary therapeutic orientation, supervisor's primary therapeutic\norientation, months of experience working with clients in\nface-to-face individual counseling/psychotherapy, total num-\nber of clients worked with in face-to-face individual counsel-\ning/psychotherapy, and type of degree program).\nQualitative Methodology\nA discovery-oriented-exploratory qualitative research method-\nology (Mahrer, 1988) was used to analyze supervisors'\nresponses to the question, \"Other than what has been identified\nabove, please list any other ways that you feel your supervisor\nhas a positive impact on your clients'outcomes,\" and supervis-\nees'responses to the question, \"Other than what has been iden-\ntified above, please list any other ways that you feel your\nsupervision has a positive impact on your supervisee's client's\noutcomes.\" Analysis was conducted by three of the authors,\nwho attempted to follow the guidelines of discovery-oriented\nmethodology (e.g., Yeh & Inman, 2007). Before starting data\nanalysis, the authors discussed their own expectations, values,\nand biases toward the research material, including assumptions\nbased on their self-identities, with an eye for the power differ-\nentials inherent in the roles of supervisor and supervisees.\nEach judge reviewed all of the supervisors' responses,\ncreating and sorting them into mutually exclusive categories.\nThe judges then met as a team to discuss their different cat-\negories and create a codebook. The team coded all of the\nsupervisors' responses, and disagreements were discussed\nand resolved by consensus. This process was repeated for the\nsupervisees' responses. The three judges came to consensus\non the supervisor and supervisee codes. The team then\nreviewed and discussed both codebooks, modifying and\nrecoding the associated responses until there was 100% con-\nsensus. Codes that represented fewer than 1.00% of partici-\npant responses were dropped from the codebook.\nProcedures\nParticipants for the supervisor and supervisee surveys were\nrecruited through purposive sampling using a wide range of\nemail listservs, including graduate programs, regional asso-\nciations, and national associations, and for specific therapeu-\ntic modalities (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy). As an\nincentive to participate, an opportunity to enter a drawing for\none of two US$50 Amazon.com gift certificates was offered.\nParticipation was voluntary and anonymous. The secure\nonline survey was hosted at http://www.psychdata.com. Both\nsurveys were available online for 2 weeks, during which\nParticipants with missing data or with z scores  |3.5| were\nremoved. Five supervisors and five supervisees were\nsupervisees.\nResults\nThe major goal of this investigation sought to explore the\nperspectives of both supervisors and supervisees on the\nextent and importance of which supervision impacts client\noutcome.\nDemographic Differences Between Supervisor\nand Supervisee Responses\nThrough a series of independent-sample t tests and one-way\nANOVAs, no significant differences were found within\nsupervisors regarding the extent or importance scores for\ngender, age, therapeutic modality, years of supervising, or\nbetween supervisors who used outcome measures and those\nwho did not. Furthermore, within supervisees, there were no\nsignificant differences found within extent and importance\nscores for gender, age, therapeutic modality, degree type,\nmonths of experience, number of clients, or between super-\nvisees whose supervisors used outcome measures and those\nwho did not.\nQuantitative Findings\nTo compare quantitative findings across supervisors and\nsupervisees, their responses to the four questions that made\nup extent of supervisor impact, and the four questions that\nmade up importance of supervisor impact, were totaled sepa-\nrately and then averaged. The average score for each main\nquestion can be found in Table 1.\nExtent of supervisor impact on outcomes\nOverall scores.A series of independent-sample t tests\nwere used to compare the average extent of impact scores\nOn average, supervisors showed positive scores of M =\nbetween the groups.

A series of independent-sample t tests\nwere used to compare differences between supervisors (n =\nfour items related to the importance of impact (5-8). There\nwere no significant differences between supervisors and\nsupervisees on Item 7 or 8. Significance levels and t-scores\nfor all items can be found in Table 1.\nItem 5 asked about the importance of supervision in\nincreasing the positive impact of counseling/psychotherapy.\nOn average, supervisors showed positive scores of M = 4.18,\nSD = 0.71, and supervisees also showed positive scores of M\nCI = [-.37, .09], between the groups. This difference was\nsupervisees found supervision to be more important than\nsupervisors for increasing the positive impact of counseling/\npsychotherapy.\nItem 6 asked about the importance of supervision in\npreventing or reducing client deterioration. On average,\nsupervisors showed positive scores of M = 4.01, SD =\n0.73, and supervisees also showed positive scores of M =\nindicating that supervisees found supervision to be more\nimportant than supervisors for preventing or reducing cli-\nent deterioration.\nQualitative Data\nsupervisees responded to the qualitative questions. The qual-\nitative methodology aimed to examine the various ways that\nsupervisors and supervisees perceived supervision to impact\nclient outcome.\nSupervisor responses.In response to the question \"ways\nthat feel your supervision has a positive impact on your\nsupervisees' clients' outcomes,\" the highest responses\nindicated references to personal/professional growth by\nsupervisees. Examples such as \"helping supervisee iden-\ntify and address their own `self of therapist' issues that\narise\" and \"professional development issues for supervis-\nees\" accounted for slightly less than half of all supervisor\nresponses. The second most frequently endorsed response\nspecified references to the therapeutic relationship as most\nimpactful to positive client outcomes. Supervisors reported\nexamples such as \"By drawing attention toward issues of\ncountertransference and interpersonal impact of client on\nclinician and vice versa\" and \"challenging them to develop\na collaborative relationship with their clients.\" Descriptive\nstatistics and content of qualitative supervisor data can be\nseen in Table 2.\nTable 1.

In response to the question \"ways that\nyou feel your supervisor has a positive impact on your cli-\nents' outcomes,\" the highest endorsed responses related to\nreferences to the supervisory relationship with examples\nsuch as \"my supervisor helps me feel validated and sup-\nported, and me going into therapy with that sense is a benefit\nto clients, leading to better outcomes for them\" and \"by sup-\nporting me and making sure that I am being the best therapist\nI can be for those clients.\" The second most frequently\nendorsed responses referred to references to learning psy-\nchotherapy models and techniques. These responses con-\nsisted of examples such as \"she provides great treatment and\nactivity ideas, since she has some specialty areas that I also\nhave clients in\" and \"she helps by offering techniques and\nstrategies I can use within session with my clients.\" Descrip-\ntive statistics and content of qualitative supervisee data can\nbe seen in Table 3.\nDiscussion\nThe purpose of this study was to explore the perceived extent\nand importance of impact that supervision has on client out-\ncome. The first overarching finding within the study was that\nboth supervisor and supervisee participants appeared to have\na positive endorsement (i.e., agreement that supervision was\nimportant and impactful) in their responses to the research\nquestions:\nResearch Question 1: What is the perceived impact of\nsupervision on client outcome?\nResearch Question 2: How important is it to supervisors\nand supervisees that supervision affects client outcome?\nThese results are not surprising, given that current models of\nsupervision indicate that one of the primary tasks of supervi-\nsion is to ensure the best outcome for clients and would\nRast et al. 7\ntherefore suggest that supervisors and supervisees would\nlikely assume it is both beneficial and important (Falender &\nShafranske, 2004). Participant responses were consistently\npositive across all four major areas of client outcome that\nwere addressed (increasing positive impact of treatment,\nreducing client deterioration, reducing client dropout, and\nincreasing speed/efficiency of treatment). These findings\nhave strong support from both the quantitative and qualita-\ntive data, suggesting that there is a stark contrast with how\npositively supervisors and supervisees view the impact of\nsupervision in comparison with current outcome research,\nwhich suggests that supervision may have a smaller impact\non outcome than previously believed (Ladany & Inman,\n2012). Notably, in the qualitative data, only six supervisors\nand seven supervisees expressed hesitation or doubts about\nthe impact of supervision on client outcome. The responses\nof both groups (supervision and supervisees) to the two\nmajor research questions revealed significant correlations,\nsuggesting that participants who thought that supervisors can\nimpact client outcome also thought that it was important that\nTable 3.

Overall, there were no significant differences\nbetween supervisors' and supervisees' perception of the\nextent that supervision can impact client outcome, suggest-\ning that both groups find supervision equally impactful on\nclient outcomes.\nConversely, the findings revealed that supervisors and\nsupervisees did differ in their perceptions on the impor-\ntance of supervision, with significant differences between\nthe two groups in how they responded to questions relat-\ning to the importance of supervision impacting client out-\ncome. The data indicated that supervisees perceive\nsupervision as more important to impacting client out-\ncome than supervisors do. In addition, within the con-\nstruct of importance to impact, supervisees perceived\nsupervision as more important than supervisors for\nincreasing positive impact of therapy, as well as for pre-\nventing or reducing client deterioration.\nThe second goal of this study was to explore partici-\npants' opinions regarding how supervisors affect client\noutcome. Participants responded in a variety ways, with\nresponses ranging from a supportive supervisory rela-\ntionship to general techniques and tools. Participants also\nreported that various aspects of supervision that address\nspecific treatment variables benefit client outcome (e.g.,\n\"psychotherapy models and techniques,\" \"therapeutic\nrelationship\"). Conversely, both supervisors and super-\nvisees reported that the aspects of supervision that address\nthese variables at the supervisee level would also benefit\nclient outcome. For example, \"supervisee growth\" was\nthe most frequently reported category for supervisors,\nand the third most frequently reported for supervisees.\nFurther research into what constitutes \"supervisee\ngrowth\" and how it has a positive impact on client out-\ncome is needed.\nTwo notable differences within the qualitative data\nbetween supervisor and supervisee responses stood out.\nSupervisees reported the \"supervisory relationship\" as more\nimpactful to client outcome, whereas more than twice as\nmany supervisors endorsed the \"therapeutic relationship.\"\nThese findings suggest a significant difference in perspec-\ntive between the two groups regarding the relative impor-\ntance of the supervisory and therapeutic relationship. In\naddition, these results suggest that further research is needed\nin exploring what aspects of both the supervisory and thera-\npeutic relationships in clinical supervision are impacting cli-\nent outcome, if at all.\nImplications and Future Directions\nOverall, the data suggest that the impact of supervision on\nclient outcome, as perceived by the supervisors and super-\nvisees, is perceived to be a complex process by both groups,\ninvolving a coalescence of treatment, supervisee, and\nsupervision variables. Supervisors and supervisees both\nview supervision as important; however, supervisees feel\nsupervision is more important in comparison with supervi-\nsors. These may suggest that supervisees value more sup-\nport, feedback, and guidance from their supervisors,\nregardless of potential impact on client outcome. Despite\nthese differences, the data suggest that both groups feel\nsupervision is important to client outcome. These findings\nwould seem predictable of \"common sense.\" However, the\nresults of this study have yet to be quantitatively or qualita-\ntively established in the existing literature. Furthermore,\nthis research is necessary to identify what supervisors and\nsupervisees believe is impacted by supervision, if not client\noutcome (e.g., supervisee professional identity, supportive\nenvironment for supervisees, etc.).\nCurrent research suggests that supervision, theoreti-\ncally and in clinical practice, has a minimal impact on cli-\nent outcome, despite the primary task of supervision being\nto ensure the best possible outcome for the client. Most\nsupervisors and supervisees proceed within supervision as\nif it is both important and impactful to client outcome.\nHowever, if client outcome is not being impacted by super-\nvision, further research is needed to determine what in\nsupervision may actually be impacted. Furthermore, if we\nproceed as though supervision is both important and\nimpactful to client outcome, future studies would need to\nexamine what aspects of clinical supervision actually\nimpact outcome and what practices would need to be\nchanged to ensure a positive impact on client outcome,\nallowing for an opportunity to improve upon future models\nof supervision.\nGiven the discrepancy between study participants' beliefs\nthat supervision is both impactful and important, and the out-\ncome research that suggests a smaller effect, there is a clear\nneed to uncover what it is about supervision that results in\nthis endorsement by supervisors and supervisees. It is possi-\nble that a similar self-assessment bias thatWalfish, McAlister,\nO'Donnell, and Lambert (2012) found among practicing\npsychotherapists is occurring at a supervision level, where\nsupervisors and supervisees have a tendency to overestimate\nthe ability of contemporary supervision practices to impact\nclient outcome. Supervisors and supervisees may be using\npositive perceptions of supervision as another means of\nmaintaining morale in the face of challenging clients within\na demanding field. \"Self-assessment bias may simply be the\nunconscious attempt to stay motivated in the face of very dif-\nficult client problems and circumstances\" (Walfish et al.,\nRast et al. 9\nLimitations\nThere are multiple limitations that are often associated with a\nnonstandardized, self-report survey. Underreporting of nega-\ntive behaviors and responding to questions in a way that por-\ntrays the responder in a positive regard are the two most\ncommon limitations associated with this method of research\n(Donaldson & Grant-Vallone, 2002). In addition, nonstandard-\nized, self-report survey research may also focus too broadly on\na range of topics, which may result in a lack of depth or full\nunderstanding in the topic at hand. The qualitative portion of\nthis research was conducted with these limitations in mind,\nand the shortcomings of this research methodology were taken\ninto account when examining the results.\nAnother limitation of this study may be attributed to the\nfact that the survey only asked for supervisees to comment\non their experiences with their current supervisor. It is pos-\nsible that supervisees may have had a different experience\nwith supervision overall. It should be noted that supervisees\nmay have responded differently to the study if the question\ninquired about overall supervision experiences.\nA major limitation to this study pertains to the question\nused to address the qualitative aspect of this study. The quali-\ntative question had a narrow focus, potentially limiting the\nrange of answers that supervisees and supervisors could have\nprovided. By specifically asking supervisees what their\nsupervisors contributed to having a positive impact on their\nclients' outcome, the opportunity to explore an organic,\nbroad-range response from supervisees about what they felt\nwas impactful was lost. While a more open-ended question\nmay have been beneficial in this instance, the exploratory\nnature of this study benefited with the specific question to\nuse as a reference point to guide future research on this topic.\nSeveral of the limitations within this study can be attrib-\nuted to the restrictive nature of the qualitative portion, which\nwas constrained by the format of an Internet-based survey.\nThis medium of data collection prevented any modification\nto the research question, limiting the spontaneity of natural\nresponses between participant and researcher. Future\nresearch could implement the interview approach to allow\nfor more in-depth responses from participants and a more\nconductive relationship between researcher and participant.\nThe mixed-methods approach of this study may have\nimpacted potential responses from participants. The quanti-\ntative portion was administered before the qualitative ques-\ntions, which may have primed participant responses. In\naddition, the qualitative coding done by the researchers may\nhave been unknowingly influenced by the biases of the team\nmembers. Although precautions were taken in an attempt to\ncombat these biases, it is possible that biases shared by the\nthree-team members may have potentially influenced the\nresults. Further research would be helpful to capture a wider\nunderstanding of what supervisees find helpful to client out-\ncomes from their supervisors and would be able to account\nfor the potential limitations that exist within this study.\nIn summary, these results indicated that both supervisors\nand supervisees believe that supervision has an impact on\nclient outcome; however, there is no clear consensus of how\nsupervision impacts client outcome and to what degree.\nFurther research is needed to explore what aspects of super-\nvision, if any, impact client outcome.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nBambling, M., King, R., Raue, P., Schweitzer, R., & Lambert, W.\n(2006).
