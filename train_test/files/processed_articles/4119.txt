    "abstract": "Abstract\nA common goal when analyzing a social network is to try and determine the cohesive subgroup structure of the network.\nSome techniques result in complex overlapping structures such as cliques or k-plexes whereas others either partition the\nnetwork or place actors into unique groups, for example factions or components. A standard method implemented in\nUcinet uses the overlapping structure to construct a proximity matrix which can be submitted to a clustering routine to\nfind non-overlapping groups. Once the groups have been determined many analysts relate these to observations they have\nmade involving their data. There are few techniques that take the groups as a starting point for additional analysis with\nthe exception of Krachardts work on Simelian ties. In this paper I examine the roles the actors play in the cohesive\nstructure using the brokerage ideas of Gould and Fernandez. The method is demonstrated on an original dataset that was\ncollected in 2006 on 100 social services based in a suburb area of Milan, Italy. The dataset is composed of a matrix that\ncontains directed data collected by asking the spokesperson of every social service if he/she knows the other services\nlisted (the list of services having been previously compiled using several sources), together with attribute information.\nThe matrix is analyzed using the clique analysis techniques in the Ucinet software package to find non-overlapping\ngroups. The results are submitted to Ucinets brokerage routine and visualized using the Netdraw software package. This\nanalysis offers a new insight into the data, as it is possible to identify what actors play important roles (and which kind of\nrole) in bridging the gaps between the cohesive subgroups.\n",

Scholars have proposed several\nmethods which look at partitions, like factions or components; which search for cohesive structures, like\ncliques, n-cliques (Luce and Perry 1949), n-clans, k-plex (Seidman and Foster 1978), lambda sets (Borgatti,\nEverett and Shirey 1990); or which simply assign actors to specific groups, like core or peripheries (Borgatti\nand Everett 1999), again based on how much these substructures are cohesive or not. But there are few\ntechniques that take these cohesive subgroups as a starting point for further analysis. One recent exception is\nKrackhardts work on simmelian ties, which explores the possibility of analysing actors roles between groups\n(Krackhardt 2007) using the E-I index (Krackhardt and Stern 1988).This technique reveals who within a\nnetwork connects different subgroups in terms of being related not only to people who are strongly embedded\nin cohesive substructures, but also sending ties to other subgroups. This secondary analysis is interesting, but\nit shows some weakness I will address in this paper.\nHere I want to propose a new way to analyse a network structure that combines two well known techniques:\nclique analysis and brokerage roles. While these methods are certainly not new, the combination of the two is\nsomehow innovative and offers meaningful insights as it shows not only which actors are embedded in\ncohesive subgroups and who plays important roles of mediation but also describes what kind of roles these\nare. The method is demonstrated on an original dataset that was collected in 2006 on 100 social services based\nin a suburb of Milan, Italy.\nThe paper also addresses a theoretical claim which will need further work to be empirically tested but shows\nsome potential. The idea is to combine two classic and opposite theoretical standpoints from within the social\ncapital debate: collaboration VS competition and public VS private goods. Here I want to see how these two\ndifferent perspectives can be combined and coexist within the same social structure.\nThe first section of the paper offers an overview of the theoretical background on Krackhardts ,,simmelian\nties and Gould and Fernandes ,,brokerage roles in order to see how is it possible to combine the two\nmethods and what are the limits of these techniques. The second section briefly describes the organisation of\nsocial services in Italy, explaining how it has changed in recent years and why we need new and more\nsophisticated research methods if we are to explore its structure. The third section describes the research\nproject and the data collected, which are analysed in the following section using the method proposed. In the\nlast section I discuss the findings, address theoretical issues and suggest furthers areas of exploration which\nare needed in order to give strength to the proposed technique.\nBackground theory\nThe ,,simmelian tie is a useful concept that has been proposed by Krackhardt in several articles. In the very\nfirst paper (Krackhardt 1998) he builds upon Granovetters idea of strong ties (1973), which focuses on dyads,\nextending the concept to triads by way of a discussion of Simmels analysis of differences between dyads and\ntriads. The latter, Krackhardt observes, allow actors to play several roles not permitted in dyadic interactions.\nAccording to Simmel (1983), triads are different from dyads because they are characterised by reduced\nindividuality, reduced individual power and moderated conflict. Krackhardt also notes how implementing the\nnumber of actors up to more than three does not change the formal features of the structure, thus he focuses on\ntriads as his units of analysis. Thus, Krackhardt concludes that \u00abthe key to understanding the quality of a tie\nbetween two actors can be reduced to asking whether it is part of a strong triad or not\u00bb (Krackhardt 1998: 24).\nHe then proposes the definition of simmelian ties, which are ties reciprocated and reciprocally connected to at\nleast one third person. As he points out, this concept resembles the one of clique, defined by Luce & Perry\n(1949) as a maximum subgraph connecting at least three nodes. Because the Ucinet (Borgatti, Everett and\nFreeman 2002) routine that is used to extract cliques needs symmetrical data as an input1, we can further\nspecify that simmelian ties are ties embedded in cliques that are extracted after symmetrizing the data at the\nminimum level (therefore selecting only reciprocated ties).\nEven more interestingly, Krackhardt statistically demonstrates that \u00absimmelian ties are \"sticky\" \u00ad that is, they\nwill last longer than other forms of merely strong ties\u00bb, and that \u00absimmelian ties will occur with greater\nfrequency than would be expected by chance, given the overall structure of the relations\u00bb (Krackhardt 1998:\n25). This means that simmelian ties, even following a stricter definition than asymmetric or sole symmetric\nties (the latter are defined as reciprocated ties not embedded in cliques, see Krackhardt 1999: 186), are\n\u00abbacked up by the normative power of the groups, providing stability beyond that experienced by bridges or\n1 This is because ties have to be symmetric in order to fit into the clique definition of a maximum subgraph.\nIn a subsequent paper Krackhardt (1999) goes further, comparing simmelian ties analysis with Burts (1992)\nconception of structural holes effects. While Granovetter has stressed the importance of the quality of the tie\n(strong or weak) in order to provide advantage to the individual, Burts analysis only concerns if a tie is a\nbridge or not, arguing that bridging ties, independently of strength, are less constraining on the actor than non\nbridging ties. Krackhardt disagrees with Burts interpretation, because he sees people who act as bridges\nbetween cohesive subgroups as constrained by as many sets of rules as the number of groups they belong to.\nWith the concept of simmelian ties the author demonstrates that people embedded in triads are committed to\nthe triadic forces described by Simmel (reduced individuality, reduced individual power, moderated conflict)\nthus the more subgroups they are embedded into the more constrained they are by these forces. Krackhardt\n(1999) goes further arguing that his analysis works better when people play public roles, while Burts analysis\nis more suitable for private roles. Here the claim goes to a theoretical level, as the author is trying to make a\nstatement about the outcome of individual structural roles in terms of social capital.\nKrackhardt analyses the constraint effect of cliques within an organization in the Silicon Valley (1992; 1999)\nwhere employers started a union certification drive. He found that people occupying a position of mediation\nwere constrained regarding the expression of their personal point of view due to the fact they belonged to\ndifferent subgroups; thus the information flow was reduced through structural holes rather than being more\neffective, as Burt says in his theory of brokerage roles. But Burts analysis is informed by a concept of social\ncapital as a private and scarce good, which is hard to get and stimulates competition between actors. The\nKrackhardts scenario is far more complex than that, as in Silicon Valley there were actors collaborating for\nthe same goal (the union certificate) and competing for different standings (to approve it or not). If we see\nsocial capital as a private good that is produced by personal relationship via strategic interactions then it is\neasier to describe relationships in terms of competitiveness. But such a situation is not always true, as there\nare many situations in which actors are embedded in social structures that need both competitiveness and\ncollaboration, whose outcome in terms of social capital is both private and collective. I will go back to this\npoint in the next section, where I describe the contemporary scenario which Italian social services are dealing\nwith.\nRecently, in his keynote address at the UK Social Network Conference (2007)2 Krackhardt has proposed to\nuse the E-I index - defined as the number of ties external to the groups minus the number of ties that are\ninternal to the group divided by the total number of ties (Krackhardt and Stern 1988) - on simmelian ties. This\nmethod allows us to explore which actors play important roles of mediation between groups. As such it is both\ninteresting and useful. But it does not allow us to describe what kind of role, and furthermore does not take\ninto account structural holes. It could therefore also be distorted by redundancy in ties.\nHere I want to improve upon and develop Krackhardts insights by using Gould and Fernandez measures of\nbrokerage roles (1989) applied to non overlapping cliques: clique analysis and brokerage roles can be seen in\nsimilar terms, as cliques can be defined as transitive triples (because they are formed by reciprocal ties), while\n\u00abany brokered exchange can be thought of as a relation involving three actors, two of whom are the actual\nparties to the transaction and one of whom is the intermediary or broker\u00bb (Gould and Fernandez 1989: 91) and\nmoreover \u00abbrokerage represent an intransitive triple\u00bb (Ibid: 97). The authors propose a classification of the\nforms of brokerage relations that is \u00aban exhaustive listing of the possible types of two-step paths on which any\nactor may lie, and it is thus an exclusive and exhaustive partition of any actor j's total raw brokerage score tj\n\u00bb\n(Ibid: 101). They identify five types of roles, according to the direction of the ties and the groups actors\nbelong to. In a situation where a sends a tie to b who sends a tie to c and there are no ties between a and c, the\nfive possible brokerage roles of b are:\n- Coordinator: a, b and c belong to the same group.\n- Itinerant broker (consultant): a and c belong to the same group, while b belongs to a different one.\n- Gatekeeper: a and b belong to the same group, while c belongs to a different one.\n- Representative: b and c belong to the same group, while a belongs to a different one.\n- Liason: all the actors belong to different groups.\nThe standard method implemented in Ucinet (Borgatti, Everett and Freeman 2002) calculates how many times\nevery actor in a network plays these brokerage roles between groups, giving the total amount of brokerage\nroles as well. Thus it is possible, once the groups are determined, to explore not only if an actor plays a\nbrokerage role, but also what kind of role s/he is playing and within which groups: given the fact that groups\nhere are cohesive subgroups formed by simmelian ties, this method allows to analyse a network looking only\nto relational data, without using nodes attributes (which are normally used to define groups when looking for\nbrokerage roles) unless for a secondary interpretation of the findings.\nThe importance of proposing a technique that focuses on ties rather than on nodes does not lie only on a\nmethodological level. It has theoretical significance. The social capital debate has been dealing with this\naspect since its very first formulation by Bourdieu (1992) and Coleman (1998), the first claiming that social\ncapital is a private resource that people strategically accumulate from the network of relationships they are\nembedded into, the second assuming that social capital is an unintentional public outcome of human\ncollaboration. Bourdieus view concerns actors, while Coleman tries to shift the attention to ties. But it has\nbeen Putnam, with the distinction between bonding and bridging ties (Putnam 2000), who has definitely tried\nto move the analysis from actors to ties.\nBut Putnams theory has not defined what is actually exchanged through these social capital ties, as the\ndistinction between bonding and bridging rests on the ideas of homophily and heterophily. Bonding ties occur\nbetween people in similar situations, while bridging ties connect people in different positions. While the\ndescription of the output of these ties does refer to the content of exchange (as bonding ties are useful for the\ndevelopment of reciprocity and solidarity, while bridging ties are valuable resources of innovation), the way in\nwhich the author looks at them is based again on actors attributes, either a quality or a position of the actor.\nAlso Lins idea of homophily and heterophily (2001) is affected by the limit of considering actors and their\nposition rather than the real exchange that flows through ties. As Barbieri (2005) pointed out, while Lins\ntheory seems to consider social capital in terms of material and non material resources exchanged within a\nnetwork, when Lin measures individual social capital with the position generator method he takes into account\nthe positions an actor can occupy mobilising his or her contacts, thus using a status rank.\nThe method I propose here is built only on relations, as it looks at transitivity within triples (cliques), and\nintransitivity between non overlapping cliques. The outcome gives a definition of the position an actor\noccupies within a network and his or her consequent role, but this definition entirely depends on the ties this\nactor is embedded into.\nThe scenario: third sector and social capital in Italy\nThe research I present here was led by the Centre for the Study of Fashion and Cultural Production of Catholic\nUniversity of Milan for the social cooperative A77 that addresses substance abuse amongst young people. The\ncooperative requested a map of the network of social services in a suburb of Milan where it operates: the\npurpose of the map being to give the cooperative a valid instrument for directing people with a dependency\nproblem to the right service, assuming that dependency is never a problem related to a single aspect of people\nlives, but needs a multidimensional approach in order to avoid fragmentation of care. Especially when dealing\nwith youth, it is important to involve the complete network of people (adults and peers) the person is in\ncontact with. Carers need to activate a network of intervention, which takes into account the individual in all\nhis or her needs, from school, to work, free time, health services and so on. This also requires the carer to have\nthe adequate resources for suggesting the right service (or several services) that can help the individual in\nfacing different aspects of his or her problem. Relying on other services does not mean passing the\nresponsibility of an intervention to another service but rather activating nurturing collaborations between the\npublic, private and non profit services within a local territory.\nThus, the problem for the cooperative can be reduced to a lack of coordination between the different social\nservices of a suburb, a problem that is related to the shift from the welfare state to what has been called the\nthird sector. Folgheraiter (2006) describes this shift as a change from the right to be assisted, typical in a\nwelfare state, to the duty of feeling good, where the social system has to offer standardised and rationale\nservices sustainable from an economic point of view. The rationalisation of the system needs specialised\nservices that can be sold on the market of the new welfare, in which the policy buys social work according to\nan optimization of budget and resources. This shift from the right to be assisted, that needed a welfare state, to\nthe duty of feeling good, which is based instead on the market optimisation of the social services, has\nproduced an increasing distance between social policy and social work. The first is concentrated into making\nlaws that optimise the system, creating quality standards and dealing with the budget, while the second is\nfragmented into a multiple micro reality where there is a lack of a general view and of coordination.\nThe general idea is thus that social work is just the executive aspect of social policy, without a general\noverview and the capacity of planning at the macro level. Furthermore, consumerism has infected the social\nsystem, as services are seen as pre-made and standard goods that can be sold on the market, while according\nto Folgheraiter (2006), a helping offer, as social capital, can be produced only by social relationships. The\nsocial capital perspective here is the one of Coleman (1998), who intends it as an emergent good that is\nproduced by the network of relationships and goes beyond the individual interest becoming a public good\nwhose effects spread on the entire community.\nFolgheraiter (2006) describes the contemporary Italian system of welfare as a \u00abquasi-market\u00bb, as the\ngovernment (national as well as local) assure free interventions for citizens, granting everyone the right of a\nsocial and health system, but it buys these services on a semi market that is organised and controlled by policy\nmakers via outsourcing and commitment. This mixed logic (of public welfare and semi-private market) has\nlead to an increased competition between the social services, as they have to win funding and prove quality,\nbut the quality standards are based on the process of services (how much does it cost? How long does it take?)\nmore than on products (is it actually effective? Does it improve the life standard of problematic people?). Also\nthe author notes that the main idea behind a welfare system is to offer ready-to-go solutions, in terms of a full\npackage of intervention that weaken the individual and collective ability of problem solving. This means that\nthe welfare system has weakened social capital, meaning that the capacity to activate a network of\nrelationships when facing a problem is reduced.\nIn such a situation, social network analysis is the right instrument not only to map the various connections\nbetween the social services, but also to identify the roles of actors within the network.\nThe data\nThe data I present were collected in autumn 2006 for a research project commissioned by a social service\n(A77) that deals with any kind of addiction and it is based in a suburb of Milan. The purpose of the project\nwas to map the network of all public and private institutions and firms that offer any kind of activity and\nsupport for youths. Because A77 deals with addiction, the main goal of the research was to map all the\nservices can address the complex needs of problematic youth, according to the idea that a good intervention\ncan be effective only when it activates the complete network a person is embedded into.\nThe research involved two phases:\n1. I identified all services that offer youth activities and support in the suburb of Milan where A77 operates.\nThis search was conducted by Internet as well as through examination of archives for any kind of service that\ncorresponded to research criteria (i.e. served young people aged between 15 and 30 years old).\n2. I sent a questionnaire to every service mapped in the first phase (the initial number was 127, but I cut it\ndown sampling some of the categories, like churches and gyms), asking for details on the kind of service\n(public, private, non profit), the average number of people served, the kind of activities offered. This\ninformation has been coded as attributes, according to:\na. The kind of service (kindser3): these are coded as following:\n1. churches\n3 We code the kind of attribute with a tag that reminds the nature of the attribute. These are the tags we will use during analysis in\nreferring to a specific kind of attribute.\n2. psychological services\n3. sporting clubs\n4. cultural and artistic centres\n5. social coop\n6. instruction and education institutes\n7. youth clubs\n8. international cooperation (one case)\nb. The institutional typology (type):\n2. non profit\n4. religious\nc. The age of people served (age, see Table 1). Even if I selected services according to the young age of\npeople addressed, some services do address also adults as well as elderly people:\nTable 1: age of people served\nCode Category From To\nd. The kind of problems the services address (problem):\n1. Children with familiar problems\n2. Marginalised people (homeless, illegal immigrants)\n3. Drug and alcohol addicted\n4. Foreigners\n5. Disabilities\n6. Non problematic people\ne. The activities offered (activ): these are listed in a affiliation matrix, where rows are social services and\ncolumns are activities, like courses in painting, writing, reading, DIY, dance, yoga, foreign languages, Italian\nlanguage, theatre, music, cinema, computer, as well as psychological counselling, legal counselling, school\nsupport, job an school orientation, family support, religious meetings, peer aggregation.\nNext I listed all the services and asked participants to indicate which they knew. I also asked if they knew\nother similar services. This latter question generated 50 new names that I added to the original list and\nresubmitted to all participants. In some cases it was not possible to obtain data, as services refused to answer\nthe questionnaire (one case) or, as public services, they needed special authorization from the city council that\nwould take too long. I thus collected data on 100 social services, for which I construct an adjacency (actor by\nactor) matrix containing data on the knowledge each service has of all the others; I call this matrix the\nknowledge network. An analysis of the knowledge network is an important preliminary step to an analysis of\ncollaborative and other stronger ties. It is firstly important to see if individual service providers are aware one\nof the other, as they would never be able to activate collaborations if they do not know that other services exist\nin the area.\nThen I asked these services if they ever collaborate together: again, the data on the 100 social services were\nstored in a matrix that I called the collaboration network. This network is more interesting in terms of social\ncapital, as it reveals the size of existing collaborations, thus ties here are more meaningful than the simple\nknowledge network. The problem is that it is not possible to apply the method I want to propose on this\nnetwork, because as I previously said, brokerage roles can be measured only for directed data, for they entail,\nby definition, intransitive triples. The collaboration network I mapped is indeed directed, but the lack of\nsymmetry in ties is due to the fact that some services (especially bigger or older ones) might not remember all\nthe collaborations they activated in the past, while smaller or newer services will probably recall more\noutgoing ties. But collaboration is by definition a symmetric tie, as it is not possible to collaborate with\nsomeone who does not collaborate back. Due to the fact brokerage roles cannot be measured for this network,\nI decided to apply the method only on the knowledge matrix.\nThis generates another limitation in the analysis, as we should assume that in order to be brokers people must\nbe aware of their role. By definition, a broker is someone who plays an intermediary role between two others,\nand the term originally refers to a business context, even if it can be used more widely, including the senses of\njobber, agent, factor, or commission-agent. Here I stretch the sense of the term referring to anyone who is in\nthe middle of a structural hole (Burt 1992) no matter what is the context. What I am looking for here is then\nthe potential role some services can play in order to increase the collective awareness of the local offer, as\nwell as their strategic position within the network in terms of competition against same kind of services. The\nbrokerage roles here are then intended as potential key roles in terms of diffusion or control of the circulation\nof information.\nMethod and findings\nBefore analysing the network in order to find brokerage roles between cohesive subgroups it is useful to run\nsome preliminary analysis that describes the overall structure of the network. The knowledge network\nactivates only the 15% of possible ties but 93 out of 100 nodes belong to the strong component, and the\naverage distance is 2.3 nodes. Thus, even with a low density, the knowledge network is somehow well\nconnected, as most of its nodes are reachable by others with an average short path.\nAs the goal of the analysis is to reveal the structure for potential synergies, I then analyse densities between\ndifferent groups, where these groups are defined by nodes attributes. First of all I calculate the average value\nof density between different kinds of services (kindser), see Table 2:\nTable 2: Density / average value within blocks (kindser)\nChurches Psyco\nserv.\nSport Culture/art Social\ncoop.\nEducation Youth\nclubs\nIntern.\nCoop.\nPsyco\nserv.\nSocial\ncoop.\nYouth\nclubs\nIntern.\nCoop.\nThe density matrix, partitioned by the kind of service, shows that psychological services seem to know better\nsocial cooperatives (activating the 29% of the possible ties) and youth clubs (25% of possible ties); on the\nother hand, social cooperatives know better psychological services (26%), sporting clubs and cultural and\nartistic centres (22%), instruction and education institutes (39%) and youth clubs (38%). Finally, youth clubs\nknow better social cooperatives (33%). Indeed diagonal values (indicating awareness of same kind of\nservices) are not dramatically high, but they are still higher than other values, especially regarding social\ncooperatives (45%), instruction and educational centres (45%) and youth clubs (38%). Values for group 8 are\nnot significant as there is only one service belonging to this group.\nAverage values of density partitioned by the institutional typology of centres (type) are shown in table 3:\nTable 3: Density / average value within blocks (type)\nProfit Non profit Public Religious\nHere values (also diagonal ones) are even lower than before, meaning that the public sector, as well as the\nprivate, the non profit and the religious one again enjoy only a poor knowledge of the existence of other\nservices, even within the same category as them.\nFinally Table 4 shows average values of density partitioned by the age of people served (age):\nTable 4: Density / average value within blocks (age)\nAll Late inf. Adults Child/teen Child/youth Elderly\nHere we can notice that only services addressed to adults and elderly are aware of each other, meaning there is\nnot intergenerational contact. Services for children and teenagers show the highest value on diagonal, meaning\nthat they are aware of the local offer for people of this age.\nLooking at densities partitioned by attributes, while interesting, does not allow us to explore the specific role\nof every actor within the network. Moreover, it is based not on the structure of the network, but on actors\nattributes. The method I propose here allows us to overcome these two main problems, as it refers only to\nrelational data and gives details of each actors roles. The method implies several steps: the first step is to\nidentify and select symmetrical (reciprocated) ties only, discarding non-reciprocated ties for the purposes of\nthis analysis. This step is mandatory because cliques are by definition maximally complete subgraphs, and if\nthere are directed and non symmetric ties the subgraph would not be maximal. Because the ties are\nsymmetrised and embedded in cliques, they can be considered as simmelian ties, or transitive triples. The\nsubsequent step consists into submitting the matrix to Ucinet routine that analyses cliques. This routine allows\nsetting the minimum size of the clique: a good way to run clique analysis is then to find the best size of\ncliques in order to reveal a structure where the number of cliques is not too high and it does include as much\nnodes as it can. Thus I set the minimum size of cliques at 4, and I found 18 cliques which involve 33 out of\nUcinet then automatically submits the clique output to hierarchical clustering to find non overlapping cliques,\nwhich means intransitive triples. Figure 1 shows the hierarchical clustering of overlap matrix. We can now\nvisualise the actor by actor co-membeship matrix via Netdraw (Borgatti 2002) where the size of the ties\nrepresent the number of cliques two nodes share in common (see Figure 2). If we do not consider isolates, we\nsee that the network has two main components showing a very interesting structure. There are nodes\nconnecting different parts of the network, acting as bridges between denser parts. An isolate position here\ndoes not indicate that these services do not activate any ties, but only that they do not activate simmelian ties.\nThus it is arguable that there would be services within cliques groups and outside them (isolates) that can act\nas bridges in the network.\nFigure 1: Hierarchical Clustering of overlap matrix\nFigure 2: Visualization of cliques co-membership matrix.\nSize of ties = no. of cliques in common\nIn order to reveal these bridging roles, I decided to start from the clique structure and identify these positions\nusing the measure for brokerage roles. Gould and Fernandez technique for identifying brokerage roles is\nbased on the idea that brokers connect people according to the groups they belong to: thus I decided to divide\nthe network into groups according to the non overlapping clique structure. Using the hierarchical cluster\nanalysis of overlapping cliques (each comprising 4 nodes) I select the level on which we can identify the\nmaximum number of towers (that is level 1, which means that people clustered in the same tower share an\naverage of 1 clique together, see Figure 1) and assign a number to people belonging to the same tower.\nAt level 1 we find 9 groups:\n1. Sporting clubs\n2. Sporting clubs\n3. Supporting services for problematic youth dedicated to solidarity actions\n4. Youth clubs (youth clubs and leisure services)\n5. Schools and education services\n6. The public drug addiction centre and a youth club\n7. A youth club and a public library\n8. Disabilities centres\n9. Arts associations\nIsolates are joined in group 0, as they do not belong to any clique overlap structure. Figure 3 shows the\nprevious actor by actor co-membership matrix, where nodes have been shaped according to the 9 non-\noverlapping groups (plus group 0) and the size of ties represents the number of cliques two nodes have in\ncommon. If we now visualize the original knowledge network and colour the services according to the clique\ngroups they belong to (Figure 4), we have an overview of the whole network and the clique structure\nembedded in it. We can thus search for services that activate simmelian ties (meaning they are well connected\nwithin their own group) but at the same time are in a good position to mediate or control the circulation of\ninformation between other groups and, more importantly, between services that do not belong to any cohesive\nsubstructure.\nFigure 3: Visualization of cliques co-membership matrix with group belonging\nSize of ties = no. of cliques in common\nFigure 3: visualization of the whole knowledge network coloured by clique groups\nAs the density and clique analyses have shown, services tend to know other services if they are similar or they\noffer similar activities. For our purposes, this situation is not useful when dealing with problematic youth, as\nthey should be able to activate links with services that offer different activities and different support.\nMoreover, cliques involve only 33 out of a 100 nodes, meaning that the 67 isolates do not belong to any\ncohesive substructure and do not activate many symmetric ties. This means that social services could surely\nimprove the circulation of information regarding local services, investing in services that can spread such\ninformation around the network. These services can be identified through the brokerage role analysis applied\non cohesive substructures, in a way in which well connected nodes can act as bridges between different\ncliques and these cliques and isolates. On the other hand, the analysis of these roles, given the features of\nevery service, can help to clarifying whenever a service could possibly have an interest into increasing the\nflow of reciprocal knowledge between services (like in the case of the committee, whose aim is to know\ndifferent service where to address problematic youth) or could actually prefer to keep information for itself,\nlike in the case of market oriented services (like gyms) that can use their knowledge of the local offer as an\nadvantage against competitors.\nThe Gould and Fernandezs brokerage routine gives two main outputs: the first one summarises brokerage\nroles scores of every actor, providing the total number of times they play a specific role as well as the sum of\nall the roles (see Table 5). The second output provides detailed scores about which groups every actor plays a\nspecific role between. Table 6 reports an example of this second output, calculated for the Sporting Club\nNuova Canottieri Olona, which belongs to group 1.\nTable 6: Detailed scores of brokerage roles for Nuova Canottieri Olona (group 1)\nCoordination role: value in cell row2; col2 (group 1 diagonal).\nRepresentative role: values in row2. (Eg: Nuova Canottieri Olona plays 22 times a representative role between\nits own group 1 and group 0).\nGatekeeping role: values in col2 (Eg: Nuova Canottieri Olona plays 47 times a gatekeeping role between its\nown group 1 and group 0).\nConsultant role: all diagonal values apart from row2; col2.\nLiaison role: values in all other cells apart from the ones of previous roles.\nEvery role has its own meaning. Being the coordinator means that the service in a group is known by others\nand knows others itself: such a role within the isolates group is useful to increase (or not) the reciprocal\nawareness of the group, as services in this position could let (or stop) information circulating in the network.\nRepresentative services instead receive (and send4) ties within their own group but only send ties outside the\ngroup, thus they are good resources to let (or to stop) the actors of the group to be known by others.\nGatekeepers only receive ties from outgroups, meaning they can favor (or control) circulation of information\nwithin their own group. Consultant services receive and send ties to actors in the same group that is different\nto the one they are embedded into: they can thus increase or not the cohesion of other groups. Being a liaison\ninvolves sending and receiving ties between two different groups that are both different from the one the actor\nis embedded itself: again, this could mean increase or not of the cohesiveness of the whole network.\nDiscussion\nI can now analyse the roles of every actor within the network. The first thing we notice is the low values on\ncoordination roles for every group: this is expected, as nodes are well embedded within their groups, which\nrepresent overlapping cliques. Some of the low values (for examples in group 4, for Comunit\u00e0 Nuova nd\nPaspart\u00f9) are explained by the fact that cliques have a minimum size of 4 nodes, and groups were selected\ntaking services which shares at least one clique in common. This means that not everyone in the group has to\nshare all the cliques with the other three in its clique, and between different cliques there could be the space\nfor a coordination role.\nWithin every group is it possible to identify a leader, who has the highest values for most of the roles: for\ngroup 0 (people who do not share any clique in common and are visualised as isolates) the leader is Don\nOrione, a catholic church which offers services for youth, the elderly, and handicapped women. Don Orione\nhas the highest values on coordination within its own group. Due to the fact that the goal of the church is to\nincrease social support within the local community, we can interpret its coordinative role in terms of\nmediation between the group, as it can spread awareness of the local service to other services that seem to be\nfairly isolated in the area. The representative role is lead by Institute Cavalieri, a public school that at level\n0.571 of hierarchical clustering joins group 5 (school and education services). The Institute is then a good\nresource of connection between fairly isolated social services and the local educational system. Again, the role\nof the school can be understood in terms of mediation, as it is not in competition with other schools in the area\n(that have a different educational offer). Thus we can suppose that the institute could easily pass information\nto others in its group regarding educational services in the area. The gatekeeping role is covered mostly by\nSporting Club S. Ambrogio, which is dedicated to sport courses including gym, volley, judo, basketball. This\nclub joins group 1 (sporting clubs) at level 0.171: here this role can be intended as a source of advantage in the\ncompetitive field of local private sporting clubs, because the gatekeeper role allows the club to control\ninformation flow between group 0 and group 1 and to strategically limit contacts between other competitors\nsporting clubs and the isolated services. The sporting club S. Ambrogio covers the same gatekeeping role with\ngroup 8 (disabilities centres). This last group will tend to contact the sporting club when it needs to address\nhandicapped youth to sport activities. The same sporting club shows higher values on liaison, confirming its\nstrategic position within the network, while within group 0 there are no significant values for the consultant\nrole. Note that Don Orione, Institute Cavalieri and Sporting Club S. Ambrogio, regardless of the significance\nof their position in terms of collaboration VS competition, play very important roles in front of group 0, as\nthey allow and/or control information flows within the group and between other groups; the loosely connected\ngroup 0 (which is the most numerous groups, with 67 nodes) needs such brokers to improve its connectivity.\nGroup 1 (sporting clubs) is entirely dominated by Nuova Canottieri Olona (see Table 6), a multifunctional\nsporting centre offering courses in swimming, fitness, tennis. The centre shows high values of liaison between\ngroup 0 (isolates) and group 5 (educational system), group 0 and group 8 (disabilities centres) and group 2\n4 All the services embedded in cliques do have, by definition, symmetric ties within their own group. Thus when they play\nrepresentative or gatekeeper roles we have to keep in mind that these roles are counted because they mostly receive or mostly send ties\noutside of their groups, while inside of them they both send and receive ties. This is also the reason why apart from isolates (where\nservices are not embedded in cliques) these structures show very low values in terms of coordination, as in these structure actors are\nreciprocated and reciprocally connected to a third part (simmelian ties).\n(sporting clubs) and group 0. This means it is in a strategic position from which it can pass information\nbetween isolates, the public educational system and the sector dedicated to handicapped youth. Also, as we\ncan see from Figure 3, group 1 shares a variable number of cliques only with group 2, as well composed by\nsporting clubs. In this case we can suppose that the liaison role between group 2 and group 0 facilitates control\nof information, as the group 2 sporting clubs are located very close to Nuova Canottieri Olona (especially\nCanottieri Olona, which is in the same street and has a very similar name, thus the two could also be\nconfused). Here the liaison position allows Nuova Canottieri Olona to gain a strategic advantage over the\nother sport services.\nGroup 2 comprises the swimming pool Solari, which has the highest values on consultancy (between group 0)\nand liaison (especially between group 0 and group 1 and group 0 and group 8) and Canottieri Olona, another\nsporting club specialised in tennis and rowing which shows high values on gatekeeping with group 0. This\ngroup shares an average of 0.829 cliques with group 1. Here all the roles can be interpreted as controlling the\ninformation flow, especially regarding group 0. The special relationship between group 8 (disability centres)\nand all sporting clubs is easily understood as disability centres always offer a sport program to their users, and\nchose the sporting centre according to availability and closeness.\nThe group 3 leader is La Cordata, a solidarity social cooperative born in 1989 from a group of practitioners of\nAgesci (a catholic association of boy scouts) dedicated to marginalised youth. It offers many kinds of\nactivities and structures, from youth and student hostels to family support. It has a consultancy role for group\n0 (isolates) and group 5 (educational services), it represents its own group in front of groups 0, 1 and 2\n(sporting clubs), 4 (youth clubs) and 5. It is a gatekeeper between groups 0, 4, 5, 6 (drug addiction centre) and\n9 (art associations). Therefore it occupies a very strategic position, but due to the non-profit nature of the\nservice we can possibly interpret its role in terms of increasing collaborations rather than competition.\nGroup 4 (youth clubs) is dominated by Comunit\u00e0 Nuova, a non-profit association dedicated to drug addicted,\nmarginalised youth and immigrants. It has high values on consultancy for group 0 and on liaison between\ngroup 0 and other groups, therefore it can potentially increase cohesiveness of the isolates. It is also the\ncoordinator and the representative of its own group in front of all the other groups except groups 2 and 6. An\nadvantage of the method presented in this paper is that it is possible to verify if there are other services that\ncan act as representative for groups that are not connected to the leader. This is the case with Paspart\u00f9, ad\neducational centre that shows higher values for group 6 and CD Giambellino, a multifunctional youth club\nthat has higher values in front of group 2. Therefore these are the centres group 4 needs to turn to in order to\ngain information on the public service of drug prevention and sporting clubs.\nGroup 5 is composed by educational institute and the social cooperative A775, dedicated to prevention of\naddiction. Here brokerage roles are better distributed, as the gatekeeping is covered by A77, representative\nand consultancy by Institute Giorgi and liaison by the high school Marconi, which also shows higher value on\ntotal brokerage score.\nIn group 6 gatekeeping and consultant roles are taken by Ser.T, the public drug addiction service, while Cedag\nIrda, a youth club that offers education and family support shows higher values on representative and liaison\nroles. The high indegree value of Ser.T can be explained by the fact that all the other local services address\nyouth with addiction problem to the public health services, which receives more ties than it sends out.\nWithin group 7 we find youth club S. Paolino, dedicated to recreational activities and specialised in a\nrepresentative role between its group and group 0 and liaison roles between group 0 and group 1 (sporting\nclubs), group 0 and group 8 (disability centres), and group 4 (youth clubs) and group 0. We also find the\npublic library S. Ambrogio, with higher values on gatekeeping and consultancy for group 0. As we can see,\nthere are many services that can improve the information flow within group 0 and between this group and the\nothers, thus increasing the connectivity of the whole network.\nGroup 8 is composed of centres for handicapped people and Il Balzo, a non profit association that offers\ncourses of art and dance especially for handicapped people. The double vocation of Balzo (art and voluntary\n5 A77 is also the research commitment.\nwork for handicapped people) is expressed by its brokerage role between its group and group 9 composed of\ncultural, theatre and art association and dominated by Comuna Baires. This is an Argentinean association that\npromotes artistic activities like tango dance, painting and theatre.\nFocusing the attention on social services that are able to activate ties outside their own cohesive subgroups\nallow us to discuss two different but correlated aspects of social capital. In the quasi-market of Italian welfare\nthe public, private and non profit services compete against each other for economic funding to invest in\nprojects and increase newcomers. In this perspective a brokerage role can be an advantage in terms of\ncontrolling information flows from different local resources. Being a gatekeeper, like in the case of Nuova\nCanottieri Olona, a private sporting club, can be strategically relevant for an increment of clients, because\nwhen other services need to address their users to a sporting club they will turn to the one they know better.\nHere social capital is intended as a strategic resource whose outcome is a private good in terms of higher\nprofit. Whereas the goal of other public, private, non profit and religious services is not only to increase the\nprofit through public funding, but also to offer a network of differentiated resources to problematic youth.\nThey still have to compete against similar services for economic financing, but they also have to activate a\ncollaborative network to address youth with multiple needs. In this case a general view of the local network of\nsocial and cultural services is essential to transform the awareness of the local offer into possible\ncollaborations, that can be a valid source of social capital, where here social capital is intended as the product\nof collaborative relationships whose effect covers the entire community as the final beneficiaries are youths.\nIn this perspective a brokerage role does not entail only personal and private advantages, as Burt says, but also\ncollective benefits, as it produces social capital in terms of public good.\nConclusions\nIn this paper I analysed the brokerage role of social services that are able to activate different resources from\ncohesive subgroups. I combined two well known techniques, clique analysis and brokerage roles, on an\noriginal dataset in order to highlight who, within the network of social services in a local area of Milan, can\ncount on strategic positions and can activate different resources from the ones embedded within cohesive\nsubgroups. From a theoretical perspective, we saw how these resources can be used to develop collaborations,\nwhose effects in terms of social capital are considered public as they spread on the whole community. On the\nother hand they can be used for private advantage in competitions for new customers and funding, where the\nsocial capital perspective is the one of Burts, whose effects are interpreted as private and strategic goods.\nFrom a methodological perspective, the strength of the method lies in the fact that brokerage roles are counted\nbetween groups which are formed according on relationships instead of attributes, thus the technique is based\nonly on structural and relational properties instead of individual properties or attributes.\nWhile the method seems to show some potential, something has to be said on the whole study: the way in\nwhich I collected data does not allow to explore the quality of the ties mapped. Knowing another service, as\nwell as developing collaborations with it, does not mean that the relationship is positive and can lead to a\nstable tie: there could be the case in which two services know each other and already collaborate, but they\nmight not be satisfied by the reciprocal work. My data do not permit to predict if the ties I found will produce\nfurther contacts, thus we will need longitudinal panels which reveal whose connections within the network are\nstrong in terms of indicating reciprocal respect and continuous collaborations. This is not a secondary matter,\nas dealing with problematic youth needs long lasting interventions and commitment by the services network.\nAlso, I did not provide a grading scale of the kind of knowledge, thus the ties do not describe only one\nspecific kind of relation, as they can be intended as superficial knowledge as well as reciprocal deep\nawareness.\nMoreover, I do not know if brokers are aware of their position and use their strategic resources intentionally:\nwhat needs to be done is to qualitatively explore the self perception of services occupying different positions\nin the network, to give an account to the perceived positions and the advantage or constrains they implies.\nFurther research in these directions could reveal the strength of this method and show how being embedded in\ncohesive subgroups and acting as brokers could have different meaning for actors involved.\nReferences\nBarbieri, P.
