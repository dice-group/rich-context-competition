Deficits in cancer screening, cardiovascular risk re-\nduction, and diabetes care were most pronounced among long-term\u00aduninsured adults.\nConclusions In our study, long-term\u00aduninsured adults reported much greater un-\nmet health needs than insured adults.

Adults whose self-reported\nhealthstatuswasgood,fair,orpoorwere\n2 to 3 times more likely to have been un-\ninsured for 1 year or longer than those\nwho reported excellent or very good\nhealth. Smokers, obese individuals, and\nbinge drinkers were more often unin-\nsured than adults without these risk fac-\ntors. In contrast, people with self-\nreportedhypertension,diabetesmellitus,\nand elevated cholesterol were less likely\nto be uninsured than adults without\nthese conditions.\nAccess to Physicians\nTABLE 2 presents the unadjusted pro-\nportion of adults in each insurance cat-\negory who could not see a physician\nwhen needed in the past year due to\ncost, stratified by demographic fac-\ntors.
