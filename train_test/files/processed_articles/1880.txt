Lead and\ncadmium are risk factors for PAD that affect thiol metabolism, and they may partly explain the association of\nhomocysteine with PAD. To evaluate the roles of lead and cadmium exposure in confounding the association\nbetween homocysteine and PAD, the authors performed a cross-sectional study among 4,447 persons aged 40\nyears who participated in the 1999\u00ad2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). PAD was\ndefined as an ankle-brachial blood pressure index less than 0.90 in at least one leg. After adjustment for socio-\ndemographic variables, the odds ratio for PAD in the highest quintile of homocysteine compared with the lowest\n\u00bc 0.004). Adjusting for blood lead and cadmium levels reduced this odds ratio to 1.37 (ptrend\n\u00bc\n0.13), and further adjusting for estimated glomerular filtration rate and smoking reduced it to 0.89 (ptrend\nAdjustment for other risk factors did not affect this association. In the general population, the association of\nhomocysteine level with PAD can be completely explained by confounding due to smoking, increased blood lead\nand cadmium levels, and impaired renal function.

As a consequence, the possibility of prevent-\ning PAD through homocysteine-lowering interventions has\nreceived substantial attention, based on the assumption that\nthe association between homocysteine and PAD is causal\nand not just a marker of the effect of other etiologic agents.\nRandomized trials, however, have shown no effect of homo-\ncysteine-lowering interventions on cardiovascular outcomes\n(5, 6). Although these trials did not assess PAD specifically,\nthey suggest the possibility that previously unidentified con-\nfounders may account for the association of homocysteine\nwith PAD.\nElevated lead and cadmium levels are risk factors for\nPAD (7) and other cardiovascular disease endpoints (8, 9).\nLead and cadmium are divalent cations with high affinity for\nthiol groups (10\u00ad13), an action that could affect homocys-\nteine metabolism.

In 1999, NHANES became a continuous\nsurvey, and the National Center for Health Statistics started\nto measure ankle-brachial index in men and women aged\ncent. In the present analysis, we used data from NHANES\nof ankle-brachial index (n \u00bc 5,965). We restricted our study\nto the 4,874 participants with valid measures of ankle-\nbrachial index, plasma homocysteine level, and blood lead\nand cadmium levels (81.7 percent of eligible participants).\nWe further excluded 23 subjects with an ankle-brachial\nindex value greater than 1.5 (often related to calcified,\nnoncompressible vessels in the legs (15)) and 404 partici-\npants (8.2 percent) with missing information on at least one\ncovariate of interest. This left 4,447 persons in the study\nsample.\nVariables\nPlasma homocysteine. Blood was drawn and processed\nin NHANES mobile examination centers according to stan-\ndard protocols (17, 18). Plasma samples were frozen in the\nfield, shipped on dry ice, and stored at \u00ff70\u00b0C. Total homo-\ncysteine concentration in plasma was measured using a fully\nautomated fluorescence polarization immunoassay (Abbott\nHomocysteine Assay; Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park,\nIllinois) at the NHANES Central Laboratory (Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia). Plasma\nlevels were calculated using a machine-stored calibration\nAxSYM analyzer starting in 2002; Abbott Laboratories). The\nfluorescence polarization immunoassay method is equiva-\nlent to high performance liquid chromatography (19). The\nanalytical laboratory followed extensive quality control pro-\ncedures (17, 18). Since standard reference materials are not\navailable for homocysteine assays, bench quality control\npools with low, medium, and high levels of homocysteine\nwere prepared at the NHANES Central Laboratory. The\npools were analyzed in duplicate during each run and used\nfor calibration and calibration verification procedures. The\ninterassay coefficients of variation ranged from 2.7 percent\nBlood lead and cadmium. Blood for lead and cadmium\nmeasurements was collected in ordinary tubes after confir-\nmation of no background contamination in all collection and\nstorage materials. Lead and cadmium levels in whole blood\nwere measured with a PerkinElmer model SIMAA 6000\nsimultaneous multielement atomic absorption spectrometer\n(PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences, Inc., Wellesley,\nMassachusetts) with Zeeman background correction (17,\nlg/liter for cadmium. There were 11 participants with levels\nbelow the detection limit for lead and 731 (16 percent) with\nlevels below the limit for cadmium. For these participants,\nwe imputed a level equal to the detection limit divided by\nthe square root of 2 (20). National Institute of Standards and\nTechnology whole-blood standard reference materials were\nused for external calibration. The interassay coefficients of\nvariation ranged from 3.1 percent to 4.0 percent for lead and\nfrom 4.1 percent to 7.3 percent for cadmium.\nPeripheral arterial disease. A specific protocol was used\n(17, 18). The measurements of blood pressure used for ankle-\nbrachial index were different from the measurements of\nblood pressure used to define hypertension. Supine systolic\nblood pressure was measured on the right arm (brachial\nartery) and on both ankles (posterior tibial arteries) using\na Doppler device (Parks Mini-Lab IV, model 3100; Parks\nMedical Electronics, Aloha, Oregon). If the participant had\na condition that would interfere with blood pressure reading\nin the right arm, the left arm was used. Systolic blood pres-\nsure was measured twice at each site for participants aged\n40\u00ad59 years and once at each site for participants aged\n60 years or more. Measurements for left and right ankle-\nbrachial index were obtained by dividing the mean ankle\nsystolic blood pressure on each side by the mean bra-\nchial systolic blood pressure. PAD was defined as an ankle-\nbrachial index less than 0.90 in at least one leg.\nOther variables. Information on age, sex, race/ethnicity,\neducation, smoking, and alcohol consumption was based\non self-report. Body mass index was calculated by divid-\ning weight in kilograms by height in meters squared. Hy-\npertension was defined as mean systolic blood pressure\na self-reported physician diagnosis, or self-reported medica-\ntion use. Hypercholesterolemia was defined as total choles-\nterol level 240 mg/dl (6.2 mmol/liter), a self-reported\nphysician diagnosis, or medication use. Diabetes was de-\nfined as fasting glucose level 126 mg/dl (7.0 mmol/liter),\na self-reported physician diagnosis, or self-reported medi-\ncation use.\nHigh-sensitivity C-reactive protein was measured using\na Dade Behring Nephelometer II analyzer (Dade Behring,\nInc., Deerfield, Illinois). Serum creatinine concentration was\nmeasured by means of the modified kinetic method of\nJaffe\n\u00b4 (21), using a Hitachi model 704 multichannel analyzer\n(Boehringer Mannheim Diagnostics, Indianapolis, Indiana).\nEstimated glomerular filtration rate was calculated from\nLead, Homocysteine, and Peripheral Arterial Disease 701\ncreatinine, age, sex, and race/ethnicity using the Modifica-\ntion of Diet in Renal Disease Study formula (21). Serum\nfolate and vitamin B12\nlevels were measured at the NHANES\nCentral Laboratory using the Bio-Rad Quantaphase II folate/\nradioassay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules,\nStatistical analysis\nWe performed all statistical analyses using the survey\nweights and the svy commands in Stata, version 8.0 (Stata\nCorporation, College Station, Texas) to account for the com-\nand to obtain appropriate standard errors for all estimates.\nData on homocysteine, lead, and cadmium levels were right-\nskewed and were log-transformed for statistical analyses.\nQuintile cutoffs were based on weighted distributions in the\nwhole study sample.\nFirst we investigated the association of homocysteine with\nlead and cadmium levels in a linear model with log homo-\ncysteine used as the dependent variable and quintiles of lead\nor cadmium used as independent variables. These models\nestimate the adjusted ratio of the geometric mean homo-\ncysteine value for a given quintile to the reference quintile.\nWe obtained p values for linear trend by including log-\ntransformed levels of homocysteine, lead, and cadmium as\ncontinuous variables in the regression models. Restricted\ncubic splines were also used to estimate nonlinear dose-\nresponse relations between levels of homocysteine and lev-\nels of lead and cadmium.\nSecond, we investigated the association between ho-\nmocysteine and the prevalence of PAD using logistic regres-\nsion. The primary objective of this analysis was to assess\nwhether this association could be explained by confounding\ndue to lead, cadmium, or other cardiovascular risk factors.\nWe used four levels of adjustment: Model 1 adjusted for\nsociodemographic variables; model 2 further adjusted for\nbody mass index, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, dia-\nbetes, C-reactive protein, and serum folate and vitamin B12\n.\nModel 3 additionally adjusted for lead and cadmium, and\nmodel 4 additionally adjusted for smoking and estimated\nglomerular filtration rate. The impact of adjusting for lead,\ncadmium, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and smoking\nwas also assessed by adding each variable and each com-\nbination of variables to model 2. We obtained p values for\nlinear trend by including log-transformed variables as con-\ntinuous variables in the regression models.\nRESULTS\nThe geometric mean levels of homocysteine, lead, and\nrespectively.

Compared\nwith never smokers, current smokers had higher levels of\nhomocysteine, lead, and cadmium (data not shown).\nTABLE 1.

The associations of lead\nand cadmium with homocysteine and PAD are remarkable,\nsince they occurred at low levels of both metals, well below\ncurrent regulatory standards. For instance, only 54 partici-\npants (1.2 percent) had blood lead levels above 10 lg/dl\n(23), and only two participants had levels above the Occu-\npational Safety and Health Administration standard (<40\nlg/dl) (24). Similarly, only four participants had cadmium\nlevels above the Occupational Safety and Health Adminis-\ntration standard (<5 lg/liter) (25).\nLead and cadmium are widespread environmental toxi-\ncants. Since the ban on leaded gasoline was instituted over\ntwo decades ago, lead exposure in the United States has de-\nclined substantially (26), but it still occurs in many occupa-\ntional and environmental settings. People can be exposed to\nlead through industrial and combustion sources, contact with\nlead dusts and soils, certain foods, smoking, and sometimes\ndrinking water (27). Exposure to cadmium in the general\npopulation results from exposure to cigarette smoke, inha-\nlation of ambient air near coal-fired power plants and mu-\nnicipal waste incinerators, and consumption of some foods\n(the highest levels are found in shellfish, liver, kidney meats,\nand crops grown in cadmium-rich soils) (28).\nThe association of lead and cadmium with homocysteine\nings of the Baltimore Memory Study (14). The association\nwas independent of well-known determinants of homocys-\nteine level, including folate and vitamin B12\n. Because our\nstudy was cross-sectional, it does not provide information\non the mechanisms involved in the association of homocys-\nteine with lead and cadmium, and we can only speculate as\nto the causes. Lead and cadmium induce changes in gluta-\nthione metabolism (12, 29), which may result in increased\ndemand for cysteine, the rate-limiting amino acid in the bio-\nsynthesis of glutathione. Lead also inhibits heme synthesis\n(12), which is essential to the activity of cystathionine-b-\nsynthase, the rate-limiting step in the conversion of ho-\nmocysteine to cysteine. In addition, lead and cadmium can\naffect absorption, carrier protein binding, and tissue distri-\nbution of iron and zinc--important metals needed for the\nmetabolism of homocysteine (30).\nLead and cadmium were associated with PAD in this\nstudy even after adjustment for homocysteine level. Many\ninvestigators have reported that small elevations in blood\nlead are associated with increased blood pressure, particu-\nlarly at low lead levels (31\u00ad33), and elevated blood lead has\nalso been associated with cardiovascular endpoints in pro-\nspective studies (8, 9). Cadmium, although less well studied,\nhas been associated with myocardial infarction (34, 35).\nBoth metals increase oxidative stress (11), deplete glutathi-\none and protein-bound thiol groups (11), and induce the\nTABLE 2.

Other results shown in the table are percentages or arithmetic\nmeans with standard errors.\nproduction of inflammatory cytokines (36) and endothelial\ndysfunction (37), but the precise mechanisms responsible\nfor their cardiovascular effects at the low doses observed\nin this study are unknown. Mechanistic studies at low levels\nof exposure and prospective studies in humans using appro-\npriate biomarkers of chronic exposure are needed to further\ncharacterize the role of metals in atherosclerosis.\nA key causal issue is whether the association of lead or\ncadmium with PAD is itself a reflection of confounding by\nimpaired renal function. The evidence indicates that in-\ncreased levels of lead and cadmium are the cause, rather than\nthe consequence, of declining renal function (38, 39). In\nseveral studies, patients with chronic kidney disease or\nend-stage renal disease of known etiology did not have in-\nbone cadmium (42). In contrast, increased body lead bur-\nden has been associated with impaired renal function and\nnephropathy in subjects with occupational lead exposure\nand essential hypertension (40, 41) and in middle-aged and\nelderly men without previously known heavy lead exposure\n(49). In one study, high-normal levels of chelatable lead\npredicted renal function decline in patients with chronic\nrenal insufficiency (50). Furthermore, chelation therapy\nimproved renal function in these patients and slowed the\nprogression of renal insufficiency (50). Thus, impaired renal\nfunction is likely to be an intermediate variable, rather\nthan a confounder, for the association of lead or cadmium\nwith PAD.\nSmoking and impaired renal function are established\ncauses of PAD and of increased homocysteine levels (51\u00ad\n53). Although adjusting for estimated glomerular filtration\nrate and smoking substantially reduced the association be-\ntween homocysteine and PAD, additional adjustment for\nlead and cadmium further reduced this association. The im-\nportance of each of these confounders may differ across\npopulations as a function of their prevalence. While previ-\nous studies of homocysteine and PAD have adjusted for\nsmoking, few have adjusted for markers of renal function,\nand none (to our knowledge) have adjusted for lead or cad-\nmium levels.\nThe hypothesis that homocysteine is a cardiovascular\ndisease risk factor originated from the clinical observa-\ntion that patients with genetic defects leading to very high\nTABLE 3.

Our study does not contradict the\npossibility that high homocysteine concentrations contribute\nto atherosclerosis, but in our general population sample,\nhomocysteine levels were low (the 90th percentile of homo-\ncysteine in the NHANES sample was 12.4 lmol/liter). In\nthis context, our findings indicate that the homocysteine ele-\nvations observed among PAD cases were more likely to be\na consequence of their association with lead and cadmium\nexposure, impaired renal function, and smoking rather than\na cause of PAD. Thus, adjustment for these variables is\nneeded in order to avoid confounding of the association be-\ntween homocysteine level and PAD.\nPerhaps the most significant limitation of our study is the\ncross-sectional nature of NHANES data. However, most\nstudies of homocysteine and PAD are either cross-sectional\nor case-control in nature and share common design lim-\nitations with our study. Furthermore, cross-sectional and\nretrospective designs, if anything, tend to overestimate the\nassociation of homocysteine with cardiovascular endpoints\n(54). It is thus unlikely that the lack of association of homo-\ncysteine with PAD after multivariate adjustment is due to\nbiases in cross-sectional study designs.\nInterpretation of our findings is limited by a lack of un-\nderstanding of the mechanism underlying the association of\nlead or cadmium with homocysteine. While lead and cad-\nmium may affect homocysteine levels, it is also possible that\nhomocysteine affects blood lead or cadmium levels. Homo-\ncysteine has a thiol group and is similar in structure to pen-\nicillamine and dimercaptosuccinic acid (55), two chelating\nagents used to enhance urinary excretion of lead. Homo-\ncysteine could shift the equilibrium of heavy metals across\ndifferent compartments by such binding, and this could re-\nsult in an association between serum homocysteine and\nblood lead. In fact, high metal concentrations in blood, hair,\nand urine have been observed in homocystinuric patients\n(56), although the relevance of this finding to the much\nlower homocysteine levels observed in the general popula-\ntion is unknown.\nThe strengths of our study include the rigorous sampling\ndesign and quality control of NHANES, the representative\nnature of the study sample, the large sample size, and the use\nof standardized measures of ankle-brachial index.\nIn conclusion, our findings indicate that previous studies\nmay have overestimated the association between homocys-\nteine and PAD because of confounding by lead and cad-\nmium exposure. Even more important, our results agree\nwith an increasing body of evidence indicating that expo-\nsure to even low concentrations of these metals may have\nimportant cardiovascular effects. Because of the widespread\nexposure to lead and cadmium at the levels that were as-\nsociated with PAD in our study, identifying the precise\nmechanisms of effect and determining their role in other\ncardiovascular outcomes should be a research priority.\n"
