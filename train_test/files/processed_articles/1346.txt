Circulation. 1998;97:\nResponse\nIn our article,1 we suggested that the increase in the prevalence\nof obesity in the United States that occurred during the 1990s\nprobably affected the trend in total cholesterol concentration. Dr\nFolsom explores the issue in further detail and concludes that the\nobesity epidemic may indeed have played an important role.\nWe examined this issue in a different way by comparing the\nchange in mean age-adjusted total cholesterol concentrations\nwith that of age- and body mass index\u00adadjusted concentrations.\nthe age or age and body mass index distribution from the Third\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey to make these\nadjustments. Among all participants, the decrease in the age-\nadjusted mean total cholesterol concentration was 0.04 mmol/L\n(P0.249) and that in the age- and body mass index\u00adadjusted\neffect was greatest among white women and was present to a\nlesser degree among white men. Adjusting for age and body mass\nindex had almost no effect on the change in total cholesterol\nconcentration among African Americans, but this adjustment\nresulted in smaller changes than that produced by age adjustment\nalone among Mexican Americans.\nWe should note that the likely effect of obesity is probably\ngreater than we estimated because sample size considerations led\nus to use relatively broad categories of age and body mass index\nto adjust. Finer adjustment for body mass index would likely\nhave accentuated the difference between the change in the mean\nage-adjusted and age- and body mass index\u00adadjusted total\ncholesterol concentrations.\nTwo different approaches reach the same conclusion, as\nfollows: the obesity epidemic likely reduced the change in total\ncholesterol concentration that might have occurred in the absence\nof this epidemic. Although the disappointingly small change in\nmean total cholesterol concentration could affect the future\nincidence and mortality of coronary heart disease in the United\nStates, trends in smoking, hypertension, physical activity, and\nother risk factors for coronary heart disease need to be consid-\nered as well.\nEarl S.
