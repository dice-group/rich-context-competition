A\npromising criminological approach for examining terrorism is the situational crime-prevention\nperspective.The examination of terrorists' behavior from this point of view allows criminologists\nto offer policymakers relevant and timely empirical observations that could identify crimes and\nother routine activities upon which law-enforcement efforts could be focused. The ultimate\nobjective of such policies is preventing potential terrorists from carrying out attacks. Additionally,\nalthough scholars have pointed out several criminal activities in which terrorists are known to\nparticipate, there have been few quantitative analyses detailing similarities and differences that\nmay exist between terrorists and other types of felons at an individual level. In short, there is a\ndemand for research that informs theory and substantive understanding of the types of crimes\ncommitted by terrorists and possible prevention mechanisms.\nOne of the recent policy debates regarding the terrorism-crime nexus is focused on firearms.\nFor example, news reports have recently raised alarm that terrorist suspects may obtain firearms\nlegally (Lichtblau, 2005) and have publicized government efforts to integrate firearm purchase\nregulations with antiterrorism efforts (Luo, 2007) through existing firearms background checks\n(Krouse, 2005). At least one bill being considered by Congress aims to ban firearm purchases\nby those who may be linked to terrorist activities.2 This is particularly important because little is\nknown about the characteristics of individual terrorists and how these characteristics may affect\naccess to firearms. For instance, some have speculated that terrorists may lack a pronounced\ncriminal history (e.g., Sageman, 2006) and that this would expose them to less law-enforcement\nscrutiny when entering the United States (Meissner, 2004). If true, then a lack of significant\ncriminal history upon entry to the United States would increase terrorists' access to firearms\nwhile in the United States.\nCriminological research methodologies, findings, and associated policy recommendations\ncan provide a practical template with which some terrorists' activities may be studied (Hamm\n1.Terrorism in this study is defined as participation in alleged criminal activities that warrant counterterror-\nism investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and lead to federal indictment. For introduc-\ntions to the vigorous debate regarding a functional definition of what types of behavior do and do not\n2.Senate Bill 1237--the Denying Firearms and Explosives to Dangerous Terrorists Act of 2007--is currently\nunder consideration and was drawn from a Department of Justice recommendation to provide the At-\ntorney General with the discretion to deny firearm transfers to those who may intend to use the firearms\nfor terrorist purposes as well as revoke federal firearm licenses. This includes a provision for the Attorney\nGeneral to keep secret the reasons for denial or revocation if she or he considers those reasons to be\nimportant to national security (U.S. Congress, 2007; U.S. Department of Justice, 2007).\n3. We do not imply that terrorists are essentially criminals, nor do we imply that they are not. This debate\nis beyond the scope of this article. We simply wish to note that criminological research, and the more\ngeneral literature on deviance, is useful to shed light on activities that are defined as terrorism.\nLegault \u00b7 Hendrickson\ninstance, the use of firearms by American \"street\" criminals has been well documented and\na similar examination of firearm involvement among terrorists may explain their patterns\nof use, common methods of obtaining firearms, motivations for use, preference for types of\nfirearms, and the instrumentality of firearms in causing harm. For instance, the finding that\nmany firearms used by criminals were originally stolen from legal gun owners has led to some\nlocal laws requiring secure storage of privately owned guns as well as requirements to report\nstolen guns to the police (c.f. Wintemute, 1999). Additionally, controlled market access and\nsupply-side restrictions, such as the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, are\ndesigned to reduce access by former felons and other restricted classes at the point of retail sale,\nthus intending to reduce criminal firearm violence at U.S. state and federal levels (Cook and\nA similar understanding of terrorist participation in firearm crime may yield similar, policy-\nrelevant recommendations.\nAside from public debate and the potential to improve fundamental scientific understanding\nof terrorism, there is at least one compelling reason for addressing the terrorism-firearm dynamic:\nMost research on terrorism has focused on terrorist groups or incidents, not on individuals who\nhave participated in terrorism; therefore, little research has examined terrorist weapon choice or\nany individual-level characteristic of terrorists. Answers to many substantive questions are often\nspeculative at best. For this reason, we compiled individual-level data on terrorists that can be\ndirectly compared with individuals who are not terrorists--namely, federal felons--offering a\nnew perspective and filling an important gap in this area of research.\nLiterature Review\nPolicy-relevant research on counterterrorism using advanced statistical methods is insufficient in\nthe social science literature. For example, in a recent Campbell Collaboration systematic review,\nLum, Kennedy, and Sherley (2006) examined 6,041 peer-reviewed publications and found\nonly 7 that used statistical tests sufficiently robust for effective evaluation of counterterrorism\npolicies. Furthermore, although a great deal is known about criminals who use firearms, little\nempirically based knowledge is available regarding terrorism and crime or terrorist use of firearms\nin the United States. To address some of these shortcomings, it is useful to discuss the studies\nthat have used quantitative methodologies to explore the intersection of crime and terrorism,\nas well as past research that has informed our understanding of firearm crime.\nTerrorism and Crime\nMost recently, Dugan, LaFree, and Piquero (2005) used data from the Federal Aviation Admin-\nistration and the RAND Corporation to examine 828 airline hijackings that occurred before\n1986.They found that an increase in the perceived costs of hijacking as a result of metal detectors\nand increased law enforcement at passenger checkpoints was effective in reducing nonterrorist\nhijacking but that terrorist hijackings were largely unaffected, which led to the conclusion that\nWeapon Choice and American Political Violence\nCriminology & Public Policy\nthe rational choice perspective might be in need of continued refinement and that the level of\nmotivation, goals, and perception of risk differs between terrorist and nonterrorist hijackers.\nThe work of Dugan and colleagues echoes previous research examining the effects of policy\ninterventions on terrorism such as airport security increases, international conventions, and\nnational counterterrorism policies addressing international terrorist activities, which was recently\nsummarized by Enders and Sandler (2006). Enders and Sandler used a number of economic\ntechniques, including intervention analyses (i.e., Box-Jenkins models) and game theoretical\nmodels, to examine terrorism from a traditional rational choice perspective.\nAlthough quantitative methods have not been applied to data about individuals who par-\nticipate in terrorist activities, qualitative criminological work addressing individual characteristics\nof terrorists is available. Working primarily from court transcripts supplemented with personal\ninterviews, Hamm (2005, 2007) outlined the process of terrorist group formation, commission\nof attacks, and group dissolution and the role of individuals in these processes using routine\nactivities and social learning perspectives. Hamm (2005) argued that the daily lives of terrorists,\nincluding their day-to-day interactions, create opportunities to commit attacks to occur and\nexpose terrorists to law enforcement. Likewise, crimes supporting terrorist group goals are made\npossible by terrorist organizations exploiting the everyday routine activities of their victims.\nThus, Hamm (2005) argued that patterns of firearm use by terrorists can be understood by\nusing the routine activities framework. Indeed, Hamm explained the ultra-right-wing Aryan\nRepublican Army's success in bank robberies largely by invoking Cohen's notion of \"capable\nguardians\" such as bank security measures or police surveillance, and also that the ability of\nthe ARA to engage in bank robbery was greatly facilitated by their use of all types of firearms\nHamm recounted the following behaviors leading up to a bank robbery:\nMuch like al-Qaeda in the East Africa Embassy attacks and late in the 9/11 plot,\nthe ARA devoted considerable attention to reconnaissance. Langan and Guthrie\nwould spend weeks casing banks, taking into account every moment in the taken-\nfor-granted order of daily life around their targets. They would fully occupy these\nurban spaces by entering the banks in disguise, walking the streets and sidewalks,\nentering area stores and eateries, and then driving escape routes over and over again.\nThese spaces were then videotaped and then studied for the small often unnoticed\npractices of routine security.... Langan called off more than a dozen robberies due\nto things such as changes in bank security, shifting police patrol patterns and the\nunexpected presence of construction crews near the banks (Hamm, 2007: 176).\nHamm also wrote that firearms were intrinsic to the actual act of bank robbery: \"At nine-thirty\nA.M. March 29, Stedeford pulled the LeSabre into the bank's parking lot. Pete carried aTaurus\n4.Routine activities comprise only part of Hamm's argument; he also observed that there is a pronounced\nsocial learning component to terrorist behavior.\nLegault \u00b7 Hendrickson\n9-millimeter pistol, Guthrie had an Astra .45-caliber handgun. Kevin packed his .45 caliber\nGlock and Scott toted an HK-91 assault rifle inside his guitar case. Langan, Guthrie, and Mc-\nCarthy got out, dressed as construction workers with bulletproof vests and camouflage masks....\nDrawing their guns they entered the bank shouting...\" (Hamm, 2002: 208).\nFelons and Firearms\nAn understanding of the character and nature of criminals who use firearms is usually derived\nfrom surveys of incarcerated felons who used firearms in the past or are serving a sentence for\nfirearm crimes as part of their most recent conviction; usually, but not always, these surveys\nfocus on state prisoners (Scalia, 2000; Wright and Rossi, 1994). An additional data source is\nself-report surveys from arrestees and delinquents (Bjerregaard and Lizotte, 1995; Decker, Pen-\nnell, and Caldwell, 1997; Lizotte and Sheppard, 2001). These studies reveal patterns of illegal\ngun use and details about where criminals obtain guns, criminals' preferences for certain types\nof firearms, reasons for carrying or using firearms, and in some cases, demographic details and\ncriminal history.\nCriminals tend to obtain firearms through illegal means. For instance, most state and federal\ninmates report that they either obtained their last gun through illegal sources (33% and 39.2%,\nrespectively) or \"borrowed\" it from a friend or family member (39.6% and 35.4%, respectively)\n(Scalia, 2000; Wolf Harlow, 2001). A minority of criminals purchase firearms: Approximately\n22% of federal inmates bought their firearms at retail outlets, pawnshops, flea markets, and gun\nshows, and approximately 14% of state inmates purchased their guns legally.\nThe types of firearms that tend to be reported by both state and federal inmates are similar.\nOf those who report carrying a gun during their most recent offense, 83% of state inmates and\n87% of federal inmates reported carrying a handgun (Wolf Harlow, 2001).This finding agrees\nwith similar studies and demonstrates that most criminals prefer small, easily concealed weapons\nfor criminal activities.5 It is important to note, however, that firearm possession charges are much\nmore common in federal courts than use charges, and more than 70% of the illegal firearm pos-\nFederal and state firearm offenders differ somewhat in their criminal histories and other\npersonal characteristics. For instance, approximately 22% of state firearms offenders in 1997\nhad no previous known criminal sentences compared with only 9.5% of federal prisoners (Wolf\nHarlow, 2001). State and federal firearm offenders also differ slightly by race. About 18% of\nboth black and white inmates in federal facilities used firearms (Wolf Harlow, 2001). In state\nprisons, however, where firearm crimes are more common, firearm criminals tend to be nonwhite\n5.Significantly fewer inmates reported carrying more lethal types of firearms, such as rifles (7% state and 9%\nfederal) and shotguns (13% state and 14% federal).\nWeapon Choice and American Political Violence\nCriminology & Public Policy\nAmong criminals who carry firearms, the most often self-reported reason for doing so is\nWolf Harlow, 2001;Wright and Rossi, 1994).When inmates who used a gun in the commission\nof a crime were asked for information on the extent of their firearm use, they often reported\nthat they brandished the weapon to \"scare someone\" or to \"get away\" (Wolf Harlow, 2001:\n11). These findings indicate that a complex set of relationships motivates firearm offending\nand that theoretical explanations for firearm use have important implications for enforcement\nTerrorists, Criminals, and Situational Crime Prevention\nThe routine activities perspective provides a framework with which to make sense of the situations\nin which crimes occur during activities involved in everyday life (Felson, 1994). In this case,\nterrorism is the crime of interest. Implicit in the routine activities perspective is the means to\ndevelop policies, strategies, and tactics that take advantage of these common habits of criminals\nto develop plans for situational crime prevention (Felson, 1994).\nClarke and Newman (2006) used this perspective to develop a situational terrorism pre-\nvention model that relies on weapon choice as one of the four pillars of terrorist opportunity.6\nThey identified expected attributes of weapons that terrorists would prefer: \"multipurpose,\nundetectable, removable, destructive, enjoyable, reliable, obtainable, uncomplicated, and safe\"\n(2006: 108). Guns possess each of these attributes. Also--although they may lack some of the\nshock value of explosives--their availability, lethality, relative safety, and ease of use seem to have\nhistorically made guns popular among terrorists.7 For instance, according to data available in\nthe Global Terrorism Database version 1.1, approximately 41% of terrorist incidents between\n1970 and 1997 in which weapon type could be determined were perpetrated with firearms\n(authors' calculation of GTD1.1 data; LaFree and Dugan, 2008).\nAccounts of terrorist activity suggest that terrorists differ from other types of criminals in\nseveral key respects. First, a core, perhaps defining, activity of terrorism is the commission of\nviolent purposive criminal acts of a political nature (Schmid and Jongman, 1988). In contrast,\ncriminal acts are widely recognized to be committed in a haphazard fashion generally lacking\nin foresight (Gottfredson and Hirschi, 1990). Second, patterns of terrorist offending seem\ndifferent from those of \"street\" criminals.Terrorists engage in acts of terrorism, such as kidnap-\nping, assassinations, mass attacks, and so on, as well as a variety of organizational maintenance\ncrimes, such as identity fraud, bank robbery, and racketeering (Hamm, 2007). In contrast,\nfelons tend to be less involved in rare crimes like assassination, kidnapping, and mass murder,\nand they tend to be less involved in group offending--at least during later stages of the life\n6.The four pillars of terrorist opportunity are targets, weapons, tools, and facilitating conditions (Clarke and\n7. Although bombs are certain to make U.S. headlines, mass shootings--such as those that have occurred in\nhigh schools and universities in the United States--have garnered immense public attention and reaction.\nLegault \u00b7 Hendrickson\ncourse (Piquero, Farrington, and Blumstein, 2007). Thus, one might hypothesize that terror-\nists have qualitatively different motivations as well as engage in different patterns of behavior\nthan other types of felons.\nThese differences seem to influence patterns of firearm offending. As distinct from terrorists,\ncriminals are likely to recognize firearms as a secondary tool that allows for easier commission\nof crime, escape to be possible, and victim compliance to be greater, which reduces the chance\nthat victims will be hurt (Wright and Rossi, 1994: 128). In such cases, criminals who want to\ncommit a crime with a firearm but are unable to obtain one often report that they would forgo\nthe gun and still perpetrate the original criminal act (Wright and Rossi, 1994).8\nIn contrast, terrorist crime seems more strongly linked to firearm involvement.The research\nin this area is primarily anecdotal, but it is voluminous, so we illustrate just a few examples.\nPost, Sprinzak, and Denny (2003) outlined the role of motivations and values in 35 interviews\nwith incarcerated Middle Eastern terrorists. They noted that psychological constructions of\nvalue and meaning were intimately associated with armed attacks that were often carried out\nusing commonly available Kalashnikovs and pistols. The results of their interviews generally\nindicated that terrorists were in favor of armed attacks on Israel and endorsed the use of firearms\nagainst their perceived oppressors. More importantly, strikes--with and without firearms--\nprovided a sense of empowerment, mastery, and fulfillment that was otherwise lacking in the\ndaily lives of Post and colleagues' research subjects. Regarding offense patterns, Hamm (2007)\nwrote that firearms played a prominent role in bank, armored car, and interpersonal robberies\ncommitted by white supremacist terrorists in the 1980s and 1990s and were an integral part\nof planning acts of violence against the federal government in several instances (Hamm, 2002,\n2005). Research on Irish political assassinations indicates that nearly 81% of political murders\nwere committed with a firearm as opposed to only 24% of nonpolitical murders (Lyons and\nHarbinson, 1986). In short, some anecdotal evidence suggests that terrorists may be more likely\nthan other types of criminals to be involved with firearm offending because of motivational\ndifferences and patterns of offending.\nThe Importance of Access to Firearm Markets\nFirearms are a prominent part of U.S. trade. Estimates indicate that between 190 and 290\nmillion firearms are privately owned in the United States, with four to six million being added\nevery year (Legault, 2008). Generally speaking, firearms are not easily homemade and must be\nobtained from manufacturers through primary or secondary markets (Cook et al., 1995).\nAccess to firearms is an important issue for theory and policy.Aside from the aforementioned\nmotivational and behavioral differences between terrorists and other felons, there is a possibility\n8. When asked what they would do if they could not obtain a handgun to commit a crime, 37% of state\ninmates reported that they would go unarmed, 24% stated that they would carry a knife or club, and 40%\nsaid that they would carry a long gun that had been sawed off to make it concealable (Wright and Rossi,\nWeapon Choice and American Political Violence\nCriminology & Public Policy\nthat firearms are more available to terrorists because they might have overall greater access to\nU.S. firearm markets. Firearms may be obtained in primary legal, secondary legal, and second-\nary illegal firearm markets (Cook et al., 1995). Primary markets are federally licensed firearm\ndealers that are usually retail points of sale. The noteworthy difference between primary and\nother markets is that primary markets require a firearms purchaser to produce identification, to\nrequire the seller to record the details of the sale for review by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,\nFirearms, and Explosives (BATFE), and to require a background check through the National\nInstant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) before the firearm can be transferred to\nthe purchaser (Gun Control Act of 1968, 2006). These markets require actions that result in\nthe purchaser being exposed to federal law-enforcement authorities at some point in the sale.\nSecondary firearm markets have no such requirements regardless of the type of transaction, and\nthey include both legal sales by private parties and sales or trade through illegal sources (Cook et\nal., 1995). Obtaining firearms through illegal sources may expose terrorists to law-enforcement\nscrutiny. If terrorists have less serious criminal histories than other felons, as some have speculated\n(Meissner, 2004; Sageman, 2006), then terrorists would have a greater opportunity to obtain\nfirearms legally through primary markets and have greater access to secondary markets.\nConceptual Model\nThe literature suggests that two paths might influence terrorists' use of firearms. First, the situ-\national crime-prevention perspective would predict that, ceteris paribus, a restriction on the\nability of terrorists to access primary and secondary markets would reduce firearm offending by\ndenying access to weapons. Second, previous literature indicates that terrorists are motivated to\nobtain firearms and to engage differentially in crimes that involve guns. Our conceptual model\nappears below. The model assumes several control variables that are discussed later.\nBecause so little is known regarding individual-level terrorist behavior, we must first test\nsome speculative assumptions on which these arguments lie and then test the more complex\nrelationships.Therefore, we hypothesized four relationships. First, we hypothesized that terror-\nists have a less extensive formal criminal history than nonterrorist felons. Second, we expected\nthat, because of motivational and behavioral differences, terrorists will participate in a variety\nof firearm crimes.Third, we hypothesized that participating in terrorism will have a particularly\nstrong effect on charges for use and possession. Finally, based on the situational crime-prevention\nperspective advocated by Felson (1994) and by Clarke and Newman (2006), we hypothesized\nthat criminal history mediates the relationship between terrorism and firearm crime through\ndifferential access to firearms markets.\nH\n: Terrorists will have a less extensive criminal history than other felons.\nH\n: Terrorists will participate more than other felons in all forms of firearm crime.\nH\n: Relative to other felons, terrorists will have a greater prevalence of firearm use and\npossession.\nH\n: Criminal history will mediate the relationship between terrorists and firearm\ncrime.\nLegault \u00b7 Hendrickson\nData\nThis analysis is a comparative examination of 1,259 male felons prosecuted in the federal court\nsystem between 1987 and 2002. These data are derived from two sources. The first source, the\nAmerican Terrorism Study (ATS), is a database detailing the characteristics of people charged\nas a result of terrorism investigations by the FBI (Smith and Damphousse, 2006, 2007). In\nthis study, terrorism is defined by inclusion in this data set and does not necessarily equate to\ninvolvement in an act of terrorism. The offender could have been charged with any number of\noffenses resulting from his involvement in terrorist activities--just as other felons could have\nbeen charged with any number of crimes resulting from similar actions that did not involve\nterrorist activities.Therefore, it is involvement in terrorist activities as determined by a resulting\ninvestigation by the FBI that defines terrorism in this study. The second data source used in\nthis study is the official records of male felons from the U.S. Sentencing Commission (USSC)\ndata. We discuss each data source in turn.\nAmerican Terrorism Study\nThe ATS is a study of the characteristics, behavior patterns, and tactics of U.S. terrorist groups\nusing abstracted courtroom records (although we use the individual-level offender files from\nthese data).The ATS was compiled by Smith and Damphousse (2002) in conjunction with the\nFBI's Terrorist Research and Analytic Center and the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary\nSubcommittee on Crime.The data are derived from publicly available indictments of individuals\nwho have been identified and investigated by the FBI for potential involvement in terrorism-\nrelated offending between 1978 and 2002. Initially in the form of court records, the relevant\nvariables were abstracted into a machine-readable format by Smith and Damphousse (2002) and\nwere made available to the research community.The ATS microdata include variables measuring\nindividual demographic status, membership in a terrorist group, the content and breadth of\nformal legal charges and case disposition, and the outcome and location of prosecution. A wide\nvariety of crimes is represented in the ATS including conspiracy, weapons offending, fraud, and\nothers. For the purposes of this analysis, individuals in the ATS are considered \"terrorists\" and\nare hereafter referred to using this term.\nTheoretical model\nTerrorist\n+\n+\n+\nAccesstoFirearm\nMarkets\nCriminalGun\nInvolvement\nWeapon Choice and American Political Violence\nCriminology & Public Policy\nU.S. Sentencing Commission\nThe USSC data are collected under the auspices of the USSC and are used to monitor com-\npliance with federal sentencing guidelines (USSC, 1987\u00ad2002). The USSC data contain\nofficial information on individuals processed in the federal court system under the 1984 U.S.\nSentencing Guidelines. These individual-level data measure offender characteristics such as\ndemographic status, crime of conviction, criminal history score, and amount of harm caused.\nThe USSC nonterrorist felons were selected randomly from a concatenated file created by the\ncontain offenders charged with a wide variety of federal crimes. Individuals from the USSC file\nare referred to in this analysis as \"felons\" or \"nonterrorist felons.\" The USSC file is included to\nprovide a group of individuals to compare against terrorists from the ATS data.\nAnalytic File\nBecause the analyses were intended to make a direct comparison between ATS terrorists and\nUSSC felons, only years where data were available in both data sets were included and the data\nwere limited to felons only: All 374 felony cases from the ATS individual-level file from 1987\nto 2002 were included in the data and a random selection of 1,125 felony cases was drawn\ncombined and variable coding was standardized across both data sets.\nTo obtain a focused comparison, we applied several restrictions to both the ATS and the\nUSSC data. Namely, we limited the data to male terrorists charged in the United States and\nconvicted of a felony during years common to both data sets. These limitations yielded a total\nand 923 comparable cases from the USSC.10 The analytic file was created using the Statistical\nPackage for the Social Sciences (SPSS Corporation, Chicago, IL).The final analysis file contained\n9.The n randomly selected from the USSC was determined by our desire for the USSC cases to outnumber\nthe ATS cases by about three to one to increase statistical power while not overwhelming the number of\nATS cases. Three times 374 is 1,122 and we rounded this to the nearest five to arrive at our final USSC n of\n10. Female cases were removed from the final data set during the initial stages of development when it was\ndetermined that the small number of females (relative to males) in both data sets introduced instabil-\nity into the statistical analysis and that no relationship existed between gender and any of the outcome\nvariables. This is common to studies of gun violence (Lizotte and Sheppard, 2001). The lack of female cases\nin the ATS is particularly acute with only 38 female indictees in the data.\nLegault \u00b7 Hendrickson\nTo establish baseline relationships among our variables and between the two groups (terrorists\nand felons), we first performed bivariate tests of independence and correlation coefficients.The\nnext method for describing differences in terrorists and felons involved estimating a series of\nlogistic regressions on the pooled data. Using this method allows a comprehensive depiction\nof the outcomes while other relevant variables are held constant. Logistic regression allows the\ninterpretation of resulting coefficients as odds statements and does not assume a linear functional\nform (Aldrich and Nelson, 1984). Furthermore, we can determine the odds of firearm crime\ninvolvement based on each independent variable using this method (Long, 1997). Another\nadvantage of logistic regression, aside from its desirable properties when estimating limited\ndependent variables, is the ease with which one may interpret the outcomes of the equations.12\nFinally, we can test for differences between the subsets of primary firearm crime (use and pos-\nsession) to determine whether observed differences in the coefficients of these equations occur\nby chance or whether they indicate a difference in behavior (Cohen, 1983).13\nWe conducted two additional analyses. First, logistic models were estimated with data\nweighted to correct for the oversampling of terrorists. Finally, to take additional steps to remove\nextra causal factors from the model disturbance, we estimated conditional fixed-effects logistic\nregression equations, fixing the courtroom effects of the 96 federal court districts.This portion\nof the analysis represents an effort to address any unobserved variation in courtroom culture and\nprosecutorial discretion. These analytic techniques and results are presented in Appendix A.\nThe Variables\nFirearm charges. Table 1 presents descriptive statistics for all variables.The primary dependent\nconcept measured in this analysis is illegal use and possession of firearms as measured by criminal\nfirearm charges. We used four dichotomous measures to capture the illegal use and possession\nof firearms: (1) charged with any firearm offense, (2) charged with any firearm crime as a primary\noffense, (3) charged with firearm use as a primary offense, and (4) firearm possession as a primary\noffense. We coded all four measures 1 for charged with the firearm offense in question and 0\nfor not charged. Approximately 18.5% of the entire sample was charged with a firearm offense,\nfollowed by 15.8% being charged with a primary firearm offense.14 Fewer than 2% (1.7) were\n11.SPSS Version 12.0 was used for bivariate analysis and STATA Version 9.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX) was\nused to estimate multivariate models.\n12. When the coefficients of a logistic regression are exponentiated and transformed through a simple\nformula, we may interpret the result as a percent change in odds of the dependent variable for a one-\nunit change on the independent variable while holding all other variables constant. The transformation\nformula used here is as follows: percent change in the odds ratio = (e \u00ad1)*100.\n13. In this case, the t test is distributed as where a z score of 1.65 is p < .05. The formula for calculating the\nz scores is as follows:\n(see also Paternoster, Brame, Mazerolle, and Piquero, 1998).\n14.These measures are similar to measures of federal prisoners'self-reports of gun use, which further supports\nour confidence in the validity of these data (Wolf Harlow, 2001).\nWeapon Choice and American Political Violence\nCriminology & Public Policy\naccused of firearm use and 7% were implicated in firearm possession.\nBecause the data were abstracted from the ATS and USSC statutory codes, these variables\nare crude indicators only and cannot distinguish between firearm types (e.g., whether pistols or\nlong guns) and are not sensitive to bullet caliber, manufacturer, or style of firearm. Nevertheless,\nwe assume that the use of official court records is a valid measure of criminal offending. Previous\nresearch on firearm use by offenders has shown a high degree of reliability between prosecuto-\nrial charging behavior and actual firearm-related offending (Lizotte and Zatz, 1986; Loftin and\nMcDowall, 1981). In other words, if an individual is charged with more serious crimes and a\nfirearm is involved, then firearm charges also are included. Furthermore, the strict definitions of\nfirearm-use crimes at the federal level require specific alleged actions on the part of the defendant\nand do not include the mere possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony (Scalia,\n2000), which lends yet more confidence to this particular measure. In both the ATS and the\nUSSC, firearm involvement was defined by official courtroom action and any measurement\nerror would be more likely caused by stochastic processes rather than by data definitional issues.\nIn other words, we assumed that being charged with a firearm crime indicates involvement with\nfirearms and that an absence of firearm charges indicates no firearm involvement.\nTerrorism status. The main independent variable in this analysis is whether the defendant\nwas a terrorist. This item was coded 1 or 0 depending on the data source from which the indi-\nvidual was drawn. Defendants from the ATS data were coded 1, and those from the USSC data\nwere coded 0. The ATS data contain individuals formally indicted in a court of law as part of\nthe FBI's counterterrorism program (Smith and Damphousse, 2006). The formal indictment\nprovides high confidence that individuals from that source were in fact involved in terrorist\nactivity. The USSC data are a record of individuals charged in the federal court system who\nwere not involved in terrorism.The combined data include 336 (26.7%) individuals identified\nby the FBI as terrorists and 923 (73.3%) nonterrorists from the USSC sentencing data.\nCriminal activity. The next three items represent individuals' degrees of criminal activity\nusing three variables. First, we included a measure of the defendants' federal criminal history\nscore. Ranging from 0 to 6 (with 6 being the most severe), the average federal criminal history\nscore is 2.3 in this sample.15 The second indicator of seriousness of criminality is the number of\nmonths sentenced to prison. Although the authors recognize that sentencing under the federal\nsystem remains highly structured by the federal guidelines (U.S. Sentencing Commission, 2006),\n15.The criteria for these scores are outlined in the USSC's Federal Sentencing Guidelines Manual (U.S.\nSentencing Commission, 2007). However, we could not dichotomize criminal history into previous felony\nindictment or no previous felony indictment. Determining whether the offender was previously convicted\nof a felony is not possible because of the complex coding of the criminal history score. The criminal his-\ntory score is calculated by using a multistage process that evaluates prior offenses by sentence length,\nwhether the offenders were adjudicated as adults or juveniles, release dates from custody, whether of-\nfenses were committed while under sentence for another criminal offense, time since last offense, escape\nstatus, and the nature of previous offenses. By evaluating each of these characteristics, the USSC sums the\ntotal points and then uses these points to assign a criminal history category score.\nLegault \u00b7 Hendrickson\nT a b le 1\nCoding of variables, means, and standard deviations for all variables\nVariable CodingofVariable Unweighted Weighted N\nMean SD Mean SD\nDependent\nAnyfirearmoffense Didanyofthedefendant'sconvictionsinvolvea\nFirearmprimaryoffense Didthedefendant'sprimaryoffenseofconviction\nFirearmuse Didthedefendant'sprimaryoffenseofconviction\nFirearmpossession Didthedefendant'sprimaryoffenseofconviction\nIndependent\nTerrorist Defendantidentifiedasaterroristandincluded\nCriminalhistory Defendant'sfederalcriminalhistorycategory;\nmeasuresthefrequencyandseriousnessof\nLeadershiprole Defendanthadaleadershiporotherwise\naggravatingroleintheprimaryoffenseof\nBlack DefendantisofAfrican-Americanrace/ethnicity\nLatino DefendantisofHispanicrace/ethnicity\nWhite DefendantisofCaucasianrace/ethnicity\nNumberofcounts Defendant'snumberofcounts\nNotes.SD=standarddeviation.ATS=AmericanTerrorismStudy.Weightedterrorvariablevalue=.0006672.\nWeapon Choice and American Political Violence\nCriminology & Public Policy\nthe number of months sentenced to prison is a potent indicator of the severity of defendants'\nmost recent crimes as well as their criminal history (Tonry, 1996). When used in conjunction\nwith other criminal history variables in multivariate models, this indicator more precisely\nmeasures the severity of the current offense. The average number of months sentenced was 67.\nOur third measure of criminal severity is whether the offender had a leading or aggravating\nrole in his primary offense of conviction. Research on terrorism (Sageman, 2004) suggested\nthat some individuals who play a central role in terrorist organizations may be more likely to\nengage in a greater amount of offending. Similarly, we expected that nonterrorist criminals\nwho were in leading or aggravating roles during primary offenses would commit more severe\ncrimes. Nearly 12% of offenders in the combined ATS-USSC data set were in a leadership or\notherwise aggravating role.\nControl variables. Our indicator of citizenship is an important control variable. Recent\nliterature noted that some terrorists are drawn from immigrant communities (Rapoport, 2001)\nand prior work on firearm offending suggests that firearm offending may be lower among im-\nmigrant offenders (Wolf Harlow, 2001). Thus, we included citizenship to improve the focus\non our comparisons and to account for mid-level sociodemographic contextual variables. Citi-\nzenship was measured using a dichotomous variable. Approximately 66% of the total sample\nwere U.S. citizens.\nTo control for possible confounding variables associated with demographic characteristics\nand to compare felons versus terrorists in their firearms involvement, we also included age and\nrace variables. Age was defined as the defendant's age at conviction and the average age of the\noffenders in the combined ATS-USSC data was 35.3 years. Ethnicity was captured using four\ndichotomous variables. Approximately 24.2% of all USSC-ATS felons were African American,\n27.6% were Latino, 46% were white, and only 2% were listed as \"other\".\nFinally, we included a measure of the number of charges levied against the defendant to\ncontrol for a possible higher level of aggressive prosecutions against terrorists. It is entirely prob-\nable that prosecutors view terrorism as a form of heinous crime and therefore simply \"throw the\nbook\" at terrorists. Accordingly, we included the total number of criminal counts to control for\nthe possible confounding effect of differential case handling. The average number of criminal\ncounts against defendants in this sample was approximately 3.7.\nResults\nBivariate\nThe results from Table 2 indicate that terrorists and felons are distinct in several important\nways. The bivariate results paint a picture of the U.S. terrorist as being more heavily firearm\ninvolved, older, usually white, and having a less extensive offending history than other felons.\nIn this regard, the percentage differentials are large: A total of 40% of terrorists were charged\nwith a gun-related crime, compared with 10.5% of felons. On average, terrorists were 37 years\nof age and federal felons were 34. Fully 76.5% of terrorists were white, while 35.3% of felons\nLegault \u00b7 Hendrickson\nwere white. Finally, terrorists had an average criminal history score nearly a point less than\nT a b le 2\nContingency tables comparing terrorists with felons\nFelons Terrorists\nNotes.NS=notsignificant.Resultsareunweighted.Independentsamplet-testsandchi-squaretestsofindependencecalculated,\nrespectively.\nResults from the correlation matrix in Table 3 are consistent with Table 2 and suggest\nsome important consistencies between the data sets. Our measure of terrorism was positively\ncorrelated with firearm crime (r = .344), age (r = .099), and being white (r = .363). Similar to\nthe contingency tables, the correlations show that terrorists are associated with lower criminal\nhistory scores (\u00ad.206). Both of these results, then, provide initial support for our first and second\nhypotheses--that terrorists have less of a criminal history and participate in more firearm crime\nthan other felons.They also suggest that prosecutorial behavior might have an important effect:\nTerrorists are charged with about eight times the number of offenses as other felons.\nOther results from the correlation tables are consistent with previous studies and suggest\nimportant race and citizenship dynamics. For example, Latinos were less likely to be involved\nwith firearms, as evidenced by their negative and significant correlations with all four measures\nof firearm violations.16 Similarly, we found that U.S. citizenship was related to a higher likeli-\nhood of all types of firearm charges.The data also indicate that African Americans had a longer\nformal criminal record (r = .170) and that being African American was associated with longer\n16.This finding is consistent with previous examinations of federal firearm offenders (Scalia, 2000; Wolf\nWeapon Choice and American Political Violence\nCriminology & Public Policy\nLegault \u00b7 Hendrickson\nT a b le 3\nVariables\nAny\nfirearm\ncrime\nPrimary\ncrime\nfirearm\nPrimary\ncrime\nfirearmuse\nPrimarycrime\nfirearm\npossession Terrorist\nCriminal\nhistory\nMonths\nsentenced\nLeadership\nrole Citizen Black Latino Other White Age\nNumber\nof\ncounts\nAnyfirearmcrime 1\nMultivariate\nTable 4 presents the results of the logistic regression equations estimating the effects of each\nof the independent variables on each of the four firearm crime variables. The findings from\nthis analysis provide additional support for three of the four hypotheses. In seven of the eight\nmodels, being a terrorist significantly increased the odds of being charged with firearm offenses.\nThe first column details the simple odds ratios for all cases with any firearm, without including\na measure of criminal history. In this equation, being in the terrorist group increased the odds\nof being indicted with any firearm offense by more than fourfold. Being Latino reduced the\nodds of being indicted with any firearm crime by 90%. Finally, being a U.S. citizen more than\ndoubled the odds of being indicted for a firearm crime.\nEstimates in the second, fourth, sixth, and eighth columns included a control for criminal\nhistory to test our fourth hypothesis. In each of these cases, the idea that criminal history medi-\nates the relationship between terrorist and firearm offenses was supported by the considerable\nincrease in parameter estimates for terrorists' participation in any firearm crime for all four\noutcome models. Controlling for the effect of the criminal history variable reveals the full extent\nof terrorist participation in firearm crime. For instance, when criminal history is included in\nthe model, there is an almost ninefold increase in the odds of terrorists being charged with any\nfirearm crime compared with nonterrorists. This is much higher than the fourfold difference\nobserved in the equation that did not include criminal history to mediate the relationship and\nillustrates the suppression effect of criminal history on terrorists' participation in firearm crime:\nThose few terrorists with extensive criminal histories, then, were charged with firearm crimes\nmore often than other felons, but the effect was more pronounced when controlling for varia-\ntion in criminal history.This finding stands in stark contrast to previous research on felons that\nidentified extensive criminal history as being a predictor of current gun involvement.\nThe fourth column reports the equation for firearm charges as a primary offense. In this case,\nterrorists had approximately six times higher odds of having a gun charge as a primary offense\nthan did other criminals. In addition, criminal history became a significant predictor, increas-\ning the odds of a primary firearm offense by approximately 57%, and the effect of citizenship\nintensified to approximately a tenfold increase in odds. Finally, the severity of crime (measured\nby the number of months sentenced) changed direction compared with the first model, reducing\nthe odds of being charged with a primary firearm offense by 0.6% per month sentenced.\nThe sixth column presents the results for gun use as a primary crime. This is the largest\ndisparity between terrorists and other criminals with a more-than-20-fold increase in the odds\nof being charged with firearm use for members of the terrorist group. We note here that the\nterrorist variable and age are the only variables in the equation that explain variation in the\nfirearm use variable and the strong finding could be an artifact because only approximately 1%\nof all the cases in the data involved firearm use as a primary offense.\nFinally, the last column details the equation for firearm possession as a primary offense.\nIn this case, being in the terrorist group increased the odds of being charged with firearm pos-\nWeapon Choice and American Political Violence\nCriminology & Public Policy\nT a b le 4\nVariable\nExpAny\nFirearm(SE)\nExpPrimary\nFirearm(SE)\nExpFirearm\nUsea (SE)\nExpFirearm\nPossession(SE)\nTerrorist\nCriminalhistory --\n--\n--\n--\nMonths\nsentenced\nLeadershiprole\nCitizen\n-- --\nBlack\nLatino\n-- --\nOther\n-- --\nAge\nNumberof\ncounts\n(sig.)\nNotes.SE=standarderror.\na Otherrace,Latino,andcitizennotincludedasconstant.\nsession as a primary offense about fourfold over the nonterrorist group. Next, we compared\nthe terrorist coefficients in the firearm use and possession equations as subsets of the primary\nfirearm variable. Although initial inspections supported the conclusion that firearm use was\nmore common than possession among terrorists as compared with criminals, we found that\nthis difference was not statistically significant when examined with a cross coefficient test and\nthat it does not support the third hypothesis that terrorists will show a large difference between\nfirearm use and possession compared with other felons.17 Criminal history also exhibited strong\n17.Calculating the cross coefficient test for these equations produces z = .0843 with p = .466, which fails to\nreject the null hypothesis that the coefficients are different in the population.\nLegault \u00b7 Hendrickson\neffects on firearm possession: Each increase in criminal history score produced a 60% increase\nin the odds of firearm possession. Months sentenced decreased the odds of firearm possession\nby approximately 6% for each additional month, and U.S. citizenship increased the odds of\nfirearm possession by more than eightfold.\nFinally,weestimatedtheseequationswiththeweighteddataandusedconditionalfixed-effects\nmodels of the data to control for the oversample of terrorists and for the effects of courtroom\nactors, respectively. The results of these additional models did not differ substantively from\nthe models already reported. Complete details about these methods and results are reported\nin Appendix A.\nSummary of Findings\nThree of the four hypotheses are supported by these results. Overall, and perhaps unsurpris-\ningly, firearm charges were positively related to criminal offending, with criminal history being\npositively and significantly related to primary firearm crime and being charged with possession\nof a firearm as a primary offense. Terrorists, the main variable of interest, displayed strong\npositive effects in each of the equations, a pattern that supports the hypothesis that terrorists\nparticipate in more firearm crime than other felons. Nonetheless, the odds of being charged\nwith firearm use (as opposed to possession) for terrorists were not significantly different than\nnonterrorist felons, a finding that fails to support the third hypothesis. The relatively small\nnumber of firearm-use cases and consequent lack of variation and power for this dependent\nvariable could be driving this result. Finally, the fourth hypothesis--a mediated relationship\nbetween terrorists and firearm crime because of criminal history differences--is supported by\nthe suppression effect noted in each of the models presented.\nDiscussion and Conclusion\nThese findings concur with previous research using the ATS suggesting that individual terror-\nists are frequently charged with firearm offenses (Hamm, 2007). They are also consistent with\nresearch that found that terrorists are more likely to use firearms for assassinations than are\nnonterrorists (Lyons and Harbinson, 1986) and with research from terrorist-incident databases\nindicating that firearm-based attacks are the second most common type of recorded occurrence\nAlthough this consistency with previous literature provides additional confidence in the\nfindings, there are limitations to the analyses. First, we lack information regarding the specific\ntype of firearm used, firearm preference, and circumstances conditioning weapon type use.\nPerhaps more importantly, direct measures of weapon use in terrorist attacks versus supporting\ncrimes are absent; unfortunately, these data do not yet exist. It will be important to collect new\ndata to address the specific details and motivations of terrorists at an individual level.\nSecond, both the ATS and the USSC data are drawn primarily from federal prosecutions\nand do not include cases tried in state courts. Although current indications suggest that the\nWeapon Choice and American Political Violence\nCriminology & Public Policy\nbulk of terrorism-related cases are tried in federal courts, some states may contribute to this\ntotal as well (cf. Simone, Freilich, and Chermak, 2008). Although we expect that this will not\nfundamentally undermine the findings of this study, it is important to understand that not\nall cases tried and punished in federal courts result from a violation of federal firearm statutes.\nFederally sponsored firearm violence-reduction strategies such as Operation Ceasefire and\nExile try defendants in federal courts who would traditionally have been tried in state criminal\ncourts. This limitation is not particularly threatening, however, because it serves only to make\na rejection of the null hypothesis more difficult.That is, if additional firearm felons were in the\nsample that were not in the terrorist group, then it would be more difficult to find that being\ninvolved in terrorist activities increases the odds of participating in firearm-related crime. In\nshort, this potential for systematic error in the data serves only to increase the difficulty in sup-\nporting our hypotheses. In any case, the unique nature of these data and the opportunity to\ncompare terrorists and other types of felons quantitatively at the individual level far outweighs\nthese shortcomings.\nFuture research should attempt to shed light on the dynamics of weapon choice among\nindividual terrorists. In particular, additional research examining the interplay between terror-\nism and type of firearm would be very informative. Prior research has suggested that felons\nare primarily interested in easily concealed handguns (Wolf Harlow, 2001; Wright and Rossi,\n1994), but terrorists may be more interested in offensive weapons such as shotguns and semi-\nautomatic rifles. Understanding weapon choice is vital to understanding the routine criminal\nactivities of terrorists in the United States. Previous work (Hamm, 2002, 2007) suggested that\nterrorists may differ from felons in their involvement with explosives, which are not the com-\nmon weapons of ordinary criminals.This suggests that researchers or policymakers interested in\nbetter understanding terrorism may want to study terrorist weapon choice and preference--just\nas others have studied criminal weapon choice and use in the past to inform criminal justice\npolicy (e.g., Cook et al., 1995; Lizotte, Krohn, Howell, Tobin, and Howard, 2000; Lizotte,\nTesoriero, Thornberry, and Krohn, 1994).\nTerrorist group type may be an important variable as well. Hoffman (2006) argued that\nleft-wing violence is distinguishable from right-wing violence by the left's use of innovative\ntactics and specific targets. Based on these findings, one would expect right-wing groups to\nbe more apt to possess and use firearms than left-wing groups. Accordingly, future research\non firearm involvement should explicitly examine differential patterns of firearm use between\ntypes of terrorist groups.\nFinally, these findings support at least one specific recommendation for policy. Because\nterrorists tend to have less extensive criminal histories, they might find it easier to obtain firearms\nlegally through available primary market retail sources and to pass Brady background checks--\nboth of which suggest that policymakers should continue to include the Violent Gang and\nTerrorist Organization File (VGOTF) as part of the Brady NICS criteria. More importantly,\nhowever, procedural changes regarding how that information is communicated to federal and\nLegault \u00b7 Hendrickson\nstate law-enforcement agencies should be improved in light of the proclivity of terrorists in this\nsample of federal felons to participate in firearm crimes, a lack of coordination on this subject\nbetween state and federal agencies, and a history of allowing these purchases to be completed\n(U.S. Government Accountability Office, 2005).\nCurrent federal restrictions on firearm purchases forbid the sale or transfer of firearms\nto people who are indicted or convicted of felonies, fugitives from justice, addicted to or use\ncontrolled substances, adjudicated as mentally defective, identified as illegal aliens, discharged\nfrom the armed forces under dishonorable conditions, recognized as previous citizens who\nhave renounced U.S. citizenship, subject to a court protective order restraining contact with an\nintimate partner, or convicted of a misdemeanor or domestic violence (The Gun Control Act of\n1968, 2006). Currently, no provisions are in place to prevent individuals named in theVGOTF\nfrom purchasing weapons unless they are otherwise ineligible (Krouse, 2005). Furthermore, the\nU.S. Government Accountability Office (2005: 21) reported that federal law-enforcement and\ncounterterrorism authorities have \"`not routinely monitored states' handling of NICS transac-\ntions involving terrorist records in the VGOTF.\" We recommend that this integration of the\nVGOTF with NICS checks be continued with additional FBI counterterrorism oversight and\ncoordination and that a provision to prevent firearm sales to individuals listed in the VGOTF\n(with proper oversight) be enacted. For instance, the Denying Firearms and Explosives to\nDangerous Terrorists Act of 2007 (S. 1237) currently proposes to deny people named on the\nVGTOF list the right to possess a firearm and allows for remedy through the discretion of the\nattorney general (U.S. Congress, 2007). This bill also allows the attorney general to withhold\ninformation regarding the denial of a firearm purchase if the information is considered to be a\nmatter of national security--although we are not sure how this might be germane to domes-\ntic terrorism and it would justifiably draw the ire of civil rights groups as well as gun rights\nactivists. The ability to deny the right to purchase a gun based on VGOTF membership may\nbe necessary considering that, during the 5 months of the U.S. Government Accountability\nOffice study, the NICS recorded approximately 650 hits on terrorist lists, of which only 44\nwere valid. Of the 44 valid alerts, 35 were ultimately allowed to proceed for lack of cause for\ndenial, 6 transactions were denied, 1 was not resolved, and 2 were listed as \"unknown status\"\n(U.S. Government Accountability Office, 2005). Considering the evidence presented here, it\nis probably more prudent to impose greater law-enforcement oversight and involvement rather\nthan to try to impose and enforce additional purchasing restrictions.\nReferences\nAldrich, John H. and Forrest D.

The data include 923 fel-\nons randomly sampled from a total of 511,466 cases processed under the federal system.18 In\ncontrast, all available terrorists from the same time period--336--were included in the data.\nTerrorism prosecutions are rare, which presents a degree of methodological difficulty in modeling\nterrorist behavior.19 To compare the two data sets, weights were calculated to compensate for\nthe discrepancy in the relative sizes of the groups.20 Both weighted and unweighted descriptive\nstatistics are reported in Table 1.\nFailure to include such weights can lead to biased parameter estimates (Wang, Yu, and\nLin, 1997). Inclusion of weights, however, can have unwanted effects on inferential statistics\nby inflating standard errors, which increases the likelihood of error. As a result, Winship and\nRadbill (1994) recommended not including oversample weights when the parameter estimates\nbetween weighted and unweighted models are the same.Therefore, all statistical tests and analyses\nwere performed on both the weighted and unweighted data. No substantive differences were\nfound in the interpretation of findings or in the standard errors.This being the case, we elected\nto present and interpret the unweighted results (Winship and Radbill, 1994) and we do not\nreport weighted equations here.21 To allow for the possibility that the standard errors might\nbe inflated, all models are estimated using Huber-White robust standard errors. In sum, we\nchose to include the more conservative, smaller parameter estimates and the more conservative\nrobust standard errors.\nThe Conditional Fixed-Effects Logistic Model\nThe data used for this analysis are official courtroom statistics. Accordingly, individual outcomes\nin these contexts are influenced by a host of factors inherent in the local courtroom context.These\nfactors are the local informal legal cultures; social dynamics among judges, defense attorneys,\n18. Although the original population of the USSC is 631,869, this is the number of males in the USSC popula-\ntion and is the population N used to calculate the weighting scheme for the final data set used in the\nanalysis.\n19.The authors note that, in 2002, there were approximately 370 U.S. federal homicide convictions (Maguire\nand Pastore, 2004) but only 38 prosecutions of terrorists (authors'calculations--not shown). These data\nsuggest a ratio of 1 terrorist prosecuted to every 9.73 homicides. In short, terrorism cases in the federal\nsystem are far rarer than even the infrequent crime of homicide.\n20.Simple probability weights were calculated and used as oversample weights. The weight calculations\nwere performed by determining the sampling proportion of the terrorist group, using this number to\ndetermine the expected number of terrorist cases in a simple random sample, dividing the expected pro-\nportion by the actual n, subtracting this number from the actual sample size, and dividing the expected\nsize by the actual sample size.\n21. All parameter estimates were in the same direction; however, the weighted results were of a greater mag-\nnitude. We chose to report the more conservative estimates here. Although not reported, the weighted\nresults are available upon request.\nWeapon Choice and American Political Violence\nCriminology & Public Policy\nand prosecutors; and attitudes of courtroom actors toward the perceived harm of criminal acts\n(Eisenstein, Flemming, and Nardulli, 1999).\nTo account for these potential courtroom-level effects, we estimated conditional fixed-\neffects logistic regression models, which allow for the user to hold constant unobserved, stable\nvariation (Greene, 2003; Wooldridge, 2002) in groups, such as geographic areas, in this case\n96 federal court districts.The unconditional logistic fixed-effects model has often been cited as\nan appropriate model for the study of logistically distributed dependent variables across time in\npanel data (Greene, 2003; Wooldridge, 2002). However, these models usually rely on a series of\ndichotomous variables representing each of the concepts under investigation, thus introducing\nthe possibility of incidental parameter bias (Allison andWaterman, 2002). Conditional models,\nhowever, allow for the examination of case control and matched data while fixing and separating\nhigher-level effects from all of the individual-level effects in the model; these models do not\ninclude the additional parameter estimates in the final model.\nIn the case of the conditional fixed-effect model, each fixed-effect term is conditioned\non the constant term of the logit estimator, in this case, it allows us to control for unobserved\nvariation in the 96 federal court districts that may be caused by variation in district policies or\nvariation in courtroom behavior without the disadvantages inherent in adding 95 additional\nvariables to the equation. The conditional logistic fixed-effects model is well suited for the\ninherent structure of the analytic data, but it is not without shortcomings. First, because the\nconstant term is used to compute the fixed effects, it is lost to the model. As the constant term is\nnot of particular substantive interest in our analysis, this has no negative effect on our findings.\nSecond, the conditional fixed-effects model must drop all cases that do not vary within a group-\ning (Greene, 2003; Wooldridge, 2002). In this case, any federal district that had no terrorism\ncases was dropped from the analysis due to lack of within-group variation, which resulted in\nthe loss of a large portion of the individual cases in the data to hold constant the unobserved\nvariation in districts and in the complete loss of the firearm use equations.\nThe outcome of the conditional fixed-effects logit model is reported in Table A1. Because\nof lack of cases and variation between districts, the firearm-use equation failed to estimate. We\nwould like to note, however, that in the three equations with sufficient data, the parameter\nestimates were not substantively different than those in the equations reported in Table 4. This\nmodel and modeling technique may prove more useful as more individual-level data become\navailable with large sample sizes. In this case, it adds to our analysis by providing an additional\ncontrol--beyond the number of counts for each case--for the possibility that systematic varia-\ntions in courtroom behavior in federal courts are the cause of the observed relationship between\nterrorists and firearm charges.\nLegault \u00b7 Hendrickson\nT a b le A 1\nVariable ExpAny Firearm(SE) ExpPrimaryFirearm(SE) ExpFirearmPossession(SE)\n(sig.)\nNotes.SE=standarderror.\naEffectsgroupedbydistrictofprosecution.\nWeapon Choice and American Political Violence"
