Prevalent diabetes mellitus was ascertained at\nthe baseline examination, and incident diabetes melli-\ntus, during follow-up. Lower extremity amputation was\nascertained from hospital discharge records. Cox regres-\nsion analysis was used to estimate associations between\nrace, diabetes mellitus, and risk of first LEA.\nResults: During the study period, 158 LEAs occurred\namong 108 subjects. While black subjects constituted\njects with amputation (P = .002). The 20-year age-\nadjusted rate ratio of first LEAs for black subjects\u00adwhite\nsubjects was 2.14. Regression analyses confirmed the\nimportance of diabetes mellitus as a key LEA risk factor.\nThe association between prevalent diabetes mellitus and\nLEA risk was substantially higher (relative risk [RR],\n5.37]), highlighting the importance of diabetes mellitus\nduration on LEA risk.

The baseline interview in-\ncluded questions on medical conditions previously diag-\nnosed by a physician, smoking history, and education. The\nbaseline medical examination included measurements of\nheight, weight, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, sub-\nscapular and triceps skinfold thicknesses, and a urine glu-\ncose test (semiquantitative). Body mass index (BMI, cal-\nculated as weight in kilograms divided by the height in\nmeterssquared)wascalculatedfromsubjects'baselineheight\nand weight and was used as a measure of relative weight.\nThe ratio of the subscapular and triceps skinfolds was used\nas an indicator of fat distribution.6,7 Subjects were classi-\nfied as hypertensive at baseline if they reported taking medi-\ncations for high blood pressure or had a systolic blood pres-\nsure of 160 mm Hg or higher and/or a diastolic blood\npressure of 95 mm Hg or higher. Follow-up interviews were\nAt baseline, subjects who responded yes to the question \"Has\na doctor ever told you that you have diabetes or sugar dia-\nbetes?\" were categorized as having prevalent diabetes melli-\ntus. Subjects who did not report diabetes mellitus but who\nhad evidence of glucose in their urine at baseline were also\nconsidered to have prevalent diabetes mellitus. At each fol-\nlow-up survey, data were used from subjects' reports of phy-\nsician-diagnosed diabetes mellitus, health care facility\nrecords, and death certificates to identify incident cases of\ndiabetes mellitus (International Classification of Diseases,\nNinth Revision [codes 250.xx]).11 The characteristics of sub-\njects with diabetes in this cohort have been described pre-\nviously.12 Fasting glucose was not measured at baseline or\nduring follow-up, nor was an oral glucose tolerance test con-\nducted.\nAt each of the 3 follow-up interviews, subjects or their prox-\nies were asked whether the subject had stayed overnight\nin a hospital since the previous interview. The Interna-\ntional Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision procedure\ncodes corresponding to these 3 sets of hospitalization data\nwere used to identify subjects with nontraumatic LEAs\nCrude rates of amputation (per 1000 person-years) were\ncalculated separately for black and white subjects, and the\nage-adjusted rate ratio was calculated using the age distri-\ncause subjects with multiple amputations contribute more\nthan 1 event to the numerator, rates were calculated in 2\nways (1) the total number of LEAs during follow-up and\n(2) the subjects' first amputation during follow-up. The un-\npaired t test and 2 statistic were used to examine differ-\nences in baseline characteristics between subjects who had\nan LEA during follow-up and those who had none, and be-\ntween subjects with 1 LEA and those with 2 or more. Us-\ning Cox proportional hazards regression, we modeled as-\nsociations between race, diabetes mellitus, and risk of first\nLEA. These analyses were controlled for potentially con-\nfounding factors, those variables hypothesized to be asso-\nciated with both the primary exposures of interest (race and\ndiabetes mellitus) and also with the outcome (LEA).16,17 The\nproportional hazards regression procedure (PHREG) was\nused in the SAS statistical software system (SAS Institute,\nSince duration of diabetes mellitus increases the risk\nof macrovascular complications, our models included sepa-\nrate indicator variables for incident and prevalent diabe-\ntes mellitus. While these variables are imperfect proxies for\ndiabetes mellitus duration, distinguishing between case types\nin this way has been used in previous studies of diabetic\ncomplications.18 We examined the interaction of race and\nboth prevalent and incident diabetes mellitus by using cross-\nproduct terms (eg, race  prevalent diabetes) to deter-\nmine if the risk of LEA associated with diabetes mellitus\nduration depended on race. White subjects without dia-\nbetes were considered the reference group.\nAge, sex, smoking history (ever vs never), baseline hy-\npertension, and BMI and subscapular and triceps skinfold\nvalues were considered potential confounders of the asso-\nciation with LEA of either race or diabetes mellitus. Socio-\neconomic status (SES) was also considered a potential con-\nfounder. While no single variable adequately represents the\ncomplexity of SES, previous studies of diabetes mellitus have\nused education as a proxy,19-21 and it is reasonable to specu-\nlate that this variable is also associated with LEA. Qua-\ndratic terms for continuous variables were examined to de-\ntermine if these measures had nonlinear associations with\nLEA risk. We also tested for interaction between race and\nsmoking, baseline hypertension, and education.\nRegression analyses were restricted to black and white\nthere were no LEAs in the youngest age group. Disarticula-\ntions of the knee and hip were not considered in multivari-\nate analyses, since they are unlikely to be associated with dia-\nbetesmellitus.Subjectswithmissingdatafortheindependent\nvariables were excluded from multivariate analyses.\nWe entered age, race, and prevalent and incident dia-\nbetes mellitus into an initial model predicting LEA risk. Po-\ntential confounders were then entered to determine how\nthey influenced preliminary associations, and interaction\nand quadratic terms were examined. The Wald 2 test was\nused to test the significance of individual  coefficients, and\nthe likelihood ratio test was used to define the final model.\nWe tested the proportionality assumption in 2 ways with\na focus on race and diabetes mellitus. First, we plotted the\nlog(-log[survival]) function against log time separately for\nstrata of diabetes mellitus and race, and then we examined\ninteractions of log(time) with race and diabetes mellitus\n\u00a91999 American Medical Association.

The crude and\nrespectively.\nAmputations of toes and amputations below and\nabove the knee accounted for 86.7% of LEAs; the loca-\ntions of the LEAs were distributed similarly in black and\nwhite subjects. As expected, amputations of toes were\nmore common in younger adults and, conversely, LEAs\nbelow and above the knee were more frequent in older\nage groups.\nAlthough black subjects made up only 15.2% of the\nNHEFS cohort, they accounted for 27.8% of subjects\nwith LEAs (P.002; Table 2). Lower extremity ampu-\ntations occurred more frequently in individuals with\nprevalent or incident diabetes mellitus than in subjects\nwith no diabetes (P.001 for both prevalent and inci-\ndent cases). Subjects with LEAs were significantly older\n[P.001]), and men underwent more amputations than\nwomen (P = .02). Baseline BMI was higher in subjects\n[P.001]), as was the occurrence of baseline hyperten-\nence in smoking history between the 2 groups (61.0% vs\n56.9%), but subjects with LEAs were significantly more\nlikely than those without to have discontinued high\nThirty-seven subjects (34.2% of all amputees) had\nstriking differences between subjects with 1 vs those with\nmultiple LEAs were race and diabetes mellitus: 53% of\nblack subjects with LEAs had 2 or more, compared with\nonly 26% of their white counterparts (P = 008).

There were no significant interactions between race\nand diabetes mellitus in this model. The final model was\nparsimonious, including variables for age, race, preva-\nlent and incident diabetes mellitus, hypertension, smok-\ning, and education. Relative to subjects who remained\nwithout diabetes throughout the study, those with preva-\nlent diabetes mellitus had more than 7 times the risk of\nincident diabetes mellitus had over 3 times the risk of\ntions between diabetes mellitus and LEA were only slightly\nattenuated compared with the initial model.

These analyses revealed that lack of a high school\neducation increased the RR of LEA among white sub-\nbetes mellitus, smoking, and hypertension.\nCOMMENT\nTo our knowledge, this is the longest prospective study\nof the combined effects of race and diabetes mellitus on\nthe risk of LEA, and one of few with black and white sub-\njects and subjects with and without diabetes drawn from\nthe same population. Our preliminary analyses showed\nLEAs was 2.8 times higher in black than white subjects,\nand that the age-adjusted rate of the first LEA was 2.1\ntimes higher in black than white subjects.\nThe NHEFS offers a better design and population\nthan prior studies of LEA. Previous investigations of LEA\nhave been based on data from subjects with diabetes alone,\nwithout a comparison group without diabetes.5,24 These\nstudies also had shorter follow-up periods,1,5,24 were not\nlongitudinal4,25 or were not adjusted for potential con-\nPrevalent Incident No Diabetes\nSubjects With Amputation, %\nDiabetes Mellitus Status\nBlack\nWhite\nFigure 2.

Avail-\nability of data on confounding variables allowed adjust-\nments in our multivariate analysis that were not pos-\nsible in previous studies that used hospital discharge data\nto ascertain LEA. Thus, the RRs calculated from our re-\ngression models provide an accurate description of the\nassociations between prevalent and incident diabetes\nmellitus, race, and risk of LEA from the early 1970s to\nRESULTS FROM multivariate analyses indi-\ncated that race per se may play a limited\nrole in the cause of first LEAs when edu-\ncation, smoking, and hypertension are also\nconsidered. We showed that following ad-\njustment for these factors, a significant age- and diabe-\ntes mellitus\u00adadjusted association between being black and\nrisk of LEA was diminished below conventional signifi-\ncance. However, the relatively small number of black sub-\njects with LEA makes interpretation of this finding dif-\nficult. There may be unexplained factors that made black\nsubjects more susceptible to diabetic complications lead-\ning to LEA. Alternatively, better adjustment in this study\nfor SES or environmental factors might have dimin-\nished the LEA risk associated with race. Further studies\nare needed to address these questions.\nBlack individuals with diabetes mellitus may have\nworse glycemic control than their white counterparts, and\nmay therefore be at increased risk of complications lead-\ning to LEA. Recent data from the Third National Health\nand Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) sup-\nport this hypothesis, showing that black subjects with\nimpaired fasting glucose and undiagnosed and diag-\nnosed diabetes mellitus had higher mean glycosylated he-\nmoglobin levels than white subjects.27 Along the same\nlines, diabetes mellitus may be identified later among black\nthan among white subjects, thereby increasing the preva-\nlence of undiagnosed diabetes mellitus and raising the\npossibility that vascular and nerve damage and plantar\nulcers may already be present at, or develop shortly af-\nter, diabetes mellitus diagnosis in black patients. This may\nreduce or eliminate the period of secondary prevention\nin this group.28 Greater rates of undiagnosed diabetes\nmellitus among black compared with white subjects were\ndemonstrated in NHANES III.\nAnother explanation for our findings is that care for\ndiabetes mellitus, diabetic neuropathy, and peripheral ar-\nterial disease may be worse among black subjects than\nwhite, leading to higher rates of amputation. A recent\nstudy showed that of individuals with diabetes mellitus,\nblack subjects were more likely than white subjects to\nsmoke and have uncontrolled hypertension, and less likely\nto have health insurance or a private health care pro-\nvider.29 Another study showed that older black subjects\nwere more likely than older white subjects to have LEA,\nand less likely to undergo lower extremity revascular-\nization and angioplasty, 2 limb-sparing surgical proce-\ndures.30 Racial differences in glycemic control among dia-\nbetic subjects, duration of diabetes mellitus prior to\ndiagnosis, prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes mellitus,\nand access to appropriate health care may all contribute\nto the higher rates of LEA among black Americans. How-\never, these factors are more strongly related to social rather\nthan biological phenomena. Consistent with the latter hy-\npothesis is the recent finding of an inverse association\nbetween SES and all-cause mortality among individuals\nwith diabetes in the Whitehall Study and the WHO Mul-\ntinational Study of Vascular Disease in Diabetes.31\nIf elevated LEA risk were related more to black race\nthan to social factors, one would not expect to find an\nassociation between SES and LEA risk among white sub-\njects. However, the significant association between SES\nand LEA among white subjects and the lower race-\nassociated risk among their black counterparts follow-\ning adjustment for education, smoking, and hyperten-\nsion suggest not only that race per se may play a limited\nrole in the cause of LEA, but also that social factors act\nto increase LEA risk regardless of race.\nOur results are consistent with findings from pre-\nvious studies of LEA to the extent that we found signifi-\ncant associations between increased risk of LEA and dia-\nresults indicate that the risk of LEA was 7 and 3 times\nhigher among individuals with prevalent and incident dia-\nbetes mellitus, respectively, compared with those with-\nout diabetes. The graded risks associated with these case\ntypes suggest an effect of duration of diabetes mellitus\non LEA risk, and are consistent with previous findings.5\nWhile rates of all LEAs are important from a public\nhealth and resource use perspective, the rate of first LEA\nis more related to cause. In our investigation, age-\nadjusted rates of all and of first LEAs indicated that black\nsubjects experienced higher rates of LEA than white, a\nfinding that is consistent with a previous study.4 How-\never, it should be emphasized that in this and other stud-\nies that used hospital records to ascertain LEA,4,24-26 it is\noften not possible to determine if the \"first\" LEA ascer-\ntained during the study period is actually the first LEA\nfor that individual.\nhad diabetes mellitus listed as a discharge diagnosis.\nThis finding is consistent with results from the National\nHospital Discharge Survey, which found that 51% of all\npatients with LEAs had diabetes mellitus as a discharge\ndiagnosis. It is consistent also with data from the Cen-\nters for Disease Control and Prevention, which showed\nthat 45% of LEAs were performed on people with diabe-\ntes mellitus listed on a medical record.4,32 However, in\nthe NHEFS, diabetes mellitus may have been present in\na larger proportion of LEAs than we report. Two of the\n54 subjects with LEAs who did not have diabetes melli-\ntus on their discharge records reported diabetes mellitus\nat baseline, and 6 reported diabetes mellitus during\nfollow-up. Although these subjects were classified as\nhaving diabetes mellitus in our analyses, the discrepancy\nbetween self-reported diabetes mellitus and diabetes\nmellitus listed on discharge records following LEA high-\nlights underreporting of diabetes mellitus\u00adrelated LEAs\n\u00a91999 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.\non these records. Such underreporting results in an\nunderestimation of the contribution of diabetes mellitus\nto the occurrence of LEA.\nThis study has several limitations, mostly related to\nthe data available in the NHEFS. Since fasting glucose\nlevels were not available, we relied on subject reports of\nphysician-diagnosed diabetes mellitus, hospital dis-\ncharge records, and death certificates. It is known that self-\nreporting underestimates true prevalence of diabetes melli-\ntus by 30% to 50% and that hospital records underreport\ndiabetes mellitus by as much as 40%. Diabetes mellitus is\nalso underreported on death certificates.33-36 It was not pos-\nsible to determine the extent of misclassification result-\ning from undiagnosed and unreported diabetes mellitus.\nHowever, since diabetes mellitus was more frequently un-\ndiagnosedinblacksubjectsthaninwhitesubjects,andsince\nblacks were at higher risk of LEAs, any misclassification\nthat occurred would likely have resulted in an under-\nestimation of the association between race and LEA. Un-\nderreporting and misclassification of diabetes mellitus\nmay help explain why the magnitude of the association\nbetween diabetes mellitus and LEA was lower here than\nin a previous study4 in which the rate ratio was reported\nto be as high as 15. However, in the Most and Sinnock4\nstudy, ascertainment of diabetes mellitus was limited to\ninformation gathered from the same hospital discharge\nrecords from which the LEA data were obtained. In our\nstudy, diabetes mellitus diagnoses from hospital dis-\ncharge records were supplemented by a urine glucose\ntest at baseline and by subject reports throughout the\nfollow-up period. More extensive diabetes mellitus as-\ncertainment and diabetes mellitus ascertainment in-\ndependent of the hospital visit during which the LEA oc-\ncurred may also help explain the difference in rates\nbetween studies.\nIn summary, this study showed that during 20 years\nof follow-up, the age-adjusted rate of LEA among black\nAmericans was 2.8 times that of their white counterparts,\nand that diabetes mellitus and its duration were strong pre-\ndictors of LEA risk. Hypertension, smoking, and low edu-\ncationallevelwerealsostronglypredictiveofLEArisk.These\nfactors appear to diminish the biological link between race\nand LEA. Decreasing the occurrence of diabetes mellitus\nby addressing risk factors such as obesity as well as reduc-\ntions in hypertension and smoking are strategies that\nmay have a substantial impact on the future occurrence\nof LEA among both black and white adults.\nReprints: Helaine E.
