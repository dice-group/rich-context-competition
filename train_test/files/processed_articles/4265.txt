Therefore, this article aims at examining the role of service quality in strengthening the relationship between\npartnership quality and human resource (HR) outsourcing success. The samples were obtained from 96 manufacturing\norganizations in Penang, Malaysia. The results showed that partnership quality variables such as trust, business understanding,\nand communication have significant positive impact on HR outsourcing success, whereas in general, service quality was found\nto partially moderate these relationships.

Although HR departments used to be known as per-\nforming administrative work, they are now becoming more\nand more strategic oriented to assist organizations to compete\nand sustain through various challenges (Braun, Pull, Alewell,\nmany researchers posit that HR outsourcing concentrates on\nrestructuring the HR department, refocusing activities, and\nredeploying HR resources (Chiang & Shih, 2011; Greer,\nYoungblood, & Gray, 1999), so that organizations can \"make\nmore by doing less\" (Gilley & Rasheed, 2000).\nThe existing literature only suggests that among the areas\nneglected in HR are the partnership quality and the impact of\nservice quality on the success of HR outsourcing. The market\nfor the service providers of outsourced services is growing\nrapidly and concurrently, HR outsourcing has evolved from\nsingle service provider to multiple service providers easily\ncontracted to satisfy the different needs of the organizations\nThe quality of relationship between a client and a vendor and\nthe quality of the service provided by a vendor to the client\nhave been indicated to influence the success or failure of the\noutsourcing initiative (Chakrabarty, Whitten, & Green,\n2008). As HR outsourcing development in Malaysia has not\nbeen intensively studied, managers may still have lack of\nknowledge on how to select the right service providers and\nhow to manage the outsourcing relationship (Ee, Abdul-\nHalim, & Ramayah, 2013). To many organizations, manag-\ning the relationships between organizations and service\nproviders has become increasingly complex because both\nparties may have different desires and agenda when develop-\ning and maintaining HR outsourcing relationships (Ates,\nchoice of outsourcing partners can also impede the success\nand quality of outsourcing relationship (Elmuti & Kathawala,\nright partners and are not able to build a stable and trustwor-\nthy relationship with their service providers.

Along these lines, both parties need to develop a cer-\ntain mechanism to strengthen the quality of HR outsourcing\nrelationship to function more as a partnership (Ates, 2013;\ninvolves a high level of trust, commitment, quality commu-\nnication, understanding, and strong top management support\nbetween the organization and the service provider. High ser-\nvice quality from the service provider would involve high\nreliability, responsiveness, tangible, assurance, and empathy.\nUndeniably, these aspects of partnership quality and service\nquality would positively influence the effective utilization of\nvarious HR functions for better interactions between the ser-\nvice provider and the organizations, and eventually may lead\nto HR outsourcing success.\nNevertheless, the existing literature on partnership seems\nto take the relationship among partnership quality, service\nquality, and outsourcing success for granted (Chakrabarty et\nHR outsourcing is successful when high-quality partnership\nexists. Consistent with the above argument, this study was\ndesigned to explore the factors of partnership quality in the\ncontext of HR outsourcing that may lead to outsourcing suc-\ncess, which would be moderated by service quality. After a\nbrief review of related literature and hypotheses develop-\nment, the theoretical framework will be presented. The\nmethod and techniques used for the analysis and the results\nare given in the following sections. The final section presents\nthe discussion and limitations.\nLiterature Review\nTheoretical Perspectives and HR Outsourcing\nIn the literature on HR outsourcing, transaction cost theory\nand relational exchange theory provide insights into organiza-\ntional motivation for outsourcing. Transaction cost theory\nstates that there are economic costs involved in the transac-\nThe costs include operational costs (e.g., search costs, inven-\ntory holding costs, operation cost) and contractual costs (e.g.,\ncost of writing and enforcing a contract cost). Organizations\nneed to choose whether to produce and make an activity on\ntheir own or to outsource that activity. Relational exchange\ntheory also plays an important role in the framework of out-\nsourcing. Past studies of HR outsourcing have largely\nneglected the quality of relationship aspects of the client\u00ad\nvendor behavior. Much focus has been given on outsourcing\ntransaction as discrete events (Kim & Chung, 2003; Sheehan\n& Cooper, 2011). To place emphasis on the importance of\nmanaging outsourcing relationship for success, it is important\nto view HR outsourcing from the partnership perspective\nrather than solely from the economic perspective. It is neces-\nsary to include relational exchange characteristics along with\nseveral key dimensions. Relational structure can be used to\naddress the behavioral and procession aspects of relationship\nin joint ventures, partnership, and outsourcing arrangements\nPartnership Quality and Outsourcing Success\nIn general, a partnership involves common values that exist\namong parties involved (Ren, Ngai, & Cho, 2010).\nPartnership quality is very crucial in determining the success\nof HR outsourcing. Nevertheless, a part of the knowledge on\nbuilding successful partnership in HR outsourcing is becom-\ning a dilemma for many organizations. HR practitioners lack\nthe know-how in selecting their outsourcing vendors and\nthere are also concerns on how they should manage this out-\nless developed market, some organizations are even reluctant\nto establish a partnership in their outsourcing agreement,\nalthough this method has been proposed to be the most effec-\ntive method to achieve competitiveness. The most frequently\nreported problem in the outsourcing relationship among cli-\nents and their HR vendors is the inability to express and\ndescribe in detail what they require from the vendors (Ates,\n2013). This scenario will lead to conflict and inefficiency in\nthe outsourced activity.\nPartnership is not a new concept and it has long been\nexplored in the marketing and interorganizational systems\nresearch. Any organization's activities would not sustain\nwithout relationships with the surrounding environment\n(Raman, Chadee, Roxas, & Michailova, 2013). According to\ninterorganizational research, recognizing, analyzing, and\npromoting the interorganizational relationships are the pre-\nrequisites and keys for organization to gain knowledge,\ndeploy resources, and pursue continuous competitive advan-\ntages. By definition, interorganizational relationships embed-\nded in the organization are seen to be the repeated interaction\nand exchange process between organization and other orga-\nnizations, and a set of a series of sustained social connections\nThere have been different views on how to implement suc-\ncessful relationships. The two groups of thoughts that have\nemerged from previous researches are transactional style rela-\ntionship and partnership style relationship. The transactional\nrelationship is developed through a formal contract and part-\nnership is formed through relationship exchange that involves\nrisk and benefit sharing (Srinivasan, Mukherjee, & Gaur,\norganizations experienced difficulties in forming and manag-\ning successful outsourcing relationships. This problem caused\na shift from contractual relationship to a partnership relation-\nship in the outsourcing industry. Partnership allows two orga-\nnizations to achieve key organizational objectives and build\ncompetitive advantage in their respective industries (Ates,\nAbdul-Halim et al. 3\ning to study whether HR outsourcing success would be\naffected by the quality of the partnership. Quality can be\ndescribed as fitness of use. Partnership quality exists when\nrelationship serves its intended function and is successful in\nmeeting objectives of both parties. Partnership is affected by\norganizational, human, and environmental factors. Lee and\nKim (1999) propose that partnership has its own factors to\nrepresent quality. They state that there are several variables\nthat influence the degree of partnership quality and the degree\nof partnership quality is related to the outsourcing success.\nThey identify five factors that make up partnership quality,\nwhich are trust, business understanding, benefit and risk shar-\ning, conflict, and commitment. Anderson and Narus (1990)\nalso identify that trust can also lead to higher quality partner-\nship, besides other variables such as communication and top\nmanagement cooperation. All these factors have been identi-\nfied as the factors making up partnership quality. The com-\nmunication quality plays an effective role in partnership.\nEffective communication between partners is essential to\nachieve the intended objectives. In fact, effective communi-\ncation will lead to better informed parties, which in turn will\nmake each party to be more confident in the relationship and\nmore willing to maintain it (Lee & Kim, 1999; Swar, Moon,\nOh, & Rhee, 2012). Apart from that, the support from top\nmanagement is very essential and is considered as a prerequi-\nsite for every successful outsourcing partnership (Anderson\n& Weitz, 1989). Top management has to play an effective role\nto overcome the inevitable divergence of interest between\nparticipants and at the same time to share an understanding of\nthe benefits of collaboration (Rai, Borah, & Ramaprasad,\nWhen organization embarks on outsourcing relationship\nand selects a particular service provider, the organization\nmust be ready to maintain the relationship over a period of\ntime. The need to maintain such business relationships\nrequires a form of long-term relationship based on trust.\nBoth parties need to believe one another to perform actions\nthat will result in positive outcomes for the organizations\n1995). In addition, commitment also plays a critical role in\nthe development of a long-term relationship and in facilitat-\ning an exchange relationship. These relationships must con-\ntain a certain degree of sincerity, pledge, or promise of\nrelationship continuity between partners. Therefore, trust\nand commitment are the basic concepts of partnership style\nrelationship and these factors increase confidence in the rela-\ntionship and in turn lead to outsourcing success (Chu &\nsuccess is also motivated by business understanding,\nwhereby both parties have the ability to understand each\nother in terms of the operation dealings, behavior goals, and\nbusiness procedures and policies (Hsu, Wu, & Hsu, 2005;\nSrinivasan et al., 2011). In short, partnership quality helps\nfoster cooperative relationship based on trust, business\nunderstanding, commitment, communication, and the top\nare critical in determining the success of outsourcing, par-\nticularly in the area of HR.\nOutsourcing success refers to the overall organizational\nadvantage derived from HR outsourcing (Ren et al., 2010). In\nother words, outsourcing success is defined as the satisfaction\nwith the benefits attained by an organization as a result of\ndeploying outsourcing and successful outsourcing is a power-\nful tool for organization to generate values and gain competi-\ntive advantage (Grover et al., 1996). In fact, outsourcing\nsuccess can be identified from the business perspective and\nBusiness performance can be measured by the qualitative\nimpact of strategic and technological improvement and the\nquantitative improvement in terms of economic returns. Kim\nand Chung (2003) mention that there are two indicators for\noutsourcing success, namely, satisfaction and perceived ben-\nefits. Satisfaction involves evaluation of all aspects of the per-\nceived effectiveness of the interorganizational relationship. In\ncontrast, perceived benefits are clients' firm's perception of\nbenefits gained from a specific outsourcing relationship.\nSuccessful partnership enables the organizations to\nachieve organizational objectives and to build a competitive\nadvantage that each organization could not easily attain by\nlead to HR outsourcing success in which the effectiveness of\nthe business process is enhanced (Hsu et al., 2005). More\nfocus on core activities such as talent retention and career\nplanning provides value-added services in business, improves\nservice level and accountabilities, enhances quality of cus-\ntomer experience, and achieves cost optimization, which\nwould reflect on HR outsourcing success for firms. Studies\nhave found a significant relationship between partnership\nquality and outsourcing (Grover et al., 1996; Ren et al.,\n2010). Indeed, partnership allows two parties to achieve key\norganizational objectives and build competitive advantage,\nand a good partnership with service providers is proposed as\nthe key success in outsourcing strategy. Based on the above\narguments, it is proposed as follows:\nHypothesis 1 (H1): There is a positive relationship\nbetween partnership quality and HR outsourcing success.\nHypothesis 1a (H1a): There is a positive relationship\nbetween trust and outsourcing success.\nHypothesis 1b (H1b): There is a positive relationship\nbetween business understanding and outsourcing\nsuccess.\nHypothesis 1c (H1c): There is a positive relationship\nbetween commitment and outsourcing success.\nHypothesis 1d (H1d): There is a positive relationship\nbetween communication and outsourcing success.\nHypothesis 1e (H1e): There is a positive relationship\nbetween top management support and outsourcing\nsuccess.\n4 SAGE Open\nService Quality\nService quality can be defined as the conformance to cus-\ntomer requirements in the delivery of a service (Chakrabarty\nfundamentally different from physical goods and the mea-\nsurement of quality in service delivery has been proved to\nbe more complicated than measuring the quality of physical\nServices tend to be performance oriented, therefore making\nprecise specifications to a uniform quality difficult to mea-\nsure and execute (Abu-El Samen, Akroush, & Abu-Lail,\nParasuraman, Zeithaml, and Berry (1988) define service\nquality as the degree and discrepancy between service\nreceiver's expectation and perceptions. This means that the\nsmaller the gap, the greater service quality is achieved.\nService quality is more difficult to measure in comparison\nwith quality of goods because the characteristics of a ser-\nvice are intangible, inseparable, and heterogeneous. Service\nquality perceptions will result from a comparison of con-\nsumer expectations with actual service performance.\nService quality has been the most researched area of ser-\nvices marketing (Fisk, Brown, & Bitner, 1993) and it was\nfirst established by Parasuraman, Berry, and Zeithaml\n(1985) who undertook an exploratory investigation of ser-\nvice quality by commencing with a series of focus group\ninterviews with consumers and executives at four nation-\nally recognized service organizations. As a result, the\nSERVQUAL instrument was developed as a frequently\nused measure of service quality.\nSpecifically related to outsourcing success, service qual-\nity research has shown many mixed results. Grover et al.\n(1996) posit that service quality significantly and negatively\ninteracts with application development outsourcing in its\nrelationship with outsourcing success. In this case, outsourc-\ning quality evaluations are not made solely on the partner-\nship quality but will also involve evaluation of service quality\nin the process of service delivery. As noted, service quality is\na measure of how well the delivered service matches cus-\ntomer expectations (Chakrabarty et al., 2008). HR outsourc-\ning is a service that is provided by a service provider for\norganizationsthatinvolvefacetsofservicequality.Delivering\nquality service means conforming to customer expectation\non a consistent basis that is believed to lead to better out-\nsourcing success. Outsourcing implementation involves the\nquality of both the service provider and the partnership.\nGrover et al. (1996) suggest that both partnership quality and\nservice quality affect the degree of outsourcing success.\nOver the years, there have been a variety of studies on\ndifferent issues pertaining to service quality and partnership\nquality. Determinants of partnership quality have been stud-\nied by Saunders, Gebelt, and Qing (1997); Lee and Kim\nthat partnership quality is a key predictor of outsourcing\neffectiveness, existing literature fails to examine the impor-\ntance of service quality that may contribute to partnership\nthat partnership is the key to outsourcing success and this\nrelationship will be stronger (moderated) under increased\nlevel of service quality.\nPartnership context can be described as the degree part-\nners believe that this relationship can be sustained over\ntime (Chu & Wang, 2012). There are two reasons on how\nservice level may affect the performance of the partnership.\nFirst, poor quality service may lead to conflict in partner-\nship because the service provider is unable to meet the\norganization's needs. Conflicts arise because both parties\nare unable to meet a service agreement (Moore, 1998; Park\net al., 2012). Second, poor service quality may also destroy\ntrust in the partnership because firms are unable to believe\nthat the service provider's actions would result in positive\noutcomes for the firms, thus leading to outsourcing failure\n(Chakrabarty, 2008). To investigate and explore service\nquality of service providers, the Application Service\nProvider Quality model (ASP-Qual) instrument by Sigala\nby modifying the widely accepted SERVICE QUALITY\n(SERVQUAL) model developed by Parasuraman et al.\n(1988). Modification of instruments for measuring service\nquality in other environment is allowed because\nSERVQUAL is an instrument that collects only perception\ndata and these data may differ from an industry to another\nThe existing literature on partnership seems to take the\nrelationship between partnership quality and outsourcing\nsuccess for granted. Not many studies have been done on the\npartnership quality of HR outsourcing. Therefore, it is cru-\ncial to explore on service quality to strengthen the HR out-\nsourcing success. Based on the arguments above, it is\nproposed as follows:\nHypothesis 2 (H2): The relationship between partnership\nquality and HR outsourcing success will be stronger with\nhigher level of service quality.\nHypothesis 2a (H2a): The relationship between partner-\nship quality and outsourcing success will be stronger with\nhigher tangibles\nHypothesis 2b (H2b): The relationship between partner-\nship quality and outsourcing success will be stronger with\nhigher reliability.\nHypothesis 2c (H2c): The relationship between partner-\nship quality and outsourcing success will be stronger with\nhigher responsiveness.\nHypothesis 2d (H2d): The relationship between partner-\nship quality and outsourcing success will be stronger with\nhigher assurance.\nHypothesis 2e (H2e): The relationship between level of\npartnership quality and outsourcing success will be stron-\nger with higher empathy.\nAbdul-Halim et al. 5\nBased on the arguments above, the research model is\nexhibited in Figure 1.\nMethod\nPopulation and Sample\nThis study used a mail survey questionnaire to obtain the\ndata. The population of this study was manufacturing organi-\nzations in Malaysia that outsourced their HR function(s).\nThese organizations were selected from the Federation of\nMalaysia Manufacturer (FMM) Directory. The question-\nnaires were targeted to the head of HR department, or the\npersons responsible for HR of Malaysian manufacturing\norganizations who are engaged with HR outsourcing. They\nwere in the position to provide data on HR outsourcing and\ncan be considered as the best persons to interpret the success\nof outsourcing strategy. Purposive sampling method was\nused in which the organizations were first contacted to\nenquire on their engagement with HR outsourcing. Thus,\nonly organizations that outsourced HR functions were\nselected to participate in this study.\nMeasurement Instrument\nThe determination of outsourcing success was adopted\nfrom the instrument of Grover et al. (1996) and was\ndesigned on the 5-point Likert-type scale (1 = strongly dis-\nagree; 5 = strongly agree). The instrument was used to\nmeasure outsourcing business performance and was vali-\ndated by other researchers. The measurements for the vari-\nables used in the questionnaire were adopted from Lee and\nKim (1999). In this study, perceptual measure for the vari-\nables of partnership quality was employed. The 5-point\nLikert-type scale was also used to test the multi-item con-\nstructs for partnership quality such as trust, business under-\nstanding, top management support, communication, and\ncommitment. The measurement for service quality was\nadopted from the ASP-Qual model by Sigala (2004). The\n5-point Likert-type scale was used to test the dimensions of\nservice quality such as tangibles, reliability, assurance,\nresponsiveness, and empathy.\nFactor Analysis\nFactor analysis was conducted to check the validity and reliabil-\nity of the measurement scales. The Statistical Package for the\nSocial Sciences (SPSS) was used to analyze and test the hypoth-\neses. The results of Barlett's Test of Sphericity for the three\nseparate groups were significant and the Kaiser\u00adMeyer\u00adOlkin\n(KMO) measures of sampling adequacy were all from 0.7 to\n0.86 with the percentage of variance explained above 42% for\nall the factors. The cutoff used for factor loadings was set at 0.5\nto ensure that each item was only uniquely assigned to only one\nfactor. Cronbach's alpha of each factor is as follows:\nAnalysis and Results\nProfile of the Respondents\nOf the 228 questionnaires distributed, a total of 99 question-\nnaires were returned at the end of the data collection process.\nThus, the response rate was 43.42%. Although the response\nrate was less than 50%, Three of the ninety-nine question-\nnaires returned were less than 30% completed by the respon-\ndents and hence were abandoned from the analysis. The final\n96 completed sets of questionnaire were used in this study.\nTable 1 shows the profile of the respondents.\n28.1% of the respondents were from the electronics and\nelectrical industry and 76% of the organizations employed\nless than 10 HR employees. In terms of the position of the\nrespondents, 42.7% of them were the HR managers and\nthe mean period for the outsourcing of HR function was\nabout 5 years with an average of about 1,002 employees.\nOn the profile of the number of HR functions outsourced by\nthe organizations, training was the most frequently outsourced\nfunction (63.5%). The recruitment function recorded the sec-\nond highest percentage with 58.3%, followed by operator/labor\nsupply with 44.8%. The least outsourced function was com-\npensation and benefits with 16.7%. Table 2 summarizes the\nvarious HR functions outsourced by the respondents.\nThe Effect of Partnership Quality on Outsourcing\nSuccess\nThe results showed that 46% of the variations in outsourcing\nsuccess can be explained by the partnership quality\nPartnership Quality\n\u00b7 Business\nUnderstanding\n\u00b7 Trust\n\u00b7 Commitment\n\u00b7 Communication\n\u00b7 Top management\nService Quality\n\u00b7 Tangibles\n\u00b7 Reliability\n\u00b7 Assurance\n\u00b7 Responsiveness\n\u00b7 Empathy\nHR Outsourcing\nSuccess\nFigure 1.

The significance of F change was 0.00, implying\nthat there was a significant relationship between partnership\nquality and outsourcing success. The results showed support\nfor H1a, H1b, and H1d. Trust was found to be positively and\nsignificantly correlated at 1% level ( = 0.47). The beta value\nof .47 indicated that trust was the most influential variable in\nexplaining outsourcing success. As a result, H1a was sup-\nported. In addition, business understanding also showed a\nsignificant impact on the success of outsourcing ( = 0.16).\nTherefore, H1b was also supported. H1c was also supported\nin which communication showed a significant relationship\nwith outsourcing success ( = 0.26). In contrast, commit-\nment and top management support were found to be not sta-\ntistically significant with the outsourcing success.As a result,\nH1c and H1e were not supported .\nThe Moderating Effect of Service Quality on\nOutsourcing Success\nFive hierarchical regression analyses were performed in this\nstudy to examine the relationship between partnership\nquality and outsourcing success with service quality as the\nmoderator. Analyses were carried out for components of ser-\nvice quality, namely tangibles, reliability, responsibility,\nassurance, and empathy. In Step 1, the five partnership qual-\nity variables were entered with outsourcing success as the\ndependent variable. In Step 2, the moderating variable was\nentered. Finally, in Step 3, the interaction terms were entered.\nA significant change in R-squared in Step 3 would indicate\nthe existence of the moderator effect. Initial data on normal\np\u00adp plots and histogram of all SPSS results were normally\ndistributed. Therefore, the basic assumptions of linearity and\nnormality were met.\nTable 4 presents the model summary for the three-step\nhierarchical regression results with tangibles as the modera-\ntor variable. As shown in Table 4, tangibles showed a signifi-\ncant positive relationship ( = 0.24, p < .05) with outsourcing\nsuccess. It was also observed that the significance of F\nchange was .02 (p <.05) in Step 3, implying that three of the\ninteraction terms were significant, namely, trust ( = 2.06, p\n( = 2.03, p < .05). These findings suggested that tangibles\nonly moderated three of the five independent variables inves-\ntigated. The R-squared change with the influence of the\nquasi-moderator was 8%.\nTable 1.

Regression for Partnership Quality and Outsourcing\nSuccess.\nIndependent variable Standardized beta\nAbdul-Halim et al. 7\nTo interpret the moderator effect, trust, commitment,\ncommunication, and tangibles were split at the median to\nform low and high subgroups. Then, each subgroup was\nplotted against outsourcing success. A similar method was\nused for the other independent variables. Figures 2 to 4\nshow the interaction effect, thus H2a was partially\nsupported.\nTherefore, interactive line graphs were used to explain the\nmoderator effects. The results in Figure 2 show that when\ntangibles level was high, outsourcing success increased from\nlow to high as trust level increased. When tangibles level was\nlow, the rate of increase for outsourcing success was very\nmuch lower, as trust level increased from low to high.\nTherefore, it can be assumed that when tangibles level was\nhigh, it had a greater impact on outsourcing success, as trust\nlevel increased from low to high.\nFrom Figure 3, it can be observed that for the high tangi-\nbles level, the impact of commitment on outsourcing success\nwas stronger compared with the low tangibles level.\nThe result shown in Figure 4 implies that the impact of\ncommunication on outsourcing was stronger for low tangi-\nbles level as compared with high tangibles level.\nAs can be observed from Table 5, the moderator (reli-\nability) showed no significant relationship with the depen-\ndent variable (HR outsourcing success). Reliability was\nfound to be a pure moderator. Significance of F change was\n.01 (p < .05) in Step 3 of the hierarchical regression analy-\nsis, indicating that one of the interaction terms was signifi-\ncant, namely, top management support ( = 2.58, p < .05).\nThe R-squared change was 10%.\nAs can be observed from Figure 5, for a high level of reli-\nability, increase in top management support had less influ-\nence on outsourcing success.

Therefore,\nH2d was not supported because the relationship between\npartnership quality and outsourcing success was not stronger\nwith higher reliability.\nAs shown in Table 6, the moderator (responsiveness)\nshowed a significant positive relationship with outsourcing\nsuccess ( = 0.20, p < .05). Therefore, responsiveness was a\nquasi-moderator and R-squared change was observed to be\nLow High\nCommunication\nMean Outsourcing Success\nTangibles\nLow\nHigh\nFigure 4.

Significance of F change was .07 (p < .1) in\nStep 3 of the hierarchical regression analysis, indicating that\none of the interaction terms, namely, communication ( =\nAs shown in Figure 6, when responsiveness level was low,\nincreased level of communication from low to high had no\nimpact on outsourcing success. However, when responsive-\nness level was high, outsourcing success increased as com-\nmunication increased from low to high. Hence, this finding\nsuggested that a high level of responsiveness had a significant\nimpact on outsourcing success, as communication level\nincreased from low to high. Based on the findings shown in\nFigure 6, H2c was supported.\nTable 7 shows the result of the hierarchical regression\nanalysis with assurance as the moderator. In Step 2, R-squared\nindicated that 49% of outsourcing success was explained. Of\nthe 49%, 4% was explained by assurance variable. The\nincrease was significant (p < .05). Thus, assurance had a\npositive relationship with outsourcing success ( = 0.31, p <\n.05). In Step 3, all the five interaction terms were added into\nthe equation. No interaction terms were found to be signifi-\ncant. Based on the findings, H2d was not supported.\nAs shown in Table 8, it can be concluded that empathy\nhad no significant positive relationship with outsourcing suc-\ncess. Therefore, it was a pure moderator. It was also observed\nthat the significance of F change was .06 (p < .1) in Step 3,\nimplying that one of the interaction terms, namely, trust was\nsignificant ( = 2.18, p < .10). The finding presented that\nempathy only moderated one of five independent variables\ninvestigated. The R-squared change was 6%.\nThe results shown in Figure 7 imply that when empathy\nlevel is low, outsourcing success will increase from low to\nhigh as trust level increases. At a high level of empathy, the\nincrease in outsourcing success is stronger as trust level\nincreases. Therefore, it can be concluded that a high level of\nempathy has a greater influence on outsourcing success,\nwhen trust level increases from low to high. As such, H2e\nwas supported.\nDiscussion\nThe results revealed that there was a strong positive relation-\nship between trust and outsourcing success. This result was\nconsistent with previous works such as Lee and Kim (1999),\nGurung and Prater (2006). Trust is an important component\nin partnership quality because it is a central aspect of a suc-\ncessful outsourcing relationship from the beginning of a rela-\nMoore, 1998). An absence of trust can lead to disruption of\ninformation flow, coordination problems, and conflicts\nbetween organizations.\nThe finding also indicates that business understanding is\nan important factor in an outsourcing agreement because of\nthe shared responsibility, benefits, and risks involved in the\nprocess. Essentially, the organizations' profit is partly\ndepending on the ability of their outsourcing partner to sup-\nport their business operations. Understanding clients' expec-\ntation and knowing the organization's capability in providing\nthese services will lead to a viable partnership (Chu & Wang,\nThis finding suggests that communication is a critical\nactivity that allows information flow between different\nLow High\nCommunication\nMean Outsourcing Success\nResponsiveness\nLow\nHigh\nFigure 6.

This\npractice will prevent loss of time and wastage of resources,\nthus leading to a better outsourcing outcome. Therefore,\nmeaningful discussion is vital in planning, goal setting,\nimplementation, coordination, and performance evaluation.\nHowever, the results show that neither commitment nor\ntop management support has a significant association with\nHR outsourcing success. This finding is not consistent with\nthe findings of Lee and Kim (1999). It is possible that for\nMalaysian organizations, the role of commitment is over-\nshadowed by other components of partnership quality such\nas trust and business understanding. Initial trust will lead\nboth parties to the disposition to believe that the other party\nwould fulfill the commitment and behave in a predictable\nunderstanding and communication serve as important eco-\nnomic and cognitive cues in outsourcing success.\nOrganizations are more dependent on the higher trust, stron-\nger business understanding, and better communication as\nthese elements are the drivers to positively influence out-\nsourcing success. As for top management support, it can be\nassumed that HR practitioners are able to manage the out-\nsourcing relationship proficiently without the assistance of\nthe top management. This may be due to the fact that the\nemployees themselves are responsible or have a positive atti-\ntude in making outsourcing a success. Once top management\nhas decided what functions to outsource, they typically del-\negate the commitment to their middle management to man-\nage and administer the outsourcing activities as they believe\nthat their employees have the capability and functional\nknowledge in making it a success.\nAs for the moderating impact, tangibles were found to\nmoderate the relationship between partnership quality (trust,\ncommitment, and communication) and outsourcing success.\nNevertheless, the hypotheses for variable tangibles were\nonly partially supported. The relationship between trust and\ncommitment with outsourcing success was found to be stron-\nger with a higher level of tangibles. In contrast, relationship\nbetween communication and outsourcing success was stron-\nger at a lower level of tangibles. Perhaps, when tangibles\nlevel was high, the customers were able to observe and feel\nfor themselves the ability of their service providers.\nTherefore, when tangibles are already high, an increase in\ncommunication level would not bring about much change in\noutsourcing success.\nNext, reliability was found not associated with the rela-\ntionship between partnership quality (top management sup-\nport) and outsourcing success. The results indicated that HR\noutsourcing success was influenced more by partnership\nquality at a low level of reliability than by a high level of reli-\nability. The relationship between top management support\nand outsourcing success was stronger at a lower level of reli-\nability. Top management support was more important for out-\nsourcingsuccessatlowlevelsofreliability,astopmanagement\nwould need to step in to intervene. In other words, when reli-\nability is low, top management support is needed to closely\nLow High\nTrust\nMean Outsourcing Success\nEmpathy\nLow\nHigh\nFigure 7.

If all\nother efforts fail to improve performance, top management\nalso has the power to cease the relationship with the service\nprovider. Thus, when reliability level of service provider is\nhigh, an increase in top management support will not bring a\nsignificant change in outsourcing success, as HR practitioners\nare trusted to be able to manage the partners on their own.\nResponsiveness was found to positively moderate the\nrelationship between partnership quality (communication)\nand outsourcing success. The relationship between commu-\nnication and outsourcing success was stronger with a higher\nlevel of responsiveness. When responsiveness level is high,\ncommunication could bring a significant improvement in\noutsourcing success. The service providers will help the cus-\ntomers and provide them with prompt services through com-\nmunication. In contrast, if the service providers are not\nresponsive, then any information derived from communica-\ntion would not be used for improvement purposes.\nResponsiveness is needed for all service providers to remain\ncompetitive, as the response time matters most to customers\nin relationship for outsourcing success. In this study, it was\nalso observed that assurance did not significantly moderate\nthe relationship between the partnership quality (trust, busi-\nness understanding, commitment, communication, and top\nmanagement support) and outsourcing success. The service\nprovider's ability to inspire trust and confidence through\nknowledge and courteous actions of their employees is not\nable to influence the relationship between partnership quality\nand outsourcing success. Other than that, assurance was\nfound to directly influence outsourcing success but it did not\nmoderate the relationship.\nFinally, it was found that the relationship between trust\nand outsourcing success was stronger with a higher level of\nempathy. When empathy level is high, trust could bring a\nsignificant improvement in outsourcing success because ser-\nvice providers are thoughtful, considerate, and able to pro-\nvide customized services whenever the need arises.\nEmpathetic service providers are dependable especially dur-\ning crisis and emergencies because they can be trusted to\nthink of their clients'best interest in the outsourcing relation-\nships. At lower levels of empathy, increasing levels of trust\nalso would not bring about much outsourcing success\nbecause service providers are not able to perform to the\nrequired level of customization.\nImplications\nThe findings of this study are of value not only to the practi-\ntioners responsible for managing HR outsourcing, but\nequally to the researchers interested in understanding the\nphenomenon of HR outsourcing relationship. This study\ncontributes to the body of knowledge in distinguishing the\ndimensions of partnership quality and service quality in the\ncontext of HR outsourcing success. It specifically identifies\nfive factors of partnership quality that determine the success\nof HR outsourcing, which is strengthened by the factors of\nservice quality. There has been no consensus on how service\nquality forms an HR outsourcing relationship. In this regard,\nthis study attempts to draw a consensus on recognizing those\nfactors of service quality that moderate the association\nbetween partnership quality and HR outsourcing success.\nThis study also offers useful guidelines for HR managers.\nIt is common to find that organizations outsource more than\none HR function and in fact most of them outsource training\nand recruitment functions. This finding indicates that HR\noutsourcing as a competitive strategy in Malaysia is still rela-\ntively new than other countries and probably many of its\npotential benefits are not fully understood. Therefore, by\nunderstanding the relationship with the service providers, the\norganizations are able to achieve outsourcing success by\nidentifying areas of expected benefits and improvements. It\nis important to understand the components of partnership\nquality to develop a solid relationship with the vendor, irre-\nspective of whether one specific HR function is outsourced\nor more and ultimately the most impact on HR outsourcing\nsuccess. Trust has been found to have the strongest impact\nand this finding suggests to managers that they can use trust\nas a foundation for successful outcomes in the outsourcing\nrelationship with their partners. Frequently, outsourcing\nstrategies are viewed negatively by the service receivers\nbecause of the fear of losing control over the process. It takes\ntime to build trust in a partnership. Therefore, initial trust\nwould be a qualitative attribute that managers should look\nfor in their selection of vendors for outsourcing. For organi-\nzations that are already practicing outsourcing, they should\nintegrate activities such as information exchange on long-\nrange plans, benefits and risk sharing, mutual problems, and\nknowledge sharing; all these activities can enhance the part-\nnership trust level and improve the working relationship.\nApart from that, organizations must also understand that\nthere should be an open and frequent communication\nbetween service providers and service receivers. This is\nbecause proper communication facilitates negotiation and\ntransfer of information and resolves possible conflicts in any\noutsourcing relationship. Managers should therefore insist\non timely and creditable communication channels. In addi-\ntion, organizations can have better understanding on how\nservice quality works in the HR outsourcing relationship.\nOverall, the elements of service quality only partially moder-\nate the relationship. Being sensitive and aware of the pres-\nence of service quality as moderators is important for service\nreceivers. This is because it may provide HR managers with\nsome subtle cues for selection and evaluation of the right\nservice providers in which the finding suggests that organi-\nzations should search for service providers with high levels\nof tangibles, responsiveness, and empathy.\nThis study also assists HR managers that business under-\nstanding should become an extension of a particular organi-\nzational work culture when they handle outsourced HR\nfunctions such as training, recruitment, employee records,\nand other functional tasks. In this matter, occasionally con-\nflict and disagreement in needs may hamper outsourcing\nsuccess. Consequently, understanding of roles and responsi-\nbilities of the service providers and service receivers is a cru-\ncial aspect of partnership quality that requires special\nmanagerial attention. Prior to entering a partnership, the\nbusiness mission of both parties needs to be properly under-\nstood. This could be achieved through having a set of\nassigned goals for each specific milestone in the relationship\nto serve as check points. Apart from that, it is not unusual to\nfind service providers competing among each other by imi-\ntating one another on the type of services offered. However,\nservice quality should also be a priority for service providers\nif they are to build a strong reputation for their organizations.\nThis is because customers evaluate services from a series of\njudgments over time. Superior quality will aid the reputation\nbuilding of service providers and it is not something that can\nbe replicated easily as it is an implicit knowledge and unique\nto a particular competitor.\nLimitation and Future Research\nFirst, the sample size is small due to the low response rate\nand time constraint. Obtaining more robust results would\nrequire a larger sample size. Second, in this study, one ques-\ntionnaire represents an organization, thus the person who\nfilled up the questionnaire may be biased and non-represen-\ntative. Next, limited numbers of similar research have been\ncarried out on this topic. Therefore, to overcome these limi-\ntations, this article includes literature review from other\nindustries mainly from the Information System (IS) and\nInformation Technology (IT) industry. Finally, the effect of\npartnership quality on HR outsourcing success of this study\nis limited to only manufacturing firms in Malaysia.\nMore researches can be conducted to examine the pro-\nposed model on HR outsourcing success. First, it would be\ninteresting to extend this research to, for example, service\nindustry to obtain more generalized findings to provide a bet-\nter understanding on the growing trend of HR outsourcing in\nMalaysia. Next, analysis of the relationship between partner-\nship quality and outsourcing success from the service pro-\nvider's perceptive would also provide a broader perspective.\nIt is also suggested that a longitudinal research be carried out\nto investigate the dynamic features of outsourcing partnership\nas it will provide a more robust result than a snapshot research.\nFinally, more variables could be examined as an extension to\nthis study. Other variables reflecting factors such as firm\nenvironment, strategic orientation, corporate philosophy, cul-\nture, and organizational practice could be included.\nConclusion\nIn a nutshell, it is essential to comprehend that the influence\nof partnership quality on HR outsourcing success is\nmoderated by the service quality. In this study, organizations\nshould realize that the success of HR outsourcing is very\nmuch dependent on their relationship with the service pro-\nviders, which take into account the significant factors such as\ntrust, business understanding, commitment, communication,\nand top management support. In addition, the impact of mod-\nerating factor that is service quality is equally essential to\nstrengthen the relationship between partnership and HR out-\nsourcing success. In light of the above, it was found that only\ntrust, business understanding, and communication have an\nimpact on HR outsourcing success, and service quality par-\ntially moderated these relationships. Therefore, it is antici-\npated that this research would be able to provide some\ninsights to the organizations pertaining to the partnership\nquality, service quality, and HR outsourcing success, while\noffering guidelines for organizations to plan accordingly in\nselecting the appropriate service providers.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research and/or authorship of this article: We would like to\nthank the Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) Research University\nReferences\nAbu-El Samen, A.
