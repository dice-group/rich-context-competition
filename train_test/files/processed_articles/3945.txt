In community-driven\ndevelopment, emphasis on \"local resource persons\" and \"community spokespersons\" has created new opportunities for\nbrokerage and patronage within some villages, which interact with existing forms of authority and community afforded by\ncaste identity and intra-caste headmanship. In this article, we study how these entangled cultures of caste and development\ntranslate into social network structures using data on friendship ties from a south Indian village. We find that although\ncaste continues to be important in shaping community structures and leadership in the village's network, its influence varies\nacross different communities. This fluidity of caste's influence on community network structures is argued to be the result\nof multiple distinct yet partially overlapping cultural-political forces, which include sharedness afforded by caste identity and\nnew forms of difference and inequality effected through rural development.\n",

These studies have viewed culture as norma-\ntive commitments to identities or worldviews and shared\nexpectations. Culture is also considered to be distinct and\nrelatively autonomous from social network structure that is\ndefined as \"influential and persistent sets of interrelation-\nVaisey & Lizardo, 2010). In the present article, we study the\ninfluence of culture on network structure by focusing on how\nthe entangled worlds of caste, tribe, and development shape\nsocial network structures in a south Indian village.\nIn this article, we conceptualize culture not only as a con-\nstellation of idioms derived from abstract value systems or\ndisembodied social norms, but also as the negotiation of\nthese idioms in everyday life. Thus, culture (as values or\nnorms) is enacted variably and fluidly in everyday practice\nof individuals and collectives. By being enacted in everyday\npractice, it becomes dynamic, material, and embodied. And,\nit is by becoming material and embodied, by being practised,\nthat culture shapes the composition and structure of social\nnetworks and forms the basis for the meanings (the nature of\ntrust, respect, friendship, love, etc.) that people attach to ties\nand transactions in a network (Fuhse, 2009). Therefore, net-\nworks are \"infused with--and help to shape--the norms and\nexpectations that define a local culture\" (Hanson & Blake,\nMuch network analytic work and related studies on social\nand institutional proximity have tended to view the \"cul-\ntural\" predominantly in terms of a \"sense of belonging,\" aris-\ning out of shared commitments and expectations (see, for\nVaisey & Lizardo, 2010). Such a view tends to take politics\nout of cultures by omitting central elements such as dissen-\nsus, exclusion, and domination. Thus, although cultural\n\"sharedness\" may be important, it is limited by (a) the lack of\nacceptance of dominant norms and worldviews by \"margin-\nalized\" or \"peripheral\" groups of people; (b) overlapping and\n1University of Sussex, Brighton, UK\n2Telecom Ecole de Management, Evry, France\nCorresponding Author:\nSaurabh Arora, Science Policy Research Unit, Jubilee Building, University\nof Sussex, Brighton, BN1 9SL, UK.\nEmail: s.arora@sussex.ac.uk\nCultures of Caste and Rural Development\nin the Social Network of a South Indian\nVillage\nSaurabh Arora1 and Bulat Sanditov2\n Keywords\nculture, network structure, homophily, rural development, community development, patronage, development brokerage,\nIndia\n2 SAGE Open\nmultiple identities held by people, only some of which may\nbe shared with others linked in dyads, triads, or larger com-\nponents in a network; and (c) relations of unequal power per-\nsisting \"between different `speakers'within the same cultural\nunderstanding of culture, we argue that network composition\nand structures (shaped by cultural patterns) are better viewed\nas expressions of sharedness and difference. People may\nroutinely form close social ties with others who share a nor-\nmative commitment to a cultural identity or worldview, but\nsuch expressions of homophily may be accompanied by het-\nerogeneity in terms of adherence to other identities and\nworldviews, as well as exclusion of those belonging to \"infe-\nrior\" identities.\nThe specific cultural idioms under our purview are those\nrelated to caste (community, hierarchy, leadership) and their\nentanglement with the culture of community-driven rural\ndevelopment (brokerage, patronage, constituency) in a south\nIndian village. Caste provides a particularly illustrative case\nof a cultural institution where sharedness and disparity (as\ndomination and inequality) co-exist with each other in a state\nof perpetual tension (Dumont, 1980). It is a \"live force in\nmodern Indian culture and politics\" (Satyanarayana, 2014, p.\n48), which exercises a powerful cultural influence on the\nIndian politico-economic order (Deshpande, 2001; Fuller,\nare considered central: It is a maker of (single caste) com-\nmunities, of inter-caste dominance and hierarchy laid down\nat birth, and of leadership within intra-caste communities in\nthe form of the caste headman. All three of these facets of\ncaste, by infusing everyday practice, influence the shaping of\nsocial networks.\nUnlike castes, India's indigenous tribes (Adivasi) have\nbeen argued to inhabit a non-stratified social order (Sarkar &\nDasgupta, 2007). Yet, like castes, tribal affiliation affords\ncommunity, identity, and leadership provided by (tribe) head-\nmen. This community andAdivasi identity is cemented by the\ngovernment category of Scheduled Tribe (ST), which is used\nas the basis of reservations for jobs and places in (educa-\ntional) institutions. Similar reservations are targeted at the\nDalits (or Scheduled Castes). Both Dalit and Adivasi groups\nhave historically suffered discrimination and exploitation at\nat many levels, Adivasis have been drawn into the caste sys-\ntem, \"becoming a part of the caste-based division of labour\"\nand\"mostusuallyatthebottomofthesocialladder\"(Agrawal,\nparticularly true in villages where Adivasis reside alongside\nother castes. For this reason, in the remainder of this article,\nwe will treat the tribal groups inhabiting the village under\nstudy in the same way as caste groups, while remaining cog-\nnizant of the potentially problematic nature of such a treat-\nment (see Baviskar, 2005, for an illustrative example).\nNow this culture of castes (and tribes) in rural India is\nentangled with the world of rural development. For example,\nthe entry of community development institutions with their\nemphasis on \"local resource persons\" and \"community\nspokespersons\" has created new opportunities for brokerage\nand patronage within villages, which intersect with the three\nfacets of caste discussed above. Our main objective in this\narticle therefore is to examine how entangled cultures of\ncaste and rural development get translated into community\nnetwork structure at the village level. We enact this in two\nsteps. First, using data on the social network of a multi-caste\nvillage in Andhra Pradesh (AP), we examine the caste com-\nposition of close-knit communities or clusters in the village's\nnetwork and ask to what extent development institutions\nmediate the relationship between caste identities and the net-\nworked communities observed. To delineate the clusters, we\nuse numerical methods for identifying community structure\nin networks developed by Newman (2006). Second, based\non qualitative information collected in the village, we ana-\nlyze how leaders of each cluster are able to act as local\npatrons, deriving their authority and legitimacy from caste\nheadmanship as well as development brokerage and patron-\nage. Through this study of the influence of caste identity,\nintra-caste leadership, and development patronage on peo-\nple's friendship networks in the village, our aim is to explain\nthe cultural underpinnings of emergent social network struc-\ntures. We find that development-induced brokerage and\npatronage, while often aligning with the three facets of caste\n(community, hierarchy, and leadership), have transformed\ncaste's influence on intra-caste and inter-caste ties, as well as\nreconstituted caste-based leadership.\nThe article is structured as follows. In the section \"Political\nCultures of Caste and Development in South India,\" we\nbriefly discuss the literature on post-colonial politics of caste\nat the village level in south India, which may foster caste-\nbased collective identity and community ties. In section \"The\nVillage and Its Social Network,\" we introduce the social\neconomy of the village under study and outline its caste com-\nposition. In section \"Results and Discussion,\" the results are\npresented and discussed, and a final section draws some\nconclusions.\nPolitical Cultures of Caste and\nDevelopment in South India\nRecent scholarship on caste has attempted to unpack the rela-\ntionship between two primary facets of caste--hierarchy and\ncommunity. Under the ethnicization that castes (and tribes)\nReddy, 2005), castes as \"ethnic groups don't just experience\nthe world in terms of `we-them relations,' but play a role in\nindividual castes increasingly portrayed themselves as ethnic\ngroups, claiming to possess a distinctive culture and \"way of\nlife\" (Fuller, 1996b). This ethnicization is argued to have pro-\nduced a weakening of the hierarchical aspects of the caste\nsystem, reducing it to a horizontal array of consolidated\nArora and Sanditov 3\ncastes (Fuller, 1996b), leading some to claim that the caste\nsystem has collapsed, only \"a plethora of assertive caste\nFurthermore, studies have highlighted the continued\nemancipation of the so-called \"lower\" castes in south India,\nwhich has brought about either a conscious rejection of dom-\ninant Hindu norms and worldviews and/or a strategic mobi-\nlization of alternate \"traditions\" that do not have their roots\nin mainstream Hinduism (see, for example, Ilaiah, 1996;\nclassic argument that lower caste groups accept their subor-\ndination because they share the \"value system of the upper\ncastes\" and replicate it among themselves (Still, 2009, p. 10),\nthe new understanding of caste brings relations of power, dif-\nference, and subversion of dominant value systems to the\ncenter. And perhaps to counter the widespread challenging\n(and purported weakening) of the caste system's hierarchical\norder, Hindu nationalist parties such as the Bharatiya Janata\nParty (BJP) and Shiv Sena have supported the reinstatement\nof caste system's hierarchical order since the 1980s (Mines,\nThese wider (national, regional) political processes of\ncaste consolidation and supposed weakening of inter-caste\nhierarchy influence caste cultures at the village level. People\nin villages selectively use their awareness of, and ties to,\nnational and regional political (and/or religious) movements\nin their local struggles for greater recognition and dignity\ngles for equality waged by Dalits in south Indian villages\n1996), often led by a new generation of young educated\nDalits rebelling against past atrocities committed by the\n\"upper\" castes (Satyanarayana, 2014).1 In fact, many new\nDalit (and other \"lower\" caste) leaders in south Indian rural\nand urban areas have attempted to reframe caste as an\nempowering identity, a source of pride, solidarity, and self-\nrespect (Satyanarayana, 2014). In response, the upper castes\nhave staged their own \"assertions of identity\" (Owens, 2000,\np. 704), by appropriating national and regional political\ndevelopments such as the rise of the BJP with its upper caste\nleadership and by directly competing (as a caste group) with\nthe lower castes for appropriating local and non-local\n2010). These different assertions of cultural (caste) identity\nat the village level may reinforce caste-based community ties\namong lower and upper castes.\nOften, these assertions of identity and consolidation of\ncaste community at the village level are enacted in a space\nthat is at the same time heavily shaped by development inter-\nventions. In particular, development projects specifically tar-\ngeted at the lower castes, or a legislation stipulating lower\ncaste political representation in village councils, may foster\nthe consolidation of local caste-based communities. To reach\nthe dispossessed through rural development, since the 1980s,\nnon-governmental organizations (NGOs), sometimes funded\nby European donor NGOs, began targeting their programs\ntoward specific development constituencies such as \"mar-\nginal farmers\" and \"landless labourers\" who often belonged\nto the lower castes (Mosse, 1999). Similarly, the 73rd consti-\n(GPs), or village councils, mandatory in all villages in India\n5-year terms, must be representative of the caste composition\n(share in local population) of a village.2 Caste differences\nand identity are mobilized at the local level in electing the\nmulti-caste GPs, despite the government's aim to diminish\ncaste differences by promoting decentralized democracy.\nThis mobilization of caste identity and difference for local\ngovernance may support the furthering of intra-caste ties.\nMulti-caste democratic governance in villages may also\ncreate spaces of deliberation (Rao & Sanyal, 2010), under\nwhich novel forms of cooperation must be sought among\nleaders of the different castes to use development funds for\nthe benefit of multiple castes in a village. In fact, caste may be\ndeployed \"as the basis for providing fairer entitlement and\nSuch caste-based negotiation for distribution of resources at\nthe village level may lead to a weakening of the hierarchical\norder of the local caste system, which may in turn assist in the\nformation of new inter-caste (friendship) relations. This out-\ncome does not obviously have to arise in all villages and\nbetween all castes. In her ethnography in an AP village, Still\n(2013) observes that although the hierarchical order may be\nweakening among the different non-Dalit castes, the divide\nbetween Dalits and the upper castes may at the same time be\ngetting sharper (often playing out in the form of the upper\ncastes' resentment against government reservations for Dalits\nas Scheduled Castes). This implies that inter-caste ties may be\nformed more easily between members of non-Dalit castes\nrather than between Dalits and non-Dalits.\nFurthermore, negotiations with other castes (including\nDalits) for making village-level governance decisions, rather\nthan involving all members of a caste, may primarily be carried\nout by the leaders of each caste group (Arora, 2009; Tanabe,\n2007). These leaders can be \"traditional\" caste headmen, if\nthey qualify to stand in the elections for GP membership.3 Or,\nthey may be the \"new leaders\" or GP members who are often\nelected with the support of the caste headmen. Together these\nnew and old leaders then act as \"gatekeepers\" between the vil-\nlagers and governmental (and/or non-governmental) institu-\ntions controlling the disbursal of development funds (Ananth\nPur & Moore, 2010).4 These leaders, often named as local\n\"resource persons\" in community-driven projects for poverty\nreduction (Prasad, Ramanjaneyulu, Ravindra, & Sanghi, 2008;\nSwaminathan & Jeyaranjan, 2008), may channel development\nfunds to \"their poor\" (Mosse, 1995). Through this, and by\nhelping to organize special favors for (some of) their \"group\",\nsuch as facilitation in finding jobs or admissions to educa-\ntional institutions through the development agencies, the lead-\ners may foster the formation of a tight-knit community of\n4 SAGE Open\nfollowers around them. Thus, by acting as their group's rep-\nresentatives in negotiating with outside governmental and\nnon-governmental agencies, these leaders help create loyalty\nand internal solidarity in their community/constituency.\nThrough such development-related patronage then, the local\nleaders gain honor and respect while material benefits flow\nto their community - constituency that may contain members\nbelonging to multiple castes (cf. Price, 2006).\nThe foregoing arguments may give the impression that\ncaste-based domination has now been decimated in south\nIndian villages. Unfortunately, this would still be an inaccurate\ndescription of caste culture in many villages. Although caste\ndomination may have weakened in some villages, Dalits and\nother lower castes may continue to be excluded from partici-\npating in actual GP-led governance, except in villages where\nthey are numerically dominant (Ananth Pur & Moore, 2010).\nAnd in villages where the president of the council is stipulated\nto be a Dalit (woman), upper castes either attempt to get a \"pli-\nable\" Dalit elected as the president or they may militate against\nher authority, often restricting her governance powers to token\nsignatures on official documents (Sivanna, 2014). Even in\nKerala which is hailed worldwide as a model of inclusive\ndevelopment, and where it was claimed that caste hierarchies\nhad been overcome as a result of land reforms and other pro-\ngressive policies of the ruling communist party since the\n1960s, caste's culture of inequality continues to hold sway in\nmany villages and material deprivation is rife among the lower\ncastes (Devika, 2013), as is their exclusion from processes of\nlocal governance beyond passive attendance when invited\n(Williams, Thampi, Narayana, Nandigama, & Bhattacharyya,\n2012). In addition, in most south Indian villages, a \"Dalit col-\nony\" continues to be located outside the boundaries of the main\nVincentnathan, 1996). This segregation is just one among\nmany manifestations of entrenched caste-based inequality that\ncontinues to plague villages in south (and north) India, which\nmay include lower agricultural wages for Dalit laborers, refusal\nof services to Dalits by barbers, association of Dalits with dirti-\nness and laziness, and denial of access to temples and burial\ncontinue to limit the formation of inter-caste friendship ties\n(especially between Dalits and non-Dalits).\nIn summary, the foregoing discussion has highlighted that\nalthough the hierarchical facets of the caste system may have\nweakened, they have not disappeared, and the importance of\ncaste as a cultural identity and forger of community ties\n(through solidarity and through leadership\u00adconstituency\nrelations) has only become stronger. We pointed to several\nfactors, related to the entangled cultures of caste and devel-\nopment in rural south India, which have acted as drivers of\ncommunity consolidation and of weakening hierarchy.\nAlthough these dynamics are likely to play out differently (to\nvarying degree and taking diverse trajectories) in different\nplaces, we expect that caste-based similarity and cultural\nsharedness may still drive the formation of densely con-\nnected intra-caste communities or clusters, while new inter-\ncaste (friendship) ties may be getting formed, mediated by\ndevelopment institutions and other cultural-political forces.\nIn the following, by identifying tight-knit clusters in the\nsocial network of a village in AP, we investigate to what\nextent this is the case and what different factors are at play in\nthe formation of the clusters.\nThe Village and Its Social Network\nThe village, Ananthagudem (a pseudonym), of approxi-\nmately 900 inhabitants is located in the Khammam district of\nAP. Of a total of 212 households, 155 are cultivating farmers;\ncultivated land leased from others (a few farmers with small\nlandholding also lease land). An overwhelming 86% of the\nfarmers are smallholders who own less than or equal to 2\nhectares of land. But there are a definitely a few large farm-\ners in the village which makes land distribution in the village\nhighly skewed (see Figure 1). Furthermore, the village is\ninhabited by 38 landless-laborer households. The remaining\nhouseholds are engaged in non-agricultural professions such\nas small shop owners in the village and construction work in\na nearby town.Asmall number of farmers also own shops for\nsupplementary income, or drive auto-rickshaw taxis in the\narea. The village is located 6 km from the nearest town, and\nthe closest industrial establishment is a thermal power plant\nwhere two villagers are employed.\nAnanthagudem has 10 caste groups. We have caste infor-\ntwo remaining households operate small shops in the village\nand do not own any land. The largest group (75 households)\nin Ananthagudem is the Hinduized Koya tribe (see von F\u00fcrer-\nHaimendorf, 1982, on detribalization or Hinduization of the\nKoyas). A comparable group in size is that of the peasant\ncaste, Yadava (62 households). The Lambadi (categorized as\nSTs in AP but as Scheduled Castes in Karnataka, Bokil, 2002;\nthey also have their own origin myths like other caste groups,\nKaramsi, 2010) and the Dalit Mala (categorized as Scheduled\nCastes) are the third and fourth largest groups, respectively.\nNo single group dominated clearly in numbers: The differ-\nence between the two largest groups is only 13. Neither was\nthere a domination of one group in economic power as mea-\nsured by total land area: The Koyas collectively own 154.4\nacres and the Yadavas own 155 acres.Although the amount of\nland owned per household is different for each caste, these\ninter-caste differences are not substantial.\nQuantitative (Network) and Qualitative Data\nQuantitative data on the social (friendship) networks of the\nvillagers at the level of individual households, and on some\nother socio-economic variables such as landownership, were\ngathered during fieldwork by the first author between\nArora and Sanditov 5\nwith a survey,5 we relied on an inhabitant of the village as the\nsource. The data on the social ties of some villagers were\ncross-checked through direct observation and interactions\nwith many farmers during several trips to the village over 8\nmonths. These direct observations and many conversations\nwith the farmers (and other inhabitants of the village) were\nalso used to collect qualitative data to appreciate how caste\nhas become entangled with the world of rural development.\nThe latter were essential to understand the development of\nnew forms of development-induced brokerage and patronage\nthrough which the village leaders are able to maintain their\nleadership and sustain their constituencies as communities.\nIn a classic review of empirical social network studies,\nMarsden (1990) points out that researchers have routinely\nused a variety of sources in collecting network data including\nthe approach used here. Our source for the data was a local\nNGO representative who had already lived in the village and\nworked closely with the farmers for 3 years when our field-\nwork was initiated. Sociality or friendship was identified on\nthree criteria: the two friends inter-dine, they freely provide\nhelp to each other in times of need, and they celebrate (at\nleast some of the) local festivals together. Two friends could\nbe, and often indeed are, kin. In addition, the NGO worker\nwas requested to ensure that any two friends identified by her\nshould be close to each other (we used the Telugu word\ndaghr). It was implied that two daghr friends, depicted as a\ndyad in the network, will not in general act against each oth-\ner's interests. Note that this daghr-ness in social ties does not\nTable 1. Caste and Land Distribution in Ananthagudem.\nCaste\nNumber of\nhouseholds\nTotal land\nowned (acres)\nAverage per\nhousehold\n(acres)\nFigure 1. Distribution of land in acres.\nNote. Top: Land owned by a farmer; Bottom: Land cultivated by a farmer.\n6 SAGE Open\nexclude relationships in which honor and mutual respect\n(though not always symmetrically) may be exchanged.\nThe social network of the village is shown in Figure 2.\nDifferent shapes represent different castes. Some basic\ndescriptive statistics of the network are shown in Table 2. The\nstatistics of the network, such as the average number of links\nper node in the network or mean degree (z) and the average\ndistance of one node from another in the main connected\ncomponent of the network (l), generally fall in the range of\nthe statistics for other commonly studied social networks (see\nTable 2). Interestingly, Ananthagudem's social network is\n(slightly) disassortative, that is, individuals with few links are\nlikely to be connected to counterparts with many connections.\nBecause the number of social ties often reflects the social sta-\ntus of an individual, negative assortative mixing coefficient\nmay indicate the prevalence of \"patron\u00adclient\" or \"leader-\nship\u00adconstituency\" type relationships in the social network.\nMethod for Identifying Tight-Knit Structures\nAs tight-knit groups (or clusters) are not directly observable,\none needs to employ data on the network of social relation-\nships to identify clusters. Clustering implies that relation-\nships between members of the same cluster are more\nnumerous than inter-cluster links. A community structure\nmethod is then used to identify the emergent clusters from\nobserved social network data. We use a modularity-based\nleading eigenvector method developed by Newman (2006).\nHere, we briefly outline the algorithmic procedure used;\nfor additional details, we refer to the original article (Newman,\n2006). For the null model, we pick a random graph with the\nsame degree distribution as Ananthagudem's social network.\nNow, for any partition of the network into different clusters,\nmodularity is defined as the difference between the number\nof edges within identified clusters and the \"expected\" num-\nber of such edges (\"expected\" refers to the null model). Thus,\nthe modularity value is a measure of the advantage derived\nfrom describing an observed network in terms of clusters, as\ncompared with the baseline model of random connections.\nWe begin by partitioning the network into two sub-net-\nworks (or clusters) such that this particular partition maxi-\nmizes the modularity (Newman, 2006). Following this,\npartitioning the network into more than two clusters is\nachieved through sequential application of the algorithm to\nthe two sub-networks, each of which is bisected. If a pro-\nposed bisection of a sub-network does not yield a gain in\noverall modularity value, it is an indivisible cluster and no\nfurther divisions of this sub-network should be made. We\nstop when no divisible sub-network remains. The resulting\nset of indivisible clusters defines a partition with approxi-\nmately the maximized modularity value.\nNewman (2006) proposes to complement each step of the\nabove procedure with a \"fine-tuning\" routine. According to\nthis, after initial separation of nodes into two clusters (and\nindeed after each subsequent bisection), the following steps\nshould be performed. First, we find a node which if moved to\nthe other cluster would yield the largest gain, or the smallest\nloss, in modularity. Second, we move such a node to the\nother cluster. Third, we repeat the first step considering only\nthose vertices that have not been moved yet, from both clus-\nters. Once a move for all vertices has been attempted, we\ninspect the configurations of possible moves to select only\nthe configuration that provides the largest gain in modularity,\nand run the procedure from the beginning again until it gives\nno further improvements in modularity. The end result of this\nfine-tuning procedure is a gain in modularity and the modu-\nlarity value is maximized.\nResults and Discussion\nThe dispersion of each caste across 13 identified clusters\n(labeled A-L) is shown in Table 3. Members of the largest\ngroup, Koya, can be found in 9 clusters. Three of the clusters\nof the village's Koya population, respectively. The Yadavas\nare also dispersed across 9 clusters, but slightly more than\nhalf of the village's Yadavas are members of Clusters A and\nF (24% and 27%, respectively). The Lambadis are present in\nThe other mid-sized caste group of Malas (with 14 members)\njoin Cluster H without splitting. Members of the smaller\ncastes of the village (with 10 or fewer members) are gener-\nally split across 2 clusters.\nThe caste composition of each cluster is shown in Table 4.\nThe largest clusters, A and B have 25 people belonging to\nfour different castes in each case. Apart from the 3 Koya-\nonly clusters (C, E, and M), 2 other clusters (F and H) are\npredominantly single caste, with more than 90% of their\nFigure 2.

Thus, 8 of 13\nclusters in Ananthagudem are clearly multi-caste, constituted\nby members of two to five different castes. It is however\nimportant to note that in all but 2 of these multi-caste clus-\nters, a single caste provides the majority (more than 50%) of\nmembers. Only in Clusters D and G no single caste consti-\ntutes a clear majority.\nIn most clusters, caste appears to play an important role in\nshaping the emergent network structure. Barring two clusters\n(D and G), the majority of each cluster's members belong to\na single caste. Yet, the effect of caste on community ties\nTable 3.

Klass, 1972;\n(or another factor) is more important in driving peoples'\ncommunity tie formation, we would observe single-caste\nclusters simply because members of the same lineage belong\nto the same caste. In the following statistical exercise, we\nillustrate this point by disentangling the effects of caste and\nlineage.\nWe examine the effects of the two factors by estimating a\nsimple alternative-specific conditional logit model: For each\nindividual household, we estimate the effect of caste and lin-\neage on the probability that it joins 1 of the 13 identified\nclusters. The dependent variable yij\nis equal to 1 if individual\nbelongs to cluster, and 0 otherwise.6 The results of estimation\nare reported in Table 5 (cluster dummies reflect the effect of\ncluster sizes and composition of the clusters are not reported).\nFirst, we estimated a model with CASTE covariate and clus-\nter-specific constants (Model 1). The results confirm that\ncaste is an important factor in defining the composition of\nclusters. Then we estimated a model with CASTE, FAMILY,\nand cluster dummies (Model 2). Introduction of the lineage\neffect largely moderates the coefficient of CASTE and\nslightly reduces its statistical significance (its p value\nbecomes .003). It also significantly improves the overall fit\nof the model almost doubling the pseudo-R2 statistics. Thus,\nthe results suggest that lineage has a much stronger influence\non the formation of clusters than caste.\nMoving on to caste's entanglement with the political cul-\nture of rural development, in village-level forums such as the\nGP, interests of large castes, due to their sheer size and inter-\nnal diversity, may not be easily represented by a single-caste\nheadman (cf. Oommen, 1970). Such large caste groups gener-\nally include members of different lineages. They also have a\nrange of agriculturalists, from mid-sized farmers to the land-\nless, whose (economic) interests may diverge from each\none can expect a general loss of internal cohesion with growth\nin size of a group because norms (that may drive cohesion,\nfor instance, through loyalty to headmen) in large groups\ntend to become more impersonal and often unsuitable to the\nneeds of all. Correspondingly in the results, shown in Table\n3,weobservethatthetwolargecastegroupsinAnanthagudem,\nYadava and Koya, are distributed across multiple clusters.\nWe observe a lower degree of dispersion in the two mid-\nsized caste groups in Ananthagudem, Lambadi and Mala\nwith 28 and 14 members, respectively. The Dalit Mala's alto-\ngether join Cluster H, a result that supports Still's (2013)\nobservation in the AP village she studied that inter-caste ties\nmay be formed more easily between members of non-Dalit\ncastes rather than between Dalits and non-Dalits.\nAnanthagudem's Cluster H has only one non-Mala member,\nwho shares the same occupation, auto-rickshaw driver, with\nat least two Mala men.7 He also lives in the same neighbor-\nhood as the Malas. Overall, Mala is the only caste group in\nAnanthagudem with almost the same boundaries as a cluster.\nMajor reasons for this cohesion among the Malas are as fol-\nlows: (a) almost all Malas in Ananthagudem belong to a\nsingle lineage, (b) they are recipients of specifically targeted\nstate development programs that are exclusive to them in\nAnanthagudem (one such successful program implemented\nduring the time of our fieldwork was mulberry cultivation for\nsilkworms and fruit), (c) Malas as Dalits have been widely\npersecuted by the upper castes in AP and often follow their\nown (non-upper caste) cultural value systems, and (d) effec-\ntive leadership from the caste headman who is a highly\nrespected member of many village-level committees includ-\ning the GP. More on leadership will be discussed later.\nThe Lambadis are concentrated in two clusters: 22 in B\nand 3 in L. In both clusters, they form community ties with\nmembers of other castes living in their neighborhood (3 in\nCluster B and 5 in Cluster L). Many Lambadis generally\nworked closely with the development NGO working in the\nvillage, which seems to be a driving factor in cluster forma-\ntion. For instance, in Cluster L, two people (the Lambadi\ncaste headman and a Yadava) are both \"resource persons\" of\nthe NGO in the village. The resource persons play a critical\nrole in mobilizing people for the NGO's development proj-\nects and distributing project benefits among the villagers\n(more on this later). Similar close affiliation to the NGO can\nbe observed in the larger Lambadi-dominated Cluster B, one\nof whose members is in fact the only NGO employee living\nin the village.\nThe smaller caste groups (Mudiraj, Potter/Carpenter,\nGoud, Dudekula except Choudhary) split up and join two\ndifferent clusters. Most small caste groups are perhaps not\n(numerically) strong enough to prop their own leaders at the\nvillage level. In general, one or two members of each of these\ncastes do not stick with the rest of their caste group in joining\na larger cluster. For example, six of seven members of Potter/\nCarpenter caste are in Cluster D whereas the last one is in\nCluster F. The only small caste group that does not get split\nacross two clusters is Choudhary. All three members of this\nTable 5. The Effects of Caste and Lineage: Alternative-Specific\nConditional Logit Model.\nNote. All estimated coefficients are significant at 1% level. Standard errors\nare in parenthesis.\naSignificant at 1% level.\nbCalculated using log likelihood for intercepts-only model,\nL\nArora and Sanditov 9\ncaste are present in Cluster A. The headman of the\nChoudharys, despite their small numerical strength, is argu-\nably the most influential individual in the village. He is an\nimportant dairy farmer, which is one of the more profitable\nprofessions in Ananthagudem. In addition, he cultivated 13\nclose to the main crop-buyer, credit-provider, and farm-input\nsupplier to Ananthagudem, and to the GP president (also a\nmember of Cluster A). In fact, Cluster A is home to some\nother prominent people in the village, including the headman\nof the Yadavas,8 and a local moneylender who is also a GP\nmember. Both also work as resource persons for the local\nNGO. Thus, Cluster A is the closest we find to a core cluster,\nor \"power center,\" in Ananthagudem's social network. It also\nhas the highest group (closeness and degree) centrality val-\nues of all clusters, as shown in Table 6.9 However, note that\nthe coreness of Cluster A, or its position as the center of\nAnanthagudem, is quite weak as a number of other powerful\nindividuals are dispersed across different clusters. Thus,\n(important) members of the core Cluster A cannot indepen-\ndently make decisions for the entire village without consult-\ning other cluster leaders.\nThe above result on the lack of a clearly dominant cluster\nin Ananthagudem's social network can be confirmed by\ncomparing the average landownership in each cluster. As the\ndistribution of land in the village is not normal (Figure 1), we\ntested the averages using Kruskal\u00adWallis test (a non-para-\nmetric analogue to one-way ANOVA). The results of the test\nare reported in Table 7. The null hypothesis of the means\nbeing equal across the clusters for both owned and cultivated\nland cannot be rejected; thus, there is no evidence that some\nclusters are definitely more important or powerful than oth-\ners. This confirms that powerful individuals (large farmers)\nin the village do not form an elite clique on their own. It also\nimplies that no \"rural or agrarian rich layer\" is dominating in\nthe village, exploiting other poorer villagers and exclusively\nprotecting their own interests.\nUntil now, we have focused on how caste (and lineage)\nidentities, moderated by the size of a caste group, influence\nthe cluster structure of the social network. This quantitative\nanalysis has thus focused on the extent to which caste- and\nlineage-based homophily manifests in Ananthagudem's net-\nwork. While pointing to this influence of homophily, we\nhave remained alert to heterogeneity within individual tight-\nknit clusters. However, to fully appreciate the manifestation\nof heterogeneity in the clusters, we need to adopt a (largely)\nqualitative approach in the following. Quantitative social\nnetwork analysis is still used to identify the leaders in every\ncluster. For each leader, we discuss their attributes (caste sta-\ntus, formal office, landholdings, etc.) that place them in a\nposition to act as patrons of their constituencies. In addition,\nwe attempt to understand who is included and who gets\nexcluded from overall leadership at the village level. The\nleaders are identified using measures of intra-cluster influ-\nence and decision-making power (estimated using closeness\ncentrality within her/his cluster/constituency) and the poten-\ntial to negotiate with other clusters due to her/his position in\nthe network (inter-clique betweenness measure developed by\nFor each cluster, individuals with the highest values of the\nproduct of the two measures are listed in Table 8.10 We iden-\ntify one leader per cluster. In general, these leaders have sub-\nstantially higher values of the product than the rest of the\ncluster. A complete list of all individuals with non-zero val-\nues, that is, individuals who have at least one link to someone\noutside their own cluster, is available on request from the\nauthors.\nThe leader of ClusterAis the headman of the Choudharys.\nThe influence of this large cultivator and dairy farmer is far\ngreater than is reflected by the small size of his caste group\nin the village. As already noted, he runs a profitable dairy\nbusiness, supplying milk to buyers outside Ananthagudem.\nHis influence also stems from his closeness to the main farm-\ninput (pesticides, fertilizers, seeds) supplier to the village.\nThis farm-input supplier runs a shop in the nearby town and\nis the only such shop owner in town who provides the farm\ninputs on credit to the Ananthagudem farmers. He is also the\nsingle most important source of agricultural knowledge for\nthe village's farmers. The leader of Cluster A is himself also\na central source of agricultural knowledge and problem-\nsolving advice in the village (Arora, 2012). In addition to his\nlocal socio-economic and cognitive position, influence from\nthe statewide clout of the Choudhary caste may be an impor-\ntant factor in buttressing his prominence in Ananthagudem.11\nThe leader of the Lambadi-dominated Cluster B is son of a\nlocal (Lambadi) moneylender who lends small amounts to other\nLambadis as well as members of other castes in the village. In\nTable 6. Cluster (Group) Centrality Values.\nCluster A B C D E F G H I J K L M\nTable 7. Kruskal\u00adWallis Test for the Average Landholding in\nClusters.\nLand owned Land cultivated\naddition, he was actively involved in the developmental\nwork of the local NGO, as were many other Lambadis to\nwhom he was connected, particularly in relation to sustain-\nable agriculture. Sustainable agriculture was the most impor-\ntant work carried out by the NGO in the village, for which\nAnanthagudem had become famous all across AP as an eco-\nvillage. It was widely reported that the local farmers were\nvery successful in adopting and adapting low-cost environ-\nmentally friendly agricultural practices (Arora, 2012). The\nleader of Cluster B was one of the farmers at the forefront of\nthis sustainable agriculture movement. The potential of the\nleader of Cluster C to act as patron of his constituency is less\nclear on any developmental grounds. His identification as the\ncluster leader here appears to depend on his membership of\none of two largest lineages, Palam with 13 households in\nAnanthagudem. Cluster C is composed of Koyas only.\nThe leader of Cluster D is the Dudekula caste headman. In\naddition to being a farmer, he owns a successful shop in the\nvillage, from which he also carries out small repairs (often\nfree of cost). He is possibly the only trained electrician in the\nvillage, which puts him much in demand for solving electric-\nity-related problems that villagers may encounter. He also\nundertakes electric jobs outside the village. He has friend-\nship ties with a number of other prominent villagers, includ-\ning the village GP president. And, like the leader of Cluster\nA, he is a close friend of the powerful farm-input supplier to\nthe village, which puts him in a good position for providing\nindirect patronage to other members of his cluster.\nThe Koya-only Cluster E is led by the head of the large\n(13-member) Velu lineage. The leader of this cluster is the\nsecretary of the GP and a \"resource person\" for the local\nNGO. Although he owns only 2 acres of land, he leases\nanother 10, which is the largest amount of land leased by\nanyone in Ananthagudem. Cultivating these 12 acres and\nbeing an NGO \"resource person\" allows him to act as a\ndevelopment broker between the farmers in his cluster and\nthe local NGO. Cluster F is led by a member of eight-strong\nDatla lineage (Yadava), whose potential for patronage is\nunclear.\nCluster G is led by a prominent farmer who doubles as a\nmoneylender in the village, which clearly puts him in good\nstead to act as a patron in his community. This role is\ncemented by his position as a local official (secretary) in the\nVillage Tribal Development Authority (VTDA). The VTDA\ngenerally channels government resources targeted at tribal\ngroups (e.g., Koya). These development funds may be used\nto strengthen local education, health, irrigation infrastruc-\nture, and women's savings groups. In this cluster leader's\ncase then, it is not brokerage between the development NGO\nand members of his cluster that affords his leadership and\ninfluence, but rather that between a government agency and\nthe (tribal) villagers.\nCluster H is led by the highly respected Mala headman.\nThis headman is an active member of many village-level\ncommittees including the GP and a farmers' consultation\ngroup on sustainable agriculture (and micro-credit) orga-\nnized by the local NGO. He is also a resource person of the\nlocal NGO. Membership of the GP and proximity to the local\nNGO allows him to act as a patron for members of his clus-\nter, which includes all members of his caste in the village. In\nfact, the Mala headman (and his cluster) exemplifies the\nalignment of the caste's facet of intra-caste leadership (and\ncommunity/constituency) with development-based broker-\nage (and patronage).\nCluster I is headed by a younger brother of the caste head-\nman of the Koyas (the latter himself leads Cluster K). The\nleader of Cluster I owns the largest amount of land in the\nVeena lineage and his landholding is the third largest among\nthe Koyas. Barring two, all members of this cluster are Koya.\nCluster J is led by the Goud registered medical practitioner in\nthe village. In addition to his medical practice, which attracts\npatients from all castes in the village, he runs a profitable\nTable 8. Leaders in Each Cluster.\nName Cluster (size, # castes) Caste In cluster closeness\nInter-cluster\nbetweenness Product\nArora and Sanditov 11\ndairy business and often acts as a veterinarian for the vil-\nlage's cattle. He has friendship ties with the GP president and\nsome other prominent people in the village.\nThe eight-member Clusters K and L are led by the head-\nmen of the Koya and the Lambadi, respectively. Both head-\nmen are resource persons for the local NGO and members of\nthe farmers' consultation group on sustainable agriculture.\nAs headmen, they are responsible for settling intra-personal\ndisputes in the village. The Lambadi headman is perhaps the\nmost important resource person for the local NGO in the vil-\nlage. He has been instrumental in securing small loans,\nthrough the NGO, for promoting non-farm entrepreneurial\nactivities in the village and helped initiate other projects\nincluding assistance with the local primary school and live-\nstock health. He has traveled to different parts of AP as an\nadvocate of low-cost sustainable agriculture practices pro-\nmoted by the NGO. Thus, the Lambadi headman is the per-\nfect broker who appears loyal to the NGO and its development\nprojects, while attempting to strategically secure benefits for\nthe poorer members of his cluster/constituency (and beyond\nthrough collaboration with other cluster leaders). He is con-\nsidered to be an expert in sustainable agricultural methods,\nand approached by many farmers for advice. He is also a\nland-sale administrator in Ananthagudem.\nFinally, the smallest Cluster M is a Koya-only cluster led\nby the head of the 11-household Sapna lineage, which is the\nthird largest lineage group in the village. The Sapna leader\nhas the largest landholding in his lineage, which is second\nonly to the GP president among the Ananthagudem Koya as\na whole. In addition to being a moneylender in the village, he\nis also a resource person for the local development NGO and\nconsidered knowledgeable in sustainable farming methods\nintroduced by the NGO.\nThus, leadership in most clusters is associated with char-\nacteristics such as landownership, ability or propensity to\nlend money, caste headmanship, agricultural expertise, and\nthe ability to act as a development broker between govern-\nmental organizations and NGOs and the village. The latter\nrole of mediation between development agencies and the vil-\nlagers is facilitated by membership in village-level councils\nand committees such as the GP, and serving as \"resource per-\nsons\" for the local NGO. In this way, the leaders are able to\nplay the role of local village-level patrons who may secure\nresources for their constituencies in the form of loans, subsi-\ndies, participation in sustainable development projects, and\nknowledge (technical advice). In addition, the leaders pro-\nvide voice to, and further the interests of, the poorer mem-\nbers of their constituencies or clusters in village-level forums\non the organization of local development. Of course, not all\ncluster leaders were in a straightforward position to act as\npatrons or powerful enough to provide a voice to their cluster\nmembers. This applies particularly to leaders of Clusters C\nand F (H. V. Palam and B. S. Datla). Members of the Palam\nand Datla lineages, including the leaders of Clusters C and F,\nare among the poorest in Ananthagudem with little or no\nlandholding. They also did not have direct access to the local\nNGO or any other development agencies (state or non-state)\nfrom outside the village. Thus, their ability to act as cluster\nleaders is unclear.\nConclusion\nIn this article, we have attempted to study how caste cultures\nand development brokerage/patronage interact with and\nadjust to each other in fluidly shaping the social network\nstructure of a south Indian village. We studied the latter by\ndividing the social network of the village into 13 tight-knit\nclusters. While the importance of caste as community and of\nintra-caste leadership can be observed in the composition of\nsome network clusters, more than half the clusters in the net-\nwork were clearly multi-caste. Only one caste group came\nclose to forming a cluster of their own (the Dalit Mala). The\nlargest group in the village, Koyas, was split across 9 clus-\nters, but 3 of these clusters were Koya only. All other caste\ngroups were split across multi-caste clusters and routinely\nformed friendship ties with members of other castes in the\nvillage. Thus friendship ties and communities in general, as\nobserved in this south Indian village, are not strictly divided\nalong caste lines, and the influence of caste on community\nnetwork structures (while clearly important) appears to be\nboth variable and fluid.\nEven where the influence of caste identity on network\nstructure appears important, it may be masking other drivers\nof cluster formation such as family, lineage, and shared occu-\npation. In addition, homophily, observed in (some of) the\nclusters through caste affiliation and other forms of shared-\nness through lineage or occupation, co-exists with consider-\nable heterogeneity among cluster members arising out of\nclose association with development organizations and/or\nexpressed through unequal relations of power operating in\npatron\u00adclient networks. Thus, network communities or clus-\nters are formed and sustained not only on the basis of some\nform of cultural sharedness (e.g., proximity through caste or\nlineage) but also on the basis of forms of heterogeneity due\nto newer distinctions and leadership (e.g., derived through\nproximity to development institutions) and emerging param-\neters of patronage.\nThe sources of individual leadership, and of friendship\nties between some of the cluster leaders, in the village are\ngenerally multiple. Leadership is derived, for instance, on\nthe basis of development brokerage and patronage, caste\nheadmanship, lineage, occupation, expertise, landownership,\nand the ability to act as local creditors. Thus, while owner-\nship of large parcels of land and concomitant class interests\nare important, caste and lineage continue to act as strong\nsources of leadership, as do new forms of patronage arising\nout of proximity to development institutions. And, although\nthere may be some overlap between these sources, none of\nthem can be viewed as a handmaiden to others. In this sense\nthen, caste (or community-based development) is not simply\na tool that is instrumentally deployed by the rural rich to fur-\nther their class interests. Caste, as we have documented\nabove, also forms a basis of convivial community ties and,\nas documented extensively in the anthropological literature\non caste (see section \"Political Cultures of Caste and\nDevelopment in South India\"), helps constitute struggles for\nequality waged by the oppressed and marginalized in Indian\nsociety. And, these struggles and communities (as constitu-\nencies) may produce their own leaders whose actions cannot\nsimply be reduced to their own class interests. Thus, no sin-\ngle source of leadership is subservient to and subsumed by\nanother. Yet, these distributed sources of leadership and the\npresence of patron\u00adclient type of relations within network\nclusters nevertheless imply that most cluster leaders (acting\nas patrons) had an interest in affording the creation of close-\nknit communities out of their constituencies (or clients).\nThis brings us to the observation that cultures are better\nenvisioned as multidimensional and shifting landscapes that\nare thoroughly embedded in everyday relations, rather than\nas (normative) structures that operate from above (or behind\nthe back of) individuals and communities (cf. Latour, 2005).\nIt is within everyday practice that \"traditional\" idioms such\nas those of caste (with their individual and collective aspects)\nare fluidly enacted and become entangled with newer institu-\ntional patterns. It is within the everyday that older sources of\nstatus and power are negotiated with and become enmeshed\nwith newer bases of authority, to constitute a cultural patch-\nwork that is riddled with inequality and difference. In this\narticle, we have attempted to show how this uneven patch-\nwork of \"tradition\" and \"modernity\" shapes social networks,\nnot solely through the sharedness of norms and values but\nalso through asymmetric power and authority.\n"
