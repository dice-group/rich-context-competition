The intervention was\ndesigned to affect various mediators at 30 days postintervention, including risky\nrelationship thoughts, beliefs, and attitudes, which were then hypothesized to af-\nfect engagement in risky sexual behaviors, such as unprotected sex, at 90 days\npostintervention.\nb Results: Using propensity score weighting, we found the intervention resulted in a sig-\nnificant decrease in risky relationship thoughts (j0.529, p = .03) and risky relationship\nthoughts resulted in an increase in unprotected sex (0.447, p G .001). However, the\ndirect effect of the intervention on unprotected sex was not significant (0.388, p = .479).\nb Discussion: By reducing bias, propensity score models improve the accuracy of sta-\ntistical analysis of interventions with mediators and allow researchers to determine not\nonly whether their intervention works but also how it works.\nb Key Words: causal inference & incarcerated women & potential outcomes framework\nMediators, also known as medi-\nating variables, play a signifi-\ncant role in most models of behavioral\nintervention.

Much\nhas been written in the statistics and ep-\nidemiology literature about the various\napproaches to assessing mediation, but\nthere are very few published applica-\ntions of these approaches and, to our\nknowledge, no published applications\nin the nursing research literature.\nMotivating Example\nAfter three decades, the persistence of\nthe HIV/AIDS epidemic in the United\nStates requires sustained attention. Dis-\ntinct subgroups are infected dispropor-\ntionately with HIV, such as individuals\nwho enter the criminal justice system,\nespecially women, with three to four\ntimes greater infection rates than the\nThe risk factors underlying the dis-\nproportionate HIV rates among incar-\ncerated women include exchange of sex\nfor drugs or money, having a high-risk\nsexual partner, inconsistent condom use,\nand use of drugs or other substances\n(Cotton-Oldenburg, Jordan, Martin,\nat greater frequency than in the gen-\neral population. The underlying causes\nfor greater frequency of these risk fac-\ntors is not clear, but it is important to\nintervene with this population because\nmany incarcerated women return to the\nsame behaviors, relationships, and fi-\nnancial context upon release (Adams\nventions have focused on this popula-\nTo fill in the gap in the literature,\nthe Reducing Risky Relationships-HIV\n(RRR-HIV) intervention, as part of the\nCriminal Justice Drug Abuse Treatment\nStudies cooperative agreement (Fletcher\nloted, and tested among incarcerated\nwas designed to address the context\nof a relationship and to change risky\nrelationship thoughts with the aim of de-\ncreasing risky sex after release (Staton-\nTindall et al., 2007). Risky relationship\nthoughts mediate the effect of the inter-\nvention on risky sexual behavior. That\nis, the intervention was hypothesized\nto change risky relationship thoughts,\nwhich in turn were hypothesized to\nchange risky sexual behaviors. These\neffects are denoted with \"1\n, re-\nspectively, in Figure 1. Also illustrated\nin Figure 1 is the direct effect, \"3\n; that is,\nthe effect of the intervention on risky\nsexual behavior that is not due to risky\nrelationship thoughts.\nPotential Outcomes Framework\nfor Causal Inference\nIn the potential outcomes framework\npotential outcome for each possible\ntreatment condition. For simplicity,\nconsider a binary treatment indicator,\nTi\n, wherein Ti\n= 1 denotes the inter-\nvention condition and Ti\n= 0 denotes\nthe control condition for participant i,\ni = 1,I,n. In this case, there are two\npotential outcomes for each individ-\nual: the potential outcome if the indi-\nvidual receives the intervention, denoted\nYi\n(1), and the potential outcome if the\nindividual is in the control condition,\ndenoted Yi\n(0). The individual causal ef-\nfect is the difference between these two\npotential outcomes. Because each partic-\nipant is observed in only one of these\nconditions, only one potential outcome\nis observed; the other potential outcome\nis missing, and therefore, the individual\ncausal effect cannot be computed. How-\never, strategies have been implemented\nto estimate the causal effect averaged\nover participants in the study, called the\naverage causal effect. The average causal\neffect is defined as E[Yi\n(0)]; that\nis, the expected (or average) difference\nbetween the two potential outcomes.\nIntroductions to the potential outcomes\nframework outside the mediation con-\ntext are provided by Little and Rubin\nA mediator is an outcome assessed\nwithin the context of the intervention,\nand therefore, there are also potential\nvalues for the mediator under each in-\ntervention condition for each individ-\nual: the potential value of the mediator\nunder the intervention condition, de-\nnoted Mi\n(1), and the potential value of\nthe mediator under the control condi-\ntion, denoted Mi\n(0). The potential val-\nues for the outcome are then expanded\nto include potential values of the me-\ndiator. Thus, Yi\n(1)) is the poten-\ntial outcome if individual i receives the\nintervention, and Yi\n(0)) is the po-\ntential outcome if individual i is in the\ncontrol condition. As before, only one\nof these two potential outcomes is ob-\nserved for each individual.\nThroughout this article, Yi\ndenotes\nthe observed value of unprotected sex\n(operationalized in this study as having\nhad at least one sexual encounter with-\nout a condom in the previous 30 days),\nMi\ndenotes the observed value for risky\nrelationship thoughts, and Yi\n(ti\n,Mi\n(ti\n))\nFIGURE 1.

It\nis assumed throughout that if an indi-\nvidual receives the intervention, then\nYi\n= Yi\n(1)) and Mi\n= Mi\nLikewise, if an individual is in the con-\ntrol condition, then Yi\n= Yi\nYi\n(0)) and Mi\n= Mi\n(0). This usually\nis referred to as the consistency assump-\ntion. Also implicit in this notation is that\nthere is no interference among individ-\nuals, because the potential outcomes\nare a function of only Ti\nand not Tj\n,\nwherein i and j denote two different\nindividuals. In other words, an individ-\nual's outcome does not depend on an-\nother individual's treatment assignment.\nThroughout this article, this noninter-\nference is assumed.\nUsing the Potential Outcomes\nFramework to Define Mediation Effects\nThree different definitions of mediation\nusing the potential outcomes framework\nhave been introduced in the statistics lit-\nerature: principal strata effects, natural\neffects, and controlled effects. The focus\nhere is on controlled effects, first intro-\nIn the motivating example, the con-\ntrolled direct effect is the causal effect\nof the RRR-HIV intervention on un-\nprotected sex when risky relationship\nthoughts is set (i.e., held constant) to a\nspecific value, m, for the entire pop-\nulation. That is, E[Yi\n(1,m) j Yi\nwherein Yi\n(t,m) is the potential out-\ncome when Ti\n= ti\nand Mi\n(ti\n) = m. For\nthe controlled direct effect, the media-\ntor is set to the same value for every\nindividual. Also for a binary interven-\ntion, such as RRR-HIV, there are as\nmany controlled direct effects as there\nare possible values of the mediator. If\nthe controlled direct effects are differ-\nent across levels of the mediator, it\nimplies that there is an interaction be-\ntween the intervention and the media-\ntor. If the controlled direct effects are\nequal across levels of the mediator, it\nimplies that there is no interaction be-\ntween the intervention and mediator.\nNext, consider defining the effect\nE[Yi\n(1,m) j Yi\n(1,m\u00b6)] for two different\nvalues of m and m\u00b6. This is the effect\nof, for example, a one-unit change in\nrisky relationship thoughts on unpro-\ntected sex when Ti\n= 1. Similarly, the\ndifference E[Yi\n(0,m) j Yi\n(0,m\u00b6)] defines\nthe effect of a one-unit change in risky\nrelationship thoughts on unprotected sex\nwhen Ti\n= 0. These differences define\nthe effect of risky relationship thoughts\non unprotected sex at each level of the\nintervention. The effect of the interven-\ntion on risky relationship thoughts is\ndefined as E[Mi\n(0)]. Finally, if\nthere is no interaction between the in-\ntervention and mediator, such that there\nis only one controlled direct effect, the\ncontrolled direct effect may be subtracted\nfrom the total effect to obtain the in-\ndirect effect. The total effect is defined\nas the effect of the intervention on un-\nprotected sex, E[Yi\nIdentification and Estimation\nAssumptions Much less attention has\nbeen given to estimating mediation via\ncontrolled effects than via natural ef-\nfects or principal strata effects. How-\never, as discussed by VanderWeele\ntween the intervention and the media-\ntor, then the controlled direct effect is\nthe same for every level of the medi-\nator. In this case, the controlled direct\neffect can be subtracted from the total\neffect to obtain the indirect effect. This\napproach requires four assumptions:\n(a) that there are no unmeasured con-\nfounders of the intervention and un-\nprotected sex; (b) that there are no\nunmeasured confounders of the inter-\nvention and risky relationship thoughts;\n(c) that there are no unmeasured con-\nfounders of risky relationship thoughts\nand unprotected sex; and (d) that there\nare no interactions between the inter-\nvention and risky relationship thoughts.\nIf individuals are randomized to levels\nof the intervention, as they are in the\nRRR-HIV study, then Assumptions (a)\nand (b) hold. However, this random-\nization does not imply that Assumption\n(c) holds. Randomization guarantees\nthat the intervention groups are equiv-\nalent on prerandomization variables,\nbut it does not preclude the possibility\nof differences between the intervention\ngroups on postrandomization variables.\nFurthermore, randomization to levels of\nthe intervention does not mean that in-\ndividuals are randomized to levels of the\nmediator. Without randomization to lev-\nels of the mediator, there is no guarantee\nthat there are no confounders of the me-\ndiator and outcome.\nproposed to define and estimate all of\nthe effects given above using marginal\nstructural models (MSMs) with an in-\nverse propensity weighted (IPW) esti-\nmator using identifying Assumptions\n(a) through (c). MSMs are models for\nthe potential outcomes and have been\ndescribed previously, along with IPW\nestimation, in the prevention literature\n(e.g., Bray, Almirall, Zimmerman,\nCaldwell, & Smith, in press) and epi-\ndemiology literature (e.g., Cole et al.,\ncomes, the MSMs may be given as\nE \u00bdM\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc \"\n\u00fe \"\nand\nE\u00bdY\u00f0t; m\u00de \u00bc \"\n\u00fe \"\nm \u00fe \"\n= E[Y(1,m)jY(0,m)] =\nm) is the\ncontrolled direct effect defined above,\n) j\nis the effect of the intervention\non risky relationship thoughts, and\n\"\n\u00bc E\u00bdY\u00f0t; m\u00de \u00c0 Y\u00f0t; m\u00b6\u00de is the effect\nof risky relationship thoughts on un-\nprotected sex, holding constant inter-\nvention condition. The MSMs are fit\nby choosing an appropriate model for\nthe observed outcome (e.g., linear regres-\nsion, logistic regression, and survival\nmodel) and using the IPW estimator\nrather than the usual ordinary least\nsquares or maximum likelihood esti-\nmator. If individuals are randomized\nto levels of the intervention, then As-\nsumption (a) holds, and weights are\nunnecessary for estimating Equation\n(1). The models for the observed data,\nas opposed to the potential outcomes,\nare given as\nE\u00bdMi\njTi\n\u00bc ti\n \u00bc \"\n\u00fe \"\nti\nand\nE\u00bdYi\njTi\n\u00bc ti\n; Mi\n\u00bc m\n\u00bc \"\n\u00fe \"\nm \u00fe \"\nti\nproposed a null hypothesis test of no\nmediation. Specifically, the null hypoth-\nesis is that either the effect of the inter-\nvention on risky relationship thoughts or\nthe effect of risky relationship thoughts\non unprotected sex, holding constant in-\ntervention condition, is zero. If Assump-\ntion (d) holds, then an estimate of the\nCopyright @ 2012 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

Although an estimate\nof the indirect effect itself requires As-\nsumption (d), the null hypothesis test\nof no mediation is still valid, and un-\nbiased estimates can be obtained of\nthe causal effect of the intervention on\nrisky relationship thoughts and of risky\nrelationship thoughts on unprotected\nsex, holding constant intervention con-\ndition regardless of whether Assump-\ntion (d) holds.\nEmpirical Demonstration\nStudy Design and Participants The\ndata for these analyses came from the\nRRR-HIV intervention. Briefly, the in-\ntervention includes five group sessions\nin prison (prior to release) and one in-\ndividual telephone or face-to-face ses-\nsion after release. The purpose of the\nintervention is to change risky rela-\ntionship thoughts, such as ``Having sex\nwithout a condom will strengthen my\nrelationship,'' with the intent of re-\nducing HIV-risk behaviors. Participants\nwere recruited from correctional facili-\nties in Connecticut, Delaware, Kentucky,\nand Rhode Island. Women were eligi-\nble to participate if they were at least\n18 years of age, scheduled to go before\nthe parole board in the next 6 weeks,\nhad at least weekly substance use be-\nfore incarceration, and were willing to\nbe randomized to study condition. Inter-\nvention details, including consent pro-\ncedures, are described in Havens et al.\nData were collected at three time\npoints: baseline, 30 days postinterven-\ntion, and 90 days postintervention. The\nparticipants include 243 women who\nwere present at each of the three time\npoints. The characteristics of this sam-\nple can be found in Table 1.\nMeasures All study measures were\nbased on participant self-report data\ncollected by trained research staff. Each\nof the measures reports on behavior in\nthe previous 30 days. The outcome for\nthese analyses, measured at 90 days\npostintervention, is unprotected sex, a\nbinary variable defined as 1 = having\nhad sex at least once without a condom\nin the previous 30 days and 0 = no sex\nwithout a condom or no sex in the\nprevious 30 days. The mediator, risky\nrelationship thoughts, is a scale score\ncomputed by taking the mean of six\nitems. The scale of each item ranged\nfrom 1 (never) to 10 (everyday); higher\nscores correspond to more frequent\nrisky relationship thoughts.

The probabil-\nity for the denominator of the weights\nfor the mediator is given by the p.d.f. of\nM given treatment history and the mea-\nsured confounders, @(Mi\n|Ti\n,Xi\n); the\nweights for risky relationship thoughts\nare @(Mi\n|Ti\n)/ @(Mi\n|Ti\n,Xi\n).

After the weights\nare created, they are incorporated into\nEquation (4) in the same manner as survey\nweights using SAS PROC GENMOD.\nSAS PROC GLM was used for fitting\nEquation (3), because no weights were\nneeded because the intervention was ran-\ndomized (see Document, Supplemental\nDigital Content 1, for an example of SAS\ncode, http://links.lww.com/NRES/A69).\nResults\nFigure 2 illustrates what is commonly\nreferred to as balance on the measured\nconfounders and presents the correla-\ntions between risky relationship thoughts\nand the confounders included in the pro-\npensity model before and after weight-\ning. It is recommended that these\ndifferences be less than .1 (in absolute\nvalue), which is considered a small ef-\ning, several of the correlations were\ngreater than |.1|, but after weighting,\nthey were all less than |.1|. If they were\nnot all less than |.1|, the propensity\nmodel should be revisited and inter-\naction or quadratic terms added to\nthe propensity model until balance is\nachieved.\nTo determine whether the effect of\nthe intervention was mediated by risky\nrelationship thoughts, each of the effects\nwas estimated as described above. The\neffect of the intervention on risky rela-\ntionship thoughts was significant (\"1\n=\nj0.06), such that the intervention re-\nsulted in a decrease in risky relationship\nthoughts. The effect of risky relation-\nship thoughts on unprotected sex was\nalso statistically significant (\"2\nunit increase in risky relationship thoughts\nresulted in a 1.56 times increase in the\nodds of unprotected sex.

It is now generally\naccepted in the statistical mediation lit-\nerature that a significant total effect is\nFollowing the procedures in Coffman\nhypothesis that either the effect of the in-\ntervention on risky relationship thoughts\nor the effect of risky relationship thoughts\non unprotected sex, holding constant in-\ntervention condition, was zero (p = .028).\nBased on this information, we concluded\nthat the intervention's effect on unpro-\ntected sex was indeed mediated by risky\nrelationship thoughts.\nDiscussion\nMediation is, by definition, a question\nabout causal pathways. Even if indi-\nviduals are randomly assigned to levels\nof the intervention and randomization\ndoes not fail (e.g., no noncompliance),\nthis does not imply that individuals are\nrandomly assigned to levels of the me-\ndiator. In fact, confounders of the medi-\nator and outcome almost always exist.\nWithout proper control of these con-\nfounders, the estimate of the effect of\nthe mediator on the outcome and the\nestimate of the direct effect of the inter-\nvention on the outcome will be biased.\nUsing IPW is one approach in con-\ntrolling for confounders. Another ap-\nproach would be to control for all\nconfounders using regression adjust-\nment (i.e., ANCOVA); however, propen-\nsity scores are advantageous because\nthey reduce a potentially large number\nof confounders into a single-number\nsummary. Furthermore, regression ad-\njustment may still result in biased esti-\nmates of the direct effect if posttreatment\nconfounders are included in the regres-\nThe RRR-HIV intervention was used\nas a motivating example because of the\nFIGURE 2.

In partic-\nular, there was no measure of the me-\ndiator at baseline. The baseline measure\nof the mediator is an obvious potential\nconfounder of the mediator at 30-day\nfollow-up and of the outcome at 90-day\nfollow-up. The method described above\nrelies on the assumption that all con-\nfounders are measured and controlled\nproperly. This is a very strong assump-\ntion that cannot be tested in practice.\nHowever, the more potential confound-\ners included in the propensity model,\nthe more plausible the assumption be-\ncomes. Thus, it is imperative that re-\nsearchers measure as many potential\nconfounders as possible. In addition,\nthe impact of the unmeasured con-\nfounder is mitigated if a measured po-\ntential confounder is highly correlated\nwith the unmeasured confounder.\nNevertheless, a next step with ap-\nproaches that rely on the assumption\nof no unmeasured confounding is to\nconduct a sensitivity analysis, which at-\ntempts to determine how strongly influ-\nential an unmeasured confounder would\nneed to be to change the estimate in a\nmeaningful way (e.g., change the esti-\nmate from statistically significant to\nnot, reverse the sign of the estimate).\nSensitivity analysis is being developed\nfor continuous exposures/mediators. De-\nspite challenges of the data set, it was\npossible to demonstrate how this ap-\nproach can be used to assess mediation.\nIt should be noted that the traditional\nregression approach to mediation,\nwhich is likely familiar to most readers,\nalso assumes no unmeasured confound-\ning of the mediator and outcome,\nalthough this assumption is rarely sta-\nted explicitly. Furthermore, in the tradi-\ntional approach, researchers usually\ncontrol for only a few demographic var-\niables, if they control for any potential\nconfounders at all. As shown by Steiner,\ntrolling for only a few demographic var-\niables is generally insufficient to obtain\nunbiased estimates.\nFor comparison, the model was\nfit without the weights; that is, a lo-\ngistic regression of unprotected sex on\nthe intervention and risky relationship\nthoughts. As with the IPW estimates,\nthe effect of the intervention on un-\nprotected sex, holding constant risky\nrelationship thoughts, was not statis-\ntically significant. The effect of risky\nrelationship thoughts on unprotected\nsex, holding constant the intervention\ncondition, was statistically significant\nThus, a one-unit increase in risky\nrelationship thoughts resulted in a\n1.42 times increase in the odds of un-\nprotected sex. This estimate is not\ndramatically different from the IPW\nestimate (the CIs overlap); however, it\nis a 14% difference in the odds ratio\npoint estimates.\nThe controlled effects approach is\nvaluable in nursing research. Controlled\neffects differ from the traditional regres-\nsion approach to mediation, primarily\nin that weights are used in estimation, ac-\ncounting for potential confounding. The\ncontrolled effects approach addresses\nquestions such as ``What is the effect of\nthe RRR-HIV intervention on unpro-\ntected sex, holding constant the level of\nrisky relationship thoughts?'', ``What is\nthe effect of the RRR-HIV intervention\non risky relationship thoughts?'', and\n``What is the effect of risky relationship\nthoughts on unprotected sex, holding\nconstant intervention status?'' If As-\nsumption (d) holds, then this approach\nalso addresses the question: ``What is\nthe effect of the RRR-HIV intervention\non unprotected sex that is due to risky\nrelationship thoughts?'' The indirect\neffect itself is not identified unless there\nis no interaction between the interven-\ntion and mediator. Nevertheless, the two\neffects that make up the indirect effect\n(i.e., the effect of the intervention on the\nmediator and the effect of the mediator\non the outcome, holding constant the in-\ntervention condition) are identified re-\ngardless of whether or not there is an\ninteraction between the intervention\nand mediator. In summary, an advan-\ntage of the potential outcomes frame-\nwork is that it allows for the careful\ndefinition of causal effects and of the\nassumptions needed for identification\nand estimation of the causal effects. q\nThe authors thank Amanda Applegate for edi-\ntorial assistance.\nPreparation of this article was supported by\nNational Institute on Drug Abuse Center Grant\ntent is solely the responsibility of the authors\nand does not necessarily represent the official\nviews of the National Institute on Drug Abuse,\nthe National Cancer Institute, or the National\nInstitutes of Health.\nThe authors have no conflicts of interest to\ndisclose.\nCorresponding author: Donna L.
