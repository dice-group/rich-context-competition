Moritz2\n'Department of Epidemiology, Yale School of Medicine.\n2University of California-San Francisco Medical School.\nAn earlier report documented that, in a community-dwelling sample of 317 older married couples, cognitive impair-\nment in a wife was associated with depressive symptoms in her husband (Moritz, Kasl, and Berkman, 1989). No\nsimilar effects werefound for wives. Here we examine the extent to which marital closeness moderates the impact of\na spouse's cognitive impairment, the stability of influences over 3 years, and gender differences in the associations.\nAnalyses of covariance, controlling for respondent risk factors and potential confounders in the spouse, showed\nthat marital closeness moderated the impact of a wife's cognitive impairment, with husbands in close marriages af-\nfected more strongly than husbands in less close marriages. These effects held over 3 years. In addition, husbands\nbecame less depressed following the death of a severely impaired wife, whereas widowers whose wife had been\nunimpaired at baseline were more depressed. None of these effects werefound for wives.\nQUESTIONS raised by prior research findings concern-\ning the impact of living with a cognitively impaired\nspouse on a husband or wife, analyses designed to answer\nthose questions, and possible explanations for our findings\nare described in this article.\nIn an earlier report, Moritz, Kasl, and Berkman (1989)\ndocumented that, in a sample of 317 older, noninstitutional-\nized married couples who lived in the community, greater\ncognitive impairment in a wife was associated with in-\ncreased depressive symptoms in her husband. These effects\nwere significant even after the respondent's education,\nrace, financial distress, chronic health conditions, and func-\ntional disability -- all potential contributors to his or her\nlevel of depressive symptoms -- were statistically con-\ntrolled. No similar effects on the wives were observed.\nThe authors explored three possible explanations for this\nimpact, all of which had been suggested by the literature\nand had potentially resulted from the wife's impairment:\nthat the husband's depressive symptoms were reactive to\n(1) increased burden of responsibilities created by the\nwife's impairment, (2) low levels of shared activities with\nher, or (3) restricted interactions with others who might\notherwise provide emotional support. To examine these\nhypotheses, the authors analyzed the impact of several po-\ntentially moderating variables including social isolation;\nperceived adequacy of financial, instrumental, and emo-\ntional support; the allocation of household responsibilities;\nand the extent of functional impairment in the respondent\nand in the spouse. Although all of these variables were in-\ndeed associated with increased cognitive impairment in\none's spouse, only perceived adequacy of financial support\nmoderated the impact of the wife's impairment on the hus-\nband's depressive symptoms. Specifically, the negative im-\npact of the wife's cognitive impairment was stronger\namong those who reported relying on their children for fi-\nnancial support. As noted above, increased cognitive im-\npairment in husbands was not associated with increased\ndepressive symptoms in their wives; neither was its poten-\ntially depressive impact moderated by the sequelae of hus-\nbands' greater cognitive impairment. With none of the three\nleading hypotheses supported, the authors of the earlier re-\nport reflected on their findings and concluded that, instead,\n\"The emotional strain of witnessing and adapting to\nspouses' mental, behavioral, and personality changes to-\ngether with the loss of companionship and intimacy are\nlikely to contribute to increased depressive symptoms.\"\nIn other recent research we showed that depressive\nsymptoms in one spouse contribute to those in the other;\nthat this effect increases over time; and that it is strongly\nmoderated by marital closeness, with close couples more\naffected by changes in a spouse than are less close couples\nof marital closeness might create a condition in which\nthe effect of a spouse's cognitive impairment would be\nstrongest. Following the quotation above, this line of rea-\nsoning implies that the mechanism by which one's spouse's\ncognitive impairment influences the depressive symptoms\nof the other may be related to (1) loss of a valued resource\nwith greater intimacy associated with greater centrality of\nthe spouse and thus impact (Costello, 1982; Hobfoll,\n1989); (2) the empathic pain of witnessing deterioration in\nsomeone one loves; (3) helplessness and hopelessness re-\nsulting from not being able to influence the deterioration\nand ultimate death of the spouse (Abramson, Metalsky, and\nPagel, Becker, and Coppel, 1985); and (4) the requirements\nof adapting to change (Lawton et al., 1991), with changes\nin a close relationship being more demanding than changes\nin a less close relationship. The last two dynamics would,\npresumably, result in frustration, particularly for men whose\npreferred approach to coping is active problem solving\n(Pearlin and Schooler, 1978), even into old age (Diehl,\nThen, the inevitable failure of active problem solving (since\ndeterioration and death are beyond control) results in in-\ncreased depressive symptoms (Pagel, Becker, and Coppel,\n1985) as well as a related loss of self-efficacy, yet another\nsource of depressive symptoms (Beck, 1983; Blatt et al.,\nsymptoms are more likely to result from assault on self-\nesteem based on failures of effective problem-solving behav-\nior than are women's (Chevron, Quinlan, and Blatt, 1978),\nand because men are more likely to respond to a potentially\ndepressing situation with problem-focused action than are\ngender differences in the mechanisms of depression are rein-\nforced when a spouse is cognitively impaired.\nIt is not surprising that our earlier research showed such\ngender differences: the longitudinal impact of the spouse's\ndepressive symptoms was stronger for husbands than for\nwives (Tower and Kasl, 1996c); the impact of her cognitive\nimpairment on his depressive symptoms was substantial,\nwhereas his impact on her's was not statistically significant\n(Moritz, Kasl, and Berkman, 1989; see also Eagles et al.,\n1987); and, in close couples, a wife's health status was\nmore influential than a husband's own risk factors on his\ndepressive symptoms, whereas the same was not true for\nBecause wives are more likely to experience closeness with\nfriends and other relations than are husbands (Lee, 1988;\nare more likely to accept caregiving as a natural role, re-\ngardless of their role relationship or attachment to the per-\nson requiring care (Stone, Cafferata, and Sangl, 1987), we\nare not arguing that their spouse's cognitive impairment\nleaves them unaffected. Rather, we suggest that wives\nmight be affected by it through different dynamics and with\ndifferent consequences than are husbands. For example, our\nown previous findings of gender differences in the dynam-\nics of our couples suggest that women take physical dis-\ntress in a husband somewhat more in stride but are de-\npressed by a husband's emotional distance (Tower and\nKasl, 1996a). Here we argue that the influence of a wife's\ncognitive impairment on a husband's depressive symptoms\nwill be moderated by closeness but that wives will not nec-\nessarily be affected in the same way.\nIn our current expanded analyses of the data, we ask\nthree questions: To what extent does marital closeness\nmoderate the impact of the cognitive impairment of one\nspouse on the depressive symptoms of the other? Is this in-\nfluence stable across three years? Are effects the same for\nhusbands and wives? To answer these questions, we repeat\nthe models predicting spouse depressive symptoms that had\nbeen carefully developed in the earlier study with two criti-\ncal modifications: we add marital closeness and its interac-\ntion with a spouse's cognitive impairment as independent\nvariables to the models and, in addition, we control for a\nspouse's depressive symptoms, both because they might\nconfound through association with that spouse's cognitive\nimpairment (Lichtenberg et al., 1995; Teri and Wagner,\n1992) and because they contribute directly to a spouse's\ndepression when a couple is close (Tower and Kasl, 1995,\n1996c). As a way of extending our findings, we then ex-\nplore the impact of a spouse's cognitive impairment prospec-\ntively by examining its association with a respondent's de-\npressive symptoms and the moderating effect of closeness\nthree years after the baseline measurement of them. As be-\nreavement itself is also potentially depressing (Mendes de\nLeon, Kasl, and Jacobs, 1994), we control for a spouse's\ndeath in the intervening period and examine its interaction\nwith cognitive impairment. We analyze all data separately\nfor husbands and wives in order to highlight differences in\nMethodological strengths of our report include sample\ncharacteristics, features of data collection, and the avail-\nability of control variables. First, our couples are part of a\ncommunity-based sample. Spouses have not been selected\nbecause one was identified as demented or as a caregiver;\ntherefore, biases that may be associated with such identifi-\ncation are eliminated. In addition, comparisons between\ncouples in which a spouse is impaired and those in which a\nspouse is not impaired are possible. Because of the public\nhealth implications of our findings, this last point is particu-\nlarly important (Baumgarten et al., 1992; Grafstrom et al.,\n1992). Second, our respondents were each interviewed in-\ndividually and separately, eliminating the bias of one\nspouse making attributions about another's condition (Teri\nwave of interviews was available, we could answer ques-\ntions that require prospective data. Third, controlling for\nadditional variables is important for two reasons: respon-\ndents can become depressed by their own financial strain\n(Mendes de Leon, Rapp, and Kasl, 1994), illness (Anesh-\nensel, Frerichs, and Huba, 1984), and disability (Berkman\net al., 1986). Similarly, their spouse's depressive symp-\ntomatology can be a source of depressive symptoms (Tower\ntively impaired (Majerovitz, 1995). In additon, education,\nhealth, and financial comfort represent resources of a re-\nspondent that can be helpful in their dealings with a cogni-\ntively impaired spouse (or limiting if they are lacking), and\nthus moderate the impact of the impaired spouse (Lawton\nMETHOD\nSubjects and Procedure\nThe sample consisted of 317 community-dwelling mar-\nried couples (634 individuals) who participated in the base-\nline wave of the Yale Health and Aging Project (YHAP).\nThe YHAP consists of 2,812 noninstitutionalized men and\ninterview conducted at the New Haven site for the Epi-\ndemiologic Studies of the Elderly (EPESE) sponsored by\nthe National Institute on Aging. Of those enumerated, 82\npercent participated.\nIn our subset of married couples, husbands' average age\nan average of 43.3 years. They lived in private age-segre-\ngated housing (23.3%), public age-segregated housing\ndescribed extensively elsewhere (Moritz, Kasl, and Berk-\ntailed by Cornoni-Huntley et al. (1993) and Berkman et al.\nmained alive for the second wave of in-home interviews.\nIndividual interviews were conducted independently\nsearchers followed a 75-page protocol that included ques-\ntions concerning age, education, race, income, financial\nstrain; physical, emotional, and mental health; and social\nsupport.\nMeasures\nFinancial strain. -- A measure of financial strain was\ncreated by summing perceived adequacy of income for\nfood, medical care, and monthly bills and whether respon-\ndents felt that they had money left over at the end of the\nmonth, just enough to make ends meet, or not enough\nmoney to make ends meet. This index has a stronger asso-\nciation with depressive symptoms than does actual income\n(Mendes de Leon, Rapp, and Kasl, 1994), rendering it a\nmore powerful control variable than income. Higher scores\nindicate greater strain.\nChronic illness. -- Respondents were asked whether a\ndoctor had ever told them that he/she had heart disease,\ncancer, a stroke or brain hemorrhage, diabetes, cirrhosis or\nliver disease, a fractured hip, other broken bones, high\nblood pressure, Parkinson's disease, or arthritis. Positive re-\nsponses were summed, yielding the number of chronic ill-\nnesses experienced.\nDisability. -- Items querying severe disability (Katz et\nphysical performance (Nagi, 1976) were compiled into a\nGuttman-like scale creating a summary measure of func-\ntional disability (Berkman et al., 1986). Higher scores indi-\ncate greater disability.\nCognitive impairment. -- Interviews included adminis-\ntration of the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire\n(SPMSQ; Pfeiffer, 1975). Scores on the SPMSQ were tri-\nchotomized into no impairment (0 or 1 error), mild im-\npairment (2 or 3 errors), or severe impairment (4 or more\nerrors). The SPMSQ has been found to be an effective\nscreening device for dementia in community-based residents\nwith 4 or more errors a cutpoint with high sensitivity and\nspecificity (100% and 99.1% respectively; Erkinjuntii et al.,\nto complete the SPMSQ, primarily because of illness.

This measure has shown discriminative effective-\naware that baseline marital closeness may have been af-\nfected already by a spouse's cognitive impairment. How-\never, our current study addresses closeness as it existed at\nAnalysis\nWe conducted four sets of analyses based on the predic-\ntive model developed in the earlier study by Moritz, Kasl,\nand Berkman (1989). The first two sets examined the\ncross-sectional data from 1982. The last two expanded the\nlongitudinal inquiry by adding the 1985 CES-D score as the\ndependent measure. All data were analyzed separately for\nhusbands and wives.\nFirst, we added three variables to those in the original\n1982 cross-sectional models (Moritz, Kasl, and Berkman,\n1989). Because of their now known influence on a respon-\nand their association with cognitive impairment (Lichten-\npressive symptoms (i.e., CES-D score) were included as a\ncontrol variable. In addition, we added the new independent\nvariables of couple closeness and the interaction of Couple\ncloseness X Spouse cognitive impairment. Because both\ncouple closeness and spouse cognitive impairment are cate-\ngorical variables, data were analyzed by analysis of covari-\nance, controlling for respondent risk factors of age, educa-\ntion, financial strain, chronic illness, and disability. In an\nearlier step we had also included housing stratum, race, re-\nspondent cognitive impairment, and the spouse's education,\nchronic illness, and disability, on the theory that factors as-\nsociated with cognitive impairment might themselves be\nsources of depressive symptoms in a spouse. None of these\nvariables contributed significant variance to the model and\nhave been dropped from further analyses.\nSecond, in order to see better the differences in the dy-\nnamics of couples in the three couple closeness groups, the\nexpanded 1982 models were tested after the sample was\nstratified by couple closeness. Stratification eliminated cou-\nple closeness as an independent variable and made spousal\ncognitive impairment into a main effect.\nThird, to examine longitudinal influences, we repeated\nthe analysis of covariance model presented in Table 2 using\nthe 1985 CES-D score as the dependent variable. Here we\nincluded the respondent's baseline CES-D as a control vari-\nable. Further, because spousal death can itself be a source\nof depressive symptoms, we added it as an independent\nvariable along with the interaction of Spousal death X\nSpouse cognitive impairment.\nFinally, to clarify the effects seen in the above analyses,\nscores by level of wife cognitive impairment.\nRESULTS\nDistributions of Cognitive Impairment\nTable 1 shows the distributions of 1982 SPMSQ scores\nfor husbands and wives in 1982 and the frequencies of these\nvariables for the subsets of husbands and wives who did not\nsurvive to 1985. As can be seen, spouses with the most se-\nvere impairment were more likely to be dead within three\nthe most impaired wives) than were spouses with less im-\npairment. We note that these numbers are presented for de-\nscriptive purposes only; they are not adjusted for age or\nother variables and thus do not reflect a survival analysis.\nTable 2 presents the mean sum of squares and its signifi-\ncance level for each source of variance in husbands' and\nwives' 1982 CES-D scores. For those variables that make a\nstatistically significant contribution to the respondent's\nCES-D score, the unique proportion of variance accounted\nfor by that variable, calculated by dividing the unique sum\nof squares for that variable by the total sum of squares for\nthe equation, is identified in the table as percent of unique\nvariance. Results for husbands appear on the left side of the\ntable; those for wives are on the right.\nHusbands. -- A husband's 1982 CES-D score was sig-\nnificantly associated with his perceived financial strain, dis-\nability, and his wife's depressive symptoms (see Table 2).\nControlling for those potential confounders along with age,\neducation, and husband's chronic illness, couple closeness\nhad a main effect on depressive symptoms, accounting for\n3.8 percent of unique variance as well as a significant effect\nin interaction with the wife's cognitive impairment, ac-\ncounting for an additional 3.5 percent of unique variance.\nHusbands who were in mutually close marriages had a\nparticularly high CES-D score when the wife was severely\nimpaired (mean of 19.0) compared to all other groups with\nmeans of less than 7.0 (see Table 4, top portion, for the\nWhen stratified analyses were run separately for the three\ncouple closeness groups (see Table 3), data became even\nclearer: The impact of a wife's cognitive impairment on her\nhusband's depressive symptoms was strong only in the mu-\ntually close group. For them, 5.0 percent of unique variance\nwas associated with it.\nFor a stricter comparison with the earlier model, we also\nexamined the stratified models without the inclusion of the\nspouse's CES-D score and with the inclusion of her educa-\ntion. The effects of the husband's own variables increased\nslightly in all three groups. Of greater interest, the wife's\ncognitive impairment now accounted for 9.7 percent of\nunique variance in the CES-D scores of husbands in close\ncouples and less that 1.0 percent of those of husbands in the\nother two groups (not shown).\nWives. -- Consistent with the earlier findings (Moritz,\nKasl, and Berkman, 1989), a wife's CES-D score was not\nsignificantly associated with a husband's cognitive impair-\nment, even when couple closeness was considered (see\nTable 2). As anticipated, when the model was tested sepa-\nrately for the different closeness groups, the influence of a\nhusband's cognitive impairment was still not statistically\nsignificant (see Table 3). These results did not change mate-\nrially when the husband's CES-D score was eliminated.\nIn examining 1985 CES-D scores, we included the re-\nspondent's 1982 CES-D score as a covariate. In addition,\nbecause of the potentially depressive impact of bereave-\nment, spousal death was controlled along with the interac-\ntion of spousal death and cognitive impairment. We note\nthat 47 percent of the husbands and 35 percent of the wives\nwho were severely impaired in 1982 were dead by the\nspouse's 1985 interview (see Table 1). We do not show re-\nsults of the 1985 CES-D analysis of covariance in a table,\nbut the lower part of Table 4 shows the 1985 means for the\nhusbands.\nHusbands. -- Couple closeness at baseline showed a sig-\nnificant impact on a husband's depressive symptoms three\nyears later as well as a significant interaction with a wife's\nSPMSQ\nMissing data\nHusbands\nWives\n\"Percentages in this column are the proportion of those who scored 0-1, 2-3, or 4+ errors on the SPMSQ and were dead after three years.\nTable 2.

In addition, while spousal death did\nnot have a main effect beyond the influences of the marital\nvariables, it did have a significant effect in interaction with\nspousal cognitive impairment. Because of this interaction\nand the interaction of couple closeness and wife cognitive\nimpairment, we would have liked to test for a 3-way inter-\naction of Couple closeness X Wife cognitive impairment X\nWife death. This was not possible, however, because two of\nthe cells were empty and none of those in the \"wife died\"\ncondition had more than five husbands with 1985 CES-D\nscores. This low statistical power underscores the impor-\ntance of our significant results for the two-way interactions.\nTable 4.

Of note, husbands in mutually close marriages whose\nwives had severe cognitive impairment at baseline were\ndramatically more depressed (mean CES-D of 18.8) than\nother husbands 3 years later. In contrast husbands in mutu-\nally distant marriages whose wives were severely impaired\nat baseline were the least depressed after 3 years (mean of\n2.7). Most interesting, perhaps, is that husbands whose\nwives showed no impairment at baseline and died within\nthe 3-year period were more depressed (mean of 14.5) com-\npared to those whose wives had been severely impaired but\ndied within the 3 years (mean of 5.8). The reverse was true\nfor husbands whose wives remained alive in 1985: Those\nwhose wives had had no impairment were least depressed\n(mean of 5.2) compared to those whose wives had severe\nimpairment at baseline (mean of 13.0).\nWives. -- A husband's cognitive impairment continued to\nhave no impact on a wife's depressive symptoms 3 years\nafter baseline. In addition, neither a husband's death nor in-\nteraction of death with cognitive impairment was statisti-\ncally significant.\nDISCUSSION\nIn summary, the husbands in our study were affected by\ncognitive impairment in their wives by showing higher lev-\nels of depressive symptoms. This effect was strongest in\nthose husbands who were in mutually close marriages, and\nit persisted over a 3-year period. Further, if a wife had been\nseverely impaired and died within the 3 years, the husband\nbecame less depressed, whereas if she had been unim-\npaired, the husband showed higher levels of depression fol-\nlowing her death. None of our analyses showed a similar\nimpact of husband's impairment on their wives. First, we\ndiscuss the moderation of the impact of a wife's cognitive\nimpairment by marital closeness. Next, we address the per-\nsistence of the moderating effect over 3 years, net of the\nbaseline effects. Third, we consider the impact of the inter-\naction of the wife's level of cognitive impairment and her\nsurvival over 3 years. Fourth, we discuss the gender differ-\nences in our findings. We close with a few final remarks\nconcerning the dynamics of depressive experience revealed\nby our study.\nInfluences of a spouse's cognitive impairment and the\nmoderating effect of marital closeness. -- In addition to a\nspouse having special needs associated with his or her own\naging, he or she must respond to specific qualities associ-\nated with the mate and with the marital relationship. A\nspouse's cognitive impairment alters the relationship in\nmultiple ways. Other studies have explored effects of the\nburdens of caregiving (George and Gwyther, 1986; Lawton\net al., 1991); the satisfactions of caregiving (Lawton et al.,\nMoritz, Kasl, and Berkman, 1989); decreases in shared ac-\ntivities (George and Gwyther, 1986; Moritz, Kasl, and\nBerkman, 1989); and in access to other sources of social\nsupport (George and Gwyther, 1986; Moritz, Kasl, and\nBerkman, 1989). Three additional qualities of the relation-\nship that are influenced by cognitive impairment and are\nparticularly important in influencing one spouse's response\nto impairment in the other are perceptions of the other\nspouse as a resource, potential closeness in the relationship,\nand the meaning of dependency.\nFirst, the loss of a perceived resource is stressful to any-\none, and the impact of that stress increases as the centrality\nof the resource increases (Hobfoll, 1989). Therefore, the\ncognitive impairment of a spouse may be far more difficult\nwhen a couple is close to each other than when a less in-\ntense relationship is operative. Of course it is possible that\ncouples in which one spouse has become impaired have re-\ntreated from mutual closeness to a more asymmetric or\neven detached position prior to our data collection; as we\nwill argue below, such detachment appears to have adaptive\nvalue. So to find the effect as strong as it is in our data and\nto see its persistence over time both supports our measure\nof closeness and underscores the power of the phenomenon\nit reflects. From this perspective, the continuation of mutual\ncloseness in the context of a spouse's severe impairment\nmay represent a failure in adaptation.\nSecond, a spouse is often a source of emotional close-\nness, particularly through provision of emotional support\nand by being a person with whom one can share one's most\nintimate thoughts and feelings. When one spouse becomes\ndependent because of chronic illness or physical disability,\nthese qualities of the relationship may be disrupted, but the\nextent of the disruption is probably limited to the extent\nthat the spouse's own distress or pain prevents him or her\nfrom remaining emotionally connected. When cognitive\nimpairment is the source of dependency, changes in person-\nality, mood regulation, behavior, memory, planning, rea-\nsoning, and judgment interfere with maintenance of the\nempathic connection in a close relationship. Therefore,\nmarried couples who are particularly close may be expected\nto experience greater loss. Loss of an important emotional\nattachment can lead to depression (Blatt and Zuroff, 1992).\nThird, long-term marriage provides one with an expecta-\ntion of safe dependency in old age. Here again, cognitive\nimpairment in a spouse presents a uniquely stressful situa-\ntion. One spouse is forced to watch the gradual erosion of\nthe person upon whom one expected to rely. For husbands,\nan impaired wife presents a challenge to hopes and expec-\ntations of how things would be. For wives, an impaired\nhusband presents caregiving demands she had most likely\nalready anticipated combined with the perhaps unexpected\nloss of a long-time friend as he becomes transformed. For\nboth, the situation is uncontrollable, one in which no re-\nspondent behavior is likely to alter or even retard the ulti-\nmate outcome; and it is one for which the unimpaired\nspouse can take no responsibility. The latter may seem\nself-evident and of little consequence, yet in married cou-\nples who are close, depression or good spirits in one spouse\nare strongly associated with similar feelings in the other\nof cross-spouse influences and therefore responsibilities\nwould be a natural one. Again, marital closeness amplifies\nthe contagion and thus probably generalization of the ex-\npectation that one can affect one's mate. The feelings of\nhelplessness that are intrinsically a part of the situation of\ndealing with cognitive impairment would thus be greatest\nin close couples and, therefore, to the extent that feelings of\nhopelessness and helplessness are associated with depres-\nsive symptoms, closer couples could be expected to feel\nthem more strongly along with their associated depressive\nsymptoms.\nThe endurance of the impact of marital closeness over\nthree years. -- Few longitudinal studies exist concerning\nthe impact of a cognitively impaired spouse on the other\nspouse although such research is urgently needed (Schulz,\nVisitainer, and Williamson, 1990). One notable exception is\na longitudinal study of 28 husbands and 58 wives who were\ncaring for demented spouses. The caregivers were 30 times\nmore likely than a group of sociodemographically matched\ncontrol subjects to be depressed. Of even greater interest,\nthe depressive reactions of the caregiving spouses were\natypical: in contrast to the comparison group of spouses\nwith no cognitive impairment, they were highly unlikely to\nhave experienced either a prior episode of a depressive dis-\norder or to suffer a family history of mental illness (Dura,\nStukenberg, & Kiecolt-Glaser, 1990). Psychological autop-\nsies of older men who have committed suicide showed that\nthey were unlikely to have had a prior history of depression\n(Conwell et al., 1966). Since suicide in the elderly is most\ncommon in men, and specifically in those men who are de-\npressed (Pearson, 1996), male caregivers of demented\nwives comprise a particularly high risk group, and aggres-\nsive intervention efforts are indicated.\nA second important longitudinal study also underscores\nthe unique influences of one spouse's cognitive impairment\nhusbands and wives who had been identified as providing\nin-home care to demented spouses for a year. They mea-\nsured depressive symptoms and self-rated health at 6\nmonths and again at 12 months. Their data clearly showed\nthat depressive symptoms preceded decreases in physical\nhealth, with poorer health occurring over time, presumably\nas the symptoms of the impaired spouse increased. These\nfindings are consistent with the large community-based\nstudy of Grafstrom et al. (1992) that showed spouses of\ndemented individuals who were institutionalized to be in\npoorer health than spouses of those who remained at home.\nThey suggest future health risk in our particularly vulnera-\nble group of husbands.\nThe interaction of wife impairment and her survival. --\nOur results suggest a husband's relief when a severely im-\npaired wife dies and, presumably, the negative impact of her\nimpairment ceases. They contrast with findings of Bodnar\nand Kiecolt-Glaser (1994), who found that depression asso-\nciated with caregiving to a demented spouse lingered up to\n3 years beyond the death of the spouse. However, in that\nstudy the patients had all been diagnosed with Alzheimer's\ndisease and their spouses were identified caregivers. Nine-\nteen had been institutionalized. It is possible that once a pa-\ntient is identified and his or her caregiver is actively seek-\ning help or support, the dynamics of the relationship and its\nimpact change. Indeed, while one of the effects of formal\nsupport may be to facilitate emotional detachment from a\ndemented spouse in order to cushion the negative impact of\nthe loss of the relationship as it had been, another may be to\nincrease a sense of responsibility and thus prolong symp-\ntoms through increasing rumination (Bodnar and Kiecolt-\nGlaser, 1994). Because only eight of the most severely im-\npaired wives in our study who had couple closeness data\ndied within the 3-year interval (13 remained alive), and\nonly 10 of the husbands with the most severely impaired\nconsider our last analyses to be exploratory only.\nGender differences. -- We note that a husband's depres-\nsive symptoms were clearly affected by a wife's cognitive\nimpairment and that the reverse did not occur within the\nframe of our observations. We are not saying, however, that\nhusbands had higher levels of depression. Rather, as is con-\nsistently found, the females in the sample scored higher\nthan the males (for discussion, see Tower and Kasl, 1996a).\nThe only condition in which that was not true occurred\namong husbands in mutually close marriages whose wives\nwere severely impaired. To this point, we again note the as-\nsociation between severe impairment and increased risk of\nmortality (Bruce et al., 1995) and suggest that issues of un-\nexpected loss may have been prominent, especially for\nthose husbands who did not disengage emotionally from\ntheir spouses.\nSpecifically, husbands may hold the expectation that\ntheir wives will always be available; wives, on the other\nhand, can expect to finish out their later years as a widow\nand are thus more likely to anticipate that they will need al-\nternate sources of support once their husband dies. Perhaps\nthe difference in this expectation underlies men's tendency\nto rely on their wives for closeness whereas wives are more\nlikely to have an extended circle of intimate relationships\nwife's cognitive impairment may, therefore, present a hus-\nband with requirements for adaptation that he had not ex-\npected and for which he is ill prepared. At the same time, a\nwife would have not only expected to rely on those other\nthan her husband as she aged, but would have put those re-\nlationships in place.\nFinal comments. -- Finally, we note unique features of\ndepressive experience associated with living with a cogni-\ntively impaired spouse. It appears to differ from other de-\npressive experience in etiology, course, and consequences.\nSpecifically, its development is more likely to be of first\nonset and lacking in family history (Dura, Stukenberg, and\nKiecolt-Glaser, 1990) suggesting that it is a response to a\nuniquely stressful situation. In addition, whereas women\nusually respond to social influences with depressive symp-\ntoms and men do not (Brown and Harris, 1978; Nolen-\nHoeksema, 1987), husbands respond to this situation with\nheightened distress. The symptoms precede decrements in\nphysical health rather than following from them (Pruchno\net al., 1990), and thus the situation presages somatic as well\nas psychological risk. Finally, in our study depressive\nsymptoms remitted upon the death of a cognitively im-\npaired spouse. Because our data help identify a population\nat particularly high risk for such depression -- specifically,\nhusbands of cognitively impaired wives who are in close\nmarriages -- we suggest that intervention efforts aimed to\nspecifically serve them be initiated.\n"
