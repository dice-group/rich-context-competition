The sense of smell was evaluated using the Olfactory Function Field Exam (OFFE), a measure designed spe-\ncifically for field research, which assesses 3 components of olfaction: sensitivity to n-butanol (a standard testing odorant)\nand androstadienone (AND, a key social odor produced by humans), as well as the ability to identify odors. Respondents\nwere randomly selected from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project Wave 2 sample to receive the OFFE\nResults. In the U.S. population aged 62\u00ad90, n-butanol detection ability was significantly worse at older ages (ordinal\nlogistic regression, p < .001); however, there was no difference in detection ability between genders (p = .60). AND\ndetection ability was also significantly worse at older ages (p = .003), but in contrast to n-butanol, women outperformed\nmen (p = .001). As expected, odor identification ability was worse in older people than in younger (p < .001), and women\nwere more accurate than men (p = .001).\nDiscussion.We report for the first time 3 facets of olfactory function and its association with age and gender in a\nrepresentative sample of U.S. older adults. Future analyses of these data are needed to elucidate the sense of smell's role\nin physical, social, and mental health with aging.\nKey Words:Aging--Androstadienone--n-Butanol--Odor identification--Olfaction.\nThe sense of smell is a critical sensory modality for not\nonly human health but also psychosocial function and\noverall quality of life (Frasnelli & Hummel, 2005; Smeets\net al., 2009). Although there is a literature investigating\nolfaction and age (for a recent review, see Doty & Kamath,\n2014), olfactory function has never before been measured\nin a nationally representative sample of older adults. Thus,\nmeasuring olfaction is an important component of the\nNational Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP).\nThese data provide the ability to estimate the prevalence of\nolfactory dysfunction in the growing older adult population\nof the United States and to investigate the substantial health\nand social consequences for older adults associated with\nthis basic sensory ability.\nA functioning sense of smell requires the ability to physi-\ncally detect an odor. People with high odor sensitivity can\ndetect the presence of an odor at low concentrations of the\nodor molecule, whereas those with low sensitivity require\nhigher concentrations. This parallels sensory frailty in\nother senses, for example hearing, where a stimulus has to\nbe louder to be perceived, a common condition of aging.\nn-Butanol is a standard odorant used to assess olfactory\nsensitivity. It is a short primary alcohol found in foods, fer-\nmented beverages, and numerous consumer products.\nA functional sense of smell also requires the ability to\ncognitively identify an odor and its associated meaning\nor name. Olfactory identification is typically measured by\npresenting familiar odors of common objects such as flow-\ners, foods, and household items. First, the odor must be\ndetected, but to correctly identify an odor requires the cog-\nnitive ability to then link that odor with a word or picture.\nThese independent components of olfactory function do\nnot operate in isolation and are equally important to assess\nwhen considering what role olfactory function plays in the\nlives of older adults.\nTherefore, we developed and employed the Olfactory\nFunction Field Exam (OFFE), a tool to measure the sense\nof smell in field and survey research (Kern, Wroblewski,\nSchumm,Pinto,&McClintock,inpress).TheOFFEincludes\nnot only a measure of odor identification previously used in\nNSHAP Wave 1 (Boesveldt, Lindau, McClintock, Hummel,\n& Lundstr\u00f6m, 2011; Pinto, Schumm, Wroblewski, Kern,\nOlfaction Assessment\nfirst measure of odor detection designed for use in a survey\nresearch study.\nThe sense of smell declines with age, a condition known as\npresbyosmiaandisanaspectofsensoryfrailtysimilartoimpaired\nhearing or vision. The factors that predict this decline are poorly\nunderstood,however.Thoughtheinfluencesofolfactiononhealth\nare too numerous to detail here (for a review, see Jones & Rog,\nsequences to consider for older adults: nutrition and detection\nof danger. The sense of smell has a large effect on dietary habits\nwhich are vital components of maintaining physical health. Much\nof what is perceived as the flavor and enjoyment of food is actu-\nally a product of retronasal olfactory perception, in which odors\nfrom food travel through the back of the throat into the nose dur-\ningeating.Hence,presbyosmiacanresultindecreasedenjoyment\nof food and associated social behaviors, such as dining out or\nsharing a meal with others (Aschenbrenner et al., 2008). A func-\ntional sense of smell is also critical for detecting malodorous envi-\nronmental dangers like spoiled food or smoke (Santos, Reiter,\nDiNardo, & Costanzo, 2004), as well as mercaptans, which serve\nas warning signals in otherwise odorless natural gas (Cain, Rabin,\nPierce, & Haven, 1989). Indeed, olfactory deficits are linked to\nincreased mortality (Gopinath, Sue, Kifley, & Mitchell, 2012;\nWilson,Yu, & Bennett, 2011), although the pathways linking loss\nof smell to specific causes of death remain undiscovered.\nOlfactory function is tied to not only health and qual-\nity of life measures like nutrition and avoiding potential\nenvironmental threats, but also detection of social odorants\nin the form of chemical signals that may be critical to the\nphysiology of social interactions, and even mental health.\nSocial chemical signals produced by humans have asso-\nciated odors and are known to affect behavior and mood\n(Havlicek, Murray, Saxton, & Roberts, 2010). Much prior\nresearch investigating human airborne chemical signals has\nalso focused on the possible existence of pheromonal mod-\nulators of sexual attraction or behavior (e.g., McClintock,\nLundstr\u00f6m & Olsson, 2005; Savic, Berglund, Gulyas, &\nHowever, recent research has suggested that human chemi-\ncal signals, such as the steroid androstadienone (AND),\na molecule that is found in human plasma (Brooksbank,\nWilson, & Macsweeney, 1972), sweat (Gower, Holland,\nhair (Nixon, Mallet, & Gower, 1988), and semen (Kwan,\nTrafford, Makin, Mallet, & Gower, 1992), may exhibit\na broader social function: tuning individuals' brains to\nattend to emotionally salient information (Hummer &\nMcClintock, 2009). Thus, AND has broader effects on\nemotional interactions than just sexuality and may con-\ntinue to function in postreproductive older adults. In this\ncontext, the ability to smell AND may be tied to its physio-\nlogical and behavioral affects at subliminal concentrations.\nDeficits to the sense of smell have also been linked to cog-\nnitive decline (Sohrabi et al., 2012), and dementia associ-\nated with several neurodegenerative disorders (Barresi et al.,\n2012). Thus, an individual's sense of smell is important for\nnavigating not only the physical and social world but also\nhas important implications for mental and cognitive health.\nPrevious survey research investigating olfactory func-\ntion has been limited to tasks of odor identification using\nsamples of convenience (Wysocki & Gilbert, 1989) or in\nrelatively homogeneous samples (Br\u00e4merson, Johansson,\nEk, Nordin, & Bende, 2004; Murphy, Cruickshanks, Klein,\nKlein, & Nondahl, 2002). This limitation stems from the\nfact that traditional tests of the ability to detect an odor (i.e.,\nsensitivity) use standard psychophysical measures that can\ntake up to 20min to administer, mainly because they require\nrepeated trials and many odorant concentrations (Hummel,\nSekinger, Wolf, Pauli, & Kobal, 1997). Prior efforts to\nstreamline a sensitivity protocol using fixed dose points\nstill too difficult to administer efficiently in a survey in the\nhome, especially along with a large number of social, psy-\nchological, and biological measures.\nSince the previous methods are ill-suited for omnibus\nfield surveys, the majority of knowledge of human olfac-\ntion is limited to laboratory and clinic based testing. Clinical\nolfactory studies have demonstrated that, in addition to the\nsubstantial social health deficits associated with olfactory\ndysfunction, declining olfactory abilities are a harbinger of\ncognitive deficits associated with neurodegenerative diseases\nsuggests olfactory tests may offer a means for earlier detec-\ntion of these devastating illnesses (Atanasova et al., 2008;\nBecause of these factors, which are important in geriat-\nrics, assessment of olfactory abilities in older adults offers\nnot only a unique opportunity to investigate the effect of\nreduced sensory abilities on the physical and social health\nof the aging U.S. population, but also the role of olfaction as\na potential marker of cognitive decline and neuropathology.\nMethod\nRespondents\nApproximately two-thirds of the NSHAP Wave 2 sample\nwas randomly selected to receive the OFFE (n = 2,304). Of\nents (n = 2,212) consented to participate in this module\nonstrating excellent cooperation rates. Table 1 summarizes\nthe demographics of the NSHAP Wave 2 olfaction sub-\nsample. Data is publicly available (Waite, L. J., Cagney,\nK., Dale, W., Huang, E., Laumann, E. O., McClintock, M.,\nO'Muircheartaigh, C. A., Schumm, L. P., and Cornwell, B.\nKern et al.\nNational Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP):\nArbor, MI: Inter-university Consortium for Political and\nOlfactory Function Field Exam\nOlfactory function was evaluated using commercially\navailable Sniffin' Sticks smell pens (Burghart Medical\nTechnology, Wedel, Germany). Sniffin' Sticks reliably\ndeliver the same concentration of n-butanol with each\npresentation for at least 3 years with correct use and\nproper storage (Denzer et al., 2014). The NSHAP W2\nA single set of pens was administered a median of 11 times\n(interquartile range = 5\u00ad19). As a result, we can be con-\nfidant that NSHAP's measures of olfactory function were\nreliable and consistent within a single interview, across\ninterviewers, and across the entire field period.\nWave 2 responses were directly entered into the\nComputer-Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI) by the Field\nInterviewer (FI), thereby reducing interviewer burden and\nerror associated with paper scoring.\nThe odor detection component of the OFFE required\nrespondents to detect ascending concentrations of two\nodors: n-butanol and AND. Concentrations were presented\nin an increasing fashion to reduce the risk that a weaker\nconcentration was made more difficult to detect when pre-\nsented following a stronger concentration for a given odor\n(habituation) (Doty et al., 2003). Creation of the custom\nAND Sniffin' Sticks pens used here has been described pre-\nviously (Lundstr\u00f6m, Hummel, & Olsson, 2003).\nPrior to each olfactory detection task, respondents were\nfirst presented with a pen that contained the strongest odor-\nant concentration in the OFFE. This was done as a neces-\nsary component of psychophysical testing (Hayes & Jinks,\nknew what stimuli they would be asked to detect, before\nthey were actually asked to detect it. Respondents were\nasked if they were able to smell the odor and told explicitly\nthat this is the odor they would be attempting to detect dur-\ning later testing. After presenting the practice target pen, the\nFI recorded the respondent's answer in CAPI and described\nthe instructions for the ensuing task. Similar to psycho-\nphysical testing, this time served as a \"washout\" period to\nallow the nose to recover before testing began. All respond-\nents were administered the n-butanol task regardless of\ntheir self-reported ability to smell the n-butanol practice\ntarget pen.\nThe ability to detect AND as an odor is not a product\nof overall olfactory acuity (Lundstr\u00f6m et al., 2003), and\na genetic component explains this inability to smell AND\n(Keller, Zhuang, Chi, Vosshall, & Matsunami, 2007).\nTherefore, any NSHAP respondent who indicated that they\ncould not smell the AND practice screener pen was not pre-\nsented with the AND detection task to minimize frustration\nand maintain cooperation on ensuing NSHAP survey tasks.\nThe respondent's detection abilities were determined for\neach odor by presenting a series of pens, three at a time. One\npen in each triad contained the target odor while the other\ntwo pens did not. A schematic of the administration method\nis presented in Figure 1. After presenting three pens, the FI\nasked the respondent, \"Which of the three pens contains the\nodor?\" and entered the response into CAPI before going on\nto the next pen triad.\nThe concentrations of n-butanol (see Table 2) were\nselected based on prior research on n-butanol sensitivity\nin this age group in which older adults were found to have\na mean threshold to n-butanol of 0.06% (Hummel, Kobal,\nTable 1. Demographics of the NSHAP Wave 2 Olfaction Subsample\nVariables Weighted mean Range SD N\nAge\nWeighted % N\n African American 9.8\n Hispanic (non-African\nAmerican)\nNotes. NSHAP = National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project.\ntwo respondents had turned 91 by the time of their interview, so for ease of\npresentation the age range is referred to as 62\u00ad90 throughout.\nbAlso includes associates degree or vocational certificate.\nOlfaction Assessment\nGudziol, & Mackay-Sim, 2007). All n-butanol concen-\ntrations in the OFFE are stronger than 0.06% to provide\ngreater ability to detect olfactory dysfunction across the\nspectrum in NSHAP's diverse older adult population.\nData describing AND sensitivity in population-based\nsamples has never, to our knowledge, been previously col-\nlected. Limited threshold testing done in laboratory set-\ntings has indicated that individuals may be split by their\nsensitivity to AND into three groups: (a) individuals who\ncannot smell the odor regardless of strength (i.e., concen-\ntration), (b) individuals who are only able to smell the odor\nat high concentrations, and (c) individuals who are able to\ndetect AND at low concentrations (Lundstr\u00f6m et al., 2003).\nAND concentrations (Table 2) were therefore selected to\nidentify these three groups because detection ability may be\nassociated with social, mental, or physical health outcomes\nthat NSHAP investigates.\nThe odor identification portion of the OFFE is an abbre-\nviated, validated test (Mueller & Renner, 2006) that is\nidentical to the five-odor test previously used in NSHAP\net al., 2009). Respondents were asked to choose the correct\nodor from a set of four word/picture options. The response\noptions for each pen were as follows (correct odor indicated\nin italics): (a) chamomile, raspberry, rose, or cherry; (b)\nsmoke, glue, leather, or grass; (c) orange, blueberry, straw-\nberry, or onion; (d) bread, fish, cheese, or ham; (e) chive,\npeppermint, pine, or onion.\nWhen presenting each pen, the interviewer removed the\ncap and gently waved it approximately 0.5 inches below\nboth nostrils. Respondents were asked to breathe in nor-\nmally through their nose as each pen was presented for\nabout 2 s. FIs wore a cotton glove during administration\nof the OFFE in order to minimize the effects of any odors\nassociated with the interviewer (e.g., lotions, soaps, body\nodors, etc.).\nRespondents were encouraged by the interviewer to do\ntheir best to give an answer, but OFFE tasks did not use\nforced-choice questions and respondents were allowed\nto refuse to answer or respond by indicating that they did\nnot know (following Mueller & Renner, 2006). Although\nforced-choice paradigms are typically used in psychophysi-\ncal testing, they are not feasible in an in-home survey set-\nting where demanding the respondent offer an answer may\nreduce cooperation for other parts of the extensive interview.\nVariable names for the identification task are consist-\nent across NSHAP waves, bluepen_*. n-Butanol and AND\nvariable names were altered between waves to reflect the\nsignificant changes to the measures that occurred in Wave 2\n(redpen_* to redpen2_*; greenpen_* to greenpen2_*).\nData Analysis\nEach OFFE task is scored separately by adding the num-\nber of correct responses for a given task, generating three\nseparate scores. Those respondents who indicated they\ncould not smell AND in the practice screener pen were\nassigned a score of 0 on the AND detection task. A response\nof \"Don't know\" or a refusal was considered incorrect in\neach of the three tasks.\nAnalyses used the number of odors correctly identified or\ndetected as the dependent variable. Ordinal logistic regres-\nsion modeled its relationship with age and gender. Logistic\nregression was used to test the effect of survey wave on\nthe ability to identify odors. Analyses were weighted using\nthe weights, strata, and Primary Sampling Unit indica-\ntors provided with the dataset to account for differential\nprobabilities of selection and differential nonresponse.\nStatistical analyses were conducted with Stata Version 13.1\n(StataCorp. LP).\nTable 2. Concentrations Used for OFFE Detection Tasks\nn-Butanol\n Practice target: 8.0%\nAndrostadienone\n Practice screener: 5.3%\nNote.

In contrast, there were no gender differences\nin the ability to detect n-butanol, a standard testing odorant.\nPrevalence by Subgroup\nMen Women Men Women Men Women\nNumber of AND Concentrations\nCorrectly Detected\nFigure 3.

Prevalence of the number of odors correctly identified overall and by age and gender subgroups for the older adult population of the United States\nOlfaction Assessment\nserve a social role only in the context of reproduction in\nearly adulthood.\nOur results support the need for testing multiple facets of\nolfactory function, odor sensitivity as well as identification.\nWe report well-established gender differences for the odor\nidentification task which required respondents to detect an\nodor as well as the cognitive ability to match it to word-\npicture items. In contrast, for the less cognitively demanding\nn-butanol detection task, we saw no such gender difference.\nThus, when using data from NSHAP, both aspects of olfac-\ntory function should be considered, especially when address-\ning analytical questions where the cognitive demands of the\nodor identification task may serve as a possible confound. In\nthe same vein, when possible, future survey research should\nincorporate multiple measures of olfaction rather than rely-\ning on only one facet of this sensory modality.\nUse of the OFFE in NSHAP Wave 2 is the first success-\nful evaluation of odor detection and sensitivity in a repre-\nsentative survey setting. Wave 1 of NSHAP attempted to\nmeasure respondent olfactory sensitivity by presenting\nincreasing odor concentrations and asking respondents\nto rate the intensity of the odor on a Visual Analog Scale\nstrong). Results were measured in centimeters (range from\n0 to 10). Respondents had difficulty using both a written\nand electronic VAS and the resulting data were inconsistent\nand ultimately uninterpretable.\nUsing triads of odor pens in the Wave 2 detection pro-\ntocols eliminated the difficulties that occurred in Wave\n1. Instead, with the exception of the relatively few responses\nof \"Don't know\" or refusals, Wave 2 participants could\neither accurately detect an odor at a given concentration, or\nthey could not.\nHowever, researchers interested in estimating the preva-\nlence of olfactory abilities based on a true forced-choice\nparadigm that exists elsewhere in the clinical literature for\nthese types of tasks should consider using a technique such\nas multiple imputation to incorporate the \"Don't know\"\nand \"Refused\" responses (e.g., assuming that the respond-\nent, had he or she been forced to choose, would have cho-\nsen from any of the pens with equal probability) (Schafer,\n1999). Researchers should use a 1/3 probability of correctly\ndetecting the target pen in the detection triads or 1/4 prob-\nability for correctly guessing an identification pen.\nResearchers interested in using OFFE data may also wish\nto include other factors known to affect olfactory function.\nThe NSHAP Wave 2 interview documents any severe prior\nhead injuries or nose surgeries. Respondents were also\nasked, \"Today, do you have a head cold or chest cold?\" to\naccount for an olfactory deficit that may have been present\ndue to illness on the day of the interview. Analysts should\nalso consider incorporating data on self-reported smoking\nhistory, current smoking habits, and use of relevant cur-\nrent medications recorded as part of the NSHAP interview.\nThese covariates offer useful information as each may influ-\nence the sense of smell (Doty et al., 1997; Jones & Rog,\nConclusion\nIn NSHAP Wave 2, the use of the OFFE makes possi-\nble for the first time a comprehensive investigation of the\nrelationship between global olfactory function (detection\nability of both standard testing and social odors, as well as\nthe ability to identify odors) and a host of physical, social,\nand mental health outcomes in a representative sample of\nthe older adult population of the United States. Here, we\nshow that olfactory function is worse for older age groups\nfor odor identification, as well as n-butanol and AND detec-\ntion. Women outperformed men on the odor identification\nand AND detection tasks, however there was no gender dif-\nference in the ability to detect n-butanol.\nTable 5.
