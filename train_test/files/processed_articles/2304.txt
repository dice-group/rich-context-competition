Prevention\nof violence is an important public health goal and\nexposure to violence is a risk factor for a variety of\nphysical and mental health conditions, including post-\ntraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).3-5 The vulnerability of\nmigrants during transit between countries,6-8 both from\nand to sending countries, and the risks associated with\nsocial disadvantage in their destination country9 put this\ngroup at a particular risk.\nPrevious studies have focused on exposure to violence\nin refugee populations.10,11 In these populations, expo-\nsures tend to be extremely high, largely due to pre-\nmigration stresses which were the underlying causes of\ndisplacement.12 However, little is known about violence\nexposures among labor migrants, who comprise the large\nmajority of international migrants in the world today. It is\nuncertain whether the immigration process is associated\nwith an increase or decrease in all forms of violence.10,13-16\nOngoing connections between immigrants and the\nfamilies they left behind provide an additional potential\nmechanism for migration to influence suicidality in the\nmigrant-sending populations,17 but there is no prior\nresearch on other forms of intentional violence.\nThis study examines migration and violence in the\ncontext of the largest sustained labor migration in the\nworld today, that between Mexico and the United States.\nMexico is a society that has witnessed a large increase in\nviolence in recent years18,19 as well as an extraordinary\nmigration movement to the U.S.20 We are especially\ninterested in testing whether immigration would increase\nthe likelihood of a first episode of violence in newcomers,\ni.e., first-generation immigrants, because of the uncer-\ntainty and negative life events that may occur in the\nmigration process12 and settlement into a society where\nHispanics in general have a lower socioeconomic status\nthan those of an Anglo ethnicity. On the other hand, we\nmight also expect that with increasing social ties, better\njobs, and educational attainment, all forms of violence\nwould decrease in the second generation, that is, among\nU.S.-born Mexican-Americans. Migration from Mexico to\nthe U.S. has been shown to be associated with large\nincreases in risk for psychiatric disorder,21-23 an established\nrisk factor for exposure to violence,24,25 so that assessment\nCorrespondence: Dr. Guilherme Borges, Departamento de Modelos\nde Intervencio\n\u00b4n, Direccio\n\u00b4n de Investigaciones Epidemiolo\n\u00b4gicas y\nPsicosociales, Instituto Nacional de Psiquiatri\n\u00b4a, Calzada Me\n\u00b4xico\nXochimilco no 101, Col.

In order to test these hypotheses we make use\nof a unique dataset, which includes assessments of timing\nof migration, a large list of violence experiences, and a\nbroad range of psychiatric conditions in population samples\nof the Mexican general population and the U.S population of\nMexican origin.\nOur main goal is to examine the first onset of violence\namong Mexicans and U.S.-born persons of Mexican\norigin residing both in Mexico and the U.S. We took\nadvantage of our study design to consider whether the\nage at migration preceded the age of onset of violence\nand whether a psychiatric disorder increased the like-\nlihood of suffering violence. Our main hypothesis is that,\nwhen compared to Mexicans nationals in Mexico,\nviolence will be higher among Mexican immigrants in\nthe U.S., but lower among U.S.-born persons of Mexican\norigin. Other comparisons of interest among two under-\nstudied groups, the possible increase in violence among\nreturn migrants and family of migrants, will also be\naddressed here.\nMethods\nSample\nWe combined data on 2,362 participants from the\nMexican population who answered questions related to\nviolence from the Mexican National Comorbidity Survey\norigin population in the United States from the closely\nrelated Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys\n(CPES), which included the National Comorbidity Survey\nReplication (NCS-R) and the National Latino and Asian\nAmerican Study (NLAAS).27-29 All surveys follow the\nmethodology of the World Health Organization's World\nMental Health Survey Initiative.30 The combined sample\nis weighted to represent the U.S. Mexican-American\npopulation using weights developed for this purpose.27,31\nFull data on nativity and age at immigration are available\nfor a total of 3,575 respondents from both the U.S. and\nMexico. The response rate for the MNCS was 76.6%,\nthe NLAAS.22,23 Study procedures were approved by the\nInstitutional Review Boards of Harvard Medical School,\nthe University of Michigan, and the National Institute of\nPsychiatry Ramon de la Fuente.\nDefinition of migrant groups\nWe define five mutually exclusive groups representing a\nrange of exposure to the U.S. across this transnational\npopulation23: 1) U.S.-born Mexican-American respon-\ndents; 2) migrants from Mexico; 3) return migrants living\nin Mexico after having spent at least 3 months in the U.S.\nfor work or study; 4) non-migrants in Mexico with a\nmigrant among their immediate family members; and 5)\nnon-migrants in Mexico with no migrant in their family.\nThe first two groups are from the CPES population and\nthe last three groups from the MNCS population.\nAssessment of violence\nThe World Mental Health version of the Composite\nInternational Diagnostic Interview (WMH-CIDI)32 mea-\nsures 21 different lifetime traumatic events, out of which\neight types were considered here as violence-victimiza-\ntion: ever been kidnapped or held hostage; ever been\nbadly beaten by parents; ever been badly beaten up by\nspouse or romantic partner; ever been beaten up by\nanyone else; ever been mugged, held up, or threatened\nwith a weapon; ever been raped; ever been sexually\nassaulted (other than rape); and ever been stalked. We\nstudied here only the first episode of these traumatic\nevents.\nAssessment of other covariates\nAnalyses also used sociodemographic information col-\nlected in the WMH-CIDI on gender, age, marital status,\neducation, and DSM-IV psychiatric disorders, categorized\nas any mood disorder (major depressive disorder and\ndysthymia) and any anxiety disorder (panic disorder,\nagoraphobia without panic disorder, social phobia, gen-\neralized anxiety disorder and PTSD), any substance use\ndisorders (alcohol abuse, drug abuse, alcohol depen-\ndence with abuse, and drug dependence with abuse),\nand conduct disorder. A term for any mental disorder was\nadded as a control variable in all models that estimated\nthe risk of violence for the five migration groups. Given\nthe importance of mental disorder as a possible risk factor\nby itself, we included the estimates for this term in the\nfinal models presented below. This term represents the\nrisk of suffering violence (any violence and by type) for\nthose with a mental disorder compared to those without a\nmental disorder, and it is adjusted for the migration\ngroups.\nStatistical analysis\nWe used a design-based statistical analysis strategy for\npoint and variance estimates and hypothesis testing,\nusing standard survey data analysis procedures to\naccount for design effects arising from the use of\nstratification, clustering and unequal selection probabil-\nities in the component surveys.33 We used weights\ndeveloped by CPES biostatisticians34 for use in design-\nbased analyses that combine the NCS-R and NLAAS to\nestimate that a total 15.76 million Mexican Americans\nwere in the U.S. sampling frame.34 The Mexican\nsampling frame does not overlap with the U.S. sampling\nframe, so in the combined sample we treated each frame\nas separate domains for purposes of design-based\nvariance estimation.33,35 Hence, we calibrated the\nMNCS weights to represent 40.6 million individuals,\nbased on the estimated number of 18 to 65 years old\nlived in households in towns . 2,500 inhabitants in the\nMexican Census of the Populations and Households,\nWe used a discrete-time event history analysis with\ntime-varying covariates, implemented using a discrete\nproportional hazards regression model on a dataset with\nG Borges et al.\nperson-years as the units of analysis,37-39 to study\nvariation in risk of first onset of violence across the five\nmigration groups defined above while statistically adjust-\ning for covariates. The main outcomes that we studied\nwere lifetime violence-victimization (any and by type of\nviolence). The key predictor is immigration group, in five\ncategories. The person-years analyses allow us to take\naccount of the temporal ordering of migration, onset of\npsychiatric disorders, and first occurrence of violence of\nspecific types38 and to use design-based estimation\nmethods to account for survey design effects.33 Our\nuse of discrete time event history analyses38 relied on\nretrospective age-at-onset reports to establish a temporal\norder between the predictors and the outcomes. Design-\nbased standard errors for logistic regression coefficients\nand for pairwise contrasts between them were estimated\nusing the Taylor linearization method40 with SUDAAN\nsignificance and for producing 95% confidence intervals\n(95%CI) for adjusted hazard ratios.\nResults\nWhile the families of migrants and the Mexicans living in\nMexico without a migrant experience or a migrant relative\n(Mexican population for short) have larger proportions of\nfemales than males, the opposite is true for the other\nthree groups, especially the return migrants (Table 1).\nThe U.S.-born population has the largest proportion of\nrespondents in the older group, while the families of\nmigrants and the Mexican population tend to be much\nyounger and the current migrants are more concentrated\nin the middle years.\nTable 2 shows the lifetime prevalence of any violence\nand violence by type, for the total population and\nseparately for males and females. Starting with the total,\nabout 43.6% reported any experience of violence, with\nthe highest prevalence of any violence found among the\nreturn migrants (51.7%) and the lowest among the\ncurrent immigrants from Mexico (31.8%), with the\nMexican population in the middle (41.6%). In all groups,\nthe most common experience was ever mugged, held up\nor threatened with a weapon, and in most groups, the\nleast common was ever kidnapped or held hostage.\nMales were only slightly more likely to report any violence\nences in the prevalence by type of violence experienced\nwere found for male and female groups. Among males,\nbeing mugged, held up, or threatened with a weapon and\nbeing badly beaten up by anyone else was much more\ncommon than among females, who were in turn more\nlikely to experience being beaten up by a spouse or\nromantic partner and violence of a sexual nature.\nWe present a survival curve of one of the most\ncommon outcomes with a middle and early-age of initial\nvictimization, i.e., rape (Figure 1), for which an unex-\npected result was found. Here, the U.S. born group was\nthe most affected, followed by the Mexican population\nand the current migrants in the U.S. (with current\nimmigrants showing rape rates that followed those of\nU.S.-born among females, data not shown).\nConsidering all violence types together among current\nimmigrants, most events (60.9%) occurred before migra-\ntion, especially because most cases of being beaten by\nparents and being raped occurred while in Mexico\n(Table 3). On the other hand, most of the violence from\nbeing kidnapped, beaten up by a partner, threatened with\na weapon and stalked happened after immigration.\nTable 4 presents the results of survival models that\nestimate differences in risk for violence across immigration\ngroups, adjusted for sex, age and any mental disorder, for\nthe total population and separately for males and females.\nThe variable any mental disorder was introduced in this\nmultiple regression equation as a time-varying dummy\nvariable, in which those without a mental disorder are the\nreference group. Marital status and education were also\nconsidered as possible confounders, but did not affect the\nestimates for migration groups and psychiatric disorders\nand were dropped from the final model for simplicity and to\nobtain more stable estimates. The reference group for all\ncomparisons was the Mexican population living in Mexico\nwithout migrant experience or a migrant relative. A similar\nmodel was also fitted separately by sex and we tested for\nthe presence of interactions. In two instances we could not\nfit an interaction term (for ever badly beaten up by spouse\nor romantic partner and for ever raped, neither of which\nhad occurred to males in some of the immigrant\ncategories) and in all other instances no significant\ninteraction term was found. We therefore focus here on\nthe results for the total sample.\nTable 1 Population characteristics by migrant groups (Mexican sample from the MNCS-CPES, n=3,575), n (%)\nU.S. born with Mexican\nMigrant in U.S.\nReturn migrant\nFamily migrant\nNo family migrant\nSex*\nAge*\nMNCS = Mexican National Comorbidity Survey; CPES = Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys.\nWeighted percentages.\nMexican immigration and violence 163\nTable 2 Prevalence of assaultive violence by migration groups and sex (Mexican sample from the MNCS-CPES, n=3,575),\nn (%)\nU.S. born with\nMexican\nMigrant in\nU.S.\nReturn\nmigrant\nFamily\nmigrant\nNo family\nmigrant\nTotal\nTotal\nMales\nFemales\nMNCS = Mexican National Comorbidity Survey; CPES = Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys.\nWeighted percentages.\nFigure 1 Survival function of ever been raped according to migration status in the MNCS-CPES, 2001-2003.

The U.S. born had increased risk for all violence of\nsexual nature, but was less likely to suffer from being\nbeaten by parents. Immigrants currently in the U.S. were\nless likely to report ever mugged, held up or threatened\nwith a weapon and being beaten by parents. The return\nmigrants were less likely to be beaten up by a romantic\npartner, but more likely to suffer from being held hostage\nand for being beaten by anyone else. The families of\nmigrants were more likely to have ever been beaten by\nparents, but less likely to have ever been beaten up by a\nromantic partner.\nIn all models from Table 4, a term for any mental\ndisorder was introduced and was associated with higher\nrisk of any violence with a hazard ratio of 2.3 (1.9-2.7) for\nthe total population. For the total population, those with a\nmental disorder also had higher risk for all specific types of\nviolence, with odds ratios ranging from 1.8 (1.4-2.2) for the\nrisk of ever mugged, held up or threatened with a weapon\nDiscussion\nWe found violence to be quite common among this\npopulation, in both males and females, but with some\nimportant differences in the type of violence by sex.\nSecondly, although violence was associated with immi-\ngration, the nature of this association varied across the\nspecific type of violence. Contrary to our expectations,\nexposure to violence tended to be lower rather than\nhigher among the current immigrant group and higher\nrather than lower among the U.S. born of Mexican origin.\nThird, we found that having a mental disorder was a\npredictor of exposure to violence victimization throughout\nthis population.\nOur overall prevalence (43.6%) for violence was much\nhigher than the one reported in a large metropolitan U.S.\ncity3 (37.7%) or the prevalences reported recently for five\nethnic groups in the U.S. population, which ranged from\nhigher prevalences in our survey, with one exception.42\nThe U.S. born in our sample reported a higher prevalence\nof rape than those of previous American surveys,24,43\nincluding the Hispanic population in Roberts et al.13 The\nreasons for such high prevalence are not immediately\napparent, but differences in survey methodologies,\ndefinitions of violence, location of surveys, and timing of\ninquiry should also be considered.\nWe did not corroborate our main hypothesis that\nidentified current immigrants in the U.S. as the group\nmost prone to suffer violence. In fact, our findings suggest\nthat current Mexican immigrants in the U.S. are less\naffected by all sorts of violent acts, especially those that in\nMexico are common during early childhood (child\nmaltreatment) and the middle years (mugged, held up,\nor threatened with a weapon); at the same time, they are\nunlikely to have experienced sexual violence, which\nbecomes surprisingly common among the second gen-\neration of Mexican-Americans. Though surprising, this\nfinding is consistent with those from a study of a diverse\nHispanic sample in South Florida.45 The experience of\nviolence among the Mexican immigrant groups, pre- and\npost-migration, has been linked to their rates of sub-\nstance use in the U.S.,45,46 suggesting that lower levels of\ntraumatic experience among immigrant females of\nMexican origin may be related to the low prevalence\nof substance use disorders in this group. An analysis of\nthe possible impact of the immigration experience on\ndisorders such as depression22 or substance use,23\ncontrolling for specific types of violence, is beyond the\nscope of the present paper, but clearly a promising\navenue for future research. Our second hypothesis, that\nU.S.-born respondents of Mexican origin would have\nlower rates of violence when compared to Mexican\nnationals in Mexico, was only corroborated for being a\nvictim of parental violence. Five of eight forms of violence\nwere increased among this group. One of the most\nsurprising results of our survey was the high risk for\nviolence of a sexual nature among the U.S.-born of\nMexican origin. It is interesting that national results13\nsuggest that Hispanics have lower rates of unwanted sex\ncompared to Whites, and we add now that second-\ngeneration Mexicans may be approaching the rates seen\namong Whites, with consequences for the future occur-\nrence of PTSD, among other mental consequences of\nvictimization. The reasons associated with this increase\nin such an extreme form of violence in the second\ngeneration are unknown, and we can only speculate on\nsuch causes at this moment. A driving idea among\nMexican nationals is that immigration to the U.S. will bring\na better standard of living and a more secure environment\nfor those settling in the U.S. Our results do not coincide\nwholly with this idea, as those settling in the U.S. may be\nat greater risk than Mexicans in Mexico.\nThose immigrants that return to their home country and\nthe families that the immigrants leave back home are\ntraditionally understudied groups in migration and mental\nhealth research, because data from sending countries are\nnecessary but seldom available. The lack of other studies\nfocusing on these groups precludes comparison of our\nresults, but we can nevertheless point to main findings\nand avenues for future work. Return migrants in Mexico\nare a vulnerable group for victimization such as kidnap-\nping and being beaten, as we showed here, and this\nshould be a great concern to Mexican public health\nauthorities and those responsible for violent crimes in the\ncountry. The perception that those immigrants are, by\nMexican standards, a wealthy group that brings with them\nfinancial resources after a life of hard work in the U.S.\nmay put this group at high risk of being targeted by\norganized crime, as their high rate of being beaten by a\nstranger also suggests. We also showed that the relatives\nof migrants are more likely to show violence to their\nchildren, and that this violence itself may be related to the\nmigration process when deciding within the family which\nof its members will emigrate.47 The dynamics of these\nfamilies and the decision process that culminates in\nchoosing the family member that will migrate are usually\nseen solely as an economic process, but subjective\nreasons are also at play, as this work has shown.\nG Borges et al.\nIt is well known that the occurrence of violence may\nlead to PTSD3 and other forms of psychopathology,42,48\nsuch as depression,49 substance abuse,50 and suicid-\nality,51 and violent events such as rape and sexual abuse\nmay also impact an array of mental disorders.52 On the\nother hand, serious mental disorders have been shown to\nincrease the risk for violent victimization, such as that\nstudied here.53 Other more common forms of psycho-\npathology, such as drug use disorders, are associated\nwith lifestyles that may put someone at increased risk of\nsuffering from violence such as being beaten up or\nthreatened with a weapon,49,54 and alcohol use and\nalcohol use disorders are associated with all sorts of\naccidents and violence-related death.55,56 Our results\nsomehow extend the findings from Hiday54 on victimiza-\ntion among persons with serious mental disorders such\nas psychosis, but are unique in that we used a large\nseries of other, more common mental disorders. These\ndisorders are not usually thought to be associated with\nincreased personal vulnerability, but we showed that they\nare related to most forms of victimization when taking into\naccount whether the disorder precedes the occurrence of\nviolence. Models to explain why psychopathology may be\nrelated to violence are complex,57 and digging into the\nspecific link between each disorder and the occurrence of\neach form of violence is beyond the scope of this paper,\nbut our results clearly show that mental disorders may\nhave a broad negative consequence for this population.\nMonitoring the safety of patients with these common\nmental disorders should also be an important task in\nclinical settings and among professionals dealing with\ntheir re-insertion into the community.\nThe limitations of this survey are worth mentioning.\nFirst, these analyses used data on retrospectively\nreported ages of first occurrence of experiences of\nviolence that are subject to recall error, which probably\nmeans that the results we report are conservative.\nMultiple episodes of violence, sometimes referred to as\nchronic violence, are not covered in this report. Second,\nretrospective data on the exact ages at immigration and\nreturn migration are lacking in the MNCS, which limited\nour ability to more fully model the relative timing of\noutcomes and exposure in these subgroups. Third, the\nMNCS sampling frame did not include the most rural\nparts of the country, which lessens the representative-\nness of the MNCS target population for the entire source\npopulation of Mexican immigrants to the U.S., limiting our\nability to control for pre-migration factors. Fourth, despite\nusing the same diagnostic interview, both surveys\ndiffered in several ways, including the auspices of the\nsurvey. We cannot rule out the possibility that these\nmethodological differences contributed to the observed\ndifferences in prevalence estimates of violence in the\nCPES compared to the MNCS. A special concern is the\nreport of sexual-related violence and whether females in\nMexico would experience and report some less extreme\nforms of sexual aggressions and coercions as violence\nagainst themselves. The fact that forms of severe\nviolence, including rape, that are equally prosecuted in\nMexico and the U.S. are still more reported among the\nU.S.-born lead us to believe that differential reporting of\nless extreme forms of sexual violence, if present, should\nnot account for all of our findings here. Finally, Mexican\nmigration to the U.S. is driven by economic reasons and\nthe search for a better standard of living, and whether our\nresults could be applied to other samples of migrants,\nhomeless, and displaced persons is a matter for further\nstudies.\nDespite these limitations, we found that the impact of\nimmigration on the occurrence of violence is more\ncomplex than usually believed, with differences across\nmigration groups varying across different types of\nviolence. Each migration group should be targeted for\nspecific interventions for reducing specific forms of\nviolence, but, at the same time, all members of this\npopulation with a prior mental disorder should be a focus\nof interventions.\n"
