    "abstract": "Abstract\nSome philosophers even recently have been skeptical about whether science can reveal anything significant about art.\nAlthough some scientists' ventures into art theory have seemed to warrant such suspicions, including early speculative forays\ninto neuroaesthetics, against such skepticism, the argument here is that neuroaesthetics is crucial for understanding aesthetic\nexperience and ultimately art itself. Because certain core proposals of early versions of neuroaesthetics (e.g., the art-as-\ncaricature thesis) seem to justify this skepticism and yet, at the same time, prove more defensible than they might initially\nseem, they are ideal illustrations of how neuroaesthetics at a more abstract level dovetails with the philosophy of art, and so\nprovides a complementary, not competing perspective that can help complete, verify, and defend such philosophical theories.\nIn particular, it is proposed that aesthetic experience involves a distinctive corticolimbic response, that such experience is\ntherefore testable and may be found even with so-called anti-art, and that its value consists in resolution of conflict between\nthe higher cortex and limbic system generated by the evolution of the former.\n",

As characteristically part of or accom-\npanying the production and enjoyment of artworks, aesthetic\nexperience is one particularly rewarding type of experience\nin which personal and theoretical interest are understandable.\nThis paper aims to identify the potential of neuroaesthetics to\ncontribute to philosophically motivated investigations of art\nand to critically evaluate and undermine skepticism about\nsuch contributions. In particular, it is proposed that aesthetic\nexperience involves a distinctive corticolimbic response, that\nsuch experience is therefore testable and may be found even\nwith so-called anti-art, and that its value consists in resolu-\ntion of conflict between the higher cortex and limbic system\ngenerated by the evolution of the former.\nThe term \"neuroaesthetics\" (minus the \"a\" and hyphen-\nated) appears to have been coined by the neuroscientist\nSemir Zeki (1999). Published the very same year as Zeki's\nInner Vision was a special issue of The Journal of\nConsciousness Studies whose target article, by the neurosci-\nentist V. S. Ramachandran and philosopher William Hirstein\n(1999), fomented enough controversy to spawn two special-\nissue sequels. Although the field has grown and developed\nsignificantly since then (e.g., see Skov & Vartanian, 2009),\nthe focus here will be on these earlier attempts because of\ntheir comparatively broad scope and clearer relevance to the\nskepticism addressed. Still, it is neuroaesthetics generally\nthat is central here, as both these illustrative cases appear to\njustify philosophical skepticism about neuroaesthetics yet\nreveal the potential contribution of neuroaesthetics, in some\nform or the other, to the philosophy of art. Such use seems\nconsistent with Ramachandran's (2001) own assessment\n(p. 28) of \"The Science of Art\" as suggesting the form a final\ntheory might take. The argument is that not only does skepti-\ncism about neuroaesthetics prove false, its target might yield\nthe necessary bridge between traditional philosophy of art\nand a robust, insightful, truly interdisciplinary aesthetics. Art\nhistory is tangential to this direction of argument, but the his-\ntory of philosophical aesthetics, of art theory in this sense, is\nnot. This is not to say that anthropology and art history,\namong other areas, will not contribute to a complete theoreti-\ncal picture of art (see, for example, respectively, Dissanayake,\nthe particular, often divisive tension between philosophy and\nneuroscience in theorizing about art.\nThe controversy spurred by Ramachandran and Hirstein\n(1999) among some philosophers had a threefold cause: the\nauthors' temerity in suggesting that theory of art might ben-\nefit from neuroscience (and might be stymied by neglecting\nit), comfort in making sweeping claims of perhaps uncertain\nscope under the heading \"8 laws of aesthetic experience\"\n1Acadia University, Wolfville, Nova Scotia, Canada\nCorresponding Author:\nJason Holt, School of Recreation Management & Kinesiology, Acadia\nUniversity, 550 Main Street, Wolfville, Nova Scotia, B4P 2R6, Canada.\nEmail: jason.holt@acadiau.ca\nNeuroaesthetics and Philosophy\nJason Holt1\n Keywords\nneuroaesthetics, aesthetics, experience, art, philosophy\n2 SAGE Open\nent na\u00efvet\u00e9 in attempting the task without perhaps knowing\nenough about art. E. H. Gombrich's (2000) commentary is a\nsingle 12-line paragraph, cuttingly dismissive: \"Even a fleet-\ning visit to one of the great museums might serve to convince\nthe authors that few of the exhibits conform to the laws of art\nthey postulate\" (p. 17). The first special issue contained\nunderstandably eager and wide-ranging objections (Baars,\npromptedclarificationsandrefinements(e.g.,Ramachandran,\nuntapped riches in the original paper. For instance, Tyler\n(1999) rightly observes that the principle of perceptual\nproblem-solving (one of the 8 laws), though glossed over to\nthe point of neglect in \"The Science of Art,\" is perhaps the\nprinciple that might be of most interest to artists themselves;\nin perceptual problem-solving there is an isomorphism\nbetween the artist's process of creating the visual \"puzzle\" of\nthe work and the viewer's experience of \"solving\" it. It is in\nsuch a spirit that this article is written.\nThe importance of exploring the potential of neuroaes-\nthetics for aiding understanding of not only aesthetic experi-\nence, which is plausible enough on its face, but the nature of\nart, which might not be as plausible a connection, is reflected\nin the present state of the art of philosophical aesthetics.\nibles, which focused on what distinguishes art (e.g., Andy\nWarhol's Brillo Boxes) from perceptually indistinguishable\nnon-art (e.g., ordinary Brillo boxes), attention shifted away\nfrom the earlier view that art is indefinable to theories pur-\nporting to give necessary and sufficient conditions for art by\nfocusing on the relations between artist and artwork in the\nfirst instance and artwork and audience in the second.\nAlthough objections have since resurfaced (e.g., Gaut, 2000)\nto the view that it is these relations, in some form or the\nother, in which the essence of art is located, present theories\nof art proceed for the most part on this assumption. Disputes\nin art theory center instead on the kinds of relation on which\nart status depends: whether (a) historical, (b) institutional, or\n(c) functional (for \"functional\" read \"psychological,\" and for\n\"psychological\" read \"aesthetic\"). Historical and institu-\ntional views--which define art in terms of earlier artworks\nand the institution of the artworld, respectively--are appar-\nently inadequate not only for standard reasons (circularity,\nnominalism, etc.), but also because proponents of such views\ntions, have had to effectively abandon necessary and suffi-\ncient conditions for art by giving alternative, ad hoc accounts\nin problematic cases (specifically the case of first art, which\nlacks historical precedent and precedes the artworld itself).\nAs importantly, appealing to art's psychological/aesthetic\nproperties opens the door to explanations of how historical\nprecedence and artworld agency occur (see Iseminger, 2004).\nThe stakes, then, are far greater than what natural curiosity\nthere might be, and should be, in the \"mere\" neurological\nprofile of art. If psychological/aesthetic accounts are the\nmost promising among competing theories of art, then the\ncontribution of neuroaesthetics will be absolutely crucial in\ndiscovering the underlying nature of aesthetic experience\nand in finally uncovering the nature of art itself.\nThe next section will outline different sources of skepti-\ncism about the potential role of neuroaesthetics in contribut-\ning significantly to the philosophy of art, showing how\nscientists'ventures into art theory seem to confirm these sus-\npicions, and how philosophers themselves likewise have\nfallen short (shared narrowness of vision being to blame).\nThere will follow an account of how Ramachandran and\nHirstein's proposal, despite its apparent problems, dovetails\nelegantly, and to mutual benefit, with a certain long-standing\ntradition in philosophical aesthetics. It will also be argued\nthat this blend of neuroscience and traditional aesthetics has\nthe potential to defeat the skeptic on all three fronts (the rel-\nevance of neuroscience to art theory, the existence of aes-\nthetic experience as such, the central importance of aesthetic\nexperience to the philosophy of art), thus tackling the nature\nof art from a wide interdisciplinary stance.\nNarrow Vision?\nWhether expressly so or merely by implication, many phi-\nlosophers are skeptical about whether neuroaesthetics has\nanything significant to offer theories of art or aesthetic expe-\ncism about the role neuroaesthetics might play in contribut-\ning anything to the philosophy of art. This section will\ndistinguish these three forms of skepticism and show how\nscientists' ventures into art theory, and philosophers' ven-\ntures into science for art theory's sake, in some cases seem to\nconfirm such skepticism. It will also argue that this perspec-\ntive is rather short-sighted.\nThe most obvious type of skepticism relevant here stems\nfrom broad misgivings many philosophers have had about\nwhether empirical questions or findings can have any bear-\ning on philosophical theory: the view that philosophy is\nstrictly an armchair discipline. Although this \"resistance to\nfacts\" seems to have been overcome in the philosophy of the\nnatural and social sciences, traditional domains in the arts\nand humanities--philosophy of art, saliently--have proved\nmore resistant, probably because--the \"social\" in \"social\nsciences\" aside--of the suspicion that truly and distinctively\ncultural phenomena lie beyond the long arm of scientific\nreach, that scientific approaches are too low-level to reveal\nwhat is desirable to know about art and aesthetic response\nThis seems a mild version of the unfortunate trend now pop-\nular in the humanities to consider everything, and not just\neverything social, \"social.\" The trend is evident even when it\ncomes to pure descriptive questions such as \"What is art?\"\nbecause such questions in particular often seem tightly if not\ninextricably tied up with questions of value, not just psycho-\nlogical value but cultural meaning. Whether or not \"art\" has\na pure descriptive sense, the banishment of science from this\ndomain is held to be a principled one, Zeki's neologism\n\"neuroaesthetics\" an affront, on this view, to good sense and\ngood taste.\nA second type of skepticism derives, not from the belief\nthat science is ill-equipped or intrusive, but rather from anti-\nrealism about aesthetic experience. Perhaps science can\nreveal a lot about art, perhaps not, but allowing that one\nshould quantify over experiences (after all, one might deny\nthat consciousness exists), aspersions have been cast on the\nvery term \"aesthetic,\" because, it is argued, it fails to desig-\nnate a legitimate experiential kind, as there seems to be noth-\ning common and peculiar to aesthetic experiences (Davies,\nare various arguments to the effect that the notion of a disin-\nterested aesthetic attitude, a peculiar aesthetic faculty, or a\ndistinctive aesthetic kind of perception, are at best irremedi-\nably vague, at middling susceptible to standard sorts of\nargument-from-oddness objections, and at worst, most simply,\nincoherent. The usual diagnosis (though note Shusterman's,\n1997, cogent reply to such concerns) is that the very concept\nof the aesthetic is the culprit, the prescription to eliminate it\nfrom strict discourse about art, and the implication a fortiori\nthat neuroaesthetics on pain of recasting is a nonstarter.\nA third type of skepticism might allow scientific input\ninto the realm of art theory, and might even include the aes-\nthetic as a legitimate type of experience, but nonetheless\ntakes its cue from rival perspectives on art: historicism,\ninstitutionalism, as well as antiessentialism (the view that\nart cannot be defined). If any of these is correct, and the first\ntwo can withstand the objections mentioned earlier, includ-\ning obviation of the \"explanatory reduction\" briefly\nsketched, then neuroaesthetics will have little to say about\nthe nature of art. Note that it could still contribute much,\nmore narrowly, to theories of the aesthetic, in which case it\nwould still be a worthy, if more modest, endeavor. It would\nbe appropriate to note that historicist and institutional views\nof art are often motivated by a rejection of the aesthetic as a\nunifying, universal concept for art (see Davies, 1991, for the\ngeneral concern, Brown & Dissanayake, 2009, for the\nneuroaesthetics-specific concern). Cases of the so-called\nanti-art, or antiaesthetic art, the paradigm case of which is\nDuchamp's Fountain (a urinal pseudonymously signed and\npresented in an art gallery), which allegedly counts as art\nand flouts the aesthetic, are usually adduced to show how art\nand the aesthetic pull apart.\nSuch skepticism about the potential contribution of neu-\nroaesthetics to the philosophy of art finds some support in\ncertain work by scientists treading in such unfamiliar terri-\ntory. Take Zeki's (1999) Inner Vision, which was mentioned\nat the outset and in which such claims are made (the first\nfiguratively apt, perhaps, but quite literally put) that artists\nare neuroscientists (pp. 2, 10) and that all art aims at provid-\ning knowledge (pp. 9-10). Zeki also goes to great lengths in\nestablishing, for instance, that without the brain area respon-\nsible for color vision (V4), one cannot appreciate the color of\na painting, that without the brain area responsible for per-\nceiving motion (MT or V5), one cannot fully appreciate\nkinetic artworks like mobiles. To a philosopher of art, no\ndoubt, such elaborations come off as misguided in the first\ncase and rather trivial (not neuroscientifically trivial but,\ngiven the neuroscience, aesthetically trivial) in the second.\nAs will be seen, similar concerns are raised likewise by some\nof the assertions made by Ramachandran and Hirstein.\nTo forestall needless proliferation of instances, let these\nsuffice for now, save to observe that in most cases, and this\napplies no less to philosophers who draw on, or simply give\nlip service to, scientific research, here lies an unfortunate\nnarrowness of vision. Even where more interesting and use-\nful work is done (in linking visual ambiguity with interpre-\ntive openness, for instance), not only is there an excess of\nbottom-up material, it comes off as omitting the \"up.\" Some\ntop-down work, or at least top-with-an-eye-to-down work,\nseems necessary, as most interdisciplinary inquiry in this\narea, whether by scientists or philosophers, concerns chiefly\nvisual art and the visual system, with scarcely a mention or\nother (nonvisual) art forms, other sense modalities, or the\npossibility of commonalities in aesthetic response across\nvarious art forms. Of course, music will excite the auditory\ncortex rather than the visual, but what might responses to\nmusic and responses to painting have in common, perhaps in\ndifferent cortices, perhaps in common structures further\ndown the line? Whither breadth of vision?--or breadth\nbeyond vision? Perhaps surprisingly, in the answer to this\nquestion one begins to glimpse the greatest contribution to\nthe philosophy of art that neuroaesthetics might make.\nA Tradition's Cutting Edge\nThis section will directly engage Ramachandran and\nHirstein's (1999) \"The Science of Art\" as an illustrative case\nto argue that, its apparent shortcomings aside, neuroaesthet-\nics meshes well at an abstract level with aesthetics of a more\ntraditional philosophical style, and so might just provide\ninsight into not only the underlying nature of aesthetic expe-\nrience but also the ultimate nature of art itself. Discussion\nwill continue to be confined to chiefly philosophical\nconcerns.\nOn the surface, despite one of the authors being a philoso-\npher, \"The Science of Art\" reads like many other attempts by\nscientists to engage in art theory. There are the expected prob-\nlematic pronouncements, such as, without qualification, that\nall art is beautiful (without disambiguating the beauty of the\ndepiction from the beauty of the thing depicted)--which is\nsuggested (Ramachandran & Hirstein, 1999) if not explicitly\nmade--and stranger, that all art is caricature, without address-\ning such obvious counterexamples as, say, photorealistic\n4 SAGE Open\npainting. The puzzling caricature principle derives from\nemphasis placed throughout the article on what is called the\n\"peak shift\" effect, a tendency to respond more intensely to\nexaggerated versions of stimuli that humans are geared,\nthrough habit or reward, to discriminate typically. If a person\nis discriminating rectangles from squares, say, they will tend\nto respond much more intensely to an elongated (thus exag-\ngerated) rectangle. The fact that stimulus novelty generates\nsuch response stresses the importance of the internal mecha-\nnisms involved.\nThe peak shift effect is labeled one of the \"laws of aes-\nthetic experience,\" along with perceptual grouping and bind-\ning, attention allocation, contrast extraction, perceptual\nproblem-solving, the generic viewpoint principle, and--odd\nas these may seem in rounding out the list--metaphor, and\nsymmetry (repetition/rhythm and balance are added to the\nslightly altered list of Ramachandran, 2003). The diversity of\nthis list, the non-lawlike formulations of its \"laws,\" and their\nambiguous scope, have been cause for concern, although\nappreciated in some cases, among philosophers of a certain\nmindset.\nAlthough these more philosophical misgivings do not\nscratch the surface of criticisms made from other disciplines\n(as one may reasonably expect), the focus here will be on the\nmore philosophically central issues. Many of the claims\nabout which philosophers would rightly be prima facie skep-\ntical can actually be given more deservedly defensible inter-\npretations. First, the claim that all art is beautiful will strike\nmany philosophers of art as absurd--when \"beautiful\" is\ninterpreted naturalistically--because where much art depicts\nthe beautiful, much of it also depicts the ugly, and so forth:\nBotticelli's Venus is one thing, Goya's Saturn another. Add to\nthis that much postmodern art deliberately flouts any tradi-\ntional notion of beauty (Western or Eastern), and it is clear\nwhy many philosophers will too quickly dismiss the claim\nthat all art is beautiful. However, if art is deemed beautiful in\nthe sense that it provokes pleasurable aesthetic response,\nthen the claim seems much more plausible, and is not so easy\nto dismiss. Still, Ramachandran and Hirstein seem to prefer\nthe more standard interpretation of \"beautiful,\" which\nremains open to this criticism except insofar as, despite their\nclaims to universality, their proposals are meant to apply\nonly to beautiful art in the narrower sense.\nSecond, the caricature principle (that all art is caricature)\ncould be given a similarly charitable reading. Abstract art is\na caricature insofar as, by definition, it is abstracted from,\nhence serves in that sense as a caricature of, ordinary experi-\nence and representations of it. Not so with realistic represen-\ntations, however, as a photorealistic painting is certainly no\ncaricature in the way that most political cartoons are. In fact,\nRamachandran (2003) is quite explicit about realistic repre-\nsentation, in a snapshot, say, ruling the representation out of\nthe artwork class. The implications for a host of realistic\nartworks--much artistic photography, photorealistic painting,\nand so on--is distressing. It seems Ramachandran here sells\nhis theory short, in that realistic depictions can be interpreted,\nand quite straightforwardly, as caricatures in some relevant\nsense. Take photorealistic painting. Though not a typical cari-\ncature, to be sure, a photorealistic painting is importantly dif-\nferent, \"abstracted,\" from ordinary experience in one very\nimportant way: by freezing time. In presenting a frozen\ntimeslice of a limited perspective, the visual display in a pho-\ntorealistic painting has, in a sense, made a caricature of the\ndepicted scene, which does not really stand still (and is not\nreally flat, either). Realism should apply as much in four\ndimensions as in three.\nAlthough such an interpretation is possible, it is perhaps\nimplausible to attribute it to the authors who, after all, sought\nto provoke further discussion more than settle theoretical\nmatters outright. Even so, it is instructive to realize that \"The\nScienceofArt\"mighthavebettermileagethanRamachandran\nand Hirstein had hoped. Clearly, some of its provocative\nclaims have yet to be fully appreciated (even by\nRamachandran himself) for their defensibility, as has been\nshown, or their potential philosophical significance, as will\nbe shown.\nTwo important themes emerge from the provocative dis-\ncussion in \"The Science of Art.\" The first theme is well\nexpressed in the article's guiding question: \"Might there be\nsome sort of universal rule or `deep structure' underlying all\n[aesthetic] experience? . . . What is the brain circuitry\ninvolved?\" (p. 16). Not only does this question give the right\nbreadth of perspective so desperately lacking in much work\nof this ilk, it indicates that certain crucial questions about the\naesthetic (whether there is such a thing, for one) might just\nadmit of answers that can be sought empirically, getting\nbeyond what often appears as intuition-haggling or question-\nbegging in the philosophy of art. (Ramachandran, 2003,\nseems to think that philosophy is inherently this way, and so\ncannot discover universal laws, much less testable ones--\notherwise philosophers would simply be scientists, as though\nthe philosophy of art were only good science or bad art\nhistory.)\nThe second theme, an implicit one, is an apparent com-\nmonality lurking beneath the \"8 laws\" that begins, when\nabstractly formulated, to resemble far more familiar aesthetic\ntheory than may at first appear: in aesthetic experience (as in\npeak shift) there is a special, more intense response than in\nordinary experience, a relationship of special reinforcement\nbetween distinct parts of the brain: the limbic system (spa-\ntially lower, evolutionarily older, more emotional) and the\ncortex (spatially higher, evolutionarily newer, more intellec-\nvalue of aesthetic experience, especially against a back-\nground commitment to the hypothesis that the explosive evo-\nlution of the neocortex resulted in the human psyche being\ntypified by deep conflict between reason and emotion\nThe notion of aesthetic experience as consisting in a dis-\ntinctive corticolimbic relation, though suggested in \"The\nScience of Art,\" is not given much notice there, even though\nthe idea suggests much greater universality--which the\nauthors prize above all--than the 8 (and later 10) principles\nthemselves. Nor is mention made that this unified view,\nrather than competing, in fact complements more traditional\nart theory, particularly a certain tradition in theorizing about\naesthetic experience, a tradition that can be seen in Beardsley\nof, among others, Richards, Ogden, and Wood (1925, pp.\n75-77), where aesthetic experience is viewed as a harmoni-\nous \"synaesthesis\" between the intellect and the emotions.\nThese 20th-century analytic philosophers' views find prece-\ndence in 19th-century Continental philosophy: Schiller's\n(2004) notion of aesthetic experience as \"equipoise\" between\nNietzsche's (1967) idea of the \"fraternal union\" of Apollo\nand Dionysus (p. 132) can be seen as a similar view in more\nsymbolic garb. The corticolimbic relationship suggested by\n\"The Science of Art,\" then, appears to account, even if not\nintended to, for how aesthetic experience, as given by such\nphilosophical descriptions, is implemented in the brain--\nagain, a complementary, not a competing, approach.\nThis complementarity with philosophy is encouraging,\nrevealing neuroaesthetics to be far broader, and far more\npowerful, than it often appears and its critics suppose. Not\nonly is there the potential for a unified theory of aesthetic\nexperience across sense modalities here, the hypothesis of\naesthetic experience having a corticolimbic signature implies\nthe possibility of testing for such experience, even in the case\nof so-called anti-art, which might be found to elicit such a\nresponse despite the artist's intentions. The corticolimbic\nsignature of aesthetic experience might turn out to be some\nunique kind of self-reinforcing thalamocortical feedback\nloop. Although at this point the discussion is admittedly\nspeculative, it should be noted that this is where new neuro-\naesthetic lab work should take up the slack. It should also be\nnoted, however, that this proposal already has some intuitive\nplausibility, coheres with an established philosophical tradi-\ntion in aesthetics, gives a direction for further empirical\nresearch (including suggestive hypotheses), and helps arm\nthe philosopher and neuroaesthetician alike against the\nskeptic.\nConsider how this perspective on complementarity sug-\ngests replies to the various forms of skepticism outlined ear-\nlier. To the resistance to scientific intrusion in this domain, it\nmight be observed that the scientific branch of neuroaesthet-\nics represents, not a threat to aesthetics, but a potentially\nfruitful and, in a certain sense, badly needed partnership. The\nlow-level neuroscience will provide the means to flesh out,\nrefine, challenge, and vindicate certain accounts of aesthetic\nexperience, introspectively plausible and art-theoretically\nsensitive. Without neuroaesthetics, the philosophy of art is\nfleshless; without philosophy, the science of art is blind.\nSkepticism about aesthetic experience as such, which is\nusually grounded in the intuition that responses to art vary\nfar too widely for there to be anything distinctively \"aes-\nthetic\" about them, can be parried by noting three things:\nfirst, that the postulated \"deep structure\" of aesthetic experi-\nence would, if vindicated, unify aesthetic experience without\nneed of surface transparency; second, that the relational/mul-\ntiple faculties model already allows for intellectual and emo-\ntional content in aesthetic experience to vary as widely as\npossible without sacrificing a commitment to unity in the\nrelation between the faculties; and third, that from the per-\nspective of neuroaesthetics the existence of aesthetic experi-\nence as such is potentially up for grabs: but instead of just\n\"having a look,\" one goes into the lab and tests; the right sort\nof brain imaging (such as functional magnetic resonance\nimaging [fMRI]) of subjects enjoying different varieties of\nart should help determine whether the requisite commonali-\nties obtain. Beyond the depth (i.e., the unavailability to con-\nsciousness) of many aspects of ordinary mental life\n(unconscious aspects of cognition, repressed desires, etc.),\nthe idea is that even a lack of phenomenological similarity\nacross different aesthetic experiences would not by itself\nimply a lack of subliminal commonality: the hypothesized\ncorticolimbic signature.\nSkepticism about the aesthetic approach to the philosophy\nof art can be handled similarly. Grant that anti-aesthetic art\nlike Duchamp's Fountain counts as art, but does not appear\nto satisfy aesthetic interest or reward aesthetic attention.\nStill, some people like Fountain, and perhaps the deep struc-\nture of their appreciation, in concert with a phenomenologi-\ncal sense of similarity (in some cases, though dissimilarity in\nothers) is the same as that of enjoying more standard works.\n(Such works may unintentionally produce aesthetic experi-\nence and thus count as aesthetic despite an artist's possibly\nanti-aesthetic intentions.) The suggestion is that once again\nthe hypothesis could be tested to find out whether Fountain\nreally is anti-aesthetic as Duchamp seems to have intended\n(though this is itself disputable), bearing in mind that first-\nperson reports are not to be accepted unquestioned or ignored\noutright, but rather incorporated into a complete picture of\nthe aesthetic situation. If Fountain were discovered not to\nproduce aesthetic experience, even in people who do appre-\nciate the work and as they do so, that would imply that the\nappreciation is not of an aesthetic kind, that perhaps\nBeardsley (1983) was right after all to argue that such works\nshould be seen as curiosities rather than true art objects.\nNote, though, that Fountain might be discovered to produce\naesthetic experience in certain people under the right condi-\ntions, even perhaps some who firmly believe it could never\nso move them.\nConclusion\nAlthough the descriptive aspects of art, as described, extend\nfrom the armchair all the way to the lab, there is also,\n6 SAGE Open\nundiscussed as yet, some purchase on the value of aesthetic\nexperience, and this will help counter, albeit programmati-\ncally here, another objection to the neuroaesthetic approach.\nAn opponent of neuroaesthetics might object that it is a\npurely descriptive research program that, as such, fails to\naccount for the value, if not the character, of aesthetic experi-\nence: the failure of a naturalistic perspective to cross the\ndivide between the agreeable, for which evolutionary expla-\nnations are tailor-made, and the truly beautiful, or better, the\naesthetically piquant, on which such explanations seemingly\nis misguided, and suggests a one-dimensional view of evolu-\ntion, as if the evolved cortex could not help but find the\nagreeable (and whatever resembles it) agreeable, the dis-\nagreeable (and whatever resembles it) disagreeable, as if it\nwere only things external that matter, ignoring the plausibil-\nity that, for all its advantages, cortical evolution is the very\ncause of many of precisely those psychological conflicts\n(sometimes about the agreeable) for which enjoying art,\nhowever transiently, is an effective, and perhaps the preemi-\nnent, means of resolution.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nBaars, B.
