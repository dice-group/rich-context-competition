Recent re-\nsearch has shown that cyber dating\nabuse and other forms of ARA fre-\nquently overlap. Using a 3-state school-\nbased sample of adolescents, Zweig and\ncolleagues found that 26% of adoles-\ncents in dating relationships experi-\nenced cyber dating abuse and that\ncyber dating abuse was highly corre-\nlated with experiencing physical dating\nviolence, psychological dating abuse,\nand sexual coercion.18 Furthermore, Zweig\net al identified the most significant\nhealth correlates of cyber dating abuse\nto be a history of sexual activity, and\nhaving higher levels of depressive symp-\ntoms and anger/hostility.19 Whether\ncyber dating abuse correlates with\npoor health independent of its co-\noccurrence with other forms of ARA\nis not known. This may be particularly\nrelevant for clinicians uncertain about\nthe extent to which cyber dating abuse\npotentially contributes to the behaviors\ntheyareaddressingintheclinicalsetting.\nPossibly related to the health con-\nsequences of ARA, adolescents seeking\ncare in confidential adolescent health\nsettings have a higher prevalence of\nARA than general population-based\nexamined cyber dating abuse and the\nassociations with other forms of ARA\nand sexual risk behaviors among\na clinic-based sample of adolescents.\nSchool-based health centers (SHCs)\nrepresent a particularly unique setting\nin which to examine the clinical corre-\nlates of cyber dating abuse and ARA.\nSHCs reduce barriers to health care\nfaced by adolescents, such as concerns\nabout confidentiality, lack of health in-\nsurance, and limited knowledge of the\nhensive clinics are well positioned to\noffer prevention education as well as\ninterventions for youth experiencing\nabusive relationships.27 The purpose of\nthis study was to examine character-\nistics of cyber dating abuse and how\nsuch abuse may be associated with\nother forms of ARA, nonpartner sexual\nviolence victimization, and sexual and\nreproductive health risks among youth\nseeking care in SHCs. Understanding\nthe prevalence and correlates of cyber\ndating abuse in this clinic-based sample\nmay guide prevention and intervention\nefforts to reduce such abuse and im-\nprove adolescent health.\nMETHODS\nStudy Overview\nData are from a cross-sectional survey\nthat served as baseline data for a\ncluster-randomized trial in SHCs to\npromote healthy relationships and re-\nduce ARA (ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier\nCalifornia were randomly assigned to\nintervention or a delayed-intervention\ncontrol condition.

These\nitems were pilot tested using cognitive\ninterviewing techniques with a sample\nof adolescents (n = 20) from a separate\nSHC in the same region not participat-\ning in the parent study. In factor analy-\nses conducted with the entire study\nsample, these items divided into 2\ndomains: sexual cyber dating abuse\n(eg, pressuring to talk about sex) and\nnonsexual cyber dating abuse (eg,\nmonitoring one's whereabouts). All\nitems assessed frequency: \"In the past\n3 months, how many times has a\npartner [behavior] to you using mo-\nbile apps, social networks, texts, or\nother digital communication?\" with 5\nresponse options (0 = never, 1 = a few\ntimes, 2 = once or twice a month, 3 =\nonce or twice a week, 4 = every day or\nalmost every day). For prevalence esti-\nmates, responses other than \"never\"\nwere coded as having experienced\ncyber dating abuse. In regression\nmodels to account for frequency of\ncyber dating abuse experiences, the\n\"once or twice a month\" or greater re-\nsponse options were collapsed into\na single (high) category, and the \"never\"\nand \"a few times\" responses were left\nunchanged.\nRequests for Sexual Images\nAnadditionalitemaskedaboutwhether\na respondent's partner had asked\nthem to send nude or seminude photos\nof themselves in the past 3 months.\nARA Victimization\nWe used 3 items modified from the Con-\nflict Tactics Scales--229 and the Sexual\nExperiences Survey,30 1 for physical vio-\nlence (\"someone you were going out with\nor hooking up with hit, pushed, slapped,\nchoked, or otherwise physically hurt\nyou\") and 2 for sexual violence (\"some-\none you were going out with or hooking\nup with used force or threats to make\nyou have sex [vaginal, oral, or anal sex]\nwhen you didn't want to\" and \"have you\nhad sex with someone you were going\nout with or hooking up with when you\ndidn't want to, because you felt like you\ndidn't have achoice, eventhoughthey did\nnot use physical force or threats?\").\nNonpartner Sexual Violence\nTwo items modified from the Sexual\nExperiences Survey30 were as follows:\nhas someone you were not going out\nwith or hooking up with (1) used force\nor threats to make you have sex (vag-\ninal, oral, or anal sex) when you didn't\nwant to and (2) insisted that you have\nsex when you didn't want to, without\nusing force or threats.\nSexual Behaviors\nSingle items assessed all participants\nfor any oral, vaginal, and anal sex (de-\nfined by using anatomic terms) and\nnumber of sex partners in the past 3\nmonths.

Although technology ex-\npands opportunities for learning, and\npositiveinteractionamongyouth,34 the\nintersection between technology and un-\nhealthy behaviors in dating relationships\nassessed in this study clearly represents\na challenge for adolescent health pro-\nmotion. The prevalence of recent cyber\ndating abuse in this clinic-based sample\nis high. In comparison, the Zweig study\n(using similar measures)18 reported\na past-year prevalence of 26% for any\ncyber dating abuse in a school-based\nsample, restricted to youth reporting\na current or past year dating relation-\nship. In our clinic-based sample, recent\ncyber dating abuse was measured in the\npast 3-month time frame and was not\nrestricted to youth in dating relation-\nships. The overall prevalence was 41%,\nsuggesting, as has been documented\nwith physical and sexual ARA victimiza-\ntion, that cyber dating abuse appears to\nbe more common among youth seeking\ncare in confidential health settings com-\npared with the general adolescent pop-\nulation. This finding suggests a need to\nprioritize targeted interventions within\nschool health settings.\nThe Zweig study18 examined the co-\noccurrence of cyber dating abuse (both\nsexual and nonsexual) with physical,\nsexual, and psychological ARA and iden-\ntified significant overlap with each of\nthese. The proportions reported by\nZweig are similar to the overlap identi-\nfied in this study. A strength of the cur-\nrent study is our ability to classify\nfrequency of cyber dating abuse and\nassociations with health behaviors.\nThese analyses found a significant re-\nlationship between frequency of cyber\ndating abuse and ARA, nonpartner sex-\nual violence, and sexual activity. Non-\npartner sexual violence victimization is\na particularly novel finding that suggests\nTABLE 2 Prevalence of Recent CDA Experiences and Sexting Requests, by Sex\nCDA Perpetrated by a Partnera Total (N = 1008), % (n) Male (n = 239), % (n) Female (n = 769), % (n) Pb\nPartnera Requested Sexual Images (not included in cyber dating abuse)\nCDA, cyber dating abuse.\na Partner defined as someone you were dating, going out with, or hooking up with.\nb Wald log-linear x2 test, adjusted for clinic-level clustering.\nTABLE 3 Overlap of CDA With ARA Victimization and Nonpartner Sexual Violence Victimization (n = 1008)\n% (n) % (n) % (n) % (n)\nAll items measure past 3-month experiences. CDA, cyber dating abuse.\na Wald log-linear x2 test, adjusted for clinic-level clustering.\ncyber dating abuse may be occurring in\nthe context of social networks that in-\nvolve greater sexual risk or that cyber\ndating abuse may increase vulnerability\nto sexual violence more generally. The\nmechanisms for these associations and\nhow cyber dating abuse fits into the\ntrajectory of adolescent relationship de-\nvelopment merit further study to guide\nintervention development.\nSHCpatientsarepredominantly female35\n(76% in this study). The female partic-\nipants in this study exposed to any re-\ncent cyber dating abuse were 2 to 4\ntimes more likely not to use any form\nof contraception and 3 to 6 times more\nlikely to have experienced recent re-\nproductive coercion, compared with\nunexposed females. Because these\nassociations were found after con-\ntrolling for recent physical and sexual\nARA, cyber dating abuse may be inde-\npendently associated with these sexual\nand reproductive risks. Clinically, this\nmeans that inquiring about cyber dating\nabuse when assessing a youth's sexual\nhealth behaviors may identify youth in\nparticular need for ARA intervention.\nFurthermore, because more frequent\ncyber dating abuse exposure is associ-\nated with greater health risk, a harm\nreduction approach to reduce frequency\nof cyber dating abuse may be helpful.\nThestudyhasseverallimitationsincluding\nthe cross-sectional nature of these data,\nwhich precludes causal inference. As all\nitemsmeasuredbehaviorsandexposures\nin the past 3 months, the data do offer\nsome clarity about recency and co-\noccurrence of various forms of victimi-\nzation. To create a brief survey, the ARA\nmeasuresdidnotincludeotheraspectsof\nabuse, such as verbal and psychological\nabuse. A related limitation is the lack of\nmale-specific sexual health outcomes,\nsuch as consistent condom use.

Future studies are needed\nto assess whether sex differences in\ncyber dating abuse persist in larger\nsamples and whether meaning, motiva-\ntions, and health consequences of such\nabuse may differ for male comparedwith\nfemale adolescents. Because population-\nbased studies have found similar preva-\nlence of physical ARAvictimizationamong\nboth males and females,36\u00ad38 sex differ-\nences in cyber dating abuse should be\ninvestigated at a population level. Addi-\ntionally, our finding regarding the sex\ndifferences in the \"sexting\" request item\nsuggests there is a gendered context for\nthis abuse with females bearing the in-\ncreased burden for refusing or ac-\nquiescing to sexting requests. This is\nconsistentwitharecentstudyofyounger\nmore likely than girls to send sexually\nexplicit messages or photos.39 Finally,\nfindings from this nonrepresentative\nsample from 8 SHCs in 1 Northern\nCalifornia region cannot be general-\nized to all high school\u00adage students.\nAn ongoing challenge in the field of ad-\nolescent interpersonal violence pre-\nvention is the constant shifting of\nadolescentbehaviors.Capturingthe use\nof technology to perpetrate ARA in\nstandardized survey items is uniquely\nchallenging because of the rapidly\nevolving nature of technology and be-\ncause this newer mode of communi-\ncation (versus in-person or phone\nconversation) brings new capacities\nto victimize. For instance, cyber com-\nmunication can be rapidly shared\nwith others, potentially magnifying the\nharmful effects for victims. Therefore,\nbehaviors that may not be harmful when\nenacted in person may become harmful\nwhen the communication mechanism\nhas permanency (ie, leaves a digital\nfootprint), can be repeatedly viewed by\nthe recipient, and can be easily spread\nto nonrecipients. In particular, our mea-\nsurement of cyber dating abuse includes\nbehaviors that could be perceived as\npart of normal sexual negotiation.\nHowever, we conducted extensive cog-\nnitive interviewing of these items,\nmodified only slightly from previous\nstudies to simplify language, and youth\nwere clear that they perceived these\nitems to be asking about abusive be-\nhaviors. Moreover, frequency data in-\ndicate that youth experienced these\nbehaviors often, and frequent unwanted\nbehaviorisconsistentwithotherstudies\nof ARA. It is possible, however, that the\nprevalence reported here is an over-\nestimation of cyber dating abuse.\nThese limitations notwithstanding, our\nfindings of cyber dating abuse preva-\nlence and correlates are particularly\nsalient for health care providers and\nhealth educators working in clinical or\nschool-basedsettings.Providersneedto\nbe aware of the extent to which cyber\ndating abuse may be associated with\nsexual behavior, other forms of partner\nabuse, and with nonpartner sexual vio-\nlence. That cyber dating abuse associ-\nations with pregnancy risk were found\nfor female adolescents in this sample\nevenaftercontrollingforrecentphysical\nor sexual ARA underscores the impor-\ntance of assessing for multiple dimen-\nsions of abuse. Educating youth about\nwhatconstitutescyberdatingabuseand\noffering strategies on how to manage\ntechnologytoreduceriskforsuchabuse\nmay behelpful interventioncomponents\nto implement in SHC settings.\n"
