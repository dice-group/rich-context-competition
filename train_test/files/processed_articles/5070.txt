A possible explanation is that\nthe functional connectivity would be the first step leading to\nincreased activation in a region that would activate as a\ncompensatory mechanism.\nThe large neural network altered in AD encompasses also\nthalamus and basal ganglia has been demonstrated to be\nparticular, AD is associated with neuronal loss not only in the\nhippocampus and amygdala but also in the thalamus and\nbasal ganglia. Anterodorsal, centromedial and pulvinar nuclei\nare the main sites of degeneration in AD (Zarei et al., 2010).\nMoreover, volumes of putamen and thalamus were found\nsignificantly reduced in patients diagnosed with probable AD,\nand the decrease in volume correlated linearly with impaired\nglobal cognitive performance (de Jong et al., 2008). These\nfindings strongly suggest that, besides neo-cortical atrophy,\ndeep GM structures in AD suffer structural changes and that\ndegenerative processes in the basal ganglia and thalamus may\ncontribute to cognitive decline in AD.\nThe relationship between the sources of different EEG\nrhythms and thalamus\u00adbasal ganglia structure have been\nwidely studied and accepted. For instance, findings in human\nand animal studies suggest that coordinated simultaneous h\nactivity is observed in two networks linked, respectively, to\nstriatal nucleus (Llina\nanterior thalamic system (Kirk and Mackay, 2003; Schmiedt et\nal., 2005). The a rhythm generation is quite more complex.\nThe a dominant rhythm arises from the continuous interplay\namong posterior thalamo\u00adcaudate loop, posterior cingulated\nand parieto\u00adoccipital cortical areas (Steriade, 2006; Cantero\net al., 2009). As a consequence, the generation of a rhythm is\nlinked to the cortico\u00adthalamo\u00adcaudate loops Of note,\nchanges in a and c oscillatory activity, impinging on\nthalamo\u00adcortical posterior networks, have been shown to\nplay a relevant functional role during perceptual, executive\nand mnemonic processes (Klimesch, 1997). Moreover, episodic\nmemory process studies have demonstrated the modulation\nof the EEG rhythms by deep brain structure, such as basal\nganglia and thalamus (Hart et al., 2012). Depending on the\ncontext, caudate modulation of interactions between cortical\nand the thalamus or cortical and more posterior cortical\nregions could suppress incorrect objects and enhance\nrepresentations of the correct object, followed by termination\nof the retrieval process revealed by increase in upper a or b\nband (Crosson et al., 2003). Thalamic function is essential to\neffective semantic-memory retrieval and is disrupted to\nvarying degrees in cognitive impaired patients. In particular,\nit has been demonstrated that in the most impaired patients,\nwho made more errors and had longer reaction times, there\nwas an increase in thalamic BOLD signal as reaction times\nincreased. These findings demonstrate that thalamic dys-\nfunction correlates with object memory retrieval errors.\nAn important component of the circuit is the pulvinar\nsynchronization of primary and non-primary visual cortices via\na/c EEG rhythms propagated through corticothalamic pathways\nsemantic operations engage this mechanism or specific aspects\nof it. A recent work (Hart et al., 2012) has proposed that the\ncortical\u00adthalamus\u00adcaudate circuit is engaged for complex,\ncontrolled semantic search and retrieval. This notion extends\nfrom the proposition that the thalamus and basal ganglia\n(caudate) are engaged by higher-order language processing that\ncannot rely on automatic processing, but which recruits\ncontrolled processes and might reflect a strategic semantic\nsearch mechanism (Ketteler et al., 2008). These processes are\nreflected by modulation of upper a frequency.\nRecently, it has been demonstrated that the increase of\nhigh a relative to low a power is a reliable EEG marker\nof hippocampal atrophy (Moretti et al., 2007b) and amigdalo-\nhippocampal complex atrophy (Moretti et al., 2009b).\nFurthermore, the increase in a3/a2 power ratio has been\ndemonstrated predictive of conversion of patients with MCI\nin AD, but not in non-AD dementia (Moretti et al., 2011). The\nsame increase of a3/a2 power ratio was found to be\ncorrelated with hippocampal atrophy in subjects with AD\n(Moretti et al., 2012). For these previous findings, the a3/a2\npower ratio analysis has been focused on in the present study.\nIn the present study, the association of EEG index with GM\nchanges in thalamus and basal ganglia has been studied in\nsubjects with MCI. The working hypothesis was that modifica-\ntions of the EEG marker could be underpinned by specific deep\nbrain structures, unveiling the possibility to identify different\nMCI populations. Results show that subjects with higher a3/a2\nratios when compared with subjects with lower and middle a3/\na2 ratios showed minor atrophy in the ventral stream of basal\nganglia (head of caudate nuclei and accumbens nuclei\nbilaterally) and of the pulvinar nuclei in the thalamus.\nSubjects\nFor the present study, 74 subjects with MCI were recruited\nfrom the memory IRCCS (Clinic of the Scientific Institute for\nResearch and Care) of Alzheimer's and psychiatric diseases\n`Fatebenefratelli' in Brescia. The data of same subjects were\nused in previously published works of our group (Moretti et al.,\n2009a,b,c). All experimental protocols had been approved by\nthe local Ethics Committee. Informed consent was obtained\nfrom all participants or their caregivers, according to the Code\nof Ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of\nD.V.

The research was undertaken with the understanding\nand written consent of each participant.\nDiagnostic criteria\nPatients were taken from a prospective project on the na-\ntural history of MCI. The project was aimed to study the\nnatural history of non-demented persons with apparently\nprimary cognitive deficits, i.e. deficits not due to psychic\n(anxiety, depression etc.) or physical (hypothyroidism, vitamin\nB12 and folate deficiency, uncontrolled heart disease,\nuncontrolled diabetes etc.) conditions.\nPatients were rated with a series of standardized diagnostic\nand severity instruments, including the MMSE (Mini-Mental\nState Examination; Folstein et al., 1975), the CDRS (Clinical\nDementia Rating Scale; Hughes et al., 1982), the HIS (Hachinski\nIschemic Scale ; Rosen et al., 1980) and the IADL and BADL\n(Instrumental Activities of Daily Living and Basic Activities of\nDaily Living; Lawton and Brodie, 1969). In addition, patients\nunderwent diagnostic neuroimaging procedures (MRI), and\nlaboratory testing to rule out other causes of cognitive\nimpairment. These inclusion and exclusion criteria for MCI were\nbased on previous seminal studies (Petersen et al., 2001; Portet\ncriteria of the study were all of the following: (i) complaint by\nthe patient or report by a relative or the general practitioner, of\nmemory or other cognitive disturbances; (ii) MMSE score of 24\u00ad\n27/30 or MMSE of 28 and higher plus low performance (score of\n2\u00ad6 or higher) on the clock drawing test (Lezak et al., 2004); (iii)\nsparing of IADL and BADL or functional impairment steadily due\nto causes other than cognitive impairment, such as physical\nimpairments, sensory loss, gait or balance disturbances etc.\nExclusion criteria were any one of the following: (i) patients\naged 90 years and older; (ii) history of depression or juvenile-\nonset psychosis; (iii) history or neurological signs of major\nstroke; (iv) other psychiatric diseases, epilepsy, drug addiction,\nalcohol dependence; (v) use of psychoactive drugs, including\nacetylcholinesterase inhibitors or other drugs enhancing brain\ncognitive functions; and (vi) current or previous uncontrolled\nor complicated systemic diseases (including diabetes mellitus)\nor traumatic brain injuries.\nAll patients underwent: (i) semi-structured interview with\nthe patient and \u00ad whenever possible \u00ad with another\ninformant (usually, the patient's spouse or a child of the\npatient) by a geriatrician or neurologist; (ii) physical and\nneurological examinations; (iii) performance-based tests of\nphysical function, gait and balance; (iv) neuropsychological\nbattery assessing memory (Babcock Story Recall-Rey-\nOsterrieth Complex Figure, Recall-Auditory-Verbal Learning\nTest, immediate and delayed recall; Lezak et al., 2004) verbal\nand non-verbal memory, attention and executive functions\n(Trail Making Test B, A and B-A; Inverted Motor Learning-\nClock Drawing Test; Lezak et al., 2004), abstract reasoning\nthinking (Raven Coloured Progressive Matrices; Lezak et al.,\n2004), frontal functions (Inverted Motor Learning), language\n(Phonological and Semantic fluency-Token test, Lezak et al.,\n2004) and apraxia and visuo-constructional abilities (Rey-\nOsterrieth Complex Figure, Rey figure copy, Clock Drawing\nTest; Lezak et al., 2004); (v) assessment of depressive\nsymptoms by means of the CES-D (Center for Epidemiologic\nStudies Depression scale; Radloff, 1977). As the aim of our\nstudy was to evaluate the relationship between GM loss and\na2/a3 or h/c ratios, we did not consider the clinical subtype of\nMCI, i.e., amnesic or non-amnesic, single or multiple domains.\nEEG recordings\nThe EEG activity was recorded continuously from 19 sites by\nusing electrodes set in an elastic cap (Electro-Cap International,\nInc.) and positioned according to the 10\u00ad20 international\nP4, T6, O1 and O2). The ground electrode was placed in front of\nFz. The left and right mastoids served as reference for all\nelectrodes. The recordings were used off-line to re-reference the\nscalp recordings to the common average. Data were recorded\nwith a band-pass filter of 0.3\u00ad70 Hz, and digitized at a sampling\nrate of 250 Hz (BrainAmp, BrainProducts). Electrodes\u00adskin\nimpedance was set below 5 kV. Horizontal and vertical eye\nmovements were detected by recording the EOG (electrooculo-\ngram). The recording lasted 5 min, with subjects with closed\neyes. Longer recordings would have reduced the variability of\nthe data, but they would also have increased the possibility\nof slowing of EEG oscillations due to reduced vigilance and\narousal. EEG data were then analysed and fragmented offline in\nconsecutive epochs of 2 s, with a frequency resolution of 0.5 Hz.\nThe average number of epochs analysed was 140 ranging from\ntypes of artefact were preliminarily identified by a computerized\nautomatic procedure (Moretti et al., 2003). Two expert\nelectroencephalographists manually double-checked and con-\nfirmed the automatic selections. The epochs with ocular,\nmuscular and other types of artefacts were discarded. We are\nconfident about the stationarity of EEG signal in our traces. Our\nrecordings were performed at rest state, without any external\nstimulation that could bias the signal, maintaining the\nstochastic nature of spontaneous ongoing EEG. Moreover, it is\nwidely accepted that the duration of a so-called quasi-\nstationary interval of continuous EEG recordings is expected\nmuch longer fragments of even 12 s (Cohen and Sances, 1977),\nto be approximately stationary. Of note, our spectral analysis has\nbeen evaluated on 2 s epoch in each subject. Finally, the spectral\npower was averaged across all electrodes to obtain sort of global\nfield power, which would have reduced the channel-to-channel\nvariability, with the advantage to extract a high stationary\nmeasure. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the analysis of\nthe EEG recording in frequency domain (i.e. power spectra)\nresults in high stationary signal (Kipin\nas a control analysis, the stability of the EEG signal was tested as\nfollows: the power spectra of ten epochs lasting 2 s each were\naveraged both at the beginning at the end of the free-artefact\nAnalysis of grey matter in thalamus and basal ganglia\nE 2012 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/)\nwhich permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nEEG trace of any subjects, since testing for stationarity of the\nvariability of trial-to-trial power spectra required equal time\nintervals between consecutive observations (Kipin\n\u00b4ski et al.,\nthe beginning and the ending epochs in each subject and among\nall subjects.\nAnalysis of individual frequency bands\nAll recordings were obtained in the morning with subjects resting\ncomfortably. Vigilance was continuously monitored in order to\navoid drowsiness. A digital FFT-based power spectrum analysis\n(Welch technique, Hanning windowing function, no phase shift)\ncomputed-ranging from 2 to 45 Hz\u00adthe power density of EEG\nrhythms with a 0.5 Hz frequency resolution. Two anchor\nfrequencies were selected according to the literature guidelines\nand the IAF (individual a frequency) peak. The TF marks the TF\nbetween the h and a bands and represents an estimate of the\nfrequency at which the h and a spectra intersect. TF was\ncomputed as the minimum power in the a frequency range, since\nour EEG recordings were performed at rest. The IAF represents\nthe frequency with the maximum power peak within the\nextended a range (5\u00ad14 Hz). Based on TF and IAF, we estimated\nthe frequency band range for each subject, as follows: d from TF-\n4 to TF-2, h from TF-2 to TF, low a band (a1 and a2) from TF to\nIAF and high a band (or a3) from IAF to IAF+2. The a1 and a2\nbands were computed for each subject as follows: a1 from TF to\nthe middle point of the TF\u00adIAF range, and a2 from such middle\n2009a,b,c). Moreover, individual b and c frequencies were\ncomputed. Three frequency peaks were detected in the frequency\nrange from the individual a3 frequency band and 45 Hz. These\npeaks were named b1 (IBF 1), b2 (IBF 2) and c (IGF). Based on\npeaks, the frequency ranges were determined. b1 ranges from a3\nto the lower spectral power value between b1 and b2 peak; b2\nfrequency ranges from b1 to the lower spectral power value\nbetween b2 and c peak; c frequency ranges from b2 to 45 Hz,\nwhich is the end of the range considered. Moreover, within h\nfrequency, the frequency peak ITF (individual theta frequency)\nwas also individuated. The mean frequency ranges computed in\nMCI subjects considered as a whole are: d 2.9\u00ad4.9 Hz; h 4.9\u00ad\nbands determined on an individual basis, we computed the\nrelative power spectra for each subject. The relative power\ndensity for each frequency band was computed as the ratio\nbetween the absolute power and the mean power spectra from 2\nto 45 Hz. The relative band power at each band was defined as\nthe mean of the relative band power for each frequency bin\nwithin that band. The a3/a2 and h/c ratio was computed in all\nsubjects. Three groups were obtained according to increasing\nand high (a3/a2.1.17). A tertile subdivision was chosen in which\neach tertile is statistical significantly different from others. It\nshould be possible to obtain three groups with equal size or only\ntwo groups, but the analysis of the results would be less sensible\nas compared with three groups, whose average values were\nsignificantly different from each other.\nMRI scans\nFor each subject, a high-resolution sagittal T1 weighted\nvolumetric MR scan was acquired by using a 1.0 T Philips\nGyroscan scanner, with a gradient echo 3D technique:\nThe pattern of GM atrophy was studied using the VBM\n(voxel-based morphometry) technique (Ashburner, 2007).\nVoxel-based morphometry\nThe 3D images were processed through the SPM5 software\npackage (Statistical Parametric Mapping, Version 5; Welcome\nDepartment of Imaging Neuroscience, London, UK; http://\nwww.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm), running on Matlab 7.0.1 (Math-\nWorks). DICOM files were converted into ANALYZE format\nimage, the extra-cranial voxels were removed and the AC\n(anterior commissure) was manually set for all images as the\norigin of the spatial coordinates for an anatomical normal-\nization algorithm implemented in SPM. Converted files were\nthen segmented into GM and white matter and normalized to\nthe GM population templates, generated from the complete\nimage set, using the DARTEL (Diffeomorphic Anatomical\nRegistration using Exponentiated Lie) algebra registration\nmethod (Ashburner, 2007). This non-linear warping technique\nminimizes between-subject structural variations.\nSpatially normalized images were modulated by the Jacobian\ndeterminants derived from the spatial normalization to ensure\nthat the overall amount of each tissue class was not altered by\nthe spatial normalization procedure. The final voxel resolution\nwarped GM image was transformed to MNI space and smoothed\nwith an 8 mm FWHM (full-width at half-maximum) Gaussian\nkernel filter. The experimenter performing the MRN computa-\ntions was blinded to the results of previous EEG works so that\nthere were not biases in the analysis.\nStatistical analysis\nVBM results were assessed at an uncorrected threshold of\nP,0.001. This threshold has an important limit in that it\nallows the type I statistical error. Anyway, a more permissive\nthreshold could be more adequate to this explorative study,\nin order to avoid the b (or type II) statistic error, with the risk\nto neglect interesting results. The power of the study was\nallowed by size of the sample and by the robust results of the\nsubsequent analyses. The sample was disaggregated into\nthree groups according to three increasing values of a3/a2\nD.V.

For continuous variables, post-\nhoc pairwise comparisons among groups were performed\nwith the Games-Howell or Bonferroni tests depending on\nhomogeneity of variance tested with Levene's test.\nMoreover, the TIV (total intracranial volume) was intro-\nduced in the statistical analysis as a covariate to avoid the\nconfounding item of the global cortical atrophy. The TIV was\ncomputed by manually tracing the entire intracranial cavity\non 7 mm thick coronal slices, by the use of the software\nAll the analyses were restricted to the thalamus and basal\nganglia as regions of interest in order to focus on the\nrelationship between the brain areas and EEG markers. It\nshould be possible to perform a computation encompassing\nother brain areas, but this was beyond the scope of the\npresent work. Moreover, the relationship of EEG markers with\nhippocampus and amygdala was addressed previously\n(Moretti et al., 2009b). For this purpose, a mask including\ncaudate nucleus, putamen, globus pallidus, accumbens\nnucleus and thalamus was entered into the models as explicit\nmask. It was manually traced, through the software MRIcroN,\non the previous template generated from the complete image\nset.\nThe detection of the anatomical regions was based on the\nlocalization of the thalamic nuclei and basal ganglia in\nhistological sections from a human atlas (Mai et al., 1997).\nRESULTS\nSubjects with low a3/a2 ratio exhibited a region of GM more\natrophic than subjects with high a3/a2 ratios located in the\nhead of caudate, specifically in the ventral part and\naccumbens nuclei bilaterally, slightly wider on the right side\n(see Figure 1).\nNo regions of GM tissue loss were found when patients\nwith low a3/a2 ratio were compared with those with middle\nSubjects with middle a3/a2 ratio, contrasted with individuals\nwith high a3/a2 ratios, showed the same cerebral atrophic areas\nobserved in the previous contrast (low a3/a2 compared with high\na3/a2 ratio) including the bilateral head of caudate. Specifically,\nthe GM loss was located in the medial, ventral caudate and\naccumbens nuclei on the right brain hemisphere, whereas the\natrophy was restricted to the ventral part of caudate and in\nthe accumbens nucleus on the left one (see Figure 2).\nNo regions of significant GM tissue loss were found in\nother comparisons in this group.\nDISCUSSION\nPreliminary remarks\nIn this study, we have considered the GM changes of deep\nbrain structures, basal ganglia and thalamus, based on brain\nelectrical activity markers. As a consequence, the analysis of\nanatomical structural changes in MCI patients was EEG\nmarker driven. This is a crucial point for considering the\nresults of the present study. Indeed, it is not a simple\ndetection of atrophy pattern between two clinically different\npopulations of subjects, but it would investigate the\nassociation of EEG markers with specific GM changes of\nthalamus and basal ganglia in subpopulations of subjects\nwith MCI in order to detect biomarkers (morphophysiological)\nearly predictive of AD and non-AD dementia. The a3/a2\nfrequency ratio has been chosen for two principal reasons: (1)\nprevious studies demonstrated their association with import-\nant anatomical substrates for atrophy, namely the hippocam-\nhas demonstrated that those EEG indexes have different\ndiagnostic and prognostic value: the increase in a3/a2 ratio is\nassociated with the conversion of MCI subjects in AD (Moretti\net al., 2009c). Moreover, the increase of this EEG index has\nbeen previously correlated with impairment in psychometric\ntests in MCI subjects (Moretti et al., 2009a,b). Of note, the\npresent results derive from comparisons within masked\nregions along with relatively liberal statistical thresholds.\nThis implies that these findings need to be confirmed by\nfurther studies with larger size patient populations. On the\nother hand, the presence of a peculiar pattern of association\nbetween EEG and MRI markers in a subgroup of MCI subjects\ncould be useful in the comprehension of anatomo-physio-\nlogical underpinning of the MCI entity. Indeed, in the\nprevious studies published by our group, the increase of a3/\na2 ratio was associated with a decrease (or atrophy) of the\nhippocampal volume. On the contrary, in the present study,\nthe a3/a3 ratio is associated with a bigger volume (or minor\natrophy) in the basal ganglia and thalamus.\nAssociation between EEG markers and GM\nchanges\nThe increase of a3/a2 ratio is associated with minor atrophy\nof caudate nuclei, accumbens nuclei in the basal ganglia,\nAnalysis of grey matter in thalamus and basal ganglia\nE 2012 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/)\nwhich permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nand of the pulvinar nuclei of the thalamus. These results\nconfirm previous studies on AD patients, showing both basal\nganglia and thalamic involvement in AD (de Jong et al., 2008;\nThe principal difference with the most of the other studies is\nthat they reported a greater atrophy of thalamus and basal\nganglia. There are some possible explanations: (1) the EEG-\ndriven evaluation of atrophy, focusing on specific morpho-\nstructural features of patients, have magnified only some GM\npatterns; (2) previous observed atrophy patterns could be\nlinked to specific regressive processes due to aging (Cabeza\n2006; (3) previous studies were mostly performed on AD\npatients whereas subjects with MCI could have a different,\nperhaps compensatory, mechanism as compared with AD\nFigure 1 GM density in high versus low a3/a2 power ratio\nT-map showing greater regional GM density in patients with high a3/a2 ratio contrasted with patients with low a3/a2 ratio (P#0.05\nuncorrected, the symbol `.` denotes `major GM density then'; see also Table 1).\nTable 1 Demographic and cognitive characteristics in the whole sample disaggregated for increased levels of a3/a2 ratio\nNumbers denote means\u00a1S.D., number and (range).\nAll High Middle Low P\nP denotes significance on ANOVA (continuous variables) and chi-square test (dichotomous variables).\nD.V.

This could suggest\nthe existence of specific neural networks underlying the\ndegenerative disease. We suggest an interesting, although\nspeculative, hypothesis that could explain the novelty\nemerging from our results. A ventral stream, encompassing\nstriatum (ventral caudate nuclei), and accumbens nuclei\ntogether with pulvinar nuclei of the thalamus, seems to be\nless affected in MCI patients who will develop AD. The\nrelatively preserved anatomical structure could suggest a state\nof compensatory hyperfunction of this circuitry, determining\nboth cognitive and psychiatric symptoms of prodromal AD\n(Spalletta et al., 2010). Indeed, the ventral caudate and\naccumbens nuclei are related to the regulation of emotional\nFigure 2 GM density in high versus middle a3/a2 power ratio\nT-map showing greater regional GM density in patients with high a3/a2 ratio contrasted with patients with middle a3/a2 ratio\n(P#0.05 uncorrected, the symbol `.' denotes `major GM density then'; see also Table 1).\nAnalysis of grey matter in thalamus and basal ganglia\nE 2012 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/)\nwhich permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\ncontrol function, in particular with the impulsivity and fear\nbehaviour control (Basar et al., 2010). In turn, the pulvinar\nnuclei are involved in cognitive visuo-spatial function (Berman\nand Wurtz, 2010). The brain electrical activity marker of these\nstructural changes is represented by the increase of a3/a2\nratio. This could be due to the prevalence of an anterior circuit\nimpinging on anterior cingulate cortex, ventral (limbic)\nstriatum and orbito-frontal cortex, relatively spared (in the\ninitial time of disease) in prodromal AD patients. The disrupture\nof the posterior circuit, encompassing hippocampal cortex,\nposterior cingulate, precuneus, posterior parietal cortices, will\ngive rise to the decrease of low a (a2 in our analysis) rhythm,\nwhereas the dominance of an anterior circuit gives rise to the\nincrease of high a. This explanation is supported by two well-\nknown neurophysiological phenomena in AD: (1) the decrease\nof power of the dominant a rhythm on posterior cerebral\nareas; and (2) the so-called `anteriorization' of a frequency\n(Klimesch et al., 2007). The anterior a is higher in frequency for\ntwo possible reasons: (1) the lack of large areas to synchronize,\nas the posterior sibling usually does; and (2) the association\nwith attentive phenomena, more than with visuo-spatial\nanalysis, usually related to higher a rhythm (Klimesch, 1999).\nThe lack of results in the comparison between middle and\nlow ratios of a3/a2 is counterintuitive and puzzling to be\ninterpreted. The most plausible reason is that the neurophy-\nsiological phenomena become evident when the atrophy of\ndeep GM nuclei reaches a threshold level, highlighting the\nstrength of the EEG markers-guided analysis in a prognostic\nview. Indeed, the other groups could present MCI subjects\nthat will remain stable or with depression or with prevalent\ncerebrovascular disease.\nAnatomo-physiological implications at network\nlevel\nVentral stiatum (ventral caudate and accumbens nuclei) is a\nkey entry point structure for afferent information from the\nperiphery as well as for afferents and efferents of wider\nCSPTC (cortico\u00adstriatal\u00adpallido\u00adthalamo\u00adcortical functionally\nsegregated loops; Kopell and Greenberg, 2008). Of note, this\nnetwork has peculiar functions within the loop associated\nwith characteristic modulation effects.\nThe ventral striatum/accumben complex is related to\norbito-frontal cortex and is involved in the weighting of\nstimuli in the reward against punishment evaluation.\nMoreover, these structures provide a vital link between the\ninternal state of emotion and the external state of motor\nbehaviour (Kopell and Greenberg, 2008; Haber and Knutson,\n2010). The involvement of pulvinar nuclei is well associated\nwith visuo-spatial associative function as well as with a\nmodulation of the limbic system through the connection\nbetween medial pulvinar and the amygdala (Berman and\nThere are some limitations due to the explorative nature\nof the present study: (1) the lack of the estimation of other\nEEG frequencies; and (2) the lack of the estimation of\nsynchrony or coherence measures (see also Dauwels et al.,\n2009). Anyway, along the conceptual frame of the study,\nboth of them need to be associated with morpho-structural\nparameters. These aspects need to be addressed in future\nstudies.\nPrevious studies, facing the neural network connectivity\nissue, using fMRI and PET as well as EEG, demonstrate that\nconnectivity of brain activity is altered in AD and correlates\nwith cognitive deficits (Bokde et al., 2009). Grady et al.\nsuggested a functional disconnection between the hippocam-\npus and the frontal cortices in the AD patients, and that the\ndisconnection was underlying the memory deficit in the AD\nhyperactivation of memory networks was found in subjects\nwith MCI with clinical memory impairment (Dickerson et al.,\noffer a possible comprehensive explanation. As a speculative\nhypothesis, it could be possible that in MCI subjects at risk to\ndevelop AD, discrete networks prevail on long-range net-\nworks (disconnection theory). At the same time, the survival\nof hyperactive, although short-range, networks permit the\nmaintenance of a normal performance (compensation\ntheory), at least in the early phases of disease.\nConclusion\nThe integrated analysis of EEG and morpho-structural\nmarkers could be useful in the comprehension of anatomo-\nphysiological underpinning of the MCI entity.\nFUNDING\nThis work was supported by the Fatebenefratelli Association\nfor Research (AFaR).\nREFERENCES\nAshburner J (2007) A fast diffeomorphic image registration algorithm.\nBabiloni C, Binetti G, Cassetta E, Dal Forno G, Del Percio C, Ferreri F, Ferri R,\nFrisoni G, Hirata K, Lanuzza B, Miniussi C, Moretti DV, Nobili F, Rodriguez\nG, Romani GL, Salinari S, Rossini PM (2006) Sources of cortical rhythms\nchange as a function of cognitive impairment in pathological aging: a\nBasar K, Sesia T, Groenewegen H, Steinbusch HW, Visser-Vandewalle V, Temel\nBekisz M, Wrobel A (1999) Coupling of beta and gamma activity in cortico-\nthalamic system of cats attending to visual stimuli.
