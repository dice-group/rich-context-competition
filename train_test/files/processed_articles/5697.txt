    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis research surveys how graduate level urban planning students think about social justice and equity issues and how\nacademic instruction in urban planning affects the disposition of students toward these issues and themes in the context of\ntheir development as urban planning professionals. Although the quantitative findings did not demonstrate that the graduate\ncurriculum and instruction had any appreciable impact on student understanding and navigation of equity and social justice\nthemes, qualitative evidence did suggest that students are understanding and care about issues related to social justice and\nequity and were interested in incorporating those issues into their professional practice. This research also suggests that\ngraduate academic instruction may fall short in supporting students with the useful integration of social justice and equity\nissues into their professional practice.\n",

If urban planning instructors can gain more\ninsight into student disposition related to themes of social\njustice and equity, they can then contour and adjust their\npedagogical approaches and strategies in ways to more effec-\ntively engage students around those issues, as well as better\nsupport students in their efforts to integrate social justice and\nequity principles into their future professional practice.\nOverview\nThe Ideology of Social Justice and Equity in\nPlanning\nNotwithstanding the complexities of developing a social-\njustice-oriented curriculum as well as the inherent pedagogical\nchallenges related to its delivery, there has been a growing\ninterest in advancing social justice and equity as an important\nethic for promoting human rights (Johnston, 2009). Within\nthe discipline of urban planning, a practice tradition of advo-\ncacy planning emerged in the 1960s, which focused on\npromoting equitable and socially just communities (Davidoff,\nconcerns about planning education and its need to address\nissues related to diverse communities has taken the form of\ndiscussions about culturally competent planning education\nProfessional planners commit to embracing notions of\nsocial and racial justice as an aspiration in their code of eth-\nics and professional conduct (American PlanningAssociation\n[APA]; 2009). Within the advocacy planning approach, now\noften referred to as the \"progressive planning\" approach\n(Clavel, 1986), there exists a fundamental set of beliefs that\nvalue democratic principles of inclusion and participation\nand encourage planners to play an active role in creating\nsocially and economically just and sustainable communities.\nThat said, there is evidence that the progressive values of\nplanning are having difficulty finding resonance and oppor-\ntunity to flourish in planning practice in such a way that they\ncan advance a vision and possibility that embraces equity\n1University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nKirk E.

Harris1\n Keywords\ngraduate urban planning education, teaching and instruction related to social justice and equity issues, progressive planning\npractice and advocacy planning, professional urban planning training\n2 SAGE Open\nIn 1965, a period of moral and social reckoning in\nAmerica, Paul Davidoff posited this thought about the role of\nplanners in promoting democratic and participatory princi-\nples in planning:\nThe recommendation that city planners represent and plead the\nplans of many interest groups is founded upon the need to\nestablish an effective urban democracy, one in which citizens\nmay be able to play an active role in the process of deciding\npublic policy. Appropriate policy in a democracy is determined\nthrough a process of political debate. The right course of action\nis always a matter of choice, never of fact. In a bureaucratic age\ngreat care must be taken that choices remain in the area of public\nview and participation. The ideals of inclusiveness, democracy\nand public participation remain fundamental to community-\nDavidoff challenged planning educators to train planners\nin ways that required them to invoke their skills to serve\nunderrepresented low-income communities, as well as\nadvance social objectives and transformative social policy\nsuch that racial inequality, economic disenfranchisement,\nsocial exclusion, and gender and class bias can be contem-\nplated and grappled with by students in the context of their\nfuture planning practice (Checkoway, 1994). In fact, the pro-\nmotion of these ideals and values associated with planning\npractice have been argued to be the most persuasive\napproach--if not the only compelling one--for planners to\nassume as they seek to reconcile their professionalism with\ntheir political engagement (Marris, 1994; Krumholz &\nForester, 1990). Yet, the social justice and equity concerns of\nplanning must be understood in the context of the political\nhistory and the political economy of the United States.\nFainstein and Fainstein (1971) posit that\nThe United States for a variety of historical and cultural reasons\nhas been dominated by the liberal tradition. This tradition values\nindividualism, accepts the primacy of private interests, and\nprefers minimal government. Thus, the very notion of planning,\nwhich assumes an overriding and ascertainable public interest\nthat can be maximized through the positive actions of\ngovernment is antithetical to general American political values.\nThe liberal ideology that is decidedly in favor of unfet-\ntered free markets makes it very apparent that any planning\npractice seeking to address the redistributive injustice and\ninequity of the free market is subject to considerable scrutiny\nand countervailing pressure by dominant institutional and\nprivate sector interests. As Markusen noted,\nThe urban planning profession is losing the battle with\neconomics for the shaping of urban space in part because\nplanners value equity as a normative criterion, whereas\neconomics values market efficiency. Efficiency has won out in\nwhatever war of values might have taken place. (Markusen,\nNavigating the realities of the economic markets and the\npolitical environment becomes a key attribute of the plan-\nning practitioner's reality and is of significant concern for\nthose seeking to infuse social justice and equity priorities\ninto their practice. A series of writings by planning scholars\nin the Spring 1994 volume of the American Planning\nAssociation Journal examined in retrospect Paul Davidoff's\nnotion of advocacy planning.1 It was evident that the\nadvancement of equity and social justice objectives remained\nsalient, if not fundamental to the vision of planning as con-\nceived by Davidoff and advanced by many others, even\nthough the various commentators articulate their own unique\ninsights and challenges associated with implementing\nDavidoff's social-justice-oriented planning approach. What is\nalso evident from those commentaries is that the relevance\nand contribution of planning practice rest on the core values\nof inclusion, equity, and justice that form the democratic con-\ntext in which planning must be positioned.Also manifested in\nthe commentaries are a set of ideals closely held by an earlier\ngeneration of planning scholars and practitioners who con-\nsciously embrace their role as change agents (Thomas, 2006,\nSocial Justice and Equity Pedagogy and the\nTraining of Urban Planning Professionals\nProgressive planning professionals, academics, and practitio-\nners alike, many of whom whose worldviews were shaped by\ntheir experience with or being youthful observers of the civil\nrights movement, recognize that today's planning students\nmay have little or no framework to draw upon, which allows\nthem to understand or translate principles of social justice and\nthere is concern that today's planning students, many of\nwhom grew up in the post-civil rights era, may have little\ninterest or disposition toward issues of equity and social jus-\ntice. This concern is heightened as there is a growing percep-\ntion that the United States is now moving into a post-racial\nera with the election of its first African American president,\nsuggesting that issues related to discrimination, social disad-\nvantage, and equity are becoming less relevant for planners\nand the discipline as a whole. Thomas (2006), who is recog-\nnized for her scholarship related to advancing diversity and\nprogressive ideals in the planning field through pedagogical\nmeans, and who is also a proponent for aggressive recruit-\nment of diverse individuals within the student body and plan-\nning school faculty, suggests the planning field would be\nbetter positioned to advance issues of equity and social justice\nif it were more racially diverse. She contends that increasing\ndiversity within the planning field would heighten the \"moti-\nvation\" of the field to champion the cause of equity and social\njustice; at present, this is not occurring to the degree it should\nbecause the \"pain\" of those diverse communities is often \"left\nat the door\" and never allowed to cross the threshold into the\nProfessional urban planners serve an important role in cit-\nies, often acting as facilitators and mediators in rationalizing\nthe use of urban space, the deployment of municipal and\ncommunity resources, and the allocation of community and\neconomic development opportunities. Arguably, planners\nmust achieve these objectives by asserting their role as a\nmediating influence that balances the needs and interests of\nprivate sector stakeholders with efforts to promote the greater\npublic good.2 The balancing of the public good with the\nneeds and interests of private stakeholders essentially trans-\nlates into the ultimate distribution of costs and benefits\nwithin communities, which of course has tremendous bear-\ning on equity and social justice outcomes. The professional\nplanning code of ethics requires practitioners to consider\nissues of race, class, and gender as a context for advancing\nsocial justice and equity. There is an expectation that stu-\ndents will be equipped in their training to engage and man-\nage equity matters within the context of their professional\npractice. Although there are numerous skills, technical capa-\nbilities, and various sensibilities that planning instructors\nmust help students develop to ensure their effectiveness as\nplanning professionals, there is also a firmly held belief that\nit is equally critical for those teaching in planning schools\ntoday to help students develop a concern for social justice\nbefore they enter professional life (Thomas, 2006).\nAccording to a 2011 Association of Collegiate Schools of\nPlanning (ACSP) Diversity Taskforce Report, African\nAmerican and Latino faculty and students are grossly under-\nrepresented inAmerican planning programs (Wubneh, 2011).\nThis suggests we should not only aggressively work to diver-\nsify planning classrooms and planning faculties, but we must\nalso infuse the planning program curriculum with opportuni-\nties for students and faculty--all across the ethnic, racial,\ngender, and economic spectrum--to understand the strug-\ngles, the frustration, and inequalities that too often define the\nexperiences of low-income and working-class communities,\nand particularly low-income communities of color.\nUnderstanding how students think about issues of social jus-\ntice and equity is the first step in moving students along a\ncontinuum of development from a \"polite appreciation\" of\nsocial justice and equity issues to a transformational internal-\nization of these issues as a mandate of professional practice.\nResearch Question\nThe question this exploratory research investigated was\nthreefold: (a) what are the fundamental opinions, beliefs, and\nvalues that urban planning students hold related to social jus-\ntice and equity issues; (b) how does academic instruction\ninfluence the beliefs, opinions, and values of urban planning\nstudents, as well as support their embracing of social justice\nand equity issues in their professional practice; and (c) how\ndo students generally feel about how well social justice and\nequity issues are integrated into the instruction and the cur-\nriculum of their program?\nResearch Methods\nSurvey Design\nThis study involved a survey (see Appendix A) of first and\nsecond year Master of Urban Planning (MUP) students. The\nsurvey queried MUP students on their opinions, beliefs, and\nvalues related to social justice and equity in the context of\ntheir roles as aspiring urban planning professionals. The sur-\nvey was distributed during the initial and final semesters of\nthe students' tenure in the program to gain an understanding\nof the influence of the program on student social justice per-\nspectives. The MUP classes were defined by the year the stu-\ndents entered in the program. The class of 2008 was sampled\nprior to students exiting the program, the class of 2009 was\nsampled both in the first and final semesters of the program,\nand the class of 2010 was sampled during the initial semester\nof the program. This stratified sampling technique allowed\nfor the capturing of students across three different class years.\nThe survey included 10 multiple choice questions and one\nopen-ended question that asked students to offer suggestions\non how the MUP program might improve on its curriculum\nin dealing with issues of race, class, gender, and other social\njustice-related topics. Six of the survey questions (Questions\n1-6) aimed to measure the students' attitudes toward social\njustice and equity by offering students mini-vignettes for\nthem to respond to, which measured the intensity of their\nsupport for social justice and equity themes. Questions 1 and\n2 sought to gauge student perspectives on the role of profes-\nsional planners in propagating social justice and equity ide-\nals. Question 3 assessed student perspectives on the scope\nand purpose of planning intervention in the context of equity\nand social justice. Questions 4 and 5 evaluated student beliefs\nrelated to the efficacy of planners in advancing social justice\nand equity outcomes in their practice. Question 6 sought to\nhighlight student perspectives on the academic instruction\nstrategies that encourage awareness and exploration of social\njustice and equity issues. The intensity levels of student\nresponses were characterized as a low, moderate, or high\nlevel of social justice activism toward social justice and\nequity themes. Four questions (Questions 7-10) gathered\npredictor information about the students' background, such\nas comfort discussing topics related to social justice and\nequity, earlier educational exposure to social justice and\nequity themes, student perceptions as to whether social jus-\ntice and equity concerns will be relevant to their professional\npractice or work experience, and student perceptions of the\neffectiveness of their graduate level program in addressing\nissues of social justice and equity.\nSample\nTable 1 shows the total enrollment of students in the MUP\nprogram during the period of the administration of the sur-\nvey. As we observe, 58 (85%) of the students in the program\nare White, with White men and White women comprising\n4 SAGE Open\n62% and 23%, respectively, of the total population of stu-\ndents. The MUP program had one African American student,\ntwo Native American students, three Asian American stu-\ndents, three Latino students, and one foreign-born student\nof the total population of students.\nTable 2 shows the demographic distribution for the first and\nsecond year classes of students who were surveyed. The\ndemographics for the first and second year classes illustrates\nthat within both classes substantially more than 50% of the\nstudents are White men, with White women comprising 20%\nor more of the student sample. In terms of the racial demo-\ngraphics, there are no significant differences in the racial com-\nposition of the first and second year classes. Therefore, we\nwould not expect any difference between the first and second\nyear student response rates based on class demographics.\nAnalytical Methods\nThe survey data were combined according to when the stu-\ndents were surveyed; thus individual response data were\ncombined so that the responses from individuals just begin-\nning the program (i.e., first year students) were aggregated,\nand responses from individuals who were in their second\nyear and who had completed the program were aggregated.\nThis allowed us to compare the responses of students who\nwere at the beginning of their tenure to those who were com-\npleting their tenure in the MUP program. To summarize the\nresults of the closed-ended survey responses, descriptive sta-\ntistics were developed. Bar charts were produced to assess\nthe aggregate response patterns and differences in responses\nof students who were in their initial year of the MUP pro-\ngram as compared with the responses of students who were\ncompleting the program. A series of chi-square tests were\nconducted to determine whether there were significant dif-\nferences in the responses between first and second year stu-\ndents and to determine whether there was any relationship\nbetween student responses to Questions 1 through 6 and the\npredictor data collected from student responses to Questions\n7 to 10. Finally, responses to the open-ended questions were\nanalyzed by grouping them thematically and then undertak-\ning a thorough review of those responses.\nResults\nStudent responses to the closed-ended questions were\nassessed as being low, moderate, or high in terms of social\njustice activism based on how supportive the student was of\nTable 1.

Figures 1 and 2 compare the response distribution of\nfirst and second year students to Questions 1 to 6 of the sur-\nvey. The general trend is that both first and second year stu-\ndents have a tendency to display moderate or high levels of\nactivism attitudes across all questions.\nOver 75% of students from both the first and second grad-\nuate class years express either a moderate- or high-level dis-\nposition toward social justice activism, as compared with the\napproximately 20% to 25% of students who demonstrate a\ndisposition for low levels of activism relative to social justice\nand equity. However, a more detailed comparison of the\nresponses from first and second year students indicates some\nstudents' attitudes toward social justice shifted between their\ninitial and final years in the graduate program. The survey\ndistribution results suggest some fluctuation among respon-\ndents identifying with moderate versus low levels of activ-\nism, with slightly more second year students having a\npreference for low levels of activism attitudes and slightly\nmore first year students having a preference for moderate\nlevels of activism.\nThirty three percent of all students surveyed displayed a\ndisposition for high levels of activism, with the exceptions of\nsecond year student responses in relationship to Question 4,\nwhich assessed student perceptions of the efficacy of urban\nplanners. In Question 4, there was a decline in the percentage\nof second year students who strongly believed in the efficacy\nof planner, less than 25% as compared with their first year\nFigure 1.

The percent-\nage of high activism preferences varied by question, but nei-\nther class demonstrated a substantially greater preference for\nhigh levels of activism. A substantial number of students\nwithin the sample displayed a disposition for moderate levels\nof activism.\nAlthough there are similar trends in the social justice atti-\ntudes of first and second year graduate classes, some differ-\nences in responses to particular questions were found.\nOverall, first year students tended to be slightly more likely\nto show moderate activism versus high activism disposition\nwhen compared with second year students. In all questions\n(except for Question 2, which examined students' perspec-\ntive on the role of professional planners in propagating social\njustice and equity ideals in the context historical patterns of\nracial and gender discrimination and exclusion in the United\nStates), a greater percentage of first year students than sec-\nond year students selected a moderate response. With respect\nto Question 5, which highlights the role of professional plan-\nners in addressing issues of economic and social justice, first\nyear students had a much larger moderate activism response\nas compared with second year students, who tended to dis-\nplay a preference for low activism. Questions 3 and 4 asked\nstudents about their perspectives related to the role of plan-\nners in promoting equitable market outcomes and the power\nof planners to influence policy decisions, respectively. For\nboth of these questions, moderate social justice activism atti-\ntudes were markedly greater in first year students compared\nwith second year students.\nOverall, the survey distribution results suggest that a\nslightly greater number of second year students demonstrated\na low activism disposition when compared with first year\nstudents. In all questions except for Questions 6 and 2 (that\ndealt with instructional strategies that encourage social jus-\ntice awareness and the planner's role in propagating social\njustice given historic patterns of racial and gender inequality,\nrespectively), no students selected a low activism response.\nMore second year students showed a disposition toward low-\nlevel activism compared to their first year counterparts. This\npattern reveals that while the majority of students held mod-\nerate or high activist stances in both their initial and final\nyears in the program, there was a shift among some students\nin their second year of the program, more second year stu-\ndents demonstrated a lower level activism disposition toward\nsocial justice issues as those students neared completion of\nthe master's program. Consequently, the results may indicate\nthat some students become more neutral or dispassionate\nabout social justice and equity issues as they progress to the\nfinal year of the program.\nMean Values of Social Justice Activism Responses\nThe mean values of response percentages of first and second\nyear students were compared to examine how the program\ncurriculum may have influenced student perceptions regard-\ning social justice activism. Table 3 shows the trends in the\nmean values associated with the student responses.\nNotwithstanding the aforementioned difference between first\nand second year student responses discussed earlier, there\nappears to be no statistically significant distinction between\nYear 1 and Year 2 students with respect to their attitudes\ntoward social justice activism. The percentages of social jus-\ntice disposition responses were also evaluated by year: first\nyear (initial year) and second year (final year) in the program.\nIt appears that matriculation through the MUP program does\nnot affect student disposition toward social activism.\nChi-Square Analysis of Predictor Data and Levels\nof Student Disposition Toward Social Justice\nActivism\nTable 4 provides a snapshot of aggregate student responses\nto the Predictor Questions 7 to 10. Student responses to the\npredictor questions were categorized as low, moderate, or\nhigh. A chi-square analysis was used to determine whether\nany relationship exists between the four predictor variables\n(as measured by Questions 7-10) and student responses to\nthe social justice activism categories (as measured by\nTable 5 highlights the relationship between students' dis-\nposition toward social justice activism and their level of\nexperience and exposure to social justice issues in previous\nacademic settings. Results suggest that for first year and sec-\nond year students, there appear to be no statistically signifi-\ncant relationship between their former educational experience\nand their disposition toward social justice activism.Although\na significant number of first year students with limited or no\nexposure to social justice themes in their previous educa-\ntional experience demonstrated a disposition toward high\nlevels of social justice activism, this was significantly less\ntrue for second year students.\nWith respect to the connection between comfort level (as\nit relates to discussing social justice issues) and student dis-\nposition toward activism, Table 6 suggests that there is no\nrelationship between levels of comfort and disposition\ntoward social justice activism for either first or second year\nstudents. However, a significant number of first year stu-\ndents who indicated a moderate to high level of comfort\nengaging social justice themes also demonstrated a greater\ndisposition toward high social justice activism. This trend is\nalso present among second year students, with fewer stu-\ndents expressing moderate comfort and more expressing\nhigh levels of comfort with social justice themes. These sec-\nond year students also expressed a preference for a higher\nlevel of social justice activism.\nAlthough not statistically significant, the data in Table 7\nillustrate that first and second year students who believe\nequity issues will be or might possibly be important in their\nwork as a professional planner are more likely to express a\ndisposition toward a high level of social justice activism.\nFinally, although not statistically significant, the findings in\nTable 8 show a tendency for first and second year students\nwho indicate that the MUP program does a good job in\naddressing equity issues to also display a disposition toward\nhigh levels of social justice activism.\nAs discussed, matriculation through the MUP program did\nnot have any statistically significant effect on student disposi-\ntion toward social activism.

That said, some students who\nshowed more comfort toward engaging in social justice\nissues also were more likely to have higher levels of activ-\nism. This finding suggests that these students' disposition\ntoward higher levels of social justice activism can be attrib-\nuted to something outside of the realm of their classroom\nexperience, indicating the need for more experiential or more\napplied learning opportunities.\nIt should be noted that the sample size may have limited\nthe usefulness of the results from this specific data survey.\nHowever, the data trends in the study regarding the curricu-\nlum's impact on student disposition toward social justice and\nequity suggest that (a) the instruction on issues of social jus-\ntice and equity in planning had little or no impact or (b) there\nwere not enough classes or opportunities for discussion\nabout social justice and equity in the program to create a sus-\ntained resonance with the students.\nQualitative Findings: Student\nReflections and Comments\nThe final question on the survey was open-ended, asking stu-\ndents to offer ideas related to integrating race, class, and gen-\nder issues into the MUP program curriculum. Students\noffered a number of thoughts, reflections, and strategies for\nimproving the delivery and approach to promoting social\njustice and equity themes within the instructional framework\nof the curriculum.\nThe students' comments were organized into four basic\ncategories:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Appreciating the complexity of the social justice\ndialogue\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Preparation for the social justice dialogue\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Advancing strategies for teaching and learning as it\nrelates to social justice issues\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Exploring new instructional options for supporting\ndiscussion of social justice and equity issues\nAppreciating the Complexity of the Social Justice\nDialogue\nThe program discusses the issue but places little emphasis on\nhow to respond to it. The program is too focused on the built\nform of planning rather than on issues that are often unseen.\nStudents often acknowledged the complexity of the social\njustice dialogue, as evidenced by one student's question: \" . . .\nhow do we balance the need to be neutral and technical\nexperts, yet incorporate social justice into that?\" They saw\nthat social justice comprises areas of emphasis including\nenvironmental problems, class issues, education, affordable\nhousing, safe living environments, and more. Students stated\nthat race and class issues are becoming even more important\nTable 8. Social Justice Disposition Response to Question 10: What Statement Most Accurately Describes What You Think?\nSocial justice disposition response\nMUP program does a\npoor job addressing\nequity issues\nMUP program does\na fair job addressing\nequity issues\nMUP program does a\ngood job addressing\nequity issues Total\ntoday, and that it is important to not overlook the historical\ncontext of socioeconomic issues. Students desired more dis-\ncussions to address these issues essential to planning prac-\ntice. Examples mentioned for study were the intertwining of\nenvironmental problems and social justice, mixed-income\nneighborhood planning, and practical ways to address social\njustice issues in everyday planning practice.\nPreparation for the Social Justice Dialogue\nOverall, I think educators still believe it is a \"touchy\" subject\nand may try to shy away from it. However, I feel it is relevant to\nlearn/talk about it. Personally, when in a group of all whites I\nfeel comfortable talking about it, but when I am in a mixed\ngroup, I feel uncomfortable and slightly embarrassed.\nRather than shying away from dialogue about social justice,\nstudents embraced it and lamented that the academic program\ndid not do more to foster it. They wanted social justice to be\ndirectly addressed in class and wanted professors to have train-\ning on how to facilitate these types of discussions. Some stu-\ndents felt social justice and equity issues were only discussed in\nclasses as tangential side topics and others noted a lack of com-\nfort in discussing sensitive issues of race and class, especially\nwith other students of a much different background.\nAdvancing Strategies for Teaching and Learning\nas it Relates to Social Justice Issues\n[LOCATION] is a place full of local race, class and gender\nissues. More real local examples would be helpful to hit the\npoint home.\nStudents expressed an awareness of the fact that their class\nlacked racial and ethnic diversity and wished for more opportu-\nnities to discuss social justice and equity issues in class. They\nacknowledged privilege and felt it was important for them to get\nout of the classroom and their comfort zones and into the com-\nmunity. Students wanted case studies, seminars, and a required\nsocial justice course that directly works on building solutions\nand strategies that address social and economic inequality.\nExploring New Instructional Options for\nSupporting Exploration Into Social Justice Themes\nI think one of the Planning Policy Analysis course cases should\nbe centered on these issues (one or all of them) to give us some\npractical experience to go along with what we have learned in\nclass. Hearing about the issues and actually experiencing the\ndifficulties associated with solving/improving them are very\ndifferent, and I believe that could be addressed while we are still\nin the structured and controlled setting that the program provides.\nSome students expressed their desire for a class dedicated\nto social justice and equity issues. Many believed such a class\nshould be mandatory and that the urban planning program\nshould suggest classes for them to take outside of the pro-\ngram if none were available within urban planning. Students\nwanted to see topics of race, class, and gender discussed in\nless of an abstract context and in more historical and practi-\ncal ways. They wanted applied classes so they would be able\nto serve their community at large while being exposed to race\nand class issues in a controlled and structured environment.\nSuggestions were made for the planning program to connect\nwith community leaders who are already working on issues\nof social justice and equity: \"We need real-life case studies\ndealing with these issues. Also, dealing with race, class, and\ngender issues require a base knowledge of economics and\npolitical science, so incorporating these into the curriculum\nwould be beneficial as well.\"\nThe students'comments and reflections offer some impor-\ntant insights for instructional and pedagogical consider-\nations. In general, students believe social justice issues need\nto be given more emphasis and support, with higher levels of\nspecificity and regularity in terms of course materials, class\ndiscussion, and opportunities to be exposed to community\nand professional stakeholders who navigate the complexities\nof social justice issues in their daily lives and/or practice.\nStudents express a desire for effectively facilitated, frank,\nand balanced discourse about social justice and equity that is\nsolution oriented and practice focused. Students also\nexpressed an interest in having more courses available to\nthem specifically dedicated to social justice issues and\nthemes: \"I think issues of race, class, and gender should be\ndirectly addressed through instruction when talking about\nplanning. It's important! Instruction on diversity topics by\ndiverse instructors educated on the issues.\"\nComparing these qualitative comments with the quantita-\ntive findings, it is fair to conclude that urban planning pro-\ngrams should look for ways to better integrate social justice\nand equity topics into their current coursework and to poten-\ntially establish a new class or classes focusing exclusively on\nurban social justice. Because students with greater comfort\nlevels involving discussion are also likely to be more ori-\nented toward social justice, instructors should find ways for\nthese students to help lead discussions. All students will\nenter discussions with different comfort levels, and it is\nimportant to create a safe atmosphere.\nPlanning programs might also consider surveying their\nnew students and graduating students on an ongoing basis to\ntrack changes in social justice activism, and to make changes\nto the curriculum accordingly. Programs also have to be stra-\ntegic in terms of increasing the confidence of second year\nindividuals who might experience a drop in confidence from\nYear 1 to Year 2 in term of being able to integrate social jus-\ntice and equity practices into their professional career.\nThere is a likelihood that second year students' confidence\nlevels declined because they gained a greater understanding of\nthe political issues that can stand in the way of change.\nEducators should inspire students and ensure social-justice-\nand equity-focused planning education prepares students for\nthe challenges ahead so that students are empowered and not\ndiscouraged by the difficulties and barriers they may con-\nfront in advancing a social justice and equity agenda as an\nimportant component of their professional practice.\nConclusion\nWe should be exposed to more situations where there are persons\nof different races/classes to feel out what it is like to do work in\nthat context.\nThis exploratory study offers some interesting insights\ninto the disposition of graduate planning students toward\nsocial justice activism. Survey results showed students of all\nraces and genders are very much in tune with and care about\nissues related to social justice and equity. The first and sec-\nond year class cohorts of the MUP program covered under\nthis study displayed moderate to high levels of support for\nthe application of social justice and equity issues in the con-\ntext of their training as professional planners. A significant\nnumber of students in the class cohorts covered by the survey\ntended to enter into the MUP program with a disposition\ntoward high levels of social justice activism. This was true\neven when they had limited or no exposure to social justice\nissues in their previous academic experiences. It appears the\nMUP program attracts planning students who have support-\nive views of social justice activism within the context of\nplanning practice. However, as students matriculated through\nthe program, the curriculum did not appear to have much\neffect on the disposition of students toward social justice\nactivism. Notably, second year students displayed more of a\ntendency toward low levels of social justice activism. This\nmay suggest that if students are introduced to complex social\njustice concepts but are not also given strategies to navigate\nthe realities of these issues within their professional practice,\nthey may default to a disposition toward lower levels of\nsocial justice activism.\nA significant number of students felt moderately comfort-\nable talking about issues related to race, class, and gender\nand also believed that issues of social justice will possibly be\nimportant in their practice as professional planners, which is\ncertainly an important foundation upon which to build from\na pedagogical vantage point. In the words of one respondent,\n\"Talking about it in the classroom helps, but getting us out of\nour comfort zone will do more.\" There was a mixed opinion\namong students about the effectiveness of the program with\nrespect to engaging issues around social justice. However,\nthere was a general sense that more applied and practical\nknowledge related to these issues would serve students more\neffectively as they prepare for professional practice:\nI think the program addresses these concepts well enough in\nclass, but could put more emphasis on how to work for these\nconcepts in a tangible way. Race and class issues are especially\ndifficult to approach, since those are usually multi-faceted\nproblems.\nThat said, many students also expressed an interest in\nbeing challenged and inspired to promote social justice and\nequity in their professional practice. Moreover, many stu-\ndents from the first and second year classes indicated they\nwould be working for organizations after graduation where\nissues of race, class, and gender would be important consid-\nerations within their work.\nThe findings of this study are limited but encouraging.\nPlanning students continue to show interest in upholding val-\nues of social justice within the context of their planning prac-\ntice. The comments from students, which capture some of\nthe qualitative aspects of the research, suggests that student\ninput can play a significant and strategic role in helping plan-\nning programs consider how instructional and pedagogical\napproaches might be improved to better support student\nlearning. This is an important charge for faculty within plan-\nning schools, which deserves to be taken seriously. More\nresearch is needed to perfect strategies for introducing and\nmanaging social justice and equity issues and themes within\nthe planning curriculum. These issues related to social\njustice and equity are only becoming far more complex,\nnuanced, and challenging to understand and manage. Future\nresearch might focus on surveying a larger sample of stu-\ndents across a few planning schools to see if the trends sug-\ngested here are generalizable and provide insight for\nrecommended changes to planning programs that could be\nadvocated for and adopted.\nAppendix A: Questionaire\nSurvey instrument.\nAppendix B: Summary of All\nQualitative Student Responses Group\nby Catagory\nOpen-Ended Questionnaire Responses\nAppreciating the Complexity of the Social Justice Dialogue\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"As professionals how do we balance the need to be\nneutral and technical experts, yet incorporate social\njustice into that?\"\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"The department does a good job of bringing social\njustice issues to the forefront. Although, I believe it is\nimportant to balance social justice along with the\nother facets of planning. Not drown out other impor-\ntant discussions.\"\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"Want more discussion on environmental issues and\nsocial justice. Locating of factories or pollutant trad-\ning near economically depressed or minority areas.\nHow do we plan for infrastructure in relationship to\nthese areas?\"\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"I think class issues are becoming more relevant today\nand are much more often overlooked. Mixed income\nneighborhood planning would be really interesting to\nstudy--both how it could be successful and why it\nisn't attempted often in the United States.\"\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"The program discusses the issue but places little\nemphasis on how to respond to it. The program is too\nfocused on the built form of planning rather than on\nissues that are often unseen.\"\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"Critical to make clear to students gender, racial, and\nsocioeconomic problems of the past are not fully\nresolved because we feel the impacts of that legacy in\nthe way our world is organized today, that is, who has\npower, who is politically active, the segregation of cit-\nies, and the complete disproportionate sharing of eco-\nnomic factors such as the means of production. Also,\naccess to proper/good education, affordable housing,\nand a safe environment.\"\nPreparation for the Social Justice Dialogue\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"Overall, I think educators still believe it is a `touchy'\nsubject and may try to shy away from it. However, I\nfeel it is relevant to learn/talk about it. Personally,\nwhen in a group of all Whites I feel comfortable talk-\ning about it, but when I am in a mixed group, I feel\nuncomfortable and slightly embarrassed.\"\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"Consider cultural sensitivity training, cross-training\nwith different programs, and prepare professors to\nfacilitate and discuss these issues.\"\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"Teach as part of courses but do not preach.\"\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"I think issues of race, class, and gender should be\ndirectly addressed through instruction when talking\nabout planning. It's important! Instruction on diver-\nsity topics by diverse instructors educated on the\nissues.\"\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"I have not been exposed to many classes yet. However,\nof the classes I have had, there doesn't seem to be as\nmuch discussion of race, class, or gender as there could\nbe. A lot of times, it seems to be brought up as an aside\nor an afterthought. I have had a lot of educational back-\nground with issues of diversity so I may share a differ-\nent viewpoint from others. I really believe the program\nneeds to make more effort to not just educate students\nabout diversity but to also have open, engaging discus-\nsions about it. People can be scared to do this at first,\nbut it is the only way you can start to get comfortable\nwith issues that initially feel very uncomfortable.\"\nAdvancing Strategies for Teaching and Learning as It Relates to\nSocial Justice Issues\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"We all understand the problems--but only in limited\ncapacity. I think there should be more invitations to\nplanning professionals who face political/economic\nhurdles in addressing the issues of race/class.\"\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"For a largely privileged, White class to understand\nrace, there has to be more interaction. A required class\ndealing with social justice with a project in a minority\nneighborhood that deals with structural issues. Talking\nabout it in the classroom helps, but getting us out of\nour comfort zone will do more.\"\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"[LOCATION] is a place full of local race, class, and\ngender issues. More real local examples would be\nhelpful to hit the point home.\"\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"Emphasize solutions to inequities more.\"\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"By providing seminars in related topics where profes-\nsionally how to apply it should be properly understood.\"\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"Continue with the discussion, but combine it with\nmore case studies from around the nation.\"\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"I think the program addresses these concepts well\nenough in class, but could put more emphasis on how\nto work for these concepts in a tangible way. Race and\nclass issues are especially difficult to approach, since\nthose are usually multi-faceted problems.\"\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"We should be exposed to more situations where there\nare persons of different races/classes to feel out what\nit is like to do work in that context.\"\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"Try to enroll more women and minorities into the\nprogram, if possible. Highlight women and minorities\nin lectures/discussion/readings. Mix-up classroom\nactivities.\"\nNew Instructional Infrastructure for Supporting Exploration Into\nSocial JusticeThemes\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"Dedicate a specific course solely to social justice\nissues.\"\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"Explore more case studies related to these issues.\"\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"I think a mandatory ethnic studies component should\nbe enacted. I think these issues are central to things we\nwill encounter in our professional lives.\"\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"We should add a mandatory core class which deals\nwith gender, race, equity, and the planning process--\nboth throughout history and currently.\"\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"Issues of diversity are often glossed over in class. I\nbelieve that a multicultural/diversity issues class\nshould be required in the planning program.\"\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"Offer more courses on race issues. Have more mate-\nrial on race presented during required courses. Maybe\nhave a `specialty' division of the MUP program that\ndeals with these issues. The program should suggest\ncourses if they're not available in School of\nArchitecture and Urban Planning.\"\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"I think one of the Planning Policy Analysis course\ncases should be centered on these issues (one or all of\nthem) to give us some practical experience to go along\nwith what we have learned in class. Hearing about the\nissues and actually experiencing the difficulties asso-\nciated with solving/improving them are very different,\nand I believe that could be addressed while we are still\nin the structured and controlled setting that the pro-\ngram provides.\"\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"More discussions/reading about planning history/\ntheory that concern issues of race, class, and gender\nissues and much more emphasis when discussing eco-\nnomic tools that developers and planners use about\nexactly what these data sets/calculations quantify and\nthe inherent class/racial assumptions within.\"\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"The first year, first semester approaches the issue on\na very abstract basis. Issues of social justice are men-\ntioned, and equity/advocacy/participatory planning\nmethods are praised or deemed correct, without much\nrational argument to support the conclusion. Although\nwe look at historical planning processes, not much is\nsaid as to why, or what effect, these earlier planning\nactions and theories contribute to our current situa-\ntions. However, if it is a stated priority of the program,\nthen a mandatory class can be constructed to deal with\nsocial stratification, inequality, and social justice\nissues. I would say the most important thing is to get\nout and get practical. You don't have to step far from\nour East Side of [LOCATION] Ivory Tower to come\nface to face with communities facing serious chal-\nlenges in this regard. Get the planning program tightly\nhooked up with CBOs working in these fields, and let\nthe students see how it's lived, and involved in the\nefforts. This is a powerful opportunity for learning\nand serving.\"\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"I think, at present the MUP program just touches\nupon race/class and or gender issues with respect to\nplanning history. For a deeper understanding of these\nissues, maybe a joint seminar or lecture series with the\nsociology department may help.Also, at least, an over-\nview on these issues on an international level is\nrequired. This would offer a good platform to compare\nsocial issues in America with other nations/regions\n(developed or developing).\"\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"I think the program as a whole does a good job\nof discussing these issues. More focus could be\ngiven to the specific segregation issues we face in\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"We need real-life case studies dealing with these\nissues. Also, dealing with race, class, and gender\nissues require a base knowledge of economics and\npolitical science, so incorporating these into the cur-\nriculum would be beneficial as well.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nNotes\n1.
