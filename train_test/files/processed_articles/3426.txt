    "abstract": "Abstract\nHumans are equipped with a psychological system of followership that evolved to regulate choices of leaders based partly on\nwould-be leaders' physiological features. One such feature is voice pitch, which is determined by the physiology of the throat.\nRecent studies find that political candidates in modern elections with lower-pitched voices are generally more successful. As\nlower-pitched voices are perceived as stronger and more dominant, these findings have been taken to indicate a general pre-\nference for dispositional abilities in leaders to protect and prevail in conflicts. Here we extend upon these findings by demon-\nstrating that conservatives and Republicans tend to view the world as much more competitive and threatening than liberals and\nDemocrats. We utilize two existing data sources to show that political candidates with lower-pitched voices are preferred more\namong conservative Republicans than among liberal Democrats. In a third study we show that preferences for lower-pitched\ncandidate voices stem from individual differences in Social Dominance Orientation (SDO). Importantly, across all three studies\nsubjects' party affiliation, ideology, and SDO only predict preferences for male candidate voices. We conclude with a discussion of\nthe results in relation to followership psychology and general debates on the rationality of the public with respect to elections.\n",

Klofstad2,3\n Keywords\nvoice pitch, voting, political candidates, political ideology, social dominance orientation\nIntroduction\nMultiple human psychological systems are designed to extract\ninformation about the dispositions of others from their voices.\nThe voice pitch of males, for example, correlates negatively with\ntraits such as their mate value, reproductive success, and invest-\nment in offspring, and people reliably utilize the voice pitch of\nothers to predict these traits in them (Apicella & Feinberg, 2009;\nJones, Little, Burt, & Perrett, 2005; Puts, Hodges, Ca\n\u00b4rdenas, &\nimportance of vocal information in human social interaction,\nresearch has recently demonstrated its role in another domain:\ndecisions to follow and support a particular leader. Specifically,\na number of studies utilizing experimental as well as real-world\nelectoral data find that candidates with lower pitched voices\nwin more votes (Anderson & Klofstad, 2012; Klofstad,\nO'Connor, Schandl, & Feinberg, 2012). Given that deeper\nvoices are associated with strength, dominant behavior,\nmuscularity, and masculinity (Evans, Neave, Wakelin, &\nference for low-pitched voices reflects a preference for dispo-\nsitional abilities in leaders to protect and prevail in conflict\n1 Department of Political Science and Government, Aarhus University, Aarhus,\nDenmark\n2 Department of Political Science, University of Miami, Coral Gables, FL, USA\n3 Department of Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nLasse Laustsen, Department of Political Science and Government, Aarhus\nUniversity, Aarhus, Denmark.\nEmail: ll@ps.au.dk\nEvolutionary Psychology\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.com/journalsPermissions.nav\nevp.sagepub.com\nCreative Commons CC-BY-NC: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 License\n(http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/) which permits non-commercial use, reproduction and distribution of the work without further\npermission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access page (https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).\nHowever, we still have limited knowledge about whether\nthese average effects reflect a general preference for leaders\nwith low-pitched voices or whether followers differ in their\npreferences for the dispositional cues available in a would-be\nleader's voice. In this article, we integrate research on follo-\nwership psychology into the study of voice effects (Laustsen &\nPetersen, 2015) and argue that followers strategically use voice\npitch cues in order to align themselves with the leaders who\nappear most competent, given the followers' perceptions of the\nsocial world and the corresponding problems confronting their\ngroup (Duckitt & Sibley, 2010; Hibbing, Smith, & Alford,\nthose who perceive the world as a competitive and dangerous\nplace should have stronger preferences for dominant leaders\nwho are perceived as capable of navigating conflicts (see\nLaustsen & Petersen, 2015). Others will often be better off with\na less dominant individual as leader.\nWe test these arguments across three studies of preferences\nfor lower pitched voices in political candidates in the United\nStates. In the realm of politics, reliable summary markers for\nindividual differences in perceptions of the social world are\nparty affiliations and political ideological predispositions.\nRepublicans and conservatives are much more likely than\nDemocrats and liberals to view the world as a competitive and\nIn Studies 1 and 2, we therefore utilize existing data sources\nwhether party affiliations and ideological leanings moderate pre-\nferences for candidates' voices. We find that Republicans and\nconservatives display a stronger preference for male political\ncandidates with lower pitched voices than do Democrats and\nliberals. In Study 3, we provide more in-depth evidence for the\npsychological basis for these effects. We find that perceiving\nsociety as a competitive jungle and being attuned to group-\nbased conflict (as measured by Social Dominance Orientation\n[SDO], cf. Duckitt & Sibley, 2010; Pratto, Sidanius, Stallworth,\n& Malle, 1994) helps explain the results from Studies 1 and 2.\nThe implications of these findings, as well as differences with\nrespect to preferences for male and female candidate voices, are\ndiscussed in the final section.\nFollowership Decisions: The Role of Context\nand Perceptions\nHumans are equipped with a compilation of psychological\nmechanisms that evolved to regulate choices of leaders\n(Laustsen & Petersen, 2015; Spisak, Dekker, Kru\n\u00a8ger, & van\nthe most competent leader has most likely conferred signifi-\ncant and positive fitness benefits to individual followers. For a\nsubstantial part of human evolution, leaders have served as\nfocal points within groups, coordinating individual behavior\nto solve collective problems. More competent leaders would\nceteris paribus have lead to better collective solutions and, as\na consequence, gains in individual fitness.\nIn order to arrive at adaptive followership decisions, the\npsychological system for followership should be designed to\ntake in all relevant cues of leadership competence and do so\nwith a flexible sensitivity to the particular circumstances of the\ngroup. In this regard, anthropological research suggests that\ndecision-making authority is typically granted to different indi-\nviduals depending on the type of problem facing one's group at\n2010). Perhaps the most direct illustration was the Native\nAmerican tradition for appointing two chiefs, one for situa-\ntions of war and one for situations of peace, each with a\nPsychological research has recently demonstrated that this\nreflects a general pattern: individuals prefer different leaders\nunder war and peace, respectively. The focus of most of this\nresearch has been facial masculinity as a cue of leader com-\npetence. A masculine face is reliably associated with percep-\ntions of being dominant and with actual aggressive and\ndominant behavior (Carr\u00b4\nGeniole, Keyes, Mondloch, Carr\u00b4\n\u00b4,\nHavli\n\u00b4cek, Roberts, Little, & Kleisner, 2013). Correspond-\ningly, a series of studies have found that leaders with more\nmasculine faces are preferred among subjects who are primed\nwith war or between-group conflict scenarios, while subjects\nwho are primed with peace or cooperation scenarios tend to\nprefer leaders with more feminine faces (Spisak, Dekker,\nDeBruine, Jones, & Perrett, 2013). Under conflict, individuals\nprefer a leader who can enforce collective action against the\nenemy. Under peace, in contrast, individuals feel no need to\nsubject themselves to a dominant, aggressive, and potentially,\nexploitive leader (for a discussion, see Laustsen & Petersen,\n2015). Recently, these findings have been extended to also\naccount for how individual differences among followers\nshape preferences for masculine-looking leaders. Paralleling\nthe findings on the contextual moderators of these prefer-\nences, individuals who tend to see the social world as a dan-\ngerous and conflict-ridden place in general show greater\npreferences for leaders with dominant faces (Laustsen &\nBecause human psychology is designed to draw inferences\nabout dominance and other dispositions not only from facial\ncues but also from vocal cues (cf. Feinberg, 2008), we should\nexpect to see similar patterns in preferences for leaders with\nlow-pitched voices, a reliable marker of dominance (Dabbs &\n2012). Consistent with this, one study has shown that sensitiv-\nity to physical prowess cues in voices is heightened during\nwartime (Tigue et al., 2012). In the present article, we extend\nthis finding and investigate how individual differences related\nto perceptions of conflict influence preferences for lower\npitched voices in the context of a key modern followership\ndecision, voting in elections.\n2 Evolutionary Psychology\nPredictions: Individual Differences\nand Preferences for Leaders With\nLow-Pitched Voices\nIn the domain of politics, research increasingly links differences\nin political ideology and party preferences to deep-seated person-\nality differences and to differences in fundamental perceptions of\nthe social world (Alford, Funk, & Hibbing, 2005; Caprara &\nconservatives and liberals basically ``experience and process dif-\nand Democrats, conservatives and Republicans are much more\nlikely to see the world as a competitive and dangerous place\nRepublicansand conservatives will exhibit a largerpreference for\nlower pitched candidate voices than will Democrats and liberals\n(the conservative Republican prediction). Republicans' and con-\nservatives' perception of the world as a hostile place should lead\nthem to put a premium on dominance in leaders. In the context of\nfacial cues to dominance, this prediction has already received\nsupport: individuals who vote for a right-wing party tend to prefer\nmore masculine leaders (Laustsen & Petersen, 2015). Here, we\ntest whether this also applies to vocal cues to dominance in the\nform of voice pitch.\nPsychological models of political ideology show that there\nare two fundamentally different types of perceptions of the\nsocial world that lead to conservative attitudes and vote choices.\nWhile an orientation toward social threats is at the center of both\ntypes of perceptions, the nature of these threats is different. Here,\nwe extend previous research by investigating which of the per-\nception types (if any) drive preferences for leaders with low-\npitched voices. By providing an in-depth investigation of the\nprecise psychological drivers of preference for lower pitched\nvoices, we stand to gain important insights into how and when\npreferences for dominant leaders emerge more generally.\nThe first perception that underlies conservative psychological\npredispositions is the worldview that society is a ``ruthlessly com-\npetitive jungle [ . . . ] as opposed to a place of cooperative har-\ninfluences individuals to subscribe to ``values or motivational\ngoals of power, dominance and superiority over others'' (Duckitt\npreferences for group-based dominance as indicated by political\nattitudes characterized by high social dominance orientation or\n``SDO'' (a general attitudinal orientation toward intergroup rela-\ntions reflecting preferences for equality or hierarchy between\ngroups). Finally, individuals high in SDO will subscribe to con-\nservative political positions and tend to vote for conservative par-\nThe second type of perception that underlies conservative\npsychological predispositions is the worldview belief that soci-\nety ``is an inherently dangerous, unpredictable, and threatening\nplace as opposed to being safe, stable and secure'' (Duckitt &\nuals hold values or motivational goals such as ``establishing\nand maintaining collective or social security, order, cohesion,\ncreate general preferences for obedience and respect toward\nauthorities expressed through authoritarian political attitudes\ncharacterized by high right-wing authoritarianism or ``RWA''\n(a general attitudinal orientation toward intragroup phenomena\nreflecting preferences for coercive social control, conforming\nto traditional moral norms, and the like.). Finally, individuals\nhigh in RWA, just as those high in SDO, subscribe to conser-\nvative political positions and tend to vote for conservative\nparties like the Republicans.

We will\nrefer to this as the intergroup dominance prediction. If instead\npreferences for lower pitched candidate voices are more pro-\nnounced among individuals who perceive society as dangerous\nand threatening--scoring high in RWA--then it will be an\nindication that lower pitched candidate voices are preferred for\ndefensive reasons of protection against threats to intragroup\ncohesion such as for instance nonsubmission and violations\nagainst norms and moral codes. We will refer to this as the\nintragroup protection prediction.\nOverview of Studies\nWe test these three predictions in three experimental studies\nwhere subjects choose between lower and higher pitched ver-\nsions of the same voices. In Studies 1 and 2, we exploit existing\ndata sources that have been used to establish the preference for\nlower pitched voices in the aggregate (Klofstad, 2013; Klof-\nstad, Anderson, & Nowicki, n.d.). To test the conservative\nRepublican prediction, we reanalyzed these data sources to\nassess whether there is variation in this preference across sub-\njects' party affiliation (Studies 1 and 2) and political ideology\n(only Study 2). Study 3 was designed to test the intergroup\ndominance prediction and the intragroup protection prediction,\nand in doing so explore which more distinct psychological\nconstruct drives the preferences for leaders with lower pitched\nvoices. More specifically, Study 3 measured subjects' SDO,\nRWA, and worldview beliefs of society as competitive jungle\nand dangerous. In Studies 1 and 2, party affiliation and ideo-\nlogical predispositions serve as proxies of these more specific\npsychological differences. Thus, we can expect the results in\nStudies 1 and 2 to be less clear than the results in Study 3\nsimply because they constitute more noisy measures of the\nrelevant psychological construct of interest.\nMaterial and Method\nFive men and five women were recorded speaking the sen-\ntence, ``I urge you to vote for me this November,'' a politically\nrelevant, partisan-neutral statement. The women ranged in age\nyears (x\n\u00af \u00bc 28 years). Voices were recorded as .wav files.\nThe recordings were manipulated to yield a higher and\nlower pitched version of each. Following previous studies on\nvoice pitch perception (Jones, Feinberg, DeBruine, Little, &\nVukovic, 2008), each recording was altered + .5 equivalent\nrectangular bandwidths (ERBs). The relationship between\nabsolute and perceived pitch in humans is logarithmic (Stevens,\n1998), and the manipulation by ERB accounts for this, as it\nproduces a constant perceivable gap between the manipulated\nsound files regardless of the baseline pitch of the original record-\nThe pitch of the unaltered female and male voices ranges\nHz), respectively.

The pitch of the\nhigher and lower pitched male sound files ranges from 110 to\n\u00af \u00bc 91 Hz), respectively.\nPrevious studies verified that voters can perceive which voice\nof each pair used in this experiment is higher in pitch (Ander-\nconstraints on the study questionnaire, only a subset of the\nstimuli used by Klofstad, Anderson, and Peters (2012) and\nAnderson and Klofstad (2012) were used. An extended descrip-\ntion of the voice pitch manipulation is available in Supplemen-\ntary Material S1.\nParticipants and Procedures\nApproval to conduct this study was granted by the Duke Uni-\nversity (Durham, NC) institutional review board on October 7,\nstudy, Qualtrics partnered with Sample Strategies to recruit a\ngeneral population sample of participants from across the\nUnited States. Participants ranged in age from 18 to 78 years\n(x\n\u00af \u00bc 49 years, SD \u00bc 13.7 years), and received a cash incentive\nafter participating (US$1.25). They were invited to participate\nin studies by e-mail and through messages on their Sample\nStrategies account home page.\nParticipants were randomly assigned to listen to either the\npairs of male (n \u00bc 201 male and 202 female voters) or female\nwhether to use computer speakers (n \u00bc 676) or headphones\n(n \u00bc 127). Existing research shows that online voice pitch\nstudies produce results that are comparable to laboratory stud-\nies (Jones et al., 2008; an extended description of the sample\nand procedures is available in Supplementary Material S1).\nMethod of Analysis\nThe participant is the unit of analysis. Each participant listened\nto five sets of male or female voices consisting of a lower\npitched and a higher pitched version of the same voice. For\neach of these voice pairs participants chose their preferred\nvoice. These vote choices were coded 1 if the participant\nselected the lower voice and 0 if the higher voice was selected.\nBased on the five choices we calculate an average score, which\nyields a summary preference ratio ranging from 0 to 1,\n4 Evolutionary Psychology\nreflecting minimal and maximum preference for lower pitched\nvoices, respectively.\nStudy 1 also included measures of subjects' feelings toward\nthe Democratic and the Republican parties, respectively, on\nand warmest feelings, respectively), and we use these measures\nto test the conservative Republican prediction. Based on these\nscales, we calculate subjects' relative feelings toward the two\nparties--Relative Affiliation--as the feeling difference toward\nthe Republican and Democratic parties, respectively. The Rela-\ntive Affiliation score is recoded to a 0\u00ad1 scale with 0 and 1\nrepresenting relatively warmest feelings toward the Democrats\nand Republicans, respectively (x\nFinally, existing research often compares groups of individuals\nwho affiliate strongly with the ideological left/Democratic\nparty or the ideological right/Republican party when investi-\ngating basic differences in preferences, behavior, and physio-\nlogical reactions (Oxley et al., 2008). Following this approach,\nwe also perform a quartile split of the Relative Affiliation score\nsuch that we can compare the quartile of subjects who hold the\nmost positive feelings toward Republican and least positive\nfeelings toward the Democrats to the quartile of subjects who\nhold the most positive toward the Democrats and the least\npositive feelings toward the Republicans.

We report\nresults from these analyses using the Relative Affiliation score\nand the comparison between Pure Republicans and Pure Dem-\nocrats, respectively. We also report results for preferences of\nmale and female candidate voices separately.\nResults\nAs shown in Klofstad, Anderson, and Nowicki (n.d.), a two-\ntailed one-sample t-test analysis of the proportion of votes cast\nfor lower voices (comparison value \u00bc .50) shows that male and\nfemale subjects preferred to vote for male and female candi-\ndates with lower pitched voices (p < .001). Additionally, an\nanalysis of variance (ANOVA) in the proportion of votes cast\nfor the lower pitched voices with participant sex, speaker sex,\nand the interaction of the two as the factors, shows that this\npreference was significantly stronger when subjects judged\nUsing first the Relative Affiliation score, our conservative\nRepublican prediction will be supported if there is a positive\nrelationship between the Relative Affiliation score and the pre-\nference for lower pitched voices.

The key test of our conservative Repub-\nlican prediction is whether Pure Republicans exhibit a stronger\npreference for lower pitched voices than Pure Democrats.

A similar difference is\nnot, however, found with respect to preferences for female\ncandidate voices (full models for all analyses are provided in\nSupplementary Material S2). Altogether, Study 1 provides ini-\ntial support for our prediction with respect to male candidate\nvoices. In Study 2 below, we explore whether this result repli-\ncates among subjects who registered as Democrats or Repub-\nlicans for the 2012 U.S. national elections.\nElection Study (CCES) Experiment\nMaterial and Method\nThe same treatments from Study 1 were used in this study.\nParticipants and Procedures\nwomen) in the 2012 CCES preelection survey (Ansolabehere,\nsample was matched by YouGov to a representative target\nsampling frame of U.S. citizens based on the following vari-\nables: sex, age, race, years of education, interest in politics,\nemployment status, Evangelical/born-again Christian status,\nmarital status, partisanship, and ideology (more details on the\nmatched sampling process for Study 2 [the 2012 CCES] is\navailable in Supplementary Material S1.A).\nDue to limited space on the questionnaire, study participants\nwere randomly assigned to listen to either the five pairs of male\nvoices (n \u00bc 198 male and 224 female subjects) or the five pairs\nof female voices (n \u00bc 195 male and 187 female subjects). Voters\nchose whether to use computer speakers (n \u00bc 717) or head-\nphones (n \u00bc 87). After listening to each pair of voices, voters\nLaustsen et al. 5\nwere asked which candidate they would vote for.

Vote choices were\ncoded 1 if the voter selected the lower voice and 0 if the higher\nvoice was selected. Following the procedure described in Study 1,\nwe calculated the average for these choices, which yields a sum-\nmary preference ratio ranging from 0 to 1, reflecting minimal and\nmaximal preference for lower pitchedvoices,respectively.

Panel B in Figure 4 illustrates the effects of beliefs about\nsociety as a competitive jungle and as a dangerous place,\nrespectively, on preferences for male and female candidate\nvoices (full models for all analyses presented from Study 3 are\nprovided in Supplementary Material S5).\nIn sum, Figure 4 provides support for the intergroup dom-\ninance prediction and not the intragroup protection prediction.\nFrom Panel A, it is clear that subjects' preferences for lower\npitched male candidate voices are driven by SDO and beliefs\nabout the social world as a competitive jungle rather than by\nRWA and perceptions of the social world as dangerous and\nthreatening. This finding gives us a greater understanding of\nthe finding across Studies 1, 2, and 3 that Republicans/conser-\nvatives more than Democrats/liberals prefer lower pitched\nmale candidate voices. When it comes to female candidate\nvoices, Panel B shows that only perceptions of society as a\ncompetitive jungle is a significant but negative predictor of\npreferences for lower pitched female voices. This runs counter\nto the general pattern of no differences between liberals and\nconservatives and Democrats and Republicans on preferences\nfor female candidate voices across Studies 1, 2, and 3.9\n8 Evolutionary Psychology\nDiscussion\nPast research suggests that people have a general preference for\nleaders with low-pitched (i.e. dominant) voices (Anderson &\nalternative physical cues of dominance in would-be leaders\n(in particular facial masculinity), however, has demonstrated\nthat preferences for dominance vary across contexts and\nEffects of SDO and RWA on pref. for lower-pitched voices\nPanel A\nDangerous\nworld view\nComp. jungle\nworld view\nComp. jungle\nworld view\nDangerous\nworld view\nMale Candidate Voices Female Candidate Voices\nMale Candidate Voices Female Candidate Voices\nEffects of world views on pref. for lower-pitched voices\nPanel B\nFigure 4.

All models control for type of playback device (headphones vs. computer speakers). P-values are from\ntwo-tailed tests of significance.\nLaustsen et al. 9\nindividuals. In particular, preferences for masculine and\ndominant-looking leader candidates have been found to be\nhigher among individuals' with a conservative worldview\nIn this article, we have integrated these findings in variation\nin preferences for dominant leaders into the literatures on voice\npitch and voting behavior. Adaptationist accounts predict that\ndifferent cues to the same behavior within a certain domain\nwould trigger the corresponding psychological system in sim-\nilar ways (Feinberg, 2008). Just as facial cues related to dom-\ninance in would-be leaders have been demonstrated to be\nconditionally preferred in order to promote the most competent\nleader relative to the problems confronting the group (Laustsen\n2012b), we predicted that vocal cues related to dominance are\nconditionally preferred in a similar way. Rather than a general\npreference for deep, dominant voices, we argued that this pre-\nference should be strongest among Republican and conserva-\ntive individuals who, more than Democratic and liberal\nindividuals, view the social world as more competitive and\ndangerous. Moreover, we investigated if the preference for\nlower pitched voices is more closely connected to perceptions\nof society as competitive or dangerous, as these fundamental\nworldviews are linked to conservatism and right-wing ideolo-\ngies through distinct and separate causal paths (Duckitt & Sib-\nConsistent with the overall prediction--that lower pitched\ncandidate voices would be preferred more among right-wing\nthan among left-wing individuals--the results across Studies 1,\n2, and 3 show that individuals affiliated with the Republican\nparty tend to prefer lower pitched male candidate voices more\nthan individuals affiliated with the Democratic party. This pre-\nference for lower pitched male candidate voices was also found\nto increase with ideological conservatism. Finally, Study 3\nshow that preferences for deep male candidate voices are dri-\nven by differences in preferences for group-based dominance\nas measured by SDO and perceptions of the social world as a\ncompetitive jungle rather than by subscription to authoritarian\nvalues and worldview beliefs of society as dangerous and threa-\ntening. Importantly, these findings only relate to preferences\nfor male and not to preferences for female candidate voices.\nBelow, we speculate about the potential reasons for this sex\ndifference.\nThese results add significantly to prior studies of prefer-\nences for lower pitched candidate voices. Prior research has\nestablished preferences for lower pitched voices in the aggre-\ngate. However, it has remained unclear what specifically is\ncausing preferences for candidate voices. In this article, we\nprovide some initial answers to this question in two ways. First,\nwe build on the growing line of research, suggesting that\nhumans possess a psychological system of followership--a\ncompilation of mechanisms regulating choices of leaders in\ncorrespondence to perceptions of problems facing one's\ngroup--and argue that this followership psychology should\ntake in vocal cues to problem-specific leadership competences\njust as it is shown to take in and respond to visual cues of\nleadership competence (Laustsen & Petersen 2015; Spisak,\nfinding that conservative individuals prefer leaders and candi-\ndates who look masculine and dominant (Laustsen & Petersen,\n2015), we should expect that conservative individuals will also\nprefer candidates that sound masculine and dominant. Across\nthe three studies this is exactly what we find.\nSecond, Study 3 expands existing knowledge about the\ncauses of the preference for lower pitched candidate voices.\nBased on the ``Dual-Process Motivational Model'' for political\nideology (see Duckitt & Sibley, 2010), we find that Republicans'\nand conservatives' preferences for lower pitched male voices are\ndriven by deep-seated psychological differences in preferences\nfor group-based dominance as captured by SDO and perceptions\nof the social world as a competitive jungle. This suggests that\npreferences for lower pitched candidate voices reflect prefer-\nences for a leader capable of ensuring that the group increases\nits position in the hierarchy vis-a\n`-vis other groups rather than a\nleader capable of ensuring the stability of the hierarchy within\nthe group. Based on this, preferences for lower pitched\ncandidate voices could be at least partially taken to reflect that\nvoters are voting for aggressive and conflict-oriented leadership\nwhen they are attracted to and select deeper male voices.\nAs noted throughout the result section party affiliation,\nideology, SDO, and competitive jungle worldview only con-\nsistently predict preferences for male and not female candidate\nvoices. Given that prior research has established that lower\npitched voices are preferred in the aggregate for both male and\nfemale candidates, this difference related to candidate sex is\npuzzling. We suspect that one reason individual differences in\nthe preference for leaders with lower voices are only related to\nthe perception of male voices is that lower pitched voices in\ngeneral are associated with a range of different attributes.\nTherefore, it is possible that lower pitched male and female\ncandidate voices are preferred for different reasons and are\nperceived as signals of qualitatively different leadership traits\nfor males and females. Previously lower pitched voices have\nbeen linked to traits such as dominance, attractiveness, and\nability to provide leadership but also to trustworthiness, hon-\nesty, and intelligence (Tigue et al., 2012). Furthermore, strong\nevidence exists for a relationship between testosterone and\ndeeper voices and dominant behavior for males in particular\nenard, Lacroix, Kreutzer, & Lebou-\nCa\n\u00b4rdenas, 2012). This suggests that lower pitched voices are\nutilized as a cue for dominant, aggressive behavior, and lead-\nership in males more than in females. Accordingly, future\nresearch should look into the particular trait inferences that\ndrive preferences for low-pitched voices in female leaders.\nWe conclude by noting how these results also speak to more\ngeneral debates on the rationality of the public in times of\nelections. Research shows how factors such as polling location,\nthe success of local sports teams, and national disasters like\nhurricanes and shark attacks can significantly affect the public\n10 Evolutionary Psychology\nmood and voting behavior (Achen & Bartels, 2004; Healy,\npicture of an irrational public. From a standard social science\nperspective, it is easy to interpret the effects of political candi-\ndates' physiological features (such as faces and voice pitches)\nin a similar way. Yet, according to the present research, such\ninferences might be ill founded. Voters are seemingly not moti-\nvated by ignorance and irrationality when they let the voice\npitch of candidates guide their vote choices. Rather, voters use\nvoice pitch cues to match their candidate preferences and their\nperceptions of the social world in adaptive ways. Essentially,\nthe use of voice pitch cues reflects a motivation to align oneself\nwith the better leader.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to\nthe research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nNotes\n1.

Subsequently, this variable is split in\nquartiles to discriminate between Pure Republicans who are\ncharacterized by very high scores on this variable (as they exhibit\na strong like for the Republican party and simultaneously a strong\ndislike for the Democratic party) and Pure Democrats who are\ncharacterized by very low scores on the variable (as they exhibit\na strong dislike for the Republican party and simultaneously a\nstrong like for the Democratic party).\n2.

In accordance with the national sci-\nentific guidelines, formal ethical approval for the present research\nwas not obtained (see http://www.cvk.sum.dk/cvk/home/english.\naspx).\n6. Following the procedure in Studies 1 and 2, we also control for the\ntype of playback device in Study 3. However, while no difference\nbetween subjects using headphones or computer speakers was\nfound in the first two studies, a difference exists in Study 3 such\nthat relationships are generally stronger among subjects using\nheadphones. We can only speculate about the reasons for this dif-\nference, but potentially it is caused by MTurk subjects taking sur-\nveys in more noisy environments than subjects in Studies 1 and 2.\nHowever, to avoid any unintended confounds with respect to our\nanalyses, these are based on all subjects (headphone users and\ncomputer speaker users).\n7. Using subjects' Relative Affiliation (difference in feeling thermo-\nmeter rating toward the Republican and the Democratic parties) to\npredict preferences for lower pitched male voices, a similar (and\nsuch trend is present with respect to preferences for female voices\n8. A similar trend approaching statistical significance is found with\nrespect to preferences for lower pitched male voices when the\n7-point extremely liberal (0) to extremely conservative (1) scale\nfound regarding preferences for lower pitched female voices (b \u00bc\nbeing negatively related to preferences for lower pitched female\ncandidate voices.\n9.

However, controlling for subjects' age and sex\ndoes not change the results reported in the main text here (see\nSupplementary Material S6 for regression coefficients from models\ncontrolling for subject age and sex across all three studies). Second,\nwith respect to subject sex, one might further imagine that female\nsubjects' inferences of mate value from male voices drive the\nthe case. Instead, across all three studies we find no evidence that\nRepublicans' greater preference for lower pitched male candidate\nvoices is driven female subjects' potentially greater preference for\nlower pitched male voices. Instead, irrespective of their sex, sub-\njects who affiliate with the Republican party hold conservative\nideological positions, socially dominant predispositions, and\nbeliefs of the social world as a competitive jungle have stronger\npreferences for lower pitched male candidate voices (see Supple-\nmentary Material S7 for results of corresponding analyses).\nSupplemental Material\nThe online data supplements are available at http://evp.sagepub.com/\nsupplemental\nReferences\nAchen, C.
