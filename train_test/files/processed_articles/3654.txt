Repositioning\nService Learning from optional projects to required projects\nis dependent on a shift in thought about Service Learning, in\nwhich there is recognition of Service Learning as a means of\nproviding that preparation. Acceleration of the societal shift\ncould occur via Invitational Rhetoric and revisioning the\nidea of \"service\" in society.\nService Learning programs are implemented at all aca-\ndemic levels, from elementary schools to higher education,\nand yet Service Learning is not a part of the common core\ncurriculum in the national educational system. Service\nLearning remains peripheral when compared with basics\nsuch as mathematics, English, history, and science, and yet\neducating students on the fundamentals of citizenship and\nsocietal functions is a necessary part of social development.\nTo \"mainstream\" Service Learning, this research proposes\ntwo initiatives: (a) Foster the idea of the Service Learning\nexperience as citizenship/community building by associating\nthe experience with embedded cultural values and (b) apply\nInvitational Rhetoric in persuading students and parents to\nview Service Learning as something other than imposed ser-\nvitude or social consciousness for a grade.\nLiterature Review\nResearch reveals measured positive outcomes in Service\nLearning models in the education framework. Eyler (2002)\nexamined the role of reflection in effective programs and\nargued that Service Learning models should be supported\nwithin institutions and through national policy. Hunter and\nBrisbin, Jr. (2000) discovered that students who have a\nService Learning experience will view the experience posi-\ntively and will be inclined to seek other service opportunities.\nJones and Abes (2004) found that outcomes of a Service\nLearning course extended beyond completion of the course,\nproviding a context for reflection on individual identity, rela-\ntionships to others, and an internally defined sense of self.\nMelchior and Bailis (2002) analyzed three national Service\nLearning initiatives for conclusions about such programs'\nimpact on students' civic engagement: (a) Serve America, (b)\nLearn and Serve, and (c) Active Citizenship Today.

Hicks-Goldston1\n Keywords\nService Learning, instruction and curriculum, rhetoric, community engagement\n2 SAGE Open\ntheir research, the authors found that Service Learning can\nprovide young people with meaningful experiences as active\nand effective citizens and assist them in acquiring necessary\nskills for identifying issues in their community and acting on\nthem. Moely, McFarland, Miron, Mercer, and Ilustre (2002)\nhad similar results, with students demonstrating expected\nchanges in civic attitudes, while rating their own skills for\nengagement and expressing plans to be involved in civic\nactivities in the future. Morgan and Streb (2001) found that\nstudents' immersion in Service Learning exercises in which\nthey had a voice increased their level of satisfaction with\nService Learning, as well as their self-concept, political\nengagement, and attitudes toward out-groups. Saltmarsh\n(2005) argued that civic learning is an integral part of the\nService Learning experience, resulting in \"civic professional-\nism.\" He asserted that \"civic learning draws attention to the\ncivic dimensions of education, emphasizing the need not only\nfor development of the disciplinary mastery and competence,\nbut also for civic awareness and purpose,\" in his assessment\n(Saltmarsh, 2005, p. 2). Sedlak, Doheny, Panthofer, and\nAnaya (2003) found that all beginning students developed\ncritical-thinking skills in Service Learning experiences, and\nthat Service Learning experiences benefit students, faculty,\nagencies, and educational programs. Strange (2004) con-\ncluded that Service Learning provides students with a firm\nfoundation for academic majors and overall academic perfor-\nmance.\nDefiningTerms: Service Learning,\nHistorical Context, and the Concept\nof Citizenship\nButin (2010) addressed a common theme in any Service\nLearning discussion--a varying concept of what it actually\nmeans. The author notes that for many scholars/educators,\ndefining Service Learning rejects the educational model of\ntransferring knowledge \"downward,\" from knowledge-\nable teachers to passive students in 50-min increments.\nCommunication scholars would see the obvious similarity to\nthe \"Single Bullet Theory\" of mass communication, in which\na single message is transmitted simultaneously to a passive\nmass audience, who receives the message and instantly shares\na reaction. Whereas a \"downward\" education model would\nhave a teacher at the front of the classroom \"transmitting\" a\nlearning initiative to a room of students simultaneously\n\"receiving/processing\" information, Service Learning pro-\nvides an experiential factor of activity on the part of the\nstudents, in which their participation in the learning event\nprovides context and introduces critical-thinking and problem-\nsolving skills. Butin offers that Service Learning is \"a\npedagogical practice and theoretical orientation that pro-\nvokes us to more carefully examine, rethink, and reenact\nthe visions, policies, and practices of our classrooms, and\neducational institutions\" (p. 19), as well as reassess teaching\nmethods and scholarship.\nIncorporating Service Learning into the national core cur-\nriculum would involve shifting societal thought, and societal\nshifts in thought occur within historical context. At present\nand historically, the United States continues to feel the effects\nof the economic recession that began in 2007. Finances of\nstate governments are closely tied to prevailing economic\nconditions. The economic recession that began in the fourth\ncreated great fiscal stress for all levels of government and\nproduced a strong climate for reexamining the roles played\nby every level--federal, state, and local. State governments\nplay several roles in this intergovernmental fiscal system,\nincluding creator and financier of some local government ser-\nvices; conduit for, and redistributor of, federal funds; and pro-\nviding direct public services such as health and hospitals,\npublic safety, and highways. State government general expen-\nthe 1.2% decline in general revenues. By contrast, from 2007\nexpenditure was in the form of grants and aid to local govern-\nments (including independent school district governments),\nthereby underlining the states' role as a financial resource for\ntheir subordinate governments (http://www2.census.gov).\nThe nationwide state budget crisis creates a need for pro-\nactive citizens who can shape their communities rather than\nappeal to overburdened state offices and services. Ideally, a\nnational educational core Service Learning program would\nintroduce the idea of \"empowered citizenry\" from the ele-\nmentary education level and continue to promote such atti-\ntudes throughout the program, while allowing students to\nbecome educated in community-building skills. For students\nin upper-level and higher education, the emphasis would\nshift to necessary job skills and enhanced personal develop-\nment, while continuing their educational social-collaborative\nexperiences.\nVarlotta (2001) offered that when college-age students\nwere asked to define \"citizenship,\" many students were\nguided by a political philosophy called \"liberalism,\" a phi-\nlosophy that theorizes the primacy of the individual citizen\n(the author termed it the \"ME\") over the democratic com-\nmunity (the author termed it the \"WE\"); for liberals, \"citi-\nzen\" refers to the rational, autonomous, equal members of\nthe state who enjoy the freedoms associated with democracy.\nThe author then bases such thoughts in the historical docu-\nments of the Constitution of the United States of America,\nthe Declaration of Independence, and the Federalist Papers,\nand the contained tenets of those documents of rationality--\nthe capacity for reasoned mental activity; equality--a poten-\ntial capacity for equality rather than an actual state of being;\nautonomy--with an individual's identity (as a citizen or\nHicks-Goldston 3\notherwise) as autonomous, existing independently of social\ncontext; and freedom--defined as \"freedom from the state,\"\na type of laissez-faire institution with minimal constraints;\nand \"freedom to\" rule themselves as equal members of the\ndemocratic state. In such consciousness, the \"ME\" takes pri-\nority over the \"WE.\"\nVarlotta (2001) noted that, in contrast, the Communitarian\nCommunity denotes a consensual community grounded in\nand bound by a \"common good.\" Varlotta's research argues\nfor an overlapping of the \"ME\" and the \"WE\" as individual\ncitizens negotiate their roles within a collective culture with\nshared concerns. That complex yet meaningful scenario\nshould be included in an effective Service Learning\u00adbased\neducation--an awareness of the self as an active, participat-\ning member of a society/community who retains individual-\nity while still recognizing the need to work for a better\ncommunity experience.\nValue Analysis and\nInvitational Rhetoric\nSillars and Gronbeck (2001) stated that \"touchstone\"\nAmerican value systems include the Puritan-Pioneer Value\nSystem, which is rooted in the idea that persons have an obli-\ngation to themselves and their community to work hard at\nwhatever they do; the Personal Success Value System, which\ninvolves a highly pragmatic concern for the material happi-\nness of the individual; and the Collectivist Value System, in\nwhich the community becomes the vehicle for personal\nrelease and empowerment, such as the Civil Rights move-\nment or the Feminist movement (Sillars & Gronbeck, 2001).\nAlthough those values are evident in some Service Learning\nactivities, repeatedly linking Service Learning to cultural\nvalues would make integration of Service Learning into the\neducational core more apparent.\nFirst, this proposal argues for attaching the Puritan-Pioneer\nValue System to Service Learning projects at the elementary\neducational level, and using positive-value words such as\nactivity, community, dedication, duty, family, responsibility,\nand virtue when discussing the projects, with the goal of\nestablishing strong self-identity while instilling a work ethic\nattached to the community. This addresses the ME/WE\ndichotomy early in a child/student's life and allows for that\nstudent to remain self-aware while learning about his or her\nsociety's history, government, and various societal functions\nin the life of individuals or individual families. Service\nLearning projects at this level would need to be based on the\ndevelopmental capabilities of the children and academic\nresources of the school and surrounding community. For\nexample, children in middle childhood might show more\nindependence from parents and family, start to think about the\nfuture, understand more about their place in the world, pay\nmore attention to friendships and teamwork, and want to be\nliked and accepted by friends (http://www.cdc.gov). In those\nearly grades, it would be important to make Service Learning\nprojects adaptable to the child's development, such as the les-\nson offered in Project Citizen's \"What Is Authority?,\" in\nwhich the child analyzes the role of government and learns\nthe concept of authority (http://www.civiced.org). The idea of\n\"lawful citizenry\" respecting the community laws, such as\n\"No Littering,\" could be reinforced by a clean-up day in\nwhich the students clean up the litter on the playground.\nBy the time the child is in the fifth grade, things have\nchanged. Children in this age group might start to form\nstronger, more complex friendships and peer relationships. It\nbecomes more emotionally important to have friends, espe-\ncially of the same sex. They face more academic challenges\nat school, become more independent from the family, begin\nto see the point of view of others more clearly, and have an\nincreased attention span (http://www.cdc.gov).\nFor those children, the \"Learning to Give\" website offers\na lesson titled, \"We the Kids--The Three Branches and Me,\"\nin which students learn concepts such as how to work in\ncooperative groups, name and define the three branches of\ngovernment, list the three characteristics of the trial and\nappellate courts, and create an editorial cartoon, among other\nthings. They may present the \"Bill of Rights\" through a song\nwith creative movement to a retirement community or\nanother classroom in the school. The lesson also encourages\nstudents to create posters that instruct about the core demo-\ncratic values. Students are encouraged to display posters\naround the school to share their knowledge and creativity\nwith other students and visitors to the school (http://www.\nlearningtogive.org).\nSecond, this proposal argues for attaching the Collectivist\nValue System to Service Learning projects at the secondary\nlevel, and using words such as brotherhood/sisterhood, coop-\neration, equality, humanism, social good, and unity when dis-\ncussing the projects, with the goal of establishing awareness\nof shared community concerns and the need for working\ntogether. Students at the secondary education level could be\nexpected to have a more developed self-identity at this point\nin their academic career, and the communitarian approach\nwould still address the ME/WE dichotomy, but students\nwould experience an emphasis on community contribution\nfor a common good. Service Learning projects at this level\nwould become more complex, allowing for students to use\ncritical-thinking and problem-solving skills when analyzing\nissues in their communities. Once again, Learning to Give\naddresses the level of awareness in the middle school student\nwith a lesson titled, \"Power to Make a Difference: Intro to\nPhilanthropy Unit.\" The students learn to define \"philan-\nthropy\"; develop awareness of the individual philanthropists\nand the causes they support; use philanthropy vocabulary\nwords, such as civic responsibility, common good, founda-\ntion, and nonprofit sector; research a philanthropic organiza-\ntion and its mission; create a persuasive radio advertisement\nfor a nonprofit organization; and choose an organization to\n4 SAGE Open\npersonally support with a donation of time or treasure and\njustify the choice (http://www.learningtogive.org).\nFinally, this proposal argues for attaching the Personal\nSuccess Value System to Service Learning projects at the\nhigher education level, and using words such career, dignity,\nsecurity, identity, personal recognition, and respect when dis-\ncussing the projects, with the goal of assisting the individual\nwith career pursuits, while training the individual to assist in\ncommunity building as well. At this level, whether the stu-\ndent is pursuing the final year for a high school diploma,\n4-year degree, or a certification program, the emphasis would\nbe on developing skills and expertise that not only would ben-\nefit the student in a career but might also be used on a com-\nmunal level, even on a part-time or volunteer basis. At this\npoint, students would be expected to demonstrate a semipro-\nfessional awareness of behavior and practice that could ben-\nefit their communities. Projects would be at the most advanced\nlevel of sophistication and would directly address community\nconcerns.\nHigh school and college-age students are able to use their\nlevels of awareness about the community and combine that\nawareness with communication skills to be peer mentors,\nvolunteers, and active youth. Service Learning models at this\nlevel range from using Service Learning in public speaking\nclasses for persuasive speeches to using Service Learning as\npart of studies on aging. Individual classes and disciplines\nuse a variety of projects at high schools, community col-\nleges, and universities.\nThe desired result of the repositioned educational model\nwould be one in which Service Learning is present at every\neducational level, and projects reflect/reinforce embedded\ncultural codes. As previously stated, Service Learning is\nexperiential, and including that kind of learning in the educa-\ntional core would allow students to view their communities\nfrom the inside out, experiencing varying roles and responsi-\nbilities in which they trace community issues from symptom\nto cause. This fosters the opportunity for creativity and criti-\ncal thinking in which a situation is introduced, and students\nare asked to analyze that situation and propose a solution--\nminus judgment.\nA key component for repositioning Service Learning is\nrevisioning the idea of \"service\" as it relates to the academic\nexperience. Invitational Rhetoric allows educators to pres-\nent Service Learning as an opportunity for developing citi-\nzenship and personal awareness while acquiring necessary\nlife skills. Invitational Rhetoric produces a consensus of\nunderstanding, because the rhetor is inviting the audience to\naccept the invitation to listen to a particular perspective, and\nthereby receive the opportunity to better understand it. In\npresenting a particular perspective, the invitational rhetor\ndoes not judge or denigrate others' perspectives but is open\nto and tries to appreciate and validate those perspectives,\neven if they differ dramatically from the rhetor's own (Foss\nThe key factor of Invitational Rhetoric is in the approach.\nThe stance taken by invitational rhetors toward their audiences\nis obviously different from that assumed by traditional rhetors.\nInvitational rhetors do not believe they have the right to claim\nthat their experiences or perspectives are superior to those of\ntheir audience members and refuse to impose their perspectives\nAs noted by Lozano-Reich and Cloud (2009), Invitational\nRhetoric has had significant influence on feminist scholar-\nship. Feminist rhetorical scholars present the format as one\nin which civil discourse is possible when discussing redefin-\ning social roles. There is no distinct movement or social shift\nrooted entirely in Invitational Rhetorical origins; the style is\ngenerally regarded as one in which the emphasis is based in\ncivility and ethical discourse. That would be a leading factor\nin using the format for adopting Service Learning into the\nnational core curriculum, because there is no blame attached\nto the current model--only an opportunity to create a new\ncomponent in the national curriculum. Another factor influ-\nencing the choice of the Invitational Rhetorical format is the\nneed for equality in the argument, without presupposing\n\"superiority\" of service behavior. In introducing Service\nLearning as part of an educational process, the presentation\nmust be one of shared opportunities for all involved--\nlearner, educator, community--and not a need to be morally\nsuperior by learning information and skills to serve the com-\nmunity. Everyone must be equally committed to the project,\nand enjoy benefits.\nNovak and Bonine (2009) introduced the concept of\nInvitational Rhetoric as a form of persuasion in a public\nspeaking course and found that using the format in persuasive\nspeeches made students more comfortable than the traditional\nformat of coercion. The students were less threatened by an\nInvitational Rhetoric approach because the goal was not\nabout convincing the listener of a \"right\" or \"wrong\" way of\nthinking--the goal of the speech was establishing under-\n\"Service\" is a loaded word, with a multitude of associa-\ntions, from \"service to one's country\" referring to military\npersonnel, to careers in the \"service industry\" referring to\njobs ranging from waiting tables (\"servers\") to hotel manage-\nment, and \"customer service\" referring to answering custom-\ners' complaints or frequently asked questions. \"Community\nService\" refers to anything from school-sponsored activities,\nto neighborhood projects, to judicial sentences imposed on an\nindividual for minor legal infractions. With such varying con-\ncepts of service, the additional varying concepts of Service\nLearning make the idea of required Service Learning experi-\nences even more problematic.\nInvitational Rhetoric would present Service Learning\naccording to the previously discussed values, with both\n\"Service\" and \"Learning\" attached to positive, supported\ncultural values. It would lack judgment--no student would\nbe lauded as \"good\" or \"better\" than others because of the\nparticipation, nor would the student be \"sentenced\" to serv-\ning the community for a grade. By attaching an invitation to\ncontinue a tradition of core values of the dedicated individ-\nual who works for the social good of his or her community\nHicks-Goldston 5\nwhile maintaining dignity and earning respect from his or her\npeers on the way to his or her career, the rhetor provides a\npositive association for the student educated in a Service\nLearning curriculum.\nService Learning projects would balance the ME/WE\ndichotomy by allowing students to see what their efforts pro-\nduced and gain a sense of accomplishment in completed\nprojects, while hopefully transforming their perspectives\nabout issues in their community.\nConclusion\nService Learning has proven to be successful in changing\nstudents'attitudes about their place in society, even as it exists\nas peripheral learning. If Service Learning were a part of the\ncommon educational core, the potential for repositioning its\nvalue to citizenry would be highly expanded. With local, state,\nand federal budgets being tightened, it is up to citizens to\nbecome community builders and shapers. However, many\ncommunities lack access to education and training for the\ncitizenry, and Service Learning could supply that link to\nempowerment. A variety of factors must be considered in\nimplementing a national educational Service Learning core,\nfrom cost of training educators in Service Learning to feasibil-\nity of more advanced projects, but the idea remains possible\nwith an organized framework. Although there might be initial\ncosts and training involved, the long-term benefits of a\nService Learning curriculum gain credibility as more state and\nlocal programs are lost to budget cuts. The vision of autono-\nmous citizens giving back to their communities seems less\nidealistic and more necessary than ever.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nButin, D.
