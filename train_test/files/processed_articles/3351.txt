    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe aim of the study was to investigate the influence of gender stereotype as a predictor of secondary school students' self-\nconcept and academic achievement. The study was guided by four purposes, four research questions, and four hypotheses.\nThe study adopted ex post facto design. The research sample was drawn from eight government/public senior secondary\nschools in Udi education zone. Nine schools were randomly selected from the 227 schools. A total of 342 senior secondary\nII school (SSII) students made up the sample of the study. A 20-item students' stereotype self-concept questionnaire (SSSCQ)\nwas adapted from Marsh's Self Descriptive Questionnaire II (SDQII), and a 10-item students' mathematics achievement\ntest (SMAT) was developed by the researchers after reviewing related literature. This was done with the help of experts\nin the areas. The instruments were face and content validated and used for the collection of data. In analyzing the data,\nmean and standard deviation were used in answering the research questions while a t test was used in testing the four\nhypotheses. The findings of the study indicate that gender stereotype has significant influence on students' self-concept and\nacademic achievement in favor of the male students. On the other hand, school location has significant influence on academic\nachievement of students but has no significant influence on students' self-concept.\n",

Gender has to do\nwith behaviors that have become associated with masculinity\nand feminity, and with how people see their roles as male or\nfemale (Kauffman, 1997). Therefore, gender is related with\nhow individuals perceive themselves in such a way that most\npeople of the same sex identify themselves with certain attri-\nbutes. These attributes affect children as they develop.\nWithout doubt, the environment a child finds himself or her-\nself in has a lot of impact on the child. According to Berk\n(2010), girls and boys are treated differently at birth. Girls\nare dressed with pink, and parents tend to be gentle with the\ngirl child. On the other hand, boys are dressed with blue\nmaterials, while parents are harder with them. In the process\nof treating children differently, girls are offered more sex-\nstereotyped toys, and without doubt, these children grow up\nlooking and acting differently. This is in line with Kauchak\nand Eggen (2011) who stated that male children are regarded\nas handsome and seen as tougher and harder, and parents are\nrougher with their sons and involve them in more physical\nstimulation than their female children. It was along this\ndirection that the American Association of University\nWomen (AAUW; 2006) argued that the differential treatment\ngiven to boys and girls by teachers and the society danger-\nously hampered the educational progress, self-esteem, and\ncareer choices of girls. If this is so, there are the indications\nthat self-concept and academic achievement of male and\nfemale children could be affected by stereotyping.According\nreflect cognitive developmental changes and have impact on\nthe way children understand the meaning of categories, attri-\nbutes, and changes in role-taking skills. Therefore, stereo-\ntypes testify individuals' orientation and past experiences,\nwhich could manifest positively or negatively as individuals\ninteract with others within and outside their immediate\nenvironment.\nIt is believed that stereotypic views might affect individu-\nals' self-cognitive development, as well as their feelings,\nactions, and attitudes. According to Allen (2000), stereotype\n1University of Nigeria, Nsukka, Nigeria\nCorresponding Author:\nJ. N.

N. Igbo1, V. C. Onu1, and N. O. Obiyo1\n Keywords\nself-concept, gender, gender stereotype, academic achievement\n2 SAGE Open\nis associated with the development of beliefs concerning the\ntraits supposedly possessed by most members of a society. It\nis an exaggerated belief that members of a group have certain\ntraits that are peculiar to them. This implies that the impact\nof stereotype tends to change the individual's perception of\nreality over a period of time. Stereotypes are widely held\nbeliefs about the character and behavior of all members of a\ngroup. Stereotyping is the perception, clarification, and\nassessment of social objects (events) on the basis of specific\nnotion (Ramalingam, 2006). A stereotype is a rigid, simplis-\ntic caricature of a particular group of people, which in one\nway or the other can affect individuals by limiting them on\ntheir academic achievement (Kauchak & Eggen, 2011).\nFrom this evidence, it is possible that stereotype might limit\nchildren from pursuing their career choices. Stereotype\nbecomes a problem when forces in schools and the society\nlimit the academic potential of either male or female.\ngender stereotypic views create negative influence on chil-\ndren in their choice of career decision, and females are less\nlikely to study engineering and computer sciences than\nmales. Therefore, there are some indications that gender ste-\nreotype can influence individuals' academic perceptions and\nachievement.\nRyan andAdams (1999) developed a general model called\nthe \"family school relationship\" (FSR). They proposed that\nthose features of the child or family that have the most imme-\ndiate connection to school success will have the greatest\ninfluence on school outcomes. The researchers used the FSR\nmodel to show how family relationships affected the school\nsuccess of more than 4,300 boys and girls between the ages\nof 6 and 11. The model showed that socio-economic back-\nground and stereotyping play a powerful role in the lives of\nchildren and had affected many variables in the model.\nAccording to the researchers, higher levels of students' ste-\nreotyping lead directly to more positive or negative attitudes\ntoward school in children. Positive attitudes lead to higher\nacademic achievement, while negative attitudes lead to lower\nacademic achievement. Therefore, stereotyping is a very\nimportant determinant of a wide range of social and psycho-\nlogical functioning of students.\ntypes are learned early in childhood through normal social-\nization instead of direct learning or experience. For Aboud\ndevelopmental changes of students and, in effect, affects the\nway they understand the meaning of construct, attributes,\nand change in role-taking. The implication is that, in the pro-\ncess of these changes, the students' self-concept might be\naffected. For G. N. Martin, Carlson, and Buskist (2007), ste-\nreotype serves to justify a student's experiences and anticipa-\ntions, and is a relatively positive or negative evaluation of\noneself. This means that a stereotype that categorized a par-\nticular group as ineffective, and dull, tends to manipulate that\ngroup by implication. G. N. Martin et al. (2007) stated that\nonce individuals are categorized as members of a particular\ngroup, the stereotype of that group influences the impression\nof these individuals involved. For example, if parents and\nteachers believe that females are not good in the sciences, the\ntendency for the female students is to lose interest in sciences\nto conform to that schema. Bargh (1989) is of the opinion\nthat stereotypes are relatively automatically activated in par-\nticular contexts based on the perception of people around.\nhas two repercussions: the anxiety about conforming to the\nstereotype (i.e., acting to fulfill the stereotype) and disengag-\ning oneself from the stereotype. If this is so, definitely, the\nindividual self-concept will be affected either negatively or\npositively depending on the situation the person finds him-\nself or herself in. Psychologically, stereotyping affects both\nmales and females and makes them vulnerable toward that\ndirection. For Schmade (2002), the degree to which individ-\nuals identify with relevant or irrelevant groups affects how\nstrongly the stereotype influences their performance and\nachievement.\nSelf-concept is seen as the way individuals regularly\ndescribe themselves in relation to their physical, social, emo-\ntional, and psychological feelings. For G. N. Martin et al.\n(2007), self-concept has to do with the individual's feelings,\nknowledge of self, and ideas about self. This means that self-\nconcept is the totality of an individual and all that is peculiar\nwith the person. At the center of self-concept is one's self-\nschema, which is a mental framework, a cognitive structure\nthat organizes individuals' emotions, knowledge, and ideas.\nSocial psychologists such as Markus and Nurius (1986), and\nHiggins (1987) believe that self-concept has to do with indi-\nviduals' possible selves. Therefore, one's self-concept plays\na lot of roles in the development of the person academically,\nsocially, and psychologically. Bem (1981) believes that\nsocial impact on behaviors can affect the individual's self-\nconcept because individuals always learn about themselves\nby observing how they behave. When students are stereo-\ntyped and work along the same view, it tends to affect them\nfrom different dimensions. Rogers (1980) believes that the\ncore of one's personality is the self-concept of that individ-\nual. G. L. Martin and Osborne (1992) stated that individual\nself-concept is the collection of beliefs, thoughts, and feel-\nings that individuals have about themselves. It is the indi-\nvidual's self-image that is the way the person sees himself or\nherself. Self-concept is seen as a general term that refers to\nthe wide range of one's self-descriptions made by individu-\nals. Most of the individuals' self-descriptions have been\nassociated with rewards that are likely to elicit very positive\nimages and emotions. This implies that how individuals per-\nceive themselves in terms of the stereotypes eventually\naffects the totality of their behavior. This is what the present\nstudy has set out to address.\nAccording to Demidenko, Tasca, Kennedy, and Bissada\n(2010), self-concept contains three parts: self-esteem, stability,\nand self-efficacy. Self-esteem is the evaluative component,\nIgbo et al. 3\nwhere one makes judgment about his or her self-worth. In\ntheir views, stability refers to the organization and continuity\nof one's self-concept. Self-efficacy is best explained as self-\nconfidence and is specifically connected to one's abilities. For\nMcGraw (2008), self-concept is a person's composite or col-\nlective view of himself or herself across a multi-dimensional\nset of specific precepts. It is based on self-knowledge and\nevaluation or worth of a person's capabilities that one formed\nthrough experience and interpretation of the environment.\nMcLead (2008) sees self-concept as how people think and\nevaluate themselves. Self-concept is an internal model that\ncomprises self-assessment (Fleming & Courtney, 1994).\nFeatures associated with self-concept include personality,\nskills, abilities, occupations, hobbies, and physical character-\nistics, among others. A person's self-concept may change with\ntime as reassessment occurs, which in some cases leads to\nidentity crises (Gerrig & Zimbardo, 2002). Self-concept is not\nrestricted to the present; it includes past selves and future\nselves. The past self represents the activities and experiences\nof the individual in previous occasions, while the future self\nindicates one's proposals and intentions that have not been\naccomplished. These correspond to hopes, fears, standards,\ngoals, and threats (Santrock, 2009). The present study hopes to\nfind out the impact of gender stereotype on students'self-con-\ncept and academic achievement.\nTiedemann (2000) indicates that parents' gender stereo-\ntypes and expectations for their children affect children's\nunderstanding of themselves. Researchers believe that self-\nconcept develops later, around age 7 or 8, as children are\ndevelopmentally prepared to begin to interpret their own\nfeelings, abilities, and feedback they receive from parents,\nteachers, and peers about themselves (Benner & Mistry,\n2007). Despite differing opinions about the onset of self-\nconcept development, researchers agree on the importance of\none's self-concept. Self-concept influences people's behav-\niors, and cognitive and emotional outcome, including aca-\ndemic achievement, levels of happiness, anxiety, social\nintegration, self-esteem, and life satisfaction (Marsh &\nMartin, 2011). It is observed that females are more extro-\nverted, anxious, and trusting, and have lower self-concept\nand self-esteem than their male counterparts (Berk, 2008,\n2010). This can contribute to the gender differences that arise\nbetween male and female children. In considering gender\nstereotype, students' self-concept, and academic achieve-\nment, a demographic variable that mediates the students'\ninfluence may include location. This has to do with whether\nthe school is located in urban or rural areas.\nThe emphasis on education and the amount of support\ngiven to children varies from one locality to another. One of\nthe most important effects of geographical location is the dif-\nference between the educational conditions in the urban and\nrural areas. Parents in the rural areas are on the average\npoorer than those in the urban areas. Therefore, they are less\nable to provide their children with school requirements and\nend up withdrawing their female children from school to\nenable them to cope with their financial obligations. Children\nin the rural areas are not so much acquainted with mechani-\ncal toys, amusement parks, electrical gadgets, books from\npublic libraries, newspapers and periodicals, cinema, televi-\nsion, and film shows. These are known to enrich the educa-\ntion of children in urban areas, and this may influence their\nachievement and self-concept. In the present study, location\nis perceived as a setting in which teaching and learning take\nplace such as school location. In other words, school location\nis categorized into urban and rural areas. Location can affect\nor influence learning, depending on the opportunities found\nor available in a particular location (urban and rural). It\nequally depends on the interest and emphasis on education,\nbased on the location that determines the academic achieve-\nment of children. According to Kauchak and Eggen (2011),\nnegative stereotypes about urban students create the impres-\nsion that developing a productive learning environment,\nthrough classroom management, is very difficult and seem\nalmost impossible for teachers. This implies that stereotyp-\ning in relation to location can equally affect the development\nand academic achievement of children. Therefore, students\nwhose self-concepts are not strongly developed can equally\nbe affected by stereotypic views.\nAcademic achievement refers to the outcome of teaching\nand learning acquired by individuals, more especially by stu-\ndents. It is commonly measured by examination, test, or\nassessment. To achieve is to gain by doing something suc-\ncessful with an effort or skill. It is believed that academic\nachievement concerns mental health. Achievement involves\nthe individuals'physical and intellectual skills, which lead to\nsatisfactory means of adjustment, social sensitivity, and ade-\nquate self-concept. Academic achievement is based on the\ndegree of intellectual simulation that the child could receive\nfrom learning situations. The student's gender stereotype and\nlocation may play vital roles in his or her academic achieve-\nment. In a study carried out by Vescio, Gervais, Snyder, and\nHoover (2005) on stereotypes, the finding indicated that\npowerful males use stereotypes to judge females. Stereotype\nseems contextually relevant when emphasizing females'\nweaknesses and strengths. For Steele, Spencer, and Aronson\n(2002), underachievement is a psychological response to ste-\nreotype that characterizes females as inferior to males on a\nspecific task such as mathematics in a school-specific\ndomain. Negative stereotype is a cognitive and emotional\nburden that impedes performance and consistently yields\nnegative expectations (Martin et al., 2007).\nTheoretical Framework\nAccording to Bandura's (1977) social learning theory, human\nbehavior is a function of the person plus the environment. In\nother words, the person, the behavior, and the environmental\nsituations are highly interrelated. Each is capable of influ-\nencing the other. The theory assumes that when two persons\nor groups interact, they become part of each other's\n4 SAGE Open\nenvironment. This means that school learning occurs as a\nresult of interactions of children and parents, children and\nteachers, children and peers, and children and school envi-\nronment. The theory further holds that performance in school\nlearning is traceable to gender stereotype as it relates to the\nlearners. This may be explained on the ground that family\nand school interactions may influence the child's perfor-\nmance in school. Based on the assumption of the theory, the\nsocial learning theory stipulates that academic dysfunction\nsometimes arises from gender stereotype and location of the\nstudent. This theory has a link with the present study as it has\nhighlighted a link between academic achievement and the\nstudents' gender stereotype. The theory will therefore serve\nas a guide to identify the elements of students'gender stereo-\ntype that may influence both academic performance and self-\nconcept with regard to teaching and learning in secondary\nschools. The social learning initiated by Bandura (1977)\nargues that learning is a product of the individual and the\nenvironment. This implies that the interaction between a stu-\ndent and the learning environment determines, to a certain\nextent, the performance of the student in a given school sub-\nject. The environments include both the school environment\nand the home environment, and other factors that are within\nthe environment such as stereotypic view, gender, location,\nand individual's self-concept.\nReview of Related Studies\nKarim (1990) conducted a study on \"Self-Concept: A Cross\nCultural Study of Adolescents.\" The sample consisted of 600\nadolescents with age range of 13 to 19 years, and the area of\nstudy was in America. Thakur and Prasada's self-esteem\ninventory was used to measure self-concept of adolescents.\nThe results revealed that sex variation had a significant\nimpact on personality perception and self-concept. The\nfemales possessed more positive self-concept in comparison\nwith the males. Furthermore, Patil (1994) carried out a study\non sex role perception of adolescents as influenced by self-\nconcept and achievement motivation. The sample consisted\nstandards with equal number of students from English and\nKannada medium schools of Hubli and Dharwad city. The\nresults revealed that sex role perception had significant posi-\ntive relationship with self-concept. Ahmed (1998) carried\nout a study to explore the difference in boys' and girls' aca-\ndemic achievements. The study was conducted on 120 stu-\ndents belonging to the age group of 13 to 18 years studying\nin coeducation English medium institutions confined to the\nsuburbs of Mumbai City in India. The instrument used for\ndata collection was Shafi's achievement motivation scale.\nThe findings revealed that influence of gender on achieve-\nment motivation was statistically not significant.\nOn the issue of the influence of gender on academic\nachievement and self-concept, Francis and Skelton (2005)\nexplain that how students are encouraged or discouraged in\nschool subjects may be based on learning opportunities.\nMale students tend to receive more encouragement in sci-\nences while females are nurtured more in arts. Gisela fur-\nther asserted that parents are often gender biased, and this\ninfluences students' achievements. In a study carried out by\nGurian and Stevens (2007) on the minds of boys, the find-\nings, among others, indicated that boys receive both lower\ngrades and the majority of failing grades, and they drop out\nof school 4 times more than girls. Boys are identified for\ndisciplinary infractions as much as 10 times more than\ngirls. This could be attributed to the orientation that chil-\ndren acquired from their parents in the process of develop-\nment. According to Kauchak and Eggen (2011), the brains\nof male and female children are wired differently for learn-\ning. Their findings indicate that the components of the brain\nthat focus on words and motor skills develop a year ahead\nfor girls than for boys, thus giving the female child oppor-\ntunities and advantages in reading and performing small\nmotor tasks such as using pencils. In a similar study, Gurian\nand Stevens (2007) found that emotional centers in the\nbrain are more advanced in female children, making them\ncalmer and more able to sit steady for longer periods in the\nclassroom situations than their male counterparts.\nConsequently, there are greater opportunities for female\nchildren to perform as much as the male children, if encour-\naged, and even better than their male counterparts. Devi\nand Mayuri (2003) found that girls were superior to boys in\nacademic achievement.\nIn Nigeria, the issue of gender permeates different set-\ntings. It was reported in \"UN Appeal for Girls' Education\"\n(2006) that the African patriarchal societal view point favors\nboys over girls because boys maintain the family lineage.\nResearch has shown that millions of girls do not have access\nto school despite the efforts to reverse the situation. Okeke,\nNzewi, and Njoku (2008) identified child labor, poverty, lack\nof sponsorship, quest for wealth, bereavement, truancy,\nengagement of girls as house-helps as some of the militating\nfactors against girls'education in Nigeria. Above all, the sce-\nnarios presented above tend to indicate that there are con-\nflicting research findings on the influence of gender and\nlocation on both the achievement and self-concept of stu-\ndents. This made this study focus on the influence of both\ngender stereotype and school location on academic achieve-\nment and self-concept of students. Some of the studies\nreviewed above did not look at the issue of self-concept and\nacademic achievement. The locations, vis-\u00e0-vis urban and\nrural, were not reflected in most of the studies reviewed.\nThese are what the present study hopes to find out.\nGenerally, the major purpose of the study is to investigate\nthe influence of gender stereotype on students' self-concept\nand academic achievement in senior secondary schools.\nSpecifically, the study intends to do the following:\n1. Ascertain the influence of gender stereotype on\nsenior secondary school students' self-concept,\nIgbo et al. 5\n2. Ascertain the influence of gender stereotype on senior\nsecondary school students' academic achievement\n3. Ascertain the influence of school location on senior\nsecondary school students' self-concept.\n4. Determine the influence of school location on senior\nsecondary school students' academic achievement.\nThe following research questions guided the study:\nResearch Question 1: What is the influence of gender\nstereotype on senior secondary school students'\nself-concept?\nResearch Question 2: What is the influence of gender\nstereotype on senior secondary school students' academic\nachievement?\nResearch Question 3: What is the influence of school\nlocation on senior secondary school students'\nself-concept?\nResearch Question 4: What is the influence of school\nlocation on senior secondary school students' academic\nachievement?\nThe following null hypotheses were tested at the .05 level\nof significance:\nNull Hypothesis 1 (Ho\n): Gender stereotype has no sig-\nnificant influence on self-concept of senior secondary\nschool students.\nNull Hypothesis 2 (Ho\n): Gender stereotype has no sig-\nnificant influence on academic achievement of senior sec-\nondary school students.\nNull Hypothesis 3 (Ho\n): Location has no significant\ninfluence on self-concept of senior secondary school\nstudents.\nNull Hypothesis 4 (Ho\n): Location has no significant\ninfluence on academic achievement of senior secondary\nschool students.\nResearch Method\nThis study was carried out in Enugu state of Nigeria. Enugu\nstate has six educational zones. The zones are Awgu, Enugu,\nObollo-Afor, Agbani, Udi, and Nsukka. In all, there are 277\ngovernment-owned secondary schools or public secondary\nschools. The researchers decided to choose Udi Education\nZone because it is one of the areas where preference has been\nmade on boys'education over girls. Besides, girls are always\nencouraged to get married as early as possible.\nsenior secondary class two (SSII) students with the popula-\nThe ex post facto research design was adopted for this\nresearch design seeks to establish cause\u00adeffect relationships,\nand the researchers have no control over the variables under\nstudy and therefore cannot manipulate the variables. Ex\npost facto research design is a method that can be applied\ninstead of an experiment, to test hypotheses about cause\nand effect in situations where it is impossible to control or\nmanipulate the dependent variable or the independent vari-\nable (Lord, 1973). It was noted that researchers can only\nreport what has happened and examine the data retrospec-\ntively to establish causes, relationships and associations,\nand their meanings (Cohen, Manion, & Morrison, 2011;\nPunch, 2011). Both school location and student's gender\nare variables that cannot be controlled by the researchers,\nand so their influence on students' achievement and self-\nconcept were investigated.\nSampling Procedure\nThe researchers adopted multi-phase sample. This is one of\nthe probability sampling techniques in which every member\nof the wider population has an equal chance of being selected\nin the sample study. Inclusion or exclusion from the sample\nis a matter of chance (Cohen et al., 2011). Besides, multi-\nphase samples have less risk of bias.\nand 114 females made up the sample of the study. In sam-\npling, the researchers adapted the National Education\nAssociation Technique in Krejcie and Morgan (1970) for\ndetermining the sample size. This technique states that\nby the number, the 342 sample size falls within the range of\nsampling. The locations of the schools were considered.\nThis means that the schools located in both urban and rural\nareas were sampled and used for the study. Specifically, in\na multi-phase sample, the selection is done in phases, and\nthe purposes change at every particular phase. For the pur-\npose of this study, the selection was done on location of\nschool and gender bases. The multi-phase sampling tech-\nnique was used in selecting the sample for the study. First,\nthe selection of one out of the six education zones in Enugu\nState was done. Second, nine schools were selected: three\nboys' schools, three girls' schools, and three coeducational\nschools (for boys and girls). From each of the three boys'\nschools, 56 boys were selected. From each of the girls'\nschools, 27 girls were selected. In the three coeducational\nschools, 60 males and 33 females were selected. Altogether,\nthe sample used for the study. These made up the total sam-\nple size of 342 SSII students. The choice of SSII students\nwas informed by the fact that the students fall within the\nage range of middle adolescents, which corresponded with\nthe application of Marsh's Self Description Questionnaire\nII [Strongly Disagree(SD)QII], which was adapted by the\nresearchers for the present study.\n6 SAGE Open\nInstrumentation\nTwo instruments were used in carrying out the study: Students'\nStereotype Self-Concept Questionnaire (SSSCQ) and Student\nMathematics Achievement Test (SMAT). SSSCQ was\nadapted by the researchers after reviewing, extensively,\nrelated literature. The researchers adapted Marsh's SDQII\nfrom Marsh's Self Description Questionnaire (SDQ) for this\nstudy. The instrument that was adapted for this study is\nMarsh's SDQII. Marsh's SDQ was designed or developed by\nMarsh (1988), and it is based on the Shavelson, Hubner, and\nStanton (1996) hierarchical and multi-dimensional model. It\nis a multi-dimensional self-concept instrument that has been\nextensively psychometrically validated. It is divided into\nthree versions. Version I (SDQI) is basically for primary\nschools, and it is used to measure self-concept of the adoles-\ncents. Version II (SDQ II) is for secondary schools and is\nused for early to the middle adolescents. Neill (1991) noted\nthat the overall rating of SDQ II is 8/10. Version III (SDQ II)\nis basically for late adolescents and young adults. Generally,\nSDQ comprises 8 to 12 self-concept scales. The SDQ II,\nwhich is the area of interest of the present study, specified\nhow students feel about themselves in 11 areas. These areas\ninclude physical abilities, physical appearance, relations to\npeers of the opposite sex, relations to peer of the same sex,\nrelations to parents, honesty, emotional stability, mathemati-\ncal ability, academics in general, and global self-concept\n(Wenglinsky, 1996). For the present study, the researchers\nfocused on 4 out of Marsh's 11 dimensions. These include\nphysical appearance, relations with parents, emotional stabil-\nity, and global self-concept. The areas that were eliminated\nare not relevant to the present study, which focuses on gender\nstereotype and self-concept. The SSSCQ was adapted basi-\ncally from the four dimensions. The four scales that were\nrelated to the present study were pulled together into one\nscale. The researchers were able to abstract and modify\n20-item statements to suit the present study. Four items were\ntaken from physical appearance and emotional stability,\nrespectively, while six items were abstracted from relations\nwith parents and another six from global self-concept. These\nfour scales that were related to the present study were pulled\ntogether into one scale. In structuring the item statements,\nthe following levels were applied: strongly agree (SA), 4\npoints; agree (A), 3 points; disagree (D), 2 points; and\nstrongly disagree (SD), 1 point.\nSMAT was the second instrument used by the researchers.\nThe instrument was developed by the researchers with the\nhelp of two qualified mathematics teachers in senior second-\nary schools and a professional from the department of sci-\nence education (mathematics education). This was done after\nthe review of relevant literature. The instrument was a\n10-item statements which were generated from three content\nareas of SSII mathematics syllabus which include probabil-\nity, sequence, and trigonometry. In developing the instru-\nment, the researchers used test blue print as a guide. The\nobjectives of the contents were considered. The questions in\nthe three content areas were classified into two: lower and\nhigher order questions. A four-point rating scale ranging\nfrom SA = 4, A = 3, D = 2, and SD = 1 was adopted. Any\nresponse with a mean score of 2.5 and above was considered\nas \"agree\" or acceptable while responses below the mean\nscore of 2.5 were considered as \"disagree\" or not accepted.\nValidity and Reliability\nThe students' stereotype self-concept questionnaire was face\nvalidated by three experts, from educational psychology,\nspecial education, and measurement and evaluation. The\nexperts' suggestions were used in improving the instrument.\nThe SMAT was equally face and content validated. The face\nvalidation was done by three experts; two teachers from\nsenior secondary school and one from the department of sci-\nence education (mathematics education). The experts' views\nhelped in adjusting the instrument. For content validation,\nthe table of specification according to Bloom's (1956)\nTaxonomy of Educational Objectives was used. The instru-\nment was validated based on the purpose of the study,\nresearch questions, and the hypotheses. The experts were\nasked to check the language used in constructing the ques-\ntionnaire, and to clarify the adequacy of the items and the\nrelevance of the instrument to the topic of the study. The cor-\nrections were effected based on the suggestions made by the\nexperts.\nTo ascertain the reliability of the instruments, 20 copies of\nthe students' stereotype self-concept questionnaire and 20\ncopies of the Mathematics Achievement Test were subjected\nto trial testing in four secondary schools in Owerri North\nLocal Government Areas in Imo State, which is not part of\nthe study area. Cronbach's alpha procedure was used to esti-\nmate the internal consistency of the instruments, and reliabil-\nity coefficients of 0.82 and 0.78 were obtained from Students'\nStereotype Self-Concept Questionnaire and Mathematics\nAchievement Test, respectively. In analyzing the data, means\nand standard deviations were used for the research questions,\nwhile t-test statistic was applied in testing the hypotheses to\ngeneralize findings from the data.\nResults and Discussion\nResearch Question 1\nWhat is the influence of gender stereotype on secondary\nschool students' self-concept?\nThe results presented in Table 1 shows that the mean\nresponse of male students on self-concept was 3.20, with a\ndard deviation of 0.29 for female students. The difference\nbetween the mean response of male and female students was\n0.35. This indicates that gender stereotype appears to have\nsome influence on male and female students' self-concept.\nIgbo et al. 7\nHo\nGender stereotype has no significant influence on self-concept\nof secondary school students.\nTable 1 also revealed that a t-test value of 11.05 was\nobtained with associated probability value of .00. As the\nassociated probability (.00) was less than .05, Ho\nwas\nrejected. It was therefore concluded that gender stereotype\nhas significant influence on self-concept of secondary school\nstudents in favor of male students.\nResearch Question 2\nWhat is the influence of gender stereotype on secondary\nschool students' academic achievement in mathematics?\nThe result presented in Table 2 shows that mean achieve-\nment score of male students on mathematics was 74.48 with\ndard deviation of 9.62 for female students. The difference\nbetween the mean response of male and female students was\n2.68. This indicates that gender stereotype seems to have\nsome influence on male and female students' academic\nachievement.\nHo\nGender stereotype has no significant influence on academic\nachievement of secondary school students in mathematics.\nTable 2 also revealed that a t-test value of 2.77 was\nobtained with associated probability value of .01. As the\nassociated probability (.01) was less than .05, Ho\nwas\nrejected. It was therefore concluded that gender stereotype\nhas significant influence on academic achievement of sec-\nondary school students in mathematics in favor of males.\nResearch Question 3\nWhat is the influence of school location on secondary school\nstudents' self-concept?\nThe result presented in Table 3 shows that the mean\nresponse of urban-based students on self-concept was 3.01\nwith a standard deviation of 0.23, and a mean of 2.95 with a\nstandard deviation of 0.36 for rural-based students. The differ-\nence between the mean response of urban and rural students\nwas 0.06. This indicates that school location appears to have\nsimilar influence on urban and rural students' self-concept.\nHo\nSchool location has no significant influence on self-concept\nof secondary school students.\nTable 3 equally revealed that a t-test value of 1.54 was\nobtained with associated probability value of .12.As the associ-\nated probability (.12) was greater than .05, Ho\nwas not rejected.\nIt was therefore concluded that school location has no signifi-\ncant influence on self-concept of secondary school students.\nResearch Question 4\nWhat is the influence of school location on secondary school\nstudents' academic achievement in mathematics?\nThe result presented in Table 4 shows that the mean\nachievement score of urban students in mathematics was\nwith a standard deviation of 7.64 for students in the rural\nschools. Going by the scores, the difference between the\nmean response of urban and rural students was 11.04. This\nindicates that school location appears to have some influence\non urban and rural students' academic achievement.\nSchool location has no significant influence on academic\nachievement of secondary school students.\nTable 4 also revealed that a t-test value of 13.74 was\nobtained with associated probability value of .00. As the\nassociated probability (.00) was less than .05, Ho\nwas\nTable 1.Independent t-Test Analysis of the Influence of Gender Stereotype on Secondary School Students' Self-Concept.\nGender n X sd df t\ncal\nSig.

It was therefore concluded that school location has\nsignificant influence on academic achievement of secondary\nschool students in mathematics.\nDiscussion\nGenerally, the research question that guided the study focused\non the influence of gender stereotype in relation to academic\nachievement and self-concept of students. The results of the\nstudy confirmed the suspicion the researchers had, that is, the\npossibility of gender stereotypic views of parents and teachers\nencouraging male children with particular courses and dis-\ncouraging female children in the same courses, thus influenc-\ning their academic achievement. In the long term, this might\nequally affect their self-concept. This is in line with Steele et\nal. (2002), who found that stereotypic views manifest under-\nachievement on the part of females and affect their self-con-\ncept. The findings also corroborate the findings of Vescio et al.\n(2005) who found that powerful application of stereotype is\nrelated to female weaknesses and strengths. Therefore, the use\nof stereotypic views could be responsible for the manifestation\nof male and female achievements in mathematics. It could\nhave equally affected their self-concept.\nHowever, the influence of location on the academic\nachievement of students is in favor of those in urban areas.\nThis could be attributed to the network of opportunities that\nare easily found in urban areas. In most rural areas, there is no\nrural electrification, and this makes it impossible for children\nin rural areas to study beyond the knowledge information\nacquired from their parents and classroom teachers. The pos-\nsible academic superiority achieved by children in the urban\nareas may also be due to the exposure to extra classes that are\nnot usually available to the children in rural areas. In line with\nthis, Mangal (2010) found that environmental or location\nforces, especially the home, neighborhood, and school atmo-\nsphere, significantly influence the educational attainment of\nstudents. Another possible factor could be as a result of pov-\nerty, which creates opportunities for withdrawing the female\nchildren from school, while allowing their male counterparts\nto continue. This is in line with Okeke et al. (2008), who iden-\ntified the poor performance of female students as partly a\nresult of engaging the girls as \"house helps\" and child labor-\ners, and thus withdrawing the girl child from school as a result\nof poverty. For Mangal (2010), girls are left to perform mostly\nas domestic workers. Therefore, in the process of helping out\nwith many household chores or to augment the family income,\nfemale children devote less time to their studies, creating\nopportunities for poor academic achievement. When a child\nis withdrawn from school for a long time, meeting up with\nothers in the same class becomes almost impossible for the\nwithdrawn child.\nIt has also been found that there is little difference in the\nmean self-concept for the students from urban school and\nthose from the rural schools. The mean self-concept of those\nfrom the urban school is higher than that of students from\nrural schools. The analysis of the mean differences in loca-\ntion with regard to self-concept indicates that location has no\nsignificant influence on the students' self-concept. This\nagrees with the findings of Karim (1990), who observed that\na significant difference exists between urban and rural stu-\ndents' self-concept. Students from rural areas had higher\nself-concept than students from urban areas. The study also\nrevealed that there is difference in the mean achievement\nscores for the students from urban schools and those from\nrural schools. The mean achievement of those from the urban\nschools is higher than those in the rural schools. The analysis\nof the mean shows that location has no significant influence\non academic achievement. The findings are in line with the\nassertion of Karim (1990), who found that children in the\nrural areas are not so much acquainted with mechanical toys,\namusement parks, electrical gadgets, books from public\nlibrary, newspapers and periodicals, television, and film\nshows. These are known to enrich the education of children\nin urban areas and thus may influence their achievement. The\nstudy also revealed that male students have higher mean self-\nconcept than their female counterparts. The analysis of the\nmean shows that there is no significant influence of gender\non self-concept. This is in line with the finding of Steele et al.\nTable 3.Independent t-Test Analysis of the Influence of School Location on Secondary School Students' Self-Concept.\nLocation N X sd df t\ncal\nSig. Decision\nNote.  = 0.05. n = number; X = mean; sd = standard deviation; df = degree of freedom; t\ncal\n= t-calculated, sig. = significance; NS = not significant.\nTable 4.Independent t-test Analysis of the Influence of School Location on Secondary School Students' Academic Achievement in\nMathematics.\nLocation N X sd df t\ncal\nSig.

Furthermore, it was revealed that female students\nhave higher mean achievement scores than their male coun-\nterparts. The analysis of the mean shows that gender has no\nsignificant influence on students' academic achievement.\nIn relation to Bandura's (1977) social learning theory, it is\nevident that human beings are \"social animals,\" and this can\naffect them positively or negatively depending on the stereo-\ntypic view, which individuals are brought up with. Individuals\nlearn by modeling, and one can only model what he or she\nhas come across. This could affect the self-concept and aca-\ndemic achievement based on gender stereotype that manifest\nwithin the individual environments. This is in line with\nVescio,Gervais,Snyder and Hoover(2005) findings that pow-\nerful or very strong stereotyping is related to students'low or\nhigh self-concept and poor or high academic achievements.\nConclusion\nThe findings of this study show that gender stereotypic views\nhave facilitative influence on secondary school students'self-\nconcept and academic achievement. Stereotype is a general-\nization that has to do with the characteristics of a group of\npeople. It is usually known for segregation between one group\nof people and the other showing superiority over one group\nagainst the other. G. N. Martin et al. (2007) noted that stereo-\ntyping members of a group negatively may pose a cognitive\nand emotional burden that can impede performance and con-\nsistently yield negative expectations. From the findings, gen-\nder stereotype has, as a result, denied female students the\nright and privileges they should have enjoyed. Rather, it has\nled to poor academic achievement. Self-concept is the collec-\ntion of one's self-image, feelings or emotions, and beliefs. It\nis the way individuals perceive themselves, which includes\ntheir past and present experiences. All these, put together,\naffect individuals positively or negatively, depending on the\nangle the stereotyping individuals found themselves.\nGenerally, the results revealed that gender stereotype has sig-\nnificant influence on academic achievement of students. The\nconclusion from the findings indicated that both self-concept\nand location have no significant influence on the students.\nLimitations of the Study\nUsually, no study goes without some limitations. The follow-\ning were observed by the researchers as limitations to the\npresent study:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 The study focused on public or government schools,\nto the exclusion of private schools run by individuals\nand religious organizations. This may have conse-\nquences for the generalization of the findings.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 The study was conducted in Enugu State, which is 1\nof the 36 states in Nigeria. Perhaps using 2 or 3 more\nstates in the country may be better so as to broaden the\nscope of the study.\nIn spite of these limitations, the findings strongly indicate\nthat gender stereotyping made a difference in self-concept\nand academic achievement among secondary school students\nin favor of the male students.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAboud, F.
