Prices were similar in both groups at the\nstart of the period (approximately $9200 per admission). By the end of the period, prices at hospitals in the largest systems\nexceeded prices at other California hospitals by almost $4000 per patient admission. Our study findings are potentially useful\nto policy makers across the country for several reasons. Our data measure actual prices for a large sample of hospitals\nover a long period of time in California.

A competing view is that by consolidating into larger\nmulti-hospital systems, it becomes virtually impossible for\nhealth plans to develop insurance products without including\nat least some of the system's member hospitals in their pre-\nferred contracted networks--so-called must-have hospitals.\nWhen this occurs, the system gains leverage to negotiate con-\ntracts with health plans on an \"all-or-none\" basis, requiring the\nplan to include all system member hospitals in the plan's pre-\nferred networks, regardless of their prices (or quality) relative\nto other potential substitutes in the market.9,10 This could result\nin higher prices to health plans and higher health insurance\npremiums to consumers.\nThis paper examines hospital prices in California over time\nhospitalsystems.OurdatashowthathospitalpricesinCalifornia\ngrew substantially (+76% per hospital admission) across all\nat hospitals that are part of largest, multi-hospital systems grew\nsubstantially more (+113%) than prices paid to all other\nCalifornia hospitals (70%).

In addition, California\nexperienced its wave of consolidation much earlier than the\nrest of the country and as such California's experience with\nlarge hospital systems may provide some insights into what\nmay happen across the United States from hospital consoli-\ndation including growth of large, multi-hospital systems now\nforming in the rest of the country.\nData and Methods\nvided by Blue Shield of California, one of the largest com-\nmercial health plans with coverage throughout the state of\nCalifornia. Prices represent the amounts actually approved\nfor payment (as opposed to billed charges). Data on hospital\ncharacteristics are from the California Office of Statewide\nHealth Planning and Development and the Centers for\nMedicare and Medicaid Services (Diagnosis Related Groups\n(DRG) weights, hospital wage index).\nFor each hospital, the average price (allowed payment)\nper day and per admission is calculated for all services.\nHospital-level average prices are calculated for each hospital\nfor 2-year periods beginning in 2004 and across all hospitals\ntime). Prices are calculated separately for hospitals that are\nmembers of the 2 largest, multi-hospital systems and com-\npared with all other hospitals. Data from California Office of\nStatewide Health Planning Development (OSHPD) are used\nto identify hospital members of the 2 largest multi-hospital\nsystems (Dignity Health, previously Catholic Healthcare\nWest, and Sutter Health). The number of hospitals in each of\nthese 2 systems has remained relatively constant throughout\nthe study period (Dignity Health = 32, Sutter Health = 25 in\nin these 2 systems are quite diverse: ranging in size from\nunder 50 beds to over 700 beds, urban and rural, trauma and\nnon-trauma status, and serving a varying range of commer-\ncial and low income populations.\nRegression Analysis\nHospital prices grew faster for hospitals in the 2 largest sys-\ntems compared with all other hospitals. We constructed a\nregression model to test for the possibility that greater price\nincreases observed in hospitals in the largest, multi-hospital\nsystems relative to all other hospitals are driven by the char-\nacteristics of the hospitals in large systems separately from\ntheir membership in a large hospital system. For example,\nhospitals facing less competition may have higher price\nincreases even if they were not part of a large hospital sys-\ntem. The regression model was applied to all hospitals to\ncontrol for membership in a large system and other factors\nhypothesized to affect hospital prices separately from mem-\nbership in a large hospital system including hospital owner-\nship and type (for-profit, district, teaching, rural, trauma),\ntotal beds (log), payor mix (disproportionate share hospital,\npercent total admissions commercial payors), percent total\nadmissions through emergency room (ER), Centers for\nMedicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) wage index, and\nlocal market competition (measured by a hospital specific\nHerfindahl-Hirschman Index).12,13 Time dummy variables\nare included to capture industry-wide effects of new technol-\nogy, quality, and other changes than may have occurred dur-\ning the study period affecting all hospitals. Inpatient prices\nare measured as the allowed amount per admission divided\nby the DRG weight. All measures are calculated at the hospi-\ntal level and averaged over 2-year periods. The regression\nanalysis was conducted twice. Model 1 includes only time\ntrends and indicator variables interacted with time for hospi-\ntals that are members of the largest systems. Model 2 includes\nthese same measures plus all the control variables. We com-\npare the estimated coefficients for indicator variables for\nhospitals that are members of the largest systems (interacted\nwith time) between the 2 models to determine the extent to\nwhich other factors explain and therefore reduce the substan-\ntial difference in price trends between the 2 groups.\nResults\nHospital prices per day and per admission (Figure 1) grew\nper admission prices across all hospitals grew from $10 113\nperiod that included the great recession, and, during which,\nother economic indicators grew at moderate rates: California\nhousehold income grew by 23% and inflation (urban con-\nsumer price index) grew by 24%. A review of detailed price\ntrend data for homogeneous service categories (not shown\nhere) such as maternity, surgery, medical, and so forth show\nprice increases were generally similar across all services.\nFigures 2 and 3 show the results for regression models 1\nand 2. Model 1 (includes only time trends and indicator vari-\nables over time for hospitals that are members of the largest\nsystems) results show a clear upward price trend over time\nabove for hospitals in the largest systems compared with all\nother hospitals. Model 2 (includes the same measures as\nmodel 1 plus the control variables) results confirm the\nupward price trends for hospitals in large system hospitals\nsubstantially exceeding all other hospitals.\nFigure 4 graphs the trends in price per admission using the\nresults from Model 2 to compare hospitals in large systems\nwith all other hospitals, controlling for other factors that\nsame level for both groups of hospitals, (approximately\n$9200 per admission), and, though prices in both groups\ngrew over time, prices at hospitals in the largest, multi-\nhospital systems grew much more rapidly than prices in all\nother hospitals.

Multi-\nhospital systems form, ostensibly, to increase efficiency and\nquality and to control cost and price increases. Yet, our data,\nfrom a very large commercial payor, show that hospital\nprices across all hospitals have increased substantially in\nCalifornia during a period of low overall price inflation, low\neconomic growth, and declining demand for inpatient care\nA potentially more troubling trend, however, is the sub-\nstantially greater price increases observed in hospitals that are\nmembers of California's largest, multi-hospital\n---------------------------------------------------------\nVariable | Coefficient Std.

Model 2: Estimated differences (adjusted) in payment per admission between large system hospitals and all other hospitals,\nMelnick and Fonkych 5\nsystems--average prices grew 113% in hospitals in the 2\nlargest systems compared with 70% growth in all other hospi-\ntals. It is important to note that this substantial price differen-\ntial is not driven by other factors such as case mix, payor mix,\nand changes in local wage costs and local market competi-\ntion, or other hospital characteristics. We found that prices in\nhospitals that are members of the largest multi-hospital sys-\ntems are more than 20% higher by the end of the study period\nwhen compared with other hospitals after controlling for a\nwide range of factors.\nThe substantial difference in prices between hospitals in\nthe largest multi-hospital systems and all other hospitals is\nconsistent with a model that suggests that hospitals in large\nmulti-hospital systems, by tying their hospitals together\nusing \"all-or-none\" contracting, are able to achieve market\npower over prices beyond any local market advantages. A\nfurther potential danger is that with large size comes the\npotential to expand and protect market power. Large hospital\nsystems that conduct \"all-or-none\" contracting have report-\nedly added other anti-competitive language to their contracts\nto protect and expand their market power including clauses\nthat prohibit health plans or employers from developing\n\"tiered\" benefit packages that would allow them to accept\nthe \"all-or-none\" demands to include all system hospitals in\ncontracted networks but at the same time develop new prod-\nucts to stimulate competition through differential cost shar-\ning across member hospitals.13-17 Another example is\nso-called gag-clauses which prohibit health plans from\nFigure 4.

If this interpretation is correct, there are several\nimportant lessons for policy makers across the country as\nthey face decisions regarding consolidation. First, our regres-\nsion findings suggest that the market power effects of large\nhospital systems do not necessarily require consolidation\nbetween local competitors. Indeed, many of the hospitals in\nCalifornia's largest systems do not have substantial overlap-\nping markets with other system member hospitals. This sug-\ngests that hospitals in large hospital systems, by tying their\nhospitals together, are able to achieve market power over\nprices beyond any local market advantages.\nIt is important to note that we have not controlled explic-\nitly for differences between large system hospitals and other\nhospitals with regard to quality and technology differences\nand other factors such as financial status of hospitals or that\nhospitals that joined the largest systems may be different in\nsome other unmeasured way. While model 2 does not\ninclude explicit measures of hospital quality due to the\nabsence of quality data for earlier time periods, quality data\nare available covering years at the end of the study period\nand these data show minimal effects on price differences\nbetween the 2 groups of hospitals. IN addition, our analyses\nonly cover systems within a single state and not multi-state\nsystems. Further research is needed to address these issues\nand to more precisely control for other potential price related\nfactors.\nHowever, policy makers at both the federal and state levels\nmight consider the potential lessons from California as we\nawait further research as they develop policies to shape a more\ncost-effective health care system in an era of consolidation.\nSpecifically, policy makers could consider limiting \"all-or-\nnone\" contracting by multi-hospital systems and prohibiting\nother anti-competitive contract language that flows from mar-\nket power achieved by large multi-hospital systems.20 Such\npro-competitive regulation would allow for hospital systems\nto integrate to improve efficiencies without the deleterious\nside effects of increased market power which can result in\nreduced price competition and higher costs to consumers.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This\nstudy was supported by USC Center for Health Financing, Policy,\nand Management.\nReferences\n1.
