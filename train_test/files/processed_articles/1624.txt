Specifi-\ncally, acculturation has been linked to increased body mass\nindex [3\u00ad5], waist circumference and abdominal obesity [6,\nand cardiovascular morbidity and mortality [1, 12, 13].\nRecent research has also shown that acculturation is asso-\nciated with increasing subclinical indicators of CVD\nincluding higher levels of coronary calcification, carotid\natherosclerotic plaque, and greater intima-media thickness\nResearch focusing on Mexican-Americans has also\nshown that acculturation is associated with worsening CVD\nrisk profiles and higher CVD morbidity and mortality [16,\n17]. In particular, US-born Mexican-Americans have been\nfound to have higher levels of smoking, body mass index\nand obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and cholesterol than\nMexican-American immigrants [6, 18]. US-born Mexican-\nAmericans have also been shown to have higher levels of\ncarotid atherosclerotic plaque, and greater intima-media\nthickness than Mexican-American immigrants [14]. In\naddition, research has shown that US-born Mexican\nAmericans consume less ``heart healthy diets'' than\nMexican immigrants [19].\nOne common limitation of the previous research on\ngenerational differences in CVD risk factor profiles among\nMexican-Americans has been its reliance on cross-sec-\ntional data. Cross-sectional comparisons between immi-\ngrants and their US-born counterparts at a particular point\nin time do not provide estimates of the ``true'' generational\neffects on health because they fail to account for temporal\nL.

To estimate the ``true''\ngenerational effect on health one must compare the health\nof parents and their children, but analyses of cross-\nsectional surveys compare immigrants with members of the\nsecond generation in one time period. Within a cross-\nsectional survey, members of the second generation are not\nthe children of the immigrants; rather, they are the children\nof immigrants from the previous generation. If the health of\nimmigrants has improved over time, as is likely with\nMexican-American immigrants given the increases in life\nexpectancy in Mexico over the past several decades [20],\nthen cross-sectional studies compare today's healthier\nimmigrants with the children of less healthy immigrants\nfrom a generation ago. Such comparisons may overstate\ntrue generational declines in health or even indicate a\ndecline when in fact there is no change or generational\nprogress. In research on educational outcomes, Smith [21]\nfound that cross-sectional comparisons of immigrant and\nsecond generation Hispanics substantially understated the\ndegree of generational progress in educational attainment\nand wages.\nIn this study, we investigate differences in CVD\nrisk factor profiles between first and second generation\nMexican-Americans with cross-sectional data from two\n``true'' comparisons between immigrants (first generation)\nand their children with these data, we compare immigrants\nin the first time period with second generation individuals\nin the second time period. In the social sciences, using\nmultiple cross-sectional datasets to approximate the anal-\nysis of longitudinal data is commonly referred to as the\nconstruction of pseudo-cohorts [22]. In addition, we take\nthe typical approach of investigating generational differ-\nences in CVD risk factor profiles between first and second\ngeneration Mexican-Americans within each cross-sectional\nsurvey.\nMethods\nData Sources\nThis study used two data sources: (1) the Hispanic Health\nand Nutrition Examination Survey (HHANES), conducted\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\nmultipurpose health surveys, and public use datasets are\naccessible over the Internet (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/\nnhanes.htm). Both surveys used complex multistage\nclustered sampling designs. The HHANES sample was\nrepresentative of civilian non-institutionalized Mexican-\nAmericans living in California, Arizona, New Mexico,\nTexas, and Colorado; Puerto Ricans living in the Northeast;\nand Cuban-Americans living in Florida at the time of the\nsurvey. The five Southwestern states included in the\nHHANES accounted for 83% of the Mexican-American\nU.S. civilian non-institutionalized population, and includes\noversamples of Hispanics, African-Americans, and the\nelderly.\nSubjects in both surveys were interviewed in the\nhousehold and subsequently underwent a standardized\nphysical examination and laboratory analyses of blood and\nurine samples in a mobile examination center (MEC). The\ninterviews elicited information on a wide range of health\nconditions, health behaviors, and demographic and socio-\neconomic characteristics of participants. The physical\nexamination included measurements of height and weight\nas well as up to three blood pressure measurements. The\nlaboratory tests included glucose and lipid levels. A subset\nof Subjects was asked to fast overnight prior to their\nexamination and laboratory tests.\nOutcome Measures\nWe assessed the following individual cardiovascular risk\nfactors: hypertension (yes/no), diabetes (yes/no), total and\nhigh-density lipoprotein (HLD) cholesterol (mg/dl), current\nsmoking status (yes/no), and body mass index (BMI) kg/m\n[2] and obesity (yes/no) [26]. Subjects were categorized as\nhaving hypertension if they had a history of hypertension\ndiagnosed by a doctor and were taking blood pressure\nmedications, a systolic blood pressure greater than\n140 mmHg, or a diastolic blood pressure greater than\n90 mmHg. We used the mean of subjects' first two blood\npressure measurements in determining whether they had\nhypertension. We used two blood pressure measurements\nrather than three because HHANES only has two mea-\nsurements. Subjects were categorized as having diabetes if\nthey had a history of diabetes diagnosed by a doctor and\nwere taking medications for diabetes or had a fasting blood\nglucose level of 126 mg/dl or more.\nIn addition, we computed the Framingham Risk Score\n(FRS) for subjects 30\u00ad74 years of age according to the\nalgorithms published by Wilson et al. [27]. Briefly, the FRS\nis a composite score that can be used to estimate the risk of\ndeveloping coronary heart disease (CHD) (angina pectoris,\nmyocardial infarction, or coronary heart disease death)\nover a 10-year period for adult men and women 30\u00ad\n74 years of age. Points are assigned based on a person's\nage, gender, total cholesterol (mg/dl), HDL cholesterol\n(mg/dl), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (mmHg),\npresence of diabetes (yes/no), and current smoking status\n(yes/no), then the points are summed to obtain the FRS. We\nassessed each subject's probability of developing CHD\nover a 10-year period using published tables [27].\nParticipants\nWe identified first and second generation Mexican-Amer-\nicans between the ages of 20 and 74 years in the HHANES\nwomen. Mexican origin was based on self-report. Indi-\nviduals were categorized as first generation if they were\nborn in Mexico and second generation if they were born in\nthe US and had at least one parent born in Mexico. In the\nHHANES, 2,423 first and second generation Mexican-\nAmericans completed the interviews, 2,058 completed the\ninterviews and the physical examination and provided\nblood samples, and 661 provided fasting blood samples. In\ntion Mexican-Americans completed the interviews, 2,198\nwere examined and provided blood samples, and 951\nprovided fasting blood samples.\nThe analytic samples differed across the study outcomes\ndepending on how the data were collected for each out-\ncome. For example, the information on current smoking\nstatus was obtained from the interviews, the data on blood\npressure measurements were obtained during the physical\nexamination, and fasting blood glucose levels were\nobtained from the fasting blood samples.\nStatistical Analysis\nWe conducted two types of statistical analyses, and strat-\nified all analyses by gender First, we calculated the age-\nadjusted mean or prevalence for each individual risk factor\nas well as for the FRS in each of the four subgroups of\nsubjects: Mexican immigrants in HHANES, second gen-\neration Mexican-Americans in HHANES, Mexican immi-\nreference population for the age-adjustment was the U.S.\npopulation in the 2000 census. We then conducted three\nstatistical comparisons for each outcome: (1) immigrants\nversus second generation within HHANES, (2) immigrants\nand (3) immigrants in HHANES versus second generation\ntake the usual cross-sectional (within-survey) approach to\nassessing differences between first and second generation\nMexican-Americans. The third comparison takes a cross-\nsurvey approach and is intended to capture the true gen-\nerational change in cardiovascular risk factors, as described\nearlier.\nSecond, we estimated multivariate regression models\nwith the study outcomes as dependent variables. The main\nindependent variables of interest were indicator variables\nfor the four subgroups of subjects defined by generation\n(first versus second) and survey (HHNES versus\n65\u00ad74), education (no high school diploma, high school\ndiploma, or more than high school diploma, household\nincome relative to the federal poverty level (FPL)\n(married or living together, widowed, divorced or sepa-\nrated, or never married).\nSeveral covariates had missing values including marital\nstatus (2% missing), education (8% missing), and income\n(7% missing). We used modal substitution to impute\nmissing values for marital status. Because the percent\nmissing was somewhat higher for education and income,\nwe used a three-step procedure to impute missing values\nfor these variables. Each variable was imputed separately.\nFirst, we estimated an ordinal logistic regression model for\neach variable with sex, gender, age, martial status, and\ngeneration as independent variables. Second, for each\nindividual with missing data we generated probability cut-\npoints for each category of the variable using the regression\ncoefficients from the model. Third, we drew a random\nnumber between zero and one from a uniform distribution\nand compared it to the probability cut-points in order to\nassign each individual to one category.\nTo account for the complex study designs used in\nconducted in SUDAAN 8.0 using the recommended\nweights for each sample by NCHS [24]. This research was\nexempted from human subjects review by the UCLA\nInstitutional Review Board.\nResults\nSample Characteristics\nTable 1 shows selected sociodemographic characteristics\nof first and second generation Mexican-Americans in the\napproximately half of the subjects were female. In both\nsurveys, first generation Mexican-Americans were young-\ner, had lower levels of education, and had lower levels of\nincome than the second generation. In both surveys,\napproximately three-quarters of first and second generation\nMexican-Americans were married.\nAge-adjusted Results\nTable 2 shows the age-adjusted cross-survey and within-\nsurvey comparisons between first and second generation\nMexican-American men and women. Among men, there\nwere no differences between first and second generation\nmen in FRS, total cholesterol or diabetes rates by either\nthe cross-survey or cross-sectional methods of analysis. In\nboth the cross-survey and HHANES within-survey com-\nparisons, second generation men were less likely to\nsmoke than first generation men. In the cross-survey\ncomparison, second generation men had lower HDL\ncholesterol than first generation men. In the HHANES\nwithin-survey comparison, second generation men had\nhigher rates of hypertension than first generation men\nAmong women, there were no differences in FRS or\ndiabetes rates between the first and second generations by\neither the cross-survey or within-survey comparisons. By\nboth methods of comparison, second generation women\nhad higher HDL cholesterol than first generation women.\nIn the cross-survey comparison only, second generation\nwomen had lower total cholesterol, higher rates of hyper-\ntension, and lower rates of smoking compared to the first\ngeneration counterparts.\nMultivariate Results\nTable 3 shows the cross-survey and within-survey multi-\nvariate regression comparisons in cardiovascular risk\nbetween first and second generation men and women\ncontrolling for age, marital status, education, and income.\nResults from the multivariate comparisons were largely\nconsistent with the age-adjusted results, with the following\ncaveats. Among men, multivariate adjustment rendered the\ncross-survey comparison in the HDL cholesterol non-sig-\nnificant; the cross-survey and within-survey (NHANES\nhad been non-significant in the age-adjusted results; and\nof smoking non-significant. Among women, multivariate\nadjustment rendered both cross-survey comparisons and\nthe within-survey comparisons in HDL cholesterol non-\nsignificant.\nFirst generation\nSecond generation\nFirst generation\nSecond generation\nN (weighted %)\nGender\nAge (Years)\nMarital status\nEducation\nFamily income (PIR)\nWithin-Survey Versus Cross-survey Analyses\nThere were some noteworthy differences between the results\nobtained by the cross-survey and within-survey methods of\nanalysis, particularly in women. Application of the within-\nsurvey approach only identified a difference in HDL cho-\nlesterol between first and second generation women. In\ncontrast, application of the cross-survey approach identified\ndifferences in total cholesterol, hypertension, and smoking\nbetween first and second generation women. These findings\nsuggest that it is important to consider temporal trends in\nthe health of immigrants when evaluating generational\ndifferences.\nDiscussion\nWhether first and second generation Mexican-Americans\nwere compared using the cross-survey approach (HHANES\neration) or the within-survey approach (HHANES first\nversus second generation), significant generational differ-\nences in individual cardiovascular disease risk factors\nlevels were found. Specifically, second generation men had\na higher rate of hypertension than first generation men in\nthe cross-survey comparison and in both within-survey\ncomparisons; second generation women had a higher\nhypertension rate than first generation women, but only in\nthe cross-survey comparison; second generation men and\nwomen had lower smoking rates in the cross-survey com-\nparisons and in men, in the within-survey comparison using\nHHANES only; second generation men had a lower mean\nHDL cholesterol level in the cross-survey comparison\nwhereas second generation women had a higher mean HDL\nlevel in the cross-survey comparison and both within-sur-\nvey comparisons; and lastly, second generation women had\na lower mean total cholesterol level in the cross-survey\ncomparison.\nAs discussed in the Introduction, most previous studies of\ngenerational differences in cardiovascular disease risk fac-\ntors in Hispanics relied on cross-sectional (within-survey)\ncomparisons. However, generational differences found in\ncross-sectional data may be confounded by secular trends in\nthe health of immigrants. The optimal way to investigate\ngenerational differences in risk factor levels would be to use\nmultigenerational longitudinal data that includes immigrants\nand their children. Unfortunately, these kinds of longitudinal\nstudies of Mexican immigrants and their children are not\ncurrently available. In this study, we have addressed this\nissue by comparing first generation adults in an older data set\n(HHANES) with second generation adults in a newer data set\n(NHANES), approximating comparisons between immi-\ngrant parents and their US-born children (i.e., cross-survey\nTable 2 Age-adjusted cross-survey and within-survey comparisons in cardiovascular risk first and second generation Mexican-American men\nand women\n10-year risk of cardiovascular\nCholesterol\n(mg/dl [SE])\nHDL Cholesterol\n(mg/dl [SE])\nHTN\nDiabetes\nCurrent smokers\nMen\nWomen\nNote: The reference population for age-adjustment was the 2000 census U.S. population\na HHANES-I refers to first generation HHANES\nb HHANES-II refers to second generation HHANES\n1 Cross-survey comparison significant at the P \\ 0.05 level (HHANES first generation versus NHANES 1999\u00ad2004 second generation)\n2 Within-survey comparison significant at the P \\ 0.05 level (HHANES first generation versus HHANES second generation)\ngeneration)\napproach). In the social sciences, the technique of approxi-\nmating longitudinal data by using multiple waves of cross-\nsectional data is referred to as the pseudo-cohort approach\n[22]. Our results suggest that indeed there are important\ndifferences between the results obtained from cross-survey\n(cross-survey) and cross-sectional (within-survey) compar-\nisons; in the case of this study, particularly among women.\nSpecifically, first and second generation women differed\nwith respect to total cholesterol, hypertension and smoking\nin the cross-survey comparisons but not cross-sectional\ncomparisons. Researchers using cross-sectional data to\ninvestigate generational differences in health should be\naware of the potential for confounding due to secular trends\nin the health of immigrants and seek to check their results\nusing pseudo-cohorts when feasible.\nDespite there being differences in individual risk factor\nlevels, first and second generation Mexican-Americans had\nsimilar overall risks of developing coronary heart disease\nover a ten-year time horizon. Specifically, first and second\ngeneration men and women had statistically similar\n10-year risk of coronary heart disease as estimated by the\nFRS, whether immigrant men and women were compared\nwith their second generation counterparts using cross-sur-\nvey or within-survey comparisons. These results suggest\nthat the risk factor distributions favoring one generation\nmay have been balanced by those favoring the other,\nresulting in no net difference in near-term cardiovascular\nrisk. For example, compared to first generation women,\nsecond generation women had higher hypertension rates\nbut also lower smoking rate rates. Another possible\nexplanation for the lack of any significant generational\ndifferences in the FRS may have been the small numbers of\nolder first and second generation Mexican-Americans in\nHHANES. In HHANES, there were only 61 men and 75\nwomen that were 65 years of age and older. Had there been\ngreater numbers of older Mexican-American men and\nwomen in these studies, significant generational differences\nin risk might have been detectable.\nIn contrast to this study, previous studies have found\nthat less acculturated Hispanics have more favorable car-\ndiovascular disease risk factor profiles than more accul-\nturated Hispanics. For example, compared with US-born\nHispanics, foreign-born Hispanics have been found to have\nmore favorable levels of blood pressure, cholesterol, dia-\nbetes, body mass index, abdominal circumference, smok-\nhowever, important methodological differences between\nthis and previous studies. First, previous studies have fre-\nquently compared foreign-born Hispanics to US-born\nHispanics, not distinguishing among the multiple generations\nof US-born Hispanics. If acculturation continues across\nmultiple generations as suggested by Portes and Rumbaut\n[29], then important differences between second, third,\nfourth, and higher generations of Mexican-Americans\nTable 3 Multivariate adjusted cross-survey and within-survey comparisons in cardiovascular risk in first and second generation Mexican-\nAmerican men and women\ncardiovascular event\n(Adjusted %)\nTotal cholesterol\n(Adjusted level\n[mg/dl])\nHDL cholesterol\n(Adjusted level\n[mg/dl])\nHTN\n(Adjusted %)\nDiabetes\n(Adjusted %)\nCurrent smokers\n(Adjusted %)\nMen\nWomen\nNote: Results adjusted for age, sex, marital status, education, and income\na HHANES-I refers to first generation HHANES\nb HHANES-II refers to second generation HHANES\n1 Cross-survey comparison significant at the P \\ 0.05 level (HHANES first generation versus NHANES 1999\u00ad2004 second generation)\n2 Within-survey comparison significant at the P \\ 0.05 level (HHANES first generation versus HHANES second generation)\ngeneration)\nmay be unaccounted for in earlier studies. In contrast, this\nstudy was limited to comparisons between first and second\ngeneration individuals. Second, many previous studies pool\nHispanics together regardless of ethnic or national\nbackground. There is, however, mounting evidence that\nHispanic subgroups differ with respect to risk factors,\nmortality and many other important measures of health\nstatus [30]. To avoid the possible confounding of genera-\ntional differences by compositional differences in national\norigin, this study is limited to Mexican-Americans. Finally,\ngenerational status is not a measure for acculturation,\nthough the two measures are correlated. Generational status\nis solely determined by the birthplaces of an individual and\nof her parents. By contrast, acculturation is a multi-\ndimensional construct that is defined by factors such as\nengaging in culturally-specific behaviors (e.g., food, music\nand media); language proficiency; knowledge of culture-\nspecific history and current events; the cultural makeup of\none's social network; and one's own ethnic and cultural\nidentity [31]. Thus studies that have used measures of\nacculturation may not find the same results as this study\nthat used generation.\nAccess to care could have confounded the results of this\nstudy, particularly with respect to cholesterol levels. Con-\nceptually, access to care might influence cholesterol levels\nby leading to the receipt of cholesterol lowering drugs.\nThus individuals with better access to care might have\nlower cholesterol levels independent of their generational\nstatus. Unfortunately, HHANES does not include variables\nthat allow us to evaluate the prevalence of dyslipidemias\n(as opposed to cholesterol level). To better understand the\nrelationship between cholesterol levels and access to care,\nwe regressed cholesterol on generational status, age, and\nusual source of care (yes/no). Among women, controlling\nfor usual source of care made no difference in the results.\nAmong men, however, controlling for usual source of care\nresulted in the contrast between first and second generation\nwithin HHANES becoming insignificant. Interestingly,\nmen with a usual source of care had higher cholesterol\nsource of care, suggesting that need for care (as measured\nby cholesterol) was associated with access to care (as\nmeasured by usual source of care). The impact of the risk\nfactors in this study on future cardiovascular morbidity and\nmortality will depend upon access to health care and to\nappropriate risk reducing therapies.\nMexican-Americans are the largest and fastest growing\nsubgroup of Hispanics in the US, yet despite their demo-\ngraphic importance Mexican-American immigrants and\ntheir children remain vastly understudied groups. Because of\ntheir increasing numbers, Mexican-American immigrants\nand their children are destined to have significant impacts on\nthe US health care system. Therefore gaining a better\nunderstanding of generational changes in health and factors\nthat influence generational changes in health among Mexi-\ncan-Americans is essential. This research study takes a small\nstep towards developing a better understanding of the role of\ngenerational change and health. However, much more pop-\nulation-based research targeting Mexican-American immi-\ngrants is needed before effective interventions to maintain\nand improve health in these groups can be developed.\n"
