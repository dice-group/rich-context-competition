Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (1994\u00ad2008) and gender-based\ntheories of stress, the authors examined whether parental incarceration is associated with increased body mass\nindex among women but not men. Panel analysis spanning adolescence and adulthood, controlling for stressful life\nevents, internalizing behaviors, and a range of individual, familial, and neighborhood characteristics, reveals that\nbody mass index for women who have experienced parental incarceration is 0.49 units (P < 0.004) higher than that\nfor women whose parents have never been incarcerated. This association is not evident among men. Similarly, in\nchange score models between waves II and IV, women experiencing parental incarceration have a 0.92-unit\nincrease in body mass index (P < 0.026) relative to women who did not have a parent undergo incarceration. In\nsupplemental analysis examining if gender differences in incarceration stress response (externalizing vs. internalizing)\nexplain these findings, the authors found that obesity status moderates the relation between depression and\nparental incarceration. Results suggest a stress internalization process that, for the first time, links parental\nincarceration with obesity among women.\nbody mass index; collateral consequences of incarceration; gender and stress internalization; internalizing/\nexternalizing behaviors; parental incarceration; risk factors for obesity\nAbbreviation: BMI, body mass index.\nWith the exponential rise in the US prison population,\nparental incarceration has become an increasingly common\na parent incarcerated in state or federal prison, while nearly\n7.5 million children had a parent either incarcerated or on\nprobation or parole (1, 2). Among young adults in the United\nStates, 13% report that their biologic father has spent time\nin jail or prison, with mother/father incarceration becoming\nan increasingly common life experience, particularly for\nAfrican-American children (3, 4). Wildeman (5) estimates\nenced a father's incarceration, compared with 1 in 25 whites.\nThe racial disparities in adult incarceration are reflected among\nchildren: Black and Hispanic children are 7.5 and 2.5 times,\nrespectively, more likely to have an incarcerated parent\nthan are white children (1). With an incarceration rate that\nis 5\u00ad10 times higher than that in other industrialized nations,\nthe United States is unique in its proportion of children\nexperiencing a parent undergo incarceration (4).\nAs an increasingly common life-course event among chil-\ndren and young adults, parental incarceration has become the\nfocus of a growing body of research (6\u00ad10). Parental in-\ncarceration is linked to a number of problem behaviors and\npoor outcomes, including aggression/misbehavior in early\neducational performance/outcomes (9, 20). These associations\nresult, in part, from additional risk factors that accompany\nincarceration, including parental absence, lack of economic\nresources, family instability, and strained parental relation-\nships; consequently, parental incarceration is considered\na major and long-term stressor in the lives of children (9, 17,\n22\u00ad24). Furthermore, male and female children may dif-\nferentially express stress related to parental incarceration.\nGeneral stress research suggests that boys and men typically\nexternalize stressful life events like paternal incarceration\nthrough actions such as delinquent behavior; in contrast, girls\nand women generally internalize similar stressors through\nmechanisms such as anxiety or depression (25\u00ad27). Although\nmost studies of parental incarceration do not separately ana-\nlyze males and females (9), some findings are suggestive of\nthis pattern. Using data from the Fragile Families and Child\nWellbeing Study, Wildeman (11) found paternal incarceration\nto be associated with increased risk of aggression among\nyoung boys but with a decrease or ``protective effect'' for\naggression among young girls. In an Australian sample,\nKinner et al. (19) reported an association between paternal\nincarceration and internalizing behavior among adolescent\ngirls but no association among boys.\nThe links among stress, internalizing behaviors, and sub-\nsequent health among adolescent and adult women (28\u00ad34)\nare well established. Thus, parental incarceration may, in\nturn, also be associated with such physical health issues,\nparticularly among females, who internalize stress in lieu\nof the aggression/delinquency commonly observed among\nmen. Recent work by Jackson et al. (33) and Mezuk et al.\n(34) suggests that poor physical health behaviors may also\nact as substitutes for mental health issues such as depres-\nsion, similarly implicating obesity and other mental health\nissues as alternative adverse outcomes to aggression and\ndelinquency.\nAlthough stress theories and mental health outcomes have\nbeen studied among children of incarcerated parents (9), the\nlack of longitudinal studies examining long-term physical\nhealth outcomes, such as obesity, is notable. The internali-\nzation of stress, long-term association between parental in-\ncarceration and mental health issues reported by Murray and\nFarrington (9), and engagement in poor physical health be-\nhaviors make it a potentially highly significant issue among\nfemale children of incarcerated parents, both as an extension\nof current research on the effects of parental incarceration\nand in the context of high rates of parental incarceration\nwithin the US population. As a growing epidemic in the\nUnited States, an outcome frequently linked with internal-\nization of stress, and a precursor to major health problems\nsuch as stroke, diabetes, hypertension, and coronary heart\ndisease in later life, obesity represents a physical health mea-\nsure with significant consequences with increasing age.\nBy examining the body mass index (BMI) of respondents\nover a 12-year period that extends from adolescence into\nadulthood, we examine how parental incarceration may result\nin increases in body size over this critical developmental\nperiod. We use a comprehensive set of statistical controls\nthat are believed to mediate or confound the association\nbetween parental incarceration and BMI in a series of nested\nregression models that are designed to account for the hypoth-\nesized association. To test for robustness, we also compare\nhow changes in parental incarceration status are associated\nwith increased body mass for respondents interviewed at\nwaves II\u00adIV and, to further eliminate other sources of un-\nobserved heterogeneity, we perform a comparable analysis\non a subset of respondents reporting parental incarceration\nat some point during their lives. Finally, we explore the\nmechanism for this association by examining the influence\nof parental incarceration on changes in depressive symptoms\namong obese and nonobese women. If increased BMI is due\nto overeating as a means to cope with stress, then the in-\nfluence of this stressful life event should be notably weaker\namong obese women than among nonobese women.\nData\nWe used 4 waves of in-home data collection from the\nNational Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (hereafter\nreferred to as ``Add Health''). Information on how to obtain\nthe Add Health data files is available on the Add Health\nwebsite (http://www.cpc.unc.edu/addhealth).\nrespondents enrolled in grades 7\u00ad12 at wave I during\npleting interviews at waves II, III, and IV, respectively.\nAnswers to sensitive questions in Add Health, including\nyouth offending and arrest, were obtained by using audio-\ncomputer\u00adassisted self-interviewing (known as ``audio-CASI'')\ntechnology to increase the reliability of self-reports (35).\nFor this study, we examined 15,558 individuals who had\ncompleted interviews for all waves of the study. In our sample,\nmother or father was incarcerated, including 242 male and\n306 female respondents who reported that a parent was in-\ncarcerated between waves II and IV. Because of variation in\nBMI arising from pregnancy, we eliminated female respon-\ndents who reported being recently or currently pregnant.\nWe used multiple-imputation techniques for missing values\n(36, 37) by use of the ``ice'' procedure in Stata software (38)\nacross 50 imputed data sets to increase the reliability and\nstatistical power of imputations (39). To make use of these\nimputed data, we used the Stata add-on ``mim'' in conjunc-\ntion with regression analysis (40). To examine the reliability\nof our imputations, we compared the results presented below\nwith results from the subset of observations with no missing\ndata. Although we found that estimating the full sample\nyielded biased results, imputations that were restricted to\nthe subsample of 1) observations with no missing internalizing/\nexternalizing behaviors and 2) cases in which respondents\ncompleted interviews yielded reliable and consistent re-\nsults. In our panel analysis, we use imputations from this\nsubsample.\nBecause interactions can bias imputations (36) and to\ndemonstrate robustness of findings, we present results for\nchange models that include only cases with complete data\nfor change score models presented in Tables 1 and 2. For\nchange score models, we present results for all respondents.\nAs a robustness check for unobserved heterogeneity, we\nParental Incarceration and Increased Body Mass Index Risk 637\nalso report results for the subpopulation of respondents who\nreported that their biologic father was incarcerated prior to\nwave IV.\nKey measures\nTables 3 and 4 provide a description of constructed mea-\nsures; Table 3 also presents means and standard deviations.\nIn the following subsections, we discuss key variables used in\nthe analyses.\nBody mass index. BMI, derived from the respondent's\nweight (kg)/height (m)2, is a metric used in research as an\napproximation of a respondent's body fat. Add Health col-\nlected self-reported weight and height at wave I but inter-\nviewer-assessed weight and height at waves II\u00adIV. Although\nmeasured BMI is preferred in research, prior research exam-\nining BMI among Add Health respondents has shown that\nself-reported BMI at wave I yields results that are consistent\nwith those at later waves (41). In Table 5, we differentiate\nbetween obese and nonobese women using a standard BMI\nParental incarceration. Parental incarceration is measured\nby the respondent's retrospective reports at wave IV. Reports\nat this wave are the first to provide the age at which the\nrespondents recalled their mother and/or father being incarcer-\nated. During interviews, respondents were first asked, ``Has\nyour biological mother/father ever spent time in jail or\nprison?'' If respondents noted, ``yes,'' they were then asked,\n``How old were you when your biological mother/father\nwent to jail or prison (the first time)?'' Responses range\nfrom ``not yet born'' through ``31 years.'' Cases in which\nrespondents either refused to answer these questions or in-\ndicated no knowledge of their mother's/father's incarceration\nare coded as missing. To adjust for the various methods\nused in analysis, we coded timing of parental incarceration\nin 2 ways. To investigate parental incarceration in panels, we\nused an indicator variable to denote whether either parent had\nundergone incarceration. Alternatively, for fixed-effect models,\nwe investigated parental incarceration occurring between\nwaves II and IV. We also report results from models for panel\ndata that examine only respondents whose parents completed\nincarceration prior to wave I (these data are not shown).\nTable 1.

To\ndetermine the extent to which associations between parental\nincarceration and obesity may be explained by internalizing/\nexternalizing behaviors, stress, and unhealthy behaviors/\nlifestyles, we also added several additional measures listed\nin Table 4. In longitudinal analysis, our measures include\n1) the proportion of all stressful life events a respondent\nexperienced at each wave, 2) 4-wave measures of depression\nand suicidal thoughts to assess internalization, and 3) 4-wave\nmeasures of sedentary behavior, fast food consumption, and\nsoft drink consumption to capture maladaptive behaviors that\nmay substitute for internalization.

In\nTable 2, we present results for the main effects for parental\nincarceration and internalizing/externalizing behaviors.\nAll analyses were conducted by using Stata, version 11.1,\nstatistical software (StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas).\nRESULTS\nTable 5 contains the mean BMI by gender and parental\nincarceration status for all 4 waves of the Add Health Study.\nAs indicated in this table, the average effect of incarceration\nis 0.44 BMI units across all waves, and parental incarcera-\ntion is positively associated with higher BMI for each of the\n4 waves of the study. Importantly, the effects are evident\namong women only. At wave I, we show an average differ-\nence of ~0.75 BMI units for women who have had a parent\ngo to jail, compared with those who have not. For a woman\nweight increase. By wave IV, the average BMI difference\nis ~1.3 BMI units. For the same 170-cm woman, this trans-\nlates to a 4.1-kg increase, compared with those who have\nnot had a parent incarcerated. On average, we observed an\nunadjusted difference of 0.88 BMI units for women whose\nparents had been incarcerated compared with those whose\nparents had never been incarcerated.\nRandom-intercept models\nTable 1 presents a series of nested regression models that\nadd successive blocks of mediating variables to examine\nthe social and behavioral mechanisms that may account for\nthe patterns observed in Table 5. For parsimony, we provide\nonly the effect of parental incarceration on BMI; for full\nresults for models 1\u00ad5, refer to Web Tables 1\u00ad3, respectively,\nfor all respondents, males, and females, posted on the Journal's\nwebsite (http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/). The first 4 models\nare random-intercept models in which 4 observations are\nnested within individuals. For both the full sample and women,\nthe inclusion of basic sociodemographic controls (model 1)\nsignificantly attenuated the association observed in Table 5,\nbut parental incarceration remains a highly significant pre-\ndictor of BMI; sociodemographic factors account for roughly\n32% of the association between parental incarceration and\nBMI. Similarly, as shown in models 2\u00ad4, statistical controls\nTable 5.

After we adjusted for these\nfactors, parental incarceration was associated with a ~0.49-unit\nincrease (P < 0.004) in BMI for women (model 4). As\na robustness check, in comparing those who experienced\nparental incarceration prior to wave I with those never ex-\nperiencing parental incarceration, we found nearly identical\nresults; for example, we observed a 0.43-unit increase in\nBMI for women experiencing parental incarceration prior\nIn supplemental analyses (available on request), we also\nestimated the relation between parental incarceration and\nrespondents' meeting official classifications for obesity, using\ncomparable longitudinal models presented in models 1\u00ad4 of\nTable 1. In the baseline model, parental incarceration is\nobesity for all respondents and women, respectively; there\nis no significant association between parental incarceration\nand obesity among males.\nChange score models\nTo derive more refined estimates of the influence of paren-\ntal incarceration on BMI, we examined change in BMI from\nwave II to wave IV (in which measured BMI is available and\nprovides a large-enough window to assess change) as a func-\ntion of parental incarceration during that same period. This\nmodel includes the full set of controls, changes in the control\nvariables, and a control for BMI at wave II (model 5 of\nTable 1). According to this model, women whose parents\nwere incarcerated between waves II and IV (n \u00bc 194) saw\nBMI increases that were 0.92 units higher than those of\nwomen whose parents were not arrested during this period.\nAs a final check of robustness to rule out other sources of\nunobserved heterogeneity, we also reran model 5, comparing\nrespondents whose father was arrested during the wave II\u00adIV\nperiod with respondents whose father was arrested prior to\nwave II; the results were substantively identical (b \u00bc 1.25)\nand statistically significant (P < 0.05, 1-tailed test). In other\nwords, this association does not appear to be due to unob-\nserved characteristics that affect both the risk of parental\nincarceration and the risk of BMI.\nIn Table 2, to examine the mechanism responsible for\nthe observed association between parental incarceration\nand BMI and the notable gender differences in this associ-\nation, we considered the gendered process of internalizing\nstress by estimating the effect of parental incarceration on\nchange in depression levels from wave II to wave IV. Our\nmodels control for stressful life events and changes in them\nfrom wave II to wave IV that may confound the association\nbetween parental incarceration and mental health. The first\nmodel examines this association among men. As the gen-\ndered-internalization perspective anticipates, parental incar-\nceration does not significantly influence the mental health of\nmen (b \u00bc 0.114; not significant). However, this same model\nindicates a fairly robust and deleterious influence of parental\nincarceration on the mental health of women (b \u00bc 0.576;\nP < 0.01). Results from interaction models suggest that the\ngender difference is statistically significant (P < 0.05, one-\ntailed test). We then examined this association among women\nas a function of wave IVobesity status and showed a stronger\na nonsignificant effect among obese women (b \u00bc 0.381; not\nsignificant). That is, obesity appears to mute the mental health\nconsequences of parental incarceration for women and remains\nan alternative coping mechanism that may help to explain\nthe mechanism by which parental incarceration influences\nBMI levels for young women.\nSensitivity analyses\nTo evaluate the robustness of findings, we conducted sen-\nsitivity analysis on the models and methods used in the anal-\nyses (data not shown). For parental incarceration, we found\nno substantive variation by parent's sex (i.e., mother's and\nfather's incarceration), age of respondent (e.g., parental in-\ncarceration before age 10), or incarceration prior to wave I.\nIn alternative methods, we found that parental incarceration\nsignificantly predicted increased BMI using multilevel models\nthat controlled for school clustering and cross-sectional anal-\nysis that made use of Add Health's multistage weights. In\ninteraction models, we found that the effect of parental in-\ncarceration did not vary significantly by race/ethnicity, age, or\nparental education.\nDISCUSSION\nIn this study, we linked parental incarceration to increases\nin body mass among a national sample of American youth.\nBy controlling for a comprehensive array of stressful life\nevents, detailed information about family structure and socio-\neconomic status, father closeness, neighborhood poverty,\nrespondent low self-control, and internalizing/externalizing\nbehaviors, we are able to demonstrate a significant, in-\ndependent influence of parental incarceration on the BMI\nand obesity for young women. Additionally, our results from\nchange models support research suggesting that parental\nincarceration leads to increased BMI through internalizing/\nexternalizing behaviors. Parental incarceration is associated\nwith increased depression among women who are not obese,\nbut it is nonsignificantly associated with depression among\nall men and among women who are obese. The gender differ-\nences that we observe are in line with gender-based theories\nof internalizing/externalizing behaviors in the general health\nliterature (25\u00ad27), research linking internalization with obesity\n(28\u00ad32), and research on the effects of parental incarceration\n(11, 19). Thus, we find parental incarceration to be a risk\nfactor for increased obesity among women and a potential\nalternative to internalizing behaviors such as depression.\nGiven the gender and internalizing/externalizing dif-\nferences observed in our research, links between parental\nincarceration and long-term physical health outcomes, such\nas obesity, should be a focus of increased research. Instead\nof simply being added risk factors, obesity and elevated\nBMI are consistently observed among women who do not\ndisplay internalizing behaviors. Given the many risks as-\nsociated with parental incarceration and recent research sug-\ngesting that children of incarcerated parents suffer adversity\nin adolescence and young adulthood (17), our research\nsuggests the need to consider how individuals may differ-\nentially respond to the stresses of incarceration and related\ndisadvantages.\nWe believe that this association is particularly important\nfor African-American women, who are more likely than non-\nHispanic white women to express this internalization through\nhigh caloric intake and sedentary lifestyles (33, 34). According\nto recent estimates, the median BMI for non-Hispanic white\n0.9-unit increase in BMI for women who have had a parent\nincarcerated is equivalent to 18.4% of the existing disparity\n(4.9 BMI units). Because at least one-fourth of African-\nAmerican children entering adulthood are raised in families\nin which the father has spent time in prison (4), this stressful\nlife event may uniquely contribute to obesity disparities be-\ntween black women and white women. Similarly, given the\ncharacterization of the exponential increase in obesity among\nblack women as rooted in a stress-coping process (33, 34),\nfuture research examining how women respond to the stresses\nof parental incarceration may yield insights into racial dis-\nparities in obesity.\nSeveral limitations should be considered in the interpre-\ntation of the results of our study. First, we have fairly limited\ninformation about the specific timing of incarceration, the\nduration of incarceration, and parental criminality that may\nclarify the links between parental incarceration and BMI.\nFuture research should explore these associations as a func-\ntion of the type of crime committed, the occurrence of the\nevent within the criminal history of the parent, and the specific\ndevelopmental periods of the child's life in which a parent\nwas absent because of incarceration. Second, we emphasized\ngender differences in the association between parental in-\ncarceration and BMI, but age, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic\nstatus, religiosity, and other important sociodemographic\nfactors may also moderate the effects of stress on body mass.\nFuture research should explore these possibilities. Finally,\nwe emphasize one particular health outcome when, in fact,\nparental incarceration is linked to behavioral problems\n(11\u00ad16) and health behavior problems such as drug use\n(17, 18). An important next step would be to characterize\nthe influence of parental incarceration on the comorbidity\nof health, risky behaviors, and education (20). If parental\nincarceration affects this broad range of outcomes in unique\nyet predictable ways, then interventions should be developed\nto provide this specific at-risk population with effective\nmechanisms to reduce the deleterious health influences of\nparental incarceration.\n"
