The\nprevalence estimates of overweight and obesity generated from self-reported weight and height from BRFSS are known to\nunderestimate the true prevalence. However, whether this underestimation is consistent across different demographic groups\nhas not been fully investigated.\nMethods: In this study, we compared the prevalence estimates of obesity (body mass index (BMI) X30 kg/m2) and overweight\n(BMI X25 kg/m2) in different demographic groups in the US from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES) and BRFSS during 1999\u00ad2000. We also compared the rank orders of the obesity and overweight prevalence across\ndifferent demographic groups from the two data sources.\nResults: Compared to NHANES, BRFSS underestimated the overall prevalence of obesity and overweight by 9.5 and 5.7\npercentage points, respectively. The underestimation differed across different demographic groups: the underestimation of\nobesity and overweight prevalence was higher among women (13.1 and 12.2 percentage points, respectively) than among men\n(5.8 and \u00c00.6 percentage points, respectively). The variation of underestimation was higher among men. A clear inverse\nassociation between educational attainment and obesity prevalence among non-Hispanic African American women was\nobserved from BRFSS data. However, no such association was found from NHANES. While BRFSS can identify correctly the\npopulation with the highest obesity and overweight burden, it did not accurately rank the obesity and overweight prevalence\nacross different demographic groups.\nConclusion: Compared to NHANES, BRFSS disproportionately underestimates the prevalence of obesity and overweight across\ndifferent gender, race, age, and education subgroups.\nKeywords: overweight; BRFSS; NHANES; prevalence\nIntroduction\nObesity has reached an epidemic proportion in the United\nStates (US) and other developed countries,1,2 with significant\nhealth and economic implications.3,4 It is important to\nassess the burden of obesity by various socio-demographic\ngroups so that effective policies, programs, and interventions\ncan be better targeted at the high-risk populations. At the\nnational level, the burden of obesity can be accurately\nassessed for various subgroups because large national surveys\n(e.g., National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES)) take actual measures of the weight and height\nof the respondents. At the state level, however, only self-\nreported information on weight and height is available for\nadults through the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance\nSystem (BRFSS), and for adolescents and children through\nthe Youth Risk Behavioral Surveillance System and the Youth\nTobacco Survey.

Such studies\nwould be useful to evaluate whether BRFSS data can be used\nto rank the burden of obesity across different socio-demo-\ngraphic groups to accurately target interventions.\nThe objectives of the study are to compare the national\nestimates of overweight and obesity prevalence from\nHNANES and BRFSS across various socio-demographic\ngroups, and to evaluate the extent and consistency of\nunderestimation of overweight and obesity prevalence across\ndifferent demographic groups using BRFSS data.\nMethods\nNHANES is a series of cross-sectional, nationally representa-\ntive examination surveys conducted by the National Center\nfor Health Statistics, Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention (CDC).8 Beginning in 1999, NHANES became a\ncontinuous survey. The procedures followed to select the\nsample and conduct the interviews and examinations were\nsimilar to those for previous surveys. Since 2 or more years\nof data are necessary to have adequate sample sizes for\nsubgroup analyses, this study is based on the first 2 years of\nsectional survey of the total civilian non-institutionalized\npopulation in the US. The design was a stratified multistage\nprobability sample based on selection of counties, blocks,\nhouseholds, and persons within households. The survey\nincluded a standardized physical examination and house-\nhold interview. During physical examination, height and\nweight were measured by trained health technicians using\nstandard procedures. Height was measured with a fixed\nstadiometer. Weight was measured in kilograms, with\naccuracy to two decimal points, using an electronic-load\ncell scale. Adults wore underpants, a disposable paper gown,\npaper pants, and foam slippers. No adjustment was made for\nclothing weight (approximately 0.1\u00ad0.2 kg) in the analysis.\nIn this study, we included men and women aged 20 years\nor older with measured weight and height from NHANES\nBRFSS is a CDC-sponsored, state-based telephone survey of\nhealth risk factors.9 It is a standardized telephone survey\ncarried out by health agencies in states and the District of\nColumbia with assistance from the CDC. The primary\npurpose of the BRFSS is to provide state-specific estimates\nof the prevalence of behaviors that are associated with the\nleading causes of death in the US. Each participating state\nindependently selects for interview a probability sample\nfrom adult residents aged 18 years or older in households\nwith telephones. All states in a given year use an identical\ncore questionnaire administered over the telephone by\ntrained interviewers. During the telephone interview, re-\nspondents were asked, `About how tall are you without\nshoes?' and `About how much do you weigh without shoes?'\nfrom all states and territories to generate the national\nprevalence of overweight and obesity. We included in the\nanalysis the data for men and women aged 20 years or older\nwith self-reported weight and height.\nData analysis\nWe calculated the body mass index (BMI) as weight (in kg)\ndivided by the square of height (in m). Overweight is defined\nWe performed all statistical analyses using STATA (SE 8.2,\nStataCorp, College Station, TX, USA), and accounted for the\ncomplex survey designs in our analysis. We excluded from\nthe analysis pregnant women in both data sources (259 in\nNHANES and 3725 in BRFSS). We estimated the prevalence of\nand educational attainment. For analysis involving race,\nwe only included non-Hispanic whites and non-Hispanic\nblacks. We did not include other racial groups due to their\nsmall sample sizes in the NHANES. However, in estimating\nthe overall prevalence, we included all racial groups.\nWe calculated the prevalence differences in obesity and\noverweight between the two surveys by subtracting the\nprevalence based on BRFSS from that based on NHANES. We\ncalculated the standard errors for the prevalence differences\n[Se(Pn\nSe\u00f0Pn\n\u00c0 Pb\n\u00de \u00bc\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nVar\u00f0Pn\n\u00de \u00fe Var\u00f0Pb\n\u00de \u00c0 2Cov\u00f0Pn; Pb\n\u00de\np\n\u00bc\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nVar\u00f0Pn\n\u00de \u00fe Var\u00f0Pb\n\u00de\np\n\u00bc\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nSe\u00f0Pn\n\u00de2 \u00fe Se\u00f0Pb\nq\n;\nwhere Pn\nis the prevalence estimate from NHANES and Pb\nis\nthe prevalence estimate from BRFSS.

The NHANES\u00adBRFSS differ-\nences in obesity and overweight prevalence estimates varied\nacross gender, race, and age groups: the difference in the\nobesity prevalence estimates between NHANES and BRFSS\nwas highest among non-Hispanic black women (16.7\npercentage points), non-Hispanic white men aged 60 or\nolder (15.4 percentage points), and non-Hispanic white\nwomen (12.5 percentage points); the difference in over-\nweight prevalence was highest among non-Hispanic black\nmen aged 39 or younger (\u00c015.1 percentage points), non-\nHispanic black women (11.6 percentage points), and non-\nHispanic white women (13.4 percentage points) aged 39 or\nyounger, and non-Hispanic white women aged 60 or older\n(12.8 percentage points). The prevalence of overweight\nestimated from BRFSS was higher than that from NHANES\namong non-Hispanic black and white men aged 20\u00ad59\n(Table 2).\nThe NHANES\u00adBRFSS differences in the obesity and over-\nweight prevalence estimates varied across different educa-\ntion categories: the difference in the obesity prevalence was\nmore than 20 percentage points among black women with\na high school education and those with more than a high\nschool education, and no difference among black women\nwith less than a high school education; the difference in\noverweight prevalence was \u00c022.5 percentage points among\nnon-Hispanic black men with a high school education,\ncompared to 12.2 percentage points among white women\nwith more than a high school education (Table 3).\nNo association between education attainment and obesity\nprevalence among African American women was found in\nNHANES. However, a clear inverse association between\neducation and obesity prevalence was observed from BRFSS\ndata (Table 3). The above findings were not changed after the\nage adjustment. Additionally, no association between educa-\ntion and overweight prevalence among African American\nwomen was observed in both surveys after adjusting for age.\nAfter standardizing the NHANES-based prevalence by\neducational levels, the prevalence of obesity decreased\neducation-standardized prevalence estimates, the NHANES\u00ad\nBRFSS differences in obesity and overweight prevalence were\n9.1 and 5.4 percentage points, respectively.\nRank orders of obesity and overweight prevalence from NHANES\nThe rank orders of obesity and overweight prevalence across\ndifferent demographic groups varied depending on whether\nthey were derived from NHANES or BRFSS.

Currently, obesity-related interventions are\nimplemented at the state or sub-state level. High-quality data\nfor monitoring disease burden, tracking trends, and targeting\ninterventions are crucial for successfully planning, imple-\nmenting, and evaluating public health interventions, in-\ncluding those for obesity prevention.\nAt the state and sub-state levels, where the interventions\nare implemented, currently only self-reported data on\nweight and height for adults are available from BRFSS,\nbased on telephone interviews. BRFSS-type surveys have\nbeen shown to underestimate the true prevalence of over-\nweight and obesity.1,5\u00ad7 However, whether the underestima-\ntion is consistent across different demographic subgroups\nhas not been fully studied. Jackson et al.5 compared the\nprevalence of obesity estimated from a random-digit dialing\ntelephone interview and a random household examination\nsurvey in the Stanford Five-city Project Survey and found\nthat the telephone interview underestimated the prevalence\nof obesity by 11.2 percentage points.

For younger adults, the overweight prevalence\nestimates from the two data sources were similar.12 Nelson\net al.13 compared national estimates for height, weight, and\nBMI from BRFSS and the National Health Interview Survey\n(NHIS). Height and weight data in both BRFSS and NHIS\nare self-reported. However, BRFSS collects data through\ntelephone interviews, while NHIS collects data through\nhousehold face-to-face interviews. They found that, com-\npared with NHIS, BRFSS tended to underestimate BMI for all\ndemographic subgroups.13\nTo the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to\ninvestigate the extent and consistency of underestimation by\nthe BRFSS data of overweight and obesity prevalence across\ndifferent demographic groups in the US through comparing\nthe prevalence estimates from BRFSS and NHANES. While\nboth NHANES and BRFSS strive to collect high-quality\ndata, potential biases in overweight and obesity prevalence\nestimates could arise in both surveys. These biases may\ninclude sampling biases (e.g. sampling frame error), bias due\nto non-response, and biases due to measurements. While\nNHANES strives for demographic diversity, it was limited in\nits geographic diversity to 15 primary sampling units (PSUs)\nper year and 30 PSUs over the 2 years of the time frame of\nthis study.8 There are large variations in obesity prevalence\nbeen over-represented by the sites with higher or lower\nobesity prevalence. On the other hand, BRFSS collects data\nthrough telephone interviews. In 2000, the telephone\ncoverage in the US was approximately 95%, ranged from\n87 to 98% across states and among different socio-demo-\ngraphic groups.15 The sampling frame error could arise from\nthe variations in telephone coverage.\nThe actual amount of bias due to nonresponse depends on\ntwo factors \u00ad the response rate, and the differences between\nthe responders and the nonresponders. In NHANES 1999\u00ad\nbetween responders and nonresponders for both NHANES\nand BRFSS is not available for evaluating the potential bias\ndue to nonresponse.\nWeight and height data in NHANES were measured\nby trained technicians using standardized equipment\nfollowing a standard protocol. Therefore, the potential\nbiases due to measurements were probably small. In contrast,\nBRFSS collected self-reported weight and height data\nthrough telephone interviews. Thus, the biases due to\nmeasurements in BRFSS come from two sources: self-report-\ning and telephone interview. Research has shown that\nself-reported weight and height data were inaccurate;16,17,12\nin addition, compared to face-to-face interviews, telephone\nrespondents are more likely to misreport their weight\nThe potential sampling bias and bias due to nonresponse\nin the two surveys are reflected by the discrepancies in\nthe demographic distribution from the two surveys com-\npared with the census data. While both NHANES and\nBRFSS were weighted for age, gender, and race to compensate\nfor unequal probability of selection and nonresponse rate,\nthe weighted distributions of education and income in\nother, and both surveys differed from the US census data\nin different directions. Compared to the 2000 US census\ndata, the weighted NHANES data were over-represented\nby persons with less than a high school education and\nunder-represented by those with a high school or higher\neducation. Conversely, the weighted BRFSS data were\nover-represented by those with a high school or higher\neducation and under-represented by those with less than\na high school education. Since persons with higher\neducation tend to have a lower prevalence of obesity\nand overweight, NHANES may have overestimated, and\nBRFSS may have underestimated, the overall prevalence\nof overweight and obesity due to sampling biases and\nnonresponse. However, when we standardized the obesity\nand overweight prevalence based on NHANES by education,\nthe standardized prevalence estimates only slightly\ndecreased.\nBased on the above discussion on the potential biases in\nNAHNES and BRFSS, we believe that although NHANES\nmight slightly overestimate the prevalence overweight\nand obesity, the prevalence estimates based on NHANES\nare likely to be close to the true prevalence. Therefore, we\nused the NHANES as a standard to determine the extent and\nconsistency of underestimation of the prevalence of over-\nweight and obesity of the BRFSS-based estimates across\nvarious socio-demographic groups.\nOur study showed that BRFSS did correctly identify the\npopulation with the highest or the lowest obesity and\noverweight burden. However, compared to NHANES, BRFSS\nsubstantially underestimated the overall prevalence of\nobesity and overweight, and the underestimation differed\nacross different socio-demographic groups. Also, BRFSS\noverestimated the prevalence of overweight among non-\nHispanic black or white men aged 20\u00ad59 years. Additionally,\nunlike the BRFSS data, the NHANES data did not show\nan inverse association between educational attainment and\nobesity prevalence among African American women. This\nlack of inverse association is consistent with a study by\nMensa et al.18 Therefore, the strong inverse association\nbetween educational level and obesity prevalence among\nblack women observed in the BRFSS data appears to be\nspurious and caused by a significant under-reporting of\nthe obesity prevalence among black women with a high\nschool or higher education. These findings raised the\nquestion about the validity of using BRFSS data to evaluate\nthe obesity burden, and to rank obesity burden across\ndifferent demographic groups for targeting obesity-related\ninterventions.\nObesity prevalence estimates from NHANES and BRFSS\nS Yun et al\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nBRFSS data have long been assumed to be adequate for\ntracking trends of overweight and obesity because of the\nconsistency in the methodology. However, this assumption\nshould be re-examined given the rapid spread of the cellular\nphone market and the resulting increase in the proportion of\ncell-phone-only households,19 and the fact that cellular\nphone numbers have not been included in the BRFSS\nsampling frame. As the cell-phone-only households are\nprobably different from those with hard wire telephones,\nthe validity of using BRFSS data to track trends needs to be\nconsidered.\nSince BRFSS is administered at the state level by health\ndepartments or their subcontractors, the data quality\nmay vary among states. There may also be variations in\nweight and height reporting behaviors in different states.\nHowever, state-specific underestimation of the prevalence of\nobesity and overweight cannot be evaluated in this study,\nbecause state-specific estimates cannot be obtained from\nConclusions and recommendations\nBRFSS underestimated the overall prevalence of obesity\nby 9.5 percentage points, and the overall prevalence of\noverweight by 5.7 percentage points, for US adults aged 20\ntion differed in various demographic subgroups. Since at\nstate or sub-state levels BRFSS data are the only data source\navailable for evaluating the burden of obesity and for\nidentifying the population at higher risk in obesity-related\nprogram planning, program planners and evaluation staff\nneed to be aware of these limitations of the BRFSS data,\nespecially when comparing racial or socioeconomic sub-\ngroups. Since obesity-related interventions are priorities for\nthe states, CDC and states should work together to develop a\nmethodology to adjust obesity prevalence estimates from\nBRFSS data.\n"
