This study compares the use of the binary disease variables with counts of the same conditions in models\nof self-rated health to better understand the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. In particular, the analysis\nseeks to determine if statistical power is adequate for the binary variable approach.\nMethods. Morbidity measures from adults in 2 large national surveys were used in both cross-sectional and longitu-\ndinal analyses.\nResults. Although differences across the approaches are modest, the binary variable approach offers greater explana-\ntory power and slightly higher R2 values. Despite these advantages, statistical power is insufficient in some cases, espe-\ncially for conditions that are relatively rare and/or that manifest modest differences on the outcome variable.\nDiscussion. Statistical power estimates are advisable when using the binary variable approach, especially if the list\nof diseases and health conditions is extensive. Although a simple count of diseases may be useful in some research ap-\nplications, separate counts for serious and nonserious conditions should be more useful in many research projects while\navoiding the risk of inadequate statistical power.\nHE accurate measurement and use of morbidity infor-\nmation are critical for gerontological, epidemiologic,\nand health services research. Adulthood, especially later\nadulthood, is a time of increasing prevalence of chronic dis-\nease, and the influence of comorbidity may be quite conse-\nquential to health trajectories. Although morbidity has been\nexamined as an independent variable in thousands of stud-\nies, relatively little systematic research has considered the\nconsequences of various methods for measuring morbidity\nas an independent variable.\nVirtually all surveys that measure morbidity have a series\nof questions that query whether a person has a given disease\nor condition. Most gerontologists and health scientists using\nhealth surveys or medical records begin with the binary (in-\ndicator) variables of disease, but may use the indicators in\ndifferent ways. The decision of how to use the disease indi-\ncators is important, because it may lead to different conclu-\nsions about the effect of morbidity on a wide range of out-\ncomes, from self-rated health (Idler, 1993) to hospital\nmortality rates (Iezzoni, 1997). It could also have profound\npolicy implications. For instance, if a disease is not found to\ninfluence an outcome such as disability or mortality, there\nmay be an inclination to treat the disease less aggressively.\nA very common practice in the gerontological literature\nhas been to sum the disease indicators to form an overall\nBennett, Whitelaw, & Maeda, 1991; Liang, Lawrence, Ben-\n1991). A chief advantage of this procedure is parsimony,\nespecially when a long battery of diseases is presented to\nparticipants or when panel data are used to assess change in\ncomorbidity and other phenomena (e.g., social support). A\nsecond advantage is that this approach uses all the disease\ninformation, even that from the rare conditions. The result-\ning composite expresses comorbidity in an additive form,\nand it conveniently differentiates people at each level of\noverall morbidity.\nThe other major approach has been to use dummy vari-\nables for each illness to avoid simple sums of very different\nconditions (e.g., Crimmins & Saito, 1993; Idler & Kasl,\ndistinguish the various illnesses are less parsimonious but\nkeep the unique contribution of the conditions salient. In ad-\ndition, they permit investigators to examine how special\ncombinations of diseases may interact in affecting health-\nrelated outcomes. Fried, Bandeen-Roche, Kaser, and Gu-\nralnik (1999) recently found such interactive effects of dis-\neases on disability in the Women's Health and Aging Study.\nReports of such analyses are rare, perhaps in part because of\nthe complexity involved, but the binary variable approach is\nthe only way in which the unique contribution of a dis-\nease--or, ultimately, interactions of diseases--may be as-\ncertained. Proponents of the binary variable approach fur-\nther argue that because the correlation among the various\ndisease indicators is typically modest, summing disease in-\ndicators is akin to adding the proverbial apples and oranges\nOne concern when using the binary variable approach is\nparsimony. Although parsimony is a concern for many sur-\nveys that ask respondents questions about a \"short list\" of\ndiseases (less than 15 conditions), it is even more of a con-\ncern when the surveys have a larger battery of questions on\ndiseases. Indeed, some investigators have used factor analy-\nsis of the binary disease variables to reduce their number\nT\nto 7). The issue of parsimony is even more important when\ndisease is treated as a dependent variable.\nClosely related to, but distinct from, the issue of parsi-\nmony is statistical power (Cohen, 1988). Although power is\nan elementary statistical issue, it is not apparent that re-\nsearchers are systematically taking it into account when us-\ning the binary variable approach. The usefulness of the bi-\nnary variable approach in population samples is highly\ndependent on the distribution of the conditions or diseases\nunder investigation--what is often referred to as the base-\nrate problem in studies of accidents or rare diseases\n(Schmitt & Colligan, 1984). Statistical power for testing the\neffect of a condition on a quantitative variable is a function\nof sample size, the distribution of the condition in the sam-\nple, and the difference in means on the quantitative variable\nbetween those who do and do not have the condition. Thus,\nif conditions are rare (e.g., stroke, hip fracture), then it is\nless likely that there will be adequate statistical power for\ntesting their effects with the binary variable approach. In\nsuch cases, the possibility of \"false negatives\" is great--\ninvestigators conclude that disease x does not influence an\noutcome when, in fact, the statistical chance for it to do so is\nlow. If, instead, the investigator used the count variable ap-\nproach, at least the contribution of disease x, expressed in\nthe comorbidity term, could be estimated. It is clear that\neach approach has its advantages and disadvantages--each\nmay be appropriate for given research questions.\nAlthough there is no routine approach for all research\nproblems, there is value in systematically examining the\nconsequences of using these two approaches on the relevant\nstatistical criteria. The purpose of this article is to compare\nthese two approaches, along with two closely related ap-\nproaches, to better understand the advantages and disadvan-\ntages of each. The present research compares these proce-\ndures for measuring morbidity in both cross-sectional and\nlongitudinal analyses, with explicit attention given to statis-\ntical power, parsimony, and model fit. We use self-rated\nhealth as the outcome to illustrate how the different proce-\ndures influence findings from two large national data sets.\nThe results have direct implications for the large and grow-\ning literature on self-rated health as a global perception of\noverall health status (e.g., Idler, 1993; Jylh\u00e4, Guralnik, Fer-\nrucci, Jokela, & Heikkinen, 1998), but the aim of this analy-\nsis is to clarify the relative merits of the alternative mea-\nsures of disease information. Therefore, special attention is\ngiven to the issue of statistical power.\nMETHODS\nSamples\nData for this analysis are from two national surveys: Na-\ntional Health and Nutrition Examination Survey-I: Epide-\nmiologic Follow-up Study (NHEFS) and Health and Retire-\nment Study (HRS). These two surveys were chosen because\nthey are widely used public archives, permit longitudinal\nanalysis, and use unique strategies for collecting morbidity\ninformation on a national sample.\nThe NHEFS collected medical examination and survey\nprobability sample of noninstitutionalized persons ages 25\u00ad\n74. The analyses will be completed on the baseline NHEFS\nsubsample, designed as a nationally representative sample,\nwhich was administered the \"detailed component,\" includ-\ning an extensive medical examination (N  6,913; National\nCenter for Health Statistics, 1979). The baseline for the\nNHEFS was administered in modules. Although 14,407 re-\nspondents 25\u00ad74 years of age were given selected modules,\nrespondents in the detailed component received all modules\nincluding the health care needs and general well-being\nquestions. Sampling and operational details are provided\nelsewhere (Cornoni-Huntley, Huntley, & Feldman, 1990;\nNational Center for Health Statistics, 1987). The survey is\nlongitudinal, and the present analysis makes use of the first\nfollow-up, approximately 10 years later (due to the exten-\nsive field operations of the baseline). This analysis is based\non the 6,833 non-Hispanic White and Black respondents at\nthe baseline and 4,986 reinterviewed respondents at the first\nfollow-up.\nThe HRS is a nationally representative survey of 7,706\nhouseholds with at least one person age 51 to 61. The data\ncontain a total of 12,652 respondents (Juster & Suzman,\nfollow-up interviews have occurred every 2 years thereafter.\nThe spouses of selected respondents were interviewed for HRS,\nbut this analysis excludes the spouses who are secondary re-\nspondents. The analysis is based on the 5,637 non-Hispanic\nWhite and Black, age-eligible, primary respondents (i.e.,\nterviewed in 1994. The sample size for the longitudinal\nanalysis is 5,151 because 3 age-eligible cases, who did not\nanswer the self-reported health measure in 1994, were ex-\ncluded.\nThe surveys have different lag times between waves--10\nyears for NHEFS and 2 years for HRS. Although there\nwould be value in testing models across surveys with the\nsame time lags, effect sizes can vary as a function of the\nlength of the time lag. Thus, as recommended by Gollob\nand Reichardt (1987), there is value in using different lags\nto study the same relationship to obtain a more \"complete\nunderstanding of a variable's effect\" (p. 82).\nMeasurement\nThe measurement of self-reported morbidity in NHEFS\nwas derived from a checklist question designed to identify\nwhich illnesses respondents had. Respondents were asked,\n\"Has a doctor ever told you that you have. . .hypertension or\nhigh blood pressure?\" Overall, 36 conditions are presented.\nThe answer to such a question is not a report about how one\nfeels about a specific condition, but rather a report of a con-\ndition based on a medical encounter. Each condition was\ncoded as a binary variable (1  yes, 0  no).\nMorbidity in the HRS was measured by focusing on eight\ntarget conditions that are prevalent among adults who are\nmiddle aged or older and can lead to work disability (Wal-\nlace & Herzog, 1995). Those conditions include adults who\nhave hypertension, diabetes, cancer, chronic lung disease, heart\nproblems, psychiatric problems, arthritis, and who have had\na stroke. Each respondent was asked if he or she had ever\nbeen told by a doctor that he or she had one of these condi-\ntions. Disease-specific questions were then asked concern-\ning medical treatment and functional impairment. Seven ad-\nditional diseases and conditions were measured through a\nseries of questions in which the respondent was asked, \"Do\nyou have any of the following health problems?\" The list of\nconditions included asthma, back problems, foot and leg\nproblems, kidney or bladder problems, stomach or intestinal\nulcers, and high cholesterol. A separate question measures\nwhether the respondent had fractured a bone since he or she\nwas 45. Although the prevalence estimates derived from the\nphysician-referenced questions may be different from those\nwithout a physician referent, the focus of the present analy-\nsis is not estimating prevalence. Whereas the aim of this re-\nsearch addresses the consequences of using different forms\nof the disease indicators as independent variables, all 15\nconditions queried are used in the analyses that follow.\nMorbidity in both surveys will be treated several ways.\nThe focus of our research is comparing two approaches out-\nlined earlier:\n\u00b7 simple count of all conditions\n\u00b7 a set of dummy variables for the conditions.\nIn addition, the following procedures for measuring mor-\nbidity will be examined (the latter only with the NHEFS):\n\u00b7 separate counts of serious conditions and nonserious\n(chronic) conditions\n\u00b7 diseases categorized according to the International\nClassification of Diseases (ICD).\nFirst, for these additional analyses, separate counts of se-\nrious conditions and nonserious (chronic) conditions can be\ndeveloped from both surveys (Ferraro & Farmer, 1996,\nin consultation with a panel of physicians and nurses, is rec-\nommended for avoiding the possible power problem of the\nbinary variable approach while offering more specific and\ndescriptive measures than the simple count of conditions.\nThe serious illness conditions include: cancer, diabetes,\nheart failure (attack or trouble), hypertension, and stroke.\nThe remaining conditions, hereafter referred to as chronic\nillness, are identified in Table 1; examples include arthritis,\nasthma, bone fracture, cataracts, gout, psoriasis, and ulcer.\nAlthough beyond the scope of the present analysis, mea-\nsures of severity of illness are a more formal way to use\nmorbidity information and distinguish the seriousness of an\nillness (Gonnella, Hornbrook, & Louis, 1984; Horn & Horn,\nParmelee, Thuras, Katz, & Lawton, 1995). Most of these se-\nverity of illness measures used in previous research are\nbased on \"computerized hospital discharge abstracts. . .or\ninformation gathered from medical records by using ab-\nstraction protocols independent of specific diseases\" (Iez-\navailable in NHEFS and HRS to conduct a robust test of es-\ntablished severity measures, the use of the summed vari-\nables for serious and chronic (nonserious) conditions is a\nless formal way to unpack the simple sum of conditions.\nThe separate counts enable one to understand the unique con-\ntribution of sets of conditions that influence various health-\nrelated outcomes in distinct ways (Ferraro & Farmer, 1999).\nSecond, given the large number of specific conditions in\nNHEFS, it is possible to estimate parallel models with dis-\neases categorized according to the ICD, Eighth Revision\n(ICD-8; World Health Organization, 1967). This approach\namounts to aggregating the original disease indicators into a\nwidely recognized system of disease classification (i.e., a\nspecialized count variable approach). Fourteen ICD-8 codes\nare also used to simplify the list of 36 original variables\n(ICD uses 17, but there are no conditions in 3 categories for\nthis sample). The ICD-8 has been revised, but the 8th revi-\nsion was the most current at the time of the survey.\nTable 1 displays the list of morbidity variables available\nin the surveys and provides descriptive statistics for each.\nThe specific conditions common to both surveys are listed\nfirst, in alphabetical order, followed by those that are unique\nto NHEFS and HRS. It is clear that NHEFS queried respon-\ndents about several conditions that appeared in very small\nproportions (e.g., prevalence  1% for stroke, cataracts, de-\ntached or other retina condition, glaucoma). On the other\nhand, the more limited list employed by HRS focused on\nconditions more prevalent in the age group studied (i.e.,\nstroke was the least prevalent condition, 3%).\nSelf-rated health was measured identically in both sur-\nveys with the question, \"Would you say that your health in\ngeneral is excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?\" (Scor-\ning in this analysis ranges from 1  poor, to 5  excellent.)\nThe independent variables span a broad range of factors\nknown to be related to morbidity and self-rated health, ei-\nKrause, 1987). Although the list of covariates is not exhaus-\ntive, it includes variables that are widely acknowledged in\nthe literature: age, gender, race, living alone, education, in-\ncome, present smoker, and past smoker.\nAnalysis Plan\nThe analysis proceeds in two major stages: a comparison\nof alternative explanatory models and a statistical power\nanalysis. First, analyses comparing the alternative measures\nof morbidity in cross-sectional and longitudinal models of\nself-rated health were estimated with both ordinary least\nsquares (OLS) and logit models. The longitudinal models\nare based on residualized change procedures in which Wave\n2 self-rated health is regressed on Wave 1 self-rated health,\nthe morbidity indicators, and covariates. The longitudinal\nanalysis also accounts for selection bias due to attrition\ncal power is calculated for each disease indicator and all\ncount variables. Power is also calculated for each disease\nvariable on subsamples of the NHEFS and HRS to demon-\nstrate the importance of power calculations in both the de-\nsign and analysis of health data related to morbidity.\nFINDINGS\nComparison of Morbidity Measures\nGiven that self-rated health has five response categories,\nthere are different approaches to modeling it as an outcome\nTable 1. Descriptive Statistics for Baseline Morbidity Measures and Covariates in the National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey-I: Epidemiologic Follow-up Study (NHEFS) and the Health and Retirement Study (HRS)\nVariable NHEFS HRS\nICD codes\nSpecific conditions (dichotomous coding, 1  yes)\nTrouble with blood not clottinga 0.03\nDetached or other retina conditionsa 0.004\nHay fever or other allergiesa 0.24\nWrist, spine, or other fracturea 0.17\nEmotional, nervous, or psychiatric problemsa 0.11\nKidney or bladder problema 0.11\nStomach or intestinal ulcera 0.10\nContinued on next page\nvariable. One approach is to use OLS, treating this ordinal\nmeasure as though it were an interval measure. OLS has\nbeen shown to be quite robust with ordinal measures that\napproximate a normal distribution. This is even more likely\nwhen the number of categories of the dependent variable is\nlarge (O'Brien, 1979). A second logical approach is to use\nan ordered logit (or probit) model. As Long (1997) points\nout, when estimating an ordered logit model, one must test\nthe assumption of proportional odds across categories (i.e.,\nthat the odds ratio is constant across the categories of the\ndependent variable). The results from that test indicate that\nin both the NHEFS and HRS, the proportional odds assump-\ntion is not satisfied. (We found similar results with an or-\ndered probit--the parallel-lines assumption was not met.)\nThus, evidence indicates that ordered logit (or probit) mod-\nels are not appropriate for these data.\nIn this instance, Long suggests two alternatives: (a) esti-\nmate a multinomial logit model in which no ordering is im-\nplied across the five categories; in essence, treat self-rated\nhealth as a nominal variable and (b) collapse the five cate-\ngories of self-rated health into two, and then use a binomial\nlogit model. We followed his recommendations and completed\nthe analyses in three basic ways: (a) OLS (b) multinomial\nlogit, and (c) binomial logit with two different categoriza-\ntion schemes. (The five original categories of self-rated health\nwere grouped in two different ways: [a] excellent, very good,\nand good vs. fair and poor--yielding roughly a 50/50 split\nand [b] excellent, very good, good, and fair vs. poor--yielding\na split of approximately 78/22 in each data set.) Whereas all\nthree strategies yielded similar results, we present the OLS\nresults for the most parsimonious and straightforward pre-\nsentation. (The lengthy results from the binominal and mul-\ntinomial logit models are available from the authors upon\nrequest--the latter entail four coefficients for each variable\nin each model.)\nTable 2 presents OLS estimates for the cross-sectional\nmodels with the two data sets. Model 1 for each data set\nspecifies the simple count of conditions as the morbidity in-\ndicator along with the covariates. Model 2 specifies the sep-\narate summed variables for chronic (nonserious) and serious\nconditions for the morbidity indicators. The fit of Model 2 is\nsuperior to Model 1 in both data sets. The pattern of statisti-\ncal significance for the covariates is similar in Models 1 and\n2 for both data sets. As expected, each of the morbidity\nmeasures in Model 2 is negatively related to self-rated\nhealth, but the stronger effect in both samples is for serious\nconditions. A test of the slope difference reveals that it is\nstatistically significant in both samples (t  9.64 for\nditions are associated with poorer health ratings, but serious\nor life-threatening conditions are more consequential in\nshaping health ratings. This conclusion was evident from\nboth the OLS analyses presented and from the multinomial\nlogistic regression analyses.\nModel 3 for NHEFS uses the ICD codes to measure mor-\nbidity (there are not enough diseases questioned in the HRS\nto conduct the ICD analysis). Model 3 for NHEFS is also\nsuperior to Model 1 and provides a slightly better fit than\nModel 2. Eleven of the 14 ICD codes have significant nega-\ntive relationships with self-rated health. Model 4, for both\nthe NHEFS and HRS, specifies the effect of the individual\nbinary variables for morbidity and has the highest R2 and\nadjusted R2 values. (The improvement in model fit is statis-\ntically significant even though the R2 increase is small. The\nadjusted R2 difference between Models 1 and 4 is almost\n3% in each sample, whereas the difference between Models\n2 and 4 is about 1%, despite the increased number of vari-\nables in Model 4.) Eleven of the 35 diseases in NHEFS are\nsignificant, whereas 14 of the 15 diseases in HRS are signif-\nicant. As expected, all significant relationships for the indi-\nvidual diseases are negative; morbidity is associated with\npoorer health ratings. It is also worth noting that some of the\nchronic conditions classified as nonserious significantly re-\nduced health ratings (e.g., arthritis in both surveys, asthma\nTable 1.

A comparison of the covariates shows\nthat the values of the coefficients tend to decline across the\nmodels, however, most coefficients maintain their level of\nsignificance. There is one exception that should be noted. In\nthe cross-sectional models for the NHEFS, gender is signifi-\ncant in Model 1 but not in Models 2\u00ad4.\nTable 3 presents the parallel analyses for the longitudinal\nmodels of self-rated health across both surveys. For NHEFS,\nthis is an approximate 10-year lag, whereas for HRS the lag\nperiod is just 2 years. The simple count of conditions in\nModel 1 is again quite significant in both samples. Model 2,\nsubstituting the counts for chronic and serious conditions,\nprovides a better fit than Model 1 in both samples. As in the\ncross-sectional models, serious illness is the stronger pre-\nHRS). Chronic illness leads to a decline in health ratings,\nbut the decline is steeper for those afflicted with serious ill-\nness. Model 3 for NHEFS specifies the ICD codes as the\nmorbidity measures. This model provides a better fit than\nwere significant in the cross-sectional equations, only three\nof the 14 codes are significantly associated with change in\nhealth ratings: respiratory system, digestive system, and\nsymptoms and ill-defined conditions.\nModel 4 in both samples provides a slightly better fit than\nany of the preceding longitudinal specifications, but the dif-\nferences in adjusted R2 values are trivial (less than 1%).\nOnly 2 of the 34 individual diseases in NHEFS (hyperten-\nsion and gall stones) influenced change in self-rated health\nover time, but 8 of the 15 diseases in HRS were significant\npredictors of change in health ratings. The effects of the co-\nvariates are quite similar across the models in each data set,\nand attrition did not significantly influence the estimates of\nchange in health ratings.\nThree supplementary analyses were performed to exam-\nine more closely the relationships between the morbidity in-\ndicators and self-rated health: a nominalization test for\nthresholds, a reduced morbidity inventory with conditions\nparallel across surveys, and tests for interactions of specific\nTable 2.

These analyses are not presented in tables, but are\nbriefly summarized below. First, a nominalization test was\nperformed to identify possible thresholds or tip-points of the\neffects of comorbidity on self-rated health (Cohen & Cohen,\n1983). Beyond the effects due to the unique conditions\ntested in the binary variable approach, separate dummy\nvariables representing each level of the simple count were\ncreated to test the effects of comorbidity. In models for both\nthe NHEFS and HRS, with 0 serving as the reference group,\neach higher level was significantly and negatively associ-\nated with self-rated health. The effects were fairly linear,\nhowever. Although there does not appear to be any thresh-\nold effect in these data, investigators who favor the binary\nvariable approach may find value in estimating threshold ef-\nfects in models of other outcomes.\nSecond, whereas the number of conditions was not equiv-\nalent across the surveys, the equations were re-estimated\nwith a reduced morbidity inventory that considered only the\nconditions common to both surveys. The logic of such an\nanalysis is to make the analyses across the two surveys\nmore similar. Moreover, the results shown in Tables 2 and 3\nindicate that many of the chronic (nonserious) conditions,\nTable 3.

Although deciding which conditions to include and\nwhich to ignore is somewhat arbitrary, omitting disease in-\nformation in the morbidity count variables would lead to an\nunderestimate of comorbidity. Thus, we compared the fit\nstatistics and R2 values from the results in Tables 2 and 3 to\nparallel models that remove the conditions not found in both\nsurveys. In both the cross-sectional and longitudinal analy-\nses, the models omitting the conditions unique to each sur-\nvey provided significantly poorer fit and lower R2 values.\nFor the HRS, the model with all of the conditions included\nadded about 4% to the explained variance; the difference\nwas about 2% for the NHEFS. In general, these results show\nthe importance of including all of the available morbidity\ninformation. We conclude that longer morbidity inventories\nare worth the interview time to collect them and should be\nused in multivariate models.\nThird, given the recent work of Fried and colleagues\n(1999), several disease interaction terms were tested in the\nbinary variable approach. The following product terms were\ntested for both data sets: Heart Attack  Diabetes, Diabetes \nKidney Disorder, Cancer  Emphysema, Arthritis  Hy-\npertension, and Heart Attack  Cancer. The first one was\nsignificant in both data sets, and Arthritis  Hypertension\nwas also significant in the HRS. Thus, investigators may\nwant to consider testing for interaction terms that are theo-\nretically meaningful to the analysis, especially when using\nthe binary variable approach.\nStatistical Power\nThe analyses reported thus far for the binary variable ap-\nproach indicate which diseases are significant in predicting\nself-rated health. The presumption of such analyses is that\nthere is adequate statistical power to test such effects. That\nis, it is presumed that if a binary disease variable is nonsig-\nnificant, it is because it is inconsequential to the self-rated\nhealth of respondents in the two surveys. This presumption,\nhowever, may be inappropriate because of inadequate statis-\ntical power for selected conditions, especially the relatively\nrare ones. In this next section, we examine statistical power\nin these surveys to further consider how it may influence the\nselection of the most appropriate method for measuring\nmorbidity.\nIn Figure 1 we graphed hypothetical power calculations\nfor detecting differences in self-rated health among persons\nwith and without diabetes and hip fracture, respectively.\nThese conditions were chosen for this simulation because\nthey have different prevalence rates in the population while\nproviding different levels of self-rated health among those\nwho do and those who do not have the condition. Using the\nmean differences from the NHEFS as the population param-\neters, in the figure we plotted three hypothetical power\ndistributions of the disease. (For instance, the 5/95 split as-\nsumes 5% of the sample has the condition and 95% does\nnot.) In Figure 1 we demonstrate that statistical power is a\nfunction of (a) the difference between means (b) sample\nsize, and (c) the distribution of respondents in the sample\n(i.e., percentage split) for those who do and do not have a\nspecific condition.\nPower increases as the difference between means in-\ncreases, sample size increases, and the percentage split be-\ncomes more balanced. When the difference between the\ngroup means is large, as it is for diabetes (Figure 1A), it is\nalmost certain that differences in self-rated health will be\ndetected unless the sample size is very small and the per-\ncentage split is highly skewed. On the other hand, compar-\ning Part A of Figure 1 to Part B demonstrates that as the dif-\nferences between the means in the population become\nsmaller, it becomes increasingly difficult to detect differ-\nences in self-rated health--particularly for conditions, such\nas hip fracture, that have low prevalence rates. It is unlikely\nthat differences between respondents with and without the\nrare conditions will be detected because the percentage split\nis extremely skewed, even if a large nationally representa-\ntive sample is used.\nReturning to the comparison of morbidity measures in the\nanalyses of NHEFS and HRS presented above, it is now ap-\npropriate to ask another question: Was there sufficient sta-\ntistical power to detect differences for each of the conditions\nconsidered in the models of self-rated health? Although\nNHEFS and HRS are very large samples (over 6,800 and\n5,637 cases used in these analyses, respectively), might sta-\ntistical power be a problem in these or other large data sets\nwhen using the binary variable approach?\nIn Table 4 we provide power calculations for all individ-\nual diseases as well as for the simple count of conditions\nFigure 1. (a) Power calculations for detecting differences in self-\nrated health among respondents with and without diabetes, by per-\ncentage split and sample size (when 1\ncalculations for detecting differences in self-rated health among re-\nspondents with a hip fracture, by percentage split and sample size\nTable 4.

(Ex-\namples of the SAS code used to generate the power values\nare available from the authors upon request.)\nThe first column of Table 4 presents power for all respon-\ndents in NHEFS and HRS. Using .80 as a criterion, it may\nbe seen that power is sufficient for the summed morbidity\nvariables. However, there is insufficient power for 13 of the\n35 individual conditions that are represented in this NHEFS\nsample. Over one-third of the binary variables do not have\nsufficient power in the NHEFS data. By contrast, there is\nadequate power for all of the individual conditions mea-\nsured in the shorter disease inventory used in the HRS.\nIn the last four columns of Table 4 we present power cal-\nculations for subsamples defined by gender and race. Re-\nsearchers often use subsamples of public data sets to focus\non better understanding health processes within selected\ngroups. Or, in the case of testing for statistical interactions,\nresearchers rely de facto on power in the subsample. Thus,\nthe data shown in the last four columns of Table 4 reveal the\nimpact on power when analyses are based on subsamples or\nwhen interactions are tested by gender or race. Whereas the\nHRS contains a Black oversample, power calculations for\nHRS were completed on both the weighted and unweighted\ndata; the latter, reflecting the Black oversample, are re-\nported in Table 4.\nStatistical power is excellent for all of the summed mor-\nbidity variables in NHEFS and HRS subsamples. On the\nother hand, statistical power is insufficient in a larger num-\nber of diseases for subsample analyses in NHEFS. For ex-\nample, among the subsample of men, power is insufficient\nnon-Black, and Black subsamples the number of conditions\nof the specific conditions have sufficient power, except the\nfracture since age 45 condition in the Black subsample anal-\nyses. This was also the case with the weighted data. For all\nother conditions, results from the weighted and unweighted\n\n\u00b5\n\u00b5\n\u00ad\n----\n-\n----\n-\n+\n-------------------------\n-\n=\n\u00ad\n\u00ad\n------------------\n=\ndata were very similar and showed that statistical power is\nadequate.\nReturning to our earlier question of sufficient statistical\npower for all conditions in these data sets, one may answer\naffirmatively for HRS but not for NHEFS. In retrospect, the\nabsence of a statistically significant effect in regression\nmodels of self-rated health for many of the individual con-\nditions in NHEFS may have been due to inadequate power.\nIf a researcher were to use the binary variable approach for\nNHEFS without calculating power, he or she would con-\nclude (perhaps inappropriately) that many diseases are not\nrelated to self-rated health in cross-sectional and longitudi-\nnal analyses. In fact, it is quite possible that some of those\ndiseases influence self-rated health, but it is impossible to\ndetect such effects with the binary variable approach in\nNHEFS. The problem is worse for subsample analyses or\nwhen testing for interactions. For example, in the NHEFS, it\nwould be impossible to demonstrate that cancer affects\nhealth ratings among men.\nDISCUSSION\nFour approaches for handling disease indicators were\nconsidered here in cross-sectional and longitudinal models\nof self-rated health. In the comparison between the most\ncommon procedures--the simple count of diseases and the\nbinary variable approach--the latter provided better fitting\nmodels in cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses of both\nsurveys. (This was also the case for a multinomial logistic\nregression analysis or when dichotomizing self-rated health\nand estimating binomial logistic regression models.) The bi-\nnary variable approach is, therefore, appealing if one is will-\ning to accept a large number of independent variables\n(Johnson & Wolinsky, 1993). Parsimony is not its strength,\nbut explanatory power and model fit are its primary advan-\ntages. It is, of course, the only procedure for determining\nwhether a specific condition influences an outcome, and\neven this is not possible for some conditions when question\nwording lumps disparate diseases into one question (e.g.,\nkidney or bladder problems in HRS).\nBeyond the demand of handling a large number of inde-\npendent variables, statistical power may be the more serious\nproblem with the binary variable approach. Power is critical\nto the conclusions derived from any sampling-based study.\nIt is clear from the above power analyses that the binary\nvariable approach may lead to the conclusion that a given\ndisease is not consequential to an outcome when, in fact, the\nstatistical chance for it to do so is small. Indeed, there was\ninsufficient statistical power for more than one-third of the\n35 diseases available in the full NHEFS, and even more of\nthe diseases lacked sufficient statistical power when sub-\nsample analyses by gender and race were considered. How-\never, statistical power was not a problem for any of the vari-\nables based on the count of conditions.\nInsufficient power may also be a concern in studies that\nexamine how special combinations of diseases may interact\nin affecting health-related outcomes (i.e., interaction of dis-\neases). Fried and colleagues (1999) recently found such in-\nteractive effects of diseases on disability in the Women's\nHealth and Aging Study. Given this, we performed statisti-\ncal power calculations for several disease interactions for\nthe NHEFS and HRS data. For both data sets, power was\ncalculated for interactions of (a) heart disease and diabetes\nand (b) cancer and chronic bronchitis or emphysema. Power\nwas also estimated for the interaction of (a) diabetes and\nkidney disorder in NHEFS and (b) diabetes and kidney or\nbladder problem in HRS. There was sufficient power for all\ninteractions examined with the full sample. The only in-\nstance in which power was insufficient was for cancer and\nchronic bronchitis or emphysema in the Black subsample of\nNHEFS. In short, investigators may find it valuable to cal-\nculate power prior to specifying disease interactions, but\nthese analyses indicate that power is adequate in these data\nfor several common disease interactions.\nIt is plausible that there is no association between self-\nrated health and food allergies, hay fever, and hives, but it is\nimpossible to determine if this is so from NHEFS. It may be\nmore difficult to presume that other conditions, which did\nnot manifest an association with self-rated health (e.g., tu-\nberculosis, hepatitis, and psoriasis), are not consequential in\nshaping health ratings. Or, would one genuinely believe that\ncancer is not related to health ratings in a sample of men?\nWhether any of these conditions influence health ratings is\nan empirical question, but it cannot be answered in NHEFS\nand probably not in many other data sets because of inade-\nquate statistical power. The results of the analyses presented\nhere clearly show that investigators need to exercise caution\nwith the binary variable approach to be sure that there is ad-\nequate statistical power for the proposed tests.\nThe conditions lacking adequate power in the NHEFS\nfull sample were not measured in HRS. Instead, HRS fo-\ncused on those conditions for which the age group studied is\nknown to be at risk. Thus, the list itself is an important clue\nto the appropriateness of the different approaches. For short\nlists with prevalent conditions, the binary variable approach\nmay be preferred in large samples. For longer lists including\nrelatively rare conditions, caution should be exercised with\nthe binary variable approach--even with large samples.\nStated differently, the greater the specificity in the morbid-\nity listing, the greater the likelihood of a base-rate problem\nfor some conditions, resulting in insufficient power (Schmitt\nIn models of self-rated health with the HRS, investigators\nmay proceed with the binary variable approach, but should\nstill exercise caution if testing interactions or estimating ef-\nfects on other subsamples. It remains to be seen if the binary\nvariable approach is equally appropriate with other out-\ncomes in HRS or in other data sets.\nICD codes were considered as one alternative to the long\nlist of NHEFS conditions. Models based on ICD codes pos-\nsessed better fit than those with the simple count of condi-\ntions in both cross-sectional and longitudinal models. This\nfact and the widespread use of ICD codes in health services\nresearch make them an attractive option. The raw ICD\ncodes are very specific nominal variables that may be useful\nfor some investigations, but most researchers aggregate\nwithin bodily systems. As used here, ICD codes were\ntreated as counts that measure the number of conditions\nwithin each ICD category. This approach classifies condi-\ntions of related pathology and preserves variation in mor-\nbidity within bodily systems, but alternative uses of ICD\ncodes may be appropriate in some investigations (Schwartz,\nIezzoni, Moskowitz, Ash, & Sawitz, 1996).\nThe other procedure examined for measuring morbidity\nwas based on separate counts of serious and chronic (nonse-\nrious) conditions. In cross-sectional and longitudinal analy-\nses for both data sets, models using these variables provided\na better fit than did those with the simple count of condi-\ntions, and power was always sufficient.\nIt is possible that one might use elements of more than\none of the approaches articulated above. For instance, on\nsome outcomes, it may be useful to consider a count of\nchronic conditions, but separate binary variables for serious\nillnesses (Ferraro & Kelley-Moore, in press). This approach\nwould be less parsimonious than the two variables for seri-\nous and chronic illness, but more parsimonious than the bi-\nnary variable approach. One would still need to be attentive\nto the adequacy of statistical power for the binary variables\nconsidered and to possible threshold effects for the count\nvariable, but this strategy may be optimal for certain re-\nsearch questions. Indeed, a number of studies follow such a\nstrategy by focusing on the contribution of a single disease\nto an outcome while using the other diseases as adjustments\n(e.g., Parmelee et al., 1995). The conclusions from the\npresent analyses extend to that case as well: Test for the ad-\nequacy of statistical power on the binary variables. If there\nis insufficient statistical power for a single disease indicator,\nthe use of count variables preserves the comorbidity infor-\nmation of the respondent for the analysis. It may be antici-\npated that the binary variable approach will yield more de-\ntailed and slightly better fitting models, but the need for\nparsimony may make count variables more appropriate for\ncertain research questions.\nMeasures of severity of illness represent another promis-\ning approach to assess the impact of morbidity on health\nwhile distinguishing the more serious illnesses (Gonnella et\nBradbury, Estabrook, & Young, 1993). Although different\nseverity of illness measures have been advanced, most rely\non hospital discharge abstracts or information from medical\nrecords. An alternative is to ask respondents to distinguish\nthe most serious conditions. Regardless of the procedures\ninvolved, most severity of illness measures would avoid the\nproblem of statistical power and, we suspect, provide better\nfitting and insightful models than simple counts of disease.\nAccurate estimates of the prevalence of morbidity across\nthe life course and assessments of how morbidity shapes\nquality of life, health service use, and mortality are depen-\ndent on how morbidity is measured. Although the differ-\nences in explained variance across the approaches are not\nlarge in these analyses, the lowest R2 values (and poorest fit)\nwere routinely observed for the simple count of conditions.\nThe simple count may be useful in some research applica-\ntions (Liang et al., 1990), but moving to separate counts for\nserious and nonserious (chronic) conditions should be more\nuseful in many research projects while avoiding the risk of\ninadequate statistical power associated with the binary vari-\nable approach. If parsimony is not a major concern, then the\nbinary variable approach may be preferred. We urge investi-\ngators, however, to test for statistical power when using the\nbinary variable approach before concluding that rare condi-\ntions do not affect the outcome. Failure to perform such\npower tests may lead to an underestimate of the role of se-\nlected diseases on health and longevity. It could be very\nmisleading for gerontologists to conclude that selected dis-\neases do not influence health-related quality of life, espe-\ncially among frail elders, when inadequate statistical power\nis responsible for the false-negative result. Finally, we urge\nclinicians and policy officials to temper conclusions about\nthe lack of effects due to selected diseases in reported stud-\nies unless tests for statistical power have been performed.\n"
