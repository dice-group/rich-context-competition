This review focuses attention\non the disease burden associated with hepatitis C virus\n(HCV) infection. The term, \"disease burden,\" encom-\npasses several aspects of the impact of a disease on the\nhealth of a population, ranging from the frequency of the\ndisease, as measured by incidence and prevalence, to its\neffect on (1) longevity, such as mortality rate and years of\nlife lost because of premature death; (2) morbidity, in-\ncluding impairment in health status and quality of life as\nwell as the need for health care; and (3) finance, including\ndirect health care expenditures and indirect costs related\nto lost income from premature death or disability.\nPrevalence and Incidence of HCV\nDisease frequency may be measured either by the pool\nof existing cases or by the occurrence of new cases. The\nformer (prevalence) describes the proportion of the pop-\nulation that has the disease in question at a specific point\nin time, whereas the latter (incidence) describes the fre-\nquency of occurrence of new cases during a defined time\nperiod.\nPrevalence. The most widely quoted data on the\nprevalence of HCV in the United States are derived from\nthe third National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey (NHANES), a national survey of a representative\nsample of noninstitutionalized civilian Americans con-\nfor HCV, 380 (1.8%) carried antibodies against the virus,\nof whom 280 (74%) had detectable viral RNA in their\nserum.

Men were 20% more likely to have\nhepatitis C than women.\nAlthough these data may be representative of demo-\ngraphic variability in the general population, socioeco-\nnomic characteristics may also influence the prevalence of\nHCV infection. In surveys of emergency medical techni-\ncians undertaken in various parts of the country, the se-\nroprevalence of HCV was found to range between 1.3%\nand 3.2%, comparable to that of the NHANES sample.2\nOn the other hand, a survey conducted at a Veterans\nAffairs outpatient clinic showed that 18% of those\nscreened (n  1,032) had antibody to hepatitis C virus,3\nwhile in another Veterans Affairs study conducted among\ncross-sectional survey of prison inmates in California\n(n  977) were positive for HCV at the time of entry.5\nThese are undoubtedly high prevalence rates, but they are\ncomparable to reports from other parts of the world.6\nIncidence. Hepatitis C virus is a reportable infectious\ndisease in the United States, and the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention has put mechanisms in place to\ncapture incident cases of HCV infection. These include\npassive surveillance programs such as the National Noti-\nfiable Disease Surveillance System and hepatitis-specific\nactive surveillance programs such as the Sentinel Counties\nStudy of Acute Viral Hepatitis. Despite these efforts, the\nincidence of new HCV infection is very difficult to esti-\nmate accurately. This is because many patients with acute\nHCV infection are asymptomatic and thus do not present\nthemselves for diagnosis. Under-reporting by health care\nproviders of diagnosed cases is also thought to be com-\nmon. Furthermore, individuals at high risk of infection\nmay not have ready access to health care, decreasing the\nlikelihood of timely diagnosis of newly acquired HCV\ninfection. Because of these limitations, enumerating re-\nported cases of acute hepatitis C significantly underesti-\nmates the true incidence of hepatitis C infection.7\nGiven these caveats, the Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention has undertaken mathematical modeling\nstudies to estimate the past incidence of HCV. The model\nindicated that the annual incidence of acute HCV infec-\ntion in the United States decreased from an average of\nsons with transfusion-associated HCV infection de-\ncreased significantly following the introduction in 1985\nof guidelines for selecting safer blood donors. It declined\nfurther with the institution of screening of blood donors\nfor antibody to hepatitis C virus beginning in 1989 with\nthe first generation test and the second-generation assay\nintroduced in July 1992. In addition, safer needle-using\npractices among injection drug users facilitated by human\nimmunodeficiency virus prevention programs are also\nthought to have decreased the incidence of HCV infec-\nIt may be expected that the reduction in incident cases\nwill eventually lead to a decrease in the prevalence of\nHCV infection. Indeed, a report based on blood donors\nfrom 5 U.S. blood centers indicates that the prevalence of\nHCV infection may already be on a decline.9 Between\nblood donors were tested, the prevalence of HCV infec-\ntion over the course of this period decreased from 0.6% to\n0.4% (P  .01). Among the same blood donors, the prev-\nalence of hepatitis B virus infection over the study period\nremained unchanged at 0.2%. The anticipated reduction\nin the prevalence has been corroborated by a report from\nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention which\nprojected that, following a peak in the mid-1990s at\nslightly above 2.0%, prevalence of HCV infection would\nAlthough the incidence of HCV infection may be de-\ncreasing, the prevalence of liver disease caused by HCV is\non the rise. This is because there is a significant lag, often\n20 years or longer, between the onset of infection and\nclinical manifestation of liver disease. The Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention projects a 4-fold increase\nin the number of persons with long-standing (20 years or\nis uncertain whether the projected decline in the HCV\nprevalence based on NHANES data (non-institutional-\nized civilians) will translate to a similar decline in other\npopulation groups known to have very high prevalences\nof HCV infection, such as active injection drug users and\nprison inmates.\nFig. 1. Age- and race-specific prevalence of antibody to hepatitis C\nvirus. (Data from NHANES.1) In all racial groups, people between 30 and\n49 years of age had the highest prevalence. Conversely, in all age\ngroups, people of non-white race had the highest prevalence.\nMortality From HCV Infection\nMortality statistics in the United States are based on\nthe \"underlying cause of death\" listed on death certifi-\ncates. Deaths attributable to viral hepatitis result pri-\nmarily from chronic liver disease and liver failure. Con-\nsequently, viral hepatitis may not necessarily be listed as\nthe underlying cause of death. Therefore, it is likely that\nthe death certificate designation may underestimate the\ntrue incidence of deaths related to viral hepatitis. Further,\nuntil 1999, when the International Classification of Dis-\nease version 10 (ICD-10) began to be used to classify\ncauses of death, hepatitis C was not given an independent\ncode, making it difficult to estimate the total number of\ndeaths attributable to HCV infection.\nWith these caveats in mind, Fig. 2 describes the num-\nber of deaths and the age-adjusted death rate classified as\ndeath from viral hepatitis (non-A, non-B) between 1982\ndeaths.11 There was a corresponding increase in the age-\npersons per year. Based on data from 1999, the first year\nhepatitis C was reported separately, the majority (77%;\nn  3,759) of these deaths were caused by HCV infec-\ntion. Comparing the deaths in the non-HCV portion of\nthe 1999 data with all viral hepatitis deaths in the early\n1980s suggests that the increase in deaths since the late\n1980s may be entirely because of hepatitis C.\nTo estimate the degree of under-reporting of HCV\ninfection as the underlying cause of death in the mortality\ndata, the number of in-hospital deaths from liver disease\nrelated to hepatitis C was abstracted from the Healthcare\nUtilization Project database. In 1998 there were an esti-\nmated 4,500 in-hospital deaths in the United States from\nliver disease related to HCV infection.\nMorbidity and Health Care Cost From\nHCV Infection\nBecause chronic hepatitis C has a prolonged natural\nhistory, and only a relative minority of those affected re-\nquire on-going medical care for their hepatitis, it is diffi-\ncult to estimate the magnitude of morbidity at the\npopulation level. Patients with advanced stages of liver\ndisease may present with portal hypertension and hepatic\ndecompensation, as manifested by ascites, hepatic en-\ncephalopathy, or gastrointestinal bleeding. These compli-\ncations generally necessitate inpatient care that may\ninclude liver transplantation. Thus, data on patients re-\nferred for and undergoing orthotopic liver transplanta-\ntion for end-stage liver disease or hepatocellular\ncarcinoma reflect the most severe degree of morbidity\nassociated with hepatitis C.\nIn Table 1, the number of liver transplants performed\nfor recipients with and without HCV infection is shown\nincrease in the number of orthotopic liver transplantation\nrecipients with hepatitis C. The proportion of recipients\nwith HCV infection increased from 12% to 37%. There\nwas a similar increase in the number and proportion of\nliver transplant candidates with hepatitis C registered on\nthe waiting list (Table 2). The United Network for Organ\nwith hepatitis C awaiting a cadaveric liver transplanta-\ntion.\nThe frequency of inpatient care of HCV-related liver\ndisease has been estimated based on data derived from the\nNationwide Inpatient Sample of the Healthcare Utiliza-\ntion Project.12 This database represents a 20% stratified\nsample from all non-federal, acute-care hospitals, which\nFig. 2.

Hepa-\ntitis C-specific mortality was first reported in 1999, the latest year that\nmortality statistics were available at the time.\nTable 1. Number of Transplants With and Without HCV Infection in the U.S.\nData from the United Network for Organ Sharing.\naccount for approximately 95% of all hospitalizations in\nthe nation. Because liver disease from hepatitis C may not\nbe the main reason for all hospitalizations with a hepatitis\nC diagnosis, hospitalizations were divided into 3 groups.\nThese included hospitalizations in which liver disease\nfrom hepatitis C was the primary reason for hospitaliza-\ntion, those in which liver disease from hepatitis C was a\nsecondary reason, and those in which neither hepatitis C\nnor liver disease was a primary reason for the hospitaliza-\ntion.\nThe number of hospitalizations in these categories is\nshown in Fig. 3. During the 1990s there was a several-fold\nincrease in the total number of hospitalizations in which\nHCV was listed in the discharge diagnosis. In 1998, an\naccounting for approximately 2% of all discharges in the\ndatabase. Because of the uncertainty of ascertainment of\nHCV in the early 1990s, hospitalizations for other\nchronic hepatitis (non-A, non-B) were also captured.\nSome of the increase over time was because of the lack\nof ascertainment of HCV infection in the early 1990s,\nbecause there was a partially corresponding decrease in the\nnon-A, non-B hepatitis hospitalizations during the same\nperiod. Figure 3 also shows the total charges associated\nwith these hospitalizations (1998 U.S. dollars). Hospital-\nizations were weighted differently according to the hospi-\ntalization category, including 80% of charges for primary\nhospitalizations for hepatitis C, 50% for secondary hos-\npitalizations, and 20% of the remainder. The estimated\ntotal hospital charges for 1998 were in excess of $1 billion.\nPopulation-based data on the morbidity in individuals\nwith hepatitis C not requiring hospitalization care are not\navailable at the present time. Health status and quality of\nlife have largely been measured in patients seen at referral\ncenters or participating in randomized trials.13-15 These\nstudies have uniformly shown a significant decrement in\nthe subjective health and quality of life in patients with\nhepatitis C, although the effect of frequently co-existing\nmorbidities such as chemical dependence or depression is\ndifficult to assess separately.16 Although persons aware of\nthe diagnosis of chronic hepatitis C scored lower on qual-\nity-of-life scales than did uninfected persons, it is uncer-\ntain how much of this decrement is because of the HCV\ninfection itself or to the awareness of this condition.17\nA cost-of-illness study conducted by the American\nGastroenterological Association estimated that there were\nphysician services was projected to be $24 million. Dur-\ning the same year, $530 million was spent for the antiviral\ntreatment of HCV.\nFuture Research Needs\nThere is an ongoing, critical need for up-to-date and\naccurate information on the prevalence, incidence, health\ncare costs, mortality, and morbidity of hepatitis C\u00adrelated\nillnesses in the United States. In formulating health care\npolicies to prioritize health interventions and research and\nto allocate resources accordingly, accurate information\nabout the current and future burden of disease is essential.\nChronic HCV infection is common, affecting nearly 2%\nof the general population and a much higher percentage\nof people under special circumstances, such as the home-\nless and incarcerated. Although the incidence of HCV\ninfection appears to have decreased, national statistics in-\ndicate that morbidity, mortality, and health care utiliza-\ntion associated with consequences of long-standing\ninfection with hepatitis C have increased since the early\nFocused studies on the incidence and prevalence of\nHCV infection and liver disease in specific populations at\nrisk are needed. While population surveys provide an ac-\ncurate estimate of the prevalence of HCV infection, a\nsignificant gap exists between the sero-epidemiologic data\nand burden of HCV-related liver disease at the popula-\ntion level. This is in part because of the long period be-\ntween HCV infection and clinically significant liver\nFig. 3. Hospital discharges with HCV-related diagnosis. (Data from\nHealthcare Utilization Project.) Discharges were divided into 3 groups,\nnamely those in which hepatitis C was the primary reason for the\nhospitalization, those in which hepatitis C was a secondary (contributing)\ndiagnosis, and those in which hepatitis C was mentioned without a\ndiagnosis indicative of liver disease. Figures above the bars represent\nTable 2. Number of Patients Registered to Liver Transplant\nWaiting List With and Without HCV Infection\ndisease, as well as our incomplete understanding of the\nnatural history of HCV infection at the population level.\nMost investigations about the extent and natural history\nof liver disease associated with hepatitis C have been con-\nducted at academic tertiary centers based on patients re-\nferred with established disease. By contrast, the majority\nof the projected 3 million Americans infected with HCV\nhave not been diagnosed, and their liver disease status\nremains unknown. Studies about liver disease in people\nwith HCV infection in the population at large are neces-\nsary to fill this gap in our knowledge. Moreover, system-\natic epidemiologic studies focused on patients not\nrepresented in population-based surveys (e.g., homeless\nand incarcerated) are needed.\nFinally, continuing studies of hepatitis C in patients\nwith other comorbidities are needed. A significant pro-\nportion of HCV-infected patients have a number of co-\nmorbid conditions, including poly-substance abuse (e.g.,\nalcohol) and mental disorders (e.g., depression and anxi-\nety disorders). It is uncertain the extent to which the mor-\nbidity present in people infected with HCV is purely\nattributable to HCV infection. Determining the extent of\nthe contribution of extraneous comorbidity is important,\nbecause in people with comorbid conditions, antiviral\ntherapy alone is unlikely to be successful in improving the\nhealth of the individual. Comprehensive yet cost-effective\nstrategies to incorporate treatment for hepatitis C in the\nmanagement of patients with substance use remain to be\ndefined.\nReferences\n1.
