Moreover,\nbesides the beneficial effects associated with probiotic\nadministration, there could be several adverse events,\nincluding potentially life-threatening conditions such as\nsepsis, because of immunosuppression in cancer patients\nundergoing chemotherapy. As many as 50% or more of\npatients with cancer take vitamins, herbal preparations, and\nother supplements, including probiotics, without medical\nguidance.3,4 Availability without prescription restriction,\nlow cost, and simple oral administration allow cancer\npatients to use probiotics without knowledge of the poten-\ntial risk. Because of this fact, the safety of probiotic use in\nimmunocompromised cancer patients has become a very\nimportant issue these days.\nProbiotics are live microorganisms, which as drugs or\nfood supplements help maintain a healthful beneficial micro-\nbial balance in the digestive tract of a human or other host.5,6\nThe human gastrointestinal tract harbors a complex commu-\nnity containing more than 100 trillion microbial cells, which\ninfluence human physiology, nutrition, and metabolism.\nIntestinal bacteria play a role in vitamin B and vitamin K\nsynthesis, as well as metabolizing bile acids, sterols, and\nxenobiotics. Moreover, commensal bacteria have the poten-\ntial to activate the immune system. Stimulatory signals pro-\nvided by microflora together with the epithelial barrier\nsystem provides the first line of defense against pathogens.7\nRecently, extensive research on the influence of gut micro-\nbiota on human health and disease points in the direction of\nintestinal flora modification in the prevention and treatment\nof gastrointestinal disorders.8 Huge progress in high-\nthroughput sequencing technologies leading to phylogenetic\nassignment of 16S rRNA sequences from gut or stool sam-\nples as well as parallel recent developments in nongenomic\ntechniques is rapidly increasing our knowledge of the resi-\nMultiple indications for probiotics include gastrointes-\ntinal disorders, prevention and treatment of infectious\nand antibiotic-induced diarrhea,11 and treatment of liver\ninsufficiency,12 lactose intolerance,13 inflammatory\nbowel disease,14 and irritable bowel syndrome.15 The main\nuse of probiotics in cancer care is in the treatment of intes-\ntinal toxicity during both chemotherapy and radiation.\nClinical studies showed fewer episodes of high-grade\ndiarrhea and less abdominal discomfort in cancer patients\nreceiving probiotic strains when undergoing chemother-\neffects of a serious nature have been reported after probi-\notic consumption in generally healthy people.20 However,\nsome case reports have identified probiotic strains used in\ntherapy to be involved with sepsis. At least 8 cases of\nLactobacillus bacteremia21-26 and 9 cases of overt sepsis\nassociated with Saccharomyces boulardii (cerevisiae),\nLactobacillus GG, Bacillus subtilis, Bifidobacterium\nbreve, or combination probiotics have been reported.27-33\nMoreover, S cerevisiae fungemia has been described in\nimmunosuppressed (19 patients [31%]) and critically ill\npatients (28 [46%]), indicating that probiotics should be\ncarefully used, particularly in patients with weakened\nCurrently, there is lack of data regarding the exact prev-\nalence of probiotic use in cancer patients in the literature.\nBefore starting probiotic use, each cancer patient should\ndiscuss the potential risks/benefits of use, according to\nevidence-based medicine, with the oncologist or pharma-\ncist, taking into account current immune status. However,\nit is estimated that 38% to 60% of patients with cancer do\nnot inform their doctor, pharmacist, or nurse about taking\nnutritional supplements.1 An open market for probiotics is\nexpanding worldwide despite little research on consumer\ncharacteristics. Here, we present a survey of probiotic use\nand the association with patient tumor characteristics in\ncancer patients treated at the outpatient department of the\nNational Cancer Institute in Slovakia.\nPatients and Methods\nIn this survey, cancer patients undergoing treatment in the\noutpatient department hospitalized at the National Cancer\nInstitute between March and December 2014 were included.\nAll patients were required to provide written informed con-\nsent before enrollment and were asked to evaluate their\noverall experience with probiotic use during the course of\ntheir disease. The relevant data were collected by special\nquestionnaire filled out by a pharmacist based on individual\ninterview with patients. Questionnaire forms included ques-\ntions about probiotic brand name, the initial source of infor-\nmation about the possibility of probiotic use, the length and\nmethod of use relative to anticancer therapy, expectations,\nside-effect experiences, and any changes detected after pro-\nbiotic use. The study protocol was reviewed and approved\nby the Ethical Committee of the National Cancer Institute\nof Bratislava, Slovakia.\nStatistics\nPatient characteristics were summarized and tabulated\nusing the mean or median (range) for continuous variables\nand frequency (percentage) for categorical variables.\nAnalyses of association between probiotic use and patients/\ntumor characteristics were performed using a t-test for con-\ntinuous variables, whereas Fisher's exact test or the 2 test\nwhen appropriate was used for categorical variables. All\nreported P values were 2 sided. For all statistical analyses,\na P value <.05 was considered as significant. Statistical\nanalyses were performed using NCSS 2007 software (J\nResults\nPatient Characteristics\nIn total, 499 patients were included in the presented survey.\n(2.6% together with radiotherapy), and 8.4% had no antican-\ncer therapy.

In the\ngroup of patients using probiotics, other supplements were\ntaken by 57%, whereas among non\u00adprobiotic users, 33.9%\nused other supplements.\nDiscussion\nIn this survey, we aimed to point out the importance of the\nissue of probiotic use in cancer patients. Compared with the\naverage population, cancer patients more often use vita-\nmins, minerals, herbs, and other supplements, including\nprobiotics.35 Patients' decision to use complementary or\nalternative medicine and dietary supplements, including\nprobiotics, depends on the severity of their disease and\nexperiences of side effects associated with the anticancer\ntreatment they received. Supplementation may also provide\na sense of control or of being actively involved in treatment.\nSome patients viewed probiotics as alternatives to pharma-\nceutical drugs and understood probiotics as a more natural,\nlow-risk therapeutic option.36 Recent experimental studies\nhave suggested possible antitumor effects of probiotics\nmediated by their anti-inflammatory effects, especially in\nAs presented here, the prevalence of probiotic use in a\ncohort of 499 Slovak cancer patients undergoing chemo-\ntherapy was recorded as 28.5%. From the clinical point of\nview, an important finding was that 86.6% of patients\ndeclared no knowledge about the potential risks associated\nwith probiotics. More than half of the patients reported con-\nsidering probiotic intake based on recommendation either\nThe safety of probiotic use in cancer patients has recently\nbecome a very important issue these days, and the lack of\ndiscussion between the physician and the patient raises seri-\nous questions. To ensure optimal patient care, oncologists\nshould take into account research findings and adequately\ndiscuss all complementary approaches with their patients.\nAn active approach accompanied by knowledgeable expla-\nnations of potential risk might help in the prevention of\nadverse effects, such as the development of septic condi-\ntions resulting from the reduced capability for microbial\nclearance in immunocompromised or critically ill patients.\nSeveral cases of Lactobacillus bacteremia and fungemia\nhave so far been reported in cancer patients.40,41 On the\nother hand, our previous study did not show any safety\nissues regarding septicemia caused by a probiotic strain in\nneutropenic patients42; but outside of a clinical study, there\nis no room for using probiotics.\nMore female than male patients had used probiotics dur-\ning the course of their disease in this survey (72.5% vs\n27.5%; P < .023). This is in accord with other studies show-\ning that women, younger patients, and patients with higher\nsocioeconomic status more often use complementary and\nalternative medicine.1 Patients with gastrointestinal tumors\nTable 3.

More than 40% of them experienced diarrhea, but\nwe cannot exclude the fact that its primary cause might\nhave been anticancer treatment and not probiotic intake.\nOther negative effects such as allergy, weight gain, flatu-\nlence, candidiasis, obstipation, and rashes were only occa-\nsionally observed.\nAs we have shown, there is a high percentage of patients\nreaching for probiotics and other dietary supplements when\nundergoing chemotherapy treatment. Damage to natural\nprotective barriers resulting from the frequent use of che-\nmotherapy, radiation therapy, and especially antibiotics fre-\nquently leads to disruption of gut microbial balance\nfollowed by mucositis and diarrhea. Reduction of side\neffects associated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy\nrepresents the main interest in the use of probiotics as an\nadjunctive therapy to anticancer treatment. Experimental\nstudies and some clinical studies suggest that lactic acid\nbacteria might also have beneficial effects on the toxicity\nThe prevalence of intake of other dietary supplements in\nour cohort was 40.5%, showing that more cancer patients\npreferred to use vitamins or herbs than probiotics (28.5%).\nOur data showed that probiotic-using patients are more\nlikely to take other dietary supplements than non\u00adprobiotic-\nusing patients (57% vs 33.9%, respectively). The preva-\nlence of supplement use in healthy individuals and cancer\npatients has grown rapidly.47 Because supplements often\ncontain a mixture of biologically active chemical com-\npounds, many health risks might be associated with their\nuse. In addition, most dietary supplements have been tested\nonly in nonclinical studies, and there are insufficient data on\nthe safety and efficacy from clinical trials in humans.\nTherefore, reliable communication between the treating\nphysician, and patients and their families about the use of\nnutritional supplements and herbal products is necessary to\nevaluate the possible interactions prior to the surgical treat-\nment as well as during chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The\npatient should be informed about the inappropriateness of\nusing complementary products and probiotics, the use of\nwhich could lead to interaction with the conventionally\nused treatment or cause potentially life-threatening condi-\ntions such as sepsis because of immunosuppression.\nThe survey presented here aimed to map the prevalence\nof probiotic use in cancer patients and find any correlation\nwith patient characteristics. However, its major limitation is\nthe fact that data apply mostly to outpatients undergoing\nchemotherapy, and we cannot state the situation in patients\ntreated only with radiation therapy. Moreover, only a lim-\nited number of cancer patients not currently undergoing\ntreatment were included in this survey. Probiotics are clas-\nsified as dietary supplements, and their quality should be\nevaluated based on viability of the bacteria, bacterial types,\nand enteric protection of the product if it includes bacteria\nincapable of passage through stomach acid. The lack of\ninformation about quality and dosage of probiotic bacteria\nand subjective lifestyle and diet that might interact with\nprobiotics might cause a bias in estimation of the positive/\nnegative effects of probiotics in outpatients. However, this\nsurvey did not aim to assess the impact of probiotics taken\nwhile undergoing cancer treatment on the improvement of\npatients' health status. For this purpose, further studies and\nclinical trials need to be performed.\nIn conclusion, in this prospective study, we present for\nthe first time data about the prevalence, side-effect experi-\nences, and characteristics that most likely influence probi-\notic use in cancer patients. Our results have shown\ndifferences in probiotic use related to age, gender, cancer\ntype, and decision to take other dietary supplements.\nAccording to our data, minimal knowledge of potential\nrisk in this patient group underlined the importance of\nadequate communication between oncologists and patients\nas the key to forming a safe alliance between conventional\nand complementary medicine. However, the currently\navailable literature is not well equipped to answer ques-\ntions on the safety and efficacy of probiotics in cancer\npatients treated with chemotherapy or radiation therapy.\nMore research and especially well-designed clinical trials\nwould give the physicians relevant data for evidence-\nbased medicine.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This\npublication is the result of the implementation of a project funded\nthe collection, analysis, or interpretation of data; in the writing of\nthe manuscript; or in the decision to submit the manuscript for\npublication.\nReferences\n1.
