However, in the USA there are\nsubstantial differences in mortality by educational\nattainment, and in Costa Rica there are only minor\ndifferences. This contrast motivates an examination of\nbehavioural and biological correlates underlying this\ndifference.\nMethods The authors used data on adults aged 60 and\nabove from the Costa Rican Longevity and Healthy\nAgeing Study (CRELES) (n\u00bc2827) and from the US\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES) (n\u00bc5607) to analyse the cross-sectional\nassociation between educational level and the following\nrisk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD): ever\nsmoked, current smoker, sedentary, high saturated fat,\nhigh carbohydrates, high calorie diet, obesity, severe\nobesity, large waist circumference, HDL cholesterol, LDL\ncholesterol, triglycerides, hemoglobin A1c, fasting glucose,\nC-reactive protein, systolic blood pressure and BMI.\nResults There were significantly fewer hazardous levels\nof risk biomarkers at higher levels of education for more\nthan half (10 out of 17) of the risk factors in the USA, but\nfor less than a third of the outcomes in Costa Rica (five\nConclusions These results are consistent with the\ncontext-specific nature of educational differences in risk\nfactors for CVD and with a non-uniform nature of\nassociation of CVD risk factors with education within\ncountries.

While there are\nhigher rates of mortality among children of\nmothers with less than a primary school educa-\ntion,5 there are relatively minor associations\nbetween mortality and education in Costa Ricans\nage 60 and above.6 While education differentials in\nmortality are generally smaller at older ages,7 recent\nanalysis in the USA of similar aged individuals\nreveal substantial differentials by education, with\nmortalities 5e6% higher per year for each year less\nof education.8\nCosta Rica is a case of particular interest because\nof its historic emphasis on progressive social and\nhealth sector programmes. The country began\ninvesting in female education in the late 19th\ncentury, abolished the army in the mid-20th\ncentury, invested heavily in public health initiatives\nsuch as clean water, has strongly promoted primary\ncare initiatives in its medical sector and adopted\nnational health insurance in the 1970s. Costa Rica's\nhigh overall life expectancy (higher even than the\nUSA) has been linked to its social investments,9 but\nuntil the recent Costa Rican Longevity and Healthy\nAgeing Study (CRELES), few data have been\navailable to understand why there is a lack of social\nclass differences in older adult mortality in Costa\nRica.\nThere have been several hypotheses for\nexplaining the aggregated general associations of\nadult mortality and education. One of these is the\ntheory of social conditions as fundamental causes\nof disease.10 11 This theory posits that socio-\neconomic resources, for example, as measured by\neducational attainment, affect multiple risk factors\nfor diseases. This is posited to occur through the\nability of people to use resources to avoid multiple\ncauses of riskdand implies some similarity of the\nassociation of education with multiple pathways to\ndisease outcomes. Other theories involve the\nprimacy of factors including technical progress in\nmedical care,12 13 the importance of time prefer-\nWithin each of these proposed drivers of socio-\neconomic heterogeneity in mortality, proponents\ngenerally do not focus on particular pathways but\nimply more general effects on disease processes. An\nalternative explanation of the mortality education\nassociation is that a more complex pattern of the\nassociation of education and biological pathways\nexists. The associations may not be of a uniform\nmagnitude or even direction. These different asso-\nciations between education and risk factors may\ninstead combine to create the educational differ-\nences observed for mortality. Whether data are\nmore consistent with either of these potential\nexplanations has important implications for poli-\ncies to decrease the link between lower levels of\neducation and higher rates of mortality.\nWe focus here on risk factors for cardiovascular\ndisease (CVD) because (1) a substantial part of the\neducation disparities in mortality in the USA is\nand over in Costa Rica are due to cardiovascular\n< Supplementary tables are\npublished online only.

Our choice of\nrisk factors was guided by the published guidelines of the\nAmerican Heart Association,23 the American College of Cardi-\ntogether explain the majority of CVD risk,23 27 and there are no\nsubstantial variations between countries in the risk factors\npredicting CVD.28 While many of these risk factors are corre-\nlated, we include each of these risks separately because of\npotentially different associations with education. Exposures over\nthe life course may affect levels of certain biological risk\nmarkers,29e32 in addition to current behaviours.33 Thus, while\nour analysis of behavioural risk factors focuses on current\nassessment of exposures, the biomarkers and anthropometric\nmeasures should be interpreted as the cumulative result of\nexposures over the lifespan.34\nMETHODS\nSamples\nData from Costa Rica are from the Costa Rican Longevity and\nHealthy Ageing Study (CRELES), a nationally representative,\nprobabilistic sample of adults aged 60 and over (from a popula-\nmen, n\u00bc1498 women) with oversampling of the oldest old\ncompleted a survey in their household between November 2004\nand September 2006 which is the basis of the analytical sample.\nThis subsample had the following non-response rates: 19% of\nindividuals were deceased by the contact date, 18% could not be\nfound, 2% had moved, and 4% rejected the interview. Among\nthose interviewed, 95% provided a fasting blood sample.\nData from the USA are from the National Health and\nwomen). These cross-sectional data are representative of the\nnon-institutionalised population of the USA. NHANES follows\na four-stage sampling procedure where the primary sampling\nunits are counties, within which city blocks are selected. Within\nthese blocks, households are then randomly selected, and then\nindividuals are drawn at random from designated ageerace/\nethnicityesex subdomains.36\nThis research was approved by Human Subject committees\nat Universidad de Costa Rica and University of California,\nBerkeley.\nDemographic, health-related behaviours and dietary measures\nOur primary exposure of interest is attained level of formal\neducation. Since the absolute level of educational attainment has\ndifferent social and economic meaning in each country, it does\nnot make sense to use the same categories of education. For\nCosta Rica, educational attainment was categorised into three\ngroups: less than 3 years of education, 3e6 years of education\n(elementary school comprises six grades), and at least 1 year of\nhigh school. For the USA, we use the educational categories of\nless than high school, high school or greater than high school.\nWe performed sensitivity analyses with Costa Rican educational\ncategories of none, 1e5 years of education (some primary) and\n6 years or more (completed primary), and findings were gener-\nally similar (results shown in supplemental data tables S1 and\nIn both NHANES and CRELES, ever smoked was assessed by\nthe question `Have you smoked more than 100 cigarettes or\ncigars in your life?' and current smoking was assessed by the\nquestion `Do you smoke now?' In CRELES, sedentary behaviour\nwas defined as participants responding `no' to the question `In\nthe last 12 months, did you exercise regularly or do other\nphysical rigorous activities like sports, jogging, dancing or heavy\nwork, three times a week?' In NHANES, sedentary behaviour\nwas assessed by whether individuals reported physical activity\nfewer than 13 times in the last 30 days, and answered `No' to\nthe question of `you do heavy work or carry heavy loads' as an\naverage level of physical activity each day.\nCRELES collected dietary data using a modified version of\na food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ) that was developed and\nvalidated specifically to assess nutrient intake among the Costa\nRican adult population.37 38 Dietary averages in NHANES were\nbased on calculations from two 24 h dietary recalls.39 Standard\ncut points associated with differential risk of cardiovascular\ndisease were used to create dichotomous variables as follows:\nhigh-saturated-fat diet (>40 g per day), high-carbohydrate diet\nAnthropometric and biomarker outcomes\nFor anthropometric measures, we examine BMI (as continuous),\nobese (BMI >30), severely obese (BMI >40) and large waist\n(>102 cm among men, >88 cm among women). In both studies,\nheight and weight were measured, and waist circumference was\nmeasured at the midaxillary line.\nThe seven biomarkers examined were high-density-lipoprotein\ncholesterol (HDL cholesterol), low-density-lipoprotein choles-\nterol (LDL cholesterol), triglycerides, glycosylated hemoglobin\n(hemoglobin A1c), fasting glucose, systolic blood pressure and\nC-reactive protein (CRP). All biomarkers were measured using\nsimilar methods in both countries. Sitting systolic blood pres-\nsure was measured twice in CRELES40 and up to four times n\nNHANES.41 When multiple blood pressure readings were taken,\nthe first reading was excluded from the average (if only two\nmeasures were taken, the second reading was used).41\nStatistical analysis\nAll analyses accounted for oversampling and clustered sampling\nusing the survey package in STATA 10 (StataCorp, Texas, USA).\nSampling weights and clustering were at the PSU level (n\u00bc49) in\nNHANES and at the health area level in CRELES (n\u00bc60).\nContinuous outcomes were analysed using linear regression, and\ndichotomous outcomes were analysed using logistic regression,\ncontrolling for age and age squared. Because there were statis-\ntically significant interactions between education and gender for\na number of outcomes in both countries (data not shown,\navailable upon request), all analyses are presented stratified by\ngender. In NHANES, analyses of blood glucose, LDL cholesterol\nand triglycerides were examined only in the randomly assigned\nRESULTS\nTable 1 shows the distribution of demographic characteristics,\nhealth behaviours, dietary averages, anthropometric measures\nand prevalent health conditions in CRELES and NHANES by\ngender.\nAmong health behaviours related to cardiovascular disease\nmortality, Costa Rica has a lower percentage of current smokers\nResearch report\namong women. The USA has a much higher percentage of\nwomen who had ever smoked. Men and women in the USA\nwere more likely to be obese, to be severely obese and to have\na larger waist circumference, with higher proportions of each\namong women than among men in both countries. In the USA,\nthere were lower levels of hypertension, higher levels of hyper-\ncholesterolaemia and lower levels of diabetes (among women).\nFigure 1 shows a comparison (NHANESdsolid lines;\nCRELESddashed lines) of the population distribution of eight\nbiological risk markers for CVD. All median differences shown\nare statistically significantly different at the a\u00bc0.05 level except\nfor LDL cholesterol. Costa Ricans show substantially higher\ntriglycerides and systolic blood pressure and substantially lower\nBMI. The overall distribution of these biological risk factors are\ngenerally similar between NHANES and CRELES, with the\nexception of an upwardly shifted distribution of systolic blood\npressure in CRELES, and a higher right-hand tail of BMI distri-\nbution in the USA.\nFigure 2 presents ORs of smoking, physical activity, diet and\nanthropometric measures by educational attainment, control-\nling for age, age-squared and stratified by gender. The ORs can be\ninterpreted as the ratio of the odds of the outcome in either the\nmiddle or highest education category as compared with the\nlowest education category. In Costa Rica, there was a higher\nproportion of individuals with a high saturated-fat diet among\nthe most educated. Among Costa Rican men, the most educated\nwere more likely to be obese and more likely to have a large\nwaist circumference. Among women, there was a lower proba-\nbility of lifetime smoking and being sedentary among the more\neducated and a higher probability of having a high calorie diet. In\nthe USA, more educated individuals were significantly less likely\nto be sedentary. Among men in the USA, more educated were\nless likely to be current smokers, less likely to be lifetime\nsmokers but more likely to have a high-carbohydrate and high-\ncalorie diet. Among women, more educated women were less\nlikely to be obese and have a large waist circumference.\nFigure 3 shows differences in levels of eight biological risk\nfactors for CVD by educational attainment, controlling for age,\nage-squared and stratified by gender. The plotted betas from\nlinear regression models can be interpreted as absolute differ-\nences in the level of the biomarker among those in the middle or\nhighest educational categories as compared with the lowest\neducation category. In Costa Rica, higher educational attain-\nment is associated with lower levels of LDL among men, and\nlower levels of hemoglobin A1c and systolic blood pressure in\nwomen. Among men in the USA, there are higher levels of\ntriglycerides among men in the middle education category and\nlower levels of hemoglobin A1c. Among women in the USA,\namong the more educated there were higher (lower risk) levels of\nHDL cholesterol, lower levels of hemoglobin A1c, lower levels of\nfasting glucose, lower levels of C-reactive protein and lower\nlevels of BMI.\nThus, overall, there were significantly fewer hazardous levels\nof risk biomarkers at higher levels of education for more than\nhalf (10 out of 17) of the risk factor outcomes in the USA. This\nwas true for less than a third of the outcomes in Costa Rica (five\nTable 1 Demographic and health-related characteristics of Costa Rica (Costa Rican Longevity and\nHealthy Ageing Study) and the USA (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) (column\nproportions)\nCosta Rica USA\nMen Women Men Women\nDemographic\nAge\nEducation (Costa Rica/USA)\nAt least 1 year high school/>high\nschool\nHealth behaviours\nDiet\nAnthropometric\nPrevalent health conditions\nResearch report\nout of 17). In Costa Rica, higher levels of education were asso-\nciated with higher risk levels for approximately one-quarter\n(four out of 17) of the risk factor outcomes, while this was the\ncase for three out of 17 risk factors in the USA.\nDISCUSSION\nWe found that there was not a uniform lack of education\ndifferentials of risk factors in Costa Rica nor a universal presence\nof education differentials in risk factors in the USA. Instead, we\nfound education differentials in the USA driven by lower levels\nof current smoking, lifetime smoking, sedentary behaviour and\nhemoglobin A1c among more educated men and lower levels\nof sedentary behaviour, obesity, large waist circumference,\nhemoglobin A1c, fasting glucose, C-reactive protein, BMI and\nhigher HDL cholesterol among more educated women. In Costa\nRica, some important risk factors (eg, smoking, higher systolic\nblood pressure and sedentary) are more prevalent among the less\neducated, but other important risk factors such as obesity\n(among men) or overall high calorie and saturated fat diets\n(among women) are more prevalent among those with less\neducation. This combination of risk factors may on balance act\nto create the observed educationemortality differences between\nthese two countries. The differential importance of education\ndepended on country context. Among the 17 gender-stratified\noutcomes examined, the only similarly statistically significant\neducation differentials we observed were for sedentary behav-\niour and hemoglobin A1c among women. These observations are\nnot consistent with universal effects associated with educational\nattainment. In addition, at least in each of these two countries,\nthere is little evidence for universal associations between\neducation and risk factors for CVD.\nThere are several limitations to this descriptive study.\nMultiple risk factors may interact,24 and the clustering of risk\nfactors may be different in each country. While there may be\nother biological pathways with different education associations\nthat we do not examine, known risk factors explain the majority\nof absolute levels of CVD as well as socio-economic differ-\nUSA are the reason for the differences in the association of\neducation with risk factors, as we repeated our analysis using\nonly the non-Hispanic white population of the USA, and results\ndid not change substantively (data not shown). We also repeated\nour analysis with alternative educational categories in Costa\nRica, which did not meaningfully change our overall findings\n(shown in supplemental data, tables S1 and S2). The time\neconomic differences are not changing rapidly enough for this to\ninfluence our comparison.44 Data from Costa Rica were available\nonly for individuals age 60 and above, so inference should not be\nmade outside this age range. Results depend on our measure of\nsocio-economic position, with education more likely to capture\nearly life exposures.45 46 Finally, measures of sedentary behaviour\nand dietary intake differed between surveys, so these compari-\nsons should be interpreted with some caution.\nSome prior work has also sought to understand international\ndifferences in risk factors underlying CVD.2 47 In contrast with\nour results, education differences in CVD risk factors in\na younger population (age 40e70) in the USA and England\nqualitatively reveal similar education differences for dichotom-\nised measures of HbA1c, blood pressure, C-reactive protein,\nfibrinogen and HDL cholesterol, current smoking, ever smoking\nDensity\nDensity\nDensity\nDensity\nDensity\nDensity\nDensity\nA HDL Cholesterol (mg/dl) B LDL Cholesterol (mg/dl) C Trigycerides (mg/dl) D hemoglobin A1c\nE Fasting Glucose (mg/dl) F\nSystolic Blood Pressure\n(mm Hg) G C-reactive protein (mg/dl) H Body Mass Index (kg/m2)\nDensity\nFigure 1 Distribution of cardiovascular disease biomarkers in Costa Rica (Costa Rican Longevity and Healthy Ageing Study, dashed lines) and the\nUSA (NHANES, solid lines), men and women, aged >60.

Our findings are consistent with the\nlatter. This is less consistent with any one factor having a\nmajority influence on educational differences in mortality.\nNevertheless, a number of theories may still be relevant, but\nbased on our findings, the effects may be specific to particular\npathways. While this complexity may be daunting for efforts\nto reduce education disparities in mortality, a lack of universal\nassociations with education also implies potentially more\ntractable approaches of focussing prevention and treatment on\nthe specific risk factors most responsible for differences in\ndisparities.\n"
