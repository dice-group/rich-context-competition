One\nindividual's actions may affect the evolutionary fitness of another individual. Sexually\nantagonistic coevolution occurs when one partner's behavior decreases the fitness of the\nother partner (Rice, 1996). This conflict pressures the other partner to counter these\nMatthew L. Riggs, Department of Psychology, California State University\u00adSan Bernardino, San Bernardino,\nResistance to mate guarding scale in women\ndisadvantageous actions. Within romantic relationships, mate guarding is one potential area\nin which sexually antagonistic coevolution may drive men's and women's behavior. Mate\nguarding is a mate retention tactic aimed at keeping a partner from cheating and may\nreduce mate choice, especially for extra pair mates. Therefore, some individuals may resist\ntheir partner's mate guarding tactics. We sought to develop a resistance to mate guarding\nscale and assess the reliability and validity of the scale.\nMate guarding\nAccording to Buss (2002), mate guarding entails three main strategies: maintaining\naccess to one's mate, eliminating potential competitors, and preventing a mate from exiting\nthe relationship. One way to think about mate guarding is that it is the behavioral\nmanifestation of sexual jealousy; it includes behaviors aimed at controlling a partner's\nbehavior, such as monopolizing a partner's time, intimidating a partner and potential sexual\ncompetitors, and being vigilant about a partner's whereabouts. Mate guarding includes\ndirectly guarding a partner from rivals along with threats or aggression towards these rivals.\nBecause only males face paternity uncertainty, most studies of mate guarding (including\nthose in other species) assume males mate guard their female mates and not vice versa\n(e.g., Birkhead, Johnson, and Nettleship, 1985; but for an exception, see Wilson and\nAlthough there is evidence to suggest that male mate guarding does, in fact, occur\nthat men respond to the fitness payoffs by mate guarding some women all the time and\nother women mostly at high fertility (Haselton and Gangestad, 2006), there is little\nevidence pertaining to whether women resist their partner's mate guarding attempts, but\nthere is evidence that female crustaceans do, in fact, resist mate guarding (Cothran, 2008).\nGiven the potential evolutionary implications of reduced mate choice, one could argue that\nat least some women should resist mate guarding by their male partners.\nVery little research exists linking men's mate guarding to women's resistance to\nmate guarding. However, one study showed that resistance to mate guarding was highest\nfor women who cheated on their partner. Interestingly, for women who cheated, resistance\nwas highest when their partners had higher digit ratios, a marker of reduced prenatal\nmasculinization (Cousins, Fug\u00e8re, and Franklin, 2009). Since prenatal testosterone\nexposure appears to be related to being threatening and physically aggressive toward a\nmate (Cousins et al., 2009), women face costs to resisting their partner's mate guarding\nand, therefore, they may resist mate guarding only when the risk of retaliation by their\npartner is low.\nControlling partners and resistance to mate guarding\nResearch indicates that individuals who are more controlling are more violent\ntoward their romantic partners (Graham-Kevan and Archer, 2005). Other research shows\nthat proprietary behavior, which is similar to mate guarding, is linked with physical\naggression toward a romantic partner, but for men only (Cousins and Gangestad, 2007).\nSince there appears to be a link between mate guarding and resistance to mate guarding, we\nexpect that women with controlling partners may resist their partner's mate guarding\nattempts more than women with less controlling partners. In addition, women themselves\nResistance to mate guarding scale in women\nmay be controlling in their relationships, and these women may show more resistance to\nmate guarding than women with lower levels of controlling behaviors.\nRelationship investment and resistance to mate guarding\nRecent research on dyadic interactions of romantic partners showed that with\nincreased investment, couples were more committed (Macher, 2013). Since women's\nresistance to mate guarding appears to be at least partly explained by whether they cheated\non their mate (Cousins et al., 2009), one might expect that resistance to mate guarding will\nbe higher when women are less invested in their relationships.\nIntimacy and resistance to mate guarding\nIntimacy in romantic relationships is associated with relationship satisfaction. In\nresearch assessing intimacy and conflict across a 10-day time span, researchers found that\nintimacy was related to positive affect and that changes in intimacy were a better predictor\nof positive affect than just the level of intimacy (Laurenceau, Troy, and Carver, 2005).\nThese researchers also found that conflict, in particular a change to higher levels of\nconflict, is related to more relationship anxiety. Since mate guarding--and women's\nresistance to mate guarding--may cause relationship conflict, one might expect that when\nthere is less intimacy, there will be more resistance to mate guarding.\nAttachment style and resistance to mate guarding\nThose who have an avoidant attachment style fear intimacy and, therefore,\nfrequently avoid closeness in relationships (Hazan and Shaver, 1987). Avoidantly attached\nindividuals are more likely to cheat on a mate and to be less committed to their relationship\n(DeWall et al., 2011). Avoidant individuals may be particularly likely to resist the mate\nguarding efforts of their mate.\nIndividuals who have anxious attachment styles fear losing their romantic partners.\nThis fear may cause them to become very jealous in relationships (Hazan and Shaver,\n1987) and to potentially act in ways that are very controlling and, ultimately, destructive to\ntheir relationship (Downey and Feldman, 1996). Although it may seem counter to keeping\ntheir relationship intact, anxiously attached individuals may engage in activities that are\ndetrimental to their relationship (Downey and Feldman, 1996); one such tactic may be to\nmate guard their partner. However, it is unclear whether anxiously attached individuals\nshould resist mate guarding or actually seek it out (as it may indicate a partner is paying\nattention). Therefore, analyses between women's resistance to mate guarding and anxious\nattachment are exploratory in nature.\nSociosexual orientation and resistance to mate guarding\nSociosexual Orientation (SOI) is the extent to which an individual is comfortable\nhaving uncommitted sex (Simpson and Gangestad, 1991). Individuals who are unrestricted\nfeel more comfortable having sex outside of a committed relationship. According to one\nstudy, women's self-reported SOI predicted increased use of some mate retention tactics by\ntheir male partners, including inducing jealousy in a mate, being verbally possessive,\nthreatening rivals, and being physically aggressive toward rivals (Kardum, Hudek-\nKnezevi, and Gracanin, 2006). These behaviors are all related to mate guarding.\nUnrestricted individuals are also more likely to report cheating in a relationship (Feldman\nResistance to mate guarding scale in women\nand Cauffman, 1999). Therefore, we expect that unrestricted SOI will be related to higher\nlevels of resistance to mate guarding.\nHypotheses related to the validity of the resistance to mate guarding scale\nIn recent years, evolutionary psychologists have begun studying the genetic\nconflicts of interest that occur in dyadic interactions. Conflicts of interest occur when the\nbest strategy for one partner does not match the best strategy for the other partner (Trivers,\n1972). In order to move forward in understanding the benefits and drawbacks of men's\nmate guarding, as well as women's strategies toward a partner who uses mate guarding, it\nis important to have a measure of women's resistance to mate guarding. No instruments\ncurrently exist to measure resistance to mate guarding. The goal of the current study was to\nassess the reliability and validity of a newly developed Resistance to Mate Guarding Scale.\nThe following hypotheses were tested:\n1. Women with partners who mate guard more often will resist the mate guarding\nattempts of their partners more.\n2. Women who say their partners are more controlling will show more resistance to\nmate guarding.\n3. Women who self-report that they are more controlling will show more resistance\nto mate guarding than women with lower levels of controlling behaviors.\n4. Individuals who show higher levels of resistance to mate guarding will show less\ninvestment in their relationships.\n5. Individuals with higher levels of resistance to mate guarding will report less\nintimacy in their romantic relationships.\n6. Resistance to mate guarding will be positively correlated with avoidant\nattachment styles. Analyses with anxious attachment are exploratory.\n7. Individuals who show higher levels of resistance to mate guarding will have a\nmore unrestricted sociosexual orientation.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\nHeterosexual women were recruited both online (n = 976) and through a small,\npublic liberal arts university (n = 93) for a study about conflict in romantic relationships (N\n= 1069). Some of the students from our university participated in the online version, but\nmost of the participants from the online sample were recruited from outside of the\nuniversity. Participants had a mean age of 21.88 years (SD = 6.37). Sixty-seven percent\nwere Caucasian, 11.5% were African American, 8.6% were Hispanic, 8.8% were from\nother racial or ethnic backgrounds, and 3.9% did not respond. Of the women in the sample,\n34% were single, 50.3% were dating someone, 4.2% were engaged, 8% were married, and\n3.5% did not answer the question. For those in a current romantic relationship, the average\nlength of their relationship was more than two years (M = 27.57 months, SD = 41.42). The\nmedian relationship length was 16 months, indicating that most of the participants were\ncurrently in relatively long term, stable relationships.\nResistance to mate guarding scale in women\nMeasures\nParticipants were asked to think about their current relationship or their last\nrelationship (if they were not currently involved) while they completed a variety of\nquestionnaires. The following measures were used:\nMate guarding. The Mate Guarding Scale consists of 48 items that assess how\nfrequently women's partners have used a variety of mate guarding tactics (Cousins, 2003).\nSome items were drawn from the Mate Retention Tactics Scale (Buss, 1988), but we also\ngenerated original items (see Cousins, 2003 for more details about the development of the\nMate Guarding Scale). For example, we included the items Buss (1988) categorized as\n\"direct guarding\" (p. 298). Direct guarding consisted of vigilance, mate concealment, and\ntime monopolization. We also considered the tactics of punishing a mate's threat of\ninfidelity, intrasexual threats, and intrasexual violence to be part of the repertoire of mate\nguarding tactics. We did not include some other aspects from the Mate Retention Tactics\nScale in our measure of mate guarding--for instance, changing appearance to keep a mate\nParticipants were asked to rate how often their partner \"used social networks to\nshow other people that they were in a relationship\" and how frequently their partner\nconfronted someone making a pass at them. The scale ranges from 0 (never) to 4 (very\noften) where higher scores indicate more mate guarding. The participants also completed\nthe same questionnaire with regard to their own mate guarding behaviors. Cronbach's\nalphas were extremely reliable at .95 for women's self-ratings and .96 for their rating of\ntheir partner's mate guarding.\nResistance to Mate Guarding Scale. To determine whether women resist mate\nguarding by their partner, we developed a measure to assess resistance to mate guarding.\nFurther details regarding scale development are described below. Women reported how\nfrequently they used a variety of tactics to resist mate guarding attempts by their partner.\nThe measure consists of 34 items rated on a 5-point scale (0 = \"never,\" 4 = \"very often\")\nwhere higher scores indicate more resistance to mate guarding. Sample items include: \"I\navoided situations where I knew my partner might be able to check up on me\" and \"I\nstopped talking to other men because it caused too much conflict in our relationship.\"\nRelationship investment. Relationship investment was measured using the Partner\nSpecific Investment Inventory (Ellis, 1998). It includes 52 items such as \"I make and\ndiscuss plans for our future\" and \"I desert my partner at parties.\" Higher scores indicate\nhigher levels of investment in the relationship and questions tap into various types of\ninvestment, including being nurturing, oriented toward the future, spending time together,\nand being socially attentive. We calculated a mean Relationship Investment score for all 52\nitems. Cronbach's alpha for the overall Partner Specific Investment Inventory was .97 (see\nEllis [1998] for a more detailed discussion of reliability and validity for this scale).\nControlling Behavior Scale. This scale measures five different types of control,\nincluding economic control (\"I controlled my partner's money\"), threatening control (\"I\nthreatened to harm my partner\"), intimidating control (\"I tried to make my partner do\nthings my partner didn't want to\"), emotional control (\"I told my partner he was going\nmad\"), and isolating control (\"I checked up on my partner's movements\") (Graham-Kevan\nand Archer, 2005). Twenty-four items were rated from 0 (never) to 4 (always). Participants\ncompleted both self-reports of controlling behavior as well as reporting on the degree of\ncontrolling behaviors by their partner. A mean score was calculated for all the items in the\nResistance to mate guarding scale in women\nscale. Cronbach's alphas were highly reliable at .94 for self-report and .96 for partner-\nreport.\nIntimacy Scale. The Intimacy Scale measures intimacy within close relationships\nand includes various aspects of intimacy such as emotional closeness, respect, and\nsolidarity (Walker and Thompson, 1983). This is a 17-item measure with a 7-point Likert\nscale (0 = \"never,\" 6 = \"always\") where higher scores indicate great levels of intimacy.\nSample items include: \"I feel like we are a unit\" and \"We respect each other.\" We\ncalculated a mean score for intimacy. Cronbach's alpha was .97.\nThe Experiences in Close Relationships-Revised Questionnaire. This scale\nmeasures how comfortable individuals are getting close to others (attachment avoidance)\nand how secure they are in relationships (attachment anxiety) (Fraley, Waller, and Brennan,\n2000). Each subscale had 18 items measured on a 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree)\nLikert scale, with higher scores indicating a greater degree of avoidance and anxiety in\nrelationships. Cronbach's alphas were excellent at .94 for both the anxiety and avoidance\nsubscales.\nSociosexual Orientation Inventory. To assess how comfortable women were\nengaging in uncommitted sex, we used the Sociosexual Orientation Inventory (SOI;\nSimpson and Gangestad, 1991). This scale consists of seven items, including questions\nasking participants how many partners they had sexual intercourse with in the past year,\nhow frequently they fantasized about someone other than their primary partner, how many\npartners they had sexual intercourse with on only one occasion, and their attitudes toward\nuncommitted sex. SOI scores were calculated as described in Simpson and Gangestad\n(1991). Higher scores indicate a more unrestricted sociosexual orientation (i.e., they were\nmore comfortable having uncommitted sex). Cronbach's alpha was .83 (Simpson and\nProcedure\nWe used the Mate Guarding Scale (Cousins, 2003) to generate ideas about how men\nmate guard women. We then generated various strategies women might use to resist their\npartner's mate guarding attempts. For instance, one item from the Mate Guarding Scale\nwas, \"My partner confronted someone he thought was hitting on me.\" One of the\nResistance to Mate Guarding items that we created matched this mate guarding item: \"I\nwas sneaky about flirting with other men so my partner wouldn't find out.\" In addition to\nthe authors creating items for theoretical reasons, a small group of research assistants\nthought of ways in which women might resist the mate guarding attempts of their partner.\nMost of the additional items included the use of technology to resist mate guarding. For\ninstance, the following item was suggested by a research assistant: \"I ignore text\nmessages/phone calls I receive from my partner throughout the day.\" Unlike some scale\ndevelopment (e.g., Buss, 1988), we did not have participants generate items. Instead, we\ngenerated items based on a theoretical approach using known mate guarding tactics to\ngenerate ideas about how women might resist mate guarding.\nAfter developing the items for the Resistance to Mate Guarding Scale, we received\napproval from the Committee for the Use of Human Subjects and then we recruited women\nfrom our university as well as from an online research website. All but 93 of the women\ncompleted the questionnaire online after consenting to participate in the study. The other 93\nResistance to mate guarding scale in women\nwomen completed a copy of the questionnaire in person. Upon completion, participants\nwere debriefed.\nResults\nDifferences between the online and on-ground participants\nWe conducted independent sample t-tests to investigate potential differences\nbetween the samples recruited online versus on-ground. Online participants were\nImportantly, women recruited online versus on-ground did not significantly differ in their\nresponses to any of the subscales of the Resistance to Mate Guarding Scale, nor did they\ndiffer in the amount of mate guarding they reported by their partners. Therefore, we\ncombined these groups for the subsequent factor analyses.\nFactor analysis of the resistance to mate guarding scale\nWe randomly split the sample and conducted an exploratory factor analysis on half\nof the data (n = 539) and a confirmatory factor analysis on half of the data (n = 569).\nExploratory factor analysis. We conducted an exploratory factor analysis on the\nResistance to Mate Guarding Scale using principal axis factoring with oblique rotation. Six\nfactors emerged, which explained 69.43% of the variance. As shown in Table 1, the six\nrotated factors had very balanced loadings.\nTable 1.

The scree plot indicated six factors,\nand after assessing the individual items, we concluded that extracting six factors was\nappropriate and theoretically sound. The six factors on the Resistance to Mate Guarding\nScale were: Covert Tactics (see Table 2), Resisting a Partner's Public Displays of Affection\n(PDA; see Table 3), Reactions against Rival Confrontation by a partner (see Table 4), use\nof High Tech Covert Strategies (see Table 5), Avoiding Contact with a Partner (see Table\n6), and Resisting a Partner's Attempts at Control (see Table 7).\nResistance to mate guarding scale in women\nTable 2.

Proposed CFA model with standardized pathway coefficients\nResistance to mate guarding scale in women\nConfirmatory factor analysis of the Resistance to Mate Guarding Scale\nBased upon the results of the exploratory factor analysis, there appeared to be some\npotentially problematic cross-loadings for six items (meeting the definition based upon a\ndifference between maximum loadings of < .10). Three items (item 13 of the Covert scale\nand Items 12 and 22 of the Avoiding Partner Contact scale) had nearly identical pattern\nmatrix factor loadings (within .03 on two subscales). These three items were removed prior\nto the confirmatory factor analysis.\nA second-order confirmatory factor analysis with maximum likelihood estimation\nwas conducted using EQS 6 to test the hypothesized 6-factor model for the Resistance to\nMate Guarding Scale. The six proposed latent constructs (i.e., first order factors) included\nCovert Tactics, Resistance to PDA, Resisting Control, Reactions against Rival, High Tech\nCovert Strategies, and Avoiding Partner's Contact. The model also included a seventh,\nsecond-order factor to represent overall resistance to mate guarding. The assumption of\nmultivariate normality was violated; therefore, we used robust maximum likelihood\nestimation. The Satorra-Bentler Scaled 2 and robust estimates of the Comparative Fit\nIndex (CFI), Root Mean-Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA), and normed chi-square\ntest (i.e., 2 divided by degrees of freedom) were used to interpret model fit.

The\nWald Test indicated that none of the measurement parameters needed to be dropped. All\ntested path coefficients were statistically significant. Moreover, all path coefficients from\nthe second- to the first-order factors were large (ranging from .59 to .90), and none of the\nfirst-order factor-to-item coefficients fell below .55. This indicates that it is appropriate to\nuse the Resistance to Mate Guarding Scale with either six subscales or as one overall\nmeasure of resistance to mate guarding. The proposed CFA model with standardized\npathway coefficients is shown in Figure 1.\nCronbach's alphas and correlation of subscales\nWe calculated Cronbach's alphas for each subscale using the entire data set. The\nreliabilities ranged from .86 to .93. The reliability for the subscale Covert Tactics was .90.\nCovert Tactics consisted of nine items that encompassed the ways women may try to resist\nmate guarding which they do not want their partner to discover. For example, \"I hid stuff\nfrom my partner, so he wouldn't find it.\" Resistance to PDA had a reliability of .93 and\nconsisted of three items. These items included behaviors aimed at trying to hinder a\npartner's attempt at being demonstrative in public. For example, \"I wouldn't let my partner\nput his arm around me in public.\" Resisting Control was the third subscale, with a\nreliability of .89. This subscale consisted of seven items that tapped into the things women\ndid to stop a partner's controlling behavior. For instance, \"I fought with my partner because\nhe didn't give me enough independence.\" The Reactions against Rival Confrontation by a\nPartner had a Cronbach's alpha of .86 and included four items. This scale tapped into the\nways women resisted their partner's attempt to confront possible mate poachers. For\ninstance, \"I was angry because my partner yelled at other people who looked at me.\" High\nTech Covert Strategies had an alpha of .87 and included five items that assessed using\nResistance to mate guarding scale in women\ntechnology to avoid a partner's mate guarding attempts. For example, \"I have erased\nmessages/comments other people have made to me via computer (i.e. Facebook, Myspace,\nAOL instant messenger, e-mail) so my partner does not find them.\" The final subscale was\nAvoiding Partner's Contact; this scale had a reliability of .87 and consisted of five items.\nThese items reflected the ways in which women escape being in contact with their partner.\nFor instance, \"I pretend that I do not receive all text messages/phone calls from my partner\nto avoid fighting with him/her.\"\nFinally, we conducted correlations using the full sample to determine if the\nsubscales were related. Not surprisingly, they were all significantly, positively correlated\nwith each other. Correlations ranged from .36 to .70 (see Table 8).\nTable 8.

We used a\nmore stringent alpha (p  .01) to decrease the probability of a Type I error that may occur\ndue to the number of analyses we performed.\nMate guarding and women's resistance to mate guarding. We predicted that\nwomen who indicated that their partners used more mate guarding tactics would have\nhigher levels of resistance to mate guarding. Each subscale of the Resistance to Mate\nGuarding Scale significantly and positively correlated with women's self-reports of their\npartner's mate guarding. The highest correlation indicated that women with partners who\nused more mate guarding tactics were more likely to resist their partner's attempts to\ncontrol them (see Table 9).\nResistance to mate guarding scale in women\nTable 9.

All r values above .10 were significant at p = .001.\nControlling partners and women's resistance to mate guarding. We predicted that\nwomen who rated their partners as more controlling (as measured by the Controlling\nBehavior Scale) would show more resistance to their partner's mate guarding attempts.\nEach subscale of the Resistance to Mate Guarding Scale significantly and positively\ncorrelated with women's ratings of their partner's controlling behaviors. Not surprisingly,\nthe highest correlation showed that women who rated their partners as more controlling\nused more covert resistance behaviors (see Table 9).\nWomen's use of control and their resistance to mate guarding. We predicted that\nwomen who self-reported high levels of control of their partner would also be more likely\nto resist their partner's mate guarding, primarily because these women clearly preferred to\nbe in control and be independent of their partners. Each subscale of the Resistance to Mate\nGuarding Scale significantly and positively correlated with women's ratings of their own\ncontrolling behavior. Interestingly, women's use of controlling behaviors had the highest\ncorrelations with covert resistance to mate guarding strategies (see Table 9).\nWomen's relationship investment and resistance to mate guarding. We predicted\nthat each subscale of the Resistance to Mate Guarding Scale would be related to less\nrelationship investment as measured by the Partner Specific Investment Inventory. Once\nagain, each subscale of the Resistance to Mate Guarding Scale significantly and negatively\npredicted women's self-reported investment in their romantic relationship. The strongest\ncorrelation indicated that the less invested women were in their relationship, the more they\navoided their partner's contact (see Table 9).\nIntimacy and resistance to mate guarding. We predicted that resistance to mate\nguarding would be higher in women who rated their relationships as less intimate. Each\nsubscale of the Resistance to Mate Guarding Scale significantly and negatively correlated\nResistance to mate guarding scale in women\nwith women's ratings of intimacy. The two strongest correlations indicated that women\nwho resisted their partner's control and avoided their partner's contact felt their\nrelationships were less intimate (see Table 9).\nWomen's attachment style and resistance to mate guarding. We predicted that\nattachment style would be correlated with the Resistance to Mate Guarding Scale. In\nparticular, we predicted that women with avoidant attachment would show more resistance\nto mate guarding. Once again, each subscale was significantly correlated with both anxious\nand avoidant attachment. However, the correlation between Resistance to a Partner's Public\nDisplays of Affection and anxious attachment was so small that it is unlikely to be\nmeaningful (r = .10). Women with anxious attachment styles were likely to resist their\npartner's mate guarding tactics using covert methods. Avoidant attachment was most\nstrongly correlated with three resistance strategies: use of covert tactics, avoiding public\ndisplays of affection, and resisting a partner's control (see Table 9).\nSOI and resistance to mate guarding. We predicted that women with a more\nunrestricted sociosexual orientation would have higher levels of resistance to mate\nguarding. As expected, all of the resistance to mate guarding subscales significantly and\npositively correlated with sociosexual orientation. However, these correlations were fairly\nlow, ranging from .13 to .24. The highest correlation indicated that more unrestricted\nwomen used more covert resistance to mate guarding strategies (see Table 9).\nDiscussion\nBased on theoretical and empirical support, we determined that the Resistance to\nMate Guarding Scale has six factors, including resistance to mate guarding via Covert\nTactics, resisting a partner's Public Displays of Affection, resisting a partner's attempts at\nControl, Reaction Against Rival Confrontation by a partner, use of High Tech Covert\nStrategies, and Avoiding Contact with a partner. These factors account for over 60% of the\nvariance. Each of these subscales had high reliability and, not surprisingly, all of the\nsubscales were significantly correlated with one another. Analyses also supported the use\nof an overall measure of resistance to mate guarding. Thus, researchers may choose to use\nan overall measure of resistance to mate guarding or the six subscales.\nIn addition to analyzing the structure and reliability of the Resistance to Mate\nGuarding Scale, we conducted further analyses to assess the validity of the questionnaire.\nAs expected, compared to the other instruments we used to assess the validity of the\nResistance to Mate Guarding Scale, mate guarding and resistance to mate guarding showed\nthe largest correlations. This suggests that resistance to mate guarding occurs when women\nperceive that their partners are mate guarding and being controlling. Even when mate\nguarding occurs, resistance is most likely under specific circumstances, such as when\nwomen know their partners will not discover their resistance or when the stakes are low,\nsuch as with a partner who will not retaliate through the use of violence. Research assessing\nmen's use of mate guarding and women's resistance to mate guarding indicates that women\nare more likely to resist mate guarding when their partner has a higher digit ratio, which is\nan indication of reduced prenatal exposure to testosterone. Since men with lower digit\nratios are more likely to espouse the use of threats and physical violence toward a partner,\nwomen may not be willing to risk resisting the mate guarding attempts of these partners\nResistance to mate guarding scale in women\nIn further support of the validity of the Resistance to Mate Guarding Scale,\nwomen's self-reported controlling behaviors positively predicted resistance to mate\nguarding, as did their report of their partner's controlling behaviors. Previous research\nindicates that control and intimate partner violence are related (Graham-Kevan and Archer,\n2005), at least in men (Cousins and Gangestad, 2007). Our research extends these findings:\nWhen male partners are controlling, their female mates are more resistant to mate guarding.\nPresumably, this is because more controlling men are more likely to mate guard their\npartners, which women then resist. In addition, our research indicates that when women see\nthemselves as particularly controlling, they are more likely to resist their partner's mate\nguarding attempts. There are a few possible explanations for this finding. These women\nmay be more interested in independence within their relationship. Alternatively, these\nwomen may be in highly antagonistic relationships where both partners try to induce\njealousy and react to the jealousy of their partners. Future research should investigate these\npossibilities.\nRelationship investment and intimacy were negatively correlated with resistance to\nmate guarding. When women are less invested in their relationships, they may focus more\non seeking an alternative mate. These women should be particularly likely to be mate\nguarded by their partners and to be motivated to resist those mate guarding attempts. When\nintimacy is low, women may be resistant to the mate guarding tactics of their partner\nbecause they are dissatisfied with their relationships.\nThose with anxious and avoidant attachment also used more resistance to mate\nguarding tactics, although anxious attachment had a very low correlation with resistance to\na partner's PDA (r = .10). We predicted that those with avoidant attachment would be more\nlikely to resist mate guarding because women with an avoidant attachment style tend to be\nless committed to their relationships (DeWall et al., 2011). It is not clear how to interpret\nthe finding that women with more anxious attachment styles more strongly resisted mate\nguarding. This correlation is very low and may represent a spurious relationship.\nFinally, there were small but statistically significant correlations between\nsociosexual orientation and resistance to mate guarding such that more unrestricted women\nused more resistance strategies. This may be due to the fact that unrestricted women are\nmore likely to cheat on a partner (Feldman and Cauffman, 1999); prior research shows that\nwomen who are interested in men other than their partners are more likely to resist mate\nguarding (Cousins et al., 2009). In sum, our results support both the convergent validity of\nthe Resistance to Mate Guarding Scale.\nLimitations and future directions\nOne of the limitations of this research is that only women were assessed.\nEvolutionary theory clearly predicts that men mate guard their partners, but its predictions\nfor women's mate guarding are less straightforward. Buss (2002) argued that it makes\nsense for women to mate guard a partner because loss of resources to a competitor would\nhave had detrimental fitness effects for a woman whose partner cheated on her. As with\nwomen's use of aggression, we suspect that even when women mate guard their partners,\nthey are using some of the tactics that have a lower risk of physical injury (i.e., they avoid\nphysical fights) (Campbell, 2005). The fitness payoffs to women are lower for tactics that\ncould result in physical injury because women were more important in the survival of their\noffspring (Campbell, 2005). Research bears this out: In married couples, husbands,\nResistance to mate guarding scale in women\ncompared to their wives, report greater use of tactics that may risk injury such as\nthreatening competitors (Buss and Shackelford, 1997). Many of the behaviors we consider\nto be mate guarding may have led to injury (Campbell, 2005). For instance, confronting a\nrival may lead to a physical assault and, therefore, women may be less likely to employ this\nmethod of mate guarding.\nIf women also use mate guarding to control their partners, this scale may not\ncapture men's resistance strategies as well as it does women's resistance strategies. As with\nmate retention tactics, we expect that men may resist their partner's mate guarding in ways\nthat are more confrontational, especially regarding physical confrontations. Many of the\nitems on the current scale reflect the covert nature of the tactics used by women to resist\ntheir partner's mate guarding attempts (e.g., \"I always erase text messages/voicemails from\nother people so my partner does not find out who I have been conversing with that day\"). In\nfact, in previous research we divided this scale into the behaviors men would be aware of\nand those for which men would not be aware of (Cousins, 2003). Future research should\ninclude an analysis of whether resistance to mate guarding occurs in men and whether they\nuse the same tactics as women.\nIt is possible that our resistance scale is tapping into a more general strategy in\nwomen who dislike behavioral restriction. That is, some women may score higher on the\nresistance to mate guarding scale simply because they dislike any sort of behavioral\nrestriction. However, previous research using an earlier, unpublished version of this scale\nindicates that women are more likely to resist mate guarding when they are fertile,\nparticularly for women who are attracted to men other than their primary partners\n(Gangestad, Garver-Apgar, Cousins, and Thornhill, 2014). The fact that women's scores\nvary across the menstrual cycle strongly suggests that the Resistance to Mate Guarding\nScale does not measure a general form of behavioral restriction, but taps directly into\nwomen's behavioral response to their partner's attempts to keep them from cheating.\nAlthough we believe this is strong evidence that the Resistance to Mate Guarding Scale is\nnot measuring psychological reactance, future research should address this issue more\ndirectly. The current research strongly supports the convergent validity of the Resistance to\nMate Guarding Scale. However, future research should assess the discriminant validity of\nthe measure.\nConclusions\nOur research extends Buss' (1988) research on mate retention by assessing the\ndynamics that occur between partners when mate guarding is present in the relationship. By\nassessing dynamics within romantic relationships, especially regarding conflict over mate\nretention strategies, a better understanding of the interaction between partners will emerge.\nThis will add to the growing body of research seeking to understand the coevolution of\nstrategies when partners are in conflict.\nThe Resistance to Mate Guarding Scale may elucidate individual differences in\nreactions to a partner's mate guarding. We expect that scores on this scale will be predicted\nby a variety of factors, including interest in extra-pair partners and cheating. The resistance\nto Mate Guarding Scale adds to a growing body of research assessing sexually antagonistic\ncoevolution in humans. In the past few years, research on sexually antagonistic coevolution\nhas grown in importance. Recent work by McKibbin, Shackelford, Miner, Bates, and\nLiddle (2011) highlights the importance of research concerning sexually antagonistic\nResistance to mate guarding scale in women\ncoevolution. To our knowledge, this study is the first to develop a scale measuring\nstrategies to reduce mate guarding.\n"
