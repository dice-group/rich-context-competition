Discrete-time survival analysis is used to study\nthe effects of retrospectively reported temporally prior substance use, abuse, and dependence in predicting first\nonset of suicidal behavior. Alcohol and drug use predict subsequent suicide attempts after controlling for\nsociodemographics and comorbid mental disorders. Previous use is not a significant predictor among current\nnonusers. Abuse and dependence are significant predictors among users for three of the 10 substances\nconsidered (alcohol, inhalants, and heroin). The number of substances used is more important than the types\nof substances used in predicting suicidal behavior. Disaggregation shows that the effects of use are largely on\nsuicidal ideation and nonplanned attempts among ideators. In comparison, the effects of use on suicide plans\nand planned attempts among ideators are not significant.

First, with the\nexception of alcohol, little is known about the types of\nsubstances most strongly related to suicide attempts.\nWhether depressants are stronger predictors of suicide\nattempts than are stimulants or hallucinogens is of par-\nticular interest (1, 7, 8). Second, it is not known\nwhether substance abuse and dependence are the pri-\nmary predictors of suicide attempts or whether sub-\nstance users without abuse or dependence also have\nelevated risk (9). Third, it is unclear whether suicide\nattempts are associated with a past history of substance\ndisorder or only with having an active disorder (10).\nFourth, little is known as to whether substance disor-\nReceived for publication December 10, 1998, and accepted for\nAbbreviations: CIDI, Composite International Diagnostic\nInterview; DSM-IIIR, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental\nDisorders, 3rd ed., rev.; NCS, National Comorbidrty Survey; OR,\nodds ratio.\n1 Department of Health Care Policy, Harvard Medical School,\nBoston, MA.\n2 The Mexican Institute of Psychiatry, Mexico City, Mexico.\nReprint requests to Dr. Guilherme Luiz Guimaraes Borges,\nDivision de Investigaciones Epidemiologicas y SodaJes, Institute)\nMexicano de Psiquiatria, Calzada Mexico, Xochimilco No. 101, Col.\nSan Lorenzo, Huipulco, Mexico DFCP 14370 (e-mail: guibor\u00a9imp.\nedu.mx).\nders predict suicidal ideation, plans among ideators,\nattempts among ideators either with or without a plan,\nor some combination of these transitions (11, 12).\nFinally, the extent to which comorbid mental disorders\nexplain the associations between substance disorders\nand suicidal behaviors is unknown (13, 14).\nAll these issues are addressed in the current report,\nwhich is based on analysis of data obtained in the\nNational Comorbidity Survey (NCS) (15). The NCS is\na nationally representative survey of the US household\npopulation that includes retrospective reports about the\nages at onset and lifetime occurrences of suicidal\nideation, plans, and attempts along with information\nabout the occurrences of mental disorders, substance\nuse, substance abuse, and substance dependence.\nSample\na nationally representative household sample of 8,098\npersons aged 15-54 years. Informed consent was\nobtained from all respondents and from the parents of\nrespondents who were minors aged 15-17 years. The\nresponse rate was 82.4 percent. Two-part interviews\nwere carried out face-to-face in the homes of respon-\ndents. The part I interview, which was administered to\nall 8,098 respondents, assessed the lifetime and recent\nprevalences of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of\nMental Disorders, 3rd ed., rev. (DSM-EIR) (16) psy-\nchiatric disorders. The part II interview, which was\nadministered to a total of 5,877 respondents consisting\nof all those who screened positive for any psychiatric\ndisorder in part I and a probability subsample of all\nremaining respondents, collected data on correlates of\npsychiatric disorders. The part II data are the basis for\nthe current report, as questions about suicidal behav-\niors were included in the part II interview. These data\nwere weighted to correct for differential probabilities\nof selection in part II as well as for differential proba-\nbilities of within-household selection and nonre-\nsponse. Comparisons of the part II NCS demographic\ndistributions with census data show that the sample is\nrepresentative of the US population on a wide range of\nsociodemographic variables (17). More details about\nthe NCS design and data collection methods are\nMeasures\nDiagnoses were based on the definitions and criteria\nof the American Psychiatric Association's DSM-lUR,\noperationalized with a modified version of the World\nHealth Organization's Composite International\nDiagnostic Interview (CIDI) (19). The CIDI is a fully\nstructured interview designed for use by trained inter-\nviewers who are not clinicians. The diagnoses of cen-\ntral interest are abuse of and dependence on alcohol\nand drugs. The substances considered here include\nalcohol, four types of prescription medication (anal-\ngesics, sedatives, tranquilizers, and stimulants), and\nfive types of illicit drugs (marijuana and hashish,\ncocaine, inhalants, hallucinogens, and heroin).\nRetrospective reports were obtained for each sub-\nstance on age at first use, age at onset of abuse, and age\nat onset of dependence. Abuse was defined as the per-\nsistent (at least 1 month) or repeated occurrence of\neither 1) continued use despite knowledge of having a\nsocial, occupational, psychologic, or physical problem\ncaused or exacerbated by use of the substance or 2)\nrecurrent use in situations in which use is physically\nhazardous. Dependence was defined as the persistent\nor repeated occurrence of at least three of nine DSM-\n111R symptoms, such as unsuccessful attempts to con-\ntrol use, tolerance, and withdrawal. Abuse and depen-\ndence are defined as mutually exclusive so that a\nrespondent who meets criteria for both abuse and\ndependence is classified as having dependence but not\nabuse.\nControls were also included for a number of other\nDSM-11LR disorders that include mood disorders\n(major depression, mania, and dysthymia), anxiety dis-\norders (panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder,\nphobias, and post-traumatic stress disorder), conduct\ndisorder, antisocial personality disorder, and nonaffec-\ntive psychosis. The assessments of all these disorders,\nwith the exceptions of conduct disorder and antisocial\npersonality disorder, were based on the CIDI. Conduct\ndisorder and antisocial personality disorder were\nassessed with the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (20)\nbecause the CIDI does not include these diagnoses.\nWorld Health Organization CIDI field trials (21) and\nNCS clinical reappraisal studies (22) both document\ngood reliability and the validity of most of the CIDI\ndiagnoses considered here with two important excep-\ntions. The first involves mania. Only the euphoric-\ngrandiose subtype of mania is validly assessed with the\nCIDI (23). As a result, only this subtype is included in\nthe definition of mania used in this report. The second\ninvolves nonaffective psychosis, which is substantially\noverdiagnosed with the CIDI (22). As a result, the\nCIDI was used as a first-stage screen for nonaffective\npsychosis. All NCS respondents who screened positive\nhad clinical reinterviews prior to a final diagnosis of\nnonaffective psychosis (24).\nThe NCS questions about suicidality asked about the\nlifetime occurrence; age at onset; and recency of suici-\ndal ideation (\"Have you ever seriously thought about\ncommitting suicide?\"), suicide plans (\"Have you ever\nmade a plan for committing suicide?\"), and suicide\nattempts (\"Have you ever attempted suicide?\"). The\noutcome of primary interest in this report is the first\nlifetime occurrence of a suicide attempt, although we\nalso examine intervening effects of significant predic-\ntors on first onset of suicidal ideation, developing a\nplan among ideators, making a first attempt among\npeople with a plan, and making a first attempt among\nideators without a plan.\nThe sociodemographic variables included in the\nanalyses as covariates are sex, marital status, cohort,\neducational attainment, race-ethnicity, urbanicity, and\nage of youngest child. Marital status was coded to dif-\nferentiate the currently married, previously married\n(separated, divorced, widowed), and never married.\nCohort was coded to differentiate respondents born in\nferentiate current students from those who already\ncompleted their schooling and, within each of these\ntwo categories, to differentiate those who had com-\npleted less than high school (0-11 years), high school\nmore (^16 years). Race-ethnicity was coded to differ-\nentiate among non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic\nBlack, Hispanic, and other (Native American, Asian,\nPacific Islander, and respondents who self-defined\nthemselves as \"other\"). Urbanicity was coded into\n  and Substance Use in the NCS 783\nthree categories to differentiate among respondents\nliving in census-defined major metropolitan areas,\ncensus-defined urban areas, and census-defined non-\nurban areas. Finally, age of youngest child was coded\ninto four categories consisting of respondents who had\nno living child and those whose youngest child was 1\nyear or less old, between 2 and 10 years inclusive, and\nmore than 10 years of age.\nAnalysis procedures\nDiscrete-time survival analyses with time-varying\ncovariates (25) were used to estimate the effects of\nsubstance use, abuse, and dependence on predicting\nthe subsequent first occurrence of a suicide attempt. A\ndiscrete-time approach was used instead of the more\ntraditional continuous-time approach because the NCS\nrecorded the time to event at yearly intervals rather\nthan on a continuous time scale and because the\ndiscrete-time approach facilitates the use of the many\ndifferent time-dependent covariates included in our\nanalyses (26). The use of survival analyses relied on\nretrospective age-at-onset reports to establish a tem-\nporal order between the predictors and the outcomes\n(27). This was done by treating the person-year as the\nunit of analysis and creating separate observational\nrecords for each year of a person's life up to and\nincluding the year at first onset of the outcome. A\ndichotomous variable was created to distinguish the\nyear of the outcome (coded 1) from years prior to the\noutcome (coded 0). These data files were analyzed\nusing logistic regression models that included a\ndummy variable control for each person-year.\nBecause of the complex sample design and weight-\ning of the NCS, standard errors of the survival coeffi-\ncients were estimated using the method of jacknife\nrepeated replications (28). These estimates adjust for\nthe clustering and weighting of cases in the household\nsample. The survival coefficients were exponentiated\nand are reported in the form of odds ratios. The 95 per-\ncent confidence intervals of these coefficients also are\nreported and have been adjusted for design effects.\nMultivariate tests were based on Wald chi-squares\ncomputed from coefficient variance-covariance matri-\nces that were adjusted for design effects. Results\nreferred to as statistically significant are those that are\nsignificant based on two-sided design-based tests eval-\nuated at the 0.05 level of significance.\nRESULTS\nAggregate associations\nThe lifetime prevalence of suicide attempts in the\nNCS is 4.6 percent. Cross-sectional bivariate associa-\ntions between sociodemographics and lifetime history\nof making an attempt are shown in table 1.\nSignificantly elevated prevalences are found among\nwomen, the previously married, respondents in the\nyoungest cohort, and those with comparatively low\nlevels of education. It is also shown that respondents\nwith alcohol and drug dependence have elevated\nprevalences of suicide attempts.\nTable 2 shows the results of survival analyses in\nwhich the time-lagged effects of alcohol and drug use,\nabuse, and dependence on predicting first suicide\nattempt are assessed with multivariate controls for\nsociodemographic variables. As shown in model 1, the\nodds ratios associated with history of substance use\nand substance disorders (with nonusers being the con-\ntrast category) in separate multivariate equations for\nalcohol and drugs range between 2.8 (alcohol use) and\n17.6 (alcohol dependence). There is a dramatic gradi-\nent in these odds ratios, with the lowest associated\nwith use and the highest associated with dependence.\nThe results in model 2 show how these odds ratios\nchange when we introduce controls for comorbid life-\ntime mental disorders with ages at onset prior to the age\nat first suicide attempt. The odds ratios, although all\nstill significant, are considerably smaller than in model\n1, suggesting that a substantial part of the gross associ-\nations are due to comorbidities with these mental disor-\nders, hi addition, the clear differences in the magni-\ntudes of odds ratios associated with histories of use,\nabuse, and dependence seen in model 1 are substan-\ntially attenuated in model 2. Finally, the results in\nmodel 3 show how the odds ratios change when mea-\nsures of alcohol and drug use, abuse, and dependence\nare included in a single prediction equation. The odds\nratios associated with abuse and dependence decrease\nnoticeably compared with their values in model 2.\nNonetheless, separate tests (with results not shown in\ntable 2) that reparameterized the model using contrast\ncoding of the substance exposures found that the odds\nratios of abuse and dependence are significantly differ-\nent from those of use for both alcohol (x2\nSubstance-specific associations\nThe joint effects of use, abuse, and dependence are\nfurther explored in table 3 by focusing separately on\neach of the 10 substances assessed in the NCS.

This\nmeans that the number of substances used is more\nimportant than the types of substances used (/2\nDecomposition of associations through ideation\nand plans\nWe combined this result with information about the\nnumber of substances currently used into a single\ncount ranging between 0 and 7.

The first of these equations considers the\neffects of use on first onset of suicidal ideation.

None of the odds ratios\nin this equation is nearly as large as the parallel coeffi-\ncients in the equations to predict ideation or attempt. A\nseparate analysis, not reported in the table, shows that\na single dummy variable for any use is also not signif-\nicant in predicting onset of a plan.\nThe last two equations consider the effects of use on\nfirst suicide attempt in either the absence or the pres-\nence of a plan.

A separate\nanalysis, again not reported in the table, shows that a\nsingle dummy variable for any use is also not signifi-\ncant in predicting onset of a planned attempt.\nFinally, we evaluated specifications of the results in\ntable 5 as a function of the sociodemographic variables\n(sex, marital status, cohort, educational attainment,\nrace-ethnicity, urbanicity, and age of youngest child).\nGlobal interaction tests of the number of drugs (mod-\neled as a continuous variable) with sociodemographic\nvariables were performed based on backwards elimi-\nnation from a saturated two-way interaction equation.\nThis was done for each of the four nested outcomes\n(ideation, plan among ideators, unplanned attempt, and\nplanned attempt). We found no more significant inter-\nactions than one would expect by chance (two of 28).\nDISCUSSION\nThe results reported here are limited by the fact that\nthe NCS is a cross-sectional survey in which informa-\ntion about the occurrences and ages at onset of lifetime\nsubstance use and suicidal behaviors is based on retro-\nspective reports. Unwillingness to report or failure to\nrecall accurately the age at onset could introduce errors\ninto the results. Within the context of these limitations,\nthe association between substance disorders and sui-\ncide attempts that has been found repeatedly in both\nresearch (35-37), our results show significantly higher\nlifetime prevalences of attempted suicide among\nwomen and the previously married, along with a sig-\nnificant inverse association with education (38).\nAs noted in the Introduction, little attention has been\ngiven in previous research to the specifications consid-\nered in the current report. The first issue considered\nwas that it might not be substance disorders them-\nselves, but rather comorbid lifetime mental disorders\nthat predict suicide attempts (13, 14). Our results were\npartially consistent with this hypothesis in showing\nthat statistical controls for comorbid mental disorders\nlead to a substantial reduction in the odds ratios asso-\nciated with substance use disorders. However, the\nresidual odds ratios remain statistically significant\neven after controls for mental disorders, strongly sug-\ngesting that the effects of substance use disorders on\nsuicide attempts are not entirely due to the effects of\ncomorbid mental disorders.\nThe second issue considered was whether there is a\nsignificant difference in the odds ratios associated with\nuse in the absence of abuse or dependence and the\nodds ratios associated with abuse or dependence. Use\nwas found to be a consistent significant predictor\nacross all substances, while we found significant incre-\nmental effects of abuse or dependence for only three\nsubstances (alcohol, inhalants, and heroin).\nThe third issue considered was whether the associ-\nation between use and suicide attempt is found across\na wide array of drugs or is limited only to substances\nwith certain pharmacologic properties. Our results\nare quite clear in showing that, after controlling for\nthe confounding effects of sociodemographics and\nmental disorders, the strength of the association is\nvery similar for all the types of drugs studied. The\nnumber of substances is clearly more important than\nthe type of substance in predicting first suicide\nattempt. This finding contradicts the hypothesis that\ndepressants (e.g., alcohol and tranquilizers) are\nstronger predictors of suicide attempts than are other\nThe fourth issue considered was whether it is current\nuse or a history of use that more strongly predicts sui-\ncide attempts. The former was found to be the case,\nalthough there are two significant odds ratios for pre-\nvious use (of marijuana and heroin). With these excep-\ntions, we found that the major risk of suicidal behav-\niors is linked to current use rather than to past use,\nsuggesting that the causal pathways involved in this\nassociation are ones that are activated by use or its\nproximate correlates.\nAlthough there has not been a great deal of research\non the disaggregation of substance effects on suicide\nattempts through ideation and plans, what little is\nknown about this matter suggests that substance disor-\nders are associated weakly with suicide ideation, but\n40). We found exactly the opposite. It is not clear why\nthis discrepancy exists, but it is worth noting that the\nprevious studies that examined this specification did\nnot attempt to use age-at-onset reports to sort out tem-\nporal priorities and disaggregate nested effects in the\nway we did in the current report. It is conceivable that\nthis difference in refinement of measures and analysis\nmethods explains the discrepancies.\nAnother interesting and related specification is our\nfailure to find a dose-response relation between the\nnumber of substances used and the risk of unplanned\nsuicide. Assuming that use of multiple drugs does not\nlead to any greater disinhibition than does use of only\none drug, this finding is consistent with the disinhibi-\ntion hypothesis, which specifies that intoxication can\nincrease risk of suicide attempts among ideators by\nreducing inhibitions to make an impulsive attempt (41,\nImportantly, the association between the number of\nsubstances used and the onset of suicidal ideation does\nexhibit a dose-response relation. The fact that this is\nnot true of the association between the number of sub-\nstances used and the unplanned attempts among\nideators implies that the processes involved in the\nassociation between use and ideation are different\nfrom those involved in the association between use and\nprogression from ideation to an unplanned attempt We\nhave no way of knowing what these processes might\nbe, but it is noteworthy that they involve determinants\nof current rather than of lifetime use. This suggests that\nthe most fruitful areas for further investigation are\nlikely to involve active influences on use or short-term\nadverse consequences that no longer exist once use has\nended.\nFinally, the results reported here suggest that clini-\ncians should recognize that substance users with sui-\ncidal ideation have an elevated risk of first suicide\nattempts even in the absence of a plan. This is an\nimportant result in light of the fact that the presence\nof a plan is typically used as the key indicator of sui-\ncide risk among ideators and the fact that little is\nknown about the predictors of attempted suicide\namong ideators without a plan. The failure to find a\ndose-response relation in predicting unplanned\nattempts among ideators indirectly suggests that dis-\ninhibition is somehow involved in the effects of sub-\nstance use. It would be useful for future research to\ninvestigate this suggestion more directly by develop-\ning measures of individual differences in disinhibi-\ntion while under the influence as well as by investi-\ngating the mediating and modifying effects of\npersonality characteristics associated with lack of\nplanning.\n"
