The studies ranged from mollusks or\narthropods, to amphibians, reptiles, birds, and fish, but the majority of studies (84%) were\ncarried out with mammals (29% of which were primates). The results of these studies\nindicate that inter-individual behavioral differences grant adaptive and fitness advantages to\nthese species (Dall, Houston, and McNamara, 2004; Dingemanse and Wolf, 2010; Smith\nand Blumstein, 2008; Wolf and Weissing, 2010). This does not necessarily mean that the\nPersonality in sanctuary-housed chimpanzees\npersonalities of phylogenetically distant species are homologous to human personalities.\nHowever, the similarities found among human and non-human primates could be explained\nas evolutionary conserved features (Weiss, Inoue-Murayama, King, Adams, and\nMatsuzawa, 2012). The conservation of behavioral dispositions across species suggests that\nprocesses of balancing selection (environmental heterogeneity, negative frequency-\ndependent selection, and migration) that have been implicated in the evolution of human\npersonality (Penke, Denissen, and Miller, 2007) have also maintained variation in\nchimpanzee personality.\nThe instruments used for the assessment of personality have varied over the years\n(Briffa and Weiss, 2010). Most of the non-human animal (Gosling, 2001) and primate\n(Freeman, Gosling, and Schapiro, 2011) studies have employed some type of coding, but\nthe rating method has been the most widely used with chimpanzees (Freeman and Gosling,\n2010). In the rating method, keepers, researchers, or volunteers who are familiar with the\nanimals are responsible for evaluating the personality of the individuals, usually using\nLikert scale adjectives lists (Vazire and Gosling, 2004). Considering that many of these\nanimals are in captive conditions (such as zoos, sanctuaries or laboratories), an assessment\ntool is needed that will aid in the rapid and effective assessment of personality by\nemployees of these centers, who do not have much time to undertake assessments. The\nultimate goal is to find practical applications in the field of animal management, welfare,\nwellbeing, and health.\nOur research employs a \"top-down\" rating assessment (Freeman et al., 2013; Uher,\n2008) with two of the major models used to study human personality: the Five-Factor\nModel (FFM) (Goldberg, 1990) and Eysenck's Psychoticism-Extraversion-Neuroticism\nmodel (PEN) (Eysenck and Eysenck, 1964). The first is a hierarchical model with five\nbipolar factors: Neuroticism, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and\nOpenness to Experience (Goldberg, 1990; McCrae and Costa, 1999). This model suggests\nthat human personality is classified into these five dimensions (John and Srivastava, 1999).\nThe model (1) has demonstrated high reliability and predictive ability in humans,\ndescribing most individual differences in personality (Digman, 1990); (2) has revealed a\ngenetic basis for these traits (Bouchard and Loehlin, 2001); and (3) is widely applicable to\ndifferent situations and cultures (McCrae and Terracciano, 2005). Therefore, it describes\ntraits that are most likely biologically based and that may exist in some of our primate\nrelatives. This model has been one of the most widely used to organize and integrate the\nstudies of animal personalities in general, and primates in particular (Freeman and Gosling,\n2010). Using the FFM as a framework, some studies have determined the most common\npersonality dimensions in primates (King and Figueredo, 1997; Konecn\u00e1, Weiss, Lhota,\nand Wallner, 2012; Lilienfeld, Gershon, Duke, Marino, and de Waal, 1999; Morton et al.,\nof the traits studied in animals essentially correspond to the first three dimensions of the\nmodel, whereas the Conscientiousness factor seems to be restricted to chimpanzees\nfactors of the model are proposed as temperament dimensions, the first three could be\nregarded as more \"basic\" traits--i.e., dimensions associated more with emotional reactivity\nand individual physiological processes. The first two dimensions of the FFM coincide with\nthose postulated by Eysenck (Eysenck and Eysenck, 1963), who later added a third factor\ncalled \"Psychoticism\" (Eysenck and Eysenck, 1964). Curiously, the Eysenck model (PEN)\nPersonality in sanctuary-housed chimpanzees\nhas not been applied previously in chimpanzees, despite the fact that it has an empirical\npsychobiological base. Eysenck used it only in rhesus monkeys (Chamove, Eysenck, and\nHarlow, 1972). So, given the success that researchers have had in adapting the Five-Factor\nModel for use with non-human species, we wanted to examine whether the PEN could be\nemployed with non-human species as well in order to gain a better understanding of their\npersonalities. As with other top-down models applied in animals (e.g., Emotions Profile\nIndex [EPI]: Buirski, Kellerman, Plutchik, Weininger, and Buirski, 1973; Interpersonal\nCircumplex: Zeigler-Hill and Highfill, 2010), it is essential to test the usefulness and\nconsistency of the method in chimpanzees. In any case, determining whether all or some of\nthe factors in the Psychoticism-Extraversion-Neuroticism model or the Five-Factor Model\nare expressed in chimpanzees could be very important for the understanding of human\nbehavior from a phylogenetic perspective.\nThe primary objective of this study was to evaluate the factor structure of\npersonality in a group of sanctuary chimpanzees employing the top-down method (Freeman\net al., 2013) of two of the main models used in humans: the Five-Factor Model (FFM) and\nthe Psychoticism-Extraversion-Neuroticism model (PEN). We have evaluated the\nusefulness of the PEN and have attempted to determine which of the two theoretical\npersonality models proposed is best suited to assess personality in chimpanzees housed in a\nsanctuary--i.e., in animals previously used for entertainment and as pets, which is unlike\nmost studies conducted with laboratory and zoo chimpanzees (Brittain and Corr, 2009;\nFreeman and Gosling, 2010; King, Weiss, and Farmer, 2005). Additionally, unlike other\nsanctuary samples, because these animals have been previously used for commercial\npurposes or as pets, they may provide interesting data when compared to other types of\nsamples (King et al., 2005; Weiss, King, and Hopkins, 2007). Although their living\nconditions have likely improved, it is important to consider that these animals may have\nmisaligned personality patterns and possibly even mental disorders (Bradshaw, Capaldo,\n2005) due to traumatic captive conditions prior to their arrival at the primate rescue center.\nMaterials and Methods\nStudy site and sample\n2\u00ba49'E) has been dedicated to the rescue, recovery, rehabilitation, re-socialization, and\nsheltering of primates that have been exploited or abused. FM seeks to provide these\nprimates with the best captive conditions through naturalized environments and stable\nsocial groups in order to help the animals develop patterns of behavior common to their\nspecies, thus promoting their welfare. Two females and nine males with a mean age of\nindividuals from early adolescence to old age. We conducted this research in accordance\nwith all national and institutional guidelines for the care and management of primates\nestablished by FM.\nRaters\nThe questionnaires were evaluated by 28 raters (25% men and 75% women) who\nknew all of the chimpanzees for at least 6 months and who fell into one of three different\nPersonality in sanctuary-housed chimpanzees\nprofiles: researchers (50%), keepers (43%), and volunteers (7%). All of the raters evaluated\nall subjects with both questionnaires. Raters were instructed to base their judgments on\ntheir general impressions of the chimpanzees, not on frequency estimates of past behaviors.\nThe instructions also warned the evaluators to avoid discussing their ratings with other\nraters. Raters were classified into three categories according to the length of time they had\nknown their study subjects: those who knew the sample for less than 1 year (35%), for\nQuestionnaires\nThe Eysenck questionnaire (PEN) was created based on a previous study (Totusaus\nand Llorente, 2011) and consists of a total of 12 adjectives rated on a 7-point Likert scale.\nEach adjective has an antonym, and according to the degree to which the adjective\ndescribed the chimpanzee, the evaluation came closer to one pole or the other. Meanwhile,\nthe FFM questionnaire was based on a questionnaire previously used by King and\nFigueredo (1997), which was based on Goldberg's study (1990) in humans. In our case,\ntwo of the adjectives that were used by King and Figueredo (\"submissive\" and\n\"independent\") were eliminated because the adjectives \"dominant\" and \"dependent\"\nincluded in the list represented the same trait. In addition, three other adjectives were not\nincluded in this study: \"clumsy,\" \"autistic,\" and \"manipulative.\" The first two were\neliminated because they were not represented in any factor in the study by King and\nFigueredo (1997), and the third was discarded because it received low scores in the same\nstudy. Thus, the total number of adjectives used in the FFM questionnaire in our study was\n38, with a rating scale of 1 to 7. As in Eysenck's questionnaire, in the FFM questionnaire,\nwe decided to use the synonym-antonym evaluation, so the antonyms were deduced from\nthe adjectives used in the King and Figueredo (1997) study. In some cases, additional\nadjectives were included for both poles in order to clarify the definition of the trait.\nInter-rater reliability of items\nThe reliability of the 28 raters was assessed for each item using two intraclass\ncorrelation coefficients (ICC) (Shrout and Fliess, 1979). The first ICC (3, 1) indicates the\nreliability of the scores for a single evaluator. The second ICC (3, k) indicates the reliability\nfor the mean scores of the evaluators (in our case, based on an average of 28 raters per\nchimpanzee).\nData reduction: PCA and REFA for both models\nTo determine the personality trait domains, we first transformed our data into z-\nscores using a principal-components analysis (PCA) to identify the dimensions underlying\nthe mean ratings. To determine the number of factor components to extract (only the\nfactors that exceeded the 95th percentile of the values derived from random matrices were\nextracted), we examined the scree plot and used parallel analysis (Horn, 1965; O'Connor,\n2000). After determining the number of components, we subjected those components to an\northogonal (varimax) and oblique (promax) rotation. For the purpose of interpreting and\nscoring factors, we defined absolute loadings greater than or equal to 0.50 as salient. The\ncomponent scores were unit-weighted, thus the z-scores of items with salient primary\nloadings were assigned weights of +1 or -1, depending on the direction of the loading.\nItems with nonsalient loadings were assigned weights of 0. Unit-weighted scores are more\nPersonality in sanctuary-housed chimpanzees\ngeneralizable across studies and are highly correlated with differentially weighted scores\n(Gorsuch, 1983). Moreover, due to the small sample, we used regularized exploratory\nfactor analysis (REFA), a new technique specifically designed to derive factors when the\nsample size is very small (Jung and Lee, 2011; Jung and Takane, 2008). For this analysis\nwe used quartimax rotation and specified unweighted least squares for factor extraction.\nResults\nInter-rater reliability of items\nThe ICCs for the single (3, 1) and average (3, k) ratings were generally strong and\nthere were no unreliable coefficients equal to or less than zero to eliminate from the\nanalysis, indicating that raters tended to agree in their judgments about the personality traits\nof the chimpanzees. In the case of the PEN, the ICC (3, 1) coefficients ranged from .20\n(cruel) to .54 (active), with a mean reliability of .37. The ICC (3, k) coefficients ranged\nbetween .87 (cruel) and .97 (active) with a mean reliability of .94.\nIn the case of the FFM, the ICC (3, 1) coefficients ranged from .09 (laborious) to\n.60 (active), with a mean reliability of .35, while the ICC (3, k) coefficients ranged between\n.74 (laborious) and .97 (active), with a mean reliability of .92.\nData reduction: PCA and REFA results for the PEN model\nVisual inspection of the scree plot for the 11 mean ratings suggested three\ncomponents to extract, and a parallel analysis of the 11 mean ratings also suggested three\ncomponents. Because no differences were found between the two methods, we decided not\nto use orthogonal Procrustes rotation (McCrae, Zonderman, Costa, Bond, and Paunonen,\n1996). The three components identified by the abovementioned instruments were extracted\nusing PCA. The components were subjected to varimax rotation (K.M.O = 0.792) so as to\nobtain an interpretable orthogonal structure. The three components based on the 11 mean\nratings accounted for 64.91% of variance. We were more restrictive than prior studies (e.g.,\nsalient (see Table 1). We extracted three factors from the 11 mean ratings using REFA and\nsubjected these factors to a quartimax rotation. As REFA loadings are shrunk toward zero\n(Jung and Lee, 2011), they are more conservative than loadings obtained via PCA. We also\ndefined |.5| loadings as salient. The dimensions extracted by REFA and those extracted by\nPCA were highly comparable (see Table 1). With little exception, none of the extractions\nled to differences in how the dimensions were interpreted.\nThe first factor loaded positively on the items \"spontaneous,\" \"active,\" \"social,\" and\n\"creative,\" and negatively on the item \"sad.\" We therefore labeled this factor Extraversion.\nThe second factor is characterized by the adjectives \"aggressive,\" \"anxious,\" \"impulsive,\"\n\"cruel,\" and \"bad-tempered,\" which reflect a Neuroticism factor with a Psychoticism\ncomponent. We labeled this Neuropsychoticism. Finally, the third factor loaded the\nadjective \"dominance,\" so it was labeled Dominance.\nFrom the three components extracted, the promax rotation produced quite weak\ncorrelations, with a mean absolute intercorrelation value of .17 (see Table 2).\nPersonality in sanctuary-housed chimpanzees\nTable 1. Factor loadings obtained according to the PEN model\nPrincipal Component Analysis Regularized Exploratory Factor Analysis\nTable 2. Factor intercorrelation matrix for the PEN model\nFactor Extraversion Neuropsychoticism Dominance\nExtraversion -\nNeuropsychoticism -.11 -\nData reduction: PCA and REFA results for the Five Factor Model\nVisual inspection of the scree plot for the 11 mean ratings suggested four\ncomponents, as did the parallel analysis of the 11 mean ratings. We therefore decided to\ncontinue with the PCA without applying orthogonal Procrustes rotation. After determining\nthat there were four components to extract, these components were extracted using PCA\nand were subjected to varimax rotation (K.M.O. = 0.915) so as to obtain an interpretable\northogonal structure. The four components accounted for 60.67% of variance based on the\n11 mean ratings. We therefore determined loadings of |.5| as salient (see Table 3). We\nextracted four factors from the 11 mean ratings using REFA and subjected these factors to\na quartimax rotation. As REFA loadings are shrunk toward zero (Jung and Lee, 2011), they\nare more conservative than loadings obtained via PCA. We also defined loadings of |.5| as\nsalient. The dimensions extracted by REFA and those extracted by PCA were highly\ncomparable (see Table 4). There were some exceptions, although none led to differences in\nhow the dimensions were interpreted.\nThe first factor positively loaded on items such as \"sociable,\" \"playful,\"\n\"gregarious,\" \"friendly,\" \"bold,\" \"affectionate,\" \"cheerful,\" \"active,\" and \"sympathetic,\"\namong others. We thus labeled this factor Extraversion. The second factor loaded on items\nrelated to \"not defiant,\" \"peaceable,\" \"patient,\" \"not bullying,\" \"patient,\" \"reflexive,\" and\n\"generous,\" among others. We therefore labeled this factor Conscientiousness with a\ncomponent of Agreeableness. The third factor loads the items \"fearful,\" \"submissive,\"\n\"emotional,\" and \"dependent.\" We thus labeled this component Dominance (although it has\na component of Neuroticism). Finally, on the fourth factor we found the items \"laborious,\"\n\"intelligent,\" \"inventive,\" \"organized,\" and \"constant,\" making it a factor of\nConscientiousness with a component of Openness to Experience.\nPersonality in sanctuary-housed chimpanzees\nTable 3.

Factor intercorrelation matrix for the FFM\nFactor Extraversion Consc-Agreeableness Dominance Consc-Openness\nExtraversion -\nConsc-Agreeableness -.12 -\nDiscussion\nThis study revealed some very interesting results. First of all, the sample of\nsanctuary-housed chimpanzees presents a clear personality structure, developed with three\nfactors for the PEN model and four factors for the FFM, with acceptable standards of inter-\nobserver reliability and validity. Secondly, it has been demonstrated that the PEN model\ncan be used to measure the personality of chimpanzees in a sanctuary. The use of the PEN\nyielded an idiosyncratic factor for chimpanzees related to dominance, and a characteristic\ncompound factor of Neuroticism and Psychoticism. With the FFM, Conscientiousness was\ncombined with the Agreeableness and Openness factors, and the Dominance factor was\nvery close to Neuroticism. Finally, the results obtained with both methods in a sanctuary\nchimpanzee sample are similar to those obtained in humans.\nThe constructive validity for the data obtained in this study is expressed from the\nconvergent and discriminant validity of the factors (Campbell and Fiske, 1959).\nConvergent validity can be estimated using the magnitudes of the item loadings onto the\nfactors to which they are assigned. Regarding the 12 items evaluated for the PEN model, all\nof them loaded with values superior to .50 in the PCA, but two of them (\"fearful\" and\n\"creative\") did not load in the REFA. In relation to the 38 items evaluated for the FFM, two\nof them did not have salient loading on any of the factors, even though the ICC values were\nnot low. In any case, the overall pattern of factor loadings revealed good evidence of\nconvergent validity. On the other hand, discriminant validity has been demonstrated with\nthe factorial independence shown by the low intercorrelation values when an oblique factor\nsolution was obtained (i.e., approaching .50), and although there was a moderate interfactor\ncorrelation for each theory (.32 [PEN] and .35 [FFM]), it is important to remember that\nGrazlano and Ward, 1992) typically show at least two or three moderately high interfactor\ncorrelations.\nIt was not difficult to identify factors for both models, as most of them are similar to\nthose found in humans (see Table 5). Nevertheless, there are some distinctive features.\nWith the PEN model we found a peculiar factor that includes aspects of neuroticism and\naspects of psychoticism, which we labeled Neuropsychoticism. The PEN model also\nyielded a factor related to dominance. Although this cannot be compared with humans due\nto the idiosyncrasy of this factor for chimpanzees, the two adjectives loaded in our study\nfor the PCA (see Table 1) are the same as those in the study by King and Figueredo (1997)\nloaded under the factor that they called \"Dominance\" (see Table 5). For this reason, and in\nPersonality in sanctuary-housed chimpanzees\nspite of the fact that the REFA (see Table 1) loads just one of these adjectives (the\ndifferences found between PCA and REFA are probably due to the small sample), we also\ndecided to call the third factor \"Dominance.\" In fact, many authors have emphasized the\nimportance of intraspecific dominance in chimpanzee personality (de Waal, 1989; Freeman\nand Gosling, 2010; King and Figueredo, 1997). The factor of dominance was found by\nKing and Figueredo (1997) with the FFM and maintained in later studies (see Freeman and\nGosling, 2010, for a review). This factor (with the Extraversion factor) is one of the most\ncommonly identified in chimpanzees and gets the highest levels of inter-rater reliability and\nthe strongest validity coefficients in primates (Freeman and Gosling, 2010). With the FFM,\nwe found a factor of Dominance that was very close to the Neuroticism factor (see Table\n5), but we decided to call it Dominance because of the reasons given above. Also with the\nFFM, the factors of Agreeableness and Openness to Experience were found to have a\ncomponent of Conscientiousness. This can be explained by the fact that although all the\nother factors are generally found in animals, (Gosling, 2001; Gosling and Vazire, 2002),\nConscientiousness seems to be restricted to chimpanzees (Gosling and John, 1999). So, this\nfactor may have become part of the above factors in the specific case of sanctuary\nchimpanzees. For these reasons, we decided to call the factors: Conscien-Agreeableness\nand Conscien-Openness, respectively.\nTable 5.

For example, the adjectives \"friendly\"\nand \"affectionate\" in humans have connotations of warmth with conspecifics. These are\nrelated to the Agreeableness factor in humans (Goldberg, 1990), whereas our study in\nchimpanzees and King and Figueredo's (1997) studies with the FFM load in the\nExtraversion factor. For that reason, the top-down methodology could be controversial\nbecause it can include features that are not important or that do not include relevant aspects\nof the personality in the studied species. On the other hand, in relation to differences due to\nthe sample type, the differences found between Western and non-Western cultures in\nhuman FMM studies could be considered (Church and Katigbak, 1989; Narayanan, Menon,\nand Levine, 1995; Yang and Bond, 1990), but the differences found in chimpanzees\nassociated with sample type (King et al., 2005; Weiss et al., 2007) are more relevant. As we\ncompared our results with a zoological sample, we have to take into account that the\nsample analyzed in this study is housed in a sanctuary with naturalized enclosures and no\nexposure to visitors, so the only source of stress is the readjustment of groups. Moreover,\nthe subjects analyzed in this study had been hosted in this center since a mean age of 8.63\nyears (at the time of the study). So, we could say that they are showing personality patterns\nmore similar to wild members of the species than a zoological sample, although due to the\nscarcity of studies in this area, a comparison cannot be made. A zoological sample,\ncompared with sanctuary chimpanzees, exhibits more aberrant behaviors and fewer\nspecies-typical behaviors (Wobber and Hare, 2011).\nIn answer to the question of which model is better to assess the personality of\nsanctuary chimpanzees, we have found that both models are equally valid because both\nhighly coincide with the results obtained for humans and have high levels of total variance\nand mean reliability for the ICCs. However, it is important to emphasize the brevity of the\nPEN model in comparison with the FFM. Because of its shorter length, we believe that this\ntype of assessment would be useful in sanctuaries, where the workers cannot devote much\ntime to evaluating the personality of the subjects.\nIn conclusion, our research demonstrates the validity of the application of both of\nthe human personality models studied in related species such as chimpanzees, indicating\nthat the similarities may possibly be explained as evolutionarily conserved traits. However,\nwe want to highlight that these measures concern chimpanzees housed in a sanctuary. In\nfuture research, this type of study should be replicated and extended to include other\nsubjects housed in rescue centers, with large sample sizes, similar to those used in other\nstudies. These considerations could be very important in order to increase the ecological\nvalidity of this study and to gain further insight into chimpanzee personalities and their\nimplications for the management and welfare of these rehabilitated animals in sanctuaries.\n"
