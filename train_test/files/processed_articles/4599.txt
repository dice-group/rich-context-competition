    "abstract": "Abstract\nElectronic health records (EHRs) store health-related patient information in an electronic format, improving the quality of\nhealth care management and increasing efficiency of health care processes. However, in existing information systems, health-\nrelated records are generated, managed, and controlled by health care organizations. Patients are perceived as recipients\nof care and normally cannot directly interact with the system that stores their health-related records; their participation in\nenriching this information is not possible. Many businesses now allow customers to participate in generating information for\ntheir systems, strengthening customer relationships. This trend is supported by Web 2.0, which enables interactivity through\nvarious means, including social networks. Health care systems should be able to take advantage of this development. This\narticle proposes a novel framework in addressing the emerging need for interactivity while preserving and extending existing\nelectronic medical data. The framework has 3 dimensions of patient health record: personal, social, and medical dimensions.\nThe framework is designed to empower patients, changing their roles from static recipient of health care services to dynamic\nand active partners in health care processes.\n",

In principle, the quality of health\ncare services should be improved by electronic processing\nand the availability of medical data.1 Electronic health\n(e-health) was introduced to improve information access and\nflow, efficiency, effectiveness, and quality of health care pro-\ncesses and service delivery. E-health initiatives are progres-\nsively taking place worldwide to support efficient health care\nmanagement and business processes, and to fulfill increasing\nconsumer demand for online services.\nE-health cannot be separated from electronic health\nrecords (EHRs) or electronic medical records (EMRs), as\nessentially both are core parts of an e-health system. The pri-\nmary goal of an EHR is to make medical data available\nbeyond physical borders. However, many essential EHRs are\nstill recorded on paper or within isolated databases. Even\nmodern health care centers with advanced health information\nsystems limit access to EHRs for authorized users.2\nEHRs have evolved to become center-stage in the national\nhealth informatics strategies of most European countries and\ninternationally.3,4 Health care professionals increasingly\nneed to access details from health records to manage the safe\nand effective delivery of complex and knowledge-intensive\nhealth care, and to share this information within and between\norganizations.5 More patients are now demanding access to\ntheir EHR to an extent that permits them to actively partici-\npate in their health care management. This is becoming more\nurgent as the focus of health care delivery shifts from spe-\ncialist centers to community settings and to the patient's per-\nsonal environment.4 Health care has transformed from a\nstatic system, where patients are perceived as recipients of\ncare to an interactive and dynamic health care system that\nrecognizes patients as partners in the health care processes.\n1Universiti Brunei Darussalam, Brunei\n2Jackson State University, MS, USA\n3Zirve University, Gaziantep, Turkey\nCorresponding Author:\nMustafa Z. Younis, School of Public Health, Jackson State University, 1400\nEmail: younis99@gmail.com\nRecent developments in interactivity on the Web (Web\n2.0) mean that consumers are motivated to have better con-\ntrol of the information flowing within their social networks.\nConsumers are able to interactively converse among them-\nselves to confirm and even criticize services, products, or the\nperformance of businesses that they have experienced. Web\n2.0 has driven changes in consumer behavior in terms of\ninteraction and empowerment, enabling consumers (patients)\nin health care environments to have conversations and inter-\nactions among themselves. These patient-to-patient interac-\ntionsareaformofelectronicempowerment(e-empowerment)\nwhereby they can share, discuss, and even generate records\n(content) of their health-related activities and services pro-\nvided by their health care providers. Web 2.0 has the poten-\ntial to support better partnerships between patients and their\nhealth care providers for mutual benefits.\nThe present article aims to present a promising research\ndirection that may shape the future of health care systems.\nWe review the roles of EMRs and EHRs and propose a new\nrepresentation of health or medical data by reorganizing and\nextending EMRs with Web 2.0 features. This new represen-\ntation, electronic health object (EHO), is designed to improve\nthe extensibility of health-related data and accommodate\npatient interactivity in health care systems using the Web 2.0\nconcept. EHO uses an object-oriented approach to flexibly\nand robustly extend the existing stationary EHR to interac-\ntive health records and information. EHO comprises 3 main\nobjects: personal, which captures activities of individual\ndaily life that may directly or indirectly affect the individu-\nal's overall health status; social, which captures the patient's\nsocial networking activities; and medical, which is the emu-\nlation of conventional EMR that may consist of records of\ncheckups, outpatient treatment (O/P), and inpatient treatment\n(I/P). The next section presents the background of the study,\nfollowed by discussion of EHO. We then discuss the applica-\ntion of EHO in e-health and its contribution to patient\nempowerment. Finally, we present our EHO prototype\nRelated Work\nLike many companies, health care providers have several\nlines of business. These include medical examination, treat-\nment, prescription, marketing and health promotion, and\npharmacies. Each of these lines of business is characterized\nby a specific combination of objects. Some objects are spe-\ncific to 1 line of business; others are common to several lines\nof business. The user derives the meaning of an object from\nthe business domain of that object and from the context in\nwhich the object is used.6\nEMRs and EHRs are the foundation of e-health systems.7\nThese concepts and their extension to accommodate online\ncollaboration through Web 2.0 tools and strategies are dis-\ncussed below. We explore the adoption of Web 2.0 technolo-\ngies in health care business lines and service delivery, and\nfocus on the intersection of EMRs in e-health and potential\nuse of Web 2.0 to facilitate social networking, participation,\nand collaboration. The term Medicine 2.0 is also discussed to\nprovide a parallel for Web 2.0 in a health care organization\nenvironment.\nCurrently, the meaning of EHR is variable. As EHRs have\nmany functions and include many kinds of data, it is neces-\nsary to explicitly determine what EHR means.8 According to\nthe International Organization for Standardization (ISO),9\nEHR means a repository of patient data in digital form,\nstored and exchanged securely, and accessible by multiple\nauthorized users. An EHR contains retrospective, concur-\nrent, and prospective information, and its primary purpose is\nto support continuing, efficient, and quality integrated health\ncare.\nEMRs are defined as electronic medical data and reports\nabout patients' conditions, images, physiological signals,\ncheckups, medical treatment videos, and medical forms.10,11\nEMRs allow patient health records to be stored, updated, and\nexchanged between various medical facilities and health care\norganizations nationwide.12 The functionality provided by\nthese systems include simple patient records, elaborate\npatient management, electronic medication ordering, and\nbilling systems.13 They can improve the quality of health\ncare delivery; increase efficiency, transparency, and clarity in\nmedical records; decrease medical errors; provide easy\naccess to consolidated patient records; reduce physician\nmental workload; decrease duplication of medical tests; and\nreduce staff time in locating and extracting information from\nEMRs contain the records of a patient's health-related\ninformation generated and owned by a particular health care\nprovider, whereas EHRs contain the records of a patient's\nlong-term and aggregated health-related information gener-\nated by encounters in any care delivery setting, and stem-\nming from the interoperability of multiple providers. EHRs\nmay also contain patient demographics, progress notes,\nproblems, medications, medical history, immunizations, lab-\noratory data, and radiology reports.15\nNeither an EMR nor EHR allows patients to update and\nadd content, even though this content may be useful to help\nimprove treatment.16 Patients are therefore not sure what\nauthority they have in interacting with their health data or\nclinical records. The Web 2.0 tools, discussed below, have\nmade sharing information and content easy and fast. We\nargue that patients should be dynamically included to enrich\ninformation related to their daily activities, habits, or other\ninformation useful for their health-related records. With this\nin mind, EMRs and EHRs may be extended to allow dynamic\nWeb 2.0 concepts to be used in e-health services, meaning\ndynamic and rich content from diverse sources can be used\nto create innovative ways to view health information. We\nAlmunawar et al 3\nused an object-oriented approach to define our novel EHO\nconcept.\nThe impact of Web 2.0 technologies on health continues to\ngrow, and the term Medicine 2.0 has entered popular catego-\nrization. According to Hughes etal,17 the terms Medicine 2.0\nand Health 2.0 were similar and could be categorized by (1)\nthe participants involved (eg, doctors, patients), (2) the\nimpact on traditional and collaborative practices in medicine,\n(3) the ability to provide personalized health care, (4) the\nability to promote ongoing medical education, and (5) asso-\nciated method- and tool-related issues, such as potential\ninaccuracy in end user\u00adgenerated content.17 In comparing\ndefinitions of Medicine 2.0 with e-health, key distinctions\nare made by the collaborative nature of Medicine 2.0 and its\nemphasis on personalized health care. However, there are\ncommon elements such as health or medical education.\nMedicine 2.0 refers to the use of a specific set of Web\ntools (eg, blogs, podcasts, tags, search, wikis) by actors in\nhealth care including doctors, patients, and scientists, using\nprinciples of open source and user-generated content, and the\npower of networks to personalize health care, and collabo-\nrate and promote health education.17\nSupporting this are 5 themes that we define as follows:\n1. Participants: different stakeholders in Medicine 2.0.\n2. Method/tools: the manner in which Medicine 2.0\ninformation is created and owned (eg, accuracy of\nuser-generated information, open source or owner-\nship, and the use of specific tools such as wikis).\n3. Collaboration and practice: Medicine 2.0 as a tool to\npromote participants' interests as readers (staying\ninformed), or to communicate and collaborate collec-\ntively for their own practice.\n4. Medical education: Medicine 2.0's educational\npotential for the general public, training health pro-\nfessionals, or ongoing education for specialists\n(examining and collaboration on a particular patient\ncase).\n5. Personalized health: Medicine 2.0 as a mechanism to\nprovide customized health care, such as connecting\npatients with rare conditions and improving health\ncare value for an individual.\nSome doctors resist for their patients' to use Medicine 2.0\nto generate information as they worry about information\ninaccuracy and potential risks associated with inaccuracy,\nand privacy and ownership issues. There are some interest-\ning debates on this issue.17\nThe first debate relates to agreement on the existence of\nWeb 2.0.18 This debate has flowed into Medicine 2.0, with dis-\ncussion about terms such as Health 2.0 possibly not existing.19\nHowever, some researchers have argued that Medicine 2.0\nand Health 2.0 may be terms that have evolved for differ-\nent audiences such as academic, business, and health\nSecond, doctors' resistance to their patients' use of\nMedicine 2.0 may be due to unwanted patient behavior such\nas not consulting a physician, consulting a physician too late,\nor coming to wrong conclusions about their disease manage-\nment even if the information available to them online is\naccurate.\nThird, methods used to generate Medicine 2.0 informa-\ntion risk inaccuracy. However, in exploring specific informa-\ntion about an Internet-based cancer support group, most\ninformation was accurate and false or misleading statements\nwere rapidly corrected.21 The impact of information accu-\nracy and credibility in relation to e-health should not be wor-\nried too much as patients tend to use both intermediate\n(experts, authorities) and distributed (Medicine 2.0) informa-\ntion to make their health decisions, thereby reducing risk\nfrom inaccurate user-generated online information.20\nFinally, debate relates to the consequences of the methods\nused to generate Medicine 2.0 information. In addition to\ninformation accuracy, the nature of health information means\nthat privacy, ethical, legal, and ownership issues are critical.17\nThis also applies to doctors who may use social networking\nsites for medical education and debate.22 Overall, good mod-\nels are needed to realize the advantages promised by Web 2.0\nand develop new sources of health information sharing.\nMethods\nThe present study was conducted in 5 stages: a literature\nreview, developing a reference model, conducting a survey,\ndeveloping the prototype, and testing. The literature analysis\ninformed development of the reference model and guided the\nnext stage. In the third stage, a survey was conducted based\non the features of the reference model. The survey aimed to\nconfirm user requirements and their perspective on the fea-\ntures of the proposed model. The results of the survey were\nused to develop our prototype (Clinic 2.0) in an iterative\napproach. Finally, we tested Clinic 2.0 in a health care center\nof Indonesia. Details of the survey have been published\nElectronic Health Object\nEHRs and EMRs were developed on the basis of patients as\nsolely recipients of care with content generated by health\ncare providers. Patients or their families have no authoriza-\ntion to access this information, no means to dynamically\ncontribute to generating content, and no media to share infor-\nmation or seek opinions from other patients/health care pro-\nviders.24 As neither an EMR nor EHR allows patients to\nupdate and add new content, the records are static medical\ninformation entities with all data generated or controlled by\nhealth care providers.\nWe argue that patients should not be considered as solely\nrecipients of care, as they are partners in the whole health\ncare process because of the information and knowledge they\nhave. Patients can help themselves or at least partly self-care\nduring long-term health care processes.25 A new concept that\nincorporates this view and a new strategy to make it happen\nare necessary. Viewing patients as partners in care implies\nthat patients are empowered in a dynamic health care pro-\ncess. It means health care organizations should incorporate\npatients in generating the content of health records, which\nare considered to belong to patients or perceived as benefi-\ncial if they empower patients or their families. For example,\npatients' personal data and daily habits can be modules that\nthey are authorized to access and self-manage.\nEHO extends EHR by incorporating patients as partners\nof care, empowering them to generate content and have con-\ntrol of their own health records. Although complex, espe-\ncially in defining who and what to access, providing\ne-empowerment offers the advantage of patients (consum-\ners) becoming actively involved in their health care pro-\ncesses. EHO was developed using an object-oriented\napproach as this allowed us to dynamically expand an EHR-\nbased system with the concept of usability and extensibility.\nTo achieve our goal, we needed to redefine the objects\nand their roles within electronic information flow. The term\nobject refers to the object-oriented paradigm in information\nsystems or computer science. Objects are reusable compo-\nnents as they are independent encapsulations of state and\noperations. A reusable component is a piece of software that\nis independent of any application. A broad overview of the\nrelationship between components and objects is that each\ncomponent is an object that is not bound to a particular pro-\ngram, computer language, or implementation.26\nIn object-oriented terminology, an object class is a tem-\nplate of objects comprising attributes and operations. The\nobject class is a container for objects and used to create\nobjects; a child class inherits attributes and operations from a\nparent class. Object classes can be organized in a hierarchy\nthat shows the relationship between general and more spe-\ncific object classes. Objects communicate by sending mes-\nsages that will invoke the associated methods in other\nobjects. Figure 1 illustrates an object-oriented approach to\ndetermine objects in the class medical that focus on object\ndiseases.\nThe EHO concept views e-health activities as groups of\nobjects with embedded attributes and behaviors. The EHO\nproposes a comprehensive view of the role of the patient\nwithin an e-health system, suggesting that a patient as a part-\nner in the health care process has 3 distinct roles: an indi-\nvidual health actor, a social health agent, and as a partner in\nthe medical care process. These roles are represented in the\nsystem as object classes personal, social, and medical.\nObject class personal refers to the module (object) personal\ndaily life activity (PDLA). Object class social is represented\nby the module social life activities (SLA). Finally, object\nclass medical refers to medical activities (MA) such as\ncheckups, O/P treatment, and I/P treatment.\nIn EHO, object class medical is comparable with the con-\ncept in EMR. With this in mind, EHO proposes to extend an\nEMR by accommodating the dynamic social and personal\nroles. To understand the differences between EHR and EHO,\nTable 1 summarizes EHO concepts as distinct from EHRs'.\nEHO places e-health information exchange at the center. It\nassumes that extensive e-health services authorize patients to\npartially participate in the process of health care activities\n(PDLA, SLA, MA). Patient involvement empowers them to\nachieve health prevention, health literacy, and be able to take\nbetter action for personal health decision making.\nFigure 2 sets out the information flow in an EHO scenario\nwhere the source of information includes patient data, knowl-\nedge resource, and directory information. Patient data are\ncategorized as personal health data and personal medical\ndata. EHO proposes that personal health data and medical\ndata are synchronized to obtain a comprehensive view of\npatient data. In conventional systems, medical data refer to\nEMR and are mostly generated by health care staff.\nDistinguished personal health data differ from personal med-\nical data.27 Personal health data are the individual's personal\nhabits that may affect the overall health status of that indi-\nvidual.28 For example, eating and sleeping habits may affect\nblood pressure and the process updating this information\nmay be empowering for the individual.29 Sources of informa-\ntion from personal health data or medical data should accom-\nmodate multiple health care providers to ensure personal\nhealth data are comprehensible.\nThe knowledge resource manages the accumulation, dis-\nsemination, and distribution of comprehensive health knowl-\nedge that is accessible to users, including patients, patients'\nfamilies, doctors, researchers, and health care management.\nThe knowledge resource aims to help users stay informed\nabout the latest developments and to enable them interact,\ndiscuss, and contribute to the content of the knowledge\nresource.30 What makes EHO different is that patients are\nauthorized to access, update, post queries, or verify informa-\ntion stored in the knowledge resource. To ensure information\nFigure 1. Object-oriented approach.\nAlmunawar et al 5\nquality and reliability, an individual may contribute to the\nknowledge resource after verification of general clinical evi-\ndence, while knowledge originating from social networks\ncan be placed in different cluster to distinguish the level of\ninformation quality and integrity. The directory consigns the\nexpertise and services available to the health care organiza-\ntion to a database.\nEHO and Patient Empowerment\nThe introduction of EHO within e-health systems is expected\nto have a positive effect on health prevention and patient\nempowerment. E-health initiatives can provide effective\nself-service that empowers patients and allows organizations\nto reduce costs by handling an increasing number of con-\nsumer transactions more efficiently. There is good evidence\nthat coaching patients using e-health empowerment strate-\ngies leads to broadened, less negative definitions of illness as\nwell as improved patient self-management. However, with-\nout commitment from health care organizations, the benefits\nof empowerment are unlikely to emerge.31\nWeb 2.0 drives changes in customer behavior in terms of\ninteraction and empowerment, enabling customers (patients)\nto engage in conversations and interact with other patients.\nThis between-patient interaction is another form of empow-\nerment, as they can share and discuss health-related issues\nincluding services provided by health care organizations.32 The\nability to view medical records proposed by EHO is another\nform of empowerment that can promote self-awareness and\nmay improve health literacy.33\nEnabling patient access to their medical records may also\nsimplify requests for second opinions from other health or\nmedical practitioners, although the privacy and confidential-\nity of medical staff involved must be upheld. Social network-\ning media are another form of patient empowerment offered\nby EHO. Sharing knowledge and information in social net-\nworks provides patients or their families with knowledge and\ninformation about their health concerns. For example, patients\nwith diabetes may like to share and discuss experiences with\nother patients with diabetes, for moral support or to exchange\ninformation or experiences. Empowerment through EHO\nmay also contribute to decision making; more information\nTable 1.

In a traditional e-health system,\nobject class medical is similar to EMRs.\nObject personal consists of object identity/profile (ID),\nobject personal habits (HB), object exercise (EX), object\nemotional and spiritual (SE), object personal health plan\n(HP), object personal account (AC), and more objects\ndepending on need and urgency. Object class social consists\nof all objects related to social networking and media, includ-\ning object conversation (CS), object knowledge management\n(KM), and object resolution (RS). Finally, object medical\nconsists of activities such as objects e-appointment (EA),\nexamination (XM), treatment (TM), and e-prescription (EP).\nEach object also contains sub-sub modules. For example,\nobject XM may be composed of chronic disease (cc) and\nnonchronic disease (nc). In turn, chronic disease comprises\ndiabetes (da), cancer (ca), obesity (ob), and others. The\nobject-oriented approach allows an object to inherit attri-\nbutes and methods/operations from the parent object(s).\nHow does the model support e-empowerment? The\nobject-oriented approach helps to determine the process of\ne-empowerment. Some activities (represented as objects)\nhave embedded information and actions that can be dele-\ngated to patients and/or their families. For example, object\nclasses personal and social can be fully empowered to\npatients/families. However, the object class medical cannot\nbe fully empowered to patients/families because of the\nmechanism by which information and actions are shared,\nsuch as authorization and access control.\nFigure 3 shows an e-health service as an integrated health\ncare activity that governs personal health care processes in\nrelation to personal, medical, and social activities. The model\nsuggests that e-empowerment can be assigned to any object\nclass or at a subclass level. The circle with a solid yellow line\nindicates that empowerment has been assigned to that object,\nwhereas no circle means empowerment has not been\nassigned. A circle with a yellow dashed line indicates partial\ne-empowerment. For example, a health care provider only\ngives patients authorization to read his or her medical\nrecords.\nEHO offers a holistic view and mechanism for health care\nproviders to give e-empowerment to their customers based on\na modular approach. However, e-empowerment within the\nobject class medical needs goodwill from health care provid-\ners and may need to conform to the law that protects medical\nrecords. For instance, Australian government has introduced\na revolutionary e-health system through Personally Controlled\nElectronic Health Records (PCEHR). PCEHR supports\npatients to view their medical records; however, the ability to\nupdate medical records is strictly disabled using object-\noriented approach in Clinic 2.0. Object medical is divided\ninto 2 objects: chronical diseases and nonchronical diseases.\nFor nonchronical diseases, Clinic 2.0 empowers patients to\nupdate their medical status into the systems. For instance, in\nthe case patients get fever and influenza, they can input their\nmedical condition and their own treatment to the system. By\nlooking at those medical records generated by patients, physi-\ncians can have a broader perspective of patients' condition.\nImplementing EHO With Clinic 2.0\nClinic 2.0 is a prototype of e-health system based on EHO\nusing the Web 2.0 platform. It implements the paradigm of\nan interactive health care system where the patient is per-\nceived as partner in care.Although Clinic 2.0 does not imple-\nment complete modules as proposed in the EHO business\narchitecture (Figure 3), it offers multiway patient interaction.\nThree possible relationships involved in an e-health system\nare patient alone (patient interactions with the system),\npatient-to-patient interactions, and patient-to-health care\nprovider interactions.\nFigure 2. Information flow in EHO.\nNote. EHO = electronic health object.\nGP = general practitioner.\nAlmunawar et al 7\nPersonal objects refer to a patient's ability to have interac-\ntive sessions with Clinic 2.0 systems. Interactivity means the\npatient is able to participate in generating content and data\ninto Clinic 2.0 as well as retrieving data or content when it is\nneeded. This feature is not possible in the traditional e-health\nsystem, as the static approach views the patient as a recipient\nof care with no means of interaction with the system.\nA significant element of patient interactivity is achieved by\nenabling them to view their medical information electronically.\nObject class personal contains personal health information that\nthe patient is fully authorized to view, update, and delete at any\ntime.An individual can dynamically interact with the system to\nacquire their own health information and personal habits.34\nMedical objects enable Clinic 2.0 to support the interac-\ntion between health care providers and their patients. The\ninteractions concern with the medical activities (eg, store,\nupdate, exchange, record, retrieve, medication, ordering,\nprescription) from patient checkups, I/P or O/P treatment,\nwhere the presence of medical staff is compulsory to ensure\nthe quality and reliability of medical records. The scope and\ndimension of object class medical are limited to clinical or\nmedical treatment and activities.\nFigure 4 shows a screenshot of Clinic 2.0 consultation his-\ntory. Consultation history exists within the object class medi-\ncal. It is composed of specific fields: date, diagnosis treatment,\nhospital (place), medical staff, and action. This module is\nauthorized for health care providers or medical staff to enter\nall required information. Patients can view their consultation\nhistory but cannot change anything recorded by the health\ncare provider. In the future direction, patients will be able to\nupdate the consultation with the guidance from an online\nhealth educator. However, there must be a mechanism and\nauthentication process for information entered by patients.\nFor example, a patient seeks a second opinion from another\nhealth care provider; the result of that consultation can be\nadded to the existing record.\nFinally, social objects in Clinic 2.0 offer multiway inter-\nactions that empower patients through patient-patient con-\nversations. It is an informal means of interaction between\npatients to share experiences and discuss issues related to\nhealth care services or medical concerns. It encourages\npatients to express concerns and feelings through a channel\nprovided by the organization so that it can be part of the\nhealth care process. A health care professional or team\n(online health educator) should monitor the conversation\nprocess and provide support or assistance as needed during\nthe conversation. The presence of online health education\nwithin a conversation is important to ensure the quality of\ninformation. Online health education can deepen relation-\nships between health care providers and patients.\nFigure 3. EHO business architecture.\nNote. EHO = electronic health object; ID = identity; HB = habits; HP = health plan; EX = exercise; SE = emotional and spiritual; AC = account; EA =\ne-appointment; XM = examination; TM = treatment; O/P = outpatient treatment; I/P = inpatient treatment; EP = e-prescription; nc = nonchronic disease;\ncc = chronic disease; ca = cancer; da = diabetes; RS = resolution; CS = conversation; KM = knowledge management.\nPrivacy and Security\nPrivacy and security are the main concern in an e-health imple-\nmentation. In fact, many patients hesitate to adhere to using the\nservice if there is no guarantee of privacy and security. However,\nthe need for interconnectivity and accessibility is strong, and the\nlaw in accessing personal health information protects individuals.\nIt is challenging from the technical, organizations, and legal per-\nspectives. However, the advantages offered by e-empowerment\nare promising such as involving patients in the health care pro-\ncess, increasing efficiency in managerial tasks, and improving\nhealth awareness or health literacy of users.\nThere is no doubt that all health care professionals must\nuphold confidentiality of their patients'data. Consequently, it is\nin need of the system to meet requirements such as maximum\nsecurity, sufficient privileges for users to fulfill their respective\ntasks, and easy user maintenance. Implementing a client/server\nenvironmentovertheInternetprovidesgreatflexibility.However,\nin an e-health environment, highly sensitive information is at a\ngreater risk of being lost, manipulated, and spoofed.\nFigure 5 shows a security concept and an authorization\ndesign to meet the demands for data protection in Clinic 2.0.\nThere are 4 layers of security mechanisms to ensure all\nFigure 4. Clinic 2.0 consultation history.\nFigure 5. Security mechanism in Clinic 2.0.\nAlmunawar et al 9\naspects of activities and information is secure: first, access\nprotection given to users to access the service from the\nInternet; second, an object-oriented authorization design;\nthird, ensuring that protection is provided at a network com-\nmunication level; and, finally, log activity monitoring, rou-\ntine, and nonroutine analysis of network assessment must be\ncarried out to understand access patterns toward the\nsystems.\nConclusions\nHealth care organization is heavily dependent on\nInformation and Communication Technology (ICT) .\nMany e-health initiatives to improve health care efficiency\nand effectiveness have been widely proposed. EMR and\nEHR are 2 well-known health record systems, which have\nmany similarities and share the objective of improving\nefficiency and effectiveness of health care business pro-\ncesses through ICT. However, EHR has wider data cover-\nage than EMR, as it contains a patient's long-term and\naggregated health-related information generated by 1 or\nmore encounters in any care delivery setting stemming\nfrom the interoperability of multiple providers, rather than\nhealth-related data generated by a particular health care\nprovider.\nEHO was developed using an object-oriented approach\nthat allows usability and extensibility, meaning that EHO is\nmore flexible than EMR or EHR. Traditional EMR and\nEHR were developed on the basis of patients being sole\nrecipients of care. EHO incorporates patients as partners in\ncare, empowering them to generate content and to have bet-\nter control or access to their own health records. Social\nobjects enable patients to share their health experiences in\nClinic's social networks. Personal objects empower patients\nto generate personal health habits. Medical objects enable\npatients to view their medical records.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This\nwork was supported by Universiti Brunei Darussalam.\nReferences\n1.
