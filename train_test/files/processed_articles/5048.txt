Early works of\nPiaget showed that children learn through activity and repli-\ncation (Bresler, Cooper, & Palmer, 2001). He suggested that\ndevelopment of moral reasoning is the foundation of ethical\nbehavior. To encourage moral development, Piaget argued\nthat schools should \"should emphasize cooperative decision-\nmaking and problem solving, nurturing moral development\nby requiring students to work out common rules based on\nLawrence Kohlberg (1971) built on Piaget's foundation\nby developing the theory of postconventional morality. He\nexpanded the study of moral development to secondary-\nschool and university students, noting that moral develop-\nment took much longer to develop than Piaget originally\nIn turn, he theorized that one achieved moral develop-\nment by completing six stages of growth (see Table 1;\nKohlberg, 1975). These stages range from complete self-\nabsorption and care for nothing but one's survival, as is the\ncase in infancy, to Level 3, where one finds a balance between\nself and community (Kohlberg, 1981).Advancement through\nthese stages occurred as one developed proficiency in terms\nof self-view and worldview. This proficiency occurred\nthrough acquisition of knowledge through informal or for-\nThe increase of government activity within the realm of\nethics, beginning in the 1960s, led to an increase in academic\nresearch.

(Bowie, 1986)\nBy the 1980s, numerous universities offered coursework\nthat blended ethics theory from a philosophical standpoint\nwith business issues of the day.\nA number of studies indicated that university education\nplayed a vital role in developing ethical attitudes of business\nprimary school students who are likely to be future business\nleaders (Chai, Lung, & Ramly, 2007). To coincide with\nincreased interest in the development of ethical decision\nmaking at the college level, Crane (2004) proposed that busi-\nness students' desired increased knowledge related to ethical\ndilemmas and moral reasoning.\nTo that end, an important part of resolving ethical dilem-\nmas \"involves prioritizing one's values and being prepared\nto deal with values conflicts that might occur\" (The\nAssociation to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business\nInternational Board of Directors, 2004). Kohlberg argued\nthat the goal of education should have been personal devel-\nopment (Rest, 1986). He indicated that achieving the next\nstage of moral development should have been the goal of\neducators. Rather than teaching characteristics, such as hap-\npiness and kindness, he indicated that it was critical that\nschools aid in the learning of reasoning that resulted in just\nchoices (Power, Higgins, & Kohlberg, 1989).\nMoral Development\nMoral judgments can be defined as, \"evaluations of the\nactions or character of a person that are made with respect to\na set of virtues held by a culture or sub-culture to be obliga-\ntory\" (Haidt, 2001). Kohlberg's model of morality assumes\nthat the best way to understand moral development is to\nexamine it as a cognitive process (Thoma, 2006). Initially,\nthis understanding of morality included six stages of devel-\nopment (see Table 1) and morality was the product of ratio-\nnal, cognitive operations. Since, modifications to this original\nconception of morality have emerged. The neo-Kohlbergian\nview maintains that cognitive processes are central to the\nunderstanding of moral development; however, this outlook\nis less dependent on discrete stages and acknowledges that\nmoral development probably shifts more gradually from\nlower levels, which are governed by self-interest to more\nflexible conceptions of morality that include reciprocity,\nshared ideals, and inquiry (Thoma, 2006). According to this\nview, moral dilemmas activate \"schemas\" that originate from\nthe synthesis of previous knowledge, personal experience,\nand life events, as illustrated in Table 2.\nWhen presented with a moral dilemma, these schemas\nserve as the default program for interpretation and produce a\nmoral judgment in situations where accepted, intuitive, or\neasily recognizable codes of conduct cease to exist (Thoma,\n2006). The cognitive approach to morality presupposes that\ngains in moral development may be achieved through ethics\neducation, assuming it involves some aspect of cognitive\ntraining.\nAn alternative theory of morality points to the influence\nof humans' evolutionary history. The need to evaluate moral\ndilemmas may have preceded the advanced cognitive skill\nsets required to deliberate different points of view. Therefore,\nmoral judgments may be influenced more by emotion, than\nreason. This view is summarized by the social intuitionist\nmodel of morality. It suggests that moral judgments arise\nautomatically and the activation of a cognitive schema is sec-\nondary (Haidt, 2001). In other words, moral assessments\nstem from initial, gut reactions. In support of this view, Haidt\n(2001) presents evidence that emotional reactions were bet-\nter predictors of a person's moral judgments than deliberate\nattempts to reason. The primary difference between these\ntwo models of moral reasoning depends on the timing and\nuse of moral reasoning. To social intuitionists, moral reason-\ning occurs after the moral judgment is made; to cognitive\ntheorists, moral reasoning is used to reach the judgment.\nDisgust is a strong emotional reaction elicited by a variety\nof aversive stimuli. Interestingly, the neural substrates acti-\nvated by disgust are the same substrates presumed to be acti-\nvated by moral judgments. Across a variety of cultures,\nTable 1. Kohlberg's Stages of Moral Development.\nLevel 1. Preconventional moral reasoning\n Stage 1 Punishment\u00adobedience orientation\nRules are obeyed to avoid punishment. A good or bad action is\ndetermined by its physical consequences.\n Stage 2 Personal reward orientation\nPersonal needs determine right and wrong. An interest in others is\nconcerned for to the extent to which it aids one in reaching one's\nown needs.\nLevel 2. Conventional moral reasoning\n Stage 3 Good boy\u00adnice girl orientation\nGood is determined by what pleases, aids, and is approved by others.\n Stage 4 Law and order orientation\nLaws are absolute. Authority must be respected and social order\nmaintained.\nLevel 3. Postconventional moral reasoning\n Stage 5 Social contract orientation\nGood is determined by socially agreed on standards of individual\nrights. This is a morality similar to that of the U.S. Constitution.\n Stage 6 Universal ethical principle orientation\nGood and right are matters of individual conscience and involve\nabstract concepts of justice, human dignity, and equality.\nMcCool and Bremser 3\nsimilar facial expressions are used to express the rejection of\ndisgust-inducing physical stimuli, such as rotten food, and\nsocially inappropriate behaviors such as incest (Haidt, Rozin,\nMcCauley, & Imada, 1997). Furthermore, a study by Schnall,\nHaidt, Clore, and Jordan (2008) demonstrated that disgust-\ninducing changes in the physical environment had an impact\non moral judgments. In this study, a bad smell (induced with\nfart spray) led to more severe condemnation of consensual\nsex between first cousins and legislation that would allow\nfirst cousins to marry. On the contrary, another study by\nLiljenquist, Zhong, and Galinsky (2010) found that willing-\nness to engage in charitable behavior and reciprocity was\npromoted in the presence of a clean smell (i.e., a spray of\nWindex). There is considerable variability in tolerance to the\nconditions that elicit disgust. For example, one person may\nbe repulsed by the thought of eating monkey brains, whereas\nanother person could be excited or intrigued.\nBecause the activation of disgust is closely tied with the\nseverity of a person's moral judgment and clean, not disgust-\ning, conditions may influence reciprocal and charitable\nbehavior, it is important to understand whether individual\ndifferences in disgust sensitivity influence moral judgments.\nThese findings could have important implications for the\nteaching of ethical decision making. First, if the social intu-\nitionist model of moral judgments is correct, promoting the\ncognitive aspects of moral development through specific\ntraining in ethics may be a minimally effective means of\nimproving moral judgments and ultimately, moral behavior.\nSecond, these findings suggest that a better understanding of\nthe moment-to-moment situation and environment influ-\nences that influence morality could be used to promote cer-\ntain moral sentiments over others.\nThe purpose of the present study was to better understand\nthe role of cognition and emotion in moral awareness, spe-\ncifically in the context of ethics education. We are interested\nin the relationship between disgust sensitivity and the level\nof moral judgments made by undergraduate business stu-\ndents before and after exposure to a discipline-specific ethics\ncourse (Business Ethics) and predicted that exposure to the\nethics course will increase students' level of moral develop-\nment. In addition, we predicted that disgust sensitivity would\nbe related to moral development.\nMethod\nParticipants\nForty-five (22 male and 23 female) undergraduate business\nand management students participated in the study.\nParticipants were recruited from business courses at Alfred\nState. About 24 participants were first-semester freshman\nand 21 were seniors. All but 2 of the participants were\nyounger than 25 years of age. Participation was voluntary\nand participants were not offered an incentive for participa-\ntion. Written informed consent was obtained from each\nparticipant.\nMaterials\nThe Defining Issues Test\u00ad2 (DIT-2).The DIT-2 (Rest, Nar-\nvaez, Thoma, & Bebeau, 1999) measures individual varia-\ntion in moral judgments. Participants are presented with five\nmoral dilemmas and respond to 12 statements offering dif-\nferent views to aid the process of moral decision making.\nResponses on DIT-2 are calculated to produce a score that\nfits within the three-level, neo-Kohlbergian model of moral\njudgments: the lowest level, personal interest schema,\nreflects moral judgments that are evaluated in relation to the\ncost and benefits that may be directly experienced by the\nindividual. The second level is the maintaining norms\nschema, where moral judgments reflect values, norms, and\nrules that govern a social system. Third, the postconventional\nschema is the highest level where moral judgments operate\non shared ideals, reciprocity, and openness to inquiry.\nHistorically, participants' moral development has been\nindexed with the P-score, representing the proportion of\nitems selected that appeal to postconventional moral reason-\ning. More recently, N2 scores have been adopted as the pre-\nferred method of analysis because N2 scores estimate the\ndegree to which a participant prioritizes postconventional\nstatements, in addition to the proportion of those statements.\nIn other words, N2 scores reflect both the rating and ranking\nof postconventional moral reasoning. Higher N2 scores indi-\ncate higher levels of moral development. Both P-score and\nN2 scores tend to be in the 30s for high school seniors and in\nthe 40s for college students (Bebeau, Rest, &\nThe Disgust Scale\u00adRevised (DS-R).The DS-R is a 25-item,\n5-point, Likert-type scale that is used to detect individual\nvariation in the sensitivity to disgust. The scale is based on a\nthree-factor model of disgust that includes core disgust, ani-\nmal reminders, and contamination. It is shown to be a valid\nand reliable index of disgust, demonstrating a Cronbach's\nalpha of .87 (van Overveld, de Jong, Peters, &\nProcedures\nAll participants completed paper-and-pencil versions of the\nmeasures in a group setting first completing the DS-R, then\ncompleting the DIT-2. Freshman participants took the mea-\nsures within the first month of class during a fall semester.\nSenior participants completed the measures at the end of a\ndiscipline-specific ethics course (Business Ethics). All pro-\ncedures conformed to ethical guidelines and were approved\nby the college's institutional review board (IRB).\nResults\nRaw data for the DIT-2 were sent to The Center for Ethical\nDevelopment at the University of Alabama for scoring. One\nparticipant was purged from the analysis. Once returned, N2\n4 SAGE Open\nscores for each participant were entered into SPSS version\n19.0. Descriptive statistics are presented in Table 3.\nAn independent-samples t test was conducted to compare\nN2 scores between freshman (preethics) and seniors (posteth-\nics) with college status (freshman or senior) entered as the\nindependent variable and N2 scores entered as the dependent\nvariable. The test was statistically significant, t(43) = -2.79,\np  .01. In addition, moderate to large effect size (Cohen's\non the DIT-2. The independent-samples t test revealed that\ndisgust sensitivity scores did not differ significantly between\nrelationship between disgust sensitivity and DIT-2 scores, a\nbivariate Pearson Product\u00adMoment correlation was com-\nputed. The correlation between disgust sensitivity and N2\nscores was not significant (r = \u00ad.14, ns). This suggests that\ncollege students' moral reasoning capacities increase after\nexposure to a discipline-specific ethics course; however, dis-\ngust sensitivity had no relationship to DIT-2 scores.\nDiscussion\nWe hypothesized that students who participated in a disci-\npline-specific ethics course would achieve higher levels of\nmoral reasoning as measured by the DIT-2 than incoming\nstudents with no or limited exposure to business ethics. Our\nprediction was supported, suggesting that gains in moral\ndevelopment may be attributed to specific coursework in\nbusiness ethics. In addition, we hypothesized that individual\nvariation in disgust sensitivity would affect moral reasoning;\nhowever, this prediction was not supported. These results\nsuggest that despite previous research demonstrating that\nenvironmental conditions that elicit disgust make moral\nassessments more severe, individual differences in disgust\nsensitivity are not a significant source variation in N2 scores.\nOne interpretation of this finding is that moral development,\nas measured by the DIT-2, is more influenced by cognitive\ntraining and coursework in ethics course than by individual\npersonality characteristics, such as tolerance for disgust.\nWe used a between-subject design to assess the changes in\nmoral reasoning in undergraduate business and management\nstudents that occur as a result of a discipline-specific ethics\ncourse. Future studies using a within-subjects design that\nuses the same participants over time would strengthen the\nvalidity of our findings. Also, previous literature shows that\nDIT-2 scores increase with age. We did not control for the\neffects of age, but all but two of our participants were under\nAnother question concerns whether or not gains in moral\nreasoning are the result of the increased ability to employ\ncritical and/or analytical thinking that take place over the\ncourse of college education. In the future, a control group\nmay be required to clarify whether moral reasoning gains\nare due to the skills fostered in discipline-specific ethics\ncourses or due to a general increase in analytical and critical\nthinking skills that occur over the course of undergraduate\neducation.\nFinally, it is interesting to note that N2 scores for our sam-\nple were approximately 5 points lower than norms for under-\ngraduates (Dong, 2010). This variability may simply reflect\ndifferences between college programs; however, an alterna-\ntive explanation for this difference could be due to the order\nin which the questionnaires were presented. Both groups\n(freshman and seniors) completed the Disgust Sensitivity\nScale first. It is possible that exposure to this scale may have\nactivated the neural programs related to disgust, which may\nhave resulted in lower level moral judgments on the DIT-2.\nWe are currently investigating this possibility using a differ-\nent sample and counterbalancing the order of the\nquestionnaires.\nThe goal of this research was to identify best practices for\nethics education in business and to further aid our under-\nstanding of how individual factors, such as disgust sensitiv-\nity, can alter students' moral assessments. We found that\nspecific coursework in business ethics can produce a signifi-\ncant gain in moral reasoning. These results suggest that in the\nabsence of strong moral intuitions, discipline-specific ethics\ncoursework can lead to more postconventional moral deci-\nsion making.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nThe Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business\nInternational Board of Directors.
