Despite this mandate, child\ninjuries are replacing infectious disease as the leading cause\nof mortality in developing countries (Kozik et al., 1999).\nTherefore, as one of the principal environments where chil-\ndren spend extensive time during their formative years,\nschool safety should be effectively managed, promoted, and\nprioritized. This is reflected in the breadth of discussion,\ndebate, and literature about school safety. However in\nThailand, school safety is generally considered to be of low\npriority compared with other educational issues, with a lack\nof effective policy, and with schools struggling to justify\nsafety costs. As a result, child injury is common in Thailand,\nand according to Sitthi-amorn et al. (2006), approximately\n6,000 children die from preventable injuries each year. While\nthese injuries do not necessarily occur at school, children\nspend significant amounts of time within the school environ-\nment, and there is a growing demand for safe schools in\nThailand, along with associated parental expectations of\nsafety. Thailand has responded to child injury and mortality\nthrough appropriate legislation (e.g., mandatory use of seat\nbelts and crash helmets), but it is argued that such laws are\nnot intrinsically effective, requiring enhanced awareness and\nrobust enforcement. In response, the Thai government rec-\nommends schools play a more active role in preventing child\ninjury by managing and promoting safety. As such, the edu-\ncation system in Thailand represents a key component of\nchild injury reduction and safety promotion. However,\nThailand's school safety is geographically variable and sig-\nnificantly dependent on each individual school's resources\nand attitude toward safety. Budgetary constraints and a lack\nof clear policy or related governmental guidance are key\nissues affecting the management of safety in Thai schools.\nThe aim of this article is thus to present a framework aimed\nat improving the management of school safety in Thailand,\nspecifically through the novel application of lean thinking to\nreduce the barriers related to the cost and inefficiencies of\nmanaging and promoting safety. This article hypothesizes\nthat the concept of lean thinking, which has been success-\nfully utilized to reduce costs, waste, and improve service,\n1Baiboonlamphun School, Lamphun, Thailand\n2Chiang Mai University, Thailand\nCorresponding Author:\nPachernwaat Srichai, 127 M.2 Lamphun-Doiti Road, T.Wiangyong,\nEmail: director@baiboon.ac.th\nManaging School Safety in Thailand:\nAssessing the Implications and Potential\nof a Lean Thinking Framework\nPachernwaat Srichai1,2, Pitipong Yodmongkol2,\nPradorn Sureephong2 and Komsak Meksamoot2\n Keywords\nmanaging school safety, management barriers, educational management, Thai education, lean thinking, organizational\nprocesses, safety recommendations, child injury\n2 SAGE Open\ncould also be applied to issues of school safety. The applica-\ntion of lean thinking to school safety in Thailand has poten-\ntial to cut costs, minimize the associated management\nburden, and improve the levels of safety delivered to the rel-\nevant stakeholders.\nThe State of School Safety in Thailand and\nAssociated Management Implications\nThere are a variety of definitions of what constitutes a safe\nschool, or which aspects of school safety should be managed,\npromoted, and prioritized. For example, Hernandez, Floden,\nand Bosworth (2010) suggest a safe school is a place free\nfrom violence, and represented by an environment where\nthere is no perceived fear with respect to the school or its\ndisciplinary procedures. A general definition of a safe school\nis one that provides a positive environment, allowing stu-\ndents, teachers, staff, and visitors to interact without fear or\nthreats, and in a supportive way to achieve the educational\nmission of the school while fostering and nurturing personal\nmore practical and management-oriented elucidation of\nschool safety, stating that it includes the school's culture and\nthe appropriate training and resources to respond to threats\nand hazards. Definitions also vary according to geographic\nlocation, with U.S. school safety research chiefly focused on\nviolence and crime prevention (e.g., Heinen, Webb-Dempsey,\nMoore, McClellan, & Friebel, 2007), while the European\nperspective takes a wider viewpoint to include health, risk, a\nsafe learning environment, and lifelong learning related to\nhealth and risk (European Agency for Safety and Health at\nDefining school safety is often challenging, as the defini-\ntion can encompass a wide remit of different themes, where\nthe separation of rhetoric versus reality becomes problem-\natic, and where a key difficulty is distinguishing between\npersonal beliefs and evidence-based research (Mayer &\nCornell, 2010). The most commonly noted aspects of school\nsafety in the literature are physical, psychological, environ-\nmental, and social.\nIn terms of physical issues of school safety, violence and\nbullying are commonly discussed in the literature. For exam-\nple, in a recent assimilation of school safety data, Dunlap\n(2013) focuses particularly on school violence as the central\naspect of school safety. Literature often takes school vio-\nlence as the contextual basis for school safety research and\naims to develop response mechanisms to crises (e.g.,\nKingshott & McKenzie, 2013). The school violence litera-\nture primarily focuses on schools in the United States, where\nthe effects of recent school shootings have prompted national\ndiscussion regarding the safety of schools and wider social\nissues, including gun laws (e.g., Jones, Waite, & Clements,\n2012). As well as school violence, risk and injuries to chil-\ndren form a central precept within the school safety litera-\nture. Injuries at school are often investigated with the primary\ndiscussion and analysis aimed at reducing accidents or risk\n(e.g., Scala, Gallagher, & Schneps, 1997), but such discus-\nsion often neglects the management barriers associated with\ncreating a safe school, and does not necessarily consider the\npotential fallacy of using only accident or injury statistics to\nmonitor school safety.\nPsychologically, school safety is discussed in the litera-\nture with reference to how safe students feel at their school\n(Mooij & Fettelaar, 2013). More recently, discussions regard-\ning the feeling of being safe at school have developed into\ndebates about how safe individuals feel in terms of gender\n(e.g., Toomey, McGuire, & Russell, 2012), homosexuality\nIn terms of the school environment, road safety predomi-\nnates the literature and represents an important subset of\nschool safety research. This is a particularly important issue\nin developing countries--For example, Hidayati, Liu, and\nMontgomery (2012) focus on traffic flows as a key part of\nimproving school safety in Indonesia, while John, John, and\nBose (2012) illustrate that road safety and school transport in\nIndia are a leading cause of injury. Others (e.g., Parusel &\nMcLaren, 2010) suggest that focusing on road safety creates\nan illusion of a safe school and ignores wider safety issues at\nschool. This represents a key tenet of school safety literature,\nwhere specific problems are often identified and analyzed,\nbut without consideration of the wider problem. For exam-\nple, focusing on school safety is unrealistic for schools in\ndeveloping countries where efforts are primarily centered on\nraising educational standards.\nAs well as road safety, the school and its buildings are\nconsidered instrumental to creating a safe school. A key con-\ncept of invitational education theory (Purkey & Novak,\n1996) suggests that the school should be an inviting place\nacross a set of five key areas (people, place, processes, poli-\ncies, and programs). In response to this, attention has often\nfocused on creating a safe school environment, including the\nschool's buildings and surroundings (e.g., Stanley, Juhnke, &\nPurkey, 2004). In relation to this, a small subset of school\nsafety literature investigates school safety in the context of\nnatural hazards, but this usually relates to specific geographic\nlocales, for example, in Taiwan, where typhoons are a com-\nmon occurrence (e.g., Chen & Lee, 2012). Shaw and\nKobayashi (2001) suggest that schools can be used as a way\nto reduce the wider impact of natural hazards, and focus on\nIndia, Nepal, Indonesia, and Uzbekistan. Linking the schools\nwith their communities is often investigated in terms of its\nimpact and relationship with safety and violence in the wider\ncommunity (Ozer & Weinstein, 2004). There is strong evi-\ndence that the safety of a particular school cannot be taken in\nisolation, and is inseparable from the surrounding commu-\nnity (Kitsantas, Ware, & Martinez-Arias, 2004).\nThe common aspect of school safety in the literature is its\ndiversity ranging from the school's environment to commu-\nnity violence, natural hazards, and the psychological effects\nSrichai et al. 3\nof bullying. The diversity represents a challenge, particularly\nfor schools where the concept of school safety is nascent.\nThe issues with school safety research and literature are\nhighlighted by Furlong, Morrison, Skiba, and Cornell (2004),\nwho suggest that school safety research can only progress by\ndeveloping a core literature to critically assess the methods,\nmeasurement, and analysis of school safety. In keeping with\nthese assertions, the research in this article aims not to\nrecount the specific safety problems experienced by schools\nin Thailand but rather to develop a new way of thinking\nabout school safety and how best to manage it given the con-\ntext of budgetary constraints and raised awareness in\nThailand about the need for safer schools.\nAlthough a variety of school safety definitions exist, in\nthis research, the remit of school safety relates to the physical\nwell-being of the pupils, the school environment, and road\nsafety. If all these factors are fulfilled, a school might be\njudged as being safe (The Center for the Protection of\nChildren's Rights Foundation, 2007). However, achieving all\nthree aspects of school safety represents a considerable chal-\nlenge with far-reaching management implications.\nIn Thailand, school safety lacks suitable guidance in the\nform of governmental policy and is geographically frag-\nmented, with safety effectiveness highly dependent on the\nschool's location, leadership, and financial status. In addi-\ntion, educational priorities in Thai schools are focused pre-\ndominantly on academic achievement as opposed to issues\nof safety, which are largely considered as peripheral and less\nimportant aspects of education. Although academic attain-\nment is regarded as a decisive factor determining educational\nquality, United Nations Children's Fund (2009) argues that\nchildren have the right to learn in a safe and healthy environ-\nment, and thus, governments have a clear obligation to pro-\nvide such environments through appropriate frameworks,\nguidance, and legislation.\nThailand's political focus over the past decade has been\nfirmly on economic development, which resulted in the\nrecent upgrade of its economic status from lower-middle to\nupper-middle income economy (World Bank, 2011).\nHowever, the focus on economic development has not\nresulted in parallel upgrades to the education system, and\naccording to Hewison (2012), Thailand faces a shortage of\nskilled labor, a lack of innovation, and an education system\nthat has continuously failed to deliver quality schooling. The\nresult is a persistent focus on raising academic, vocational,\nand technical skill, but a lower prioritization of issues such as\nschool safety. For example, in 2009, the Thai Ministry of\nEducation (MoE) launched an economic stimulus package\nfor education (MoE, 2009), and of 11 key projects, including\nteacher development, school quality, and school improve-\nment, there was no specific mention of promoting safety, of\ndeveloping and managing the school environment with\nregard to the health and safety of pupils. The focus of this\n54,000 million baht economic stimulus was primarily aimed\nat generating economic benefits for Thailand via the educa-\ntion system (MoE, 2009). This highlights Thailand's focus in\npursuing what it considers core aspects of education, while\nlargely ignoring the critical aspects required for safety man-\nagement and promotion in schools.\nThe lack of ubiquity in Thailand's approach to school\nsafety means variance in the management and quality of\nsafety at local, regional, and national scales. This is partly\ndue to governmental decentralization in Thailand and the\nresulting dependency on individual provinces to effectively\nmanage education, which has meant school safety policies\nand guidelines are fragmented, and rely mainly on the stance\nof local administrative organizations. For example, Article\n24 of Thailand's 2003 Child Protection Act states that district\nheads have a duty to protect children living within their juris-\ndiction, and the associated responsibility to inspect schools\nin terms of safety. As part of the same Act, Article 63 states\nthat schools must provide guidance and training to promote\nsafety, yet in reality, this is not common.\nAccording to the EU-OSHA (2009), four functional com-\nponents affect the management of school safety. These com-\nponents are shown in Table 1 along with an assessment of\nThailand's current position in achieving these based on a\nreview of the literature and policies in this area.\nTable 1. Components of Managing a Safe School Along With Thailand's Corresponding Status.\nComponents of management leading to a safe school Thailand's current position\nAppropriate and dynamic legislation to facilitate the\nappropriate management of safety.\nWeak guidelines with no direct or explicit policy to promote\nsafe schools; a laissez-faire attitude and decentralization of\nresponsibility to provincial authorities.\nEffective management of communication between all\nsafety stakeholders (e.g., parents, students, staff, and\ncommunity).\nHighly variable and dependent on individual schools, including\ntheir management, finance, and relationship with the local\ncommunity.\nA safe environment achieved through effective school\npolicy, which is designed, understood, and enforced by\nschool leaders.\nHighly variable and dependent on the individual school.\nCurriculum management to include safety as part of\nlifelong learning.\nThailand recognizes the importance of lifelong learning (e.g.,\nSomtrakool, 2002), but not in terms of safety.\nSource: Adapted from Garcia (2010) and European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (2009).\n4 SAGE Open\nTable 1 indicates that in terms of safety, Thai schools suf-\nfer from a lack of government policy as well as fragmented\nand variable assistance from local administrative organiza-\ntions. This means they must autonomously manage and\ndesign their own school-level policies and approach to safety,\nbut often lack appropriate knowledge, experience, and moti-\nvation. In ventures to remedy this, external organizations and\nNGOs have attempted to promote and improve school safety\nin Thailand. For example, The Alliance for Safe Children\n(TASC) has implemented a safe school project to manage\nsafety and reduce child injury, while the United Nations\nInternational Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR)\nlaunched the One Million Safe Schools initiative (UNISDR,\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, there is also a significant differ-\nence in the safety approach between public and private\nschools in Thailand. Private schools often use safety as a\ndifferentiating factor when attracting new parents and stu-\ndents, and in a competitive market environment, schools\nmust attract students to achieve sustainability (Smith,\n1994). When choosing a private school, parents often visit\nto explore the school, search for information about its edu-\ncational quality, and pay considerable attention to safety\n(Trump, 2012). The school selection process within the pri-\nvate education sector thus provides an additional financial\nimpetus to ensure safety. However, school safety can be\ncostly in terms of resources, time, and processes, making\nsafety an unattractive proposition for schools. The biggest\nbarrier to effective school safety for public and private\nschools in Thailand is the creation of an effective manage-\nment program to address safety. School safety is often over-\nlooked due to the significant management barriers and\nburdens, including cost, efficiency, organizational strain,\nand bureaucracy. In terms of cost, Hull (2010) argues from\nthe global perspective that budget cuts represent one of the\nbiggest threats to safety in educational environments. This\nis particularly so for Thailand while attempting to balance\nconflicting demands on its education system (Witte, 2000).\nBased on a literature review and in-depth interviews with\n15 leaders from schools in northern Thailand, seven key\nmanagement barriers to effective safety were identified in\nThai schools, which are illustrated in Figure 1, and\ndescribed in the corresponding sections.\nThe seven management barriers are key issues requiring\nattention if schools in Thailand are to effectively implement\nand sustain a focus on safety. Each of the seven components\nis described independently, but in reality, they are inextrica-\nbly linked.\nFinancial Implications.\nManaging safety has considerable\nfinancial implications, in terms of the intrinsic cost of safety-\nrelated activities in the school, and the opportunity cost of\nspending on safety, versus other school needs, such as staff\nor academic development. The relatively intangible nature of\nrisk minimization and effective school safety adds to the\nfinancial burden, and schools would often prefer to spend in\nmore visible ways. This is particularly true for private\nschools where attracting parents and students is critical to the\nschool's sustainability.\nTime.Managing safety in schools requires a significant\ninvestment in time. This is set against a backdrop of existing\ntime constraints faced by school leadership, staff, and\nteachers.\nLeadership.Developing appropriate safety strategies and\ndisseminating these throughout the school require strong\nand committed leadership to promote safety and motivate\nall stakeholders in alignment with the safety strategy and\npolicy.\nCommunication.Communicating safety issues throughout\nthe school is an important aspect of creating and managing a\nsafe school. Such communication requires appropriate man-\nagement and strategy to ensure the perception of safety is not\none of burden, but a realization of its vital importance to all\nstakeholders.\nStakeholder Understanding. Effective safety requires the com-\nmitment and participation of all school stakeholders. While\nsome stakeholders (e.g., parents) will be more willing to\nalign themselves with safety policy, others (e.g., leaders and\nstaff) may not fully understand the justification for safety, or\nmay feel it adds to their workload.\nFigure 1. The seven management barriers to effective safety in\nThai schools.\nSrichai et al. 5\nCulture.Risk taking and safety policies vary according to\nnational cultures (Hofstede, 1991) and the Thai culture\ntoward safety is markedly different from other, more devel-\noped countries. While there is a well-established health and\nsafety culture in Europe and the United States, the notion of\nhealth and safety in Thailand is still relatively nascent. This\noften means school management faces resistance when\nattempting to implement safety in a culture where it is not\ntraditionally considered important or necessary.\nCommitment. The six management barriers presented so far\ncontribute to the issue of commitment. Effective safety\nrequires the commitment of all involved and achieving such\ncommitment is a substantial management challenge.\nTogether, these seven management challenges create inef-\nficiencies, waste, and costs for management when attempt-\ning to design, implement, and transform the school's\napproach to safety. A need therefore exists to research and\ndevelop new ways of approaching and managing school\nsafety. The research in this article suggests that a lean think-\ning management approach could be used to develop, imple-\nment, and transform school safety from a bureaucratic and\ninefficient process to a streamlined, sustainable, and value-\nadding school activity.\nLean Thinking to Improve School Safety\nTo reduce the inefficiencies, waste, and cost associated with\nschool safety, this article proposes a framework based on\nlean thinking. Lean thinking tools emerged from lean manu-\nfacturing, which is an automobile-manufacturing process\npioneered in Japan during the 1980s and now utilized by\norganizations globally. While lean manufacturing is quintes-\nsentially associated with industry, and the physical produc-\ntion of goods, lean thinking is a more recent philosophy with\nproven credibility as a process reengineering methodology\n(Radnor, Holweg, & Waring, 2012). The result is that lean\nthinking has been adopted in a number of scenarios to reduce\nwaste, cut costs, and increase efficiency. Most notably, the\nliterature has indicated that lean thinking can have signifi-\ncant impacts in health care settings, often being adopted in\nhospitals to improve patient care while reducing the costs\nand waste associated with providing quality health care (e.g.,\nhealth care research and practice, along with the general\naims of eliminating waste and improving satisfaction, is\ncompatible with school safety, where waste could be reduced\nand the satisfaction of parents and students could be\nimproved. Furthermore, the way in which a school is run in\nterms of administration and internal climate directly affects\nThis research illustrates by way of a case study, how\nschool safety can be approached and managed in Thailand\nusing the principles of lean thinking to cut waste and improve\nsafety-related processes. The article reports on progress\ntoward developing an effective and efficient method to pro-\nmote and manage school safety at a primary school in north-\nern Thailand.\nCase Study and Method\nPrior to outlining the case study details, it is necessary to\njustify the selection of a case study approach as opposed to\nother research methods.Although safety at school can be dis-\ncussed from a conceptual or theoretical perspective, the\nnature of school safety is intrinsically practical, with a need\nto gather empirical evidence-based data (Astor, Guerra, &\nAcker, 2010). Coupled with the practical aspects of school\nsafety, lean thinking is commonly an applied endeavor, with\npractical application being frequently reported in the lean\nthinking literature (Arlbj\u00f8rn & Freytag, 2013). The inher-\nently practical and applied aspects of school safety and lean\nthinking, along with the lack of information regarding school\nsafety in Thailand, suggested that a case study approach was\nmost effective.\nFigure 2 shows the location of the case study, which is a\nprivate school in northern Thailand approximately 30 min by\ncar from Thailand's largest northern city (Chiang Mai). The\nschool has been operational for 25 years, and aside from a\nhigh-quality education, parents expect their children to be\nFigure 2. The case study school and relative proximity to\nThailand's largest cities.\n6 SAGE Open\nsafe. The school runs kindergarten and primary-level educa-\ntion programs and is well known among parents in its catch-\nkindergarten and 969 primary students, and 98 teachers and\nadministrative staff, safety is a significant issue of concern\nfor the school and its reputation.\nProductivity in the service sector trails manufacturing by\na significant margin (May, 2005) and the application of lean\nthinking beyond manufacturing is being considered and\ninvestigated by a wide variety of sectors and organizations.\nThe concept of lean thinking as applied to school safety\nrelates to the three main aspects affecting safety management\nin the school (operations, finance, and people), and the three\ncorresponding aspects of lean thinking, which derive from\nthe Japanese words mura, muda, and muri. Muda is the cen-\ntral precept, which represents waste, and in relation to school\nsafety correlates mainly to financial aspects of school safety,\nsuch as wasted resources or budget. Mura refers to uneven-\nness (Manuele, 2007), and in terms of managing school\nsafety, refers to the unevenness in the practical and opera-\ntional aspects of safety. For example, there might be incon-\nsistencies in the way safety policies are implemented. Finally,\nmuri refers to strain (Radnor et al., 2012), and in transposing\nthe term to school safety, represents the organizational strain\nin managing safety from the perspective of all the key stake-\nholders (parents, students, teachers, and staff). For example,\nmuri relates to the additional workload teachers might face\nwhen implementing school safety policies or processes. In\nreality, these components are interlinked and can be applied\nholistically to improve safety at the school, as shown in\nThe focus in this article is the application of lean thinking\nto manage safety-related suggestions in the school. Currently,\nthe school operates a safety recommendation/suggestion sys-\ntem whereby safety-related suggestions or recommendations\nare elicited from stakeholders (parents, teachers, and staff)\nvia a variety of sources (e.g., Facebook, email, and tele-\nphone). The focus on the safety recommendation/suggestion\nsystem reflects the fact that safety suggestions are the most\ntangible and visible aspect of school safety, and represent a\nkey communication interface between all stakeholders. An\neffective safety suggestion system also has the potential to\nraise awareness and promote safety. In future research, the\nremit of lean thinking is likely to move beyond the school\nsafety suggestion system to create a framework encompass-\ning all aspects of health and safety at the school.\nFigure 3. The three components of lean thinking (mura, muda, and muri) as they relate to the key aspects of managing and promoting\nsafety at the school.\nSrichai et al. 7\nThe practical application of a lean thinking approach to\nmanaging safety suggestions required a series of steps,\nincluding assessing current safety performance and issues,\nmapping the current value stream, identifying improvement\nopportunities, and then mapping the future value stream. A\nconceptual overview of the methods used at the case study is\nillustrated in Figure 4.\nStep 1 of the method consisted of knowledge acquisition\nfrom the three key aspects of the school's safety, namely,\nfinance, people, and operations. Data provided a snapshot of\nthe school's current safety status to determine areas where\nimprovement was required, and where lean thinking can\nmake significant impacts. All financial, operational, and\nsafety data were collected over the three most recently avail-\nable school semesters, including the second semester of 2010\nand the first and second semesters of 2011. Following knowl-\nedge acquisition, and in line with the principles of lean think-\ning (Womack & Jones, 2003), the next stage of the method\nwas to specify value, which aimed to identify the value\nwithin each aspect of finance, operations, and people, par-\nticularly in terms of enhancing safety or safety awareness for\nthe school and students. Once the value had been specified,\nthe next step involved mapping the current value stream\nrelated to managing and promoting safety in the school.\nValue stream mapping is a lean technique to create a holistic\nview of the processes and activities involved in managing\nand promoting safety at the school. Value stream mapping is\na common aspect of lean thinking and is used as a diagnostic\ntool to improve financial and nonfinancial performance\nwhile enhancing resource allocation and satisfaction (Comm\nValue stream mapping facilitates a sorting process to distin-\nguish between activities and processes that enhance safety at\nschool, those that do not directly affect safety but are required\nand therefore cannot be eliminated, and finally, those that\nadd zero value to safety at school, and can thus be immedi-\nately eliminated. This sorting leads to the identification of\nimprovement opportunities before the final step of creating a\nfuture state value stream map, which then acts as a safety\nimprovement program. The key steps to replicate the method\nare first, the collection of appropriate school safety data, sec-\nond, the creation of the current state value stream map, and\nthen the creation of a future state map. The gap between the\ncurrent state value stream map and the future state map iden-\ntifies the necessary steps required to create improvements.\nWhen collecting safety data regarding people, teachers\nand parents were questioned about their opinion of safety at\nthe school. It was important to collect teachers' views on\nsafety, as they have an increasingly important role to play in\nassessing and reporting on the school environment (Brand,\nFelnerb, Seitsingera, Burnsa, & Bolton, 2008). Teachers and\nparents answered the same set of questions to ascertain their\nFigure 4. The steps applying a lean approach to managing school safety.\n8 SAGE Open\nopinions of safety at the school and to identify the type of\nhazards or safety issues that most concerned them. In total,\n93 teachers and 750 parents responded to the questionnaire.\nData regarding the operational aspects of safety were col-\nlected from three sources: the school's accident record\nbooks, an interview with the school's management to iden-\ntify the current state of safety, and an identification of any\nkey issues or hazards reported by parents. Financial data\nwere collected via an analysis of the school's safety expen-\nditure and the subsequent success rate of the implemented\nsafety suggestions.\nThe analysis of people, financial, and operational aspects\nof school safety facilitated the creation of a current state\nvalue stream map, which was then validated by school's\nmanagement, including the director, manager, and senior\nteaching staff. Finally, the current state value stream map\nwas assessed to identify improvement opportunities suitable\nfor integration into the future state value stream map, which\nwas then applied at the school.\nResults\nCurrent Safety Scenario and Management at the\nSchool\nInitial data collection revealed that parents were concerned\nabout safety at the school. The most commonly described\nissues related to the play equipment, tripping hazards, and\nbuilding materials in communal outdoor areas. Road safety\nduring the school pick-up and drop-off times was also\nreported as a common issue. Figure 5 illustrates a sample of\nthe frequently reported hazards at the school.\nDespite numerous hazards in the school, parents and\nteachers were generally positive when categorizing the\nschool's safety status. Figure 6 shows results from the ques-\ntionnaire given to parents and teachers, which asked the\nquestion, \"To what extent do you consider the school to be\nsafe?\"\nAs shown in Figure 6, the majority of teachers and parents\nconsider the school safe, with approximately 74% of teach-\ners and 55% of parents judging the school as \"safe\" or \"very\nsafe.\" Overall, teachers responded more positively than par-\nents, with few teachers (4%) considering the school \"very\nunsafe\" or \"not safe.\" Approximately, 16% of parents felt the\nschool was either \"very unsafe\" or \"not safe,\" and a signifi-\ncant proportion (29%) remained neutral, deeming the school\n\"neither safe nor unsafe.\"\nThe survey identifies a discrepancy between teachers'\nand parents' perceptions of school safety. Perceptions of\nschool safety can have significant impacts on the reality of\nschool safety (Welsh, 2000), and it is therefore important\nthat parental and teacher perceptions of school safety are\nbrought into alignment. The lean approach to school safety\nin this article encourages this through more effective com-\nmunication about safety issues and a real improvement in\nsafety efficiency and effectiveness, which is then reflected\nin parental perception.\nAs expected, teachers were more positive than parents,\nfeeling ownership and responsibility for the school environ-\nment. This is corroborated by Jimerson and Furlong (2006),\nwho illustrate that there is a strong relationship between\nschool safety and the way teachers are perceived. While par-\nents were generally positive, if those parents who answered\n\"neither safe nor unsafe\" are added to those who answered\n\"very unsafe\" or \"not safe\" nearly half of parents could be\nconsidered as not satisfied with safety at the school. The pro-\nposed lean approach would therefore have the dual benefit of\nnot only enhancing safety in the school but also promoting it\namong parents thus increasing their opinion of safety.\nTable 2 shows that the average accident rate over three\nsemesters was 2.3%. The majority of accidents were catego-\nrized as relating to physical well-being. While the accident\nrate appears relatively low, in keeping with the schools'\ndesire to develop a proactive rather than reactive approach to\nsafety and maintain its reputation, the low rate does not rep-\nresent a reason to be complacent. Furthermore, a traditional\nlean concept is Six Sigma (Kwak & Anbari, 2006) meaning\na target of less than 3.4 defects per million. In this sense, the\naccident rate of 2.3% per semester could be reduced, although\nthe differences between school safety incidents and manu-\nfacturing defects would preclude the achievement of Six\nSigma in a school safety scenario.\nAs noted previously, the focus of the research is initially\non applying lean thinking to manage the safety suggestions\nbeing provided to the school. Table 3 shows the various\nchannels currently used by parents and staff to deliver these\nsuggestions as well as the number of suggestions and success\nrate. Successful suggestions are defined as those, which have\nbeen implemented and remain in place at the school over a\nperiod of 3 months or more. If multiple suggestions were\nreceived for the same incident, these were still counted sepa-\nrately, as each suggestion requires management input\nwhether acted upon or not. Also, one of the aims of the lean\napproach is to assist the school in cutting the burden associ-\nated with excessive safety-related communication. The num-\nber of suggestions and average success rate of only 33%\nhighlights the need to cut waste and improve efficiency.\nFigure 7 indicates that as a percentage of the total school\nbudget, safety currently represents between 3% and 5% of\nthe budget, averaging 3.2%. In comparison, the U.S. schools\nspend approximately 5% of their school budget on safety\n(Chase, Coffee-Borden, Anton, Moore, & Valorose, 2008).\nThe key point regarding school safety expenditure is that it is\nrelatively low when compared with other budgetary catego-\nries (e.g., teachers and staff) and therefore maximum value\nmust be extracted from any safety expenditure. Maximizing\nvalue of this budget can be achieved through the application\nof lean thinking and by value stream mapping. With this\nintention in mind, the current value stream map at the school\nis shown in Figure 8.\nSrichai et al. 9\nApplying Lean Thinking to School Safety\nAccording to the current value stream map shown in Figure 8,\nfor each safety suggestion or recommendation received, there\nare six steps before possible implementation at the school.\nThere is a processing time of 9 days and 1 hr, but an actual\nwork time of only 85 min. The process begins with sugges-\ntions from parents, teachers, or staff being passed to teachers,\nthe safety manager, or the school director. The received sug-\ngestions must then be reported to the school safety manager,\nwho in turn reports to the school director. The time taken for a\nsafety suggestion to reach the school director can be up to 24\nhr. Once suggestions have been received, they are discussed at\nthe weekly school management meeting, which could be up to\n7 days from the time the suggestion is received.\nDiscussion of each suggestion at the weekly meeting is\nrelatively short, but there is often an overload of suggestions\n(see Table 3), and pressure on time. This makes it difficult to\nFigure 5. A sample of frequently reported hazards at the case study, including (A) hazards in commonly used areas, (B) hazards relating\nto building work in the school, and (C) tripping hazards and road safety.\nFigure 6. Parents' and teachers' views on safety at the case study.\nNote: Teachers, n = 93. Parents, n = 750. Response rates: parents = 60%,\ndistinguish between valuable and nonvaluable suggestions.\nOnce a decision is made to implement a particular safety\nsuggestion, the process can be relatively slow, with no dedi-\ncated personnel to take responsibility for implementation.\nAccording to the concepts of muda, muri, and mura, the fol-\nlowing areas of weakness were discovered, along with cor-\nresponding opportunities for improvement.\nMuda.A lack of standardized reporting procedures means\ntime is wasted in receiving and reporting safety issues or\nsuggestions. The lack of effective procedure also results in\nadministrative delays and associated costs. Multiple commu-\nnication channels are also costly and wasteful to manage and\nmaintain with respect to safety.\nMuri. The biggest issue with regard to organizational strain\nis an overload of safety suggestions and the corresponding\ntime and resources required to sort effective from ineffective\nsuggestions. Strain also exists in communications between\nschoolteachers/staff and parents, mainly due to the wasteful\nuse of time, and lack of procedure mentioned in the category\nof muda.\nMura. Key issues with unevenness are the variable treatment\nof the reported suggestions, the variance in the decision-\nmaking process when considering whether to pursue a sug-\ngestion, and the lack of procedure or personnel to implement\nuseful suggestions.\nThe future value stream map, based on the weakness in cur-\nrent value stream (Figure 8), and opportunities for improve-\nment are shown in Figure 9.\nThe expectation is that the 9 days and 1 hr processing time\ncan be reduced to 4 hr through lean process reengineering.\nThe new aspects of the safety suggestion system based on the\nlean management principles of muda, muri, and mura analy-\nsis are as follows:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 A new standardized procedure to manage the report-\ning of safety suggestions has been created to stream-\nline the reporting process, and cut down the time\ntaken to pass suggestions to the relevant individuals in\nthe school. Rather than the school director being the\nfinal step in the reporting chain, a flatter hierarchy has\nbeen created, with multiple individuals receiving\nsafety suggestions as part of a team. The two key\nTable 3.

Safety expenditure over three semesters.\naspects of muda that have been eliminated are waste\nand delays when receiving suggestions, as well as the\nelimination of multiple delays during reporting\nthrough the chain of command.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 The newly created team that receive safety sugges-\ntions are also capable of assessing and making deci-\nsions regarding the feasibility of implementation. This\nassessment and decision making is based on a prede-\ntermined set of criteria, as shown in Figure 10.\nIncreasing the speed of decision making is important\nso the school becomes proactive rather than reactive\ntoward its safety. The creation of the new team and\nrelated decision-making criteria reduces muri (or\norganizational strain).\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 The final aspect relates to reducing the unevenness\n(mura) associated with making decision and imple-\nmenting safety suggestions. The newly created team\nand decision criteria constitute one method to reduce\nunevenness, while the other is a dedicated member of\nstaff responsible for the implementation of any safety\nsuggestions. This reduces the previous uncertainty\nand lack of task ownership associated with too many\nindividuals taking on safety-related tasks.\nFigure 10 illustrates a key aspect of lean implementation\nat the school, which is a procedure to help standardize and\nspeed up safety-related decisions. Safety suggestions\nreceived by staff must first be assessed in terms of the value\nthey provide and in line with the principles of lean. The\nvalue must be visualized before asking whether the sugges-\ntion meets a set of safety goals/criteria at the school. If not,\nthe suggestion is rejected, while if it does meet these goals,\nthe physical, operational, and financial constraints are con-\nsidered using the guiding ideas of muda, muri, and mura.\nThis allows the safety suggestion to be implemented, modi-\nfied to remove any constraints, or rejected. This decision-\nmaking process has been trialed in the school and shows\npreliminary success in speeding up decision making. The\nprocess is also consistent in dealing with safety suggestions\nand reducing the administrative burden. Parents are also\nable to understand that their suggestions/recommendations\nare being appropriately, fairly, and consistently addressed\nand, more importantly, in a timely fashion. This has\nimproved safety communication and parental satisfaction at\nthe school.\nThe future state value stream map and decision criteria for\nthe safety suggestions have been implemented in the school\nfor a period of 3 months. Initial reports based on a school\nsafety assessment before and after the implementation of the\nlean strategy show success. The school director and other\nmanagement used a checklist to assess five aspects of school\nsafety, pre and post lean implementation. The results are\nsummarized in Table 4, along with a qualitative assessment\nof the school's current status in these areas.\nFigure 9. The future value stream map and opportunities for improvement.\nThe pre and post lean assessment in Table 4 shows signifi-\ncant improvement in certain areas of safety, most notably in\ninformation sharing and parent/community involvement.\nThis is due to the flatter hierarchy, standardized reporting\nprocess, and improved decision making. The assessment\nindicates that lean has significant potential for the school to\nmaximize the value of its safety budget, improve safety pro-\nmotion, and enhance parental perception of safety at the\nschool. While the initial focus of the research has been the\nsafety suggestion system, the school is planning to expand\nthe application of lean to ensure all aspects of school safety\nbenefit from the lean approach. Some might argue that the\napplication of a philosophy originating in the car manufac-\nturing industry to a school environment is misguided, or\ninappropriate, but the auto industry has been, and remains,\nfundamental to the way organizations and individuals oper-\nate in terms of living, working, and thinking (Womack,\nJones, & Roos, 1990). Despite the potential of a lean\napproach to school safety, there are a number of significant\nmanagement implications.\nManagement Implications\nThere are a number of key management implications when\nattempting to apply a lean framework to school safety. These\nimplications arise during the design, testing, and implemen-\ntation of the lean framework, and finally, the transformation\nof the school to become a lean organization.

Table 5 illustrates these manage-\nment implications, which are discussed according to each\nstage of the lean development process.\nDesign and Testing\nWhen designing and testing a lean approach to school safety,\nthere are a number of significant management implications.\nThe process of designing a new approach to safety puts strain\non the school's leadership and adds to an already heavy bur-\nden. There is also a degree of uncertainty adding to this\nstrain. Management are likely to ask questions such as \"Will\nthis work?\" or \"Will it save money?\"\nIn addition, a period of intensive knowledge capture is\nrequired to gather appropriate data for the development of\nthe lean approach. For example, in this research, school man-\nagement questioned 750 parents and analyzed the resulting\ndata. This represents significant data capture and analysis for\nthe school.\nImplementation\nDuring the implementation of a lean approach, there are a sig-\nnificant number of management implications and barriers.\nPerhaps most demanding from a management perspective is\nthe resistance and anxiety toward change, which is experi-\nenced by staff and teachers in the school. Management must\nbe prepared to justify the program and get staff cooperation to\nensure success and sustainability of the program. Stakeholders\nare critical to organizational processes (Henning, Buckle-\nHenning, & Hyland, 2012), and therefore management must\nensure commitment from all stakeholders.\nThe typical issues associated with turning theory into\npractice also affect the implementation of a lean safety pro-\ngram. For example, while lean thinking is entrenched in\nmanufacturing, the application of lean to improve school\nsafety is novel, and has not been widely investigated. The\nresulting management implication is that existing theories\nand practical tools do not fit the context of school safety\nwithout appropriate modification and adaptation.\nTransformation\nOnce the lean framework is implemented at the school, there\nare still significant management implications. These relate to\nthe continuing transformation of the school and its safety\nprogram after the implementation of lean. There is often a\ntendency for staff to return to old habits, and management\nmust continue to champion the importance of the new lean\nprogram in transforming school safety. This difficulty may\nbe compounded by the relatively intangible results, or the\nlong timescales before the benefits of lean become evident.\nTraining may also be required as it can significantly affect\norganizational success (Dermol, 2012). Thus, school leaders\nface critical management implications when attempting to\nsustain organizational change within the school.\nConclusion and Wider Context\nSafe home, safe school, safe community (The Alliance for\nSafe Children [TASC], 2006) is often recounted as a mantra\nto impart the fundamental importance of child safety in each\nof these domains, with children spending significant time at\nschool during their formative years (Frumkin, Geller, &\nRubin, 2006). As a result, schools have a responsibility to\nprovide a safe and healthy environment, yet while education\nis considered a fundamental human right (United Nations,\n2012), in the determination to achieve education for all,\nWisner et al. (2009) argue that children in developing coun-\ntries are being put at risk.\nSchool safety means different things to different people\nand varies across national and international scales. While\nschool safety is considered a critical issue, it is mediated and\ntempered by geography, culture, and perhaps more impor-\ntantly, the budget available to a school. Safe schools are usu-\nally those with an effective leadership along with an\nappropriate strategy and vision for a schoolwide approach to\nsafety. Safe schools should ensure the well-being of their\nTable 5.

Therefore, school safety in Thailand has\nbecome a significant issue, which is affected by weak govern-\nmental guidance and policy, along with a focus on educational\nattainment rather than issues deemed as peripheral. The atti-\ntude and approach to school safety vary widely across\nThailand, with private schools often using safety as a differ-\nentiating factor. The biggest barriers to promote and achieve\neffective school safety relate to management, and involve\ncost and bureaucracy, which are two key targets of lean think-\ning. Lean thinking represents a powerful opportunity to\nresolve the issues of school safety, and offers the opportunity\nto cut waste, bureaucracy, and nonvalue-added tasks to ensure\nsafety is efficient and not a burden on a school's budget.\nResearch in this article has used a case study to outline the\ncurrent safety scenario and has illustrated some of the key\nsafety issues at a primary school in northern Thailand. The\napplication of a lean management approach to maximize the\nsafety budget, increase parental involvement, and ultimately\nlead to a safer school is an effective way to tackle the issue of\nschool safety in Thailand. Future work will focus on adapt-\ning the lean framework and providing a generalized model of\nbest practice, which other schools in Thailand can follow to\nimprove their safety management. The ultimate aim is to pro-\nmote safety in Thai schools, tackle the issue of child injury in\nThailand, and do so while operating with limited manage-\nment resources. This is set against a backdrop where child\nsafety is often viewed as a peripheral and low priority aspect\nof education.\nInternationally, school safety is a significant area of\nresearch, and goes beyond the issue of safety per se. Schools\nthroughoutAsia have issues with safety, and according to Han\n(2008), these can also have significant impact on academic\nachievement. Research in this article suggests that addressing\nschool safety is not necessarily one of cost, but more impor-\ntantly, a question of how to effectively manage school safety.\nWhile the issue of school safety varies internationally, and\neven more so at regional and local scales, the effective man-\nagement of safety could help reduce this variability. In more\ndeveloped countries, school safety is also an issue of consid-\nerable debate and most often in relation to juggling an already\nstretched budget to address pressing safety issues. The lean\nthinking approach has already been demonstrated in a variety\nof settings to effectively tackle issues of cost, inefficiency,\nand waste, but so far has not extended to educational manage-\nment. The main conjecture from the research in this article\nindicates that lean management tools might be an effective\nway to address issues of safety not just in Thailand but any\nschool where cost, bureaucracy, waste, and inefficiencies\nplague management processes.\n"
