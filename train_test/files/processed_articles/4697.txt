The debate, in part, centers on the criteria\nused to determine the head of a structure. In addition, the\ntypes of the head, whether semantic, syntactic, or morpho-\nlogical, are a topic for debate among linguists (Allen, 1978;\nto the fact that compounding is one of the most common\nword-formation processes cross-linguistically, determining\nthe position of the head is of substantial importance. In this\nstudy, I explore the notion of headedness in Arabic1 com-\npounds within the Construct State/Synthetic Genitive\nConstruction (SGC), taking into account the existing discus-\nsion in the relevant literature.2 In particular, the study aims to\nprovide answers to the following research questions:\nResearch Question 1: Where is the head located in N +\nN compounds and Adj + N compounds in Arabic?\nResearch Question 2: What are the types of head in N +\nN compounds and Adj + N compounds in Arabic?\nResearch Question 3: Does the position of the head in N\n+ N compounds and Adj + N compounds confirm the gen-\neralization that Arabic is predominantly left-headed?\nThe examples of Arabic compounds within SGC (see\n\"Applying Headedness Criteria toArabic Compounds Within\nthe SGC\" section) used in this study were collected from\ndifferent sources: (a) Arabic books discussing the SGC (e.g.,\nAl-Jurjaani, 2004), (b) the relevant literature on SGC (e.g.,\nArabic newspapers (e.g., Al-Ghad), and (d) my intuition as a\nnative speaker of Arabic. More than 500 examples were col-\nlected, and these were categorized into compounds and\nphrases based on whether the relationship between the two\nelements is based on possession. In other words, all genitive\nconstructions were excluded, since they are regarded as\nphrases, rather than compounds (see Altakhaineh, 2016a,\npp. 6-7). For word limitation reasons, only 36 examples were\ndiscussed and analyzed in this study.\nThe study proceeds as follows: \"Headedness\" section pro-\nvides an overview of the concept of headedness, discussing\nthe main proposed criteria of headedness. \"Applying\nHeadedness Criteria to Arabic Compounds Within the SGC\"\nsection uses the criteria to identify the position and type of\nthe head in Arabic compounds within the SGC. \"The\nImplications of the Headedness Criteria\" section discusses\nthe implications of the headedness criteria on Arabic\ncompounds.

According to Zwicky (1985), determining\nthe head relies on the idea that in any syntactic construct, one\nelement governs or dominates the rest of the elements within\nthat construct. However, there has been considerable debate\nars argue that a unanimous definition of what exactly a head\nmay be attainable (e.g., Hudson, 1987), while others disagree\nnition of the head stems from the problems facing linguists\nwhen dealing with syntactic constructs. For instance, if the\nphrase the dog is interpreted to mean a dog classified as a\ndefinite object, then the determiner, that is, the, appears to be\nthe governing element. On the contrary, if the same phrase is\ninterpreted as a definite object, which is classified as a dog,\nthe governing element may be the noun, that is, dog. Arcodia\nmorphology; these are discussed in detail in the \"Headedness\nCriteria in the Previous Literature\" section.\nIn spite of such difficulties, there is a certain amount of\nconsensus about the headedness of many syntactic and mor-\nphological constructs. In fact, languages are often divided\ninto two main types in terms of the position of the head. A\nlanguage is considered head-final when the head element is\nusually or always placed in a final position, whereas head-\ninitial languages tend to place the head element in an initial/\nleft position. Using this criterion, Johannessen (1996) sug-\ngests that Arabic is a head-initial language. The same point is\nArabic as well as Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). However,\ndiscusses the position of the head in Arabic compounds.\nThus, this study aims to bridge this gap by examining the\nhead in Arabic compounding to determine whether com-\npounds are left- or right-headed.\nWith regard to English compounds, Williams (1981, p.\n248) claims that the head of a complex word in English is\nalways the right element, formulated in his famous right-\nhand head rule. Later, Selkirk (1982) proposes that the loca-\ntion of the head, in general, is a parameter, that is, it can be\neither the left or the right element of the word in a language.\nIn a sample of 36 languages, excluding Arabic, the overall\npreference in nominal compounds is for right-headedness\nVietnamese and Mandarin, both left-headed and right-headed\ncompounds can be found, which means that the parametric\napproach is insufficient to account for the position of the\nThe next section aims to shed more light on the definition\nof headedness, both cross-linguistically and in Arabic. It pro-\nvides a discussion of previous work on headedness in the\nrelevant literature, by examining the criteria discussed by\nseveral scholars on what makes a certain element the head of\na construct, and then applies these criteria to compounds in\nArabic. The aim is to determine the position of the head in\nArabic compounds and to identify its properties.\nHeadedness Criteria in the Previous Literature\nMany criteria relevant to determining the head of a particular\nconstruct are discussed by Zwicky (1985). He proposes that\nthe notion HEAD needs to capture the intuition that, in cer-\ntain syntactic constructs, one element will dominate the rest\n(Zwicky, 1985, p. 2). He examines the following eight crite-\nria to identify an element as a syntactic head:\n1. The head is the semantic argument, which means that\nthe element called \"the head\" has a meaning that acts\nas an argument to a functor (predicate modifier or\nconnective). From a formal semantics viewpoint, a\nfunctor is \"a sign that attaches to one or more expres-\nsions of given grammatical kind(s) to produce an\nexpression of a given grammatical kind\" (Quine,\n2. The head is the element with which other constitu-\nents must agree, that is, it is the determinant of\nconcord.\n3. The head is the element which is marked with mor-\nphosyntactic features that indicate the syntactic rela-\ntions between the construct as a whole and other\nsyntactic units in a sentence. In other words, the head\nbears the inflections.\n4. The head is the element that selects its sisters, that is,\nit is the subcategorizand.\n5. The head is the governor, which means that it can\ndetermine or select the morphological form of its sis-\nter on the tree. For instance, in a V + NP construct,\nthe governor V assigns a morphological case to its\nsister NP.\n6. The head is the element which has the same distribu-\ntion as that of the whole construct, that is, it is the\ndistributional equivalent.\n7. The head is the obligatory element, in the sense that\nif it is removed, the whole construct must be\nrecategorized.\n8. From a dependency theory perspective, the head is\nthe element on which other elements rely in a depen-\ndency analysis.\nPublication of this list in Zwicky (1985) sparked some\ndebate about the correctness of some of these criteria and\nthe possibility of adding further criteria (see in particular\nHudson, 1987). The consensus view that developed is\nAltakhaineh 3\nsummarized in Bauer (1990), who also points out that \" . . .\nalthough these criteria are neatly collected in the two arti-\ncles mentioned, they do not originate there: the criteria\nhave been widely discussed in earlier literature on the sub-\nject\" (pp. 2-3). Among the earlier scholars who addressed\nthe notion of headedness are Bloomfield (1935), Marchand\nmary of past research on headedness criteria is provided\nbelow:\n1. A phrase is a hyponym of its head. Hudson (1987)\ncalls this a \"kind of\" relation. This principle was orig-\nit as the \"IS A\" condition. This condition suggests\nthat the whole compound denotes a subclass of the\nconcept that the head denotes.\n2. The head is the subcategorizand; it is the item that\nselects its sisters.\n3. The head is the governor.\n4. The head is the distributional equivalent of the whole\nphrase.\n5. The head is the obligatory element in the phrase.\n6. The head is the \"morphosyntactic locus.\"\n7. The head is lexical (rather than phrasal).\nThe above-mentioned criteria can be used to identify the\nhead in a phrase and have been adopted to identify the head in\na compound (e.g., Arcodia, 2012). However, some of Bauer's\n(1990, pp. 2-3) criteria may not be valid to identify the head in\n(the head is the governor) and 7 (the head is lexical) are not\nAlong these lines, Arcodia (2012) notes that \"it should be evi-\ndent that the characterization of heads is partly different for\nderivation and compounding\" (p. 370). However, the structure\nof Arabic compounds, especially those formed in compliance\nwith the SGC, is quite different from that of English com-\npounds. This means that some criteria which are inapplicable\nto English compounds may, in fact, be applicable to Arabic\nones. In the next section, I therefore use all of the seven criteria\ncompiled by Bauer (1990) to identify the head within a com-\npound in Arabic. I group the seven criteria under three broad\ntypes, that is, semantic (Criterion 1), syntactic (Criteria 2-5),\nand morphological (Criteria 6-7). In the next section, I apply\nthe above criteria to Arabic compounds within the SGC.\nApplying Headedness Criteria to Arabic Compounds Within the SGC\nanalysis in which he suggests that a SGC compound can be defined as a complex word that consists of at least two adjacent\nwords, and where the second element is normally non-referential. Altakhaineh (2016a) also notes that the second element of a\ncompound within the SGC is not, in most cases, freely pluralized, as in the following examples:\n(1) findaan -aay-i\ncup the-tea-GEN\n\"the tea cup\"\n(2) aruus l-bar-i\nbride the-sea-GEN\n\"the mermaid\"\nlit. the sea bride\n(3) qawiyy l-qalb-i\nstrong the-heart-GEN\n\"a brave person\"\nlit. the one with the strong heart\nAltakhaineh (2016b, p. 277) also identifies types of compounds other than the SGC, suggesting that N + N compounds other\nthan the SGC, Adj + Adj compounds and reduplicated compounds can be either semantically double-headed or headless:\n(4) ilu-un murr-un\nsweet-NOM bitter-NOM\n\"bitter-sweet\"\n(5) sabaa-a masaa-a\nmorning-ACC evening-ACC\n\"all day long\"\n4 SAGE Open\n(6) layla-a nahaar-a\nnight-ACC daytime-ACC\n`twenty-four seven'\nIn this study, I focus on the headedness of compounds within the SGC (see Examples 1-3).\nN + N Compounds\nThe semantic criterion. The semantic criterion of headedness is in essence simple: it states that the head of a compound is the\nelement that determines the semantic category of the whole compound, making a compound a hyponym of its head (Lieber,\n2010, p. 178). For instance, in English, the word pole in flagpole is the head, since a flagpole is a hyponym of pole (Bauer,\n2009, p. 348). In Arabic N + N compounds, the left element is usually the head, since it denotes a hypernym of the whole\ncompound, as in Examples 7 to 9:\n(7) xaatam l-almaas\nring the-diamond\n\"the diamond ring\"\n(8) muallim l-fiizyaa\nteacher the-physics\n\"the physics teacher\"\n(9) mudiir l-madrasah\nprincipal the-school\n\"the school principal\"\nOn the basis of Allen's (1978) principle, it is clear that\n(10) xaatam lalmaas \"the diamond ring\" IS A xaatam \"ring\"\n(11) muallim lfiizyaa \"the physics teacher\" IS A muallim \"teacher\"\n(12) mudiir lmadrasah \"the school principal\" IS A mudiir \"principal\"\nExamples 10 to 12 show that the left element is a superset of the whole compound, identifying them as endocentric com-\npounds. However, there are also exocentric compounds and those do not denote a type of the left element, as shown in\nhouse the-stairs\n\"the stairwell\"\nbride the-sea\n\"the mermaid\"\nlit. the sea bride\nIn Examples 13 and 14, bayt ddarad \"stairwell\" is not a type of bayt \"house\" and aruus lbar \"mermaid\" is not a type of\naruus \"bride.\" Because Arabic compounds can be either endocentric as in Examples 7 to 9 or exocentric as in Example 13\nand Example 14, it is necessary to recognize that the \"IS-A\" criterion cannot always be applied. But when it can, it always\npoints to the left-hand element being the head in N + N combination within the SGC.\nThe syntactic criteria. The first syntactic criterion addresses the notion of subcategorization in relation to headedness. In this\nAltakhaineh 5\nIn some constructions, one slot has a special status in that the items that can fill that slot must be listed in the lexicon, while its sister\nconstituents are not so constrained. These are instances in which one constituent is SUBCATEGORIZED with respect to its ability to\noccur with a particular set of sister constituents. (p. 5)\nThe notion \"subcategorizand\" has been subject to a wide debate, especially in relation to Determiner Phrases (DPs). For\ninstance, Arcodia (2012, p. 373) notes that it is not clear whether, in the phrase these black boxes, the noun boxes or the demon-\nstrative these is to be considered the subcategorizand (cf. Zwicky, 1985, pp. 5-6). It may be suggested that the determiner is\nthe subcategorizand, as it is well known that determiners are lexically subcategorized; they can combine with singular count\nnouns (e.g., cat), plural count nouns (e.g., cats), or mass nouns (e.g., sugar). In fact, currently, several scholars (Abney, 1987;\nChoi, 2014; Siloni, 1997) in the generative tradition would regard the determiner (these, a demonstrative) as the head of the\nprevious example these black boxes, which is termed DP, rather than NP.\nWith respect to compounding, in the endocentric English compound hairstyle, the right-hand element, that is, style is the\nsubcategorizand, since it (i.e., the head) selects the non-head (Arcodia, 2012, p. 373). Arcodia (2012) adds that \"the definition\nof head in endocentric compounding is closer to that of syntactic head\" (p. 373); this would indicate that this definition works\nwith neither exocentric compounds nor coordinating compounds.\nIn Arabic, the left element of the compound selects a set of elements to accompany it, as in Examples 15 to 17:\n(15) muallim l-fiizyaa\nteacher the-physics\n\"the physics teacher\"\nteacher the-arts\n\"the arts teacher\"\n(17) muallim t-taariix\nteacher the-history\n\"the history teacher\"\nIn Examples 15 to 17, the left element muallim \"teacher\" selects the type of words that can occur with it. In the above\nexamples, these are subjects which the teacher teaches, that is, lfiizyaa \"the physics.\" lfann \"the arts,\" and ttaariix \"the\nhistory.\" Therefore, the head muallim \"teacher\" is the subcategorizand, because it selects its sisters, which are in this\ncase school subjects. Note that this selection is due to the fact that the left element teacher has the verb teach inside it.\nHowever, if we take the example sikkat ladiid \"the iron railway\" in Example 13, the right element is a modifier which\nsometimes cannot be selected by the head, that is, when it is an adjunct. This means that the criterion does not work in\nthis case.\nrail the-iron\n\"the iron railway\"\nThe second syntactic criterion is that the head is the governor (excluded by Arcodia, 2012, as it does not apply to English\ncompounds). In MSA compounds (Jordanian Arabic [JA] has no case markings), the left element can have any case, such as\nnominative, accusative, or genitive on the basis of the function of the whole construct in the sentence, whereas the right ele-\nment is always in the genitive case, as exemplified by Examples 19 to 21:\n(19) qaabala-ni muallim-u l-fiizyaa-i\nmet-me teacher-NOM the-physics-GEN\n\"The physics teacher met me.\"\n(20) qaabalt-u muallim-a l-fiizyaa-i\nmet-I teacher-ACC the-physics-GEN\n\"I met the physics teacher.\"\n6 SAGE Open\n(21) taaddat-u ma muallim-i l-fiizyaa-i\ntalked-I with teacher-GEN the-physics-GEN\n\"I talked with the physics teacher.\"\nIn Example 19, the left element muallimu \"the teacher\" has nominative case (as it is the subject); in Example 20, it has accusa-\ntive case muallima \"the teacher\" (being the object); and in Example 21, it has genitive case muallimi \"the teacher\" (as\nrequired by the preposition ma ). On the contrary, the right element is always genitive in all examples. This can be accounted\nfor by saying that the head N governs its sister, assigning it as a genitive case.\nThe third syntactic criterion is that the head is the element which has the same distribution as that of the whole construct. For\nexample \" . . . V is the distributional equivalent of V + NP, since the distribution of V + NP is roughly the same as the distribution\nof Vs like write and vanish . . .\" (Zwicky, 1985, p. 12). For English, the head is the element that determines the syntactic category\nof a compound such as high school, which is syntactically a noun like school (Lieber, 2010, p. 178). However, it is very difficult\nto identify which element of the compound is responsible for determining the syntactic category of the whole N + N compounds\nin both English and Arabic, as both elements are nouns. Examples from Arabic are as follows:\nking the-jungle\n\"the lion\"\n(23) findaan l-qahwah\ncup the-coffee\n\"the coffee cup\"\nThe fourth syntactic criterion to identify the head is the obligatoriness of an element within the compound. This means that if\nsuch an element is omitted, the outcome will be ungrammatical depending on the nature of the sentence. For instance, Bauer\n(2009, p. 348) suggests that the word pole, in the compound flagpole, is obligatory, because pole can be used, but not flag,\nwithout changing the meaning. In Arabic, the left element of a compound is obligatory, as in the following examples:\n(24) (a) raayt-u muallim l-fiizyaa\nsaw-I teacher the-physics\n \"I saw the physics teacher.\"\n(b) raayt-u l-muallim / raayt-u muallim-a-n\n saw-I the-teacher / saw-I teacher-ACC.INDF\n \"I saw the teacher.\" / \"I saw a teacher.\"\n(c) * raayt-u l-fiizyaa\nsaw-I the-physics\n *\"I saw the physics.\"\n(25) (a) kasart-u findaan l-qahwa\n broke-I cup the-coffee\n \"I broke the coffee cup.\"\n(b) kasart-u l-findaan / kasart-u findaan-a-n\n broke-I the-cup / broke-I cup-ACC-INDF\n \"I broke the cup.\" / \"I broke a cup.\"\n(c) *kasart-u l-qahwa\n broke-I the-coffee\n \"I broke the coffee.\"\nLooking at Examples 24 and 25, the obligatory element is clearly the left element in the compounds mentioned above.\nExamples 24b and 25b show that the left elements can stand on their own, whereas Examples 24c and 25c demonstrate that the\nright elements cannot be used on their own, resulting in an ungrammatical sentence. Note, however, in the case of\nAltakhaineh 7\nnon-compositional compounds, both elements are equally important to convey the meaning of the whole compound; neither\nof them can be deleted, as shown in Example 26:\n(26) (a) qaabalt-u raaid l-fadaa\nmet-I pioneer the-space\n \"I met the astronaut.\"\n(b) ?qaabalt-u r-raaid / qaabaltu raaid-aan\n met-I the-pioneer / met.I pioneer- INDF.ACC\n lit. \" met the pioneer.\" / \"I saw a pioneer.\"\n(c) *qaabaltu l-fadaa\nmet.I the-space\n lit. I met the space.\nExample 26b demonstrates that the first element can be used on its own, but the meaning of the whole compound is totally lost.\nOn the contrary, Example 26c shows that, in addition to losing the meaning of the whole compound, the second element does\nnot normally stand on its own. Note, however, that the grammaticality versus the ungrammaticality of what remains after the\nfirst element of the compound is deleted relies heavily on the context of use. This can be illustrated with the following\nexample:\n(27) (a) uubb-u muallim t-taariix\nlove-I teacher the-history\n \"I love the history teacher.\"\n(b) uub-u l-muallim\nlove-I the-teacher\n \"I love the teacher.\"\n(c) uub-u t-taariix\nlove-I the-history\n \"I love the history.\"\nIn Example 26, deleting the left element results in a semantically anomalous sentence, whereas deleting the right element\nyields a grammatically meaningful sentence even though the meaning of the whole compound is lost. On the contrary, in\nExample 27, if either of the elements is omitted, the sentence would remain grammatical. This means that this criterion does\nnot yield a clear result here. The head alone will always be acceptable in any context where the entire compound is acceptable,\nwhereas the non-head alone is only sometimes acceptable in the some contexts. For instance, muallim ttaariix \"the history\nteacher\" denotes someone like the left element, that is, muallim \"teacher\" rather than the right element, that is, ttaariix \"the\nhistory,\" which denotes \"a subject to be studied at an academic institution.\" Therefore, it seems that this criterion is closely tied\nto the first criterion, in which the whole compound is a hyponym of the head.\nAnother interesting observation with regard to the obligatoriness criterion is that, in certain contexts, the left element which\nis supposed to be the head on the basis of Criteria 1, 2, and 3, can be omitted. This observation has been noted in particular\ncontexts such as those related to news headlines. Examples of such cases are illustrated below:\n(28) fi aal assarra l-ayaan ala mawqifih min\nin case insisted the-senators on stand.MSG from\nt-tadiilaat . . .\nthe-amendments . . .\n\"In case the senate insisted on its stand regarding the amendments . . .\"\n(29) n-nuwwaab yuqirr adadan min\nthe-parliament members passed.MSG.PERF a number of\nmawaadd qaanuun t-tanfii\u00f0\n8 SAGE Open\narticles law the-implementation\n\"the parliament has passed a number of articles pertaining to the implementation law.\"\n(30) l-muallimiin tatawaad al\u00f0neebaat ma qtiraab l-fasl\nthe-teachers threaten.MSG Althneebaat with approach the-term\nd-diraasiyy\nthe-academic\n\"the teachers (union) threatens Althneebaat (the Minister of Education) with the approach of the \nacademic term.\"\nIn Examples 28 to 30, the left elements madlis \"council,\" madlis \"council,\" and niqaabah \"union\" of the compounds madlis\nlayaan \"the senate,\" madlis nnuwwaab \"the parliament,\" and naqaabat lmuallimiin \"the teachers union\" are deleted, respec-\ntively. Only the right element remains to refer to the institution which the members, that is, senators, parliament members, and\nteachers work in/represent. The deletion can be observed if one examines the cross-referencing marked on the element which\nfollows the compounds. In Example 28, the singular resumptive pronoun on the word mawqifih \"stand\" refers to the singular\nellipted antecedent madlis \"council.\" In Examples 29 and 30, the resumptive pronouns marked on the verbs, that is, yuqirr \"has\npassed\" and tatawaad \"threatens\" refer to the ellipted antecedents madlis \"council\" and niqaabah \"union,\" respectively.\nThe phenomenon in which the people stand for or refer to the whole institution in which they work or represent is called\nmetonymy. In the context of newspapers, one may find instances in which one element of the compound is deleted, provided\nthat the other element which is not deleted can compensate for the loss of the omitted element. Another interesting aspect of\nthese metonymic compounds is that the left element is the one which is omitted, rather than the right element. This may indi-\ncate that the right element is indispensable, whereas the left element is not, at least in relation to metonymic compounds. The\ndeletion of the left element may take place for verbal economy purposes. That is, instead of repeating the two elements\nthroughout the news article, it would be more economical if the whole compound is mentioned at the beginning only once, then\nin the remaining sections, the author could delete one of the elements. Note, however, that such ellipsis is not possible with\nother compounds, as in the following examples:\n(31) * muallim l-fiizyaa aaib laakin l-kiimyaa aadir\nteacher the-physics absent but the-chemistry present\nIntended: \"the physics teacher is absent but the chemistry teacher is present.\"\nIn English compounds too, deletion of the head sometimes takes place in some cases. Bauer, Lieber, and Plag (2013, p. 479)\nnote that several compounds that consist of two elements lose the right element, becoming metonymic expressions, for exam-\nple, chair for chairperson, business for business class, Tasman for Tasman Sea, the Tate for the Tate Gallery, and vacuum for\nvacuum cleaner. They also suggest that the semantic outcome of this type of ellipsis in compounds appears to be similar to the\nmetonymy that occurs in syntactic ellipsis, for example, the House for the House of Representatives or that which takes place\nwithout ellipsis, for example, Washington for the government in Washington.\nThe morphological criteria.The first morphological criterion to determine the head in a compound is the \"morphosyntactic\nlocus.\" In Arabic compounds, the morphosyntactic locus seems to be the left element. First, pluralization has always been used\nto identify the head (Bauer, 2009, p. 348). An example from English is schoolboy, which consists of school and boy and has\nthe plural schoolboys, based on the head boys. In Arabic, the left element of the compound is the one marked for number and\n(32) (a) waraq-at l-imtiaan\n paper-FSG the-exam\n \"the exam paper\"\n(b) awraaq l-imtiaan\n paper.FPL the-exam\n \"the exam papers\"\nAltakhaineh 9\n(33) (a) aruus l-bar\n bride.FSG the-sea\n \"the mermaid\"\n lit. the sea bride\n(b) araais l-bar\n bride.FPL the-sea\n \"the mermaids\"\n lit. the sea brides\nExamples 32 and 33 demonstrate that plural awraaq \"papers\" and araais \"brides\" are the heads of the compounds\nawraaq limtiaan \"the exam papers\" and araais lbar \"the mermaids\" on the basis of the left element. In Arabic N\n+ N compounds, the right element normally appears in the singular form, with a few exceptions where the right element\nof the compound is always plural, as in Examples 28 to 30 and the compound raiis lwuzaraa \"the prime minister\" (see\nIn addition, the morphological gender can be used to demonstrate how the morphological locus can be determined, as in the\nfollowing Arabic compounds:\n(34) (a) raiis l-wuzaraa\n president.MSG the-minister.MPL\n \"the male prime minister\"\n(b) raiis-at l-wuzaraa\n president-FSG the-minister.MPL\n \"the female prime minister\"\n(35) (a) aabir s-sabiil\n passer by.MSG the-path\n \"the male passerby\"\n(b) aabir-at s-sabiil\n passer by-FSG the-path\n \"the female passerby\"\nThe left element of the above examples is the morphosyntactic locus, as it inflects for gender. In Examples 34 and 35, the femi-\nnine form is raiisat lwuzaraa \"the female prime minister\" and aabirat ssabiil \"the female passerby,\" with no changes to\nthe right element of the compound.\nHowever, in some compounds, the gender and plurality tests fail to determine the head, as in Examples 36 and 37:\n(36) ayn-u s-samaa-i\neye-NOM the-sky-GEN\n\"the sun\"\n(37) yawm-u l-isaab-i\nday-NOM the-judgment-GEN\n\"judgment day\"\nFor semantic reasons, these compounds cannot be marked either for number or gender. In such cases, a further morphological\nproperty, that is, case, can be used to determine the position of the head:\n(38) ayn-u s-samaa-i damiil-at-un l-yawm\neye.FSG-NOM the-sky.FSG-GEN beautiful-FSG-NOM the-day\n\"The sun is beautiful today.\"\nThe adjective damiilatun \"beautiful\" agrees with the word aynu \"eye\" in case, both being nominative. Thus, the case test\nhere identifies aynu \"eye\" as the head. If the head was the noun ssamaai \"the sky,\" the adjective damiilah should inflect\nfor genitive case, but this is ungrammatical, as shown in Example 39:\n(39) *ayn-u s-samaa-i damiil-at-in l-yawm\neye.FSG.NOM the-sky.FSG-GEN beautiful-FSG-GEN the-day\n\"The sun is beautiful today.\"\nThe case test criterion thus looks fairly reliable for determining the morphosyntactic locus of compounds in Arabic. Note that\nthe case test cannot be applied in JA, as it has no case marking system. Therefore, if the plurality and gender tests are also\ninapplicable, the morphological locus criterion cannot be used to determine the head in JA.\nThe second morphological criterion, pertaining to the head being lexical rather than phrasal (Zwicky, 1985, p. 5), has been\nexcluded by Arcodia (2012), as it does not apply to English compounding. However, this criterion does apply to Arabic com-\npounds, as the left element is lexical, whereas the right element can be phrasal, as in Examples 40 to 42 and many of the earlier\nexamples:\n(40) mawqif l-aafilah\nstop the-coach/bus\n\"bus stop\"\nhour the-zero\n\"the last hour\"\nhouse the-stairs\n\"the stairwell\"\nIn Examples 40 to 42, the left elements, mawqif \"stop,\" saaah \"hour,\" and bayt \"house,\" are lexical items, whereas the right\nelements laafilah \"the coach,\" ssifr \"the zero,\" and ddarad \"the stairs\" consist of the determiner l- \"the\" and the lexical\nitems aafilah \"coach/bus,\" sifr \"zero,\" and darad \"stairs.\" Simply put, the right elements are DPs, consisting of DET + N.\nThis criterion thus seems to lend support to most of the above-mentioned criteria, by which the left element is usually shown\nto be the head in Arabic compounding.\nTo sum up, seven criteria have been applied to N + N compounds in Arabic to identify the head. Despite a few limitations\nof some of the criteria, it is clear that the head is the left element inArabic N + N compounds, which supports the generalization\nthat Arabic is a predominantly head-initial language. The next section discusses the types of head in Arabic Adj + N com-\npounds in relation to the above-mentioned criteria.\nAdj + N Compounds\nIn this section, the headedness criteria discussed above are applied to Adj + N compounds in Arabic to identify the position\nof the semantic, syntactic, and morphological heads. Semantically, Allen's (1978, p. 11) condition does not apply to Adj + N\ncompounds, because adjectives do not form super/subsets. With regard to the syntactic criteria, the first criterion concerning\nsubcategorization, does not apply either. Adjectives cannot be shown to be heads, as they do not select their sisters, that is,\nnouns. Second, the left element is the governor; it can be nominative, accusative, or genitive based on the function of the\nwhole compound in the sentence, whereas the second element is always genitive, as in Example 43:\n(43) (a) qaabala-ni asan-u l-xuluq-i\n met-me good-NOM the-manner-GEN\n \"The one with good manners met me.\"\n(b) atarim-u asan-a l-xuluq-i\n respect-I good-ACC the-manner-GEN\n \"I respect the one with good manners.\"\n(c) amal-u ma asan-i l-xuluq-i\n work-I with good-GEN the-manner-GEN\n \"I work with the one with good manners.\"\nThird, concerning the distributional equivalent criterion, the left element qawiyy \"strong\" is an adjective, while lbunyah \"the\nbody\" is a noun. The lexical category of the whole compound is a noun. This may suggest that the head is the right element,\nwhich determines the syntactic category of the whole compound. However, Examples 44 and 45 may suggest that the adjective\nqawiyy \"strong,\" which is the left element, is nominalized:\n(44) amal-u ma qawiyy l-bunyah\nwork-I with strong the-body\n\"I work with the one strong in body.\"\n(45) taaddayt-u qawiyy l-bunyah\nchallenged.I strong the-body\n\"I challenged the one strong in body.\"\nHowever, I would argue that the adjective qawiyy \"strong\" has not been nominalized; it remains an adjective, modifying a\nsilent noun. This argument is supported by G\u00fcnther's (to appear) analysis of English and German data. G\u00fcnther argues that the\nadjectives in noun phrases such as the rich, the poor, the impossible, and so on have not been nominalized but are still adjec-\ntives which modify an implicit noun.\nBefore discussing such implicit heads, G\u00fcnther (to appear) points out a difference between phrases like the innocent, the\nguilty, and the impossible, which have a default reading as referring to people or abstract concepts (called the \"Human/Abstract\nConstruction\" or \"Nounless Noun Phrases\"), as in Example 46, and ellipted noun phrases as in Example 47:\n(46) Just as the innocent should not be punished, so the guilty should be made to pay.\nThe fact remains, however, that the challenger whose record is 19 wins and nine defeats has lost four of his last\nsix fights and six of his last eight.\n(G\u00fcnther to appear)\nIn Example 46, the noun phrases the innocent and the guilty do not have antecedents, but the ellipted noun phrase in\nExample 47 does. To account for the presence versus the absence of an antecedent, G\u00fcnther (to appear) assumes that in the\nHuman Construction, in Example 46, the silent noun, that is, one, has a generic personal reading, while in cases like Example\n47, the silent noun refers to a specific person or entity.\nIn support of these ideas, G\u00fcnther (to appear) provides counter-evidence against the nominalization analysis of the adjectives in\nthe rich, the poor, and so on. The first piece of evidence is that these adjectives are unable to carry plural markings as nouns normally\ndo, that is, *the riches, *the poors, and so on. The second piece of evidence is that these adjectives, in both English and German,\nexhibit adjectival morphology, for example, comparative in Example 48 and superlative in Example 49 (G\u00fcnther to appear):\n(48) (a) . . . the wealthier have an obligation to help the weaker and the poorer.\n(b) Die Reichen werden immer reicher, die \u00c4rmeren immer \u00e4rmer.\n \"The rich are constantly getting richer, the poorer are constantly getting \npoorer.\"\n(49) (a) New aid to the poorest is given as grants, not loans.\n(b) das Unglaublichste zu denken und das Unm\u00f6glichste f\u00fcr m\u00f6glich zu halten\n \"to think of the most unbelievable and to consider the most impossible to be possible\"\nNote that G\u00fcnther does not mention the fact that the German adjectives have N case. I would suggest that N case is marked on\nthe adjective when the head noun is implicit (see Example 43 from Arabic). This part of the analysis is not developed by\nG\u00fcnther; thus, it requires further investigation.\nThe third piece of evidence against the nominalization analysis of these adjectives is that the silent noun one in nounless\nnoun phrases in English can in fact be inserted into the construction, indicating that a nominal position must be available in the\nstructure (G\u00fcnther to appear). Interestingly, if the silent noun one appears in the sentence, it agrees with the adjective in case,\nnumber and gender in German and in number in English, that is, the innocent ones (G\u00fcnther to appear).\nExamining the Arabic compounds in line with G\u00fcnther's (to appear) analysis shows that the lack of an antecedent discussed\nby G\u00fcnther (to appear) can also be observed in Examples 44 and 45, where the Adj + N compounds have a default reading\nreferring to a person.3 Similar to G\u00fcnther's (to appear) examples from English and German, if the silent noun one/person\nappears in Arabic, it normally has a generic reading, in the sense that it only refers to a human being without specifying who\nhe or she is. Note, however, that the context plays a role in identifying the intended referents. For instance, the poor in the\nsentence I help the poor in my village does not have a generic reading. Similarly, the following sentence from Arabic does not\nhave a generic reading, as the context assigns a specific referent to the compound:\n(50) raay-tu waasi-at-a l-aynayn ma sadiiq-i khalid\nsaw-I wide-F-ACC the-eyes with friend-my Khalid\n\"I saw the girl with wide eyes with my friend Khalid.\"\nIn addition, the silent noun agrees with the adjective in case, number, and gender, when it is pronounced, as in Example 51:\n(51) (a) qaabalt-u axs-an tawiil-a l-qaamat-i\nmet-I person.MSG-ACC tall.MSG-ACC the-figure-GEN\n \"I met a person with a tall figure.\"\n(b) qaabalt-u aaaxs-an tawiil-i4 l-qaamat-i\n met-I person.MPL-ACC tall-MPL.ACC the-figure-GEN\n \"I met people with tall figures.\"\n(c) qaabalt-u fataat-an tawiil-at-a l-qaamat-i\nmet-I girl.FSG-ACC tall-FSG-ACC the-figure-GEN\n \"I met a girl with a tall figure.\"\n(e) qaabalt-u fatayaat-in tawiil-at-i5 l-qaamat-i\n met-I girl.FPL-ACC tall-FSG-ACC the-figure-GEN\n \"I met girls with tall figures.\"\nExample 51 shows that the implicit noun person/girl can be realized in Adj + N compounds in Arabic, and the adjective has to\nagree with it. Note that adjectives in Arabic can carry the plural marker quite generally; thus, the plurality test is not applicable.\nThe other test of adjectivehood proposed by G\u00fcnther (to appear), namely, exhibiting adjectival morphology, such as com-\nparative and superlative, does not apply to the adjective in Adj + N compounds, as in the following examples:\n(52) uibbu l-aqwa qalb-a-n min bayni aqraan-i\nlove.I the-strongest heart-ACC-INDF from among peers-my\n\"I love the bravest among my peers.\"\nlit. I love the one strong in heart among my peers.\nIn particular, when we apply the comparative and superlative test to Adj + N compounds (see Example 52, a case of superlative\nmorphology), the structure of the compound changes. Specifically, the definite article is attached to the first element and the\nsecond element is assigned as accusative case. Therefore, I will disregard this test.\nAll in all, it seems that Adj + N compounds in Arabic can be analyzed as being headed by an empty noun, that is, one/person,\nand it is this noun that determines the syntactic category of the whole compound. Thus, the whole Adj + N compound is a noun on\nthe basis of the syntactic category of the implicit head. In addition, it seems as though the adjective, which is the first element in\nAdj+ N compounds, acts on behalf of the implicit noun when it is not realized, bearing the case, number and gender markings.\nThe third syntactic criterion is obligatoriness of the head. The obligatory element is clearly the left element:\n(53) (a) uibbu qawiyy l-bunyah\n love.I strong the-body\n \"I love the strong and healthy person.\"\n(b) uibbu l-qawiyy\n love.I the-strong\n \"I love the strong person.\"\n(c) *uibbu l-bunyah\n love.I the-body\n lit. I love the body.\nExample 53b shows that the right element can be deleted, whereas Example 53c demonstrates that the left element cannot,\nsuggesting that the left element is the obligatory one.\nWith regard to the morphological criteria, first, it has already been established that the left element is the morphosyntactic\nlocus (see Example 51). Second, it is clear that the left element is lexical, whereas the second element is phrasal, because it\nconsists of the lexical items marked with the obligatory determiners l- \"the\" or -n \"a/an,\" as in Examples 54 to 56:\ndear the-people\n\"the chief of people\"\nlit. the dear of people\nhappy the-luck\n\"the lucky person\"\nweak.MSG the-heart\n\"the cowardly male\"\nTo sum up, the left element of the Adj + N compounds in Arabic is the implicit head one. Its absence seems to trigger case\nmarking on the adjective, a phenomenon that is also found in German.\nThe Implications of the Headedness Criteria\nIn the previous section, it was implicitly assumed that every compound has one single head, identified by all seven properties\nsimultaneously. However, there have been suggestions that there are different types of heads, identified by different properties.\nF\u00e1bregas, & Forza, 2009, pp. 49-50) have suggested that two main types of head, namely, semantic and syntactic heads, can be\ndistinguished. Here, it is worth pointing out that the seven criteria of headedness discussed in \"Headedness Criteria in the\nPrevious Literature\" section can also be used to identify types of head. For example, Haspelmath (2002, p. 88) argues that a\ncompound has a semantic head when the whole compound denotes a hyponym of either of its elements, such as sea bird, house-\nboat, sailboat, school bus, handbag, and handbrake, where sea bird is a hyponym of bird and similarly for the other cases.\nConcerning the syntactic head, Scalise et al. (2009) indicate that a compound has a \"formal\" head when (a) the head determines\nthe class of the whole compound, or (b) when the head carries all the inflectional markers, or (c) a combination of both. For\nexample, green is an adjective, but the syntactic category of the whole compound greenhouse is N, since the formal head is a N\n(pp. 49-50). In the compound school buses, the head buses is inflected for number. Finally, in the compound blue skies, the\nformal head skies determines the syntactic category of the whole compound and carries the plural suffix -s.\nThis approach is taken even further by Scalise and F\u00e1bregas (2010, p. 124), who discuss three types of head: (a) the syntac-\ntic head, which determines the syntactic category of the whole compound (e.g., sky blue is an adjective like its syntactic head\nblue); (b) the semantic head, which determines the semantic category (as in bookshop, which is a type of shop); and (c) the\ninflectional head, which carries the inflectional markers (such as the plural -s in mother(s)-in-law). When dealing with the\nsemantic head, it is important to restate the difference between endocentric and exocentric compounds. Endocentric com-\npounds are semantically headed, such as sailboat which is a type of boat, while exocentric compounds are not semantically\nheaded, such as egghead which is not a hyponym of head (Booij, 2007, p. 81). In particular, the syntactic head is connected to\nthe distributional equivalence and subcategorization criteria, the semantic head is related to hyponymy, and the inflectional\nhead is a reflection of the morphosyntactic locus criterion. The normal expectation would be that all three types of head coin-\ncide in one and the same element of the compound. This is certainly the case in English compounds like blackbird, where bird\nis the semantic, syntactic, and inflectional head simultaneously; blackbird is a type of bird, it is a N like bird, and the plural is\nblackbirds. However, according to Arcodia (2012, p. 366), these types of head do not necessarily coincide, such as California\nIn Arabic, the semantic head in endocentric compounds is the left element, as exemplified by Example 57:\nsaw the-wood\n\"the wood saw\"\nThe compound minaar lxaab \"the wood saw\" is a hyponym of minaar \"saw\"; thus, the head of the compound is minaar \"saw.\"\nHowever, the semantic relationship is not always clear in case of non-compositional compounds, as in the following example:\ndaughter the-eye\n\"the tear\"\nIn Example 58, bintlayn \"the tear\" is not a type of bint \"daughter.\" As pointed out by Borer (2009), who discusses the notion\nof semantic head in another Semitic language, that is, Hebrew, the \"IS A\" condition of Allen (1978, p. 11) cannot always be\napplied. Although a phrase IS A modified version of its head, such a semantic connection does not always obtain in Hebrew\ncompounds; compare Examples 59 and 60, where Example 59 is a phrase, and Example 60 is a compound:\n(59) (a) beyt mora IS A bayit\n house teacher IS A house\n(b) somer mexoniyot IS A somer\n guard cars IS A guard\n(60) (a) beyt sefer \"school\" IS NOT (necessarily) A bayit6\n house book \"school\" IS NOT (necessarily) A house\n(b) yosev ros \"chairman\" IS NOT A yosev\n sitter head \"chairman\" IS NOT A sitter\nBorer (2009) uses examples such as Example 60 to argue that some compounds in Hebrew are semantically headless. In particu-\nlar, the whole compound is not a hyponym of either of its elements. Thus, looking at Example 58 from Arabic and Example\n60from Hebrew, it seems that some compounds lack a semantic head. However, in the approach sketched above, they can still\nhave a syntactic and/or morphological head.\nWith respect to the syntactic head of a compound, it is the element that determines the syntactic category of the whole\ncompound (Scalise & F\u00e1bregas, 2010, p. 124). In Arabic, the left element is the syntactic head, as in Example 61:\n(61) uubb-u qawiyy-at l-qalb\nlove-I strong-FSG the-heart\n\"I love the brave female.\"\nlit. I love the one with the strong heart.\nExample 61 shows that the implicit left element one is the syntactic head of the whole compound. The syntactic category\nof the compound qawiyyat lqalb \"the brave female one\" is a noun like the implicit head one, not like the adjective qawiyyat\n\"strong.\"\nFinally, Scalise and F\u00e1bregas (2010, 124) state that the morphological head carries the inflectional features of a word, such\nas gender, number, and case. In Arabic, the element which carries the inflectional features, namely, number and gender is the\nleft element. This is illustrated with the following examples:\n(62) (a) muallim l-kiimyaa\n teacher.MSG the-chemistry\n \"the chemistry teacher\"\n(b) muallim-at l-kiimyaa\n teacher-FSG the-chemistry\n \"the female chemistry teacher\"\n(c) muallim-uu l-kiimyaa\n teacher-MPL the-chemistry\n \"the chemistry teachers\"\n(d) muallim-aat l-kiimyaa\n teacher-FPL the-chemistry\n \"the female chemistry teachers\"\nThe left element in Example 62 bears the inflectional markers of the compound as a whole and it is lexical rather than phrasal, as\ndiscussed in \"The Morphological Criteria\" section. Thus, this section has shown that Arabic compounds exhibit three types of head,\nthat is, semantic, syntactic, and morphological, and these types always coincide in Arabic, unlike English.\nConclusion\nTaking all the previous points into consideration, several\ngeneralizations can be made with regard to headedness in\nArabic compounds within the SGC:\n1. All N + N compounds are left-headed in accordance\nwith the semantic, syntactic, and morphological cri-\nteria, supporting the generalization that Arabic is a\npredominantly head-initial language.\n2. The semantic, syntactic, and morphological heads\nalways coincide in Arabic compounds.\n3. The most reliable test to determine the morphological\nhead in Arabic is the case test, which provides a bet-\nter test than number and gender.\n4. In Adj + N compounds, a silent noun, that is,\none/person is responsible for determining the syntac-\ntic category of the whole construct. This silent noun\nis the head, which supports the generalization that\nArabic is a predominantly head-initial language.\nThis study has shown that the criteria used to identify the\nhead in syntactic constructs, for example, phrases proposed\nhave proven their validity in identifying heads in English\ncompounds (see Arcodia, 2012) and in Arabic compounds.\nBased on these conclusions, it is recommended that further\nstudies which investigate the position of the head in other\ntypes of compounds in Arabic, such as V + V compounds,\nare needed to determine, first, whether all types of com-\npounds are headed and, second, whether they are all left-\nheaded or not.\n"
