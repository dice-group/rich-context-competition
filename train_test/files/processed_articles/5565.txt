    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe nursing profession is physically demanding as it is ranked second from the viewpoint of physical activity, following\nindustrial occupations. Nursing is considered a profession with high musculoskeletal disorders, specifically low back pain.\nThis article evaluated the nurses' educational needs based on the Health Belief Model (HBM) with focus on the low back pain\nand adoption of preventive behaviors. This analytical cross-sectional study was conducted on 133 nurses who were selected\nrandomly from three public educational hospitals affiliated with Arak University of Medical Sciences. Data collection was\nperformed with a questionnaire, which included demographic characteristics, questions on HBM constructs, and a checklist for\nexplaining the performances. The collected data were analyzed using descriptive and analytical tests and Pearson's correlation\ncoefficient. In this study, among the HBM constructs, the cues to action and the perceived barriers were the main predictors\nof optimal performance among the sample subjects (B = 0.09, p < .01). Moreover, there was a significant relationship between\nthe nurses' performance on adopting the preventive behaviors and the scores of perceived barriers, self-efficacy, and cues\nto action (p < .05). However, no significant relationship was observed between the nurses' performance and perceived\nsusceptibility, severity, and benefits. In this study, as for behavior barriers, the nurses complained about unfamiliarity with\nthe workplace ergonomics and inappropriate conditions based on ergonomic principles, which requires educational planning\nwith the aim of overcoming perceived barriers, improving managerial activities, and enhancing the working place conditions.\n",

As a\nresult of such injuries, 600,000 workers miss work annually,\n45 to 54 billion dollars are spent, and work efficiency\ndecreases (Malone, 2000; Maul, L\u00e4ubli, Klipstein, &\nKrueger, 2003). Increasing the prevalence of low back pain\nprevalence of low back pain is higher in nurses than other\noccupational groups as it is reported to be about 73% to 90%\nMaul et al., 2003). According to some studies, the prevalence\nof low back pain among Iranian nurses ranges from 59.6%\n(Mohseni-Bandpei, Fakhri, Ahmad-Shirvani, Bagheri-\nSadeghi, & Zare, 1999). Nursing is physically demanding\nand is ranked second following industrial occupations, in this\nregard (Engels, Landeweerd, & Kant, 1994). Although the\ncauses of low back pain have not been determined thor-\noughly, physicians believe that inappropriate work condi-\ntions, incorrect body positions, and environmental factors as\nwell as physical activities in such conditions, exposing to\ndaily routine activities, bending, frequent rotations, carrying\nheavy loads, performing repetitive activities, weak abdomen\nmuscles, and muscle shortening are some causes of low back\npain (Bernard, 1997). Most nurses mention that patient trans-\nfer, standing for a long time, and activities that are physically\ndemanding are the main causes of their low back pain\n(Mohseni-Bandpei et al., 2005). According to earlier studies,\nmore than 40% of the nurses' injuries result from patient\n1Arak University of Medical Sciences,Arak, Iran\nCorresponding Author:\nMahboobeh Khorsandi, Associate Professor of Health Education and\nPromotion, Health Faculty, Arak University of Medical Sciences, Arak,\nIran.\nEmail: dr.khorsandi@arakmu.ac.ir\nLow Back Pain Preventive Behaviors\nAmong Nurses Based on the Health Belief\nModel Constructs\nNaser Sharafkhani1, Mahboobeh Khorsandi1, Mohsen Shamsi1,\nand Mehdi Ranjbaran1\n Keywords\nhealth belief model, low back pain, educational needs assessment, musculoskeletal disorders\n2 SAGE Open\ntransfer of which 75.9% cause low back pains (Fujishiro\net al., 2005). Studies in other countries show that the control\nand treatment of low back pain are not similar in different\ncountries, and physicians and health experts adopt different\ntreatment methods. One of these methods is back health edu-\ncation programs or Back School, which consists of programs\nsuch as education and increasing awareness about chronic\nlow back pain, structure and function of the spine, preserving\nthe correct posture of the spine, and performing special back\nexercises (Heymans, van Tulder, Esmail, Bombardier, &\nKoes, 2005). A few studies have focused on the nurses'phys-\nical conditions, workplace ergonomics, received instruc-\ntions, and their effects on work problems and musculoskeletal\nand occupational injuries (Alexandre, de Moraes, Corr\u00eaa\nFilho, & Jorge, 2001; Menzel, Brooks, Bernard, & Nelson,\nprograms depends on the above-mentioned programs, and\ntheir efficiency depends on appropriate application of the\nexisting models and programs of health education; in other\nwords, health education models and programs are more effi-\ncient when they possess appropriate theoretical support and\nrequired basic facilities (Ewles & Simnett, 2003). Among\nthese models is Health Belief Model (HBM), which is a valu-\nable and efficient educational assessment model (Figure 1).\nIt is in fact a behavioral model, which shows the relationship\nbetween health belief and behavior and is based on the prin-\nciple that preventive behaviors depend on the individuals'\nbeliefs including their vulnerabilities to the disease, the\neffect of the disease on their lives, and the effect of health\nactivities on reducing the disease severity and susceptibility.\nThe change behavior strategy may be planned using HBM\n(Harrison, Mullen, & Green, 1992; Karimi, Ghofranipour, &\nHeydarnia, 2009). The model constructs are perceived sus-\nceptibility, severity, benefits, and barriers as well as self-\nefficacy. Another construct is cues to action, which refers to\ninternal and external events, which may stimulate and pre-\npare an individual to conduct an appropriate behavior (Glanz,\nthe present study was to determine the nurses' performance\nand preventive behavior concerning chronic low back pain\nand its causes, based on the HBM constructs. The results\nmay be applied in planning for the health promotion of the\nnurses and other medical staff.\nMethod\nThe minimum sample size was a calculated 126 persons con-\nsidering a study conducted by Zakerian et al. (2012), using\nthe following formula: n\nd\n=\n\u00d7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand a confidence interval [CI] of 95%), but we included 133\nindividuals in the study. The sample included the nurses\nworking in three educational hospitals in Arak including\nValiasr, Amiralmomenin, and Amirkabir Hospitals. The\nnurses were selected with regard to the inclusion criteria\nusing a simple random method without imputation and\naccording to each ward's nurses list proportionate to the\nwhole number. Inclusion criteria were having an academic\ndegree (BS or higher), full-time employment, at least 1 year\nexperience as a clinical nurse, no musculoskeletal disorder in\npast, and no surgical operation in musculoskeletal limbs, and\nproviding written consent for participation in the research.\nThe exclusion criterion of the study was no back pain during\nthe study.\nIn this study, the data collection instrument was a ques-\ntionnaire consisting of five sections. Section 1 covered\ndemographic characteristics. Section 2 included some ques-\ntions regarding perceived susceptibility such as \"nurses are\nat a higher risk of suffering chronic low back pain than other\nlabor groups,\" and perceived severity such as \"In case of\nFigure 1. Health belief model.\nSharafkhani et al. 3\nsuffering chronic low back pain, all the aspects of my life\nwill be changed negatively.\" The combination of perceived\nseriousness and perceived susceptibility is referred to as per-\nceived threat (Glanz et al., 2008), perceived benefits such as\n\"I can prevent the effects of chronic back pain through\nobserving ergonomic principles in my workplace,\" and per-\nceived barriers such as \"I do not conduct necessary measures\nto prevent low back pain because I am not familiar with the\nrelated principles.\" Nineteen questions about low back pain\nwere prepared on a 5-point Likert-type scale (5 = I totally\nagree, 4 = I agree, 3 = no comment, 2 = I disagree, 1 = I\ntotally disagree). Section 3 consisted of six questions regard-\ning the various internal and external cues to action such as\n\"have you ever studied about chronic low back pain on the\nInternet?\" on a 5-point Likert-type scale (5 = very high, 4 =\nhigh, 3 = low, 2 = very low, and 1 = never). The fourth sec-\ntion with six questions addressed the nurses' self-efficacy in\nlow back pain preventive behaviors. The fifth section\nincluded a checklist with the aim of measuring the nurses'\nperformance in adoption of low back pain proper preventive\nbehaviors.\nTo evaluate the checklist questions, a 4-point Likert-type\nscale was utilized (0 = never, 1 = seldom, 2 = often, 3 =\nalways). The questionnaire was prepared based on reviewing\nvalid resources (Berthelette, Leduc, Bilodeau, Durand, &\nMenzel, 2009; Occupational Safety Health Administration,\n2010). The validity of the questionnaire was confirmed\nthrough evaluating the clarity, simplicity, and relevance of\nthe questions (content validity). The questions'necessity was\nalso evaluated through receiving feedback from an expert's\npanel consisting of specialists and experts in occupational\nmedicine, ergonomics, professional health, and health educa-\ntion as well as experienced faculty members. Cronbach's\nalpha was calculated in 30 nurses with demographic charac-\nteristics similar to those of the sample population to measure\nthe reliability of the questionnaire, which was 0.75 for HBM,\n0.73 for self-efficacy, and 0.72 for the performance checklist.\nThe collected data were analyzed with SPSS-20 using\ndescriptive statistical tests and Pearson correlation\ncoefficient.\nEthical Considerations\nThe project was approved by the Research Committee (num-\nbered 854) as well as the Ethics Committee (numbered\nticipants participated in the study voluntarily after receiving\nnecessary explanations on its objective and method.\nResults\nIn this study, the mean age of the participants was 32.1 \u00b1 5.3.\nMoreover, 8.3% of the participants were male and 91.7%\nwere female with a mean work experience of 5.38 \u00b1 3.6\nyears. Other demographic characteristics are presented in\nThe results of the study revealed that the mean score of\nmeans the proper posture and observing ergonomic princi-\nples at work including refraining from turning around the\nwaist axis during patient transfer or lifting loads, refraining\nfrom bending on the load (or patient), refraining from hold-\ning the arms higher than shoulders for some minutes, observ-\ning the principles of patient transfer and lifting loads\n(including lifting instruments, trolleys, sinks, buckets, and\nbaskets), refraining from keeping a long distance between\nthe patient and the nurse when moving a patient, placing the\ninstruments on a place not higher than the waist level, using\na ladder or stool to get access to objects on high shelves, and\nrefraining from lifting heavy loads (e.g., moving sedentary\npatients). The mean score of nurses in observing the princi-\nprinciples included refraining from excessive bending for-\nward or backward, refraining from turning around, and\nobserving the correct principles regarding sitting on the\nchair. The nurses' mean score in observing managerial prin-\nciples for adopting low back pain preventive behaviors was\nfrequency of patients' transfer and lifting objects to less than\n20 times during a work shift, asking for help when moving\npatients who are unable to keep their balance, refraining\nfrom performing activities beyond one's ability, and regard-\ning work time limitations (not working in short interval work\nTable 1.

Finally, the nurses' performance score in performing\nexercises to strengthen back muscles was equal to 0.71 \u00b1\ncise at all, 60.9% seldom exercised, and only 5.3% exercised\nmost of the time. Other findings of the HBM constructs are\nshown in Table 2.\nAccording to Table 3, there was no correlation between\nperceived susceptibility and severity with the performance\nand between perceived benefits and performance. However,\nthere was a reverse correlation between self-efficacy and\nperformance, a positive correlation between cues to action\nand performance, and a positive correlation between the cues\nto action and self-efficacy.\nThe main barriers that the nurses confronted in adopting\npreventive low back pain behaviors were reported as lack of\naccess to proper hospital equipment, inappropriate work-\nplace conditions, high work load, excessive fatigue, and lack\nof knowledge on chronic low back pain prevention\nprinciples.\nLinear regression using stepwise methods was applied to\npredict the nurses' optimal performance based on HBM con-\nstructs. Regression analysis revealed that among these com-\nponents, only perceived barriers and cues to action were\ncapable of predicting adoption of chronic low back pain pre-\nventive behaviors.\nThe results of multiple linear regressions are presented in\nRegarding external cues to action, Respectively from\nhighest to lowest rating, are presented in Table 6. The recom-\nmendations of the nurses with low back pain and the book-\nletsandeducationaljournalshavebeenmentionedconcerning\ntheir adoption of low back pain preventive behaviors.\nThe nurses also reported that the internal cue to action\nwas fear of suffering from back pain (85.5%). Table 6 shows\na mean score of 2.79 out of 5, which indicates low self-effi-\ncacy of the nurses in performing daily exercises for 30 min,\ncontrolling Body Mass Index (BMI), reducing unnecessary\nexpenses for providing an appropriate mattress and bed for\nthemselves, preserving the correct body posture at work, and\nconfronting the risk factors of back pain through observing\nergonomic principles.\nDiscussion\nThe findings of the study revealed a reverse correlation\nbetween perceived barriers and the nurses' performance, a\npositive correlation between cues to action and performance,\nand a positive correlation between self-efficacy and perfor-\nmance. The results demonstrate that the nurses' performance\nin terms of adopting low back pain preventive measures was\nweak, regarding both ergonomic principles' conformity with\nthe workplace conditions and observing the preventive prin-\nciples such as preserving the proper body posture while sit-\nting or standing in work time. Cilliers (2007) claimed that the\nperceived risk factors for suffering from low back pain\namong nurses were as follows in order: moving heavy\npatients, moving patients without asking for help, perform-\ning repetitive movements, moving patients to bed, and let-\nting them have the appropriate position (Cilliers, 2007).\nDespite the reports on the above-mentioned risk factors, the\nnurses in this study had a weak performance regarding the\nadoption of low back pain preventive behaviors. Moreover,\ntheir mean score of perceived susceptibility was 3.52 out of\n5, which demonstrates that most of the nurses agreed that\nthey were exposed to the risk of low back pain at work, but\nthey did not take the proper measures. Therefore, one may\nconclude that awareness does not lead to behavior change\nand many different factors are effective in this regard. Hignett\n(2003) reported that musculoskeletal disorders were one of\nthe most prevalent problems in health care employees. His\nfindings were confirmed in a study by Li et al in 2004\nErikson, Bruusgaard, and Knardahl (2004) introduced low\nback pain as one of the prevailing musculoskeletal disorders\namong nurses. The nurses' obtained scores in perceived\nseverity were above the average, which shows that they were\nvery well aware of the serious effects and consequences of\nlow back pain on their life. Cilliers quoted from Berlute that\nabout 80% of the employees suffer from severe low back\npain and the related consequences in their lifetime. Low back\npain is an important reason for specialist visits (Cilliers,\n2007). Therefore, low back pain incurs heavy burdens on\nindividuals and the society; however, there appears to be no\nsignificant relationship between perceived severity and sus-\nceptibility with the nurses' performance in adoption of low\nback pain preventive behaviors.\nAccording to the literature, the nurses' mean score of the\nperceived benefits of preventive behaviors was above the\naverage, which is satisfactory. The concerned benefits were\nthe ability to conduct daily tasks, prevention of economic\nburdens resulting from back pain, being physically fit, and\nhaving a pleasant life.\nThe mean score of perceived barriers was 3.87 out of 5.\nAccording to the participants, the most important barriers\nagainst adopting back pain preventive measures were lack of\nTable 2. The Mean Scores of Perceived Susceptibility, Severity,\nBenefits, Barriers, and Self-Efficacy, Concerning Chronic Low\nBack Pain Preventive Behaviors.\nVariables Average SD Maximum Minimum\nSharafkhani et al. 5\nsport facilities and appropriate places, very busy schedule of\nthe nurses, lack of a safe workplace, and lack of knowledge\nabout work conditions, ergonomic principles, and safety\nissues to prevent low back pain. Other studies have intro-\nduced lack of knowledge about long-time sitting and\nstanding and workplace ergonomic principles, lack of proper\nequipment at work, inappropriate social places, shortage of\nlifting equipment, and lack of physical exercise as the main\ncauses of low back pain (Berthelette et al., 2012; L\u00f8nnberg,\nPedersen, & Siersma, 2010; Samad,Abdullah, Moin, Tamrin,\n& Hashim, 2010). Our study showed that perceived barriers\nwere predictive of the nurses' optimal performance, and that\ntheir reduction would promote the nurses' optimal perfor-\nmance. Meanwhile, as for the nurses' performances, cue to\naction was the most powerful predictive construct among all\nHBM constructs. In the present study, the internal cue to\naction to encourage the nurses to adopt low back pain pre-\nventive behavior was reported to be the fear of suffering\nfrom low back pain, and the most important external cues to\naction were recommendations of the nurses with low back\nTable 4.

However, accord-\ning to the nurses, the least important external cues to action\nwere educational workshops and posters because the work-\nshops were held infrequently and there were no such\nposters.\nCilliers (2007) reported that the nurses' sources of infor-\nmation regarding low back pain treatment were physicians\n(34%), physiotherapists (25%), nursing faculty members\n(20%), mass media (13%), in-service training (6%), and\nschools (2%).\nLimitations\nBecause the present research was conducted in governmental\nand educational hospitals, the results cannot be generalized\nto the staffs in other medical centers.\nConclusion and Suggestion\nAlthough the nurses' perceived susceptibility and severity\nwere considerable, they were far from adopting appropriate\npreventive behaviors. Therefore, it is necessary to increase\nsafety instructions at the hospitals with the aim of overcom-\ning the barriers of adopting such behaviors.
