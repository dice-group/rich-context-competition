The population percentage\nundetected among adults with diabetes and the odds ratio of being undetected among adults who\nreported not having diabetes were compared between groups based on their access to health care.\nRESULTS -- Among those with diabetes, the percentages having undetected diabetes were\nyear, and 24.5% (21.7\u00ad27.3) for those continuously insured over the past year. Type of insur-\nance, number of times receiving health care in the past year, and routine patterns of health care\nutilization were also associated with undetected diabetes. Multivariate adjustment indicated that\nhaving undetected diabetes was associated with being uninsured (odds ratio 1.7 [95% CI 1.0\u00ad\nCONCLUSIONS -- Limited access to health care, especially being uninsured and going\nwithout insurance for a long period, was significantly associated with being a \"missed patient\"\nwith diabetes. Efforts to increase detection of diabetes may need to address issues of access to\ncare.\nAmericans had undiagnosed diabetes\n(1). Individuals with undiagnosed type\n2 diabetes (type 2 diabetes accounts for\n90\u00ad95% of all diabetes) have significantly\nhigher risks for cardiovascular disease\nthan do individuals without diabetes (2).\nFailure to diagnose diabetes prevents pa-\ntients from receiving effective treatments\nand may have serious consequences, such\nas blindness, amputation, cardiovascular\ndisease, and death (3). Interventions that\ncan prevent or delay these complications\ncannot be promptly applied to patients\nwith diabetes unless their disease has\nbeen detected (3). Timely detection,\ntherefore, is of great importance, as it can\nreduce the human and economic cost of\ndiabetes (2).\nA recent U.S. Census Bureau report\nof U.S. residents lacked health insur-\ncompared with the insured, are much\nless likely to receive routine checkups\nor preventive services (5), tend to be\nmore severely ill when diagnosed, and\nreceive less therapeutic care (6). In ad-\ndition to insurance coverage and the na-\nture of coverage (7), absence of a\nphysician or place for usual source of\ncare is associated with lack of screening,\nfollow-up care, and pharmacologic\ntreatment for hypertension (8). Also,\nmany insured individuals lack adequate\naccess to health care or have only inter-\nmittent health insurance, and states of\ninadequate coverage are associated with\nlower use of preventive services (9,10).\nThe absence of continuous insurance\ncoverage can have a particularly severe\nimpact, and a national study found that\nadults who were uninsured for a long\nperiod of time reported much greater\nunmet health needs than those who\nwere insured (11). While being poor\nand uninsured is associated with de-\nlayed access to health care (12), higher-\nincome adults lacking health care\ninsurance have a decreased use of rec-\nommended health care services, and in-\ncreased income does not attenuate the\ndifference in use between uninsured\nand insured adults (13). Limited access\nto health care not only affects the use of\npreventive services (14) but also ele-\nvates the risk of a decline in overall\nTo date, few studies have specifically\nexamined the implications of having in-\nadequate insurance coverage among indi-\nviduals with diabetes. We have seen,\nhowever, that uninsured adults with dia-\nbetes are less likely to receive needed care\nand to effectively manage their disease,\nand those with health insurance have dif-\nficulty obtaining needed care when their\norganizations have addressed the impor-\ntance of detecting diabetes (1,2,18), but\nthe relationship between access to pre-\nventive services and the likelihood of hav-\ning undetected diabetes has not been\ninvestigated the relationship between\nsocioeconomic status and the detection of\ndiabetes and found that undiagnosed di-\nabetes was not related to education or in-\ncome, these studies did not examine the\nrole that access to health care might play\nin detecting diabetes.

Individuals aged 64\nyears were excluded because they were\ncommonly entitled to Medicare, the fed-\neral health care insurance program (96\nundiagnosed diabetes, of whom only 2\nreported no health care insurance cov-\nerage). The diabetic population con-\nsisted of subjects who answered \"yes\" to\nthe question, \"Have you ever been told\nby a doctor that you have diabetes or\nsugar diabetes?\" plus subjects who an-\nswered \"no\" but had fasting plasma glu-\ncose levels 126 mg/dl. Those who\nanswered \"no\" (regardless of fasting\nplasma glucose values) made up our\npopulation who self-reported not hav-\ning diabetes.\nAccess to health care can be consid-\nered a multidimensional concept, includ-\ning availability, organization, financing,\nutilization, and satisfaction among the\npossible domains (7). In this study, the\nmeasures of access used reflect two of\nthese five domains: financing and utiliza-\ntion (7). Financing was measured by the\nfollowing three variables: 1) uninsured, 2)\ncovered by private insurance, and 3) con-\ntinuity of insurance coverage. Classified\nas uninsured were those who responded\n\"no\" to the question, \"Are you covered by\nhealth insurance or some other kind of\nhealth care plan?\" Those who reported\nhaving health insurance (the insured)\nwere asked, \"Are you covered by private\ninsurance?\" Those who responded \"yes\"\nwere classified as covered by private in-\nsurance, and those responding \"no\" were\nconsidered to have public insurance.\nContinuity of coverage was derived from\nthree questions: \"Are you covered by\nhealth insurance or some other kind of\nhealth care plan?\", \"In the past 12\nmonths, was there any time when you did\nnot have any health insurance coverage?\",\nand \"About how long has it been since\nyou last had healthcare coverage?\" The re-\nsponses were used to create a three-level\nvariable: continuously insured over the\npast year, uninsured 1 year, and unin-\nsured 1 year.\nUtilization was measured by 1) num-\nber of times the participant received\nhealth care during the past 12 months,\nderived from the question, \"During the\npast 12 months, how many times have\nyou seen a doctor or other healthcare pro-\nfessional about your health at a doctor's\noffice, a clinic, hospital emergency room,\nat home or some other place?\" and 2) rou-\ntine patterns of health care utilization, de-\nrived from the two questions, \"Is there a\nplace that you usually go when you are\nsick or you need advice about your\nhealth?\" and \"What kind of place do you\ngo to most often: is it a clinic, a doctor's\noffice, ER, or some other place?\"\nWe controlled for six sociodemo-\ngraphic variables in our analysis, includ-\ning age, sex, race/ethnicity, marital status,\neducation, and family income. We also\nused as covariates BMI (measured as kilo-\ngrams divided by the square of height in\nmeters) and a dichotomized version of\nself-rated health.\nData analysis\nWe used two approaches to examine the\nrelationship between access to health care\nand undiagnosed diabetes. First, we fo-\ncused on the whole diabetic population\n(diagnosed and undiagnosed) and exam-\nined the percentage undetected among\nthose with diabetes (undiagnosed divided\nby diagnosed plus undiagnosed).\nSecond, we used multivariate logistic\nregression models to examine, in the pop-\nulation who self-reported not having dia-\nbetes the relationship between access to\nhealth care and actually having diabetes.\nWe restricted this analysis to the popula-\ntion who self-reported not having diabe-\ntes because diagnosed patients might be\nmore likely to seek insurance and to use\nhealth care more often than their undiag-\nnosed counterparts. In our multivariate\nlogistic regression models, covariates in-\ncluded age, sex, race/ethnicity, marital\nstatus, education, family income, BMI,\nand self-rated health.\nThe sampling weights from the sub-\nticipants who had fasted in the morning\nwere utilized in our analyses. Analyses\nwere conducted using SUDAAN statisti-\nducted two-tailed t tests for significance\nand considered results with a P value of\nRESULTS -- In the subsample of\nwe identified 110 subjects with undiag-\nnosed diabetes, 704 who had been diag-\ndiabetes. Characteristics of participants\nfor each group was presented in Table 1.\nIn an analysis adjusted for age, sex,\nand race/ethnicity, those with undiag-\nnosed diabetes had the least favorable\nprofile of access to health care among\nthe three groups (Table 2 ). They were\nsignificantly more likely to be unin-\nsured than either of the other two\ngroups (P  0.01 for both compari-\nsons). Similarly, they were more likely\nto be uninsured for 1 year than were\nthese other two groups (P  0.01), and\nthey were the most likely not to have\nreceived any health care in the past year.\nIn addition, subjects with undiagnosed\ndiabetes were more likely than those\nwith diagnosed diabetes to lack a usual\nsource of care (P  0.01). If insured,\nhowever, the undiagnosed were more\nlikely than the diagnosed to be covered\nby a private insurance plan.\nPercentage undetected among all\npeople with diabetes\nThe percentage of those with undetected\ndiabetes in the diabetic population was\nsignificantly higher among the uninsured\n1). Among the insured, the percentage\nundetected among those with private in-\nsurance was significantly higher than\namong those with government insurance\n22.1]). Continuity of coverage was asso-\nciated with the percentage undetected.\nHere, the highest percentage, 49.3%\nuninsured for 1 year, followed by\namong those insured without discontinu-\nity in the past year.\nThe number of times that health care\nwas received in the past year was associ-\nated with having undetected diabetes.\nPercentages undetected ranged from\nnot seeing a health care professional in the\nthose who received care just once to\ning care two to three times to 16.7%\ncare four times or more.

Using a nationally represen-\ntative sample, we found that lack of access\nto care significantly elevated the risk of\ngoing undiagnosed. We found that unde-\ntected diabetes was related to insurance\ncoverage, routine patterns of health care\nutilization, and continuity of coverage.\nThe type of insurance and the number of\ntimes a health care professional was seen\nin the past year were also associated with\nhaving undetected diabetes. It is also\nnoteworthy that those with undiagnosed\ndiabetes were significantly more likely\nthan those without diabetes to be unin-\nsured or to be uninsured for 1 year.\nPrevious studies (9\u00ad11) have indi-\ncated that continuity of coverage is even\nFigure 1--Percent of undetected diabetes among people with diabetes by access to care. y-axis: percentage of undetected diabetes with 95% CI. x-axis:\naccess to care.

Similarly, our\nstudy indicated that access to care was\nsignificantly related to the failure to detect\ndiabetes, and the continuity of access was\nalso important in determining whether\ndiabetes would go undetected. In our\nstudy, subjects uninsured for 1 year\nwere essentially twice as likely as insured\nsubjects without a break in insurance over\nthe past year to have undetected diabetes.\nType 2 diabetes, a chronic disease, takes a\nlong time to develop and reach its diag-\nnostic threshold. During the progression\nto diabetes, access to primary care plays a\ncrucial role in its timely detection. The\nlonger an individual is without insurance\ncoverage, the longer she or he may go\nwith undetected diabetes.\nWe found that those covered by pri-\nvate plans were significantly more likely\nto be undiagnosed when they actually had\ndiabetes than were those covered by gov-\nernment insurance. This finding may\nseem counterintuitive, but we know that\nsome private insurance companies pro-\nvide limited coverage for preventive care\n(17,23), and private coverage tends to be\nmore discontinuous (24). It is worth not-\ning that some government health plans\n(e.g., those offered through the Depart-\nment of Veterans Affairs) provide rela-\ntively effective preventive care for their\nenrollees with diabetes (17), and the Vet-\neran's Affairs professional staff may\naccordingly be more attuned to recom-\nmendations for diabetes screening.\nfound a relationship between education\nor income and the risk of having unde-\ntected diabetes. These studies, however,\ndid not examine the role played by ac-\ncess to health care (another aspect of\nsocioeconomic status) in the detection\nof diabetes. Although we found no sig-\nnificant difference by education or in-\ncome between being diagnosed and\nundiagnosed among individuals with\ndiabetes, our analyses have shown that\naccess to health care plays an important\nrole in detecting diabetes.\nAlthough race/ethnicity is related to\ndiabetes and poor access to care (1,25),\nwe found no evidence that race/ethnicity\naffects the association between access to\nhealth care and detection of diabetes. A\nrecent study (26), using data from Behav-\nioral Risk Factor Surveillance System\nlower socioeconomic status were at\ngreater risk for not receiving preventive\ncare regardless of race/ethnicity and those\nwithout health insurance coverage were\nat the greatest risk for not receiving pre-\nventive services. Our findings are consis-\ntent with that study. In our model, lack of\naccess to health care is a predictor for un-\ndetected diabetes regardless of race/\nethnicity. Our study suggests that access\nto health care might be among the most\nimportant predictors for determining\nwhether diabetes is/is not detected.\nOur study has the following strengths:\n1)Thedatacomefromanationwidesurvey;\n2) sampling weights were incorporated in\nthe analysis so as to represent the adult U.S.\npopulation; 3) sociodemographic, anthro-\npometric, and health status variables were\ncontrolled for in our analyses; and 4) two\ndifferent approaches were used to examine\ntwo different populations, reducing the bias\nintroduced by the effect of diabetes aware-\nness on the willingness to acquire health\ncare insurance. Our study has limitations as\nwell. The major limitation is that the rela-\ntively small sample of subjects with undiag-\nnosed diabetes makes it difficult to analyze\ndifferences by subgroup between the two\nsexes or between different race/ethnicity\ngroups. Another limitation is that access to\nhealth care was measured by only two of\nfive domains because of the limited avail-\nability of the survey data.\nOur findings demonstrate that lack\nof access to health care may result in\nmissed opportunities to detect diabetes.\nThe detection of diabetes requires spe-\ncific diagnostic tests, e.g., the fasting\nplasma glucose test or the oral glucose\ntolerance test (or both). These tests are\ncommonly arranged within a compre-\nhensive health care setting that recog-\nnizes the risk profiles of its patients.\nWithout access to comprehensive\nhealth care, patients would be less likely\nto receive screening and diagnostic ser-\nvices, and, in the end, their diabetes\nmay be missed by the health care sys-\ntem. When they are missed by the\nhealth care system, the problems caused\nby those \"missed\" cases do not disap-\npear. On the contrary, as a study by\nYoung and Mustard (27) indicated, they\nrepresent the unseen but clinically im-\nportant burden of diabetes, with signif-\nicant concurrent metabolic derange-\nments and a long-term impact on use of\nhealth care.\nWith the increases in both the dia-\nbetic and the uninsured populations in\nthe U.S., it seems very likely that the num-\nber of undetected cases of diabetes will\nincrease in the future, with consequent\nincreases in diabetes-related morbidity\nand mortality. This trend cannot be re-\nversed until we can increase access to\nhealth care for those Americans who need\nit most. Our analyses indicate that limited\nhealth care access, especially being unin-\nsured and having a long period without\ninsurance, is associated with being a\n\"missed patient\" with diabetes. Those\nmaking an effort to increase the timely\ndetection of diabetes should consider is-\nsues related to health care access.\n"
