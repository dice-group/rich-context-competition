Multinational corporations seems to have enhanced opportunities to\nrespond to taxation and capital market conditions with their financing and investment deci-\nsions. The adverse revenue consequences and the disadvantage of national companies create\ntemptations for tax-policy makers to change details in the tax law in order to restrict certain\ntypes of tax planning. However, it is not obvious that an attempt to restrict tax planning\nis very effective. Moreover, if it is effective, it is not clear that the corporations' response to\na restriction is generally beneficial for the imposing country. Since, as has been discussed in\nthe theoretical literature, restricting certain opportunities for tax planning might result in\nadverse consequences for the level of investment undertaken by multinationals in high-tax\ncountries which may also reinforce tax competition.\nOne important element in multinational corporations' tax-planning is their ability to ad-\njust the financial structure not only by means of external debt but also internally by using\nintercompany loans. Governments often respond by imposing thin-capitalization rules. A ge-\nneral characteristic of these rules is that interest deduction for tax purposes is limited if\nthe debt-to-equity ratio of an affiliate is above certain threshold. In fact, the imposition of\nthin-capitalization rules is widespread among European and OECD countries.\nThis paper investigates the effects of thin-capitalization rules on multinationals' financing\nand investment decisions. A theoretical model derives some basic empirical predictions about\nthe consequences of imposing thin-capitalization rules for capital structure choice and invest-\nment. The empirical analysis employs a comprehensive micro-level panel database (MiDi)\nof virtually all German multinationals' foreign affiliates made available for research by the\nDeutsche Bundesbank. Combined with the information about corporate taxation, including\nthin-capitalization rules in all OECD and European Union countries over a period of 9 years,\nthis dataset allows us to study the consequences of the introduction, removal, or change in\nthin-capitalization rules across countries and time.\nOur empirical results confirm that thin-capitalization rules are quite effective in reducing\ntax planning by means of intercompany loans. Moreover, investment is not only found to\nbe sensitive to local tax rates but is also to a significant degree adversely affected by the\nimposition of thin-capitalization rules. Thus, our results confirm that tax policy is facing a\ntrade-off between limiting multinationals' tax planning and the real consequences of corporate\ntaxation.\nNicht-technische Zusammenfassung\nDie Steuerplanung grenz\u00a8\nuberschreitend t\u00a8\natiger Konzerne findet besondere Beachtung durch\ndie Steuerpolitik. Es gibt zahlreiche Hinweise, dass grenz\u00a8\nuberschreitend t\u00a8\natige Konzerne\nzus\u00a8\natzliche M\u00a8\noglichkeiten zur Steuerplanung besitzen. Die daraus resultierenden Ausf\u00a8\nalle\nbeim Steueraufkommen und Nachteile f\u00a8\nur nur national t\u00a8\natige Unternehmen veranlassen die\nSteuerpolitik h\u00a8\naufig zu einer Steuergesetzgebung, die grenz\u00a8\nuberschreitende Steuerplanungs-\nm\u00a8\noglichkeiten einschr\u00a8\nanken soll. Angesichts der Komplexit\u00a8\nat des Steuerrechts und der Viel-\nzahl grenz\u00a8\nuberschreitender Sachverhalte ist jedoch unklar, ob entsprechende Regelungen wirk-\nsam sind. Zudem ist unklar, ob solche Beschr\u00a8\nankungen der Steuerplanungsm\u00a8\noglichkeiten f\u00a8\nur\nein Land auch vorteilhaft sind. Die theoretische Diskussion in der Literatur zum Steuer-\nwettbewerb l\u00a8\nasst vielmehr vermuten, dass Restriktionen der Steuerplanung einen negativen\nEinfluss auf das Investitionsvolumen insbesondere an Hochsteuerstandorten hervorrufen. Dies\nw\u00a8\nurde letztendlich den Steuerwettbewerb versch\u00a8\narfen.\nF\u00a8\nur die Steuerplanung stellt die Ausgestaltung der Fremdfinanzierung ein bedeutendes Ele-\nment dar. Internationale Konzerne k\u00a8\nonnen neben der Aufnahme von Fremdkapital am Ka-\npitalmarkt dar\u00a8\nuber hinaus auch konzerninterne Darlehen einsetzen. Der Steuergesetzgeber\nreagiert darauf h\u00a8\naufig mittels Beschr\u00a8\nankungen der Fremdfinanzierung (Thin-Capitalization\nRules). Diese Regelungen versagen \u00a8\nublicherweise den zus\u00a8\natzlichen steuerlichen Zinsabzug,\nwenn die Fremdfinanzierung ein bestimmtes Verh\u00a8\naltnis von Fremd- gegen\u00a8\nuber Eigenkapital\n\u00a8\nuberschreitet. Innerhalb der OECD Staaten und in Europa sind entsprechende Regelungen\ninzwischen weit verbreitet.\nDieses Papier untersucht deshalb die Auswirkungen von steuerlichen Beschr\u00a8\nankungen der\nFremdfinanzierung auf Finanzierungs- und Investitionsentscheidungen internationaler Kon-\nzerne. Mittels eines einfachen theoretischen Modells werden grundlegende Hypothesen f\u00a8\nur die\nempirische Analyse von Konsequenzen dieser steuerlichen Restriktionen auf die Kapitalstruk-\ntur- und Investitionsentscheidungen herausgearbeitet. F\u00a8\nur die sich anschlie\u00dfende empirische\nAnalyse wird ein umfangreicher Paneldatensatz (MiDi) genutzt, welcher Firmendaten von\nnahezu allen Tochtergesellschaften deutscher Unternehmen enth\u00a8\nalt. Dieser Datensatz wird\nvon der Deutschen Bundesbank f\u00a8\nur Forschungszwecke zug\u00a8\nanglich gemacht. In Kombination\nmit detaillierten Informationen zur Unternehmensbesteuerung, insbesondere zu den jeweili-\ngen Regelungen zur Beschr\u00a8\nankung der Fremdfinanzierung f\u00a8\nur alle OECD- und EU-Staaten\n\u00a8\nuber einen Zeitraum von 9 Jahren, versetzt uns dieser Datensatz in die Lage, die Konsequen-\nzen der Einf\u00a8\nuhrung, Abschaffung oder Reformierung von steuerlichen Beschr\u00a8\nankungen der\nFremdfinanzierung empirisch zu \u00a8\nuberpr\u00a8\nufen.\nDie empirischen Ergebnisse best\u00a8\natigen, dass steuerliche Beschr\u00a8\nankungen der Fremdfinanzie-\nrung die Steuerplanung mittels konzerninterner Darlehensvergaben wirksam beschr\u00a8\nanken. Die\nempirischen Resultate zeigen jedoch auch, dass Investitionsentscheidungen internationaler\nKonzerne nicht nur vom jeweiligen lokalen Steuerniveau, sondern auch vom Grad der steu-\nerlichen Beschr\u00a8\nankung der konzerninternen Fremdfinanzierung negativ beeinflusst werden.\nDemnach best\u00a8\natigen unsere Ergebnisse die Vermutung, dass die Steuerpolitik letztendlich\neine Abw\u00a8\nagung zwischen Beschr\u00a8\nankungen der internationalen Steuerplanung und den hieraus\nresultierenden negativen Konsequenzen f\u00a8\nur Investitionsentscheidungen treffen muss.\nContents\n2 Theoretical Implications of Thin-Capitalization Rules 5\n4 Data and Descriptive Statistics 16\n5 The Impact of Thin-Capitalization Rules on Intercompany Loans 22\n6 The Impact of Thin-Capitalization Rules on Investment 30\nList of Figures\n1 Share of Countries Imposing Thin-Capitalization Rules (in %) . . . . . . . . . 4\n2 Average Threshold Level for Internal Debt: OECD and European Countries 20\nList of Tables\n1 Foreign Affiliates by Country . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 18\n2 Descriptive Statistics . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 23\n3 Thin-capitalization Rules and Intercompany Loans . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 24\n4 Determinants of Intercompany Loans: Sample Split . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 27\n5 Determinants of Intercompany Loans: Sample Selection Model . . . . . . . . 29\n6 Thin-Capitalization Rules and Investment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 31\nThe Impact of Thin-Capitalization Rules on Multinationals'\nFinancing and Investment Decisions \n1 Introduction\nWhile all companies will probably respond to taxation and capital market conditions\nwith their financing and investment decisions, multinational corporations seem to have\nenhanced opportunities to do so. This includes well-known strategies of tax deferral\nand transfer pricing but extends to many more strategies. Though it is difficult to\nassess the revenue losses resulting from multinational corporations' tax planning efforts\nfor high\u00adtax countries like the US or Germany, tax planning by multinationals seems to\nbe an important factor (Gravelle, 2004; Desai, 2005). Apart from adverse consequences\nfor tax revenue, enhanced opportunities to save taxes may give the multinationals an\nadvantage over companies operating only at a national level. This would distort the\ndecision to operate multinationally rather than domestically (Bucovetsky and Haufler,\n2007). The adverse revenue consequences and the disadvantage of national companies\ncreate temptations for tax-policy makers to change details in the tax law in order to\nrestrict certain types of multinational tax planning. However, the many dimensions\nalong which multinational corporations can structure their activities have already led\nCorresponding author's address:\nThiess Buettner\nIfo Institute for Economic Research\nPoschingerstr. 5\nGermany\nPhone:\nFax:\nE-mail:\nbuettner@ifo.de\nWe are indebted to Joel Slemrod, two anonymous referees, and to seminar participants at the University of\nKentucky and the Bundesbank for helpful comments. Support by the German Science Foundation (DFG) is\ngratefully acknowledged.\nto rather complex national tax policies with regard to transnational activities (Gresik,\n2001). In this situation, it is not obvious that further attempts to restrict certain types\nof tax planning are very effective. Even if they are effective, it is not clear that the\ncorporations' response to a restriction is generally beneficial for the imposing country:\nas has been discussed in the theoretical literature, restricting opportunities for tax\nplanning might result in adverse consequences for multinationals' investment in high-\ntax countries and may reinforce tax competition (e.g., Keen, 2001; Janeba and Smart,\nOne important element in multinational corporations' tax planning is related to the\nfinancial structure. While the taxation of corporate profits generally results in an\nincentive to use debt instead of equity, multinationals can adjust the financial structure\nnot only by means of external debt but also internally by using intercompany loans to\nand from foreign affiliates. Facing an increased ability of multinational corporations\nto use debt finance, governments often respond by imposing thin-capitalization rules\ngeneral characteristic is that interest deduction is limited if the debt-to-equity ratio of\nan affiliate is above a certain threshold. More precisely, interest payments associated\nwith an excess leverage are generally not deductible from taxable profit. In the US,\nfor example, corporations whose debt-to-equity ratio is in excess of 1.5:1, and which\npay interest on debt owed to, or guaranteed by, certain non-US affiliates are subject\nto the so-called earnings stripping limitation of interest deduction (cf., Sec. 163 (j)\nIRC). While the US was one of the first countries that imposed thin-capitalization\nrules, many countries have followed recently. Figure 1 documents the increased use\nof thin-capitalization rules among the OECD and the European Union (EU) countries\nover the last decade. In the mid-nineties, less than a third of European countries and\nless than half of the OECD countries had thin-capitalization rules in place. In 2005,\nthree fifths of European and two thirds of OECD countries imposed such rules. In the\nwere 19 cases where new restrictions on the admissible capital structure were enacted\nor where existing limitations were tightened; in only four cases have tax authorities\nweakened or entirely removed restrictions.\nDespite the spread of thin-capitalization rules, however, empirical evidence on their\nconsequences is generally lacking. In this paper, therefore, we will investigate the ef-\nfects of thin-capitalization rules on multinationals' financing and investment decisions.\nA theoretical model derives some basic empirical predictions about the consequences\nof imposing thin-capitalization rules for capital structure choice and investment. The\nempirical analysis employs a comprehensive micro-level panel database of virtually all\nGerman multinationals' foreign affiliates made available for research by the German\ncentral bank (Deutsche Bundesbank). Combined with the information about corporate\ntaxation, including thin-capitalization rules in all OECD and European Union coun-\ntries over a period of 9 years, this dataset allows us to study the consequences of the\nintroduction, removal, or change in thin-capitalization rules across countries and time.\nThe results confirm that thin-capitalization rules are quite effective in reducing tax\nplanning by means of intercompany loans. Moreover, investment is not only found to\nFigure 1: Share of Countries Imposing Thin-Capitalization Rules (in

In quantitative terms, the results suggest that\nthe imposition of these rules is, on average, associated with a decline of investment\nby about 4.8%. This supports theoretical concerns that tax competition might be\nreinforced if governments restrict cross-border tax planning.\nThe paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides a simple theoretical background\nconsidering the impact of thin-capitalization rules on financing and investment decisions\nof a multinational corporation and derives testable empirical predictions. Section 3\ndiscusses the investigation approach. The subsequent sections are concerned with the\nempirical analysis. Section 4 gives a short description of the dataset, before Sections\n5 and 6 present the results for capital structure choice and investment, respectively.\nSection 7 provides the conclusions.\n2 Theoretical Implications of Thin-Capitalization Rules\nIn order to derive the impact of thin-capitalization restrictions on corporate decisions\nwe will briefly discuss the decision of a multinational company based in country 1 which\ncarries out activities in the host country 2. Consider the profits related to the stock of\ncapital invested in country 2\n)\n- \u00b5\n.\nHere f (k2\n) denotes the output at location 2 where k2\nunits of capital are employed. 2\nis the local tax rate on capital income. The first term in the second line reports the\ninterest cost, where i2\n) is the rate of interest for debt issued in country 2 (1), and \u00b52\ndenote the share of capital financed with internal and external debt, respectively.\nNote that internal debt (\u00b52\n) is remunerated at the interest rate in country 1.1 The\nsecond term in this line captures the return on equity where r is the required rate of\nreturn. If both \u00b52\nare zero, all capital is financed with equity.2 Before further\nconsidering the profit function, let us briefly discuss the tax incentive for using internal\ndebt. Suppose that i1\nis not different from r. Then, a shift towards debt finance at\nlocation 2 (higher \u00b52\n) will tend to raise profits after taxes, as a larger part of the\nearnings of capital is tax deductible. Even in this situation, the corporation will not\nfinance all capital with debt due to additional cost of debt.3 They are represented in the\n1The company might have an incentive to set the interest rates above the market value, but we assume\nthat the arm's length principle is effective.\n2Note that the profit function assumes that the parent incurs external debt in order to finance the inter-\ncompany loan. Thus interest income at the parent is offset with interest cost. The alternative is, of course,\nthat the parent finances the loan with equity. In this case, however, the parent would have to pay taxes on\nthe interest income which might be quite substantial if the parent is located in a high-tax country. Our focus\nhere lies on the first case, since the empirical analysis below is concerned with German multinationals, where\nthe parent company is indeed located in a high-tax country. The alternative case is discussed by Mintz and\n3The concept of additional cost of debt has been introduced by the corporate finance literature (for surveys\nsee, e.g., Myers, 2001; Graham, 2003). Basically, the literature emphasizes that a tax-induced increase in\nthe leverage is associated with an increase in costs of financial distress (e.g., Kraus and Litzenberger, 1973;\nScott, 1976), or in agency costs of debt reflecting an inability to solve potential conflicts between equity and\ndebt claimants by means of contracts (e.g. Jensen and Meckling, 1976; Myers, 1977). Another strand of the\nshareholders and management. In this view, debt might be useful to ensure control rights of investors under\nlast line by a convex function of the affiliate's internal and external debt-capital ratios\n).4 The last term reflects the imposition of a thin-capitalization rule, which\nlimits interest deductions up to a fixed share of internal debt, i.e. interest payments for\nan excess leverage cannot be deducted from the tax base. Hence, the profit function is\nextended to take account of the additional tax payments arising from an excess leverage\nabove the admissible limit \u00b5\n. In order to consider cases with and without restrictions\non the tax deduction of interest, we will set 2\n= 1 if the affiliate operates under a\nbinding thin-capitalization rule, i.e. in cases where \u00b52\n= 0 otherwise.\nFor internal debt used by the affiliate in country 2 we obtain the first-order condition\n= c\u00b5\nAccordingly, the leverage related to intercompany loans is determined by the cost of\nequity relative to internal debt. If r > (1 - 2\n, the convexity of c implies that\nis positive. In other words, if the after-tax rate of interest is below the required\nreturn on equity, some internal borrowing is inevitable. If 2\nequals 1, the marginal\ncost of intercompany borrowing jumps up to i1\n+ c\u00b5\n) as the tax deduction is no\nlonger granted. As a consequence, the amount of internal debt \u00b52\nmight be reduced.\nHowever, in the restricted case we have two possible outcomes. If the required return\non equity is sufficiently large (r > i1\n+ c\u00b5\n)), the optimal choice of \u00b52\nobeys\nbad conditions, for instance, if a firm goes bankrupt. But since equity allows the manager to control the\ncorporation under good conditions, a tax-induced increase in the debt-asset ratio relative to the optimal level\nwould imply an inefficiency which contributes to the additional cost of debt.\n) > 0, and positive second-order differentials.\n+c\u00b5\n. But if the required return on equity is lower such that\n+ c\u00b5\n) < r < i1\n+ c\u00b5\n) , we have a corner solution where \u00b52\n.\nWith regard to empirical implications, note that the imposition of thin-capitalization\nrules will not only affect the level of intercompany loans; it will also affect its tax-rate\nsensitivity. In order to see how, we derive the comparative static effect of an increase\nin the tax rate by differentiating the two first-order conditions to obtain\n=\nc\nc\u00b5\nc\u00b5\u00b5\nc\n\u00b5\nWithout a thin-capitalization rule (2\n= 0) and if interest rates do not differ much,\nthis term is positive and the strength of the response depends on the interest rate and\non the cost function c (2\n).5 However, if there is a thin-capitalization rule in place\nand it is binding (2\n= 1), the positive tax rate effect disappears. In fact, depending\non the degree of substitution between internal and external debt, the effect might even\nbe negative. Of course, if we have a corner solution such that \u00b52\nis fixed at \u00b5\n, the\nimpact of the tax rate is zero.\nBeside effects on the capital structure, thin-capitalization rules might also affect the\ncost of capital and thus, investment. Consider the first-order condition for the capital\nstock\n) fk\n) !\n5It is reasonable to assume that the cross effects are always dominated by the own effects, i.e. c\u00b5\u00b5\n> |c\u00b5\n|\nand c\n> |c\u00b5\n|.\nAccordingly, the stock of capital is chosen such that the after-tax marginal product on\nthe left-hand side equals the marginal cost of investment on the right-hand side. The\nlatter consists of the interest cost (first term), of the cost of equity (second term), and\nof the additional cost of debt (third term). The last term, however, adds to the cost\nonly if a thin-capitalization rule is imposed and binding (\u00b52\n> \u00b5\n= 1). Then,\nthe tax deduction is limited, borrowing is more costly, and the costs of investment are\nincreased. The consequence will be a lower level of investment. Note, however, that\nthe adverse effect on investment is increasing in the actual level of internal debt and is\nzero at the threshold (\u00b52\n= \u00b5\nTo sum it up, the theoretical discussion offers at least three sets of testable predic-\ntions: (i) First of all, the first\u00adorder conditions suggest that the amount of internal\ndebt used by the affiliate is a declining function of the after-tax rate of interest if no\nthin-capitalization rule is imposed. Then, a lower interest rate and a higher tax rate\nwould lead to an increase in internal debt. But, if a thin-capitalization rule is imposed\nin the host country and is binding, internal debt received from other affiliates of the\nmultinational is reduced. If empirical results are supportive, we can say that tax plan-\nning via intercompany loans is effectively reduced by thin-capitalization rules. (ii) A\nsecond implication of the theoretical discussion is that the determination of an affili-\nate's capital structure is different under the restriction of a thin-capitalization rule. If\naffiliates are subject to binding restrictions, internal debt is no longer a shelter against\ncorporate taxation, and thus a higher tax rate will no longer be associated with an in-\n6With additional assumptions about the properties of the production function, further implications might\nbe drawn about the tax sensitivity of the capital stock.\ncrease of internal debt. If this is confirmed empirically, binding thin-capitalization rules\nwould effectively remove the incentive for tax planning via intercompany loans. (iii)\nA third implication is related to the stock of capital. While the optimal capital stock\nof an affiliate is simply a function of the cost of capital, the imposition of a binding\nrestriction on internal debt raises the cost of capital. Empirical analysis can test this\nprediction and quantify the adverse effect of thin-capitalization rules on investment.\n3 Investigation Approach\nThe empirical analysis below aims at testing the theoretical predictions discussed in\nthe previous section using a firm-level panel dataset of the affiliates of German multi-\nnationals in 36 European and OECD countries. This data, which will be described\nin greater detail below, provides information about the capital structure of each affili-\nate including information about intercompany loans. Combined with the information\nabout corporate taxation, including thin-capitalization rules, this dataset basically pro-\nvides us with three sources of empirical variation that can be used to study the effects\nof thin-capitalization rules. The first source is the variation in the existence of these\nrules in the set of countries over time, which we have noted already in the introduction.\nA second source is the variation in the threshold level of intercompany loans above\nwhich interest deduction is denied. A third source, however, stems from information on\nintercompany loans received by each individual affiliate. This information enables us\nto distinguish between affiliates where interest deduction is likely to be denied because\nthe host-country's thin-capitalization rule is binding, and affiliates where the rule is\nmost likely not binding as the amount of intercompany loans is below the threshold\nlevel. As we will see below, this third source of variation can be used in particular to\nstudy the differences in the tax sensitivity of capital structure choice.\nA natural starting point for the empirical analysis is to consider the effectiveness of the\nthin-capitalization rules that have been introduced by several countries. For this pur-\npose, we first apply a simple dummy-variable approach, testing whether the imposition\nof such rules has noticeable effects on the capital structure of foreign affiliates in these\ncountries. More precisely, we run panel regressions of the share of capital financed with\nintercompany loans ICLj,k,t\nof an affiliate in the host country j held by company k in\nperiod t on a complete set of affiliate- and time-specific effects and an indicator of the\nimposition of such rules\nICLj,k,t\n= t\n+ j,k\n+ aRULEj,t\n+ uj,k,t\nwhere RULEj,t\n= 1 if a thin-capitalization rule is imposed in country j in period t\nand otherwise zero. If thin-capitalization rules are effective, a should be significantly\nnegative. Note that the affiliate-specific effects nest country-specific fixed effects, and\nthus remove time-invariant differences across countries. Hence, a significant negative\neffect would indicate that the introduction of thin-capitalization rules is associated with\na decline of intercompany loans.\nIn order to check that not only the imposition but also the actual tightness of thin-\ncapitalization rules affects intercompany loans, we employ the alternative approach\nICLj,k,t\n= t\n+ j,k,\n+ aTHRESHj,t\n+ uj,k,t\nwhere THRESHj,t\nis an indicator of the tightness of thin-capitalization rules in country\nj as of time t. More precisely, THRESHj,t\nreports the admissible amount of internal\ndebt above which interest deduction will be denied and is expressed as a fraction of\ntotal shareholder capital (inclusive of internal debt). Without any restrictions the\nadmissible amount is 100%; if there are restrictions, this figure is lower. In the US case,\nfor example, the limit implied by the earnings-strippings rule would be 60%.7 With\nthis definition of THRESH, we expect a significantly positive coefficient for a1\n.\nWhile the above approach provides some descriptive evidence on the effects of thin-\ncapitalization rules, it fails to take account of other possible determinants of capital\nstructure choice such as, for instance, the statutory tax rate. For the purpose of obtain-\ning reliable quantitative estimates of the effects of thin-capitalization rules, we employ\nthe indicator for the presence or tightness of the rules in an estimation equation for\ncapital structure choice\nICLj,k,t\nj,t\nxj,k,t\n+ j,k\n+ t\n+ j,k,t\nwhere j,t\nis the local profit tax rate and xj,k,t\ncontrols for further characteristics of the\naffiliate or the host country which possibly affect the use of debt or the access to credit.\n7To see this note that the debt-to-equity limit for internal debt of 1.5:1 implies a maximum amount of\ninternal debt expressed as a fraction of total shareholder capital of 1.5/ (1.5 + 1) = 0.6.\nNote that the time effect also captures the lending rate and the taxing conditions at\nthe parent location, as we consider a set of companies which all share the same parent\nlocation. The affiliate-specific effect captures not only general characteristics of the\naffiliate, but also all time-invariant characteristics of the host country. Furthermore,\nbecause each affiliate is associated with a separate fixed effect, the specification nests\ncompany-specific effects. These effects capture company-specific opportunity cost of\ncapital which might differ, for instance, with personal taxation at the level of the\nshareholder.\nThe estimation strategy presented so far has only tested whether the existence and\ntightness of a thin-capitalization rule in a host country are reflected in the amount of\nintercompany loans used. In order to test the predictions about the tax sensitivity of the\ncapital structure, however, we need to explicitly take into account the conditions at the\nlevel of the affiliate and distinguish the decision of restricted from that of unrestricted\naffiliates. One way to approach the estimation problem is to follow Hu and Schiantarelli\n(1998) and to think of unrestricted and restricted affiliates as operating under two\ndifferent regimes: the first regime refers to affiliates where the capital structure is such\nthat all interest payments for intercompany loans can be deducted from gross profits.\nThe second regime refers to affiliates where the thin-capitalization rule is binding,\nand thus the marginal gain from using intercompany loans is reduced. We therefore\nintroduce an indicator variable Ij,k,t\ntaking on the value one if the thin-capitalization\nrule is binding for affiliate j of company k in period t, while otherwise zero. For\neach regime the financial structure is explained by the same set of variables, however,\nintercept and slope coefficients may differ.\nj,k,t\nj,t\nxj,k,t\nj,k\nt\nj,k,t\nj,k,t\nj,t\nxj,k,t\nj,k\nt\nj,k,t\nwhere\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nj,k,t\n= ICLj,k,t\nif Ij,k,t\nj,k,t\n= ICLj,k,t\nif Ij,k,t\nA basic problem in the estimation of this system of two equations is that selection into\neach of the two (sub-)samples is endogenous: the assignment of an affiliate to one of\nthe samples depends not only on the tightness of the restriction, but also on the level of\ninternal debt. However, as emphasized by Verbeek and Nijman (1992) and Vella (1998),\nfixed effects regressions would yield consistent estimates if sample selection depends on\nthe individual-specific component, but not on the random component. This would\nimply, however, that firms do not switch between regimes.\nIn order to control explicitly for possible sample-selection effects, we follow Kyriazidou\n(1997), who proposes a two-step estimator yielding consistent estimates under more\ngeneral conditions. The first step is concerned with the selection process captured by a\nbinary regression model such as Chamberlain's (1980) fixed effects logit estimator. The\nsecond step is concerned with the estimation of the model in first differences using only\naffiliates that are observed in the same regime in both periods. The estimation uses a\nweighted least squares procedure, where the parameters of the selection equation are\nused to construct kernel weights, such that pairs of observations with larger differences\nin the selection effects receive a smaller weight.\nWith regard to the possible determinants of the selection equation, we note first that\nsample selection should depend on the determinants of capital structure choice. An-\nother rather obvious variable would be the actual admissible internal debt limit as\ncaptured by THRESHj,t\n. In addition, a useful predicting variable could be the ratio\nof nominal share capital to total capital, because an affiliate with more nominal capital,\nceteris paribus, is expected to be less frequently restricted by the thin-capitalization\nrule.\nPresuming that the analysis of internal debt supports the theoretical predictions about\nhow thin-capitalization rules affect internal debt and curb the incentive to engage in\ntax planning via intercompany loans, we finally turn to the effects on investment. As\nsuggested by the first-order condition, the optimal capital stock depends on the various\ncomponents of the cost of capital including the statutory tax rate, the return on equity,\nas well as on the interest rates weighted with the components of the capital structure.\nAs the first order condition is concerned with the capital\u00adlabor ratio, an analysis of\nthe optimal stock of capital should further include determinants of employment such\nas wages or, in a more general setting, other indicators of costs and profits. The\nsimple theory above has neglected any form of adjustment costs, which might be quite\nsubstantial at least with regard to real investment. In the presence of adjustment cost,\nhowever, it becomes necessary to at least invoke a simple partial adjustment mechanism\nwhere current investment aims at reducing the gap between optimal and existing stocks\nof capital. The empirical analysis, therefore, is concerned with investment as a function\nof the lagged stock of capital as well as of the determinants of the optimal stock of\ncapital. Thus, we specify a multivariate estimation equation\n log Kj,k,t\n=  log Kj,k,t-1\nzj,k,t\n+ j,k\n+ t\n+ j,k,t\n,\nwhere t\nis a time-specific and j,k\nis an affiliate-specific effect. zj,k,t\ncontains several\ncontrols, which may or may not be company specific. These reflect differences in the\nmarket size, in the local production cost including the corporate tax rate and deprecia-\ntion allowances, or in other variables that affect the capital structure choice as captured\nabove by xj,k,t\n.\nThe estimation equation involves a dynamic specification in a panel-data context. Thus,\none might be concerned about a possible dynamic panel bias (Nickell, 1981), even\nthough the data covers no less than nine subsequent years. To address this problem,\nwe will invoke a GMM estimator, exploiting the moment conditions related to lagged\nlevels of the dependent variable in a first differenced setting as suggested by Anderson\n4 Data and Descriptive Statistics\nThe empirical analysis employs micro-level data for multinationals provided by the Bun-\ndesbank. This includes a comprehensive annual database of direct investment stocks of\nGerman enterprises held abroad. More precisely, the data provides information about\neach foreign affiliate's balance sheet and some further information about the ownership\nas well as about the German investor. For the purpose of this study we use annual\nfirm-level panel data for foreign affiliates controlled by a German parent, in the time\nperiod from 1996 to 2004. Data collection is enforced by German law, which determines\nreporting mandates for international transactions.8 Since the above theoretical discus-\nsion is concerned with a multinational corporation that completely controls the capital\nstructure of its affiliates, we focus on majority-owned subsidiaries and also exclude in-\ndirectly held investment. Furthermore, because the theoretical model only deals with\nproductive affiliates, holdings and financial service providers as well as observations\nwith zero capital and zero sales are excluded.\nTable 1 provides some descriptive statistics on the size and geographic distribution of\nthe foreign affiliates in the sample. The list of host countries comprises 36 countries; 28\nof which are European countries. We include in particular all EU and OECD member\nstates, where a complete set of control variables is available.9 The table reports country-\nspecific means for the two variables which are the focus of the empirical investigation,\ni.e. the share of internal debt and the stock of fixed assets. The share of internal debt\nis defined by ratio of internal liabilities to total capital consisting of nominal capital,\ncapital reserves, profit reserves, and total debt. To study the investment decision we\n8Sec. 26 Aussenwirtschaftsgesetz (Law on Foreign Trade and Payments) in connection with Aussen-\nwirtschaftsverordnung (Foreign Trade and Payment Regulations). Each German multinational has to report\nits foreign assets including both direct FDI and indirect FDI conditional on some lower threshold level for\nmandatory reporting. Since 2002, FDI has to be reported if the participation is 10% or more and if the\nbalance-sheet total of the foreign object exceeds 3 million euros. For details see Lipponer (2006). Though\nprevious years showed lower threshold levels, we apply this threshold level uniformly for all years in the panel.\n9Although Romania is a EU member state, it is not included because lending rates are not available. Iceland\nis excluded since no affiliates in the dataset are reported there. Finally, Germany is not included as the parent\ncompanies' country.\nTable 1: Foreign Affiliates by Country\nHost Country Observations Fixed Assets Share of\nNumber Share Mean Mean\nCyprus a) - - - -\nEstonia a) - - - -\nBundesbank (MiDi) data, based on 48,551 annual observations for the time period\nfocus on the stock of fixed assets.\nIn order to capture the tax incentives for the capital structure, the analysis employs the\nstatutory tax rate on corporate income modified by applicable restrictions on interest\ndeductions, such as in the case of the Italian local business tax (IRAP). Thus, the\nemployed statutory tax rate captures the tax savings from deducting one unit of interest.\nSince the effective tax reduction from using debt might be zero if a subsidiary carries\nforward any losses for tax purposes (MacKie-Mason, 1990), we also use a dummy\nvariable indicating whether some loss carry-forward is reported. Of course, the existence\nof losses in the previous periods may capture other characteristics of the current decision\nproblem of the company, such as the expected performance of a subsidiary. Hence, the\noverall effect on the capital structure is ambiguous.\nFigure 2 depicts the development of the admissible amount of internal debt expressed\nas a fraction of total shareholder capital. Given the differences in the details of thin-\ncapitalization rules across countries, the admissible amount of internal debt depicted\nin Figure 2 generally reflects an upper limit. In several countries, interest deduction\nmay be denied even if internal debt is lower: external debt might be included if backed\nby the parent, and in some countries the limit is even expressed in terms of total\ndebt rather than internal debt.10 Figure 2 shows that the trend towards imposing\nthin-capitalization rules (see Figure 1) is reflected by the value of the threshold level.\nHowever, the mean value for European countries as well as for OECD countries in 2004\n10The US case serves as an example, because Sec. 163 (j)(3)(B) IRC explicitly includes external debt backed\nby the parent and Sec. 163(j)(2)(C) IRC refers to total debt.\nFigure 2: Average Threshold Level for Internal Debt: OECD and European

In order to control for company-specific\nvariation in the borrowing conditions, we employ the affiliate's sales as an indicator\nof the cash flow of the subsidiary. Another variable that captures differences in bor-\nrowing conditions is the asset tangibility measured as the ratio of fixed assets to the\nbalance-sheet total. Following the financing literature, a higher tangibility of assets\nshould result in more favorable borrowing conditions because agency costs may be re-\nduced by collateral (Jensen and Meckling, 1976). In order to interprete the signs of\nthe coefficients, it is important to note that we focus on internal debt rather than total\ndebt. Since internal debt shows a substitutive relationship with external debt (Desai,\nFoley, and Hines, 2004), higher external borrowing costs might be positively associated\nwith internal debt.\nWith regard to the analysis of investment, we employ some additional controls. Because\ninvestment might not only be affected by the statutory tax rate but also by depreci-\nation allowances, we include a control variable for the present value of depreciation\n11In the US case, the application of the earnings-stripping rule additionally requires that the corporation's net\ninterest expense exceeds 50 percent of the adjusted taxable income of the corporation. Since we do not observe\ndata on interest expenses, we will not attempt to take this additional requirement into account. However,\nfor those regressions where we use information about the threshold level, we carried out robustness checks by\nexcluding US observations and did not detect any qualitative differences to the results presented below.\nallowances.12 Further controls include hourly labor cost in manufacturing as available\nfrom the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In order to capture the market size we have in-\ncluded the GDP. Finally, the list of variables is augmented by a corruption perception\nindex as the prevalence of corruption may deter foreign direct investment (e.g., Wei,\n2002). Table 2 provides descriptive statistics for the main variables.\n5 The Impact of Thin-Capitalization Rules on Intercompany\nLoans\nAs discussed above, we will first carry out some general tests concerning the effectiveness\nof thin-capitalization rules. Column (1) of Table 3 reports results for the dummy-\nvariable approach. Note that because estimation controls for affiliate level fixed effects,\nonly variation in the existence of thin-capitalization rules within each country matters.\nThus, the negative significance of the dummy variable, that captures the existence of\na thin-capitalization rule, indicates that introducing such a rule exerts a significant\nimpact on intercompany loans: the average amount of intercompany loans is reduced\nif a thin-capitalization rule is introduced. The magnitude suggests that the share of\ninternal debt is reduced by 2.6 percentage points. Column (2) provides results where\nthe simple dummy is replaced by the actual admissible threshold level of internal debt.\nThe positive coefficient suggests that a tighter limit would actually be associated with\nless internal debt.\n12Note that due to restrictions of interest deduction, the tax rate used in the analysis of the capital structure\ndiffers slightly from the statutory tax rate used in the analysis of investment.\nTable 2: Descriptive Statistics\nVariable Mean Std.Dev. Min. Max.\nFirm level variables\nTax variables\nFurther country characteristics\nFirm-level variables are taken from the Bundesbank (MiDi) data. Minimum and maximum values of firm-\nlevel variables are averages of the 3 smallest (largest) values. Corporate taxation data are taken from the\nInternational Bureau of Fiscal Documentation (IBFD), and from tax surveys provided by Ernst&Young, PwC\nand KPMG. The lending rate refers to private sector debt taken from the IMF International Financial Statistics\nYearbook (2006) augmented with corresponding OECD figures. GDP in U.S. dollars at current prices is taken\nfrom World Bank World Development Indicators (2006). Labor costs in U.S. dollars for production workers in\nmanufacturing are taken from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and Eurostat. The Corruption Perception\nIndex is taken from Transparency International; the score ranges from 10 (country perceived as virtually\ncorruption free) to 0 (country perceived as almost totally corrupt).\nTable 3: Thin-capitalization Rules and Intercompany Loans\nAffiliate Fixed Effects yes yes yes yes yes\nDependent variable: share of internal debt. Affiliate- and time-specific fixed effects included. Heteroskedasticity\nrobust standard errors clustered at the level of country-year cells in parentheses. A star denotes significance at\nthe 10% level and two stars at the 5% level.\nIn a further step, we employ a regression approach that includes control variables for\nother determinants of capital structure choice. Column (3) shows results of regressions\nwith a standard set of controls. For all variables, the estimated coefficients show the\nexpected signs. According to Column (3), an increase in the tax rate by 10 percentage\npoints results in an increase in the internal debt share by about 2 percentage points.\nWhile this estimate is lower than results in the existing literature,13 it should be noted\n13Desai, Foley, and Hines (2004) report an impact of a 10 percentage point increase of the tax rate of 3.3\npercentage points for US multinationals. Mintz and Weichenrieder (2005) report results for foreign subsidiaries\nthat this coefficient only relates to internal debt. Desai, Foley, and Hines (2004) have\nconsidered the tax-sensitivity of internal debt with data for US multinationals and ob-\ntained a smaller coefficient, suggesting that an increase in the tax rate by 10 percentage\npoints results in an increase of the internal debt share of 0.8 percentage points. How-\never, given a lower share of internal debt in the case of US multinationals, the implied\nelasticity for the US case is 0.35 as compared to 0.25 in our case.\nWith regard to the indicators of borrowing cost, the results are in accordance with the\ntheoretical predictions, given the above-mentioned substitutability between external\nand internal debt. Asset tangibility shows a negative effect suggesting that less internal\ndebt is used if borrowing costs for external debt are reduced. Similarly, the positive\neffect of the lending rate indicates that more internal debt is used if borrowing costs\ndeteriorate.\nTo test for the effects of thin-capitalization rules, Column (4) includes the dummy\nfor the existence of a thin-capitalization rule; Column (5) employs the actual level of\nthe threshold above which interest deduction is denied. Both specifications support\nthe effectiveness of thin-capitalization rules. However, Column (5) is preferred since it\nincludes information about the tightness of the rules. In order to illustrate the empirical\nmagnitude, consider the case of a country which introduces a thin-capitalization rule\nwith a 1.5:1 ratio of internal debt to equity (i.e, the US case). In this case, the threshold\nlevel of intercompany loans would come down from 1 to a figure of 0.6. According to the\nof German corporations of between 3.0 and 5.7 depending on the specification. For German affiliates of foreign\ninvestors, Ramb and Weichenrieder (2005) find a coefficient of 1.4; Huizinga, Laeven, and Nicod`\nfind a somewhat lower estimate of 2.7 for a sample of European corporations.\npoint estimate in Column (5), the share of internal debt would drop by 4.6 percentage\npoints.\nWhile the results support the effectiveness of thin-capitalization rules, an investigation\nof the consequences for the tax-rate sensitivity would have to take into account that\nthe rules are not equally relevant for all subsidiaries. In fact, thin-capitalization rules\nare only binding for a subset of subsidiaries. As we know from the above theory, only\nfor the subsidiaries where the rule is not binding would we expect intercompany loans\nto be positively associated with the tax rate. In contrast, internal debt of restricted\nsubsidiaries should not be positively affected by the tax rate; depending on the degree\nof substitutability and on whether or not affiliates are stuck in a corner solution, even\na negative impact might be found.\nTo see whether, in fact, the tax sensitivity of the capital structure choice differs, we\nhave to decompose the sample of subsidiaries into sub-samples where the subsidiaries\nhave intercompany loans below or above the threshold, above which interest can no\nlonger be deducted from the tax base.\nIn fact, as depicted in Columns (1) and (2) of Table 4, a significant positive tax-rate\nsensitivity of intercompany loans is found only for subsidiaries where the amount of\nintercompany loans falls below the threshold defined by the thin-capitalization rule.14\nFor subsidiaries using more intercompany loans, the tax rate has no significant effect.\n14Affiliates are treated as restricted if internal debt as a fraction of total shareholder capital (inclusive of\ninternal debt) exceeds the accepted threshold for internal debt. Since in the US the limit is expressed in terms\nof debt rather than internal debt (Sec. 163(j)(2)(C) IRC), we carried out regressions based on this modified\ndefinition of restricted subsidiaries. However, the results are very similar.\nTable 4: Determinants of Intercompany Loans: Sample Split\nUnrestricted Restricted Unrestricted Restricted\nfirms firms firms firms\nAll observations Switching firms excluded\nDependent variable: internal debt share. Affiliate- and time-specific fixed effects included. Heteroskedasticity\nrobust standard errors clustered at the level of country-year cells. A star denotes significance at the 10%\nlevel and two stars at the 5% level. Columns (3) and (4) are obtained for a sub-sample of subsidiaries which\nin all years belong either to the group of unrestricted or restricted firms.\nAs these results are obtained from fixed effects panel regressions, they are consistent\nif sample selection is driven by the time-invariant characteristics of the subsidiaries.\nEven though it seems rather restrictive to assume that sample selection effects are\nfully captured by the fixed effects, according to Columns (3) and (4), similar results\nare found if all those subsidiaries are removed that have been switching between the\nregimes. This suggests that the results are mainly driven by affiliates where the selection\nis time invariant.\nIn order to obtain consistent estimates in the presence of sample selection effects, we\ncheck for differences in the tax-rate sensitivity between restricted and unrestricted\nsubsidiaries following Kyriazidou (1997). The results for the corresponding first-step\nestimation of the probability of a binding restriction as presented in Column (1) of\nTable 5 are clearly in line with the theoretical predictions.15 A higher tax rate and\na lower loss carry-forward provide an incentive for the affiliate to use more debt such\nthat it is more likely to pass the threshold. Given the substitutability between internal\nand external debt, the positive significance of the local lending rate and of sales as\nwell as the negative effect of tangibility are also in accordance with theoretical expec-\ntations. A significant adverse effect of the tightness of restrictions on the likelihood of\nbeing above the threshold is supported, and with regard to nominal capital, the estima-\ntion shows a negative effect. The former reflects the effectiveness of thin-capitalization\nrules for capital structure choice. The latter seems reasonable, because an increase in\nnominal capital makes it less likely that the thin-capitalization rule is binding. The\n15Note that the fixed effects logit estimator removes all observations where no change in the regime is\nobserved. This explains why the number of observations is relatively small.\nTable 5: Determinants of Intercompany Loans: Sample Selection Model\nLogit Unrestricted Restricted\nestimates firms firms\nTHRESH (Threshold for internal debt) -24.79\nColumn (1): dependent variable is binary with zero if firms' intercompany loans are below threshold and\nunity if above.

Heteroskedasticity robust standard\nerrors clustered at the level of country-year cells (in parentheses).\nresults for the second-step estimation are reported in Columns (2) and (3). Column\n(2) shows the determinants of intercompany loans in the sub-sample of firms where a\nthin-capitalization rule is not binding; Column (3) is concerned with the group where\na thin-capitalization rule is binding. Basically, the results confirm our findings from\nTable 4. For the unrestricted subsidiaries, asset tangibility and the existence of a loss\ncarry-forward show the expected effects and the statutory tax rate shows a signifi-\ncantly positive effect. For the restricted firms, the coefficients for asset tangibility and\nthe existence of a loss carry-forward show the same signs, but only the latter proves\nsignificant. Moreover, the coefficient for the statutory tax rate is negative, albeit in-\nsignificantly. The difference in the effects of the tax rate supports the view that binding\nthin-capitalization rules would effectively remove the tax incentive for tax planning via\nintercompany loans.\n6 The Impact of Thin-Capitalization Rules on Investment\nLet us finally consider the consequences for investment. Because no information about\nactual purchases of capital or about depreciation is given in the data, we have to rely\non the balance-sheet information for each individual affiliate's stock of fixed assets.\nAs a dependent variable we compute the change in the stock of fixed assets (in logs)\nwith regard to the previous period. Table 6 provides the respective regression results.\nColumns (1) and (2) report results from regressions without controlling for a par-\ntial adjustment process. While Column (1) employs the binary indicator of whether a\nTable 6: Thin-Capitalization Rules and Investment\n(ln)Fixed assets(t-1)\nDependent variable is the logarithmic difference of the fixed assets. Columns (1) to (4) report OLS estimates. Affiliate-\nand time-specific fixed effects included. Heteroskedasticity robust standard errors clustered at the level of country-year\ncells in parentheses. Column (5) and (6) report results from a first-differenced estimation following Arellano and Bond\n(1991). Heteroskedasticity robust standard errors clustered at the level of country-year cells following the suggestions of\nWindmeijer (2005) in parentheses. A star denotes significance at the 10% level and two stars at the 5% level.\nthin-capitalization rule exists or not, Column (2) utilizes the threshold level for internal\ndebt instead. Both estimations account for affiliate- as well as time-specific fixed effects.\nNevertheless, both regressions report significant effects of thin-capitalization rules. Col-\numn (1) indicates that the introduction of a thin-capitalization rule is accompanied with\nlower investment, whereas Column (2) indicates that tighter thin-capitalization rules\nexert an adverse effect on investment.\nColumns (3) and (4) report results including the lag of the stock of fixed assets (in\nlogs). Even though the lagged stock of capital is significant, the results on the control\nvariables are not much different, qualitatively. However, a problem with the dynamic\nspecification in Columns (3) and (4) is that it ignores a possible dynamic panel bias.\nTherefore, Columns (5) and (6) report results from a consistent dynamic panel data\nestimation procedure as suggested by Arellano and Bond (1991).16 Because test sta-\ntistics for overidentifying restrictions and autocorrelation do not point at specification\nerrors, and because the lagged stock of fixed assets shows a different coefficient, these\ninstrumental variable specifications are preferred.\nAgain, we find significant effects for both the existence of thin-capitalization rules and\ntheir tightness. Moreover, in accordance with theoretical predictions, a lower statutory\ntax rate is associated with a higher level of investment.17 With regard to the further\n16Given a time period of nine years available for the analysis, we employ a parsimonious GMM specification\nexploiting only the additional moment conditions with the level of the capital stock two periods ago.\n17While the statutory tax rate was adjusted in order to take account of special provisions for debt finance\n(see above), for the purpose of studying investment, both the basic statutory tax as well as the adjusted tax\nrate would matter. However, probably due to the rather small differences between the two tax rates, various\nalternative specification showed no significant differences.\ncontrol variables, we should note that estimations control for affiliate-specific fixed ef-\nfects which nest country-level fixed effects, and thus entirely remove cross-sectional\nvariation across countries. This might explain why, for instance, labor cost proves\ninsignificant. The lending rate shows a positive effect which potentially picks up infla-\ntion. Sales shows a strong positive coefficient pointing at positive market-size effects.\nThe negative impact of the loss carry-forward might simply reflect unfavorable profit\nprospects. Both regressions point to a significant adverse effect of thin-capitalization\nrules: firm-level investment is lower if a thin-capitalization rule is introduced or if these\nrules are tightened.\nWith regard to the implied magnitudes, we note first that according to Column (5)\nthe introduction of a thin-capitalization rule is associated with a decline in investment\nby about 5 percentage points. To illustrate the effect of the tightness of restrictions\nin Column (6) consider, once again, the case of a thin-capitalization rule with a debt-\nequity threshold of 1.5:1. If such a rule were to be repealed, the THRESH variable\nwould jump from a level of 0.6 to unity. According to the point estimate in Column\n(6), investment would increase by 8.72 percent.18 However, considering that the mean\nlimit in the dataset is 0.782, the removal of restrictions would exert a positive impact\non investment of 4.8 percent on average.\n18If we took the coefficient of the lagged stock of capital as a measure of the adjustment speed, we could\nderive a point estimate of 24.7% for the long-term effect on the stock of capital.\n7 Conclusions\nIn the last decade, governments in Europe and in other OECD countries have increas-\ningly restricted debt finance of multinationals by means of thin-capitalization rules.\nThese rules typically limit interest deduction if the debt-capital ratio related to share-\nholders is above a certain threshold. While the motivation of this measure of tax policy\nis to curb tax planning of multinationals by means of intercompany loans to and from\nforeign affiliates, effectiveness and consequences have not been analyzed, so far. Using\na micro-level panel dataset of German multinationals, this paper studies both the ef-\nfectiveness of the limitations as well as their impact on corporate decisions with regard\nto capital structure choice and investment.\nA theoretical discussion suggests that binding thin-capitalization restrictions would not\nonly result in a reduction of internal debt but also in a lower tax sensitivity of internal\ndebt. At the same time, binding restrictions should exert adverse effects on capital cost\nand, hence, reduce investment.\nThe empirical investigation is concerned with capital structure choice and investment\nof the subsidiaries of German multinationals in 36 countries in the time period between\n1996 and 2004. An analysis of the capital structure shows that more internal debt is\nused in host countries with high tax rates and where the borrowing cost of external\ndebt are high. The analysis also confirms that imposition and tightening of thin-\ncapitalization rules is, in fact, associated with a significant reduction in the use of\ninternal debt.\nIn a second step of the analysis, we compare the internal debt-to-capital ratio of the\nindividual affiliate with the restrictions in the respective host country. This allows\nus to distinguish affiliates which are most likely subject to binding thin-capitalization\nrestrictions from the others. A fixed effects panel regression for subsidiaries shows that\na significant tax sensitivity of internal debt is only found for those affiliates that do\nnot face binding restrictions. This result is further confirmed in a panel data sample\nselection model. It indicates that thin-capitalization restrictions effectively remove the\nincentive for tax planning by means of intercompany loans.\nIn a third step of the analysis, we consider investment in the subsidiaries' stock of\ncapital. While the analysis confirms an adverse effect of the local tax rate, invest-\nment is shown to be adversely affected by the imposition of a thin-capitalization rule.\nThis result is confirmed in regressions where investment is assumed to follow a partial\nadjustment process towards an optimal capital stock. The point estimate for the ad-\nverse impact of thin-capitalization rules on investment suggests that repealing a strict\n1.5:1 debt-equity ratio would result in an increase of investment by about 8.72 percent.\nGiven that most countries have less restrictive rules, the average impact of the removal\nof restrictions on investment is estimated to be 4.8 percent.\nThus, our results confirm that tax policy is facing a trade-off between limiting multi-\nnationals' tax planning and the real consequences of corporate taxation. This suggests\nthat tax policy should take account of the adverse investment effects of restrictions on\ntax planning by means of debt finance. Imposing restrictions alone does not enable tax\npolicy to escape the fundamental questions concerning the corporation tax raised by\nthe emergence of multinationals.\nDatasources and Definitions\nFirm-level data are taken from the micro-level dataset (MiDi) of the Deutsche Bun-\ndesbank. (See Lipponer (2006) for an overview.) The share of internal debt is\ndetermined by the level of balance-sheet internal liabilities divided by total capi-\ntal consisting of nominal capital, capital reserves, profit reserves, and total debt.\nInvestment is defined as the logarithmic difference in the balance-sheet position of\nfixed assets. Asset tangibility is defined as the ratio of fixed assets to balance-sheet\ntotal.\nCorporate taxation data are taken from the International Bureau of Fiscal Doc-\numentation (IBFD) and from tax surveys provided by Ernst&Young, Pricewa-\nterhouseCoopers (PwC), and KPMG. The statutory tax rate variable contains\nstatutory profit tax rates modified by applicable restrictions on interest deduc-\ntions.\nThin-Capitalization rules: Basic information about thin-capitalization rules is ob-\ntained from the same sources as the tax data. This information was augmented\nand cross-checked with questionnaires sent out to country experts of Pricewater-\nhouseCoopers.\nPresent values of depreciation are calculated for investments in machinery, assum-\ning a discount rate of 7.1 percent. Depreciation rules are taken from the references\nconsidered in case of corporate taxation data (see above).\nLending rates refer to private sector debt taken from the IMF International Financial\nStatistics Yearbook (2006) augmented with corresponding OECD figures.\nGDP in U.S. dollars, nominal.
