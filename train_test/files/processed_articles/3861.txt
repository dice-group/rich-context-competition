    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe shortage of literature regarding the tax administration burden, particularly in the hospitality and tourism sector in the\ncontext of least developed countries, still exists. This study, therefore, investigates the tax administration burden in the\ntourism sector in the Zanzibar Islands. It specifically examines the structure of tourism taxes and the fiscal regime, measures\nthe uncertainty and complexity of tax laws, and assesses the role played by business associations in facilitating collective action\nto reform the business environment of the tourism sector in this Archipelago. The study involved a survey of stakeholders\n(N = 135), including tourism investors, business associations, and relevant government agencies. The findings showed that\nuncertainty concerning the value added tax laws centered on calculation of the input tax, the input tax refund from mainland\nTanzania, and the registration procedure. The confusion was also pronounced regarding the specific laws affecting tour\noperators, restaurants, and the hotel levy. Similarly, there is still uncertainty concerning the infrastructure tax and the\nimposition of a tax of US$1 per day per guest staying in a hotel. Moreover, uncertainty and complexity regarding the income\ntax laws is centered on calculating the income tax liability of businesses, investments, and employment. However, the role of\nbusiness associations in reforming the business environment for tourism has been encouraging, as a good number of public\u00ad\nprivate dialogues and initiatives have been geared at negotiating the various forms of taxes and levies imposed on tourism\nand hospitality services in the Archipelago. The study concludes with managerial, policy, and research recommendations.\n",

Many governments\ntax tourism activities to generate revenue and to repair tour-\nism-related damage (Bird, 1992). Meanwhile, tourism inves-\ntors see tourism taxes as negatively affecting their businesses,\nas taxes increase prices. Consequently, these parties focus on\nthe tourism taxation system, the amount of taxes, and their\nimpact on business and government revenue.\nGlobally, tourism taxation has received a lot of attention.\nand Hazari and Ng (1993) investigated the objectives of tour-\nism taxation, while Gooroochurn and Sinclair (2005), Jensen\nied the impact of tourism taxation on tourists, the economy,\nand the welfare of the general public. However, there has\nbeen no work on the burden of tourism tax administration or\nthe uncertainty and complexity of the tax laws. This lack of\nfocus limits academic discussion on how to tax the tourism\nsector efficiently and effectively, leading to a meaningful\npolicy being formulated. Consequently, this study sought to\nmake a contribution by researching the structure of tourism\ntaxes and the fiscal regime, measuring the uncertainty and\ncomplexity of the tax laws, and assessing the role of business\nassociations in facilitating collective action to reform the\nbusiness environment of the tourism sector.\nMoreover, the tourism and hospitality sector is dominated\nby the private sector, which eventually shares the benefits of\nthe industry with the public sector in the form of taxes, con-\ntributions, fees, and levies (Anderson et al., 2017). This is the\nmain idea behind this study, which is to find out stakehold-\ners' perspectives on the tax administration burden when run-\nning a tourism business, and to propose an appropriate\nframework that would improve the business climate, leading\nto private sector development and eventually to poverty\nreduction among local communities.\nWe expect the article to contribute to the literature on tour-\nism taxation, public\u00adprivate dialogues and partnerships. The\narticle utilizes the measurement of the complexity of tax laws\ndevised by Jones, Rice, Sherwood, and Whiting (2015) to\nestimate the complexity of tourism taxation, with a view to\nidentifying areas where simplification is greatly needed, and\nto explore the uncertainty of the tax laws. Moreover, this\nstudy adds to the few articles examining tax administration\npublic\u00adprivate dialogues and partnerships (Anderson et al.,\n2017). This is because, many studies from developed coun-\nHasseldine, 1992; Schoonjans, Van Cauwenberge, Reekmans,\n& Simoens, 2011) have mainly focused on estimating tax\ncompliance costs. We expect the findings also to provide les-\nsons on how to promote the right conditions for private sector\ndevelopment, to inform good practice, and policy formation\nand to improve the business environment in Zanzibar.\nTo this end, the \"Literature Review\" section offers a\nreview of the literature. The \"Research Method\" section\npresents the study's research methodology. The \"Findings\"\nsection presents the data analysis and findings. The\n\"Conclusion\" section discusses the findings and draws con-\nclusions from the study.\nLiterature Review\nConceptualizing Tax Compliance in the Tourism\nSector\nTax compliance is important for the provision of public ser-\nvices because without adequate tax revenue the quality of\npublic services may deteriorate. Tax compliance means tax-\npayers fulfilling their obligations (Kirchler, 2007). However,\ngathering enough tax revenue is a problem faced by many\ncountries because of tax evasion and avoidance. Tax evasion\nis a deliberate illegal act intended to reduce someone's tax\nliability, while actions taken to legally reduce one's tax lia-\ncompliance may be more important today than in previous\nyears because many countries are tackling budget deficits.\nMoreover, tax compliance is important for achieving fairness\nand enhancing resource allocation (Alm, 1999).\nPrevious studies have shown that tax compliance is a func-\ntion of both economic and noneconomic factors. Economic\nfactors include tax rates, income level, penalties, and tax audit\nrate (Allingham & Sandmo, 1972). It has been observed that\nhigh tax rates, lower penalty rates, and a lower perceived\naudit rate decrease the tax compliance level (Dubin et al.,\ncompliance level increases with a reduction in tax rates,\nhigher penalty rates, and higher perceived audit rates\n(Andreoni, Erard, & Feinstein, 1998). Noneconomic factors\ninclude the age of taxpayers, the educational level of taxpay-\ners, confidence in the tax laws, social norms, and perceptions\nof the justice of the tax system. It has been found that older\ntaxpayers, educated taxpayers, and taxpayers with greater\nconfidence in the tax laws are more likely to pay their taxes\nthan young taxpayers, poorly educated taxpayers, and taxpay-\ners with less confidence in the tax laws (Cadsby, Maynes, &\ntaxpayers residing in a tax-compliant society are reported to\nbe more compliant than those coming from a noncompliant\none (O. H. Chang, Nichols, & Schultz, 1987). More impor-\ntantly, the tax compliance level is reported to be positively\nrelated to procedural justice (Mahangila & Holland, 2015). It\nhas also been reported that compliance costs and compliance\nlevels are negatively related (Mahangila, 2017). Tax compli-\nance costs are those relating to taxpayers fulfilling their\nresponsibilities (Evans, 2003). These tax compliance costs\ncomprise the time spent complying with tax laws, printing\ncosts, the cost of administering tax laws, and corruption that\nmainly takes place in administrative procedures.\nMahangila and Anderson 3\nTourism taxation embodies those taxes imposed on tour-\nists and/or the tourist industry (Council, 1998). There are\nmany reasons why governments focus on taxing the tourism\nsector, but, for the purpose of this research, we focused on\nthe major ones. First, in tourism-based countries or regions,\nthe sector is the major economic activity, leaving the country\nor region with fewer options when determining what activi-\nties to tax (Dombrovski & Hodzi, 2010; Gooroochurn &\nSinclair, 2003), and so most of the tax revenue may come\nfrom that sector.\nSecond, due to the specific nature of tourism, economists\nbelieve that taxing tourism activities will only have a small\nimpact on taxpayers'behavior (i.e., consuming less, or more,\nof the activity) if most of the taxes are borne by foreign tour-\nists (Gooroochurn & Sinclair, 2003). Consequently, govern-\nments favor imposing more taxes and levies on activities\nmostly undertaken by foreign tourists (Sheldon & Var, 1985),\nas a heavy local taxation burden may cause public discontent\nand negatively affect the political environment (Anderson,\n2009). In some cases, an increase in the tax rate may cause\nsome minor economic distortions, when, for example, a tour-\nist destination is unique in its nature, as this leaves tourists\nwithout alternative choices, and lowers the elasticity of sub-\nstitution. The elasticity of substitution is a measure of the\nease with which varying factors can be substituted for others\n(Hicks, 1932). In this case, it refers to how easily tourists can\nsubstitute one tourist destination (let us say Zanzibar) for\ncompeting destinations (e.g., Mombasa, Mauritius, etc.).\nThird, for destination managers, imposing taxes on tour-\nism activities serves as a means to recover the costs of the\npublic services and goods consumed by tourists (Varela,\n2011). For example, tourists consume infrastructure, such as\nroads, health services, and security while in a destination\ncountry. Thus, taxes simply recover the costs of servicing\ntourists. Environmental conservationists use taxation as one\nof the measures to regulate a destination's carrying capacity.\nA growth in the number of tourists, and the associated facili-\nties, is associated with increased pollution, congestion, deple-\ntion of natural resources, and a reduction in aesthetic value\n(B\u00f6hringer, Ferris, & Rutherford, 1998; Green, Hunter, &\nMoore, 1990). Consequently, funds are collected from tour-\nism activities to restore the damage caused by the industry.\nFourth, tourism taxation can be used to encourage the\nsmooth flow of tourists through the variability of tax rates\n(Varela, 2011). For example, in high season, an increase in\ntax rates for tourism may discourage some tourists from vis-\niting a given destination in that period, whereas a decrease in\ntax rates in low season may attract some tourists to visit such\na destination at that time, as the tourism package is cheaper.\nTax Compliance and Complexity of Tax Laws\nComplex tax laws are those with which it is difficult and\nexpensive to comply (Mulder, Verboon, & De Cremer, 2009).\nHowever, tax compliance occurs when a taxpayer\nregisters with the revenue authority as required; files the required\nreturns on time; accurately reports tax liability (in the required\nreturns) in accordance with the prevailing legislation, rulings,\nreturn instructions and court decisions; pays any outstanding\ntaxes as they fall due; and maintains all records as required.\nGenerally, the literature on how the complexity of tax laws\naffects tax compliance behavior remains controversial.\nScotchmer (1989) claimed that tax revenue authorities prefer\ncomplex tax laws to simple ones, because uncertainty is\nmore likely to induce tax compliance. Scotchmer (1989)\nargued that, even when taxpayers seek professional help to\nresolve complex tax problems, not all uncertainties are\nresolved. As taxpayers are penalized for noncompliance,\nthey, together with their tax return advisors, might react to\ntheremaininguncertaintiesbypayingmoreintax(Scotchmer,\ngested that complex tax laws may help tax authorities to win\ntax disputes and increase tax revenue. On the contrary, the\nconclusion that taxpayers might increase their compliance\nlevel, because the uncertainties and complexities of the tax\nlaws boost the likelihood of tax authorities winning cases,\nhas no empirical evidence to back it up.\nNevertheless, when tax fairness causes complexity in tax\nlaws, the complexity might increase tax compliance, because\ntax fairness is an important factor in tax compliance decision\nincrease in the inclination to pay taxes when distributive fair-\nness increased tax complexity. Distributive justice refers to\nthe fair allocation of the tax burden, and to governments pro-\nviding goods and services for taxpayers (Wenzel, 2002).\nCuccia and Carnes (2001) supported the view that tax\nfairness can increase tax compliance levels, even when the\ntax laws are complex. Cuccia and Carnes (2001) conducted a\nhypothetical experiment to determine how participants' per-\nceptions of procedural justice change when the complexity\nof tax laws was justified or not. They found that, when com-\nplex tax laws were justified, and when participants were pro-\nvided with tax relief, their perceptions of procedural justice\nwere more favorable than when the complexity of the tax\nlaws lacked justification and they had less tax relief (Cuccia\n& Carnes, 2001). Concern about the fairness of the distribu-\ntion of the tax burden and providing the public with goods\nand services is known as procedural justice (Leventhal,\nconfined to the effect of the complexity of tax laws on tax-\npayers' perceptions of procedural justice, tax compliance\ndecisions were excluded from it. Also, J. B. Chang, Lusk,\nand Norwood (2009) showed that hypothetical intentions\nmay differ from actual behavior.\nNevertheless, opposing evidence has suggested that\ncomplex tax laws produce negative attitudes toward tax\ncompliance (Kirchler, Niemirowski, & Wearing, 2006;\nMilliron, 1985). For instance, participants' attitudes toward\n4 SAGE Open\ntax compliance were most unfavorable when the complex-\nity of tax laws offered more tax noncompliance opportuni-\nties and when taxes were perceived to be unfair (Milliron,\n1985). Likewise, a hypothetical experiment revealed that\ntax avoidance decreases with precise tax laws (Richardson,\nFurthermore, the difficulty inherent in separating errors\nfrom deliberate tax evasion (Slemrod, 2007) could lead to\nthe punishment of innocent taxpayers, resulting in less confi-\ndence in the tax laws, which lowers taxpayers' disposition to\nsuggested that complex tax laws increase tax compliance\ncosts, create room for evasion and, when tax compliance\ncosts are far greater than the tax evasion opportunities, tax\ncompliance may suffer.\nTax Compliance Costs and Tax Administration\nBurden\nTax compliance costs are probably the major by-product of\nthe complexity of tax laws. Tax compliance costs have been\nfound to be significant and regressive (Alexander et al.,\nand money spent complying with tax laws by small firms in\nNew Zealand for 2 months and found a similar pattern.\nNevertheless, there has been concern that taxes in\nZanzibar in general, and the tourism sector in particular,\nmay not conform to the efficiency criterion of a good tax\nsystem (Zanzibar National Chamber of Commerce,\nIndustry, and Agriculture [ZNCCIA], 2013). Although\nthere is a general consensus that taxation is a necessary part\nof building a healthy economy, taxes must be reasonable,\ntransparent, and fair. In Zanzibar, this has not been the case\nbecause there is a general feeling in the tourist industry that\ntaxation has become a burden for taxpayers (The Citizen,\n2015). This has been reflected in an economic downturn,\nresulting in investors migrating from Zanzibar, taking with\nthem their potential for investment, transferable skills, and\nthe potential for creating employment. The World Bank\nranking of the business environment. Zanzibar's tax regime\nis perceived to be complex and uncertain because of the tax\nadministration burden.\nAs a result of this tax administration burden, there is a\nhigh level of discontent regarding Zanzibar's business\nenvironment. For instance, it has been discovered that\nmedium-sized businesses in Zanzibar make 48 tax pay-\nments, their profits are taxed at 40%, and they spend nearly\n160 hr annually complying with tax laws (World Bank,\ncountries made an average of 28 tax payments, while Sub-\nSaharan Africa made an average of 38 tax payments. In\ncontrast, businesses in similar tourism islands, such as the\nMaldives, made a single tax payment, their commercial\nprofits were taxed at 9.1%, and they spent less than 1 hr per\nyear on tax compliance. Thus, the Zanzibar tax regime lags\nfar behind similar economies.\nAccording to the ZNCCIA (2013), the complexity of\nZanzibar's tax regime reduces the competitiveness of the\nbusiness environment, including its vibrant tourist industry.\nTourism is a significant source of income for Zanzibar and\nIf the unfavorable climate persists, Zanzibar faces the possi-\nbility of losing the benefits of the tourist industry. The indus-\ntry is well-known for its ability to create jobs for Zanzibaris\nand Tanzanians in general, to develop the human resource\nbase, to provide capital across the industry, to protect and\nconserve natural attractions, to preserve and celebrate\nZanzibar's unique culture, to contribute substantially to the\ntax base, and to contribute to poverty alleviation, by working\nwith local communities. The fact that foreign investors are\nmigrating from Zanzibar due to, among other factors, the\nquantity, cumbersomeness, and complexity of the taxation\nsystem and its administrative procedures, means that the\neconomy of Zanzibar will continue to decline if the neces-\nsary interventions continue to be ignored. Thus, this study\nwas aimed at investigating the tax administration burden on\nthe tourism sector in the Zanzibar Islands.\nResearch Methodology\nThis study used a qualitative-descriptive approach (Lambert\n& Lambert, 2012) by collecting primary and secondary data\nthrough in-depth interviews and reviewing the literature and\ndocuments. This in-depth interview approach is important\nfor gaining an understanding of the research problem\n(Hammersley & Atkinson, 2007). Secondary sources of data\nwere chosen to reveal the complexity and uncertainty of tax\nlaws, which previous research has not done. Specifically, the\nsecondary sources of data were the East Africa Customs and\nValue Added Tax (VAT) Act Number 4 of 1998, local excise\nduty, the petroleum levy, under the Petroleum Levy Act\nNumber 7 of 2001, Stamp Duty, supervised under Act\nNumber 6 of 1996, Infrastructure TaxAct, underAct Number\n9 of 2015, and the Hotel, Restaurant and Tour Operation\nLevy, which all fall under the Hotel Levy Act of 1995. In\nincluded in this study.\nThe interviews took place between July and November\n2015. The population consisted of tourism stakeholders,\nnamely, tax authorities, hoteliers, airline staff, tour operators,\nrestaurateurs, the Zanzibar International Film Festival\n(ZIFF), and Sauti ya Busara, together with other service pro-\nviders supporting tourism investors, such as auditors and tax\nconsultants in Zanzibar. Each business was either directly\nrelated to the tourism sector or helping it to comply with\ntaxation laws in Zanzibar.\nMahangila and Anderson 5\nSixty-nine of the interviewees were tourism investors:\nhoteliers (52%), tour operators (29%), sky-diving business\noperators (2%), restaurateurs (13%), and festival organizers,\nthat is, ZIFF and Sauti ya Busara (4%). Also, 30 tax consul-\ntants were interviewed about uncertainty, tax administration\nprocedures, and the complexity of the tax laws, because\nmany tourism investors depend on their tax consultants to\nenable them to comply with the tax laws. In addition, 36\nrespondents came from the Zanzibar Investment Promotion\nAgency (17%), the Zanzibar Commission for Tourism (8%),\nthe Tanzania Revenue Authority\u00adZanzibar (11%), the\nMinistry of Tourism (8%), the Copyright Society of Zanzibar\n(6%), the Ministry of Finance and Planning (14%), the\nZanzibar Revenue Board (ZRB; 17%), the Zanzibar Airport\nAuthority (3%), the Ministry of Land\u00adZanzibar (3%), the\nZanzibar Office of Statistics (8%), and the Ministry of Local\nGovernment (3%).\nBecause the qualitative approach was taken by this\nresearch, an open-ended questionnaire was used to solicit\ndetailed responses from the respondents. The guiding\nquestions ranged from \"What areas or sections of the\nIncome Tax Act 2004 do you consider to be uncertain?\"\nand \"Why do you consider them to be uncertain?\" to \"What\nshould be done to improve certainty in these areas?\"\nSimilar questions were asked about other tax laws. A ques-\ntion on the role of business associations in reforming the\nbusiness environment of the tourism sector in Zanzibar\nwas asked of business associations in the tourism and asso-\nciated sectors. The data provided were important for iden-\ntifying the fees and taxes payable by the tourism sector in\nZanzibar. It should be noted that the results were limited to\na discussion of the responses from those involved in the\ntourist industry and their consultants, and that responses\nfrom government officials were used for triangulation pur-\nposes and to validate the findings. Finally, descriptive and\nreflective approaches were adopted to analyze and report\non the qualitative data (Eisenhardt, 1989). The findings are\npresented below.\nFindings\nStructure of Tourism Taxes and Fiscal Regime in\nZanzibar\nThere are three tax authorities in Zanzibar, namely, the\nTanzania Revenue Authority (TRA; Zanzibar), the ZRB, and\nthe local government authorities. The TRA administers\nincome tax under the Income TaxAct of 2004, which includes\nboth corporate and personal incomes, and customs and excise\nduty, under the East Africa Customs and Management Act of\n2004. On the contrary, the ZRB manages VAT, under the VAT\nAct Number 4 of 1998, local excise duty, the petroleum levy,\nunder the Petroleum Levy Act Number 7 of 2001, stamp\nduty, which is paid by all traders, at 3% of their sales, and\nsupervised under Act Number 6 of 1996, the infrastructure\ntax, under Act Number 9 of 2015, and the hotel, restaurant,\nand tour operator levy, which all fall under the Hotel Levy\nIn total, the Zanzibar taxation system charges 10 different\ntaxes, three of which are specifically for the tourist industry.\nThe general taxes are income tax, petroleum levy, customs\nand excise tax, infrastructure tax, VAT, stamp duty, excise\nduty (local), and property tax. In addition to the seven gen-\neral taxes, the tourist industry has to pay a hotel levy, a res-\ntaurant levy, and a tour operator levy in accordance with the\nZRB (see Figure 1).\nFigure 1. Classification of Zanzibar's tax structure.\n6 SAGE Open\nMeasuring the Uncertainty and Complexity of the\nTax Laws\nMeasuring tax complexity has been a difficult area for tax\nresearchers. A complexity index developed by Jones et al.\n(2015) was used to assess the complexity of Zanzibar's tax\nlaws. The index is an investigative instrument used to iden-\ntify necessary and unnecessary complexities. According to\nJones et al. (2015), necessary complexities are those needed\nto achieve the objectives of the tax policy, and they can only\nbe changed if the objectives are changed, while an unneces-\nsary complexity is that which can be changed without chang-\ning the tax policy objectives. This index divides tax laws into\nseveral important tax areas, and considers small tax laws as\nsingle, distinct tax areas. Ironically, stamp duty, the infra-\nstructure tax, petroleum levy, customs, and hotel levy tax\nlaws were taken as a single tax area. However, the income\ntax law was divided into 20 separate tax sections, and the\nVAT law was divided into six separate tax areas. These areas\nare indicated in the rows in Table 1.\nThe index comprises measures of \"underlying complex-\nity\" and the \"impact of complexity.\" The authors defined\nunderlying complexity as \"a measure of the complexity of\nthe `maze'through which a taxpayer would be required to go\nto comply with their tax responsibilities and to understand\ntheir tax obligations (and the result of those obligations) with\nno prior knowledge\" (Jones et al., 2015, p. 5). The impact of\ncomplexity measures the impact of underlying complexity in\nterms of how many taxpayers are affected by a particular\nindicator, the total tax compliance and administration costs,\nthe ability of taxpayers affected by an indicator, and the\npotential loss of revenue due to a specific cause (Jones et al.,\n2015). However, there was no information to enable mea-\nsurement of the impact of complexity and, therefore, only the\nunderlying complexity was measured in this study.\nThe underlying complexity measure comprises policy\ncomplexity, legislative complexity, and operational com-\nplexity. Policy complexity measures the complexity result-\ning from the governmental policy objectives of giving tax\nexemptions and tax relief and changing tax laws.\nConsequently, the policy complexity of a tax law is identified\nby two indicators: the number of exemptions plus the num-\nber of those receiving tax relief in that law and the number of\nfinance acts with tax law changes. It is generally accepted\nthat a tax law that increases the number of exemptions or\nthose given tax relief increases its complexity, in terms of\ndeciding whether or not a taxpayer/income/transaction is\nexempt from tax (Barazzoni, Cerri, & Hepburn, 2006). Also,\nfrequent changes in tax laws, through the passing of Finance\nActs or otherwise, increases the complexity of tax laws, as\ntaxpayers or tax consultants have to spend more time famil-\niarizing themselves with the changes (Barazzoni et al., 2006).\nLegislative complexity measures how difficult it is to\nunderstand a tax law. This indicator is measured using a read-\nability index, scoring 1 when it is simple to read, 3 when it is\nof medium difficulty, and 5 when it is difficult. This score is\nsubject to participants' perception of the scores and, there-\nfore, two tax consultants were involved in scoring this index.\nLegislative complexity is also measured by the number of\npages in the legislation because it is assumed that people\nassociate longer texts with complexity (Jones et al., 2015).\nFinally, operational complexity indicates how complex it\nis to use the guidance provided by the tax authorities to facil-\nitate compliance with the tax laws. The tax guidance docu-\nments include, but are not limited to, practice notices,\nbrochures containing tax information, and regulations about\nhow to apply tax laws. Complexity of the guidance given by\nthe TRA and ZRB was assigned 1, 3, or 5 if it was straight-\nforward, of medium complexity, and complex, respectively.\nThe scoring was based on the length of the guidance, the ease\nof navigation, other guidance information, and the frequency\nof change. Furthermore, operational complexity relates to\nthe complexity of the information required to make a tax\nreturn, which measures the degree of difficulty of gathering\ninformation to meet tax compliance obligations. In this case,\nthe complexity of information was assigned 1, 3, or 5 if it\nwas straightforward (using available information), of\nmedium complexity (simple computation), and complex\n(requiring difficult computation), respectively. Again, these\nscorings are subjective, and so the scoring was done by the\ntwo tax consultants mentioned previously.\nAfter the scoring was completed, the scores of each indi-\ncator was normalized to get a scale of values of between 0\nand 1 using the standardization formula: Y1\n= (Y \u00ad Ymin\n) /\n(Ymax\n\u00ad Ymin\n) (Jones et al., 2015), where \"Y\" is the value of the\nindicator of a tax measure, \"Ymin\n\" represents an indicator's\nlowest value across all tax measures, and Ymax\nindicates the\nhighest. An aggregation formula ((Y1\n+ . . . n1\nwas then used to transform the index to give scores of\nbetween 1 and 10, where n1 represents a normalized indica-\ntor and 6 represents the indicators of underlying complexity,\nwhich are indicated in the third row from number of exemp-\ntions/relief to complexity of information required to make a\nreturn. The multiplying factor 10 was included to produce a\nfinal index of a definite number between two defined points,\ncomplex (see the study by Jones et al., 2015, for further\ninformation). In this case, all six indicators had equal weight-\nings to increase clarity, remove the need to change weight-\nings when the tax system changes, enable comparability of\nthe complexity of the system over time as the scores are not\nweighed (Jones et al., 2015), and reduce subjectivity in mea-\nsuring complexity.\nComplexity of Tax Laws in Zanzibar\nThere is a general feeling among private sector stakeholders\nthat the main challenges facing the tourism sector include\nhaving too many unpredictable taxes.

According to a report by the ZNCCIA (2013), com-\nplexities of the Zanzibar tax regime reduce the competitive-\nness of the business environment, including its vibrant tourist\nindustry, and in fact they are of the opinion that there is unfair\ntreatment and many complexities when it comes to tax\nadministration in the sector (see Figure 2). More specifically,\nthe Zanzibar Income Tax Act, 2004, shows the underlying\ncomplexity of tourism taxes in general. For instance, Section\n7 of the Income Tax Act (2004) has nine types of tax relief or\nexemptions, whereas other sections in the Income Tax Act\n2004 have between zero and two exemptions. Section 7 has\nlisted employment income and exempt employment income,\nrepeating most of the employment income, but granting\nexemptions when certain conditions are met. This repetition\nof the same items makes it difficult to calculate employment\nincome. However, the second schedule of the Act contains a\nlist of 20 exempted incomes or taxpayers. This schedule was\ncreated to streamline the exemptions to income tax into a\nsingle list.\nActs. This section deals with changes in the ownership of an\nentity and attempts to prevent tax avoidance practices by\nimposing taxes on capital gains when ownership of the entity\nchanges by more than 50%. Thus, these changes in the sec-\ntions may reflect the TRA's efforts to protect tax revenue.\nIn terms of the readability index, the definition of perma-\nnent establishment covered in Part VI Division II, Section 3\nof the Act defines key terms and individual income tax struc-\ntures, and Section 66, dealing with residential status, both\nscored 3 points, meaning they had medium readability com-\nplexity. These sections and the first schedule treated the\nvarious tax issues they presented differently, and section 7 in\nparticular lacked clarification and used long sentences to\nexplain the taxation of employment income, which confused\nreaders. These findings implied that the legislative complex-\nity of these factors was medium. Also, the number of pages\npages, during this period.\nSection 56 and the taxation of foreign-controlled entities\nwere perceived to have greater guidance complexity and\nrequired complex information to file returns. These percep-\ntions may be attributed to the lack of clear guidance by the\nTRA and because the information that is supposed to be\nfiled, or recomputed, is different from the common informa-\ntion that taxpayers are given. The remaining sections of the\nIncome Tax Act were perceived to be either simple or of\nmedium operational complexity.\nThe complexity of theThe East Africa Customs and Management\nAct, 2004.This was generally perceived to be simple,\nalthough it was the longest Act, with 168 pages. The read-\nability index was of medium complexity as there was little\ntaxpayer guidance information and so the operational com-\nplexity was medium.\nThe complexity of the VAT Act, 1998. Most of the changes in\nthe VAT Act were made in the first schedule (11) and the\nsecond schedule (23), while only one change in each was\nmade in Sections 6 and 7. These findings imply that the pol-\nicy was not complex, due to few changes in the Act and\nbecause many of the exemptions/relief were listed in the first\nand second schedules of the Act. In terms of the readability\nindex, the Act was rated as simple due to its short and\nstraightforward explanations, while the number of pages\nremained constant at 38 for the study period. This signifies\nFigure 2. Simplifying the process of paying taxes will improve the ease of doing business, encourage compliance, stimulate economic\ngrowth, and boost employment.\nMahangila and Anderson 9\nthat the Act was not complex. The operational complexity of\nthe VAT Act of 1998 was generally at a low level because\nmost of the sections were simple and had straightforward\nexplanations, while the numbers of its pages remained the\nsame during the reporting period. Regarding operational\ncomplexity, all sections were rated simple due to their clear\nand straightforward explanations. Thus, the VAT Act was\nfound to be simple and clear.\nThe complexity of the Hotel Levy Act, 1995. The Act had only\none exemption/relief, and only two Finance Acts changed\nsimple and theAct had only nine pages, which remained con-\nstant during the reporting period. These findings imply that\nthe policy was not complex nor was the legislative index of\nthe hotel levy, which had clear and straightforward explana-\ntions. Similarly, the guidance provided and the information\nneeded for filing a return were both perceived to be simple\nand straightforward.\nThe complexity of the Infrastructure Tax law.This was a new\nlaw, which had only one page and no changes. It was clear\nand straightforward in terms of readability, guidance, and the\ninformation required to fill in returns.\nexemptions/relief and had changed twice between 2010 and\n2015. These findings imply that policy complexity was\nmedium, as well as the legislative index, as indicated by a\nreadability index score of 3 and the number of pages of the\nAct at 57. The readability index was rated medium because\nsome sections used difficult vocabulary or terms.\nFinally, it was perceived that both the guidance provided\nand the information needed to make a return were of medium\ncomplexity as the guidance was not straightforward and\nadditional information, other than that commonly available,\nwas required when filing returns.\nUncertainty of the Tax Laws in Zanzibar\nThe Income Tax Act 2004. The areas perceived to be uncer-\ntain were the calculation of income tax liability from busi-\nness, investment, and employment incomes. Calculation of\nthe depreciation allowance, unallocated income, and the resi-\ndential status of taxpayers were also mentioned as areas of\nuncertainty, probably because the legislation had been badly\ndrafted. Moreover, it was difficult to differentiate sources of\nbusiness income from investment income. For example,\ntourism investor respondents commented that\nIt is unclear if rental income from the lease of a hotel should be\ncategorized as business or investment income.\nThe way a foreign-controlled corporation is treated in terms of\ndistributing its unallocated income to its members is ambiguous.\nSources of employment income are listed followed by another\nlist of exempt employment income repeating almost the same\nsources of employment income.\nAccordingly, uncertainty of the income tax laws was mainly\ncaused by limited practice and training, incomplete defini-\ntions of the key terms, and inadequate drafting of the tax law.\nThese findings are in line with the findings of the complexity\nindex previously presented.\nThe East African Customs and Management Act 2004.Many\nrespondents were unaware of the customs tax laws. How-\never, a few were of the opinion that customs tax liability\non imported goods was uncertain as this was usually\ndetermined by tax officials. One tourism investor respon-\ndent stated,\nCustoms tax liability is usually charged according to a tax\nofficial's decision and not based on the actual goods imported\ninto the country.\nThe introduction of customs tax calculators, where taxpayers\ncan enter details of imported goods and know their tax liabil-\nity, could resolve this uncertainty. However, it is possible\nthat tax officials might be exploiting taxpayers' ignorance to\ncollect more taxes.\nThe VAT Act 1999. The ZRB failed to properly communicate\na change in the treatment of the input tax paid in mainland\nTanzania, where taxpayers continued to deduct it. However,\nthe new treatment does not allow the input taxes paid on the\nmainland to be deducted by taxpayers in Zanzibar, as noted\nby two of the tourism investors:\nZRB tends to refuse the input tax from Mainland Tanzania and\nthere is no clear regulation on it.\nWhere a taxable person pays tax to a taxable person in mainland\nTanzania for any taxable supply, the taxable person in Zanzibar\nis unable to claim the input tax. It is a problem.\nClearly, this finding implies that taxpayers were unaware of\nthis change. When following this up with ZRB, it was dis-\ncovered that input tax paid in mainland Tanzania was no lon-\nger deductible in Zanzibar, following the abolition of the\nreciprocal arrangement with mainland Tanzania. This\narrangement allowed the TRA in mainland Tanzania to col-\nlect output taxes from persons on the mainland who pur-\nchased goods and services for the purpose of importing them\ninto Zanzibar. Then, after collection, the TRA in mainland\nTanzania paid the amount to the Zanzibar Revolutionary\nGovernment.\nIt seems that the limited time between the introduction of\ntax law changes and implementation of the changes may\nhave caused this inconsistency between taxpayers and the tax\nauthorities.\nLikewise, VAT registration criteria and procedures were\nuncertain as they were used to calculate penalties for various\nbreaches of the Act, as well as interest. Moreover, undue\ndelays in refunding VAT was cited as one of the uncertainties\nof this Act. These delays may cause businesses financial\nstress as their working capital is stranded at the ZRB. One\nrespondent from the tourism investors stated,\nThere are no known registration procedures as it all depends on\nthe decision of the commissioner.\nThe Hotel Levy Act 1995. This Act covers three taxes: Hotel\nLevy, Tour Operator Levy, and Restaurant Levy. This con-\nsolidation of three taxes was perceived to be a source of\nuncertainty when determining what, and how much, tax to\npay. As one tourism investor stated,\nThere is no specific law for the tour operator levy or restaurant\nlevy which has been included in the Hotel Levy Act.\nIt is arguable that it would be better to have three separate\nlaws for these three taxes. However, consolidation of the tax\nlaws was advised so as to reduce the administrative burden\n(Barazzoni et al., 2006). Therefore, the Hotel Levy Act\nshould comprise separate sections for hoteliers, restaura-\nteurs, and tour operators to remove this confusion.\nAlso, some tour operator respondents complained about\nbeing forced to pay the US$5,000 tour operator levy during\nthe low season, when income from tourism is low. This not\nonly denied investors badly needed working capital, but also\nincreased compliance costs.\nThe Infrastructure Tax Law 2015. This Law lacked definition\nof key terms, although it was the simplest law, but the lack of\ndefinitions limited its implementation. For instance, the law\nimposed an infrastructure tax of US$1 per day per guest stay-\ning in a hotel. A hotel investor respondent said,\nThe law does not define all legal terms, including \"guest\" in this\nlaw, the guest can be either an adult or a child, but the law is\nsilent on this.\nThere were also concerns about why the tax was being paid\nin U.S. dollars when the taxpayers did not receive an income\nin dollars (a reply from a hotel investor respondent), particu-\nlarly when guests were residents of Zanzibar or mainland\nTanzania.\nTax Administration Burden\nThe Zanzibar tax system operates through self-assessment,\nwhereby taxpayers determine their tax liability and pay their\ntaxes to the tax authorities: the TRA-Zanzibar, the ZRB, the\nlocal government authorities, and other regulatory authori-\nties. However, the tax system still requires taxpayers to visit\nseveral offices and file several documents to fulfill their\nobligations (see Figure 3). In addition, taxpayers make more\nthan 48 compulsory payments included in these estimations\nper year, as shown in Table 2.\nIn this study, we asked tourism investors to estimate the\ntime spent complying with the tax regime. This time was\nthen used to estimate compliance costs, based on the unit\ncosts found in Doing Business in Zanzibar (World Bank,\nsector. These were the costs of printing/photocopying, trans-\nport, time spent processing information, those associated\nwith disputes, such as reprinting costs, labor time, and con-\nsultancy costs. The average cost of complying with the\n(US$640.36) per annum. However, Zanzibar has an esti-\nmated 5,000 registered taxpayers and, when this cost is\nextrapolated, the impact of tax administration costs was TZS\nthe findings of P. E. Lignier, Evans, and Tran-Nam (2014),\nwho discovered that tax compliance costs were growing,\ndespite the government's efforts to reduce them.\nThe Role of Business Associations in Reforming\nthe Business Environment of the Tourism Sector\nin Zanzibar\nThere are several associations that support the development\nof the tourism sector in the Archipelago. The main ones are\nthe ZATI (ZATI), the Zanzibar Association of Tour Guides\n(ZATOGA), the Zanzibar Employees' Association\n(ZANEMA), the Tanzania Private Sector Foundation\n(TPSF), the ZNCCIA, the Ecotourism Association, and the\nHotel Restaurants' and Alliance Union. However, ZATI is\nthe largest association, which was established in 2003 to\nrepresent the interests of all tourism investors in Zanzibar\nand acts as the voice of the tourism private sector. With\naround 106 members from various industries in the tourism\nsector, such as hotels (60), tour operators (10), suppliers\n(eight), water space (eight), restaurants (five), shops (three),\na consultant (one) and health official (one; also see Pasape\net al., 2013), ZATI unites and represents all members in the\ntourism sector of Zanzibar and defends the rights and inter-\nests of stakeholders in it.\nMoreover, the Association acts as a link between mem-\nbers of the tourism sector and the government on matters of\nsocioeconomic policies; advises and cooperates closely with\nthe government in formulating policies and programs relat-\ning to the tourist industry and its promotion internally and\nexternally; supports, stimulates and catalyzes socioeconomic\ndevelopment; and conducts research on socioeconomic\ndevelopment and the tourist industry and shares its findings\nwith stakeholders. By so doing, ZATI has been successful\nrecently in pushing for changes to the VAT Amendment and\nreviewing the tax regime, with the aim of improving the ease\nof doing business in Zanzibar. The Association has also been\nsuccessful in initiating and implementing a public\u00adprivate\nMahangila and Anderson 11\npartnership (PPP) to create a better tourism environment for\nboth investors and tourists. Moreover, ZATI represents the\nprivate sector in meetings with government authorities in\nZanzibar to discuss business challenges. ZATI frequently\ncommissions studies (including the most recent ones by\nMahangila & Anderson, 2016) to compile evidence to feed\ninto dialogue with the government. The most recent studies,\nfor example, have enabled ZATI to convince the government\nto speed up the creation of an electronic tax system to allow\nbusinesses to pay taxes not only in U.S. dollars, but also in\nthe local currency (i.e., Tanzanian Shillings), to extend the\nVAT filing date from 7 to 10 days, to consolidate existing\ntaxes and to stop introducing new taxes (also see Masare,\n2016). Generally, the role of business associations in reform-\ning the business environment of the tourism sector in\nZanzibar has been felt by it.\nConclusion\nComplexity and uncertainty in the tax system lead to a\ngreater administrative burden and thus to higher compliance\ncosts, based on earlier arguments, than to lower compliance\ncosts. However, this study has revealed tremendous uncer-\ntainty regarding the income tax laws in Zanzibar centered on\nthe calculation of input taxes, input tax refunds from main-\nland Tanzania, and the registration procedure. There is no\nspecific law for the tour operator levy, restaurant levy, and\nFigure 3. Zanzibar tax administration burdens.\nNote. TRA = Tanzania Revenue Authority; ERCA = Ethiopian Revenues and Customs Authority; ICFA = Investment Climate Facility For Africa.\nTable 2.

VAT = value added tax; PAYE = pay as you earn.\nhotel levy, which caused uncertainty regarding the Hotel\nLevy Act. Similarly, uncertainty regarding the infrastructure\ntax was due to the absence of a clear interpretation of certain\nterms used in the law and to the imposition of the tax of\nUS$1 per day per guest staying in a hotel. Furthermore, there\nwas uncertainty about the change in the treatment of input\ntax paid in mainland Tanzania, the calculation of penalties\nand offenses, and the registration procedure. The results\nshow that many respondents identified that uncertainty con-\ncerning the income tax laws centered on the calculation of\nthe income tax liability for businesses, investors, and employ-\ners. Although some laws were found to be simple, most were\nfound to be of medium complexity. This calls for minor mod-\nifications in the tax system, to make it simpler for both users\nand the TRA. Specifically, Section 56, the second schedule,\nSection 7 of the Income Tax Act 2004, and the Stamp Duty\nAct were the most complex areas, whereas the Infrastructure\nTax Act was found to be the simplest tax law.\nMoreover, the Zanzibar tax regime was found to be com-\nplex and uncertain and it imposed a heavy burden on the\ntourism sector, both in terms of the amount of tax paid and\nthe administrative burden. The Ministry for Finance should\nissue more detailed regulations concerning the tax laws and\nshould implement rules whereby these regulations should\nclarify any uncertainty and areas identified as being complex\nshould be given practical examples. Furthermore, it would\nbe helpful to collate and circulate data from time to time and\nto publicize the results of proceedings and the differences of\nopinion between the TRA, the ZRB, or local government\nauthorities (LGAs) and the taxpayer.\nFurthermore, the creation of binding rules, a \"prior\ntaxation agreement\" (with characteristics similar to the\n\"rulings\" existing in other countries and in mainland\nTanzania under Section 11 of the Tax Administration Act,\n2015), would ensure that taxpayers would be certain, in\nterms of Zanzibar's domestic taxes, about the taxation for\na specific transaction or activity before engaging in it.\nCertainty could also be provided for taxpayers in relation\nto legislative changes, by ensuring that these are adopted\nby them before they come into force. This would enable\ntaxpayers to establish adequate systems and to incorporate\nthe legislative framework in their business planning.\nConsequently, the Ministry of Finance, working with the\nTRA, the ZRB, and local government authorities, should\nconsolidate taxes to target the same tax base and the same\ntaxpayer. Without reducing government revenue, excise\nduty would become TZS 2000, which would reduce tax\nadministration costs and the amount of work needed to\ncollect the excise duty.\nThe tax administration burden not only consumes gov-\nernment revenue (Mahangila, 2017), but it has also been\ndiscovered that heavier tax burdens can significantly pre-\nvent the formation of new enterprises (Braunerhjelm et al.,\nthe formation of businesses by 4%. It is important to reduce\nthis burden, which could be done through consolidating\ntaxes and fees, introducing an electronic tax system, avoid-\ning the duplication of information required by the govern-\nment, raising business owners' awareness of new\nregulations, and creating One-Stop Centers (Mattia &\nShawn, 2010). This would reduce the number of payments\nto one, rather than taxpayers having to make three pay-\nments each time. There should be a combined (single pay-\nment) reporting and collection arrangement for Employers'\nPay As You Earn (PAYE), Pension Fund, and Health\nContributions, because all of them are payable on the 15th\nof each month. To simplify the tax regime, social security\ncontributions, health insurance, and PAYE should be paid\ntogether as one payment (see Figure 4).\nFurthermore, the introduction of an electronic system\nwould enable the ZRB to have access to taxpayers' data,\nand the frequency of filing VAT returns should be reduced\nto being semiannual, as is done with PAYE, as this would\nreduce the bureaucratic burden of businesses. Reducing the\nfrequency of filing returns and combining tax payments\nwould also reduce tax administration costs. Moreover,\ncombining tax payments would not affect the financial\nposition of any of the stakeholders involved as the tax bur-\nden and contribution to it are constant. With public\u00adprivate\ndialogue and partnerships, the tax administration burden\nwould be a lot less. Future studies should measure the\nimpact of public\u00adprivate dialogue on tax reforms. Moreover,\nthe TRA-Zanzibar and ZRB should simplify the areas of\ncomplexity and uncertainty identified, either by redrafting\nthe tax laws or their sections, not only because a certain tax\nsystem enables the government to make realistic tax esti-\nmations but also because it makes it easier to comply with\ntax laws. The provision of comprehensive guidelines is\nstrongly recommended to reduce the uncertainty and com-\nplexity of tax laws. Similarly, a stable and predictable tax\nsystem enhances simplicity of tax laws as taxpayers know\nwhat is expected of them.\nLast but not least, the government should avoid frequent\nchanges in the laws and, when changes are necessary, it\nshould engage taxpayers in a consultative process through\npublic\u00adprivate dialogues. The use of public\u00adprivate dialogues\nwhen setting policy priorities, informing policy design,\nimproving legislative proposals, and incorporating feedback\nin regulatory implementation is always encouraged (World\nBank Group, 2014). Joint decision making by the private and\npublic sector usually leads to better policies that are properly\nexecuted. However, as this study focused on the tax adminis-\ntration burden, we encourage future studies to obtain insights\ninto the role of public\u00adprivate dialogues and partnerships in\ntax formulation and administration--the extent, opportuni-\nties, and the gaps--so as to safeguard the interests of the pub-\nlic sector without compromising the quality of the business\nenvironment, economic growth, and poverty alleviation.\nMahangila and Anderson 13\nAppendix\nFigure 4.
