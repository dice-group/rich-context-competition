This study examined\ntrends in prescribed antihypertensive medication use among US adults with hypertension and compared drug utilization\npatterns with recommendations of the Sixth Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and\nTreatment of High Blood Pressure.\nMethods and Results--Persons aged 18 years from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys were\nidentified as hypertensive on the basis of either a blood pressure 140/90 mm Hg or self-reported current treatment for\nhypertension with a prescription medication. In 1999\u00ad2002, 62.9% of US hypertensive adults took a prescription\nantihypertensive medication use increased with age, was lower among men than among women, and was lower among\nMexican Americans than among non-Hispanic whites and blacks. Multiple antihypertensive drug use increased from\n29.1% to 35.8% (P0.001). Polytherapy with a calcium channel blocker, -blocker, or angiotensin-converting enzyme\ninhibitor significantly increased by 30%, 42%, and 68%, respectively, whereas monotherapy with a diuretic or -blocker\nsignificantly decreased. For hypertensives with diabetes, congestive heart failure, or a prior heart attack, the utilization\npatterns closely followed the Sixth Joint National Committee guideline recommendations.\nConclusions--Antihypertensive medication use and multiple antihypertensive medication use among US hypertensive\nadults increased over the past 10 years, but disparities by sociodemographic factors continue to exist.

To understand\ncurrent medication utilization patterns among hypertensives,\nantihypertensive medication use among US adults with\nhypertension.\nMethods\nsurveys designed to select a nationally representative sample of the\ncivilian noninstitutionalized US population with oversampling of\nyoung children, older persons, black persons, and Mexican Ameri-\ncans. Data collected during NHANES III11 are comparable to\nin-person home interview, followed by a physical examination\nincluding blood pressure measurements at a mobile examination\ncenter. Informed consent was obtained from all participants, and the\nprotocol was approved by the institutional review board of the\nNational Center for Health Statistics.\nDuring the home interview, participants were asked, \"Have you\ntaken or used any prescription medicines in the past month?\"\nRespondents who answered affirmatively were further asked to\nreport the name, duration, and main reason for each product used. An\ninterviewer recorded the exact product name from the medication\ncontainer label. If the container was unavailable, the participant\nverbally reported this information. With the use of the JNC VI and\nJNC VII list of oral antihypertensive drugs4,7 and the assistance of\npharmacists at the Food and Drug Administration, antihypertensive\nagents reported by participants in NHANES III and NHANES\ndefined as a report of using 1 or more of these drugs. Six therapeutic\ndrug classes including -blockers, CCBs, diuretics, ACE inhibitors,\nARBs, and other antihypertensive agents (\n-blockers, central \n-\nagonists, direct vasodilators, and other centrally acting drugs) were\nclassified. A person could have used more than 1 antihypertensive\nmedication within the past month or an antihypertensive medication\ncontaining more than 1 antihypertensive active ingredient. In both\ncases, the person was counted once within each antihypertensive\ndrug class used. Persons who used an antihypertensive medication\nwith only 1 active ingredient were defined as receiving monotherapy.\nThose taking more than 1 active ingredient (either in 1 combination\npill or in 2 different single pills) were defined as receiving\npolytherapy.\nBlood pressure was measured with the participant in the sitting\nposition after 5 minutes of rest by a physician at the mobile\nexamination center. The average of up to 3 measurements was used.\nHypertension was defined as a mean systolic blood pressure\n140 mm Hg, or a mean diastolic blood pressure 90 mm Hg, or\ncurrent hypertension treatment with prescription medication (affir-\nmative answers to the following sequence of questions: \"Has a\ndoctor ever told you that you had high blood pressure?\"; \"Because of\nyour high blood pressure, have you ever been told to take prescribed\nmedicine?\"; and \"Are you now taking prescribed medicine?\").13\nThe NHANES III response rate for completion of the interview\nyears were identified as hypertensive on the basis of the aforemen-\ntioned criteria. Seventy were excluded because of missing prescrip-\ntion medication data. The final analytic sample was 4933. The\nyears were identified as hypertensive, and 39 were excluded because\nof missing prescription medication data. The final analytic sample\nA history of physician-diagnosed diabetes, stroke, congestive\nheart failure, and heart attack was assessed by questionnaire.\nDiabetes only presenting during pregnancy was defined as no\ndiabetes. Glomerular filtration rate was estimated with the use of the\nModification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation,14 subtract-\ning 0.23 mg/dL from the NHANES III serum creatinine levels to\nadjust for calibration differences between NHANES III and the\nMDRD study.15 Chronic kidney disease (CKD) was defined as either\nan estimated glomerular filtration rate 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2 or\n200 mg albumin per gram urinary creatinine.4 Hypertensives who\nhad none of the aforementioned 5 comorbidities were categorized as\nuncomplicated hypertensives.\nStatistical analyses were conducted with the use of SAS (SAS\nInstitute) and SUDAAN (RTI). Sample weights were used to account\nfor differential probabilities of selection and the complex sample\ndesign and to obtain estimates representative of the noninstitution-\nalized US population aged 18 years. Variance estimates were\ncomputed with the Taylor series linearization approximation ap-\nproach.16,17 An estimate with a relative SE 30% was considered\nstatistically unreliable and noted in the tables. Statistical hypotheses\nwere tested univariately at the 0.05 level with a t statistic. The\nBonferroni method was used to adjust for multiple comparisons\nwhen differences between age groups were tested (4 comparisons,\nTests for differences between the 2 study periods were performed at\nthe 0.05 level with 2-sample t tests for comparisons of weighted\ndata.\nBecause age structures may be different between surveys or\nbetween race/ethnicity groups, we examined the potential impact of\nage by the direct age-standardized method in which weights corre-\nused to estimate antihypertensive medication use prevalence during\nNHANES III. Results in which these adjusted weights were used led\nto only minor differences in point and variance estimates without\nchanging any comparisons in trends across surveys or race/ethnicity\ncomparisons within surveys. Thus, in this report we present unad-\njusted estimates. Additionally, we do not present race/ethnicity\nestimates that are age-adjusted to the standard US population\nbecause the age structures of the hypertensive populations for\nstandard US population (specifically, they are significantly older).\nBy age-standardizing the antihypertensive drug use estimates with\nthe standard US population, the true prevalence of antihypertensive\nmedication use would be significantly underestimated. Instead, we\nprovide unadjusted prevalence estimates that are stratified at multiple\nlevels to increase the precision of estimates in specific demographic\nsubgroups.\nResults\nTable 1 provides baseline characteristics of the sample\npopulations, weighted to be representative of the US hyper-\ntensive adult population.

Continued\nefforts are needed among hypertensive men of all race/ethnic\ngroups and specifically among the younger age groups.\nOn the basis of evidence from epidemiological studies and\nclinical trials, JNC VI and JNC VII recommended that\ndiuretics and -blockers be used as first-line antihypertensive\nagents for uncomplicated hypertension.4,7 Our study found\nthat although diuretics were the most frequently prescribed\ndrug class for management of hypertension during both\nsurveys, ACE inhibitor use increased markedly. This trend\nwas also observed among uncomplicated hypertensives. If we\nconsider ACE inhibitors and ARB as 1 class, that is, as agents\nthat block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, renin-\nangiotensin-aldosterone system medication use doubled over\nthis time period, making it the most frequently used drug\nor -blockers significantly decreased over the past decade.\nThe rising use of ACE inhibitors may be explained by their\nsubstantial benefits in congestive heart failure and diabetes as\nJNC VI recommends this drug class as the first-line treatment\nfor hypertensives with these conditions.7 However, it is\ndifficult to explain the increased use among uncomplicated\nhypertensives. The decreasing use of diuretics or -blockers\nmay be explained by physician misperceptions that diuretics\nare less effective and that -blockers are less well tolerated\nRecently, several large clinical trials demonstrated that\nmost patients with hypertension can achieve and sustain\nadequate blood pressure control only with the use of multiple\nantihypertensive drugs.24,25 Initiating drug therapy with a\ndiuretic, either alone or in combination with an agent from\nanother drug class, apparently provides the best outcomes for\nhypertension management, and these findings have been\nincorporated into the current JNC VII guidelines.4 Our study\nfound that the use of multiple antihypertensive drugs either in\na single combination pill or in 1 pill significantly increased\nand accounted for use by more than half of all antihyperten-\ncombinations were a diuretic plus an ACE inhibitor,\n-blocker, or CCB.

Hyper-\ntension is also commonly associated with diabetes and\nchronic renal failure generally. For management of hyperten-\nsives with these comorbidities, both JNC VI and JNC VII\nguidelines recommend ACE inhibitors as the preferred drug\nfor hypertension in the setting of CKD, diabetes, or conges-\ntive heart failure; ACE inhibitors or diuretics for recurrent\nstroke prevention; and -blockers for those with prior myo-\ncardial infarction.4,7 In accordance with these recommenda-\n2002, ACE inhibitor use significantly increased in patients\nwith CKD, diabetes, and congestive heart failure, and\n-blocker use significantly increased in patients with a\nhistory of heart attack. Similar prescribing patterns for those\nwith diabetes, congestive heart failure, or a history of heart\nattack were also reported by Mehta et al.26\nThe percentage of hypertensive adults using antihyperten-\nsive drugs reported in this study is different than the hyper-\ntension treatment estimates published by Glover et al27 using\nences in sample exclusion criteria, antihypertensive medica-\ntion use definitions, and analysis methods (age-adjusted\nversus unadjusted estimates). In the present study we used the\nprescription medication data that were collected as part of the\nhousehold questionnaire. These data allowed us to identify all\nantihypertensive medications used in the past month with\ntheir specific drug names rather than using the self-reported\nresponse to the following question: \"Because of your high\nblood pressure/hypertension, are you now taking prescribed\nmedicine?\" Using the specific drug data also allowed us to\nmore completely examine drug utilization patterns and illus-\ntrate how the JNC VI recommendations for antihypertensive\ntherapy were being applied to US hypertensives. Addition-\nally, we presented unadjusted and stratified subgroup esti-\nmates rather than age-adjusted ones to estimate the true\nprevalence of antihypertensive medication use among US\nhypertensives rather than simply examining relative differ-\nences in drug use across time periods.\nThe primary strength of this study is the use of the\nNHANES data with its nationally representative samples and\noversampling of key demographic subgroups such as older\npersons and ethnic subgroups. Additionally, blood pressure\nwas obtained by standardized examinations. Finally, prescrip-\ntion data were collected by trained interviewers, with the use\nof an in-person, household interview protocol, with verifica-\ntion of drugs by inspection of medication containers.\nHowever, several potential limitations of our study should\nbe noted. First, while the auscultatory method of blood\npressure measurement in NHANES is fully consistent with\nJNC VI standards, NHANES measurements are performed\nonly at a single time point. By contrast, the clinical applica-\ntion of the JNC VI classification of hypertension is based on\nthe average of 2 properly measured blood pressure readings\non 2 separate occasions. It is therefore possible that in our\nstudy, some subjects were misclassified with regard to\nhypertension status. This potential problem was minimized to\nsome extent by taking the average of 3 separate measure-\nments obtained under the same standardized conditions in\nboth surveys. Furthermore, NHANES is a cross-sectional\nstudy, and participants were asked to recall only medications\nused in the past month, thus identifying the set of hyperten-\nsives currently on drug therapy. Those who used an antihy-\npertensive drug at any time before the 1-month recall period\nare classified as a hypertensive but without current antihy-\npertensive medication use. The particular choice of a study\nrecall period will affect prevalence estimates. The NHANES\n1-month recall period is reasonable, and a short recall period\nincreases the validity of the data collected by minimizing\nrecall bias. The data collected also do not allow us to\ndetermine whether the drug reported was the first prescribed\nand used or whether other drugs were prescribed and used\nearlier. This limited our ability to address compliance with\nJNC VI recommendations regarding drug classes for initial\nhttp://circ.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\ntreatment of uncomplicated hypertension. In addition,\nNHANES did not include collection of drug dosage and\nstrength information, and therefore no such data were avail-\nable for analysis.\nWe conclude that among US adults with hypertension,\nantihypertensive medication use significantly increased over\nhypertension used an antihypertensive drug in the past month.\nAlthough significant increases have occurred for certain\nhypertensive groups, disparities by demographic factors con-\ntinue to exist. Continued efforts are needed to improve\nantihypertensive medication use, especially among younger\nhypertensives and racial and ethnic minorities in certain\nutilization patterns among those with diabetes, congestive\nheart failure, and heart attack were consistent with JNC VI\nrecommendations. These NHANES data reflect the most\nbroadly representative trends in antihypertensive medication\nuse patterns estimated to date.\nReferences\n1.
