The cause of this enhancement is yet to be fully understood. Here, we\nconducted psychophysical experiments to investigate the effects of different types of simulated\noscillation on vertical vection. Observers viewed horizontally oscillating and nonoscillating optic\nflow fields simulating downward self-motion through an aperture. The aperture was visually\nsimulated to be nearer to the observer and was stationary or oscillating in-phase or counter-\nphase to the direction of background horizontal oscillations of optic flow. Results showed that\nvection strength was modulated by the oscillation of the aperture relative to the background optic\nflow. Vertical vection strength increased as the relative oscillatory horizontal motion between the\nflow and the aperture increased. However, such increases in vection were only generated when\nthe added oscillations were orthogonal to the principal direction of the optic flow pattern, and not\nwhen they occurred in the same direction. The oscillation effects observed in this investigation\ncould not be explained by motion adaptation or different (motion parallax based) effects on depth\nperception. Instead, these results suggest that the oscillation advantage for vection depends on\nrelative visual motion.\n",

The projection of optic flow on the retina is capable of inducing the\nillusory experience of self-motion in completely stationary observers, known as vection\n(Brandt, Dichgans & Koenig, 1973; see also Palmisano, Allison, Schira, & Barry, 2015 for\nalternative definitions of this term). Researchers have used vection measurement as a\npowerful tool to examine the perceptual mechanisms responsible for the experience of\nphysical self-motion. Although self-motion perception is multisensory in nature, vection\ndemonstrates that visual information alone is sufficient to generate the experience of self-\nmotion without other nonvisual self-motion senses (see Riecke, 2010 and Palmisano et al.,\nEarly studies assumed that vection should be facilitated by minimizing any visual-\nvestibular sensory conflicts about the physical nature of self-motion (Brandt, Dichgans, &\nBu\nBrandt, 1973; Zacharias & Young, 1981). According to this view, visual simulations of\nconstant velocity self-motion should induce optimal vection because the vestibular system\nis specialized for detecting self-accelerations and cannot distinguish between constant\nlinear self-motion and remaining stationarity (Howard, 1986). Although vection appears to\nbe strengthened under many conditions where the expected visual-vestibular conflicts are\nthought to be reduced (e.g., Melcher & Henn, 1981; Young et al., 1973), Palmisano and\ncoworkers have repeatedly shown that vection is increased (not reduced) by adding simulated\nself-acceleration to constant velocity displays (see Palmisano, Allison, Kim, & Bonato, 2011\nfor a review). In the earliest of these studies, Palmisano, Gillam, and Blackburn (2000) found\nthat the vection in depth induced by radially expanding optic flow was strengthened by the\naddition of visually simulated horizontal or vertical viewpoint jitter (similar to the effects of\ncamera shake). This jitter advantage for vection has been confirmed under a variety of\ndifferent stimulus settings (see Palmisano et al., 2011 for a review of this research).\nThe jitter advantage for vection has been found to be robust to changes in the amplitude,\nfrequency, and direction of the jitter. Adding horizontal, vertical, or even diagonal simulated\nviewpoint jitter has very similar effects on the vection in depth induced by radial flow\n(e.g.,Palmisano, Allison, & Pekin, 2008; Palmisano et al., 2000). This jitter advantage for\nvection also does not appear to be due to cognitive factors, such as participant expectations\nor instructional demands (see Palmisano & Chan, 2004). Whereas the early research was\nconducted using visually simulated viewpoint jitter (random, broadband simulated head\nperturbations), later research showed that vection could be improved in a similar fashion\nby adding visually simulated viewpoint oscillation (periodic simulated head perturbations) to\nthe radial optic flow (i.e., the oscillation advantage; e.g., Nakamura, 2010; Palmisano et al.,\n2008). Over the years, these robust jitter and oscillation advantages for vection have\ngenerated interest because their study should improve understanding of the mechanisms\nunderlying visual-vestibular interactions during self-motion perception (e.g., Snowden, 2000).\nDespite their robustness, the perceptual mechanisms underlying these jitter or oscillation\nadvantages are still not fully understood. It is therefore necessary to examine the\nrelationship between jitter or oscillation and other factors which have been hypothesized\nto be important for visually mediated self-motion perception. Accordingly, Nakamura\n(2012) analyzed the role that stimulus size and eccentricity plays in the jitter advantage for\nvection. It is well known that the size and eccentricity of the visual stimulus are among the\nmost critical factors in determining vection (e.g., Brandt et al., 1973), and hence, the analysis\nof these effects in relation to the jitter advantage should also be important. The results of\nNakamura's (2012) psychophysical experiments indicated that jitter enhancement is maximal\nin conditions where the observer's central visual field is stimulated by the jittering motion.1 It\nwas originally believed that peripheral visual motion induces stronger vection (e.g., Brandt\net al., 1973; Delmore & Martin, 1986). However, more recent studies suggest that vection is\nindependent of the stimulus eccentricity (e.g., Nakamura, 2001; Nakamura & Shimojo, 1998;\nPost, 1988). It is also widely accepted that larger areas of visual motion stimulation induce\nstronger vection (e.g., Nakamura & Shimojo, 1998). However, Nakamura (2012) found that\nthe jitter advantage for vection has rather different dependencies in terms of stimulus size,\ncompared with standard nonjittering vection.\nRelative motion is one potential property of optic flow that appears to be important for\nthe onset and strength of vection. Vection is often stronger when a static visual reference is\npresented along with the moving pattern (which results in relative motion between them)\ncompared with conditions where the moving pattern is presented alone (i.e., no object relative\nSimilarly, it has been reported that the strength and direction of vection are determined as a\nfunction of the relative motion between the moving pattern and the static visual target\nThis study investigated the effects of relative motion on the oscillation advantage\nfor vection. We examined the following stimulus situation: a moving visual background\npattern viewed through a visually simulated nearby aperture. While the background pattern\nalways moved vertically (consistent with constant downwards vection), the aperture and the\nbackground pattern could also be set to oscillate independently of each other (thereby\nincreasing the amount of relative oscillation). If oscillating (and also jittering) vection shares\nthe same dependency on relative visual motion as standard nonoscillating vection, then the\noscillation advantage should be: (a) stronger in conditions where the visual stimulus contains\nstrong relative oscillation among its components and (b) weaker when there is less relative\nvisual oscillation. We conducted four related experiments to tease apart the contributions of\nrelative oscillatory motion in either the perpendicular direction (Experiment 1), or parallel\n(Experiment 2), to the principal (vertical) direction of simulated self-motion. We also\ninvestigated the potential roles of visual motion adaptation (Experiment 3) and perceived\ndepth (Experiment 4) on the vection effects observed in Experiments 1 and 2.\nExperiment 1\nExperiment 1 tested whether viewpoint oscillation advantages can be altered or modified by\nthe relative oscillation of a moving aperture. In addition to a centrally placed stationary\nfixation point, we introduced a visually-simulated viewing aperture, through which\nparticipants were able to observe a globally coherent optic flow pattern. The stimulus\npattern was a random-dot pattern which moved upward at a constant speed while also\noscillating horizontally in some conditions. The position of the viewing aperture could also\nbe oscillated horizontally either together with, or independently of, the pattern's oscillation.\nThis experimental setup enabled us to systematically manipulate the relative oscillation\nbetween the aperture and the stimulus pattern. If the relative oscillation plays a role in\nvisual self-motion perception, then we predict that the aperture's oscillation in front of the\noscillating random-dot pattern should modulate or alter the strength of the induced vection.2\nTwo recent studies have shown that vection can be enhanced by providing a fixation target\nthat oscillates independently of the vection inducer (e.g., Nakamura, 2013a; Palmisano, Kim,\n& Freeman, 2012). Even though the optic flow itself did not contain any acceleration, the\nobserver's pursuit eye movements in this situation appear to have added global oscillation to\nthe retinal flow, which enhanced vection in a similar fashion to adding an oscillating optic\nNakamura et al. 3\nflow component to the vection inducer. In both of these studies, the fixation target not only had\na role in terms of controlling eye movements but also served as a reference for relative motion\nagainst the flow pattern. In the present study, a visual component other than the fixation spot,\nnamely the simulated aperture, was set to oscillate in front of the visual flow pattern. As the\nfixation spot was always statically located at in the center of the screen, this allowed us to\ndetermine the effects of relative motion on vection independently of the observer's eye\nmovements (and their flow-on consequences in terms of the retinal image motion).\nMaterials and Method\nParticipants. Eighteen undergraduate volunteers (4 males and 14 females with ages ranging\nfrom 17 to 52 years old) at the University of Wollongong participated in the experiment. All\nparticipants had normal or corrected-to-normal visual acuity and reported no deficits in\neither their visual or vestibular perception. None of the participants had previous\nexperience participating in vection experiments and all were nai\u00a8ve as to the purpose of this\nexperiment. The University of Wollongong Ethics Committee approved the study in advance,\nand each subject provided written informed consent before participating in the study.\nStimulus and apparatus. The visual stimulus employed in the experiment was composed of a\nvisually simulated (near) aperture and (far) random-dot pattern. The random-dot pattern\nconsisted of randomly positioned blue dots (4.6 cd/cm2) which moved upward at a constant\nspeed of 30/s, and (in some conditions) also oscillated horizontally in a sinusoidal fashion\nwith an amplitude of 6 and a frequency of 1 Hz. The radii of the dots contained in the\npattern varied randomly across the display (ranging from 0.5 to 1.0 in visual angle).\nThe background of the random-dot pattern was black (0.5 cd/cm2). The aperture, through\nwhich the participants observed the motion of the random-dot pattern, was created by\nsuperimposing a peripheral annular area of uniform dark gray texture onto the display\n(2.6 cd/cm2). The result was that the random-dot pattern was only visible within a central\ncircular area of the display which had a radius of 30. Figure 1 shows a snapshot of the visual\nstimulus employed in this experiment. In some conditions, the horizontal position of the\naperture was oscillated around the center of the screen with an identical amplitude and\nfrequency as the random-dot pattern; however, the phase of the oscillation was also\nmanipulated. A 0.5 red fixation spot (luminance: 6.4 cd/m2) was presented at the center of\nthe screen. Participants were requested to always fixate their eyes on this spot throughout the\nexperimental trial. Eye-movement recordings of eight participants confirmed that the\npresence of this fixation spot was sufficient to exclude potential artefacts of unintended eye\nmovements during experimental trials (Figure 2). Demo movies of the visual stimuli\nemployed in the experiment are also provided as supplementary material. The random-dot\npattern was always perceived to be located behind the aperture--confirmed in the debriefing\nsessions (also confirmed in Experiment 4 where observers reported perceived depth of the\nvisual stimulus, instead of perceived self-motion).\nThese visual stimuli were generated and controlled by a personal computer equipped\nwith an OpenGL compatible graphics card and presented on a 2 \u00c2 2 m screen using a DLP\nAll experiments were conducted in a darkened experimental room; the visual stimulus display\nwas the sole light source in the room. The participants sat on a chair in front of the screen\nwith a viewing distance of 150 cm. They observed the stimulus with their eyes fixed to a\nphysical (real) viewing booth, so that they could not see the edges of the screen (although all\nof the visual display, including black background, was still visible through the booth),\nFigure 2. Samples of eye-movement data. Horizontal observer eye movements were recorded via infrared\nvideo oculography (Oculog; Kim, Schiemer, & Narushima, 2007) with a sampling rate of 60 Hz. (a) and (b)\nindicate samples of eye-movement records (gray line) in conditions where only the pattern or the aperture\nwas set to oscillate. (c) and (d) represent the in-phase and the counter-phase aperture oscillation conditions\nwhere both the pattern and aperture were oscillated. In each of these stimulus conditions, the observer was\nable to keep their eyes static (thanks to the fixation spot), despite of the presence of the oscillatory motions\nof the pattern and the aperture.\nFigure 1. Snapshot of the visual stimulus employed in the experiments.\nNakamura et al. 5\nand their heads were roughly held stationary because the viewing booth was fixed to an\nimmovable frame.\nThere were two independent variables in this experiment. The first was the pattern\noscillation. In the pattern oscillation condition, the upward moving random-dot pattern\nalso oscillated horizontally. In the no pattern oscillation condition, the random-dot\npattern only moved upward. The other independent variable was the aperture oscillation,\nand there were three different conditions. In the in-phase aperture oscillation condition, the\naperture was set to oscillate horizontally with the same amplitude, frequency and phase as the\nrandom-dot pattern, and thus, the aperture oscillation was completely synchronized with\nthat of the random-dot pattern. In the counter-phase aperture oscillation condition, the\nphase of the aperture's oscillation was shifted 180 with respect to the random-dot pattern.\nThus, in this condition, the random-dot pattern and the aperture were oscillated in opposite\ndirections. There was also a no aperture oscillation condition, in which the aperture never\nmoved and remained static in the central position.\nThere were six different stimulus conditions in total (2 [pattern oscillation, no pattern\noscillation] \u00c2 3 [in-phase, counter-phase, and no aperture oscillations]). It should be noted\nthat in the no pattern oscillation condition, the in-phase and counter-phase aperture\noscillations both resulted in identical visual stimulation. In these conditions, the random-dot\npattern moved upward without horizontal oscillation and the aperture oscillated horizontally\nin front of it. Both of these conditions generate identical patterns of retinal motion.\nProcedure. The participant's task was to report perceived self-motion (vection) by pressing\na mouse button. It was emphasized that he or she needed to hold the button down as\nlong as their vection experience continued and release it if the vection dropped out during\nthe trial. Directly after each 30-second stimulus observation, participants were also\nrequired to rate the strength of the vection experienced during that trial using method of\nmagnitude estimation (Stevens, 1957). Participants were first exposed to the standard\nstimulus, which was identical to displays used in conditions with no aperture and no\npattern oscillation. The vection experienced with this standard stimulus was assigned a\nstrength of ``50'' (the modulus), and participants were instructed to estimate the strength\nof vection in subsequent experimental trials based on this reference. For example, if\nparticipants perceived that the vection strength for a trial was 30% stronger than that\nexperienced for the standard condition, they evaluated it as ``65.'' In experimental trials\nwhere the participants did not experience any vection, estimates were assigned as ``0.''\nTo establish the modulus for these strength estimates and allow the participants to\nbecome familiar with the experimental procedure, a single observation of the standard\nstimulus was executed before the experimental trials. Each participant was then presented\nwith three repeats of the six different experimental conditions in a randomized order.\nThey could request to take a short rest and observe the standard stimulus whenever they\nwere required.\nVection onset latency was calculated based on the time it took from the start of the trial\nuntil the observer first pressed a mouse button. Because there were very few vection dropouts,\ntotal vection durations were highly correlated with vection onset latencies (Pearson's\ncoefficient of correlation was \u00c00.75 in the case of the current experiment). Accordingly, we\nonly analyzed vection onset latencies and vection strength ratings (not total vection\ndurations) in order to avoid redundancy. Prior to conducting these analyses, vection onset\nlatencies and vection strength ratings were averaged across observers. Then a two-way\nrepeated measurement analysis of variance (rANOVA) with a factorial design of 2 (pattern\noscillation) \u00c2 3 (aperture oscillation) was then applied for each of the vection indices.\nResults and Discussion\nFigure 3 shows averaged latency and estimated strength of vection measured in each\nexperimental condition. rANOVAs revealed a significant main effect of the pattern\nstrength was higher in the pattern oscillation conditions than in the no oscillation\ncondition. Thus, it can be concluded that vertical vection was stronger in the presence of\nhorizontal random-dot pattern oscillation than without it. This replicates the findings of\nprevious studies that presented optic flow without an aperture (e.g., Nakamura, 2010;\nPalmisano et al., 2008). rANOVAs also indicated a significant main effect of aperture\nthan in the no aperture oscillation conditions.\nA significant two-way interaction between pattern oscillation and aperture oscillation was\npZ2 \u00bc .14). Due to the significant interaction observed for latency, a further analysis of\nvariance was conducted in order to examine the simple main effects of aperture oscillation\nseparately for each pattern oscillation condition. Simple main effects were significant in the\nFigure 3. Average estimated strength (a) and latency (b) of vection measured under each stimulus condition\n(Experiment 1). Error bars indicate SEMs. The open bars indicate the no pattern oscillation conditions in\nwhich the random-dot pattern was set to move purely upward at a constant speed. The solid bars indicate\nthe pattern oscillation conditions in which the pattern moved upward with horizontal oscillation. The abscissa\nindicates the oscillations of the aperture. In the in-phase oscillation condition, the aperture oscillated with the\nsame phase as the random-dot pattern. In the counter-phase oscillation condition, the phase of the aperture's\noscillation was shifted 180 with respect to the random-dot pattern. In the no aperture oscillation condition,\nthe aperture remained static in the central position.\nNakamura et al. 7\nMultiple comparisons using Bonferroni correction ( \u00bc 0.05) were executed, and the main\nresults of these comparisons are discussed later.\nIn the no pattern oscillation condition, vection onset latency was significantly shorter for the\naperture oscillation conditions (in-phase and counter-phase) than for the no aperture oscillation\ncondition. This indicates that horizontal aperture oscillation was able to reduce vection onset\nlatencies even when the background random-dot pattern moved purely upward (i.e., when the\npattern had no horizontal oscillation of its own and only the aperture motion provided any visual\nacceleration). In the pattern oscillation condition, latency was significantly shorter in the counter-\nphase aperture oscillation than in the in-phase condition. Adding pattern oscillation in no\naperture oscillation and counter-phase aperture oscillation conditions also significantly reduced\nvection latencies (relative to no pattern oscillation conditions). However, adding pattern\noscillation provided no significant benefit when this pattern oscillation was in-phase with the\naperture oscillation.\nThe above findings all appear consistent with the hypothesis that relative motion is critical\nfor the oscillation advantage in vection. Relative oscillation in the counter-phase condition\nwas twice that of the no aperture oscillation condition; by contrast, no relative oscillation was\nvisible between the aperture and the pattern in the in-phase condition. Thus, the pattern\noscillation might have improved vection because it increased the level of relative oscillation\nbetween the aperture and pattern in conditions when the aperture was stationary or when the\naperture was moving in a counter-phase fashion. However, there was less benefit of adding\npattern oscillation when it was in-phase with the aperture oscillation, as the aperture and\npattern were seen to move together as one (i.e., there was less relative motion between these\ntwo visual features than during aperture oscillation alone; the only relative motion would\nhave been between these visual features and the static fixation point). When there was no\naperture oscillation, vection latency was shorter in the pattern oscillation condition than in\nthe no pattern oscillation condition. Relative oscillation between the aperture and the\nrandom-dot pattern only occurred in the former condition, not in the latter one. Thus, the\nresults in the no aperture condition were also consistent with our relative motion hypothesis.\nIt should be noted that the simple main effect of the aperture oscillation was only marginally\nsignificant when there was pattern oscillation, which could be attributed to residual pattern\nmotion relative to fixation. Although there was no relative oscillation between the aperture and\nthe random-dot pattern in the in-phase aperture oscillation condition, pattern oscillation may\nhave significantly increased vection (compared with the standard nonoscillating condition)\nbecause of the its motion relative to the static fixation spot (the possible effect of the fixation\nspot as a reference for relative motion will be discussed further in section General Discussion). It\nis possible that additional effects of the relative aperture oscillation might have been somewhat\nobscured due to the presence of this fixation spot increasing the strength of the baseline vection.\nThe results of Experiment 1 were discussed earlier in relation to the relative oscillation\nbetween the random-dot pattern and the aperture (where the aperture provided a spatial\nframe of reference for interpreting all of the available visual motion). However, it was also\npossible that the motion of the aperture might have independently affected the observer's\nperception of self-motion. To address this possibility, we conducted an additional experiment\nwith nine nai\u00a8ve observers who did not take part in Experiment 1. In this experiment, the\nrandom-dot pattern was always static and only the aperture was oscillated horizontally.\nStimulus dimensions and the procedure used to measure perceived self-motion were both\nidentical to those of the main experiment. Although vection was consistently induced by the\nstandard stimulus, none of the nine observers reported experiencing vection with this new\nstimulus. Thus, it can be concluded that the effects of aperture oscillation found in\nExperiment 1 were due to the relative oscillation between the random-dot pattern and the\naperture, not the aperture oscillation by itself. The presence of a static random-dot pattern\npresented behind the oscillating near aperture is known to strongly inhibit vection (as it was\nshown to do here). Research has shown that a moving foreground cannot induce self-motion\nperception in the presence of a static background (e.g., Nakamura & Shimojo, 1999).\nThe results of this experiment revealed that, even with the eyes held stationary, the relative\noscillation between the two visual stimuli had the potential to facilitate self-motion perception\n(at least in terms of the vection time course; the reason why similar effects could not be\nconfirmed for estimated strength will be discussed later in section General Discussion).\nExperiment 2\nIn this second experiment, the effects of relative oscillation on vection were investigated\nfurther using conditions where the stimulus pattern moved upward at a constant speed\nand oscillated vertically behind an aperture which could also be set to oscillate vertically.\nHence, the oscillation occurred in the same direction as the constant velocity pattern motion\n(unlike Experiment 1 where any oscillation always occurred in an orthogonal direction to the\nconstant velocity pattern motion). Previous studies suggest that jitter or oscillation\nadvantages for vection only arise when the additional acceleration is orthogonal to the\nmain (constant speed) motion of the visual inducer; these advantages either disappeared or\nwere substantially diminished when the added acceleration was parallel to the main motion\nMethods\nParticipants. Ten nai\u00a8ve undergraduate volunteers who did not participate in Experiment 1\nacted as observers in Experiment 2 (5 men and 5 women, aged 18\u00ad46 years old).\nStimuli. The stimuli and apparatus employed in Experiment 2 were almost identical to those in\nExperiment 1. The sole difference was the direction of the oscillation assigned to the random-\ndot pattern and the aperture. In Experiment 2, the random-dot pattern was set to move upward\nat a constant speed (30/s) while oscillating vertically (frequency: 1 Hz, amplitude: 6).\nThe aperture was also set to oscillate vertically in some conditions.\nProcedure. The procedures used to measure vection strength and latency in Experiment 2 were\nexactly the same as those used in Experiment 1. There were two independent variables as in\nExperiment 1: pattern oscillation and aperture type. Trials for each stimulus condition were\nrepeated 3 times in a randomized order, and thus, each participant executed 18 trials in total.\nThe modulus for vection strength estimation was set using the same visual stimulus used in\nExperiment 1 (no aperture or pattern oscillation). An estimate of 50 was assigned for vection\nstrength as strong as self-motion perception induced by the standard stimulus.\nResults and Discussion\nFigure 4 shows the averaged latency and estimated strength of vection for each of the\nstimulus conditions. rANOVA revealed that only the main effects for pattern oscillation\np \u00bc .014, pZ2 \u00bc .50). Vection was found to be weaker (as indicated by longer latencies and\nlower estimates) in the vertical pattern oscillation condition than in the no pattern oscillation\ncondition. Thus it appears that vertical vection can be impaired by adding vertical oscillation\nNakamura et al. 9\nto the constant vertical pattern motion. In previous research, adding jitter or oscillation\nalong the same axis as the main constant motion component did not significantly alter\nvection strength (there was no facilitation or suppression of vection--see Nakamura, 2010;\nPalmisano et al., 2008). However, in the current experiment, adding vertical pattern\noscillation significantly decreased the strength and increased the latency of vertical vection.\nThese effects might have been due to the fact that, in the experiments reported in this article,\nthe random-dot pattern (the primary inducer of vection) was always presented centrally and\nhad a circular area of limited size. As a result, the vection induced might have been somewhat\nweaker compared with previous studies with large or full field presentations. It is well known\nthat vection strength increases as a function of stimulus size (e.g., Nakamura & Shimojo,\n1998). Thus, the relatively weak vection observed for the control condition (constant visual\nmotion without the pattern oscillation) might have been responsible for vection decline when\nvertical pattern oscillation was added.\nThe main effects of the aperture oscillation were not significant for either vection measure\nThe interactions between pattern oscillation and aperture oscillation also did not reach\npZ2 \u00bc .18). These results suggest that vection was unaffected by aperture oscillation and\ncombined aperture-and-pattern oscillation when the aperture oscillation occurred parallel\nto the direction of perceived self-motion.\nExperiment 3\nIn Experiment 3, we measured durations of the motion aftereffects generated by each of the\nstimuli used previously in Experiment 1. The rationale for conducting this experiment was that a\nnumber of vection studies have argued that jitter and oscillation might alter vection by affecting\nthe observer's adaptation to the visual motion stimulation (e.g., Kim & Khuu, 2014; Palmisano\nwhich contains visual acceleration (i.e., jitter or oscillation) and transiently varies its local\nvelocity, should be difficult for a local motion detector to adapt to (compared with a simple\nmoving pattern that has a constant speed). Thus, if the visual oscillations assigned to either the\nrandom-dot pattern or the aperture altered vection in Experiment 1 by reducing adaptation\nFigure 4. Average estimates of vection strength (a) and latency (b) measured under each stimulus condition\n(Experiment 2). Error bars indicate SEMs.\nto the visual inducer, then evidence of this should be seen in terms of the durations of the motion\naftereffects observed directly after exposure to the optic flow.\nMethods\nParticipants. Eight observers participated in this experiment (4 men and 4 women, aged 18\u00ad46\nyears old). One of these was an author (S. N.). The other seven observers were nai\u00a8ve\nundergraduate volunteers who did not participate in either Experiments 1 or 2.\nStimuli. The stimuli and apparatus employed in Experiment 3 were identical to those in\nExperiment 1--with the following exceptions. The visual stimulus was set to move for 30\nseconds (adaptation phase), then all motion stopped and a static version of the visual\nstimulus was continuously presented on the screen (test phase).\nProcedure. Participants kept the mouse button pressed as long as they experienced the motion\naftereffect, and released it as soon as the aftereffect dissipated. The duration of the motion\naftereffect (i.e., the time between when the stimulus motion stopped and when the mouse\nbutton was finally released) was recorded as an index of the strength of adaptation to the\nprolonged exposure to the visual inducer's motion, just as in several previous studies (e.g.,\nvariables namely random-dot pattern oscillation and aperture oscillation.\nResults and Discussion\nFigure 5 shows the averaged durations of the motion aftereffect obtained for each\nstimulus condition. A two-way rANOVA was used to analyze this motion aftereffect\nduration data. The main effects of pattern oscillation and aperture oscillation were\nThus, the durations of the motion aftereffects generated by 30-second exposures to optic\nflow were not significantly altered by either pattern or aperture oscillation. Motion\naftereffect durations were on average approximately 2 seconds long across all of the\ndifferent conditions tested.\nThe main purpose of Experiment 3 was to determine whether differences in the degree of\nadaptation to the visual motion might account for the effects of stimulus oscillation on\nvection. Accordingly, we conducted a cross-experimental comparison of the vection\n(measured in Experiment 1) and the motion aftereffects (Experiment 3) produced by the\nvarious stimulus conditions. Aperture oscillation, or the relative oscillation between the\npattern and the aperture, was shown to significantly alter vection onset latency. However,\nit did not modulate the motion aftereffect. Some previous studies have argued that adding\nvisually simulated accelerations to the visual inducer might disrupt adaptation to optic flow,\nand that this reduced motion adaptation might be partially responsible for jitter or oscillation\nadvantages for vection (e.g., Kim & Khuu, 2014). On the other hand, other studies have also\nfailed to find significant correlations between vection strength and motion adaptation, similar\nto the current experiment (e.g., Palmisano et al., 2012). Thus, it appears that motion\nadaptation cannot fully explain vection increases caused by the addition of pattern and\naperture oscillation in Experiment 1. Some consideration is therefore required when\ninvoking the role of motion adaptation to account for vection.\nExperiment 4\nIn the psychophysical experiments reported in this article, we mainly discussed the effects of\nrelative oscillation between the random-dot pattern and the aperture on vection. Observers\nalways perceived that the aperture was located in front of the background random-dot\npattern, even though no binocular disparity information was provided about the simulated\ndepth separation (all of the components in the visual stimulus were presented coplanar on the\nscreen). However, it was possible that manipulations of the relative oscillation between\nthe aperture and the random-dot pattern altered the perceived depth represented by the\ndisplay (via motion parallax), which in turn might have affected vection (e.g., Andersen &\nBraunstein, 1985). Experiment 4 tested this explanation by comparing the perceptions of\ndisplay depth experienced for each stimulus used in Experiment 1.\nMethods\nIn this experiment, we measured the perceived depth separation between the aperture and the\nrandom-dot pattern (instead of the observer's perceived self-motion). We used visual stimulus\nconditions that were identical to those of Experiment 1. Nine undergraduate students (4 men\nand 5 women, aged 19\u00ad21 years old) participated in this experiment (they had not taken part\nin Experiments 1\u00ad3). In the experimental trials, they estimated the perceived depth separation\nbetween the aperture and the random-dot pattern and verbally reported it. The standard\nstimulus for these depth estimates was again the no aperture and no pattern oscillation\ncondition. The perceived separation in depth for this standard stimulus was assigned a\nvalue of ``50'' (the modulus for their subsequent magnitude estimates).\nResults and Discussion\nFigure 6 shows the mean estimated depth separations between the aperture and the random-\ndot pattern for each stimulus condition. rANOVA revealed that the main effect of aperture\nFigure 5. Average motion aftereffect durations measured under each stimulus condition (Experiment 3).\nError bars indicate SEMs.\nbetween aperture oscillation and pattern oscillation was significant (F(2, 16) \u00bc 10.76,\np \u00bc .001, pZ2 \u00bc .57). Multiple comparisons using Bonferroni correction (a \u00bc 0.05) indicated\nthat perceived depth separation was significantly reduced (by $ 25%) in the in-phase aperture\nand random-dot pattern oscillation condition (compared with other conditions). No other\ndifferences in the depth perception were found.\nIn Experiment 1, we revealed that the in-phase aperture-and-pattern oscillation increased\nvection onset latency, indicating that self-motion perception was weakened in that condition.\nIt is possible that the decline in vection observed for this condition might have been due to\ndecreased depth perception. However, even in this condition, all of the observers still\nperceived the aperture to be in front of the random-dot pattern. Previous studies have also\nshown that it is the depth order among visual components (in terms of foreground\u00ad\nbackground relationships), not a depth separation between them, that is critical for self-\nmotion perception (Nakamura, 2006b). Thus we would argue that it is unlikely variation\nin perceived depth accounted for the experience of vection in this case. It should also be noted\nthat in the counter-phase aperture-and-pattern oscillation condition, there was no perceived\ndepth enhancement, even though vection was facilitated in Experiment 1. Thus, at best,\nperceived depth can only partially account for the effect of relative oscillation on vection\n(decrement in the in-phase aperture oscillation condition).\nGeneral Discussion\nOur psychophysical experiments investigated the effects on vection of adding oscillation\n(directly and indirectly) to the visual inducer. A simulated nearby visual aperture was\nprovided which could be set to oscillate independently of the primary vection inducer, that\nis, the moving background random-dot pattern. Experiment 1 revealed that horizontal\naperture oscillation could alter the onset latency of vertical vection induced by the\nbackground flow--with the nature of this effect depending on the amount of relative\noscillation between the random-dot pattern and the aperture. When the random-dot\npattern only moved upward, horizontal aperture oscillation (in front of the pattern)\nreduced vection onsets--most likely due to the increased relative oscillation between these\ntwo visual components. When the pattern also oscillated, in-phase aperture oscillation\nFigure 6. Average estimates of the depth separation between the aperture and the random-dot\n(Experiment 4). Error bars indicate SEMs.\nappeared to weaken vection, whereas counter-phase aperture oscillation appeared to\nfacilitate it (presumably by doubling the amount of relative oscillation compared with the\nno aperture oscillation condition). Although Experiment 1 found that horizontal aperture\nand pattern oscillation can improve vertical vection, Experiment 2 found that vertical pattern\noscillation actually impaired vertical vection. However, unlike vertical pattern oscillation,\nvertical aperture oscillation did not appear to alter either the strength or the latency of\nvertical vection. Experiment 3 demonstrated that the effects of horizontal aperture and\npattern oscillation on vertical vection could not be explained by reduced motion\nadaptation, as motion aftereffect durations did not appear to vary significantly as a\nfunction of the different conditions. Finally, Experiment 4 demonstrated that modulations\nin perceived display depth (arising due to differences in motion parallax) could not account\nfor all of the effects of relative oscillation on vection.\nThe Effects of Visual Aperture on Self-Motion Perception\nIn the psychophysical experiments reported here, we introduced a simulated aperture into the\nvisual stimulus to manipulate relative motion against the visual inducer. This aperture limited\nthe visual stimulation to a central circular area with a radius of 30 in visual angle. It is\npossible that the inclusion of this aperture weakened vection--as vection tends to increase\nwith the area of visual motion stimulation (e.g., Nakamura & Shimojo, 1998). Consistent\nwith this notion, average vection latencies in the present experiments were somewhat longer\nthan might be expected in inducing conditions with a larger field-of-view. However, because\nthis aperture was clearly seen to be in the foreground, it also strengthened participants'\nperceptions that the moving random-dot pattern lay in the background (confirmed\nduring debriefing). Previous studies have shown that compelling vection only occurs when\nthe optic flow field is perceived to be in the background (e.g., Brandt et al., 1973; Nakamura\nhypothesized that vection is primarily induced by visual stimuli perceived to be in the\nbackground, and that visual factors which enhance this background perception boost self-\nmotion perception (object-background hypothesis; Seno, Ito, & Sunaga, 2009; c.f., Kim &\nTran, 2016). Thus, it is likely that the strengthening of the optic flow's perceived background\nstatus (by the inclusion of the nearby aperture) partially compensated for any effects on\nvection of having a visual motion inducer that was of a limited size.\nThe Effects of Relative Oscillation Between the Visual Pattern and the Aperture\nThe main purpose of this investigation was to examine the effect of relative oscillation between\nvisual components (the random-dot flow field and an aperture) on vection. Experiment 1\nrevealed that vection latency decreased when a horizontally oscillating aperture was\npositioned in front of the self-motion inducing flow pattern. In that experiment, vection\nstrength was best explained as a function of the relative motion between the random-dot\npattern and the aperture; vection latency decreased in the counter-phase aperture oscillation\ncondition (which should have doubled the speed of the relative motion compared with the no\naperture oscillation condition), and increased during in-phase aperture oscillation (which\nshould have diminished the relative motion between aperture and flow field). These results\nsuggest that the oscillation advantage in vection is determined not only by the visual oscillation\nof the inducer itself but also by the relative oscillation between foreground and background\nvisual elements (the aperture and the random-dot pattern, respectively, in this investigation).\nSeveral previous studies have revealed that vection is strongly affected by relative motion\nor motion contrast among visual components, which also influences other visual motion\nperceptions, namely Dunker illusion (e.g., Heckmann & Howard, 1991; Howard &\nHeckman, 1989; Howard & Howard, 1994). In debriefing sessions, our participants often\nreported that their perceptions of the horizontally oscillating random-dot patterns did\ndepend on the motion of the aperture; perceived oscillation of the pattern was\nstrengthened in the counter-phase aperture oscillation condition (where relative motion\nwas doubled), and weakened when there was no relative motion in the in-phase aperture\noscillation condition. We propose that the effect of aperture oscillation on vection in\nExperiment 1 can be explained by the strength of the perceived oscillatory motion\nmodulated by the relative motion between the aperture and flow field.\nIt is also noteworthy that the estimated strength of vection was not significantly affected by\naperture oscillation in the current study (only vection onset latency). This null finding might\nindicate that the effects of relative motion were moderately weak in the current experimental\nsetup. The relative motion in our displays always existed only in restricted narrow regions at\nthe edge of the simulated visual aperture (which was located 30 out from the center of the\nobserver's visual field). It is possible that such relative motion effects might be strengthened in\nfuture by introducing multiple small apertures covering the random-dot pattern, or using two\noverlapping random-dot patterns (similar to those used by Nakamura, 2013b; Nakamura &\nShimojo, 1999, 2000). This would allow us to obtain much stronger relative motion compared\nwith using only the one aperture in the present experiments. Through such investigation will\nwe learn more about the effects of accelerating visual motion (jitter or oscillation) on vection,\nand self-motion perception more generally.\nThe Possible Effects of Relative Motion Against the Fixation Spot\nIn the psychophysical experiments reported in this article, a static fixation spot was always\npresented on the center of the visual display. Thus, although we have concentrated on\nanalyzing the effect of the relative oscillation between the aperture and the random-dot\npattern, motions were actually relative to three different visual components, namely, the\nrandom-dot pattern, the aperture, and the fixation spot. In the condition with no pattern\nand no aperture oscillation, there was no relative oscillation with respect to any of these three\nvisual components. In the in-phase pattern and aperture oscillation, while there was no\nrelative oscillation between the pattern and the aperture, there was still relative oscillation\nof the pattern and aperture with respect to the static fixation spot. In Experiment 1, vection\nonset latency was significantly shorter in the ``in-phase aperture oscillation'' condition than in\nthe ``no pattern and no aperture oscillation'' condition (see Figure 3). We propose that the\nrelative oscillation between the pattern \u00fe aperture and the fixation spot decreased the onset of\nvection in the former condition (relative to the latter condition). In this situation, a single\nstatic visual object presented in the center of the visual field also appeared to serve as a useful\nreference for relative oscillation.\nPalmisano et al. (2012) and also Nakamura (2013a) have previously reported that vection\ncan be increased by making oscillatory eye movements (to follow a moving fixation target)\nwhen viewing a nonoscillating pattern of optic flow. These studies demonstrate that vection\ncan be enhanced by retinal oscillation alone (even when there is no oscillation of the optic\nflow field; see also Kim & Palmisano, 2010). The current investigation also shows that a\nstationary (as opposed to moving) fixation target can facilitate vection by acting as a frame of\nreference for relative motion. Thus, these previous vection advantages (found when visually\npursuing a moving fixation spot) may have been jointly generated by the retinal image\nacceleration (due to the eye movement) and the presence of a frame of reference for\nrelative motion (due to the presence of the fixation spot). Future experiments should\ntry to distinguish between the effects of retinal oscillation and relative motion on vection,\nby controlling or monitoring eye movement under various observational conditions either\nwith or without explicit fixation target. This should provide exciting avenues to explore more\nparametrically the potential role of eye movements on relative motion, and in turn, self-\nmotion perception.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or\npublication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or\npublication of this article: This research was funded in part by an Australian Research Council (ARC)\nFuture Fellowship awarded to J.

Consistent with this notion Palmisano and Kim (2009; Experiment 1B) also reported that viewpoint\njitter produced the greatest vection improvements when participants either looked or fixated\ncentrally (as opposed to peripherally) in the optic flow display.\n2. Here we refer to ``relative oscillation'' as the horizontal oscillatory relative motion between the\nrandom-dot pattern and the aperture (i.e., velocity was sinusoidally modulated). This is\ndifferentiated from general relative motion because all of the displays tested had relative motion\nbetween the aperture and the constant upward motion of the random-dot pattern (even in the\nstandard nonoscillating condition).\nReferences\nAndersen, G.
