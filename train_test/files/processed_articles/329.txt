This 2002 study compared the level of agreement between\nmeasures of the presence of neighborhood businesses drawn from 2 common sources of data used for research\non the built environment and health: listings of businesses from commercial databases and direct observations of\ncity blocks by raters. Kappa statistics were calculated for 6 types of businesses--drugstores, liquor stores, bars,\nconvenience stores, restaurants, and grocers--located on 1,663 city blocks in Chicago, Illinois. Logistic regres-\nsions estimated whether disagreement between measurement methods was systematically correlated with the\nsocioeconomic and demographic characteristics of neighborhoods. Levels of agreement between the 2 sources\nwere relatively high, with significant (P < 0.001) kappa statistics for each business type ranging from 0.32 to 0.70.\nMost business types were more likely to be reported by direct observations than in the commercial database\nlistings. Disagreement between the 2 sources was not significantly correlated with the socioeconomic and de-\nmographic characteristics of neighborhoods. Results suggest that researchers should have reasonable confidence\nusing whichever method (or combination of methods) is most cost-effective and theoretically appropriate for their\nresearch design.\nChicago; geographic information systems; reproducibility of results; residence characteristics; social environment\nAbbreviations: NAICS, North American Industry Classification System; SSO, systematic social observation.\nThe association between neighborhood context and\nhealth is well documented. For example, residents living\nin socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods have\nan increased risk of chronic health conditions such as obe-\nsity (1, 2), respiratory problems (3, 4), and coronary heart\ndisease (5, 6), independent of individual risks. Additionally,\nresidents in these neighborhoods have higher rates of smok-\ning (7), poor nutrition (8, 9), and physical inactivity (7, 10\u00ad\n12). However, to provide better guidance on how policy\ninterventions can address neighborhood health disparities,\nresearch must focus on more specific aspects of neighbor-\nhood environments that lead to increased health risks and\nunhealthy behaviors.\nUntil recently, researchers have relied mainly on census-\nbased measures to assess associations between neighbor-\nhood characteristics and health (13\u00ad15), but they have\nincreasingly turned to other methods to measure aspects\nof neighborhoods that are more theoretically linked to spe-\ncific health outcomes. Two common sources of data on such\nneighborhood mechanisms are 1) spatially referenced sec-\nondary sources of data collected for other purposes (e.g.,\nadministrative data or market research data) and 2) direct\nobservations of the physical and social environment made\nthrough systematic social observation (SSO) (16).\nSecondary data sources, such as market research data-\nbases and municipal registries, can be very useful for mea-\nsuring aspects of the environment related to the availability\nof food, exercise facilities, and health care (17\u00ad20). One\nadvantage to using secondary data sources is that they usu-\nally provide complete geographic coverage of the area under\nstudy (e.g., all the stores that sell food in a city or metro-\npolitan area), sometimes for a very limited cost. However,\nmany health-relevant aspects of neighborhoods are not mea-\nsured in secondary data sources--such as the level of dis-\norder, the condition of buildings and recreational areas, and\nthe type and price of food sold in local stores--so re-\nsearchers often turn to other sources of contextual data.\nDirect SSO of the neighborhood environment allows re-\nsearchers to measure constructs not commonly found in\nsecondary data sources by using a field instrument tailored\nto their needs (21\u00ad23). This method is usually more costly\nbecause it requires training raters and paying for their time,\nbut it can be performed by survey interviewers who are\nalready in the field, at a relatively low marginal cost. An\nimportant limitation to using SSO is that geographic cover-\nage is typically more limited than it is with secondary data\nbecause researchers must pay for rater training and trans-\nportation to the sites being observed.\nBoth of these options represent promising alternatives to\ncensus data, but there are important unanswered questions\nconcerning the ``ecometric'' properties of neighborhood-\nlevel measures constructed from such data sources, includ-\ning issues of reliability, validity, and whether measures\ndrawn from either source are more or less reliable or valid\nthere is no ``gold standard'' for measuring neighborhood\ncharacteristics against which to compare measures from\nsecondary data or SSO, we can begin to address these ques-\ntions by assessing the level of agreement between equivalent\nmeasures derived from each method.\nAnother measurement concern that can be addressed em-\npirically is whether the level of agreement between the 2\nsources varies systematically across neighborhoods (26).\nFor example, research has shown that people living in dis-\nadvantaged areas with few grocery stores are at higher risk\nof obesity (27, 28). If, however, a study relies on secondary\ndata that fail to capture smaller businesses such as ``mom-\nand-pop stores,'' and disadvantaged neighborhoods are\nmore likely to have these smaller businesses (28, 29), then\nthe observed relation between lack of grocers and obesity\nmay be an artifact of undercounting small stores in areas\nwhere obesity rates are highest. Systematic measurement\nerror could also result from the potential failure of market\nresearch databases to count businesses in the ``informal\neconomy'' or to include businesses that have recently\nclosed, both of which could be more common in poorer\nneighborhoods. Likewise, SSO raters may make errors\ntranslating signs from other languages or not identifying\nmultiple types of businesses at a single location.\nIn this study, we used 2 different data sources on the\npresence of stores that sell food or beverages in Chicago,\nIllinois, neighborhoods: a major market research database\nand an SSO covering the same time period. In this paper, we\nfirst assess the level of agreement between these 2 data\nsources at the block level, focusing on stores that sell food\nor beverages because proximity to these establishments has\nbeen suggested as one mechanism linking the residential\n30, 31). We also assess whether the level of disagreement\nregarding the presence of food stores between the 2 data\nsources is systematically related to the sociodemographic\ncomposition of neighborhoods. To the extent that the dis-\nagreement between the 2 sources is not correlated with key\necologic characteristics (e.g., those conventionally used in\nneighborhood-effects research), researchers can be more\nconfident in using either method to explore the mechanisms\nthat could help explain why neighborhoods matter for\nhealth.\nSSO data\nOur observational data came from an SSO conducted as\npart of the Chicago Community Adult Health Study, a mul-\ntistage area probability sample of 3,105 adults living in the\ncity of Chicago (32). Each block on which one or more\nsampled residents lived was rated by trained observers.\nRaters were asked to walk around the perimeter of each\nblock twice--once on the interior perimeter, including the\nblock face on which the sampled resident lived, and once on\nthe exterior perimeter, including the block face across the\nstreet from where the sampled resident lived--and to record\ntheir observations on a rating form. The rating form asked\nthe raters to indicate only whether a given business type was\npresent; raters were not asked to count the number of busi-\nnesses, houses, or street features that they observed.\nObservations were made between May 2001 and March\npled to be representative of all blocks in the city that contain\nresidential housing (32). Each block is located in one of 343\nneighborhood clusters, defined in previous studies and con-\nsisting of one or more geographically contiguous census\ntracts that follow major ecologic boundaries with relatively\nhomogenous populations and comprise the entire area of the\ncity of Chicago (33). Two observers rated 80 of the blocks to\ndetermine the interrater reliability for each item in the in-\nstrument; kappa statistics for interrater reliability of items\nmeasuring the presence of food and beverage stores ranged\nevaluated whether any of the following types of business\nestablishments were present on the block: drugstores, con-\nvenience stores, liquor stores, bars, fast-food restaurants,\nother restaurants, greengrocers/delicatessens, and grocery\nstores/supermarkets. The definitions that raters used to code\nthese establishments are presented in Table 1, along with\ninterrater kappa statistics based on the 80 double-rated\nblocks for each business type. If a business could be cate-\ngorized into multiple business categories (e.g., a bar and\na restaurant), raters were instructed to code both business\ntypes as present on the block.\nProprietary commercial establishment data\nThe proprietary data were purchased from InfoUSA\n(Omaha, Nebraska), a commercial vendor that tracks busi-\nnesses and provides business listings based on the North\nAmerican Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes,\na standard created and used by government agencies to cat-\negorize businesses. This proprietary data set lists 23,868\nbusinesses that had 1) addresses in the city of Chicago dur-\nSSOs were collected within 3 months on either side of that\nmonth; and 2) NAICS codes that identified them as drug-\nstores, convenience stores, liquor stores, bars, fast-food res-\ntaurants, other restaurants, greengrocers/delicatessens, or\ngrocery stores/supermarkets. Definitions of these business\ncategories and their corresponding NAICS codes are listed\nin Table 1, along with the number of such establishments in\nthe proprietary data across all sampled blocks. Each estab-\nlishment could identify itself with up to 4 NAICS codes. We\nclassified a business as belonging to a specific food/bever-\nage store category if at least one of the reported NAICS\ncodes was in the food/beverage store category (establish-\nments with multiple NAICS codes were classified into mul-\ntiple business categories). Although the data proprietor\nprovides a new list of businesses each month, it does not\nprovide documentation regarding the frequency with which\nindividual listings are verified; the lack of such information\nis a major disadvantage in using these data.\nThe data set included addresses and geographic coordi-\nnates for each business. After inspecting the data, we found\nsmall discrepancies between the coordinates provided by\nthe data proprietor and the coordinates obtained by geo-\ncoding the addresses ourselves. Since the proprietor did not\ndocument the specific procedures used to obtain geo-\ngraphic coordinates for businesses, we geocoded the ad-\ndresses of all of the 23,868 businesses using US Census\nBureau TIGER/Line files (http://www.census.gov/geo\n/www/tiger/) and ArcGIS version 9.2 software (ESRI, Red-\nlands, California). We were unable to obtain geocoded co-\nordinates for 1,019 businesses. We conducted the analysis\n1) without these observations (which we report in the ta-\nbles) and 2) with the proprietor-provided coordinates for\nthese observations, and we found no significant variation in\nour results.\nCreating comparability between data sets\nWe used a multistep process to construct comparable\nmeasures across the 2 data sources. The first step created\ncomparable business categories by matching the instruc-\ntions used by the SSO raters to the NAICS codes used to\nclassify businesses in the proprietary data. This step re-\nquired collapsing some categories in both data sources. Ta-\nble 1 provides the business categories used in the analysis\nand how they are defined in each data source.\nSince the availability of fast-food restaurants has been\nconsidered particularly important to the health of residents\nfast-food restaurants and ``other eating places.'' The ``fast-\nfood'' category in the SSO data was compared with the\n``limited-service restaurants'' category (NAICS code\ndetail), whereas the ``other eating places'' category from the\nSSO (which captured any non-fast-food restaurant in the\nSSO) was compared with a roughly analogous category in\nthe proprietary data that we created by counting the pres-\nence of any of the following: a ``full-service restaurant''\nThe next step involved creating geographically compara-\nble units of analysis. The SSO was conducted on only 1,663\nof the approximately 24,000 blocks in Chicago, and we had\nto ensure that we were using the same blocks with the pro-\nprietary data. We used geographic information systems soft-\nware to create polygons that represented the blocks\nobserved by SSO raters and matched a business from the\nproprietary data to a polygon if the geographic coordinates\nwere inside the polygon. A business category was coded as\nbeing present on the block if at least one business in that\ncategory was inside the block boundary; otherwise, it was\ncoded as not present. In the final step, the block-level mea-\nsures from the proprietary database were merged with the\nSSO database, resulting in a combined database that con-\ntained measures from both data sources of whether each\nbusiness category was present on each block.\nAnalytic strategy\nTo measure the correspondence between the 2 data sour-\nces, kappa statistics were calculated for the 8 business types.\nThe kappa statistic is a measure of intersource reliability,\ndefined as the ratio of the observed agreement to the ex-\npected agreement (i.e., the level of agreement that could be\nexpected by chance, based on the marginal frequencies in\nboth data sources) (35). We then assessed whether disagree-\nment between the 2 data sources is systematically associated\nwith the sociodemographic characteristics of neighborhoods\nby fitting logistic regression models that estimate the log-\nodds of finding disagreement (a dichotomous variable)\nabout the presence of a given business type on a block.\nIndependent variables measuring the sociodemographic\ncharacteristics of neighborhoods were constructed from\nSummary File 3 of the 2000 US Census (http://factfinder.\ncensus.gov/). We constructed a disadvantage scale (a \u00bc\n0.94) by taking the mean of the z-score values of the fol-\nlowing variables: percentage of households with annual in-\ncomes of less than $15,000, percentage of households with\nannual incomes of $50,000 or less, percentage of families\nliving in poverty, percentage of households receiving public\nassistance, percentage unemployed, percentage of female-\nheaded households, percentage of never-married persons,\nand percentage of owner-occupied households (reverse\ncoded). The variables used to construct this scale were se-\nlected based on a factor analysis of census tract data con-\nducted for previous research (32).\nTwo variables were included to capture the influence of\nracial/ethnic composition on disagreement: the neighbor-\nhood percentage non-Hispanic white and a Hispanic/foreign\nborn scale, which is the mean of the z-score values of the\npercentage of Hispanics and percentage foreign born (a \u00bc\n0.86). We also included the percentage of residents who\nlived in the same house for 5 years and the logged popula-\ntion per square kilometer to measure residential stability\nand population density, respectively.\nTo control for the geographic location of blocks in the city\nof Chicago, which is likely to influence business patterns, we\nincluded a measure of distance from the Loop--Chicago's\ncentral business district--operationalized as a block's dis-\ntance in kilometers from the Sears Tower.

A ``wine bar'' would be included under this\nheading although they often offer a variety of meals. To qualify as a bar, it\nmust be possible to obtain alcohol without also purchasing food.\n722410: Bars, taverns, nightclubs, or drinking places primarily engaged in\npreparing and serving alcoholic beverages for immediate consumption.\nThese establishments may also provide limited food services.\nConvenience stores 7-Eleven/convenience store (interrater j \u00bc 0.61): includes small\nsupermarkets open 18 to 24 hours selling a wide range of products\nincluding newspapers, food, small household items, toys, and stationery.\nSuch stores may be part of a chain (e.g., White Hen Pantry, 7-Eleven) or\nprivately owned. They may also be part of a gasoline service station if\nthey sell a range of goods beyond just cigarettes, candy, and soft drinks.\n445120: Convenience stores or food marts (except those with fuel pumps)\nprimarily engaged in retailing a limited line of goods that generally\nincludes milk, bread, soda, and snacks.\n447110: Gasoline stations in combination with convenience store or food\nmarts.\nConvenience stores on sampled blocks: 137\nRestaurants Fast-food/take-out place (interrater j \u00bc 0.64): includes chains (e.g.,\nMcDonalds, Burger King, Wendy's, Taco Bell) and restaurants offering\nonly a limited range of ``fast-food'' items, such as pizza houses. This\ncategory includes sandwich bars, small coffee shops with limited\nseating, establishments that only have a take-out trade (e.g., some\nChinese food, kebab houses), and any other eating place where no more\nthan 2 or 3 people could linger to eat.\n722211: Establishments primarily engaged in providing food services\n(except snack and nonalcoholic beverage bars) where patrons generally\norder or select items and pay before eating. Food and drink may be\nconsumed on premises, taken out, or delivered to customers' location.\nSome establishments in this industry may provide these food services in\ncombination with selling alcoholic beverages. providing take-out\nservices, or presenting live nontheatrical entertainment.\nRestaurants (fast-food) on sampled blocks: 941\nOther eating place/restaurant (interrater j \u00bc 0.52): includes restaurants\nthat have both take-out and eat-in services and restaurants where the\nspace available for eating on the premises is greater than the space for\ncustomers to line up and wait for ``take-out'' items, except for fast-food\nchains (e.g., McDonalds), which are in the previous category.\n722110: Establishments primarily engaged in providing food services to\npatrons who order and are served while seated (i.e., waiter/waitress\nservice) and pay after eating. These establishments may provide this\ntype of food service to patrons in combination with selling alcoholic\nbeverages.\nTo be considered an eating establishment, food should be the principal\noffering, or nonalcoholic beverages (e.g., coffee shops that provide\nseating and tables and also some food such as doughnuts, coffee cake,\npastries, etc.)\npreparing and/or serving a specialty snack, such as ice cream, frozen\nyogurt, cookies, or popcorn or 2) serving nonalcoholic beverages, such\nas coffee, juices, or sodas for consumption on or near the premises.\nThese establishments may carry and sell a combination of snack,\nnonalcoholic beverage, and other related products (e.g., coffee beans,\nmugs, coffee makers) but generally promote and sell a unique snack or\nnonalcoholic beverage.\n311811: Bakeries: Primarily engaged in retailing bread and other bakery\nproducts not for immediate consumption.\nRestaurants (``other eating place'') on sampled blocks: 200\nRestaurants (any) on sampled blocks: 1,052c\ndifferences in when blocks were rated in the SSO, we con-\ntrolled for the difference (in months) between the date the\nblock was observed and November 2002, the month for\nwhich the proprietary data were obtained. All analyses were\nconducted by using Stata version 9.2 software (Stata Corpo-\nration, College Station, Texas).\nRESULTS\nThe results of the correspondence analysis are reported in\nTable 2. The rate of agreement between the SSO and pro-\nprietary data was quite high, ranging from 82% (for fast-\nfood restaurants and supermarkets or grocers) to 96% (for\ndrugstores). Restaurants had the highest intersource reliabil-\nity (j \u00bc 0.70), convenience and liquor stores and ``other''\n(non-fast-food) eating places had the lowest (j \u00bc 0.32\u00ad\n0.38), and the other categories (drugstores, bars, fast-food\nrestaurants, and grocery stores) had levels of agreement\nand liquor stores and ``other'' (non-fast-food) eating places\nbut well below restaurants.\nTo better understand the nature of disagreement between\nthe 2 data sources, we cross-tabulated measurements from\neach source and report, in Table 2, the frequency of blocks\non which 1) both data sets agreed that the business type is\npresent, 2) both agreed that it is not present, 3) only the SSO\ndata source indicated that the business type is present, and 4)\nonly the proprietary data source indicated that the business\ntype is present. The results show that, where disagreement\noccurred, it was more often the case that a business type was\nrecorded in the SSO but not the proprietary data, especially\nin the case of liquor and convenience stores. Exceptions\nincluded drugstores, grocery stores, and especially fast-food\nrestaurants (where the NAICS definition is more inclusive),\nwhich were reported slightly to moderately more frequently\nin the proprietary data than in the SSO.\nOdds ratios estimated from the logistic regressions of\nblock disagreement are reported in Table 3. The major find-\ning was the lack of a consistent relation between the socio-\ndemographic characteristics of neighborhoods and the odds\nof the 2 data sources disagreeing. Of the 40 socioeconomic\nand demographic coefficients that we estimated, only 9 were\nstatistically significant. Three of the outcomes (all restau-\nrants, fast-food restaurants, and supermarkets) had no sig-\nnificant sociodemographic predictors, and another 3\noutcomes (drugstores, liquor stores, and bars) had only\none significant sociodemographic predictor. The sociode-\nmographic variables associated with disagreement were 1)\nproportion white (associated with more disagreement on\nnon-fast-food restaurants), 2) the Hispanic/foreign-born\nscale (associated with more disagreement on bars and\nnon-fast-food restaurants), 3) the disadvantage scale (asso-\nciated with more disagreement on liquor stores), 4) the res-\nidential stability scale (associated with less disagreement on\ndrugstores, convenience stores, and non-fast-food restau-\nrants), and 5) population density (associated with more dis-\nagreement on convenience stores and non-fast-food\nrestaurants).\nThe nature and direction of the observed sociodemo-\ngraphic effects for each type of establishment seem\nSupermarkets or grocers Supermarket/grocery store (interrater j \u00bc 0.36): includes stores that sell\npredominantly foodstuffs and small household items. The size of\nsupermarkets may vary. Include large supermarkets (e.g., Jewel,\nDominics) and also smaller food supermarkets. Some of these will be\nopen 24 hours a day but they are distinguished from ``convenience\nstores'' by the fact that they provide a wider range of items.\n445110: Establishments generally known as supermarkets and grocery\nstores primarily engaged in retailing a general line of food, such as\ncanned and frozen foods; fresh fruits and vegetables; and fresh and\nprepared meats, fish, and poultry. Included in this industry are\ndelicatessen-type establishments.\nGreengrocer/delicatessen (interrater j \u00bc 0.52): includes ``mom-and-pop''\nsmall neighborhood groceries and small specialized food stores, such as\nthose selling food from one part of the world or one ethnic background, or\nhealth foods/vegetarian food shops. The store should be predominantly\nfor the purchase of foods that need to be prepared off the premises, NOT\nthose offering mainly ready prepared food to ``carry out'' (such as\nsandwich bars).\n445210: Establishments primarily engaged in retailing fresh, frozen, or\ncured meats and poultry. Delicatessen-type establishments primarily\nengaged in retailing fresh meat are included in this industry.\n445220: Establishments primarily engaged in retailing fresh, frozen, or\ncured fish and seafood products.\n445230: Establishments primarily engaged in retailing fresh fruits and\nvegetables.\nSupermarkets or grocers on sampled blocks: 437\nAbbreviations: NAICS, North American Industry Classification System; SSO, systematic social observation.\na The variable descriptions are the instructions given to the SSO observers.\nb The definitions for the NAICS codes are published by the US Bureau of the Census (http://www.census.gov/epcd/ec97/industry/).\nc The total from any restaurant is less than the sum of fast-food restaurants and ``other eating places'' because they are not mutually exclusive categories.\nMeasurement of the Local Food Environment 613\nreasonable, if only marginally more than might occur by\nchance. There are no sociodemographic predictors for\nlarge and inclusive categories (all restaurants, all super-\nmarkets/grocery stores) or quite identifiable ones (fast-\nfood). Findings drawing on the results shown in Tables 2\nand 3 showed the following: 1) drugstores are identified\nless often via SSOs, with more disagreement in areas of\nhigh residential stability (where NAICS-identified drug-\nstores may be ``hidden'' in larger stores); 2) liquor stores\nare identified less often in the proprietary data, with more\ndisagreement in disadvantaged areas (where the proprie-\ntary data response rates may be lower for all stores or\nespecially this type, which may be subject to heightened\nlaw enforcement observation if reported); 3) bars are more\nreported via SSOs and with more disagreement in His-\npanic areas, where there may again be underreporting\nvia NAICS; 4) convenience stores are more often reported\nvia SSO, with more disagreement in dense areas and less\ndisagreement in residentially stable areas (where they may\nbe underreported in the proprietary data or more easily\nvisible via SSO); and 5) other eating places are more often\nreported via SSO, with more disagreement in white or\nHispanic areas and denser areas and less disagreement in\nstable areas (where the somewhat less inclusive NAICS\ncategories may generally miss some types of eating estab-\nlishments unless the area is very stable).\nDistance to the Loop was also associated with less dis-\nagreement for 5 outcomes: drugstores, liquor stores, bars,\nfast-food restaurants, and supermarkets, likely reflecting\nlower commercial density further away from downtown\nChicago (and conversely more purely residential blocks)\nand thus fewer opportunities for disagreement to occur (be-\ncause there are fewer businesses). We tested this hypothesis\nby repeating the models reported in Table 3 using subsam-\nples that contained only those blocks with commercial ac-\ntivity. We did not have official data on land-use patterns to\nmeasure commercial activity, so we identified commercial\nblocks in 2 ways. First, we constructed a subsample of 1,037\nblocks with commercial land use by eliminating blocks\nwhere the SSO rater did not observe any commercial land\nuse (regardless of whether the proprietary data recorded\na food-related business there). We also constructed a second\nsubsample of 656 blocks where any of the 6 business types\nwere reported present on the block in the proprietary data,\neven if the SSO raters failed to observe a food-related busi-\nness there. In both subsamples, we found nonsignificant\nassociations between distance to the Loop and disagreement\nfor all businesses except bars, but the associations between\nthe sociodemographic characteristics and the outcomes\nwere similar to those shown in Table 3.\nDISCUSSION\nThe results of this analysis are promising for researchers\ninvestigating the role of the residential environment on in-\ndividual outcomes. Although neither of these 2 data sources\ncan be taken as a ``gold standard,'' the moderate to high\nlevels of agreement between the 2 sources suggest that the\npresence of commercial establishments in residential neigh-\nborhoods is comparably measured across the 2 methods of\ndata collection. The intersource reliability between the SSO\nand proprietary measures is comparable to interrater reli-\nabilities obtained for SSO observations (21, 36) and is\nhigher than the rates of agreement between respondent re-\nports and proprietary databases reported in a prior study\nAcross the 6 business types we investigated, we did not\nfind a consistent pattern of association between sociodemo-\ngraphic characteristics and disagreement that would lead us\nto conclude that one data source consistently differs from\nthe other in certain types of neighborhoods. The only con-\nsistent predictor of disagreement was distance to the Loop:\ndisagreement was less likely in blocks further away from the\ncenter of the city. Supplementary analysis revealed that this\nassociation disappeared when the sample of blocks was lim-\nited to blocks with commercial establishments. This finding\nbolsters our interpretation that distance to the Loop is\na proxy for commercial density, which creates more oppor-\ntunity for disagreement simply because there are more busi-\nnesses to rate or list.\nMost types of businesses were more likely to be reported\non a block by SSO observers than by proprietary business\nlistings. We suspect that this is partly the result of the\nTable 2. Kappa Statistics and Tabulations of Agreement on City Blocks Between Data Collection Methods, Chicago, Illinois, 2002a\nBusiness Type\nObserved\nAgreement, %\nExpected\nAgreement, %\nKappa\nAgree:\nNot Present, %\nAgree:\nPresent, %\nDisagree:\nPresent in SSO, %\nDisagree:\nPresent in Prop., %\nAbbreviations: Prop., proprietary data source; SSO, systematic social observation.\ndefinitions used to classify the different businesses since the\nSSO rater instructions generally had more lenient definitions\nthan the NAICS codes. It is also possible that SSO reports\nwere more accurate than the proprietary business data list-\nings because raters were able to obtain additional informa-\ntion about businesses, such as the merchandise or services\nthat they sell or produce, by visiting them. Businesses clas-\nsify themselves in the proprietary data by using NAICS\ncategories, but there are no assurances that businesses will\nlist all of the different categories they could be part of (and\nthey can list as many as 4 only), and we know nothing about\nresponse rates.\nLimitations\nAlthough our results suggest that these data sources pro-\nvide reliable estimates of the residential environment, sev-\neral limitations should be noted. First, the SSO instrument\nwas not designed to count the number of business establish-\nments. Although we were able to compare how well these\ndata sources capture the presence of businesses, not having\ndata on the number of businesses meant that we could not\ncompare measures of business density in neighborhoods.\nFuture studies should compare both presence and density.\nSecond, as we mentioned above, the definitions of the 6\nbusiness types differed slightly across the 2 data sources.\nThis difference likely inflated the amount of disagreement\non each block, resulting in conservative assessments of in-\ntersource reliability. It also suggests that future studies using\nSSO methodology to measure business establishments\nshould use standard definitions, such as NAICS codes, to\nallow for maximum comparability between studies.\nFinally, this study examined agreement across only the 2\ndata sources for 6 business types and examined these types\nin only a single city at a single point in time. Although\nChicago has a wide diversity of neighborhoods, these anal-\nyses should be extended to other cities and types of residen-\ntial environments including suburban and rural\ncommunities. Furthermore, we considered only those blocks\nwith some residential housing units and hence cannot gen-\neralize our results to blocks with no residential land use.\nThus, although this study provides evidence that the 2 data\nsources yield consistent measures of the residential environ-\nment, it represents only a first step in assessing the reliability\nbetween these data sources, and further investigations that\ninclude more items and more geographic locations are war-\nranted. This analysis presents a straightforward strategy that\ncan be used to assess the reliability of other measurements\nacross different geographic contexts.\nConclusions\nThe levels of reliability found between these 2 methods of\ndata collection suggest that researchers can use measures of\nthe residential environment derived from either data source\nwith roughly equal confidence. For studies aiming to char-\nacterize the neighborhood food environment, the data sour-\nces provide fairly comparable measures of the types of\nestablishments present in the neighborhood; therefore, se-\nlection of one data source over the other should depend on\nTable 3.

For instance, the propri-\netary data provide complete geographic coverage, whereas\nthe SSO relies on a sample of city blocks; thus, researchers\ninterested in the total availability or density of food or retail\nestablishments would probably find the proprietary data\nmore cost-effective. On the other hand, the SSO provides\nresearchers with a tool to collect more nuanced measures of\nthe residential environment such as physical and social dis-\norder and can probably make more nuanced distinctions\namong establishments because of the opportunity for direct\nobservation. Where nuanced distinctions are necessary,\nthese results suggest that SSO might be a more appropriate\nmethod. Therefore, both of these methods of data collection\nshould be included in the toolkit researchers use to investi-\ngate the role of the residential environment on health, and\nthey can be utilized as alternatives or complements, depend-\ning on the research objectives and financial resources of\ninvestigators.\n"
