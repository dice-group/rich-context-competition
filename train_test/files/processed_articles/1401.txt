Thus, researchers currently are focused on the variety of\nspecific health deficits and developmental trajectories associ-\nated with obesity that are less understood beyond prevalence\nstatistics (9).\nAn estimated 1.6 million adolescents reach obese status\nprior to age 18 and three million adolescents either become\nor remain obese as they transition to young adulthood; <1%\nof that number move out of the obese BMI range (10,11). The\npurpose of the current research is to examine the relation-\nship between obesity trajectories and physical health from a\ndevelopmental and cohort-specific standpoint. Specifically,\nit is unknown how obese and nonobese individuals differ in\nregard to physical health during the transition to young adult-\nhood. Cohorts of interest include individuals obese during\nadolescence only, those obese during young adulthood only,\nthose obese during both developmental periods (i.e., continu-\nously obese), and young adults who were never obese. For the\npurpose of this study, these different experiences of obesity are\nreferred to as obesity categories.

Merten1\nThis study examined weight status during adolescence and young adulthood, and young adult health condition\ndiagnosis. Data are from 10,439 African-American, Hispanic, and white men and women participating in the National\nLongitudinal Study of Adolescent Health during Waves 1 (adolescence: ages 12\u00ad19) and 3 (young adulthood: ages\n19\u00ad26). Categories were created differentiating individuals based on their weight status during adolescence and young\nadulthood: (i) obese during adolescence and young adulthood (i.e., continuously obese), (ii) obese during adolescence\nonly, (iii) obese during young adulthood only, and (iv) never obese. Multilevel random intercept regression models\nwere used to examine the impact of obesity category, sex, and race/ethnicity on young adult asthma, diabetes, high\ncholesterol, and high blood pressure. Continuous obesity increased the likelihood for young adult disease and health\nrisk conditions compared to individuals who were never obese. Obesity isolated to adolescence (Wave 1) increased\nthe likelihood for high cholesterol and high blood pressure, whereas obesity isolated to young adulthood (Wave 3)\nalso increased the likelihood for diabetes--all increases were relative to nonobese weight status during both periods.\nAssociations varied in direction and degree when sex and race/ethnicity were considered. Findings clarify some of the\nmixed understandings regarding the associations between age of onset and stability of obesity, and health outcomes\nwith important public health implications. Although results indicate obesity isolated to a single developmental period\ndoes have health repercussions, obesity experienced continuously during adolescence and young adulthood greatly\nintensified risk across all health conditions.\n1Department of Human Development and Family Science, Oklahoma State University, Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA.

Similar methods of chrono-\nlogically categorizing obesity status have been used in previous\nstudies examining relative influence of developmental weight\nThe link between obesity and physical health is complex and\ncan vary by sex, ethnicity, age, and biological or genetic \nfactors\n(13). African Americans are consistently over-represented in\nreports of obesity, cardiovascular disease, and related con-\nditions, particularly black women (14). Prevalence of poor\nhealth also varies between men and women, regardless of race.\nMen generally exhibit increased prevalence for the majority\nof heart-related conditions (14,15), whereas women are more\nlikely to develop asthma, particularly if they are or have ever\nbeen obese (16), and physical activity does not appear to lower\nthis risk (17). Therefore, investigators will stratify analyses\nby sex and race because, although excess weight and obesity-\n\nrelated risk of poor health are stable across demographics, the\nintensity of risk varies based on these factors (4,18,19).\nPrevious findings are mixed, and it is still unclear what\nrelative influence age of onset and stability of obesity has for\nfuture health outcomes (9,10,20). Identifying when obesity has\nthe strongest impact on adult physical health conditions and\ndisease is critical to the appropriate and effective design and\ndelivery of interventions aimed at improving public health. In\nthis study, researchers expect continuous obesity to increase\nthe likelihood of poor health in young adulthood more so\nthan obesity isolated to adolescence or young adulthood, or\nnever experienced during either developmental period. This\nhypothesis is based on the proposition by Jeffreys et al. (21)\nthat, although obesity at any age increases the risk for adult\ndisease, cumulative health risks develop from persistent obes-\nity across the lifespan.\nMethods and Procedures\nSurvey design\nThe data for this study were derived from the National Longitudinal\nStudy of Adolescent Health, a nationally representative study of adoles-\ncents. Both adolescents and parents were interviewed at home, where\nan array of information was obtained on health and lifestyle. This study\nuses in-home interview data from adolescents and parents, collected\ncomprised of data collected from a nationally representative sample of\nhigh school students; data collection was based on a complex cluster\nsampling frame. A sample of 134 middle and high schools was selected\nthrough stratified sampling. The total sample size was 20,745. To ensure\ndiversity, the sample was stratified by region, urbanicity, school type\n(public vs. private), racial composition, and size. Sample weights were\nused to ensure the national representativeness of the sample. Further\ndetails regarding the data set are available at http://www.cpc.unc.edu/\nprojects/addhealth.\nDuring the time of Wave 1 data collection, adolescents ranged in age\nfrom 12 to 19 years. At the time of Wave 3 data collection, the initially\ninterviewed adolescents were young adults as they ranged in age from\nWave 3. The Wave 3 questionnaire was designed to obtain relationship,\nmarital, childbearing, educational histories, and key labor force events.\nSome questions were unchanged from earlier waves. To enhance longi-\ntudinal measures, new sections focus on topics more relevant to young\nadults. The Wave 1 sample included 55% whites, 22% African Americans,\nof the adolescents were boys and 48.9% were girls. For the purposes of\nexamining racial differences in the association of obesity status and health\nconditions in young adulthood, the sample for the current study was\nmean age of the participants in this study during adolescence and young\nadulthood was 15 and 22 years of age, respectively.\nStudy variables\nWeight status. Adolescents' report of height and weight during Wave\n1 allowed for the calculation of BMI, calculated as weight in kilograms\ndivided by height in meters squared (kg/m2). BMI has the advantage\nof being very reliable and easily calculated. BMI also correlates well\nwith direct measures of excess weight in children and adolescents (22).\nImportantly, BMI status also depends on age and sex. Reference BMI\npercentile curves that enable age- and sex-specific percentiles to be\ndetermined have been published by the Centers for Disease Control\n(23) and are used to define overweight and obesity. Children or adoles-\ncents with a BMI more than the 95th percentile for age and sex should\nbeconsideredobese.BMIhasgoodspecificitysothatitseemstoexclude\nsubjects who are not overweight or obese, but it misses some who are\nobese (poorer sensitivity; 24). Adolescents with a BMI more than the\n95th percentile for their age and sex during Wave 1 were \ncategorized\nas obese. The current study uses age- and sex-specific percentiles to\n\ncategorize adolescents as 0 (nonobese) or 1 (obese). In addition, to\ncompute young adult obesity status, a BMI of >30 was used. Based on\nthis, three dummy variables were created: D1 (1 = individuals obese in\nboth adolescence and young adulthood, 0 = otherwise); D2 (1 = indi-\nviduals obese in adolescence but not obese in young adulthood, 0 =\notherwise); and D3 (1 = individuals not obese in adolescence but obese\nin young adulthood, 0 = otherwise). Each dummy variable has to be\ninterpreted as the influence relative to the reference or comparison\ngroup (\nindividuals not obese in adolescence and young adulthood).\nYoung adult disease and health risk conditions. Young adult\n\ndisease and health risk conditions were measured by participant's self-\nreported responses to having ever been diagnosed with the following\ndiseases and health risk conditions during young adulthood: asthma,\ndiabetes, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure. Participants were\nasked the following questions: \"Have you ever been diagnosed with...\n(a) asthma... (b) diabetes... (c) high cholesterol... and (d) high blood\npressure?\" Possible responses to these four questions were 0 = no or\nRace. Race/ethnicity was measured using self-reports from adoles-\ncents. A set of two dichotomous variables (coded 0 and 1) was used to\ncontrast race/ethnicity categories of African Americans and Hispanics\nagainst the reference group, whites.\nStatistical analysis\nAll statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package\nChicago, IL). Before analyses were run, distributions of each variable\nwere examined for skew. All variables with skewness values 2s.e. above\nor below the expected mean of zero were normalized by natural log\ntransformation before any inferential statistical analyses. In addition,\ntests for multicollinearity were conducted among all study variables.\nSubsequent tolerance and variance inflation factor values indicated\nthat multicollinearity was not a problem. The percentage of individu-\nals reporting a particular disease or health risk condition by weight\ncategory, race/ethnicity, and sex was compared across all participants.\nMultiple logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the\nodds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals for the probability that\nweight status, race/ethnicity, and sex are independently associated with\nthe presence of disease and/or health risk condition in young adult-\nhood. Two-way interactions among these factors were also assessed.\nSubsequent logistic regression analyses were performed separately for\narticles\n \nmen and women to illustrate similarities and differences in categorical\nhealth outcomes by sex.\nResults\nHispanic adolescents with complete data across Waves 1 and 3 of\nAdd Health data collection were included in the study analyses. A\ncursory examination of the data revealed never-obese individuals\nhad the lowest percentages of disease and health risk condition,\nwhereas those experiencing persistent obesity generally had the\nhighest percentages (asthma = 21%, high cholesterol = 10%, and\nhigh blood pressure = 16%). Additionally, women appeared to\ndemonstrate consistently higher percentages of disease and risk\ncondition than males (asthma = 18%, diabetes = 1.48%, and high\nblood pressure = 6%). Table 1 shows the percentage and number\nof young adults at various levels of weight status, race/ethnicity,\nand sex according to each health condition.\nTable 2 presents results of factors contributing to young adult\nhealth conditions.

Prior studies conflict regarding whether obesity\nelevates risk of poor health when experienced during adoles-\ncence or when developed after adolescence (9,20). Results from\nthe present analysis suggest experiencing obesity, even when\nisolated to a single developmental period, increased the risk\nfor disease in young adulthood. However, obesity experienced\ncontinuously during adolescence and young adulthood greatly\nintensifiedriskacrossallyoungadulthealthconditionsassessed.\nIn the case of high blood pressure, obesity continuing into\nyoung adulthood more than doubled the risk. Results support\nJeffreys et al.'s (21) cumulative health risk hypothesis where per-\nsistent obesity significantly enhances the relationship between\nweight and health outcomes. It is not that obesity isolated to any\nspecific period of time does not incur lifelong physical health\nrisks, but that continuity of obesity greatly enhances the odds of\ndiagnosed health conditions. Obesity experienced early in life\nnot only creates a lifelong risk for poor health, but can promote\na chronic and intergenerational cycle of weight struggles (4).\nThus, findings are particularly concerning when considering\nthe high probability of an obese adolescent becoming an obese\nadult, an obese parent, and then parent to obese children with\nThe association found between women and asthma is consist-\nentwithpreviousresearch(16)--particularlyconsideringwomen\nwho were continuously obese. However, when examining asthma\nrisk for males, the only men \ndemonstrating increased risk were\nthose obese during young adulthood. Asthma is an important\nindicator of physical health because the condition can serve as a\n\"hallmark of severe disease and poor outcomes\" (27) and often is\nassociated and shares similar antecedents with obesity (28).\nRegardless of sex, obesity at any age increased the risk for\nhigh cholesterol. Yet, when men's and women's health risks\nwere stratified by obesity category, it became evident that\nobesity was especially detrimental for men whose odds of high\n\ncholesterol were considerably higher regardless of when obes-\nity was experienced. Existing diabetes prevalence data have\nmixed results regarding men and women. Although most\nstudies suggest men are at increased risk (e.g., 14,15), Mokdad\net al. (29) found that, overall, women were more likely to\ndevelop diabetes. Present findings support Mokdad et al., but\nwhen considering conflicting research, it is hard to contextual-\nize the importance of the difference. Sex differences in physi-\ncal health ailments are a complex issue, and results from the\npresent analyses reflect this complexity, particularly when sex\nand obesity categories were considered together. Macintyre,\nHunt, and Sweeting (30) urge researchers not to oversimplify\ndifferences in health risk conditions between women and men\nas they found direction and significance of sex differences to be\ndependent on specific health condition, developmental period,\nmethod of assessment, and country of study. Amid an array of\npotentially arbitrary sex differences, obesity surfaces as an even\nstronger predictor of young adult health ailments, especially\nwhen experienced across multiple developmental periods.\nCurrent health statistics paint a bleak picture of African-\nAmerican health outcomes (31). Recent data from the American\nHeart Association indicates black women are at increased risk for\nhypertension, stroke, heart failure, as well as general heart-related\ndisease (14). The same study found black women were less likely\nto be physically active and more likely to be obese. Racial/ethnic\nvariations in young adult health risk conditions are yet another\ndemonstration of the complex relationship between individual\ncharacteristics and disease. Overall, African-American status was\nonly a predictor of increased risk for hypertension in the present\nstudy. Closer examination revealed that differences do exist, but\nonly when comparing African-American and white men and\nwomen separately. One explanation for the lack of consistent and\npervasive race/ethnicity differences that have been observed in\nprevious studies (14,31) is that certain health risk conditions may\ntake longer to present among African-American populations; so,\neven though risk or prevalence does not appear to elevate dur-\ning adolescence or young adulthood, that does not prohibit risks\nfrom intensifying later in adulthood (e.g., \nobesity rates among\nblack men; 4). Although only small differences were found for\nHispanic participants compared to whites, this does not mean\nthey do not exist. Outcomes of this study were dependent on par-\nticipants' reporting they had been diagnosed with a health con-\ndition. Researchers have found that Hispanic health conditions\noften go untreated and/or undiagnosed (32) that, if true for this\nsample, may have masked ethnic differences in health outcomes.\nLimitations\nThereareseverallimitationsinvolvingself-reportdata\ncollection\nthat warrant consideration. First, BMI during both adolescence\nand young adulthood were obtained based on self-report data.\nHowever, this should not impair findings considerably as obese\nindividuals tend to underestimate their BMI--or BMI com-\nponents (i.e., overestimate height and underestimate weight;\n33,34). Thus, significant associations found in the present\nstudy would likely strengthen with objective BMI measure-\nment. Second, outcome variables also are based on self-report\nin that participants reported whether they had ever been diag-\nnosed with specific diseases and health risk conditions. Thus,\nall respondents who answered \"yes\" to any of the conditions\nindicated they had been tested for and diagnosed with the con-\ndition by a medical professional during the Wave 3 assessment\nperiod. Thus, outcomes are based on the diagnosis and not the\nactual presence of a disease or health condition. This means\nthat participants, who have not been diagnosed with a condi-\ntion and responded \"no\" to the outcome variable, may actually\nhave the condition. Additionally, obese individuals are more\nlikely to have been treated by a medical professional than non-\nobese individuals due to obesity-related comorbidities (35).\nHowever, this likely is only an issue for health risk conditions\nthat lack overt symptomatology (i.e., blood pressure, high cho-\nlesterol) as more symptomatic conditions would likely prompt\nmedical attention. Future studies would benefit from a more\nclinical approach to objectively assess physical health; how-\never, such an approach was beyond the scope of the present\nstudy. In spite of these limitations, findings from this analysis\nhighlight a promising direction for health research as well as\nhealth education and intervention.\narticles\n \nConclusion\nResults imply public health research and initiatives must become\nmore specific teasing apart individual characteristics to deter-\nmine true correlates of poor health. Taking a one-dimensional\napproach to health studies by isolating weight status, sex, or\nrace/ethnicity may obscure major differences among popula-\ntions. Research needs to consider these variables in tandem\naccounting for unique health outcomes based on a combination\nof factors. Other variables such as education and socioeconomic\nstatus may also interact with individual characteristics changing\nrelationshipsamongindicatorsandhealth(19).Healthinitiatives\nand interventions can directly benefit from tailored knowledge\nof health conditions--specifically, for whom certain diseases are\na concern and during which developmental period associations\nhave the most strength. This type of information will provide\nclear direction for targeted awareness campaigns, health educa-\ntion programs, as well as direct intervention efforts.\n"
