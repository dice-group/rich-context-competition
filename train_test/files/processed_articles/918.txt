In 1990 Congress\nEdward Yelin, PhD, Dean Sonneborn, MA, and Laura Trupin,\nMPH, Department of Medicine and Institute for Health Policy\nStudies, University of California, San Francisco.\nAddress correspondence to Edward Yelin, PhD, University of\nSubmitted for publication October 2, 1999; accepted in revised\n\u00a9 2000 by the American College of Rheumatology.\npassed and President Bush signed into law the\nAmericans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in part to\nrectify low levels of employment among persons\nwith disabilities, including those with musculoskel-\netal conditions (2,3).\nTitle 1 of the ADA mandates that persons with\ndisabilities be offered reasonable accommodation by\nemployers, whether they are seeking to hold onto a\njob or to obtain a new one (3). Do such accommoda-\ntions help persons with disabilities stay employed?\nThe studies that are not limited to persons with\nmusculoskeletal conditions indicate both that ac-\ncommodation is quite common and that it is associ-\nated with increased rates of employment (4\u00ad7).\nHowever, we could find no studies that evaluated\nthe impact of accommodation on a prospective basis,\nwhich leaves open the possibility of a reporting bias\nin which persons who continued to work were more\nlikely to report having received accommodation,\nwhether or not that is truly the case.\nWith respect to musculoskeletal conditions, sev-\neral studies using clinical samples of persons with\ndiscrete rheumatic conditions and one using a na-\ntional community-based sample of persons with all\nforms of musculoskeletal conditions indicate that\nworkers whose employers provide them with auton-\nomy on the job or who have flexible work rules on\nthe job are more likely to remain in the labor force\n(8\u00ad10); one study of persons with rheumatoid arthri-\ntis (RA) indicated that such workers were not more\nlikely to stay employed (11). However, none of these\nstudies actually reported on the use of specific ac-\ncommodations, and none evaluated the impact of\nreceiving an accommodation at one point on subse-\nquent employment. In this article we document the\nextent to which persons with musculoskeletal con-\nditions who report disability are receiving accommo-\ndations through their employers and whether or not\npersons who receive accommodations are actually\nmore likely to stay employed two years later.\nData source. This report makes use of data from\nthe Health and Retirement Survey (HRS), a national\nprobability sample of noninstitutionalized persons\nregardless of their year of birth (12,13). The HRS is a\nlongitudinal survey with interviews every two years\nbeginning in 1992; the first two years are currently\navailable for analysis. The survey includes extensive\ndata on health and disability status, and measures of\ncurrent and prior employment.\nThe present analysis includes respondents who\nbirth cohort. We have also excluded anyone who did\nnot complete both waves of the survey.\nDefinitions. Morbidity. In the HRS, respondents\nence of major classes of chronic conditions, includ-\ning high blood pressure; diabetes; cancer (by site);\nasthma; other chronic lung disease; coronary heart\ndisease, angina, congestive heart failure, or other\nheart problems; stroke; emotional, nervous, or psy-\nchiatric problems; and arthritis or rheumatism or\nproblems with back or feet. We labeled this last\ngroup \"musculoskeletal conditions.\"\nThe self-reported diagnoses in the HRS should not\nbe construed as being entirely consistent with diag-\nnoses that a physician would provide as a result of a\nhistory, physical exam, and laboratory testing, nor\nare they based on as rigorous a coding scheme as that\nused in the National Health Interview Survey. As a\nresult, they cannot provide an indication of the prev-\nalence of discrete conditions, e.g., RA. However,\nthey do indicate the prevalence of symptomatic\nand/or self-recognized chronic conditions.\nDisability. There are several ways to identify per-\nsons with disabilities in the HRS. First, the employ-\nment status question includes \"disabled and unable\nto work\" as one of several possible responses, along\nwith working, looking for work, and attending\nschool. Using this response to define disability\nwould create an obvious tautology in an analysis of\nthe relationship between employment and disabil-\nity. Second, the health status section contains ques-\ntions related to physical functioning that identify\ndifficulties in performing tasks with a wide range of\nrequirements, from basic activities of daily living\n(eating, dressing, toileting) to jogging a mile. There is\nalso a series of questions about limitations in paid\nwork. We chose to use this activity limitation mea-\nsure because it is most consistent with other health\nsurveys, such as the National Health Interview Sur-\nvey. This measure is also more in keeping with the\nspirit of the ADA, which defines disability based on\na person's interaction with the social environment,\nrather than on capacity to perform self-care or to\nengage in physical activities. Thus, in this report, a\nperson is considered to have a disability if he or she\nreports a limitation in work. When the term \"disabil-\nity\" is used in the remainder of this report, it should\nbe remembered that disability is defined in terms of\nlimitation in work, and that the disability measure\nArthritis Care and Research Impact of Accommodations on Employment 169\ndoes not distinguish among levels of the severity of\ndisability.\nEmployment. In each wave of interviews in the\nHRS, respondents are administered the employment\nstatus measure from the Current Population Survey,\nthe source of federal statistics on labor force partic-\nipation (14). The analyses below are limited to those\nAccommodations. In 1992, the HRS respondents\nwere asked about the presence of accommodations at\nthe job held at the onset of physical impairments, at\nany new jobs entered after onset of impairment, and\nat their current (as of 1992) jobs. The accommoda-\ntions included: 1) providing someone to help the\nrespondent, 2) a shorter work day, 3) more breaks\nand rest periods, 4) special transportation, 5) special\nequipment, 6) changing the time that work started\nand stopped, 7) training for new skills, and 8) chang-\ning the job to something the respondent can do. Both\nbecause the reliability of respondents' reports about\naccommodations provided in the past may be sus-\npect and because our intent is to evaluate the impact\nof contemporaneous accommodations on subse-\nquent employment, we did not include the informa-\ntion about past accommodations in our analyses.\nAnalyses. In the HRS, there were 8,781 respon-\ndents between the ages of 51 and 61 years who were\nreported one or more musculoskeletal conditions.\nBecause of our focus on accommodations among\npersons with musculoskeletal conditions who were\nemployed and who reported disabilities, the princi-\npal analyses below are limited to the 502 who met\nthese criteria. The groups excluded are the 3,005\npersons with musculoskeletal conditions who were\nemployed but who did not report disability, the\n1,156 who were not employed and reported disabil-\nity, and the 832 who were not employed and did not\nreport disability.\nThe HRS sample was constructed using a national\nmultistage probability design, with a basic sampling\nframe of the noninstitutionalized population within\nthe nation. In addition, the HRS oversampled Afri-\ncan Americans, Hispanics, and, because of the age\nrange of interest, residents of Florida (12). The re-\nsponse rate for the overall sample in the HRS was\n0.821; the response rate for the oversample frames\namong African Americans was 0.826, among Florid-\nThe HRS public use data files include sampling\nweights to account for the oversample, nonresponse,\nand for attrition among respondents between 1992\nand 1994. In describing the prevalence of the per-\nsons with musculoskeletal conditions, stratified by\nemployment and disability status, we use expansion\nweights that allow us to report the frequency in the\npopulation at large. Thus, after the application of the\nsampling weights, the persons with musculoskeletal\nresent approximately 14.40 million persons, while\nthe 502 persons with musculoskeletal conditions\nwho were employed and reported disability in 1992\nrepresent approximately 1.32 million.\nWe first show the medical and demographic char-\nacteristics of persons with musculoskeletal condi-\ntions by their disability and employment status. Sub-\nsequently, we indicate the frequency with which\nemployed persons with musculoskeletal conditions\nand disability report each kind of accommodation,\nany form of accommodation, and the total number of\naccommodations. In order to determine whether\nthere are patterns to the receipt of accommodations,\nwe then use multivariate logistic regression to esti-\nmate the impact of the demographic and medical\ncharacteristics of these individuals as well as of their\noccupations on the probability that they receive in-\ndividual accommodations or any form of accommo-\ndation or on the total number of accommodations.\nFinally, we estimate multivariate models of the\nimpact of individual accommodations, any form of\naccommodation, or the total number of accommoda-\ntions on 1994 employment status. In addition to the\naccommodation variables, the models include these\ncharacteristics: sex, race (white versus non-white),\nmarital status (married versus not married), extent of\nformal education, family income, global physical\nhealth status, global mental health status, whether or\nnot the individual reported one or more nonmuscu-\nloskeletal conditions, the total number of limita-\ntions reported in physical activities, and whether the\nindividual was in a white or blue collar occupation\nIn the two sets of logistic regressions, we use pro-\nportional weights, that is, weights that take into ac-\ncount the sampling methods described above but\nthat are scaled to the actual sample size, in this case\n502 persons. As a result, test statistics are estimated\non the actual sample size.\nA selection bias may affect the estimates of the\nimpact of accommodation on employment. Such a\nbias may exist if the respondents who receive accom-\nmodation are more severely affected than those who\ndo not, with the result that those who receive accom-\nmodation were substantially more likely to stop\nworking. To determine if such a bias affects the\nresults, we estimated a corrective factor (lambda) for\nselection bias using LIMDEP software (15) and then\nadded the corrective factor to models testing the\nimpact of accommodation.\nThe HRS sample was constructed using a national\nmultistage probability design, with systematic over-\nsampling of African Americans, Hispanics, and res-\nidents of Florida (12). To take into account the com-\nplex nature of the design, we used SUDAAN\nsoftware for the calculation of standard errors and\ncomputation of statistical tests for all the results\nreported below (16). SUDAAN makes use of the Tay-\nlor series linearization method. Specifically, we used\nthis software to describe the characteristics of per-\nsons with musculoskeletal conditions in strata de-\nfined by disability and employment status, to esti-\nmate the impact of demographic and medical\ncharacteristics and occupations on the probability of\nusing specific accommodations or any form of ac-\ncommodation among those with disabilities and\nwho were employed in 1992, and to estimate the\nimpact of accommodations on employment in the\nlatter group.\nRESULTS\nTable 1 compares the demographic and medical\ncharacteristics of persons with musculoskeletal con-\nditions in 1992, by disability and employment sta-\nyears reported a musculoskeletal condition. Of\nthese, 1.32 million (9.2%) reported a disability and\nstated that they did not have a disability and that\ndisability but were not employed, and 2.18 million\n(15.1%) said that they were not disabled and were\nnot employed.\nIn part because we limited our analysis to the HRS\nage structure of the 4 groups did not differ substan-\ntially. Women constitute a significantly larger frac-\ntion of those who were not employed--both with\nand without disabilities--and non-whites a signifi-\ncantly larger fraction of those who reported a disabil-\nity and not being employed. Not surprisingly, the\npersons with musculoskeletal conditions who were\nemployed were more likely to have at least a high\nschool degree. No doubt reflecting the contribution\nof their own earnings to family income, those who\nwere employed were more likely to have higher fam-\nily incomes.\nPersons with musculoskeletal conditions report-\ning disability were more likely to have chronic con-\nditions other than the musculoskeletal one. Such\npersons, particularly those who were not employed,\nwere much less likely to report excellent, very good,\nor good physical health status. Persons with disabil-\nities who were not employed were more likely to\nreport poor mental health status.\nIn the remainder of this article, we focus on the\nTable 1.

Among these persons, the musculoskeletal\nconditions were cited as a cause of the individuals'\ndisability 69% of the time and as the main cause\n58% of the time. Work loss occurred frequently\namong those who were employed with disability:\nTable 2 shows the frequency with which accom-\nmodations were reported by these individuals. Over-\nall, only 17.9% of persons with musculoskeletal con-\nditions who had a disability and were employed\nindicated that they had received any form of accom-\nmodation on their current jobs. Although no form of\naccommodation was reported with great frequency,\nthe most commonly used ones included getting\nsomeone to help do one's job (12.1%), scheduling\nmore breaks during the work day (9.5%), changing\nthe time that the work day started and stopped\n(6.3%), having a shorter work day (5.6%), getting\nspecial equipment (5.3%), and changing the work\ntasks (5.3%). Receiving training in new skills (3.3%)\nand receiving special transportation (1.8%) were re-\nported less frequently. Although a relatively small\nproportion reported receiving accommodations,\namong those who did, the majority stated that they\nhad received two or more, which may indicate that\nworkplaces that provide one form of accommodation\nare more likely to provide other forms as well.\nIn Table 3, we show the impact of individual de-\nmographic and medical characteristics and occupa-\ntion on the receipt of each of the forms of accommo-\ndation, after taking into account the other variables\nin the model. In general, health and functional status\nwere the most consistent characteristics associated\nwith accommodation. For example, poor health was\nassociated with having been provided a shorter work\nday and more breaks during the day. Similarly, per-\nsons who reported high levels of functional limita-\ntions were more likely to report being able to take\nmore breaks during the day and to receive special\ntransportation and equipment. Such persons were\nalso more likely to report receiving any form of ac-\ncommodation. With respect to demographic factors,\nmen were more likely to report receiving special\nequipment and the opportunity to change the tasks\nto those they could do; this may reflect the kinds of\nwork men do and longer tenure on their jobs. Of\nnote, persons who were married were less likely to\nreport receiving special transportation, perhaps be-\ncause they can rely on their spouses for this service.\nIn addition, white collar workers were more likely to\nreport being able to change the time that work starts\nand stops than persons in blue collar occupations.\nSimilarly, persons with higher incomes were more\nlikely to report learning a new skill or receiving any\nform of accommodation.\nAfter adjustment for demographic and medical\ncharacteristics, accommodation did not have a\nstrong positive effect on employment (Table 4). In-\ndeed, the only form of accommodation that was as-\nsociated with an increase in employment was getting\nsomeone to help with work. Persons who reported\nreceiving a change in work tasks and those who\nreported learning new skills were actually less likely\nto be employed in 1994 than those who did not,\nsuggesting that receiving these forms of accommoda-\ntion did not succeed in forestalling the loss of em-\nployment. Overall, we found that receiving any form\nof accommodation in 1992 had no impact on the\nDISCUSSION\nWork disability accounts for a majority of the eco-\nnomic costs of musculoskeletal conditions (17);\nmusculoskeletal conditions, in turn, are among the\nmost common conditions associated with work dis-\nability (1). Unfortunately, return to employment oc-\ncurs relatively rarely among persons with musculo-\nskeletal conditions (18). As a result, to increase the\nproportion of persons with musculoskeletal condi-\ntions who are employed, it is necessary to increase\nthe proportion who stay on the job. This has not\noccurred, since we found that 25% of the persons\nwith musculoskeletal conditions who were em-\nTable 2.

Under the ADA, employers are re-\nquired to provide reasonable accommodations to\npersons with disabilities, provided that the persons\nwith disabilities can perform the essential functions\nof the job. Are accommodations being provided, and,\nif so, do the accommodations provided improve the\nemployment rate among persons with musculoskel-\netal conditions and disability?\nIn this report, we used data from a national prob-\nability sample of noninstitutionalized adults aged\n51\u00ad61 years to answer these two questions. We\nfound that fewer than one-fifth of persons with mus-\nculoskeletal conditions and disabilities who were\nemployed in 1992 reported receiving any form of\naccommodation and that the receipt of such accom-\nmodation in that year did not improve the employ-\nment rate as of 1994. The only exception to this\nfinding is that persons who stated that they received\nhelp from someone else to do their job had higher\nemployment rates in the latter year.\nThe study had relatively limited power to detect\nsuch effects. Although there were 5,495 persons with\nmusculoskeletal conditions interviewed in both\nwith disabilities, and accommodations occurred in-\nfrequently (from a low of 1.8% reporting the receipt\nof special equipment to a high of only 12.1% report-\ning the receipt of help from someone else). In addi-\ntion, the list of accommodations may not have been\nspecific enough for musculoskeletal conditions, pre-\ncluding the possibility of finding a positive effect on\nemployment. Finally, it may be necessary to apply\naccommodations early after onset of disease, but\nthere were too few incident cases of musculoskele-\ntal-related disability to detect an effect of accommo-\ndations provided at this point in the disease.\nWhat can account for the infrequency with which\naccommodations are provided? It is possible that\nemployers and persons with disabilities were not\nfully acclimated to the ADA in 1992. Large employ-\ners had only been subject to the regulations under\nthe ADA for one year as of 1992, and smaller em-\nployers were just becoming subject to them in that\nyear. As a result, accommodations may have been\nprovided only to those workers with severe medical\nconditions, for whom the a priori probability of the\nmaintenance of employment was low. The results of\nthis study support this view, as physical and mental\nhealth status and the number of functional limita-\ntions were the most consistent characteristics asso-\nciated with the receipt of accommodations. Figure 1\nprovides additional support for this view by show-\ning that the probability of accommodation only rises\nsubstantially as the number of functional limitations\nis in the upper quintile, after the point at which the\nprobability of employment begins to fall. Thus, accom-\nmodations may be provided when functional status\nis so poor as to preclude continued employment.\nAssuming that the finding that accommodation\ndid not have a positive impact on employment is not\ndue to the sample size, what may account for the\nlack of effect? The macroeconomic situation in 1992\nmay be partially responsible. Unemployment rates\nwere relatively high in that year. High unemploy-\nment rates reduce the employment of persons with\ndisabilities to a greater extent than among persons\nwithout disabilities (19), and, indeed, the high un-\nemployment rates in that year resulted in a substan-\ntial increase in the number of persons applying for\nSocial Security Disability Insurance benefits (20).\nMoreover, 25% of all persons with musculoskeletal\nconditions who were employed in 1992 lost or left\ntheir jobs by 1994, suggesting that a strong protective\neffect of accommodation would have been necessary\nto preserve employment. Because the ADA had only\nrecently been implemented, the unemployment rate\nwas high, and accommodations were offered infre-\nquently and, when offered, were provided to persons\nTable 4.

Possible responses ranged from 1\n(no difficulty) to 4 (unable to do).\n Statistically significant (P  0.05 by chi-square test).\nwith musculoskeletal conditions of heightened se-\nverity, 1992 may not provide a fair test of the effect of\naccommodation on employment of persons with\nmusculoskeletal conditions and disabilities.\nNevertheless, the results of this inquiry indicate\nthat in 1992 when the ADA was first being imple-\nmented, accommodations were not often provided to\npersons with musculoskeletal conditions and dis-\nability, and when provided did not appear to result\nin a substantial improvement in their 1994 employ-\nment. The ADA mandates reasonable accommoda-\ntion, necessitating continued vigilance to ensure that\nthe law is being followed, and if not, to determine\nwhy. Assuming that the frequency of accommoda-\ntion has increased since 1992 due to the dissemina-\ntion of information about the ADA, it will be inter-\nesting to determine if an increased frequency of\naccommodation also results in an increased impact\non employment. In turn, it will be necessary to de-\ntermine if the increasing effectiveness of accommo-\ndation is merely the result of providing accommoda-\ntion to those of lesser disease severity or is due to\nincreased knowledge as to what kinds of accom-\nmodations to provide and when to provide them.\nHowever, as of 1992, persons with musculoskeletal\nconditions and disability were not receiving accom-\nmodations very often and, even when receiving\nthem, the impact on employment was not substantial.\nREFERENCES\n1.
