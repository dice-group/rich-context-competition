Five criminal court\njudges were asked to assess whether the\nself reported defensive gun uses were\nlikely to have been legal.\nResults--Even after excluding many re-\nported firearm victimizations, far more\nsurvey respondents report having been\nthreatened or intimidated with a gun than\nhaving used a gun to protect themselves. A\nmajority of the reported self defense gun\nuses were rated as probably illegal by a\nmajority of judges. This was so even under\nthe assumption that the respondent had a\npermit to own and carry the gun, and that\nthe respondent had described the event\nhonestly.\nConclusions--Guns are used to threaten\nand intimidate far more often than they\nare used in self defense. Most self reported\nself defense gun uses may well be illegal\nand against the interests of society.\n",
    "reduced_content": "Gun use in the United States: results from two\nnational surveys\nD Hemenway, D Azrael, M Miller\n Keywords: firearms; guns; self defense; legality\nThe United States has a higher homicide rate\nthan other developed nations, and most of our\nmurders are committed with firearms. On an\naverage day in the 1990s in the United States,\n35\u00ad50 Americans were murdered with fire-\nassaults but did not die.1 Shootings that result\nin injury are a small percentage of hostile\nevents involving firearms.2 In some of these\nevents guns may thwart criminal assaults, in\nothers they may be instruments of aggression.\nEvidence about the incidence and character-\nistics of gun victimization and self defense gun\nuse come from two types of survey. The first is\nthe large, public National Crime Victimization\nSurvey (NCVS). The NCVS, conducted by the\nCensus Bureau for the Bureau of Justice\nStatistics, asks questions of the same household\nevery six months for three years. By excluding\nincidents reported in the first interview (that is,\nby \"bounding\" the responses), the NCVS\ngreatly reduces the substantial problem of \"tel-\nescoping\" (the reporting of events that actually\noccurred outside the time frame in question).\nIn criminal victimization surveys, telescoping\ncan increase estimates by between 40% and\n50% depending on the type of crime; the infla-\ntion rate is greatest for violent crimes.3 4\nThe NCVS focuses on six specific serious\ncrimes (for example, assault, rape, robbery)\nand asks the respondent whether s/he has been\nthe victim of an attempted or completed crime\nwithin the preceding six months. Follow up\nquestions ask whether the oVender used a gun\nin the criminal attempt, as well as what, if any-\nthing, the respondent did to protect him/\nherself. Estimates from the NCVS suggest that\neach year about one million violent crimes\ninvolve guns while victims use guns in self\nMany smaller, one shot private surveys have\nasked one or more questions about self defense\ngun use.7 Estimates of self defense gun use\nfrom such surveys are an order of magnitude\nhigher than the NCVS estimates. Two features\nof these private surveys probably explain most\nof this diVerence: (1) responses are unbounded\nand (2) all respondents are asked about defen-\nsive gun use, not just those respondents who\nreport that they have been the victim of an\nattempted crime.8\u00ad11 These two features should\nalso make private survey estimates of gun\nvictimization higher than the NCVS estimates.2\non defensive and oVensive gun use were\nconducted under the auspices of the Harvard\nInjury Control Research Center. The Harvard\nsurveys appear to be the only private surveys to\nask either (1) open ended questions about\ndefensive gun uses, or (2) detailed questions of\neach respondent about both gun victimization\nand self defense gun uses. This article presents\nevidence on the relative frequency and circum-\nstances of these two types of gun use, as well as\non their probable legality.\nMethods\nData come from two national random digit dial\nsurveys conducted by Fact Finders, Inc in the\nadults living in the 50 states.\nThe samples were stratified by state, with the\nnumber of interviews designated for each state\ndetermined by that state's population relative\nto the total population according to the 1990\ncensus. All households with a single telephone\nline, including those with unlisted numbers,\nhad an equal probability of inclusion in the\nDepartment of Health\nPolicy and\nManagement, Harvard\nSchool of Public\nHuntington Avenue,\nUSA\nD Hemenway\nD Azrael\nM Miller\nCorrespondence to:\nProfessor Hemenway\n(hemenway@hsph.harvard.edu)\nwww.injuryprevention.com\ngroup.bmj.com\ninjuryprevention.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nsample. Households without a telephone were\nexcluded from the sample.\nNo more than one adult from each house-\nhold was interviewed. Rather than interview\nthe adult who happened to be at home at the\ntime of the call, the interviewers alternately\nasked to speak with a man or with a woman liv-\ning in the household. If there was no adult liv-\ning in the household of the requested gender,\nthe initial respondent was interviewed. Results\nshow unweighted data.\nOnce a telephone number was randomly\nselected, as many as 10 repeat phone calls were\nmade until a final disposition was assigned. In\nThese response rates are comparable to other\nRespondents who answered yes to either gun\nuse qualifying question were asked up to 30\nfollow up questions about the most recent\nevent, including an open ended question which\nasked them to describe the incident. All results\neliminate respondents who were police oYcers,\nsecurity guards, or military personnel. Results\nalso eliminate cases in which the respondent\nreported that the event occurred more than five\nyears before the survey or outside the United\nStates.\nIn the case of hostile gun displays, we also\neliminated incidents in which the respondent\nrefused to provide any detailed information\nabout the event at the time of the initial inter-\nview, the respondent appeared to be an\nobserver rather a participant in the event, or\nwas thought to be a criminal (for example, by\nthe police). We were more stringent about what\nwas counted as a hostile gun display, and more\npermissive about was counted as a self defense\ngun use.\nThe specific qualifying questions in both\nwere asked \"In the past five years, has anyone\nused, displayed or brought out a gun in a hos-\ntile manner against you [italics added], even if\nthis event did not take place as part of the\ncommission of a crime?\" The 1996 question\ndid not include the \"against you\" and so\nobtained more instances when the respondent\nwas merely a witness.\nThe 1999 survey inadvertently omitted an\nopen ended question about the most recent\nhostile gun display. Four to eight months after\nthe initial interview we tried to recontact all\nthose who had reported a hostile gun display\nagainst them. We were able to gain a verbatim\ndescription of the most recent event from half\nthese respondents. In 6% of these instances it\nappeared that the respondent merely witnessed\nthe hostile gun display. In calculating the\nnumber of hostile gun displays, we thus\nexcluded 6% of all non-contacted respondents\nwho reported a hostile gun display.\nasked \"In the past five years, have you used,\ndisplayed or brought out a gun in self defense\nto protect yourself from a person or people?\"\nThe 1996 survey asked \"In the past five years,\nhave you used a gun to protect yourself from a\nperson or people?\"\nIn order to obtain a generous estimate of self\ndefense gun uses, we included incidents even\nwhen the respondent refused to give any infor-\nmation about the event or, from the descrip-\ntion, it appeared the other party never knew the\nrespondent displayed the gun.\nSelf defense gun use incidents were summa-\nrized and sent to five criminal court judges\n(from California, Pennsylvania, and Massachu-\nsetts) who were assured anonymity. The judges\nwere told to assume that the respondent had a\npermit to own and carry the gun and had\ndescribed the event honestly from his/her own\nperspective. The judges were then asked to give\ntheir best guess whether, based on the\nrespondent's description of the incident, the\nrespondent's use of the gun was very likely\nlegal, likely legal, as likely as not legal, unlikely\nlegal, or very unlikely legal.\nResults\nThe percentages of respondents reporting hos-\ntile gun displays in the two surveys are not sta-\ntistically diVerent, nor are the percentages of\nrespondents reporting a self defense gun use.\nResults of the two surveys are therefore\ncombined in the analysis.\na hostile gun display against them. We\neliminated over half of these for a variety of\nreasons (table 1), leaving 58 civilians who\nTable 1 Hostile gun displays: gun use against respondents\nRespondents Incidents Respondents Incidents Respondents Incidents\nExclusions:\n*Based on % of a sample of cases in which the narrative indicated that respondent had only witnessed the event.\nwww.injuryprevention.com\ngroup.bmj.com\ninjuryprevention.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nreported 112 hostile gun displays against them\nin the previous five years.2\nreported a hostile gun uses against them. One\nman reported 97 gun uses and was excluded.\nWe also excluded 15 police, security guards\nand military personnel, 14 people who re-\nsponded that the gun user might have thought\ns/he was a criminal, and one who reported that\nthe event took place six years before the survey.\nOf the remaining 100, we received a verbatim\ndescription from 50; 6% appeared to have\nmerely witnessed the event (\"It was between\ntwo other people; a gun was displayed, it could\nhave ricocheted\"). We eliminated 6% of the\nevents.\nAfter appropriate exclusions, 152 respond-\nents from the combined surveys reported 271\nincidents (table 1).\nThree examples of hostile gun displays\nagainst respondents from the 1999 survey are:\nx \"I'm a cattle farmer and he's a cattle farmer.\nHe was putting his bulls and heifers up near\nthe fence and my bull broke out and he got\nmad\".\nx \"I was on a date.

On the\nusing a gun in self defense, accounting for 92\ngun uses. For both surveys combined, a total of\npeople who were not police, military personnel,\nor security guards (table 2).\nIn each survey, the number of respondents\nreporting that they were gun victims exceeded\nthe number of respondents reporting that they\nhad used a gun in self defense by over three to\nOn both surveys combined, 2.9% of gun\nowners, 0.3% of those living in the home with\nsomeone who owns a gun, and 0.4% of\nnon-gun owners reported a self defense gun\nuse (table 3). After eliminating police, security\nguards and military personnel, approximately\n1% of respondents reported a self defense gun\nOf the 43 respondents reporting a self\ndefense gun use, six did not provide a descrip-\ntion of the most recent event, and for two more\nthe descriptions indicated that the respondent\ndid not use the firearm (for example, one never\nencountered the thieves who had stolen his\ntruck). The criminal court judges were shown\nsummaries of the remaining 35 events; each\njudge rated each event. Twenty per cent of the\ntime a judge rated a case as \"as likely legal as\nillegal\". Excluding these ratings (when judges\noften said there was not enough information), a\nprobably legal. For two there was no majority\nopinion. In 23 of 35 events the judges were\nunanimous in their ratings; nine times there\nwas one dissenter; and in three instances the\nratings were either 3\u00ad2 or 2\u00ad2 in terms of the\nprobable legality of the self defense gun use.\nTwo examples from the 1999 survey of inci-\ndents that were unanimously deemed probably\nillegal were:\nx A 62 year old male said that at 6 pm \"the\npolice called. My alarm at my business went\noV so I went there to shut it oV. Two men\nwere outside my building, so from my car I\nshot at the ground near them\". The\nrespondent said the men were trespassing.\nx A 58 year old male was inside his home at 2\npm. \"I was watching a movie and [an\nacquaintance] interrupted me. I yelled that I\nwas going to shoot him and he ran to his\ncar\". The respondent said his acquaintance\nwas committing a verbal assault. The\nrespondent's gun, a .44 Magnum, was\nlocated \"in my holster on me\".\nTwo examples of self defense gun use from\ndeemed probably legal were:\nx A 26 year old male was with friends at\nanother's home. At 8:30 am \"a friend of\nmine was in the process of getting robbed\nand he was drunk. We went to help him just\nas the robbers were leaving\". The respond-\nent's gun was not loaded and \"I never really\ntook it out of my pocket\".\nx A 38 year old male was inside his home at 4\nam. \"Someone broke in; I woke up to the\nsound. I got my gun from the safe [loaded it]\nand went downstairs. The person left and I\ncalled the police\". The respondent did not\nknow whether the burglar had a weapon.\ndefense gun use incidents from the two surveys\nwere reported by six respondents. Three people\nthe previous five years, but refused to describe\nthe most recent event. In the 1999 survey, an\n18 year old male reported six cases.

They fired and I fired\".\nDiscussion\nConsistent with results from the NCVS and\nprivate one shot surveys,2 we find that far more\nrespondents report criminal gun uses against\nthem than self defense gun uses by them. The\nresults hold even though, in order to be as con-\nservative as possible, we (1) eliminate many of\nthe reported hostile gun uses against the\nrespondent, and (2) include virtually all the\nreported self defense gun uses.\nOur surveys yield higher estimates of both\ncriminal and self defense gun use than does the\nNCVS, probably due to telescoping and due to\nthe fact that our respondents could report a\ngun use without first reporting that someone\ntried to commit a crime against them.8 11 These\nfactors need not diVerentially aVect the relative\nincidence of gun victimization versus self\ndefense gun use, which we report here.\nHowever, our results should not be extrapo-\nlated to obtain population based estimates of\nthe absolute number of gun uses. If we have as\nlittle as 1% random misclassification, our\nresults could be oV by orders of magnitude. It\nappears we can obtain substantially higher rates\nof self defense gun use if we ask respondents\nabout events in the previous six months rather\nthan the previous five years.7 On the other hand,\nwe can obtain substantially lower rates of self\ndefense gun use if we eliminate the handful of\nrespondents who report the vast majority of\nuses, the various respondents who report uses\nthat do not appear to meet reasonable criteria\nfor actual use, or the respondents whose use\nappears oVensive rather than defensive.\nWhile it is sometimes presumed that self\ndefense gun use is beneficial for society, that\nnotion has been viewed with increasing skepti-\ncism.10 11 It is noteworthy that in prison\nsurveys, about half of convicted felons who\nhave fired a gun claim to have done so in self\nIn our survey, the criminal court judges who\nrated the incidents determined that at least half\nwere probably illegal--even after assuming that\nthe respondent had a permit to own and carry\na gun and described the incident honestly. We\nexpect that the true percentage of reported self\ndefense gun uses that are illegal is higher than\n50% for at least two reasons.\nFirst, three respondents reported over 58%\nof the self defense gun uses, and none of their\naccounts were read by the judges (since all\nrefused to provide a description of the most\nrecent event). Many reported self defense gun\nuses from a respondent creates a suspicion that\nthe uses may be aggressive rather than\ndefensive.\nSecond, the reports read by the judges are\nonly one side of a hostile interaction that usu-\nally occurred months or years before the\nsurvey. We expect respondents will view the\nhostile encounter from their own perspective;\nin any mutual combat both participants may\nbelieve that the other side is the aggressor and\nthat they themselves are acting in self defense.\nIn addition, when describing the event, re-\nspondents will typically want to present them-\nCertainly some self defense gun uses are\nlegal and in the public interest. But many are\nnot. The possibility of using a gun in a socially\nuseful manner--against a criminal during the\ncommission of a crime--will rarely, if ever,\noccur for the average gun owner. By contrast, at\nany other moment, the use of a gun against\nanother human is illegal, and socially undesir-\nable. Regular citizens with guns, who are\nsometimes tired, angry, drunk or afraid, and\nwho are not trained in dispute resolution or on\nwhen it is proper to use a firearm, have many\nopportunities for inappropriate gun use. People\nengage in innumerable annoying and some-\nwhat hostile interactions with others in the\ncourse of a lifetime. We might expect that\nunlawful \"self defense\" gun uses will outnum-\nber the legitimate and socially beneficial ones.\nTrained police oYcers are often inad-\nequately prepared to handle ambiguous but\npotentially dangerous situations. Heavy stress,\nconfusion, and fear are inherent in most possi-\nble shooting situations. Heart rates skyrocket,\nand it is diYcult to think clearly and to act\ndeliberately. Not surprisingly, even the police\nmake serious mistakes in their firearm use.\nIndividuals without training or experience can\nbe expected to do much worse.\nOur findings have various limitations. Our\nresults are based on self reports of past events,\nwith the potential of recall bias. The surveys\nunder-sampled poor people who may have\nmore hostile conflicts with firearms than their\nricher counterparts. The key questions from the\ntwo surveys, though very similar, were not iden-\ntical, and neither survey sampled anyone under\nage 18. In addition, we have detailed infor-\nmation only on the most recent self defense and\ncriminal gun incidents; to the extent that the\nmost recent incident is not typical of all the\nincidents experienced by the respondent, our\nfindings may not be representative.\nOnly five judges, from three states, assessed\nthe self defense gun incidents from the surveys;\nTable 3 Number (%) of individuals reporting a self defense gun use by reported gun ownership\nFirearm\nDefensive\nuse Total %\nDefensive\nuse Total %\nDefensive\nuse Total %\nwww.injuryprevention.com\ngroup.bmj.com\ninjuryprevention.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nthey were a convenience rather than a random\nsample, and the sample is too small to be con-\nfident of the stability of the aggregate ratings\nwe report here.\nDespite these limitations, our surveys pro-\nvide evidence about gun uses in American\nsociety that has not been available before. Our\nresults indicate that gun use against adults to\nthreaten and intimidate is far more common\nthan self defense gun use by them, and that\nmost self reported self defense gun uses are\nprobably illegal, and may be against the\ninterests of society.\nThis research was supported in part by the grants from the Cent-\ners for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institute of\nJustice, the Open Society Institute, and the Joyce Foundation.\n1 Annest JL, Mercy JA, Gibson DR, et al.

Using data from various national sources the authors found that\nwhen compared with drivers of the same age who had no passengers, the relative risk of 16\nyear old drivers' deaths per 10 million trips was 39% higher for those with one passenger,\n86% higher for those with two, and nearly three times higher for those with three or more\npassengers. Similar patterns were found for 17 year old drivers. Perhaps not surprisingly,\ndriver crashes were greater when the passengers were male and under 30 and the death rates\nfor teen drivers were substantially increased late at night. The authors note that a previous\nsurvey of high school drivers found that dangerous driving behaviors were strongly associated\nwith the presence of peers. They conclude that the results support the need for graduated\ndriver's licensing system for teens. Such a system is in place in 24 states. An accompanying\neditorial by Robert Foss states \"This is clear and convincing evidence that state [graduated\ndriver's licensing] systems should include passenger restrictions during the initial stages of\ndriver licensing\" (JAMA 2000 (March), Li-Hui Chen and colleagues).\nMany papers in our most formidable rival, Accident Analysis and Prevention, are noteworthy.\nIn the January 2000 issue (vol 32) one by Gregersen et al reports on the beneficial eVects of\na 16 years age limit for learner drivers in Sweden (p 25\u00ad36) and another, by Elvik, describes\nthe relevant costs and benefits of road safety measures for pedestrians and drivers (p 37\u00ad46),\nThere is also an exploration of the barriers to bicycle helmet use in 12 and 13 year olds by\npapers are quite technical, mainly of interest to engineers.
