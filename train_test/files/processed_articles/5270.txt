Lp-PLA2 was initially\nrecognized for its action in hydrolysing a\nplatelet-activating factor, and was first\nnamed platelet-activating factor acetylhy-\ndrolase. Secreted by monocytes, macro-\nphages, and T cells, Lp-PLA2 is a member\nof the phospholipase A2 (PLA2) superfam-\nily and comprises 441 amino acid residues\nFollowing secretion, Lp-PLA2 enters the\nblood circulation and binds to lipoprotein\nparticles, mainly low-density lipoproteins\n(LDL; approximately 80%) and high-\ndensity lipoproteins (HDL).17 Lp-PLA2\ncan generate pro-inflammatory molecules\nsuch as lyso-phosphatidylcholine and\noxidized free fatty acids,16 and these\ninflammatory factors promote atheroscler-\nosis through several pathways.18 High levels\nof Lp-PLA2 have been associated with an\nAlthough a relationship between the\nPLA2G7 gene and CHD has been demon-\nstrated in the Chinese population,22\u00ad24 the\nrelationship between serum Lp-PLA2 levels\nand CHD remains poorly understood in this\npopulation. The aim of the present study\nwas to evaluate the association of Lp-PLA2\nwith CHD and coronary plaque stability in a\nChinese population, in an attempt to pro-\nvide novel clues regarding atherosclerosis\ndevelopment and eventual future thera-\npeutic approaches.\nPatients and methods\nStudy population\nThe present retrospective, observational\ncohort study included consecutively enrolled\npatients who underwent diagnostic coronary\nangiography for evaluation of CHD at the\nNo. 2 Department of Cardiology, Tianjin\nChest Hospital, Tianjin, China between\ndiagnosed with CHD and patients with\nnormal coronary angiography (control\ngroup) were included.\nDiagnosis of CHD was based on vascular\nstenosis ! 50% in the left main artery, left\nanterior descending artery, left circumflex\nartery, and/or right coronary artery. The\nfollowing clinical indicators of CHD were\nconsidered: (1) ischemic symptoms; (2) new\nischemic electrocardiogram (ECG) changes\n(new ST-T wave changes or new left bundle\nbranch block); (3) ECG pathological Q\nwaves; (4) imaging evidence of new loss of\nviable myocardium or new regional wall\nmotion abnormality; and (5) coronary angi-\nography or autopsy confirmation of throm-\nbus in the coronary artery.25\nFor subgroup analyses, patients with\nCHD were further divided into those with\nstable angina pectoris (defined as angina\nduring effort without evidence of recent\nworsening, or angina at rest in the preced-\ning 3 months), unstable angina pectoris\n(defined as the presence of angina at rest\nthat occurred during the preceding 48 hours\nwith significant transient ischemic\nST-segment and/or T-wave changes without\na significant increase in serum creatine\nkinase level [Braunwald's class III-B]), or\nacute myocardial infarction (defined as the\npresence of >30 min continuous chest pain,\nST-segment elevation >2.0 mm on ! 2 con-\ntiguous electrocardiographic leads, and\nserum creatine kinase level >150 IU/dl).\nDiabetes was diagnosed according to\ndiagnostic criteria of the China Guideline\npatients with diabetes symptoms (including\ntypical symptoms such as polydipsia, poly-\nuria, and unexplained weight loss) and (a)\nrandom blood glucose (without considering\nthe last meal time, any time-of-day) blood\nglucose >11.1 mmol/, or (b) fasting blood\nglucose (fasting state at least 8 h without\ncalorie consumption) >7 mmol/l, or (c)\nglucose 2 h following glucose load test\n>11.1 mmol/l; and (2) in patients without\nsymptoms of diabetes, a repeated examin-\nation to obtain a clear diagnosis.\nHypertension was defined as systolic\nblood pressure ! 140 mmHg and/or dia-\nstolic blood pressure ! 90 mmHg, and/or\nthe use of anti-hypertensive drugs.\nPatients meeting any of the following\ncriteria were excluded: (1) primary myocar-\ndiopathy, endocarditis, or severe valvular\nheart disease; (2) coronary arteritis or\ndiseases that may cause non-atherosclerotic\ncoronary artery stenosis; (3) any autoimmune\ndisease; (4) acute or chronic infectious disease\nwithin 2 weeks prior to study participation;\n(5) severe liver or renal insufficiency such as\naminotransferase levels greater than twice the\nupper limit of normal, or creatinine clear-\nance < 50ml/min; or (6) malignant tumour.\nThe study was approved by the ethics\ncommittee of Tianjin Chest Hospital, and\nwritten informed consent was obtained from\nall patients.\nEvaluation of coronary angiography\nand coronary stenosis\nCoronary angiography was performed\nwithin 24 h of symptom onset using\na LAUNCHER\u00d5 coronary catheter\n(Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) and\nthe standard Judkins technique.27 All\npatients were routinely injected with 2 000\nU of sodium heparin using a standard\ntransradial or femoral artery approach.\nThe visual method was used with an angiog-\nraphy catheter as a reference (6 F angiog-\nraphy catheter, 1 F \u00bc 0.33cm) to estimate the\nreference vessel diameter and pathological\nsegment diameter stenosis at the following\npositions: left anterior oblique, 30; left\nanterior oblique 30 \u00fe head position, 30;\nleft anterior oblique, 45 \u00fe foot position,\n45; front right oblique, 30 \u00fe head position,\n30; right anterior oblique, 30 \u00fe foot pos-\nition, 30; and other body positions.\nData collection and blood biochemistry\nData regarding smoking, alcohol consump-\ntion, hypertension, and diabetes were col-\nlected from all patients. Height, weight, and\nbody mass index (BMI) were measured.\nVenous blood (10 ml) was collected prior\nto coronary angiography. Blood samples\nwere allowed to stand at room temperature\nfor 30 min to allow clotting, then serum was\nimmediately collected and analysed for the\nfollowing parameters: serum total bilirubin,\ntotal cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL choles-\nterol (LDL-C), HDL cholesterol (HDL-C),\nlipoprotein(a), apolipoprotein A1, apolipo-\nprotein B, C-reactive protein (CRP), and\nfibrinogen were determined. Biochemistry\nanalyses were performed using a\nMODULAR P-800 autoanalyser and asso-\nciated reagents (Roche Diagnostics, Basel,\nSwitzerland) according to the manufac-\nturer's instructions.\nLp-PLA2 measurement\nPrior to coronary angiography (and within\n24 h of symptom onset), a 2-ml venous blood\nsample was drawn from each patient into a\ntube containing 1.8 mg/ml ethylenediamine-\ntetra-acetic acid, and stored at 4C. Within\n24 h of collection, blood samples were\nthen plasma was collected and stored at \u00ad\n80C. Plasma Lp-PLA2 concentration was\nmeasured using an enzyme-linked immuno-\nsorbent assay (ELISA) kit (Tianjin\nKangerke Bioscience, Tianjin, China)\naccording to the manufacturer's instruc-\ntions. ELISA results were measured using\nan iMarkTM Microplate Absorbance Reader\n(Bio-Rad, CA, USA).\nStatistical analyses\nKolmogorov\u00adSmirnov test was used to ana-\nlyse data normality.

Long-term intensive ther-\napy with statins decreases Lp-PLA2 concen-\ntration in addition to LDL-C levels, and\nchange in Lp-PLA2 has been correlated with\nchange in LDL-C.32\u00ad34 These studies suggest\nthat Lp-PLA2 plays an active role in the\npathogenesis of atherosclerosis and CHD.\nVulnerable plaques are associated with\nLp-PLA2, and higher Lp-PLA2 concentra-\ntion is associated with more severe athero-\nsclerosis, higher cardiovascular risk, and\nmore vulnerable plaques.35 By measuring\nactivity of Lp-PLA2 and lysophosphatidyl-\ncholine in the left main coronary artery and\ncoronary sinus,36 the role of Lp-PLA2 in\nlocal vascular inflammation and early ath-\nerosclerosis has been demonstrated; patients\nwith CHD were found to have higher Lp-\nPLA2 activity and lysophosphatidylcholine\nlevels than controls. Lp-PLA2 is likely to be\nan inflammatory biomarker in coronary\narteries, and probably has an effect on\nTable 2.

Specifically,\ntwo studies have indicated that Lp-PLA2\ncould be cardioprotective because it hydro-\nlyses platelet-activating factor and oxidized\naddition, a recent phase III trial using an\nLp-PLA2 inhibitor reported no benefit in\npatients in terms of secondary prevention.40\nA Japanese study showed that Lp-PLA2\nactivity was associated with carotid plaques,\nbut a Mendelian randomization analysis\nsuggested that Lp-PLA2 was not a causative\nfactor for atherosclerosis.41 In the pre-\nsent study, and in accordance with other\nconcentration was independently associated\nwith CHD.\nThe present study results may be limited\nby the following factors. The sample size\nwas relatively small and all patients were\nfrom a single centre. In addition, the cross-\nsectional study design did not allow for\ndetermining a cause-and-effect relationship.\nThe observational nature of the study and\na number of uncontrolled factors could\nhave influenced the results. Therapeutic\ndrugs and natural supplements could also\nhave influenced the associations being\nobserved; unfortunately, data regarding\npatient medication and supplements were\nunavailable, due to the retrospective nature\nof the study. Finally, despite presenting\nwith normal coronary angiography, the\ncontrol patients had a medical condition\nthat prompted the need for coronary angi-\nography, which may have biased the\nresults.\nFigure 1.
