Moreover, ACE has two catalytic domains: NH2 (N) and COOH (C) with\ndistinct functions, and their activity has been found to be modulated by ACE polymorphism. The aim of the present study\nis to investigate the effects of the interaction between aerobic exercise training (AET) and ACE I/D polymorphism on\nACE N- and C-domain activities and vascular reactivity in humans.\nMaterials and methods: A total of 315 pre-selected healthy males were genotyped for II, ID and DD genotypes. Fifty\ncompleted the full AET (II, n = 12; ID, n = 25; and DD, n = 13), performed in three 90-minute sessions weekly, in the\nfour-month exercise protocol. Pre- and post-training resting heart rate (HR), peak O2\nconsumption (VO2\npeak), mean\nblood pressure (MBP), forearm vascular conduction (FVC), total circulating ACE and C- and N-domain activities were\nassessed. One-way ANOVA and two-way repeated-measures ANOVA were used.\nResults: In pre-training, all variables were similar among the three genotypes. In post-training, a similar increase in FVC (35%)\nwas observed in the three genotypes. AET increased VO2\nand 48\u00b15 vs. 58\u00b12 ml/kg/min, respectively). Moreover, there were no changes in HR and MBP. The DD genotype was also\nassociated with greater ACE and C-domain activities at pre- and post-training when compared to II. AET decreased similarly\nthe total ACE and C-domain activities in all genotypes, while increasing the N-domain activity in the II and DD genotypes.\nHowever, interestingly, the measurements of N-domain activity after training indicate a greater activity than the other\ngenotypes. These results suggest that the vasodilation in response to AET may be associated with the decrease in total ACE\nand C-domain activities, regardless of genotype, and that the increase in N-domain activity is dependent on the DD genotype.\nConclusions: AET differentially affects the ACE C- and N-domain activities, and the N-domain activity is dependent on\nACE polymorphism.\nOriginal Article\n1School of Physical Education and Sport, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil\n2Heart Institute (Incor), Medical School, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil\n3University Nove de Julho, UNINOVE, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.\nMulticentric Program of Post-graduation in Physiological Sciences, Federal University of the Jequitinhonha and Mucuri Valleys, Diamantina, Minas\nGerais, Brazil\nPhysical Education Department, Federal University of Maranh\u00e3o (UFMA), S\u00e3o Luis, Brazil\nCorresponding author:\nEdilamar Menezes de Oliveira, School of Physical Education and Sport, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, Laboratory of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology of\nEmail: edilamar@usp.br\n2 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System\n",

These domains share 60% sequence iden-\ntity, except for 37amino acid residues at the C terminus.2\nIn spite of the high degree of homology, each domain pos-\nsesses a functional active site that differs in relation to sub-\nstrate and inhibitor specificities.3 For example, Ang I,\nsubstance P, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone and\nbradykinin are cleaved by both domains,4\u00ad7 but only the N\ndomain cleaves the tetrapeptide N-acetyl-seryl-aspartyl-\nlysyl-proline (Ac-SDKP),8 a negative regulator of\nhematopoiesis.\nACE activity varies widely among individuals and\ngenetic factors have been suggested to account for this\nvariability.9,10 It has been shown that the absence (dele-\ntion, D) rather than the presence (insertion, I) of a 287-\nbase pair (bp) Alu repeat sequence within intron 16 of the\nACE gene is associated with greater levels and activity of\nthis enzyme. Recently, it has also been demonstrated that\nACE I/D polymorphism affects ACE domains' activities,\nand in II individuals ACE C- and N-domain activities\nwere significantly lower when compared both to ID and\nDD.11 These findings suggest that ACE I/D polymor-\nphism affects total ACE as well as ACE N- and C-domain\nactivities.\nThis genetic variant was also associated with athletic\nperformance, with the I allele being associated with endur-\nance-related events and the D allele with strength-related\ngated the effects of a long-term aerobic training protocol in\ncirculating ACE N- and C-domain activities. If a genetic\nvariant related to lower ACE activity is associated with\nathletic performance, it is possible that aerobic exercise\ntraining (AET) may affect/drive ACE activity toward\nlower activity levels.9,10 Studies have indicated that shear-\nstress affects ACE activity transiently,16 and its own down-\nregulation may be explained by increased shear stress with\nexercise-induced hyperemia. Furthermore, as the ACE\ndomains have different substrate and inhibitor specificities\nand since the ACE I/D polymorphism affects the domains'\nactivities, it is possible that AET and ACE I/D polymor-\nphism interaction may differently influence ACE domains'\nactivities.\nTherefore, the aim of the present study is to investigate\nthe interaction between ACE I/D polymorphism and AET\non total ACE and ACE C- and N-domain activities, as well\nas on the forearm blood flow (FBF) and conductance.\nMethods and materials\nThe participants completed all evaluations at pre- and\npost-four months of AET intervention.\nStudy population\nA total of 315 pre-selected healthy male Brazilian police-\nmen recruits were invited to participate in the study. They\nwere genotyped for the ACE gene polymorphism. Fifty\nrecruits completed the full training protocol. To avoid gen-\nder, age, and disease confounding in our study, the eligibil-\nity for taking part in the study was determined by sex (only\nmales), healthy status (no known history of medical condi-\ntions), tobacco consumption (nonsmokers only) and age\n(between 19 and 36 years). The individuals were screened\nfor cardiovascular, endocrine, and metabolic disorders.\nThey had no apparent cardiovascular disease. Clinical\nexamination, laboratory testing, and cardiopulmonary\nexercise test determined their health status. The Ethics\nCommittee for the Protection of the Human Subject of the\nHeart Institute (InCor) and the Clinical Hospital of the\nUniversity of S\u00e3o Paulo, the Faculty of Medicine, approved\nthe study protocol. The research was conducted in accord-\nance with the World Medical Association's 2008\nDeclaration of Helsinki. Individuals included in the study\ntook no medication for at least three months prior to study\nenrollment, and abstained from caffeine and alcohol one\nday before study measurements.17\nACE gene polymorphism\nThe ACE gene I/D polymorphism were determined by\nmeans of a three-primer system.18 Quality control for these\nassays was assessed by randomly selecting 50 samples to\nbe re-genotyped by three independent technicians.\nGenomic DNA was obtained from whole blood following\na standard salting-out protocol.19 Genotyping was con-\nducted following previous work.\nAssessment of the ACE gene polymorphism genotype.Five-\nmilliliter blood samples were drawn into tubes containing\nethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. The ACE I/D polymorphism\nAlves et al. 3\nwas determined using a three-primer system,19 which mini-\nmizes the mistyping20 that can occur with a two-primer sys-\ntem. Polymerase chain reaction products were visualized by\nelectrophoresis on 3% agarose gel with ethidium bromide and\nstored in digital form.\nSerum ACE activity\nA fasting 10 ml blood sample was obtained from a superfi-\ncial forearm vein. The blood was collected without antico-\nagulant, kept on ice, rapidly centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10\nminutes and frozen after each group of data collection.\nSerum samples were stored at -80oC and used a single\ncycle of freeze-thaw before analysis for assaying ACE\nactivity.20 The total storage of the samples was maintained\nat -80oC between the total collection and analysis of sam-\nples.ACE activity was assayed in serum using fluorescence\nresonance energy transfer substrates containing ortho-\naminobenzoic (Abz) and dinitrophenyl (Dnp) as fluores-\ncence donor/acceptor pair, namely Abz-FRK(Dnp)P-OH\nfor total ACE activity, Abz-SDK(Dnp)P-OH for the\nN-domain activity and Abz-LFK(Dnp)P-OH for the\nC-domain activity derivatives as substrates by continuously\nmeasuring the fluorescence.21,22 The assays were performed\nin a 96-well plate and 5 \u00b5l plasma was incubated with 10\n\u00b5M of appropriate substrate at 37\u00baC in 0.1 M Tris-HCl\nin a\nfinal volume of 200 \u00b5l. Fluorescence increments along the\nnm excitation.\nThe hydrolysis rate of the intramolecularly quenched\nfluorogenic substrates were incubated with aliquots of\nserum for 60 minutes to obtain total ACE enzymatic activ-\nity, and for 90 minutes to obtain enzymatic activity of the N\nand C domains. The slope was converted into nmol sub-\nstrate hydrolyzed per minute based on a calibration curve\nobtained by complete hydrolysis of the peptide as reported\npreviously.23 ACE activity is reported as UF.min\u00ad1.ml\u00ad1\n(1 UF = nmol ofAbz-FRK(Dnp)P-OH hydrolyzed per min-\nute). Measurements were made in triplicate with differ-\nences accounting for less than 5%.\nMaximal cardiopulmonary exercise test\nMaximal exercise capacity was determined during a maxi-\nmal progressive exercise test on a treadmill (Quinton\nInstruments Company, Seattle, WA, USA), with workload\nincrements of one metabolic equivalent (MET) every min-\nute until exhaustion. A breath-by-breath gas exchange ana-\nlyzer (Vmax 29, Sensor Medics, Buena Vista, CA, USA)\nwas used to measure VO2\nand carbon dioxide production.\nwas defined as the maximum attained VO2\nat the\nend of the exercise period at which the individual could no\nlonger maintain running exercise. This method is consid-\nered the gold standard for assessing patients' exercise\ncapacity. Ventilatory threshold was determined as occur-\nring at the breakpoint between the increase in the carbon\ndioxide production and VO2\n(V-slope) or the point at which\nthe ventilatory equivalent for oxygen and end-tidal oxygen\npartial pressure curves reached their respective minimum\nvalues and began to rise. Respiratory compensation was\ndetermined to occur at the point at which the ventilatory\nequivalent for carbon dioxide was lowest before a system-\natic increase and when end-tidal carbon dioxide partial\npressure reached a maximum and began to decrease. The\nreproducibility of the peak VO2\nmeasured at a different\ntime interval in the same individual expressed as ml/kg/\nmin in our laboratory is r = 0.95. Heart rate (HR) was con-\ntinuously monitored by electrocardiography (ECG), and\nBP was measured by sphygmomanometry. This test was\nHandgrip exercise\nAfter the maximal voluntary contraction (MVC, average\nof three trials) was obtained, handgrip isometric exercise\nwas performed at 30% of MVC for three minutes with the\ndominant arm, using a handgrip dynamometer (Stoelting,\nWood Dale, IL, USA). Individuals were instructed to\nbreathe normally during exercise and to avoid inadvertent\nperformance of a valsalva maneuver.\nMeasurements during the handgrip exercise\nBP and HR. During the handgrip exercise, BP was moni-\ntored noninvasively and intermittently with the use of an\nautomatic oscillometric cuff (Dixtal DX 2710, Dixtal Bio-\nm\u00e9dica, Manaus, AM, Brazil) placed on the ankle with\ncuff width adjusted to ankle circumference. HR was moni-\ntored continuously through lead II of the ECG.17\nFBF. FBF was measured by venous occlusion plethysmog-\nraphy.25 The nondominant arm was elevated above heart\nlevel to ensure adequate venous drainage. A mercury-filled\nsilastic tube attached to a low-pressure transducer was\nplaced around the forearm and connected to a plethysmo-\ngraph (Hokanson, Bellevue, WA, USA). Sphygmomanom-\neter cuffs were placed around the wrist and upper arm. At\n15-second intervals, the upper cuff was inflated above\nvenous pressure for seven to eight seconds. The cuff\naround the wrist was maintained continuously inflated\nduring the entire experimental protocol at a supra-systolic\npressure (240 mmHg) to prevent the passage of blood flow\ninto the hand. The increase in tension on the silastic tube\nreflected the volume of the forearm and hence its vasodila-\ntion. FBF (ml/min/100 ml tissue) was determined on the\nbasis of a minimum of four separate readings. The record\nof the flow wave was recorded on a computer and ana-\nlyzed using specific software (WinDaq Software, Dataq\nInstruments Inc, Akron, OH, USA).\nForearm vascular conductance (FVC).FVC was calculated by\ndividing FBF by the mean arterial pressure. In our laboratory,\n4 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System\nthe reproducibility of FBF measured at different time inter-\nvals in the same individual, expressed as milliliters per min-\nute per 100 ml tissue, had a correlation coefficient of 0.93.\nHandgrip experimental protocol\nThe handgrip evaluation protocol occurred between 07:00\nand 10:00 a.m. with the patients in a supine position in a\nquiet, air-conditioned room (21\u00ad22\u00baC). Patients were\ninstructed to sleep at least seven hours, to not participate in\nphysical exercise for 24 hours prior to the study, and to\nconsume a light meal without caffeine before participating\nin the protocol. The participants were positioned, and ECG\nleads were placed on the chest. Cuffs for FBF measure-\nment were placed on the nondominant arm and a cuff for\nBP measurement was placed on the ankle. After a 15-min-\nute rest period baseline values for FBF, BP and HR were\nrecorded for three minutes. Moderate static handgrip exer-\ncise at 30% of MVC was then performed for three minutes,\nfollowed by a recovery period of three minutes.20 FBF, BP\nand HR were recorded continuously during the handgrip\nexercise. Mean BP (MBP) was measured every minute,\nand FBF was measured every 15 seconds. All studies were\nperformed in a temperature-controlled (21\u00b0C) room,\nAET protocol\nIndividuals underwent AET for 65\u00ad90 minutes, three ses-\nsions weekly, during four months supervised by an exer-\ncise specialist. Exercise intensity was individually graded\nbetween aerobic/anaerobic thresholds according to HR\nobtained during baseline maximal cardiopulmonary exer-\ncise testing. The training protocol consisted of two months\nof moderate intensity (aerobic threshold) followed by two\nmonths of high-intensity (anaerobic threshold) AET.26\nAET sessions consisted of five minutes of warm-up, fol-\nlowed by 60 minutes of jogging or running. In the first two\nmonths they also performed 25 minutes of local strength-\nening exercises (sit-ups, push-ups, and pull-ups).20\nStrengthening exercises had the purpose of protecting the\nmuscles and joints. Thus, this increased strength gave\nthese individuals the capacity to achieve the prescribed\nprotocol at the end of four months.\nStatistical analysis\nData are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM. The calculation for the\nsample size was determined according to a previous study\nwith a similar population of healthy men in an investiga-\ntion of the polymorphism of allele T at promoter region of\nthe endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) gene.24 The\nKolmogorov\u00adSmirnov test was used to assess the normal-\nity of distribution of each variable studied. Baseline analy-\nses were subjected to one-way analysis of variance\n(ANOVA). In the post-training period, total ACE and\nC- and N-domain activities, cardiopulmonary analyses,\nFBF and FVC were subjected to two-way ANOVA with\nrepeated measures. When significance was found,\nScheff\u00e9's post hoc comparisons were performed.\nProbability values of p  0.05 were considered statistically\nsignificant. The FBF and FVC data were expressed as area\nunder the curve (AUC).20 Inter-assay percentage coeffi-\ncients of variability were considered acceptable for <15%\nand intra-assay percentage coefficients of variability were\nconsidered acceptable for <10%.

Overall, the\nresults showed that in the pre- and post-training period the\ntotal ACE and C-domain activities were lower in II than\nDD genotypes; moreover, AET decreased similarly to the\ntotal circulating ACE and ACE C-terminal domain activi-\nties in all genotypes, while ACE N-terminal domain activ-\nity was increased in the DD group. When analyzed\nseparately the II, ID and DD genotypes showed a reduction\nin total ACE and ACE C-terminal domain activities after\nAET; it decreased similarly to the total ACE and C-domain\nactivitiesinallgenotypeswhereasitincreasedtheN-domain\nactivity in the II and DD genotypes. However, interestingly,\nthe measurements for N-domain activity in the DD geno-\ntype at post-training were greater than the other genotypes.\nThese results show that AET regulates total ACE and ACE\nC- and N-terminal domain activities and is dependent on\nthe ACE I/D polymorphism.\nMany studies have shown that the ACE I/D polymor-\nphism is associated with endurance-related events.9,10 The\npresence of the I allele is associated with lower serum and\ntissue ACE activity and improved performance in endur-\nance sports,12 while the D allele is associated with higher\ncirculating and tissue ACE activity and enhanced perfor-\nmance at sports that require sprinting or short bursts of\npower.27 As a genotype related to decreased ACE activity\nis associated with endurance performance, our initial\nhypothesis was that the AET would decrease total ACE\nactivity, and our results confirm this hypothesis. To the\nbest of our knowledge, this is the first study to describe the\neffects of a period of AET on circulating ACE activity in\nhumans.\nACE hydrolyses peptides by the removal of a dipeptide\nfrom the C-terminus, as in the conversion of Ang I to Ang\nII, a potent vasoconstrictor and degrader of bradykinin.28\nTherefore, the reduction in ACE activity, as observed after\nthe AET protocol, might allow for higher blood flow and\nvascular conductance, which would be beneficial during\nexercise.20 Our results show that FBF and FVC were\nincreased after the AET protocol, a result that is consistent\nwith the reduction in ACE activity. Furthermore, we evalu-\nated the effects of the AET protocol on ACE C- and\nN-terminal domains. Interestingly, in the pre-training\nperiod total ACE and ACE C-domain activities were lower\nin II than DD genotypes. In order to draw a clearer picture\nof the functional consequences of these differences, we\nevaluated FBF before and after the AET protocol and\nobserved a similar increase in all genotypes. These results\nsuggest that FBF after exercise training is associated with a\nreduction in ACE C-terminal domain activity, but is inde-\npendent of ACE N-terminal domain activity. Van Ginkel\net al. showed that individuals with the ACE-II polymor-\nphism had significantly larger recruitment of the relative\ncapillaries after exercise compared to people with ACE-ID/\nDD, showing a relationship between ACE genotype and\nFigure 2.

AUC: area under the curve.\nAlves et al. 7\nblood flow.15 In line with this, some studies have demon-\nstrated that ACE affects its own regulation in response to\nshear stress and suggest that the ACE extracellular domain\nbehaves as a mechanosensor while the cytoplasmic domain\nelicits downstream intracellular signaling by phosphoryla-\ncause a downregulation of the ACE C-terminal activity\nprobably because shear stress affects ACE activity tran-\nsiently, and its own downregulation could be explained by\nincreased shear stress with exercise-induced hyperemia.\nThus, the decrease of ACE signaling by shear stress might\nalso contribute to reducingAng II formation and accumula-\ntion of bradykinin and all its consequences on higher blood\nflow and vascular conductance. Corroborating, we previ-\nously showed decreased ACE activity and increased vascu-\nlar reactivity in response to exercise training modulated by\nthe +9/\u00ad9 bradykinin B2 receptor gene functional polymor-\nphism, the main peptide degradable by ACE.19\nWe are unaware of previous studies that assessed the\ninteraction between ACE I/D polymorphism and AET on\nACE domain activities. Our results show that although the\ndecrease inACE C-terminal domain activity is dependent on\nthe ACE I/D polymorphism, ACE N-terminal domain is\nincreased only in individuals harboring the DD genotype. It\nis known that the ACE N-terminal domain is able to cleave\nand inactivate the negative hemoregulator Ac-SDKP 50\ntimes faster than the ACE C-terminal domain, making this\ntetrapeptide a natural substrate for the ACE N-terminal\ndomain.8 Ac-SDKP is found in the bone marrow and in the\nperipheral circulation and reversibly prevents the recruit-\nment of pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells into the S-phase\nof the cellular cycle by maintaining them in the G0 phase.29,30\nTherefore, by acting on Ac-SDKP, the ACE N-terminal\ndomain plays an important role on the stimulation of hemat-\nopoiesis. As AET stimulates the production of red blood\ncells,31 it is possible that hematopoiesis was increased in par-\nticipants with the DD polymorphism. Unfortunately, we did\nnot assess hematopoiesis in the present study, which would\nhave been useful in clarifying the functional consequences of\nincreased ACE N-terminal in the DD genotype.32\nThe decrease in ACE C-terminal domain activity and\nthe increase in ACE N-terminal domain activity are both\nbeneficial in the context of AET adaptations, once these\nchanges promote improvements in blood flow/conduct-\nance and red blood cell proliferation, respectively, and\nthese aid performance improvement.33,34 Most medical\napplications have involved so far the regulation of ACE\nactivity in the control of hypertension35 and for prophylac-\ntic treatment of heart disease control.34 Therefore, it is pos-\nsible thatAET can help to improve blood flow and vascular\nconductance, which would be advantageous for those who\npractice AET.\nFigure 3.

First is the lack of a\ncontrol group with which to compare the changes observed\nin the experimental group. Therefore, it is not clear whether\nthe changes observed are due to changes over time or due\nto AET. We studied only young males who were not com-\npletely sedentary because they are on-duty police officers.\nThus, we cannot rule on the results for the population in\ngeneral, mostly women and older and completely seden-\ntary individuals. Moreover, there was a lack of assessment\nof the changes in body composition and the nutritional sta-\ntus of the participants during the four months of training\nprogram that may have interfered in the effect of exercise\ntraining on ACE activity and its association with vascular\nreactivity. Since we studied police officers, however, shar-\ning similar meals during the evaluations, we do not think\nthat this particular issue could have affected our results. In\naddition, we finished with only 50 men who adhered to the\nAET. But we have in our favor that we had all measure-\nments for all 50 study participants. In this context, future\nstudies in broad aspects of an overall population are\nneeded, aiming especially at investigating the mechanisms\nthat affect the ACE I/D polymorphism and AET on ACE\ndomain activities.\nIn conclusion, in the present study we showed for the\nfirst time that ACE C- and N-terminal domain activities\ncan be modulated by AET in interaction with the ACE I/D\npolymorphism.\n"
