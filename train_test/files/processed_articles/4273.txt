While the risk is greatest in peo-\nple with a history of injection drug use (National Centre for\nHIV Epidemiological and Clinical Research, 2010), history\nof imprisonment has long been independently associated\n1997). HCV transmission has proven to be difficult to study\nin prison populations, primarily due to rapid population\nturnover, but rates are thought to be high relative to the gen-\neral community (Miller, Bi, & Ryan, 2009) and direct evi-\ndence of transmission within Australian prisons has been\nIn 1993, the World Health Organization (WHO) published\nguidelines on the management of HIV in prisons (WHO\nGlobal Programme on AIDS, 1993). A major principle of the\ndocument was to provide prisoners with the same standard of\nhealth care (including access to preventive resources such as\ncondoms, bleach, and sterile injecting equipment) available\nto the communities from which the prisoners were sourced.\nWhile focused on HIV, the guidelines are applicable to HCV\nas has been reflected in subsequent WHO documents (WHO,\n2007; WHO and Joint United Nation Programme on AIDS,\n2006). Evaluations of the extent to which the international\nguidelines have been adopted over the ensuing two decades,\nhowever, have yielded disappointing results--particularly\nwith respect to the provision of syringes and bleach (Bollini,\nLaporte, & Harding, 2002). This is despite strong evidence\nfrom around the world for the effectiveness of needle and\nsyringe programs in the community (Commonwealth\nDepartment of Health and Ageing, 2002) and their successful\nimplementation in a growing number of prisons in\nSwitzerland, Germany, Romania, Belgium, Scotland, and\nelsewhere (Chu & Elliott, 2009). Although many of the rea-\nsons for this are related to legislative and administrative\nrestrictions, a number of authors have also described a lack of\nacceptance among prison officers and other correctional staff\nto the introduction of particular harm reduction strategies\nproposals for new harm reduction strategies within prisons,\nincluding access to clean injecting equipment, have also been\nmet with various levels of resistance from prison staff (Dolan,\n2001). Efforts to understand the attitudes and beliefs of prison\nstaff could promote a more collaborative approach to intro-\nducing effective strategies in the future (Gollop et al., 2004;\noners was conducted in the South Australian (SA) system.\n1University of Adelaide, Australia\n2Deakin University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia\nCorresponding Author:\nEmma R.

Miller1, Jan M. Moore2 and Peng Bi1\n Keywords\nprison studies, health communication, correctional institutions, policies, alcohol, drugs, tobacco\n2 SAGE Open\nThis study (Miller et al. 2009) estimated an overall HCV\nseroprevalence in prison entrants of around 42%--similar to\nthe 37% to 58% reported by studies in other Australian pris-\nons (Butler, Boonwaat, & Hailstone, 2005; Butler et al.,\nThe study confirmed that those already infected with HCV at\nprison entry were significantly more likely to continue inject-\ning while incarcerated. It was concluded that the few needles\nin circulation in the prison were almost certainly contami-\nnated with HCV and represent an unacceptable risk for sus-\nceptible prisoners and prison staff. With the exception of an\nestablished opioid replacement program (Cowie & Alberti,\n2001), no practical preventive resources aimed at reducing\nthe harms associated with injecting have been provided to\nSA prisoners to date.\nDuring this study, prison officers and health staff working\nin the SA prison system took part in small group interviews\nand a focus group. The rationale for the interviews was to\nassist in the development of recommendations for harm\nreduction strategies that would be acceptable to those respon-\nsible for implementing them. In this article, we explore their\nperceptions and views about hepatitis C and a range of harm\nreduction strategies to identify future directions for minimiz-\ning transmission risks within prison. In addition to ethical\napprovals obtained for the original project (Miller et al.,\n2009), this secondary analysis was specifically approved by\nthe SA Department of Health Human Research Ethics\nCommittee and the Deakin University Human Research\nEthics Committee.\nMethod\nIn late 2005, three small group interviews with correctional\nofficers and one focus group with prison health staff were\nheld at two metropolitan prisons in Adelaide. The included\nparticipants were 18 years of age or older, employed in the\nprison system at the time of the interview, and actively work-\ning as in the SA prison system during the period of the larger\nstudy in which this research arm was embedded.\nIn each semistructured interview, participants were\ninvited to talk about the importance of HCV as a workplace\nissue for them and the adequacy of any infection control\nmeasures then in place. They were then provided with a brief\ntext paragraph summarizing statistics on the prevalence of\nHCV in SA prisons, and asked whether that information\nchanged their assessment of HCV as a priority issue.\nFollowing this, participants were invited to raise any issues\nof interest in relation to communicable disease in general,\nbefore being canvassed for their views on a range of specific\nprevention strategies, including increasing education, bleach\nprovision, clean needle provision--which have been among\nthe most commonly proposed strategies for prison systems\nPrison officer participants responded to posters and flyers\nthat were placed around the institutions by making contact\ndirectly with the researcher on-site. Nursing staff partici-\npants responded to invitations provided directly to them via\nnursing education workshops and through reminders at\nhandover meetings. Responders were provided with an infor-\nmation sheet and signed a consent form several days prior to\nthe interviews but no participants withdrew. All interviews\nwere held in private rooms on-site during work time, were\naudiotape recorded, and then transcribed verbatim at which\ntime the tapes were destroyed. Initially, some of the data\nwere descriptively analyzed and reported to the primary\nstakeholders (including the SA Prison Health Service, SA\nDepartment of Health, and SA Department for Correctional\nServices) along with the larger study findings, but they were\nnot comprehensively analyzed or published at that time.\nFurther analysis involved a recursive cycle of inductive\nand deductive reasoning that included descriptive coding, to\nhighlight emergent themes; determining a point of reference\nfor examining each theme to interpret key categories; a map-\nping exercise to illustrate and question the information\nemerging and to assess what we already know about the\ntopic; and interpreting and presenting findings (Daly, 2007).\nThe analysis was undertaken by a researcher who was not\ninvolved in the data collection and without previous experi-\nence in the context or the content area of the study. Although\npreviously held attitudes to prisoners, prison staff, and com-\nmunicable diseases would remain, it is likely that their\nimpact on the analytic process may not have been as great as\nthe potentially more strongly established attitudes held by\npersons with expert knowledge of the field.\nParticipants\nEight prison officers (two females and six males) and seven\nprison health service nurses (four females and three males)\nwere interviewed in their work time within the grounds of\ntwo high security metropolitan male-only prisons in\nAdelaide, SouthAustralia. One prison accommodated unsen-\ntenced prisoners and the other a mixture of sentenced and\nunsentenced prisoners. The eight prison officers took part in\none of three small group interviews (one group of two par-\nticipants, and two groups of three participants) and had lev-\nels of experience ranging from what might be described as\n`early career' to `veteran.' The seven nurses participated in a\nsingle focus group session that was held in a prison infir-\nmary. Their level of experience in prison health also ranged\nfrom relative newcomer to extensive.\nResults\nThe interviews covered three main discussion points and\nuncovered a number of associated issues: working in an\nenvironment with a high prevalence of HCV (including\nattitudes toward HCV, awareness of prisoner HCV status,\nand knowledge about HCV), existing strategies to mini-\nmize HCV transmission (including formal protocols and\nMiller et al. 3\nindividual protection), and specific staff responses to the\nproposed strategies.\nThe findings are presented according to the discussion\npoints and themes emerging from the analytical process,\nwith verbatim quotes provided to exemplify key points.\nInterpretive discussion is presented along with each theme\nand final implications are discussed separately.\nWorking in a High HCV Prevalence Environment\nRisk of transmission was the most dominant consideration in\nprison officer discussions of working in an environment with\nhigh background prevalence of HCV infection. Transmission\nrisk was also a major theme in nurse discussions and, for\nboth groups, all discussion was located within the discourse\nof personal risk rather than that of susceptible prisoners or\nother prison staff.\nAttitudes to HCV:The ever present threat. HCV was considered\nan important issue by prison officers and nursing staff. While\nboth groups indicated some understanding of the infection\nrisk, harm reduction activities initiated by officers were pri-\nmarily focused on the potential threat of prisoner-to-staff\ntransmission. No officers commented on the risk for prisoners,\nwith one officer explaining that prisoner safety was assumed\nto be the responsibility of health staff. Reinforced during their\ninitial training, officers considered all inmates to be infected\nand employed self-protective strategies to reduce disease\ntransmission. While not part of formal protocol, for example,\nofficers reported routinely wearing three or four pairs of\ngloves and protective goggles for cell inspections, when `pat-\nting down' prisoners (undertaking personal security searches)\nor when attending crisis situations involving blood expo-\nsure--such as self-harm incidents and altercations.\nYes, [you] assume that everybody, absolutely everybody has hep\nC, andAIDS and everything else . . . you just assume everybody's\ngot it.\nIt's more about precautions for ourselves than it is about concern\nfor prisoners, because I think, there is an assumption that the\nprisoner health services educates them . . . about that . . . my\nfocus isn't really on them it's more on universal precautions for\nourselves.\nAwareness of inmate HCV status: Knowing the enemy.The\nrequirement to maintain confidentiality necessarily restricts\nthe relaying of prisoner health information, yet the self-\ndefense approach of officers to HCV harm reduction was\nfurther reinforced by officers not feeling fully informed\nabout the infection status of prisoners. Some officers relied\non individual prisoners informing them of their status with\nrespect to blood-borne viruses, sometimes in a manner that\npotentially reinforced their fears, or legitimized their cau-\ntious approach:\nI've actually found prisoners are pretty upfront about it . . . [they\ntell us] \"you'd better watch yourself, I've got hep C\" . . .\nespecially on escorts when we're handcuffed to them . . . I've\nhad a couple of guys say \"you might want to put a towel there\"\nbecause I've got exposed arms . . . They're like \"you might want\nto put something between us because I've got hep C.\"\nConversely, others suggested they did receive informal\nadvice about prisoner serostatus from nursing staff--often\noccurring when they were present at prisoner entrant health\nassessments. For example, one officer stated:\nEvery time we do look up the inductions [admitting prisoners],\nit's hep C, hep C, hep C--the majority of them [have] hep C . . .\nThe nurses, when they [prisoners] come through . . . they just\nsort of say he's got . . . you know . . . we can be aware that\nthey've got it.\nThe seroconversion window is known to be long in HCV,\nwith the appearance of measurable antibodies in the blood\nbeing delayed for up to 6 months following exposure\ning HCV antibodies may remain after the viral infection has\nresolved (Pawlotsky, 2003). The risk posed by a given pris-\noner was determined by HCV antibody assay, the test offered\nto prisoners at entry. The possibility of infection (and there-\nfore transmission risk) in the absence of a positive antibody\ntest was not raised by either group, nor was the potential for\noverstating the transmission risk posed by prisoners a pro-\nportion of whom may have cleared the virus.\nKnowledge about HCV:The `known unknowns.'Although offi-\ncers took precautionary measures when working with prison-\ners (i.e., treating all situations as high risk situations), most\nwere unclear about the proportion of prisoners infected with\nHCV and the precise nature of the risk this posed. When pre-\nsented with recent HCV statistics collected from SA prisons,\nmany of the officers indicated their surprise that prevalence\nof HCV in prisoners was as high (40% of males and 66% of\nI didn't realise it was that high. I knew it was fairly high, but I\ndidn't think it would be that high.\nIt is a little bit surprising, exactly why are the females, especially\nwhen our prison population of females, not here at the [male\nonly prison] but . . . females are so low in our population stats, I\nmean I'm thinking, I'm surprised that they are a lot higher--I\nmean they are twenty percent higher.\nFor some, however, the information confirmed their impressions\nand served to reinforce their perceptions of risk. It doesn't\nsurprise me . . . So it doesn't surprise me that those numbers or\npercentages . . . because we, every time we do look up at the\ninductions, it's hep C, hep C, hep C--the majority of them hep\nC, that come through or infectious disease.\n4 SAGE Open\nWe all look at the case files and we actually get the prisoner list\nand we can see by the prisoners whose got contagious disease,\nso I actually knew it was going to be high.\nBecause we don't need it [the information]. Cause we assume\neveryone's got everything.\nNotably absent from officer interviews was discussion of\nthe implications for prisoner health and welfare despite the\nhigh prevalence of HCV in the prison setting. There was no\ndiscussion about the increased risk for susceptible (HCV\nnegative) prisoners.\nGiven their professional education and workplace setting,\nprison nurses were confident in their knowledge of HCV and\nother communicable disease. They stated they were not sur-\nprised by the provided statistics proposing around a 40-fold\nincrease of HCV in prison populations relative to the general\npopulation. They were also aware of the heightened trans-\nmission risk in the context of high background prevalence:\nWe've been aware of hep B and hep C for a long time now, so\nit's just been a further extension of the awareness threat we've\nalready had I guess.\nEveryone . . . [is] high risk . . . even if someone comes in and has\na negative screening that could change at any time during their\nstay here.\nWhile HCV was the main focus of this investigation,\nother communicable diseases were seen as a more important\nissue. Concern was expressed about a range of parasitical,\nfungal, and bacterial infections (including scabies and gas-\ntrointestinal infections) in prisoners--particularly the trans-\nmission risk posed to officers. The possibility of passing on\ninfluenza to family and friends was frequently raised.\nOfficers discussed recent changes to the hepatitis B and\ninfluenza vaccination entitlements for correctional staff,\nwhich were no longer offered routinely in the workplace.\nHepatitis B vaccinations were reimbursed by the Department,\nbut officers needed to arrange the three required vaccinations\nfrom their own general practitioners (GPs), which was seen\nas substantial barrier to complete vaccination:\nPeople don't have time to do that . . . we had a . . . system in\nplace before that was very effective . . . and the staff were\nactually, were very proactive with it. Now I would say that there\nare people who wouldn't even know where they are up with,\nwith their actual inoculation with hepatitis B.\nI mean . . . you know to me, it's almost like \"Well, we don't care\nabout you officers. Our main concern is the prisoners, but we\ndon't care about the people looking after the prisoners.\"\nOfficers expressed resentment about changes to the influ-\nenza vaccination schedule which meant that officers not\nmeeting priority vaccination criteria would have to contrib-\nute to their cost.\nWhy can't the officers get the influenza shots for free, or their\nhep B? Why do we have to pay for it? . . . We are just as\nvulnerable here for that. And . . . the other thing that's on all the\nofficer's minds at the moment is the bird flu. Now . . . are we\ngoing . . . to be inoculated for it? If prisoners are all going to get\nit, what about the officers? You know, these things are running\nacross our minds.\nWhile nurses did not express concern about communica-\nble diseases in general, the prison officers appeared to be\nhighly concerned about this issue, with many expressing\ntheir fears about contracting an infection of some type along\nwith what they perceived as limited education and insuffi-\ncient hand washing facilities for staff.\nThe provision of an alcohol-based hand gel was fre-\nquently proposed as a solution to a problem that appeared to\nrepresent a source of ongoing resentment:\nI also think around prison . . . there's a definite lack of hand\nwashing facilities . . . So you just end up, you just don't wash\nyour hands half the time. Whereas if it was there [hand gel], I\nknow damn well I'd wash my hands a lot more.\nHepatitis C is not really that contagious--it's blood-to-blood,\nright? So . . . I'm more concerned around here with other skin\ndiseases and things like that and I'd like to see . . . like all\nmedical sectors have that . . . like the gel.\nUpdate on training . . . I think that's a huge thing that we don't\nget here. And . . . some more, easy, convenient way of washing\nyour hands. So . . . that's always been an issue for me . . . go\ndownstairs and hold onto a stair rail and then you get to the\nbottom and think \"oh, how many hands have been on that rail,\"\nyou know?\nExisting Strategies to\nMinimize HCV Transmission\nPrison officers and nursing staff described a limited set of\nstrategies they used to minimize HCV transmission. In all\ncases, these were barrier strategies aimed at self-protection\nand no strategies for minimizing transmission among the\nprison population were nominated by either group.\nFormal Protocols and Individual\nProtection: Fear, Power, and Resentment\nOfficers were typically confident in the efficacy of the autho-\nrized and voluntary preventive measures routinely used as\npart of their operative duties, yet noted that occasionally the\nurgency of a situation increased their risk of exposure to\nHCV and other diseases. It was acknowledged that in such\ncases, officers were obliged to respond to the emergent situ-\nations with less caution:\nI think that we have the `blood protocol' in place and we all\nknow what we have to do. The only problem is we have . . .\nMiller et al. 5\ninstances where you don't have time to put the gloves on . . . I\nhad an instance where a guy came out of the cell from an unlock\n[formal time for unlocking cells] and he slashed up [cut himself\ndeliberately] whilst doing the unlock. He then took the blade and\nwent for his neck. Now I thought \"I'm not going to run away and\ngo and get gloves on so I can grab him\" . . . if he actually cuts the\nneck and blood spurts everywhere its . . . more danger anyway--\nso I literally grabbed him [without protective gloves].\nIn the event of such situations, prison officers might fol-\nlow the `blood protocol'set out to establish disease transmis-\nsion and serostatus. On exposure to blood or other bodily\nfluids, serology tests are immediately conducted and then\nfollowed up with further tests at 3-month intervals. As the\nprotocol is initiated on slightest suspicion, almost all of the\nofficers had some direct experience of the process and sug-\ngested that they were clear on procedure and held it in seri-\nous regard. As stated by the officer involved in the above\nincident:\nI did the blood protocol . . . I had the blood tests . . . and that was\nthat . . . it definitely put a different perspective on my sex life at\nhome.\nSome of the officers stated they felt unsupported in such\ncircumstances when experiencing anxiety associated with the\nprospect of being infected. The testing schedule takes 6 months\nto rule out transmission, leaving officers feeling `in limbo'\nbefore being `cleared,'as described by one officer:\nI had blood protocol . . . there was no counselling support . . . no\nintervention from management, no nothing. It was just \"well,\ntake time off, come back when you're ready.\" . . . I think to send\nsomebody away from work for a period of time and not provide\nthem with any support in the meantime, then all you're going to\ndo is go home and think about it.\nNursing staff were also cautious when treating and screen-\ning prisoners, and discussed their strict adherence to `univer-\nsal' precautions (the guidelines also known as `standard'\nprecautions) as the main strategy used to reduce the possibil-\nity of HCV transmission.\nWell it's [universal precautions] something . . . that's drummed\ninto you at training, you know, from day \"dot\" really.\nThe previous statement suggests early legitimizing of their\nsubsequent concerns and fears. Similar to prison officers,\nnurses focused their discussion about HCV transmission on\nself-protection, with no reference to harm reduction princi-\nples in relation to prisoner welfare. There did not seem to be\na sense of coordinated effort in regard to prison-wide infec-\ntion control, as the following conversation highlights:\nWe don't know what happens [with laundry stained with bodily\nfluids].\nWe've got those big blue bags haven't we?\nThe yellow ones, yes. Anything with blood or anything like that\nis bagged into a yellow bag automatically . . . they dissolve in\nthe laundry, so the guys over there don't have to touch it.\nYeah, I'm not familiar with what they do . . . only our side.\nAll SA prisoners were required to undertake a health\nassessment on entry to prison at the time of the study. The\nassessment, which was predominantly conducted by nursing\nstaff, was designed to identify most physical and mental\nhealth problems (as well as drug dependency) and included\nreferral to the prison opioid replacement program where\nindicated. During the assessment, nurses provided informa-\ntion pertaining to HCV and other blood-borne viruses, high-\nlighting the heightened risk of HCV in the prison setting and\nproviding information on minimizing transmission risks.\nThis essentially consisted of advising prisoners not to inject\nwhile in prison. Nursing staff suggested, however, that the\nimportance of any information provided at this time was\nlikely to be overlooked by prison entrants given the compet-\ning priorities of the admissions process and the emotional\ntrauma associated with being newly incarcerated. As one\nnurse commented:\nFrom the moment they hit the place they're actually being\nconfronted with information. But, sadly, that's not the best time,\nbecause they're stressed, they're frightened . . . sometimes\nthey're just too concerned with their drug withdrawals at that\nstage to listen to anything you're saying anyway.\nDespite the high HCV prevalence in their working setting,\nthe nurses provided little insight about their knowledge of,\nand practice related to, HCV-infected prisoners. Neither did\nthey comment on strategies used to reduce transmission of\nHCV among prisoners other than the information they pro-\nvided at entry. Prison officers and nurses did not appear to\nregard each other as theoretical `co-workers' in relation to\nprisoner management. They did, however, appear to share a\nsimilar sense of detachment from prisoner welfare in relation\nto HCV.\nResponse to Proposed Harm Reduction Strategies\nDiscussion on the proposed harm reduction strategies\nfocused entirely on their impact on officers rather than the\nbroader aim of reducing HCV transmission in prisons. In all\ncases, the strategies were considered in terms of the risk they\nmight pose to officers (including loss of power and control)\nweighted against the privilege they might represent for\nprisoners.\nOverwhelmingly, the officers expressed a feeling of\nbeing threatened by any action that would provide prisoners\nwith an opportunity to challenge the hierarchical structure\n6 SAGE Open\nwithin the prison setting. Once more, there was little consid-\neration about broader harm reduction aims which might pro-\nvide prisoners with an environment that demonstrated\nwelfare concerns for their physical, emotional, and mental\nhealth.\nDespite their level of education and attainment of compe-\ntencies required for professional practice, nurses did not\nrefer to their `duty of care' toward prisoners or to the human\nrights of prisoners through ethical practice (Fry, 2007). In\nthis sense, there was little to separate the dialogue of nurses\nand prison officers.\nStrategy 1: Bleach provision.The provision of household\nbleach to prisoners to clean syringes and other injecting\nparaphernalia has been introduced in a number of prisons\nin the world, with no documented safety issues so far aris-\ning (J\u00fcrgens, Ball, & Verster, 2009). The idea of making\nbleach available in SA prisons, however, was not received\nfavorably by prison officers. Officers perceived bleach as\na potential weapon that could provide inmates with an\nadvantage in the prison environment. The key concern lay\nwith the potential transfer of power from officers to prison-\ners, by means of presenting various opportunities for\nexploiting the intended uses for the chemical. Providing\nbleach to help reduce HCV transmission left officers feel-\ning compromised:\nI don't particularly like the idea of giving them any sort of\nchemical. Bleach is a pretty strong chemical . . . I don't want to\nwear it in the face. Anything you give to prisoners can become a\nweapon.\nThe odour of bleach will actually mask so many other things . . .\nI think it would be very detrimental to the whole environment\nhere in prison.\nThe potential benefits of the strategy for minimizing hep-\natitis C transmission were not explored. Proposing provision\nof bleach to prisoners, despite the aim of the strategy, could\nbe rejected on the grounds that it was against the rules--\nwhich seemed to underscore the apparently inherent legiti-\nmacy of the current position:\nOne of the substances is bleach, they can't have because it's not\nallowed.\nIt still would not be allowed even then because of the chance\nthat it can be used against the officers.\nNurses also viewed bleaching agents negatively, suggest-\ning that chemicals had the potential to be misused by the\ninmates to gain power:\nI think they would be more likely to use bleach as a weapon . . .\nThey can use it as a weapon . . . throw it in the eyes.\nStrategy 2: Safe tattooing programs. In an inquiry into HCV-\nrelated discrimination in New South Wales (NSW), the\nNSW Anti-Discrimination Board (2004) specifically rec-\nommended that the means for sterile tattoo application be\nprovided to prisoners. This could be accomplished by\nallowing visits from commercial tattooists, or by providing\nadequate infection control education to prisoners and sup-\nplying single-use ink ampoules and access to autoclaves. In\ndescribing a successful pilot for a safe tattooing scheme in\na Canadian prison, Levy et al. (2007) stated that, in addition\nto improved infection control, the program benefits\nincluded \"better control of tattooing equipment and\nenhanced education opportunities for both inmates and\nstaff.\" Neither commercial tattooing sessions nor training\nof prisoners was supported by prison officers. These strate-\ngies represented a test of power relations within a context\nof almost universal feelings of being undervalued within\ntheir workplace and by the broader society (as exemplified\nin the first of the following quotes):\nAnd I think if . . . you speak to anyone out of our unit . . . you'll\nfind . . . that you have, at the same time as you have police,\nteachers, people who are always getting pay rises . . . when it\ncame to us no one wants to know us.\nWe subsidise their drugs, we subsidise their living . . . Tattooing\nis a recreational thing--why should we subsidise, why should\nwe? They're in jail for what they do to society.\nIt just seems . . . they want, want, want and we give, give, give.\nThere's no stopping it.\nThis strategy was again interpreted as presenting opportu-\nnities for abuse and providing prisoners with weapons to\ngain power over the prison staff. The resentment also\nextended to the proposition of providing training opportuni-\nties for prisoners and allowing them to apply tattoos to other\ninmates. Officers strongly opposed the provision of any pris-\noner `liberties,' as this strategy was widely perceived.\nYou'll generally find the Department's easier to say \"Yes\" and\n\"let's show them how to do it,\" right? Because that's the easy\nway around, instead of saying \"no, this is not acceptable\nbehaviour.\" So instead of rewarding by giving and encouraging\nit, do their bloody job and say \"no.\"\nThe training of prisoners to improve vocational skills and\ndevelopment was also not accepted by the nursing staff who\nperceived a greater risk to other inmates through being tat-\ntooed by unskilled and (potentially) unsupervised trainee tat-\ntooists. Nurses did not draw on prisoner privilege as a reason\nfor dismissing this strategy, presenting here a point of differ-\nence in attitude to prison officers. Overall, the notion of hav-\ning prisoners conducting tattooing was principally rejected\non the basis of increased risk for skin infection:\nMiller et al. 7\nIt's the scabbing up afterwards . . . infection, you know, all sorts\nof problems.\nThe strategy of providing subsidized commercial tattooing\nwas summarily dismissed by nurses for the same reasons.\nWe're trying to discourage them, as before, because of the\nongoing care of them, so . . .\nI think what we said before, that's the same thing.\nStrategy 3: Safe injecting programs. Prison officers strongly\nrejected any provision of needles and syringes, whether on\nrequest, as part of an exchange program or through the\nestablishment of a safe injecting room. Again, the officers\nidentified concerns regarding inmate privileges and wide-\nspread concerns about providing prisoners with potential\nweapons. Discussion of this strategy highlighted officer\nfears of being undermined by inmates, and again under-\nscored how such harm reduction strategies were viewed\nexclusively from a power paradigm. A safe injecting strat-\negy raised additional issues for officers in regard to the\nmoral appropriateness of this intervention, particularly as\nthey perceived their role to be a role that supported the pun-\nishment of illicit drug users:\nThe system works for us . . . at least while we [can] say \"No\" ...\nwe rarely find a needle--very rarely . . . [it is because] they are\nhard to get in. If you had them on exchange--God knows where\nthey would hide them.\nThat means we are condoning drugs within the system. And I am\ntotally against that.\nAt the moment needles are like gold. If they start getting needles,\nthat becomes a weapon. That's straight away giving them\nweapons.\nSafe injecting programs in the prison system, of any type,\nwere also firmly rejected by the nursing staff. Rather, strong\nsupport was expressed for the opioid replacement program\n(the only established harm reduction program in place in the\nSA prison system at that time), as an alternative to continued\nillicit drug use.\nBut then when we've got other programs in place to take away\nthat whole needle problem. You know we've got methadone,\nand your [buprenorphine], I think we should be pushing that.\nIn contrast, prison officers commonly expressed signifi-\ncant doubts about the usefulness of the opioid replacement\nprogram, with suggestions that the program was being in\nappropriately targeted and monitored:\nI don't agree with . . . the methadone program . . . Cause there's\ntoo many on it. We had our count the other day--you know\nthere's nearly four hundred prisoners here and eighty five or\nsomething, ninety of them . . . on methadone.\nMethadone, no I don't [agree] either . . . You know, we've got\ncrims coming in clean, coming into the jail clean, and I know\nthis is happening . . . They're coming in totally clean. Other\ncrims are saying \"this is good shit, let's sign up.\"\nThey cough it [methadone or buprenorphine] into their clothing\nor their hands . . . there's lots of ways they can . . . go through a\nlot of trouble to get good at, you know.\nThat's what I think is our big problem with our . . . methadone\nprogram. If the methadone program was actually run and backed\nup with . . . full on support and education I think we'd have a lot\nmore success than what it does . . . as it is now . . . they're just\ngetting a buzz throughout the day.\nAccording to the nurses, the magnitude of this problem\nwas greatly overestimated by prison officers, as one nurse\nexplained:\nYou hear those stories all the time at all the prisons and I guess\nit all boils down to they don't just go straight on. They're\nassessed, and they're very thoroughly assessed. Certainly there's\nsome get through the net . . . And there'd be very, very few--I'm\nnot saying there's none, but there would be very few.\nIn agreement with the officers on providing injecting\nequipment--and in strikingly similar language--nurses were\nconcerned about the possibility of condoning drug use and\nsuggested the provision of any needles might compromise\nprison officer safety.\nWell the main issue becomes a safety issue for officers. At the\nmoment . . . needles and syringes that are around are worth their\nweight in gold, because there are so few of them . . . so there's no\nway they're gonna be wasted by threatening you . . . and if all of\na sudden you can get your hands on them relatively easily, they're\nnot worth that much more, so they might be used as a [weapon].\nIt's more or less condoning drug use . . . So it's banned on the\noutside, you come to prison . . . It's almost like . . . we're saying\nwhat you're doing is OK.\nStrategy 4:Education programs on HCV and other communicable\ndiseases. Overall, there was a more positive reaction to the\nstrategy of providing improved education programs and\ntraining around HCV and other communicable disease, par-\nticularly for prison officers. Officers and nurses, however,\nlacked a shared understanding of what educational opportu-\nnities were already in place for prison staff. Perceptions of\nwhat regulatory steps were required to protect staff and\ninmates in promoting harm reduction were unclear across the\ntwo operational sectors. Similarly, nursing staff and prison\nofficers were not aware of the procedures each group imple-\nmented to reduce HCV transmission risk.\n8 SAGE Open\nOfficers suggested that, beyond their initial orientation\ntraining, little continued education on HCV and other com-\nmunicable diseases was provided. Opportunity to attend pro-\nfessional development sessions was apparently restricted due\nto a shortage of staff to cover prison operations at any one\ntime. Thus, attendance was subject to staffing rosters and\nprison regulations regarding staff prisoner ratios:\nYou get [staff education] when you first come into the job and\n. . . you've got these blue gloves about the place reminding you\nall the time . . . it's just an automatic reaction that you reach and\nput gloves on. You're grabbing gloves and items to make sure\nyou're hopefully protecting yourself. It's always there . . . so you\ntend to be educated all the time.\nThe problem is we've got is we have such a turnover [of staff].\nAnd we have training days every four weeks, and in six years\nI've had three days of training.\nThe provision of education to prisoners was discussed\nbriefly, particularly in reference to prisoner literacy, but not\notherwise in depth. It is possible that this was due to a gen-\neral belief that the provision of such education was primarily\nthe role of health staff, as well as a lack of clarity about the\ninformation that was or should be provided to prisoners.\nI think it [further education] would be very good, because my\nunderstanding is what prisoners get in the way of education now\nis only when they go and see a nurse or doctor here. They're not\ngiven any literature as far as I'm aware.\nI don't know what the doctor or the nurses tell them, but on their\ninduction interview the last thing that they sign is a form saying\nthat they won't share needles, syringes, toothbrushes and razors\n. . . shaving equipment. And we tell them to assume everyone's\ngot hep C . . . but I don't know what happens on the . . . medical\nside.\nRaising awareness of HCV and other communicable dis-\neases was the one strategy accepted by officers to reduce\nharm in the prison environment. As identified previously,\nhowever, responses to the strategy tended to focus on ways in\nwhich the strategy worked toward the protection of correc-\ntional staff, with little attention given to reducing HCV trans-\nmission in general.\nEducation and information sessions were welcomed by\nnursing staff as an important strategy to raise awareness of\nHCV among prison officers and inmates. There was agree-\nment among nurses that health staff were adequately\ninformed and routinely updated on HCV and other commu-\nnicable diseases. As noted previously, nurses questioned the\napproaches used to disseminate HCV information on admis-\nsion to prisoners. While the officers clearly saw information\nprovision as the role of health staff, there was evidence that\nsome nurses assigned that responsibility to the prisoners\nthemselves:\nThere's plenty of literature around and things like that . . . but I\nsuppose it's the enthusiasm of individual prisoners. If they want\nto seek it, they'll seek it--they've certainly got access to it.\nIt's discussed on admission with each prisoner . . . generally\nwhen we talk to them they're pretty au fait on what you're\nsupposed to do . . . they know, it's whether or not they stick to it.\nBut they're all made aware. They all know when they come in\n. . . they're all adults, at the end of the day they've got to be\nresponsible for what they do when they get in here . . . to put\nthemselves at risk . . . well that's a choice.\nThere were few formal structures described to provide\nongoing education or HCV information to inmates. Nursing\npractice was apparently restricted to the provision of clinical\ncare in the infirmary with little if any responsibility for health\npromotion within the broader prison environment. With the\nexception of routine information provided at the initial\nassessment, discussion about HCV-related issues occurred\nprimarily when initiated by the prisoner themselves. Nurses\nattributed a lack of knowledge among prison officers with\nrespect to HCV and other communicable diseases, which\nthey believed was expressed in a tendency to overreact to\nassumed risks associated with some situations:\nObviously, we're not getting enough of their story . . . saying\nthese things, [there is a] misunderstanding of infectious diseases.\nThey're almost at the opposite extreme . . . we had that one last\nweek when a fellow slashed up and they came in with the white\nsuits.\nDiscussion\nThe interviews raised many concerns about the prison work\nenvironment, roles and responsibilities of staff members.\nThe topic of HCV harm reduction was overshadowed by\nwhat appeared to be deep rooted societal values and attitudes\nof prisoners and punishment. Thus, the notion of power and\nprivilege was threaded throughout the statements and con-\nversational exchanges within the transcripts. Such ideals\nessentially frame the context in which HCV harm reduction\nstrategies are potentially implemented, yet prison staff\n(prison officers in particular) appeared loathe to present\nviews on such matters. Where prisoner duty of care is posi-\ntioned by prison staff should be understood in this context.\nThe prison officer interviews revealed widespread feel-\nings of being undervalued and resentment about increased\npressures in the workplace, combined with perceptions of\ninadequate resources and staffing levels. Officers felt ill\nequipped to deal with what they saw as increasing preva-\nlence of mental health and drug-related problems in the\nprison population. Some of this may have manifested in a\ntendency to stereotype prisoners negatively. Nurses too dem-\nonstrated considerable frustration about the increasing\nMiller et al. 9\nprevalence of drug-related harm in the prison setting. There\nwas a lack of integration between nursing and correctional\nstaff with little awareness of the others' roles, duties, and\nconcerns.\nNurses and prison officers perceived hepatitis C as an\nimportant issue in their workplace. Prison officers did\nexpress greater concern about the potential for HCV trans-\nmission; however, both groups were confident in the effec-\ntiveness of `universal precautions.'While hepatitis C was the\nmain focus of this inquiry, it was clear that prison officers\nwere as, if not more, concerned about a range of microbial\nagents--with fear of transmission of disease to family and\nfriends commonly expressed. Improving access to appropri-\nate hand washing facilities, including the provision of alco-\nhol-based hand washing gels, were among strategies\nproposed and commonly supported by officers.\nThe `blood protocol' was a common experience among\nofficers and most reported a lack of departmental support\nduring the relatively lengthy waiting periods between fol-\nlow-up tests. At the time of the interviews, requirements for\nofficer co-payments for influenza vaccinations and self-\ndirected GP attendance for the hepatitis B vaccination pro-\ngram had been imposed. Prison officers expressed resentment\nabout these perceived barriers to complete immunization--\nparticularly given prisoner vaccinations programs remained\nintact.\nNurses expressed confidence in their knowledge about\nHCV and other communicable diseases. Conversely, officers\nfrequently expressed the need for ongoing training and edu-\ncation and were concerned about their current level of under-\nstanding. The conviction that nurses were providing opiate\nreplacement therapy to prisoners who had entered `clean'\nwas widely voiced by prison officers. Nurses described the\nongoing assessment processes followed to ensure only opi-\noid-dependent prisoners entered the opiate replacement pro-\ngram, yet these processes were not generally known by\nprison officers. Prison nurses were unaware of restrictions to\nthe officer vaccination program, another major issue for\nprison officers. It seems a more integrated approach to pris-\noner management will be required if the well-being of pris-\noners as well as the work environment of both prison-based\nstaff are to be improved in future.\nAn increase in HCV education programs was the only\nproposed strategy accepted by the prison officers and nursing\nstaff. Overwhelmingly, officers perceived the introduction of\nbleach, subsidized commercial tattoo application or inmate\ntraining in tattoo application, and safe injecting environ-\nments as a threat to officer\u00adprisoner power relations and a\nmeans of providing privileged conditions to inmates. Such\nviews were reinforced by a hierarchical system apparent in\nthe prison environment. The proposed strategies were per-\nceived to represent an undermining of their role and status. In\nparticular, they were threatened by a loss of respect from the\ncommunity for working in an environment that benefited\nprisoner privilege. Officers voiced concerns about perceived\nentitlements they felt had been eroded in recent years, such\nas staff hepatitis B and influenza vaccinations. The notion of\nshifting power relations compounded by strategies that were\nperceived to favor prisoners served to confirm to officers that\nthey worked in a system that had little regard or value for\ntheir responsibilities and the high risk environment they\nexisted within.\nThe context of power struggle and ongoing resentment\ncolored the officers' assessments of the harm reduction strat-\negies proposed. Hesitation to engage and discuss strategies\nregarding health and prisoner welfare appears to have been\ndriven by widespread perceptions that such topics sat outside\nof their working role. Thus, there was a tendency to refer\nback to their position rather than engage in the discussion\nwith confidence to declare authoritative comment.\nThe remaining strategies, rejected for their perceived\nthreat to staff, also drew on the power relations and employee\nhierarchy of the prison setting. Prisoner privilege was per-\nceived as an indictment on prison officers as they regarded\ntheir role as important in the upholding of community values\nand, thus, resented any intervention that appeared to reward\nprisoners. Changes to the officer vaccination program and\nlimited education opportunities were perceived as a lack of\nsupport for improving officer working conditions and safety.\nIt is possible that this might further exacerbate resentment of\nprisoner `privilege' by lowering officer self-esteem and\nrespect for the correctional system and governance.\nGiven this context, it is not surprising that officers were\nstrongly opposed to HCV interventions that have the poten-\ntial to improve prisoner welfare. Although nurses did voice\nconcerns about the threat of skin infection and scarring in\nrelation to tattooing, they also tended to demonstrate reduced\ninterest in the welfare of inmates overall, inferring that pris-\noners were disinterested in the health and safety of fellow\nprisoners. There was little evidence that nurses perceived a\nduty of care toward their clients as might be ordinarily\nexpected of nurses in other clinical settings. It could be con-\ncluded that such attitudes are representative of the context in\nwhich prison officers and nursing staff work. The tensions\nand high risk environment in which staff need to respond and\nmake immediate decisions have the potential to drain com-\npassion and observance of a duty of care (Tewksbury &\nHiggins, 2006). Similar experiences of frustration and of\nbeing undervalued may have driven some degree of accul-\nturation, particularly in what seems to have been the nurses'\nselective adaptation and adoption of the value systems of the\ncorrectional workforce (Padilla & Perez, 2003).\nThe very high risk for hepatitis C in the correctional envi-\nronment, for prisoners and prison staff, presents an urgent\ncase for the introduction of further harm reduction strategies\nin this setting. Strategies such as the provision of bleach to\nprisoners and even a clean needle program (given successful\ninternational pilots) are worthy of serious consideration. It\nseems highly unlikely, however, that either of these strate-\ngies would be accepted within the context described here.\nThere has been widespread "
