Risk factors for these transitions are\nalso studied.\nMethods: Data are from part II of the National Comor-\nbidity Survey, a nationally representative survey carried\naged 15 to 54 years to study prevalences and correlates\nof DSM-III-R disorders. Transitions are estimated using\nlife-table analysis. Risk factors are examined using sur-\nvival analysis.\nResults: Of the respondents, 13.5% reported lifetime ide-\nation, 3.9% a plan, and 4.6% an attempt. Cumulative prob-\nabilities were 34% for the transition from ideation to a\nplan, 72% from a plan to an attempt, and 26% from ide-\nation to an unplanned attempt. About 90% of un-\nplanned and 60% of planned first attempts occurred within\n1 year of the onset of ideation. All significant risk fac-\ntors (female, previously married, age less than 25 years,\nin a recent cohort, poorly educated, and having 1 or more\nof the DSM-III-R disorders assessed in the survey) were\nmore strongly related to ideation than to progression from\nideation to a plan or an attempt.\nConclusions: Prevention efforts should focus on planned\nattempts because of the rapid onset and unpredictabil-\nity of unplanned attempts. More research is needed on\nthe determinants of unplanned attempts.\nTHIS REPORT presents nation-\nally representative data on\nthe prevalence and risk fac-\ntors of attempted suicide in\nthe National Comorbidity\nSurvey (NCS).1 The motivations are that at-\ntempted suicide is both one of the stron-\ngestriskfactorsforcompletedsuicide2-4 and\nan important indicator of extreme emo-\ntional distress.5,6 Previous epidemiologic\nstudies in the United States have esti-\npopulation attempt suicide at some time in\ntheir life. However, no previous epidemio-\nlogic survey has investigated either trends\nin prevalence across cohorts or condi-\ntionalriskofattemptsinrelationtotheprior\nonset of ideation and plans or in relation\nto intercohort differences; these are a fo-\ncus of the current report. This report also\nexamines sociodemographic variables and\nDSM-III-R disorders as risk factors for at-\ntempted suicide. Previous research has\ndocumented that some demographic vari-\nables are risk factors for attempted sui-\ncide, including age,8-10 sex (reviewed by\nfects of demographic variables on both ide-\nation and attempts. However, no previous\nstudy has disaggregated these effects into\ninfluences on ideation, the transition from\nideation to a plan, and the transition from\nideation to an attempt either in the pres-\nence or absence of a plan. As shown be-\nlow, insights gleaned from this disaggre-\ngationhaveusefulimplicationsfortargeting\npreventive interventions.\nRESULTS\nPREVALENCES\nThe estimated lifetime prevalences (SEs)\nof suicide ideation, plans, and attempts in\n4.6% (0.4), respectively.

All respondents who\nscreened positive for a lifetime prevalence of any disorder\nand a random subsample of other respondents were ad-\nministered the part II interview. The part II interview av-\neraged slightly more than 1 hour and consisted largely of\nquestions about risk factors and consequences of the dis-\norders assessed in part I. The suicidality questions were in-\ncluded in the part II interview. As a result, the present re-\nport is based on the 5877 respondents who participated in\nthe part II interview. The data for these respondents were\nweighted to correct for differential probabilities of selec-\ntion into part II as well as for differential probabilities of\nwithin-household selection and nonresponse. Compari-\nsons of the part II NCS demographic distributions with cen-\nsus data show that the sample is representative of the US\npopulation on a wide range of sociodemographic vari-\nables. More details about the NCS design and data collec-\ntion methods are reported elsewhere.1,24\nMEASURES\nThe questions about suicide ideation, plans, and attempts\nare part of the life-event history section of the NCS inter-\nview. Separate questions were asked about the lifetime\noccurrence of suicide ideation (\"Have you ever seriously\nthought about committing suicide?\"), suicide plans\n(\"Have you ever made a plan for committing suicide?\"),\nand suicide attempts (\"Have you ever attempted sui-\ncide?\"). For each of these outcomes, information was\nobtained about age at first occurrence and the recency of\noccurrence. Lethality of intent was assessed by reading 3\nstatements and asking attempters to select 1 of the 3 to\ndescribe their first attempt. The first statement was \"I\nmade a serious attempt to kill myself and it was only luck\nthat I did not succeed.\" The second statement was \"I tried\nto kill myself, but I knew the method was not foolproof.\"\nThe third statement was \"My attempt was a cry for help; I\ndid not want to die.\"\nThe sociodemographic variables included in the analy-\nsis are sex, marital status, cohort, educational attainment,\nage of youngest child, race/ethnicity, and urbanicity. Mari-\ntal status was coded to differentiate the currently married,\npreviously married (separated, divorced, widowed), and\nnever married. Cohort was coded to differentiate respon-\ncoded to differentiate current students from those who had\ncompleted their schooling and, within each of these 2 cat-\negories, to differentiate those who had completed less than\nhigh school, high school, some college, or college gradu-\nation or more. Age of the respondents' youngest child was\ncoded into 4 categories consisting of respondents who had\nno living child and those whose youngest child was age 1\nyear, between ages 2 and 10 years, and more than age 10\nyears. Race/ethnicity was coded to differentiate among non-\nHispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, Hispanics, and all\nothers (Native Americans, Asians, Pacific Islanders, and re-\nspondents who self-defined themselves as \"other\"). Fi-\nnally, urbanicity was coded to differentiate respondents liv-\ning in census-defined major metropolitan areas from those\nliving in other census-defined urbanized areas or in census-\ndefined nonurban areas.\nDSM-III-R diagnoses were generated from a modified\nversion of the Composite International Diagnostic Inter-\nview (CIDI),25 a fully structured interview designed to be\nused by trained interviewers who are not clinicians. World\nHealth Organization Field Trials26 and NCS clinical reap-\npraisal studies27 both document good reliability and valid-\nity of most CIDI diagnoses, including mood disorders\n(major depression and dysthymia), anxiety disorders\n(panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, phobias, and\nposttraumatic stress disorder), and substance use disorders\n(alcohol abuse and dependence and drug abuse and\ndependence). However, there are 2 important exceptions\ninvolving mania28 and nonaffective psychosis, 29 neither of\nwhich is assessed with adequate validity in the CIDI.\nBecause of these problems, a restricted definition of mania\n(euphoric-grandiose subtype) and clinical diagnoses of\nnonaffective psychosis were used rather than the CIDI\ndiagnoses in the analyses reported here. Conduct Disorder,\nAdult Antisocial Behavior, and Antisocial Personality Dis-\norder (the conjunction of Conduct Disorder and Adult\nAntisocial Behavior) were assessed with the Diagnostic\nInterview Schedule30 since these disorders are not included\nin the CIDI.\nAll analyses were carried out using the SAS31 software pack-\nage (SAS Inc, Cary, NC). Simple cross-tabulations were used\nto investigate the associations among suicide ideation, plans,\nand attempts. Life-table methods were used to examine age-\nof-onset distributions. A discrete-time survival analysis with\ntime-varying covariates32 was used to study the risk fac-\ntors of lifetime suicide ideation, plans, and attempts. The\nuse of this method in the NCS has been described in detail\npreviously.33 Retrospective reports were used in the sur-\nvival analyses to create the time-varying risk factors (eg,\nages of changes in marital status) and to date the ages of\nonset of the outcome variables.\nBecause of the complex sample design and weighting\nof the NCS, SEs of the survival coefficients were estimated\nusing the Jacknife Repeated Replications34 simulation\nmethod implemented in an SAS macro. The Jacknife\nRepeated Replications estimates adjust for the clustering\nand weighting of cases. The survival coefficients were\nexponentiated and are reported below in the form of odds\nratios (ORs). The 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of these\ncoefficients are also reported and have been adjusted for\ndesign effects. Multivariate tests are based on 2 values\ncomputed from coefficient variance-covariance matrices\nthat were adjusted for design effects using Jacknife\nRepeated Replications. When a result is specified as being\nsignificant below, it is referring to statistical significance\nbased on 2-sided design-based tests evaluated at the .05\nlevel.\n\u00a91999 American Medical Association.

Among attempters, 46.7% (3.7) reported that\nthey had a plan prior to making their first attempt.\nHazard curves (Figure 1) show that the highest risks of\ninitial suicide ideation, plans, and attempts (ignoring le-\nthality of intent) are in the late teens and early 20s. Age-\nof-onset curves (Figure 2) show that median ages of on-\nset for all these outcomes are in the mid-20s. Conditional\nage-of-onsetcurves(Figure 3)showthatprogressionfrom\nideation to first onset of a plan, from a plan to first at-\ntempt, and from ideation to first attempt in the absence\nof a plan were all highest in the first year after onset of the\nearlier stage.\nTwo additional important results can be seen by com-\nparing the curves for planned and unplanned attempts.\nOne is that risk of a first attempt among ideators was sub-\nstantially higher in the presence of a plan. The other is\nthat risk of a first attempt among ideators who lack a plan\nwas largely limited to the first year after onset of ide-\nation. In comparison, risk of an attempt among ideators\nwith a plan not only was very high in the year of onset\nof the plan, but also continued for many years after-\nward. In all, roughly 90% of unplanned attempts and 60%\nof planned attempts occurred within 1 year of the onset\nof ideation. Lethality of intent among attempters was not\nsignificantly related either to the presence of a plan\n= 1.0; P = .31) or to speed of the attempt after onset\nof ideation (2\nRisk of an attempt was significantly related to being fe-\nmale, being previously married, being born in a recent\ncohort, and having a low educational level (Table 1).\nThe odds of an attempt were also lower among students\nthan among nonstudents at the same level of educa-\ntional attainment. Although non-Hispanic blacks had sig-\nnificantly lower odds of attempted suicide than non-\nHispanic whites, the 4-category race/ethnicity variable was\nnot significantly related to attempted suicide overall\nThe higher odds of an attempt among women than\namong men was related to 3 significant pathways, all with\nroughly equal ORs (1.5-1.8): higher unconditional odds\nof initial ideation, higher conditional odds of an at-\ntempt among ideators with a plan, and higher condi-\ntional odds of an attempt among ideators without a plan.\nThere was no significant sex difference among ideators\nin the odds of making a plan. Interaction between sex\nand cohort in predicting attempts was also tested based\non a suggestion that the sex difference might be smaller\nin recent cohorts.35 No significant interaction was found\nThe higher odds of an attempt among previously\nmarried subjects than among currently married sub-\njects was related to 2 of these same 3 pathways, again with\nroughly equal ORs (2.2): higher unconditional odds of\ninitial ideation and higher conditional odds of an at-\ntempt among ideators with a plan. However, the second\nvariable was not statistically significant. Unmarried ide-\nators were not more likely than their married counter-\nparts either to make a plan subsequent to the onset of\nAge of Onset, y\nHazard\nPlan\nIdeation Attempt\nFigure 1.

First, there was a significant in-\ncrease across cohorts, especially strong for the most recent\ncohort (OR = 6.4), in the unconditional odds of ide-\nation. Second, there was a significant but less strong in-\ncrease in the conditional odds of making a plan among\nideators that was very similar across all cohorts born af-\nter World War II (OR = 1.6-3.2). Third, there was a sig-\nnificant intercohort difference in the conditional odds of\nan attempt among ideators in the absence of a plan\n= 9.6; P = .02). There were no significant interco-\nhort differences in the conditional odds of an attempt\namong ideators in the presence of a plan (2\nThe significant negative association between edu-\ncation and the odds of an attempt was related to 3 path-\nways: a modest association with unconditional risk of ide-\nation (OR = 1.3-2.3), a stronger association with the\ntransition from having a plan to making an attempt\n(OR=2.9-7.0), and an even stronger association withmak-\ning an attempt among ideators in the absence of a plan\n(OR = 8.0-29.3). There was no significant association be-\ntween education and the conditional odds of making a\nplan among ideators.\nAn effort was made to study the predictors of le-\nthality of the attempt among attempters. However, the\nnumber of attempters in the NCS was too small to de-\ntect meaningful predictors with acceptable statistical\npower. It is of special note that neither age of first at-\nfound to be a significant predictor of lethality, although\ncaution is needed in interpreting these negative results\nbecause of their low statistical power.\nEvery one of the DSM-III-R disorders assessed in the NCS\nwas a significant risk factor for a lifetime attempt\n(Table 2). However, the ORs for mood disorders (7.8-\n29.7) were substantially higher than those for any other\ndisorders (2.1-6.5). As thoughts of death are included\namong the symptoms of major depression, thus creat-\ning the possibility of a confounding effect in predicting\nthe outcomes, the analysis was also replicated with a modi-\nfied definition of major depression that excluded this cri-\ntion in the effects of aggregate measures of disorders (any\nmood disorder, any anxiety disorder, any substance dis-\norder, and any other disorder) as a function of both age\n(dichotomized at the median age of first attempt) and\ncohort was also tested. No significant interactions were\nfound either with age (2\nactions involved sex: major depression (2\ndysthymia (2\nP = .01), and simple phobia (2\nfect of the disorder was larger among men than among\nwomen in all 4 interactions.\nAge of Onset, y\nSurvival, %\nIdeation Plan Attempt\nFigure 2.

All rights reserved.\nAn attempt was also made to evaluate the effects of\ncomorbidity among disorders in predicting the out-\ncomes. As shown in the last 4 rows of Table 2, there was\na significant dose-response relationship between num-\nber of prior disorders and odds of attempted suicide. Re-\nspondents with 3 or more disorders had relative odds of\nan attempt 19.7 times as high as respondents with no dis-\norder. However, this result does not control for the main\neffects of individual disorders. When an equation was es-\ntimated that included information about each of the in-\ndividual disorders as separate predictors, the incremen-\ntal effect of comorbidity was found to be considerably\nsmaller, although still statistically significant in predict-\ndisorders. No significant effects of particular bivariate or\nmultivariate comorbidity were found after controlling for\nnumber of disorders.\nThree broad patterns are noteworthy in the path-\nways of the significant associations of prior disorders with\nfirst suicide attempts. First, there were consistently sig-\nnificant ORs between all of the disorders and the subse-\nquent first onset of suicide ideation. These ORs were much\nhigher for the mood disorders (7.7-15.5) than for any\nother disorders (2.2-5.3) and, within disorder, higher in\npredicting ideation than any other pathway for every one\nof the disorders. Second, the pathways associated with\nthe conditional odds of developing a plan among ide-\nators and of making an attempt among ideators without\na plan were consistently greater than 1.0. Furthermore,\nORs were roughly equal in magnitude both when com-\npared across disorders for a particular pathway and when\ncompared within disorders across pathways. Most of these\nORs were in the range of 1.5 to 3.0. The same patterns\napplied to the effects of comorbidity. It is noteworthy that\nthe much higher ORs associated with mood disorders\nfound in other parts of the table were not found here,\nwith the exception of strong ORs for mania with the sub-\nsequent occurrence of a plan (OR = 4.0) and an un-\nplanned attempt (OR = 9.1). Third, the pathway associ-\nated with the conditional odds of making an attempt\namong ideators with a plan was generally not signifi-\ncant. The only exceptions were the mood disorders\nAs noted above, the sample of attempters was too\nsmall to study the predictors of lethality of the attempt\nwith good statistical power. However, exploratory analy-\nsis shows that seriousness of attempt was positively re-\nlated to total number of disorders (2\nalthough no particular type of disorder stands out as sig-\nnificantly more important than any other in the analysis\nof this small subsample of respondents.\nFurther analysis shows that the disorders considered in\nTable 2 partially explain the effects of the sociodemo-\ngraphic variables considered in Table 1. This was evalu-\nated in a joint model to predict attempted suicide in the\ntotal sample. Results show that the significant effects of\nsex, cohort, and education were attenuated but re-\nmained significant when controlling for disorders.

This is because only a tiny fraction of\nthe population (0.4%) had this large number of risk fac-\ntors. People with 3 or more risk factors, who made up\n9.2% of the population, accounted for 55.1% of all people\nwho made a lifetime suicide attempt.\nCOMMENT\nThe results reported here are limited by the fact that the\nNCSisacross-sectionalsurveyinwhichinformationabout\nlifetime suicide behaviors is based on retrospective re-\nports. Because of this limitation, prevalences are likely\nto be lower bound estimates. The estimated effects of co-\nhort and other risk factors could be caused, at least in\npart, by systematic differences in accuracy of recall re-\nlated to these risk factors.36 Furthermore, no reliability\nor validity data were obtained on the measures of ide-\nation, plans, attempts, or lethality. Finally, the ability to\nstudy the distribution and predictors of lethality is con-\nstrained by the fact that the sample excluded people who\ncompleted suicide.

The finding that risk of an attempt\nwas significantly higher among ideators with than with-\nout a plan is consistent with previous studies of period\nprevalence.9,41 The finding that having a plan was unre-\nlated to lethality of intent among attempters is inconsis-\ntent with the finding in one previous study that planned\nsuicide attempts were generally more serious than un-\nAlthough, to our knowledge, no previous general\npopulation surveys estimated the age-of-onset distribu-\ntion of attempted suicide, related research carried out with\nstudents confirms the NCS finding that risk begins to rise\nduring the teenage years.10 This is also consistent with\nthe finding in cross-sectional surveys of adults that pe-\nriod prevalence of attempted suicide is inversely related\nto age,8 and in longitudinal research that period preva-\nlence decreases as a cohort moves into adulthood.9 The\nNCS finding of rapid transition from first onset of sui-\ncide ideation and plans to attempts cannot be compared\nwith previous research, as no other population surveys\nhave examined this issue.\nThe risk factors considered here were examined in\na survival framework to study the predictors of first\nattempts. Previous research has generally studied cross-\nsectional associations between current measures of risk\nfactors and lifetime measures of attempts. This differ-\nence in methods could lead to discrepancies in results.\nTherefore, it is striking that most of the NCS risk factor\nresults are consistent with those found in previous\nresearch. These include the higher lifetime prevalence\nof attempted suicide among women than among men,11\nthe higher prevalence among previously married\npeople,13 and the inverse association with education,8\nalthough the education association was stronger in the\nNCS than in other recent studies.13,14 The significantly\nlower odds of an attempt among non-Hispanic blacks\nthan among whites is consistent with the trend in previ-\nous studies (reviewed by Moscicki15), although some\nstudies did not find a race difference.13,16 The analysis\nfails to replicate the finding of a decrease in the sex dif-\nference over recent cohorts35 or the finding that the pro-\ntective effect of being married is reversed among very\nThe NCS provides the first nationally representa-\ntive general population data on intercohort difference in\nlifetime suicide attempts.

The\nfinding that mood disorders are stronger predictors than\nother mental or substance use disorders is also consistent\nwith earlier studies. The NCS results do not confirm the\nfindingsinsomeearlierstudies,however,ofespeciallystrong\neffects of substance use disorders,49 antisocial personality\ndisorder,14 or panic disorder.19 Stronger associations might\nhave been obtained if the analysis had examined the ef-\nfectsofcriticalsymptoms,suchashopelessness,ratherthan\nexclusively focusing on diagnoses.\nTHE FINDING THAT comorbidity is a signifi-\ncant predictor of suicide attempts over and\nabove the effects of individual disorders is\nconsistent with many recent studies among\nsome of these earlier reports suggest a special role of par-\nticular types of comorbidity, none of them controlled rig-\norously for both specific individual disorders and global\npatterns of comorbidity (ie, number of disorders). When\nsuch controls were introduced, no special effects of co-\nmorbidity involving particular disorders were found. To-\ntal number of disorders, rather than the types of disor-\nders involved in the comorbidity, were found to be the\nstrongest predictors of suicide attempts.\nThe finding that comorbidity is a significant predic-\ntor of lethality is also important and is an exception to the\nmore general failure to document significant predictors of\nlethality of intent among attempters in the NCS. This fail-\nure is inconsistent with findings from previous studies that\nhave documented several significant predictors of lethal-\nity, including having a plan and late age of first attempt,\nAs noted above, the low statistical power to study lethal-\nity of intent in the NCS, coupled with the fact that sui-\ncide completers were excluded from the analysis, might\naccount for the failure to replicate these previous find-\nings regarding significant predictors of lethality.\nThe findings that rapid-onset attempts account for\nmore than 90% of unplanned first attempts and approxi-\nmately two thirds of planned first attempts are in need of\nreplication in both clinical samples and general popula-\ntion samples before they can be accepted. If confirmed,\nthe finding that the vast majority of unplanned first at-\ntempts occur shortly after the onset of suicide ideation\nmeans that efforts to intervene after the onset of ideation\nto prevent a first unplanned attempt would be impracti-\ncal unless a patient presented for treatment within a year\nof first onset of ideation. In cases in which this occurs, the\nobvious implications are that the clinician should search\nfor modifiable risk factors (eg, depression) and should en-\ngage in especially aggressive treatment over the high-risk\nperiod of the first year.56,57 As noted by Brent,55 it is also\nimportant to make sure patients at risk of impulsive at-\ntempts do not have access to medications that can be used\nto make a suicide attempt, as risk of unplanned attempts\nmay be increased by easy access to such agents.\nThe only potentially realistic high-risk population\nprevention efforts aimed at first suicide attempts after the\nfirst year of ideation would deal with planned attempts.\nThe retrospective NCS results suggest that approxi-\nmately one half of the people in the general population\nwith a history of a suicide plan who do not make an at-\ntempt during their first year of ideation make an at-\ntempt at some later date. The combination of high con-\nditional risk and a long risk period in a fairly small\nproportion of the population (about 2% of the popula-\ntion in recent cohorts) makes it likely that focused in-\nterventions in this subgroup would be cost-effective.\nThe risk factors considered in this report are more\ndirectly related to first attempts among ideators with a\nplan than to unplanned attempts. This can be seen most\nclearly in Table 3, where the OR comparing the highest-\nand lowest-risk groups is 2.3 for predicting a first at-\ntempt among ideators with a plan compared with be-\nClearly, if effective interventions to prevent first at-\ntempts among ideators with a plan are to be developed,\nthey will need to go beyond the standard set of risk fac-\ntors considered in the current report and elsewhere in\nthe literature to gain insights into possible intervention\ntargets in this high-risk segment of the population.\nMental Health, Bethesda, Md, with supplemental support by\ngrant MH46376 from the National Institute on Drug Abuse,\ndation,NewYork,NY(DrKessler).Preparationofthisreport\nfromtheNationalInstitutesofHealth,Bethesda(DrKessler),\nandbyajointfellowshipfromNIDA/INVEST(NationalInsti-\ntuteonDrugAbuseInternationalVisitingScientistsandTech-\nnicalExchangeProgram)andCONACYT(ConsejoNacional\nde Ciencia y Tecnologi\n\u00b4a), Mexico City, Mexico (Dr Borges).\nCollaborating National Comorbidity Survey sites and\ninvestigatorsareTheAddictionResearchFoundation,Toronto,\nOntario (Robin Room, PhD); Duke University Medical\nCenter, Durham, NC (Dan Blazer, MD, PhD, Marvin\nSwartz, MD); Harvard Medical School, Boston, Mass\n(Richard Frank, PhD, Ronald Kessler, PhD); Johns Hopkins\nUniversity, Baltimore, Md (James Anthony, PhD, William\nEaton, PhD, Philip Leaf, PhD); the Max Planck Institute of\nPsychiatry Clinical Institute, Munich, Germany (Hans-\nUlrich Wittchen, PhD); the Medical College of Virginia, Rich-\nmond (Kenneth Kendler, MD); the University of Miami, Mi-\nami, Fla (R.
