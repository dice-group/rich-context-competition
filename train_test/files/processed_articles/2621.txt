As predicted, competitive model-fitting indicated that\ndisorganized infants carrying Met alleles engage in more positive behavior and less\nnegative behavior than other children at age 5 and 11, with the reverse true of Val/Val\nhomozygotes, seemingly consistent with caregiving-controlling and punitive-controlling\nstyles, respectively, but only in the case of maternal and not teacher reports, thereby\nconfirmating a relationship-specific hypothesis.\nKeywords: attachment disorganization, COMT, social behavior, confirmatory analyses, replication\nINTRODUCTION\nIn contrast to a secure-attachment history, one of insecure attachment early in life is associated with\nmore problematic functioning later in development, including externalizing problems (e.g., Fearon\n2010; Colonnesi et al., 2011). Among children lacking a secure attachment, the most problematic\ndevelopment is usually manifested by those classified as disorganized (e.g., Carlson and Sroufe,\nOf note, however, is the distinctive variation in how disorganization manifests itself as children\ndevelop beyond the infancy years. Thus, investigators have distinguished a controlling-caregiving\nstyle from a more controlling-punitive style (see detailed description of the two disorganization\nstyles in Section Types of Preschool  ). Such distinct patterns are thought\nto be the result of differential experience with the parent and characteristics of the children\nthemselves, including severity of their disorganization (George and Solomon, 1998; Moss et al.,\nalternative explanation of variation in the way children with disorganized attachment histories\nLi et al.   and COMT Interaction\ndevelop, one recently advanced by a team of mostly Norwegian\ninvestigators--which we refer to as the \"Norwegian hypothesis\"\n(Hygen et al., 2014). It stipulates that the genetic make-\nup of the child affects how disorganization manifests itself,\nhighlighting in particular the Catechol-O-methyl transferase\n(COMT) val158Met genotype. We thus conduct a conceptual\nreplication of the gene -X-disorganization interaction central\nto the Norwegian hypothesis as delineated below, drawing on\ndata from the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth\nDevelopment (NICHD Early Child Care Research Network,\n2005). We regard this effort as especially important in light of\nconcern for the replicability of scientific findings (Jasny et al.,\npredictions to be tested, we planned a restricted set of analyses,\n100% of which are presented here, allowing \"the empirical chips\nto fall wherever they may.\"\nTypes of Preschool Disorganized\nAttachment\nThe social behavior of children develops substantially in the\nperiod between the end of infancy and the start of school (as\nwell as thereafter). Whereas prosocial behavior increases notably\nover this time period (Eisenberg and Fabes, 1998; Benenson\net al., 2003), physical aggression declines after peaking sometime\net al., 2006). Children with disorganized histories deviate from\ntypical developmental trajectories, at least with regard to behavior\ndirected toward their mothers, but seem to do so in two\ndisplay the controlling-punitive style of disorganization behave\nin ways that are physically threatening (e.g., aggression) and\nverbally harsh and commanding. It is no wonder, then, that their\nparents characterize them as aggressive, irritable, hyperactive,\nunadaptive, confrontational, moody, and hard to control (George\nand Solomon, 1996). One might expect them, therefore, to\nmanifest especially elevated levels of aggression and lower levels\nof social skills (e.g., cooperation) on standard measures of social\nfunctioning, at least when parents themselves are characterizing\nchild behavior.\nDisorganized children judged to be controlling-caregiving\nexhibit a rather different behavioral profile. They direct the\nparent's activity and conversational exchanges by structuring\ninteractions in a helpful and/or emotionally positive manner\n(Main and Cassidy, 1988; Cassidy and Marvin, unpublished\nmanuscript). By being exceptionally cheerful, polite, or\nsupportive, such children seem especially attentive to the moods\nand needs of parents and motivated to protect them (Solomon\nand George, 2011). Once again it is not surprising that the parents\nof these disorganized children perceive them to be especially\nclose, adaptable, and responsible, even socially precocious, taking\nresponsibility for the emotional well-being of their parents. It is\nalso not surprising that parents as well as na\u00efve observers might\nmistakenly regard the controlling-caregiving behavior of these\nchildren as a sign of social competence, cooperation, and positive\ndevelopment. Theory and research suggest, however, that this\nis a defensive posture, representing a strategy of inflating or\nmaximizing prosocial behavior directed toward the parent in an\neffort to avoid displeasing the parent and, thereby, engendering\nconflict. This latter perspective implies that the elevated levels\nof positive social behavior and low levels of aggressive behavior\nthat one might expect to document when relying on parental\nreports of these attributes reflect less social competence than\novercompensation and a means of self-protection which results\nfrom fear of the frightening or frightened parent. There is also\nthe view that the family processes of parentification and role\nreversal--which involve the child assuming practical and/or\nemotional responsibility for the parent, including care of siblings\nand managing the household--are driven by children's need to\nprotect the attachment system from the frequent disruptions in\nthe child-caregiver relationships, disruptions which themselves\nderive form frightening caregiver behavior and are often\nassociated with impaired child psychological health (e.g., suicidal\nideation, self-harm) (Bifulco et al., 2014).\nThe core issue we address in the research reported herein\nconcerns which kindergarten-age children with disorganized\nattachments in infancy manifest what would appear to be these\ndivergent styles of behavior, as reflected in standard measures\nof social functioning. Because our focus is not on the specific\nparenting that others have used to account for these two\ndifferent legacies of disorganized attachment, but rather on the\nchild's genotype, we next consider research on the genetics of\nattachment.\nThe Genetics of Attachment\nBehavior-genetic studies of attachment early in life have\nindicated, repeatedly, that unlike so many other psychological-\nbehavioral characteristics, attachment security is not (apparently)\nNotable as well is that molecular-genetic efforts to link candidate\ngenes with measures of attachment early in life have failed to\nchronicle reliable associations. (Luijk et al., 2011; Mesquita et al.,\nevidence, one can still wonder whether genetics plays a role\nin how the developmental legacy of early attachment--that is,\nits sequelae--is expressed. Recent research addressed this issue\nof gene -X-attachment interaction in predicting later social\nfunctioning, with four studies indicating that children carrying\nshort alleles in the 5-HTTLPR promoter region with histories\nof insecure, but not secure attachment, underperform other\ninsecure children carrying long alleles on measures of autonomy\nFrigerio et al., 2009); and regulatory control (Kochanska et al.,\n2009). Insecurely attached children also have been observed to\nrespond in more stressful ways than secure infants when carrying\nthe CC allele of the GABRA6 genotype or the Val/Val variant of\nthe COMT gene (Frigerio et al., 2009). A fifth study detected a\nresistant attachment in predicting stress reactivity, such that\ninfants with this attachment history carrying one or two T-alleles\nshowed elevated levels of cortisol (relative to baseline) in the\nStrange Situation in comparison to those lacking T alleles (Luijk\nLi et al.   and COMT Interaction\nMore recently--and especially important to the current\ninquiry--Hygen et al. (2014) predicted and documented a\nsignificant interaction between disorganization at age 4 years--as\nmeasured using a doll-play procedure (i.e., MCAST, Green et al.,\nyears. It is thus a COMT-X-disorganization interaction that we\nseek to conceptually replicate herein. The Norwegian team chose\nto focus on the COMT polymorphism because of suggestive\nevidence linking it to both disorganization and aggression (Baud\nbeing one of their core outcomes.\nNotable as well is that that variation in COMT activity\ninfluences variation in dopamine levels, particularly in the\nPFC. In fact, the COMT enzyme accounts for more than 60%\nof dopamine degradation in the PFC (Karoum et al., 1994).\nThus, individuals homozygous for the Val allele of COMT\nMet158Val have four times as much COMT activity as Met\nhomozygotes, resulting in lower dopamine level in the PFC\nas a result of these observations that the Norwegian team\nassumed that children homozygous for the Val allele would\nhave lower levels of dopamine than Met-carrying children. This\nexpectation was central to their specific prediction as to how\nCOMT would moderate the effects of disorganization on social\nfunctioning reflective of controlling-caregiving and controlling-\npunitive behavioral styles. Also influencing their predictions was\nevidence that childhood sexual abuse (Perroud et al., 2010),\nor existing behavior problems, such as ADHD (Caspi et al.,\n2008), forecast elevated levels of aggression and that COMT in\ncombination with ADHD has been linked to impaired social\nunderstanding (Langley et al., 2010). Indeed, it was for these\nreasons that they focused, as we do, too, on aggression and social\ncompetence.\nWhat Hygen et al. (2014) predicted--and found--was that\nwhereas 4-year olds who scored high on the doll-play measure of\ndisorganization and were homozygous for Val alleles increased in\ntheir levels of aggression and decreased in social skills across the\ntransition to school, those carrying Met alleles changed in exactly\nthe opposite direction (i.e., decreased aggression, increased\nsocial skills). Surprisingly, as already implied, the COMT\nX disorganization interaction did not predict, as originally\nanticipated by the Norwegian investigators, level of functioning\nat either ages four or six, but predicted only change over time.\nThe latter result did prove relationship specific, as anticipated,\nhowever, in that the gene-X-attachment interaction predicted\nchild behavior reported only by mothers, not by teachers.\nCurrent Study\nWe sought to extend Hygen et al. (2014) research by testing\n\"the Norwegian hypothesis\" regarding the differential and\ngenetically moderated developmental legacies of attachment\ndisorganization. Thus, consistent with the Norwegian\ninvestigators' original hypothesis, we anticipated that the\nCOMT genotype would predict similarly divergent patterns of\nsocial functioning in the case of kindergarteners classified as\ndisorganized in their attachments to their mothers at age 15\nmonths, but only when maternal rather than teacher reports\nof child behavior were subject to analysis; and that the just\ndelineated genetic moderation would not be evident in the\ncase of children with non-disorganized attachment histories.\nWe chose to focus on level of functioning at kindergarten age\nrather than change in behavior over time (as the Norwegian\ninvestigators did), because this is where the Norwegian\ninvestigators initially expected to chronicle COMT-moderated\neffects of disorganized attachment. Notably, instead of relying\non a doll-play measure of disorganization at age 4 years,\nwe examine disorganization assessed in the gold-standard\nStrange Situation at age 15 months. And instead of focusing\nupon change in behavior from age 4 to 6 years, we focus\non behavioral functioning in kindergarten, some 3.5 years\nfollowing assessment of early attachment. Furthermore, in\nsecondary analyses, we evaluate the COMT-X- disorganization\ninteractions on the same (mother- and teacher-reported) child\nbehavior measures in grade six to determine whether any\ninteraction detected at an earlier age proves evident years\nlater. Because of these method and design distinctions, we\nregard the current inquiry as a conceptual rather than exact\nreplication.\nIn contrast to \"exact replications,\" one can adopt less stringent\ncriteria and still speak of replication. A \"conceptual replication,\"\nlike the one being reported herein, may prove somewhat different\nfrom what was done in prior work, but is yet conceptually\nparallel to and informed by the work for which \"replication\"\nis sought. The essential question becomes not whether specific\nfindings tied to specific measurements evaluated in a seemingly\nidentical sample can be repeated, but whether the more general\nfinding can be detected again using related, even if not exactly\nthe same, measurements or research design. Indeed, this is\nmore or less why meta-analyses are undertaken--to determine\nwhether, across often diverse studies using different methods and\nsamples, some finding emerges with some degree of reliability,\nas well as what investigatory factors might affect whether or\nnot a finding emerges. In the research reported herein, we were\nmotivated to conduct what should be regarded as a conceptual\nreplication.\nImportantly, instead of conducting a traditional--and\nexploratory--analysis to determine whether the statistical\ninteraction of disorganization and COMT predicts parent-\nand/or teacher-reported measures of aggression and social\ncompetence in kindergarten, we employ a confirmatory and\ncompetitive model-fitting strategy. We adopted this statistical\napproach because the current work attempts to replicate\nconceptually the findings of the Norway group, being based\nas it is on explicit, a-priori predictions about how the data\nwill be patterned (see next paragraph). Thus, model fitting\ndepends on clearly formulated propositions as to how the data\nwill be organized, with the overall fit of the model being most\nimportant, rather than one or another particular component\nof the model. This approach contrasts markedly, then, to\nan exploratory regression where one may even anticipate a\nsignificant interaction but makes no commitment to what exact\nform it will take, thereby requiring follow-up or decomposition\ntests to illuminate the form of the interaction (Belsky et al.,\nLi et al.   and COMT Interaction\nFIGURE 1 | Hypothesized COMT X disorganization interaction pattern for mother-reported positive and negative child behavior (\"0\" = organized;\n\"1\" = disorganized).\nBased on the original Norwegian hypothesis, this conceptual\nreplication specifically, directly and collectively tests the following\nmultiple propositions graphically depicted in Figure 1: (a)\nkindergarteners with a history of disorganized attachment who\nare homozygous for the Val allele will score higher on aggression\nand lower on social competence, reflecting a punitive-controlling\nbehavioral style, than will non-disorganized/organized children;\n(b) kindergarteners with a history of disorganized attachment\ncarrying the Met allele, will score lower on aggression and\nhigher on social competence, reflecting a caregiving-controlling\nbehavioral style than will non-disorganized/organized children;\nand (c) because disorganization, by definition, refers to the nature\nof a relationship that a child has with his or her caregiver, and\nthat children's punitive and caregiving behavior are only activated\nby, and within the (parent-child) attachment system, these\ndifferential developmental legacies of disorganized attachment\nwill be evident only in maternal, not teacher reports; finally (d)\nchildren who do not have a history of disorganized attachment\nwill not exhibit differential aggression or social competence\noutcomes as a function of their COMT gene allelic status.\nParticipants\nParticipants were recruited during the first 11 months of 1991\nin 24 hospitals from 10 data- collection locations in the United\nStates (Charlottesville, VA; Irvine, CA; Lawrence, KS; Little\nRock, AR; Madison, WI; Morganton, NC; Philadelphia, PA;\nPittsburgh, PA; Seattle, WA; and Wellesley, MA). A total of\nscreened for eligibility, and 1364 families with healthy newborns\ncompleted a home interview when the infant was 1 month\nand ultimately became participants. The study was reviewed\nand approved by University of Wisconsin Internal Review\nLi et al.   and COMT Interaction\nBoard. More details about recruitment and selection procedure\ncan be found in NICHD Early Child Care Research Network\nIn the current study, only children of Caucasian ethnicity\nwere included to avoid confounding ethnicity and gene\nfrequency. Among the 693 children whose genetic information\nwas available, 579 were Caucasian, and 19 of these children\nwere excluded from the analysis sample due to the missing\ninformation on attachment security. The final sample for the\nMeasurements\nAttachment Disorganization at 15 Months\nAttachment security was measured at 15 months using the\nAinsworth and Wittig (1969) Strange Situation Procedure (SSP).\nInfant attachment was classified, based on careful review of\nvideotapes, into one of four major categories: secure (B), avoidant\n(A), resistant (C) or disorganized (D). Disorganized (D) infants\ndo not display a coherent strategy in the SSP. For example, they\nmay exhibit a mixture of avoidant and resistant behavior or\nseem very confused or apprehensive upon reunion with mother.\nCases that cannot be categorized are designated as unclassifiable\n(U) or missing. All SSP videotaped were later shipped to a\ncentral location for coding. 80 children were categorized as\navoidant (A, 14.3%); 336 were assigned to the secure category\nchildren were classified as disorganized (D, 12.9%), and 23\nchildren proved unclassifiable or were missing attachment data\nconceptually replicate the findings of the Norwegian study, all\nnon-disorganized classifications were combined to create a non-\nD group (N = 488)--to be compared with those classified\ndisorganized (N = 72)--in the primary analyses; in secondary,\nsensitivity analyses, the continuous D rating was used. Each SSP\ntape was coded by two coders working independently. Across\nall coder pairs, agreement with the five-category classification\nsystem was 83% (kappa = 0.69) [NICHD (Early Child Care\nCOMT\nBuccal mucosa cells were collected with cotton swabs by the\nsubjects at 15 years of age.

Grove, Director for Genetic\nAnalysis. Taqman SNP Genotyping Assays were performed\nusing an Allelic Discrimination Assay (Applied Biosystems,\nFoster City, CA) protocol. Forty nanograms of DNA were\ncombined in a volume of 5 microliters with 2X Universal\nPCR Mix (Applied Biosystems) and 1/20 the volume of the\nTaqman SNP assay in a 384 well plate. A Pre-Read was\nperformed and then PCR as follows: a 10 min hold at 95C,\nPost-Read was performed, and automatic and manual calls\nwere made. The genotypes of the participants were categorized\ndistribution of the genotypes did not deviate from Hardy-\nNorwegian study we are attempting to conceptually replicate, all\nMet carriers (N = 421), whether Val/Met (AG) heterozygotes\nor Met/Met (AA) homozygotes formed one genotypic subgroup\ninitially--in the primary analyses (see Data Analysis Plan\nbelow)--to be compared with the group of Val/Val (GG)\nhomozygotes (N = 158). In secondary, sensitivity analyses,\nsubgroup scoring was modified. Collectively, then, there were\nhomozygotes, (c) 55 disorganized Met carriers and (d) 17\ndisorganized Val/Val homozygotes. Chi-square tests indicated\nno association between the COMT genotype (Met carriers vs.\nVal/Val) and children's disorganization classification (D vs. Not-\ngenotype and children's attachment classification--regarded as a\nproxy for the environment-- indirectly ruled out the possibility\nof passive gene-and-environment associations(rGE). Thus, the\nDisorganization-X-COMT interaction revealed in this study\ncould not be attributed to the possibility that disorganized\nchildren inherited the COMT gene from their parents who then,\nin response, treated their children problematically, thus resulting\nin attachment disorganization.\nAggressive Behavior: Mother-Report and\nTeacher-Report\nAggressive behavior was measured using the Child Behavior\nChecklist (CBCL) and the Teacher Report Form (TRF)\ncompleted by mothers and teachers, respectively, when children\nthat includes a broad range of children's behavioral or emotional\nproblems was presented. For each item, the respondent was\nasked to determine how well that item described the target child\ncurrently or within the last 2 months: 0 = Not True (as far as I\nknow), 1 = Somewhat or Sometimes True, and 2 = Very True\nor Often True. The aggressive behavior subscale score is the sum\nof 20 mother-report and 25 teacher-report items, resulting in a\nrange of scores of 0\u00ad40 for mothers and 0\u00ad50 for teachers. A\nhigher score indicates greater aggressive behaviors. (Descriptive\ninformation was presented in Table 1).\nSocial Competence: Mother-Report and\nTeacher-Report\nSocial competence was assessed by 38-item mother-report and\n30-item teacher-report form of the Social Skills Rating System\n(SSRS) (Gresham and Elliott, 1990). Three subscale scores\nderived from both of these (maternal- and teacher-report)\ninstruments are Cooperation (coefficients  = 0.76 (mother)/0.92\n(teacher); e.g., \"volunteer to help family members\"), Assertion\n(s = 0.69 (mother)/0.86 (teacher); e.g., \"make friends easily\"),\nand Self-control (s = 0.80(mother)/0.87(teacher); e.g., \"control\ntemper when arguing with other\"). The longer, mother-report\ninstrument also includes a subscale for Responsibility ( =\nLi et al.   and COMT Interaction\nTABLE 1 | Sample characteristics before multiple imputation.\nEntire sample Disorganized group Non-disorganized group\nN Mean\n(SD)\n[Min, Max] N Mean\n(SD)\n[Min, Max] N Mean\n(SD)\n[Min, Max]\nSD, standard deviation; Min, minimum value; Max: maximum value.\n0.62(mother); e.g., request permission before leaving house).\n(Descriptive information was displayed in Table 1).\nData Analysis Plan\nData analyses proceeded in three major phases: preliminary,\nprimary, and secondary. Preliminary analyses involved multiple\nimputation of missing data (which ranged from 5.0 to 9.1%\nand Graham, 2002) using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo\n(MCMC) imputation method to generate 100 imputed data\nsets for all cases on whom COMT and disorganization data\nwere available. Primary analyses testing the core hypothesis\ncentral to this inquiry were thus run 100 times, once using each\nimputed data set, with results composited across these multiple\nanalyses. More specifically, using SAS PROC MIANALYZE,\nparameter estimates were averaged across imputed datasets, with\nthe corresponding standard errors of the parameter estimates\ncalculated after accounting for the variances from sampling and\nmultiple imputation, according to Rubin's (1987) rule.\nThe second step of preliminary analysis, the results of\nwhich are reported now, focused on data reduction. More\nspecifically, exploratory factor analyses were used to determine\nwhether the measures of child functioning could be composited\nbased on empirical grounds, thereby reducing the number\nof statistical tests conducted and the likelihood of generating\nchance results. Two rather clear factors emerged which afforded\ncreation of two composite measures, one of positive and one\nof negative behavior. Eigenvalue of both factors were greater\nthan one. The first (positive-behavior) factor explained 76%\nand the second (negative-behavior) factor explained 24% of\nvariance. Factor loadings of variables from the first factor\nused to create the positive-behavior composite ranged from\n0.46 to 0.91 and those from the second factor used to create\nThere were no cross-loaded items within these ranges on\neither factor. Thus, a Positive Behavior score was created\nfor mothers by summing standardized scores for cooperation,\nassertion, and responsibility, though in the case of teachers,\nonly the first two subscales were composited (as there was\nno score for responsibility). A Negative Behavior score was\ncreated by summing standardized scores for aggression and\nself\u00adcontrol for both maternal and teacher reports of child\nbehavior, with the latter variable reversed to reflect lack of self-\ncontrol.\nThe primary analyses tested hypotheses central to this inquiry\nusing a confirmatory, model-testing approach with genetic\nsubgroups scored as in the original Norwegian research and\nwith respect to the kindergarten outcome measures. This model-\nfitting approach allows for direct evaluation of the overall\npattern of the data and whether it proves consistent with the\nmultiple hypotheses outlined at the end of the Introduction.\nSpecifically, the approach assumes that the difference on\noutcome variables between the Met carrier and Val homozygote\ngroups will be significant only for children with disorganized\nattachment, only in the case of parent reports and, based on\nprior work, this difference should take a specific form. That is,\nthe difference between Met carriers and Val homozygotes on\nmother-reported outcomes will be significant only for children\nLi et al.   and COMT Interaction\nwith disorganized attachment, with Val homozygotes exhibiting\nlower mother-reported positive-behavior and higher negative-\nbehavior scores than Met carriers. In contrast, children with\nnon-disorganized attachment (i.e., the secure, insecure-avoidant,\nand insecure-resistant attachment groups) should not exhibit\ndifferent outcomes as a function of their genetic status in the case\nof either mother- or teacher-reported outcomes (see Figure 1).\nTo instantiate these predictions, the statistical model\nstipulates that:\nIn this model all parameters were freely estimated: A1 and A2\nare the intercept for each genetic subgroup (group = 1: Met\nCarrier (i.e., Val/Met and Met/Met); group = 2: Val/Val); B1 and\nB2 represent the differential slope for each genetic subgroup;\nand E refers to the error term. A1 should not differ from A2,\nbut B1 should differ--and in the hypothesized direction--from\nB2. The difference between A1 and A2 is, essentially, the simple\nmain effect of genetic subgroup (Met vs. Val) for children with\nnon-disorganized attachment, and we predict that the Met and\nVal subgroups will not differ for children with non-disorganized\nattachment. Furthermore, the test of the difference between\nB1 and B2 is a test of the genetic subgroup (Met carriers vs.\nVal homozygotes) X attachment group (nondisorganized vs.\ndisorganized), and we predict that children with disorganized\nattachment will differ significantly from their counterparts with\nnondisorganized attachment as a function of their genetic make-\nup--and in the hypothesized direction. Notably, the most crucial\ntests of our theoretical predictions are the tests of difference\nbetween B1 and B2, reflecting the differences of disorganized Met\ncarriers and Val/Val individuals from their genetic counterparts\nwith nondisorganized attachment. This test, together with\nthe model comparison described below, allowed us to assess\nthe overall patterning of the data. Importantly, although our\ntheoretical approach specified the direction of the differences\n(e.g., differences between B1 and B2), the significance of the\nsimple slopes (e.g., B1) was not the primary prediction and thus\nis not the focus of the current analyses.\nBased on the equation shown above, the test of difference\nbetween B1 and B2 is a test of the gene-X-disorganization\ninteraction, because statistical significance of this test is an\nindicator that the regression lines differ as a function of genetic\nsubgroup, hence the presence of an interaction. The equation\nshown above is a four-parameter equation, with parameters\nof A1 and A2 and B1 and B2; we termed this model the full\nmodel. To evaluate whether the difference between A1 and\nA2 was negligible, we formulated a nested three-parameter\nequation constraining A1 = A2, which we term our hypothesized\nmodel, because the difference between non-disorganized Met\ncarriers and Val homozygotes is nil, but the difference between\ndisorganized Met carriers and Val homozygotes, reflected in the\nB1 and B2 parameters, remains in the model. We also fit another\nthree-parameter model, termed the comparison model, in which\nwe constrained B1 = B2, but allowing A1 and A2 to be separately\nestimated. Thus, the hypothesized model posits that the genetic\nsubgroups will not differ for children with non-disorganized\nattachment, but they will differ for those with disorganized\nattachment. Conversely, the comparison model assumes that the\ngenetic subgroups may differ for children with non-disorganized\nattachment, but will not differ at all for those with disorganized\nattachment.\nWe competitively evaluated the relative fit of these three\nmodels with the Bayesian information criterion (BIC), which\ncan be used to evaluate the fit of non-nested models, such\nas the hypothesized and comparison three-parameter models.\nLower values of the BIC indicate better fit of a model to\ndata. We predicted that the hypothesized model would yield\nbetter fit to data than both the full model and the comparison\nmodel for mother-report outcomes, but not for teacher-report\noutcomes. The primary analyses also evaluated the effect sizes\nof the COMT-X-disorganization interactions on kindergarten\nmother-reported positive and negative behavior by magnitude\nof differences (i.e., Cohen's d. http://www.campbellcollaboration.\norg/resources/effect_size_input.php).\nThe secondary analyses involved evaluating the sensitivity of\nthe results which emerge from the primary analyses using (1)\noutcomes measured at Grade 6 and (2) scoring genetic subgroups\nand disorganization differently than in the primary analyses\nwhen again predicting kindergarten and Grade-6 outcomes. In\nthe latter analyses, we left the COMT coding in its original form,\nwhere groups 1, 2, and 3 represented persons with 0, 1, or 2 Val\nalleles, respectively, and we left the disorganization rating in its\nfull 9-point format, coded 0 = no evidence of disorganization to\n8 = highly disorganized. We then fit the following model:\n\n\n\nThe preceding equation is similar to Equation 1, but has slope\nand intercept estimates for each of the COMT allele groups. The\nmodel above has 6 parameter estimates--three intercepts (A1\nthrough A3) and three slopes (B1 through B3). We also fit a linear\nCOMT X linear disorganization model as a 4-parameter model,\nin which we constrained the intercept for group 2 to fall exactly\nbetween the intercepts for groups 1 and 3, and a similar constraint\nwas places on the slope values. Because the 4-parameter linear X\nlinear model always had a lower BIC value, and therefore better\nmodel fit, relative to the 6-parameter full model, we report only\nresults for the linear X linear model below.\nRESULTS\nPrimary Analyses\nDetailed results of the primary data analyses are displayed in\nTable 2, but before highlighting them, it is important to consider\nBIC values and thus the overall fit of the multiple models tested,\nas these most directly address the overall patterning of the\ndata. Comparisons of the full, hypothesized, and comparison\nmodels using the BIC statistic in the case of mother-reported\nchild behavior showed that the hypothesized model fit the data\nbest.

In addition, for each imputed data set,\nthe hypothesized model had a lower, better BIC value than\nthe comparison model (positive behavior BIC difference: M =\nSD = 0.52). More specifically and as graphically displayed in\nFigure 2, disorganized Met carriers(Met-carriers = 0.85, p =\n0.02) scored significantly higher on mother-reported positive\nbehavior than disorganized Val/Val homozygotes(Val/Val =\neven if not to a significant extent, in the case of negative behavior\nIn contrast to the mother-reported data, although both the\nhypothesized and comparison models had smaller BIC values\nthan the full model on the teacher-rated positive- and negative-\nbehavior composites, the hypothesized and comparison models\nhad BIC values that differed very little on these teacher-rated\ncomposites (BIC difference positive composite: M = -0.10, SD\n0.30). This indicated that neither model was superior to the other\nfor these teacher-rated composites. As predicted, then, only in the\ncase of maternal-reported child behavior, did the hypothesized\nmodel fit the data best.\nThe statistical foundations of the overall model-fit results just\nreported are displayed in Table 2 and will now be considered.\nNote first that the B1 = B2 test achieved statistical significance,\nreflecting the fact that in the case of both mother-reported\npositive and negative composites the genetic groups differed in\nthe expected direction for those with histories of disorganized\nattachment. The fact that the A1=A2 test was not significant\nindicates that the same difference between genetic subgroups\ndid not emerge for mother-reported positive and negative\ncomposites in the case of children with organized attachment\nhistories. (i.e., comparing organized Met-carrier with Val/Val\nindividuals, for mother-rated positive composite: Cohen's d =\nin either A or in B parameters emerged in the case of teacher\nreports.\nIn sum, even though not every anticipated difference proved\nstatistically significant in its own right, the patterning of the\nentire corpus of data was exactly as predicted, with differences--\nin the expected direction--between genetic subgroups emerging\nonly in the case of maternally reported data, not teacher-reported\ndata, and only in the case of children with a history\nLi et al.   and COMT Interaction\nFIGURE 2 | Actual COMT X disorganization interaction pattern for kindergarten mother-reported positive and negative child behavior (\"0\" =\norganized; \"1\" = disorganized). Note: The primary analyses used binary COMT coding (i.e., Val/Val vs. Met carrier) and categorical disorganization score (\"0\" =\norganized; \"1\" = disorganized).\nof disorganization, not children with organized attachment\nhistories. Considered together, then, the gene -X-attachment\npatterns evaluated on an a-priori basis in the model-fitting\nanalyses appear in line with the proposition that disorganized\nattachment predicts controlling-caregiving--that is overly nice--\nbehavior in the case of Met carriers, but controlling-punitive--\nthat is, overly hostile--behavior in the case of Val homozygotes.\nThe fact that these differential patterns of behavior were not\ndiscerned in the case of teacher-reported outcomes suggests\nthat the discerned results reflect relationship-specific patterns of\nfunctioning.\nSecondary Analyses\nThe final set of analyses sought to evaluate the robustness of the\nfindings just reported by means of a series of sensitivity analyses.\nThus, to determine whether the COMT-X-disorganization\nfindings already reported endured over time the model-fitting\nanalyses just reported were rerun using the same parent- and\nteacher-reported outcomes measured in 6th grade. We also\nanalyzed parent- and teacher-reported kindergarten and grade 6\npositive and negative behavior composites when (a) COMT was\nparameterized as a 3-level variable (0 = Met/Met, 1 = Met/Val,\n2 = Val/Val) rather than the original 2-level variable as in the\nLi et al.   and COMT Interaction\noriginal Norwegian research (i.e., 0 = Met/Met and Met/Val vs. 1\n= Val/Val) and (b) using the continuous D (or disorganization)\nrating from the Strange Situation (N = 558) rather than the\ncategorical D classification when testing the predictions central\nto this inquiry. Because of the three-level coding of COMT in\nmultiple robustness checks (i.e., kindergarten, 6th grade), we\nfitted two sub-models in line with the previous model; the first of\nthese restrained the Met/Val subgroup parameter estimates to fall\nexactly in between those for the Val/Val and Met/Met subgroups\nso the gene effect would be constrained to linearity, and the\nsecond afforded non-linear genetic effects by freely estimating the\nslope of Met/Val group.\nResults of these sensitivity analyses, which are presented in\nTable 3 (i.e., primary analysis re-run at Grade 6) and in Table 4\n(i.e., primary analysis re-run using 3-level COMT and continuous\nD at both kindergarten and grade 6), proved generally in line\nwith those reported already (see Figures 3\u00ad5). Before reporting\nthese results in more detail, it should be noted that, as with the\noriginal analyses of mother-reported kindergarten outcomes, BIC\nvalues proved consistently smaller in the case of the hypothesized\nmodel, with the data once again being patterned in a manner\nin line with the Norwegian hypothesis. For example, in the\ngrade 6 models reported in Table 3, the hypothesized model\nfit better than the full model in all cases, with BIC values\nkindergarten and grade 6 analyses in Table 4, the linear model\nfit better than the full model in all cases, with BIC values\nBIC values always supported retention of our hypothesized,\nconstrained models in comparison to more highly parameterized\nfull models.\nIn contrast to mother-reported data, it was never the case,\nno matter (a) how the COMT and disorganization predictors\nwere parameterized (i.e., 2 or 3 levels) or (b) when the outcomes\nwere measured (i.e., kindergarten or 6th grade), that teacher\nreports proved consistent with the anticipated effects for mother-\nreported child functioning.\nInspection of Figure 3 indicates that disorganized Met carriers\n(Met/Met, Val/Met) scored higher than disorganized Val/Val\nhomozygotes on mother-reported positive behavior, even if not\n0.988]), with the reverse being true for mother-reported negative\nin grade 6 ratings as shown in kindergarten ratings in Figure 2.\nWhen COMT was coded in 3-levels (i.e., Met/Met, Met/Val\nand Val/Val), the best-fitting linear gene model constrained\nintercept and slope estimates for the Met/Val heterozygotes to\nfall exactly midway between corresponding estimates for the\nhomozygous groups, with results shown for mother ratings of\npositive and negative composites in kindergarten and grade\n6 in Figures 4, 5, respectively. This model suggests that the\ngene effect may be linear, rather than nonlinear as in the\noriginal results by Hygen et al. (2014). That is, Hygen et al.\nand our analyses in Tables 2, 3 implicitly had a recessive\ngene effect specified, presuming that the presence of two Val\nalleles would lead to different outcomes than for the Met/Met\nand Val/Met groups, the latter of which would have identical\noutcomes.\nThe statistical foundation of the overall model fit for our\nsensitivity analyses are displayed in Tables 3, 4. In Table 3,\nstatistical results are shown for grade 6 ratings by mothers and\nteachers using the same statistical models as for kindergarten\nratings in Table 2. Inspection of results in Table 3 show that\nthe grade 6 results are quite similar to the kindergarten results.\nThe only exception is that the important test of B1 = B2 was\nsignificant at only a trend level (p < 0.10) on the mother-\nrated positive composite, although it remained significant (p <\n0.05) for the mother-rated negative composite. As with the\nkindergarten ratings, all parameter estimates in Table 3 for the\nmother ratings were in the hypothesized direction, and none of\nthe results for teacher ratings approached significance.\nTurning to the results of the linear COMT X continuous\ndisorganization analyses displayed in Table 4, findings for the\nbest fit linear COMT X linear disorganization model are shown.\nHere, we reported parameter estimates (A1 and B1) for the\nMet/Met group and corresponding estimates (A3 and B3) for\nthe Val/Val group; parameter estimates (A2 and B2) for the\nheterozygous Val/Met group were constrained to fall directly\nbetween corresponding values for the homozygous groups. None\nof the A1=A3 tests were statistically significant for mother-\nreported positive and negative behavior, revealing no differences\nbetween allelic groups for organized children. Results for the\ncrucial B parameters were similar to, although not quite as strong,\nas for prior analyses. Specifically, the test of equality of B values\nwas statistically significant for mother-rated positive composite\nin kindergarten (p < 0.05, R-square explained by the interaction\nbut not in grade 6 (p = 0.28; R-square for the interaction\ncomposite, the difference in B values was significant at trend level\nin both kindergarten (p = 0.052; R-square for the interaction:\nvalues were in the hypothesized direction. Finally, no differences\nin either A or B parameters turned out significant in the case of\nteacher reports.\nDISCUSSION\nThe purpose of the current investigation was to test the\nNorwegian hypothesis that the COMT genotype moderates the\ndevelopmental legacy of disorganization vis-a-vis aggression and\nsocial competence during childhood in specific ways. Recall that\nHygen et al. (2014) hypothesized that Val/Val homozygotes with\nhistories of disorganization would exhibit more negative behavior\nas well as less positive behavior compared with their organized\ncounterparts, seemingly reflecting a controlling-punitive style,\nwhereas Met carriers would evince just the opposite pattern,\nsuch that those who were classified as disorganized would\nexhibit less negative and more positive behavior than non-\ndisorganized/organized children, seemingly consistent with a\ncontrolling-caregiving style. Moreover, they predicted that such\nLi et al.   and COMT Interaction\nTABLE 3 | Sensitivity analyses of the effects of Attachment Disorganization, COMT and their interaction on the mother- and teacher-report ratings when\nPositive composite Negative composite\nParameter Estimate (SE) t (p) Estimate (SE) t (p)\nTabled values are as follows: Estimate (SE) = point estimate of the parameter, with its associated standard error in parentheses; t (p) = t value for the point estimate, with the p-level of\nthe t statistic in parentheses.

Recall, too, that the Norwegian investigators found\nsupport for their predictions only when looking at change over\ntime in child functioning across the transition to school rather\nthan at level of functioning prior to and following the school\ntransition.\nHere we sought to carry out a conceptual rather than exact\nreplication of the original Norwegian hypothesis, focusing on\nthe prediction from attachment at age 15 months to children's\nfuture functioning, first at the start of school and then 6 years\nlater. In contrast to the Norwegians' reliance on a doll-play\nprocedure administered at age four to measure disorganization,\nwe employed the gold standard, Strange Situation at 15 months,\nrelying on both the categorical and continuous measurement of\ndisorganization. And, drawing on data from the NICHD Study\nof Early Child Care and Youth Development, we employed\na confirmatory and competitive model-fitting approach that\ndirectly tested the anticipated and complex patterning of data\npredicted by the Norwegian hypothesis, while contrasting the\nhypothesized model with alternative ones (i.e., full and the\ncomparison models). Of most importance, then, was not whether\none or another component of the complex model was itself\nstatistically significant, but whether the overall patterning of\nthe data collectively proved consistent with predictions derived\nfrom the Norwegian hypothesis--and whether it did so when\nalternative parameterizations of disorganization and COMT were\nused.\nModel-fit statistics, including those derived from robustness\nchecks, like inspection of the graphs presented in the\nfigures, indicated that Val/Val homozygotes with histories\nof disorganization in infancy exhibited--or tended to exhibit--\nmore negative behavior as well as less positive behavior in\nkindergarten (as reported by mother) compared with their\norganized counterparts, seemingly reflecting a controlling-\npunitive style. In contrast, Met-carriers displayed--or tended\nto display--just the opposite pattern, such that those who\nwere classified as disorganized in infancy exhibited less\nmother-rated negative and more positive behavior than non-\ndisorganized/organized children, seemingly consistent with a\ncontrolling-caregiving style. Just as importantly, genetic-group\ndifferences did not emerge in the case of children with organized\nattachment histories, nor did any genetic-group differences\nemerge in the case of teacher reports of child behavior for\neither non-disorganized or disorganized children. Notably,\nthis complex patterning of results emerged quite similarly\nregardless of whether COMT was coded as a 2-level variable\nLi et al.   and COMT Interaction\nTABLE 4 | Results of Sensitivity Analysis of Effects of the Attachment Disorganization by COMT gene interaction on the parent and teacher-report child\noutcomes in kindergarten and Grade 6(COMT: 3- level coding; Disorganization measured continuously) (N = 558).\nPositive composite Negative composite\nParameter Mother-reports Teacher-reports Mother-reports Teacher-reports\nEstimate (SE) t (p) Estimate (SE) t (p) Estimate (SE) t (p) Estimate (SE) t (p)\nKINDERGARTEN\nTabled values are from the four-parameter linear COMT X linear disorganization model in which intercept and slope values for the heterozygotes Met/Val group were constrained to\nbe right in the middle between the corresponding values for the homozygous (i.e., Met/Met and Val/Val) groups. Tabled values are as follows: Estimate (SE) = point estimate of the\nparameter, with its associated standard error in parentheses; t (p) = t value for the point estimate, with the p-level of the t statistic in parentheses. The four rows for A1, B1, A3, and B3\nrefer to parameters in Equation 2 based on results from the linear X linear model (A1and B1, intercept and slope for the Met/Met homozygotes, respectively; A3and B3, intercept and\nslope for the Val/Val homozygotes, respectively. For the linear X linear model, the intercept and slope for Met/Val heterozygotes were the averaged intercept and slope between Met/Met\nand Val/Val). The row labeled A1 = A3 reports results of a test that A1 is equal to A3, consistent with the hypothesized model; and the row labeled B1 = B3 reports results of a test that\nB1 is equal to B3, consistent with the comparison model. The BIC values reported for the two alternative models are the mean BIC for the model, with SD of BIC values across the 100\nimputation samples in parentheses.\n(Met carrier vs. Val/Val) or 3-level variable (Met/Met vs. Met/Val\nvs. Val/Val), whether disorganization was coded categorically (D\nvs. not D) or continuously (using the D rating), and whether\nchild behavior was predicted at kindergarten or Grade 6. To\nbe noted, however, is that even with the large sample available\nfor analysis, there were only a limited number of children with\ndisorganized attachment histories. This resulted in even smaller\nsubgroups of disorganized children when genotype was taken\ninto consideration. In light of this limitation of small cell sizes,\nit seems notable that results proved strikingly similar when\nthe continuous measure of disorganization was used in the\nsecondary analyses.\nThe data from the both the primary and sensitivity analyses\nfit the Hygen et al. (2014) hypothesis that COMT would\nmoderate the effect of attachment disorganization in a manner\nthat could account for the divergent ways in which children\nmanifesting disorganized attachments have been found to behave\ntoward their mothers (controlling-caregiving vs. controlling-\npunitive). Having said that, it should be appreciated that the\nactual effect size of the COMT-X-disorganization interaction\nwas small in magnitude at both kindergarten and 6th grade.\nGiven that the interaction was anticipated and that GXE\nfindings have proven challenging to replicate, even conceptually,\nwe regard the results as meaningful. Nevertheless, what\nremains difficult to understand is why the targeted COMT-\nX-disorganization interaction only predicted change over time\nin the original Norwegian research and not levels of child\nbehavior at either 4 or 6 years. Here, though, we found\nin our primary analyses that when disorganization was (a)\nmeasured categorically rather than continuously, (b) using\nthe gold-standard Strange Situation rather than a story-stem\ncompletion task, and (c) at 15 months rather than at 4 years\nof age, that levels of kindergarten social behavior reported\n(only) by mothers could be accounted for by considering the\nmoderation by COMT of attachment disorganization. Quite\nconceivably, these measurement and design differences across\nstudies are responsible for the differences in findings across the\ntwo studies.\nIn any event, reasonably consistent support for the Norwegian\nhypothesis emerged in both inquiries as to why some children\nwith disorganized attachment histories behave in seemingly\ncontrolling-caregiving and others in controlling-punitive ways.\nEspecially notable, perhaps, is that in both studies the genetically-\nrelated divergent patterns of functioning are restricted to\nLi et al.   and COMT Interaction\nFIGURE 3 | Sensitivity analyses: COMT X disorganization interaction pattern for Grade 6 mother-reported positive and negative child behavior (\"0\" =\norganized; \"1\" = disorganized).

This could reflect the frightening experiences\nthat children with disorganized attachment histories have\nhad with their parents, but not with their teachers (e.g.,\nAlternative explanation of these relationship-specific findings)\nis that the detected gene -X-disorganization interaction might\nactually reflect passive gene -X-environment association. Recall,\nhowever, that this rGE possibility was discounted in the\ncurrent study in that we (a) ruled out the association\nbetween Disorganization category (D vs. Not-D) and COMT\ngenotype (Met carriers vs. Val/Val) and (b) detected no\nassociation between parent behavior (i.e., maternal sensitivity\nat both 6 and 15 months) and child COMT genotype\n(two levels and three levels) (see Supplemental Material,\nIt is important to appreciate that our focus on COMT\nshould not be read to imply that only this polymorphism may\nplay a moderating role vis-\u00e0-vis the effects of disorganization.\nRather, we focused exclusively on this candidate gene because\nwe conceptualized this inquiry from its inception as an attempt\nto test an intriguing and most original hypothesis and, thereby,\nLi et al.   and COMT Interaction\nFIGURE 4 | Sensitivity analyses: COMT X disorganization interaction pattern for Kindergarten mother-reported positive and negative child behavior.\nNote: This set of sensitivity analyses used ternary COMT coding (i.e., Val/Val, Met/Val and Met/Met) and continuous disorganization ratings (\"0\" = organized, \"8\" =\nmost disorganized).\nconceptually replicate and extend the work of Hygen et al.\n(2014). Moreover, it would be a mistake to presume that it is\nthe action of COMT per se that accounts for the moderation\ndetected, because COMT could function--statistically--as a\nmoderator in this inquiry due to its association with some other\ngene that plays a truly functional role. Nevertheless, the fact\nthat the COMT Val158Met gene regulates the degradation of\ndopamine in the PFC (Karoum et al., 1994; Lachman et al.,\ndopamine metabolism in this brain region, provides biological\nplausibility as to why variation in COMT appears to account\nfor variation in the functioning of children with histories of\ndisorganized attachment, at least from the perspective of their\nmothers.\nLi et al.   and COMT Interaction\nFIGURE 5 | Sensitivity analyses: COMT X disorganization interaction pattern for Grade six mother-reported positive and negative child behavior. Note:\nThis set of sensitivity analyses used ternary COMT coding (i.e., Val/Val, Met/Val and Met/Met) and continuous disorganization ratings (\"0\" = organized, \"8\" = most\ndisorganized).\nCONCLUSION\nRecent years have witnessed an outpouring of concern regarding\nthe replicability of scientific findings (Jasny et al., 2011; Ryan,\n2011). Perhaps nowhere has this issue emerged so forcefully\nin the human behavioral sciences as in research involving\nmeasured genes. Our current inquiry was motivated precisely\nby this concern for replication, which includes \"conceptual\nreplications\" like that carried out here. That is, our replication\nof Hygen et al. (2014) did not involve repeating exactly what\nwas done in their prior work; instead, it was directly informed\nby the Hygen et al. (2014) study in terms of structuring a\nresearch question, hypotheses, and analyses, albeit with certain\nvariables that differed operationally, but not conceptually, from\nthe Norwegian research. Indeed, we jumped at the opportunity\nto test the Norwegian hypothesis involving the interaction of\none candidate gene, COMT, and disorganization once the initial\ntest of it received some support. We regarded conceptual--as\nopposed to exact--replication as important because the real issue\nis not simply--or only--whether specific findings tied to specific\nmeasurements evaluated in a seemingly identical sample can be\nrepeated, but whether the more general finding can be detected\nagain using related, even if not exactly the same, measurements\nor design. Indeed, it is exactly this reasoning that undergirds\nvirtually all meta-analyses.\nIt would, of course, be mistaken to claim that our conceptual\nreplication of the Hygen et al. (2014) inquiry entirely resolves\nthe issue of why some disorganized children develop in one\nway--or at least develop certain kinds of relationships with their\nmothers which take one form--rather than another. Indeed, the\nLi et al.   and COMT Interaction\nfact that variation in COMT accounts for some variation in how\ndisorganized infants develop should not be read to imply that\nother factors, including perhaps especially, parental behavior,\nare not important. We would strongly encourage investigators\nto adopt, as we have endeavored to, statistical techniques that\ndirectly fit the statistical glove to the theoretical/conceptual hand\nrather than opting for more traditional exploratory approaches.\nZL was involved in statistical analyses, result interpretation and\ndrafting the manuscript.
