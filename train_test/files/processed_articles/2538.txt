Introduction\nIn most developing countries, there is a large sector of the economy that is called the\ninformal sector or the unorganized sector. Employment in the informal labour market\nplays an important role in most developing economies. Very broadly, the informal\nlabour market consists of workers in the informal sector, plus casual workers in the\nformal sector. The informal labour market is a very large part of the agricultural sector,\nbut is also a significant part of the urban sector. There is a difference between employ-\nment in the formal sector and the informal sector in terms of the conditions of work,\nwhether workers are subject to government taxes, have access to social security or in-\nsurance, are casual or contract workers, and whether or not they receive the minimum\nThe informal economy is a very important sector of the Indian economy.

One segment\nis the formal sector composed of workers who have salaried work, good working con-\nditions, and are employed in organised business. The other segment is the informal\neconomy consisting of small self-employed traders and business people, and casual\nworkers in the informal or formal sectors. Some individuals are born into wealthy\nfamilies who own large businesses and hence are in the formal sector by right of birth.\nOthers who are born with parents from the professional classes would almost certainly\nhave education from good schools and universities, and have a network of contacts that\nwould ensure their joining the ranks of the employed in the formal sector. Some indi-\nviduals may have built up sufficient assets over time to set up small businesses and\nhence enter the formal sector. However, most workers in the formal sector enter the\nsector through their educational achievements, or by birth (children of rich people) and\nthrough social networks. For someone who comes from a disadvantageous background\n(either in terms of income or belonging to a socially backward caste or religion) the\nonly way to enter the formal sector is via education in \"good\" schools3 or universities.\nEven with a good education, entry into the formal sector is often based on family con-\nnections. The Indian government has for some time had a policy of positive discri-\nmination for the Dalits, and as a result they may have a higher probability of finding a\njob in the formal (government) sector. Migrants (especially from rural areas) who come\ninto urban areas would likely have to work in the informal sector for some time before\nthey build good networks enabling them to move into the formal sector.\nThe literature on the role of the informal sector in developing countries has oscillated\nbetween treating the informal sector as a backward sector that is holding back eco-\nnomic development to a dynamic sector that is helping to develop the economy rapidly\nwithout straining foreign currency balances and with relatively low demands for (real)\nThe informal sector is considered to be a pre-capitalist form of production compared\nto the formal sector which is a profit maximising capitalist sector. There is a large vol-\nume of literature on rural\u00adurban migration (see, Harris and Todaro (1970)) that\nexamines migrants arriving in the city and initially finding work in the informal sector,\nthen moving on to better paid work in the formal sector. Fields (2009) developed an\nearly model of the informal sector as a \"way station\" along the path toward a formal\njob in urban areas (De Mel et al. (2010)) which has been followed by others. This view\nof the informal sector as a temporary abode for migrants has been disputed (among\nothers) by Mazumdar (1976). The debate has also ranged over whether informal sector\nworkers are living in poor conditions with low incomes, or whether some of the infor-\nmal sector workers are there out of choice and have a comfortable life (see Meng 2001,\nPerry 2007). Some individuals may have employment in the formal sector and work in\nthe informal sector as well.\nGiven the setup of the urban labour market in India, some of the important issues to\ninvestigate are (1) whether individuals working in the informal sector are migrants and\nwhether they move out of the informal sector into the formal sector after a few years;\n(2) whether they are from disadvantaged social and ethnic groups who do not have\nsocial networks to enter the formal sector; and finally (3) whether those with low levels\nof education and skills are unable to enter formal sector employment and have to find\nShonchoy and Junankar IZA Journal of Labor & Development Page 2 of 27\nhttp://www.izajold.com/content/3/1/9\nThis paper is interested in studying the characteristics of the workers in the informal\neconomy and whether migrants treat this sector as a permanent base or only as a tempor-\nary location before moving on to the organised or formal sector to improve their lifetime\nincome and lifestyle. We limit our study to the Indian urban (non-agricultural) sector and\nstudy the characteristics of the household heads that belong to the informal sector\n(self-employed and informal wage workers) and the formal sector. We find that members\nwho come from the lower social groups (castes and religions) are more likely to be in the\ninformal sector. We distinguish between migrants in urban location who came from rural\nareas and those who came from other urban areas. We find that rural migrant's likelihood\nof staying in the informal wage labour sector is inversely related to the length of time a\nrural migrant spends in an urban area.\nIn Section 2 below, we clarify the definition of informal labour markets and briefly\nreview the literature; Section 3 provides a detailed discussion of the properties of the\nurban informal sector in India; Section 4 discusses the lexicographic preferences that\npeople have over formal sector, self-employment, and informal wage labour; Section 5\nsets up an econometric model for estimating the probability of working in the informal\nsector and provides some results, while Section 6 provides results using a multivariate\nlogit model; Section 7 concludes with a summary of the results. In general, we find\nthat the longer the duration of a migrant in the urban sector the more likely s/he will\nhave moved out of the informal sector.\n2. The informal labour market: definitions and a review of some earlier\nstudies\nIn the developing country context, the informal sector is sometimes defined in\nterms of the activities of the enterprises (ILO, 1972) and sometimes in terms of\nthe kind of work done by individuals as employees or as self-employed people\n(Hart, 1973). There exists great heterogeneity in informality: there is the \"intra-firm\nmargin where firms may be partly formal and partly informal, the inter-sectoral\nmargin between formal and informal firms, and the inter-sectoral margin of formal\nand informal workers operating through the labour market\" Perry et al. (2007).\nThe International Labour Organisation (1972) characterised the informal sector as:\n(a) Ease of entry\n(b) Reliance on indigenous resources\n(c) Family ownership of enterprise\n(d) Small scale of operation, often defined in terms of hired workers less than (say) ten\n(e) Labour-intensive methods of production and adapted technology\n(f) Skills acquired outside the formal school system\n(g) Unregulated and competitive markets\nWhereas the formal sector was characterised by:\n(a) Difficult entry\n(b) Frequent reliance on overseas resources\n(c) Corporate ownership\nShonchoy and Junankar IZA Journal of Labor & Development Page 3 of 27\nhttp://www.izajold.com/content/3/1/9\n(d) Large scale of operation\n(e) Capital-intensive and often imported technology\n(f) Formally acquired skills, often expatriate\n(g) Protected markets (through tariffs, quotas, and licenses)\nHart (1973) discussed the informal sector in terms of the working conditions of the\nindividuals and whether they worked for wages with good conditions or informally as\nself-employed workers. Informal activities included:\n(a) Farming, market gardening, self employed artisans, shoemakers, tailors, etc.\n(b) Working in construction, housing, road building\n(c) Small scale distribution, e.g. petty traders, street hawkers, etc.\n(d) Other services, e.g. barbers, shoe-shiners etc.\n(e) Beggars\n(f) Illegal activities like drug pushing\nFormal sector income earning activities included:\n(a) Public sector wage earners\n(b) Private sector wage earners (on permanent contracts, not casual workers)\nSengupta (2009), p. 3 defined the informal economy thus:\nThe unorganised sector consists of all unincorporated private enterprises owned\nby individuals or households engaged in the sale and production of goods and\nservices operated on a proprietary or partnership basis and with less than ten total\nworkers.\n2.2 Informal worker/employment\nUnorganised workers consist of those working in the unorganised sector or households,\nexcluding regular workers with social security benefits provided by employers and the\nworkers in the formal sector without any employment and social security benefits\nprovided by employers.\n2.3 Informal economy\nThe informal sector and its workers plus the informal workers in the formal sector\nconstitute the informal economy.\n3. The Indian informal labour market: some background information\nA recent report of the National Commission for Enterprises in the Unorganised Sector\nby the Government of India (Sengupta 2009) found that 86% of the total employment\nin 2004\u00ad2005 was in the informal sector. Further, the agricultural sector consisted\nalmost entirely of informal workers. The non-agricultural workers in the informal\nShonchoy and Junankar IZA Journal of Labor & Development Page 4 of 27\nhttp://www.izajold.com/content/3/1/9\n2004\u00ad2005 most of the increase in employment in the formal sector consisted of infor-\n67% in urban areas worked in the informal sector. It found that the informal sector\nactivities are concentrated mainly in the manufacturing, construction, wholesale and\nretail trades, and transport, storage and communication industries.\nOur study used data from the India Human Development Survey (IHDS) 2005, con-\nducted by the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research, Ann Arbor,\nMichigan, USA. The survey is a nationally representative, multi-topic survey of 41,554\nhouseholds in 1,503 villages and 971 urban neighbourhoods across India. The data set\nhas detailed information on household employment by industry and occupation, and\ndetailed information about household characteristics including age, education, ethnicity,\nreligion, and migration status. In this study we have limited our analysis to workers in\nthe urban sector who are not engaged in any agricultural activities.\nOur data-set consisted of 12,056 heads of households for whom we had data on their\nage, education, marital status, gender, religion, caste, income source, assets, migration\nstatus and years since migration into the urban sector.\nWe define the urban informal sector as artisans, petty traders, small business people (who\ndo not hire any labour), and non-agricultural casual workers in the informal or formal\nsectors. The informal sector consists of the self-employed and informal wage labour. We\ndefine self-employment as petty traders who do not hire any workers and those in the orga-\nnised trade/business category who do not hire any workers. Note that this is a stricter\ndefinition than that suggested by, for example, Sengupta (2009). The informal wage labour\ncategory covers those who are in the informal sector but are not self-employed, i.e., the\nartisans, and non-agricultural labourers who are casually employed. The formal sector\nconsists of salaried employees, professionals, and organised trade/business people who hire\nworkers. In our study we limited our analysis to only the heads of the representative house-\nholds. The summary statistics of our sample is depicted in Table 1.\nIt is interesting to notice the industry and occupational distribution of the formal and\ninformal sectors of the economy in our sample data (see Figure 1). Most of the informal\nwage labour is in manufacturing, construction, wholesale and retail trades, restaurants, and\nhotels, and in community, social and personal services. Self-employment is concentrated\n(not surprisingly) in the wholesale and retail trades, restaurants, and hotels. Informal wage\nlabour is concentrated in occupations: production and related workers, transport equipment\noperators and labourers (presumably unskilled workers) (see Figure 2).\nIf we look at the distribution of migrants moving into these sectors, (see Figure 3) we\nfind that 61% of the migrants work in the formal sector; almost 10% are self-employed\nentrepreneurs and 29% are informal wage workers.\nA high proportion of migrants (28%) are working primarily in the community,\npersonal and social services, 23% in wholesale and retail trades, restaurants and hotels,\nand 28% in manufacturing (see Figure 4).\nA high proportion of migrants (30%) are employed as production and related\nworkers, transport equipment operators and labourers while almost 29% are sales and\nservice workers (see Figure 5). It is interesting to note that the main income source for\nmigrants (50.14%) is salaried employment; another 21.09% are in non-agricultural\nlabour (see Figures 6).\nShonchoy and Junankar IZA Journal of Labor & Development Page 5 of 27\nhttp://www.izajold.com/content/3/1/9\nTable 1 Summary statistics\nFormal Informal Total\nShonchoy and Junankar IZA Journal of Labor & Development Page 6 of 27\nhttp://www.izajold.com/content/3/1/9\nThe caste and religion breakdown for the formal and informal sectors (self-employed\nand informal wage labour) show interesting patterns. As one would suspect, Brahmins\nand people belong to high caste are more likely to be in the formal sector, compared to\nthe lower social castes and Muslims. If we divert our attention to the distribution of\npeople by caste and religion based on the principal source of household income, as\ndepicted in Table 2, we see that Brahmins and people belong to high caste are more\nlikely to be salaried workers or professionals, whilst Dalits and Muslims are more likely\nto be non-agricultural labourers or artisans (see Figure 7).\nWhen we look at the distribution of occupations by caste and religion, as depicted in\nTable 3, we note that Brahmins and high caste people are more likely to be in the\nhigher level occupations, while Dalits and Muslims are more likely to be in the lower\nlevel occupations.\nTable 1 Summary statistics (Continued)\nFigure 1 Distribution of employment across industries.\nShonchoy and Junankar IZA Journal of Labor & Development Page 7 of 27\nhttp://www.izajold.com/content/3/1/9\nFigure 2 Distribution of households across occupations.\nFigure 3 Employment category based on migration status.\nShonchoy and Junankar IZA Journal of Labor & Development Page 8 of 27\nhttp://www.izajold.com/content/3/1/9\nFigure 4 Migrants by industry.\nFigure 5 Migrants by occupation.\nShonchoy and Junankar IZA Journal of Labor & Development Page 9 of 27\nhttp://www.izajold.com/content/3/1/9\n4. The informal economy: some analytical features\nWe assume that individuals would, in general, prefer to work in the formal sector,\neither as employees or as owners/managers5. This is based on the idea that the formal\nsector provides a better life not only in terms of present and future income, but also in\nterms of better working conditions (e.g., security of tenure, social security benefits,\naccess to unions, safer working conditions). If they are unable to enter the formal sec-\ntor, we assume that they would prefer to be self-employed (as long as their expected in-\ncomes are not below that in the informal wage sector). Employees in the informal wage\nsector would prefer to become self-employed if they have access to credit to set up\nsmall businesses. Many of them may simply be \"waiting\" for a job in the formal sector.\nIn the Harris-Todaro model, rural migrants come to the urban areas as long as their\nexpected wages (urban wage multiplied by the probability of finding a job) are greater\nFigure 6 Migrants and income source.\nTable 2 Caste and religion by source of income\nNon-Ag labour Artisan Petty traders Business Salaried Professionals Total\nSource: India Human Development Survey.\nShonchoy and Junankar IZA Journal of Labor & Development Page 10 of 27\nhttp://www.izajold.com/content/3/1/9\nthan their rural subsistence wage. Migrants who do not find work in the urban formal\nsector then enter the urban informal sector which is meant to be a form of \"wait un-\nemployment\"6. Essentially, we are arguing that individuals have lexicographic pre-\nferences over these choices. However, what we observe is a reduced form depending on\nthe household head's choice and success in the formal labour market, and the con-\nstraints in the credit market that determine whether s/he can become self-employed.\nInformal wage labour then is a residual category.\nIn fact if we look at the actual income (based on our sample), we find that the\nincomes of these three groups overlap to some extent, with the lowest income being in\ninformal wage labour, followed by self-employment, followed by formal sector income.\nFigure 8 presents the kernel densities of the logs of informal wage labour, informal self-\nFigure 7 Caste and religion by sector.\nTable 3 Caste and religion by occupation\nBrahmin High\ncaste\nOBC Dalit Adivasi Muslim Sikh,\nJain\nChristian Total\nProfessions, Technical and\nRelated Workers\nAdministrative, Executive\nand Managerial Workers\nProduction, Transport\nand Labourers\nSource: India Human Development Survey.\nShonchoy and Junankar IZA Journal of Labor & Development Page 11 of 27\nhttp://www.izajold.com/content/3/1/9\nemployment, and formal income respectively. As can be seen, informal wage-labour\nincome is distributed to the left, informal self-employment income is in the middle,\nand formal income is to the right of the other distributions. There is some overlap at\nthe lower tails of the distributions, but self-employment and formal incomes have tails\nspread out at the higher income levels7.\nA Kolmogorov-Smirnov test reveals that there are significant differences in these ker-\nnel densities. (All pair-wise Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests are statistically significant with a\np-value of 0.000). Table 4 provides some summary statistics to illustrate the differences\nin the distribution of incomes. As discussed above, the mean (log) income in the formal\nsector is greater than that for the self-employed and that is greater than that for infor-\nmal wage labour. The only curious result seems to be that the minimum of the formal\nsector is lower than that of the other two groups.\nTo be in the formal sector, domestic capitalists need to have significant amounts of\ncapital and access to credit. Inheritance plays a large part in providing either the ori-\nginal capital or access to credit. Multinationals come in with large amounts of capital\nwith technology that is labour saving (embodied technological change). Employment in\nthe formal sector is then limited by the use of imported technology and limited\namounts of capital. Note that only a limited amount of labour-capital substitution is\npossible because of embodied technology.\nFigure 8 Kernel densities of log income by employment.\nTable 4 Distribution of log incomes by sector\nVariable: log of income Obs.

Employers in the formal sector ration employment by using education/experi-\nence as an index of productivity, and using religion/caste as a signal for productivity\n(statistical discrimination). Given two people with the same education/skill levels, they\nwould prefer a high caste Hindu to a low caste Hindu or a Muslim. Note: being in the\nformal economy is not a guarantee against poverty see (ILO 2002), p.31.\nInformal sector employment is a residual; the lower the employment in the formal\nsector, the greater the number who look for work in the informal sector, and hence, the\nlower the wages (income) for this sector.\nFigure 9 below shows that 43% of the self-employed have taken out loans for business\npurposes, compared to only 14% in the formal sector and 16% in the informal wage\nlabour group. It is clear that the self-employed have to take out loans for setting up\nand running a small enterprise. Presumably many of the informal wage workers would\nbe interested in setting up a small business but are unable to access credit.\nTo summarise this section, we argue that households have a lexicographic preference\nordering over the different outcomes, formal, self-employment, or informal wage\nlabour. Migrants, especially rural migrants, have little access to credit or to the formal\nlabour market, at least until they have spent some years in the urban sector.\n5. Probability of working in the informal sector\nIn this section we estimate the probability of a household head working in the informal\nwage employment sector to be self-employed or in the formal sector. As discussed\nearlier, we make three hypotheses. One is that those households that come from the\nFigure 9 Purpose of loan by sector.\nShonchoy and Junankar IZA Journal of Labor & Development Page 13 of 27\nhttp://www.izajold.com/content/3/1/9\nlower social classes/groups are more likely to be working in the informal sector. Some\nof these households may have the entrepreneurial skills or have access to small\namounts of capital to set up as self-employed workers. We also hypothesise that house-\nholds coming from higher social classes/groups, and/or that have higher levels of\neducation are more likely to be working in the formal sector. Further we hypothesise\nthat migrants who come into the urban areas would initially find employment in the\ninformal sector and after some time, when they have accumulated sufficient funds or\ndeveloped social networks or skills, are more likely to move into the formal sector. In\nour analysis below we regard migrants as those whose origin is in a rural area. Individ-\nuals who have come from other urban areas are regarded as \"urban natives\". We\nhypothesise that the duration of migration from a rural origin influences the sector of\nemployment.\n5.1 Econometrics and identification strategy\nThe fundamental challenge of estimating the causal impact of migration duration on\nthe probability of working in the informal sector is the possibility of unobserved indi-\nvidual characteristics that might influence the migration decision, survival in a migra-\ntion destination, and the duration as well as the likelihood of working in the informal\nsector. For example, it might be possible that individuals with unobserved high ability\nor entrepreneurial skills might opt to move out of the rural area early in their life and\nremain in the urban area, and such unobserved skills and ability will also influence\ntheir choice of sector in the migration destination. Without controlling for this, estima-\ntion may be biased and inconsistent.\nIf we had panel data, we could have used methods to control for individual hetero-\ngeneity. Another ideal method that could be used to disentangle such unobserved in-\nfluences on migration duration and job status would be by using some natural\nexperimental framework or by randomly inducing people to migrate out of rural areas\nto estimate the causal impact of migration on job choice. Lacking the availability of\nsuch methods, we need to opt for an instrumental variable approach (IV) where we can\ninstrument migration duration with a set of variables which do not have a direct in-\nfluence on job placement or current job status.\nOne recent method to instrument for migration is using the historic migration rate\nas an instrument for current migration status for example see, (Woodruff and Zenteno\nC\u00f3rdoba (2005); and Hildebrandt and McKenzie (2005)). Following the methodology of\nthese influential works, we have used the historic state-level migration rates as an in-\nstrument for current migration duration. In particular, we use the Indian migration\nrates from data collected in the 1991 census at the state level and use this variable as\nan instrument in which the household is currently located.\nIt can be argued that these historic migration rates are the result of the massive de-\nvelopment of railroads and other transportation systems in India coupled with the rapid\neconomic expansion of large cities which created extended job demand. These historic\nmigration rates can also be considered as signals of migration friendliness, of strong\nmigration networks that can effectively lower the cost of migration for future potential\nmigrants and increase the chances of their survival. These signals and networks become\nShonchoy and Junankar IZA Journal of Labor & Development Page 14 of 27\nhttp://www.izajold.com/content/3/1/9\nself-perpetuating, and as a result, continue to influence the migration decisions of\nhouseholds today.\nOur identifying assumption is that historic state-level migration rates do not affect\nthe current job placement of the individuals, apart from their influence through\ncurrent migration. Instrumental variables estimation relies on this exogeneity\nassumption, and so it is important to consider and counteract potential threats to its\nvalidity.\nOne potential threat is that the historic level of inequality and lower economic class\n(lower caste and religious groups) could induce the historic migration rate, and that\nthey are also influencing the current rate due to intergenerational transition. To tackle\nthese potential pitfalls, we also used interaction terms of historic migration rate with\nthe caste dummies as additional instruments. We have also controlled for city, district\nand state level fixed effects to control for spatial differences and location preferences,\nand report our results based on robust standard errors clustered at the individual level.\nAn alternative set of instruments would be to use the state level growth rates of GDP\nas this would capture the potential pull factor of migration8. The idea of this in-\nstrumental variable is deep-rooted in the history of Indian economic development and\ngenerated with the aim to capture the post-liberalization of India in 1992. Since state-\nlevel GDP has large heterogeneity, migration decisions of individuals would be based\non comparing likely destinations with income potentialities, therefore could act as an\ninstrument. As a robustness check, we have reported regression estimates based on the\nalternative instrumental variable in all result tables. To increase the precision of our\nestimation, we also estimated the equations using the additional set of instruments by\nemploying the state-level GDP growth rate of India in 1994 interacted with caste dummies.\nAs our main outcome of interest is whether migrants use the informal sector as their\ntemporary base (like a stepping stone), we studied the impact of migration duration of\nindividuals on their placement in the informal sector. The reduced form IV approach\nconsists of estimating a two-stage model of the following form, where Ij\nis the outcome\nvariable of interest (individual j's current employment sector), Mjk\nis individual j's\nmigration duration, and who is currently staying in State k (years of migration since\noriginally migrating), and Zk\nis the set of instrumental variables.

Similarly, I\u00c3\nik\nis the latent job placement and Ijk\nis the dummy of job placement in the formal and informal sectors for the same\nShonchoy and Junankar IZA Journal of Labor & Development Page 15 of 27\nhttp://www.izajold.com/content/3/1/9\nindividual j living in state k which can be seen arising by comparing the job qualifica-\ntions and job related network information (such as informal or formal referral system)\nrequired for the job placement expressed in equation (2). In this setup the first\ndependent variable, Mjk\n, appears in the second equation as an endogenous variable.\nHere, Xjk\nincludes the following set of controls: personal and household characteristics,\nfamily background information, family composition information and dependency ratio\n(the number of children and old aged persons as a proportion of the household size)9,\nreligion, and a dummy variable indicating whether or not the person is an urban native\n(the dummy is equal to one if the individual i who currently resides in state k is born\nin an urban area and zero if the person is a rural-to-urban migrant). Personal charac-\nteristics include age, age2, sex, education and marital information, whereas household\ncharacteristics include wealth status of the household which has been constructed using\nthe principal component analysis of the household non-durable assets10. Dependency\nratio of the household is also controlled for, which is the number of children and old\naged persons as a proportion of household size11.

In addition we included state, district and city-level fixed effects to\ncapture unobserved geographical and regional impacts on an individual's job place-\nment in the informal sector.

Column (1)-(4) depict\nthe estimations using historic migration rate based IV whereas Column (5)-(8) used\nthe economic growth based IV to show the consistency of our estimations. For\nrobustness check of our estimations, we used full sample (column 1\u00ad2 and column\n5\u00ad6) as well as male only sub-samples, (column 3\u00ad4 and column 7\u00ad8). In all re-\ngressions, using different sub-samples and different IVs, our results are largely con-\nsistent and none of the variables changed sign. We reported the marginal effects of\nall estimations in columns (2), (4), (6) and (8) respectively. To show consistency in\nour estimation, we have also estimated a simple probit model without treating the\nduration of migration as endogenous, shown in column (9). The probit result\nshows a small and negative but statistically insignificance impact of migration du-\nration on probability of someone being in the informal sector. Once we instrument\nfor migration duration in columns (1)-(8), however, this effect becomes larger and\nShonchoy and Junankar IZA Journal of Labor & Development Page 16 of 27\nhttp://www.izajold.com/content/3/1/9\nTable 5 IV-Probit estimates of the probability for informal sector employment\nIV1: Historical migration rate: state level IV2: Economic growth of 94: State level Simple probit\nFull sample Male only Full sample Male only\nDependent Variable:\nEmployment at Informal\nsector\nCoefficient\nM.E.\nCoefficient\nM.E.\nCoefficient\nM.E.\nCoefficient\nM.E.\nCoefficient\nShonchoy and Junankar IZA Journal of Labor & Development Page 17 of 27\nhttp://www.izajold.com/content/3/1/9\nTable 5 IV-Probit estimates of the probability for informal sector employment (Continued)\nCity Dummies Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes\nDistrict Dummies Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes\nState Dummies Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes\nSource: Indian Human Development Survey 2005: Authors own Calculations.

In all these specifications, we are considering only those as migrant who have migrated from rural to urban areas for jobs. Those who were born in urban setup and migrated to another\nurban area for job are not considered as migrants.\nIn the regression we also control for head of the households age, age squared, sex, asset status and fathers education and occupation.\nShonchoy and Junankar IZA Journal of Labor & Development Page 18 of 27\nhttp://www.izajold.com/content/3/1/9\nstatistically more significant. This result implies that the longer the migrant is stay-\ning in the urban areas, the more likely s/he is to find an employment in the formal\nsector, as the person could acquire experience, networks and skill-sets which could\nbe instrumental in getting a job in the formal sector. Given the fact that some mi-\ngrants have already returned back after realizing their negligible probability of se-\ncuring a formal employment in the urban areas, those who remained in the urban\nareas, prefer formal employment more than the non-migrants and our results show\nthat each additional year of migration time-length increases the probability of\nbeing in the formal sector significantly.\nWe would expect the higher the education of an individual, the lower the pro-\nbability of belonging to the informal sector. Our estimations, see Table 5, show\nclearly that the higher the level of education of the household head the lower the\nprobability of being in the informal sector, and the coefficients get smaller (bigger\nin absolute value) respectively. The results for father's education are very similar\nto the household head's education level. Further, we would expect that if the\nfather of the individual was of a higher social class (in terms of occupation), the\nprobability of being in the informal sector would be lower. Again the evidence\nsupports the view that the parent's occupation clearly influences an individual's\nemployment placement: if the father's occupation is formal in nature like execu-\ntive or clerk, the probability of being in the informal sector is lower, while if the\nfather's occupation is sales (which is mostly informal in nature in the Indian\ncontext), then there is a higher probability of being in the informal sector. As\ndiscussed earlier, we would expect a person from a socially disadvantaged caste or\nreligion more likely to be in the informal sector. Our findings show that OBC\n(Other Backward Classes) and Muslims are more likely to be in the informal\nsector. We did not find any statistically significance for Dalits (the lower social\ncastes) in the informal sector compared with Brahmins, which may be attributable\nto the government's positive discrimination in employment in the government\nsector (reservation system) for Dalits. As we would expect, the wealthier the\nhousehold head, the less likely s/he would be in the informal sector. We found\nthat dependency ration is weakly significant and the sign is negative, suggests that\na higher dependency ratio would lead the person transition out of the informal\nsector into the formal sector as the person would be willing to accept any formal\nsector job offer which enables better security, however, such an issue appears to\nbe not very influential in explaining the probability of being in the informal\nsector.\nOur results suggest that urban natives are more likely to be in the formal sector\nas they have more access to better schools, social networks and job information\nand referrals compared with the rural-to-urban migrants. Our main variable of\ninterest is rural migration duration. In all cases it is negative and significant at the\n1% level. In other words, the longer a rural migrant has been in an urban area the\nmore likely that individual would have moved to the formal sector. (Note the rural\nmigration duration variable has been instrumented).\nThe validity of IV estimations depends on the power of instruments in explaining\nthe predicted values at the first stage. As reported, all the first stage regressions\nhave very high F-statistics (for example, for our preferred specification of column\nShonchoy and Junankar IZA Journal of Labor & Development Page 19 of 27\nhttp://www.izajold.com/content/3/1/9\n1, the first stage F-statistic is 26.91). We have also tested for the joint significance\nof our IVs, and the results overwhelmingly reject the null of no joint significance.\nThe Wald statistic of the exogeneity test has rejected the null hypothesis of no\nendogeneity. We have also tested the instruments using the typical 2SLS models to\ntest for the over-identification test (Anderson canonical correlations test) and\nunder-identification test (Sargan-Hansen test) which have duly supported our\ninstruments.\n6.0 Multinomial estimation (Formal, self-employed and Informal wage)\nIn this section we have separated the informal sector into those who are self-employed\nand those who work in the informal or formal sectors as wage labourers to check\nwhether or not highly qualified individuals are employed in the formal sector and also\nto check if migrants use the informal sector as their temporary base. We did this check\nby employing a multinomial logit job attainment model following the work of Xin\n6.1 Econometric modelling\nStandard neo-classical economic rationality for an individual's job placement (labour\nsupply) is a function of individual endowments and human resources (e.g., level of edu-\ncation and experience). However, other related factors that could also have an impact\non an individual's labour supply, especially in the context of India, could be the family\nsize (Brown et al. 1980), family background, caste and religious affiliation (see for\nexample Banerjee and Knight (1985) or Ito (2009)). Another less frequently studied\nfactor that might be critical is the job related network, for example, job-opening\ninformation, formal and informal channels of job search and referral (see for example\nHolzer 1987 or Calv\u00f3-Armengol and Zenou (2005)). Since urban natives usually have a\nbetter endowment of job-related networks and referrals, we could hypothesise that\nmigrants will acquire access to such networks as their migration duration increases and\nhence are less likely to be in informal wage labour.\nA multinomial logit model is specified below to capture how these variables will\ninfluence an individual j's probability of working in sector s. Formally the model is:\nPjs\n\u00bc prob yj\n\u00bc sectors\n \n\u00bc\nj\ns\nXS\nj\nl\nj \u00bc 1; ......; N; s \u00bc 1; ......; S: \u00f03\u00de\nwhere N is the size of the sample, S is the number of sectors and xj\nis a vector of vari-\nables affecting the labour placement outcome yj\n. The dependent variable yj\nfor equation\n(3) is the nature of an individual's current job in any of the three sectors: formal sector,\nself-employment or informal wage labour sector. Our main variable of interest, years of\nmigration duration, is endogenous in nature. Hence to allow for the endogeneity in\nestimating equation (3), we first used the fitted value of migration duration using all\nthe instruments (estimation done through OLS). In the second step we used the fitted\nvalue of the migration duration in equation 3. The standard errors of the estimates in\nthe second step have been estimated through a bootstrapping process with 100\nreplications.\nShonchoy and Junankar IZA Journal of Labor & Development Page 20 of 27\nhttp://www.izajold.com/content/3/1/9\nThe results of marginal effects of endogenous multinomial probit estimations are\nreported in Table 6 with full sample and in Table 7 with male only sub-sample. The\ndependent variable has been categorized into three groups with formal sector employ-\nment being used as a base category. Column (1)-(3) report the estimations using the\nhistoric migration rate as an IV whereas column (4)-(6) are estimated employing\nstate-level economic growth of 1994 as IV.\nTables 6 and 7 are broadly similar to those reported in Section 5 of the IV-probit\nmodel (Table 5). For both the self-employed and informal wage labour sectors, educa-\ntion, father's characteristics, and the caste and religion coefficients have essentially the\nsame signs and significance. The main point of difference is that a rural migrant's\nduration of migration does not significantly influence the probability of being in the\nself-employed sector, but is negative and significant for the informal wage labour sector\nand positive and significant for formal employment. In other words, we find that the\nlonger a rural migrant has been in the urban sector the less likely he would be in infor-\nmal wage employment and more likely to be in the formal sector. For instance, an indi-\nvidual with one additional year's of migration duration from the rural area reduces his/\nher probability to be in informal wage employment by 2.9% and increases the proba-\nbility of being in the formal employment by about 3%. However, this variable has no\nstatistically discernible effect on him/her being in the self-employed sectors. Results on\neducation are consistent with the other findings that with more years of education, in-\ndividuals will less likely be in the informal sector and more likely to be in the formal\nsector. In the case of self-employment, education up to the tertiary level does not have\nany statistically significant impact; however, for above tertiary level education, the\nprobability of someone being in self-employed sector is significantly reduced.\nThe validity of multinomial regression lies on the strong assumption of the Indepen-\ndence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA), which means that adding or deleting alternative\noutcome categories does not affect the odds among the remaining outcomes. To check\nwhether this assumption holds in our case, we have performed the test for the IIA\nassumption, and we find no evidence violating the assumption (using the full-sample\nspecification of Table 6).\n7. Conclusions\nIn our paper we have defined migrants as those individuals who have migrated from\nrural to urban areas. Those who were born in urban areas and migrated to another\nurban area are not considered as migrants13. Also note that in our multinomial logit re-\ngressions, for the sake of simplicity of estimation, we used only the rural-to-urban mi-\ngration duration as endogenous and properly took care of such endogenous regression\nby using instruments to predict the fitted value of the variable and plugged in the fitted\nvalue in the final multinomial regression. One could argue, however, that urban-\nto-urban migration could also be endogenous. We have also used urban-to-urban mi-\ngration as endogenous in separate regression estimations in the multinomial logit\nframework (not reported) and in a linear probability model, and in both cases the vari-\nable was insignificant and did not appear to be influential in explaining the likelihood\nof person's placement in the informal labour market.\nShonchoy and Junankar IZA Journal of Labor & Development Page 21 of 27\nhttp://www.izajold.com/content/3/1/9\nTable 6 Marginal effects of multinomial logit regression (full sample)\nIV1: Historic migration rate:\nstate level\nstate level\nFull sample Full sample\nVariables Formal Self\nemployment\nInformal\nwage labour\nFormal Self\nemployment\nInformal\nwage labour\nSource: Indian Human Development Survey 2005: Authors own Calculations.

We found that getting more education is one way of get-\nting a job in the formal sector, but perhaps more important are family networks in pro-\nviding an entry into the formal labour market. We argued that when rural migrants\nmove to the urban sector, they initially find themselves working in the informal sector\nwhere they have low incomes and mostly employed in industries like construction,\nmanufacturing, wholesale and retail trades, restaurants and hotels, transport, and social\nand personal services. Their occupations are mainly in the lower social grades, such as\nproduction and related work, transport, sales and service work, and working as\nlabourers. We noted that caste and religion play important roles for the employment\nand job placement as we see that Brahmins and high caste people are more likely to be\nin higher level occupations, whereas Dalits and Muslims is mostly employed in non-\nagricultural day-labour or as artisans.\nWe argued that there is a hierarchy of preferences that people would prefer to work\nin the formal sector, with the self-employed sector being the second choice, and lastly\nworking in the informal wage labour market. However, entry into the formal sector is\nconstrained by education, social class, and family ties. Self-employment is constrained\nby access to the credit market.\nWe estimated a model of the probability of working in the informal sector as a func-\ntion of demographic characteristics, education, father's education and occupation, caste\nand religion, and duration of a migrant in his/her present occupation. We distinguished\nbetween migrants who had come from rural areas from those who had moved from\nother urban areas. We treated the duration of the migrant as an endogenous variable\nand estimated a two-stage least-squares model. We found that most of the explanatory\nvariables were significant and of the expected signs. In particular, we found that indi-\nvidual's own education as well as father's education and occupational status play signifi-\ncant role in the job placement equation. We also found that Muslims and Other\nBackward Classes were more likely to be working in the informal sector.\nThe most interesting finding of our research is that the length of time a rural migrant\nspends in the urban sector, the more likely s/he moves out of the informal wage sector.\nIn other words, the duration of migration from rural areas is inversely related to the\nprobability of working in the informal sector. This result implies that the longer the\nmigrant is staying in the urban areas, the more likely s/he is to find an employment in\nthe formal sector, as the person could capitalize on his acquired experience, networks\nand skill-sets due to the migration. Since formal employment provides job security,\ninsurance and other facilities, getting a placement in the formal sector appears to be\nmore preferred option for migrants compared with non-migrants. If a migrant realizes\nthat the probability of finding a formal job is really limited, then the person is more\nlikely to return back to the origin quite early, after comparing the cost and benefits of\nholding back in the migration destination. As a result, those who remained in the urban\narea, we find that each additional year of migration duration increases the probability\nof being in the formal sector for migrants by about 3%. Hence, the longer the duration\nin the urban sector the less likely is the migrant to be in the informal sector. The\nresults support the view that for migrants, the informal wage labour market may be a\nstepping stone to a secured life in the formal sector.\nShonchoy and Junankar IZA Journal of Labor & Development Page 24 of 27\nhttp://www.izajold.com/content/3/1/9\nHowever, using a cross-sectional data set to analyse migration and urban employ-\nment is a challenging task. Migrants have a higher attrition probability due to the\nmobility of the population. Hence, when a researcher is confronted with a migrant\npopulation, it is difficult to define the population at hand, as there are constant\ninflows and outflows of individuals with different traits. Moreover, duration raises the\npossibility of right censoring which could not be addressed with the data at hand.\nThese results need to be researched further using panel data, which unfortunately are\nnot available as yet.\nEndnotes\n1For a detailed discussion about the concept and measurement of informality, see\n2Schneider et al. (2010) provide estimates of the size of \"shadow economies\" for a\nrange of countries. For India their estimate is an average of 22% for the period 1999\u00ad\n2006. This is based on macroeconomic estimates for a group of countries using the\nMIMIC method. However, their estimates rely on only 27 (or 20) degrees of freedom.\nAs our research is primarily about the informal labour market we do not wish to enter\ninto debates about different estimates of the share of the shadow (informal) economy\nin GDP.\n3A \"good\" school would almost certainly be an established private school.\n4It has been suggested by McMillan and Rodrik (McMillan and Rodrik 2011) that in\nLatin America the rationalisation of some firms led to lower employment in the formal\nsector with the redundant workers moving to the lower productivity informal sector,\nhence average productivity fell.\n5Of course, some people may prefer informal sector activities, see Perry et al. (2007).\n6\"Indeed most of the informal salaried appear to be queing for more desirable jobs in\neither the formal salaried sector or as self-employed workers...\", p. 6, Perry et al.\n7Perry et al.
