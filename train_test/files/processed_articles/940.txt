This Forum article suggests\nthat it is time for a different way of looking at functional limitation pathways. It focuses on\ntrajectories. Responses to three Rosow and Breslau (1966) and two Nagi (1976) items, asked\nof 12,998 older adults who participated in up to seven waves of data collection as part of\nthe Established Populations for the Epidemiologic Study of the Elderly, are used to illustrate\nthis approach, emphasizing both its conceptual and pragmatic advantages. The results\nprovide greater clarity in terms of those who become functionally limited, take on more\nfunctional limitations, or recover as well as those who are likely to be lost to follow-up and\nin terms of the outcomes associated with those individuals over time.\nKey Words: Trajectories, Transitions, Functional limitations, Health status, Older adults\nRethinking Functional Limitation Pathways\nFredric D. Wolinsky, PhD,1,2,3 Eric S. Armbrecht, BS,2 and Kathleen W. Wyrwich, PhD1\nFunctional limitations involve situation-free activi-\nties (Verbrugge & Jette, 1994), or the capacity to per-\nform fundamental physical actions such as reaching\nout or up, walking a half mile, or climbing a flight of\nstairs. In contrast, disabilities involve situation-depen-\ndent activities (Verbrugge & Jette, 1994), such as the\ncapacity to perform basic tasks associated with daily\nliving like bathing and toileting, or to perform in-\nstrumental tasks such as money management and\nshopping. Taken together, functional limitations and\ndisabilities are among the most frequently studied is-\nsues in gerontology and geriatrics. This can be\nreadily demonstrated in two ways. One involves re-\nviewing the work that has appeared in the journals\npublished by  \nMedline entries for   and the Jour-\nnals of Gerontology, 145 or one eighth could be\nidentified simply from the single subject heading\n(i.e., MeSH term) for activities of daily living (ADLs).\nThe other way to demonstrate the interest in func-\ntional limitation and disability in gerontology and ge-\nriatrics is to review the number of instruments used to\nmeasure these constructs. Cohen and McHorney\nments that have been developed since 1945. Be-\ncause their list was restricted to generic (i.e., not dis-\nease specific) functional assessment tools, this is\nactually a conservative estimate.\nA frequent theme in studies of functional limita-\ntion and disability are transitions over time. Indeed,\nlongitudinal studies conducted between 1985 and\n1997 that focused on risk factors for such transitions.\nGenerally speaking, research on transitions in func-\ntional limitation and disability may be placed into\nthree categories. The first category of studies looks at\ntransitions between one state and another state on\njust one item. For example, this could involve the on-\nset of a particular disability item, such as bathing.\nGiven the dichotomous (limited vs not limited) na-\nture of most ADL items, this approach typically in-\nvolves using a binomial logistic regression model in\nwhich several risk factors are used to predict going\nfrom an independent to a dependent state in terms of\nbathing. The second category of studies looks at\nchanges in categorical dependence levels from one\nstate based on the basis of several items. An example\nof this approach would be the transition from one\ntutes of Health/National Institute on Aging to Dr. Wolinsky. Additional\nsupport was provided by the National Archive for Computerized Data on\nAging during Dr. Wolinsky's term as resident scientist and by a research\nassistantship from the Graduate School of Saint Louis University to Mr.\nArmbrecht. Preliminary results from this article using the first four waves of\ndata were previously presented at the 1997 Annual Meeting of The Geron-\ntological Society of America, and at the 1998 Workshop on Transitions in\nHealth Status for Older Persons, which was sponsored by the Italian Na-\ntional Research Council. The data were originally collected by James O.\nTaylor, Robert B. Wallace, Adrian M. Ostfeld, and Dan G. Blazer, who\nhave graciously made them available for public use through the Inter-Uni-\nversity Consortium for Political and Social Research. The opinions\nexpressed herein are solely those of the authors and do not necessarily rep-\nresent the official positions or policies of the supporting institutions and\nagencies or the original data collectors.\n1Address correspondence to Dr. Fredric D.

Because there are frequently\nmore than two possible combinatorial states, this ap-\nproach often involves multinomial logistic regression\nor grade of membership models. The third category of\ntransition studies looks at change score analyses of\naggregated indices. This approach frequently involves\ngeneral linear modeling of changes in the simple\nsummed number of either ADLs or IADLs.\nAlthough all three of these categories of research\non transitions in functional limitation and disability\nhave made important contributions to our under-\nstanding of the onset of and recovery from functional\nlimitations, at least three important issues remain un-\nresolved. First, state transitions involving only one\nitem (e.g., shopping) examine that transition in isola-\ntion from state transitions on other items (e.g., money\nmanagement and transportation). This is not entirely\nrealistic inasmuch as the ability to shop is (or should\nbe) at least partly conditioned on the ability to main-\ntain personal finances and get to stores. Second,\nchanges in both categorical dependence models and\nchange score analyses of aggregated indices are\nsomewhat removed from the original item transitions.\nThat is, with these approaches it is not known which\nof the particular individual states (e.g., ADLs or\nIADLs) have been exited or entered. Indeed, compo-\nsitional change in the individual states (e.g., going\nfrom bathing and dressing limitations to eating and\ntoileting limitations) that results in the same combi-\nnatorial classification (i.e., two ADL limitations) is\nconceptually and statistically treated as stability.\nThird, all three categories of transition modeling ap-\nproaches focus mostly on differences between only\ntwo points in time, such as baseline and a specifi-\ncally targeted follow-up. As a result, there is no char-\nacterization of the trajectory pattern. This is both\nconceptually limiting and empirically unfortunate,\ngiven the increasing number of multiwave data sets\navailable for analysis.\nEven recent and sophisticated analyses suffer from\nthese limitations. This can be quickly illustrated with\njust two examples of some of the best work that has\nbeen done in recent years. First, consider the work of\nRudberg, Parzen, Leonard, and Cassel (1996). Writ-\ning in this journal, they reported on using wave-to-\nwave probabilities to examine ADL transitions across\ninterviews of the respondents in the Longitudinal\nStudy of Aging (LSOA). Although Rudberg and col-\nleagues focused on seven states (i.e., 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or\n5 limited activities, or death), real transitions within\nthree of those states (i.e., the 2, 3, or 4 limited activi-\nties states) would mistakenly be viewed as stability if\nthe transition resulted in the same numerical count.\nSecond, consider the work of Mendes de Leon and\ncolleagues (1999). Writing in another of The Geron-\ntological Society of America's journals, they reported\nusing Markov models to estimate one-year disability\ntransitions in ADLs across eight waves of data from\nthe Yale Health and Aging Project (one of the four\nsites of the Established Populations for the Epidemio-\nlogic Study of the Elderly, or EPESE). In those analy-\nses, a two-state transition was modeled reflecting en-\ntrance into one or more of the six ADL disabilities, or\nreturn from one or more of the six ADL disabilities to\nno disabilities. As such, that work only reflects the\ntwo most extreme transitions (i.e., the initial onset of\nthe first disability, or complete recovery).\nIt would seem, then, that most of the work done to\ndate on changes in functional limitation and disabil-\nity over time has focused on single transitions devoid\nof context rather than on the pattern of transitions\nover time that constitute trajectories. The purpose of\nthis Forum article, therefore, is to suggest reorienting\nboth conceptual and empirical work toward trajecto-\nries. The essential element underlying our approach\ninvolves a different way of characterizing trajectory\npatterns. To illustrate this approach, consider the\ndata used by Rudberg and colleagues (1996). They\nexamined five dichotomous ADL items: bathing,\ndressing, eating, getting in and out of a bed or chair,\nand toileting. These ADLs were observed over the\nfour waves of the LSOA. Thus, at baseline there were\n32 possible combinations (i.e., 25) in their data, as-\nsuming that there were no missing data at the item\nlevel. Three additional combinations were possible at\neach follow-up, reflecting respondents who had died,\nwho were re-interviewed but did not answer all five\nof the ADL items, or who were otherwise lost. To ap-\npreciate the myriad possible trajectory patterns, visu-\nalize four 6  6 grids on which each of the 32 possi-\nble baseline or 35 possible follow-up combinations\ncan be located (i.e., one grid per wave of data). Ar-\nrange the cells on these grids such that at baseline the\nmost densely populated cells (limitations on none or\nonly one or two ADLs) are at the outer edges, and the\nleast densely populated cells (such as death and lost\nto follow-up, which are by definition empty at base-\nline) are at the center. Layer the grids in a three-dimen-\nsional space in which the baseline grid is on top and\nthe close-out grid is on the bottom, much like a three-\ndimensional tic-tac-toe or chess game.\nThis approach has some intuitive appeal. Consider\nthe simplistic case in which there was very little limi-\ntation at baseline, followed by incrementing disabili-\nties over the three follow-up periods, resulting in insti-\ntutionalization or death. Under those circumstances,\na graphical portrayal of the cell densities would re-\nsemble a tornado pattern, with the intensity (i.e., rate\nof progression) of the funneling dependent on how\nwell the observed longitudinal run corresponds to the\nnatural pattern of decline. However, regardless of\nwhether such a tornado pattern (symmetrical or oth-\nerwise) emerges, it becomes evident that there is\nnearly an infinite number of possible trajectories (i.e.,\nbe the most densely traveled paths that represent the\npatterns of interest that should ultimately be modeled\nusing multivariable methods to identify salient risk\nfactors.\nRather than use the ADL items in the LSOA as an\nempirical example of this perspective, we have cho-\nsen five of the lower body functional limitation ques-\ntions taken from the Rosow and Breslau (1966) and\nNagi (1976) measures that were included in the\nEPESE. There were three reasons for the selection of\nthese measures and data. First, as Lawrence and Jette\n(1996) have eloquently argued, functional limitations\n(as opposed to disabilities, or situation-free versus sit-\nuation-dependent activities) are what drive the dis-\nablement process from both the theoretical and prac-\ntical standpoints. Thus, improvements in the public\nhealth of older adults will be most closely tied to un-\nderstanding functional limitation trajectories (Branch,\n1996). Second, despite the availability of lower body\nfunctional items in the LSOA, no attempt was made\nto re-interview nearly one third of the LSOA respon-\ndents in 1986 because of budgetary constraints (Ko-\nvar, Fitti, & Chyba, 1992). As a result, the utility of\nthe LSOA for assessing trajectory patterns is substan-\ntially diminished (Lawrence & Jette, 1996; Rudberg et\nsion of the EPESE available from the Inter-University\nConsortium for Political and Social Research in-\ncludes the first seven waves of data collected from all\nfour sites as well as the associated mortality data\n(Taylor, Wallace, Ostfeld, & Blazer, 1998). As such,\nthe EPESE is the largest and longest-run multiwave\ndata set currently available for public use. Use of\nthese data expands the number of grids in our dem-\nonstration from four to seven, and it concomitantly\nincreases the number of unique trajectories that are\npossible to approximately 1 billion (i.e., about 356).\nMethods\nThe EPESE project was designed to investigate risk\nfactors for chronic disease and functional loss as well\nas to model the risks of mortality, hospitalization, and\nnursing home placement (Taylor et al., 1998). Data\nwere elicited from persons 65 years old and older\nwho resided in four catchment areas: East Boston,\nMassachusetts; New Haven, Connecticut; Iowa and\nWashington Counties, Iowa; and north central North\nCarolina. Sampling approaches varied by site and in-\nvolved the following: (a) a total community census in\nEast Boston; (b) Agency on Aging enumeration lists in\nIowa; (c) residential stratification within private and\npublic age-restricted housing and general community\nareas in New Haven; and (d) area sampling in North\nCarolina. Because of the different and complex sam-\npling designs used at each site, traditional estimation\nprocedures that assume random selection might un-\nderestimate standard errors and result in inflated sig-\nnificance levels in the absence of adjustments for the\ndesign effects. For the descriptive and illustrative pur-\nposes of this Forum article, however, such design ad-\njustments are not necessary.\nAt baseline, the response rates for those eligible\n(given the above sampling approaches) were 84%\n4,162) in North Carolina, yielding a combined sam-\n(206 telephone interviews in Iowa), the baseline in-\nterviews were conducted face-to-face in 1982 for\nEast Boston, Iowa, and New Haven, and in 1986 for\nNorth Carolina. Subsequently, at each site there were\ntwo consecutive cycles of three annual follow-ups in-\nvolving two rounds of telephone interviews and one\nface-to-face interview. Therefore, a total of seven\nwaves of data are available for use. Because the fo-\ncus of this Forum article is on annual changes in\nphysical limitations, no adjustment is made for the\npotential period confound associated with the later\nstart of the North Carolina data series.\nThe EPESE included five lower body functional\nlimitations questions: three items from the Rosow\nand Breslau (1966) scale, and two items from the\nNagi (1976) scale. The Rosow and Breslau items\nwere as follows: (1) \"Are you able to do heavy work\naround the house like (shoveling snow), washing\nwindows, walls, or floors without help?\" (2) \"Are you\nable to walk up and down stairs to the second floor\nwithout help?\" and (3) \"Are you able to walk half a\nmile without help?\" Response options were \"yes\" or\n\"no.\" \"No\" responses were coded as limitations. The\nNagi items were as follows: (4) \"How much diffi-\nculty, if any, do you have pulling or pushing large\nobjects like a living room chair?\" and (5) \"What\nabout stooping, crouching, or kneeling?\" Response\noptions were \"no difficulty at all,\" \"a little or some\ndifficulty,\" \"a lot of difficulty,\" or \"just unable to do\nit.\" The latter two responses were coded as limita-\ntions.\nOne of the three Rosow and Breslow (1966) items\nwarrants further discussion. This is the heavy house-\nwork question, which is a noticeably less discreet in-\ndicator of lower body limitations. Indeed, the ability\nto do heavy housework is the least situationally free\nof the five items and, as such, it taps disability in ad-\ndition to functional limitation. The complexity of the\nheavy housework item notwithstanding, it remains\nwidely used as an indicator of lower body functional\nlimitation (Stuck et al., 1999) because the primary ex-\nertional force is derived from the legs, regardless of\nwhich particular housework activity is involved.\nTherefore, we retain it in the current analysis. Note\nthat these measurement shortcomings are minimized\nby our focus on patterns of serial combinatorial tran-\nsitions rather than traditional marginal change score\nmodels.\nBecause the Nagi items were not asked of 250\nIowa proxy-respondents or 206 Iowa telephone re-\nspondents at baseline, it was necessary to reduce the\neligible analytic sample to 14,000. Frequency distri-\nbutions for the five lower body physical limitation\nquestions are shown in Table 1 by wave of data col-\nlection. Missing data at baseline reflect item nonre-\nsponse. Subsequent missing data reflect both item\nnonresponse and loss to follow-up other than mortal-\nity. Mortality data were obtained by carefully moni-\ntoring hospital admissions, obituaries, state death\nindexes, and follow-up interviews with collateral\npersons previously identified by the deceased re-\nspondents. Reported deaths were verified by matches\nwith death certificates in 99.2% of all cases.\nIn this Forum article, the integrity of the five indi-\nvidual questions was maintained. Nonetheless, tradi-\ntional psychometric methods were used among the\n12,998 EPESE persons with no missing data at base-\nline to explore the reliability and validity of a com-\nposite based on the simple summation of the five\nitems. Exploratory factor analyses using both princi-\npal components and principal axis techniques identi-\nfied a unidimensional structure with an eigenvalue of\n2.9 that accounted for 58.1% of the variance in the\nfive items. Communalities ranged from .55 to .65 in\nthe principal components analysis, and from .43 to\n.57 in the principal axis analysis. Factor loadings\nranged from .74 to .80 in the principal components\nanalysis, and from .66 to .77 in the principal axis\nanalysis. Coefficient alpha was .82. Comparable re-\nsults were obtained at all follow-ups.\nTo simplify reference to the 32 possible combina-\ntions among the five items at baseline and the 35\npossible combinations at each of the six follow-ups, a\nnotational system was selected. It labels each combi-\nnation of the five items at each wave by using a five-\ndigit sequence. Ones or zeroes reflect the presence\nor absence, respectively, of the limitation in ques-\ntion. At all waves, the limitations are sequenced from\nleft to right in ascending order on the basis of their\nprevalence at baseline (i.e., easiest to most difficult to\nperform tasks; see Table 1). Therefore, the first num-\nber (i.e., the leftmost 0 or 1) refers to a limitation in\nwalking up one flight of stairs, the second to a limita-\ntion in pushing or pulling large objects, the third to a\nlimitation in walking one-half mile, the fourth to a\nlimitation in stooping, and the last to a limitation in\ndoing heavy housework. For example, the sequence\n(or state) 00101 denotes a person whose only limita-\ntions are walking one-half mile and doing heavy\nhousework. The analysis is limited, for simplicity, to\nthe 12,998 EPESE persons with complete data for all\nfive items at baseline. Persons lost to follow-up are\nviewed but had missing data on one or more of the\nfive items. Decedents are noted with the numeric\nResults\nEPESE analytic sample persons (i.e., those with no\nmissing data at baseline) across all possible unique\ncombinations is not uniform. Indeed, only 13 of the\nmore of the analytic sample persons at baseline (i.e.,\nwave 1), the last follow-up (i.e., wave 7), or both.\nThis includes those with no limitations at all (i.e.,\n00000), four of the states with only one limitation\n01001), three of the states with three limitations (i.e.,\nTable 1.

First, over the seven waves of data, the greatest\nabsolute distributional changes involve just two of\nthe 35 possible states, those with no functional limi-\ntations at all (i.e., state 00000) and those who be-\ncome deceased (i.e., state 99999). At baseline, about\none half of the analytic sample had no functional\nlimitations and, by definition, none were deceased.\nBy the final follow-up, however, only one fourth of\nthe analytic sample had no functional limitations\nand, by then, one fourth had died. This is to be ex-\npected inasmuch as the rate of onset of functional\nlimitations typically exceeds the rate of complete re-\ncovery from functional limitations (Manton, Corder,\nWolinsky, Stump, Callahan, & Johnson, 1996) due to\nthe fact that mortality is a fully absorbing state in tran-\nsition models (Crimmins, Hayward, & Saito, 1994).\nTable 2.

The first number (0 or\n1) refers to limitations in walking up one flight of stairs, the second limitations in pushing or pulling large objects, the third to limitations\nin walking one-half mile, the fourth to limitations in stooping, and the last to limitations in doing heavy housework. Persons lost to follow-\nup are assigned a numeric code of 77777. A numeric code of 88888 is used for persons who were re-interviewed but had missing data on\none or more of the five items. Decedents are noted with the numeric code of 99999.\nThe second point worth noting in Table 2 con-\ncerning functional limitation pathways involves the\n30 other states possible at baseline (i.e., excluding\nhousework (i.e., state 00001) or only in stooping (i.e.,\nstate 00010) are by far the two most densely popu-\nlated of these 30 states. Their percentage shares are\nreduced by about one half from wave 1 to wave 7.\nThe absolute numbers of persons in the 28 remaining\nstates, however, did not change appreciably over the\nobservation period. This includes those with all five\nfunctional limitations (i.e., state 11111), who repre-\nsented 7.4% of the analytic sample at baseline and\n7.8% at final follow-up. Thus, from a sequential\ncross-sectional standpoint, it would appear plausible\nto conclude that considerable distributional stability\nexisted.\nA third important point worth observing in the\ndata shown in Table 2 involves those who were com-\npletely lost to follow-up at each particular wave of\nwere re-interviewed at each particular wave but had\nmissing data on one or more of the functional limita-\ntions questions (i.e., state 88888). The lost to follow-\nup state increases in a three-step fashion, going from\nabout 3% at waves 2 and 3, to about 5% at waves 4,\n5, and 6, to about 8% at the final follow-up. This is\nconsistent with previous reports that those com-\nTable 3.

At the same time, however, it\nis clear that being lost to follow-up is not a fully ab-\nsorbing state among older adults (Mihelic & Crim-\nmins, 1997). In contrast, the percentage of those who\nwere re-interviewed at a particular wave but had\nmissing data on one or more of the functional status\nquestions (i.e., state 88888) shows a noticeable dip at\nwaves 5 and 6 but is otherwise relatively stable at\nabout 5%. Although consistent with an interpretation\nthat those who have missing data at the functional\nlimitations item level at any particular wave of data\nmay be at increased risk of doing so repeatedly over\ntime, these data are only definitive about the exist-\nence of considerable cross-sequential distributional\nstability.\nWhat the data in Table 2 do not provide is much\nof a picture of either wave-to-wave transitions or\noverall trajectories. One way to do this would be to\ndraw a flow diagram showing the migration paths\n(depicted by arrows) from each state at each wave to\neach state at the next wave, with the number of\nEPESE sample persons making each transition listed\non each arrow. Even if such a flow diagram were re-\nstricted to only the 13 most common states, however,\nthis would be incredibly complex. There are 130\n(i.e., 10 states to 13 states) possible arrows from wave\nthe single state-to-state transition for those already\ndeceased) possible arrows for each of the five re-\nmaining contiguous wave-to-wave transitions, result-\ning in 915 possible arrows overall. A less cumbersome\napproach is to present the frequency distributions for\nthe 13 most common states at waves 1 to 7 for those\npersons residing in the most densely populated origin\nor destination states. Tables 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 do this\nfor two origin states and three destination states. The\norigin states involve those who had no functional\nlimitations at baseline (00000) and those who had all\nfive functional limitations at baseline (11111). These\nof the EPESE analytical sample. The three destination\nstates involve those who had no functional limita-\ntions at the last follow-up (00000), those who had\nall five functional limitations at the last follow-up\n(11111), and those who were deceased at the last fol-\nlow-up (99999). These three destination states account\nsample.\nTable 3 contains the frequency distributions across\nall seven waves for the 6,443 EPESE sample persons\nwho had no functional limitations at baseline. By the\nlast follow-up, 42.8% of these older adults had no\nfunctional limitations, and another 9.8% had only\nThus, the majority (albeit slim) of these individuals\nhad maintained a very high level of functional ability\nover the 7-year period.

Furthermore, although 20% of those\nwith all five functional limitations at baseline were\nnot found in one of the 13 most common states at\nwave 2, this is merely an artifact. Recall that four of\nthe states with four functional limitations were so un-\ncommon that they were not included in the table.\nNinety-five of the persons with all five functional lim-\nitations at baseline migrated to one of these four less\ncommon states with four functional limitations at\nwave 2.

It is also important\nto note that about 3-4% of those persons who had no\nfunctional limitations at the last follow-up were ei-\nther lost to follow-up (i.e., state 77777) or had miss-\ning data on one or more items (i.e., state 88888) at\none of the intervening waves, illustrating the poten-\ntial attrition bias that can occur by excluding those\nwith missing data.\nThe frequency distributions across all seven waves\nfor the 1,011 EPESE sample persons who had all five\nfunctional limitations at the last follow-up are shown\nin Table 6. A very different pattern is revealed here.\nLess than one fourth of these individuals had all five\nfunctional limitations at baseline. Moreover, only\nabout one half had all five functional limitations at\nwave 6, suggesting considerable wave-to-wave tran-\nsition into this state. This is further reflected by the\nfact that 7.3% of those having all five functional limi-\ntations at the final follow-up had either none or only\none such limitation the year before (i.e., state 00001,\nnote that only 7.5% of those with all five limitations\nat the last follow-up were either lost to follow-up\n(i.e., state 77777) the year before or had some miss-\ning data (i.e., state 88888) at that point. This repre-\nspectively, of all such EPESE sample persons, suggesting\nthat few individuals lost to follow-up at a preceding\nwave were found to have all five functional limita-\ntions at the next wave.\nIn addition, close inspection of Table 6 reveals\nsomething not found in any of the preceding tables.\ntional limitations at the final follow-up were not to be\nfound in any of the 13 most common states at the\npreceding follow-up (i.e., wave 6). Neither were sim-\nilar percentages to be found in any of the 13 most\ncommon states involving any previous wave-to-wave\ntransition. When coupled with the above observation\nthat less than one half of the persons who had all five\nfunctional limitations at the final follow-up were in\nusually large migration into this state from the less\ncommon states that only occurs at wave 7.\nTable 7 contains the frequency distributions across\nall seven waves for the 3,579 EPESE sample persons\nwho were deceased at the last follow-up. In addition\nto demonstrating that this is a fully absorbing state,\nTable 6.

The first number (0 or\n1) refers to limitations in walking up one flight of stairs, the second limitations in pushing or pulling large objects, the third to limitations\nin walking one-half mile, the fourth to limitations in stooping, and the last to limitations in doing heavy housework. Persons lost to fol-\nlow-up are assigned a numeric code of 77777. A numeric code of 88888 is used for persons who were re-interviewed but had missing\ndata on one or more of the five items. Decedents are noted with the numeric code of 99999.\nthese data show that the majority of those who died\nat a given wave either had all five functional limita-\ntions in the previous wave or were lost to follow-up.\ndeaths between waves 6 and 7 involved persons with\nno functional limitations at all, and another 4.3%\n(28) involved persons with only one functional limi-\ntation. Moreover, nearly one half of those who were\ndead by wave 7 had either no limitation or just one\nfunctional limitation at baseline. This reflects the fact\nthat although there is a dose\u00adresponse relationship\nbetween functional limitations and mortality, even\nthose in robust health face sizeable risks.\nDiscussion\nIn this Forum article, we have suggested rethinking\nfunctional limitation pathways to focus on trajecto-\nries, by which we mean patterns of serial transitions\nin context. Theoretically, doing so has three advan-\ntages. First, it directs attention to unique combina-\ntions of functional limitation items. Second, it brings\nfidelity back to the definition of stability. And third, it\nshifts attention from two-state transition models to\npatterns in serial transitions.\nPragmatically, rethinking functional limitation path-\nways to focus on trajectories reveals a clearer picture\nof what is taking place. Specifically, it provides\ngreater clarity in terms of who becomes functionally\nlimited, who takes on more functional limitations,\nand who recovers as well as who is likely to be lost to\nfollow-up, and what happens to those individuals\nover time. For example, previous studies have shown\nthat both the onset of functional limitations and com-\nplete recovery occur among older adults, although\nthe former happens with greater frequency than the\nshown here, however, further indicate that patterns\nof decline and recovery (i.e., transitions) are not the\nsame for all origin states. This is clearly reflected in a\ncomparison of Tables 4 and 5. Table 4 indicates that\nthere was very little recovery of any magnitude\namong those with all five functional limitations at\nbaseline, whereas Table 5 indicates that 1 out of 6\nolder adults who had no functional limitations at the\nfinal follow-up had at least one functional limitation\nat baseline. These distinctions are completely masked\nin more traditional transition models.\nMoreover, as one would expect, it is also the case\nthat the greatest amount of wave-to-wave fluctuation\noccurs among those with two, three, or four func-\ntional limitations at baseline (data not shown). Such\noscillation patterns could reflect either of two distinct\npossibilities, one positive and one negative. On the\npositive side, these fluctuation patterns may accu-\nrately reflect the ebb and flow of functional limita-\ntions over time for older adults. On the negative side,\nit is possible that these oscillations reflect more on\nthe unreliability of the five functional limitation\nitems. Either explanation should prompt a reconsid-\neration of more traditional transition models because\nthose approaches (especially transition models in-\nvolving only two points in time) infer more meaning\nto these observed changes than is probably war-\nranted.\nFocusing on trajectories also has implications for\nthe treatment of those lost to follow-up. These data\nsuggest that although those lost to follow-up at one\nwave may be more likely to be lost to follow-up at\nsubsequent waves, this is clearly not always the case\nTable 7. Frequency Distributions at Waves 1\u00ad7 for the 13 Most Common Combinations of the Five Functional Limitation Items for the\nPossible\nCombinations\nn % n % n % n % n % n % n %\nNote: The notation system is based on 1 representing a limitation and 0 representing the absence of a limitation. The first number (0 or\n1) refers to limitations in walking up one flight of stairs, the second limitations in pushing or pulling large objects, the third to limitations\nin walking one-half mile, the fourth to limitations in stooping, and the last to limitations in doing heavy housework. Persons lost to fol-\nlow-up are assigned a numeric code of 77777. A numeric code of 88888 is used for persons who were re-interviewed but had missing\ndata on one or more of the five items. Decedents are noted with the numeric code of 99999.\n(Mihelic & Crimmins, 1997). As a result, the exclu-\nsion of those lost to follow-up at any wave of data\ncollection is likely to bias the understanding of func-\ntional status pathways (Dubin & Rivers, 1990; Little &\nbe said for those who were successfully re-inter-\nviewed at any given wave of data collection but\nfailed to answer one or more of the functional limita-\ntion questions.\nRethinking functional limitation pathways, how-\never, has a price. That price involves having no\nstraightforward methods for deriving simple statistical\nsummaries of the approximately 1 billion pathways\npossible in these data and predicting who will travel\ndown them. The development and application of\nsuch statistical techniques is sorely needed. In their\nabsence, only part of the trajectory story can be told.\nFor example, the simple analysis presented here, which\nfocused on the 13 most common states, results in ig-\nnoring up to one fourth of the persons residing in the\nselected origin or destination states in the out-waves.\nUntil more appropriate statistical techniques are\navailable, it will be necessary to take intermediate\napproaches that restrict attention to comparing and\ncontrasting the risk factors associated with particu-\nlarly intriguing trajectories emanating from a com-\nmon origin state. One example of such a targeted\nand relatively primitive contrast would involve focus-\ning on the 6,443 older adults in these data who\nhad no functional limitations at baseline (i.e., state\n00000). By using a variety of background, personal,\nsocial, economic, and disease history measures, re-\nsearchers could estimate multinomial logistic regres-\nsion models in which those with no functional limita-\ntions at the final follow-up were contrasted with\nthose in the next six most common final destination\ninto consideration the intervening serial transitions\ninvolving waves 2 through 6, it would provide the\nopportunity to identify differential risk factors associ-\nated with the most common ultimate destination\nstates for those older adults originating in the most\ncommon states. At least, that would be a beginning.\nReferences\nBranch, L. G. (1996). Research on disability: Where is it leading? Journal of\nCohen, A. S., & McHorney, C. A. (1998).
