The current study compared Black\nand White American older adults for the longitudinal links between depressive symptoms\nand mastery in the United States.\nMethods: Using data from the Religion, Aging, and Health Survey, 2001\u00ad2004, this\nindividuals (age 66 or more) for 3 years. Depressive symptoms [Center for Epidemiological\nStudies-Depression scale (CES-D), 8 items] and mastery (Pearlin Mastery Scale, 7 items)\nwere measured in 2001 and 2004. Demographics, socio-economics, and physical health\nwere covariates and race was the focal moderator. Multi-group structural equation\nmodeling was used for data analysis, where groups were defined based on race.\nResults: Among White but not Black older adults, higher levels of depressive symptoms\nat baseline predicted a greater decline in sense of mastery over 3 years of follow-up.\nSimilarly among Whites but not Blacks, individuals with lower mastery at baseline\ndeveloped more depressive symptoms over time.\nConclusion: Findings are indicative of Black-White differences in reciprocal associations\nbetween depressive symptoms and mastery over time. Race alters how depression is\nlinked to changes in evaluation of self (e.g., mastery) over time.\nKeywords: population groups, ethnic groups, african americans, depressive symptoms, depression, mastery,\nself-efficacy\nINTRODUCTION\nAccording to the Black-White health paradox, one of the mysteries of health research (Keyes, 2009;\nexposure to psychosocial and economic stress and adversities, Blacks less frequently meet criteria\nLawrence et al., 2013). In line with this paradox, Blacks and Whites differ in psychosocial and health\nAssari and Lankarani Depressive Symptoms-Mastery; Race Differences\nfactors that correlate with depression and depressive symptoms\nsupported by research showing that depression increases the risk\nof chronic medical conditions among Whites but not Blacks\nmedical conditions (Assari et al., 2015) and all-cause (Assari\n(Assari and Burgard, 2015) mortality among Whites but not\nBlacks. In another set of studies, depressive symptoms have\nfailed to correlate with expected biological markers, such as\nThe first possible explanation proposed by Keyes for the\nBlack-White health paradox is that Blacks may experience some\nlevels of growth or flourishing in the presence of adversities\n(Keyes, 2009). Assari has found that Blacks are systematically\nmore resilient to the effects of psycho-social factors, which\nmay reflect an adaptive resilience of Blacks as a result of life\nunder economic and social adversity, or culture (Krause, 2002;\nsupported by studies documenting higher availability and efficacy\nof interpersonal psychosocial resources, such as social support\nand religion, for Blacks than Whites (Lincoln et al., 2003; Keyes,\n2015). Jackson has suggested that Blacks use behavioral coping\nmechanisms that lower the risk of emotional problems, however,\nincrease the risk of metabolic and cardiovascular conditions\nThere are also a series of methodological explanations that\nattribute this paradox to measurement errors or selection biases.\nFor instance, some evidence suggests that depression measures\nthat are designed and validated for Whites fail to capture\ndepression in Blacks (Moazen-Zadeh and Assari, 2016). In one\nstudy, baseline depressive symptoms were predictive of the\nsubsequent risk of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) after 15\nyears among Whites but not Blacks (Moazen-Zadeh and Assari,\n2016). This view is also supported by the literature suggesting\nlower validity of depressive measures among Blacks (Williams\net al., 2007) as well as studies that depression may differently\npresent among Blacks and Whites (Brown et al., 1996; Blazer\nThe third generation of explanations recently proposed by\nAssari is that depression differently influences dysfunctional\nattitudes about self (e.g., mastery), others, and the future (e.g.,\nDejman, 2016). In this view, depression is qualitatively different\namong Blacks and Whites; thus Blacks and Whites may differ\nin the link between depression and mastery, defined as a sense\nof having control over the forces that affect one's life (Fok\net al., 2012). We argue that high levels of psychosocial resources,\nsuch as social support and religion, may make Blacks more\nresistant to decline in mastery in the face of social adversities\nof mastery will have implications on how stress may affect\ndepression among Blacks and Whites (Assari and Lankarani,\n2016c). This view is also supported by studies suggesting that\nlocus of control, mastery, self-efficacy, and control over life\nmay not have similar meanings in Whites and Blacks (Deaton\nstudies, Assari has shown that depression differently influences\ndysfunctional attitudes about self, others, and the future (Assari,\nFor instance, lower levels of these control beliefs may have more\nsignificant health consequences for Whites than Blacks (Assari,\nBuilt on the differential effect hypothesis (Assari, 2016b,d;\nconducted the current study to compare Black and White\nAmerican older adults for the reciprocal longitudinal associations\nbetween depressive symptoms and mastery over time. This\nhypothesis is in line with what Belsky and others have\ncalled `differential susceptibility to environmental influences' or\n`differential susceptibility to the context' (Belsky, 1997; Boyce\nGiven that previous studies have shown that religion and social\nsupport may be more available and effective for Blacks compared\nfinding that Blacks are more resilient to the effect of psychosocial\nexpected to observe weaker reciprocal longitudinal links between\ndepressive symptoms and mastery among Blacks compared to\nWhites. We used nationally representative data to generate\nresults that are generalizable to the U.S. population of older\nadults.\nMETHODS\nDesign and Setting\nWith a longitudinal panel design, data came from Waves 1 and 2\nis a 3 year follow up of a nationally representative household\nsample of Black and White older adults in the U.S. (Krause,\nSampling and Participants\nThe study participants were either White or Black older adults.\nOlder Blacks were over-sampled in the survey.

The study population was limited to those\nwho were either Christians or those who were never associated\nwith any faith.\nMeasures\nRace, demographic data (age and gender), and socio economic\nstatus (education) were measured at baseline in 2001.

All these items were selected from the negative\ndomain of the CES-D; positive affect and interpersonal items\nwere not reflected in this version of the CES-D. Item responses\nwere 1 (\"rarely or none\") to 4 (\"most or all of the time\"). We\ncalculated the mean score which treated depressive symptoms as\na continuous measure, with a potential range from 1 to 4. Higher\nscores indicated more severe depressive symptoms. (Abu-Raiya\nMastery\nWe used seven items from the Pearlin Mastery Scale (Cairney and\nKrause, 2008). Items included (1) You have little control over\nthe things that happen to you, (2) There is really no way you\ncan solve some of the problems you have, (3) There is little you\ncan do to change many of the important things in your life, (4)\nSometimes you feel that you are being pushed around in life, (5)\nWhat happens to you in the future mostly depends upon you,\n(6) You can do just about anything you really set your mind to,\nand (7) You often feel helpless in dealing with the problems of\nlife (Pearlin and Pioli, 2003). This construct is similar to sense\nWe calculated a mean score where a higher score was indicative of\na greater sense of mastery (range = 0\u00ad4). Some of the items were\nreverse coded. The internal reliability of the scale (Cronbach's\nNumber of Chronic Medical Conditions\nThe presence of the following chronic medical conditions were\nmeasured during the past 12 months: (1) hypertension, (2)\nheart problem, (3) diabetes, (4) cancer, (5) kidney disease,\n(6) arthritis or rheumatism, (7) intestinal disorders, (8) liver\ndisease, (9) urinary tract disorders, (10) eye diseases, (11) any\nrespiratory disease, and (12) any other major health problem.\nPossible responses included yes [1], no [0], and do not know\n(missing data). Number of conditions potentially ranged between\n0 and 12, where a higher score was indicative of more chronic\nconditions. (Watkins et al., 2015) We decided to control for\nchronic medical conditions as physical health is correlated\nwith mastery and depressive symptoms and may confound\ntheir link. Medical conditions may, however, be differently\nlinked to depression based on race (MacKinnon et al., 2000;\nStatistical Analysis\nWe used SPSS 20.0 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY) for univariate and\nbivariate analyses. We used AMOS 20 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY)\nfor multivariable analysis. For bivariate associations, Pearson's\ncorrelations tests, independent sample t-tests, and paired t-\ntests were used. For multivariable analysis, we ran multi-group\nstructural equation modeling (SEM) to test if baseline depressive\nsymptoms and mastery predict subsequent depressive symptoms\nand mastery, while age, education, gender, and chronic medical\nconditions were controlled. We ran a multi-group model where\nconsidered significant.\nThe Amos software computes maximum likelihood estimates\nModel fit was evaluated by examining the chi-square statistic, the\ncomparative fit index (CFI), and the root mean square error of\napproximation (RMSEA).

Number of medical conditions was\npredictive of change in mastery and depressive symptoms among\nWhites and Blacks (Table 2, Figures 1, 2).\nDISCUSSION\nIn a nationally representative sample of older adults in U.S.,\nwe found that sense of mastery and depressive symptoms have\nreciprocal links among Whites but not Blacks. These Black-White\ndifferences are in line with other racial differences in psychosocial\nand medical correlates of depression (Sachs-Ericsson et al., 2007;\nand Assari, 2016) that collectively support the differential effect\nhypothesis and differential susceptibility to context.\nFrontiers in Aging Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 3 January 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 279\nAssari and Lankarani Depressive Symptoms-Mastery; Race Differences\nTABLE 1 | Descriptive Statistics for the analytic sample, stratified by race and overall.\nAll Whites Blacks\nMean SD Mean SD Mean SD\nn % n % n %\nEDUCATION\nMean SD Mean SD Mean SD\nMastery\nFIGURE 1 | Standardized regression weights for longitudinal associations between depressive symptoms and mastery over 3 years among White\nThese findings enhance our understanding regarding the\nrelevance of Beck's negative cognitive triad to racially diverse\ngroups. Based on Beck's theory, depression is a dysfunctional\nevaluation of self, others, and the future (Beck et al., 1990).\nIt has been previously shown that depression and hopelessness\n(dysfunctional evaluation of the future) have stronger links\namong Whites than Blacks (Assari and Lankarani, 2016a). These\nfindings suggest that race may alter how distorted evaluation\nof self, others, and the future reflects depression among\npopulations. These findings have major clinical implications for\npsychotherapy and cognitive therapy of depression in diverse\npopulations (Assari and Lankarani, 2016a).\nFrontiers in Aging Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 4 January 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 279\nAssari and Lankarani Depressive Symptoms-Mastery; Race Differences\nFIGURE 2 | Standardized regression weights for longitudinal associations between depressive symptoms and mastery over 3 years among Black\nTABLE 2 | Longitudinal associations between depressive symptoms and mastery over 3 years among White and Black older adults.\nWhites Blacks\nB (SE) P B P\nW1 Depressive symptoms\nW1 Mastery\nW1 Mastery\nW1 Depressive symptoms\nW1 Gender (Female)\nW1 Education (High school diploma)\nW1 Education (High school diploma)\nunder review) have argued that social and psychological factors\noperate differently across racial and ethnic groups. Psychosocial\nprocesses may operate in unique manners that are distinct across\neach racial and ethnic group (Lincoln et al., 2003). In this view,\nthe assumption of similarity between Blacks and Whites is the\nresult of an absence of previous studies on race/ethnic differences,\nand does not have empirical evidence (Hunt, 1996; Hunt et al.,\nfindings suggest that the psychosocial processes that result in\ndepression may depend on race.\nRacial groups have unique histories, values, and cultures,\nwhich combine with life circumstances and experiences that\nmake them differently vulnerable or resilient to risk and\nprotective factors. In this view, the very same social factors, and\nthe very same psychosocial theory may differently operate across\nall social groups (Lincoln et al., 2003). Understanding of group\ndifferences in psychosocial processes that contribute to health\nFrontiers in Aging Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 5 January 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 279\nAssari and Lankarani Depressive Symptoms-Mastery; Race Differences\nand illness is essential for the promotion of health and wellbeing\nthrough altering social or psychological factors across diverse\npopulations (Lincoln et al., 2003). This argument is core to the\ndifferential effect hypothesis (Assari, 2016d).\nIt has been shown that overall social support and support\nfrom fellow church members are stronger predictive factors\nagainst psychological distress and depressive symptoms among\nAssari showed that religious (church-based) social support fully\nmediated the association between church attendance and overall\nlife satisfaction for Blacks but not Whites (Assari, 2013). These\nare all in line with what Skarupski et al., called the Blacks' \"faith\nadvantage in health\" (Skarupski et al., 2013).\nOur finding adds to the existing knowledge on racial\ndifferences in the complex associations between socioeconomic\nstatus (SES), psychosocial resources (e.g., social support, coping,\nRace modifies how SES affects depression, health behaviors,\ndepression is linked to obesity (Sachs-Ericsson et al., 2007;\nRace differences in vulnerabilities to the effect of risk and\nprotective factors may be a consequence of racial differences\nin exposure to psychosocial risk and protective factors (Ferraro\ndepression or mastery (Moazen-Zadeh and Assari, 2016), or\nracial differences in what psychosocial constructs reflect (Assari\net al., 2016c). These non-specific racial differences suggest that\nrace does not have a direct effect on health, or simply through\nSES, but has contextual effects that alter how resources and risk\nfactors impact physical or mental health (Capistrant et al., 2013;\nThe missing link between depressive symptoms and mastery\namong Blacks may explain why depressive symptoms have\nweaker effects on self-rated health, medical conditions, and\nmortality among Blacks compared to Whites (Drevenstedt, 1998;\nIn a consistent pattern, regardless of the type of the predictor,\npsychological variables better predict physical and mental health\noutcomes for Whites compared to Blacks (Ferraro and Kelley-\nAssari, 2016e). These suggest higher resilience of Blacks toward\ndifferent risk factors, possibly due to historical exposure to\nadversity.\nOur findings may have implications for the elimination\nof racial health disparities in the US, which have existed\nfor several decades (Deaton and Lubotsky, 2003; Dressler\net al., 2005). This finding may also be relevant to the\nongoing increasing trends of mortality due to mental disorders,\ndepression, and alcohol use among White men (Case and\nDeaton, 2015). We believe that mastery is central to trajectories\nof mental disorders and chronic disease, particularly for\nWhites.\nOur study is subject to a number of limitations. First\nand foremost, we measured depressive symptoms, not major\ndepressive disorder, which would have required a structural\ninterview. We also did not measure history of anti depressant\nuse, which affects the course of depression. Third, we did not\ncontrol for potential confounders, such as stress, religiosity, social\nsupport, and cognitive ability. Fourth, we used short versions\nof standard measures of mastery and depressive symptoms.\nDespite these limitations, this study was one of the firsts on\nracial differences in the links between mastery and depressive\nsymptoms over time among older adults. Using a nationally\nrepresentative sample and large sample size of Blacks can be listed\nas strengths of this study.\nTo conclude, race alters the reciprocal and longitudinal\nassociations between depressive symptoms and sense of mastery\nover time. Black-White differences in the link between depression\nand mastery may explain why depression and depressive\nsymptoms better predict chronic medical conditions and\nmortality among Whites than Blacks. Future research should\ntest whether racial differences in the paths between depression\nand mastery is due to racial differences in quality of depression\nand control beliefs, racial differences in availability and effects of\npsychosocial factors (e.g., SES, religiosity, and social support) or\ndifferential salience of dysfunctional attitudes about self, others,\nand the future explain these differences between Blacks and\nWhites.\nAll procedures followed were in accordance with the\nethical standards of the responsible committee on human\nexperimentation (institutional and national) with the Helsinki\nwas obtained from all participants included in the study.\nThe University of Michigan Institutional review board (IRB)\napproved the study protocol.\nSA designed and analyzed this work, and contributed to revision.\nML drafted and revised the paper.
