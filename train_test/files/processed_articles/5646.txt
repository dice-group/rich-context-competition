Pain relief is important for\npreventing complications, including atelec-\ntasis, chest infection, and respiratory fail-\nure.2 These complications, if severe, may be\nmore harmful than the injury itself, and can\nbe life-threatening.\nParavertebral block (PVB), through\ninjecting a local anaesthetic agent close to\nwhere the spinal nerves exit the interverte-\nbral foramina, can provide high-quality\nipsilateral, segmental, somatic, and sympa-\nthetic nerve blockade. PVB is a successful\nregional method for amelioration of pain in\npatients undergoing esophagectomy,3 breast\nsurgery,4 thoracotomy,5 cardiac surgery,6\nhepatectomy,7 inguinal herniorrhaphy,8 per-\ncutaneous nephrolithotomy,9 and nephrec-\ntomy.10 Thoracic paravertebral block\n(TPVB) has also been used for pain relief\nof MRFs.11\u00ad13 Differences in the efficacy and\nsafety between TPVB and traditional anal-\ngesia for MRFs, including thoracic epidural\nanalgesia (TEA) and intravenous analgesia,\nneed to be considered. Mohta et al.14\nshowed that TPVB was as effective as TEA\nfor pain treatment in patients with unilateral\nMRFs. However, comparison between\nTPVB and intravenous analgesia in patients\nwith MRF has rarely been reported.\nTherefore, this study aimed to assess the\neffect of TPVB on pain management and\npreservation of pulmonary function com-\npared with intravenous patient-controlled\nanalgesia (IVPCA) in patients with MRFs.\nMaterials and methods\nPatients and procedures\nThe study was conducted at Ningbo 6th\nHospital (Ningbo, China) between January\napproved by the ethics committee of Ningbo\n6th Hospital and written informed consent\nwas obtained from each patient. This pro-\nspective, randomized study included 90 adult\npatients of either sex, having three or more\nunilateral fractured ribs. The exclusion cri-\nteria were as follows: age <18 or >70 years;\nsevereheadinjuryorunconsciousness;patho-\nlogical obesity (body mass index !35); thor-\nacic and abdominal visceral injuries; unstable\ncardiac status; severe liver or kidney disease;\ncoagulopathy; spinal or pelvic fracture; infec-\ntion at the puncture site; and allergy to local\nanaesthetics. The patients' characteristics are\nshown in Table 1.\nOn arrival to the anaesthetic room, intra-\nvenous access was established, and standard\nmonitors were applied, including electrocar-\ndiography, noninvasive blood pressure, and\npulse oximetry. All of the patients received\noxygen via a nasal cannula to maintain\n> 90% blood oxygen saturation and\nnone of them received mechanical ventila-\ntion. By using the sealed envelope technique,\nthe patients were assigned randomly to the\nTPVB or IVPCA group. In the TPVB\ngroup, the patients were placed in the lateral\ndecubitus position. A 7.5-MHz linear ultra-\nsound probe (LOGIQ a-200 E, GE\nHealthcare, Waukesha, USA) was used to\nidentify the spinous process, transverse pro-\ncess, pleura, superior costotransverse liga-\nment, and the paravertebral space at the\ntarget vertebral level. After standard skin\ndisinfection, a 20-gauge, 8-cm puncture\nneedle (Pajunk GmbH Medizintechnologie,\nGeisingen, Germany) was inserted into the\nTable 1.

After negative\naspiration for blood and cerebrospinal fluid,\n15 ml of 0.5% ropivacaine was injected. The\nsolution in the TPVB pump contained\ntinuous infusion rate was set at 5 mL/h. The\nbolus dose was 5 mL and the lockout inter-\nval was 15 minutes. In the IVPCA group,\nsufentanil 2 mg/kg diluted in normal saline\nwas used as the IVPCA solution and the\nvolume was 100 mL. The continuous deliv-\nery dose was set at 2 mL/h. The bolus dose\nwas 2 mL with a 15-minute lockout time.\nFor each patient, oral acetaminophen\nLow-dose tramadol 1 mg/kg was adminis-\ntered when the visual analogue scale (VAS)\nscore was greater than 4 as rescue analgesia.\nMeasurements and sample\nsize calculation\nTrained nurses who were blinded to the\npatient's treatment collected various data.\nPain at rest and on coughing was estimated\nwith the VAS pain score (0, no pain; 10,\nworst imaginable pain). Blood gas analysis\nwas performed to measure arterial partial\npressure of oxygen (PaO2\n), arterial partial\npressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2\n/\nFraction of inspiration oxygen (FiO2\n), and\nAlveolar - arterial oxygen partial pressure\ndifference (P(A\u00ada)\n) These parameters were\nrecorded pre-analgesia (T0\npost-analgesia (T1\n), and on post-analgesia\n). Bedside\nspirometry (forced vital capacity (FVC),\nforced expiratory volume in one second\n(FEV1)/FVC, and the peak expiratory flow\nrate [PEFR]) was measured by using a\nventilometer (CHEST HI-701; YILIAN\nMedicine, Shanghai, China) at T0\n, and\n. All anaesthesia-related adverse events\nwere also recorded.\nThis study aimed to compare the efficacy\nand safety of TPVB as a method of pain relief\nfollowing MRFs compared with IVPCA.\nThe primary outcome measurement was the\nVAS score at rest.

The clinical analgesic methods for\nMRFs include TEA, TPVB, and intravenous\nanalgesia. Analyses of the advantages and\ndisadvantages of these different analgesic\nmethods are helpful in clinical practice.\nTPVB is technically less complex than\nother methods, and there are few absolute\ncontraindications.17 Because there is no need\nfor use of opioids, urinary retention and\npruritis are not concerns with TPVB.17\nHowever, rapid absorption of local anaes-\nthetic enables toxicity, especially if more\nthan one catheter is place.17 Previous studies\nhave already shown the advantages of TPVB\ncompared with TEA in patients with MRFs.\nPVB shows similar analgesic effects com-\npared with epidural anaesthesia with fewer\ncomplications.14 Therefore, our study\nfocussed on analgesic efficacy, protection of\nrespiratory function, and adverse effects of\nTPVB compared with IVPCA.\nIn our study, pain scores at rest (T1\nand\n) and during coughing (T1\n) were sig-\nnificantly lower in the TPVB group than in\nthe IVPCA group. This finding indicated that\nTPVB may provide a better analgesic effect\nthan IVPCA. These findings are consistent\nwith the results of previous studies as follows.\nA previous study showed that paravertebral\nblock was associated with improved post-\noperative pain relief compared with intra-\nvenous analgesia in patients undergoing\nherniorrhaphy.18 TPVB is also superior to\nIVPCA in pain management after thoracot-\nomy.19 Additionally, TPVB is more effica-\ncious for prolonging postoperative analgesia\nand reducing morbidity in patients undergo-\ning elective unilateral breast surgery.20\nAnother interesting finding of our study is\nthat there was a significant difference in post-\nanalgesia pulmonary function between the\nTPVB and IVPCA groups. We observed\nhigher FVC, FEV1/FVC, PEFR, PaO2\n, and\n, and lower P(A\u00ada)\nin the TPVB\ngroup compared with the IVPCA group. The\nincidence of pulmonary complications was\nsignificantly higher with IVPCA compared\nwith TPVB. Bilgin et al.21 also observed a\nsignificant reduction in FEV1 and FVC in\nthe systemic analgesia group compared with\nthe TPVB group 24 h and 48 h after thora-\ncotomy. Two possible reasons could explain\nthe advantages of TPVB in pulmonary\nfunction protection. First, in our study,\nTPVB was superior to IVPCA for analgesia,\nand resulted in lower pain scores, especially\nduring coughing. Effective analgesia in the\nTPVB group is conducive to deep breathing\nand coughing, thereby improving lung func-\ntion. Second, sufentanil, a synthetic opioid,\nwas used in the IVPCA group. Respiratory\ndepression is one of the most feared side\neffects of opioids.22 For patients with MRFs,\npowerful opioids are depressants and sup-\npress coughing, and may promote\nTable 4. Effects of TPVB and IVPCA on pulmonary function.\nFactors\nTPVB group IVPCA group\n; #P < 0.05 compared with the IVPCA group.\nrespiratory complications even as they\nreduce pain.17 Moreover, in the present\nstudy, IVPCA was associated with a signifi-\ncantly higher incidence of nausea and vomit-\ning, another common side effect of opioid\nanalgesics compared with TPVB.23 Taken\ntogether, these results suggest that TPVB\nmay be a safer analgesic method for MRFs\nthan IVPCA.\nThere are some limitations of our study.\nFirst, we only collected data at a few time\npoints to avoid disturbing the patients.\nSecond, some parameters, such as blood\npressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate,\nwere not included in this study. Studies that\ncontain more parameters need to be\nincluded in future studies.\nIn conclusion, our study shows that TPVB\nis superior to IVPCA in pain relief and\npreservation of pulmonary function for\npatients with MRFs. Large-scale, multicen-\ntre studies are required to confirm our results.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interest\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial, or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
