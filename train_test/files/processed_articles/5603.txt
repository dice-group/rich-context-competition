Findings showed various amounts\nof response differences to both dependent variables by differences in race, gender, and race-gender of respondents, vis-\u00e0-\nvis those of the interviewers', thereby constituting various amounts of data inconsistencies. The effects of race, gender, and\nrace-gender of both interviewers and respondents constitute potential nonrandom errors that must be controlled in\ninterview survey research, otherwise, research findings and conclusions may diverge from true relationships between\nvariables.\n",

Olu Oyinlade1 and Alex Losen1\n Keywords\nrace effect, gender effect, interviewer effect, phily matches, homophily, heterophily\nThis study comprehensively analyzed differences in\ninterview response patterns by race, gender, and race-\ngender (i.e., race plus gender) of respondents by differences\nin race, gender, and race-gender of interviewers to\ndemonstrate the impacts of response inconsistencies on data\nquality obtained during survey interviews. For decades,\nseveral studies have identified interviewer effects as\nEllison, McFarland, & Krause, 2011; Krysan & Couper,\ninterviewer effects occur because the data collection\nprocess is an interactional process involving power\nrelationships, which favors the interviewer over the\nrespondent. Consequent to interviewer effects, data\ngenerated in an interview survey might reflect various\nforms of inaccuracies and misinterpretations (D. W. Davis,\nTo date, factors such as interviewer attitude (Durrant,\nGroves, Staetsky, & Steele, 2010), age (Collins & Butcher,\nrelative to interviewer effects on data quality. The most\ncommonly studied interviewer effects, however, have been\ngender (R. E. Davis, Couper, Janz, Caldwell, & Resnicow,\nRace and Gender Effects\nOverwhelmingly, studies on race-of-interviewer effects\nhave been predominant on Black1 respondents (D. W.\nPaepe, 2004),with a result pattern that showed that Blacks\naltered their responses to interview items based on the race\nFor example, Blacks admitted to White1 interviewers than\nto Black interviewers, that they (Blacks) lacked power to\nchange things or make a political difference through voting.\nThey (Blacks) also over reported having voted in an\nelection when interviewed by other Blacks than when\ninterviewed by Whites (D. W. Davis, 1997a). With specific\nreference to older people, Ellison et al. (2011) found that\nolder Blacks claimed higher levels of non-organizational\nreligious practices when interviewed by Whites than by\n1University of Nebraska, Omaha, NE, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nA.

On race sensitive issues such as discrimination,\nKrysan and Couper (2003) indicated that Blacks\nsignificantly denied racial discrimination against\nthemselves when the interviewer was White but not when\nthe interviewer was a fellow Black.\nLike Blacks, White respondents are also influenced by\nrace of the interviewer. Studies on White respondents (R. E.\nWhites gave more liberal responses on race-related\nquestions when interviewed by Blacks than by Whites.\nWhites also appear to acquiesce to race of interviewer on\nracially sensitive issues (D. W. Davis, 1997a). Whites\ninterviewed by Blacks were reluctant to oppose racially\ncentered policies, and Whites also minimized their\ntendencies for discrimination against Blacks when the\ninterviewer was Black but not when the interviewer was\naddition, when the interviewer was White rather than Black,\nWhite respondents strongly expressed trust of all Whites\nand preference for an all-White community (Krysan &\nPatterns of gender-of-interviewer effects appear\ninconsistent within and across studies. Flores-Macias and\nLawson (2008), for example, found gender-of-interviewer\neffects in bivariate analysis in their Mexico City data, that\nmen interviewed by women identified women's rights as a\n\"very urgent\" priority for the next president by 10\npercentage points more than men interviewed by men. Also,\nmen interviewed by men were more likely to favor\ncriminalizing abortion in the case of rape, than men\ninterviewed by women. In the same study, however, Flores-\nMacias and Lawson (2008) found women to be equally\nprogressive on abortion questions between men and women\ninterviewers, but they (women respondents) were less\nprogressive when interviewed by men on women's rights\nquestions. Also, in their Mexico national sample, Flores-\nMacias and Lawson indicated that there were virtually no\ndifferences in attitudes toward abortion among male\nrespondents by gender of interviewer, but women appear to\nbecome more progressive on abortion when interviewed by\nmen than by women. Like Flores-Macias and Lawson\nin their study of gender-of-interviewer effects. They found\nrespondents to be more pro-marriage when interviewed by\nwomen than by men interviewers, but they also indicated\nthat the likelihood of gender-of-interviewer effects was\ninconsistent across their statistical models.\nOther studies (Huddy et al., 1997; Kane & Macaulay,\n1993) found gender effects to be significant such that\nrespondents acquiesced to the gender of the interviewer.\nGong and Aadland (2011) also found gender effects\nwherein respondents demonstrated a significantly higher\nwillingness to pay for a curbside recycling program when\ninterviewed by women than when interviewed by men.\nWeinreb (2006), however, found that women responded\nsimilarly to women stranger-interviewers as to men\ninterviewers, but they (women respondents) gave different\nanswers to women-insider interviewers. Weinreb's findings\nstressed that, except for the \"insider situation\" in which the\nwoman interviewer was a recognized member of a\ncommunity, women respondents did not show a general\npattern of difference in response to interview questions\nbased on gender of interviewer (Weinreb, 2006).\nObjective\nWhile many studies had been done on interviewer effects,\nmost have been done on race-of-interviewer effects with a\npredominant focus on Black respondents (D. W. Davis,\nstudies (e.g., Finkel, Guterbock, Marian, & Borg, 1991; Gong\nincluded White respondents. Unlike race-of-interviewer\neffects, studies on gender-of-interviewer are much fewer,\ndespite the call by some studies (Oppenheim, 1992; Warren,\n1988) for more rigorous analyses of gender-of-interviewer\ninfluences on response behavior. Also, previous studies have\npredominantly analyzed either the race or gender-of-\ninterviewer effects, but not both in the same study, and\nstudies that analyzed both race and gender effects in the same\nstudy (e.g., Gong & Aadland, 2011) did not comprehensively\nanalyze all race-gender phily conditions in their analyses.\nThat is, a comprehensive analysis of differences in response\npatterns by the combination of race, gender, and race-gender\nof respondents, vis-\u00e0-vis those of the interviewer, have been\nlargely absent in previous studies. Based on the shortcomings\nof previous studies, the objective of this study was to\ncomprehensively test for differences in interview response in\nall possible phily matches involving race, gender, and race-\ngender of both respondent and interviewer, between Blacks\nand Whites, within the context of the same single study.\nTheoretical Guide: Inconsequentiality\nVersus Consequentiality of Interviewer\nEffects\nThis study is guided by two competing theoretical\nassumptions: the inconsequentiality versus consequentiality\nof interviewer effects on data quality. Many studies on\nTabane & Bouwer, 2006) have concluded that interview\nresponses showed a structured (i.e., nonrandom)\nrelationship between interviewer and respondent\ndemographic characteristics, especially when a question\nwas race or gender sensitive. Some other studies (Allen,\nhowever, concluded that interviewer effects were\ninconsequential to data quality. This position was earlier\nOyinlade and Losen 3\nclaimed by Schuman and Converse (1971) that differences\nobserved because of demographic characteristics of an\ninterviewer were just differences, rather than an indication\nof greater or lesser accuracy of response. Schuman and\nConverse contended that different answers to different\nracial categories of interviewers did not demonstrate\nevidence of data distortion or proof that the answers given\nto one category were more valid than those given to\nanother. D. W. Davis (1997a), however, argued that to\nignore interviewer effects, such as the influence of race and\ngender on data quality, was to ignore a legitimate source of\nvariance, capable of biasing data quality and statistical\nanalysis. In addition, to ignore the race-of-interviewer\neffects on respondents is to fail to be sensitive to everyday\nissues of race relations (D. W. Davis, 1997a).\nDistorted data could result from both mono- and cross-\ncultural conditions of data collection between interviewer\nand respondent. In mono-cultural situations, people tend to\nopen up to each other and talk more freely about sensitive\nissues than in cross-cultural conditions (Ghane, Kolk, &\nextreme demographic similarities exist between an\ninterviewer and an interviewee, the problem of potential\nconsensus (Webster, 1996), persuasion, and respondents'\ntendency to align their views with those of the interviewer,\nbecome highly realistic (Anderson & Alpert, 1974), and\ncapable of validating the discrete interaction distortion\nhypothesis (Webster, 1996). This hypothesis states that \"a\nperson is highly likely to distort his/her answers when\npositive attraction and the subsequent desire to impress\nexist in a temporary discrete interaction between two\nparties\" (Webster, 1996, p. 64). Cross-cultural interviewer-\nrespondent conditions tend to produce distorted data mainly\nbecause such conditions are often marred by language\ndifferences, lack of understanding of the other, and socio-\npolitical insensitivity (Tabane & Bouwer, 2006).\nTo measure the likelihood of data distortion due to the\nrace and gender of both interviewers and respondents through\nresponse inconsistences requires analyses of interview\nresponses under all possible phily conditions (homophilous\nand heterophilous) between interviewer and interviewee.\nUsing race and gender of both interviewer and respondent for\nphily matches, interview responses under all possible phily\nmatches (see Table 1) between interviewers and respondents\nneed to be analyzed, to determine the extent to which the\ncompeting ideas of whether interviewer effects are\ninconsequential or not to data quality are supported based on\nmono- or cross-cultural conditions. While analysis of cultural\ndifference is beyond the scope of this study, a comprehensive\nanalysis of demographic homo- and heterophily matches is\nadequate for studying interviewer effects under mono- and\ncross-cultural conditions between interviewer and\nrespondent. The assumption from our phily analyses, hence,\nare that interviewer effects will be regarded as consequential\nto data quality if response patterns during homophilous\nconditions are significantly different from heterophilous\nmatches between interviewers and respondents. Conversely,\ninterviewer effects will be regarded as inconsequential to data\nquality if patterns of interviewer response are similar in both\nhomo- and heterophilous conditions.\nMethod\nIndependent Variable\nTo assess differences in interview response by race, gender,\nand race-gender of respondents vis-\u00e0-vis race, gender, and\nrace-gender of interviewers, this study generated 24 phily\nmatches (8 homophilies and 16 heterophilies) between\nrespondents and interviewers as independent variables (see\nTable 1). All 24 phily matches, as independent variables,\nwere used to conduct a comprehensive analysis of interview\nresponse inconsistencies, of Black and White, and men and\nwomen respondents, vis-\u00e0-vis Black and White, and men\nand women interviewers on response patterns to two\nselected dependent variables.\nDependent Variables\nThe influences of race, gender, and race-gender phily\nmatches were tested on two separate dependent variables;\nsupport for affirmative action (AA) practice, and support\nfor America's Affordable Health Choices Act (AHC) of\n2009. These two government policies were selected as\ndependent variables because they readily generate public\nopinion, and they allowed us the opportunity to analyze\nphily effects on one policy which explicitly made\nprovisions for race and gender in its letters (AA), and one\nthat neither explicitly nor implicitly made references to race\nand gender (AHC). This will help to affirm or deny the\ncommonality of race and gender effects on both race and\ngender sensitive and neutral topics.\nSupport for AA\nThe selection of support for AA practice as a dependent\nvariable was based on literature that affirmed the language\nof AA as explicitly race and gender specific (U.S.\nCommission on Civil Rights, 1981) and literature that has\nconcluded that race of interviewer significantly shaped\ninterviewees' responses on race-sensitive items (Alderfer &\nhas also been established to be racially sensitive and gender\npatterned. Minorities, especially Blacks, for example, are\nmore likely to support AA than non-Hispanic Whites, and\nwomen are more likely to favor the policy than men\n1998). It was, therefore, anticipated in this study that\ninterview response to this variable would be shaped by race\nand gender phily matching of both interviewer and\ninterviewee. The measurement of this variable (support for\nAA) is explained under \"measures.\"\n4 SAGE Open\nTable 1.

The Act was written to make\nhealth care affordable for all Americans, and its text was\nrace and gender neutral (Congress.Gov, 2009). The central\ntheme in the debate on AHC, arguably, has been racial and\ngender neutral, but mainly political (Democrats vs.\nRepublicans; Liberals vs. Conservatives, etc.). Because of\nits popularity in the media, and the political tones (rather\nthan racial or gendered) of the debates, we anticipated that\nrespondents would have opinions on the bill, and their\nopinions might be racially and gender neutral. This\nassumption was not borne out of naivety for the general\npotential influences of race and gender on social issues in\nthe United States. We are well aware that the\ncharacterization of AHC as \"Obamacare\" may be laden\nwith negative racial undertones, but the policy, however,\nprovided us an opportunity for phily comparisons with AA\npolicy, a much more confirmed racially and gender\nsensitive social policy. The following research question was\nanswered to meet the objective of this study:\nResearch Question: How were the levels of support for\nAA and AHC different by race, gender, and race-gender\nphilies? That is, how were the levels of support for AA\nand AHC different by race, gender, and race-gender of\nrespondents, vis-\u00e0-vis race, gender, and race-gender of\ninterviewers?\nAnswers to this question would show patterns of change\n(i.e., inconsistencies) in respondents' answers to interview\nquestions on both AA and AHC by race, gender, and race-\ngender of respondents relative to race, gender, and race-\ngender of interviewers.\nMeasures\nA separate scale was constructed to measure support for AA\nand support for AHC. AA describes any measure, beyond\nsimple termination of a discriminatory practice, adopted to\ncorrect or compensate for past or present discrimination, or\nto prevent discrimination from recurring in the future\n(Office of Federal Contracts Compliance Programs\nItems used to measure support for AA in this study (see\nTable 2), were adapted from Parra (1991). We defined AHC\nas a program intended to ensure that every American had an\naffordable health care insurance through an employer or\nthrough government. We were unable to secure any existing\nscale that measured support for AHC, so we constructed\none based on general knowledge of the bill, as commonly\nexpressed in popular media. We used general media\nknowledge about the bill because we assumed that most\npeople in the public would not have read the actual scripts\nof the bill, and that they would have formed opinions on the\nbill mainly based on information (accurate or not) obtained\nfrom the media. We justified this approach to scale\nconstruction because we deemed it sufficient for the\nobjective of this study, which was the measurement of\nchange in answers to interview questions based on race and\ngender phily matches.\nEach scale was summated rating Likert-type, and\ncontained seven fully structured, closed-ended items, with\nresponse options ranging from 6 (strongly agree) to 1\n(strongly disagree). Higher values indicated greater support\nfor each variable. Closed ended questions were used so as\nto generate data with quantitative properties for statistical\nanalysis.\nReliability statistics yielded Cronbach's alpha = .923 for\nthe scale of support for AA and .942 for the scale of support\nfor health care reform (see Table 2).

Other items on the questionnaire were\nnominal questions on the race (Black or White) and gender\n(man or woman) of both the interviewer and respondents.\nData\nTwenty-nine university students (Whites = 62% [n = 18],\n= 5]) served as survey interviewers for this research. To\nenhance the consistence in their performance, all the\ninterviewers were assembled and trained in interviewing\ndata collection. The training included guidelines for\npoliteness when requesting someone to be interviewed, and\nreadily granting right of non-participation to anyone not\nwilling to participate in the study. Interviewers were also\ninstructed to promise anonymity to all willing participants.\nDuring each interview, the interviewers were instructed to\nonly read interview questions verbatim as structured on the\nquestionnaire, and to record respondents' answers exactly\nas stated by respondents, and in conformity with the closed-\nended response format of each question. Interviewers were\ninstructed not to explain, interpret, or discuss any\nquestionnaire item to research participants. Interviewers\ncould only repeat (reread) questions, if research participants\nwanted further information on a questionnaire item.\nInterview sites were public places with high foot traffic in\nthe city of Omaha, Nebraska. These locations were the four\nmajor city malls as well as strip malls, big department and\ndrug stores such as Wal-Mart, Target, Shopko, and\nWalgreens. The malls and stores spanned across all regions\n(North, South, East, and West) in the city, and they drew\npatrons from all areas of the city. The patrons of these\nlocations were solicited by our trained interviewers for\nvoluntary participation in this study. The interviewers went in\nself-selected teams of three or four people to each location to\nprovide support for one another as might be necessary. We\nalso anticipated that the mere presence of other interviewers\n6 SAGE Open\n(i.e., team members) at a location, at the same time, would\nencourage each interviewer to perform as instructed during\ntraining. Each team conducted interviews in, at least, two\ntime periods (morning, afternoon or evening) in, at least, two\ndifferent sites, during an 8-week period in fall 2010.\nConsistent with the objective of this study, all 29\ninterviewers were either Black or White, and they were\ninstructed to interview only Black and White voluntary\nparticipants. Of 580 questionnaires distributed to the 29\ninterviewers, a total of 522 questionnaires (90%) were\ncompleted. Thirty-one completed questionnaires of\nrespondents who identified themselves as neither Black, nor\nWhite were discarded for not being the target population for\nthis study. This left a useful return rate of 85% (491\nquestionnaires). Of the 491 useful interviews, 69% (n =\n338) were completed by White interviewers, while Black\ninterviewers completed 31% (n = 153) of the interviews.\nMen and women interviewers completed 63% (n = 310) and\n37% (n = 181), respectively, of the interviews. Counting by\nrace-gender, White men, White women, Black men and\nof useful interviews. The participants were mainly White\nconstituted 35% of all respondents, whereas White women,\nBlack men, and Black women constituted 34%, 19%, and\nTests and Findings\nANOVA coefficients with the Bonferroni/Dun post hoc\ncomparisons, at alpha = .05, were used to measure\nsignificant differences in support levels for AA and AHC\nunder various phily matches of race, gender, and race-\ngender of respondents and interviewers. ANOVA\ncomparisons indicated specific conditions (phily matches)\nunder which interview responses changed for any specific\nrespondent category, and post hoc results showed the extent\nof significant change in interview responses between any\ntwo categories of respondents vis-\u00e0-vis their respective\ncategories of interviewers. Findings for each test are\nreported under each phily area as follows:\nRace Phily\nInterview response differences under four possible race-\nphily conditions (two homophilies and two heterophilies)\nwere analyzed (Table 3).

The comparison revealed that White\nhomophily supported the two dependent variables\nsignificantly lesser than the Black homophily (M difference\n= 8 points for AA and 7 points for AHC). Except for the\nWhite homophily versus White-respondent/Black-\ninterviewer heterophily and the Black-respondent/White-\ninterviewer heterophily versus Black homophily\ncomparisons that were not significantly different in their\nsupport for both dependent variables, all other race-phily\ncomparisons showed significant differences in support of\nboth AA and AHC (see Table 4 for full result).\nGender Phily\nLike race-phily analyses, four possible gender phily conditions\n(two homophilies and two heterophilies) were also analyzed\nfor shifts in support levels for both AA and AHC (Table 3).\nANOVA coefficient showed that gender phily was a\nsignificant factor of support for both AA (b = 2.817) and AHC\n(b = 2.099) only when women were interviewed by men\n(gender heterophily). All other gender philies did not produce\nsignificant shifts in support for both dependent variables.\nThe Bonferroni/Dun post hoc gender phily analyses ( =\n.0083 for  = .05) showed that the largest significant difference\nin support for both AA and AHC was in the women-\nrespondent/men-interviewer versus men-respondent/women-\ninterviewer heterophily comparison. The former phily\noutscored the latter by 6.1 points for AA and 4.7 points for\nAHC. Results also showed that the men homophily gave\ngreater support for AA and AHC (M difference = 3.65 and 3.81,\nrespectively) than the men who were interviewed by women\n(men respondent/women interviewer heterophily comparisons).\nSee Table 4 for result details on post hoc gender comparisons.\nRace-Gender Phily\nInterview response patterns under all possible matches (4\nhomophily and 12 heterophily) were analyzed for race-gender\ndifferences in support for both dependent variables (Table 5).\nANOVA coefficients showed that White men displayed\nnegative attitude toward both programs, regardless of the race-\ngender of their interviewers. Statistically significant results\nindicated that White men were most negative about both AA\nand AHC when interviewed by White women (AA, b = \nnegative toward AA in the White men homophily (b = 5.808)\nand toward AHC when interviewed by Black men (b = \n4.305). In all other results involving White men as\nrespondents, the shifts in their support for both dependent\nvariables were not statistically significant.\nOyinlade and Losen 7\nTable 3.

All other phily matches involving Black\nwomen as respondents failed to show significant shifts in\nresponse to both dependent variables by Black women.\nThe Bonferroni/Dun post hoc analysis ( = .0004 for  =\n.05) calculated 120 possible separate post hoc race-gender\nphily comparisons for each dependent variable. Of the 120\nphily comparisons for each dependent variable,\ncomparisons for AA and AHC, respectively, indicated\nsignificant differences in interview response.

Similarly, the closest\ngap in phily comparisons was the 8.79 points higher support\nfor AHC by Black women interviewed by White men over\nthe White women homophily. See details of all differences\nin interview responses to both AA and AHC by race-gender\nphily post hoc comparisons in Table 6.\nConclusion\nThis study comprehensively analyzed, beyond the\nparameters covered by previous studies on the topic, the\nlikelihood that interviewer effects will be consequential (or\nnot) to data quality based on homo- and heterophily\ninterview conditions between interviewers and respondents.\nBy using ANOVA tests, in this study, we sought to examine\nTable 6.

For one, because of\nthe comprehensiveness of race, gender, and race-gender\nvariables in 24 different phily conditions we analyzed for\nresponse differences, the nature of the group differences in\nour analyses amounted to a 2  2  2  2 design with a four-\nway interaction. Interpreting four-way interactions are\nnotoriously complicated, which often pose additional\nchallenges in the presentation of findings for clarity. Also,\nthe 2  2  2  2 design complicates the creation of\ninteraction terms in OLS regression because the z scores\namount to 1 and 1, and multiplying these (using coded\ncontrasts) provides little clarity. Even with a concerted\nattempt to analyze the data using multilevel modeling by\nnesting the respondents into individual groups, the problem\nof limited number of degrees of freedom hindered such\nanalysis in OLS, and hence, making the 2  2  2  2\nANOVA the best analysis for our data and research\nquestions. Another hindrance to multilevel nesting of\ninterviewees in interviewers is that our data were not\nrecorded to allow linking particular set of interviews with\nparticular interviewers due to over conformity to\nconfidentiality and anonymity rights of both interviewers\nand respondents. The data collection method was however,\ndeliberate because the objective of this study was to test for\nmean differences in interview response by phily matches.\nOur research objective, therefore, justifies our choice of\ndata collection process and analysis.\nOur findings across all phily comparisons indicated a\ngeneral pattern of nonrandom (i.e., structured) interview\nresponse, hence, confirming consequentiality of interviewer\neffects on data quality. Our findings demonstrated a pattern\nof race, gender, and race-gender of interviewer effects based\non patterns homo- and heterophilous matches between\nOyinlade and Losen 11\ninterviewer and respondents. For example, the White\nhomophily showed a higher negative value for both AA and\nAHC than the White respondent/Black interviewer\nheterophily (see Table 3). Similarly, the Black homophily\nshowed a higher support for both dependent variables than\nthe Black respondent/White interviewer heterophily. Post hoc\ncomparisons also confirmed that the largest difference in\nsupport for both dependent variables was between the White\nhomophily and the Black homophily, and other differences in\nphily comparisons became smaller as the comparisons\nbecame more heterophilous. These findings support earlier\nfindings that respondents tended to acquiesce to the race of\nKrysan & Couper, 2003), and Whites tended to be more\nliberal and politically correct (R. E. Davis et al., 2010; Finkel,\nCouper, 2003), as well as reluctant to oppose racially\ncentered policy when interviewed by Blacks (Krysan &\nCouper, 2003). Our finding that gender difference in support\nfor both dependent variables was significant only when\nwomen were interviewed by men (Tables 3 and 4), indicated\nthat men had significant effects on how women answered\nquestions, but not vice versa.\nOur race-gender phily analyses specified particular\npatterns of race-gender influences of both respondents and\ninterviewers on interview responses. We found that White\nmen gave significantly different answers (higher negative\nresponse) to AA when interviewed by White women and\nfellow White men, but no significant difference was found\nwhen White men were interviewed by Black men and Black\nwomen. White men also gave significantly different\nanswers to AHC when interviewed by White women\n(higher negative response) and Black men (tempered\nnegative response) but gave no significantly different\nresponses when interviewed by White men and Black\nwomen. White women gave significantly different\n(negative) answers to AA and AHC only to White women\ninterviewers, but they gave no significantly different\nresponses to other race-gender categories of interviewers.\nResults also revealed that Black men gave significantly\ndifferent answers (positive response) to Black men and\nWhite men interviewers but gave no significantly different\nresponses to White women and Black women interviewers\non support for AA. For AHC, Black men gave significantly\ndifferent answers (positive response) to Black men, White\nmen and White women (negative response) interviewers but\ngave no significantly different response to Black women\ninterviewers. Last, Black women gave significantly\ndifferent (positive) answers to both dependent variables\nonly when interviewed by White men and Black men.\nThis study made some important contributions to existing\nliterature on the effects of extraneous variables on data\nquality. Unlike previous studies that focused mainly on\ninterviewer effects, this study paid attention to both\ninterviewer and respondent's characteristics. Also, unlike\nmost previous studies that focused only on one interviewer\neffect characteristic (e.g., race only, gender only, etc.) this\nstudy was based on multiple characteristics (race [Black and\nWhite], gender, and race-gender) of both respondents and\ninterviewers within the context of a single study. This study,\ntherefore, gives a more comprehensive analyses of race,\ngender, and race-gender effects on data quality in one single\nstudy than found in many (if not any) studies on the same\ntopic. Our analysis of race-gender effects (which were mostly\nabsent in previous studies) are especially important because\nevery individual is a combination of both race and gender,\nand neither is separable from the other in real-life\ninteractions. In addition, post hoc values showed specific\ndifferences in interview response between any two phily\ncategories, thereby providing knowledge on specific\ndirections and magnitude of response difference in interview\nresponse based on phily matches. We add that this study also\nprovide empirical confirmation to speculations in popular\nmedia that support for the America's Health Choices Act of\n2009 was race sensitive, even though the language of the bill\nwas race neutral, unlike the AA policy.\nOverall, this study reaffirms the significance of the need\nto pay attention to race, gender, and race-gender effects on\ndata quality during data collection. Both data quality and\nresearch integrity are at stake to the extent that race and\ngender of respondents and interviewers influence data\nquality when research participants conform their answers to\naccommodate the interviewer, thereby exaggerating or\ntempering the relationships between variables (D. W.\nscience research carry significant implications for practice\nand generalizations about society, it is important for data\ncollectors to devise methods to assess and nullify race and\ngender effects in their data and analyses.\nLimitations\nWe recognize the following limitations to the findings of\nthis study:\n1. There was an imbalance in the racial and gender\ncompositions of the survey interviewers, and a much\nlarger imbalance in the racial and gender compositions\nof the respondents by each interviewer category. There\nwere fewer Black respondents than White respondents,\nand the average numbers of cross-race interviews per\nperson were much smaller than for same-race\ninterviews for White interviewers. Black interviewers\nhad a much higher per capita cross-race interviews\n(though collectively they completed much lesser\namount of interviews) than White interviewers. Black\nwomen interviewers and Black women respondents\nwere also much fewer than other race-gender\ncombinations of interviewers and respondents. The\nreasons (beyond the scope of this study) for the\nimbalance in cross-race interviews were unclear, but\nwe suspected that the imbalance might have potentially\nbeen a function of lingering uncomfortable race\nrelations sentiments in the city. Because of traditional\ntension and discomfort in cross-race relations in the\ncity (and the United States in general), White\ninterviewers in this study might have been less inclined\nto readily approach Blacks for interview; hence, they\n(White interviewers) turned inwardly and interviewed\nmore Whites. For Back interviewers, it might have\nbeen a bit easier for them to solicit Whites for\ninterviews because they have always lived in a world\ndominated by Whites, and might have therefore,\ndeveloped a greater level of comfort than Whites in\nengaging in cross-racial activities. Another explanation\nfor the imbalance in cross-race interviews might be that\nbecause the interview was conducted in Omaha,\nNebraska, a predominantly White city, Blacks would\nhave more opportunities to interview Whites (because\nof the much larger White population) than vice versa.\nThis means that the imbalance in cross-race interview\ncould have been more of a function of structural factors\nof population distribution than tensions of race\nrelations.\n2. It was mentioned in literature review that some studies\nhad linked variables like age and education to\ndifferences in interview response. The focus in this\nstudy was strictly on race and gender phily analyses\nbeyond the scope of any previous study, hence, we\ndid not control for the potential influences of other\npossible variables. While the omission of other\nvariables in our analyses might be a source of\nlimitation to our results, it conversely helped to make\nour analyses streamlined, manageable, and focused on\nour research objective.\n3. Multilevel nesting of interviewees in interviewers\nwould have been ideal for data analyses had data been\ncollected in such a way to permit such analyses.\nNesting requires linking a particular interviewer to a\nparticular set of interviewees. An overly strict\nadherence to the privacy and anonymity rights of both\ninterviewers and interviewees prevented necessary\nidentification of particular set of interviews with\nparticular interviewer to enable nesting. Data were,\nhowever, collected consistently with the objective of\ntesting mean differences in interview response by\nphily matches using ANOVA.\n4. The Bonferroni correction, though necessary because\nof multiple post hoc tests to reduce the likelihood that\nany set of group comparisons would produce a Type I\nerror, is overly strict and might have hidden some\npotential significant group differences in our post hoc\ncomparisons.\nAuthors' Note\nMr. Losen was an undergraduate student and a mentee of the first\nauthor at the University of Nebraska at Omaha.\n"
