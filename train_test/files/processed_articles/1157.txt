Conservative Protestant men had a 1.1 7 0.45 higher body mass index (BMI) than those reporting no\nreligious affiliation. Other religion variables that initially had significant relationships with greater body weight before adjusting\nfor control variables became nonsignificant after smoking was controlled. No significant relationships between religion and body\nweight were present in women.\nCONCLUSIONS: Religious denomination was related to body weight in men. Other dimensions of religiosity showing a\nrelationship with higher BMI appeared to be because of the lower rates of smoking among more religious individuals.\nKeywords: religion; religiosity; body weight; health\nIntroduction\nExcess body weight is a global public health issue.1\u00ad3 The\nmost prevalent nutrition problem in many postindustrial\nsocieties,4 obesity is rising in incidence, leading many to\nlabel the current weight patterns as an `obesity epidemic'.5,6\nObesity has physical consequences for morbidity7,8,1 and\nsocial consequences such as stigmatization.9,10 Thus, the\nquest for understanding body weight is expanding to seek\nnew predictors. The current analysis examined a social factor\nthat has received little previous attention in relation with\nbody weight: religion.\nThe empirical evidence linking religion and health has\ngrown substantially over the last decade to the extent that\neven the most skeptical scientists are taking seriously the\nmyriad of literature identifying religion's association with\nbetter health.11 Numerous longitudinal, multivariate stu-\ndies12\u00ad14 have found `substantial positive effects of religious\ninvolvement on variousy physical health outcomes, in-\nBody weight may be a mediator between religion and\nmortality,14 with religion possibly serving as a protective\nfactor against extreme overweight.16,17 Religion may con-\ntribute to decreased body weight in several ways.\nStress or anxiety is related to higher body weight,18\u00ad20\nparticularly in women.21 Stress-induced eating can trigger\nonset and relapses of obesity and increase preferences for\nhigh fat and/or sweet foods.18 Religion is a means through\nwhich some people counter and cope with stress,22 and may\ndecrease body weight through helping adherents cope with\nstressors.\nSocial support provided by religion may be another\nSocial support predicted lower children's obesity risk in\nDenmark24 and in the United States,25 and the weight loss\nliterature frequently cites social support as a critical compo-\nnent in successful long-term weight loss.26,27 Religious social\nsupport may not only promote decreased body weight, but\nalso provide the social support needed for weight loss and\nComponents of religious theology may also discourage\nobesity. In historical Catholicism, depriving the body of food\nwas analogous to purity.29 In Judaism, the human body is\nconsidered to be made in the image of God.30 And among\nConservative Protestants, the body is taught to be the\n`temple of the Holy Spirit'.31 Viewing one's body as made\nin the image of and the home of deity may promote good\nhealth and thus ideal body weight. Given the greater\nemphasis on good health through seeing the body as sacred,\nthe religious may be more physically active than their\nless religious counterparts.32,33 Since physical activity is\nassociated with healthy weight and moderate weight lossF\n*Correspondence: KH Kim, Division of Nutritional Sciences, Cornell\nE-mail: khk4@cornell.edu\nwww.nature.com/ijo\nparticularly long-term weight lossFincreased activity of the\nreligious may encourage lower body weight.34\u00ad36 A religion\nviewing the body as sacred may also encourage a healthy\ndiet: those with more frequent religious practice and\nattendance made healthier food choices as measured by\nbreakfast, green vegetable, and fruit intake.32 Further, certain\ndenominations, such as Seventh Day Adventists, promote a\nvegetarian diet, which has been associated with lower body\nReligion's relations with body weight has not been\nextensively examined. A few studies investigating the\nassociation between religion and health have only used\nbody mass index (BMI) as a control in multivariate\nanalysis.12,13 Even fewer studies of religion have considered\nbody weight and the mechanisms surrounding it as outcome\nmeasures. In two US community samples, denomination\n(Protestant vs Catholic) was not associated with obesity,38\nalthough Episcopalians were less obese than Lutherans\nin one sample.39 However, it is uncertain whether the\nrelationship between denomination and body weight was\nbecause of religion, ethnicity, or sampling differences. In\na Dutch sample, men who attended church more than\nonce a month had a lower BMI than those who attended\nchurch less than once a month,40 but church members\nhad significantly higher BMIs than nonchurch members\nand were more likely to be 20% overweight in a cross-\nsectional community sample.41 Analysis of US National data\nfound that those with more extensive religious practice\ntended to be more obese.42 However, the measure of\nreligious practice in that analysis included predominately\nsedentary activities (ie watching religious television) and\nthus could have been measuring inactivity more than\nreligiosity. Given the dearth of research and mixed findings\nof studies about religion's relationship with body weight,\nthis analysis sought to examine religion and body weight in\ngreater depth.\nGiven the previous literature finding that religion is\nassociated with better physical health11\u00ad14 and overweight\nis associated with poor health,7,8,1 we hypothesized that\ngreater religiosity (religious practice, application, social\nsupport, identity, and commitment) is related to lower body\nweight, with psychosocial and health behaviors as media-\ntors. We did not hypothesize religious denomination's\nrelationship with body weight because the literature regard-\ning religious denomination's connection with body weight is\nunclear. Demographic antecedents were hypothesized to\ninfluence, but not fully determine, the relationship between\nreligion and weight. These hypotheses were examined in a\nUS national data set.\nMethods\nData\nData from the National Survey of Midlife Development in\nthe United States (MIDUS) were analyzed. A cross-sectional\nstudy conducted in 1995, MIDUS consisted of two parts: a\ntelephone survey and a mailed questionnaire. Households\nwere selected with random digit dialing and then one\nadult per household was randomly selected. The sample\nwas nationally representative of the English-speaking,\nnoninstitutionalized US population ages 25\u00ad74 with tele-\nphones.\nThe MIDUS telephone interview lasted approximately\n40 min, and those respondents were subsequently mailed a\nwritten questionnaire. The response rate for completing both\nMissing values for the religion variables were treated as\nmissing for the current analysis.\nIndependent variables\nReligion is a complex, multidimensional construct, and\nthere is not a consensus about how religion should be\nconceptualized and measured. Prior literature43,44 and\nrelevance to the study's hypotheses were considered in\ndeciding how religion was conceptualized in the present\nstudy. The religion items in the MIDUS data were grouped\ninto six categories: denomination, practice/attendance,\napplication, identification, subjective commitment/impor-\ntance, and religious social support.\nDenomination questions asked respondents what their\nreligious preference was, and for this analysis the denomina-\ntions were collapsed to maximize a meaningful interpreta-\ntion of denomination's possible relationship with body\nweight. Given the considerations of previous research-\ners,45,46 religious denomination for this analysis was grouped\ninto six categories: Catholic, Conservative Protestant, Main-\nline Protestant, Jew, Other, and No Religious Preference.\nReligious Practice is a standard component of religiosity\nthat is often analyzed.43,47 MIDUS respondents were asked to\nchoose from five categories describing how often they attend\nreligious or spiritual services, with higher scores indicating\ngreater religious practice.\nReligious Application was assessed by asking respondents\nhow often they asked themselves what their religious or\nspiritual beliefs suggest they should do in making daily life\ndecisions, with higher scores indicating stronger religious\napplication.\nReligious Social Support was assessed through the ques-\ntion, `How often do you seek religious comfort', with four\nresponse categories ranging from `never' to `often'.\nReligious Identity (a \u00bc 0.84) was a continuous multi-item\nmeasure constructed from four single-item categorical vari-\nables. An example of these questions is, `How important do\nyou think it is for people of your religion to marry other\npeople who are the same religion.' Higher scores indicated\nstronger religious identity.\nReligious Commitment (a \u00bc 0.88) was a sum of four\nquestions about how religious and spiritual respondents\nconsidered themselves, and how important they considered\nreligion and spirituality to be in their lives. Higher scores\nindicated greater commitment.\n \nKH Kim et al\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nDependent variable\nWeight and height were self-reported in the questionnaire\nand used to calculate BMI. The accuracy of self-reported\nweight and height is generally seen as adequate for survey\nresearch.48\u00ad50 Excluding the cases with missing values and\nimplausible outliers, the total BMI sample size available for\nBody weight was also conceptualized as weight categories,\nwhere overweight was signified by a BMI greater than\ncategory `underweight' (BMI of less than 18.5) was not\nanalyzed because there were too few cases (36 women and 5\nmen) to offer sufficient statistical power for a separate\nanalysis.\nDemographic variables\nDemographics of gender, age, socioeconomic status, race/\nethnicity, marital status, region, and geographic density were\nassessed.51 Using the mean income of gender, marital status,\neducation, age, employment, and race, missing values for\nincome were imputed.52,53 Cases where income was imputed\nwere not significantly related to BMI.\nHealth behavior variables\nPhysical activity was assessed through two continuous scales:\nreported activity has been found to correlate highly with\nDrinking was assessed through a six category variable as\nnumber of drinks per month, whereas smoking was assessed\nas `smoking now' or `not regularly smoking now'. Self-\nreported alcohol consumption and smoking status are\nconsidered to be adequately reliable and valid for epidemio-\nPsychosocial variables\nPerceived social support was assessed by two scales:\nscale was created by summing five questions, for example,\n`How much do members of your family (friends) really\ncare about you?' Higher scale values indicated greater\nsupport. If respondents answered at least 60% of the family\nor friends support scales, the remaining items of each scale\nwere imputed using the mean value of gender, age, and\nPerceived stress was measured in four domains:\nwork stress, home stress, financial stress, and number of\nstressors. Each continuous index was constructed to indicate\nthe extent to which respondents perceived high stress.60\nPerceived stress questions included, `Did you have\nany serious ongoing problems getting along with some-\none at work', `At home, how often do they have too\nmany demands made of you,' and `How difficult is it for\nyou (and your family) to pay your monthly bills?' The\nwork, home, and financial indexes were then added to\nform a total stress index, with a higher score indicating\ngreater perceived stress. To measure the number of stressors,\nrespondents were asked whether they themselves or mem-\nbers of their families experienced problems in the last year,\nincluding chronic disease, frequent minor illnesses, and\nemotional problems.\nSocial selection vs social causation: size discrimination\nanalysis\nRelations between religion and weight may involve bidirec-\ntional causality.61,62 Social causation may occur when\nreligious involvement influences weight through religious\nactivities and beliefs that are a part of peoples' lives.\nAlternatively, social selection may occur when weight shapes\nreligious involvement where people who are fatter or thinner\nare differentially included or excluded in religious organiza-\ntions and activities. To consider the direction of causality\nbetween religion and body weight, differential participation\nof individuals in religious groups and activities was exam-\nined by testing whether people who report experiencing\ndiscrimination on the basis of their weight or height were\nmore or less religious.\nAnalyses\nFrequencies were examined for all variables, then multiple\nregression using PROC SURVEYREG from SAS 8.2 was\nconducted to test religion's relation with BMI. Since the\netiology of body weight differs greatly between men and\nwomen,63 separate regressions were conducted by gender.\nSampling weights were used in all regression analyses to\nprovide nationally representative results.64\nA series of regression models were run to test the relations\nbetween religion and weight. Religion variables were each\nentered separately in assessing their relation to BMI because\nthe complex nature of religion is such that different\ndimensions of religion have different pathways in their\neffects on health.23,65 BMI was regressed on the demographic\nvariables to account for demographic variation in BMI. Then,\ncontrolling for demographics, BMI was regressed on religion\nvariables in Model 1. To test the role of health behaviors as a\nmediator between religion and BMI, health behaviors were\nadded in Model 2. In Model 3, psychosocial variables were\nadded to the religionFBMI model to examine their\npotential roles as mediators. Model 4 examined religion's\nrelation with BMI after taking into account demographics,\nhealth behaviors, and psychosocial factors.\nLogistic regressions using PROC LOGISTIC were also\nconducted for all models with the categorical variables of\noverweight and obesity. Demographics were controlled in all\nlogistic regression analyses.\n \nKH Kim et al\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nResults\nFrequencies\nSlightly more women than men were in the sample, the\naverage age for both women and men was 47, and the\nmajority of the sample was white (Table 1). Over half of the\nwomen and men had at least some college education, with\nmen more likely to have a college education. Women's\nreported average household annual income was over\nwas married, and represented the different regions of the\nUnited States. About a third of respondents were from large\nMetropolitan Areas. The sample represented the US popula-\ntion with the exception of education and income, which\nMost of the sample was either Catholic or Protestant, and a\nslightly greater proportion of men than women specified\ntheir religious preference to be either agnostic, atheist, or of\nno religious preference. Women reported an overall greater\nTable 1 Weighted frequencies\nVariable Mean or percent\nDemographics\nEducation\nRegion\nEast North Central and West North Central 26% 29%\nWest North Central, South Atlantic, and East South Central 34% 36%\nIndependent variables\nDenomination\nNo Religious Preference 12% 7%\nHealth behavior variables\nPsycho-social variables\nDependent variable\naImputed.\n \nKH Kim et al\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nreligiosity than men, especially in the religious social\nsupport item and the importance of religiosity and spiri-\ntuality items.\nOver half of the men (56%) reported drinking alcohol\nmore than three drinks a week, compared to only 25% of\nwomen. Nearly, a quarter of the sample currently smoked.\nOn average, MIDUS respondents reported engaging in\nrelatively low moderate activity, with women reporting\ngreater moderate and vigorous activity levels than men.\nThe sample reported higher levels of vigorous activity than\nmoderate activity.\nWomen reported higher friend and family support com-\npared to men. Although the total stress levels between men\nand women were comparable, women reported a higher\nnumber of stressors. The mean BMI for both women and\nmen was 27, and nearly 60% of the sample was classified as\neither overweight or obese.\nRegression analyses\nWhen BMI was regressed on the demographic variables of\nage, race, education, income, marital status, city size, and\nregion, the results for women and men were consistent with\nthose found in the existing social epidemiology of obesity\nControlling for demographics, the religion variables were\nthen included in regression models as the independent\nvariable, with BMI as the continuous dependent variable\n(Model 1). For men, a significant relationship of BMI with\ndenomination existed, with Conservative Protestants and\nMainline Protestants having higher BMIs than those indicat-\ning no religious preference, agnosticism, or atheism. Con-\nservative Protestant men were about 1.13 BMI units (B5 lb)\nheavier than the reference group of no religious preference,\nwhereas Mainline Protestants were 0.93 BMI units heavier\ncompared to the reference group (Model 1 of Table 2). There\nwere also significant relationships of BMI with Religious\nReligious Identity (0.11), with more religious men reporting\nhigher BMIs. For women, no significant relationships of\nreligious variables to BMI were present (Model 1 of Table 3).\nTo examine possible mediating effects of health behaviors\nin the relationship between religion and BMI in men,\ndrinking, smoking, and activity were included in regression\nmodels (Model 2 of Table 2). With the addition of health\nbehaviors, the relationship between the denomination of\nMainline Protestant and BMI was no longer significant for\nmen, whereas the association between the denomination of\nConservative Protestant and BMI remained significant,\nalthough it decreased in strength (Model 2 of Table 2). With\nthese health behavioral mediators, the relationships of\nReligious Social Support and Religious Application to body\nweight became nonsignificant for men, whereas Religious\nIdentity's relationship with BMI remained relatively un-\nchanged. In partitioning out how each individual health\nbehavior affected religion's relationship with BMI for men,\nadding smoking alone to the model resulted in the decreased\nmagnitude and nonsignificance of the religion variables in\ntheir relation to BMI, whereas the other health behavior\nvariables had little influence when entered alone.\nThe psychosocial variables of social support and stress were\nalso examined as potential mediators (Model 3). For men,\nadding psychosocial measures appeared to magnify religion's\nrelationship with BMI, either increasing the magnitude of\nthe effects or making some formerly not significant terms\nsignificant. The relationship of BMI to religious attendance,\nreligious commitment, and the denomination of Catholi-\ncism became significant for men, whereas the relationship of\nbody weight to the denomination of Conservative Protestant\nincreased the relationships in magnitude and significance\n(Model 3 of Table 2). Cases where friend social support was\nimputed were highly significant (Po0.01).\nIn the final model (Model 4), demographics, health\nbehaviors, social support, and stress were included in\nTable 2 Regression of religion on BMIFMena\nReligion variable Model 1 controlling for\ndemographics\nModel 2 controlling for\ndemographics+health\nbehaviors\nModel 3 controlling for\ndemographics+social\nsupport+stress\nModel 4 controlling for\ndemographics+health\nbehaviors+social support+stress\naCells represent unstandardized regression coefficients (s.e.).\nb`No religious preference' is the reference category for denomination.\n \nKH Kim et al\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nexamining religion's relation with BMI. Compared to the\nmodel controlling for demographics and health behaviors\nfor men, including both health behaviors and psychosocial\nvariables did not significantly change the unstandardized\nregression coefficients, although adding the psychosocial\nvariables slightly attenuated health behaviors' mediating\neffects and made religious identity's relationship with BMI\nnot significant (Model 4 of Table 2). The denomination of\nConservative Protestant remained significantly related to\nBMI in these models for men. The mean BMI of Jewish men\ncompared to men of no religious preference was high,\nalthough not significantly different.\nTo examine whether religion's relationship with higher\nBMI among men was associated with overweight or obesity,\nlogistic regressions using PROC LOGIT were conducted, with\noverweight vs others and obesity vs others as the outcomes.\nNo significant relationships were present for any of the\nmodels for overweight and obesity, suggesting that religion\nvariable relationships exist for average weight for the whole\npopulation, not just making some people more extreme in\nbody weight. Similarly, there were no significant associations\nbetween religion variables and overweight or obesity for\nwomen.\nSocial selection vs social causation analysis\nTo address the direction of causality in the religion\u00adbody\nweight relation, bivariate and multivariate logistic analyses\nwere conducted with the height\u00adweight discrimination\nvariable as the dependent variable and the religion items as\nthe independent variables. The multivariate analysis con-\ntrolled for age, income, race, education, marital status,\nregion, and city size. The religion variables were each entered\nseparately in the logistic analysis and all analyses were\nconducted separately by gender. If body weight caused\nreligion, that is, if religion draws in those who are heavier\nrather than causes its adherents to become heavier, then\nsignificant differences would be expected to be present. For\nboth the bivariate and multivariate analyses, none of the\nreligion variables were significantly related to the height and\nweight discrimination question. This suggests that relations\nbetween religion and body weight are primarily religion\ninfluencing weight (social causation) rather than weight\ninfluencing religion (social selection).\nDiscussion\nIn this analysis, Conservative Protestant men were approxi-\nmately 5 lb heavier than those men indicating no religious\npreference after controlling for demographics, health beha-\nviors, social support, and stress. Assuming that those\nindicating a Conservative Protestant affiliation were more\nlikely to be members of a church than those indicating no\nreligious preference, these results are consistent with Lapane\net al's41 conclusions that church members are heavier than\nnonchurch members. The lack of statistical significance of\nthose indicating a Jewish denomination to body weight may\nhave been because of the small number of Jewish men in the\nsample. Further studies need to be conducted to clarify\nwhether Judaism is associated with body weight in men.\nMeasures of religion other than denomination were not\nassociated with body weights of men or women, once health\nbehaviors were controlled. Unlike Baecke et al40 and\nFerraro,42 no relationship was found between religious\nattendance and body weight, although those studies did\nnot control for health behaviors. In this analysis, other\nreligiosity measures associated with body weight in men\nwere reduced by controlling for health behaviors, particu-\nlarly smoking.\nThe magnifying effect of the psychosocial variables on the\nreligion\u00adbody weight connection suggests that social sup-\nTable 3 Regression of religion on BMIFwomena\nReligion variable Model 1 controlling for\ndemographics\nModel 2 controlling for\ndemographics+health\nbehaviors\nModel 3 controlling for\ndemographics+social\nsupport+stress\nModel 4 controlling for\ndemographics+health\nbehaviors+social support+stress\naCells represent unstandardized Regression Coefficients (s.e.).\nb`No Religious Preference' is the reference category for denomination.\n \nKH Kim et al\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nport and stress could operate as moderators.67 However, the\ninteractions between religion and social support, and\nreligion and stress were not significant, suggesting that the\npsychosocial variables were not moderators in the religion-\nbody weight relationship.67 Thus, it is not clear how social\nsupport and stress fitFif at allFinto religion's relationship\nwith body weight. Given that the psychosocial variables did\nnot substantially change religion's relationship to body\nweight, perhaps social support and stress are not important\nfactors in the religion\u00adbody weight connection.\nAlthough the magnitude of religion's relationship with\nbody weight is small, the significance of the relationship\noffers new insight into the etiology of body weight. Given\nthe cross-sectional nature of this study, the direction of\ncausality could not be clearly established. However, the\nanalysis of height\u00adweight discrimination and religiosity\nmeasures supports the hypothesis that religion causes\nincreased body weight in men.\nSeveral limitations existed in this study. The cross-\nsectional design limits conclusions about the direction of\ncausality.61 Only a longitudinal study could more defini-\ntively show that religion causes body weight, although the\nsocial selection vs social causation analysis addressed this\nconcern to some extent. Missing values and nonresponse\ncould have biased the results, although the imputation and\nweighting attempted to account for those factors. The lack of\na dietary intake measure leaves open the possibility that part\nof the unexplained variance attributed to religion could have\nbeen because of diet. The self-report nature of the measures\ncould have also missed unexplained variance not captured\nby the measures because they were not precise enough, that\nis, religion's relationship with body weight could have been\nbecause of residual bias from the demographic variables.\nHowever, the magnitude of the denomination coefficient in\nmen suggests that it is probably not because of residual bias.\nCultural differences may have also interacted with religion\nto result in different relations between religion and weight,\nalthough controlling for race reduces that possibility.\nReligious individuals could have been more or less truth-\nful68,69 and thus report different body weights than the less\nreligious. Given that the MIDUS data did not include\nveracity measures and the lack of literature examining the\nrelation between religion and truthfulness, it is unclear to\nwhat extent, if any, validity of self-reported religion and\nweight affected these results.\nFinding no relation between religion and BMI among\nwomen was surprising, especially given that women are\ngenerally more religious than men.15 However, most surpris-\ning was religion's positive association with higher BMI in\nmen. Given the abundance of literature showing religion's\npositive effect on health status, religion correlating with\nappears to be inconsistent, since being overweight is\nassociated with poorer health.1\u00ad3,7,8 Concurrent with our\nfindings that increased BMI in religious men did not affect\nobesity risk, the heavier body weight of the religious may not\nbe a strong risk factor for poor health. The risk of higher\nBMIs among religious men may also be countered by positive\nhealth behaviors, such decreased smoking and drinking,\nthrough religion serving as a social control for better\nHow religion is related to greater BMI in men, however,\nremains unclear. Perhaps religion, through offering mean-\ning, acts as a stabilizing institution to protect against\nextreme underweight and overweight. Future research\nexamining religious meaning as an independent and\nmediating variable in the religion\u00adbody weight connection\nmay more completely delineate how religion is associated\nwith higher BMI in men.\n"
