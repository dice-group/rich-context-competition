Not all of them are explicit about the definition of risk. However, those\ninstitutions giving a precise definition as e.g= the International Monetary Fund or\nthe Bank of England state that an upward risk implies that the expected value\nof the forecasted variable lies above the value published as the central projection.\nAccordingly, a downward risk implies that the expected value of the forecasted\nvariable lies below the value published as the central projection. The value pub-\nlished as the central projection by these institutions is the most likely single value,\nalso called the mode forecast. The mean forecast, i.e. the expected value of the\nforecasted variable, thus results from the mode forecast and the forecasted risk.\nAlthough many institutions publish risk forecasts, to the best of our knowledge\nthe performance of these forecasts has not been studied yet. In this work, we try\nto close this gap by investigating the Bank of England's risk forecasts for inflation.\nOur findings indicate that these forecasts do not perform well.\nIf the risk forecasts are optimal they should improve the central projections. More-\nover, they should not improve the mean forecasts. We find that the Bank of Eng-\nland's risk forecasts do not possess these properties. Apparently, it is possible to\nimprove the mean forecasts by considering information contained in the risk fore-\ncasts, and it is not possible to improve the central projections by considering the\nrisk forecasts. In the sample under study, for several forecast horizons it is even\npossible to improve the central projections by considering the opposite of the risk\nforecast. This finding is related to the fact that often forecasted upward risks are\nfollowed by the realization of downward risks or forecasted downward risks by the\nrealization of upward risks.\nA major reason for the poor performance of the risk forecasts is probably given\nby the di!culties to identify and to quantify risks in the determinants of future\ninflation, as e.g. oil prices and exchange rates.\nOur results imply that the Bank of England's central projection for inflation,\nthe mode forecast, is closer to expected inflation than the forecast for expected\ninflation, the mean forecast.\nNicht-technische Zusammenfassung\nViele Institutionen, die makro\u00f6konomische Prognosen erstellen, versehen ihre Prog-\nnosen mit Risikoeinsch\u00e4tzungen. Nicht alle geben explizit an, wie diese Risiken\ndefiniert sind. Aber jene Institutionen, die eine pr\u00e4zise Definition anf\u00fchren, wie\nzum Beispiel der Internationale W\u00e4hrungsfonds und die Bank of England, erk-\nl\u00e4ren, dass das Vorliegen eines Aufw\u00e4rtsrisikos bedeutet, dass der erwartete Wert\nder prognostizierten Variable \u00fcber jenem Wert liegt, der als Basislinie prognos-\ntiziert wird. Entsprechend liegt ein Abw\u00e4rtsrisiko vor, wenn der erwartete Wert\nder prognostizierten Variablen unter jenem Wert liegt, der als Basislinie prognos-\ntiziert wird. Der von diesen Institutionen als Basislinie ver\u00f6entlichte Wert ist der\nwahrscheinlichste Wert und wird auch als Modusprognose bezeichnet. Die Mittel-\nwertprognose, also der erwartete Wert der prognostizierten Variablen, ergibt sich\nsomit aus der Modusprognose und dem prognostizierten Risiko.\nObwohl viele Institutionen Risikoprognosen ver\u00f6entlichen, ist die G\u00fcte dieser\nPrognosen nach unserem Wissen noch nicht untersucht werden. In dieser Arbeit\nversuchen wir, diese L\u00fccke zu schlie\u00dfen, indem wir die Risikoprognosen f\u00fcr Inflation\nder Bank of England auswerten. Unsere Ergebnisse deuten darauf hin, dass diese\nPrognosen keine guten Ergebnisse liefern.\nWenn die Risikoprognosen optimal sind, so sollten sie die Basislinie verbessern\nk\u00f6nnen. Andererseits sollten sie nicht in der Lage sein, die Mittelwertprognosen\nzu verbessern. Es stellt sich jedoch heraus, dass die Risikoprognosen f\u00fcr Inflation\nder Bank of England nicht diese genannten Eigenschaften besitzen. Es ist oenbar\nm\u00f6glich die Mittelwertprognosen zu verbessern, indem man in den Risikoprog-\nnosen enthaltene Informationen ber\u00fccksichtigt. Au\u00dferdem ist es nicht m\u00f6glich,\ndie Basislinie zu verbessern, in dem man die Risikoprognosen ber\u00fccksichtigt. In\nder untersuchten Stichprobe kann bei einigen Prognosehorizonten sogar die Ba-\nsislinie verbessert werden, indem man entgegengesetzte Risikoprognosen ber\u00fcck-\nsichtigt. Diese Beobachtung h\u00e4ngt damit zusammen, dass h\u00e4ufig auf prognos-\ntizierte Aufw\u00e4rtsrisiken die Realisation von Abw\u00e4rtsrisiken oder auf prognostizierte\nAbw\u00e4rtsrisiken die Realisation von Aufw\u00e4rtsrisiken folgte.\nEin Hauptgrund f\u00fcr die schlechten Ergebnisse der Risikoprognosen d\u00fcrfte sein,\ndass es sehr schwierig ist, Risiken f\u00fcr die Bestimmungsfaktoren der Inflation, wie\nzum Beispiel \u00d6lpreise und Wechselkurse, zu identifizieren und zu quantifizieren.\nAus unseren Ergebnissen l\u00e4sst sich schlie\u00dfen, dass die Basislinie der Bank of Eng-\nland, die Modusprognose, der erwarteten Inflation n\u00e4herkommt als die Prognose\nder erwarteten Inflation, die Mittelwertprognose.\nContents\n3 Forecast Optimality 5\n3.1 Mean Forecast Optimality and Risk . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5\n3.2 Bias of Mode, Mean and Risk Forecasts . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8\n3.3 Risk Forecast Optimality . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 9\n3.4 Interpretation of the Test Results . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 14\n4.1 Risk Forecast Optimality - A Qualitative Analysis . . . . . . . . . . 16\n4.2 Stability Over Time . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 19\n5 Possible Explanations for Poor Risk Forecasting Performance 22\n5.1 Endogeneity of Outturns . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 22\n5.2 Problems to Anticipate Risks in Determinants . . . . . . . . . . . . 24\nA Appendix: Mode and Mean Forecasts and Realizations 29\nHow Informative Are Macroeconomic Risk\nForecasts?\nAn Examination of the Bank of England's\nInflation Forecasts1\n1 Introduction\nMany institutions providing macroeconomic forecasts add risk assessments to these\nforecasts. For example, the International Monetary Fund states in its World Eco-\nnomic Outlook from October 2007 that, considering the global GDP growth fore-\ncast, \"the risks to the baseline forecast are distinctly to the downside. [...] The\nmain sources of the increase in the downside risk since the July 2007 update come\nfrom deteriorating financial conditions and from the uncertain prospects for do-\nmestic demand in the United States and Europe\" (p= 8). In its Inflation Report\nfrom February 2007, the Bank of England remarks that \"The risks to inflation are\nweighted to the downside in the near term and to the upside in the medium term.\"\n(pp= 45-46). Similar statements can be found in the publications of several other\ninstitutions, among them, for example, the European Central Bank, the Banco de\nPortugal and the Deutsche Bundesbank.2 Thus, announcing forecast risks appears\nto play an important role in the communication of forecast results.\n1Authors: Malte Kn\u00fcppel and Guido Schultefrankenfeld, Deutsche Bundesbank, Research\nCentre, Wilhelm-Epstein-Stra\u00dfe 14, D-60431 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.

We would\nlike to thank J\u00f6rg Breitung, Heinz Herrmann and Karl-Heinz T\u00f6dter as well as seminar partic-\nipants at the Bank of England and the Deutsche Bundesbank for very helpful comments and\ndiscussions.\n2For instance, the European Central Bank in its Monthly Bulletin from December 2007 de-\nclares that with respect to the inflation forecast, \"Risks to this outlook are fully confirmed to lie\non the upside. These risks include the possibility of further rises in oil and agricultural prices,\nas well as of unanticipated increases in administered prices and indirect taxes\" (p= 55). The\nThe presence of forecast risks is caused by asymmetries of the respective fore-\ncast densities. Some institutions, for instance, speak of an upward risk to the\nforecast if the forecasted mean exceeds the forecasted mode of their density fore-\ncasts. Assessing the asymmetry of a forecast density, i.e= forecasting a phenomenon\nrelated to third moments is surely an extremely challenging task.\nThis might be illustrated by the fact that many institutions calculate forecast\nuncertainty, i.e= a phenomenon related to second moments and therefore in general\neasier to assess, based on past forecast errors. This is done due to the lack of\nmodels which can accomplish this task, as explained by Wallis (1989). However,\nif it is so di!cult to forecast the uncertainty surrounding an institution's forecast\nappropriately, it is questionable whether risks can be forecasted in a reasonable\nmanner. Given that so many institutions face the challenge of risk forecasting\ndespite the di!culties to be encountered, it is important and interesting to find\nout how successful these risk forecasts are.\nOf all the institutions mentioned, the Bank of England (henceforth BoE) fea-\ntures the largest published risk forecasting record. Moreover, in contrast to most\nother institutions, the BoE produces quarterly, and not only annual risk forecasts.\nFinally, it does not only publish qualitative, but also quantitative risk assessments.\nActually, the BoE publishes density forecasts, from which point forecasts, uncer-\ntainty forecasts and risk forecasts can be derived. Therefore, our analysis focuses\non the BoE's forecasts.\nSince the BoE's record of macroeconomic density forecasts is relatively large,\nits forecasts are a highly favoured object of investigation in economics. The BoE's\nElder et al. (2005). Most studies are concerned with the accurateness of the point\nand uncertainty forecasts, but also the appropriateness of the entire forecast den-\nsity is evaluated. Up to now, however, apparently no study has focused on the\nrisk forecasts. So far, these forecasts have at best been evaluated in the context\nBanco de Portugal claims that \"As regards the projection for the inflation rate, risks appear\nto be broadly balanced in 2007 and slightly biased downwards in 2008, due to the risk of ap-\npreciation of the euro exchange rate\" (p= 31) in its Economic Bulletin from summer 2007. The\nDeutsche Bundesbank in its Monthly Bulletin from December 2007 remarks that \"[...] The price-\ndampening impact of the appreciation of the euro so far might also be stronger than expected\nand the euro could continue to appreciate. Taking everything together, however, the upside risks\nto future price developments predominate at the end of the forecasting horizon\" (p= 29).\nof investigations of the entire forecast density. For instance, Wallis (2003) states\nthat \"the excessive concern with upside risk was not justified over the period con-\nsidered.\" (p= 165). Yet, it remains to be analyzed how informative the BoE's risk\nforecasts are in general. In this work, we attempt to assess the information content\nof the BoE's risk forecasts for inflation.\nThis assessment is performed in the context of tests for forecast optimality.\nThe risk forecasts are supposed not to contain information which can reduce the\nmean squared forecast error of the mean forecasts. However, for reasons that will\nbecome clear below, the risk forecasts are supposed to reduce the mean squared\nforecast error of the mode forecasts. Both hypotheses will be investigated in this\nstudy.\nWe briefly present the concepts underlying the BoE's risk forecasts and the\ndata in Section 2. In Section 3, the optimality of risk forecasts is investigated.\nRobustness checks are carried out in Section 4. Section 5 deals with possible\nexplanations for the BoE's risk forecasting performance. Section 6 concludes.\n2 The Data\nSince February 1996, the BoE publishes its inflation forecast in the form of a\nprobability distribution, the \"fan chart\". The BoE also publishes the location pa-\nrameters mean, mode and median, as well as measures of dispersion and skewness.\nThe mode forecast is considered the central projection of the BoE, whereas the\nmean forecast is mainly used to convey information about the prevailing forecast\nrisk. Actually, during the entire subsequent analysis, it will be of no importance\nthat the central projection is a mode forecast. It will only be important that the\ncentral projection is not the mean forecast.\nMacroeconomic forecasts are typically based on certain assumptions concerning\nthe future developments of variables which are considered exogenous with respect\nto the forecasting models used. Exchange rates, oil prices and foreign demand for\ndomestic goods are typical examples for such variables in the context of macro-\neconometric models. According to Britton et al. (1998), the BoE's mode forecast\nof inflation corresponds to the forecast obtained if the assumptions are based on\nthe most likely future values of these variables. In contrast to that, the mean fore-\ncast is based on the expected future values. If the density forecasts are symmetric,\nmost likely and expected future values coincide. If, however, the density forecasts\nare asymmetric, most likely and expected future values dier. In the latter case,\nin general the mean and mode forecasts of inflation dier as well.\nIf the mean forecast exceeds the mode forecast, one speaks of an upward risk\nto the inflation forecast. A downward risk is present if the mean forecast is lower\nthan the mode forecast. Thus, risks are present if the BoE's density forecast is\nasymmetric. For further details, see Britton et al. (1998). In Figure 1, two of the\nBoE's density forecasts with risks are displayed. For their calculations, we make\nuse of the formulas given in Wallis (2004).\nOur analysis uses the BoE's inflation forecasts based on the assumption that\nthe o!cial Bank rate, i.e= the interest rate paid on commercial bank reserves follows\na path implied by market interest rates. In line with Elder et al. (2005), for the\npurpose of forecast evaluations we consider this assumption more adequate than\nthe assumption of a constant o!cial Bank rate.\nThe inflation forecasts considered in our analysis range from the first quarter of\n1998 to the third quarter of 2007. Each of the BoE's quarterly projections covers\nthe current and the subsequent 8 quarters. The data is displayed in Appendix A.\nNote that in some quarters, mean and mode forecast coincide, so that the forecast\nrisk equals zero, i.e= there is no forecast risk or the forecast risks are balanced.\nUntil 2003, the BoE forecasted the inflation of the all items retail prices index\nexcluding mortgage interest payments (henceforth RPIX). Since 2004, it forecasts\nthe inflation of the consumer price index (henceforth CPI).3\nThe BoE also publishes risk forecasts for GDP. We do not study these forecasts\nhere, since the analysis of GDP risk forecasts would be more complicated due to the\neects of data revisions. Such revisions play a substantial role for the assessment\nof the BoE's GDP forecasts, as noted by Elder et al. (2005).\n3When outturns are compared with forecasts, this change has of course to be taken into\naccount. For instance, an inflation forecast for the fourth quarter of 2004 has to be compared\nwith CPI inflation data if the forecast was made in 2004. If the forecast was made before 2004,\nit must be compared with RPIX inflation data.\nmean\nmode\nmode\nmean\nFigure 1: Two of the BoE's density forecasts for inflation. The forecast in the\nleft panel implies an upward risk (mean A mode), the one in the right panel a\ndownward risk (mean ? mode).\n3 Forecast Optimality\nIn this section, we are concerned with the partial optimality of forecasts, where\npartial optimality is defined as in Diebold & Lopez (1996). As mentioned by\nDiebold & Lopez (1996), the original concept of partial optimality refers to opti-\nmality conditional on the information set being used by the forecaster and goes\nback to Brown & Maital (1981). When we speak of optimality in this study, we\nalways mean partial optimality with respect to the information set that is given\nby the independent variable(s) of a certain regression. Our tests for optimality\nassume a loss function being quadratic in the forecast error.\n3.1 Mean Forecast Optimality and Risk\nIt is well known that using the mean of a density forecast as the point forecast\nminimizes the mean squared forecast error. In contrast to that, the loss function\nwhich is minimized by the mode forecast is a rather special all-or-nothing loss\nfunction as shown by Wallis (1999). Thus, the mean forecasts of the BoE should\nTable 1: Root mean squared errors of mode and mean forecasts\nRMSE of the forecasted...\nNote: k is the forecast horizon. q denotes the number of observations. dev. in %\ngives the deviation of the RMSE of the mode forecast from the RMSE of the mean\nforecast in %.\nhave a smaller mean squared forecast error than the mode forecasts.\nThe results for the root mean squared forecast error (RMSE) of the BoE's\ninflation forecasts displayed in Table 1, however, indicate the opposite. For 8 out\nof 9 forecast horizons, the mode forecasts yield a smaller RMSE than the mean\nforecasts.\nThis result is surprising. However, the observed negative deviations could be\nstatistically insignificant. Tests of the hypothesis that the RMSEs of mode and\nmean forecasts dier would have to take into account that these forecasts are most\nlikely generated by nested models. This implies that we cannot use the standard\ncritical values of the test statistic proposed by Diebold & Mariano (1995), but\nhave to make modifications as described in West (2006). Yet, it could even be\nthat mode and mean forecasts come from identical models, and it is unclear how\nto handle this issue. Therefore, instead of testing the dierence between RMSEs,\nwe employ a test for forecast optimality.\nIf the forecasts are optimal, we should not be able to reject the hypothesis\nKd\n: (k\n= 0) in the regression\n|w+k\n= k\n+ k\nw>w+k\n+ k\n\u00a1\nw>w+k\n pw>w+k\n\u00a2\n+ %w>k\nwhere |w+k\ndenotes the inflation rate in period w + k, w>w+k\ndenotes the mean\nforecast made in w for w + k, pw>w+k\nis the corresponding mode forecast, %w>k\nis a\nzero-mean error term4 and k = 0> 1> = = = > 8 a positive integer denoting the forecast\nhorizon. For k = 0, the forecast is actually a nowcast for the current quarter.\nNote that w>w+k\n pw>w+k\nis a measure of the forecasted risk. Also take into\naccount that the mean and the mode forecast are based on the same information\nset. Thus, the forecasted risk should not be significant in this regression, since,\nconditional on the information set used, the forecasted mean w>w+k\nis supposed to\nminimize the variance of %w>k\n.\nIn order to isolate the eect of the inclusion of the risk forecast, we also test\nthe hypothesis k\n= 0 separately. Moreover, we test the hypothesis of optimality\nKe\nk\nk\n= 1) in the reduced regression |w+k\nk\nk\nw>w+k\nw>k\n.

Since the mode forecasts have lower RMSEs than the\n4In what follows, all error terms have the zero-mean property.\nmean forecasts, and the mode forecasts are contained in the forecasted risk, the\nforecasted risk can help to improve the mean forecast.5\nThe null of forecast optimality can be rejected at lower significance levels with\n(1) than with the reduced regression at least for k = 0> 1> 2. However, even with\nthe reduced regression the null can be rejected at a significance level of 1 % for\n3.2 Bias of Mode, Mean and Risk Forecasts\nIf tests reject the hypothesis of forecast optimality, this might be due to the pres-\nence of a bias in the forecasts. It is therefore interesting to test the hypothesis of\n\nk\n= 0 in the equation\n|w+k\n w>w+k\n= \nk\n+ %\nw>k\nwhere \nk\nis a constant and %\nw>k\nis an error term. For the sake of completeness, we\ndo the same for the mode forecasts, i.e= we test the hypothesis of p\nk\n= 0 in the\nequation\n|w+k\n pw>w+k\n= p\nk\n+ %p\nw>k\nwhere p\nk\nis a constant and %p\nw>k\nis an error term.\nFinally, it might be interesting to know whether the BoE is mainly concerned\nwith upward or downward risks to inflation. This question can be addressed by\ntesting u\nk\n= 0 in the equation\nw>w+k\n pw>w+k\n= u\nk\n+ %u\nw>k\nwhere u\nk\nis a constant, and the error term %u\nw>k\n, like %\nw>k\nand %p\nw>k\n, can be serially\ncorrelated.6\n5In principle, we could also test forecast optimality by directly using the forecasted mode\npw>w+k instead of the forecasted risk w>w+k\n pw>w+k in equation (1). Since, however, w>w+k\nand\npw>w+k are strongly correlated, this would result in multicollinearity.\n6The presence of serial correlation in %u\nw>k\nis caused by the serial corrrelation in the forecasted\nrisk w>w+k\n pw>w+k. This serial correlation can be explained as follows: If there is a risk to the\nforecast made in period w for the period w + k + 1, and this risk does not materialize until the\nforecast in w + 1 is made, the risk for the period w + k + 1 persists. Thus, w>w+k+1\n pw+1>w+1+k are correlated. Since in addition risks are typically correlated over\nhorizons, i.e= w>w+k+1\npw>w+k+1 is correlated with w>w+k\npw>w+k, the forecast risks for a certain\nThe results in Table 3 show that neither the mode forecasts nor the mean\nforecasts have a significant bias.7 The estimates for \nk\nand p\nk\nare very similar,\nboth implying that the BoE slightly underpredicted inflation for k = 0> = = = > 6 and\nslightly overpredicted inflation for k = 7> 8.\nThe estimates of u\nk\nindicate that on average the BoE predicts upward risks to\ninflation. The average risks increase with the forecast horizon k. However, these\naverage risks are very small, attaining at most 0=03 percentage points. Moreover,\nthe presence of a non-zero average risk is not significant. Thus, we cannot reject\nthe hypothesis that, on average, the BoE forecasts balanced risks, i.e= no risks.\nNote that the latter result does not imply any kind of optimality, but is purely\ndescriptive. If the true unconditional density of inflation was positively skewed,\nits mean would exceed its mode, and hence, upward risks should be forecasted on\naverage. For the same reason, the absence of bias in the mode forecasts cannot\nbe evaluated. Only for the mean forecast, unbiasedness is a property of optimal\nforecasts.\n3.3 Risk Forecast Optimality\nIn Section 3.1, we have tested the optimality of mean forecasts with respect to\nthe information contained in the risk forecasts. In case of optimality, the risk\nforecasts must not improve the mean forecasts. In the current section, our focus\nwill be somewhat dierent. We want to test the optimality of risk forecasts in a\nmore direct manner. In order to do so, we ask the question whether the central\nprojection, i.e= the mode forecast can be improved by taking the risk forecast into\naccount if agents have a quadratic loss function. If the risk forecasts have the\nintended information content, such an improvement should be observed.\nIn order to evaluate the risk forecasts, we need a measure of realized risks. The\nmeasure that corresponds to the risk forecasts of the BoE is given by the dierence\nbetween realized inflation and the mode forecast. If the risk forecasts are optimal,\nhorizon k are serially correlated as well. However, the serial correlation of %u\nw>k\nturns out to be\nless pronounced than the serial correlation of %\nw>k\nand %p\nw>k\n.\n7For the mean forecasts, this result is in line with, for instance, Clements (2004), Wallis (2004)\nTable 3: Results of regressions to test for bias\ncoe!cient estimates\n\nk\np\nk\nu\nk\ns-values\n\nk\np\nk\nu\nk\nNote: Standard errors are in parentheses. These are Newey-West (1987) standard errors.\nThe bandwidth parameter is chosen based on the procedure proposed by Andrews (1991).\nW,(WW,WWW) denotes rejection of the null hypothesis at the 10 (5, 1) % significance level. q\ndenotes the number of observations.\nwe have\n|w+k\n pw>w+k\n= w>w+k\n pw>w+k\n+ %w>k\nwhere %w>k\nis an error term. The term |w+k\npw>w+k\nis the forecast error with respect\nto the central projection, but in the context of the subsequent analysis it should\nbe regarded as measure for the realized risk, as w>w+k\n pw>w+k\nis the measure of\nthe forecasted risk.\nNote that we could rewrite equation (2) as |w+k\n= pw>w+k\n+\n\u00a1\nw>w+k\n pw>w+k\n\u00a2\n+\n%w>k\n. This equation states that in case of risk forecast optimality, the mode forecast\nmust be shifted towards the mean by the amount\n\u00a1\nw>w+k\n pw>w+k\n\u00a2\n. If the mode\nforecast was not shifted towards the mean by this amount, the resulting mean\nsquared forecast error would exceed the variance of %w>k\n.\nIt is also important to note that we do not regress the true risk on the forecasted\nrisk. The true risk is given by H [\\w+k\n]  P [\\w+k\n], where P [\\w+k\n] denotes the\nmode of \\w+k.8 Since we do not have an estimate for P [\\w+k\n], we cannot measure\n8We adopt the common convention to use uppercase letters for random variables and lowercase\nletters for their realizations.\nthe true risk. It should be stressed that nothing in equation (2) relates the true\nmode P [\\w+k\n] to the forecasted mode pw>w+k\n. This becomes especially clear if we\nsuppose, for instance, that an institution simply publishes a constant f as its central\nprojection. In this case, equation (2) would become |w+k\n f = w>w+k\n f + %w>k\n.\nThe forecasted risk would be given by w>w+k\n f, and the realized risk by |w+k\n f.\nFor the mentioned equation, it does not matter whether f is supposed to be the\nmode, median or any other point related to the distribution of \\w+k\n. For optimal\nrisk forecasts, it only matters that the forecasted risk w>w+k\nf equals the expected\nrealized risk Hw\n[\\w+k\n f].\nBased on equation (2), it is possible to run Mincer-Zarnowitz regressions for\nthe risk forecasts. That is, one can estimate the coe!cients k\nand k\nof the\nequation\n|w+k\n pw>w+k\n= k\n+ k\n\u00a1\nw>w+k\n pw>w+k\n\u00a2\n+ %w>k\nand test whether k\n= 1 hold. However, we will not consider the\njoint hypothesis (k\n= 1), but test the hypothesis of the first (k\nof the second condition for optimality (k\n= 1) separately. This will turn out to\ndeliver more insights than a joint test.\nMoreover, we will test the hypothesis of qualitatively correct information con-\ntent of the risk forecasts. This test is based on the assumption that k\nand involves tests of two hypotheses. The first hypothesis is given by k\nthe risk forecasts have an information content, this hypothesis should be rejected.\nThe second hypothesis is given by k\nA 0. If the risk forecasts have a qualitatively\ncorrect information content, this hypothesis should not be rejected.\nWith tests of two hypotheses, four cases can occur. In Table 4, we list these\ncases and their implications. They are ranked according to their desirability. Case\nI is clearly the most desirable case. Case II is less desirable, but not being able to\nreject k\n= 0 could not only be caused by lack of information content, but also, for\nexample, by a too small sample size. Cases III and IV are the least desirable ones.\nIn principle, they have identical implications, but in case III, the confirmation of\nthe alternative hypothesis of a qualitatively adverse information content is weaker,\nsince it occurs at a larger significance level.9\n9Note that in case I, if at a given significance level k\n= 0 is rejected and k\nA 0 is not,\nTable 4: Implications of test results for information content\ncase k\nA 0 implication for risk forecasts\nI rejected not rejected qualitatively correct information content confirmed\nII not rejected not rejected null of no information content not rejected\nIII not rejected rejected qualitatively adverse information content confirmed\nIV rejected rejected qualitatively adverse information content confirmed\nThe estimation results are displayed in the upper panel of Table 5. While the\nk\n'v are all close to zero, the k\n'v are mostly negative. This indicates that, for a\nperiod with a forecasted upward risk, a downward risk is more likely to materialize.\nThe lower panel of Table 5 contains the s-values of tests of the various null\nhypotheses. Here and in the following, we use a significance level of 10 %. It turns\nout that the null of k\n= 0 cannot be rejected for any forecast horizon k. However,\nthe null of k\n= 1, i.e= of the second condition for optimality is rejected for all\nhorizons except for k = 4> 5> 6 at very low significance levels. For k = 4> 5> 6, the\nlargest standard errors of k\nare found, so that inference is relatively di!cult for\nthese horizons.\nSince k\n= 0 cannot be rejected, tests of the null hypothesis of qualitatively\ncorrect information content can be conducted. They yield rather disappointing\nresults. Not for a single forecast horizon case I is found, i.e= for no forecast horizon\nthe presence of qualitatively correct information content is confirmed. For the\nhorizons k = 0> 4> 5> 6> 8 we cannot reject the null of no information content. For\nthe other horizons, we even find a qualitatively adverse information content of the\nrisk forecasts.\nIn summary, the risk forecasts appear to fulfill the first condition for optimal-\nity, but the intended information content, i.e= a qualitatively correct information\ncontent is not present in these forecasts. Rather they have either no information\ncontent, or even a qualitatively adverse information content.\nIn principle, the puzzling results with respect to the tests of the k\n'v could be\nrelated to the presence of a constant, albeit insignificant, in equation (3). Imagine\nthis implies that k\n? 0 is rejected. Therefore, in case I we cannot only state that the null of\nqualitatively correct information content cannot be rejected. We can even claim that, since the\nnull of qualitatively adverse information content can be rejected, the alternative hypothesis of\nqualitatively correct information content is confirmed.\nTable 5: Results of Mincer-Zarnowitz regressions\ncoe!cient estimates\nk\nk\ns-values\nk\nk\nk\nk\nNote: Standard errors are in parentheses.

In this case, a forecasted upward risk would mostly be\ncorrectly associated with the realization of an upward risk. However, a regression\naccording to equation (3) would yield k\n(and\nalso k\n) would not dier significantly from zero. Yet, a regression with the restric-\ntion k\n= 0 would yield k\n= 0=17 which could be considered a more reasonable\nresult. Therefore, we also estimate equation (3) with the restriction k\nresults are displayed in the Table 6.\nIt turns out that the signs of the k\n'v are identical to those in the unrestricted\nestimation. The null of k\n= 1 is rejected for the same horizons as before. Again\ncase I does not occur for any horizon, so there is no evidence for a qualitatively cor-\nrect information content. However, in contrast to the estimations with a constant,\nnow case II is found for all horizons except k = 2. For this horizon, there is evi-\ndence for qualitatively adverse information content. Yet, for several other horizons\nthe s-values of the tests of k\nA 0 exceed 10 % by a small amount only, thereby\nagain suggesting the possibility of a qualitatively adverse information content.\nTable 6: Results of Mincer-Zarnowitz regressions with restriction k\ncoe!cient estimates\nk\ns-values\nk\nk\nk\nNote: Standard errors are in parentheses.

It is also\nhighly probable that they lack qualitatively correct information content. Rather,\nthey appear to have either no information content or even an adverse information\ncontent. The evidence for the latter phenomenon is not particularly strong, but\ndue to the small sample size, we cannot discriminate more clearly between both\nalternatives.\n3.4 Interpretation of the Test Results\nIt is important to understand that the results found in the previous section are not\na consequence of the results found in Section 3.1. In that section, we found that\nthe mean forecasts can be improved by considering the forecasted risk, and that\nthe mode forecasts have lower RMSEs than the mean forecasts. These facts do not\nimply that the risk forecasts have no information content or an adverse informa-\ntion content, i.e= that the mode forecasts cannot be improved by considering the\nforecasted risk, or that the mode forecasts can only be improved by considering\nthe reversed forecasted risk.\nIn order to clarify this issue, consider the densities and the mean and mode\nforecasts displayed in Figure 2. The true densities are symmetric around zero, so\ncase A, t = 1\ncase A, t = 2\ncase B, t = 1\ncase B, t = 2\ncase C, t = 1\ncase C, t = 2\ncase D, t = 1\ncase D, t = 2\nFigure 2: Four cases of mean and mode forecasts for two periods.\nThe dotted lines are the true densities of \\1 and \\2. The solid lines indicate the mean\nforecasts w3k>w\n, the dashed lines indicate the mode forecasts pw3k>w.\nthat their mode and mean coincide at zero. We plot forecasts for two periods,\nw = 1 and w = 2 and distinguish between the four cases A, B, C and D.\nIn case A, the risk forecasts w3k>w\nhave the right sign and the correct\nsize. With respect to our analysis, in this case mean forecasts and risk forecasts\nare optimal.10 In case B, the risk forecasts w3k>w\nhave the right sign,\nbut they are exaggerated. That is, for w = 1, upward risks are present and are\nforecasted, and for w = 2, downward risk are present and are forecasted, but both\nrisks are too large. In case C, the mode forecasts are actually equal to the mean\n10Of course, the mode forecast does not coincide with the true mode, but, as mentioned above,\nthis does not matter for our analyses.\nof the true density, so the risk forecasts cannot improve the mode forecasts. In\ncase D, the forecasted risks have the wrong signs. This could be interpreted as an\nexaggeration of risks already present in the mode forecast. For the mean forecasts,\nthese risks are then exaggerated even further, leading to wrong signs of the risk\nforecasts.\nIn all four cases, mean and mode forecasts are unbiased. The same holds for\nthe risk forecasts. In the three cases B, C and D, the mode forecasts have a\nsmaller RMSE than the mean forecasts, because the mode forecasts are closer to\nthe mean of the true density. Thus, for these three cases, we would obtain the\nresults found in Section 3.1. However, case B cannot be reconciled with the results\nof Section 3.3, since case B would correspond to case I in Table 4. Yet, case I is\nnever observed. In contrast to that, case C can be reconciled with case II, and\ncase D can be reconciled with cases III and IV.\nThus, the results found in Section 3.1 and Section 3.3 suggest that the mode\nforecasts are closer to the mean of the true densities than the mean forecasts.\nMoreover, the mode forecasts might be improved by shifting them away from the\nforecasted mean. The latter possibility suggests that the probability of certain\nrisks as e.g= exchange rate changes could already be overestimated in the mode\nforecast. In any case, for economic agents with a loss function being quadratic in\nthe forecast error, the BoE's mean forecasts do not minimize these losses.\n4 Robustness Checks\n4.1 Risk Forecast Optimality - A Qualitative Analysis\nIn order to shed further light on the performance of the BoE's risk forecasts, we\nconduct an analysis of their qualitative performance. If the lack of information\ncontent or the adverse information content found above is mainly driven by outliers,\ni.e= mainly driven by very few periods in which large upward [downward] risks\nwere forecasted, but large downward [upward] risks materialized, the qualitative\nperformance of the risk forecasts could be expected to be considerably better than\ntheir quantitative performance.\nTherefore, we regard all periods for which the BoE saw a forecast risk and\nTable 7: Qualitative performance of risk forecasts\ncompare the directions of these risks (downward or upward) with the outturns\n(below or above the mode forecast). If an upward [downward] risk was forecasted,\nand the outturn was above [below] the mode forecast, we count this as a successful\nrisk forecast. Otherwise, the risk forecast is counted as a failure. In Table 7, we\nshow the share of failures and of successes. Both shares add up to 1. We also\nreport the ratio of failures to successes.\nObviously, the qualitative risk forecasts do not perform well either. For all\nforecast horizons, the failure-success ratio exceeds 1, ranging from 1=2 for k = 8\nto 2=8 for k = 1. Considering all risk forecasts, the failure-success ratio attains\na value of 1=8. Thus, there is no evidence of correct information content of the\nqualitative risk forecasts. Rather, the results indicate the presence of an adverse\ninformation content.\nIn order to test hypotheses about information content, one could think of set-\nting up a (2 \u00d7 2) contingency table for each horizon, and then use a chi-square\nor a related test. The categories of the table would be forecasted upward and\ndownward risk, and materialized upward or downward risk, i.e= outturns above or\nbelow the mode forecast. However, the tests mentioned do not take the time-series\ncontext of the data into account. This issue is emphasized by Christoersen (1998)\nand Pesaran & Timmermann (2006). The inference would be distorted by serial\ncorrelation of the data.\nTo overcome this problem, Pesaran & Timmermann (2006) propose to trans-\nform the data to sequences of 1's and 0's, to run standard regressions and to use\nheteroscedasticity- and autocorrelation-consistent covariance estimators for infer-\nence. So we recode our data according to\n~\n|t\nw>w+k\n=\n;\nA\n?\nA\n=\n pw>w+k\n pw>w+k\nqd if |w+k\n pw>w+k\n> ~\n{t\nw>w+k\n=\n;\nA\n?\nA\n=\n1 if w>w+k\n pw>w+k\n0 if w>w+k\n pw>w+k\nqd if |w+k\n pw>w+k\nwhere qd denotes a missing value.\nIn order to construct variables |t\n>+k\nand {t\n>+k\nwithout missing values, we use\nthe transformations\nyt\nk\n= Ak\n~\nyt\nk\nxt\nk\n= Ak\n~\nxt\nk\nwhere the vector ~\nyt\nk\nis given by ~\nyt\nk\n=\n\u00a1\n~\n|t\n> ~\n|t\n> = = = > ~\n|t\nq>q+k\n, the vector ~\nxt\nk\nis\ngiven by ~\nxt\nk\n=\n\u00a1\n~\n{t\n> ~\n{t\n> = = = > ~\n{t\nq>q+k\nand Ak\nis a known (p \u00d7 q) selection\nmatrix consisting of 1's and 0's, and with p  q. Ak\nis chosen such that the\nvectors yt\nk\n=\n\u00a1\n|t\n> |t\n> = = = > |t\np>p+k\nand xt\nk\n=\n\u00a1\n{t\n> {t\n> = = = > {t\np>p+k\ndo\nnot contain missing values. If there were no missing values, Ak would be an (q \u00d7 q)\nidentity matrix. If, for example, there was no risk forecast for the first forecast of\nhorizon k, i.e= in the case |1+k\n= 0, p would equal q1 and Ak\nwould be\ngiven by the (p \u00d7 q) matrix Ak\nIp\n], where 0p\ndenotes an (p \u00d7 1) vector\nof 0's and Ip\ndenotes the (p \u00d7 p) identity matrix.\nHaving constructed the qualitative variables |t\n>+k\nand {t\n>+k\nwith  = 1> 2> = = = > p,\nwe run the regression\n|t\n>+k\n= k\n+ k\n{t\n>+k\n+ %>k\nwhere %>k\nis an error term. In this regression only the value of k\nis of interest.\nA value of 1 corresponds to a qualitatively optimal11 information content, a value\nof 0 to no information content, and a value below 0 to an adverse information\ncontent. We do not test the hypothesis k\n= 1, because due to the construction\nof |t\n>+k\nand {t\n>+k\n, |k\n|  1 holds. Hence, as emphasized by Harding & Pagan\n= 1 would mean testing on the boundary of the parameter\n11Qualitative optimality is achieved by the minimzation of a quadratic loss function, where\nthe argument of the loss function is a qualitative variable.\nTable 8: Results of regressions with qualitative variables\ncoe!cient estimates\nk\ns-values\nk\nk\nNote: Standard errors are in parentheses.

For all forecast horizons, the\nestimated k\n's are negative. For the horizons k = 0> 2> 4> 5> 8 we cannot reject the\nnull of no information content. For the other horizons, the presence of qualitatively\nadverse information content is confirmed.12\nTo sum up, the qualitative analysis confirms the results of the quantitative\nanalysis. There are no signs of qualitatively correct information content of the risk\nforecasts, and there might even exist a qualitatively adverse information content.\n4.2 Stability Over Time\nThe BoE publishes density forecasts since February 1996. At that time, to the\nbest of our knowledge the BoE was the only institution to publish macroeconomic\nprojections of this kind, so that the BoE could not draw on others institutions'\nexperiences. It is therefore quite likely that the BoE has gone through a learning\nprocess. If this process was still ongoing in February 1998 and later, the results\n12Of course, the deletion of certain observations in the process of constructing |t\n>+k\nand\n{t\n>+k\ncan be expected to cause breaks in the autocorrelation structure of these variables. The\ncalculation of standard errors might suer from this problem. Therefore, we vary the bandwith\nparameters of the Newey-West procedure between 0 and 6, finding that the standard errors\nremain broadly unchanged.\nof our analysis might be aected by it. In this case, it would be more appropriate\nto start the analysis at that point in time where the learning process came to an\nend.\nLooking at the forecasts, there indeed appear to be signs of a learning process.\nUntil May 2001, in every projection risks were forecasted for at least 8 out of 9\nhad at most 4 out of 9 horizons for which risks were forecasted. In these 19\nprojections, risks were forecasted for k = 5> = = = > 8, i.e= the longer term, but not for\nk = 0> = = = > 4, i.e= the shorter term. Thus, the BoE seems to have become more\ncautious with respect to its risk forecasts, especially in the shorter term. Yet, it is\nnot completely clear if August 2001 should be considered as the breakpoint.\nUntil May 2001, the share of forecasts with risks was 94 %. For forecasts from\nAugust 2001 onwards, this share equals only 40 %. The dierence between these\nthe breakpoint, this dierence would reach its largest possible value of 58 %.13 We\ntherefore assume that the switch to a more cautious risk forecasting regime might\ntranslate into changes of the risk forecasting performance.\nIt would therefore be interesting to split the data sample in August 2001 and\nMay 2002 and to investigate whether the information content of the risk forecasts\ndiers among the two subsamples. Unfortunately, for many horizons there are\nonly very few risk forecasts diering from zero after these breakpoints, the lowest\nnumber being three if May 2002 is considered as the breakpoint. An analysis based\non individual forecast horizons would thus not deliver many useful insights. Hence,\nwe decide to pool all forecast horizons and to perform a panel analysis.\nIn the static panel model, we consider the forecast publication dates as the time\nvariable and the forecast horizon as the group variable. Thus, the panel model\nemerging from equation (3) is given by\n|w+k\n pw>w+k\n=  + (w>w+k\n pw>w+k\n) + xw>k\n13Until February 2002, the share of forecasts with risks was 92 %. For forecasts from May\nwhere xw>k\ndenotes the error component. This random eects specification is sup-\nported by a Hausman test. Strictly speaking, we set k\n=  + k\n, where k\nis the\nspecific disturbance. With assuming a remainder disturbance %w>k\n, we define the\nerror component as xw>k\n= k\n+ %w>k\n. The intercept  is treated as the mean of\nthe random eects. We estimate model (5) by Generalized Least Squares (hence-\nforth GLS), assuming heteroskedasticity and imposing a panel-specific first-order\nautoregressive (henceforth AR(1)) process for the error term. Furthermore, cross-\nsectional correlation is explicitly taken into account. The latter option, however,\nrequires the panel to be strictly balanced. Therefore, observations after August\nthe unbalanced panel. Yet, with a glance at the data we remark that only three\nforecasts with risks are excluded.\nGLS estimations are performed on the complete balanced panel data and on\nfour subsamples. The four subsamples are determined by the two possible break-\npoints. We set  to zero since it turns out not to dier significantly from this value\nin the full-sample estimation.14\nThe resulting estimates displayed in Table 9 show stark dierences depending\non the breakpoint date used. This is due to the fact that the risk forecasts pub-\nthe breakpoint to be August 2001, the risk forecasts have improved. While there\nwas an adverse information content before the breakpoint, the null of no informa-\ntion content cannot be rejected after the breakpoint.15 However, the risk forecasts\nstill do not have a qualitatively correct information content, with  being smaller\nthan zero. If May 2002 is considered as the breakpoint, the risk forecasts have\ndeteriorated. The second condition for optimality, i.e=  = 1 is rejected in all\nsamples.\nThus, there is no evidence that increased caution with respect to the risk\nforecasts has led to a qualitatively correct information content of these forecasts.\n15One could suppose that standard errors might be distorted by the use of a panel-specific\nAR(1)-process for the error term, since it would be more appropriate to employ moving-average\nprocesses with orders related to the respective forecast horizons. However, LM tests find evidence\nfor serial correlation of the residuals only for the forecast horizons k = 3> 4. In any case, no\nestimation routine being able to handle cross-sectional correlation and moving-average or higher-\norder AR(n)-processes is known to us.\nTable 9: Static panel estimation results\nfull sample old regime old regime new regime new regime\nuntil until since since\ncoe!cient estimates\ns-values\nNote: GLS estimation with AR(1)-process for error terms, and cross-sectional cor-\nrelation.

Consider, for example,\nthe case of forecasted upward risks to inflation. In this case, economic agents could\nanticipate a risk of rising interest rates. In response to this risk, economic activity\ncould be dampened, leading to lower demand and, consequently, to lower inflation.\nThen, even if the forecasted upward risk to inflation materializes, inflation could\nstill be lower than forecasted. In this case, the risk forecasts could even have\nan adverse information content. The same would happen if the BoE actually set\ninterest rates according to its risk forecasts.\nIf there is a transmission channel from forecasts to realizations, then the analy-\nsis conducted above could easily come to wrong conclusions. However, the pre-\nvailing opinion in economics is that inflation can only be influenced with a lag by\nmonetary policymakers. Actually, this is the reason why central banks are con-\ncerned with forecasting. They know that their current decisions will not aect the\neconomy instantaneously, but in the future.\nTaking this fact into account, it should be clear that, if a transmission chan-\nnel from forecasts to realizations exists, its importance should increase with the\nforecasting horizon. Therefore, we should be able to assess the importance of\nthis channel by regressing the k\n's of our regressions on the respective k's. If\nthe transmission channel is important, the coe!cient with respect to k should be\nnegative, because for short horizons, the k\n's should correctly measure the infor-\nmation content of the risk forecasts and should therefore be relatively large. For\nlarger horizons, the transmission channel would become more important, lowering\nthe values of the k\nTherefore, we estimate the equation\nk\n= d + ek + %k\nwhere %k\nis an error term. We estimate this equation for the k\n's of the standard\nMincer-Zarnowitz regression (3), of the Mincer-Zarnowitz regression with k\nand of the equation with qualitative variables (4). The results of these regressions\nare displayed in Table 10.\nNone of the e's is negative, indicating that the transmission channel from fore-\ncasts to realizations does not play a major role. In any case, the negative signs\nof the k\n's for short forecasting horizons could not have been explained by this\n16Of course, there could also be another reason why the k\n's decline with the forecasting\nhorizon. The di!culty of forecasting for longer horizons tends to lower the k\n's for longer\nhorizons in standard Mincer-Zarnowitz regressions. However, if the k\n's do not decrease as k\nincreases, this can be interpreted as unimportance of the transmission channel even if there is\nanother reason why the k\n's should decrease.\nTable 10: Results of regression of slope coe!cients on forecast horizon\nk\n's from e\nNote: Standard errors are in parentheses.\nchannel.\nAs endogeneity of outturns is the only explanation we could have oered for\na possibly adverse information content of risk forecasts, the evidence for adverse\ninformation content found above remains puzzling.\n5.2 Problems to Anticipate Risks in Determinants\nRisks to inflation or other aggregates are commonly identified via risks to variables\nthat determine these aggregates. For example, an upward risk to inflation might\nbe caused by an upward risk to oil prices, to the value added tax rate or by a risk\nof depreciation of the domestic currency. Thus, in order to correctly forecast the\nrisks to inflation, one has to forecast the risks to these determinants. Actually, the\nprocess of risk forecasting might be thought of as a three-step process, where in\nthe first step, one has to identify those determinants which are subject to forecast\nrisks. In the second step, one has to quantify these risks, and in the third step,\ntheir impact on the aggregate has to be calculated.\nWhile for the third step, models are in general available, the first two steps\nappear especially demanding. The first step requires to identify variables whose\nmost likely future paths (represented by the mode forecast) dier from their ex-\npected future paths (represented by the mean forecast). This might be possible\nfor fiscal variables like the value added tax rate, where one could imagine that a\ncertain rate is likely, but that an alternative rate is discussed by the government\nat the time the forecast is made. For variables like oil prices and exchange rates,\nhowever, this task is extremely challenging. Even if the identification of risks is\nsuccessful, the quantification appears equally di!cult. But if the identified risks to\nthe determinants are opposing risks to the aggregate, an incorrect quantification\ncan easily lead to a qualitatively flawed risk forecast for the aggregate.\nWithout further knowledge about the assumptions made about risks of determi-\nnants in the BoE's forecasts, we cannot verify whether the di!culties in identifying\nand quantifying these risks are decisive for the performance of the risk forecasts\nfor inflation. However, the BoE gives narrative support to this supposition. In the\nInflation Report from August 2000 the BoE, referring to inflationary developments\nfrom 1997 to 1999, states that \"In general, the modal inflation forecast has been\ncloser to actual outturns than the mean projection. This is because the MPC\njudged the risks to the central projection to be on the upside, largely because of\nthe risk that the sterling exchange rate might depreciate sharply. Up to 2000 Q2\nthis did not occur; indeed, the exchange rate tended to be higher than the central\nAlthough we cannot quantify the eect of errors in assumptions about risks in\ndeterminants, the reasoning given above and the cited statement by the BoE lead\nus to consider this eect as the major reason for the BoE's poor risk forecasting\nperformance. If this is the major reason, then the appearance of an adverse infor-\nmation content for some of the forecast horizons would be related to the sample\nsize of the analysis. With a larger sample size, one would then expect stronger\nevidence for the hypothesis of no information content of the risk forecasts.\n6 Conclusion\nMacroeconomic risk assessments play an important role in the forecasts of many\ninstitutions. However, to the best of our knowledge their performance has not\nbeen investigated yet. In this work, we study the BoE's risk forecasts for inflation.\nWe find that these forecasts do not contain the intended information. Rather, they\neither have no information content, or maybe even an adverse information content.\nThe poor performance of the risk forecasts is related to the fact that the mode\nforecasts have smaller RMSEs than the mean forecasts. Our results imply that\neconomic agents with a loss function being quadratic in the forecast error should\nnot use the mean forecasts. Instead, in order to attain the smallest expected loss,\nthey should either use the mode forecasts and ignore the risk forecast. Or they\neven should, starting from the mode forecast, move into the opposite direction of\nthe risk forecast. In any case, they can expect a lower loss when they use the\nBoE's mode forecast instead of the mean forecast.\nWe find that the poor risk forecasting performance cannot be explained by out-\nliers. We also find that in 2001 or 2002, the BoE changed its risk forecast pattern,\nand has apparently acted with more caution since then. Risks have only been\nforecasted relatively rarely since this change. However, we find that the increase\nin caution does not translate into a qualitatively correct information content of\nthe risk forecasts.\nThe most convincing reason for the BoE's poor risk forecasting performance\nseems to be given by the di!culty to identify and quantify the forecast risks in the\ndeterminants of inflation. This, however, can only explain the lack of information\ncontent. We cannot oer conclusive explanations for a possibly adverse information\ncontent.\nIf our results are representative for macroeconomic risk forecasts, they call\ninto question the common practice of adding risk assessments to forecasts. The\nonly obvious rationale for publishing risk forecasts would then be the forecast\ninstitutions' desire for shaping the expectations of economic agents. However, this\ncan only work properly as long as economic agents believe that the risk forecasts\nhave the intended information content.\nYet, it might also be that risk forecasts are actually neither meant to deliver\ncorrect results nor to shape expectations, but rather aim to reach a \"consensus\"\namong those responsible for the forecast. By means of risk forecasts, it is possible\nto integrate disagreeing views on future developments into a single forecast. If a\nminority of an institution's forecasting committee does not agree with the view of\nthe majority, the view of the majority could be published as the central projection,\nwhile the view of the minority could be represented in the form of risk assessments.\nIn this case, our results imply that, for the sake of forecast optimality, it would be\nbetter to ignore the minority's view.\nReferences\nAndrews, D.
