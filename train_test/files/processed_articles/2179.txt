We examined 3 outcomes 4 to 7\nyears after randomization, among youth aged 5 to 16 years at\nbaseline (n = 2829): lifetime major depressive disorder (MDD),\npsychological distress (K6), and Behavior Problems Index (BPI).\nTreatment effect modification by gender and family's baseline report\nof recent violent crime victimization was tested via interactions in\ncovariate-adjusted intent-to-treat and instrumental variable adherence-\nadjusted regression models.\nRESULTS: Gender and crime victimization significantly modified treat-\nment effects on distress and BPI (P , .10). Female adolescents in\nfamilies without crime victimization benefited from MTO treatment,\nMDD B = \u00ad0.036, P = .03). Male adolescents in intervention families\nexperiencing crime victimization had worse distress (B = 0.24, P =\nicantly higher MDD (B = 0.022, P = .16) versus controls. Other sub-\ngroups experienced no effect of MTO treatment. Instrumental\nvariable estimates were similar but larger.\nCONCLUSIONS: Girls from families experiencing recent violent crime\nvictimization were significantly less likely to achieve mental health ben-\nefits, and boys were harmed, by MTO, suggesting need for cross-\nsectoral program supports to offset multiple stressors.

Five thousand three hundred\nfamilies were eligible and random-\nized8 (Fig 1). MTO was not registered in\nConsolidated Standards of Reporting\nTrials (CONSORT) because it was not\na medical intervention.\nTreatment Assignment\nSpecial software randomly assigned\nMTO families to 1 of 3 conditions. The\n\"regular Section 8\" treatment group\nwas offered Section 8 housing vouch-\ners to subsidize a private market rental\napartment in any neighborhood. The\n\"low-poverty-neighborhood\" treatment\ngroup was also offered Section 8 housing\nvouchers, but they were redeemable\nonly in low-poverty neighborhoods\n(where ,10% of Census Tract house-\nholds were impoverished). Families in\nthis group were offered housing coun-\nseling services to aid relocation. The\nthird group was an untreated control\ngroup, who received no additional as-\nsistance but could remain in public\nAssessment\nconducted in person via computer-\nassisted personal interviewing tech-\nnology with household heads and their\nchildren.8,25 Youth were interviewed in\nteen centers to improve privacy.24 We\nTier 1 Restricted Access Data; the ef-\nprovided informed written consent for\nNortheastern University's Institutional\nReview Board approved this study.\nMeasures\nPast-month nonspecific psychological\ndistress was measured by the K6 scale,26\nwith 5-item Likert frequency response\noptions for 6 items: depressed; nervous;\nrestless or fidgety; hopeless; everything\nwas an effort; worthless. We scored the\nK6 with 2-parameter binary item re-\nsponse theory (IRT) methods to obtain\nARTICLE\ndistress factor scores with a standard\nnormal distribution.26 (Cronbach a =\nunit change in the IRT-scaled K6 cor-\nresponds to approximately an SD; re-\ngression coefficients are interpreted\napproximately as proportions of an SD\nin effect size). IRT scoring is recom-\nmended because items with stronger\nrelationships to the underlying dis-\ntress construct are weighted heavier,\nincreasing reliability and precision\nBehavior problems were measured by\n11 self-reported items adapted from the\nBehavior Problems Index (BPI)28 assess-\ning primarily externalizing behaviors.\nResponses for items such as \"I lie or\ncheat\" and \"I have a hot temper\" range\nfrom 0 (not true) to 2 (often true).

Effect modi-\nfication is summarized graphically,\ndisplaying average treatment effects on\nmental health (experimental minus con-\ntrolmeans),foreachgender-victimization\nsubgroup. Negative values for treatment\ncoefficients indicate beneficial effects of\ntreatment.\nWhen ITT effect modification tests\nwere statistically significant, we also\ncalculated adherence-adjusted effect\nestimates based on instrumental vari-\nable (IV) analysis, estimated with\n2-stage least squares regression. We\nestimated IV effects because ITT effect\nestimates are probably attenuated\ncompared with effects of using the\nvoucher to move, given that many\nfamilies randomized to receive vouch-\ners did not use them. Direct compar-\nisons of movers to nonmovers would\npotentially be biased.

The IV approach also\nreveals whether patterns of ITT treat-\nment effect heterogeneity could be\nattributable to lower adherence\nrates among previously victimized\nfamilies.36 In MTO, IV effect estimates\nare typically interpreted as the effect of\nusing the voucher among individuals\nAll analyses accounted for household\nclustering, with weights accounting for\nrandom assignment ratio changes and\nattrition.7 We report robust SEs.

We\ndid not test these potential explan-\nations, although research on mecha-\nnisms is clearly needed. A child's age or\ndevelopmental stage may also modify\ntreatment,39 but we did not test that\nhypothesis in this study, although other\nimportant to investigate.\nOur findings suggest that gender is one\nof several social determinants that\nmodifies children's capacity to benefit\nfrom new resources and neighborhood\ncontexts, consistent with previous re-\nsearch on child development.6 We\nfound harm specific to 1 group: boys\nfrom families with a history of recent\ncrime victimization. This adds to emerg-\ning evidence emphasizing that low-\nincome children are often blocked\nfrom achieving healthy, successful\nadulthoods by an interlocking system of\nadversity in which individual and neigh-\nborhood socioeconomic disadvantage\ncompromise health via multiple path-\nrequires meaningful intersectoral col-\nlaboration, in particular, coordinating\nhousing and health services.\nHousing Choice Vouchers (formerly\nknown as Section 8), on which MTO was\nbased, are central to US rental housing\nassistance policy.53,54 Large-scale social\ninterventions of this kind, therefore,\nshould be designed and monitored with\nan eye to health impacts and the\npossibility of unintended negative con-\nsequences for vulnerable populations.\nDetermining which children accrue\nhealth benefits and which are harmed\nmay help enhance programs to improve\noutcomes for all children. Recently, in-\nnovative intersectoral programs (eg,\nmedical legal partnerships,55 volunteer\nprograms such as Health Leads),56\nwhich integrate social services into\nhealth care settings, have demonstrated\npromise for improving health outcomes\nfor low-income families. Social service\ndelivery programs are also increasingly\nintegrating health care; for example,\nHOPE VI, a major federal housing re-\nlocation program, requires tailored\nsupportive services for its residents,\nAn important question concerns whether\nthe neighborhood context, and/or\nthe move itself, influenced child men-\ntal health. Although there is some re-\nMTO cannot tease these apart because\nof its bundled treatment. Our results\ndocumented marginally stronger treat-\nment effects in the low-poverty group,\nrather than the section 8 group, pro-\nviding 1 clue that the type of neighbor-\nhood to which families moved may have\nmattered more for adolescent mental\nhealth than the move itself. This im-\nportant question for future research\nmay implicate other potential inter-\nventions such as place-based neigh-\nborhood revitalization efforts to modify\nneighborhoods directly.61\nMTO's original aims focused on economic\nself-sufficiency, not health,62 so mental\nhealth was not assessed at baseline.\nAdditional data would have improved\nstatistical power and facilitated inves-\ntigating differential treatment effects by\nbaseline health. Although we had limited\npower given low prevalence of MDD, our\nconsistent pattern of results was tri-\nangulated from different mental health\noutcomes, including diagnostic, symp-\ntomatology, internalizing, and external-\nizing measures, which may jointly better\nrepresent a broader universe of mental\nhealth outcomes. We operationalized vi-\nolent crime victimization at the family\nlevel, assuming it affects the whole\nfamily,63 because no individual-level var-\niable was available. Lastly, these findings\nmay not generalize to all adolescents\nbecause MTO familieswere exceptionally\ndisadvantaged at baseline. Yet this pop-\nulation is of particular social relevance\nas the target of means-tested policies.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe $70 million MTO demonstration\nprogram sought to assess the potential\neffects of moving low-income families\nfrom high- to low-poverty neighbor-\nhoods.24 Its experimental design places\nMTO among the strongest existing stud-\nies of how changes in neighborhood\ncontext affect children's mental health.\nOur results show that the MTO program\nbenefited a robust group of adolescent\ngirls and harmed a particularly vulner-\nable group of adolescent boys. Incor-\nporating additional services across\nsectors may be important for facilitating\nsuccessful outcomes among all families\nreceiving housing mobility assistance.\nREFERENCES\n1. Aneshensel CS.
