    "abstract": "ABSTRACT: States have been intensifying their efforts to control rising prescription drug\ncosts in their Medicaid programs. This study examines the effects of five Medicaid cost con-\ntainment policies on enrollees' perceptions of their ability to get prescription drugs. The re-\nsults show that enrollees in states that have implemented all or almost all of these five poli-\ncies have greater problems getting prescription drugs than enrollees in other states\nencounter. In terms of specific policies, prior authorization and mandatory generic substitu-\ntions had the largest effects on access to prescription drugs.\nThe increase in Medicaid outpatient\nprescription drug costs and use has\nbeen one of the main contributing fac-\ntors to overall increases in program costs in\nrecent years. Outpatient drug spending in\nMedicaid rose about 18 percent annually be-\ncent for all personal health care services in\nMedicaid.1 As a share of total Medicaid\nspending, drug spending doubled during the\nDespite these rising costs, all states have re-\ntained their outpatient prescription drug ben-\nefits, which is optional in Medicaid. To contain\nincreasing costs, almost all states have imple-\nmented one or more strategies aimed at man-\naging prescription drug use or curtailing\nwasteful and ineffective use. Cost sharing (that\nis, copayments) is one of the oldest and most\nprevalent forms of utilization management\n(UM), but a variety of other methods are in-\ncreasingly being used. These include prior au-\nthorization, preferred drug lists, dispensing\nlimits, mandatory use of generics, and step\ntherapy.2 Many states have also tried to con-\ntain costs by reducing their reimbursement to\npharmacies, negotiating supplemental rebates\nwith manufacturers, and monitoring high-cost\nusers and prescribers of drugs.\nAs state budgets have tightened consider-\nably since 2000--attributable in part to the in-\ncreases in Medicaid spending as well as to\nslow economic growth--efforts to contain\nMedicaid drug spending have intensified. Ac-\ncording to a recent survey, the percentage of\nstates with mandatory prescribing of generics\ndispensing limits increased from 20 percent in\ncost sharing increased from 66 percent of\nthe percentage of states using three or more\ncost-control strategies has increased greatly,\nfrom about one-third of states in 2000 to\nH e a l t h T r a c k i n g\nPeterCunningham(pcunningham@hschange.org)isaseniorhealthresearcherattheCenterforStudyingHealth\nSystemChangeinWashington,D.C.\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Despite the near-\nuniversal implementation of one or more cost\ncontainment policies, virtually nothing is\nknown about the effects of these policies on\nprescription drug costs, use, and access. Most\nof the prior research on this topic dates from\nfects of copayments on Medicaid prescription\ndrug use and spending. The findings from\nthese studies show that even a small copay-\nment in Medicaid (for example, fifty cents per\nprescription) reduces prescription drug use\nand spending across a broad range of thera-\npeutic categories, including those considered\nto be essential medications.4\nNevertheless, inferring the effects of recent\ncost containment policies on prescription\ndrug use and access from this previous re-\nsearch is questionable, given the rapid increase\nin the development of new medications, use,\nand spending since many of these studies were\nconducted. And since most states have now\nimplemented more than one cost containment\npolicy, it is increasingly difficult to attribute\neffects on use and access to any specific policy.\nA more recent study (by this author) found\nthat prescription drug access was particularly\nproblematic in states that had implemented\nmultiple cost containment policies.5\nn Present study. This study, using data\nTracking Study (CTS) household surveys,\ncompares the extent of prescription drug ac-\ncess problems for adult Medicaid enrollees\nwith the access problems of adults who have\nother types of insurance coverage and who\nhave no insurance. It then examines the effects\nof cost containment policies and other factors\non prescription drug access among adult\nMedicaid beneficiaries and the effect of the in-\ncrease in states' cost containment policies on\nStudy Data And Methods\nn Data. The CTS household survey is de-\nsigned to produce representative estimates of\nhealth insurance coverage, access to care, use\nof services, and perceived quality of care for\nthe U.S. population and sixty randomly se-\nlected communities in thirty-four states and\nthe District of Columbia.6 The CTS is primar-\nily a telephone survey, supplemented by in-\nperson interviews of households without tele-\nphones, to ensure representation.

This\nstudy includes data from the third round of the\nThe overall sample for the surveys includes\nstudy focuses on all adults (age eighteen and\nolder) who reported that they were enrolled in\nMedicaid, which includes about 1,600 people\nrepresented in each of the two surveys.\nn Measure of drug access. Based on a\nsimilar question asked in the National Health\nInterview Survey (NHIS), sampled people in\nthe following question: \"During the past\ntwelve months, was there any time you needed\nprescription medicines but didn't get them be-\ncause you couldn't afford it?\" Although the\nquestion refers only to medications prescribed\nby a physician, the self-reported measure is\nlimited in that the medical necessity of the\nmedication could not be verified.\nThe strength of the measure is that it allows\nfor broad comparisons of drug access between\npopulation groups. In this sense, validity is\ndemonstrated by the fact that it is strongly\ncorrelated with characteristics of populations\nthat are expected to have the greatest prob-\nlems affording prescription drugs: namely,\npoor and low-income people, uninsured peo-\nple, and people in poor health and with\nchronic conditions (that is, the most frequent\nusers).\nn Measures of Medicaid cost contain-\nment policies.

This study focuses on five commonly used\nUM policies that are likely to have the most di-\nrect impact on enrollees' use and access.8\nThese include the following: (1) Prior\nauthorization: Pharmacists are required to ob-\ntain approval from the state (or a subcontrac-\ntor) before dispensing a drug. (2) Copayments:\nBeneficiaries are required to pay a nominal\ncopayment for each prescription (usually be-\ntween fifty cents and three dollars), although\nthe state cannot deny a drug because of inabil-\nity to pay the copayment. (3) Dispensing lim-\nits: States limit the number of prescriptions\nthat Medicaid will cover during a certain time\nperiod (for example, one month). (4) Generic\ndrugs: State law requires generics.9 (5) Step\ntherapy: Physicians need to demonstrate that a\nlower-cost drug is ineffective before prescrib-\ning a more costly alternative.\nThere is considerable variation among\nstates in how these individual policies work\n(for example, states use different copayment\namounts, and the medications subjected to\nprior authorization and generic mandates dif-\nfer across states). Accounting for all of the\nvariation in state policies is not feasible, and it\nis unlikely that the general measure of pre-\nscription drug access used in this study would\nbe sensitive to many of these details.\nn Analysis. The study first compared ac-\ncess to prescription drugs for adult Medicaid\nbeneficiaries with that of other adults (both\ninsured and uninsured) in 2003, and then it ex-\namined changes in prescription drug access\ncess by insurance coverage were also com-\nputed by controlling for a variety of other fac-\ntors that are likely to be correlated with\naccess, including age, sex, race/ethnicity, fam-\nily income, family type, health status, and\nchronic conditions.10\nRegression analysis was used to examine\nthe effects of Medicaid cost containment\nmethods and other factors on access to pre-\nscription drugs for adult Medicaid beneficia-\nries.11 As a general test of the intensity of states'\ncost containment efforts, the analysis first ex-\namined the effect of multiple cost containment\npolicies on access.12 Observations from the\nsingle regression to increase the statistical pre-\ncision of estimates. The analysis controlled for\ndifferences in individual characteristics and all\nother state-level factors (for example, other\nstate policies, including state pharmacy assis-\ntance programs for dual eligibles).13\nA second regression analysis was per-\nformed to examine the effects of each individ-\nual cost containment policy on access. This re-\ngression was identical to the first in all\nrespects except that Medicaid cost contain-\nment policies were specified as five separate\nindicators for each policy. Examining and in-\nterpreting the effects of each policy is difficult\nbecause virtually all states have implemented\nmore than one policy, and there is some inter-\ncorrelation in the effects of these policies on\naccess.\nStudy Findings\nn Characteristics of Medicaid en-\nrollees. Compared with all U.S. adults,\nMedicaid enrollees are somewhat younger,\nmuch poorer, more likely to be members of a\nracial/ethnic minority, and likely to have less\nfavorable health overall and a much higher\nprevalence of chronic conditions (Exhibit 1).\nLower incomes and high rates of health prob-\nlems are particularly high-risk factors for\nproblems with affording prescription drugs.\nincrease in younger Medicaid enrollees (ages\n18\u00ad34), those with incomes in the near-poor\nlevel), and married couples with children; also,\nthere was a decrease in those with chronic\nconditions.

For exam-\nple, having multiple chronic conditions\nstrongly increases the probability of having\nprescription drug access problems (16.3 per-\ncent). While a decrease in the percentage of\nMedicaid enrollees with multiple chronic con-\nditions resulted in a net decrease in access\nproblems, the effect was less than 1 percent.\nOther net effects of changes in individual char-\nacteristics were even smaller, and some\nchanges (in age and income) led to a small net\nincrease in access problems. When summed\nacross all individual characteristics, there was\nno net effect on access from changes in\nenrollee characteristics.\nOn the other hand, the results show an un-\nexplained decrease in the probability of pre-\nscription drug access problems between the\nvariable for the 2003 survey).

Improvements in safety-net\ncapacity and coordination during this period\nmay have benefited both Medicaid enrollees\nand uninsured people in providing greater ac-\ncess to free or lower-cost prescription drugs,\nas well as in providing more\nassistance to Medicaid en-\nrollees in navigating the in-\ncreasingly complicated rules\nof the Medicaid pharmacy\nn Effects of individual\ncost containment policies.\nA second regression analy-\nsis--identical to the first in\nall respects except for the\nspecification of Medicaid\ncost containment policies--\nwas performed to test the ef-\nfects of individual cost containment policies.\nIndicators for each of the five cost contain-\nment policies (whether or not the enrollee\nlives in a state with that policy) were included\nin the analysis. The results show that prior au-\nthorization and generic requirements had the\nlargest negative effects on access: Prior autho-\nrization requirements increased the probabil-\nity of prescription drug access problems by\ntwenty percentage points; requiring the use of\ngeneric substitutes increased the probability\nby about eight percentage points (data not\nshown). Copayments, dispensing limits, or\nstep therapy requirements had no statistically\nsignificant affects on access.\nPrior authorization. The effects (or lack\nthereof) of individual policies are difficult to\ninterpret, since most states have implemented\nmore than one policy and there is some inter-\ncorrelation between these factors and the mea-\nsure of prescription drug access. Since some\nform of prior authorization is used in most\nstates, the large effects observed for this policy\nmay be more indicative of the uniqueness of\nthe small number of states that do not have\nsuch requirements. States without prior au-\nthorization tend to have very few cost contain-\nment policies of any type, and therefore pre-\nscription drug access problems would be\nexpected to be much lower. Nevertheless, case\nstudies of states' prior authorization programs\nhave observed that these programs can lead to\nbureaucratic and communication problems\namong enrollees, providers, and pharmaceuti-\ncal benefit management firms under contract\nto the state, which in turn can\nlead to delays and other prob-\nlems with prescription drug\nGenericmandates. That man-\ndatory generic requirements\nwould lead to higher reports\nof access problems may also\nbe surprising, since these do\nnot imply a cost to the en-\nrollee. It is possible that some\nphysicians continue to pre-\nscribe some brand-name\ndrugs when generics are re-\nquired because they are unaware of the policy\nor they believe that a brand name is more effi-\ncacious than its generic substitute. Also, some\nenrollees may specifically request brand-name\ndrugs. If such drugs are prescribed when ge-\nneric substitutes are required, enrollees would\npotentially have to pay the full cost of the med-\nication.\nOther policies. That copayments, dispensing\nlimits, and step therapy did not have inde-\npendent effects on prescription drug access\nmay be because they are correlated with prior\nauthorization and mandatory generic policies\n(that is, states often have both policies), or be-\ncause these policies affect relatively few people\nand both the sample of Medicaid enrollees and\nthe measure of access are too broad to observe\nthe effects of these policies. For example, co-\npayments and dispensing limits may affect\nonly the very heaviest users of prescription\ndrugs (of which there may be too few in the\nsample to affect the overall results), whereas\nstep therapy applies to a relatively small num-\nber of drug classes.\nM a r k e t W a t c h\nH E A LT H A F F A I R S ~ Vo l u m e 2 4 , N u m b e r 3 7 8 7\n\"Policymakers should\nexamine whether\nthese cost\ncontainment policies\nare inadvertently\nrestricting access to\nneeded medications\nthrough bureaucratic\nobstacles.\"\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Although it\nis not possible with the general measure of ac-\ncess used in this study to distinguish between\nessential and nonessential medications, previ-\nous research on the effects of copayments and\nprior authorization have shown negative ef-\nfects on use of prescription drugs across a\nwide range of therapeutic categories, includ-\ning those considered \"essential.\"16 That these\naccess problems are particularly high for peo-\nple with chronic conditions--which include a\ndisproportionately high number of Medicaid\nenrollees--also suggests that there is unmet\nneed for at least some essential medications.\nOngoing increases in Medicaid prescrip-\ntion drug costs and strained state budgets\nmean that cost containment policies will\nlikely continue and even increase in states that\nhave so far been less aggressive. Rolling back\nthese policies is probably unrealistic given the\nmagnitude of Medicaid spending on state\nbudgets, especially when most private insur-\nance plans are trying to contain costs through\ngreater enrollee cost sharing, preferred drug\nlists, and incentives to use generics. Rather,\npolicymakers should examine whether these\ncost containment policies are inadvertently re-\nstricting access to needed medications\nthrough bureaucratic obstacles or lack of\nawareness among Medicaid enrollees and pro-\nviders as to how to navigate the often complex\nprocesses of obtaining approval to use certain\ndrugs.\nFor example, pharmacists are not permit-\nted by law to deny prescriptions to Medicaid\nenrollees even if they cannot pay the copay-\nment, although research has shown that many\npharmacists have poor knowledge of these re-\nquirements and often collect copayments\nwhen it is inappropriate to do so (for example,\nfrom children under age eighteen).17 Also, prior\nauthorization programs in particular vary con-\nsiderably across states, in terms of both the\nnumber and the types of medications that are\nsubject to preauthorization as well as the pro-\ncesses that are established for obtaining au-\nthorization for a medication. Although this\nstudy suggests that prior authorization has re-\nsulted in reduced access, more intensive case\nstudies of state programs reveal considerable\nvariation in how they operate as well as the\nlevel of difficulty enrollees and their physi-\ncians have in obtaining approval.18\nIdentifying the exact mechanisms by which\nthe various cost containment policies affect\naccess was not possible in this analysis be-\ncause of the relatively small samples, the gen-\neral measure of access, and difficulty in devel-\noping more detailed classifications of state\npolicies based on available data. Further evalu-\nation and monitoring of the effects of cost con-\ntainment policies on access at the state level\nare key to successful implementation and\nstreamlining of these policies.\nEnsuring that cost containment policies do\nnot inadvertently harm access to necessary\nmedications is especially important given the\nhigh need for prescription medications among\nMedicaid enrollees as well as their lower abil-\nity to use their own resources to make up for\nany shortfall.\nThisresearchwassupportedbytheRobertWood\nJohnsonFoundationthroughitssupportoftheCenter\nforStudyingHealthSystemChange.Theauthorthanks\nPaulGinsburg,LenNichols,andJimReschovskyfor\nprovidinghelpfulcomments,andEllenSingerofSocial\nandScientificSystemsforexcellentprogramming\nassistance.\nNOTES\n1.

A notable exclusion from these five policies is the\nuse of preferred drug lists (PDLs), which are ex-\ncluded because they were ascertained in the 2003\nKaiser Family Foundation survey but not the\n2000 survey, whereas the five policies included in\nthe analysis were ascertained in both surveys.\nPDLs are in many ways a variant of prior authori-\nzation (prior authorization is needed for drugs\nnot on the list), and therefore the exclusion is un-\nlikely to have any major effects on results. In fact,\nseparate analyses of 2003 data only (based on the\nmethodology described below) did not find any\nindependent effect of PDLs on prescription drug\naccess.\n9. In some states, the use of generics is encouraged\n(but not required) through the use of differential\ncopayments, differential dispensing fees, and\nprovider education. The measure in this study re-\nflects only states that require generics as the\nmost restrictive form of cost containment poli-\ncies.\n10. Adjusted means were computed from ordinary\nleast squares (OLS) regression using the 2003\nsurvey data, with access as the dependent vari-\nable and insurance coverage and other individual\ncharacteristics as independent variables.\n11. Although a probit or logistic regression is nor-\nmally used when the dependent variable is bi-\nnary, OLS regression was used in this analysis be-\ncause the coefficients reflected linear probabili-\nties and were therefore easier to interpret. Re-\nsults from a logistic regression analysis produced\nvery similar results.\n12. The analysis focused on comparing states that\nhave implemented four or five policies with\nstates that implemented three or fewer. There\nwere too few states that had implemented no\npolicies to analyze separately, and earlier versions\nof the analysis show that there were no differ-\nences in access between states with two or fewer\npolicies and states with three policies.\n13. Dual eligibles are people who are eligible for both\nMedicaid and Medicare. Binary variables for each\nstate were included to control for all other state-\nlevel factors that could potentially confound the\neffects of cost containment policies on prescrip-\ntion drug access.
