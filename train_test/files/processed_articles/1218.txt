In each phase,\nit represents a stratified random sample of the entire US\npopulation, with certain groups oversampled in order to\nincrease the precision of estimates for that group. All persons\nchosen were assigned a sampling weight related to their inverse\nprobability of selection. All subjects chosen who agreed to\nparticipate completed a questionnaire, and were invited to\nundergo a complete physical examination. In the Third\nsubset of the examined subjects, aged 20\u00ad59 years, volunteered\nto provide a urine sample for analysis of selected pesticide\nresidues or their metabolites as an indication of exposure to\nthese pesticides (US Department of Health and Human\nServices (USDHHS), 1999). This subset was a nonrepresenta-\ntive convenience sampling of the survey participants; however,\nthe demographic representation of the subset was diverse.\nThe usage of a creatinine correction for urinary concentra-\ntion data has long been controversial in the pesticide\nexposure literature. This paper reviews the data generated\nfrom these analyses performed by the National Center for\nEnvironmental Health (NCEH) at CDC, and suggests an\n1. Address all correspondence to: David T.

We also discuss the factors that can cause\nthese exposure-related values to be either an overestimation\nor underestimation of actual dose received.\nMethod of creatinine correction\nAs a part of the NHANES-III study, CDC collected and\nanalyzed a spot sample of urine from a group of 978 adult\nvolunteer subjects for 12 analytes that represent exposure to\npesticides. A ``spot-sample'' is a void without a record of the\nvolume (DV) or the elapsed time in hours from the previous\nvoid (Dt). Consequently, these pesticide analyses do not allow\nextrapolation of the total mass of analyte measured (Dm) to a\ndaily excretion rate as either 24Dm/Dt or V Dm/DV, where V\nis the expected daily urine volume excreted by the subject with\nknown age, gender and body mass, at that time of the year.\nHowever, a correction using the creatinine (Cn) concentration\nmeasured in the same samples can be used for this estimation,\nas described in detail in a following section:\nThe CDC reported concentration data for 12 pesticide-\nrelated analytes in units of micrograms of analyte per liter of\nurine (mg/l) (Hill et al., 1995). Table 1 lists the analytes\n(pesticide residues and metabolites) reported, the possible\nparent pesticides of the metabolites, and their respective\nreference doses (RfD). The RfD is an average daily intake\nvalue over a lifetime thought to be acceptable, based upon\ncurrently available animal toxicity studies. For some\npesticides, the analyte is the pesticide itself; for example,\n2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D). However, in most\ncases, the analyte is a metabolite of the parent pesticide,\ngenerally the primary metabolite.\nWhereas detection of a pesticide in a urine sample above\nthe minimum detectable level (MDL) means that the subject\nwas exposed to that pesticide, a detectable urinary concen-\ntration of a pesticide metabolite only indicates that the\nsubject was exposed to one or more of its parent pesticides, to\nthe metabolite itself, or to a pharmaceutical or other chemical\nwith the same metabolite. The numerical value of the analyte\nconcentration in mg/l is determined by several unknown\nquantities which are discussed in detail below: (1) the\namounts of the parent pesticide(s) and their metabolites to\nwhich the subject has been exposed; (2) the hydration status\nTable 1.

Several of the other pesticides in this list already had been banned by EPA.\nbAnalyte is not specific for one parent compound.\ncParent compound can be measured as two or more analytes.\nPesticide exposure by creatinine correction\nMage et al.\nor fluid intake of the subjects as evidenced in the dilution of\nthe urine; and (3) body chemistry.\nPesticide Intake\nThe presence of a detectable concentration of the analyte in\nthe urine of an NHANES-III participant only means that the\nsubject had been exposed through some unknown pathway\nto the analyte, its parent pesticide, or another chemical\ncapable of producing the same metabolite. Furthermore, if\nany given metabolite is also an environmental degradation\nproduct, one cannot determine whether the exposure, in\nwhole or in part, was to the parent pesticide itself or to the\nenvironmental degradate. Presence of the degradation\nproduct in food may arise from reaction of the parent\npesticide due to thermal action during cooking or environ-\nmental factors in the field where it was applied (e.g., by plant\nor bacterial metabolism or through the action of moisture\nand sunlight). For the organophosphate and carbamate\npesticides, the degradation product and the human metabo-\nlite may be the same chemical. For the purpose of this\ninterpretation, we make the following assumptions:\n(1) that the metabolite in the urine was derived solely from\nexposure to the parent pesticide because the RfDs are\nassociated only with the parent pesticide, not the metabolite;\n(2) that 100% of the pesticide dose was converted in vivo to\nthe metabolite (e.g., 100% of the chlorpyrifos dose was\nconverted to 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol) as no human\nexperimental data showing otherwise are available at this\ntime; and\n(3) that 100% of the metabolite was excreted in urine\nunless experimental data show otherwise, as is only the case\nA spot sample gives no information as to the previous time\ncourse of exposure, such as whether the exposure was a single\noccurrence at some previous point in time or a variable daily\nexposure. This is because each corresponding residue has a\nlow-concentration first-order half-life in the blood after\nabsorption that differs among individuals, depending in part\non the state of health of the kidney and liver enzyme\nfunctions. For example, the subject could have been recently\nexposed to a quantity sufficient to rapidly attain the\nmeasured urinary value, or exposed to twice as much one\nhalf-life previously, or four times as much two half-lives\npreviously. Alternatively, the subject could have been\nexposed continuously to randomly varying daily amounts\nthat happened to result in the measured urinary concentra-\ntion. From a single urine sample, it is impossible to\ndifferentiate between the myriad numbers of potential\nexposure profiles that could have produced that single\nmeasured value.\nFluid Intake\nThe concentration of the analyte in the urine (mg/l) also\ndepends upon the quantity of fluid excreted by the kidneys.\nUrine is created to excrete metabolic waste products to\nprevent their build-up in the blood. If one has zero recent\nfluid intake from food and drink, a minimal amount of fluid\nis passed as a carrier vehicle. When food and drink are\nconsumed, the excess fluids increase the excreted fluid\nvolume, which decreases the concentration of the pesticide\nor its metabolite in the urine. For example, diuresis (e.g.,\nexcessive liquid intake or hydration) may artificially reduce\nthe concentration of a pesticide or its metabolite in the urine,\nbut not the amount. Traditionally, urinary creatinine has\nbeen used to correct for variable urine dilution (see discussion\nbelow). In addition, urinary specific gravity and osmolality,\nnot recorded in the NHANES-III, have been used to help\ncorrect for hydration status in spot urine samples, but such\nmethods have their own methodological uncertainties.\nBody Chemistry\nThe rate of excretion of any solute from the blood into the\nurine depends on several factors: passive glomerular filtration\nof smaller molecules; facilitated secretion of larger molecules\nthrough the renal tubules; and downstream reabsorption of\nsubstances from renal tubules. Blood pressure (BP), diabetes,\nrenal disease, renal blood flow, urinary tract obstruction and\ncertain drugs affect the glomerular filtration rate and tubular\nsecretion rate differently, and these rates may vary widely\namong individuals based upon their unique combination of\nphysiological parameters. It should be noted that the tubular\nsecretion processes are not strictly linear because an increase\nof a tubularly-secreted pesticide analyte in the blood may not\nalways lead to an increased elimination. Each facilitated renal\ntransport system has a maximal rate, or transport maximum\n(Tm), at which it can secrete a given solute with a molecular\nsize too large to allow passage through the glomerular filter\n(Berkhin and Humphreys, 2001). In this process, a specific\ncarrier protein can bind to one of possibly several ligands,\nsuch as a pesticide analyte. The bound chemicals transport\nthrough the tubular walls, the ligand (analyte) is released into\nthe urine and, the protein returns to pick up another ligand.\nThus, the amount of a particular solute secreted by this\nmechanism is approximately proportionate to the amount\npresent up to the Tm for that solute when no other competing\nligands are present. However, at higher concentrations, the\ntransport mechanism is saturated and there is no appreciable\nincrement in the transport rate because there are no more\ncarrier proteins available. Consequently, a spot urine sample\nfrom a pesticide applicator who has had a high accidental\nexposure leading to a large dosage of a mixture of pesticides\nmay provide misleading information, because there may be\ncompetition for the limited number of transport proteins that\nfacilitate the process of tubular secretion for a given target\npesticide analyte.\nFor example, a subject who had a recent therapeutic dose\nof penicillin may preferentially tubularly secrete the higher\nconcentration of penicillin rather than a lower concentration\nPesticide exposure by creatinine correction Mage et al.\nof a targeted pesticide analyte if they both required the same\ncarrier protein for their transport. Thus, a subject who may\nhave been exposed to a pesticide may be excreting a lesser\nquantity of a target analyte because of the presence of a\ncompetitive ligand. In NHANES-III, some subjects reported\ntaking medication, but did not specify which pharmaceuticals\nthey took. Also, they may have received significant exposures\nto other environmental chemicals concurrent with or near the\ntime of exposure to the pesticides measured. Therefore,\nrecent use of medication or over the counter drugs or\nconcurrent environmental exposures may have impacted the\nurinary concentration of the pesticide analytes of interest in\nthis study.\nFinally, the transient factors that influence glomerular\nfiltration may be independent of the factors that influence\nthe rates of tubular secretion of pesticide analytes. Thus, the\nelimination rate of a smaller molecule by glomerular\nfiltration does not parallel the secretion rate of those larger\nanalyte molecules excreted by tubular secretion. These\nuncertainties may be partially resolved by use of the\nsubject's excretion of creatinine (Cn), a metabolic break-\ndown product of cellular creatine, under a specific set of\ncircumstances which might be related to a subject's normal\nday-to-day exposure activities.\nCreatinine Correction and Daily Excretion\nCreatinine is a byproduct of skeletal muscle metabolism of\ncreatine, and is picked up continuously in the blood at a\nrelatively constant rate that is proportional to the muscle\nmass of the individual. Additional increments of creatinine\noccur from dietary red-meat intake and use of creatine as a\nbody-building supplement. Creatinine is cleared from the\nblood plasma in the kidney at an approximately constant\nrate, primarily by filtration through the glomerulus (B80%)\nbut a small amount is cleared by tubular secretion (B20%).\nConversely, pesticide or pesticide metabolite intake is a\ntransient process and it is not relatively constant from day to\nday. For example, dietary intake may occur at different times\nof the day and the pesticide content of the diet changes\nmarkedly with the source and identity of the food eaten.\nInhalation and dermal contact with pesticides may occur\ninfrequently (e.g., once per month when pets are treated with\nflea powder) or by chance when a subject visits a location that\nwas recently treated and touches a contaminated object.\nConsequently, in the blood, a pesticide analyte concentration\nfluctuates much more rapidly than the concentration of\ncreatinine which is normally kept in homeostasis.\nEstimating the Dose of a Pesticide\nWhen an analyte value is reported above the MDL, all we\nknow is that the subject has been exposed to it or its parent\ncompound, but we have absolutely no information on the\nmagnitude or timing of that previous exposure. If, and only\nif, the subject has a relatively constant pesticide/metabolite\nintake (mg/kg/day) and a constant dietary intake of red meat,\nand the tubular secretion transport mechanism is not\nsaturated for the target pesticide or its metabolite, the body\nwill equilibrate and excrete in the urine approximately\nconstant amounts of that analyte and creatinine per day.\nThis set of circumstances may not exist in practice, and it\nrestricts our analysis to a set of conditions where a linear\ntubular secretion process is taking place below the transport-\nmaximum concentrations where saturation makes the\nclearance process zero-order non-linear. Human Tm values\nfor these analytes are not reported in the literature so we\ncannot check the validity of our assumptions concerning\nthem. However, it is the only way that the NHANES-III\nspot-sample data can be transformed from a urinary\nconcentration distribution (mg/l) into an exposure distribu-\ntion (mg/kg/day) consistent with the RfD. This Cn correction\nis not straightforward and its usage is controversial\n(Dell'Orto et al., 1987). We have analyzed these data using\nsuch a Cn correction as described below. It is a potentially\nimportant addition to the body of knowledge for NHANES\ndata analysis and usage in risk assessment.\nIn practice, there is no consistent convention for use of Cn\nto correct for the influence of hydration. For example, the\nCDC did not report analyte data for adult urine samples in\nNHANES-III, for which the Cn concentrations were below\n0.3 g/l on the basis that it represented a highly dilute urine\nan arbitrary choice of Cn cut off (a value of 0.30 g/l\nacceptable and 0.29 g/l not acceptable) arises because\nextremes of hydration and dehydration may cause different\nchanges in the rates of Cn and pesticide analyte excretion\nmay also be affected by the renal functional status of the\nsubject, BP, pregnancy, drugs, exercise and red meat intake\n(Neithardt et al., 2002). The ratio of pesticide or pesticide\nmetabolite clearance to Cn clearance may also be affected by\nthese same conditions. For example, Radha and Bessman\n(1983) studied the effect of a 1-h intensive exercise on young\nmales placed on a meat-free diet. Immediately following the\nexercise, Cn excretion rates decreased significantly. Bennett\nand Wilkins (1993) found that their subjects' BP was\ninversely related to their urinary Cn concentration. Bingham\ncooked meat to volunteers on a uniform metabolic diet raised\ntheir Cn excretion rates by 23%. With fluctuations of these\nquantities, the average coefficients of variation of sequential\ndaily Cn excretion in healthy adults were measured as 4%\nWaterlow, 1986). Given these caveats, we make the following\nsimplifying assumptions:\n(1) There is no pathology involved, such as kidney failure or\na muscle-wasting disease;\nPesticide exposure by creatinine correction\nMage et al.\n(2) The food intake is by typical omnivorous diet, with\nneither excessive red meat consumption nor a strict\nvegetarian diet.\n(3) The ratio of pesticide analyte to Cn in a spot urine\nsample represents an average value corresponding to a\ncomplete 24-h total urine collection centered on the urine\nsample interval.\n(4) There is no pesticide metabolite intake by dietary\ningestion or any other route of exposure.\n(5) The pesticide analyte's Transport Maximum is not\nexceeded by any subject.\nResults\nComputation of Equivalent Pesticide Dose\nThe pesticide concentration in the blood represents an\nintegrated net effect of the subjects' previous exposures to\npesticides via ingestion (food, water, hand to mouth activity),\ninhalation and dermal contacts. The health effects of such\nexposures are usually a monotonic increasing function of the\nsystemic dose to the exposed person, in terms of micrograms\nper kilogram body weight per day (mg/kg/day). Although\npeople may be exposed to a pesticide by inhalation and\ndermal contact, we choose to report these data as if all the\npesticide/metabolite residue had a dietary origin, because the\nUSEPA Office of Pesticide Programs has established a set of\nRfDs based primarily on dietary intake of their parent\npesticides. Thus, the person with the highest imputed dosage\nin mg/kg/day is considered to have been the person with the\nhighest dietary exposure to the pesticide. As described\npreviously, each person excretes Cn at an approximately\nconstant rate on a daily basis, with homeostasis regulated by\nthe kidney. The effect of diuresis can also be corrected using\nthat may be more accurate than the Cn method, but there are\nalso more physiological factors influencing specific gravity\nOwing to the large interindividual variation in Cn\nexcretion, we chose to model this variability for each subject,\ninstead of using the same mean values for all subjects. There\nare established norms for excretion of Cn on a daily basis, as\na function of age, gender and body surface area (BSA). The\nBSA determines the daily heat loss that must be recovered\nthrough cellular metabolism that generates the Cn that is\nexcreted by the urine. The BSA can be modeled as a function\nof a person's age, gender, height and weight. An expression\nfor Cn production by ``normal'' males and females in the\nNHANES-III can be developed because there is an age,\ngender, height and weight recorded for each subject.\nFor BSA, the Mosteller (1987) formula is\nFor creatinine clearance (CnCl), ml plasma cleared/min/\nMale CnCl \u00bc\u00bd\u00f0140 \u00c0 age\u00bdyear\u00de \u00c3 wt\u00f0kg\u00de=\n\u00bd72 \u00c3 serum Cn \u00f0mg=dl\u00de\n\u00bd72 \u00c3 serum Cn \u00f0mg=dl\u00de\nTherefore, the expected daily production of Cn is\nMale: (mg Cn/dl serum) (ml plasma/min/1.73 m2 BSA)\nSimplifying, and substituting for BSA, the expected\nmicrograms Cn excreted per day is:\ntall, would have an expected Cn daily production of 1.78 g/\nday, and a female of the same age, height and weight would\nhave a Cn production of 1.51 g/day.\nThe NHANES-III did not collect urine from children for\nreporting pesticide analyte concentration data, so the\nprocedure we developed was not applied for estimating a\nchild's dose of pesticide. However, provided the appropriate\nequations for children are used to predict a child's daily\ncreatinine clearance rate as a function of gender, age and\nbody surface area, the same technique is applicable (Shull\nchildren are not expected to be as accurate as those for adults\nowing to rapidly changing metabolism and BSA from\ninfancy through puberty. We note that this proposed method\nusing urine concentration may be useful especially for infants\nwhen it is difficult to collect a urine sample.\nComputation of Total Exposure\nThe reported urinary analyte concentration in mg/l is\ncorrected to units of eliminated dose in mg/kg/day by the\nCn concentration. This makes sense if, and only if, the\nsubject is at steady state with respect to the analyte, and\nthe tubular secretion Tm is not exceeded. Then, the parent\npesticide intake in molar units would also be equal to the\ntarget analyte excretion on a molar basis (assuming that\none molecule of parent pesticide metabolizes to one or\nmore different molecules of analyte). To correct the analyte\nexcretion for parent pesticide intake, that value must\nbe multiplied by the ratio of molecular weight pesticide to\nthe molecular weight of the analyte. However, not all analytes\nare excreted in the urine, as some are soluble in the bile and are\neliminated in the feces. Also, some of the pesticide may be\nPesticide exposure by creatinine correction Mage et al.\nexcreted unchanged, so we may be neglecting that part of the\nexposure. Thus, to account for the amount of pesticide\nabsorbed that is distributed, metabolized, or excreted differ-\nently, the amount of pesticide corresponding to the analyte\nexcreted also must be multiplied by the ratio of mol pesticide\nintake to the known mol analyte excreted in urine from that\nchlorpyrifos intake per mole TCPY excreted in the urine but\nnot all researchers make this correction (Buck et al., 2001).\nFollowing our data analysis procedure, we can convert\neach pair of values for urinary analyte concentration and Cn\nconcentration into a value of the virtual parent pesticide\nexposure as a daily dietary intake in units of mg/kg/day that\nwould equilibrate to those measured values, subject to the\nrestrictive assumption of nonsaturation of tubular secretion.\nThis exposure can then be compared to an RfD established\nby the EPA for the parent compound. There are uncertainty\nfactors involved in setting an RfD; so a value above the RfD,\nbut below the lowest observed effect level, does not\nnecessarily imply a health effect is likely.\nSince some analytes have multiple parents, such as 3,5,6-\nTCPY which is a metabolite of both chlorpyrifos and\nchlorpyrifos-methyl, we have chosen the parent compound\nthat people not occupationally applying pesticides would\nmost likely be exposed to in normal daily activities. In the\ncase cited above, chlorpyrifos would be the most likely\ncompound the subject was exposed to, as chlorpyrifos methyl\nis an insecticide used primarily in fumigation of stored grain.\nTreatment of the Minimum Detectable Levels (MDL)\nThe MDL established by the CDC for the chlorpyrifos\nmetabolite 3,5,6-TCPY is 1 mg/l. Consequently, if a subject has\na oMDL residue of TCPYand a Cn concentration in the urine\nof 0.3 g/dl, then the Cn corrected value would be (o1 mg/l)/\nto the variable denominator Cn concentration, each o1 mg/l\nMDL value translates into a different maximum possible mg\nTCPY residue/g Cn that could not have been observed. To\nanalyze these MDL data, with the observed data, we use the\nmethod of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) to fit the\ndata set with the SB\nknown as the four-parameter lognormal distribution.\nFitting the Censored SB\nDistribution\nThe distribution of pesticide/metabolite residues in urine has\ntwo asymptotic properties quite different from those of a\nclassic two-parameter lognormal distribution, where the\nvariable X is bounded as 0oXoN. These differences are\nthat subjects who were not recently exposed to a given\npesticide may have that pesticide's metabolite concentration\nin the urine equal to zero, and the maximum possible urine\nconcentration cannot approach infinity and must be finite.\nThe SB\ncan be expressed by a lognormal distribution\nbounded by a lower concentration (Xmin\n) and a maximum\nconcentration (Xmax\nthat the variable Y, where Y \u00bc (X\u00c0Xmin\n)/(Xmax\n\u00c0X) is\nlognormally distributed. The variable Xmin\ncan be negative,\nbut the values predicted equal to or less than zero are\ncensored and all are treated as equal to zero. Note that the\nSB\nmodel can fit a continuum of distributions that connect\nthe normal to the two-parameter lognormal distribution,\nand must fit any data set equal to or better than either of\nthem.\nThe MLE method determines the distribution that has the\nmaximum probability of drawing a given observed data set\nas an independent random sample. Let the probability of\ndrawing a sample with value Y be p(Y) and the probability of\ndrawing a sample with a value equal or less than Y be F(Y),\nwhere F(Y) is the integral of p(Y) dY between 0 and Y. The\nlikelihood function L to be maximized is described by the\nrelationship,\nL \u00bc PF\u00f0Y\u00de Pp\u00f0Y\u00de \u00f04\u00de\nwhere PF(Y) represents the product function over all the\ntransformed MDL values, and Pp(Y) represents the product\nfunction over all values above the MDL. The MLE method\nwas applied to the Cn corrected NHANES-III data, and the\noptimal parameters are provided in Table 2.\nThe results are shown for the 11 of 12 analytes where the\nMLE procedure converged to a stable solution. The analyte\ncarbofuranphenol could not be modeled because there were\nonly 16 observations above the MDL, so our MLE\nprocedure would not converge. Table 3 provides a typical\nexample of the fit of the SB\nmodel using the chlorpyrifos\ndosage predicted from the TCPY data. Owing to the MDL\nvalues, an exact comparison of observations and predictions\nis not possible, except for the portion of the table where data\nare all above the MDL of TCPY of 1 mg/l, which here occurs\nat a frequency of 85%.\nDiscussion\nInterpretation of Data and Weighting Functions\nThe pesticide sample cohort does not represent a probability\nsample because the subjects were volunteers from the original\nrandom sample. Consequently, they do not constitute a true\nrandom sample from the NHANES-III random sample, and\ntheir original sampling weights strictly do not apply to these\ndata. However, there are conditions which might allow a\nnonweighted analysis of their data to have some validity. In\nmathematical terms, let each ith subject in the sample of size n\nhave a weighting function wi, and a measured parameter yi.\nThe mean value (Y) would be computed as Y \u00bc Swi yi/Swi.\nIf the correlation between wi and yi is zero, then the expected\nvalue of the weighted mean of {yi} would be equal to the\nnonweighted mean\nY \u00bc \u00f0Syi\u00de=n:\nPesticide exposure by creatinine correction\nMage et al.\nWe have analyzed the correlations of sample weights (wi)\nwith urinary concentrations (yi) for all 12 analytes, in sets of\nresidue data that were above their respective MDL. Only two\nof the 12 analytes had correlations significantly different from\nzero, 1-naphthol and 2,5-dichlorophenol, which had values\nr \u00bc 0.13 and r \u00bc \u00c00.13, respectively. Since the corrections for\nthese low correlations are of order r2, or 2% to their\ncalculated means and distributional values, we chose to treat\nall 12 analyte values without making the weighting correc-\ntions, as that would provide negligible error in comparison to\nall other uncertainties in these data and in our analysis.\nThe subjects' choice whether to volunteer or not was made\nwithout any knowledge of their exposure to the 12 target\nparent compounds under study. If their choice to participate\nwas not influenced by a demographic characteristic that was\ncorrelated with exposure to any of those parent pesticides,\nthen the sample might constitute a `pseudo random sample'.\nFor example, if males were more exposed more than females\nand only males volunteered, then the sample would be biased\nto a greater percentage of higher values than would exist in\nthe entire population of males and females. In our analyses,\nthere was no significant difference between the demographic\ncharacteristics of the subjects voluntarily providing urine\nsamples and the subjects in the complete NHANES-III\ncohort. We therefore make the assumption that the choice to\nvolunteer a urine sample for pesticide analysis was made\nindependently of any consideration related to their likelihood\nof being exposed to the parent pesticides, or any other\ndemographic characteristics correlated with their pesticide\nexposures.\nTable 3.

This RfD is for direct ingestion of 24-DCP.\nbMedian \u00bcloge\n\u00adxmin\n)/(xmax\nis the positive predicted 50th percentile value of the distribution. When the median term is a fraction its\nlogarithm is negative.\ncIf all 1-NAP is from carbaryl.

If all 4-NP were from methyl parathion then 2.4% would be above its RfD of 0.25 mg/kg/day.\nPesticide exposure by creatinine correction Mage et al.\nWith such correlations not withstanding, we can interpret\nthe distributions as approximating the distribution of\npesticide exposures of people in the US, aged 20\u00ad59 years\nduring the years of sampling. Table 2 shows that two\nthe 99.9th percentile that are greater (transformed) than the\nRfD for lindane, their most likely parent compound. 24DCP\nis higher at the 99th percentile than its own dietary RfD of\n3 mg/kg/day. It is not a human metabolite of 2,4-D, but it can\nChlorpyrifos has a predicted frequency of 0.02% above the\nRfD. When interpreting these data, relative to their RfD for\nthe various parent compounds or on their own, the\ndistribution of values we hypothesize may be equal to or\nless in frequency for the exposures shown, due to the\npossibility of a person's exposure to the pesticide's metabolite\nrather than to the parent pesticide, as is the case for TCPY\nand chlorpyrifos (Wilson et al., 2003) and the possibility that\nthe metabolite is also derived from other parent compounds.\nHowever, for those analytes for which there are no data\navailable on fecal excretion, these values could underestimate\nthe intake dosage if urinary excretion was less than 100% for\nthe analyte. Of the analytes shown in Table 1, we have found\nhuman data showing less than 100% urinary excretion only\nfor 3,5,6-TCPY. Given that the RfD is a calculated daily\nexposure value for which no human health effect is expected,\nwe conclude that, based on this one biomonitoring sample,\nmost subjects were not exposed to the target pesticides at a\nrate leading to a public health concern.\nRecommendation for Future Work\nWe recommend that in future biological monitoring of\nurinary pesticide residues and metabolites, when possible, it is\nbest to collect a total 24-h void and to record knowledge of\nthe subject's body weight so that the mg equivalents/kg/day\nof a subject's average daily intake of parent pesticide can be\nestimated directly. This would eliminate the uncertainty\ninherent in the creatinine correction we have used. If a total\n24-h urine collection is not possible because of a high rate of\nsubject refusal or logistical problems, then the total void\nvolume of the spot sample should be recorded along with the\ntime from the previous void. We propose that the technique\nwe have developed be utilized for comparing such exposures\ndeveloped from urinary concentration data to regulatory\nestimates of exposures based on exposure models.\nSummary and conclusion\nWe have reviewed the literature on the usage of urinary Cn\nexcretion to normalize measurements of urinary pesticide\nresidues, and have shown how an individual's physiologic\ndata (age, gender, height, weight) can be used to estimate\ntheir daily Cn excretion rate to transform their pesticide/\nmetabolite data into individual estimates of daily pesticide\nurinary excretion rate. Assuming equilibrium (molar intake\nrate of parent \u00bcmolar excretion rate of analyte), our results\nshow that the vast majority of the sample from the adult\nmay not have been exposed to the 12 target pesticides at a\nrate above the RfD. Our analysis assumes that the 978 adult\nsubjects sampled represent the general public that does not\napply pesticides occupationally and does not receive suffi-\nciently high pesticide exposures that reach the transport\nmaximum for the corresponding analytes which would call\ninto question our Cn correction procedure. Only two of the\nsubjects whose estimated dose exceeded an RfD had current\noccupations in the area of ``Agricultural services, forestry and\nfishing'' and their previous occupations were as `construction\nlaborer' and `mover of freight, stock and materials by hand'.\nWe have used the Johnson SB\nmodel to predict the\ndistribution of ingestion dose rates of the imputed parent\ncompound for each metabolite or residue and compared\nthem to their respective RfDs. We recommend that such a\nprocedure be considered in future studies of urinary pesticide\nanalyte concentrations to provide an individualistic estima-\ntion procedure to be applied to each subject in the study.\n"
