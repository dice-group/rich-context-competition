Acra\n Keywords: neighborhood; depression; Blacks; African Americans; gender; ethnicity\n1. Introduction\nMajor depressive disorder (MDD) is a pressing public health issue [1]. As the most common\npsychiatric disorder, MDD is the leading cause of disability and a significant contributor to the burden\nof disease both in the U.S. and globally [2]. About 10% of the population in the United States meets\nthe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria for MDD;\nhowever, its prevalence differs by race, ethnicity, gender, and age group [3\u00ad5]. Although MDD may\nbe less common among Blacks [4\u00ad6], depression tends to be more chronic, severe, and disabling in\nBlacks [4,7]. As a result, regardless of the presence of clinical MDD, Blacks have more severe depressive\nsymptoms than Whites [8,9].\nAdolescence is a key stage of a child's life with major implications for human development [10,11].\nThis is also true for Black youth who are exposed to a wide range of additional economic and social risk\nfactors (e.g., poverty, poor school quality, poor neighborhood, etc.) that can contribute to behavioral\nand emotional problems such as MDD [12\u00ad15]. From a wide range of social risk factors, recent research\nhas documented the unique role of neighborhood disorder on physical and mental health of Blacks,\nparticularly, Black youth [12,16,17]. Most of this research, however, has measured depressive symptoms\nrather than MDD (i.e., the gold standard outcome) [18\u00ad20]. In addition, most of this research has used\na local sample [18,20,21] providing non-generalizable findings. Finally, we still do not now know\nif ethnicity and gender alter psychosocial determinants of mental health among Black youth. Thus,\nthere is a need for studying the role living in stressful conditions such as unsafe neighborhood has on\nthe risk of MDD among an ethnically diverse nationally representative sample of Black youth [22].\nIt is during the adolescence that youth strive to achieve independence [23,24] and get more\ninvolved with a social life [25], and Black youth are not exceptions to this rule [26]. In addition\nto the age related normative developmental challenges that are universal across all ethnic groups,\nBlack youth--who disproportionately live in economically and socially disadvantaged urban\ncontexts--experience additional risk factors that impose them to specific stressors that may increase\ntheir risk of MDD [18,20,26]. Although Black youth perceive stressors in other life domains\n(daily life, finances, and racial discrimination) as well, neighborhood stress due to unsafe environments\nand the fear of violence are a major risk factor for depression and depressive symptoms among male\nFor Black youth who live in the inner cities, neighborhood fear is a significant risk factor for\nand physical well-being of Black youth. Black youth who live in low-income neighborhoods are more\nlikely to witness shootings, stabbings, and killings in their neighborhoods compared to their White\nand middle to upper income peers [26,35]. Among Black youth, males are more frequently victims of\nEven in the absence of direct exposure to violence, living in unsafe neighborhoods endangers\nthe youth development, as fear of violence in the neighborhood is a risk factor that increases risk\nof undesired health outcomes [38\u00ad40]. Studies among adolescents [38] and adults [40] living in\neconomically and socially disadvantaged neighborhoods suggest that perception of neighborhood\ndisorder predicts a wide range of poor health outcomes including depression [19]. Blacks and\nparticularly African Americans are more likely to live in low-income communities where structural\ninequities increase the propensity for social disorder, crime, and violence, which all place them at an\nincreased vulnerability for the onset of MDD or depressive symptomology [40,41].\nFear of violence has unique implications for the mental health and well-being of African American\nyouth during the transition to adulthood [42,43]. Developmentally, youth are expected to establish\nfriendship bonds and focus on education which is important for their future success. In addition to the\nreality of limited resources and constrained opportunities [43,44], the perception of a neighborhood as\nunsafe and having fear of violence may increase hopelessness and decrease future orientation among\nBlack youth [45]. In unsafe neighborhoods, survival becomes the number one priority [35,46].\nInformed by a socio-ecological model of development [47] as well as intersectionality\nframework [48\u00ad50], the present study investigated the association between neighborhood safety\nand MDD in a nationally representative ethnically diverse community sample of Black youth [51\u00ad53].\nIn addition, we explored gender, ethnicity, and gender by ethnic differences in the association between\nneighborhood safety and MDD among Black youth.\n2. Materials and Methods\nFor this cross-sectional study, we used data from the National Survey of American Life -\nBlack youth in the U.S. history [51\u00ad53]. The study received funding from the National Institute of\nMental Health (NIMH), as a part of the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys (CPES) series.\nThe NSAL (including NSAL-A component) was approved by the Institute Review Board of\nfrom youths' legal guardians. Assent was obtained from the youth themselves. Participants received\nfinancial compensation for their time ($50). Parental informed consent and assent were obtained\nfrom all adolescent participants included in the study. All procedures performed in studies involving\nhuman participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national\nresearch committee and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable\nethical standards.\n2.2. Participants and Sampling\nThe NSAL-A included 1170 Black adolescents. This number was composed of 810 African\nAmerican and 360 Caribbean Black youth between 13 and 17 years who were residing in the United\nStates at the time of study. More details on the NSAL sampling are available elsewhere [52,53].\nWhile African American youth were residents of either large cities or other urban and rural\nareas, Caribbean Black youth were limited to the large cities. The NSAL used a national\nhousehold probability sample of Blacks. All African American and Caribbean Black households\nparticipating in the NSAL-Adult survey were screened for eligible adolescents who lived in the\nhousehold. Adolescents were then randomly selected from the provided list. When more than\none eligible adolescent was living in the household, two adolescents were selected based on the\ngender of the first selected adolescent. As a result, the NSAL-A sample was non-independent.\nAs a result, the data were weighted to adjust for non-independence in selection probabilities within the\nhouseholds, as well as non-response rates at the households and individual levels. The weighted data\nwere then post-stratified to represent the national estimates based on gender and age among African\nAmerican and Caribbean Black youth [54,55].\nFrom all the interviews, 82% were conducted face to face, in their homes, and the remaining\n18% were conducted either entirely or partially by telephone. To conduct the face-to-face in-person\ninterviews, computer-assisted personal interviews (CAPIs) were used to enhance quality of the data.\nCAPI, an interviewing technique in which the respondent uses a computer to answer the questions, is\nthe preferred method of interview when the questionnaire is long and complex. All the interviews\nwere performed in English, and each interview lasted on average 100 minutes. The overall response\nThe study included demographic factors including age, gender, and ethnicity. Clinical depression\n(MDD) was measured using World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview\n(CIDI) [56,57], while neighborhood safety was measured using self-reported data.\nEthnicity was measured according to the ethnic group of the parents who were living in the same\nhousehold. Parents self-identified as African American if they were Black and did not have ancestral\nties to any Caribbean countries. Parents identified as Caribbean Black if they were Black and they\nwere from any of the following Caribbean countries: (1) Cuba, (2) Dominican Republic, (3) Haiti,\n(4) The Bahamas, (5) Jamaica, (6) Trinidad and Tobago, (7) Dominica, (8) Saint Lucia, (9) Antigua\nand Barbuda, (10) Barbados, (11) Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, (12) Grenada, or (13) Saint Kitts\nand Nevis.\nLifetime and 12-month MDD was measured using a modified version of the CIDI. A fully\nstructured diagnostic interview schedule, the CIDI evaluates a wide range of Diagnostic and Statistical\nManual, 4th Edition (DSM-IV) mental disorders including but not limited to MDD. Originally\ndeveloped for the World Mental Health project initiated in 2000 [56], the CIDI is developed for\nuse by trained lay interviewers to generate diagnoses of lifetime and recent DSM-IV-TR/ International\nClassification of Diseases -10 (ICD-10) disorders [57]. Clinical reappraisal studies have documented\nacceptable psychometric properties such as good concordance of CIDI diagnoses with blinded clinical\ndiagnoses [56\u00ad60]. This measure provides valid findings for Blacks and their ethnic groups [61\u00ad66].\nThis measure also has acceptable function in youth [67\u00ad75].\nA short survey was used to measure perceived neighborhood safety. The stem question was\n\"How true is each of the following statements about your neighborhood?\" Items were: (1) \"I feel\nsafe being out alone in my neighborhood during the day\"; and (2) \"I feel safe being out alone in my\ntrue, and not at all true. We calculated a total score, ranging from two to eight, with a higher score\nindicative of unsafe neighborhood. Correlation between the two items was strong (r = 0.53).\n2.5. Statistical Analysis\nStata 13.0 (Stata Corp., College Station, TX, USA) was used to account for the survey design of the\nNASL-A. We used Taylor Series approximation technique to recalculate all the standard errors (SEs) that\nreflect design-based weights. Proportions reported in this study are all weighted and are representative\nof the U.S. population. While in the NSAL-A, the Caribbean Black sample is more clustered than the\nAfrican American sample, SEs are systematically larger for Caribbean Blacks than African Americans.\nAs a result, results are more conservative in Caribbean Blacks than African Americans.\nWe used survey logistic regression models to conduct multivariable analysis. In all our models,\nlifetime MDD was the main outcomes, perceived unsafe neighborhood was the predictor, and age,\ngender, and ethnicity were the control variables. Ethnicity and gender were also considered as the\nmoderators. In the first step, the association of interest was tested in the pooled sample, controlling for\nthe main effects of gender and ethnicity. In the next step, we ran models specific to ethnicity, gender,\nand their intersections. Adjusted odds ratio (OR), SEs, 95% confidence interval (CI), and p-values were\nreported. p-Values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.\n3. Results\nTable 1 provides descriptive statistics for demographic factors, neighborhood safety, and MDD in\nthe pooled sample. Mean age of the participants was 15 years old. Participants were almost equally\ncomposed of male and females. Table 1 also shows descriptive statistics for demographic factors,\nneighborhood safety, and MDD based on ethnicity and gender. Age was higher in Caribbean Blacks\nthan African Americans, and more females held the perception of their neighborhood being unsafe,\ncompared to males.\nTable 1.

Discussion\nTo summarize the findings, in the pooled sample of Black youth, those who perceived their\nneighborhood as unsafe were at a higher risk of MDD, net of covariates. Perception of neighborhood\nas unsafe was associated with higher risk of MDD among African American males but not African\nAmerican females or Caribbean Black males and females. These results offer new insights for policy\nmakers, public health experts, and clinicians who wish to promote the mental health of African\nAmerican males. These findings can be used to design and implement public policy, public health\nprograms, and clinical protocols in order to prevent MDD in African American males.\nAlthough neighborhood is a major social determinant of mental health [78\u00ad83], a growing body\nof evidence has documented heterogeneity of the neighborhood-health link based on race, ethnicity,\nand gender [12,17,20]. Using a local sample of Black youth, a recent longitudinal study showed similar\nresults. The study showed that an increase in perceived neighborhood fear predicts an increase in\ndepressive symptoms among male but not female African American youth [20].\nOur findings are in line with earlier studies examining the relationship between perceived threat\nand fear from neighborhood violence and crime and disorder and depression [19,20,38,40]. A sense\nof safety in the neighborhood is an important pre-requisite for maintaining well-being among Black\nyouth who are more likely to live in dangerous environments and perceive fear of crime and violence.\nThis is particularly the case for male African American youth who are at the highest risk for exposure\nGoldman-Mellor and colleagues used data from 4464 adolescent respondents from the California\nHealth Interview Survey (CHIS 2011\u00ad2014) and found that adolescents who perceived their\nneighborhood to be unsafe were at a higher risk of serious psychological distress (OR = 2.4).\nLiving in areas with higher levels of violent crime, however, did not predict mental distress.\nThese authors showed that adolescents' perception of neighborhood violence, rather than objective\nlevels of neighborhood crime, is a risk factor for poor mental health [84]. Curry et al. investigated\nhow neighborhoods with high levels of violent crime deteriorate mental health of residents through\nrisk of experiencing violence. Using data from current and former drug users (n = 786) nested in\n270 block groups within Baltimore, Maryland, they examined the relationships among block-group\nlevel crime, perceived neighborhood disorder, violence experienced in the neighborhood,\nand depression. Using path analysis, the study showed that neighborhood violence increases risk of\npsychological distress through perceptions of neighborhood disorder. They concluded that community\nand structural level interventions are needed to decrease neighborhood crime as well as improve\nresidents' sense of neighborhood safety [85]. We also found that perceiving neighborhood as unsafe is\nassociated with an increased risk of MDD.\nGender differences in the effects of stressors such as neighborhood and social disorder on MDD\nmay be due to a higher threshold of perceived risk among males [86] or role of gender roles [87] and\nmasculinity ideologies [88] that all have major implications for the effect of stress on depression [20,89].\nHigher thresholds of perceived risk among males suggest that it may be more severe when reported [86].\nThus, when a male reports a risk, it may have more consequences for his health. Similar trends have\nbeen reported for self-rated health (SRH), as poor SRH better reflects risk of death among males than\nfemales [13]. Another line of research that has shown similar findings is the link between stress and\ndepression. Although men generally report lower levels of stress, when they report it, it comes with a\nhigher vulnerability than females [90]. Similarly, discrimination has a stronger effect on mental health\nMales are socialized to look tough and fearless, and deny any vulnerability in the presence of\nstress, trauma, and social disorder [94]. This masculine mask increases the individual vulnerability to\nemotional problems when stress happens [88]. Male African American youth are not exempt from\nthis rule: neighborhood related stress puts them at risk of depression [18,20]. Adherence to masculine\nnorms is a major barrier for male African American youth to reach out and seek emotional support,\nwhen needed [95]. Living under chronic neighborhood stress, with a masculine mask, may jeopardize\ntheir mental well-being early in life. If left undiagnosed and untreated, MDD in adolescence increases\nrisk of emotional, behavioral, and social problems across a wide range of domains later in life [96].\nThis is particularly important given low access and trust and high stigma that delays health care\nutilization for psychiatric disorders in African American males [97].\nWe found that the neighborhood\u00adMDD link differs by the intersection of gender and ethnicity.\nGroups based on gender, race, ethnicity, and their intersections have specific paths to their well-being\nand health [98\u00ad109]. This is also known as differential vulnerability or differential effect hypothesis,\nsuggesting that pathways and mechanisms that play a role in maintaining health and disease are\nspecific to population subgroups that live in different contexts, and have different values, cultures,\nAfrican American males experience a unique set of social and economic challenges and adversities\nin their life, starting from childhood and adolescence, continuing in their adulthood, and extending\nuntil older age. Some of these unique challenges include low socioeconomic status, education in low\nresource schools, police brutality, unjust opportunities for employment, unemployment, differential\npay, discrimination, and racism [18,112]. These structural, political, and historical inequalities affect\nAfrican American youths' lives, particularly males [113,114]. Many of these high-level structural\ndeterminants are stressful and contribute to health problems (e.g., MDD) for African American males\nInvestments to prevent neighborhood crime and violence are essential if we wish to protect\nAfrican American males against MDD. This finding has major public health implications as\nBlacks particularly African American males have very low rates for utilizing formal mental health\nservices [116], and interventions that try to increase their professional health care have not been very\nsuccessful [117]. In a nationally representative community sample of Blacks, most (55%) of the African\nAmericans who had MDD had not received any treatment for depression during their lifetime [4].\nWilliams et al. showed that more African Americans with lifetime MDD have recent diagnosis of MDD,\nwhich was indicative of higher chronicity of MDD for Blacks [4]. In another study, among those who\nhad MDD, African Americans suffered higher burden of depressive symptoms than Whites, a pattern\nwhich is attributed to higher chronicity, more severity, and poor health care use [9]. African Americans\nless frequently accept medications and prefer non-pharmacological treatments of depression such as\nPolicies and programs that boost the sense of neighborhood safety of residents may have\nimplications for mental health promotion of male African American youth. More community mental\nhealth practitioners are needed to screen for MDD among youth in the neighborhoods with poor social\nelements that may trigger risk of MDD among African American males. It should be noted that actual\nlevels of crime may not predict depression risk [76,84]. Our findings advocate for the promotion of a\nsense of safety, which is different from crime rates.\nClinical practice that focuses on screening, diagnosis, treatment, as well as prevention of MDD in\nBlack youth should be aware of the within-Black heterogeneity in the social determinants of MDD.\nAfrican American males who live in unsafe neighborhoods are particularly at a high risk of MDD and\nneed to be screened.\nThe study sheds additional light about how and when social and environmental factors contribute\nto development of MDD among Black youth, and how diversity of this group alters their vulnerability\nto the same risk factor. This finding offers higher level interventions at the state levels that promote\nsafety as a strategy to promote male African American youth in general, and prevent MDD in particular.\nOur study had at least five major limitations. First major limitation is the cross-sectional design\nof the study, which precludes a causative interpretation of our findings. Thus, we cannot rule\nout \"selection bias,\" i.e., youth with \"poor\" health may gravitate toward \"poor\" neighborhoods.\nReverse causation is also a possibility, as poor health may operate as a barrier for upward social\nmobility and moving out of a bad neighborhood. Second, the study is subject to measurement bias\nand misclassification of neighborhood safety, as we did not use a previously validated measure\nfor neighborhood safety. In our study, the main predictor variable was based on only two survey\nitems, thus the results should be interpreted with caution. Our measure was purely subjective,\nand future research should also use objective variables (neighborhood crime, poverty, resources,\nethnic composition, etc.). Third limitation was that our study was limited to individual level data.\nPrior research has shown that violence at the neighborhood level reduce perception of safety at\nan individual level [81,122]. More research is needed to better understand how groups differ\nin the mediational path from neighborhood level factors that follow a geographic distribution to\nneighborhood fear to mental distress. There is also a need to study how place alters these links, as an\nadolescent living in an inner-city ghetto may have a different threshold for perception of neighborhood\nrisk and fear compared to another youth living in a low crime suburb. Forth, current study did not\ninclude socioeconomic factors such as family income or family structure. We also did not have data\non the duration of residence in the neighborhood. Finally, the sample size was not balanced in our\ngender by ethnicity groups, and standard errors are larger for Caribbean Black youth, which has\nimplications for interpretation of the findings across groups with different sample size. Although the\nassociation did not reach significance level, we found a trend toward an association between perceived\nsafety and MDD among Caribbean Black youth. Although the p-value was not statistically significant,\nthe magnitude of the association is virtually identical to that among African Americans. Thus,\nthe results should be interpreted with caution.\nDespite above limitations, the nationally representative sample and large sample size of Black\nyouth were major strengths of this study. Thus, the results are generalizable to all Black youth residing\nin the United States. However, there is still a need to future longitudinal studies that may establish a\ncausal link between the exposure and the outcome.\nTo conclude, there is a link between perceived neighborhood safety and depression among Black\nyouth, however, this association is not uniform across all their sub-groups. Perception of neighborhood\nas unsafe is associated with an increased risk of MDD in African American males but not African\nAmerican females or Caribbean Black males or females.\n"
