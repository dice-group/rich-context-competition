Second, I analyze how targeting, mainstreaming, and market-based initiatives all fail both to distinguish\nempirical from analytical gender and to incorporate environment and gender into development policy and action--despite\ntheir key role in meeting the normative goal of poverty reduction. Third, through a political-ecology lens, I suggest an\nintegrated approach to poverty, inequality, and socioenvironmental challenges that arise at the intersections of development,\ngender, and environment, and for that, I draw examples from research on social and environmental change and action in\nsub-Saharan Africa.\n",

There are several reasons why one should study it, the\nmain being that--despite real accomplishments--poverty\nreduction efforts in the past have been \"too few, too slow,\nand inept\" (Agola & Awange, 2013). Furthermore, people\nwho are poor often depend on environmental resources for\ntheir survival and, while many users are women, few control\nthe resources on which they depend, as partly, but not solely,\nexplained by existing gender regimes (D. Rocheleau,\nAs a major historical project, development is criticized for\nnot having delivered what it promised in terms of economic\ngrowth, political freedom, poverty reduction, and social\nchange (Isbister, 2006). Repeatedly, feminists have criticized\ndevelopment for its insufficient analysis of women, gender,\nand intersectionality (Elson, 2009) and for dichotomizing\nwomen into either marginalized and vulnerable victims or\nagents of change (Razavi, 2012), representing an \"untapped\nresource\" for development (Moser, 2012). Although efforts to\nengender theory and policy gave rise to \"gender and devel-\nopment\" as an institutionalized field, it has been, and still is,\na contested subdiscipline (Bener\u00eda, 1995; Cornwall, Harrison,\n& Whitehead, 2007). At present, in times of global environ-\nmental change, development is criticized for its incapacity to\nredefine development beyond conventional economic growth\nand for not taking environmental degradation and ecological\nlimits seriously enough (Olsson et al., 2014; Stiglitz, Sen, &\nFitoussi, 2009). Hopes are, therefore, high that climate change\nresponses informed by sustainability will embody institu-\ntional, structural, or transformational opportunities to reduce\npoverty and turn vulnerability into well-being--no longer\nshould poverty be addressed only as a core element of devel-\nopment but also, or more so, as a persistent social problem\nintertwined with global inequality and environmental change.\nThe current analysis draws on scholarly work that is pur-\nposively sampled with the dual ambition in mind.

All three are particularly relevant to pov-\nerty and inequality but are rarely brought together under joint\nscrutiny, although that is called for and becoming more fre-\nquent in critical geography (Sultana, 2014), feminist political\net al., 2013), and gender and sustainability debates (Cruz-\nTorres & McElwee, 2012; Meinzen-Dick, Kovarik, &\nQuisumbing, 2014). In search of synergies, I situate the anal-\nysis within the scope of political ecology serving as an over-\nall lens to examine how the three selected discourses have\nalready, and may further, converge on poverty reduction\nstrategies while taking global-to-local inequality and sustain-\nability seriously. As a critical problem-solving approach with\npolicy implications for integrated social and biophysical\nphenomena, political ecology is shaped by several distinct\nfeatures such as multiple audiences, methods, objectives, and\nscales focusing on chains of explanations in local to global\nagency and structures (D. E. Rocheleau, 2008).\nThe text is outlined as follows. First, I offer a succinct\nintroduction to the main ideas of development as a major\nhistorical and international project. I include a short review\nof how poverty as a key issue is defined, understood, and\ntackled in development theory and practice. Second, and as\nanother key issue, I review how initiatives on \"women\" and\n\"gender\" were mainstreamed into development, and how\nwomen, gender, and the environment were first ignored or\nneglected but later became core categories in policies and\ninterventions on poverty reduction. Third, I turn to how envi-\nronmental concerns gained attention in the global debate,\nhow development and environment come together in theory\nand practice in ecological modernization, and how poverty\nreduction policies were later formulated in line with that,\noften with market-based instruments as a solution despite\ntheir limitations. Finally, I seek leverage between the dis-\ncourses and discuss how research can draw on integrated\napproaches as a way forward to invigorate strategies and\naction. For that, I offer a chart of empirical examples draw-\ning on sustainability science research in sub-Saharan Africa.\nAs a cautionary remark to the informed reader, I should\npoint out that by tracing debates over time and by placing the\ncurrent state of the subject matter into an historical frame, it\nbecomes clear that some aspects and arguments have not\nchanged considerably over the last decade or more. In particu-\nlar, it is worth mentioning that neither the grounding narrative\non gendered perceptions and experiences of poverty in the\nglobal South nor the methods for observing, documenting, or\nanalyzing such data from a gendered perspective have changed\nmuch. In the current analysis, that is a finding in itself.\nDevelopment and Poverty in Theory\nand Practice\nIn theory and practice, development is a problem-based, nor-\nmative, and solutions-oriented discourse (Pieterse, 2010).\nRooted in political ideology, it entails policies, strategies, and\ninterventions of every shade from Marxism to liberalism,\nfrom neo-Marxism to neoliberalism, from ecologism to fem-\ninism, to postdevelopment. It was long understood as devel-\nopmentalism--a process of social change that can be thought\nof, planned, and implemented as a top-down strategy of poli-\ncies and interventions. In the 1970s, this was paralleled or\nreplaced by participatory and people-oriented approaches\nemphasizing ownership and partnership (Brohman, 1996).\nAs a postwar project for poverty reduction and political\nindependence, development turned into an endeavor of\nnation-building and economic growth (Sumner & Tribe,\n2008). It gave rise to a huge institutional and organizational\napparatus of global initiatives, international agencies,\nnational authorities, and local organizations--all aiming for\na better future in the global South. In the quest for freedom\nand well-being, the development project attracted massive\nflows of capital and technology not only from the global\nNorth to the South but also between countries in the global\nSouth (J\u00f6nsson, Jerneck, & Arvidson, 2012). Furthermore,\nindustrialized countries in the North promoted nation-build-\ning in the South around the institutions of an open market\neconomy and multiparty democracy but with greater weight\nattached to the former on the basis that democracy would\nfollow from market-based economic growth. The newly\nindependent countries were, however, disadvantaged in their\neconomic transformation by having to compete in open mar-\nkets with the North and often having to take on significant\npublic debts for infrastructure-building and other projects;\nthis had the effect of perpetuating the adverse terms of trade\nand high levels of economic dependence on primary exports\nthat had been features also of the colonial period (Singer,\n1950). Ambitions to alleviate entrenched poverty were,\ntherefore, hard to fulfill (Isbister, 2006).\nPoverty Reduction in Development Discourses\nAs a widespread, persistent, and deeply rooted social and\nhistorical problem, poverty has been addressed, defined, and\ndebated for centuries (Ravallion, 2011). It has been bound up\nwith the development discourse since the very start, and its\nalleviation is often seen as an outcome of economic growth\n(Rist, 2002). However, in the literature, there is broad agree-\nment that poverty reduction also requires an effective state\n(Leftwich, 2005). Currently, poverty is generally understood\nin terms of multicausal origins, multidimensional features,\nand multiscalar effects (United Nations Development\nProgramme, 2010). This means that poverty is not only about\ndestitution or maldistribution of material and immaterial\nassets and resources but also about social exclusion, cultural\nmarginalization, and the process of being deprived of pros-\npects and opportunities.\nDefinitions of poverty are abundant and varied. Poverty\ncan be absolute or relative, individual or systemic, material\nor symbolic, objective or subjective, descriptive or explana-\ntory. It is not fixed in time or space and not easily captured in\na single dimension or definition. It shifts between seasons\nand settings; is temporary or transient over the life cycle of a\nperson, family, or community; and varies across gendered\nand generational boundaries within the same household\n(J\u00f6nsson et al., 2012). Although often presented as a mone-\ntary or social proxy measured in access to education, health\nfacilities, and other services (Intergovernmental Panel on\nClimate Change, 2014), it is also a multifaceted lived experi-\nence involving individual, cognitive, and emotional experi-\nences (Olsson & Jerneck, 2010). Beyond that, poverty is\nrelational and systemic, ranging from agency to structure and\nfrom changes in individual practices to altered institutional\narrangements. Successful poverty reduction efforts thus\ninvolve complex politics necessitating economic, political,\nand social initiatives and interventions, as we will see below.\nThe understanding of poverty reduction and of how it\ndepends on economic growth and (fair) distribution has var-\nied historically and theoretically across the boundaries of\ncompeting development schools and ideologies (Hulme,\nmodernization theory advocated international economic\nintegration and predicted broad-based economic conver-\ngence. According to projections, economic growth would\ndeliver poverty reduction and rising living standards to close\nthe gaps between North and South, rich and poor, urban and\nrural, men and women. Proponents of modernization theory\nbelieved that economic growth would \"trickle down\" from\nNorth to South--via trade, technology transfer, and other\ntransactions--and spread widely in societies in the South.\nAfter the economic crisis in 2009, the effectiveness of the\nmechanism was finally refuted (Quiggin, 2009) but before\nthat, it was already highly contested by critics (some of\nwhom are feminist) who observed how inequality is rooted\nin class, race, gender, and space (Agarwal, 1986) and in\nremaining colonial structures (Brohman, 1995).\nIn parallel, and in contrast to modernization theory, struc-\nturalist researchers calculated how international trade\nresulted in divergence and thus advocated protectionism and\nthe promotion of massive private and public investments in\nstate-directed industrialization to \"catch up\" with technolog-\nical change, economic growth, and rising living standards in\nthe West (Singer, 1950). Scholars of dependency theory went\neven further, proposing a radical reorientation and \"delink-\ning\" from the prosperous Center (North) to reduce further\nexploitation of the \"underdeveloped\" Periphery (South),\nwhich had already for centuries been deeply penetrated and\ntransformed. While liberal thinkers considered trade to be a\nsuperior means to integrate the South further into the world\nmarket and thus reduce poverty through convergence,\nKeynesian scholars stressed that aid and assistance are cru-\ncial to bring about growth and social change. In opposition,\npostcolonial thinkers shifted the focus not only from aid ver-\nsus trade but away from poverty altogether to critically scru-\ntinize the power of the dominant Western discourse for its\n\"colonization of the mind.\" And while human rights\u00adbased\napproaches called for the recognition of rights and concrete\noutcomes to overcome local to global injustice and inequal-\nity, postdevelopment scholars went even further to think\nbeyond the development project altogether.\nEconomic divergence continued to increase despite new\npolicy frames, forceful development strategies, and mas-\nsive investments in extractive industries. The international\ncommunity and many national governments, therefore, had\nto intensify their fight against poverty. This was done by\nfocusing directly on \"the poor\" in initiatives that still\nassumed convergence but were designed to promote par-\nticipatory pro-poor growth processes. As examples of the\nmajor top-down or bottom-up international efforts, the\nUnited Nations launched a program in 1974 for establish-\ning a New International Economic Order (United Nations,\n(ILO) designed a Basic Needs Approach in 1976 (ILO,\nment thinker Robert Chambers suggested a participatory\nmethod for rapid rural appraisals to be used both in research\nand in policy initiatives for rural poverty alleviation and\nagricultural development (Chambers, 1981). His method\ngave prominence to what people have and do, thus shifting\nthe focus from human incapacity to human assets and activ-\nities. Later on, it developed into the agency-based sustain-\nable livelihoods framework (Chambers & Conway, 1991).\nAlso neoliberalism as the emerging world order advocated\nspecial policies for \"pro-poor growth\" but as often con-\nfirmed in development practice, the \"poorest of the poor\"\nare difficult to attract, reach, and involve in targeted efforts\ndue to their marginalized position in the economy and in\nsociety at large (Jerneck & Olsson, 2010; Olsson et al.,\nIndicators and Imagery of Poverty\nThe many above-mentioned efforts and initiatives to speed\nup poverty reduction are associated with different attempts to\nassess and measure poverty and inequality. In the 1990s,\nAmartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum suggested a Human\nDevelopment Index (HDI) and a Gender Development Index\n(GDI) as composite indicators for the Human Development\nReports published by the United Nations (Nussbaum, Sen, &\npronged bottom-up approach to promote socioeconomic\nopportunities and facilitate empowerment while enhancing\nsecurity for the sake of poverty reduction (World Bank, 2000).\nIn parallel, the World Bank initiated the project, Voices of the\nPoor, to map and explain drivers of poverty as experienced\nby and heard from 60,000 people in the global South (Narayan,\nChambers, Shah, & Petesch, 2000). This was also the time of\nthe global partnership of the Millennium Development Goals\nmissed the opportunity to fully integrate human rights and\nenvironmental concerns into poverty reduction strategies,\n4 SAGE Open\nefforts are strengthened in the succeeding Sustainable\nDevelopment Goals (Biermann et al., 2014).\nAs particular indicators, quantitative aspects are seen as\nuseful to compare the magnitude of poverty over time and\nbetween countries, whereas qualitative aspects are needed to\nidentify causal mechanisms and how poverty is experienced\nin various settings (J\u00f6nsson et al., 2012). To compare poverty\nlines and purchasing power parity across borders, some\nscholars and practitioners prefer universal indicators\nexpressed in what they see as objective figures and fre-\nquency. To explain recurring periods of hardship and recov-\nery in the everyday life of those who are under pressure from\nmultiple stressors, others engage with stakeholders and use\nqualitative methods to map, depict, and discuss daily, sea-\nsonal, or annual predicaments (Gabrielsson, Brogaard, &\nthat often arise from a combined food, health, and gender\nimperative (Gabrielsson et al., 2013; Jerneck & Olsson,\n2013). Hence, aggregation in numbers is necessary to com-\npare the incidence of poverty over time and across borders\nwhereas disaggregation is needed to locate poverty dynamics\nat individual, household, or community levels and for under-\nstanding causes and consequences (Hulme & Shepherd,\nAs reflected in the many varied approaches that policy\nmakers and practitioners draw on in their design of poverty\nreduction strategies, the imagery of \"poverty and the poor\"\nas expressed in definitions, in metaphors, and in myriad\nsocial relations to richer worlds has changed over time and\narguably varies at any one time (Dogra & Cohen, 2012) but\nthere are constants, too. To sum up thus far, while some look\nfor a monetary proxy or a single index of welfare, others seek\npathways to expand capabilities, entitlements, and freedom\n(Sen, 2013), and others, again, call for antidiscrimination\npolicies to fight exclusionary dynamics in society (Laderchi,\nSaith, & Stewart, 2003) such as racism and sexism.\nStrategies and Policy Approaches to Reduce\nPoverty\nStrategies for poverty alleviation can, for instance, be classi-\nfied into the four types of state-directed, market-based,\nsocial-movement-based, or status-quo-based approaches\n(Satterthwaite & Mitlin, 2014). To exemplify, state-directed\npolicies may include participatory governance, rights-based\ninitiatives, urban management, and welfare assistance.\nStatus-quo-based interventions may draw on existing infor-\nmal institutions such as \"aided self-help\" or clientelism that\nbuild on protection and exploitation, thus offering only lim-\nited and rather conditional benefits (Satterthwaite & Mitlin,\nApproaches to measure and compare poverty over time\ncan be classified into four types: monetary, capability, par-\nticipatory, and social exclusion, each of which draws on a\nparticular construction of reality with its own particular limi-\ntations (Laderchi et al., 2003). The monetary approach is eas-\nily turned into numbers but is one-dimensional and may\nconceal other aspects. The capability approach is agency-\nbased and captures multiple dimensions but is difficult to\naggregate because it builds on individual and personal rather\nthan collective experiences (Rist, 2002). Participatory\napproaches are place-based and grounded but use context\nspecific indicators that may prevent comparisons between\nsettings (Laderchi et al., 2003).The social exclusion approach\ncaptures multiple dimensions of social inequality but refers\nmainly to excluded groups and segments in society such as\nthe aged, the disabled, ethnic minorities, and so on, thus tak-\ning a too narrow view. As yet another aspect of poverty, there\nis call for critical urban research and action as policy tends to\nunderestimate the growing magnitude and impact of urban\nAradical shift away from existing approaches would be to\nfocus less on poverty and people who are poor and more on\nwealth and riches (Lister, 2004).The latest Intergovernmental\nPanel on Climate Change (IPPC) assessment report has wid-\nened the social science scope and seeks to investigate and\nillustrate inequality in more depth (Olsson et al., 2014).\nPolicies emerging from such research would require struc-\ntural and institutional changes toward a fairer distribution of\npublic goods and services and a more equal provisioning of\neducation, health care, water, and environmentally sound\nand safe energy and sanitation (Laderchi et al., 2003). But\nthis is at odds with neoliberalism as the dominant paradigm\nof our time and would demand a repoliticization of poverty\n(B\u00e9n\u00e9, Wood, Newsham, & Davies, 2012) rather than the\ncurrent trend to simplify and depoliticize it (Barrett &\nWomen (Not Gender) at the Core of\nPoverty Reduction Policy\nIn response to persistent poverty and inequalities, gender-\nsensitive and people-centered approaches moved to the core\nresearch on equality and in an effort to promote women's\nopportunities and well-being, a network of Washington-\nbased development professionals and practitioners coined\nthe term WID--\"women in development\" (Tinker, 1990, p.\n30). Embedded in modernization theory and rooted in liberal\nfeminism and neoclassical economics, it suggested a focal\nshift from reproductive to productive work (Wilson, 2011).\nIn line with development policies on economic efficiency\nand equity in opportunities, the WID norm supported \"small-\nscale income-generating women-only projects\" more than it\ncriticized existing inequalities between women and men\n(Krook & True, 2012). Due to the prime focus on \"women\"\nas an empirical category and based on a simplified under-\nstanding of gender, the structural inequality between women/\nmen and the discursive meaning of femininity/masculinity\nwere made invisible and lost in the WID initiative. In retro-\nspect, it has been pointed out that WID, intentionally or unin-\ntentionally, stimulated the efficiency norm and approach to\n\"invest in women\" and in women's production, reproduc-\ntion, and motherhood for the benefit of general social gains\nsuch as improved child health, higher levels of food security,\nand increasing well-being. In consequence, women ended up\nserving development more than development served women.\nLater, the efficiency approach to women's agency and wom-\nen's capacity to work gained prominence as \"smart econom-\nics,\" which has since then been propagated by several\ninternational organizations (Chant & Sweetman, 2012).\nWomen as Agents of Change\ncrisis and the widespread structural adjustment programs\npromoted by the World Bank and the International Monetary\nFund (IMF) in tandem, cuts in government spending in many\ndeveloping countries resulted in tight household budgets\nespecially in the urban context (Rapley, 1997). To alleviate\neconomic difficulties, the strategy of conditional cash trans-\nfer (CCT) was launched as a public policy to fight poverty\nand social exclusion (Rawlings & Rubio, 2005). It offers\nopportunities for women as a targeted group but builds on\nmaternalist gender stereotypes of women working in the ser-\nvice of others, mainly their children and families, in a form\nof \"female altruism\" (Molyneux, 2006). Hence, women were\ncast as agents of change responsible not only for the better-\nment of themselves and the survival of their families but also\nfor the recovery of the economy (Chant & Sweetman, 2012).\nSimilarly, the widespread but controversial system of micro-\nfinance (Hulme, 2000) targets women on the assumption that\nthey use money wisely and ultimately pay back loans. But\nantipoverty strategies offering land rights and labor market\nopportunities to women are both fairer and more effective\nthan micro-credit loans that are often controlled by men\nwhile signed in the name of women, who thus become\nresponsible for paying back the loans (Balasubramanian,\n2013). Some critics even suggest that micro-credits should\nProductive and Reproductive Work\nAccess to income-generating resources and livelihood\nopportunities is governed by social relations manifested\nthrough institutions, organizations, and decision-making\npower, and is often found to be at the core of poverty allevia-\ntion (De Haan & Zoomers, 2005). But as often noted in the\ndevelopment literature, women have multiple reproductive\nresponsibilities besides their productive tasks and \"every\ndawn brings with it a long march in search of fuel, fodder and\nproductive and reproductive responsibilities and obligations,\nwomen often depend on and have the capacity to manage\nenergy needs and natural resources while having neither the\nright to nor control over these same resources (Ryan, 2014).\nIn many fishing, farming, or forestry communities, this is\nillustrated by how women participate in, contribute to, and\narrange production activities while having less (secure)\naccess not only to natural resources, in terms of land, but also\nto social resources such as capital, education, and informa-\ntion (Cruz-Torres & McElwee, 2012). However, the dual\nresponsibility of having to tend to both reproductive and pro-\nductive activities may, in fact, enhance women's bargaining\npower as well as their capacity to meet not only basic needs\nin the family but also their own strategic needs (Kabeer,\nTargeting Women or Mainstreaming Gender\nFeminists and other critical thinkers have examined how\ndevelopment and poverty reduction are associated with par-\nticular notions or chains of notions tying one term to another,\nsuch as \"women and work\" (Jackson, 1996); agency, effi-\nciency, and entrepreneurship (Wilson, 2011); and participa-\ntion and empowerment (Cornwall & Brock, 2005; O'Meally,\n2014). Many have noted that while some programs \"target\"\nthe poor specifically (as a group) others \"mainstream\" pov-\nerty and gender (as social relations) into development poli-\ncies. Both perspectives are problematic. Targeting means\nportraying and addressing people who are poor (often\nwomen) as victims and/or beneficiaries whereas gender\nmainstreaming often means seeing women (but rarely men)\nas agents not only contributing to but also being responsible\nfor the survival and well-being of their families, communi-\nties, and whole economy. For a long time, investments in\ngenerations of women as mothers, community builders, and\n\"agents of well-being\" have run as a common thread through\ndevelopment initiatives. By linking the domestic to the pub-\nlic sphere, while separating the domains in intricate ways,\nwomen are made liable for the well-being of others (Tabbush,\n2010), and work burdens are reinforced (Blackden & Wodon,\nInstrumental or Intrinsic Value\nCritiques have also argued that \"positive\" representations of\nwomen as entrepreneurs and educators of their children are\nassociated with a notion of agency that is both consistent\nwith and necessary for neoliberal capitalism (Wilson, 2011,\np. 328). But if poverty is a classed and gendered experience,\nthen policies to reduce poverty \"are not necessarily appropri-\nate to tackling gender issues\"--especially if poverty reduc-\ntion is prioritized while gender discrimination, oppression,\nthe first World Development Report ever to focus on gender\nrecognized that besides its instrumental value for economic\ngrowth and poverty reduction, as discussed above in terms of\n6 SAGE Open\nwomen as agents of development, gender equality has intrin-\nsic value as \"a core goal in and of itself\" (World Bank, 2011,\np. 3). Critical perspectives would prioritize the intrinsic\nvalue of strengthening women (and men) in their own right,\nbut warn against initiatives based on the instrumental value\nof making women into a means to control fertility (to stabi-\nlize population growth) while reducing poverty and achiev-\nTo sum up thus far, the focus in poverty reduction policies\nand strategies has shifted over time from specific develop-\nment aspects--basic needs, gender equality, rural develop-\nment--to more diffuse (neo)liberal notions such as \"equity\nin opportunities\" (World Bank, 2005) only to drift back again\nto specific aspects such as education, human security, public\nhealth, and reproductive rights. Policies have varied from\nincluding and targeting \"women\" to \"mainstreaming gender\"\nwhile becoming increasingly diffuse in goal and means, and\nfrom prioritizing the efficiency gained from the instrumental\nvalue of women's contributions to underlining the intrinsic\nvalue of gender equality.\nFrom Counting to Critical Reflexivity--From\nEmpirical to Analytical Gender\nIn relation to policy, it is a long-standing feminist argument\nthat gender is not adequately conceptualized or represented\nin decision-making arenas (Kettel, 1996). This is unfortunate\ngiven the fact that the feminist lens on development has\nshifted from \"women in\" or \"gender and\" to the \"gendering\nof\" social relations. This methodological turn from individ-\nual to relational helped identify how economic, political, and\nsocial institutions contribute to reproduce and reinforce gen-\nder regimes and practices. In development policy and prac-\ntice, there are, in principle, four broad approaches for how to\naddress gender, each of which has its own particular focus,\nissues, and methods. Accordingly, gender studies have\nchanged from measuring variables to seeing gender as a fun-\ndamental analytical category and as part of higher order pro-\ncesses in society. With that, gender has shifted from studies\nof patriarchy and subordination toward studies of complex\nsocial institutions, practices, and structures that span the\npublic\u00adprivate divide. In addition, gender is often found to\nbe dynamic and continuously negotiated in processes that are\nembedded in norms and values influenced by diffuse and\nwidely dispersed power (Kenny, 2007). Four typical\napproaches can be distinguished here: counting women and\nmen, analyzing gender as social relations, explaining identity\nand diversity beyond gender and into intersectionality, and\nreflexive questioning of knowledge production (Reed &\nFirst, and to illustrate this further, the counting approach\nincludes individuals (women and men), gendered activities,\nand gendered contributions from that. Although it challenges\ngender-neutral categories, it may overstate women's uniform\nconditions and only suggest corrections to existing practices\nrather than promoting profound (and necessary) structural\nchange in social norms (Marchand & Parpart, 2003). The\nsecond approach, which analyzes gender as a relational con-\nstruct, includes the study of social norms and the dynamics\nof gendered regimes while focusing on how institutions are\nnumerically and culturally dominated by men and male\nnorms. This approach seeks to explain gendered differences\nand inequalities in power but not necessarily how gender and\nother social dimensions intersect to create asymmetric and\never more complex power relations.\nThe third approach recognizes that gender intersects with\nother social categories, thus being diversely experienced and\ngoing beyond essentialism. This approach is, however, less\nable to seek unity across diverse interests or to offer general\nstatements that may serve policy making. The fourth\napproach stresses partiality, subjectivity, and reflexivity and\nis concerned with feminist critique of epistemologies. It\ndeals with questions such as what counts as knowledge and\nhow is knowledge legitimized, produced, and represented?\nThe challenge here is to recognize fluidity in identity and\nsubject formation while seeking to make claims that are pre-\ncise enough to be policy relevant. Importantly, and to sum\nup, the meaning of gender, also in the context of develop-\nment, must be understood along at least two different lines--\nthe empirical meaning referring to the categories of women\nand men and how they are differently affected by or affect\nsocial change, and the analytical meaning referring to the\ndimensions of femininity and masculinity in how power is\nproduced in social relations and in language (Peterson,\n2005). To consider both is an attempt to avoid simplification\nand deepen the understanding--but also the complexity--of\ngender.\nRecoding Gender in the Quest for Development\nAs regards flexibility in how to interpret and reinterpret gen-\nder, culturally contingent norms are often contested, chal-\nlenged, or changed in times of major technological\ntransformation or social upheaval such as agrarian reform or\nrevolution, economic boom or crisis, war or postconflict\nrecovery, natural disaster or climate change events. Asia and\nAfrica exhibit interesting and well-known historical exam-\nples of such events and processes characterized by fluidity in\ngender. In socialist China, women would \"do everything that\nmen could do\" in productive labor during the intensive polit-\nrapidly industrializing and modernizing postwar Japan,\nmany women left the domestic sphere to enter the labor mar-\nket in the economic boom of the 1960s. In conflict ridden\nVietnam, women gained higher administrative and political\npositions when men were mobilized in war in the 1960s; and\nin postconflict Rwanda, women won every second parlia-\nmentary seat based on the new 2003 Constitution.\nThese major transformative gains may be unintended and\nunexpected and also fragile and short-lived.After an \"event,\"\nthings may soon revert to \"normal.\" In Japan, many women\nreturned to the domestic sphere when the economic boom\nslowed down into a recession in the 1990s; in Vietnam,\nwomen lost their prominent positions at the end of the war in\n1975 when men demobilized and reentered the administra-\ntion; and women who were active in the social movement of\nthe Arab spring in 2011 lost their seats in the reform commit-\ntees set up after the revolution (Hassan, 2012). The position\nof women (and men) in the economy and society is thus rein-\nterpreted over time often in line with the dominant discourse.\nKabeer (2011) argues that although empowerment processes\nare path dependent, there is scope for people's ability, capac-\nity, and willingness in a given setting or situation to adapt to,\nreact against, or alter the social constraints and gendered\nnorms to which they are subject. Kabeer (2011) speaks of\nwomen's ability to participate on equal terms with men in\nreshaping society, women's capacity to exercise strategic\ncontrol over one's life, and women's willingness to question\none's position in society. As a gender-sensitive typology that\nmay serve to deepen the analysis on such power in social\nrelations, it covers four varieties: \"power to,\" meaning the\nability to adapt, improve, or transform; \"power with,\" involv-\ning a joint action with other people; \"power over,\" in the\nsense of challenging and overcoming subjugation; and\n\"power within,\" as an individual cognitive process of confi-\ndence and consciousness (De Haan & Zoomers, 2005).\n\"Involving women while ignoring gender.\"Ester Boserup\n(1970), an early proponent of gender equality in develop-\nment, argues that women should be (better) integrated into\nthe economy to reap (more) benefits from modernization.\nAgainst this, radical feminist scholars argued that women\nwere already integrated in the economy as seen in their con-\ntribution to production and reproduction (Bener\u00eda & Sen,\n1981), often to the extent that their labor was exploited in\nlow-paid wage work and through time-consuming gendered\nobligations in reproduction--thus a heavy workload and lit-\nerally a double burden. It was argued that interventions seek-\ning to involve women often ignore gender, thus seriously\noverlooking the role of men and masculinity in the economy\nand society. This is exemplified by how women who enter\npublic positions and productive work often remain in charge\nof reproductive work as these are more resistant to change or\nrecoding (Resurreccion, 2011). In consequence, the many\nconcerns around women's workloads, \"care loads,\" and time\npoverty have gradually been gender mainstreamed into\ndevelopment thinking and practice (Blackden & Wodon,\n2006) but often with a focus on what women do rather than\non what men could do to contribute to productive and repro-\nductive work.\nTo sum up, we have seen how the notions of \"women\"\nand \"gender\" emerged and were used interchangeably or\neven ambiguously in development initiatives. We will now\nturn to how the gendering of social and natural resources in\nthe environment debate started to be incorporated into the\ndevelopment discourse, first with an emphasis on women\nand then shifting the emphasis to gender (Jackson, 1998;\nStarting to Identify the Dynamics:\nDevelopment, Gender, and\nEnvironment\nIn the gender literature, it is argued that vulnerability (and\nadaptive capacity) in relation to natural disasters is neither a\nfixed nor an intrinsic characteristic of certain people or\ngroups of people (Enarson, 1998) or derived from a single\nsocial dimension like being poor, rural, woman, or part of a\nparticular (or marginalized) community (Blaikie et al., 1997).\nIf vulnerability is associated with differentiated and chang-\ning circumstances before, during, and after a disaster (Blaikie\net al., 1997) and depends on historically or culturally deter-\nmined conditions (Enarson, 1998), then it is less of an indi-\nvidual or personalized characteristic and more of a structural,\nrelational, and process-oriented condition. The capacity of\nwomen and men to reduce their respective vulnerability may\ndepend significantly on gender norms and rules that define\nand regulate the use of space and other resources, including\nthe power and control associated with that; but when estab-\nlished norms clash with emerging needs in households that\nare poor, vulnerable, or exposed to multiple stressors, this\nmay create space for negotiation of and fluidity in gender\n\"Being Close to Nature\"--In Ecofeminism and\nWED (Women, Environment, Development)\nIn the development and environment debate, especially\nwithin ecofeminism and WED, it has often been argued that\n\"women are closer to nature, are hardest hit by environmen-\ntal degradation, and have special knowledge of natural\nresource systems\" (Resurrecci\u00f3n, 2013, p. 33). From this fol-\nlows that women run the potential risk that development\ninterventions will pass the burden of conservation on to them\nas main caretakers, protectors, or even saviors of natural\nresources and the environment (Resurrecci\u00f3n, 2013). But\necofeminist notions seeing women as per definition naturally\nconnected to nature or having special skills and knowledge\nto manage environmental resources (Shiva, 1988) have been\ncriticized by feminist scholars, some of which feel an \"intel-\nlectual unease\" with the idea of a single \"feminine subject\"\nwho is \"close to nature\" (Resurrecci\u00f3n, 2013, p. 33). In con-\ntrast, critics see identity and subjectivity as fluid, fragmented,\nmultidimensional, and constituted of age, class, race, place,\nand other axes of power rather than as fixed, centered, and\none-dimensional (Elmhirst & Resurreccion, 2008). A better\nunderstanding of agency could emerge from an intersectional\n8 SAGE Open\nanalysis of natural resource management and environmental\nrecovery, and such studies of flexibility in gender in relation\nto nature are now seen in the literature on forestry and water\nmanagement (Leach, 2007). Here, \"situated knowledge\" and\n\"social reproduction\" are useful concepts to help reveal how\nspatial locations shape everyday activities and practices and\nhow that relates to what people know about the environment\nand how they respond to environmental stressors (Bee,\nMadge, & Wellens, 1998). Social inequality in resource man-\nagement and climate change responses may not only be rein-\nforced but, thus, also contested and changed when social\nmeanings of identity are played out and power is performed\n(Nightingale, 2009). In the following, I will examine how\ndevelopment engages with debates on environment and sus-\ntainability and how ecology and economy get intertwined in\ninitiatives on poverty reduction.\nThe Rise of Ecological Modernization\nThe coevolution of development and environmental con-\ncerns can be summarized in three important waves (Mol,\ndegradation and pollution of natural landscapes seeing nature\nconservation as the main policy response. In the 1970s, the\nsecond wave was manifested in the UN Conference on the\nHuman Environment in Stockholm (in 1972). This made it\nobvious that environment and development could no longer\nbe treated separately but had to be addressed simultaneously.\nIn parallel, a more radical and socially informed wave made\na plea for an ecologically sound society but achieved very\nlittle in terms of institutional change. In the 1980s, the third\nand most influential wave coincided with the publishing of\nthe politically commissioned report Our Common Future\n(World Commission on Environment and Development,\n1987) wherein ecology and economy were integrated into a\ncommon frame that later became known as ecological mod-\nernization (J\u00e4nicke, 2008). Its main assumption, that eco-\nnomic growth can solve both poverty and environmental\ndegradation, was epitomized by the UN Conference on\nEnvironment and Development in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in\npoverty reduction with environmental conservation, espe-\ncially in the local context. This reflects how environmental\nconcerns were mainstreamed into modernization theory as\nthe dominant development theory.\nEven if meanings differ among and between scholars,\nfour main traits are important to ecological modernization.\nFirst, modern science and technology is important for ecolo-\ngizing the economy. Second, it is argued that since there is no\ninherent conflict between the economy and the environment,\nwe should harness market instruments for sustainable devel-\nopment by internalizing externalities in a commodity\napproach--economizing ecology. Third, the state should enter\npublic\u00adprivate partnerships and become proactive in mobiliz-\ning private actors to take initiatives toward sustainability such\nas in strategies on corporate social responsibility. Fourth,\nsocial movements will have to change from primarily being\nwatchdogs to become active participants in and agents of\nEcological modernization as theory and practice emerged\nin tandem with the neoliberal ideology and the match\nbetween them paved the way for liberal environmentalism or\n\"green neoliberalism\" (Bakker, 2010). In the context of\ndevelopment, this is illustrated by the outcome of the Rio+20\nconference reiterating the need to promote initiatives on sus-\ntainable development that \"contribute to eradicating poverty\nas well as sustained economic growth . . . while maintaining\nthe healthy functioning of the Earth's ecosystems\" (United\nNations, 2012, Section III, para. 56). Concretely, this think-\ning is evident in how the World Bank shifted from imposing\nstructural adjustment programs and austerity in the 1980s to\npromote a green economy in the 1990s--defined as a clean,\nresource-efficient, and resilient economy (Hallegatte, Heal,\nFay, & Treguer, 2012). The change in World Bank policy was\nseen as necessary, efficient, and affordable (Fay, 2012) and\nas of late, it is taken further toward equity goals by becoming\n\"inclusive green growth\" (Fay, 2012). Dominant interna-\ntional players thus have the power to set the agenda by main-\nstreaming ideas on development, fairness, and the\nenvironment and pair it with a matching vocabulary with\npolitical implications such as \"green growth,\" \"equity in\nopportunities,\" \"inclusive green growth,\" or \"resilience\"\n(Olsson, Jerneck, Thoren, Persson, & O'Byrne, 2015).\nEcology and Economics Coming Together\nThe evolution of the concept of ecosystem services may\nexemplify how scientific thinking about the environment and\ndevelopment is affected by neoliberalism. In the late 1970s,\nthe concept was launched to increase the public awareness of\nbiodiversity conservation. In the 1980s, it was mainstreamed\ninto the environmental policy literature and operationalized\nby the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (Reid et al., 2005)\nto subsequently be implemented as Payment for Ecosystem\nServices (PES) in the 2000s (G\u00f3mez-Baggethun, De Groot,\nLomas, & Montes, 2010). Many ecologists uncritically\nembraced the integration of ecosystem services into a neolib-\neral agenda that promoted market-based instruments (Daily\nAnd, to be noted here, environmental protection and poverty\nstrategies now shifted from state to market, implying a major\nchange in authority and institutional arrangements from state\nregulation to market-oriented solutions justified by the long-\nterm need to tackle poverty and foster development (Ten\nBrink, 2011). Similarly, the concept of social-ecological sys-\ntems (SESs) emerged in response to the need to improve\nmanagement and governance of degrading ecosystems\n(Berkes, Colding, & Folke, 2003). Here, the stress on self-\norganization and resilience provided a smooth link to the\nneoliberal idea of free markets (Walker & Cooper, 2011).\nSpeaking of resilience, the concept generally refers to how\nsystems manage, persist, or even thrive in a world of unfore-\nseeable socioecological events or disruptions, and as such, it\nhas gained prominence while also being subject to severe\ncritique for not being an effective analytical tool to capture or\naddress the dynamics of poverty (B\u00e9n\u00e9 et al., 2012).\nCombining Development and Environment in\nMarket-Based Instruments\nPES is a paradigmatic image of how environmental manage-\nment and poverty reduction can be promoted in the global\nneoliberal economy. It is a voluntary transaction wherein a\nwell-defined environmental service or a land-use activity\nlikely to secure that service is bought by one or several ser-\nvice buyers from one or several service providers, if, and\nonly if, the service providers secure service provision\n(Wunder, Engel, & Pagiola, 2008). Inspired by a large-scale\nscheme in Costa Rica, Pago por Servicios Ambientales, PES\nreceived much attention as a market-based instrument for\nefficiency and effectiveness in environmental management\nin developing countries (Pagiola, 2008). Besides, it is often\nassumed that PES can contribute to reduce poverty even if it\nwas not primarily designed for that (Pagiola, Arcenas, &\nPlatais, 2004) and even if empirical evidence is lacking\nWhile environmental sciences seem enthusiastic about\nthe prospects of combining social and environmental bene-\nfits (Wunder, 2005), development scholars are cautious\n(Daw, Brown, Rosendo, & Pomeroy, 2011) or outright nega-\ntive in that they see PES as neocolonial resource appropria-\ntion or \"green grabbing\" (Fairhead, Leach, & Scoones,\n2012). PES builds on globally dominant conceptions of envi-\nronmental justice that are not necessarily aligned with those\nof local stakeholders (Martin, Gross-Camp, Kebede,\nMcGuire, & Munyarukaza, 2014), and although PES primar-\nily has an environmental rather than a social focus (Wunder,\n2008), its socioeconomic effectiveness is influenced not only\nby ecological conditions but also by social relations (Adhikari\nThe potential of PES to reduce poverty is heterogeneous\nand always context-dependent (Adhikari & Boag, 2013).\nThe chances to achieve the dual policy goal of poverty alle-\nviation and environmental protection, by using PES in inte-\ngrated approaches, depend on the coincidence of at least\nthree interrelated spatial and social conditions: people who\nare poor must have access to ecosystems with a potential to\ndeliver high-value ecosystem services, opportunity costs in\ndelivering these services must be low, and the scope to intro-\nduce perverse incentives in the PES scheme must be lim-\nited--for example, in shifting environmental stress from the\nareas covered by the PES scheme to areas that are not cov-\nered, in the sense of saving one forest while cutting down\nanother, that is, the notion of leakage (Allwood, Bosetti,\nDubash, G\u00f3mez-Echeverri, & von Stechow, 2014). It is pos-\nsible that these eligibility criteria will limit the potential\neffectiveness of PES schemes. In addition, empirical evi-\ndence from Brazil indicates that law enforcement is more\neffective to reduce deforestation than market-based initia-\ntives (Arima, Barreto, Ara\u00fajo, & Soares-Filho, 2014; Gibbs\nof yet, there seems to be little gender differentiated evidence.\nIn addition, power asymmetries in access to natural resources\nand services may contribute to reproduce existing inequali-\nregards gender and PES, there is need for more research on\nhow gender regimes matter in the context of access to,\ndependence on, and use of land and labor as socioecological\nresources.\nFrom a gender perspective, and as pointed out by Baruah\n(2015), green growth policies will have to consider that\nwomen generally have weaker access to new technologies\nand more often are poorly represented in construction, infra-\nstructure, and renewable energy. For a green economy to be\nequitable and vibrant, it will have to avoid curtailing the\naccess to public commons and instead involve people who\nare poor and engaged in the informal economy or otherwise\ndisenfranchised in society (Tandon, 2012). Doing so, it will\nhave to consider their perils and priorities in how they depend\non and use resources (Tandon, 2012). For this to happen, and\nto be sustained, it is not enough to facilitate entry into a green\neconomy, it is also necessary to back the entry up by wider\nand socially progressive policies including access to public\nservices in general.\nContrasting Arguments\nIn times of both economic and ecological crises (Jessop,\n2012), polarization is increasing between two competing dis-\ncourses that both claim sustainability with poverty reduction.\nThe dominant discourse of ecological modernization, led by\nthe United Nations and the World Bank, reiterates the need\nfor sustainable development by \"promoting sustained, inclu-\nsive and equitable economic growth\" (United Nations, 2012,\nArticle 4) as echoed by the World Bank promoting \"green\ngrowth\" (Dercon, 2012). In reaction, a growing critical\nscholarly debate, inspired by ideas from Marx and Polanyi,\nargues for counterbalancing forces that operate against the\nincreasing reliance on markets in environmental governance\n(Arsel & B\u00fcscher, 2012). Likewise, the critical concepts of\npostdevelopment and degrowth are gaining traction both in\nacademia (Kallis, 2011) and as a source of social movements\n(Demaria, Schneider, Sekulova, & Martinez-Alier, 2013).\nThe highly divisive debate on food regimes may serve to\nillustrate this polarization between mainstream depoliticized\npleas for technology driven food security (Godfray et al.,\n2010) versus politically transformative peasant movements\nto achieve sovereignty (Holt-Gim\u00e9nez & Altieri, 2013).\nConclusion\nThe aim of the article was to identify and compare approaches\nand policies to poverty eradication in three different but inter-\nlinked debates--development, gender, and environment--and\nto investigate the continuity and change in arguments over\ntime while also looking for synergies across debates. The anal-\nysis makes it clear that although foci and visions may shift\nover time, certain aspects and institutions remain constant. To\nexemplify, framings of women and gender in the poverty alle-\nviation and development debate are reproduced throughout\nthe environmental debate despite repeated critique from femi-\nnist, political ecology, and other critical perspectives.\nSumming Up the Argument\nThree major processes have influenced development theory\nand practice over time, the radicalization in the late 1960s,\nthe gendering of development in the 1970s, and the greening\nof development in the 1980s. At the time of the economic\ncrisis in the 1980s, there was a conservative pendulum swing,\nand neoclassical economics resurged to fit into the emerging\nneoliberal ideology that has dominated ever since. Owing to\ncompeting perspectives on the core development issues of\neconomic growth, poverty reduction, and social change,\nmany concepts have been contested, revisited, and reconsid-\nered while some remain over time. From the discussion, I\nsum up three main points on poverty, gender, and environ-\nment, and how they come together in poverty reduction in\nthe development field.\nFirst, on poverty, knowledge expanded over time from\ngrowth-oriented and monetary-based approaches to multidi-\nmensional perspectives emphasizing how human develop-\nment is gained in processes of capacitation, participation,\nempowerment, and distribution of rights. The necessity to\nexpand definitions on poverty beyond economic aspects is\nwidely recognized in the debates on development and gen-\nder. The importance of (and controversies around) the many\nvaried processes involved in poverty reduction strategies\nsuch as capacitation, empowerment, and participation--and\nhow they involve gender--is also recognized. Despite this\nbroader view, poverty reduction policies are still often\nexpressed in narrow monetary and measurable terms empha-\nsizing economic growth, quantitative indicators, and specific\ntargeting of marginalized groups.\nSecond, on women and gender, knowledge has changed\nfrom counting women, observing women's practices, and mea-\nsuring women's work to theorizing how social relations, insti-\ntutions, and practices are gendered at all scales from everyday\nlife to higher order processes in society. Despite a broader view,\npoverty reduction policies are (again) often directed or targeted\nat women as vulnerable victims of poverty, ill-health, conflict,\nand disaster or as resourceful agents providing for their fami-\nlies, communities, and beyond. What is lost in that analysis is\nnot only the scrutiny of men and masculinity in development\nbut also how processes of power, dispossession, and depriva-\ntion intersect with other major processes in society of great\nimportance for social change.\nAs regards women, gender, and environment, the focus on\nwomen's work and the weight of dual or triple workloads is\nnow also expressed in relation to populations exposed to\nglobal environmental change and disasters. This reflects (and\nrepeats) how development policy has interchangeably spo-\nken of women as a targeted group of either victims and ben-\neficiaries or agents of social change (or both) rather than of\ngender as fundamental to social relations of diversity and\ninequality and thus in need of further critical scrutiny\n(Sultana, 2014). This is partly explained by the fact that\nmainstreaming ends up diluting or distorting the radical edge\nof new initiatives as seen when the emphasis on gendered\nresponsibilities (rather than rights) is continuously repro-\nduced and reinforced not only in the development discourse\nbut lately also in response to climate change.\nThird, on environment, knowledge has evolved from doc-\numented observations of pollution, environmental degrada-\ntion, and overuse of natural resources to a deeper\nunderstanding of the need to reverse these processes through\nconservation, preservation, restrictions, and regulations while\nalso considering mitigation of and adaptation to climate\nchange. Environment has become subject to processes of mar-\nketization and the use of market-based instruments (such as\nPES), which are problematic for several reasons. Not only is\nthe pricing and the setting of discount rates on nature includ-\ning the atmosphere and the oceans a complex process, it is also\na way to exclude social groups who have poor access to mar-\nkets or who are deprived of rights to resources. In response to\nclimate change as well as to environmental degradation and\npollution, there is scope for synergies between poverty reduc-\ntion and environmental concerns but not necessarily via com-\nmodification of nature because it may imply an excessive\nfocus on market forces in poverty reduction policies. Many\npeople who are poor depend for their living on natural\nresources and the environment while often being disfavored\nby markets (Jerneck & Olsson, 2014; Olsson & Jerneck,\n2010). Even if markets can liberate some, they neglect others\nsuch as the chronic poor who need access to social support and\nsocial change (Hulme & Shepherd, 2003), implying a wide\nrange of public services constituting both the basis of and the\nframe within which market incentives may play a role--but\nnot the only role. Given these conditions, market-based instru-\nments in the context of climate change and environment--\nClean Development Mechanism (CDM), Reducing emissions\nfrom deforestation and forest degradation(REDD+), schemes\nfor voluntary carbon markets, and so on--are clearly problem-\natic tools in poverty reduction (Olsson et al., 2014).\nIllustrating Potential Social Change\nCollective action or community-based initiatives are not always\nsufficient or necessary measures, and, in some instances, they\nare even contested, but under certain conditions they can be\nan alternative to conventional development interventions.\nCollective action informed by gender has often shown to be\neffective--especially when people who have lower capacity\nto accumulate resources and/or limited physical mobility due\nto gendered reproductive tasks are motivated to develop and\nenhance their social capital by building and nurturing local-\nized networks (Agarwal, 2000). If gender-sensitive initia-\ntives and environmental innovation are included, then\nsynergies with development may emerge.\nIn the context of small-scale agriculture in sub-Saharan\nAfrica--characterized by the food imperative, the health\nimperative, and the gender imperative--recent research in\nsustainability science has identified and analyzed such\nshared initiatives and action, be it in collective efforts to\njointly pool and use human urine as a valuable resource to\nimprove soil infertility (Andersson, 2015), in local organiza-\ntion in communities of practice where mainly women farm-\ners get together to start saving funds and income-generating\nactivities in agriculture and agroforestry (Andersson &\npreneurial initiatives aiming at water harvesting (Gabrielsson\n& Ramasar, 2013). Facilitation skills are important in such\nresearch but \"having the right attitude and the enthusiasm to\nmobilise the local community\" (Kar & Pasteur, 2005, p. 2) is\nfound to be the most crucial aspect.\nIn summary, such research gives prominence to two con-\nditions that are necessary to enable successful social change\nwith environmental benefits in the context of poverty and\nmultiple stressors: the existence of local and tangible bene-\nfits from development initiatives and interventions (Jerneck\n& Olsson, 2013) and the presence of entrepreneurially ori-\nented individuals who can act as catalysts for collective\naction and social change (Jerneck & Olsson, 2014). Table 1\nbuilds on research in sustainability science and represents a\ntypology of mobilization mechanisms for social change\nwhere the two above-mentioned conditions helped pave the\nway for transformation. The first column provides five\nexamples of social change initiated through a certain kind of\nmobilization mechanism, indicated in the second column,\nwhich in turn generated both direct local benefits and further\ncobenefits, as seen in the third and fourth columns.\nPointing at Ways Forward\nWhat are the ways forward when unequal power relations are\nembedded and inscribed in land, water, and other natural\nresources (Bryant, 1998) and gender regimes influence\naccess to and use of natural resources (Agarwal, 2003;\nSultana, 2014)? One option is to use a political-ecology lens\nallowing a feminist epistemology and a global-to-local per-\nspective (D. Rocheleau et al., 2013). That may provide an\nintegrated focus on how socioecological challenges, in\nsmall-scale farming, create multiple interacting stressors for\npeople who are poor and depend on the environment for their\nPolitical ecology directs attention not only to the persistent\nsocial problems of poverty, dispossession, and unequal\nresource distribution but also to the politics of environmental\ndegradation, social justice, and the neoliberalization of\nnature (Elmhirst, 2011). In addition, feminist political ecol-\nogy goes beyond targeting and mainstreaming to consider\nthe gendering of decision-making processes in relation to\nresource use, land titling, and tenure arrangements, and do so\nwith social, spatial, temporal, and (thus) intersectional\nDevelopment theories and practices are not only gendered\nbut also intertwined with other social and socioecological\nTable 1.

As a dynamic theory\nemerging from feminist research, intersectionality may spark\nfurther inquiry into poverty and riches in relation to the gov-\nernance of global environmental change and poverty reduc-\ntion (Kaijser & Kronsell, 2014). It uses deconstructive moves\nto uncover and analyze multiple intersections of power and\ninequality in social relations while challenging the notion of\nsameness (as in \"the poor\" and \"women\") and the notion of\ndifference as often used in \"developed\" versus \"developing\ncountries\" or in \"women versus men\" (Cho, Crenshaw, &\nMcCall, 2013). As a heuristic, its methods can be used to\nincrease knowledge and understandings of how power works\nthrough time and space--via norms, scales, and structures--\nto create overlaps and intersections between identity catego-\nries such as age, class, ethnicity, gender, place, race, and sex.\nIt may reveal not only how legal, political, spatial, or other\ntypes of inequality or discrimination are shaped and repro-\nduced but also how social and environmental justice can be\npromoted in fair and gender-sensitive global environmental\ngovernance. Given that policy intervention often goes\nbeyond geographical and sectorial borders to spread quickly\nthroughout a globalized world (Weaver, 2014), intersection-\nality could serve as an important critical lens.\nConcluding Remark\nThe world and its problems extend across disciplinary bound-\naries and have to be understood beyond disciplinary perspec-\ntives. The development field including all its varied aspects,\nconcepts, tools, and visions is explicitly interdisciplinary and a\nclear example of how competing ideologies, theories, and prac-\ntices coexist within the same and inescapably political dis-\ncourse (Leftwich, 2005). Theory and action on development,\ngender, and environment share not only the same aspiration of\nprofound social change but also the many continuously con-\ntested political means and objectives of transformation\n(Cornwall et al., 2007).Acritical scrutiny of how development,\ngender, and environment are intertwined in poverty reduction\nefforts, and how inequality is a matter of politics rather than of\neconomics and culture only, may thus contribute a better under-\nstanding of the dynamics of policy making and allow fairer\ngovernance and outcomes of human\u00adnature interactions.\n"
