SATHCAP employed respondent-driven sampling\n(RDS) and a dual high-risk group sampling approach that relied on peer recruitment for\na combined, overlapping sample of MSM and DU. The goal of the sampling approach\nwas to recruit an RDS sample of MSM, DU, and individuals who were both MSM and\nDU (MSM/DU), as well as a sample of sex partners of MSM, DU, and MSM/DU and\nsex partners of sex partners. The approach efficiently yielded a sample of 8,355\nparticipants, including sex partners, across all four sites. At the US sites--Los Angeles,\nChicago, and Raleigh\u00adDurham--the sample consisted of older (mean age=41 years),\nprimarily black MSM and DU (both injecting and non-injecting); in St. Petersburg, the\nsample consisted of primarily younger (mean age=28 years) MSM and DU (injecting).\nThe US sites recruited a large proportion of men who have sex with men and with\nwomen, an important group with high potential for establishing a generalized HIV\nepidemic involving women. The advantage of using the dual high-risk group approach\nand RDS was, for the most part, the large, efficiently recruited samples of MSM, DU,\nand MSM/DU. The disadvantages were a recruitment bias by race/ethnicity and income\nstatus (at the US sites) and under-enrollment of MSM samples because of short\nrecruitment chains (at the Russian site).\n",

Of particular concern is HIV transmission from\ntraditional higher risk groups, such as drug users (DU) and men who have sex with\nmen (MSM), to lower risk groups, such as non-drug-using sexual partners, through\nsexual intercourse. Sexual links between higher risk groups and lower risk groups\nare of special concern not only because they contribute to the spread of HIV but also\nbecause they could lead to a generalized epidemic.1 A growing body of literature\nsuggests that drug use may be influencing sexual behaviors that increase HIV\ntransmission,2\u00ad6 although little is known about the role of drug use in sexual\ntransmission from high- to lower risk groups. This paper describes the methods and\nsampling results of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Sexual Acquisition\nand Transmission of HIV Cooperative Agreement Program (SATHCAP), a multi-site\nstudy designed to assess the role of drugs in the sexual transmission of HIV among\nhigher risk groups and from high- to lower risk groups in the USA and Russia.\nUSA,7,8 and heterosexual sex is the mode of HIV exposure that has increased the\nmost rapidly.9 In 2005, 49% of all new cases in the USA were among men who\nreported having sex with another man, 17% were among men and women who\nreported injection drug use, and 32% were among men and women who reported\nheterosexual intercourse.8 Despite the relatively low and slow incidence of HIV\namong heterosexuals in the USA compared with that in many developing countries,\nthe significant ongoing sexual transmission of HIV among MSM and the recent\nincreases in cases among heterosexuals are a cause for concern. In 2006, an\nclassification using the BED assay showed that 31% of these infections were recent.\nThese data suggest that the number of new infections for the USA in 2006 was\nWhile the USA is seeing an increase in HIV transmission through sexual\nintercourse, the Russian Federation is experiencing a rapidly growing epidemic of\nHIV transmission primarily through injection drug use (IDU). In each of the past\nwhich were transmitted through injection drug use.11 However, there is growing\nevidence of increased heterosexual transmission 11 and of sexual transmission from\nIDU to non-IDU.12 The epidemic patterns are vastly different in the USA and Russia,\nbut they share common trajectories of HIV transmission from higher risk groups to\nlower risk groups such as non-drug users.\nNIDA's SATHCAP brought together researchers from the University of\nCalifornia, Los Angeles (UCLA); the University of Chicago at Illinois (UIC);\nResearch Triangle Institute International in Raleigh\u00adDurham (RTI), North Carolina;\nYale University, with the Biomedical Center (Yale/BMC) in St. Petersburg, Russia;\nand the RAND Corporation. The key research questions for SATHCAP were: (1) To\nwhat extent do HIV infections among DU and MSM populations spread to\nuninfected non-DU and non-MSM individuals through sexual activity? (2) What is\nthe role of drugs in this spread? (3) What individual, behavioral, network, and\nstructural characteristics determine the speed, extent, and path of this spread?\nTo answer these questions, SATHCAP conducted a cross-sectional study across\nfour sites using a consistent sampling method, a common questionnaire, and similar\nbiological testing. Each site used respondent-driven sampling (RDS) to recruit MSM\nand DU. Participants recruited MSM and DU using the RDS method and then\nrecruited their sexual partners. MSM and DU and their sexual partners reported\nindividual-level, partner-level, and event-level drug using and sexual risk behaviors\nand their determinants so that the rate, speed, and extent of sexual transmission to\nthe general population could be estimated. This paper provides background\ninformation on SATHCAP's research aims and describes the study's focus, its\ndesign, and the RDS sampling approach.\nBACKGROUND\nThe Role of Drugs in the Sexual Transmission of HIV\nSeveral recent studies have suggested that drugs--methamphetamine and crack\ncocaine in particular--are contributing to increased sexual risk behaviors and\nincreased HIV transmission in the USA and abroad. Among MSM in the USA,\nstudies have shown a consistent correlation between methamphetamine use and\nhigh-risk sexual behaviors13,14 and between methamphetamine use and HIV\nincidence.4,15 Increased risk of HIV through sexual transmission among both men\nand women in the USA also is associated with smoking crack cocaine.16\u00ad20 Crack\nsmokers demonstrate an even higher rate of risky sexual behavior than do cocaine\ninjectors.3 Related patterns are evident in places outside the USA. In Russia, where\nmethamphetamine-related drugs are the most common stimulant and injection\nheroin is the most common type of drug, studies suggest that unprotected\nheterosexual sex between IDU and non-IDU sexual partners may be contributing\nto the spread of HIV to the larger population.21 Evidence connecting stimulants to\nhigh-risk sexual behavior continues to mount, but little is currently known about the\nsocial epidemiology of the sexual transmission of HIV from higher risk groups, such\nas MSM and IDU, to lower risk groups, such as non-drug-using women and\nheterosexual men, and about the role of drugs in this process.\nThe Use of RDS to Recruit Two \"Hidden\" Populations\nTraditional Methods for Recruiting Hidden Populations \"Hidden\" populations are\nthose for which no sampling frame exists and for which there are usually privacy\nconcerns because of stigmatized or illicit behavior. In the context of HIV surveillance\nand behavioral research, both DU and MSM are considered hidden populations and\nthus are difficult to study.22,23 Many of these individuals, particularly those with no\nfixed address, are not easily reached through household surveys or venue-based\nsampling. Many do not present for health care until they become extremely ill.\nBecause traditional probability sampling can be quite costly and can often miss\nmany marginalized and hidden individuals, HIV researchers often rely on non-\nprobability methods to recruit hidden populations and to encourage study\nparticipation.24,25 Among the more common non-probability sampling methods\nare snowball sampling and other chain referral methods, targeted sampling, key\ninformant sampling, and venue-based sampling, as described by Magnani et al.24\nHowever, non-probability sampling methods contain biases of unknown magnitude\nRespondent-Driven Sampling Several recent studies have demonstrated that RDS\nRDS is a peer-driven chain referral method that relies on a structured system of\nrecruitment procedures and financial incentives to encourage recruitment and\nparticipation. RDS also employs post-stratification weighting procedures. Together,\nthese characteristics are thought to reduce biases typically associated with non-\nrandom recruitment.22,23,25 Whereas non-RDS methods likely oversample larger\npersonal networks, venue attendees, and DU with more visible street lives,35 RDS is\ndesigned to avoid, reduce, and control for this pitfall.\nRDS recruitment begins with a small number of non-randomly selected \"seeds.\"\nSeeds used in RDS generally are high-energy, well-connected members of a network.\nThe reason to select seeds with these characteristics is to jump-start the recruitment\nprocess and reduce bias by speeding the attainment of equilibrium.24,25 Seeds are\ngiven incentives for successful recruitment of people they know who qualify for the\nstudy.25 Recruitment then expands through multiple recruitment waves, with each\nwave's recruits becoming recruiters and receiving compensation for recruiting\neligible peers. In order to prevent oversampling from larger personal networks,\nRDS limits the number of individuals that may be recruited by a single recruiter, thus\nallowing for an increase in social distance between seeds, their recruits, and later\nwaves. Theoretically, RDS samples reach an \"equilibrium\" and stabilize after\nmultiple waves.22 Equilibrium in RDS refers to the point at which sample\ncharacteristics cease to fluctuate and, theoretically, approximate characteristics of\nparticipants' networks.25 An RDS sample is only self-weighting if two conditions are\nmet: (1) groups of analytic interest (such as males and females, HIV positives and\nnegatives, or racial/ethnic groups) have equivalent network sizes, and (2) groups\nrecruit with equal efficiency.36 Because these two conditions typically are not met,36\nthe overall sample composition frequently does not correspond to population\nestimates derived from the RDS method. In these cases, post-stratification weights\nare required to yield population estimates that control for these sources of bias. The\ntheoretical and mathematical foundations and procedures of RDS are described in\nDespite some noteworthy limitations, most studies conclude that RDS is an\nefficient (i.e., effectiveness and speed at recruiting target populations) way to recruit\nboth within and outside the USA. Most studies conclude that the demographics of\nsamples recruited through RDS reflect the general demographics of the IDU and DU\nin similar study locations, though some suggest that recruitment efficiency may vary\nby population density, availability of public transportation, and the ability to recruit\nproductive seeds. Other studies note that RDS samples may not be representative of\nRDS is Efficient in Recruiting IDU and DU In a pilot study in New York City\ndesigned to assess the effectiveness of RDS in recruiting IDU and DU, Abdul-Quadar\net al.24 enrolled 618 IDU and DU from eight seeds over a period of 13 weeks, with\n43% of the sample having injected in the previous 6 months, 19% having injected\nprior to the previous 6 months, and 38% never having injected drugs but having\nsniffed or smoked a drug. Robinson et al.,37 who conducted a pilot to compare the\neffectiveness of RDS and targeted sampling in three US cities, also found RDS to be\nefficient. In 8 weeks, they recruited 102 IDU from three seeds in Detroit, 48 IDU\nfrom one seed in Houston, and 118 IDU from two seeds in New Orleans. Wang et\nal.28 demonstrated that RDS can be effective for recruiting non-injecting DU,\nspecifically MDMA/ecstasy users and illicit stimulant users29 in non-metropolitan\nsettings in central Ohio. They were able to recruit 374 active MDMA/ecstasy users\nfrom 28 initial seeds and 249 stimulant users from 11 seeds. Recruitment was slow,\nhowever, and both of these studies reported a high number of unproductive seeds.\nGrau et al.38 efficiently recruited 237 opioid abusers in Cumberland County\n(Portland), Maine, in 10 weeks from 21 seeds. One seed yielded 17 waves of\nrecruitment and over half (120) of the study participants. However, recruitment was\nconcentrated in the inner city, and chains of recruits infrequently reached into the\nsuburban towns of Cumberland County. Stormer at al.27 found RDS to be an\nefficient way to recruit IDU in two cities in two different countries--Tirana, Albania\nand St. Petersburg, Russia--successfully recruiting 200 IDU from each site within\n8 weeks. In the same amount of time, Frost et al.26 recruited 200 IDUs from each of\ntwo border cities in Mexico--Ciudad Juarez and Tijuana.\nRDS is Efficient in Recruiting MSM Ramirez-Valles et al.30 demonstrated that RDS\nis an appropriate and efficient way to recruit a hidden population of gay, bisexual,\nand transgender (GBT) men in urban areas. Their study began with seven seeds in\nChicago and nine in San Francisco and reached a target sample of 100 GBT\nHispanic men at each site in 7 weeks in Chicago and 13 weeks in San Francisco.\nJohnston et al.31 also demonstrated that RDS can be effective in recruiting MSM.\nBeginning with eight seeds, they recruited 523 MSM in Dhaka, Bangladesh in\n11 weeks. In a study of circumcision status among MSM, Millet et al.32 used RDS to\nAngeles, and Philadelphia. Deiss et al.,34 reporting on the same study as Frost et al.26\nfound that 47% of all male IDU recruited in Tijuana and 13% of all male IDU\nrecruited in Ciudad Juarez were MSM/IDU, suggesting that RDS recruitment might\nbe effective in recruiting dual high-risk populations.\nAs with All Sampling Approaches, RDS Has Limitations Although RDS has several\nstrengths and may reflect estimated population compositions, as with all population-\nbased studies, it is not immune from sampling bias.26,29 Post-stratification weighting\nis proposed as a way to correct for sampling bias in RDS samples, but some\nresearchers suggest that it cannot fully account for bias introduced by non-random\nselection from personal networks.29,39 Frost et al.26 note that the post-stratification\nweighting process depends on subject reports of network size, and that despite the\nRDS method's assumption that respondents can accurately report their network\nsizes, there may be variations because of how questions about network size are\nasked. In addition, recall of social networks can be inaccurate and incomplete due to\nforgetting, and forgetting tends to increase as network size increases.40\u00ad42 Scott43\nsuggests potential methodological and ethical violations of RDS, but multiple\nresearchers criticize Scott's own methods44\u00ad46 and point out that violations\nsuggested by Scott are exaggerated and not unique to RDS sampling.44,45 Thus,\nwhile RDS is an efficient means of recruiting large samples of hidden populations,\ninaccuracies in estimates of network sizes may lead to biases. Limitations\nnotwithstanding, most studies conclude that RDS is an efficient and cost-effective\nway to recruit large hidden populations of IDU, DU, and MSM and suggest that\nRDS, in the right circumstances, may be a useful way to recruit samples that\nrepresent specific social networks and even the underlying hidden population from\nwhich the sample is drawn.\nRecruitment of the Dual High-Risk Group\nBecause of the reported effectiveness of RDS in recruiting IDU, DU, and MSM,\nSATHCAP employed the basic concepts and procedures of RDS in a new way,\ndesigned to simultaneously recruit a large, dual higher risk group composed of drug\nusers (injecting and non-injecting) and MSM, regardless of drug use, and then to\nrecruit sex partners of members of the dual higher risk group. Recruitment of\nnetworks of drug users, MSM, and their sex partners has been conducted in social\nnetwork studies using other methodologies,47,48 but no prior studies have used RDS\nto recruit a dual risk group and few, if any, have specifically targeted two relatively\nseparate risk groups, i.e., drug users (injecting or non-injecting) who may or may not\nbe MSM and MSM who may or may not be drug users and their male or female\nsexual partners. The goal was to form a large base of individuals at high risk for\nHIV whose interrelationships could be studied and to identify potential bridging sex\npartners who might transmit HIV beyond the dual higher risk group to those at\nlower risk.\nMETHODS\nStudy Design\nSATHCAP was a cross-sectional study conducted in two phases. For the three US\nbetween February 2007 and August 2008. The two phases were essentially identical\nexcept for slight changes to the recruitment scheme in phase 2 to adjust for under-\nrecruitment of sex partners in phase 1. Phase 1 respondents were not eligible to\nparticipate in phase 2. In the analyses presented herein, we combine the results from\nthe two phases.\nSeed Selection\nAll sites began recruitment in each phase with the selection of seeds that met study\neligibility criteria and the requirements of RDS--networks of substantial size and a\nwillingness to recruit. The UCLA Office for the Protection of Research Subjects\nallowed only passive recruitment of seeds through flyers and advertisements (i.e.,\nthey could not approach potential seeds but had to wait for seeds to contact them);\nthe other sites allowed active recruitment in which study staff could identify and\napproach community members who they though met eligibility criteria and invite\nthem to participate. Each site began the study with a small number of seeds and then\nadded seeds as needed throughout the study to boost recruitment when a\nrecruitment chain ended or to boost recruitment in one of the higher risk groups\n(MSM, DU/IDU). Table 1 illustrates the composition of all seeds selected throughout\nboth phases of the study.\nEligibility Screening\nEach site stored eligibility information in a record management system (RMS). The\nRMS included an eligibility screening system, descriptive characteristics of\nparticipants, confirmation of consent, status of questionnaire and biological testing\ncompletion, and the numbers and dates of coupons distributed by each participant.\nAll potential participants first were screened to determine whether their coupons\nwere valid. Next, participants answered a series of questions to determine whether\nthey met eligibility criteria for the type of coupon they wished to redeem. For\nexample, a participant with a DU/IDU/MSM coupon had to report using\nmethamphetamine, heroin, crack cocaine, or powder cocaine in the previous\n6 months, or injecting some other drug in the previous 6 months, and/or having\nanal sex with another man in the previous 6 months. Participants redeeming sex\npartner coupons had to report having had sex in the previous 6 months with the\nperson who recruited them into the study. For those claiming MSM status only, the\nRMS screened to confirm that the recruiter was a male. The RMS also screened for\nduplicate participants by comparing new participants' demographic characteristics\n(such as birth date and race/ethnicity), biometric measurements of arm length and\nwrist circumference, and physical features (such as tattoos and scars) with those of\nexisting participants. The RMS displayed lists of potential matches with which to\ncompare new recruits and eliminate duplicates.\nInterviews and Biological Sampling\nAll eligible participants were asked to complete three questionnaires and to provide\nbiological samples for HIV and other sexually transmitted disease testing. All\nquestionnaires were self-administered computerized interviews (computer-assisted\nself-interview) with audio (in Chicago, Los Angeles, and Raleigh\u00adDurham) or\nwithout (in St. Petersburg).\nRDS 1 Questionnaire The first questionnaire was an RDS sampling questionnaire\nused to collect data on social network size and composition for post-stratification\nassignment of RDS weights and to examine possible recruitment bias.\nSATHCAP Main Questionnaire The SATHCAP Main Questionnaire (SMQ) asked\nparticipants about drug using and sexual risk behaviors, about sexual partnerships\nand the nature of these partnerships, and about the location of their risk activities.\nSMQ items were drawn from a variety of existing instruments, including the NIDA\nRisk Behavior Assessment,49,50 the CDC Project Mix Sexual Behavior Assessment,51\nthe EXPLORE Study Instrument,52 the CDC YMS Study Instrument,53 and the HIV\nPartnership Survey.54 Injection and sexual risk behavior questions were asked at the\nglobal level (i.e., whether participants had ever or recently engaged in a certain\nactivity) and at the event level (i.e., whether they had engaged in certain behaviors\nwith specific recent partners whose initials they provided at the start of the injection\nTABLE 1 Seed composition\nand sexual risk sections of the questionnaire). In the injection risk section,\nparticipants could report on up to four partners with whom they had injected drugs\nin the previous 6 months. These included three recent drug injection partners and the\nprimary drug-injecting partner if he or she was not one of the three. In the sexual\nrisk behavior section, participants could report on up to six partners with whom\nthey had had sex in the previous 6 months. These included three recent partners, as\nwell as an IDU partner who was also a sexual partner, their main sexual partner,\nand a female sexual partner of an MSM, if these partners were not among the initial\nthree. In phase 2 of the study, participants also could answer questions about their\nrecruiter if the recruiter was not among the initial three drug injection or sexual\npartners mentioned. The same questionnaire was administered at each site. The\nSMQ reflected the overall study design by emphasizing the identification of\nindividuals serving a functional role as bridges for HIV transmission from identified\nhigher risk groups to lower risk groups via sexual transmission.\nRDS 2 Questionnaire An RDS questionnaire designed to assess the characteristics\nof individuals who declined coupons was administered to participants returning to\nobtain payment for successful referrals. In this third questionnaire, participants were\nqueried about individuals to whom they had given coupons but who had not\naccepted or redeemed them.\nBiological Testing This questionnaire also was designed to facilitate the examina-\ntion of recruitment bias. All sites tested participants for HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea,\nand Chlamydia trachomatis. In addition, the Los Angeles site tested MSM for anal\nhuman papilloma virus, Raleigh\u00adDurham tested all participants for hepatitis C, and\nSt. Petersburg tested all participants for hepatitis B and C. The number of tests\nconducted by all sites was limited due to cost considerations.\nMulti-Level Recruitment: Dual Higher Risk Group to Sex\nPartner to Sex Partner of Sex Partner\nUpon completing the RDS 1 and the SMQ questionnaires and biological specimen\ncollection, participants who completed all parts of the study were eligible to\ndistribute coupons. Coupons were dollar-bill-sized colored paper that contained a\ncoupon number for later eligibility screening as well as contact information for the\nstudy. A map of the study location was on the back of the coupons. The types and\ncolors of coupons distributed by study participants differed by risk group\nclassification.\nIn phase 1 of the study, dual higher risk group participants were given coupons\nto give to three people who also met the dual higher risk group definition: \"any\nperson who used heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine, or crack, or injected another\ndrug in the past six months,\" OR \"any man who had anal sex with another man in\nthe past six months.\" Dual higher risk group participants were also given two \"sex\npartner\" coupons with which to recruit people who met study criteria for a sex\npartner: \"any person with whom you have had sex in the past six months.\" In\naddition, participants were given one \"special interest sex partner\" coupon. Those\nparticipants who were IDU/DU were to use this coupon to recruit a non-drug-using\nsex partner with whom they had had sex in the previous 6 months, and participants\nwho were MSM were to use it to recruit women with whom they had had sex in the\nprevious 6 months. Sex partners also were eligible to become recruiters. The sex\npartners of dual higher risk group members were given three sex partner coupons\nwith which to recruit anyone with whom they had had sex in the previous 6 months.\nSex partners of sex partners could not become recruiters and thus did not distribute\ncoupons.\nStudy investigators altered recruitment in phase 2 to simplify coupon\ndistribution for recruiters and to adjust for low recruitment of non-drug-using sex\npartners in phase 1. In phase 2, dual higher risk group participants initially received\ntwo coupons to give to two people who met the definition of the dual higher risk\ngroup (MSM or IDU/DU). They also received two \"opposite sex partner\" coupons\nwith which to recruit female sex partners if they were male and male sex partners if\nthey were female. Participants who redeemed opposite sex partner coupons and met\nthe sex partner criteria were given two opposite sex partner coupons with which to\nrecruit up to two of their own-sex partners. All sites increased the number of dual\nhigher risk group coupons to four by the middle of the phase 2 recruitment period to\nincrease recruitment of dual higher risk group participants.\nAll participants, including seeds, were compensated for their time and\nparticipation in the study and for every eligible person they recruited (i.e., provided\ncoupons to) who was willing to be screened. Payments for participation in the\nresearch protocol and recruiter compensation differed by site due to variations in\nlocal practices and Institutional Review Board requirements.\nEligibility Verification at the Analysis Stage\nAlthough initial eligibility screenings were conducted carefully and consistently at all\nsites, participants may have had prior knowledge about eligibility criteria and could\nhave provided false responses to the eligibility screening questions in order to obtain\nthe benefits of study participation. Therefore, we applied a secondary algorithm to\nverify eligibility for inclusion in the analysis. For dual higher risk group membership\n(MSM or IDU/DU), individuals (1) had to have been recruited by another dual\nhigher risk group member and (2) had to have answered affirmatively to questions\nduring the main interview indicating IDU/DU or MSM status. To be eligible as a sex\npartner, respondents had to have reported during the interview that they had had\nsex with the person who gave them a coupon. Participants who were found to be\ninconsistent on these criteria were excluded from analysis. Although secondary\nscreening also was based on self-report, the results had no impact on participant\neligibility for participant payments, so participants did not have an ongoing\nincentive to provide false answers.\nRequiring consistent responses between the questionnaire and the eligibility\nscreen for analytic purposes provided additional assurance of accurate risk group\nclassification. However, as in many studies using self-report for eligibility, there was\nno guarantee that our additional screening identified all who did not meet the\ncriteria. The total number of participants across all sites that were excluded from\nanalysis in phase 1 because they were found to be an ineligible MSM or IDU/DU or\na sexual partner recruited by an ineligible MSM or IDU/DU was 123 (3.8%) of\nparticipants.\nIn addition, while a recruit's coupon provided an initial risk classification,\nfurther examination at the data analysis stage showed that participants frequently\nbelonged to more than one risk group. For example, participants coming in as sex\npartners and as sex partners of sex partners frequently met criteria for the primary\nrisk group categories (MSM or IDU/DU). Because the primary purpose of the study\nwas to determine the spread of sexually transmitted HIV from higher risk groups to\nlower risk groups, sex partners found to meet criteria for the primary risk group\nwere assigned to the dual higher risk group for analytic purposes. A designation of\n\"sex partner only\" was made for sex partners who were not also members of either\nprimary risk group.\nAssessment of Recruitment Bias and Network Representation\nTo evaluate potential recruitment bias at each site, we compared the overall\ncomposition of the samples recruited at each site with the reported composition of\nthose who refused coupons to determine non-participation bias. Next, we evaluated\nthe RDS reciprocity assumption to determine if recruiters recruited people known to\nthem. We also examined recruitment homophily (in-group recruitment), network\nequilibrium, and non-response bias to determine their relative effects on the final\ncomposition of the RDS sample, and we tested the RDS random recruitment\nassumption, that is, whether participants recruited randomly from their personal\nnetworks. Finally, to determine the level of bias created by recruitment of like\nindividuals, we assessed sample equilibrium to determine whether the samples\neventually reached a point of stabilization.\nRESULTS\nRecruitment\nThe sites spent between 12 and 14 months recruiting during phase 1 of the study\nand up to 21 months during phase 2 (see Table 2). In phase 1, the Chicago site\nrecruited the most participants (n=1,068) from the fewest number of seeds (n=5).\nRaleigh\u00adDurham and Los Angeles recruited fewer participants (n=881 and n=797,\nrespectively) from a larger number of seeds (n=17 and n=25, respectively). St.\nPetersburg required the greatest number of seeds (n=48) because of short\nrecruitment chains and somewhat less efficient recruitment (i.e., fewer participants,\nslower recruitment) than was the case at the US sites, resulting in the enrollment of\nfewer participants (n=522). Phase 2 extended longer than phase 1 in an effort to\nmaximize the length of recruitment chains. All sites employed a substantially higher\nTABLE 2 Summary of recruitment for study phases 1 and 2\nRaleigh\u00adDurham Los Angeles Chicago St. Petersburg\nnumber of seeds in phase 2 and, with the exception of the St. Petersburg site,\nrecruited more participants than they had in phase 1.\nRisk Group Composition\nIn both phases of the study, IDU/DU who were not MSM made up the majority of\nparticipants recruited via dual higher risk group (MSM or IDU/DU) coupons in\nRaleigh\u00adDurham, Chicago and St. Petersburg (see Tables 3 and 4). In Los Angeles,\nabout half of the participants recruited via dual higher risk group coupons in both\nphases of the study were MSM or men who have sex with men and with women\nTABLE 3 Percentage of participants recruited from dual high-risk group (MSM or IDU/DU)\ncoupons (behaviorally defined)\nRaleigh\u00adDurham\nLos Angeles\nChicago\nSt. Petersburg\nIDU\nDU\nPercentages do not total 100% due to rounding\nTABLE 4 Percentage of participants recruited from sex partner coupons (behaviorally defined)\nRaleigh\u00adDurham\nLos Angeles\nChicago\nSt. Petersburg\nIDU\nDU\nSex partner only\nPercentages do not total 100% due to rounding\n(MSMW) IDU/DU. High proportions of MSM or IDU/DU coupon holders at all\nthree US sites identified themselves as MSMW DU in both phases of the study. Note\nthat risk groups in Tables 3 and 4 are defined by behaviors reported in the SMQ\nrather than by coupon type.\nSample Characteristics\nTables 5 and 6 give the demographics for the two sets of coupon recruits,\nrespectively, for both phases of the study. As shown, the mean age for both dual\nhigher risk group (MSM or IDU/DU) and sex partner coupon recruits was around\n40 years at each US site and 28 years at the St. Petersburg site. All samples were\npredominantly male, with a small increase in the proportion of females in phase 2,\nconsistent with the focus on recruiting partners of the opposite sex. In both phases,\nthe majority of participants in each of the US samples were black, with modest\nproportions of Hispanic participants at the Los Angeles and Chicago sites. Being\nemployed, either full or part-time, among dual higher-risk group coupon holders\nranged from 13% at the Chicago site to 44% in St. Petersburg, with a similar range\namong sex partner coupon holders. High proportions of the sample at each site\nreported being homeless at some time during the previous year, with a range among\ndual higher risk group coupon holders of 20% (St. Petersburg) to 56% (Los\nAngeles).\nAssessment of Recruitment Bias\nTo better understand the sources and relative contributions of recruitment bias, we\nexamined discrepancies between network compositions of those recruited and those\nwho refused coupons; we explored the relationship between recruiters and recruits\nto determine whether recruits were known to recruiters, an important requirement\nof RDS; we assessed the samples for possible homophily bias; we conducted a\nTABLE 5 Demographics of dual high-risk group (MSM/IDU/DU) coupon recruits\nRaleigh\u00adDurham\nLos Angeles\nChicago\nSt. Petersburg\nEthnicity\nEmployment\nIncome\nsensitivity analysis to test the assumption of random recruitment; and we examined\npoints at which samples reached equilibrium.\nRecruited Social Network Composition Versus Composition of Those Who Refused\nCoupons At the Raleigh\u00adDurham site, racial/ethnic composition of those who\nrefused coupons did not differ significantly (chi-square, pG0.05) from the\ncomposition of those recruited. In Los Angeles, the percentage of overall coupon\nrefusals who were Hispanic (21%) differed significantly from the overall percentage\npercentage of overall coupon refusals who were black (59%) differed significantly\ndiffered significantly from the percentage of recruits where were white (38%) 2(1 N=\nRecruiter/Recruit Reciprocity An assumption of RDS is that there is a reciprocal\nrelationship between recruiters and recruits;25 that is, recruiters are instructed to\nrecruit people \"they know\" who are members of their MSM or DU networks. To\ntest this assumption, we asked recruits how they would describe their relationship\nwith their recruiter--friend, acquaintance, or stranger. Most participants at each site\ndescribed their recruiter as a friend or acquaintance (Table 7). There were, however,\na small percentage of participants at each site who said their recruiter was a stranger.\nThis indicates some breakdown in study procedures and, in these cases, a violation\nof the reciprocity assumption.\nHomophily The homophily index provides information about the tendency among\nstudy participants to recruit others with characteristics like or unlike their own.25\nRandom mixing produces homophily values that approximate zero. A homophily\nlevel can be said to approximate random mixing statistically if the confidence\nTABLE 6 Demographics of sex partner coupon recruits\nRaleigh\u00adDurham\nLos Angeles\nChicago\nSt. Petersburg\nEthnicity\nEmployment\nIncome\ninterval (CI) for homophily includes the zero point. When the question at issue is the\nextent to which homophily affects affiliation patterns, no hard line of demarcation\ndefines low homophily, but a figure of 0.4 is commonly used. In that case, a strong\nplurality of affiliations (i.e., 60%) are formed in a manner independent of\nTables 8, 9, 10, and 11 show the homophily scores by site for, respectively, risk\ngroup, gender, race/ethnicity, and HIV status. A score of 0 on a homophily index\nindicates equivalent recruitment across groups, a score of 1 indicates exclusive in-\ngroup recruitment, and a score of -1 indicates exclusive out-group recruitment.\nWhen viewing homophily scores along the diagonal in the tables, a score of 1\nindicates that individuals recruit only others like themselves; a score of -1 indicates\nTABLE 8 Risk group homophily by site\nRaleigh\u00adDurham\nLos Angeles\nChicago\nSt. Petersburg\nTABLE 7 Recruiter/recruit reciprocity\nRaleigh\u00adDurham (%)\nStranger 7\nLos Angeles (%)\nStranger 6\nChicago (%)\nStranger 3\nSt. Petersburg (%)\nStranger 4\nthat they recruit only others unlike themselves. Homophily index values of greater\nthan \u00b10.7 are thought to be problematic in RDS studies because design effects are\nestimated at 4 or more, with steep increases in design effect as homophily values\nrise.55 A homophily value of +0.7 may be interpreted as indicating that recruitment\nwas consistent with random mixing 30% of the time and was in-group 70% of the\ntime. Of course, increases in design effect for making point prevalence estimates\nacross groups require an increase in sample size and more recruitment waves to\novercome population segmentation. High homophily values also require an increase\nin recruitment waves to overcome population segmentation.\nThe results for the risk groups (Table 8) indicate that DU had a tendency to\nrecruit other DU and not to recruit non-DU MSM. Similarly, non-DU MSM tended\nto recruit other non-DU MSM and not DU. In Chicago, however, homophily values\nwere quite large, with DU demonstrating out-group recruitment of MSM 78% of\nthe time and MSM demonstrating out-group recruitment of DU 67% of the time. In\nSt. Petersburg, homophily values were even larger, with DU demonstrating in-group\nTABLE 9 Gender homophily by site\nMale Female\nRaleigh\u00adDurham\nLos Angeles\nChicago\nSt. Petersburg\nTABLE 10 Race/ethnicity homophily by site\nBlack Hispanic White\nRaleigh\u00adDurham\nLos Angeles\nChicago\nrecruitment of other DU 74% of the time and out-group recruitment of MSM 93%\nof the time. MSM in St. Petersburg demonstrated in-group recruitment of other\nMSM 84% of the time and out-group recruitment of DU 97% of the time. Of great\ninterest is the MSM/DU group at all sites that demonstrated lower homophily values\nand a much greater tendency to demonstrate random mixing than either DU or\nMSM. These values indicate an important potential role for MSM/DU as a bridge\nbetween these two risk groups in Chicago and St. Petersburg.\nA review of the homophily values for gender (Table 9) indicates that females at\nall of the US sites demonstrated a slight tendency to recruit other females and not to\nrecruit males. The homophily values for males demonstrated recruitment patterns\nthat were generally consistent with random mixing.\nThe racial/ethnic recruitment patterns (Table 10) are more complex. In general,\nblack participants at the US sites demonstrated a slight tendency to recruit other\nblacks and not to recruit Hispanics or whites. This tendency was more pronounced\nin Chicago where black participants demonstrated in-group recruitment of other\nblack participants approximately 71% of the time and out-group recruitment of\nHispanic participants 81% of the time. At the same time, Hispanic participants\ndemonstrated out-group recruitment of black participants 77% of the time. Other\nrecruitment combinations in Chicago did not demonstrate the same level of\nsegmentation (e.g., white participants' recruitment of Hispanic participants was\nconsistent with random mixing almost 90% of the time).\nWith respect to HIV status (Table 11), in Los Angeles, HIV-negative participants\ntended to recruit persons who were also HIV-negative (homophily=0.66) and not to\nrecruit persons who were HIV-positive (homophily=-0.66). HIV-positive partic-\nipants responded similarly: They tended to recruit persons who were HIV-positive\n(homophily=0.63) and not persons who were HIV-negative (-0.63).\nEvaluating the Random Recruitment Assumption An analytic assumption of the\nRDS method holds that respondents recruit randomly from their personal networks.\nA means for testing this assumption involves comparing the composition of personal\nnetworks as revealed by self-reports versus actual recruitment behavior. If the\nassumption of random recruitment is satisfied and the self-reports are accurate, the\ntwo should vary only due to stochastic variation.\nTABLE 11 HIV status homophily by site\nNegative Positive\nRaleigh\u00adDurham\nLos Angeles\nChicago\nSt. Petersburg\nThe plausibility of this assumption depends importantly on research design. For\nexample, the location of the interview site can be significant, as was shown in a\nBridgeport, Connecticut study of IDUs.55 Sampling in an interview site located in a\nblack neighborhood yielded only blacks, though respondents also reported knowing\nHispanic IDUs. Consequently, the random recruitment assumption was violated;\nthat is, recruitment behavior (i.e., all blacks) did not coincide with self-reported\nnetwork composition (i.e., a mix of blacks and Hispanics). The solution to this\nproblem involved moving the interview site to neutral ground, the downtown area\nwithin which no ethnic group predominated. Recruitment then yielded a mix of\nblacks and Hispanics in a manner more consistent with the self-reports. Similarly,\nthe plausibility of the random recruitment assumption can be affected if the times\nduring which interviews are conducted exclude some subjects, if the incentives are\nnot salient for some groups of respondents, and if the remoteness of the interview\nsite limits access. More generally, the random recruitment assumption is only\nplausible if members of the target population have reasonably easy and comfortable\naccess to the interview site along with appropriate incentives to take advantage of\nthat access.\nTesting the random recruitment assumption using comparisons of network\ncomposition as revealed by self-reports and by recruitment behavior has an inherent\nlimitation. Comparisons are possible for visible personal characteristics, such as\ngender, race/ethnicity, or homelessness. However, they are not possible for terms\nthat are not public knowledge, such as HIV status or frequency of HIV risk\nbehavior. If the random recruitment assumption is satisfied with respect to issues of\npublic knowledge, the assumption of random recruitment is made more plausible for\nother issues.\nThis section reports on a comparison based on gender of both waves of the\nSATH-CAP study. This characteristic was selected because with rare exceptions, it is\nan unambiguous matter of public knowledge. In contrast, a term such as race/\nethnicity is increasingly ambiguous for respondents of diverse racial/ethnic\nbackground. Furthermore, whereas gender is a characteristic that is meaningful at\nall four sites, race/ethnicity would not be meaningful in St. Petersburg, Russia where\nrace/ethnicity is homogeneous. Analysis was limited to recruitment of drug users, a\ngroup that encompassed most respondents at all sites, because non-drug-using MSM\nand MSMW are by definition male. Therefore, non-drug users, and respondents\nwhose drug use status was unknown, were eliminated from the analysis.\nThe central issue for the comparison is how much bias might have been\nintroduced into the RDS population estimate by violations of the assumption. To\nmeasure this potential bias, a two-step procedure was employed. First, the\npopulation estimate was calculated in the usual manner for an RDS analysis. This\ninvolved calculating the population estimate based on two terms, proportional\ncross-group recruitment (e.g., the proportion of males who recruit females) and the\nestimated network size for each group. This yields the RDS population estimate.\nThe second step is to calculate cross-group recruitment based on network self-\nreports. This reveals what actual cross-group recruitment would have been had\nrespondents recruited in a manner consistent with their self-reports. For example,\nrespondents were asked how many male drug users that they knew and how many\nfemale drug users that they knew. The self-report-based cross-group recruitment\ncould then be calculated. For example, for male respondents, cross-gender\nrecruitment of drug users is the number of female drug users who are known divided\nby the sum of the number of male and female drug users who are known. This self-\nreport-based cross-group recruitment proportion was then entered into the RDS\nestimator equation to calculate what the population estimate would have been for\nthis group had actual recruitment patterns exactly coincided with the self-reports.\nThe difference between the RDS population estimator and the self-report-based\npopulation estimator indicates the potential bias resulting from violations of the\nrandom recruitment assumption. Figure 1 shows the outcome of these analyses\nwhere, for each of the four study sites, the bar with the diagonal lines is the RDS\nestimate, the bar with the dots is the self-report estimate, and the error bars\ncorrespond to 95% confidence intervals.\nThe estimates for the Raleigh\u00adDurham and St. Petersburg sites are convergent,\nwith each estimate lying within the other's confidence intervals. This correspondence\nprovides support for the random recruitment assumption. In contrast, the Chicago\nsite estimates are more divergent, though the confidence intervals are adjacent, so\nthe difference is not statistically significant.\nFinally, the Los Angeles estimates are divergent, with no overlap in the\nconfidence intervals, so the difference is statistically significant. An examination of\nthe origins of this discrepancy reveals that it lies principally in the recruitment\npatterns of males. Though they reported knowing 24.2% females, they in fact\nrecruited only 6%. Consequently, they appear to have massively under-recruited\nfemales. The pattern for recruitment by females reflects a smaller divergence between\nactual recruitment and the self-report, but a similar pattern. Females reported\nknowing 65.2% males, but recruited only 54.5%. Consequently, using self-reports\nas a baseline, each gender under-recruited members of the opposite gender.\nNo definitive explanation of the Los Angeles site's results is possible because\nneither self-reports nor recruitment behavior constitutes a gold standard for\nmeasuring social network composition. As a result, when discrepancies arise, it is\nnot clear which term is at fault. Alternative arguments are possible. On the one\nhand, comparisons of the accuracy of self-report network indicators have found\nreports of network size to be among the more reliable and valid.23 On the other\nhand, behavioral indicators such as actual recruitment behavior are frequently\nviewed as more reliable and valid than self-report-based data. The validity of self-\nreports can be assessed, at least in part, by examining internal consistency and\nRaleigh-Durham Chicago St. Petersburg Los Angeles\nPopulation Proportion\nRDS Estimate Self-Report Estimate\nFIGURE 1. Analysis of random recruitment by gender.\nplausibility of the reports. In the Los Angeles data set, internal consistency was\nusers that did not equal the numbers of male and female drug users that were\nknown, (e.g., one respondent reported knowing 70 drug users, of whom three were\nmale and three were female). Also, some self-reports appeared implausible, (e.g.,\nrespondents' self-reports (792/956) were in some respect problematic. Unfortunate-\nly, no comparable method for assessing the internal consistency of recruitment\npatterns is available; however, an indirect measure is available for assessing the\nrelative role of problematic self-reports versus recruitment patterns in producing\ndiscrepant estimates. If the discrepancy between the two types of estimates results\nfrom errors in self-reports, a positive relationship would be expected between the\npercentage of problematic self-reports and the discrepancy between the estimates,\nand the two types of estimates would become convergent when problematic self-\nreports are rare. Evidence for this pattern emerges from a cross-site comparison of\nproblematic self-reports. In the site where the estimates are most divergent,\nproblematic self-reports are more common, 82.8%, than in the sites where estimates\nare more convergent, 9.4%, 10%, and 17.2%, for Chicago, Raleigh\u00adDurham, and\nSt. Petersburg, respectively. This pattern suggests that errors in self-reports may be\ncontributors to the discrepancies.\nSeveral explanations of the discrepancy that reflect either discrepancies between\nnetwork composition and recruitment behavior or errors in the self-reports are\npossible. First, the discrepancy could reflect greater social cohesion within as\ncompared to across genders, so members of each gender are more effective at\nrecruiting from their own group, thereby inducing a discrepancy between\nrecruitment and network composition. Should this prove to be the case, then RDS\npopulation estimates could potentially be improved if the network size question is\nreframed to focus only on close associates and exclude distant acquaintances.\nHowever, it is not clear why this pattern appeared at sites other than LA for males,\nbut not for females. Another possibility is that cross-gender associations are\ndifferentially valued, so self-reports could have been distorted by a social accept-\nability bias in which members of each gender exaggerate their number of cross-\ngender peers. Should the social desirability explanation prove to be the case, the\nvalidity of network self-reports for assessing the random recruitment assumption\ncould be refined based on measures of social desirability, and this might differentiate\nthe LA case from the other cases.\nIn sum, evidence consistent with the random recruitment assumption was found\nat two sites (Raleigh\u00adDurham and St. Petersburg), and discrepant evidence was\nfound at the Los Angeles site. However, interpretation of the discrepancy given that\nthe origin of the disparity--either errors in self-reports or divergence between\nrecruitment behavior and network composition--remains unclear. Clearly, more\nresearch is needed both on recruitment behavior in RDS and on how respondents\nformulate their descriptions of network composition. Such research might lead to\nways to structure the recruitment relationship more effectively to ensure that the\nrandom recruitment assumption is satisfied and more valid and reliable means for\neliciting self-reports of network composition. A useful place to begin would be cases\nwhere the discrepancy is especially large, e.g., a closer study both of recruitment by\ngender among male respondents in LA and of the process by which this group\nreported its network composition.\nSample Equilibrium Sample equilibrium in RDS is the point in the recruitment\nprocess at which the sample stabilizes, i.e., the sample becomes independent of the\nchoice of initial seeds and, theoretically, reflects the composition of the population\nbeing studied. When we examined race/ethnicity for the US sites, we found that all\nthree of them eventually reached equilibrium, although they did so at different\npoints in the recruitment process (see Figure 2a\u00adc, which reflects equilibrium for\nphase 1 of the study).\nWaves are the number of levels in a recruitment chain that follow from an initial\nseed. The Raleigh\u00adDurham sample stabilized almost from the start in both phases of\nthe study seed (Figure 2a), indicating that proportions recruited during the first\nwaves of the study accurately reflected the reported sample composition for race/\nethnicity. The Los Angeles sample (Figure 2b) reached equilibrium for race/ethnicity\nby about wave 10 in phase 1 and by about wave 6 during phase 2 (data not shown).\nThe Chicago sample reached equilibrium in about wave 6 at its largest interview site\n(Figure 2c). We present Chicago data from only one interview site as an illustration.\nDISCUSSION\nEfficient Recruitment of DU and MSM\nThe strengths of the dual higher risk group RDS approach to sampling are apparent.\nBecause RDS facilitates the recruitment of large numbers of participants in a short\ntime, it was possible to interview more than 3,000 participants in slightly more than\n1 year across our four sites and more than 8,000 total across both phases of the\nstudy. Efficiency in RDS generally refers to a group's efficiency with respect to peer\nrecruitment. It is defined here as the ratio of the group's number of recruits to the\nnumber of the group who recruited them.36 There was a high ratio of recruits to\nseeds at all of the US sites, but not at the St. Petersburg sites. Ratios were as follows:\nHowever, although recruitment was efficient at most sites, the number of seeds\nrequired appears higher than that reported in other RDS studies, particularly for\nphase 2 of our study. This need for a greater number of seeds in phase 2 likely\nresulted from our prohibiting phase 1 subjects to enroll in phase 2; that is,\nparticipants in phase 1 probably included a substantial proportion of the most easily\nenrolled persons: those who resided or spent time near the study sites, were part of\nlocal street scenes, and were particularly amenable to joining the study. In\nconsequence, many of these people likely were not available when phase 2 began.\nRecruiting for phase 2 thus faced a challenge that was absent in phase 1. Moreover,\nby limiting the number of coupons in the early stages of phase 2, we may have\ninadvertently caused chains to \"die out\" earlier than they did in phase 1.\nIdentification of Overlapping At-Risk Populations\nOne of the distinctive features of this study was its use of RDS to simultaneously\nrecruit two overlapping risk populations thought to be at high risk for HIV\ninfection: MSM and DU. Because RDS recruitment occurs peer to peer, recruitment\nlinks may be used to examine the overlap between MSM and DU networks. A\nperson's personal network is defined for RDS purposes as those who are\nacquaintances, friends, or those closer than friends who qualify for inclusion in\nthe study and have been seen or otherwise contacted within a specified interval such\nWave\nPercent\nWave\nPercent\nblack Hispanic white\nblack Hispanic white\nWave\nPercent\nblack hispanic white\na\nb\nc\nFIGURE 2.

Equivalently but more simply, a person's personal network is the set of\npersons that the respondent knows whom he or she could legitimately recruit into\nthe study.36 For example, in Russia, homophily was very high among both MSM\nand DU recruits, with MSM demonstrating an almost complete preference for\nrecruiting other MSM. When out-group recruitment occurred, it almost always\ninvolved MSM/DU and rarely included heterosexual DU. In Russia, a very small\nMSM population (n=22) appeared to serve as a bridge between the two higher risk\nand non-overlapping populations.\nThe pattern observed in the US sites was very different. DU and MSM\ndemonstrated a much lower in-group recruitment tendency. In all three US cities, DU\nand MSM showed a moderate bias against recruiting one another, with DU also\ntending not to recruit MSM/DU. This tendency, however, was much weaker than the\none observed in our Russian site. It should also be noted that a great majority of\nmen reporting as MSM in our US sites were MSM/DU, making this group much less\na bridge than a directly overlapping risk group.\nIdentification of a Large Population of MSMW\nOne of the more interesting results from the recruitment strategy was the enrollment\nof a large population of men who reported having sex with both men and women in\nthe previous 6 months. The large proportions of men reporting bisexual behavior is\nconsistent with recent suggestions in the literature of high rates of bisexual behavior\nThese studies suggest that as many as 27% of MSM may also be having sex with\nwomen.56 Our study reinforces these findings.\nIn St. Petersburg, 19.2% of the 180 MSM, both DU and non-DU, reported\nhaving sex with a woman in the 6 months prior to the interview. This fraction was\neven higher in the USA where MSMW were a substantial proportion not just of\nMSM but of all men recruited into the study. These proportions of MSMW among\nall men recruited into the study ranged from 17% (in Chicago) to 20% (in Raleigh\u00ad\nDurham) to 35% (in Los Angeles). Most of the MSMW at the US sites were non-gay\nidentified, lower income, crack cocaine users, and black. Clearly, this group has\npotential as a bridge for HIV transmission between MSM and their female sexual\npartners.\nStudy Limitations: Recruitment Bias, Violations of RDS\nAssumptions, and Generalizability\nAs stated earlier, one of the basic theoretical underpinnings of RDS is that\nrespondents recruit randomly from their personal networks. Our data indicate that\nthis assumption likely was violated for gender at our Los Angeles site and suggest\nthat the assumption also could have been violated for other characteristics, such as\nrace/ethnicity. These findings limit statements of the sample's representativeness with\nrespect to point prevalence estimates between groups. In addition, significant\ndifferences between the percentage of Hispanics who refused coupons and the\npercentage of Hispanics recruited suggest possible non-participation bias for\nHispanics in Los Angeles. We have also considered the impact of these problems\non assumptions underlying RDS such as those related to Markov models (e.g.,\nrandom sampling without \"memory\"),25 but our conclusion was that minor\nviolations of those assumptions meant that equilibrium would be reached more\nslowly; thus, no further adjustments were required.\nIt is clear that the RDS sampling approach did not result in a diverse sample of\nMSM and DU across age and income groups at any of our US sites, limiting the\nextent to which we were able to generalize our results beyond the lower\nsocioeconomic networks from which our participants appear to be drawn. In the\nUSA, our MSM, DU, and MSM/DU samples were all older, primarily black or\nHispanic, and very low income. Conspicuously absent from the RDS recruited\nsample in the US were younger, white, and middle- and upper-income DU and\nMSM. Attempts to recruit higher income MSM and DU were unsuccessful;\nrecruitment chains either ended quickly or dropped back into lower income\nparticipants. In St. Petersburg, Russia, participants appeared to be predominantly\nheroin-using IDU and similarly very low income (with approximately 49%\nreporting they were unemployed), but they were much younger than their US\ncounterparts.\nThere are a number of reasons why individuals from higher socioeconomic\nstatus (SES) groups might not have been recruited to the study in the USA. First,\nparticipants were required to come to established interview sites that were generally\nlocated in lower income and minority neighborhoods. Second, burdens associated\nwith participation were relatively high, including an interview process that took over\nan hour to complete and a requirement to provide biological samples for testing. In\nall sites, this involved a blood draw, and in Los Angeles, male participants were\nrequired to also provide an anal swab for human papilloma virus testing. Third, the\nstudy relied entirely on money or gifts as incentives for participation and did not\nattempt to encourage participation for any other purpose, such as health promotion\nor scientific value. Promoting participation for socially redeeming purposes and\nteaming with community organizations to encourage participation might have\nresulted in the recruitment of individuals with higher SES. Indeed, survey researchers\nhave concluded that the decision to participate in research involves the interaction of\na number of factors, such as context in which survey takes place, behavior of person\nasking for survey participation, sponsorship and topic of survey, monetary or other\nkinds of incentives, amount and type of respondent burden, and degree of \"match\"\nbetween interviewer and respondent.64 These factors may well play out differently\nfor higher and lower income subjects and for MSM and DU.\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn summary, RDS was an efficient means for recruiting a large number of lower\nincome DU and MSM, but generally was not successful at recruiting from all eligible\nsegments, such as groups with higher incomes. The lack of reach across SES levels in\nthe USA may indicate a balkanization of groups, but it may also reflect a general\nfailure on our part to make the study relevant and attractive to individuals who\nrequire more than monetary incentives to participate. It may also be the case that\nsince RDS requires an acknowledged and reciprocal social tie in the determination of\neligible recruits, anonymous ties are left as potential means for disease transmission\nbetween groups that might not appear to intersect socially. Future studies will need\nto examine this possibility, with special attention to venues where SES groups might\nanonymously intersect.\nUse of RDS in the simultaneous recruitment of DU and MSM resulted in the\nidentification of a population of DU MSMW. This group requires additional study\nbecause it clearly holds potential for bridging populations at varied risk for HIV and\nother infectious diseases.\nFinally, although the sample may not represent the entire population of our dually\nrecruited risk groups, the recruited samples at each of our sites are certainly large\nenough to warrant attention on their own, and it does not seem unreasonable to view\nthem as representative of lower income DU and MSM residing proximal to our\ninterview sites. Despite uncertainty about the representativeness of the samples at each\nsite, the participants may still be of particular importance to policymakers. The poor,\nunemployed, marginally housed, and uninsured DU and MSM in this study represent\na group exhibiting a range of behaviors that place them at high risk from both\nacquiring and transmitting HIV. The group is also extremely vulnerable to arrest and\nincarceration, heavily dependent on publicly funded services, and likely to require\npublicly funded treatments for substance abuse, HIV, and other infectious diseases.\n"
