Considering that faces represent a highly\nhomogeneous class of stimuli, all having the same configuration of two eyes above a nose above a\nmouth, it has been suggested that discriminating between faces relies on the capacity to combine infor-\nmation about the individual features within a face (featural processing) along with information about\nthe spacing between these features (holistic processing; Tanaka & Farah, 1993).\nDespite this expertise at recognising and discriminating faces, the accuracy with which faces are\nrecognised is drastically reduced when the face is inverted. One of the first experiments to document\nthis phenomenon was conducted by Yin (1969), in which memory for faces, along with other objects\nusually only seen in a canonical upright orientation, was compared. It was found that, whilst memory\nfor all objects was impaired when inverted, memory for faces was affected to a much greater degree.\nFindings such as these have resulted in the idea that faces represent a \"special\" class of stimuli.\nIt is generally accepted that inverting a face results in some of the strategies used in process-\ning upright faces becoming ineffective. Many researchers have proposed that face inversion affects\nthe ability to use configural processing whilst leaving the ability to use featural processing intact\nMondloch, 2002). As a result of this, any changes to the configuration of the internal features of a face\nshould be apparent when viewed upright, but disappear once the face is inverted. When the eyes and\nthe mouth of a face are inverted within an upright face, the resulting \"thatcherised\" image is perceived\nas grotesque (Thompson, 1980). However, when this \"thatcherised\" image is inverted, the grotesque-\nness disappears and the face is perceived as normal. Bartlett and Searcy (1993) state that this effect is\ndue to the fact that \"thatcherising\" a face affects the holistic information derived from a face whilst\nleaving the featural information intact. Because the processing of inverted faces relies on featural in-\nformation, the changes are not apparent.\nThe loss of the ability to use holistic processing is further demonstrated in an experiment by\nSearcy and Bartlett (1996). Participants were required to rate the grotesqueness of a face when up-\nright or inverted. Faces presented could have spatial distortions, whereby the spacing between the\neyes, nose, and mouth was adjusted, or component distortions achieved by a blurring of the pupils\nor a blackening of the teeth. When inverted, grotesqueness ratings for the spatially distorted faces\nwere significantly lower than for component-distorted faces, suggesting that face inversion affects the\nencoding of holistic information much more than information derived from the features of the face.\nThese findings were replicated by Murray, Yong, and Rhodes (2000).\nWhy do most faces look thinner upside down?\nThese investigations confirmed that a change to the internal spacing of the features of the face is\napparent only when viewed in an upright orientation. Kemp, McManus, and Pigott (1990) made direct\nmeasurements of discrimination of eye position in upright, inverted, and photographic negative face\nimages and found that sensitivity to spatial shifts of eyes both vertically and horizontally was reduced\nin inverted and negative faces. A further demonstration of this lack of sensitivity to the configural cues\nin inverted faces is that devised by Helmut Leder, who stretched the nose of the actor Paul Newman\nsuch that the distortion was readily apparent in an upright face but largely overlooked in the inverted\nThe spacing of the internal features has further been reported to affect the way external objects\nare perceived. Lee and Freire (1999) demonstrated that when an oval aperture was placed over a face,\nremoving all the external features, the oval appears more elongated when the distance between the\ninternal facial features is increased. However, when the distance between the internal facial features\nis decreased, creating the illusion of a shorter looking face, the oval appears rounder. The authors\nnoted that inversion reduces this effect. Because inversion renders the ability to process the holistic\ninformation of a face ineffective, the reduction in the effect could be attributed to an inability to use\nthe information about the spatial relationships between features.\nHowever, Schwaninger, Ryf, and Hofer (2003) suggest that whilst the poor performance of rec-\nognition of inverted faces can be attributed to a loss of configural processing, the actual perception of\nconfigural information is unaffected by inversion. It was found that when asked to estimate the dis-\ntance between the internal features of a face, participants overestimated the distance between the eyes\nand mouth by 39% and the distance between the two eyes by 11%. The latter result, the estimate of\ninter-pupillary distance, may seem small compared with the figure of around 30% found by Thompson\n(2002). However, in that study participants were required to estimate their own inter-pupillary distance\nfrom memory. The overestimations found by Schwaninger et al. were maintained when the face was\ninverted. The question whether the reduction in the illusion found with inverted faces (reported by\nLee & Freire, 1999) can be attributed to a disruption in holistic processing.\nDuring a classroom demonstration to illustrate the reduced recognition of inverted familiar faces,\nit was observed that the face of James Corden, a British TV and stage actor, appeared noticeably thin-\nner when presented upside down (Figure 1).\nThe aim of this investigation was to quantify this illusion and to explore why inversion should\nbring about a perceived change in size of the face. It may well be that configural cues lose their influ-\nence in inverted faces, but that alone is not an explanation of the illusion.\nExperiment 1 aimed to quantify the basic observation that an inverted face appears thinner than its\nupright counterpart. It was hypothesised that the inverted face would appear significantly thinner than\nthe matching upright face.\nForced-choice methods were used in both Experiments 1 and 2. Participants were presented\nwith two faces with either an upright\u00adupright (UU), inverted\u00adinverted (II), or upright\u00adinverted (UI)\nFigure 1. A face that appears dramatically thinner when inverted. This is not the picture used when the effect was\nfirst observed.

The data were used to\nconstruct psychometric functions, from which points of subjective equality (PSEs) were calculated.\nMethod\nFourteen participants took part in the experiment. The participants ranged in age from 19 to 29, with\nPairs of faces, a \"standard face\" with a \"match\" face, were presented on a computer screen 50 cm\nfrom the participant. Participants indicated which of the two faces looked \"fatter.\" The standard face\nwas 78 mm (8.9 deg of visual angle) in width with the nine match faces having widths ranging from\na difference of -8 mm through to +8 mm in 2-mm intervals (steps of approximately 0.23 deg of arc\neach). The transformed faces were simply expanded in the horizontal direction, keeping the vertical\ndimensions unchanged. The two faces were presented for 500 ms on a black background, separated by\na horizontal distance of 14 deg, which placed the centre of each face 7 deg from fixation. The faces in\neach presentation could both be upright (UU), both inverted (II), or with the standard upright and the\nmatch face inverted (UI) (see Figure 2). Each combination of standard and match face was presented\n30 times and was counterbalanced so the match face appeared on the left for 50% and on the right for\n50% of trials. The order of presentation of trials was randomised across participants. A single face, that\nof James Corden, was used throughout the experiment. This protocol led to each participant seeing 30\nrepetitions of nine match face widths in three orientation combinations (UU, II, and UI), a total of 810\ntrials. An opportunity to rest was presented every 54 trials.\nResults and discussion\nThe response on each trial was converted into the probability that the participant will perceive the\nmatch face as being \"fatter\" than the standard face. Nine participants completed the experiment with\nthe full range of images from 8 mm thinner to 8 mm fatter. A further five participants completed the\nexperiment using the range of 6 mm thinner to 6 mm fatter.\nFigure 2. The procedure for Experiments 1 and 2, illustrating UU, UI, and II trials.\nFigure 3 illustrates that for the UU and II conditions the averaged PSE was close to being veridical, de-\nviating 0.21 mm (1.4 min arc) and -0.14 mm (1.0 min arc), respectively. The PSE for the UI condition was\n2.01 mm, that is the inverted face had to be 2.01 mm (14.4 min arc) fatter than the upright one at the PSE.\nFor statistical analysis, the data from each of the 14 participants generated separate psychometric\nfunctions for each of the UU, II, and UI conditions. The mean of the individual PSEs is shown in Table 1.\nThe differences between the UI condition and both the UU and II conditions were found to be\nsignificant with the Wilcoxon matched-pairs test (T values of 11 and 3 respectively, n = 14, p < 0.01\nin both cases).\nThe results indicate that participants were accurate at judging the fatness of a face when both im-\nages were presented upright or inverted with the means being close to zero in both cases. However,\nthere was a significant difference between both the UU and II conditions and the UI condition. The\nslope of the psychometric functions for the UI condition was greater than that obtained in the UU/II\nconditions, demonstrating that participants found matching an inverted face to an upright face a much\nharder task. The mean point at which the faces were perceived to match for the UI condition showed\nthat an inverted face needed to be 4.4% wider to match the upright face. This shows that the inverted\nface was perceived to be thinner than its upright counterpart.\nA plausible explanation of our results is that they represent an extension of the Lee and Freire (1999)\neffect, see their Figure 3 and our Figure 4. They presented internal facial features (eyes, nose, and\nmouth) within an oval framework; when the eyes and mouth were moved towards the frame the oval\nappeared elongated vertically, and when the eyes and mouth were moved towards the nose the oval\nappeared shorter and wider. If we presume that James Corden, the face in Experiment 1, has internal\nfeatures that are close together, then they might distort the external face shape when upright but to\na lesser extent when inverted, as holistic processing of the face is then lost. This interpretation leads\nto one clear prediction: faces with a relatively large distance between eyes and mouth should appear\nelongated when upright compared with their appearance when inverted.\nAn alternative explanation comes from Valentine (2001), who reported that every face can be\nrepresented within a face-space framework. Within the framework, average faces cluster around the\nFigure 3. The probability the match face was perceived as \"fatter\" than the standard face for the UU, UI, and II\nconditions, data averaged over all participants.\nTable 1. The mean PSE for the 14 participants. Positive values mean that inverted faces appear thinner than\nupright faces\nCondition Mean PSE (minutes)\nFaces look thinner upside down 769\ncentre whereas distinctive faces lie at points further from the centre. Once inverted, the ability to make\nfine judgements about the face is greatly reduced and, as a result, it is hypothesised that faces will\nrevert towards the average. Hence, if all faces look more average when inverted, it is not unreasonable\nto propose that thin upright faces should look fatter when inverted.\nThis interpretation might be couched in terms of a Bayesian model; let us assume that our prior is\nthat faces are some average size. Then upright faces, which allow us to make relatively precise judge-\nments and hence a relatively narrow likelihood, are little affected by the prior, while inverted faces,\nwhich give rise to noisier estimates, are more biased by the prior and should look more average.\nExperiment 2 aimed to determine whether this is the case in that a face reverts to the average\nand, therefore, when inverted, a fat face would appear thinner (as shown in Experiment 1) and a thin\nface would appear fatter. The alternative proposal (more attuned to Lee & Freire, 1999) is that the\ninternal features can distort the shape of the external features--and do more so with upright than\ninverted faces--but there is no reason why the average face should have a null effect on the external\nfeatures.\nMethod\nNineteen undergraduates from the University ofYork took part in the experiment. The participants ranged\nin age from 19 to 26, with a mean age of 20.11 years. All had normal or corrected-to-normal vision.\nUsing a method of adjustment, participants matched the shape of an inverted face to that of an upright\nversion of the same face. Matching involved altering the face dimensions horizontally in steps of\n1 mm (approximately 6.9 min arc). Twelve different faces, selected to provide a wide gamut of internal\nfeatures (defined as the distance from the bottom of the mouth to the top of the eyes) were matched in\nFigure 4. The face shape illusion as an example of the Lee and Freire (1999) effect. Moving the internal features\nfurther apart (left image) elongates the face and moving them closer compresses them (right image). According to\nLee and Freire, inverting the faces reduces the effect. Therefore, if our subject has naturally compressed features\n(centre image), his face will look \"fatter\" when upright.\nthis way and each face was matched four times. Participants sat 50 cm from the screen. The standard\nupright face was 108 mm (12.2 deg) in width. The experiment used a within-subjects design. Partici-\npants were required to scroll using the mouse to adjust the width of the inverted image in 1-mm steps\nto find the point at which they perceived the inverted face to match the standard upright face in width.\nThe first independent variable was the face presented and this had 12 levels of faces of different\nshapes. The second independent variable was the width of the inverted face and had 21 levels differ-\ning by 1 mm. The dependent variable was the point at which participants stated that the inverted face\nmatched the standard upright face. The order of presentation of trials was randomised across partici-\npants and the trials were counterbalanced so that the standard face was presented on the right for 50%\nof trials and on the left on 50% of trials.\nResults and discussion\nThe distance from the bottom of the mouth to the top of the eyes in the standardized faces gave the size\nof the internal facial features. This was plotted against effect size in Figure 5.\nA Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient was computed to assess the relationship be-\ntween the size of the internal features of a face and the effect size. There was a significant negative\ncorrelation (p < 0.05) between the size of the internal features and the effect size. The results show\nthat participants perceived 10 out of the 12 inverted faces to be narrower than their upright match.\nThere was a significant correlation between the size of the internal facial features and the size of the\nface shape illusion. The extent to which this occurred was dependent on the specific face presented.\nThe results suggest that the illusion is in some way attributable to the size of the internal features\nwithin a face; see Figure 6 for the extreme examples from our sample. However, assuming that our\nsample of faces is representative of the population, we might have expected an equal number of\npositive and negative effects if inverted faces revert to some \"average\" (Valentine, 2001).\nTo assess whether the internal features of a face contribute to the effects, Experiment 1 was repeated\nbut with the internal features of the face removed. It was hypothesised that with no visible internal\nfeatures there would be no difference in width perception between an upright and inverted face.\nFigure 5. The relationship between the size of the internal features of each face and the mean percentage effect\nof the illusion. The ratio of internal to external features is calculated from the extent of the internal features (top\nof eyes to bottom of mouth) as a proportion of the whole head height. James Corden's face (black triangle) shows\nnearly the smallest ratio of internal to external features. The extreme faces, square and diamond, are shown in\nFaces look thinner upside down 771\nMethod\nThirteen participants took part in the experiment. The ages ranged from 18 to 28 with a mean age of\nExperiment 3 followed the same design and procedure as Experiment 1, with the only difference being\nthat the internal features of the faces used were removed, using Photoshop software (see Figure 7).\nResults and discussion\nThe response on each trial was converted into the probability that the participant will perceive the ad-\njusted face as being \"fatter\" than the standard face. The psychometric functions for all three conditions\nwere very similar. For all three conditions, the probability that participants perceived the adjusted face\nas \"fatter\" than the standard face was comparable at all differences in width.\nTable 2 shows similar results for all three conditions. In each of the three conditions, the PSE was\nvery close to the true match; the largest deviation (for the UI) condition shows an effect of less than\n0.5%. A three-way within-subjects ANOVA was used to analyse the results. The main effect of the\nThe results show that when the eyes, nose, and mouth could not be used to judge the \"fatness\" of a\nface, similar results were found for all three conditions.

On right one of only two faces\nthat showed a \"reverse\" illusion, appearing thinner upright (red circle in Figure 5).\nfaces match, they are perceived to match in all conditions, a result very different from that obtained\nwhen the internal features are present.\n5 General discussion\nThe investigation has demonstrated that the internal features of a face contribute to the perceived\nshape of the external features. Lee and Freire (1999) concluded that the configuration of the inter-\nnal features of a face influence the perception of the shape of an oval aperture surrounding the face.\nThe current investigation indicates that these findings could be extended to include the fact that the\nconfiguration of the internal features influences the perception of the shape of the actual face. In this\nregard, our results are an extension of Lee and Freire's (1999) findings.\nWhen a face is inverted, the ability to use configural processing to discriminate between faces is\ndisrupted. Therefore, any information gained from the spacing of the features and their consequent\ninfluence on the perception of the external shape of a face should no longer be apparent when the face\nis inverted. Assuming that the particular internal features of James Corden's face, the stimulus for\nExperiment 1, are such that they equate with Lee and Freire's \"short\" face features, then the illusion\nis in direct accord with their demonstration. The key question is how the face should appear when it\nis inverted and configural cues have less effect on its perceived size. Experiment 2 has investigated\nthis, finding that it appears not to be the case that upside-down faces revert to some norm or average.\nHad this been true we might expect as many faces to appear fatter as we find thinner when inverted.\nFurthermore, we could predict that an average face would produce no illusion when inverted. We have\ntested this idea informally, generating a composite face of 125 female undergraduates. This should\nshow no illusion when inverted but the illusion is very apparent, the face appearing narrower upside\ndown (Figure 8).\nAlthough the illusion seems to be driven by the internal features of a face, there is no reason why\nthe external features of the face should not make a contribution to the effect. However, Experiment 3\nseems to eliminate this possibility as removing the internal features from a face effectively destroys the\nillusion.\nIn conclusion, these findings offer an insight into face perception. More specifically, this illusion\nprovides an insight into how our perception of external features can be affected by internal features.\nFigure 7.
