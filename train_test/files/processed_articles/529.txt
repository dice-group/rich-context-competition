However, these\nchanges are interacting with other drug\neffects.16,17 Indeed, in human studies, it is\ndifficult to differentiate the prenatal co-\ncaine effects from other drugs (OD).\nWomen using cocaine during pregnancy\nare more likely to use OD, illegal or\nalter in utero programming of brain\ndevelopment, contributing to later be-\nhavioral outcomes.\nIn addition, postnatal environment and\nearly childhood experiences may in-\nfluence behavior8\u00ad10 with or without\ntors include postnatal drug exposures,\nchild's exposure to violence, and care-\nin addition to the risks for disruptive\nbehavior,1 any long-term effect of PCE\nmay be offset or compensated by re-\nsilience and protective factors. Hence,\nthe balance between risk and pro-\ntective factors needs consideration in\ndetermination of PCE effects.\nWe therefore assessed whether the\neffects of high levels of PCE/polydrug\nexposure on childhood behavior will\npersist through adolescence. We also\ndetermined the roles of risk and pro-\ntective factors on the trajectories of\nbehavior outcomes in the presence of\nPCE and other prenatal drug exposure.\nOur hypothesis was that the detri-\nmental effects of high PCE/polydrug\nexposure on the trajectories of behav-\nior problems will persist through ado-\nlescence. We further hypothesized that\nrisk conditions will have cumulative\neffects on behavior outcomes while\nprotective factors will attenuate se-\nverity of behavioral alterations in PCE/\npolydrug exposure.\nMETHODS\nThe Maternal Lifestyle Study, a longitu-\ndinal cohort study, assessed outcomes\nof children with prenatal cocaine or\nopiate exposure in 4 centers, with\na Statistics\u00adData Coordinating Center\n(DCC) and a Neurobehavioral Battery\nCenter.23,24 Each site had approval from\nthe institutional review board and held\na certificate of confidentiality issued\nfrom the National Institute on Drug\nAbuse.

This\ncategorization provides a practical ap-\nproach for PCE because most cocaine\nusers are polydrug users. Other inves-\ntigators have used similar exposure\nWe also selected child, family, and com-\nmunity factors that have been reported\nas added risks or may be protective\nTable 1 shows the risk and protective\nfactors. From these factors, the final\nvariables in the growth curve models\nwere derived.

BMI was calculated at each visit\nfrom child measurements; high BMI\nor obesity has been related to child-\nhood and adolescent behavior out-\nderived from the Wechsler Abbrevi-\nated Scale of Intelligence (Pearson\nEducation, Inc, San Antonio, TX).36 Dur-\ning each visit, the caretakers were in-\nterviewed regarding their current use\nof tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana;\nexperience of domestic violence; and\nchild protective services involvement\n(eg, child abuse).37 To assess care-\ntaker depression, the Beck Depression\nfor caretaker anxiety and psychologi-\ncal symptoms, the Brief Symptom In-\nventory was used.40 We determined\nexposure to violence by using A Sur-\nvey of Community Violence.41\nChild resilience is a domain from the\nChildHealthandIllnessProfile\u00adAdolescent\nEdition (The Johns Hopkins University,\nBaltimore, MD).42 From the Strange\nnoted whether caretaker\u00adchild attach-\nment was secure.27 The Home Observa-\ntion and Monitoring of Environment\nsurvey44 indicated the quality of the\nhome as observed during home visits.\nFrom the Child Heath and Illness Pro-\nfile\u00adParent report,45 we derived the\nscores for caretaker involvement and\nthe child's number of friends. The Su-\npervision Questionnaire\u00adPrimary Care-\ntaker46 was used to assess facets of\nparental supervision and knowledge of\nyouth's whereabouts.

The Neighborhood Scale51\nhad questions on probability of success\nof those in the neighborhood, problems,\nand services. We interviewed care-\ntakers about the child's participation\nin school, community, and church ac-\ntivities.52 The caretaker was the re-\nspondent to all questionnaires, except\nfor the Child Health and Illness Profile\u00ad\nAdolescent Edition, which was adminis-\ntered to the youth.

We conducted latent\ngrowth curve (LGC) modeling by using\nthe Mplus56 software to estimate tra-\njectories of CBCL scores over time and\nexamine differences in trajectories\naccording to prenatal drug exposure\nand risk and protective factors while\naccounting for clustering of children by\nsite. The risk and protective factors for\nthe final models were selected by using\na backward stepwise approach, re-\ntaining all factors with P , .10 on the\nintercept and/or slope, controlling for\ndrug exposure. Factors were included\nin the final models if they remained in\nthe stepwise models forany of the CBCL\nscores. The risk and protective factor\nindexes represented the number of the\nsignificant risks or protective factors,\nwith a point assigned to each factor\nwith a yes response, or when the av-\nerage scores or ratings were at the\n75th percentile or higher.\nIn addition to examining the individual\nfactors and the index scores as pre-\ndictors of trajectories of behavior\nproblems, we also examined the com-\nbinationoflevelsofrisksandprotective\nindexestoindicatethebalancebetween\nrisks and protective factors. A median\nsplit was used to classify risk and\nprotective indexes as high versus low.\nLow-risk index refers to a cumulative\nrisk index ,3; a score $3 indicates\nhigh-risk index.

The proportions of high,\nsome, and no PCE did not differ be-\ntween subjects included versus not\nincluded in the analysis.\nTable 2 shows mean scores of inter-\nnalizing, externalizing, total, and atten-\ntion problems for each year according\nto the 4 exposure categories. The table\nalso includes proportions or means of\nother prenatal exposures. Of mothers in\nthe high PCE/OD group, 97% used an-\nother substance in addition to cocaine.\nRisk and protective factors were also\ncompared among the exposure groups.\nChildren with high PCE/OD had signifi-\ncantly greater externalizing and total\nproblem scores than those with PCE\u00ad/\nOD\u00ad (P , .05) after controlling for risk\nand protective factors (Table 3). Nei-\nther some PCE/OD nor PCE\u00ad/OD+ pre-\ndicted the intercept or slope of any of\nthe behavior problems. Male gender\nwas associated with significantly more\nexternalizing, total, and attention scores\nat 5 years (intercepts); in addition, male\nchildren had significantly lower slopes\nover time for externalizing and in-\nternalizing behaviors. Low verbal IQ was\nlinked to higher initial scores on exter-\nnalizing, total, and attention problems.\nContinuing caretaker use of tobacco or\nalcohol predicted externalizing and\ntotal behavior problems. Caretaker\npsychopathology had significant as-\nsociation with all outcomes, and de-\npression predicted internalizing and\ntotal problems. Child abuse was a pre-\ndictor of total and attention problems\nat 5 years (intercepts) and was also\nassociated with increasing externaliz-\ning and total problem scores over time\n(slopes).\nHigh resilience predicted lower scores\non all outcomes. Having many friends\nwasassociatedwithlowerinternalizing\nand attention problem scores and\na decrease in scores at later ages for\nresources was significantly associated\nwith lower scores on all behavior\noutcomes except for externalizing\nproblems. Caretaker involvement was\nsignificantly associated with decreases\non all behavior scores over time.\nWhen the cumulative risk and pro-\ntective indexes for each subject re-\nplaced the individual factors in the LGC\nmodel (Table 4, model 2), high PCE/OD\nremained a significant predictor for\nexternalizing problems. Some PCE/OD\ndid not predict behavior outcomes.\nPCE\u00ad/OD+ was associated only with\nincreasing internalizing behavior scores\n(slope) with increasing age.

Scores declined with age, but\nslopes did not differ from PCE\u00ad/OD\u00ad.\nHigh PCE/OD also predicted total prob-\nlems. All drug exposure groups were\nassociated with attention problems\n(intercepts); slopes were no different\nfrom PCE\u00ad/OD\u00ad.\nThe balance between risk and pro-\ntective indexes was significantly asso-\nciated with all behavior outcomes. A\nhigh-risk index in the presence of low\nprotective index added to the already\nsignificant effects of drug exposure.\nConversely, a high protective index in\nthe presence of a high-risk index miti-\ngated the predicted associated in-\ncreased behavior scores from drug\nexposure.Amongchildrenwithlow-risk\nindexes, those who also had low pro-\ntective indexes experienced smaller\ndeclines (slopes) in behavior problems\nover time compared with those with\nhighprotectiveindexesforinternalizing\naddition, although not statistically sig-\nnificant, similar trends were found for\nFurthermore, when compared with\nchildren with low risk and high pro-\ntective index scores, children with high\nrisk and low protective index scores\nhad smaller declines in total problem\nand attention problem scores (B [SE] =\nTo illustrate the influence of risk and\nprotective indexes on behavior prob-\nlems, Fig 1 presents the LGCs of CBCL\ntotal problem scores over time ac-\ncording to levels of risk and protective\nindexes separately in the 4 exposure\ngroups.

Although the differences in slopes\nbetween these groups were not sig-\nnificant when compared individually,\nthere was a significant difference in\nslopes when comparing the 2 low\nprotective groups with the 2 high pro-\nsupporting this general trend based on\nlevel of protective influences. Among\nyouths with some PCE/OD, 3 of the 4\ngroups differed by initial scores at 5\nyears (P , .05) and had similar slopes\nover time. However, although the\nremaining high risk\u00adhigh protective\ngroup had scores at 5 years similar to\nthe high risk\u00adlow protective group,\nthey experienced significantly greater\ndeclines in problem behaviors over\ntime (P = .039). Similar patterns of the\ninfluence of protective factors were\nobserved among the 2 groups without\nPCE (Fig 1). The groups with high pro-\ntective index scores had significantly\ndifferent slopes than those with low\nprotective index scores; they declined\nover time while the low protective\ngroups generally remained flat.\nDISCUSSION\nAfter consideration of the balance be-\ntween risk and protective indexes, high\nPCE/OD had continued effects on ex-\nternalizing, total, and attention behav-\nior problems through adolescence. The\neffects of high PCE/OD on externalizing\nand total problems were greater than\nthose from other categories of expo-\nsure. To our knowledge, this is the first\nstudy to explore the effects of PCE as\na polydrug problem while considering\nthe balance between cumulative risk\nand protective factors.\nMost studies highlighted the associ-\nated risks for adverse outcomes of\nmany individual-level factors and re-\npresents in utero programming result-\ning in fetal adaptation with long-lasting\nconsequences.
