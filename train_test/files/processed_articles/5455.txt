However, the question is, to what\nextent are the media free to discharge these uncontested\nrights? Recently, media practitioners have become targets of\nincreasing physical attacks and assaults globally, and these\nhave recorded astonishing and unacceptable injuries and\ndeaths. Beyond their right to life and secured professional\nenvironment, it tends to violate the right of society to infor-\nmation (Elliott, Elbahtimy, & Srinivasan, 2012). In a report\nof the Commonwealth Press, Ross (1999) stated,\n\"Conventional wisdom suggests that life for journalists has\nbecome considerably more dangerous and difficult in many\nparts of the world in recent years\" (p. 5). These, among other\nconcerns, appear to have prompted the protection of media\npractitioners from assault and harassment, which became so\npertinent that it received attention at major global summits\nsuch as the U.N. Security and Human Rights Councils in\nLissosky & Henrichsen, 2011). These resolutions, on one\nhand, affected Africa positively, and cases of smooth state\u00ad\nmedia relations are evident (VonDoepp & Young, 2013). On\nthe other hand, journalists in some parts of the continent,\nespecially those who carry recording devices to take photos\nand video shots, are confronted with dangerous security\nthreats because they become targets for security agencies\nwho want to suppress footage of brutalities meted out to pro-\ntesters. For instance, cameras are either confiscated or\ndestroyed in such encounters (Keita, 2011; VonDoepp &\nYoung, 2013), as witnessed in the Liberian and Sierra\nLeonean civil wars that saw 16 journalists dead in each coun-\ntry while many newspaper and radio outlets were set ablaze.\nAlso, justice was not served for the murder of editors Norbert\nFaso and Gambia, respectively, despite the efforts of the\nMedia Foundation for West Africa (MFWA) (Karikari,\n2011). In addition, the International Federation of Journalists\n(IFJ) report indicated that the police (government) in the\nPhilippines had not done enough to prosecute those who\nmurder journalists because of 55 cases uncovered, only one\nhad been convicted over a 20-year period amid situations\nwhere some police personnel were identified as prime sus-\npects of cases of murder. Prior to the demise of many media\npractitioners, most practitioners had received threat mes-\nsages through anonymous phone calls and texts (Noonan,\n2005). For example, Norbert Zongo received several death\n1Takoradi Technical University, Takoradi, Ghana\n2University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa\nCorresponding Author:\nJacob Nyarko, Faculty of Applied Arts & Technology, Graphics\nDepartment, Takoradi Technical University, Post Office Box 256,\nTakoradi, Western Region, Ghana.\nIntimidation, Assault, and Violence\nAgainst Media Practitioners in Ghana:\nConsidering Provocation\nJacob Nyarko1 and Ufuoma Akpojivi2\n Keywords\nassault, media, security services, communities, provocation\n2 SAGE Open\nthreats before his brutal murder (Tettey, 2001). The\nCommittee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) indicated that gener-\nally more than 94% of assaults on media practitioners were\nnot investigated at all (Elliott et al., 2012). This state of\naffairs appears to suggest that most practitioners work under\nfear, which tends to affect the independence and develop-\nment of the profession. Furthermore, in other places such as\nIsrael, Colombia, Iraq, Sri Lanka, Lebanon, Afghanistan,\nYemen, and Pakistan, assault and murder of journalists have\n2012), and these appear to have continued till present. War\nregions are fundamentally dangerous locations and this puts\nsome media practitioners under more risk than others with\nrespect to fears emanating from serious injury and death.\nLargely, journalists are assaulted and sometimes lynched\nwhile on assignment (Taback & Coupland, 2006; Tumber &\nGhana in Focus\nBeyond being the first country to attain self-rule in Africa,\nGhana has weaved itself through different governance sys-\ntems and made strides to stabilize democratic rule since\n1992, a quality that has credited the country as a model of\ndemocracy on the African continent. At the core of this his-\ntoric feat is a vibrant media, whose role has been indispens-\nable to the sustenance of democracy up to today, and thus,\nthe need for them to work in a safe environment should be\nFreedom, which placed the country in the \"free\" category\nGhana's media freedom status worsened to 26th in the same\nranking index. Furthermore, in a compilation of freedom of\nexpression (FoE) violations such as arrests, attacks and\nthreats, fines, and imprisonment among 16 countries in West\nAfrica in the first quarter of 2014, Ghana recorded the high-\nest cases (eight) of the 25 overall media violations. This\nprompted the MFWA to issue a statement about the growing\nspate of attacks and harassment on media practitioners\n(Mordy, 2014). Subsequently, various media associations\nand regulatory bodies comprised of the National Media\nCommission (NMC), Ghana Journalists Association (GJA),\nGhana Independent Broadcaster's Association (GIBA), and\nthe Private Newspaper Publishers Association of Ghana\n(PRINPAG), jointly conveyed a press conference in this\nregard (Jafaru, 2014). For instance, journalists of the\nMultimedia Group and TV3 crew were harassed by security\nofficers when they were taking shots of demolition of some\nhuman settlements on purported encroached lands in the\ncapital to publish the living condition of residents after the\noperation by the Accra and Tema Metropolitan Assemblies.\nIn addition, there have been reports of assaults on the media\nby members of the public including active politicians. In as\nmuch as media laws and the political orientation of a country\npose some challenges to the establishment of media freedom\nglobally, media analysts in Ghana tend to attribute the coun-\ntry's dwindling ranking on the World Press Freedom Index to\nincreasing instances of assault in the landscape. Similarly,\nthe United States attributed their drop on the World Media\nFreedom ranking mainly to the arrest of scores of practitio-\nners--broadcast, print, web, blogging, and live streaming--\nat \"Occupy Wall Street\" protests across the United States,\nand the intimidation of other practitioners by baton and gun-\nwielding police officers during a NATO summit in Chicago\n(Madsen, 2012). Thus, it appears that the very society the\nfourth estate represents as its mouthpiece is constantly\nassaulting and frustrating their efforts in ensuring that soci-\nety functions well. To Tumber and Webster (2006), the\nclampdown on media practitioners is an assault on democ-\nracy. The current study subjects media practitioners in Ghana\nto qualitative interrogation with respect to intimidation,\nassault, and violence in the landscape, and intends to identify\ntheir sources and the extent to which this informs their auton-\nomy and development, public tranquility, and coexistence.\nThis would help inform policy on the general development\nof media.\nLiterature\nThe critical function of the media to inform and educate soci-\nety, set agenda, and influence public opinion makes it a pre-\ncarious profession. For instance, amid the turbulent political\nlandscape of Nepal, journalists were threatened or some-\ntimes killed for writing about a subject or refusing to do so,\nand these plots occasionally extend to their relatives who\nbecome targets for possible attack (Neupane & Zeng, 2014).\nIt is equally difficult to understand how journalists can be\nharassed, imprisoned, tortured or killed mainly for their\ndisagreement with those in power or for expressing opposing or\noften just different views. Is it that those who hold power, or\nseek power or who wish to preserve that power, do so at all\ncosts, even the cost of human life? (p. 6)\nThus, public office holders employ violent tactics such as\narrest and physical violence, to inhibit media practitioners\nfrom conveying stories about armed violence and its reper-\ncussions (Tumber & Webster, 2006). Moreover, the nature of\ntheir job in many situations exposed practitioners to these\nhazards because their assignments normally take them to\nenvironments where the likelihood of violence breaking out\nis high, such as the stadia, massive demonstrations, and pro-\nthe provocative theory and drawing on a data set that spans\nexplained the state of assault and harassment of the fourth\nestate in Africa from the perspective of what drives govern-\nment to stifle flow of information over time. They showed\nthat assault heightens in media when governments (a) sought\nNyarko and Akpojivi 3\nconstitutional amendment to prolong their stay in office, (b)\nincites series of protests and (c) masterminds coup plots.\nNeupane and Zeng (2014) investigated how Nepali journal-\nists have fared after the Constituent Assembly election in\n2008 through in-depth interviews drawn from print, broad-\ncast, and online media platforms. Their findings revealed\nthat beyond media freedom protection stipulated in the\nInterim Constitution, journalists remained confronted with\nthreats and assaults attributed to what they write. Moreover,\nsecurity forces, minority groups, and media owners exert\npressure on journalists, and government has done less to pro-\ntect them. The influence of religious bodies and political\nfanatics are strong factors because coverage of sensitive sub-\njects such as religious beliefs and corruption have triggered\nattacks on journalists if entities involved feel offended. The\nfears of violent attacks make media practitioners cautious in\ntheir reportage of these subjects, which eventually leads to\nself-censorship (Hanitzsch & Hidayat, 2012). The state of\nassault on media practitioners appears to be worst in conflict\nzones, and writing on \"A Story to Die for,\" Bridge (2004)\ncautioned,\nPrepare yourself mentally. Garner knowledge about where you\nare going and what you may be faced with and seek out trusted\ncontacts and fixers in the country. And remember that common\nsense is an important survival tool. And if it really does go\nhorribly wrong? Well, nobody forced you to be a journalist. (p.\nThe position of Bridge reiterates the experience of Chris\nAyres of The Times when he found himself entangled with the\nMarines during the 2003 Iraq Invasion and commented, \"I\nfound myself in a circumstance where I was absolutely terri-\nfied beyond belief since I just thought that there was a fair\nchance that we'd die, or get captured\" (Tumber & Webster,\nKoutsompolis (2014) examined victimization at the work-\nplace and the degree of fear of crime among media practitio-\nners using a sample of 635 practicing media professionals.\nTheir findings showed that physical victimization is common\nin the workplace and journalists whose roles are \"news sourc-\ning\" and \"photography\" experienced higher fears of physical\nand verbal attacks, threats, and stolen or damaged property.\nMelki and Mallat (2014) used a mixed method to examine the\nmarginalization of female journalists in the Arab world and\ntheorized that a number of factors such as sexual harassment\nand absence of enabling legal and social setting jointly dis-\ncourage, prevent, or push females out of the media profes-\nsion. Moreover, females who have proved successful in the\njob are assigned to roles that exclude them from decision and\npolicy determination. Their findings also showed that global\ncultural and institutional practices dating back to centuries are\nfully operational in media establishments in Lebanon and the\nArab world. In his paper, \"Journalists as Citizens,\" Whittle\nWe have to be free to gather news and views to serve the society\nof which we, too, are a part . . . we cannot afford to be thought\nof as an extension of the police service or the intelligence\nagencies. We need people to talk to us. The public need to have\naccess to that information. The public interest is better served by\nour being able to report what is happening and get inside the\nminds of people. That becomes impossible if every step is\ndogged with the threat of police raids and seizures of journalistic\nFrom the position of Whittle, freedom of media practitioners\nto collect information from the public to help advocate the\ninterest of society is central to the media profession, and he\nestablished that the media should not be misconstrued as an\nintegral part of the security services. Taback and Coupland\n(2006) investigated security of media practitioners, and con-\ncluded that media reports from conflict zones can provide a\nmeaningful database on the effect of armed violence on vul-\nnerable groups, including journalists, to enhance human\nsecurity. They maintained that media documentation and\nsubsequent publication is the surest means to convey infor-\nmation to the international community to influence policy\ndirection on human security. In Haiti, verbal and other forms\nof abuse against practitioners in public are on the rise for\nposing a question to public officials. Haiti's president Michel\nMartelly ignored a question, and upon persistence by the\njournalist, he remarked, \"Look, if you persist, I'll insult you\nand your mama!\" Following this, a young female journalist's\nquestion about unfulfilled previous campaign promises at his\nparty rally in July 2015, the president said, \"I came to talk to\nyou; you must listen,\" and then he added, \"W$%re! If you\nwant to have s*x, find yourself a man to!@ck you behind the\nwall! I'm ready to!@ck you on the podium!\" George Fortun\u00e9,\na Haitian journalist, was also assaulted violently in November\n2014 by a policeman in the presence of a public official, and\nthe ordeal photographed as a threat to other journalists who\nmight want to cover the protests (Chery, 2015). At a forum in\nWashington, These Times reporter Mike Elk's microphone\nwas seized and unlawfully detained by a Honeywell official\nafter he asked the Honeywell CEO about his firm's environ-\nmental policies. In the recent attempted coup in Turkey, sol-\ndiers seized several broadcasting newsrooms and coerced\nTijen Karas at gunpoint to read a televised statement.\nMoreover, while there are growing incidences of assault\nagainst purported opposition newspaper Hurriyet in Turkey,\nprogovernment media practitioners also participated in the\ncampaign against the paper (Yeginsu, 2015). By this, politics\nseem to have broken the formidable front of the media in\ntheir effort to eradicate assault and violence on the\ninstitution.\nProvocation Theory\nThis work utilizes the provocation theory. Farrington (2011)\nasserts that \"provocation\" is a \"perceived attack on a person's\n4 SAGE Open\nor (his or her significant other's) property, security or self-\nrespect encouraging an unlawful response. It occurs in\nresponse to frictions\" (p. 218). Furthermore, Lord Holt in\n1707 stated that four main activities legally constitute suffi-\ncient provocation: \"(1) hearing angry words followed by a\nphysical assault; (2) seeing a friend being assaulted; (3)\nobserving a citizen detained by force; and (4) seeing one's\nother theories, the theory of provocation has become interdis-\nciplinary. In law, it is traced to the 12th century (Berman,\n2011), and has also been applied extensively in the natural\nsciences and the creative arts. Whereas in the natural sci-\nences, provocation encapsulates the introduction of a provok-\ning stimulus into a controlled setting to enable the investigator\nto draw inferences about the features of the stimulus under\nstudy, it is applied in the creative arts to provoke reaction and\nemotions in the audience, or to activate new ideas and per-\nspectives on daily practices and objects (Pangrazio, 2016).\nProvocation may not always be direct. In the indirect sense,\npersons can be provoked to aggression by social exclusion,\ncirculated rumors about them, among others (Warburton &\nAnderson, 2015). But it appears that provocation is the most\nsingular activator of aggression (Bettencourt, Talley,\nBenjamin, & Valentine, 2006). However, the terms aggres-\nsion and violence have been misconstrued as being the same.\nViolence is aggression that is intended to cause harm extreme\nenough to require medical attention or to cause death. Thus,\nall violent behavior is aggression, but most aggression is not\nviolence (Warburton & Anderson, 2015). Due to the nature of\nprovocative examination aimed to produce a response to\ndetermine the effect of a stimulus (Pangrazio, 2016), breaches\nof ethical concerns have been raised because participants may\nbe unaware that they are under observation. Writing on\nGuardian Online, Chris Chambers (2014) questioned the eth-\nical basis of the joint study by Facebook and Cornell\nUniversity on \"Emotional Contagion\" because Facebook\nusers were unaware that they were being monitored. However,\nthe current study draws on past experiences of media practi-\ntioners in the field to examine how the three entities men-\ntioned above responded. Provocation is rarely used in the\nsocial sciences; it enables the researcher to focus on how a\nparticular social phenomenon affects the individual and soci-\nety more broadly (Pangrazio, 2016), hence the need for its\napplication in this study.\nBy the use of provocation theory, this work intends to\ndetermine whether the actions of some media practitioners\nand/or the nature of their profession trigger intimidation and\nassault on them by some actors in society.\nResearch Questions\nResearch Question 1: What are the sources of intimida-\ntion, assault, and violence against media practitioners?\nResearch Question 2: What factors provoke intimida-\ntion, assault, and violence against media practitioners?\nResearch Question 3: Should media practitioners be\nblamed for their assault?\nMethod\nData for this study were sourced from individuals who could\ncomment constructively on the state of the Ghanaian media\nwith respect to intimidation, assault, and violence against\nmedia practitioners under the country's fourth republic.\nInformed consent was obtained from individual media out-\nlets, associations, and regulatory bodies. Participants were\npurposively selected based on the following inclusion crite-\nria: (a) participant is a qualified media practitioner, (b) par-\nticipant is at the time of this study in full-time practice, (c)\npractitioner identifies with either the state or a privately\nowned media outlet, (d) practitioner had a minimum working\nexperience of 10 years and more, (d) participating media\nprofessional bodies should be advocates of media freedom\nand expression, and (e) participant lives within the Greater\nAccra Region of Ghana. For representative purposes, the\nsample was composed of reporters who mainly go into the\nfield to gather news. This also includes editors and represen-\ntatives of media regulators and journalist associations\nbecause these bodies monitor activities of the media and are\nthe first point of call to report incidences of violence. These\ncriteria made them resourceful enough with respect to issues\nof the media to critically comment on the subject under\ninvestigation. Fifteen (N = 15) participants who met the\nabove criteria individually also gave consent to grant inter-\nviews at various locations of their preference. The study\nadopted a semistructured interview design that enabled\ninformants to have flexibility to express their views beyond\nspecific questions in an exploratory fashion. Also, this inter-\nview structure ensured that the core facts of an issue were\nunearthed and the participants were experienced enough to\ndo. Questions include the following: (a) Have you ever been\na victim of assault in the field and by whom? (b) Have you\never reported from a violent or crime scene? Who are those\ninvolved and what was your experience? (c) In your opinion,\nwhich group(s) of people normally assaults the media? (d)\nWhat do you think triggers assault on practitioners? All\ninformants consented to have their verbal responses recorded.\nAnalysis\nThe study employed the inductive approach to the qualitative\ndata analysis process as hypothesized by Thomas (2003).\nThis approach is effective and convenient for analyzing data\nand allows \"research findings to emerge from the frequent,\ndominant or significant themes inherent in raw data, without\nthe restraints imposed by structured methodologies\"\n(Thomas, 2003, p. 2). The use of a qualitative interpretivist\napproach gave the opportunity for the researcher in the cur-\nrent study to connect with respondents and to view the world\nfrom their perspective (Corbin & Strauss, 2015). After data\nNyarko and Akpojivi 5\ntranscription of audio-taped interviews by the researcher, the\nfollowing processes were followed to guide the entire\nresearch: First, preparation and organization of raw data files\nwas carried out where the imported electronic text was\ncleaned using Microsoft Word. This involves overall format-\nting with respect to font size, highlighting interview ques-\ntions and their accompanying responses to ensure clarity and\nlegibility, orderliness, and finally printing a hard copy.\nSecond, detailed reading of the text (responses) was done,\nand the former stage made it convenient to be familiar with\nthe content and understand probable themes. Third, catego-\nries were developed by taking the study's research questions\ninto consideration. Categories were identified at both the\nupper and lower levels of the coding process. The former\nconsidered the general aspect of the study where six catego-\nries emerged and the latter, which is more specific, helped to\nnarrow down the categories into four. Fourth, text that over-\nlapped at the third stage in the process of coding was recoded\nto fit the four major themes and those that still fell outside the\ndomain of the research questions were stored in a separate\nfile for future reference. Final reorganization and redefini-\ntion of the categories were undertaken but no subcategories\nwere identified in the responses. The process of thematizing\neventually turned out three major themes, and the findings\nwere presented narratively.\nResult and Discussion\nAssault and harassment of media practitioners in Ghana's\nlandscape emanates from three major spheres. These include\nsecurity agencies, communities/individual citizens, and party\nsupporters. Although the media operates autonomously of\nthe aforementioned entities, the regular flow of uninterrupted\ninformation between the media (the fourth estate) and the\nthree major players is critical to their coexistence, and hence\nthe effective functioning of the media.\nSecurity Agencies\nSecurity agencies have attacked journalists (Foerstel, 2006;\nmedia scene is no exception. Security men in their official\nregalia attack media practitioners and confiscate and destroy\ntheir cameras provoked by the following claims: (a) the jour-\nnalists have caused obstruction at the court during proceed-\nings and (b) were taking photographs of persons who were at\nthe center of court cases. Although the informant reckons\nthat these attacks do not occur regularly in the landscape, he\nconcurs that some journalists were held at the office of the\nBNI (Bureau of National Investigation) and released in the\nevening for the alleged offense of \"disturbing proceedings at\nthe court.\" Likewise, a female journalist was almost left nude\nduring the process. The office of the BNI in Ghana, like the\nFBI in the United States, handles and deals with very serious\ncrime situations that require in-depth intelligence and inves-\ntigations. By this, the detention of media practitioners at the\nBNI instead of the police station shows the extent of media-\nsecurity services relations with respect to intimidation and\nassault. This situation seems uncharacteristic of Ghana con-\nsidering her growing democracy. The informant noted that\nthe sensitivity of an issue, especially those with high public\ninterest, determines the level of security interference in the\nfunctions of the media.\nOccasionally it [assault] happens. Some of my reporters were\nbeaten in court by state officials in state security apparatus and\ncameras were seized. We were covering a case that takes high\ninterests. It was about a policewoman who had taken the state to\ncourt and obviously it takes hard interest so we wanted to take\nthe photo of the woman and they prevented us from taking the\nshot, seized our cameras and smashed them . . . Yes, it happened.\nAt a point they [the policemen] said we were obstructing [court\nsitting] so they wanted to get us [journalists] out of court but\nthey couldn't after realising that would be a big mistake. Some\nof the reporters were even detained at the BNI office for some\nhours and released late in the evening so we [journalists] face\nchallenges. One of my lady reporters was virtually stripped . . .\nYes! It happened in Ghana.\nFurthermore, another informant reiterated that security ser-\nvices, chiefly the police, army, and \"macho men,\" some-\ntimes assault media practitioners. Macho men in the\nGhanaian context are \"body builders\" who due to their phy-\nsique, are normally recruited as private security guards. This\ninformant explained an incident where official security men\nescorting a foreign delegation to Ghana harassed and\ndetained a photojournalist at the police station because they\nfound a liquid medicine on him. Although these attacks have\nalso occurred at other places, the respondent also hinted that\nthere is an element of provocation from the media, and that\ninforms why security personnel assault them because occa-\nsionally journalists go beyond boundaries set by the security\nservices and enter \"no go areas.\" Considering the fact that\nregular encounters between media and the security agencies\nare inevitable due to the nature of their job functions, this\ninformant proposes a relationship that should be built on\ninterdependence so that in the event of misunderstanding, it\ncould be resolved to forestall future incidences of assault.\nThis reflects the theorization that conflict begins as a dis-\nagreement, confrontation, escalation, de-escalation, and is\nfinally resolved (Botezat, Dobrescu, & Toomescu, 2007).\nAlthough the CPJ revealed that 94% of assaults on media\npractitioners are left uninvestigated (Elliott et al., 2012),\nfindings from the current study show that media assault\ncases in Ghana undergo investigation, and in some instances,\nsecurity agencies render apologies whenever they occurred.\nThe comment below confirms:\nWe have had some instances where policemen or military people\nor \"macho men\" have attacked and assaulted media people.\n6 SAGE Open\nQuiet recently, an Israeli foreign minister came to Ghana and\nthere was a photographer who was covering them and he had a\nlocal liquid medication on him. Apparently the state security\napparatus had allowed it but when he went through the security\ncheckpoint, the security officers accompanying the visiting\ndelegation arrested and detained him at the police station after\nbeing harassed. This incident underwent investigation.\nMoreover, there were other areas where journalists have been\nabused.\n. . .\nAt times, journalists too will trespass and go to areas they have\nbeen asked not to. Thus, there is the need for better relationship\nbetween the security agencies and the media. I think regular\nconsultations will help build a good relationship between\njournalists and the security agencies which should be symbiotic.\nOnce we have infractions and come to a compromise, I think we\ncould arrest some of these happenings. In the above incident,\nboth the Chief of Defense Staff and the District Commander of\nPolice whose station the journalist was detained at apologised.\nIn a related scenario, an editor of a media outlet explained\nthat though he has not suffered such attacks personally, his\nreporters and other journalists have been victims. He\nrecounted an incident that occurred at the Independence\nSquare in which his photojournalist was cruelly assaulted by\npersonnel of the army. This incident generated into a major\nissue and occupied the agenda of the said media house till the\nmilitary compensated the journalist. It appears that the media\nitself, with its publicity function, wields the power to the\ngreatest extent to lessen and/or eradicate incidences of\nassault because the perpetrators (security services, citizens,\nand partisan groups) abhor negative publicity from the media\nand will deter future attacks. On the Ghanaian National\nCalendar, March 6 marks the country's independence from\ncolonial rule in 1957, and it is celebrated yearly nationwide.\nThis ceremony subjects the ability of media and security ser-\nvices to coexist amicably to test. From the view of this infor-\nmant, many media outlets in Ghana equally have worries\nabout the state of assault by security men.\nPersonally! No [I have never been assaulted], but my colleagues\nand officers who go out on assignment are sometimes physically\nassaulted. On 6 March 2013 at the Independence Square, one of\nmy photographers was brutally assaulted by the military and it\nbecame a major issue that we had to take the military to task for.\nWe published a lot of stories about it and eventually our\nphotographer had to be compensated by the Military High\nCommand. Throughout Ghana, I know that other media\ninstitutions have cause to complain about harassment from\npublic officials.\nJournalists attacked by security officials and other groups\nwere often betrayed by the very instruments they work with\nsuch as audio and video recorders. This is consistent with\nother studies that showed that media roles, which involve\nnews gathering and camera handling, have a high chance of\nbeing attacked physically, verbally, or their property vandal-\n2013). For instance, in Uganda, journalist Joshua Mutale\nwho works for Radio Simba was attacked by the police while\ninterviewing women protesting against increased police\nassault. Mutale commented,\nI was recording the voices of the women with a recorder in one\narm and a set of earphones in another when a policeman I hardly\nidentified appeared and pepper sprayed me in my eyes using a\nhand spray. I fell down and was helped by fellow journalists. It\nwas surprising that I was the only victim of the attack. (Human\nRights Network for Journalists-Uganda, 2012)\nIt appears that practitioner Mutale was the sole target of\nassault because the equipment he carried easily betrayed\nhim. The advent of sophisticated miniature multimedia\ndevices offers a wide range of new recording experiences in\nthis age; however, the media still fall prey to the handling of\nhuge visible recorders. This situation shows that despite the\neducation of the security services in Africa by international\nsecurity forces such as the U.S. Africa Command\n(AFRICOM), attacks on media practitioners persist (Keita,\nThe security services are institutions of government\nwhose training, besides defense, is grounded in both civil\nand criminal laws of every land. In Ghana, for instance, most\npeople have \"nick-named\" the police and/or military \"Aban\"\nmeaning government because they perceive them as the\ndirect representative of the government within the society\nand as the executors of the law. This notion of the public\nseems to produce a positive effect of tranquility and coexis-\ntence among society players, otherwise depending on the\nprofessional conduct of the security services. Thus, when-\never the law enforcement agencies (police/military) flout the\nlaw and assault the media, the other civilian players (citizens\nand party sympathizers) do not feel restrained from attacking\nthe media either in their encounters with them. Like Ghana,\nmany democratic nations across Africa and the world have\naccorded the media a legally guaranteed status of \"fourth\nestate\"; the 21st-century media practitioner could still be\ndescribed as a \"lone-ranger\" and unprotected because the\nvery state institution (police) they seek refuge in the event of\nassault by other society actors are also perpetrators. This\nappears to have created some sort of a \"chain of assault reac-\ntion\" within the public sphere emanating first from the secu-\nrity/intelligence agencies, then by ordinary citizens and party\nenthusiasts.\nCommunities/Individual Citizens\nApart from public officials, especially security agents, who\nassault media practitioners, local communities and individu-\nals also attack media practitioners (Arnaldo et al., 1998).\nNyarko and Akpojivi 7\nAlthough the informant below reiterated that such assault\nand intimidation are uncommon in Ghana, they happen inter-\nmittently. He recounted an incident where local inhabitants\nof a community in the BrongAhafo region of Ghana attacked\na radio outlet on the claim that it flouted orders of their tradi-\ntional ruler (King) who attempted to censor the program of\nthe station. Conversely, Ghana's fourth republican constitu-\ntion provides for media autonomy and abhors any form of\ncensorship. The structure of African societies is such that\nchieftaincy is at the core of defined communities, and the\nmassive loyalty, rulers command from their subjects, tends to\npose a challenge to the coexistence of constitutional and\nchieftaincy authority. It appears that in such settings, refusal\nto abide by the orders of the king is interpreted as disrespect\nto authority irrespective of the supremacy of the constitution\nand its position on said matters. Communities and/or some of\nits members even go to the extent of occasionally assaulting\nentities that criticize the sitting government because they are\naffiliates of the party and feel offended.\nPhysical violence against journalists and photographers in\nGhana is rather rare. These attacks occur from time to time and\nare typically isolated incidents. For instance there was a case\nwhere youth attacked a radio station in Brong Ahafo region for\nnot obeying the orders of their chief [king] who apparently tried\nto censor the station. Local communities sometimes detain,\narrest, or harass critics of the government.\nThe situation becomes even more challenging when state\nofficials do not condemn such behavior but rather take the\nstance that further incites communities against media practi-\ntioners. This threatens and aggravates their already precari-\nous working environment. For instance, in Kenya, Assistant\nMinister Fred Gumo repeatedly commented, \"Luhya jour-\nnalists who write negative stories against leaders from their\ncommunity will be beaten.\" Speaking to journalists in Busia\n(another town), the office of the President Assistant Minister\nsaid his recent threat was not a joke and should be taken seri-\nrenowned Ghanaian politician remarked, power to rule\nbelongs solely to the kings but they have decided to sit on the\nfence to give some leeway to democracy. Thus, the media\nalways suffers whenever the political front and chieftaincy\nseem married.\nThe informant below identified the court as one of the\nplaces where individual members of society attack media\npractitioners because they take pictures of their acquain-\ntances who are suspects in specific cases for publication.\nThis informant cited an incident at the court where Mr.\nAgude, a former presidential candidate of the Convention\nPeople's Party (CPP) in Ghana (the then suspect), assaulted a\nphotojournalist because he was taking a shot of him. To this\ninformant, apart from the security services, ordinary mem-\nbers of the public also attack media practitioners because\nthey likened them to the work of the paparazzi (see quote\nbelow). This finding is consistent with the definition of\n\"arrest, assault and attack\" of journalists, as \"physical incar-\nceration or harm, including--for example, death threats--\ndirected at journalists in the course of their work\" (Ross,\n1999, p. 6) without distinguishing whether such acts of\nassaults were perpetrated by official or nonofficial actors.\nRoss further noted, \"A physical threat is a physical threat,\nregardless of who administers it.\"\nThere have been situations where private people [citizens] have\nhad problems with journalists because they had taken\nphotographs of their friends or colleagues so they engaged them\nin some sort of quarrel. Such incidents occur in court proceedings\nwhere family members of a suspect engage the media in\nunhealthy attacks because they think you [the journalist] want to\nexpose their relation. For instance, a photojournalist was\nmanhandled by Mr. Agude at the court. This scenario shows that\nindividuals also do assault journalists.\nIn related incidences, a female journalist and another pho-\ntojournalist of a newspaper outlet were attacked just in front\nof their office in Accra and Tamale, the northern regional\ncapital city of Ghana, respectively, while trying to cover a\nconfusion that broke out. This informant also narrated an\nincident where colleagues of Castro, a Ghanaian music artist\nwho went missing in a river in Ada (a town on the coast of\nthe Greater Accra Region of Ghana), manhandled journalists\nfrom Joy FM and Ghana Broadcasting Corporation claim-\ning that they had visited the town to take shots of them. By\nthis comment, it can be said violence meted out on media\npractitioners while in the field have not stopped in Ghana:\nA lady photojournalist of our newspaper was assaulted right in\nfront of our building when she attempted to take a shot of a\ncommotion. Apart from this, one of our photographers was also\nphysically assaulted and his camera smashed in Tamale. By this,\nit is not only officials who attack media practitioners, but\nindividual members of the public also attack. Quite recently, a\nGhanaian musician got drowned in the Ada River, and some\njournalists trying to report on the search for the artist after he\nwas reported missing were attacked by that same group of\npeople believed to have gone there with the victim. They\nmolested some of the reporters for coming there to take pictures\nof them. So, physical violence in the line of duty is still on.\nFurthermore, other incidences where individuals or\ngroups have attacked media were evident. For example,\nBishop Daniel Obinim, the general overseer of International\nGod's Way Church and another two pastors stormed the\npremises of Accra-based Hot FM, vandalized and attacked\nthe program host and panelists on the claim that their discus-\nsion offended and provoked him (\"Bishop Obinim Runs\nAmok,\" 2011). A female journalist, Afia Pokuah, who works\nfor Adom FM was beaten by Israel Kwame Layea and a\ncoworker of the Ablekuma Branch of the National Health\nInsurance Scheme (NHIS) in Accra; they seized her recorder\n8 SAGE Open\nwhen she went there with other journalists to enquire why\nthe registration process for the issuance of the scheme's iden-\ntity cards was delayed (Sarpong, 2014). Also, Daily Graphic\nJournalist, Daniel Kenu was attacked by Baffour Gyan, the\nbrother of Ghana Black Star captain Asamoah Gyan and\nsome groups (GIBA, 2017). Ironically, \"where journalists\nare most in danger is where journalists' work is most impor-\ntant for promoting human security\" (Tumber & Webster,\nthat media practitioners are devoted to ensuring their secu-\nrity by conveying information about their plight to the larger\nlocal, national, and international communities, are invariably\npersecuting the media. Thus, on a continuum of interests, the\norientation of each society player is utterly different and an\nunderstanding of these postures will help ensure coexistence\nwithin the public sphere. Whereas the media has a public\ninterest objective, the other public, whose interests the media\nadvances, rather have a self-protection interest, shield infor-\nmation, and react negatively on the least purported\nprovocation.\nParty Supporters\nLoyalists of a political party are another group of people who\ncollectively or individually have had encounters with the\nmedia. Describing the media's relationship with affiliates of\npolitical parties, this informant recalled an incident where a\ncolleague he accompanied to a press conference of the\nNational Democratic Congress (NDC) after it lost the 2000\nPresidential elections was consistently interrupted and\nharassed by supporters while interviewing a leading func-\ntionary of the party. The informant explained that eventually,\nthey ran away because party supporters assaulted them with\npure water. \"Pure water\" in the Ghanaian context is potable\npackaged sachet water sold at many vantage points and it is\ndemeaning to be beaten with it. From the view of this infor-\nmant, there appears to be an element of media\u00adpartisan\nalignment situation in the media landscape, where party\nenthusiasts target and harass media practitioners they per-\nceive as critical of their government or flag bearer. In\nBangladesh, for instance, media and politics are connected\nand violence against the media is perpetuated by the youth\nwing of political parties when they perceive a report to be\nmalicious (Ross, 1999). In Turkey, the president's speech\nagainst purported opposition media outlets provoked his fol-\nlowers to storm the Hurriyet publications headquarters,\nsmash windows, and chant profanities (Yeginsu, 2015). This\nis consistent with Lord Holt's 1707 argument that provoca-\ntion is triggered by hearing angry words (Madsen, 2012).\nAlthough brutal assaults of practitioners have reduced in\nGhana, members of political parties continue to assault them.\nI remember I had a personal experience when the NDC lost\npower in 2000. They [the NDC party] had a press conference at\nthe Trade Fair Center and I went there with a friend who was\nthen working with a Kumasi-based FM radio. At that time they\n[the party] had lost the election and were bitter and against that\nFM station. When this guy [my colleague journalist] began\ninterviewing a senior member of the NDC, I saw some of these\nparty enthusiasts heckling and pushing him so I tried to separate\nthem but they threw \"pure water\" at us so the guy [journalist]\nhad to quickly run into a taxi and I also ran away. At their press\nconference when they know that you are a so-called unfriendly\njournalist, you see some of the party supporters and members\nheckling you. Some will even drive you away. In as much as that\nkind of violence coupled with molestation and brutality has\nbecome minimal, party people still harass journalists.\nCriticality of media reporting informs the reactions of party\naffiliates toward media practitioners. This informant narrated\nthree occasions where political party supporters attacked\nmedia practitioners in Ghana. First, Peter Apesewu, who\nworks for Insight and is critical of the National Patriotic\nParty (NPP), was attacked at the head office of the party.\nSecond, Raymond Archer, a former editor of the Enquirer\nand also critical of the NPP administration, received verbal\nthreats and his vehicle was damaged by alleged supporters of\nthe same party. Third, some reporters at a press conference of\nthe NPP after it was defeated in the 2012 elections were\nassaulted. Beyond these, whenever party supporters embark\non a protest, they assault journalists.\nSympathisers of the NPP attacked some journalists. One\njournalist called Peter Apesewu with Insight who was very\ncritical of the NPP government went to interview the party\nchairman, Haruna Sekou at the party headquarters and he was\nattacked by supporters. I also remember that, Raymond Archer,\nwho was then an editor of the Enquirer Newspaper and very\ncritical of the NPP government was also threatened verbally and\nsome people suspected to be members of the NPP even attacked\nhis car and destroyed it partly. These incidences of assaults on\njournalists went quiet until recently when the NPP lost the 2012\nelections and some journalists going to cover a press conference\nat the flag-bearer's residence were brutalised by some party\nmembers. These situations also happen during demonstrations\nby partisan groups.\nThe recurrence of attacks on the media after political parties\n(NDC and NPP) lost elections is a caution to practitioners to\nbe extra cautious during and after the declaration of election\nresults. In Burkina Faso, the CEO of a private radio outlet,\nHorizon FM, was attacked by party loyalists of the Congress\nfor Democracy and Progress Party (CDPP) triggered by\nsharp utterance during the station's phone-in program dubbed\nSondage Democratique that enables listeners to contribute to\nthis, generally, the job description of media practitioners\nmakes them vulnerable to violent environments such as the\nparty rallies, press conferences, national ceremonies such as\nswearing-in of presidents, independence day celebrations,\nand reporting from war fronts. Due to the risky nature of the\nNyarko and Akpojivi 9\njob while in the field, Bridge (2004) opined that one needs to\nbe ready mentally before becoming a journalist.\nRecounting on the lapses of the newfound democratic\nsystem in Africa and elsewhere on the globe, Karikari (2011)\nreiterated, \"the excitement of a new dawn of media freedom,\nautonomy and pluralism was now turning into a nightmare of\nfear, torture and the threat of death\" (p. 141). In Nepal, secu-\nrity services, minority groups, and owners harass journalists\n(Neupane & Zeng, 2014). Also, religious bodies and their\nbelief systems, followers of political parties, and corruption\nare complex subjects that spark attacks on media practitio-\nners. For purposes of safety from assault, journalists tend to\nreport cautiously (Hanitzsch & Hidayat, 2012), which affects\ntheir independence and subsequently their development. By\nthis, provocation becomes evident in situations where people\nhold divergent views. Thus, people or groups that share simi-\nlar values and ideologies are less likely to be provoked and\nvice versa. Debunking what seems to be the perception of\nmany people with regard to the source(s) of assault and vio-\nlence against media practitioners, a senior practitioner\nargued,\nMany times we [media associations and regulatory bodies] have\nissued statements that these [assaults and violence] are not from\nofficialdom. These are not official positions of the government\nwhether NPP or NDC but rather by organisations or individuals.\nFor instance, you will get a policeman attacking a journalist and\nordinary citizens do the same in a demonstration. I remember an\ninstance where some workers were demonstrating in Takoradi\nHarbour and they picked up one Daily Graphic journalist.\nObviously, it wasn't the government that said they should do it.\nSo, this kind of intervention by people, yes, it happens once in a\nwhile and we [media associations and regulatory bodies] try to\neducate people that the media is not on anybody's side.\n. . .\nWe have had instances where media personnel have been\nattacked in the line of duty but it is also important to point out\nthat it is never the position of the government; sometimes, not\neven by the hierarchy of the organisation. For instance, the IGP\nmight not have said that when journalists anger you beat them\n. . . No! But some irresponsible policemen who are not smart\nenough to know that they will do harm or out of overzealousness,\nwill go and seize a camera from a journalist because he [the\njournalist] is taking photos of police people doing something\nfishy. That [attack] happens but does not result in killing as in\nsome parts of the world. We are grateful it hasn't come to that\nbut sometimes there are physical attacks on journalists and\nespecially after every election, journalists were beaten.\nTo the above informant, assault of practitioners in the\nGhanaian context are not staged by the government or insti-\ngated by institutional heads such as the Inspector General of\nPolice (IGP) but sometimes done primarily through negli-\ngence by some police officers and other citizens during pro-\ntests. Security officers assault media practitioners, confiscate\nand destroy their recording devices to hide evidence of pos-\nsible brutalities captured on camera. For instance, to hide\nwrongdoing,\nin April 2014, police in Kumasi arrested and detained Muftaw\nMohammed of Metro FM for attempting to take photos of some\npersonnel of the Police Motor Traffic and Transport Unit\n(MTTU) who he suspected to be taking bribes from drivers.\nDespite the occasional incidents of these attacks, the\nGhanaian media has at least contented that no deaths have\nbeen recorded compared with what pertains elsewhere\naround the globe. In the United States, the Illinois\nEavesdropping Act makes it an offense to record actions of a\npolice officer so a media practitioner could face up to 15\nyears in jail for filming protests and actions of the police to\ninform the public (Madsen, 2012). The perception that the\nmedia is a spy for a section of society instead of being the\nfourth estate that serves as the eye of entire society through\nthe execution of its watchdog role requires constant educa-\ntion and conscientization of the public to forestall future\nassaults. This is consistent with a study conducted by Whittle\n(2005), who maintained that the media cannot afford to be\ndeemed as an extension of the security and intelligence\nservices.\nThe study shows that postelection assault and attack on\nmedia practitioners are evident in Ghana especially from the\ncamp of defeated political parties and these possibly\nprompted the need for both the NMC and the GJA to provide\nguideline directives on reporting of elections (GJA, 2011;\nNMC, 1993). In as much as the NMC and GJA require that\nall acts of violence, intimidation, or attack against media per-\nsonnel, their property, or premises are reported to them and\nthe police, the GJA further cautioned,\nJournalists shall not report any allegation about or a dispute at a\npolling station without a comment/reaction from the Electoral\nCommission (EC) or the Returning Officer. Media houses shall\nnot allow or grant interviews concerning allegations against any\nparty candidate without providing equal opportunity to the other\ncandidate to react. Hosts of radio and television programmes\nshould intervene when unsubstantiated allegations are being\nmade by panellists or during phone-ins. (Guideline 16 of GJA\nElectoral Coverage)\nThis guideline appears to show that the media and its\numbrella organizations to some extent reckon that an ele-\nment of probable provocation from practitioners is evident in\nthe landscape and that there is a need to conscientize its\nmembers.\nInstead of assaulting media practitioners, security agencies\nshould rather protect the media against attacks from citizens\nand party supporters on one hand, and also protect the entire\npublic on the other to bring a \"win\u00adwin\" situation in their\ninteraction through information sharing. With this smooth\ninterplay of coexistence, the following becomes evident: (a)\nthe media enjoys a safe environment to work and (b) the\nmedia can easily approach the public (citizens and partisan\ngroups) for its most vital raw material (\"information\") with-\nout which it has no business to exist. This is consistent with\nthe position of Whittle (2005) who explained that the public\nis better served when the media tells them what is happening\nin their communities by getting inside the minds of people,\nand (c) the security agencies stand to benefit from firsthand\ninformation (tip-offs) relayed to them by the media and indi-\nvidual citizens (entire public) for its intelligence work with-\nout which their relevance, like the media, fades in society.\nImplications for Media Industry,\nPractitioners, and Society\nThe work of media practitioners is paramount in every soci-\nety but the extent of their performance is dictated by the\ncooperation they receive from the different facets of the gen-\neral public at whose service the media operates.Although the\nGhanaian media have made strides on the global media free-\ndom rankings such as the Media Sustainability Index (MSI)\nand Reporters Without Borders, the current study shows that\nher landscape continues to witness intermittent physical\nassault and harassment against media practitioners perpetu-\nated mainly by three major entities. First, the activities of the\npolice and other security agencies interfere with the work of\nthe media, for instance, they have been known to seize cam-\neras, tape recorders, manhandle individual practitioners vio-\nlently, among others. The other level is supporters of political\nparties who have attacked journalists because of an assump-\ntion that some practitioners from some stations are hostile to\ntheir party so they do not want them at their events. The last\ngroup that creates problems for the media are alleged crimi-\nnals and other citizens brought before the court. Journalists\ncovering court cases involving alleged offenders and other\npersons have been attacked by the supporters of those under\ntrial when journalists attempted to interview or take photo-\ngraphs of the people who are being tried. The interplay of the\nfourth estate on one hand, and security agencies, individual\ncitizens, and party supporters on the other hand, through\ninformation sharing is a precursor to successful electoral pro-\ncesses especially in Africa.\nMedia practitioners are susceptible to these forms of\nattack because of the nature of their profession, which makes\ntheir constant encounter with the aforementioned entities\ninevitable. Basically, attacks on the media are rooted in the\nperceived notion that the institution is a spy (\"the paparazzi\")\nthat meddles in the privacy of others instead of being viewed\nas a strategic partner who contributes to the overall develop-\nment of society through their unflinching uncovering of\nwrongdoings.\nSome traces of provocation emanating from the camp of\nthe media are evident. The driving forces that necessitate such\nactions are (a) the belief that media is not nonpartisan; (b)\nmedia programs, especially those that host panelists some-\ntimes discuss unsubstantiated issues that offend individuals\nand/or contravene societal norms and values; and (c) the\nmedia sometimes obstructs security measures because practi-\ntioners occasionally go beyond marked security boundaries\nduring national events and other ceremonies. Tracking provo-\ncation from the perspective of ethical lapses, Nyarko and\ncompromised the profession's own integrity and its indepen-\ndence of working in an environment without fear. Moreover,\nin Ghana, practitioners who carry visible multimedia devices\nare the most assaulted and intimidated because their equip-\nment easily makes them stand out. The question of whether\npractitioners should be blamed for assault meted out to them\ntranscends the three aforementioned provocative forces and\nintertwines into the complex facets of society that cannot be\nsatisfied entirely at a point in time. This is because actions\nand nonactions of practitioners still attract provocation. For\ninstance, Neupane and Zeng (2014) noted that practitioners\nhave suffered abuse, torture, and death for \"publishing\" or\n\"desisting to publish\" a story (p. 88). Education of the public\nis imperative in this regard especially with a public that per-\nceives security services as \"government\" due to their role as\nenforcers of the law. By this, some sort of a \"chain of accom-\nmodative reaction\" develops, where if security agencies dem-\nonstrate \"accommodation\" in all encounters with the media,\nthere is a probable chance that ordinary citizens and partisan\ngroups will toe the line. Despite the intermittent incidences of\nassault of media practitioners in Ghana, overall, society\nfrowns on these acts to the extent that it receives massive pub-\nlic condemnation whenever they occur and occasionally,\npolice authorities and individuals apologize.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nArnaldo, A.
