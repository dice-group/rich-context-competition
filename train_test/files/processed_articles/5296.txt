The\nEvangelical Lutheran Church in Zimbabwe's (ELCZ) expla-\nnation for this theory is that there is a separation between the\nchurch and the state and therefore the church should not pro-\nfane itself with issues of politics (Moyo, 2013). The separa-\ntion means that Lutherans should be silent about politics in\nchurch and the state should also be relatively silent about the\nchurch. However, it is common knowledge that politicians\nwant the church to legitimate their leadership, hence their\nvisits to churches toward any major general election.\nZimbabwean politicians also preach to the church to leave\npolitics to politicians and concentrate on preaching the \"gos-\nRomans 13:1-71 to silence any criticism from the church\nwhile demanding unquestioning allegiance. Based on the\nlevel of political violence (see Blair, 2003), Zimbabweans in\ndifferent walks of life have come to believe that politics is a\ndirty game, so good people, such as Christians, should not be\ninvolved in politics. This article asks the following ques-\ntions: Does the treatise on TA advocate for church a quietist\nideology on politics and good governance? If this treatise is\nabout church silence on politics, then why did Luther use this\nsame treatise to give pastoral political advice on good gover-\nnance to Christian princes? This article argues that Luther\ncould not have advocated for silence using the same treatise\nwhere he gives pastoral advice on good political\ngovernance.\nBackground to the Article--The Luther\nDecade\nThe Lutheran reformation \"started\" on the 31st of October\nyears of Lutheranism.

That's why . . .\nthe 10-year span . . .\" (The Luther decade). Each year in the\ndecade has a specific theme:\nReformation and Freedom; 2012--Reformation and Music;\nPolitics; 2015--Reformation--Visual Arts and the Bible;\nof the Reformation (Themes for the Luther decade. http://www.\nlutherland-thueringen.de/en/the-luther-decade.html).\nThe themes are an opportunity for theologians to engage\nwith the reformation in the light of contemporary realities.\nThe Relevance of the Discussion on the\nTwo Kingdoms Theory in the ELCZ\nIt is relevant for the ELCZ in the current Zimbabwean politi-\ncal context to work on the 2014 theme by going back to\nLuther's treatise on TA, which he delivered on January 1,\n1523 in Wittenberg. Instead of silence because of the imag-\nined separation between the church and the state, Luther\ngives pastoral advice to politicians. Luther offers pastoral\ncare in the form of a Bible study on good political gover-\nnance. Luther implores politicians saying, \"I hope . . . I may\ninstruct the princes and the temporal authorities in such a\nway that they will remain Christians--and Christ will remain\nLord--and yet Christ's commands will not for their sake\nhave to become mere counsels\" (Lehmann & Atkinson,\nLuther gives pastoral advice on good governance to politi-\ncians of his time. He condemns politicians for acting as gods\nby making unreasonable demands on people's conscience\nand faith. On the other hand \". . . the subjects make the mis-\ntake of believing that they, in turn, are bound to obey their\nrulers in everything . . . I shall have to resist them, at least\nis saying that people have no obligation to obey politicians\nwhere there is abuse of power denigrating on human rights.\nElsewhere Luther says, \"The primary loyalty of ministers of\nthe word is to God and not to princes or the public . . .\"\n(Luther -[WA]2 31, p. 189). In this treatise, Luther was advo-\ncating for a theology of r\u00e9sistance.\nWhat Luther acknowledges is comparable with what is\nhappening in current Zimbabwe and one would expect\nLutheran ministers to walk on the footsteps of Luther by giv-\ning pastoral political advice instead of silence. The impunity,\narrogance, corruption, the level of abuse of human rights,\nand the level of authoritarianism that is managed through the\nuse of the partisan police force and the army is beyond\ndescription. Zimbabweans including religious leaders are\ncontrolled through fear. Yet Luther as a minister says that he\nwill not be terrified to silence and will resist, at least by word.\nThe ELCZ should be pondering on a theology of resistance\nto respond to abuse of political office for self-gain at the\nexpense of the majority poor Zimbabweans. Luther then\ngoes on to issue the treatise on TA (the first form of pastoral\ncare to the political leadership was issued as a treatise on the\nGerman Nobility where he spelt out the role of a Christian\nprince and how they can run their office) as a form of pasto-\nral care to the TA and society at large.\nIt should be considered that Luther developed this treatise\nwhile responding to his sociopolitical situation. The ELCZ3\ncannot therefore use Luther's response to a given situation as\na basis for not responding to Zimbabwe's sociopolitical\nsituation.\nThe ELCZ and the Treatise on TA\nThe Church and State relationship debate cannot be more rel-\nis affected in many ways by the current socioeconomic and\npolitical downward mobility of Zimbabwe. The church as an\ninstitution as well as individual Christians is experiencing\ninsurmountable challenges to the extent that the church\nshould respond theological to the Zimbabwean context. The\nELCZ is voiceless in the Zimbabwean political situation\nclaiming that the role of the church is to preach the word of\nGod to save souls for the heavenly kingdom, and therefore,\ntheologically, it cannot confuse its ministry with earthily\nissues by indulging in politics. The church seems to under-\nstand preaching the word to be limited to sermons delivered\non the pulpit. Saving souls then would mean salvation to go\nto heaven. In the ELCZ, if one raises issues of political\ninvolvement by the church as an institution one is reminded\nof the Two Kingdoms doctrine. According to the ELCZ's\ntheological understanding of political ethics, it is sinful for a\npastor to be a councilor or a member of parliament. On the\nother hand, the laity can hold political positions and still be\nrespectable members of the church. However, the separation\nof political engagement from faith is suggesting that the sov-\nereignty of God over all realm of life including politics is\nbeing called into question.\nRevisiting the Treatise on TA\nThe \"Two Kingdoms Doctrine\" is the foundation for the\nELCZ's framework in designing the theology of Church and\nState relations. N\u00fcrnberger observes that Luther has influ-\nenced many generations of protestant thinkers. N\u00fcrnberger is\nof the view that many variations of the Two Kingdoms\nDoctrine are found in different denominations across the\nworld, and this makes Luther a popular\npivotal figure in Christian political ethics . . . But there is a\nsecond reason as well. Seldom in history has a Christian political\nethic been so thoroughly misunderstood and abused as Luther's\n. . . as a result, the traditional picture of Luther's ethics . . . is that\nof conservatism, uncritical acceptance of state authoritarianism\nand ideological legitimation of totalitarian regimes (N\u00fcrnberger,\nPractical experiences with the ELCZ and a few other denom-\ninations (examples of other denominations that have ver-\nsions of the Two Kingdoms theory that inhibit involvement\nin politics are The Church of Christ, the Dutch Reformed\nChurch, the Salvation Army, Zimbabwe Assemblies of God\nAfrica [ZAOGA], Apostolic Faith Mission [AFM], and\nZionists) in Zimbabwe justify N\u00fcrnberger's observations\nthat this is often misunderstood, to the detriment of the\ninvolvement of the church in issues of good governance and\njustice. The misunderstanding is often based on the fact that\nthe theory is explained out of Luther's unique context which\nwas different from many current economic, religious, social,\nwould be fair to Luther and to the Church to understand\nLuther's situation and the necessity for the theory in Luther's\ntime before transferring the theory to current contexts in\nAfrica.\nThe Religious-Political Context of\nLuther Leading to the Treatise on TA\nLuther deliberated on the issues of political governance at\nthe height of the explosive movement of the Reformation in\nthe 16th century by giving political ethical pastoral advice to\nthe Political Authority (PA) on good governance. As chief\ninitiator of the reformation, Luther was constantly called\nupon to give advice and guidance to Christians in the prob-\nlems of everyday life as well as advice to his disciples in the\nReformation movement and to a certain measure to his\nadversaries. The treatise on TA was a response to several\nconcrete challenges. There was a need for Luther to clarify\nhis position regarding the relationship between TA and spiri-\ntual authority (politics and the church).\nLuther denied that spiritual authority is exempt from the\njurisdiction of TA in 1520 in An Open Letter to the Christian\nrefused to comply with the order of the highest TA, the\nemperor, when he was asked to disown his publications\n(Lehmann & Atkinson, 1962). Luther chose to listen to God\nrather than to humans. This can be seen as a form of politics\nof resistance in circumstances where the PA is not in agree-\nment with the spiritual authority. The question was how\nChristians should behave before the TAin the light of Luther's\nteachings. How were Christians to respond to orders by rulers\nforbidding them to own or read any of Luther's books includ-\ning the German translation of the New Testament? While\nstruggling with political orders, many of Luther's followers\nhad difficulties in understanding certain scriptural injunctions\nRegency condemned religious innovations such as commu-\nnion in both kinds (bread and wine) and clerical marriage.\nCopies of the edict were sent to secular and ecclesiastical\nprinces, who were urged to inflict severe penalties for infrac-\ntions of the decree within their territories (Lehmann &\natically compelled to renounce his books while some princes\nwere plotting to kill Luther for which they had legal authori-\nzation because of the edict of Worms (Lehmann & Atkinson,\n1962). On the other hand, there were princes who were\nChristians who were not sure how to relate their political\noffices to Christianity. The challenge was worsened by the\ninterpretation, for example, of Romans 13:1 seen as in direct\ncontradiction of Matthew 5: 31-41. Should Christian princes\nthen give up their political responsibilities to become true\nChristians? Should there be church and state separation?\nThere was wide spread religious-political unrest which\nwas attributed to Luther. For example, students were rioting\nand communities were plundering churches and monasteries\n(Lehmann & Atkinson, 1962). Luther urged his followers to\ndesist from physical aggression. Luther boasted that \". . . he\nhas done more harm to the papacy by his pen than was ever\naccomplished by the violent acts of emperors, kings, and\nprinces\" (Lehmann & Atkinson, 1962, p. xiii).\nFollowing the above challenges, Luther wrote his 1523\ntreatise on Temporal Authority: To What Extent It Should Be\nObeyed. He was responding to contextual religious and\nsociopolitical challenges.\nLuther argues that TA originates from God, and therefore,\nit is holy and should be obeyed. Luther supports his asser-\ntions by giving biblical basis for TA. He also untangles the\nseeming contradiction posed by different texts.\nBiblical References Founding TA\n(Romans 13 and I Peter 2; Scripture Is\nUsed According to Luther's Exegesis)\nIn the first part, Luther provides \". . . a sound basis for the\ncivil law and sword so no one will doubt that it is in the world\nby God's will and ordinance\" (Lehmann & Atkinson, 1962,\nLet every soul be subject to the governing authority, for there is\nno authority except from God; the authority which everywhere\nexists has been ordained by God. He then who resists the\ngoverning authority resists the ordinance of God, and he who\nresists God's ordinance will incur judgement.\nLuther cites I Peter 2 13:14: \"Be subject to every kind of\nhuman ordinance, whether it be the king as supreme, or to\ngovernors, as those who have been sent by him to punish the\nwicked and praise the righteous.\" Luther seems to be advo-\ncating unquestioning obedience to political authority. Still,\nthe point is that Luther was engaging the political situation.\n4 SAGE Open\nThis is different from being silent; he was interpreting the\nBible from the basis of his situational experiences.\nLuther's Argument on TA From the\nOld Testament (OT)\nLuther says, \". . . the law of this temporal sword has existed\nfrom the beginning of the world\" (Lehmann & Atkinson,\nkilled until God put a special sign on his forehead to suspend\nthe sword (Genesis 4:14-15). Abel would not have been\nafraid if Adam had not taught him about the power of TA\n(Lehmann & Atkinson, 1962). After the flood, God estab-\nlished the sword, \"Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man\nshall his blood be shed\" (Genesis 9:6). The Law of Moses\nalso says,\nIf a man willfully kills another, you shall take him from my altar,\nthat he may die . . . a life for a life, an eye for an eye, a tooth for\na tooth, a foot for a foot, a hand for a hand, a wound for a wound,\nThis was an argument to show that the PA is ordained by God\nand should be obeyed as long as it obeys God.\nLuther's Argument on TA From the\nNew Testament (NT)\nIn the NT, Jesus says to Peter in the Garden, \"He that takes the\nsword will perish by the sword\" (Matt. 26:52), and to Luther,\nthis means the same as Genesis 9:6 (Lehmann & Atkinson,\nsage of repentance as a way of making the paths of the Lord\nstraight, did not condemn military service when he was asked\nby soldiers what they should do in preparation for the coming\nLord. John did pastoral care by teaching soldiers military eth-\nics, \"Do neither violence nor injustice to anyone, and be con-\ntent with your wages\" (Luke 3:14). Luther concludes that\nJohn the Baptist was going to condemn soldiers for being sol-\ndiers if it was against God's will, but John taught them on\nhow to be good soldiers (Lehmann & Atkinson, 1962).\nTherefore, according to Luther, both the OT and the NT\nare in agreement that God instituted TA. Luther, in engaging\nin the above debate, was doing his pastoral care ministry in\nhis socioeconomic and pastoral situation.\nOpposing Scriptural Evidence on TA\nNevertheless, there seem to be some strong arguments\nagainst the above understanding of the divine origin of TA.\nLuther acknowledges that in the sermon on the mountain\nJesus says,\nYou have heard that it was said of them of old:An eye for an eye,\na tooth for a tooth. But I say to you, do not resist evil; but if\nanyone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also\n. . . And if anyone forces you to go one mile, go with him two\nLuther also cites Paul saying, \"Beloved, defend not your-\nselves, but leave it to the wrath of God; for it is written, `ven-\ngeance is mine; I will repay, says the Lord'\" (Romans 12:19).\nMatthew 5:44 says, \"Love your enemies, do good to them\nthat hate you.\" Furthermore, Luther cites I Peter 3:9 \"Do not\nreturn evil for evil . . . .\" Luther was aware that such verses\nwould imply that Christians were not supposed to have the\nFor the purpose of this article, it can be seen that Luther\nengaged scripture to theologically respond to his political\nsituation.\nDivision of People Into Two Kingdoms\nof Believers and Unbelievers\nAccording to Luther, believers are people that believe in\nJesus and are baptized to be members of the Church.\nUnbelievers are those who do not believe in Jesus including\npeople of other faiths. Luther says,\nwe must divide the children of Adam and all mankind into two\nclasses, the first belonging to the kingdom of God, the second to\nthe kingdom of the world. Those who belong to the kingdom of\nGod are all the true believers who are in Christ and under Christ\nJesus came to the world to establish God's kingdom and\nChrist showed in his sermons that His kingdom was not of\nthis world. Luther says, \"For this reason he came into the\nworld, that he might begin God's kingdom and establish it in\nreferences to his kingdom in many instances such as John\nto Luther, Jesus also calls the gospel \"a gospel of the king-\ndom of God, because it teaches, governs, and upholds God's\non to engage with the question of the position of the believer\nin politics.\nLuther's Discussion on Believers'\nPosition in Politics\nAccording to Luther, people who belong to the kingdom of\nGod have no need of the temporal sword because they have\nthe Holy Spirit that teaches them to do justice and endure all\ninjustice at the hands of others. Luther argues that in a situa-\ntion where there is nothing but the unadulterated doing of\nright and bearing of wrong, there is no need for any law suit\nor sword (Lehmann & Atkinson, 1962). For this reason,\nLuther would conclude that it is impossible that the PA and\nlaw should find any work to do among Christians because\nthey do according to their will much more than any laws can\nenforce, just as Paul says in I Timothy 1:9, \"The law is not\nlaid down for the just but for the lawless\" (Lehmann &\nLuther further says Christians are inclined and trained in\ntheir nature not to seek revenge but are prepared to endure\nevil and suffer injustice, hence there is no need for a system\nto control or force them to behave this way. Luther uses the\nanalogy of a good tree, that it does not need any law or\ninstruction to bear good fruits; it bears good fruits by its very\nnature. The law and the sword are not needed among\nChristians and therefore the Sermon on the Mountain refers\nto true Christians and there is no contradiction with, for\nexample, Romans 13:1 because according to Luther this\nscripture refers to people who belong to the kingdom of the\nworld.\nLuther goes on to raise another question: \"Why, then, did\nGod give so many commandments . . . and why does Christ\nprescribe in the gospel so many things for us to do\" (Lehmann\n& Atkinson, 1962, p. 89)? In response, Luther insists that the\nlaw has been laid down for the lawless (I Tim. 1:9) so that\nnone of the Christians can be restrained outwardly from evil\ndeeds. No human is by nature righteous, and therefore, the\nlaw is to restrain human sinfulness and wickedness (Lehmann\n& Atkinson, 1962). In addition, Paul ascribes to the law\nanother function of teaching people to recognize sin in order\nthat it may make them humble unto grace and unto faith in\nLuther says that Christ does the same in Matthew 5:39 by\nteaching that we must not resist evil; by this, he is interpret-\ning the Hebrew-Mosaic law and teaching what ought to be\nthe understanding of a true Christian (Lehmann & Atkinson,\nLuther on Nonbelievers\nLuther views nonbelievers as people who belong to the king-\ndom of the world. People in the kingdom of the world are not\nprepared by themselves to do what the state law demands,\n\". . . therefore they need the law to instruct, constrain, and\ncompel them to do good\" (Lehmann & Atkinson, 1962,\np. 89). God subjects unbelievers to the law so that they are\nrestrained from evil deeds, \". . . even though they would like\nto, they are unable to practice their wickedness, and if they\npractice it they cannot do so without fear of the sword or with\nAccording to Luther, if there was no TA, the world would be\ndisorganized as unbelievers would behave like wild animals,\nhence the need for restraint,\nin the same way a savage wild beast is bound with chains and\nropes so that it cannot bite and tear as it would normally do, even\nthough it would like to, whereas a tame and gentle animal needs\nno restraint, but is harmless despite the lack of chains and ropes\nTA helps to maintain outward worldly peace. By citing\nRomans 13:3, Luther argues that the temporal sword is not a\nthreat to good conduct but to bad behavior. In this case,\nLuther develops his thought by using an ideal typology of a\nChristian as a new sinless creation that is not threatened by\nthe law, making it useless to Christians but valid to unbeliev-\ners. Luther uses I Peter 2:14 to substantiate that TA is for the\npunishment of the wicked and the wicked are found in the\nkingdom of the world and never in the kingdom of God.\nOn the other hand, Luther contends that there are few true\nbelievers who do not resist evil and indeed they do not do\nevil. Luther argues that anyone who tries to rule by the\nGospel only and abolish the sword will lose control of the\nropes and the chains of the savage wild beasts and let them\nbite and mangle everyone, meanwhile insisting that they\nwere harmless creatures. Many people conceal their true\nbeing under the pretext of being called Christians. Luther\nholds that the wicked always outnumber the good and it is for\nthis reason that God has provided TA. He argues that, \"Both\nmust be permitted to remain, the one to produce righteous-\nness, the other to bring about external peace and prevent evil\ndeeds. Neither one is sufficient in the world without the\nbetween the two governments is complementary because,\nwhere temporal government or law alone prevails, there sheer\nhypocrisy is inevitable, even though the commandments be\nGod's very own . . . On the other hand, where the spiritual\ngovernment alone prevails over land and people, there\nwickedness is given free rein and the door is open for all manner\nIn light of the above, Christ's words in Matthew 5 instruct\nChristians not to use the law among themselves. So the\nseemingly contradictory scriptures \". . . are spoken only of\ntrue Christians, who really do this among themselves\"\ngoes on to explain the reason why Christians are instructed\nby apostles to obey TA even if they do not need it for them-\nselves as advocated above.\nThe Distinction for Oneself and for\nOne's Neighbor\nLuther insists that the TA or the sword \"is neither necessary\nuse by Christians. Christians do not need TA and the sword\nfor themselves, but they can serve TA for the benefit of oth-\ners as a ceaseless gift to them and not for personal gain.\nFrom an ethical perspective, a Christian should have more\nconcern for the neighbor than for the self. Luther says,\nA true Christian lives and labors on earth not for himself alone\nbut for his neighbor. Because the sword is most beneficial and\nnecessary for the whole world in order to preserve peace, punish\n6 SAGE Open\nsin, and restrain the wicked . . . (A Christian) pays his taxes,\nhonors those in authority . . . and does all he can to assist the\ngoverning authority that it may function and be held in honor\nThe Christian submits to and supports the temporal sword\nwillingly for the services it renders to society. So the Church\nshould support the PA for the services it renders to society.\nLuther says that the services of the TA are essential and nec-\nessary for the benefit of others (Ephesians 5:21-6:9).\nLuther observes that Christians do a lot of works of love\nthat they do not need themselves such as visiting the sick and\nfeeding the hungry. In the same way, Christians serve the gov-\nerning authority not because they need it but for the sake of\nothers that they may be protected. Christians do not lose any-\nthing by serving and honoring the governing authority in the\nspirit of love for others. Luther refers to Matthew 17:27 as an\nexample that Jesus paid the half-shekel tax that he might not\noffend the political authority, even though he had no need to\ndo so. Christians are by their nature expected to do pastoral\ncare to others including doing so through the political\nauthority.\nLuther observes in the words of Christ in Matthew 5 that\nChristians among themselves should have no temporal\nsword. Jesus does not, however, forbid one to serve and be\nsubject to those who do have the secular sword. Luther says,\nChrist does not say, \"you shall not serve the governing authority\nor be subject to it,\" but rather, \"Do not resist an evil person\"\n(Matt. 5:39), as much as to say, \"Behave in such a way that you\nbear everything, so that you may not need the governing\nauthority to help you and serve you or be beneficial or essential\nfor you, but that you in turn may help and serve it, being\nbeneficial and essential to it. I would have you be too exalted\nand far too noble to have any need of it; it should rather have\nAt this point, Luther sees it as a Christian virtue to serve\nand honor the governing authority for peace and justice in\nthe kingdom of the world. Christians have a duty to protect\nhuman rights and human dignity. Christians should serve the\ngovernment when it upholds peace and justice. If the PAdoes\nnot uphold peace and justice, Christians have no obligation\nto serve such a political authority. Peace and justice for all\nmeans equal dignity and protection by the law. Peace means\nlack of disharmony enabling each person to develop to their\nfull potential without hindrances from other citizens or from\nthe state.\nThe Hebrew word for peace is shalom. It is a comprehensive\nconcept that means wholeness, joy, freedom, reconciliation,\ncommunity, harmony of all creation--both physical and\nspiritual, righteousness, truth, justice, communication. (http://\nwww.cofchrist.org/peace/).\nFurthermore, \"Shalom is holistic and embraces all persons\nand all creation . . .\" (http://www.cofchrist.org/peace/).\nJustification for Bearing the Sword by\nChristians\nLuther says that the sword has no place among Christians\nbecause by virtue of the principles and values of their faith\nthey do not it (the sword). However, Christians are obliged to\nserve and assist the sword by whatever means (Lehmann &\nneighbor. Therefore, Christians can become civil servants as\na channel of service and servant-hood for the maintenance of\nsafety and peace for others. The Christian, at a personal level,\nwould be controlled by the gospel and submit to the PA\naccording to Christ's word (Matt. 5:39-40). In this way, the\nseemingly contradictions are harmonized enabling the\nChristian to satisfy both inwardly and outwardly the king-\ndom of God. The Christian outwardly suffers evil and injus-\ntice while punishing evil and injustice, by not resisting evil,\nand yet at the same time resisting it (Lehmann & Atkinson,\n1962). According to Luther, this shows how Christians can\nbear the sword among non-Christians in a Christian manner.\nThe Limits of TA\nHaving argued that TA has divine origins and is religiously\njustifiably to be honored even by Christians, Luther goes on\nto teach about the limits of TA. One of the challenges was that\nbishops and princes wanted to use TA to counter heresy and\nLuther felt that they were interfering where their authority\nwas not required.\nIt is important for Christians to know the limits of TA;\notherwise, it encroached upon God's kingdom (Lehmann &\ngovernment and the spiritual government, according to Luther,\nhave two different kinds of law. Every kingdom must have its\nown laws and constitution for the regulation of its affairs. In\nthis case, according to Luther, one can justifiably talk about\nthe political/civil use of the law as mandated to the TA, while\nthe theological use of the law is mandated to the church.\nThe Theological Use of the Law\nLuther postulates that the theological use of the law belongs\nto the kingdom of God under the kingship of Christ. In this\nkingdom, God cannot allow anyone to rule the soul other than\nHimself. The soul is the center of the human relationship with\nGod and this has nothing to do with TA. Luther says that any\nman-made laws regarding the soul or spiritual life cannot be\nsaid to be coming from God and therefore should not be used\nas if they come from God. Man-made laws should be used\nknowingly that they come from humans for worldly peace.\nTherefore, anyone else who claims to rule the soul or forces\nthe soul to believe anything without the word of God will be\nmisleading the soul and at the same time committing a sin\n(Lehmann & Atkinson, 1962). It is true from experience that\nif another ruler imposes regulations in another kingdom, that\nruler will be violating territorial regulations and the king of\nthe violated kingdom will resist in some way. In matters that\nconcern the Christian's relationship with God and the salva-\ntion of souls, Luther would not accept anything other than\nGod's word when he says,\n. . . it is the height of folly when they command that one shall\nbelieve the church, the fathers, and the councils, though there be\nno word of God for it . . . \"Whoever speaks, let him speak as the\nword of God\" (I Pet. 4:11) . . . we are not baptised into kings . . .\nbut into Christ and God himself . . . Therefore, in matters which\nconcern the salvation of souls, nothing but God's word shall be\nThe kingdom of God deals with the soul, PA has no power\nto control the internal because it cannot see the heart. It is\nGod alone who can see the heart of human beings. Luther\nthinks that it is illogical for the PA to be concerned about the\nsoul because it cannot kill it or give it life and because TAhas\nno control over the soul. It (TA) cannot destine souls to\nheaven or to hell. Luther says,\nWe cannot conceive how an authority could or should act in a\nsituation except where it can see . . . That is reserved for God\nalone, as Psalm 7:9 says, \"God tries the hearts and reigns\" . . .\nthe thoughts and inclinations of the soul can be known to no one\nThe PA cannot govern the spiritual realm even if it so\nwished, \". . . how dare the mad temporal authority judge and\ncontrol such a secret, spiritual, hidden matter as faith\"\nThe soul is a matter between the individual and God who\nteaches through the gospel and the Holy Spirit to make\nhumans aware of their sins. The theological use of the law\ndivulges that humans are sinners. Luther's interpretation of\nthe law in a theological sense is based on Deuteronomy 6:5ff,\n\"You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and\nwith all your soul, and with all your might . . . .\" This implies\nthat the whole human being should be directed to God.\nHowever, this is not the case; humans have a tendency to do\nwrong and are inwardly accused by God through the gospel.\nThe law in the kingdom of God inwardly accuses sinning in\nthe heart, in the soul and in the mind (Lohse, 1999).\nLohse (1999) describes Luther's understanding of the\ntheological use of law by saying that the theological use of\nthe law is the ultimate task of the law as it introspectively\nconvicts individuals of their wrongdoing before God and\ntheir neighbors. The theological use of the law convicts indi-\nviduals and then goes on to torment their hearts as it seeks\ninternal repentance without force from TA (See Gritsch &\nSuch internal expositions of being inwardly inclined to\nsin prepare the inner being for longing for the gospel and\nforgiveness of sins to produce righteousness. According to\nLuther, the law shows humans what they ought to be, but\nwhat they are not able to be on their own, and the law is also\nnot able to make humans what they ought to be unless God\nredeems them through Christ. The spiritual government does\nnot enforce decrees by physical force, it uses the gospel\n(word and sacraments) through the power of the Holy Spirit\ngiven through grace and accepted by faith alone. When\naccepted by God through Christ, we then participate in the\nrighteousness of God in the strength of being served by\nJesus.\nThe Political Use of the Law\nThe political use of the law is exercised through political\nauthority, affecting the outward human being. At times, tem-\nporal laws affect the spiritual law. For example, Daniel,\nMeshach, Shadrach, and Abednego had their religious con-\nvictions challenged by temporal law (Daniel 3:1-30). This\naspect is meant to structure visible human life by protecting\nand promoting good while limiting and punishing wrong.\nThis brings about order and peace, but it cannot control\nthoughts and feelings, hence the need for the theological use\nBy means of the political use, external order on earth is to be\nmaintained, and the peace and the securing of justice preserved.\nThelawalsohasthetaskofinculcatingthedivinecommandments\nand of instructing consciences. It also is to furnish the needed\nmeans by which to punish evildoers (p. 271).\nLuther does not limit the political use of the law to political\ngovernance but extends it to parents, teachers, and institu-\ntions of learning. In his treatise To the Councilmen of All\nCities in Germany that they establish and maintain Christian\nLuther appealed to the PA to establish Christian schools for\nmolding good boys and girls so as to have good learned citi-\nzens for the future of the nation. Estes says that Luther,\nadvised the elector that all the abandoned monasteries and\nfoundations had automatically fallen under his authority as\nprince and he thus had the duty . . . put their affairs in order, and\nsee to it that their resources were to support those churches and\nschools not otherwise adequately endowed with income.\nMoreover, he attributed to the elector, as \"supreme guardian of\nthe younger generation,\" the power to compel communities who\nhad the wherewithal to do so to \"support schools, preacherships,\nand parishes\" just as one would compel them \"to contribute to\n. . . the building of bridges and roads, or any other of the\ncountry's needs.\" Otherwise \"the land will be filled with wild,\nThe civil use of the law has to do with how people relate\nto one another and their environment in everyday life, while\nthe theological use of the law has to do with humanity's rela-\ntionship with God through relating to one another. Luther is\nteaching both religious leaders and political leaders. Luther\nalso engaged with the challenge of the role of Bishops.\n8 SAGE Open\nThe Roles of Bishops and Princes\nLuther challenged Bishops and Princes who confused their\nspirituality with their political authority. Such princes would\nuse TA to promote their spiritual roles and at the same time\nuse spiritual authority to protect their TA.\nFor my ungracious Lords, the pope and the bishops, are supposed\nto be bishops and preach God's word. This they leave undone,\nand have become temporal princes who govern with laws which\nconcern only life and property. They are supposed to be ruling\nsouls inwardly by God's word; so they rule castles, cities, lands,\nand people outwardly, torturing souls with unspeakable outrages.\nThe temporal lords on the other hand are supposed to gov-\nern lands and people outwardly, but unfortunately they are\nnot doing this. Luther criticizes them strongly, saying that\ninstead they strip and fleece, making people pay many unrea-\nsonable taxes (Lehmann & Atkinson, 1962).\nThere is no more any justice, integrity, or truth to be found\namong them. They behave worse than any thief or scoundrel . . .\nFor this reason God perverts their mind also, that they rush on\ninto the absurdity of trying to exercise a spiritual rule over souls,\njust as their counterparts try to establish a temporal rule.\nGovernors should know their sphere of authority; other-\nwise, they are sinning against God if they overstep their man-\ndate. According to Luther, they are heaping alien sins upon\nthemselves thereby incurring the anger of God and hatred of\nman, \". . . until they come to reign together with bishops,\npopes, and monks, one scoundrel with the other\" (Lehmann\nThe Meaning of Scripture on Issues\nof TA in Relationship to the Spiritual\nAuthority\nporal obedience and authority applies to external issues of\nthe law such as taxes and honor where human beings can \". . .\nsee, know, judge, evaluate, punish, and acquit\" (Lehmann &\nJesus Christ in Matthew 22:21 says, \"Render to Caesar\nthe things that are Caesar's and to God the things that are\nGod's.\" External things such as body, property, and the con-\nferring of honors are under the authority of Caesar and he has\ncontrol over them, while on the other hand, spiritual things\nand the soul are under Christ.\nLuther gives an example from Psalms when King David\nsaid, \"He has given heaven to the Lord of heaven, but the\nearth he has given to the sons of men\" (Psalm 113 and\n115:16). To strengthen his argument, Luther says God said,\n\"Let us make man to have dominion over the beasts of the\nearth, the fish of the sea, and the birds of the air\" (Genesis\n1:26). According to Luther, scriptures clearly show that the\nexternal dimension is given to humanity, while the spiritual\ndimension remains under God's business. Peter in Acts 5:29\nsays, \"We must obey God rather than men.\" To Luther, this\n\"clearly sets a limit to the temporal authority, for if we had to\ndo everything that the temporal authority wanted there would\nhave been no point in saying, `We must obey God rather than\naccording to Luther, gives power to those who are being gov-\nerned to denounce political authorities that encroach on the\nkingdom of God. Christians should obey PA if it justly serves\nthe people; however, if it abuses the rights of citizens it is\nsupposed to be protecting and serving, then the church should\ndenounce it and obey God.\nWisdom Expected of a Christian Prince\n(Politician)\nAccording to Luther, a Christian prince should use TAjust like\nany other Christian would use it for the benefit of the neighbor\nand not for self-gain. A Christian prince is to exercise servant-\nhood leadership in political governance. Leadership should be\ndirected at the benefit of others who otherwise would not have\nbenefitted anything had it not been for one's good leadership\nA prince should understand the law and good common\nsense at the same time. The law must be used with firmness,\nreasoning, and Christian wisdom. In making judgments, a\ngood prince will use discretion in applying the law depend-\ning on the context of the accused or the accuser. For no mat-\nter how good and impartial the laws are, they all make an\nexception in the case of necessity, in the face of which they\ncannot insist upon being strictly enforced. Therefore, a prince\nmust have the law as firmly in hand as the sword, and deter-\nmine in his own mind when and where the law is to be\napplied strictly or with moderation so that the law may pre-\nvail at all times and in all cases, and reason must be the high-\nest law and the master of all administration of law (Lehmann\n& Atkinson, 1962). On this same note, punishment should be\nexercised without causing injury to others. At times, the\nprince, depending on the possible consequences, should be\nable to ignore some offences, \"He cannot govern who cannot\nIf the prince lacks the requisite wisdom to the point of\nentirely depending upon advisors and law books, then that\nland will be doomed. Such a prince should take the example\nof King Solomon, who turned to God for wisdom to govern\nwell (I Kings 3:9). If he then governs accordingly, God will\ngrant him the ability to carry out all actions in a proper godly\nmanner (Lehmann & Atkinson, 1962). This way, he should\npicture Christ to himself, and say,\nChrist . . . came to serve me; he did not seek to gain power, estate,\nand honor and from me, but considered only my need, and\ndirected all things to the end that I should gain power, estate, and\nhonor from him and through him. I will do likewise, seeking from\nmy subjects not my own advantage but theirs. I will use my office\nto serve and protect them, listen to their problems and defend\nthem, and govern to the sole end that they, not I, may benefit and\nThis is what Christ did in Philippians 2:7, and these are\nproper works of a Christian prince. Luther understands lord-\nship as servant-hood to all and master to none. A Christian\nprince should therefore be a servant to all his subjects, and\nthis will take away most of the prevalent pleasures of prince\nhood resulting in self-sacrifice. Elsewhere, Luther says, \"The\nsecond virtue of a prince is to help the poor, the orphans, and\nthe widows to justice, and to further their cause\" (Lehmann\n& Atkinson, 1962, p. 53). In other words, a prince should be\nan advocate for the vulnerable.\nChristian Politicians on the Use of\nAdvisors\nFollowing on the issue of wisdom, Luther says that a prince\nshould not depend completely upon advisers.Aprince should\npractice control over appointees by delegating certain duties\nbut should not completely entrust decision making to them.\n\". . . A prince should trust his officials and allow them to act,\nbut only in such a way that he will keep the reins of govern-\nment in his own hands . . . \" (Lehmann & Atkinson, 1962, p.\n121) because the failure of the appointees is the responsibil-\nity of the prince. Humans are not trustworthy unless they are\nfilled with the Holy Spirit (see Gritsch & Lehmann, 1970).\nSince one cannot know whether the Prince's appointed advis-\ners are faithful Christians and trustworthy or not or how long\nthey will remain so hence the danger of complete depen-\ndence on them. Even if one professes to be a Christian, you\ncannot know because there are many who profess to be\nChristian when in actual fact they are not, judging by their\nsinfulness. Luther gives the example of King David and\nAhithophel. Luther observes that David had a wise coun-\nselor, Ahithophel whose advice was comparable with con-\nsulting God. However, Ahithophel betrayed David and\ntaught him that no advisor is to be completely trusted (II\nSamuel 16:23). However, God can be relied upon absolutely\nand will not let one down, whereas even if one wants to rely\non humans absolutely, they are not totally reliable.\nLuther's Advice to Christian Politicians\non Warfare\nOn the question of whether a prince should go to war and\nwhether citizens should follow him, Luther said that the\nprince should use wisdom in deciding on whether to go to\nwar or not. Furthermore, it depends upon the context; simi-\nlarly, the subjects of the prince can join or refuse to join the\nprince in waging a war depending upon the context. Luther\nsays that a prince should not go to war against his king;\ninstead, the prince should offer confession and be prepared to\nsuffer wrong for God's sake. The prince should also offer\npeace and justice to whoever wants to go to war with them\nIn this case, a prince invokes the temporal sword to pro-\ntect his subjects and territory for the benefit of his people\nrather than himself and \". . . when victory has been achieved,\none should offer mercy and peace to those who surrender and\nLuther goes on to answer one of the most challenging situa-\ntions in people's relationship with their kings. \"What if the\nprince is wrong? Are his people bound to follow him? No,\nfor it is no one's duty to do wrong; we must obey God rather\nHowever, if subjects do not know whether their prince is\nwrong they have to obey and this will not be considered as a\nsin by God. Luther goes on to say, \"A prince must act in a\nChristian way toward his God also; that is, he must subject\nhimself to Him in entire confidence and pray for wisdom to\nrule well, as Solomon did (I Kings 3:9)\" (Lehmann &\nIn light of the above pastoral advice by Luther to\nChristian princes, should the ELCZ not give practical polit-\nical theological based advice to the government in situa-\ntions like when Zimbabwe went to war in the Democratic\nRepublic of Congo (DRC)? According to Blair, \"When\ncivil war erupted in the DRC in August 1998, Mugabe\ndecided that Zimbabwe must intervene. The parlous state of\nhis treasury meant that no money was available.\nNonetheless, he ended up sending 11, 000 troops\" (Blair,\n2003, p. 41). Luther's advice could also have been useful in\ngiving pastoral advice during the war in which Zimbabwe\nAugust 1985, Zimbabwe deployed troops in the Gorongoza\narea of Mozambique to fight against the RENAMO, which\nwas destabilizing Mozambique. This was justified by the\nargument that the troops were guarding the Beira Corridor\nthrough which Zimbabwe accesses crude oil through the\nFeruka oil pipe line. The ELCZ could have based its practi-\ncal advice on Luther's advice on war by a political leader\ninstead of silence.\nThe Law of Love and Restitution\nAccording to Luther, cases of restitution are what the tempo-\nral sword is commonly concerned with. There is no better\nlaw than the law of love. In the case of restitution of goods\nwrongfully acquired, Luther advises,\nIf they are both Christians the matter is soon settled; neither will\nwithhold what belongs to the other, and neither will demand that\nit be returned. If only one of them is a Christian, namely, the one\nto whom restitution is due, it is again easy to settle, for he does\nnot care whether restitution is ever made to him. The same is\ntrue if the one who is supposed to make restitution is a Christian,\nIn the above case, the Christian will be acting justly for the\nbenefit of the neighbor. This should also have raised some\ntheological pastoral debates in the ELCZ on the Land ques-\ntion, such as, What about the application of this idea of restitu-\ntion in Zimbabwe between the colonialists and Zimbabweans\nwho were dispossessed of their land? Conversely, one can ask\nwhat about restitution to White commercial farmers who have\nbeen dispossessed of their land since 2000 by government\nwithout compensation? Were the colonialists Christian? Are\nZimbabweans Christian? Would this kind of law of love and\nrestitution be applicable in the Zimbabwean political situa-\ntion? Debating these restitution issues by the ELCZ based on\nthe teachings of Luther could have helped the church to mean-\ningfully engage in the political situation. In no way does the\nteaching outlined by Luther advocate silence by the church.\nLuther goes on to give an example full of Christian love\nwhere the offended party is considerate of the welfare of the\noffender despite the offence. He says,\nIf the debtor is poor and unable to make restitution, and the other\npart is not poor, then you should let the law of love prevail and\nacquit the debtor; for according to the law of love the other party is\nin any event obliged to relinquish the debt and, if necessary, to give\nhim something besides. But if the debtor is not poor, then have him\nrestore as much as he can, whether it be all, a half, a third, or a\nfourth of it, provided that you leave him enough to assure a house,\nfood, and clothing for himself, his wife, and his children . . . if\nneither part is a Christian, or if one of them is unwilling to be\njudged by the law of love, then you may have them call in some\nother judge, and tell the obstinate one that they are acting contrary\nto God and natural law, even if they obtain a strict judgement in\nTo further his argument, Luther cites Luke 6:31 as an\nexample of what love teaches us on how to treat others, as we\nwould like to be treated ourselves. Luther argues that one's\nrights in the law of love can be suspended for the sake of the\nother. Love and natural law can be used in dealing with cases\nboth in the private and in the public domain leading to just\njudgments without the use of law books (Lehmann &\nBut when you ignore love and natural law you will never hit\nupon the solution that pleases God . . . A good and just decision\nmust not and cannot be pronounced out of books, but must come\nfrom a free mind, as though there were no books. Such a free\ndecision is given, however, by love and by natural law, with\nLuther knew of only one guiding principle for our lives and that\nwas self-giving love of Christ. Love demands responsibility for\nthe welfare of one's fellow human beings. If a Prince wanted to\nbe a Christian, he had to follow this rule whether in his private\ncapacity or in his political decision making (p. 252).\nNatural and biblical law of love seems to agree with Luther's\npoint of view because they both lead to the golden rule. Love\nprotects the rights and needs of the offender and the offended\njustly in a way that pleases God.\nConclusion\nLuther advocated that TA is meant for evildoers, those who\nbelong to the kingdom of the world. Christians do not need\nTA for their own benefit but for the love of the neighbor. In\ntemporal matters, the TA has a divinely instituted right to be\nobeyed, but when it comes to matters of faith, it is only the\ngospel that is supreme, and TA has no power. It is the duty of\nChristians to support the governance activities of TA, which\nare instituted by God.\nIn developing the above theological discourses on TA,\nLuther was engaging with the TA in his context. Luther gives\npastoral advice on good political governance advice to the\npolitical authority. According to Luther, there is no room for\nsilence by the spiritual authority in relation to the TA. The\nELCZ should be propelled to intervene where there is abuse\nof human rights because of the love of the neighbor. In\nZimbabwe, the gospel of love for the neighbor can be a tool\nfor reconciliation and political tolerance.\nThis treatise also raises restitution issues that resonate\nwith the situation faced by Zimbabweans. Restitution is an\nongoing debate in Zimbabwe pertaining to the land ques-\ntion, mineral resources, and businesses. The government\nwants to take away the above from Whites and give them\nto Blacks without restitution to current owners. The church\ncan give advice to Christians in government as well as\nnon-Christians who are in danger of being dispossessed.\nThe treatise also gives advice to a Christian prince on when\nand why one has to engage in a war. This advice can be\nused as a basis by the ELCZ in advising government when\nit participates in regional conflicts or when there is war\nbetween the government and its own citizens as has been\nthe trend in current Zimbabwe. This treatise is a spring-\nboard for political engagement in a pastoral manner by the\nchurch.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nNotes\n1.
