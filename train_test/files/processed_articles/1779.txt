The lowest mean BMI (P # 0?05)\nand mean waist circumference (P # 0?05) was found in children 1\u00ad12 years of age\nwho consumed RTEC at breakfast compared with other consumption groups. RTEC\nbreakfast consumers had the highest mean intakes of vitamins A, B6\n,\nthiamine, riboflavin, niacin, folate, Ca, Fe and Zn (P # 0?05) and the highest Mean\nAdequacy Ratio (P # 0?05). RTEC breakfast consumers also had the highest intake\nof carbohydrates and total sugars, and the lowest intakes of total fat (P # 0?05).\nConclusions: Consuming RTEC at breakfast was associated with improved weight\nand nutrient adequacy in AA children. AA children in all breakfast categories still\nhad mean intakes of most nutrients below recommended levels. The implications\nare that consuming a breakfast meal should be encouraged in these children, and\nthat RTEC at breakfast provides important nutrients and may help promote a\nhealthy weight.\n",

Compared with children who con-\nsumed breakfast regularly, those who skipped breakfast\nwere more likely to have an inadequate diet, with poorer\nnutrient intakes, and a decreased likelihood of eating\nlunch or dinner on a regular basis(16,21). Skipping breakfast\nwas associated with lower energy intakes, but higher\ninfrequent exercise(24), suggesting that those who skipped\nbreakfast had a less healthy lifestyle than those who did\nnot. Compared with breakfast skippers, children who ate\nbreakfast also had improved behaviour and school per-\nformance(17,25). Although research has consistently shown\nthat breakfast consumption improved diet quality and\nadequacy, it was the most commonly skipped meal(25,26).\nIn the USA, 92 % of ready-to-eat cereals (RTEC) are\nfortified with essential micronutrients(27) and these may\nbe an excellent food source to help children meet their\nnutrient recommendations. Consuming RTEC at breakfast\nhas been associated with higher intakes of Fe, folate,\nvitamin C and Zn, and with lower intakes of total fat\nhave also been observed in children who eat RTEC for\nbreakfast(31). Additionally, breakfasts that include RTEC\nhave been associated with lower BMI(29,30). Thus, RTEC\nbreakfast may play a role in maintaining a healthy weight\nstatus and adequate nutrient intake in children(29,30).\nThe impact of breakfast consumption patterns on\nweight and dietary adequacy in AA children has been\nunderstudied. The aims of the present study were to\ndetermine the association between weight status, nutrient\nintake and dietary adequacy in AA children who skip\nbreakfast, consume a breakfast that includes RTEC or\nconsume a breakfast without RTEC.\nSubjects and methods\nData collection\nThe National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES) is a continuous programme that collects\ninformation about the nutrition and health status of the US\npopulation using a complex, multi-stage, probability sam-\nrepresented approximately 50 000 non-institutionalized\ncivilian Americans(32). Trained examiners completed\nan in-person interview and a physical examination of\nparticipants. The physical examination protocols used to\nobtain anthropometric measures are described in detail\nin the NHANES protocol manual(33).\nA single, multiple-pass, 24 h dietary recall was con-\nducted during the interview using computer-assisted\nsoftware to record dietary intake data from partici-\npants(34). Detailed descriptions of the dietary interview\nmethods are provided in the NHANES dietary inter-\nviewer's training manual, which includes pictures of the\nComputer-Assisted Dietary Interview system (CADI)\nscreens, measurement guides, and charts used to collect\ndietary information(35). Parents or caregivers reported\ndietary intakes for children less than 6 years of age, while\nsubjects aged 6\u00ad11 years were assisted by an adult. The\nname of the meal occasion, e.g. breakfast, brunch, lunch,\ndinner/supper, drink/snack, was self-reported as such.\nSubjects and breakfast categories\nin a secondary analysis to compare weight measures\nand nutrient adequacy in AA children aged 1\u00ad12 years.\nClassification of race was self-reported and based on US\ncensus categories(36). Children were categorized into one\nof three breakfast consumption groups: (i) breakfast\nskippers (those who did not eat breakfast or brunch);\n(ii) RTEC breakfast consumers (regardless of what else\nwas consumed at the breakfast/brunch meal); and (iii) other\nbreakfast consumers (no RTEC was consumed at the\nbreakfast/brunch meal). Due to the nature of the analysis\n(secondary data analysis) and the lack of personal iden-\ntifiers, the present study was exempted by the Institu-\ntional Review Boards of the Louisiana State University\nAgCenter and the Baylor College of Medicine.\nNutrient analysis\nNutrient analysis was accomplished using databases from\nthe US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural\nResearch Service (Beltsville, MD, USA). The USDA Food\nand Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS) ver-\nintake were available only in mg retinol equivalents,\nvitamin E intake data were available only in mg a-toco-\npherol equivalents, only total folate (mg) intake data and\nno vitamin K (mg) or sugars (g) intake data were avail-\nable. Currently, Dietary Reference Intakes for vitamin A,\nvitamin E and folate are expressed as mg retinol activity\nequivalents (mg RAE), mg a-tocopherol (mg AT) and\ndietary folate equivalents (DFE), respectively(37,38). We\nused the special database released by the USDA to\ndetermine vitamin A as mg RAE and vitamin E as mg AT\n(USDA Database of Vitamin A (mcg RAE) and Vitamin E\n(mg AT) for National Health and Nutrition Examination\nintakes of folate (DFE), vitamin K (mg) and total sugars\nfood composition data were obtained from the Pyramid\nDownloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core.

Added sugars were defined by the USDA as white\nsugar, brown sugar, raw sugar, corn syrup, corn syrup\nsolids, high-fructose corn syrup, malt syrup, maple syrup,\npancake syrup, fructose sweetener, liquid fructose,\nhoney, molasses, anhydrous dextrose, crystal dextrose\nand dextrin that are eaten separately or used as an\ningredient in processed or prepared foods.\nIn order to rule out the possibility that the nutrient\ncontribution of eating RTEC for breakfast was attributable\nto milk added to the cereal, the daily nutrient intake\nof breakfast consumption groups was compared after\ndeleting the nutrient intake from milk combined with\nRTEC consumed at breakfast. Daily nutrient intake from\nall foods except milk combined with RTEC consumed at\nbreakfast was determined by summing the nutrient intake\nfrom all foods reported in the 24 h recall after excluding\nany fluid milk other than soya milk combined with RTEC\neaten at breakfast.\nThe Mean Adequacy Ratio (MAR) was calculated by\nexpressing micronutrient intake as a percentage of the\nEstimated Average Requirement (EAR), truncated to no\nmore than 100 %, and averaged over thirteen micro-\nnutrients: vitamins A, E, C, B1\n, niacin,\nwas considered nutritionally adequate for MAR(39).\nStatistical analyses\nSample-weighted data were used in all statistical analyses,\nand all analyses were performed using the SUDAAN soft-\nware package release 9?0?1 (Research Triangle Institute,\nResearch Triangle Park, NC, USA) to adjust the variance\nfor the complex sample design. The sample-weighted\npercentages (and standard error of the percentages) of\nchildren in breakfast consumption groups were calcu-\nlated using PROC CROSSTAB of SUDAAN. Unadjusted\nmeans and SE for total energy were also calculated\nusing PROC DESCRIP of SUDAAN. Least-square means\nand SE were calculated using PROC REGRESS of SUDAAN.\nThe energy-adjusted prevalence of overweight was\ndetermined by calculating the least-square mean of a\ndichotomous variable using PROC REGRESS of SUDAAN.\nChildren with BMI $ 95th percentile of BMI-for-age on\nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\nGrowth Charts were classified as overweight. Percentiles\nand Z scores of BMI-for-age and weight-for-age were\ncalculated using the SAS [Statistical Analysis Software]\nProgram for CDC Growth Charts (US Department of\nHealth and Human Services, Hyattsville, MD, USA).\nSample-weighted LSMEANS and SE were estimated for\nmicro- and macronutrients consumed. In comparing\nthe three breakfast consumption groups, covariates were\nenergy (kJ/kcal), gender and age (years); covariates were\nnot used for MAR calculations. The unadjusted means for\ntotal energy and adjusted means of breakfast consump-\ntion groups were compared using the Bonferroni method\nto adjust the significance level for multiple comparisons.\nBecause there were three comparisons, i.e. breakfast\nskippers v. RTEC breakfast consumers, breakfast skippers\nv. other breakfast consumers, RTEC breakfast consumers\nv. other breakfast consumers, the a value of P # 0?05\nwas divided by 3, and the means of the groups were\nsignificantly different only if the P value of the contrast\nanalysis of NHANES data are available online(41).\nResults\nPercentage of African-American children in\nbreakfast consumption groups by age and gender\nThe percentages of AA male and female children who\nwere assigned to each breakfast consumption category\nare shown in Table 1.

No differ-\nences in percentiles or Z scores of BMI-for-age or weight-\nfor-age were observed between breakfast consumption\ngroups in children.\nMean daily energy and micronutrient intakes\nTable 3 shows mean daily energy and micronutrient\nintakes by breakfast consumption group for children 1\u00ad12\nyears of age. Breakfast skippers had lower mean energy\nintakes than children who consumed RTEC or other\nbreakfasts; energy intakes of children in the other two\ngroups did not differ significantly. Compared with those\nwho either skipped breakfast or consumed other break-\nfasts, children in the RTEC breakfast category had the\nhighest mean daily intakes of vitamins A and B12\n, thiamin,\nriboflavin, folate and Fe (P # 0?05 for all). No differences\nwere found in mean daily intakes of vitamin B6\n, niacin, Ca\nand Zn between breakfast skippers and other breakfast\nconsumers; however, RTEC breakfast consumers had\nhigher intakes of these nutrients (P # 0?05) than the two\nother groups. RTEC breakfast consumers had a lower\nintake of vitamin E than breakfast skippers (P # 0.05).\nComparisons of micronutrient intakes among breakfast\nconsumption groups without milk on RTEC showed that\nCa, P and K in RTEC breakfast consumers were lower\nthan other breakfast consumers, but not significantly\ndifferent from breakfast skippers (data not shown).

This finding is consistent with results from\nother studies(30,42). Further research is needed to deter-\nmine the reasons, but breakfast skipping may be partially\nattributable to environmental or behavioural changes that\noccur with increasing age, such as the changes in food\nchoices available at school or changes in behaviour that\nchildren aged 6\u00ad12 years skip breakfast more than those\naged 1\u00ad5 years may help to identify correlates that can be\nthen used to implement appropriate interventions.\nThe lower mean BMI and waist circumference observed\nin AA children who ate RTEC for breakfast suggests that\nconsumption of RTEC at breakfast may contribute to a\nhealthier weight status. Despite having higher weight\nmeasures, breakfast skippers had a lower energy intake\nthan RTEC and other breakfast consumers. This finding\nalso confirms other research(24,44). The lower mean BMI\nand waist circumference suggest that children who con-\nsume breakfast may have healthier lifestyles than those\nwho skip breakfast. Under-reporting of energy intake may\nalso have occurred in these children, since the BMI of the\nparent or child may affect reporting in a 24 h recall(45).\nChildren 1\u00ad12 years of age who skipped breakfast\nalso had significantly lower intakes of most of the\nmicronutrients compared with RTEC breakfast consumers\nor other breakfast consumers. Although there is a lack of\npublished research on the relationship of weight and diet\nadequacy to breakfast and RTEC breakfast consumption\nin AA children, comparisons of our results with those\nconducted with other age and ethnic groups reveal\n4\u00ad12-year-old children, Albertson et al. found that the\nfrequency of RTEC consumption over a 2-week period\nwas positively correlated with micronutrient intake(29).\nvan den Boom et al. concluded that frequency of RTEC\nconsumption was positively related to improved nutri-\ntional profiles in Spanish children(44). Further, a repre-\nsentative sample of British children aged 4\u00ad18 years\nfound that intakes of Fe and vitamins B and D were\npositively associated with daily percentage of energy\nobtained from RTEC(46). The increased nutrient intake\nassociated with RTEC consumption may be due to for-\ntification of RTEC or milk that is commonly consumed\nwith RTEC, if children who did not consume these foods\ndid not obtain these nutrients from other foods consumed\nduring the day. The Bogalusa Heart Study showed that\nchildren who skipped breakfast did not make up the\ndifferences in dietary intakes at other meals(28). Similarly,\na study of AA children found that skipping breakfast\nresulted in substantial deficits in dietary intakes of nutri-\nents(16); more than a third of breakfast skippers consumed\nTable 3 Mean daily intake of energy and selected nutrients in US African-American children 1\u00ad12 years of age by breakfast consumption\nwith milk on ready-to-eat cereal (RTEC) eaten at the breakfast meal: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999\u00ad2002\nBreakfast skippers RTEC breakfast Other breakfast\nNutrient* Mean SE Mean SE Mean SE\n-\n-\nVitamin B6\nMAR, Mean Adequacy Ratio; RAE, retinol activity equivalents; DFE, dietary folate equivalents.\na,b,c Mean values within a row with unlike superscript letters were significantly different (P # 0?05); breakfast skippers v.

Consumption of milk, which is high in Ca and\nK and is commonly consumed with cereal, may explain\nthis finding as it is consistent with other research(31). Ca\nand K were identified by the 2005 DGAC as two of the\nshortfall nutrients in the diets of children 9 years of age or\nolder(15). AA males aged 1\u00ad10 years were more likely than\nsame-age EA males to have Ca intakes two-thirds or less\nthan the RDA(14), while AA girls were at risk for inade-\nquate intake of Ca(14). Consumption of milk with RTEC\ncould improve Ca intake in this group.\nAlthough our study did not show differences in fibre\nintake among breakfast consumption groups, others have\nshown RTEC as a significant source of fibre for chil-\nlow-fibre cereals, which would suggest the need to pro-\nmote increased intake of RTEC with higher fibre content\nor the need to supplement RTEC with additional fibre(47).\nThe present study had several limitations. NHANES is a\ncross-sectional study and causal inferences cannot be\ndrawn. Dietary intakes were self-reported and relied on\nmemory of the participants or their parent or guardian;\ntherefore data were subject to non-sampling errors, such\nas under-reporting of energy and examiner effects(36).\nParents or guardians who reported or assisted children\nwith the recalls may not know all foods that children in\nday care or school consumed the previous day. Further,\n24 h dietary recalls may not accurately reflect the usual\ndietary patterns of participants(49,50); however, the col-\nlection of group data from 24 h recalls with mean\nreporting, as used by the NHANES, is an appropriate use\nof 24 h diet recalls(51). Children's self-reported portion\nsize estimates are appropriate for ranking children's\nrelative intakes, but may result in sizeable errors in\nquantitative estimates of food and energy intakes(52).\nAnother limitation was that physical activity, an\nimportant contributor to weight status(53), was not used as\na covariate since physical activity information was not\ncollected using a standardized method across the age\ngroups. Further, RTEC were grouped together and\nalthough the majority were fortified, those consumed may\nhave varied considerably in energy, carbohydrate, fibre,\ntotal and added sugar content(27); whether RTEC were\npre-sweetened was also not considered in our study. It\nwas also not considered that RTEC consumed at other\nmeals may make an additional positive contribution to\nnutrient intake and weight of all the breakfast consump-\ntion groups. Finally, foods other than RTEC and milk that\nwere consumed by individuals in the RTEC breakfast\ngroup may have influenced nutrient intake. A study to\ndetermine the effects of other foods consumed with RTEC\nis necessary to determine contributions to nutrient intake.\nConclusion and implications\nIn the present study, improved weight measures and\nnutrient adequacy were associated with eating RTEC for\nTable 4 Mean daily intake of protein, carbohydrate, fat, cholesterol and total dietary fibre in US African-American children 1\u00ad12 years of\nage by breakfast consumption group: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999\u00ad2002\nBreakfast skippers RTEC breakfast Other breakfast\nNutrient Mean SE Mean SE Mean SE\nRTEC, ready-to-eat cereal.\na,b,c Mean values within a row with unlike superscript letters were significantly different (P # 0?05); breakfast skippers v.
