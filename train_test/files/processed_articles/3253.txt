In such a framework, setting a minimum wage in the\nunproductive sector to reduce the wage gap causes a negative spillover effect\non the productive sector. While the effect on job creation in the (targeted) un-\nproductive sector is ambiguous, job creation in the (non-targeted) productive\nsector unambiguously decreases. This is driven by the fact that a minimum\nwage increases the outside option of unemployed workers - contributing to\nwage determination in the productive sector. Welfare effects are ambiguous.\nIn principle, we cannot exclude that a minimum wage in a two-sector search\nmodel is welfare enhancing due to the possibility of an above optimal level\nof productive employment since firms do not take into account the effects of\ntheir individual job creation on aggregated search costs.\n",

While opponents of a\nminimum wage fear job losses, proponents assert that the impact of a minimum\nwage on employment will be benign. It is well known from the theoretical\nliterature that the employment effects crucially depend on the labor market\nstructure. In a competitive labor market model, the real wage is equal to the\nmarginal productivity of labor, and the introduction of a minimum wage (above\nthe competitive market wage) will inevitably lead to reduced employment. On\nthe other end of the spectrum (monopsony model), if a single firm represents\nthe labor demand side in a certain segment and acts like a monopolist in the\nproduct market, the firm maximizes its profits by choosing the lowest wage\npossible in order to attract enough employees to keep production at its desired\nlevel. Against this background, the introduction of a minimum wage will\nentail an increase in employment as long as the minimum wage is less than\nthe competitive wage. Models of monopsonistic competition in labor markets\nare located somewhere in the middle ground between perfectly competitive and\nmonopsonist models, assuming a certain degree of employer market power, and\nopen the door to positive, neutral or negative effects. While there is no clear\nconsensus in the empirical literature, the preponderance of evidence points to\ndisemployment effects.\nThe studies on minimum wages so far have largely focused on the group or\nsector directly targeted. We depart from this pattern by investigating whether\nminimum wages exert a negative spillover effect on other non-targeted sectors.\nWe present a labor market model in which, despite a homogenous pool of\nworkers, two sectors exist that differ in their productivity due to structural or\nregional differences. The introduction of a minimum wage in the relatively un-\nproductive sector unambiguously reduces employment in the productive sector,\nimplying a negative spillover effect. On the other hand, the employment effect\nin the unproductive sector is ambiguous. The minimum wage in the unproduc-\ntive sector increases the outside option of workers in the unproductive sector.\nAn increasing outside option improves their bargaining position and ability\nto demand higher wages in the productive sector (i.e. the reservation wage\nincreases), leaving firms less willing to hire. This effect increases the average\nduration of jobs in the unproductive sector and the chance of unproductive\nemployees to find employment in the productive sector. If this effect is strong\nenough, a minimum wage in the unproductive sector potentially increases em-\nployment in the unproductive sector and, depending on the parameters, in-\ncreases overall employment. It seems especially noteworthy that even if aggre-\ngate employment rises, this comes at a cost to productive employment.\nPrima facie, welfare seems to worsen unambiguously due to falling aggre-\ngate production. But it is worth mentioning that the most common measure\nfor welfare in search models consists of aggregate production and aggregate\nsearch costs. Such costs stem from the continuous creation of vacancies that\nneed to be filled. As a consequence, results regarding welfare effects are am-\nbiguous in this model. Any deviation from the optimal level of employment\nin the canonical one-sector search model can lead to an increase in employ-\nment, which might be offset by higher search costs, leading to a decrease in\nwelfare. Search models typically yield suboptimal employment in equilibrium.\nJob creation in the productive sector in competitive equilibrium of our two-\nsector search model also tends to be too high from a welfare point of view as\nindividual firms in the productive sector do not take into account the effects\nof their vacancy opening on social costs, i.e. rising aggregate search costs,\nresulting in an inefficient market outcome.\nNicht-technische Zusammenfassung\nDie wirtschaftspolitische Diskussion \u00a8\nuber die Notwendigkeit eines Mindestlohns\nhat in Europa, insbesondere in Deutschland, in den letzten zwei Jahren wieder\nFahrt aufgenommen. Die Ansichten der Bef\u00a8\nurworter und Gegner des Mindest-\nlohns unterscheiden sich vor allem hinsichtlich der Besch\u00a8\naftigungswirkungen.\nW\u00a8\nahrend in der theoretischen und empirischen Literatur kein eindeutiger Kon-\nsensus herrscht, deuten die empirischen Studien doch mehrheitlich auf negative\nEffekte eines Mindestlohnes hin.\nDie bisherigen Analysen zum Mindestlohn konzentrieren sich gr\u00a8\no\u00dftenteils\nauf die direkt betroffenen Gruppen oder Sektoren. Die vorliegende Arbeit\nhingegen geht der Frage nach, ob Mindestl\u00a8\nohne \u00a8\nUbertragungseffekte in an-\ndere, nicht direkt betroffene Sektoren verursachen. Wir zeigen in einem theo-\nretischen Modell gleichgewichtiger Arbeitslosigkeit, in dem es trotz homogener\nArbeitnehmerschaft aufgrund von strukturellen oder regionalen Differenzen\nzwei unterschiedlich produktive Sektoren gibt, dass die Einf\u00a8\nuhrung eines Min-\ndestlohnes im relativ unproduktiven Sektor eindeutig die Besch\u00a8\naftigung im rel-\nativ produktiven Sektor senkt und somit einen negativen \u00a8\nUbertrtagungseffekt\nmit sich bringt. Die Besch\u00a8\naftigungseffekte im unproduktiven Sektor sind\nhingegen uneindeutig. Der Mindestlohn im unproduktiven Sektor senkt zwar\naufgrund h\u00a8\noherer Lohnkosten zun\u00a8\nachst die Einstellungswahrscheinlichkeit im\nunproduktiven Sektor, er erh\u00a8\noht allerdings auch den Nutzenzuwachs, den\nein Arbeitnehmer erf\u00a8\nahrt, wenn er im unproduktiven Sektor angestellt wird.\nWir zeigen, dass der Reservationsnutzen steigt. Dies erlaubt den Arbeit-\nnehmern im produktiveren Sektor h\u00a8\nohere L\u00a8\nohne durchzusetzen und senkt\ngleichzeitig die Bereitschaft zur Schaffung neuer Stellen und die Wahrschein-\nlichkeit eines Arbeitnehmers, vom unproduktiven in den produktiven Sektor\nzu wechseln. Letzterer Effekt f\u00a8\nuhrt zu einer l\u00a8\nangeren erwarteten Dauer eines\nBesch\u00a8\naftigungsverh\u00a8\naltnisses im unproduktiven Sektor, was den Anreiz steigert,\nneue Stellen zu schaffen. Ist dieser Effekt stark genug, kann ein Mindest-\nlohn im unproduktiven Sektor dort sogar die Besch\u00a8\naftigung erh\u00a8\nohen und es\nist, abh\u00a8\nangig von der Parametrisierung unseres Modells, prinzipiell nicht aus-\ngeschlossen, dass die aggregierte Besch\u00a8\naftigung steigt. Allerdings wird dies\nmit einer niedrigeren produktiven Besch\u00a8\naftigung erkauft. Auf den ersten Blick\nerscheint ein Mindestlohn somit eindeutig wohlfahrtssch\u00a8\nadigend zu sein, weil\ner die aggregierte Produktion senkt.\nEs ist allerdings hierbei zu beachten, dass sich das g\u00a8\nangigste Wohlfahrtsma\u00df\nin Suchmodellen aus der aggregierten Produktion abz\u00a8\nuglich der aggregierten\nSuchkosten ergibt. Dies bedeutet dann, dass Aussagen \u00a8\nuber Wohlfahrtsef-\nfekte in diesem Modellrahmen uneindeutig sind. In dem vorliegenden Zwei-\nSektoren-Suchmodell ist das Marktgleichgewicht durch ein zu hohes Niveau\nan produktiver Besch\u00a8\naftigung gekennzeichnet, da es wegen der h\u00a8\noheren Pro-\nduktivit\u00a8\nat aus individueller Sicht tendenziell attraktiver ist, im produktiven\nSektor Stellen zu schaffen, diese individuelle Entscheidung aber die Wirkun-\ngen auf die aggregierten Suchkosten, die \u00a8\nuberproportional im unproduktiven\nSektor steigen, nicht einbezieht.\nContents\n3 The Competitive Equilibrium 9\n4 Equilibrium with a Minimum Wage 11\nC Stability of Equilibrium 25\nD Comparative Statics under Minimum Wages 26\nList of Figures\n1 Labor Market Flows . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8\nSpillover Effects of Minimum Wages in a Two-\nSector Search Model1\n1 Introduction\nThe public debate over minimum wages has gained momentum in Germany\nover the past two years. While the business community is expressing unease\nover the latest push for a minimum wage against the background of a slowing\nworld economy and fear of job losses, advocates of such a move claim that such\nwages are necessary to create social justice, as large firms allegedly abuse their\npower to push wages below a socially desired level.2 In their view, negative\nemployment effects are not to be expected. But this public discussion is not\nconfined to Germany. While the introduction of a (modest) minimum wage in\nGreat Britain in 1999 has been largely perceived as successful, the relatively\nhigh level of minimum wages in France is often held responsible for the high\nunemployment rate of young and low-skilled employees. From the literature, it\nis well known that the employment effects of minimum wages crucially depend\non the labor market structure. While most studies on minimum wages are\nusually confined to the sector directly affected, this paper presents a two-\nsector economy in which only one sector is directly affected by minimum wages\nand analyzes the resulting spillovers as well as the effects on unemployment,\nemployment structure and welfare.\nThe effects of minimum wages on employment have been studied in a va-\nriety of different theoretical frameworks. In the \"textbook\" competitive labor\nmarket model, the real wage is equal to the marginal productivity of labor. If\na minimum wage above the competitive market wage is introduced, this will\ninevitably lead to reduced employment. At the other end of the spectrum,\n1Authors: Christoph Moser (ETH Zurich, KOF Swiss Economic Institute, Weinbergstr.\n35, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; e-mail: moser@kof.ethz.ch) and Nikolai St\u00a8\nahler (Deutsche\nBundesbank, Economics Department, Wilhelm-Epstein-Str. 14, 60431 Frankfurt am Main,\nGermany; e-mail: nikolai.staehler@bundesbank.de).

The opinions expressed in this paper do not necessarily reflect the views of the\nDeutsche Bundesbank or of its staff. Any errors are ours alone.\n2Recent newspaper articles on the discussion on minimum wage in Germany include for\neconomists offer their view on minimum wages in Ifo (2008). For an influential, controversial\nrecent empirical study, see K\u00a8\nonig and M\u00a8\nmonopsony models open the door to the possibility that (moderate) minimum\nwage increases can lead to employment growth, depending on the elasticity of\nlabor supply. Those models go back to Stigler (1946). A monopsonist firm\nis assumed to be the only firm in a certain segment of the labor market that\ndemands labor, giving the employer absolute market power. Hence, much like\na monopolist in the product market, the monopsonist firm maximizes its prof-\nits by choosing the lowest wage possible in order to attract enough employees\nto keep production at its desired level. Hence, a monopsony remunerates the\nmarginal employee with (potentially) less than its marginal productivity of la-\nbor. Against this background, the introduction of a minimum wage will entail\nan increase in employment as long as the minimum wage is less than the com-\npetitive wage. This strand of literature is surveyed by Bhaskar et al. (2002),\nRansom (1997). Models of oligopsony and monopsonistic competition in la-\nbor markets are located somewhere in the middle ground between perfectly\ncompetitive and monopsonist models,3 which might indeed be an accurate\ndescription of the labor market. These models assume a certain degree of em-\nployer market power, yet \u00ad at the same time \u00ad employers are competing for\nworkers, which implies that firms face a less than perfectly elastic supply curve.\nIf a minimum wage is introduced, two distinct channels can be expected. On\nthe one hand, a moderate minimum wage can increase employment at the firm\nlevel through greater labor market participation. On the other hand, a binding\nminimum wage will eat into firms' profits and cause some firms to exit the mar-\nket. The overall employment effect depends on which effect dominates. While,\nfor instance, Bhaskar and To (1999) report ambiguous results when firms exit,\nnegative employment effect, respectively. Last, but not least, search frictions\nin labor market search models can, to a certain extent, also be interpreted as a\nsource of monopsony power (for early accounts, see for instance Albrecht and\nsults on employment and welfare presented so far crucially hinge on the exact\nnature of the search friction and on the bargaining power of workers. Ulti-\nmately, this is an empirical question. Two influential surveys on the empirical\nliterature on minimum wages are Card and Krueger (1995) and Neumark and\n3For a survey on oligopsony and monopsonistic competition, see for instance Bhaskar et\nWascher (2007). While the first study underlines the possibility that minimum\nwage effects on employment can be neutral or benign, the later concludes that\n\"the preponderance of the evidence points to disemployment effects.\" Addison\net al. (2009) find a modest positive employment effect once they allow for\ngeographic-specific trends. The recent study by Flinn (2006) constitutes one\nof the few ambitious attempts to come up with empirical welfare effects of\nminimum wages.\nIn this paper, employment and welfare effects in a two-sector search econ-\nomy are analyzed from a theoretical perspective. We extend the matching\n(2000) by introducing an additional sector. While both sectors revert to the\nsame pool of homogenous workers, we assume differences in the sector produc-\ntivity and label one sector productive and the other one unproductive. Such\nproductivity differences can be motivated by economies with sectoral or re-\ngional differences, where the same type of worker can be employed in either\nsector (agricultural vs. industrial; exporting vs. non-exporting or urban vs.\nrural sector). Fuchs-Sch\u00a8\nundeln and Izem (2007) corroborate this assumption\nby showing that East and West German workers exhibit very similar skills af-\nter German reunification. They conclude that regional productivity differences\nbetween East and West Germany are largely driven by job characteristics. To-\ndaro (1969) makes a similar argument for developing countries. Owing to\nsearch frictions, both sectors simultaneously exist. In the competitive equilib-\nrium, wages in the productive sector are higher than those in the unproductive\nsector, as in Acemoglu (2001). Hence, workers who have the chance will change\njobs from the unproductive to the productive sector.4 We assume that the gov-\nernment will decide to introduce a minimum wage in the unproductive sector,\nwhich is, in principle, binding for the unproductive sector and equal to or\nsmaller than the competitive wage negotiated in the productive sector.\nOur first main result is that the minimum wage only unambiguously re-\nduces job creation and employment in the productive sector, whereas its em-\nployment effect on the unproductive sector is ambiguous. This result stems\n4We do not mean to say that the unproductive sector is truly unproductive, but simply\nless productive (in relative terms). Following Acemoglu (2001), we could also use the phrases\n\"good\" and \"bad\" jobs. Another rationale for such a dual labor market structure is given\nby Jones (1987), who applies a shirking framework and also introduces minimum wages in\nthe less productive sector. Whereas he finds a positive spillover to the productive sector, we\nwill see that our model generates a negative spillover.\nfrom the fact that a minimum wage in the unproductive sector ceteris paribus\nincreases the unemployed workers' outside option, as any employment in the\nunproductive sector now yields a higher wage. An increasing outside option\nimproves their bargaining position and ability to demand higher wages in the\nproductive sector (i.e. the reservation wage increases), leaving firms less willing\nto hire. However, if productive job creation falls, the chances of unproductive\nemployees to find employment in the productive sector will fall as well, and the\naverage duration of jobs in the unproductive sector will increase. On the one\nhand, this may trigger more job creation, on the other, higher wage costs de-\ncrease the incentive for job creation in the unproductive sector. Ultimately, the\nemployment effect in the unproductive sector depends on which of these effects\ndominates. What are the consequences of a minimum-wage-induced increase\nin the outside option for the productive sector? We find that even a decrease\nin job creation in the unproductive sector is not able to compensate for higher\nearnings when finding a job in the unproductive sector. Consequently, wage\ncosts always increase and job creation unambiguously falls in the productive\nsector. What are the overall effects on employment? While economy-wide\nunemployment increases whenever job creation in the unproductive sector de-\ncreases, the effects on unemployment are ambiguous whenever job creation\nin the unproductive sector increases (due to more inflows from the productive\nsector and more outflows to the unproductive sector). This implies that a min-\nimum wage targeting the unproductive sector in a two-sector search economy\nharms productive employment while its effects on unproductive employment\nare ambiguous. It seems especially noteworthy that even if aggregated employ-\nment rises, this is, in our model, at the cost of lower productive employment.\nAt first sight, this seems to worsen welfare. To analyze this issue, we fol-\nlow Pissarides (2000) by taking aggregated production minus search costs as\na welfare measure in order to investigate this conjecture. Our welfare measure\nfor the two-sector search model is in the spirit of the well-known Hosios condi-\ntion (Hosios, 1990), which states that social optimum is reached whenever the\nbargaining power of workers equals the matching elasticity. Given the labor\nmarket structure and search frictions in our model, job creation in the produc-\ntive sector in a competitive equilibrium tends to be too high from a welfare\npoint of view as individual firms in the productive sector do not take into ac-\ncount the effects of their vacancy posting on social costs, i.e. rising aggregate\nsearch costs. This even holds when the bargaining power of workers equals\nthe matching elasticity. Hence, the imposition of higher wage costs in the pro-\nductive sector (via the introduction of a minimum wage in the unproductive\nsector) may improve welfare as aggregate search costs fall due to a lower job\ncreation rate in the productive sector. Still, a minimum wage by itself will not\nbe able to generate a first-best outcome, since it can only insure ceteris paribus\noptimal job creation either in the productive or unproductive sector. In the\nequilibrium with a minimum wage, there will be \u00ad compared to the Hosios\nconditions applicable in our framework \u00ad still too (little) much job creation\nin the (un)productive sector because of suboptimal (superoptimal) wage costs\nin the (un)productive sector whenever the minimum wage is chosen according\nto the optimality condition in the unproductive (productive) sector because\nof the spillover effects. Hence, in such a model with search frictions and the\nexistence of a minimum wage, the first-best outcome can only be reached by\neither additionally subsidizing unproductive labor or taxing productive work,\ndepending on whether the minimum wage is chosen such as it yields optimal\njob creation in the productive or unproductive sector ceteris paribus.\nThe contribution of our paper is twofold. First, we are to the best of\nour knowledge the first to document a minimum-wage-induced spillover effect\nin a matching framework. We show that minimum wages may have nega-\ntive employment repercussions on sectors that are not targeted by minimum\nwages. Three other recent studies also stress the importance of spillover ef-\nfects. Lechthaler and Snower (2008) show that minimum wages may discourage\nfirms from adequately training low-skilled workers, potentially resulting in a\n\"low-skill trap\". Dolado et al. (2007) argue that positive spillover effects of\ntargeted employment protection legislation reforms on non-targeted workers\nmay be economically relevant. Finally, Falk et al. (2006) find evidence in\nfavor of a wage spillover effect due to the introduction of a minimum wage.\nSecond, we propose an alternative setup to augment the conventional matching\nframework by an additional sector, which might prove useful for other research\nquestions.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the\nbasic model. Section 3 pictures the competitive equilibrium, whereas section\n4 describes the equilibrium with minimum wages. In section 5, we analyze\nthe effects of minimum wages on job creation and employment, while section 6\nconducts a welfare assessment. Section 7 concludes. A mathematical appendix\nis added.\n2 The Basic Setup\ncontinuous time. We assume that workers are risk neutral, live infinitely, and\ndiscount the future at rate r. Worker population is normalized to one. Labor\nmarket frictions are captured by a matching function, assuming that a match\nbetween an unemployed worker and a vacancy is only realized if the joint\nsurplus from the match exceeds the sum of the values for both parties staying\nunmatched. This joint surplus is then split via Nash bargaining. There is free\nentry of vacancies, so that in equilibrium, the value of maintaining a vacancy\nequals zero. Matches are subject to idiosyncratic shocks, in which case they\nare dissolved. Hence, the rate of job destruction is assumed to be exogenous.\nSince we abstract from, for instance, dismissal costs, this assumption does not\nqualitatively change our results (see Pissarides, 2000).\nby allowing for a two-sector economy where sectors differ in their produc-\ntivity. Such productivity differences between two sectors reverting to a pool\nof homogenous workers can be motivated by structural differences within an\neconomy. For instance, Fuchs-Sch\u00a8\nundeln and Izem (2007) show that skill dif-\nferences between East and West German workers are negligible in contrast to\ndifferences in job characteristics. Furthermore, it is a well-established fact in\nthe growth literature that two sectors with identical labor productivity might\nexhibit different total factor productivities because one sector employs labor\nmore efficiently than the other sector.5 Hence, workers with a priori the same\nproductivity will be more (less) productive in relative terms if they are em-\nployed in the sector with higher (lower) productivity. This implies that workers\nmay be (i) unemployed (labelled by U), (ii) employed in the productive sector\nE or (iii) employed in the unproductive sector L. Unemployment is the resid-\nual state in the sense that workers whose employment in either the productive\nor unproductive sector ends due to an idiosyncratic shock flow back into un-\nemployment. We will see that, as a result of search frictions, both sectors\nsimultaneously exist, which also implies that wages in the productive sector\nare higher than those in the unproductive sector. In a fully competitive labor\nmarket, the wage differential would not exist (see e.g. Acemoglu, 2001).\n5The aim our theoretical framework is not to model these sectoral productivity differ-\nences, but to analyze potential consequences of their existence.\nThe labor market flows are graphically represented by Figure 1, where  is\nthe job destruction rate. We assume equal exogenous job destruction across\nsectors for simplicity without harming our results qualitatively. j\nq(j\n) is the\nrate at which unemployed workers will find a job in sector j = E, L. The job\nfinding rates result from a Cobb-Douglas matching function Mj\n= v\nj\nj\n,\nwhere vj\nis the number of vacancies in sector j, sj\nthe number of workers\nsearching for a sector j job, and 0 <  < 1 is the elasticity of the matching\nfunction.6 The assumption that both sectors have exactly the same matching\nfunction is for simplicity and highlights the fact that differences in the matching\nmatching technology are not the source of the results. Defining labor market\ntightness as j\n= vj\n/sj\nyields q(j\n) = Mj\n/vj\n= -\nj\nas the rate at which a\nvacancy in j will be filled, with q(j\n) = -(--1)\nj\n< 0. A searching worker\nwill find a job in sector j at rate j\nq(j\n) = Mj\n/sj\nj\n, with [j\nq(j\n)] =\nj\n= (1 - )q(j\n) > 0. It will become clear soon that, whenever\nan unemployed worker is simultaneously offered a job in the productive and\nthe unproductive sector, he will join the productive sector as the wages paid\nthere are higher. Further, any worker in the unproductive sector getting a job\noffer in the productive sector will change jobs for the same reason, while the\nopposite never holds. This labor market structure is similar to the modelling\nof two sectors by Albrecht et al. (2006). The flow equilibria are then given by\nequalizing flows into and out of sectors E, L and unemployment U, respectively.\nIn the following, we describe the value functions of employers and workers in\nmore detail and derive equilibrium. It is important to note that our results\nderived below do not change qualitatively once we assume job destruction rates\nbetween sectors to differ, or that the rate of finding jobs in sector E differs\ndepending on whether searchers are in state U or L, respectively. Hence, we\nassume equality for mathematical simplicity.\nLet Vj\nbe the present discounted value of a vacancy in sector j and Jj\nthat of a filled job. It is straightforward that Vj\ncan then be expressed by the\nBellman equation\nrVj\n= -k + q(j\n)[Jj\n- Vj\n6Petrolongo and Pissarides (2001) have shown that a Cobb-Douglas matching function is\na good approximation to picture the stylized facts of labor markets. Therefore, the loss of\ngenerality assuming a Cobb-Douglas matching function can be justified by the consistency\nof such a function with empirical facts. Furthermore, it simplifies the analysis later on.\nWhereas Boersma and van Ours (1999) propose that   1\n.\nU\nrr\nrrr\nrr\nr\nr\nj r\nr\nr\nr\nr\nr\nr\nr\n\n\nEq(E\n)\n\u00a8\n\u00a8\n\u00a8\n\u00a8\n\u00a8\n\u00a8\n\u00a8\n\u00a8\n\u00a8\n%\n\u00a8\n\u00a8\u00a8\n\u00a8\u00a8\u00a8\n\u00a8\u00a8\nB\n\nLq(L\n)\n'\nEq(E\n)\nFigure 1: Labor Market Flows\nwhere k denotes the per period search costs and\nrJj\n)y - wj\n+ [Vj\n- Jj\n] + (1 - j\n)E\nq(E\n)[VL\n- JL\nwhere wj\nrepresents the wage payment.

To see this, simply set L\n= 0. These fractions\nallow us to state that sL\n= u workers search for sector L jobs and sE\n= u+l =\n(1 - e) workers search for a job in sector E as those employed in sector L also\nlook for employment in E.\n3 The Competitive Equilibrium\nGiven the present-value functions for firms and workers, we now have to de-\ntermine how the positive rent of a match is divided between the worker and\nthe firm. Following Pissarides (2000), we assume that wages are determined\nby a Nash bargaining procedure where 0   < 1 is the bargaining power of\nworkers.8 The sharing rule is then given by Jj\n= (1 - )[Wj\n- U]. Using\nequations (2) and (5), wages turn out to be given by\nwj\n)y + (1 - ) {rU - (1 - j\n)E\nq(E\n)[WE\n- U]} .

From there, we know that e evolves according to \ne = (1 - e - l) \u00b7 E\nq(E\n) + l \u00b7\nE\nq(E\n)-e\u00b7 and l according to \nl = (1-e-l)\u00b7L\nq(L\n)-l\u00b7-l\u00b7E\nq(E\n), where the dotted\nvariables indicate changes over time. As changes over time are zero in the steady state, we\ncan solve the preceding equations for e and l. Bearing in mind that u = (1 - e - l), because\nthe population size is normalized to one, allows us to derive equations (6) to (8).\n8It could be reasonable to assume bargaining power of workers to be different in both\nsectors, for example assuming  =  + =  to be the bargaining power of workers in sector\nE and  the one in L. Again, this does not alter our results qualitatively, and hence we\nabstract from this issue.\nThis states that wages must, in general, be at least as high as the outside\noption of being unemployed, rU, and increase with increasing bargaining power\n, which determines the fraction of a match surplus obtained by the worker.\nBecause workers employed in L have a chance of finding employment in E,\nfirms are able to squeeze the wage payment (which sector L employees will\naccept according to the bargaining power represented by the last term on\nthe right-hand-side of equation (9)). It is straightforward to see that wages\nfor those workers employed in sector E exceed wages of those employed in\nL, wE\n> wL\nbecause of, first, the chance of sector L employees of finding\nemployment in sector E and, second, because of the productivity difference\n > 0. Using equations (3) and (4) as well as the sharing rule from the wage\nbargaining procedure to eliminate rU, competitive wages turn out to be\nwj\n=  {(1 + j\n)y + k [L\n+ j\nE\nSubstituting these wages into equation (3), the equilibrium job creation con-\nditions are given by\n(1 - )y = kL\n+ [r +  + E\nq(E\n)]\nk\nq(L\n)\nas the job creation condition for sector L (hereinafter JCL\n) and\n+ E\n] + (r + )\nk\nq(E\n)\nas the job creation condition for sector E (hereinafter JCE\n). Simultaneously\nsolving equations (11) and (12) determines the equilibrium values of market\ntightness in sectors L and E. Note that equations (11) and (12) both generate\ndownward sloping curves in a L\n/E\nspace which may cause existence and\nstability problems regarding the equilibrium.\nProposition 1. There always exists a unique and stable equilibrium in which\nboth sectors L and E are simultaneously active as long as   0.\nProof. See Appendix A.\nGiven L\nand E\nfrom solving equations (11) and (12), we are able to\ndetermine the steady-state fractions of workers employed in E, L and being\nunemployed, U, by equations (6), (7), and (8), respectively.\n4 Equilibrium with a Minimum Wage\nAssume now that there exists a government which considers wages paid in\nsector L \"not to be fair\" for whatever exogenously given reason (e.g. some\nnot explicitly modelled election campaigns, distributional considerations, an\n`equal work-equal pay' attitude, etc.) while it agrees with the wage payments\nin sector E. In order to correct for the \"unfair\" wage payments in sector L, the\ngovernment imposes a minimum wage m  [wL\n, wE\n] to lower the wage gap.9\nIn the presence of a minimum wage, the firms' \"asset pricing\" function in\nsector L, equation (2), re-writes to\nrJm\nL\n= y - m + [VL\n- Jm\nL\n] + E\nq(E\n)[VL\n- Jm\nL\nwhere the superscript m indicates the presence of a minimum wage, while the\nemployed sector L workers' present value of income is, referring to equation\n(5), represented by\nrWm\nL\n= m + [U - Wm\nL\n] + E\nq(E\n)[WE\n- Wm\nL\nNote that, in principle, nothing changes for sector E firms and employed sector\nE workers ceteris paribus, because the minimum wage is assumed to be equal\nto or below the wage bargained there. Further, market tightness in L and E is\ngiven from the individual worker's and firm's perspective. This implies that, for\ngiven L\nand E\n, sector L workers gain r[Wm\nL\n] = m-wL\n= m-[y+kL\n],\nwhere we define a = m - [y + kL\n] as the mark-up on the competitive wage\ninduced by the minimum wage, i.e. the additional payment exceeding the\nmarket wage.\nAs, in the presence of a binding minimum wage (i.e. m > wL\n), workers\nemployed in sector L attain higher wage payments, this feeds back on the\nutility of unemployment. The present value of income for unemployed work-\ners in the presence of a minimum wage can thus be expressed by rUm =\nE\nq(E\n)[WE\n- Um] + L\nq(L\n)[Wm\nL\n- Um]. Using the present value of income\nfor unemployed workers in the absence of a minimum wage, equation (4), and\nthe utility difference of being employed in sector L, [Wm\nL\n- WL\nminus equation (5), the utility difference of unemployment can be expressed\n9Note that we do not mean to make any judgment regarding fairness issues and are\nsimply interested in the steady-state employment and welfare effects of imposing some sort\nof minimum wage in one sector of a two-sector economy exogenously.\nas\nr[Um - U] =\nL\nq(L\n)\nr + L\nq(L\n)\n\u00b7 a =\nL\nq(L\n)\nr + L\nq(L\n)\n\u00b7 [m -\n=wL\n[y + kL\nwhich is greater than zero as long as a > 0 (i.e. the minimum wage is binding)\nfor given market tightness in E and L.\nHence, even though sector E is not directly influenced by the minimum\nwage in L, the potentially increased utility of unemployment, as represented\nby equation (15), generates feedback. To see this, remember how wages are\nbargained. We know that the wage is a fraction of the match-specific payoff\n(depending on the bargaining power of workers) plus the utility of unemploy-\nment. As the latter changes in the presence of a minimum wage, so does the\nwage bargained in sector E, which now yields wm\nE\nequation (9)). Using equation (15) and rUm = rU + r[Um - U] to eliminate\nrUm, we get\nwm\nE\n= [(1 + )y + k(L\n+ E\n)] + (1 - )\nL\nq(L\n)\nr + L\nq(L\n)\nAs long as there is no binding minimum wage (i.e. a = 0), the wage bargained\nin sector E is the competitive one. Using the minimum wage and a = m-[y+\nkL\n], we can express the job creation condition for sector L in the presence of\na minimum wage (hereinafter JCm\nL\n) as\n(1 - )y = km\nL\n+ [r +  + m\nE\nq(m\nE\n)]\nk\nq(m\nL\n)\n+ a\n y - m = [r +  + m\nE\nq(m\nE\n)]\nk\nq(m\nL\n)\nSubstitution of equation (16) into equation (2) gives the job creation condition\nfor sector E in the presence of a minimum wage (hereinafter JCm\nE\n) as\nL\n+ m\nE\n] + (r + )\nk\nq(m\nE\n)\n+\nm\nL\nq(m\nL\n)\nr + m\nL\nq(m\nL\n)\n\u00b7 a\nm\nL\nq(m\nL\n)\nr + m\nL\nq(m\nL\n)\n(m - y) =\nk\nr + m\nL\nq(m\nL\n)\nr + m\nL\nq(m\nL\n)\nm\nL\n+ m\nE\n+ (r + )\nk\nq(m\nE\n)\nwhere the superscript m on the equilibrium values indicates that this is the\nsituation in the presence of a minimum wage. Simultaneously solving equations\n(17) and (18) determines the equilibrium values for market tightness in sectors\nL and E in the presence of a minimum wage m\nL\nand m\nE\n. For a = 0 (i.e.\nthere exists no binding minimum wage), the equilibrium boils down to the\ncompetitive equilibrium. It is furthermore a straightforward matter to show\nand handy to remember that, for a minimum wage equal to sector L wage\npayments, i.e. m = wL\n, the equilibrium values for market tightness in sectors\nL and E will be the same, i.e. L\n= m\nL\nand E\n= m\nE\nProposition 2. There always exists a unique and stable equilibrium in which\nboth sectors L and E are active in the presence of a minimum wage as long as\n  0 and y > m.\nProof. See Appendix B.\nAgain, given m\nL\nand m\nE\nfrom solving equations (17) and (18), we are now\nable to determine the fractions of workers employed in E, L and being unem-\nployed, U, in the presence of a minimum wage m by equations (6), (7), and\n(8), respectively.\n5 Comparing Equilibria\nIn order to analyze the employment effects of an increase of the minimum\nwage m  [wL\n, y[ (see Proposition 2), we totally differentiate equations (17)\nand (18), which yields\n-[r +  + m\nE\nq(m\nE\n)]\nk\nm\nL\nq(m\nL\n)\ndm\nL\nq(m\nE\n)\nq(m\nL\n)\ndm\nE\nand\n- k\nr + m\nL\nq(m\nL\n)\nr + m\nL\nq(m\nL\n)\na \u00b7 r \u00b7 q(m\nL\n)\n[r + m\nL\nq(m\nL\ndm\nL\n- (r + )\nk\nm\nE\nq(m\nE\n)\n+ k dm\nE\nm\nL\nq(m\nL\n)\n[r + m\nL\nq(m\nL\n)]\nrespectively. We have made use of the fact that da = dm - kdL\nand the\nCobb-Douglas matching function which implies 0 <  = -jq(j)\nq(j)\nFrom equation (19) we see that, as already indicated above, market tight-\nness L\nceteris paribus decreases with increasing market tightness E\nbecause\n10For this to hold, the job creation conditions for sectors L and E in the absence and in\nthe presence of a minimum wage have to be the same. After subtracting equation (11) from\nequation (17) and equation (12) from equation (18), we find that this is unambiguously the\ncase for m = [y + kL\n] = wL\n.\na higher probability of finding a job in E for workers reduces the average du-\nration of a job in L and, thus, reduces the incentive for job creation there.\nFurther, a higher minimum wage m increases labor costs and, therefore, also\nreduces the incentive for job creation in L.\nEquation (20) states that job creation in E (represented by market tightness\nE\n) decreases with increasing market tightness L\nand the minimum wage m\nceteris paribus. This is because both increase the workers' outside option (L\nbecause of the higher probability of finding a job in L and m because of higher\npayments whenever a job in L is found) which increases wage costs in sector\nE, see equation (16). This reduces the incentives for job creation.\nTo calculate the final effects of an increase in the minimum wage on job\ncreation in L and E, we have to combine all these effects. In doing so, we find,\nafter rearranging equations (19) and (20) that (calculations can be retraced in\nAppendix D)\ndm\nL\ndm\n=\nL\nq(m\nE\n)\n[r+m\nL\nq(m\nL\n)]\n- k - (r + ) k\nm\nE\nq(m\nE\n)\n| ^\nJ|\nand\ndm\nE\ndm\n= -\n[r + m\nL\nq(m\nL\n)] + (1 - )m\nL\nq(m\nL\n)\nm\nL\n[r + m\nL\nq(m\nL\n)] \u00b7 | ^\nJ|\ny\n+\n[r + m\nL\nq(m\nL\n)] + (1 - )m\nL\nq(m\nL\n)\nm\nL\n[r + m\nL\nq(m\nL\n)] \u00b7 | ^\nJ|\nm\n-\nL\nq(m\nL\n)\n[r+m\nL\nq(m\nL\n)]\n+ m\nL\nq(m\nL\n)\nm\nL\n[r + m\nL\nq(m\nL\n)] \u00b7 | ^\nJ|\nwhere | ^\nJ| > 0 as shown in Appendices B and C. Note that, referring to\nequation (22), we know that\n[r + m\nL\nq(m\nL\n)] + (1 - )m\nL\nq(m\nL\n)\n[r + m\nL\nq(m\nL\n)] + (1 - )m\nL\nq(m\nL\n)\nwhile y\nm\n> 1 is a necessary condition in order for both sectors to exist (see\nProposition 2). Thus, from equations (21) and (22), we see that an increase\nin the minimum wage in sector L decreases job creation in sector E as long as\ny > m while its effects on job creation in sector L itself are ambiguous. This\nimplies that a minimum wage in the unproductive sector may indeed yield\nhigher job creation in this sector compared to a situation without minimum\nwages (nevertheless, the opposite may also hold true). However, the minimum\nwage unambiguously reduces job creation in the productive sector which is\nindeed not directly influenced by it.11 From an intuitive point of view, this\nmay seem odd at first sight and certainly warrants some explanation.\nAs we already know, the increase of the minimum wage increases wage costs\nin L, which reduces job creation in L ceteris paribus. Further, it augments the\nworkers' outside option ceteris paribus and thus increases labor costs in sector\nE which reduces the incentive for job creation in E. This reduced job creation\nin E decreases the likelihood that employees in L will find employment in E\nand thus leave sector L. Hence, the firms' discounting in sector L is decreased\nwhich ceteris paribus increases the incentive for job creation in L. Regarding\nsector E, the potential decrease in job creation in sector L, however, is not\nable to compensate for the increase in expected wage costs, which implies\nthat the workers' outside option and thus wage costs in E will unambiguously\nincrease even though sector E is not directly affected by the minimum wage.\nTherefore, job creation in E unambiguously falls (see equation (22)). Whether\njob creation in L ultimately rises or falls depends crucially on whether higher\nwage costs or reduced discounting dominate (see equation (21), where the\nfirst term of the denominator on the right-hand side represents the reduced\ndiscounting effect and the second term the higher wage effect).\nTo be more precise, let's rearrange the numerator on the right-hand side\nof equation (21) to find that job creation in the unproductive sector rises if\n(1 - )kq(E\n)\nq(L\n)\n-k - (r + ) k\nEq(E\n)\n= dE\ndm |JCE\nL\nq(L\n)\nr + L\nq(L\n)\n=dE\nwhere dE\ndm |JCE\nindicates by how much job creation in E decreases ceteris paribus\ndue to an increase in the minimum wage (see equation (20)). This has to be\nmultiplied by how much this decrease in E\nceteris paribus affects the incentive\nfor job creation in sector L resulting from a change in discounting, dE\n(see equation (19)). Thus, dE\ndm |JCE\n\u00b7 dE\n> 0 is the indirect effect of the\nintroduction of a minimum wage for sector L on job creation in sector L\n(resulting from reduced job creation in E and, hence, changes in average job\nduration). If this indirect effect dominates the direct effect of an increase in\nminimum wages, i.e. -1 \u00b7 dm (see equation (19)), job creation in L rises.\nOtherwise, it falls. To put it differently, only if the reduction in the risk of\n11Note that equations (21) and (22) also hold true for the introduction of a minimum\nwage, which initially implies a = 0.\nlosing a sector L worker to sector E because of less productive job creation is\nhigh enough and, thus, sufficiently prolongs the expected duration of a sector\nL job, higher wage costs can be overcompensated and job creation in L can\nrise. Whether or not this is the case, of course, depends on the parametric\nspecification of the model and will ultimately be an empirical question.\nOur results imply that the introduction of a minimum wage unambiguously\ndecreases employment in the productive sector E as E\nfalls (see equations\n(22) and (6)). If the fall in E\nis not large enough to compensate for the\nhigher wage payments in L (i.e. condition (24) does not hold), job creation in\nsector L also falls. This implies less job creation in sectors L and E, which\nunambiguously generates higher unemployment (see equation (8)). The effects\non sector L employment are then ambiguous (see equation (7)) because, while\nthe job finding rate in sector L for unemployed workers has fallen, the pool of\nunemployment has increased. On the contrary, if the reduction in E\nis large\nenough to generate additional job creation in L (i.e. condition (24) holds), this\nunambiguously increases employment l due to higher job creation in L and less\njob creation in E (see equation (7)), whereas, the effects on unemployment are\nambiguous (see equation (8)).\nHence, we find that a minimum wage may increase the overall level of\nemployment. But even if overall employment rises, however, this comes at the\ncost of lower levels of productive and higher levels of unproductive employment.\n6 Welfare Implications\nThe above findings, of course, make it necessary to assess some welfare implica-\ntions of minimum wages in our setup. Regarding welfare, we follow Pissarides\n(2000) and take the present value of production (minus search costs) as a\nwelfare measure which is given by\n =\n\ne-rt[(1 + )y \u00b7 e + y \u00b7 l - kL\n\u00b7 (1 - e - l)\n=u\n-kE\nwhere (1+)y\u00b7e equals the current level of production in the productive sector,\ny\u00b7l is the current level of production in the unproductive sector, kL\nkE\n(1 - e) constitutes total search costs and t represents time. Wages are not\ntaken into account separately as they only determine how current production\nis distributed among workers and firms. Employment e and l evolve over time\naccording to (see also Figure 1 and footnote 7)\n\ne =\nde\ndt\n= (1 - e)E\nq(E\nand\n\nl =\ndl\ndt\n= (1 - e - l) \u00b7 L\nq(L\n) - l \u00b7  - l \u00b7 E\nq(E\nBy maximizing equation (25) subject to (26) and (27) and some rearranging,\nwe can describe the socially optimal values of market tightness L\nand market\ntightness E\nby the following two equations (calculations are, in principle, in\nperfect analogy to Pissarides, 2000, p. 189 and are therefore not repeated\nhere).\n(1 - )y = k\nL\n+ [r +  + \nE\nq(\nE\n)]\nk\nq(\nL\n)\nas the optimal job creation condition in sector L (hereinafter JC\nL\n) and\nL\n+\nE\n)+(r+)\nk\nq(\nE\n)\n+k\nL\n[r +  + \nE\nq(\nE\n)]\n[ + \nL\nq(\nL\n) + \nE\nq(\nE\n)]\nas the optimal job creation condition in sector E (hereinafter JC\nE\n), where the\nsuperscript  indicates that these are the welfare-optimal values. Again, it can\nbe shown in analogy to the proofs of Propositions 1 and 2 that the JCE\ncurve's\nL\n-axis intercept is higher than the one of the JC\nL\ncurve as long as   0,\nand that the JC\nE\ncurve intersects the E\n-axis while the JC\nL\ncurve never\ndoes. Therefore, the curves intersect. Thus, these two equations determine\nthe socially optimal levels of market tightness \nL\nand \nE\n. For the competitive\nmarket to reach a first-best allocation, market tightness L\nand E\n, given by\nequations (11) and (12), have to equal market tightness \nL\nand \nE\n, given by\nequations (28) and (29). As we directly see, this will generally not be the case\nwhich implies that the competitive equilibrium is likely to be inefficient.\nThe result that the market equilibrium is, generally, inefficient is not new\nin a model with search frictions. In the standard one sector economy, the\nwell-known Hosios condition states that matching efficiency  must equal the\nworkers' bargaining power  in order to achieve an efficient solution (see Hosios,\nand equation (12) with equation (29), we see that this ceteris paribus generates\nan \"optimal\" job creation condition for sector L. However, even then, in the\nmarket equilibrium, there is still too much job creation in the productive sector\nE (formally captured by a different last term on the rhs of equation (29)).\nCorrespondingly, there will be too little job creation in L in the competitive\nequilibrium because dL\n/dE\n< 0. This implies that the Hosios condition by\nitself (namely,  = ) is not sufficient to generate an efficient market outcome\nin a two-sector search economy.\nThe reason for this is as follows. Due to the productivity advantage  > 0,\nfirms are too eager to create jobs in the productive sector from a social planner's\nperspective as they fail to internalize the congestion externality caused by\nindividual vacancy posting in E. Too many vacancies, however, expand search\nduration and, thus, increase search costs for the entire economy. Thus, from a\nwelfare point of view, there is a trade-off between a higher level of production\n(caused by the increase in the number of sector E jobs) and higher search\ncosts (caused by the congestion externality). This even holds whenever the\nbargaining power of workers  coincidentally equals the matching elasticity  as\nimplied by the standard Hosios condition. To put it differently, in the optimal\nequilibrium (given by equations (28) and (29)) compared to the competitive\nmarket equilibrium (given by equations (11) and (12)), the productivity loss\nfrom a decline in the number of productive jobs is compensated for by lower\nsearch costs and growth of unproductive jobs. Hence, the social planner would\nchose fewer productive and more unproductive jobs rather than end up in the\ncompetitive equilibrium. Therefore, the Hosios condition must be modified in\na two-sector search model as labor costs in sector E are too low even when\nThis implies that a minimum wage in L, even though it is comes the cost of\nless productive employment, may be welfare-enhancing because it may exactly\ndo what a social planner would do, i.e. generate higher labor costs and, thus,\nfewer jobs in E and \u00ad potentially \u00ad more jobs in L (i.e. if condition (24) holds).\nHowever, comparing the optimality conditions with the equilibrium conditions\nin the presence of a minimum wage, i.e. equation (28) with equation (17) and\n(29) with equation (18), we find that the social optimal solution cannot be\nreached by choosing a minimum wage alone. By subtracting equation (28) from\nequation (17), we find that the mark-up a should be chosen as to compensate\nfor the difference between matching elasticity and bargaining power,\na\nL\n= ( - )[y + kL\n]  m = [y + kL\nThe subtraction of equation (29) from equation (18), however, yields\na\nE\n=\n( - )\n\u00b7\nr + L\nq(L\n)\nL\nq(L\n)\n[(1 + )y + k(L\n+ E\n)]\n+\nk\nq(L\n)\n\u00b7\n[r +  + E\nq(E\n)]\n[ + L\nq(L\n) + E\nq(E\n)]\n[r + L\nq(L\n)],\nwhich unambiguously exceeds the previous \"optimal\" minimum wage (a\nL\n<\na\nE\n). This implies that there is no one minimum wage to achieve the optimal\nequilibrium solution. Even if the minimum wage is chosen such that one of\nthe two optimality conditions, i.e. equations (28) or (29), holds, the other one\nis not fulfilled and the outcome under minimum wages will still be inefficient\ncompared to the optimum. Nevertheless, we can basically learn three things\nthat are important for choosing an adequate minimum wage.\nFirst, if the bargaining power of workers falls short of the matching elastic-\nity, i.e.  < , a binding minimum wage \u00ad if accordingly chosen (i.e. a  a\nL\n)\n\u00ad is likely to improve welfare as it may drive the equilibrium closer to the\noptimality condition for sector L . This result is in the spirit of findings for\nmonopsony models or models with monopsonistic competition (and relatively\nfew competitors on the labor demand side). Minimum wages may be welfare-\nimproving if they are able to decrease the \"abuse\" of power by those who\ndemand labor.\nSecond, if the bargaining power of workers exceeds the matching elasticity,\ni.e  > , labor costs for unproductive work \u00ad already too high measured in\nterms of the optimality condition \u00ad will be increased further, while the con-\ndition for optimal productive work, i.e. a\nE\n, can theoretically be fulfilled. In\nthis case, however, the government must implement additional measures to\ncompensate for the labor costs in the unproductive sector. From the perspec-\ntive of these two points, a minimum wage itself only seems to make sense as\nlong as the bargaining power of workers is small (relative to the matching elas-\nticity). Otherwise, the introduction of a minimum wage would, according to\nour framework, cost productive labor (see section 5) and also decrease welfare\nwhenever no other measures are taken by the government to compensate for\nthis loss.\nThird, to make this point very clear, a minimum wage optimally chosen for\neither the unproductive or productive sector (according to the two previous\nequations for a\nL\nor a\nE\n) must additionally be supplemented by either subsidiz-\ning unproductive labor (if the minimum wage is chosen to generate the optimal\nproductive job creation condition, a = a\nE\n) to not make labor costs for unpro-\nductive work too high, or by taxing productive labor (if the minimum wage is\nchosen to generate optimal job creation in the unproductive sector, a = a\nL\n)\nin order to compensate for the congestion externality caused by the fact that,\nfrom an individual perspective, it is still more attractive to create jobs in the\nmore productive sector.\n7 Conclusions\nWe have presented a two-sector search model that extends the matching frame-\nintroducing an additional sector. The economy consists of a productive and\nan unproductive sector, but following a modified approach of Albrecht et al.\n(2006), both sectors revert to the same pool of homogeneous workers. In the\ncompetitive equilibrium, wages paid in the productive sector are higher than\nthose paid in the unproductive sector as in Acemoglu (2001). We assume that,\nin order to compensate for this wage gap, the government decides to introduce\na minimum wage in the unproductive sector which is smaller than (or, at most,\nequal to) the competitive wage bargained in the productive sector.\nOur first main result is that the minimum wage unambiguously reduces job\ncreation and employment only in the productive sector, while its employment\neffect on the unproductive sector is ambiguous. This result stems from the fact\nthat a minimum wage in the unproductive sector ceteris paribus increases the\nunemployed workers' outside option, as any employment in the unproductive\nsector now yields a higher wage. An increasing outside option improves their\nbargaining position and ability to demand higher wages in the productive sec-\ntor, leaving firms less willing to hire. However, if productive job creation falls,\nthe chances of unproductive employees of finding employment in the produc-\ntive sector will fall as well, and the average duration of jobs increases in the\nunproductive sector. On the one hand, this may trigger more job creation;\non the other hand, however, higher wage costs decrease the incentive for job\ncreation in the unproductive sector. Ultimately, the employment effect in the\nunproductive sector depends on which of these effects dominates. What are\nthe consequences of a minimum-wage-induced increase in the outside option\nfor the productive sector? We find that even a decrease in job creation in\nthe unproductive sector is not able to compensate for higher earnings from a\njob found in the unproductive sector. Consequently, wage costs of employees\nalways increase and job creation unambiguously falls in the productive sector.\nWhat are the overall effects on employment? While economy-wide unemploy-\nment increases whenever job creation in the unproductive sector decreases,\nthe effects on unemployment are ambiguous whenever job creation in the un-\nproductive sector increases (due to more inflows from the productive sector\nand more outflows to the unproductive sector). This implies that a minimum\nwage in a two-sector search economy harms productive employment, while its\neffects on the unproductive sector are ambiguous. It is especially noteworthy\nthat, even if aggregated employment rises, this comes at a cost to productive\nemployment.\nAt first sight, this seems to worsen welfare. However, following Pissarides\n(2000) and taking aggregated production minus search costs as a welfare mea-\nsure, we are able to calculate an analogue to the well-known Hosios condition\nin the two-sector search economy. In the conventional matching model, the\nHosios condition states that social optimum is reached whenever the bargain-\ning power of workers equals the matching elasticity. We draw the following\nconclusions with respect to welfare from our model. A minimum wage that\nexceeds the competitive wage in the unproductive sector of a two-sector search\neconomy is most likely welfare-improving if the bargaining power of workers\nis sufficiently low (i.e. it falls short of the matching elasticity). Nevertheless,\na single minimum wage cannot yield the first-best solution because there may\nstill be too much job creation in the productive sector (thus making search\ncosts are high) from a welfare perspective. Hence, the government must addi-\ntionally impose taxes in the productive sector to increase labor costs or, when\nchoosing the minimum wage that makes labor costs in the productive sector\nsufficiently high, subsidize employment in the unproductive sector. The mini-\nmum wage alone is not able to achieve social optimum. However, all this can\nonly be achieved at the cost of less productive employment. We would like to\nunderline once more that these welfare implications crucially depend on the\nparameters on bargaining power and the matching elasticity. Policymakers\nthat take the introduction of a minimum wage into consideration should care-\nfully seek empirical estimates for these parameters. Flinn (2006), for example,\nfinds that the workers' bargaining power exceeds the matching elasticity (al-\nthough not by much) in the United States. Irrespective of the exact estimates,\npolicymakers have to bear in mind that a minimum wage in the unproductive\nsector will unambiguously reduce employment in the productive sector.\nThere are, however, some limitations in the analysis presented above. The\nconventional monopsonistic competition assumes that, first, minimum wages\ncreate incentives for innovation or education which, in turn, increase (aggre-\ngated) productivity (see Lechthaler and Snower, 2008, as a recent example).\nIf that were the case in our model, the incentive to reduce job creation in the\nunproductive sector would decline. Second, one should carefully examine the\nrole of competitive wage setting. The above analysis is conducted for indi-\nvidual wage bargaining. However, we know that wage setting plays a role for\nlabor market outcomes concerning taxation (see e.g. Sinko, 2007), employment\nprotection and/or experience rating (see e.g. Baumann and St\u00a8\nSt\u00a8\nahler, 2008). Therefore, the wage setting structure may also play a role\nwhenever we consider a two-sector economy in which competitive wages are\nset by, for example, unions. We leave these issues for further research because\n\u00ad as simple as the model may be \u00ad the effects and results in the present paper\nhave, to the best of our knowledge, not been analyzed before. Further, we offer\nan alternative way to introduce sectoral differences into matching models that\nmay also be useful for addressing other questions.\nMathematical Appendix\nA Proof of Proposition 1\nFrom totally differentiating equation (11) we know that the JCL\ncurve is down-\nward sloping in a L\n/E\nspace and, from equation (11) itself, that, as L\nap-\nproaches zero, E\napproaches infinity. The JCE\ncurve is also downward sloping\nin a L\n/E\nspace. However, for L\n= 0, there exists a positive level of E\nbe-\nyond which L\nwould turn negative. This implies that, as long as the L\n-axis\nintercept of the JCE\ncurve is above the one of the JCL\ncurve, the curves must\nintersect and, thus, there will exist an equilibrium. Assuming E\nmoment and dividing the left- and right-hand sides of equations (12) by those\nof equation (11), we see that this yields\n+ (r + )\nwhere L|JCE\nis the axis intercept of the JCE\ncurve and L|JCL\nthat of the\nJCL\ncurve, respectively. We see that as long as  > 0, i.e. as long as there\nis a productivity advantage in sector E as presumed, the JCE\n's axis intercept\nmust be larger than the one of the JCL\n(because the right-hand side is greater\none which implies that, for the left-hand side to be that, too, L|JCE\nhas to hold). Note that the same holds for  = 0.\nRegarding stability, we know that the determinant of the Jacobian ( ~\nJ) of\nthe system of equations (11) and (12) is given by (calculations can be retraced\nin Appendix C)\n| ~\nJ| = [r +  + E\nq(E\n)]\nk\nL\nq(L\n)\n+ k \u00b7 [r + ]\nk\nE\nq(E\n)\n+ k\nq(E\n)\nq(L\n)\nwhich has, in principle, an ambiguous sign. We know, however, that both\ncurves are monotonically falling. As the JCE\ncurve's L\n-axis intercept in a\nL\n/E\nspace is larger than the one of the JCL\ncurve, and as the JCE\ncurve\nturns negative for some positive level of E\n, while the JCL\ncurve does not,\nthe JCE\ncurve must be steeper than the JCL\ncurve in equilibrium (i.e. when\nboth curves intersect). This implies that | ~\nJ| > 0 for the equilibrium values of\nL\nand E\n(see Appendix C for more formal details). Still, the equilibrium is\nstable as\ntr ~\nJ = -[r +  + E\nq(E\n)]\nk\nL\nq(L\n)\n- [r + ]\nk\nE\nq(E\n)\nwhich implies that the equilibrium is a stable node. Thus, the equilibrium\nunambiguously exists and is unique and stable as long as   0.\nB Proof of Proposition 2\nFrom equation (17) we see that, as long as y > m, it is worth opening a\nvacancy in L. Otherwise, the minimum wage would exceed marginal worker's\nproductivity and, thus, sector L would be destroyed (i.e L\n= 0). Hence, the\nmaximum minimum wage for both sectors to simultaneously exist is restricted\nby y.\nFurther, as in the competitive equilibrium, the JCm\nL\ncurve is downward\nsloping in an L\n/E\nspace. E\napproaches infinity as L\napproaches zero (i.e.\nthe JCm\nL\ncurve always takes positive values). From the JCm\nE\ncurve, equation\n(18), it is straightforward to see that there is a positive level of E\non the\ndownward sloping JCm\nE\ncurve for which L\nturns negative. Again, the L\n-axis\nintercept of the JCm\nE\ncurve in a L\n/E\nspace is above the one of the JCm\nL\ncurve\nfor   0. This becomes obvious by assuming m\nE\n= 0 and dividing both sides\nof equations (18) by both sides of equation (17), which yields\nkm\n\u00b7 a\nkm\n+ (r + )m\n+ a\nBecause 0 < m\nL\nq(m\nL\n)\nr+m\nL\nq(m\nL\n)\n> m\nas long as   0.\nHence, both curves intersect. The determinant of the Jacobian of the system\n| ^\nJ| = [r +  + m\nE\nq(m\nE\n)]\nk\nm\nL\nq(m\nL\n)\n[r + ]\nk\nm\nE\nq(m\nE\n)\n+ k\nq(m\nE\n)\nq(m\nL\n)\nk\nr + m\nL\nq(m\nL\n)\nr + m\nL\nq(m\nL\n)\na \u00b7 r \u00b7 q(m\nL\n)\n[r + m\nL\nq(m\nL\nwhich has, in equilibrium, a positive sign (| ^\nJ| > 0) for the same reasons as in\nthe competitive equilibrium (again, see Appendix C for more details). Never-\ntheless, the equilibrium is a stable node because\ntr ^\nJ = -[r +  + m\nE\nq(m\nE\n)]\nk\nm\nL\nq(m\nL\n)\n- [r + ]\nk\nm\nE\nq(m\nE\n)\nC Stability of Equilibrium\nTotally differentiating the equilibrium conditions of the competitive outcome,\n- [r +  + E\nq(E\n)]\nk\nL\nq(L\n)\n+ k dL\nq(E\n)\nq(L\n)\ndE\nand\n-kdL\n- [r + ]\nk\nE\nq(E\n)\n+ k dE\nwhere use has been made of the fact that 0 <  = -jq(j)\nq(j)\n< 1 and dexo\ncaptures all the differentials in the exogenously given parameters. It is then\na straightforward matter to calculate the Jacobian of the system of equations\n| ~\nJ| and the trace of the system of equations tr ~\nJ given by equations (32) and\nWe know that | ~\nJ| > 0 must hold in equilibrium because, as the JCE\ncurve's\nL\n-axis intercept is larger than the one of the JCL\ncurve, and because the JCE\ncurves turns negative for a positive level of E\nin the L\n/E\nspace while the\nJCL\ncurve does not, the JCE\ncurve must be steeper than the JCL\ncurve (at\nleast until but most likely beyond the E\n-axis intercept). We know that\nSlope JCL\n=\ndL\ndE\n= -\nAA\nq(E\n)\nq(L\n)\n[r +  + E\nq(E\n)]\nk\nL\nq(L\n)\n+ k\nand\nSlope JCE\n=\ndL\ndE\n= -\n[r + ]\nk\nE\nq(E\n)\n+ k\nkd\nFor the JCE\ncurve to be steeper, -CC\nDD\n< -AA\nBB\n, which implies CC\nDD\n> AA\nBB\n, must\nhold. Multiplying out gives | ~\nJ| = BB \u00b7CC -AA\u00b7DD > 0 (see equation (32)).\nRegarding the situation with a binding minimum wage, the totally differ-\nentiated equilibrium conditions in the presence of a minimum wage, equations\nequations, it is straightforward to calculate the determinant of the Jacobian of\nthis system of equations as given in equation (35) while the corresponding trace\nis given by equation (36). The same formal argument regarding the slope's of\nthe JCL\nand JCE\ncurves can be made in order to find | ^\nJ| > 0. It is easy\nto see that the qualitative properties are the same as under the competitive\nequilibrium and, thus, the equilibrium is stable.\nD Comparative Statics under Minimum\nWages\nUsing equations (19) and (20), we know that, writing in matrix form and\nrearranging, dm\nL\nand dm\nE\ncan be expressed as\ndm\nL\ndm\nE\n=\n| ^\nJ|\n\u00b7\n\n\n- [r + ] k\nm\nE\nq(m\nE\n)\n+ k\nkr+m\nL\nq(m\nL\n)\nr+m\nL\nq(m\nL\n)\n+ (1 - )(1 - ) a\u00b7r\u00b7q(m\nL\n)\n[r+m\nL\nq(m\nL\n(1 - )kq(m\nE\n)\nq(m\nL\n)\n- [r +  + m\nE\nq(m\nE\n)] k\nm\nL\nq(m\nL\n)\n\n \u00d7\n\u00d7\nL\nq(m\nL\n)\nr+m\nL\nq(m\nL\n)\ndm,\nwhere | ^\nJ| is given by equation (35).
