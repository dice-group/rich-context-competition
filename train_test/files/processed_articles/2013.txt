Results from studies on the association between\nnon-alcoholic fatty liver disease and mortality have been\ninconsistent,15-20 but these studies were limited by the use of\nsmall, highly selected patient populations (for example, those\nafter liver biopsy) or by the use of liver enzyme measurements\nas surrogate markers of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.21-23\nFurthermore, since non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is strongly\nassociated with obesity and diabetes, whether it is an\nindependent risk factor for all cause and cardiovascular death\nremains controversial, as many previous studies failed to account\nfully for adiposity.\nWe prospectively determined the association of non-alcoholic\nfatty liver disease with mortality in the US general population.\nWe hypothesised that such disease would be associated with an\nincreased risk of mortality from all causes, cardiovascular\ndisease, cancer, and liver disease. We also hypothesised that\nthe risk of death would be higher in participants with\nnon-alcoholic fatty liver disease and increased liver enzyme\nlevels, potentially representing the presence of non-alcoholic\nsteatohepatitis.\nCorrespondence to: M Lazo mlazo@jhsph.edu\nExtra material supplied by the author (see http://www.bmj.com/content/343/bmj.d6891/suppl/DC1)\nResults of sensitivity analyses\nNo commercial reuse: See rights and reprints http://www.bmj.com/permissions Subscribe: http://www.bmj.com/subscribe\nResearch\nRESEARCH\nMethods\nWe used data from the Third National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES III) and the Third National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey Mortality Follow-up\nstudies.

After exclusions, the analytical sample for the main\nanalyses included 11 371 adults. All participants signed\ninformed consent.\nData collection\nThe participants underwent an interview in which standardised\nquestionnaires were used to obtain self reported data on sex,\nage, race or ethnicity, education, income, smoking, alcohol\nconsumption, physical activity, prevalent medical conditions,\nand drug use.24 Smoking status was categorised as never, former,\nand current smoker. History of cardiovascular disease was\ndefined as a self reported history of acute myocardial infarction,\nstroke, or heart failure. History of cancer was defined as a self\nreported history of any cancer. People were categorised as\nsedentary if they answered no to all the questions on engaging\nin any of the following activities over the past month: jog or\nrun, cycle, swim, aerobics, other dancing, calisthenics, garden\nor yard work, weight lifting, or other sports. Average daily\nalcohol consumption was estimated by multiplying the number\nof drinking days over the past 12 months and the number of\ndrinks, on average, on a drinking day and dividing by 365. Never\ndrinkers replied no to the question: \"In your entire life, have\nyou had at least 12 drinks of any kind of alcoholic beverage?\"\nIncreased alcohol consumption was defined as one drink or\nmore daily among women and two drinks or more daily among\nStandardised measurements of height, weight, waist\ncircumference, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure were\nobtained. Body mass index was calculated.\nSerum biochemistries were done using the Hitachi 737\nautomated multichannel chemistry analyser (Boehringer\nMannheim Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN).26 Liver tests\ndetermined levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine\naminotransferase, -glutamyltransferase, alkaline phosphatase,\nand total bilirubin. The levels of alanine aminotransferase or\naspartate aminotransferase were considered raised if they were\nabove the upper limit of normal of the National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey laboratory values (alanine\naminotransferase >40 U/L for men and >31 U/L for women;\naspartate aminotransferase >37 U/L for men and >31 U/L for\nwomen).26 The presence of antibodies to hepatitis C was tested\nusing a second generation enzyme immunoassay (Abbott\nLaboratories, Chicago, IL) and confirmed by the MATRIX\nassay (Abbott Laboratories). Antibodies to hepatitis B core\nantigen were measured using a solid phase competitive\nimmunoassay (Abbott Laboratories). Serum iron levels and total\niron binding capacity were measured calorimetrically (Alpkem\nRFA analyzer, Clackamas, OR). Serum ferritin levels were\nmeasured using the BioRad Quantimmune IRMA kit (BioRad\nLaboratories, Hercules, CA). Serum transferrin saturation was\ncalculated as [serum iron (mol/L)/serum total iron binding\ncapacity (mol/L)]\u00d7100.

Based on these findings and using a standardised\nalgorithm,30 we categorised the degree of steatosis first as a four\nlevel variable (none, mild, moderate, or severe steatosis) and\nthen recoded as a two level variable: none to mild and moderate\nto severe. The intra-rater and inter-rater  statistics for reliability\nof the two level variable were 0.77 (95% confidence interval\nIn the absence of a standard definition, we defined non-alcoholic\nfatty liver disease as the presence of moderate to severe hepatic\nsteatosis with normal liver enzymes levels. Non-alcoholic\nsteatohepatitis was defined as the presence of moderate to severe\nhepatic steatosis with increased levels of liver enzymes, in the\nabsence of antibodies to hepatitis B and hepatitis C and without\nevidence of iron overload. For the non-alcoholic steatohepatitis\ngroup we decided to exclude people with viral hepatitis B and\nhepatitis C or with iron overload because these factors are\nassociated with increased liver enzyme levels.\nFollow-up for mortality\nTo determine the vital status and cause of death, the National\nCenter for Health Statistics linked all participants aged 20 years\nTherefore, for each participant follow-up extended from the\ndate of the examination to the date of death or 31 December\nCause of death was determined from the underlying cause listed\non the death certificate.

Cox proportional hazards regression was used to\nestimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for deaths\nfrom all causes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and liver disease\nby hepatic steatosis status, with age as the timescale and\nstaggered entries into the study.32 We used two models with\nprogressive degrees of adjustment: model 1 adjusted for sex\nand race or ethnicity; model 2 further adjusted for education,\nsmoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, body mass\nindex, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, and diabetes.\nWe carried out extensive sensitivity analyses: firstly, using an\nalternative definition for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease that\nfurther excluded participants with hepatitis C, hepatitis B, or\niron overload; secondly, including in the no steatosis group\n(reference) participants with high alcohol consumption or using\nzydovudine or didanosine but without hepatic steatosis; thirdly,\nexcluding participants with a history of cardiovascular disease\nor with history of cancer from the analyses of cardiovascular\ndeath and cancer mortality; fourthly, excluding participants who\ndied within the first year of follow-up for cancer mortality; and\nfifthly, using alcohol consumption defined by UK safe limits\n(14 drinks a week for women and 21 for men). Sixthly, to assess\nthe potential of misclassification of exposure, we carried out\nanother sensitivity analysis comparing the group with no hepatic\nsteatosis (that is, excluding those with mild steatosis) against\nthose with severe hepatic steatosis (that is, excluding those with\nmoderate steatosis).\nFinally we evaluated the association of non-alcoholic fatty liver\ndisease and steatohepatitis with all cause mortality for subgroups\ndefined by sex, age, race or ethnicity, smoking status, body\nmass index categories, diabetes, and raised -glutamyltransferase\nlevels. All analyses were done using Stata 11 and using the svy\ncommands to account for the sampling weights and the complex\nsurvey design.\nResults\nAfter exclusions (fig 1), the analytical sample for the main\nThird National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, with\nassessment of hepatic steatosis. The overall prevalence of\nnon-alcoholic fatty liver disease (excluding steatohepatitis) and\nsteatohepatitis was 16.4% and 3.1%, respectively. Compared\nwith people without hepatic steatosis, participants with\nnon-alcoholic fatty liver disease were more likely to be older,\nmen, Mexican-American, less educated, sedentary, obese, to\nhave a high waist circumference, diabetes,\nhypercholesterolaemia, hypertension, and a history of\ncardiovascular disease, and less likely to be current smokers or\nto have low to moderate alcohol consumption (table 1). People\nwith non-alcoholic fatty liver disease also had higher levels of\nglycated haemoglobin, triglyceride:high density lipoprotein\ncholesterol ratio, insulin resistance, and liver enzymes (alanine\naminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and\n-glutamyltransferase). People with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis\nwere similar to those with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease,\nalthough slightly younger and with a slightly worse metabolic\nrisk profile (table 1).\nend of follow-up, the cumulative mortality from all causes was\nmortalities were 10.9% for cardiovascular disease (716 deaths),\ndeaths).\nThe risk of death from all causes in participants with\nnon-alcoholic fatty liver disease or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis\nat baseline was not increased compared with participants without\nhepatic steatosis (table 2).

Sensitivity analysis\nwith a different definition for high alcohol consumption\naccording to the UK safe limits produced almost identical results\n(see web extra table 3). Finally, when participants with severe\nsteatosis were compared with those without steatosis the fully\nadjusted hazard ratios for death from all causes were similar:\nweb extra table 4).\nDiscussion\nIn this nationally representative study in the United States, we\nfound no association between non-alcoholic fatty liver disease\nor non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and deaths from all causes,\ncardiovascular disease, cancer, or liver disease. These results\nare important given the high prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty\nliver disease in the general population and the concerns raised\nby the adverse metabolic profile associated with this disease\nand non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.\nComparison with other studies\nFew studies have assessed the clinical course of non-alcoholic\nfatty liver disease and its impact on mortality. Retrospective\nstudies of histology based non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and\nmortality have been inconsistent. One study reported an\nincreased risk of death from all causes (standardised mortality\nratio compared with general Danish population of 2.6) among\n1804 patients who had been admitted to the hospital and had a\ndischarge diagnosis of fatty liver; however, there was no\nadjustment for potential confounders.19 In contrast, two studies\nthat used biopsy registries to identify cases of fatty liver disease\nfound no evidence of an increased risk of death among patients\nwith non-alcoholic fatty liver disease compared with the general\npopulation of either the United Kingdom or Denmark.16 20 These\nauthors were not able to adjust for confounders either.

Over 13.7 years of follow-up,\npatients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease had similar\nsurvival to the general Swedish population (matched for age\nand sex), although the risk of death was increased in patients\nwith non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.18 Finally, a study15\nretrospectively identified 420 patients with non-alcoholic fatty\nliver disease and found a 34% increased risk of death in this\ngroup compared with the general Minnesota population over\n7.6 years of follow-up. The highly selected nature of the patient\npopulation in these studies, including the use of patients with\naccess to medical care who underwent liver biopsy as part of\ninvestigations, makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions about\nthe impact of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and non-alcoholic\nsteatohepatitis on mortality in the population as a whole.\nTo our knowledge only three studies have evaluated the\nassociation between non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and\nmortality in samples from the general population.21-23 These\nstudies used data from the Third National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey, but all used liver enzyme levels as\nsurrogate markers of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and\nfollow-up extended only to 2000. These three studies used\ndifferent definitions of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (all\nbased on liver enzyme levels) and most of them adjusted for\npotential confounders. One of these studies defined\nnon-alcoholic fatty liver disease as a raised alanine\naminotransferase level in the absence of high alcohol\nconsumption or increased transferrin saturation, hepatitis B, or\nhepatitis C and found no increased risk for all cause mortality.\nAnother study using a similar definition of non-alcoholic fatty\nliver disease further restricted the study to participants not taking\na large number of potentially hepatotoxic drugs and reported a\n37% increase in mortality for those with non-alcoholic fatty\nliver disease (P=0.07). Finally, another study found that people\nwith raised levels of alanine aminotransferase in the absence of\nhepatitis B or hepatitis C were not at increased risk of death\nfrom all causes (hazard ratio of 1.2) or cardiovascular disease\n(hazard ratio of 0.90). All of these studies found an increased\nrisk of liver related death for people with raised liver enzyme\nlevels.\nContrary to our hypotheses and to current belief14 and despite\na clear and strong association between non-alcoholic fatty liver\ndisease and diabetes, insulin resistance, and obesity, our study\ndid not find an association between non-alcoholic fatty liver\ndisease or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and deaths from all\ncauses, cardiovascular disease, cancer, or liver disease. Although\nother outcomes related to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease,\nincluding cirrhosis, cancer, and a more rapid progression of\ncoexistent liver diseases may be important, our findings support\nthe suggestion that people with accumulation of fat in the liver\nhave a good prognosis with respect to mortality. One speculation\nis that the ability of the liver to store triglycerides may in fact\nbe a protection mechanism in obesity.33 In the absence of such\na response, free fatty acids may accumulate and lead to more\nsevere liver damage and systemic consequences.34\nStrengths and limitations of the study\nUltrasonography is widely used to detect hepatic steatosis at\nthe population level and, as shown in a recent meta-analysis,\ncan accurately detect non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (pooled\nnon-alcoholic steatohepatitis in the absence of liver biopsy we\nused increases in the liver enzyme levels alanine\naminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase in the presence\nof steatosis to define non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Although\nwe ruled out other potential and common causes of raised liver\nenzyme levels, such as viral hepatitis, iron overload, and high\nalcohol consumption, we are aware that this definition has a\nlimited sensitivity and specificity,36 and thus our results for\nnon-alcoholic steatohepatitis should be interpreted with caution.\nFurther studies with large samples and more refined diagnostic\nmethods for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis are needed to\ndetermine the effect of steatohepatitis on mortality.\nWe had only a single measure of non-alcoholic fatty liver\ndisease, which could not capture changes in hepatic steatosis\nover time, resulting in non-differential misclassification. We\nused data on education, smoking, alcohol consumption, and\nphysical activity, but these data are generally collected based\non self report. We had a limited sample size to study cause\nspecific deaths associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.\nAlthough the follow-up was longer than in previous studies, it\nmay be too short to assess the effect of non-alcoholic fatty liver\ndisease on liver related mortality, given the time it takes for\nliver disease to progress. Finally, we were unable to study the\nassociation between non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and\nnon-fatal complications. In the future, larger multicollaborative\nstudies, such as the Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis-Clinical\nResearch Network37 should be encouraged to comprehensively\nand extensively study the association between non-alcoholic\nfatty liver disease, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, and other\nnon-fatal outcomes.\nOur study also has notable strengths. The Third National Health\nand Nutrition Examination Survey and the associated mortality\nfollow-up study represent the only nationally representative\nsample with results for liver imaging and long term mortality\n(up to 18 years). The participants are well characterised, with\nextensive laboratory and physical examination and\nmeasurements of hepatic steatosis. Finally, data were collected\nby trained staff following rigorous, standardised protocols to\nensure that measurement errors were minimised.\nConclusions and implications\nIn conclusion, we found no association between ultrasound\ndefined non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and deaths from all\ncauses, cardiovascular disease, cancer, or liver disease in the\nUS population. These results have important implications since\nnon-alcoholic fatty liver disease is the most common liver\ndisease in the population and is receiving considerable attention\nas an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease.14 Since\nstage of the disease is likely to be a critical determinant of the\noverall prognosis, our findings need to be confirmed with\nimproved non-invasive assessment tools and finer staging of\nnon-alcoholic fatty liver disease in the general population. None\nthe less, our results indicate that although non-alcoholic fatty\nliver disease is strongly associated with cardiovascular risk\nfactors, such patients are not at increased risk of death from all\ncauses or cardiovascular disease.\nWe thank Lisa Broitman and Mark S Eberhardt, at the National Center\nfor Health Statistics, Center for Disease Control, Hyattsville, Maryland,\nfor substantial administrative and logistical assistance with this project.\nContributors: ML, RH, IRK, FLB, and JMC conceived and designed the\nstudy.
