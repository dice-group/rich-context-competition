Discrepancies between\nreviewers in the selected articles were discussed, and a\nconsensus was reached on whether or not the article(s) in\nquestion would be incorporated. A total of 31 articles were\nidentified for inclusion at this stage. Third, the reference\nlists of these articles were scanned and literature searches\non major authors in the area were performed, a further five\npublications were included at this step.

In terms of clinically relevant differ-\nences, a 3% relative difference in energy intakes between\ngroups equates to a weight gain of 2\u00ad4 kg year-1 for an\naverage-sized adult (26), therefore differences of this mag-\nnitude are likely to have a marked long-term influence on\nBMI and overweight/obesity.

Twenty-three of these were con-\nducted among separate study samples, and five studies were\nsourced from two study populations. The vast majority of\nin-scope studies (n = 16) were conducted in the USA, with\nother studies taking place in Australia or New Zealand\n(n = 7) and Japan (n = 2). Three Australian studies were\nsourced from one sample (SESAW), and two American\nstudies were sourced from one sample (Stanford Heart\nDisease Prevention Program). Only three of the studies\nwere conducted in Europe \u00ad two of these were among\nBritish samples (16,36) and one among a Dutch sample\n(37). With the exception of one natural experiment (16), all\nstudies were cross-sectional. Study sample sizes ranged\npants. Response rates ranged from 10% to 87%, just under\none half of the studies had response rates of 60% and one\nquarter (n = 7) did not report response rates.\nMost studies (n = 13) examined fruit and vegetable con-\nsumption, two investigated energy intakes, six assessed fat\nintakes and three examined fibre intakes. Four of the\nin-scope studies examined takeaway or fast food consump-\ntion and three studies explored meal patterns (i.e. breakfast\nconsumption and/or the regularity of meals). No study\nexamined environmental factors in relation to the consump-\ntion of sugar-rich beverages. Eight studies assessed associa-\ntions between environmental factors and weight status.\nMost (n = 18) examined accessibility factors; social\nfactors and material factors were explored in three and\nseven studies, respectively. Only two studies looked at asso-\nciations between cultural factors and obesogenic dietary\nintakes. The majority of studies used food frequency ques-\ntionnaires to ascertain dietary intakes and measured height\nand weight to assess weight status. Most (n = 16) measured\nenvironmental factors using objective measures, nine\nstudies assessed environmental factors using self-reported\ninformation and the remaining three studies used a combi-\nnation of objective and self-reported data.\nAccessibility factors\nAssociations between accessibility factors and obesogenic\ndietary intakes or weight status are shown in Table 2.\nFor fruit and vegetable consumption, access to supermar-\nkets, grocery/convenience, takeaway and fruit and veg-\netable stores was examined in 14 associations. The number\nof associations measured was greatest and most consistent\nfor access to supermarkets; five out of six associations\nfound that greater accessibility to supermarkets was not\nassociated with fruit and vegetable consumption. Three\nout of four associations assessing access to takeaway\noutlets and fruit and vegetable consumption showed no\nsignificant/meaningful differences. Furthermore, there were\nno consistent associations between availability/shelf space\nof fruits and vegetables and their consumption.\nFive associations measured differences in weight status\nby access to supermarkets; four of these found that people\nwith greater access to supermarkets had lower BMI/\nprevalence of overweight/obesity compared with those with\nless access. These differences were small-to-moderate in\nmagnitude (i.e. differences of between 1\u00ad35%). The major-\nity of associations (five out of eight) examining access to\ntakeaway food outlets and weight status found that greater\naccess was associated with greater BMI/prevalence of\noverweight/obesity.

Giskes et al. obesity reviews\nof welfare. Only living in an urban area was associated\nwith higher takeaway consumption. Two associations that\nexamined area deprivation and meal patterns found that\nliving in a socioeconomically advantaged area was associ-\nated with more regular meal patterns.\nDiscussion\nWe conducted a systematic review of the literature exam-\nining environmental factors associated with obesogenic\ndietary intakes and overweight/obesity. Weight status was\nmost consistently associated with features of the environ-\nment; residents of areas with greater access to supermarkets\nor lower accessibility to takeaway outlets had a lower\nprevalence of overweight/obesity compared with those\nliving in areas with limited supermarket access or a greater\naccessibility to takeaway outlets. Paradoxically however,\nthe findings of studies examining environmental factors in\nrelation to obesogenic dietary behaviours were less consis-\ntent, with mixed associations reported. The only exception\nto this was area-level deprivation, with residents of socio-\neconomically deprived areas having a greater likelihood\nof obesogenic dietary intakes than their counterparts in\nadvantaged areas.\nThe current review updated two systematic reviews con-\nducted in 2004 that examined environmental correlates\nof energy, fat, fruit and vegetable intakes (20,21). These\nprevious reviews found that most studies focussed on\nwork conditions and seasonal/day-of-the-week variations\nin dietary intakes. However, the current review found an\nincreasing amount of research that examined accessibility\nfactors (i.e. locations of supermarkets, takeaway food\nstores, availability of healthy food choices within stores)\nand area-level socioeconomic deprivation than reported in\nprevious reviews. Furthermore, we found a greater number\nof studies that examined these environmental factors in\nrelation to the distal outcome, weight status, rather than\nthe more `intermediate' outcome of dietary intakes.\nGreater access to takeaway outlets may increase the ease\nat which people make food choices less consistent with\ndietary recommendations by minimizing barriers to making\nthese choices (15,38). A limited access to supermarkets\nmay result in reliance on convenience stores or takeaway\noutlets; these stores tend to sell foods less consistent with\ndeprived area may influence dietary behaviours by limiting\naccess to supermarkets (through lower servicing of these\nareas by supermarkets or lower access to transport) and\nincreasing access to corner/convenience stores (40). This\nlater association is predominantly seen in the USA,\nhowever, is not consistently observed in other countries\n(41). Despite an increase in research examining accessibility\nfactors, relatively few studies have examined other environ-\nmental factors implicated in the obesity epidemic, such as:\nportion sizes and the marketing of energy-dense foods\nWe found more consistent evidence of associations\nbetween environmental factors and weight status than\nstudies examining associations between environmental\nfactors and dietary intakes. If the environment is hypoth-\nesized to influence weight status, we would expect to find\nan association between environmental factors and diet, and\nbetween environmental factors and weight status. A poten-\ntial explanation of this finding is that environmental factors\nmay influence BMI through a more complex interplay of\nfactors, including physical activity, which has not been well\nTable 5 Summary of study findings examining associations between material factors, dietary behaviours and weight status*\nAuthor (date) Energy Fat Fibre Fruit/vegetables Weight status Other\nArea deprivation characteristics (advantaged vs. deprived)\nbreakfast\nUrban/rural residence (urban vs rural)\nShift work (yes vs no)\n*Differences reported are relative to the reference group (i.e. `+' refers to higher intakes relative to the reference group, `-' refers to lower intakes\nrelative to the reference group and `=' refers to no differences).

Giskes et al. e103\nexplored in other studies. However, this is difficult to ascer-\ntain as no known studies have assessed features of the\nenvironment, dietary intakes, physical activity and weight\nstatus simultaneously. This may also be due (in part) to the\ncomplexity in measuring dietary intakes and physical activ-\nity; calculating these requires accurate recall and descrip-\ntion of dietary intakes and physical activity (42). This is\nparticularly difficult to achieve in studies of population-\nrepresentative samples, where the self-administered data\ncollection methods frequently used generally involve a high\ndegree of participant burden (42). Furthermore, obesogenic\nfood and physical activity environments may co-exist,\nmaking it difficult to attribute which feature of the envi-\nronment contributes to the development of overweight and\nobesity. This is an area that requires increased research\nactivity to disentangle the pathways that contribute to the\nspatial patterning in weight status in urban areas that has\nbeen documented in a number of studies from North\nThe majority of studies included in the current review\nwere conducted in the USA, UK or Australia/New Zealand.\nIt is therefore unclear whether findings from this review can\nbe generalized to other regions. Previous research has\nshown that the USA represents an anomaly with respect to\nthe geographic size of urban areas and the residential seg-\nregation of socioeconomic and ethnic groups compared\nwith other developed countries (41,46). This has raised the\nissue of whether the associations seen between environmen-\ntal factors and dietary behaviours in the USA are relevant\nto other developed countries, especially in the European\nThis study considered a number of dietary outcomes;\nhowever, the findings showed that associations between\nobesogenic dietary behaviours and environmental factors\nhave been studied most frequently for fruit and vegetable\nintakes. This may be because fruit and vegetable consump-\ntion is positively associated with other healthy dietary\nintakes and behaviours, such as intakes that are less energy\ndense, lower in fat, higher in fibre and less frequent con-\nsumption of fast food (20,47). However, it is likely that\nenvironmental factors are associated with each nutrient,\nfood group or dietary intake pattern differentially (18,20).\nFor example, accessibility to fruit and vegetable shops may\ninfluence fruit, vegetable and fibre consumptions; however,\nit is less plausible that accessibility to fruit and vegetable\nshops may influence the consumption of sugar-rich bever-\nages or meal patterns. Therefore, it is important for future\nresearch to investigate environmental influences on all\ndietary factors that may contribute to obesogenic dietary\nintakes.\nSeveral limitations of our review must be considered in\nlight of our findings. Our search strategy only located\nstudies that were published in peer-reviewed journals and\nreferenced in electronic databases, excluding `grey' litera-\nture. We tried to minimize any potential bias that may be\ninduced from only examining peer-reviewed literature by\nalso performing searches in smaller and more specialized\ndatabases (e.g. CSA Illumina). There was also great varia-\ntion between studies included in the current review in terms\nof the conceptualization, measurement and summary of\nboth the environmental factors and dietary behaviours\nwhich may have contributed to heterogeneous findings.\nFurthermore, although strict inclusion criteria were used,\nenvironmental or dietary intake measures sometimes dif-\nfered markedly between studies. Little is known about\nappropriate confounders to adjust for when examining\nassociations between environmental factors and dietary\nintakes/weight status (20). Some studies may have `over-\ncorrected' for such factors, which may diminish the mag-\nnitude or significance of associations with environmental\nfactors. Whereas other studies that did not correct for\nappropriate individual-level confounders and therefore\nmay over-estimate the strength or significance of these asso-\nciations. Furthermore, most of the studies included in this\nreview were cross-sectional, making it difficult to ascertain\ncausality between environmental factors and obesogenic\ndietary intakes.\nThe current review suggested that accessibility to\nsupermarkets/takeaway outlets or residing in a socioeco-\nnomically deprived area are environmental factors that\nmay contribute to overweight or obesity and/or obesogenic\ndietary behaviours. These factors need to be targeted in\nmultilevel health promotion interventions and policies\naimed at decreasing overweight/obesity. The role of other\nenvironmental factors, however, should not be discarded\nwithout further investigation, namely those whose associa-\ntions with dietary behaviours/weight status were not exam-\nined or are not possible to infer from the limited number of\nstudies. Despite the limitations in the evidence base to date,\nwe should not refrain from policies and interventions\npromoting healthy environments because waiting for such\nevidence to emerge before action is taken may simply rep-\nresent a delay to addressing the obesity epidemic. To under-\nstand the role of environmental factors, studies are required\nthat simultaneously examine a broad range of environmen-\ntal factors, obesogenic dietary behaviours and physical\nactivity and that utilize prospective study designs.\nConflict of Interest Statement\nNo conflict of interest was declared.\nReferences\n1.

Literature searches of databases (i.e. PubMed, CSA\nIllumina, Web of Science, PsychInfo) identified studies examining environmental\nfactors and the consumption of energy, fat, fibre, fruit, vegetables, sugar-\nsweetened drinks, meal patterns and weight status. Twenty-eight studies were\nin-scope, the majority (n = 16) were conducted in the USA. Weight status was\nconsistently associated with the food environment; greater accessibility to super-\nmarkets or less access to takeaway outlets were associated with a lower BMI or\nprevalence of overweight/obesity. However, obesogenic dietary behaviours did not\nmirror these associations; mixed associations were found between the environ-\nment and obesogenic dietary behaviours. Living in a socioeconomically-deprived\narea was the only environmental factor consistently associated with a number of\nobesogenic dietary behaviours. Associations between the environment and weight\nstatus are more consistent than that seen between the environment and dietary\nbehaviours. The environment may play an important role in the development of\noverweight/obesity, however the dietary mechanisms that contribute to this\nremain unclear and the physical activity environment may also play an important\nrole in weight gain, overweight and obesity.\nKeywords: Diet, environment, obesity, weight status.\nIntroduction\nObesity is a major cause of morbidity and mortality from\nchronic diseases such as cardiovascular and musculoskel-\netal diseases, some cancers and negative psychological well-\nbeing (1,2). The prevalence of overweight and obesity is\nhigh and ranges from 40% to 60% among adults in devel-\noped countries (2,3). In the last two decades there have\nbeen marked increases in the prevalence of overweight and\nobesity (4). Overweight and obesity results in substantial\nhealth and economic burdens, and these negative conse-\nquences are predicted to escalate as the population ages\nOverweight and obesity are the result of positive energy\nbalance. Low levels of physical activity and/or dietary\nbehaviours that deviate from recommendations are thought\nto contribute to the epidemic of obesity. In terms of dietary\nfactors, population trends in overweight and obesity would\nsuggest that energy intake exceeds energy expenditure (7).\nHigh energy intakes have been associated with higher fat\nintakes, greater intakes of energy-dense foods, including\ntakeaway foods, higher intakes of foods providing `empty\ncalories' (e.g. sugar-sweetened drinks), lower intakes of\nfoods and nutrients that may have appetite-controlling\nproperties (i.e. fruit and vegetables, fibre) and meal patterns\nthat interfere with the regulation of energy intakes (e.g.\nskipping breakfast) (7). Despite the health-related benefits\nof consuming a diet that promotes a healthy weight, many\nadults do not consume a diet consistent with these recom-\nmendations. Population-level dietary estimates show that\nfat intakes exceed recommendations by at least 10%, the\nmajority of the population do not consume sufficient fruit,\nvegetables or fibre and a significant proportion of the popu-\nGiven the rapid rise in overweight and obesity among\npopulations of developed countries, many health practitio-\nners and health researchers have postulated that the envi-\nronment, rather than individual-level factors, may be\ndriving the obesity epidemic. Policymakers are increasingly\nconsidering environments for the development of policy,\nhowever, have been limited by insufficient research docu-\nmenting the role of the environment. Recent studies have\nshown that overweight and obesity cluster within areas,\nsuggesting that shared environments may contribute to a\npositive energy balance (12\u00ad14). The postulated relation-\nships between the environment and weight status is shown\nin Fig. 1. The current review primarily focuses on environ-\nmental factors that may influence dietary behaviours. `Obe-\nsogenic' food environments are thought to facilitate high\nenergy intakes by increasing access to stores that promote\nunhealthy food choices, such as takeaway and fast food\nshops, convenience stores and other outlets that are less\nlikely to sell healthy food choices (15\u00ad17). Areas charac-\nterized by obesogenic food environments may also be asso-\nciated with physical activity environments that promote\ndecreased energy expenditure and sedentariness. The pre-\nsumed importance of these environmental factors has\nresulted in a myriad of policies and interventions aimed at\nimproving food environments (4,18,19). Despite wide-\nspread support for these policies and interventions, the\ndiscourse about their supposed importance has largely been\ndiscussed in position papers and narrative reviews, without\nsynthesis of the evidence on how food environments\nare associated with overweight and obesity and the\nmechanisms by which environmental factors contribute to\noverweight/obesity.\nTwo systematic reviews examining environmental corre-\nlates of obesogenic dietary intakes were conducted in 2004\n(20,21). At this stage, there were few replicated studies that\nexamined associations between obesogenic dietary intakes\nand the food environment. Given the increased research\nactivity on environmental determinants of health-related\nbehaviours in recent years, we sought to review the more\nrecent literature on how features of the food environment\nare associated with both dietary intakes and overweight/\nobesity to identify factors to be targeted in policy and\ninterventions to reduce overweight/obesity and to ascertain\nhow shared environments may contribute to the obesity\nepidemic.\nMethod\nStudy scope\nThis review focused on studies of dietary intakes among\nadults (i.e. 18 years). The prevalence of overweight and\nobesity is greatest in adulthood (especially middle-age),\nand significant weight gains continue to occur in early and\nmiddle adulthood (6). The review examined studies con-\nducted among developed countries, as defined by the World\nEnvironmental factors\nFor the purposes of this study, the environment was defined\nas physical and infrastructural features of areas.

The framework shares common\nfeatures with ecological models (24,25), stressing the\nimportance of multiple types of environmental influences.\nThe four categories that form this framework are:\n1. Accessibility and availability. Including physical and\nfinancial accessibility of products and shops that are needed\nfor an (un)healthy diet (e.g. access to shops, and availability\nof high fat foods and less healthy snacks);\n2.

Giskes et al. obesity reviews\n3. Material conditions. Including unfavourable\nworking, housing and neighbourhood conditions (e.g.\nneighbourhood deprivation).\nThese may affect behaviour through one of the previous\nenvironmental factors. For instance, living or working in an\nunfavourable environment might induce stress, which may\nrelate to indifference concerning a healthy diet.\nObesogenic dietary factors\nDietary factors influence overweight/obesity through the\nenergy balance pathway; excess energy intake is arguably\nthe most important dietary factor in relation to weight gain\nand the development of overweight/obesity (26). As there\nare physiological limitations on the quantity of food/drink\nthat can be consumed by individuals, excess energy intakes\nare often the consequence of energy-dense diets (i.e. high in\nkilojoules per unit weight) (7). Population-based studies\nhave shown that energy-dense diets are characterized by:\nhigh intakes of fat and sugar, and low intakes of water-\nholding factors, such as fibre, fruit and vegetables, high\nintakes of sugar-sweetened beverages (e.g. soft drinks) and\nirregular meal patterns (27\u00ad30). These factors are sus-\npected to contribute to overriding the normal physiological\nregulation of appetite and food intakes, and are associated\nTherefore, the dietary factors examined in this review\nincluded intakes of energy, total fat, fibre, fruit, vegetables,\nsugar-sweetened beverages and meal patterns.\nWeight status\nAny measure of weight status, including absolute weight\nor any equivilized weight scale such as body mass index\n(BMI), weight for height or categorization of weight status\ninto groups was included in the current study.\nSearch strategy\nDatabases and search terms\nA review protocol based on guidelines from the Cochrane\nReviewer's Handbook (33) was used. Studies conducted\nOctober 2008 were located by searches of several major\ndatabases (i.e. PubMed, CSA Illumina, Web of Science and\nPsychInfo).\nBroad search terms were used in the database searches\nto ensure that all potentially relevant articles entered\nthe screening process. Each database was searched using\ndatabase-specific indexing terms; suitable search terms\nwere selected from lists of the database indexing system.\nFor databases that did not have their own indexing terms\n(i.e. CSA Illumina) we searched for keywords in titles. The\nsensitivity of searches was tested by examining whether\nthey located several key articles. The searches yielded 6014\nsearch terms and syntax used for each database are avail-\nable from the authors on request.\nInclusion criteria\nThis review only included studies published in the peer-\nreviewed literature. Therefore, information from web sites,\nreports and conference abstracts were not included. Studies\nmust have been published in English and conducted among\na population-based sample (i.e. studies examining disease\nor patient sub-groups were excluded) of adults (i.e. 18\nyears of age). They must have examined at least one of the\nin-scope dietary factors, which could be summarized either\nas quantity consumed (e.g. grams of fruit consumed per\nday), frequency of consumption (e.g. how many times fruit\nwas consumed per week) or compliance with recommen-\ndations (e.g. whether consumed two or more portions of\nfruit per day) or weight status. In-scope studies were\nrequired to have assessed at least one environmental factor.\nStudies that combined in-scope dietary factors with out-of-\nscope factors into summary indices of diet (e.g. dietary\noutcomes derived from factor analyses) were excluded as\nassociations with the obesogenic dietary factors could not\nbe distinguished from other dietary factors.\nTitle scanning\nThe title screening process was performed by two reviewers\n(KG and FvL), and took place in three steps. First, the titles\nlocated from the search results were scanned, to exclude\nthose out of the scope of the current study. Fifty-five studies\nwere selected at this stage. Subsequently, the"
