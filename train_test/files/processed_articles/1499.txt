Red cell distribution width (RDW) is a quantitative measure of variability in the size of circulating\nerythrocytes with higher values reflecting greater heterogeneity in cell sizes. Recent studies have shown that higher RDW\nis associated with increased mortality risk in patients with clinically significant cardiovascular disease (CVD). Whether\nRDW is prognostic in more representative community-based populations is unclear.\nMethods. Seven relevant community-based studies of older adults with RDW measurement and mortality ascertain-\nment were identified. Cox proportional hazards regression and meta-analysis on individual participant data were\nperformed.\nof 11,827 older adults with RDW measured, there was a graded increased risk of death associated with higher RDW\nvalues (p < .001). For every 1% increment in RDW, total mortality risk increased by 14% (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]:\n1.13; 95% CI: 1.07\u00ad1.18). Furthermore, the RDW\u00admortality association occurred in all major demographic, disease, and\nnutritional risk factor subgroups examined.

Whether RDW is prognostic in more rep-\nresentative community-based populations requires further\ninvestigation. The aim of the current study was to quantify\nthe association of RDW with total and cause-specific mor-\ntality in seven population-based studies of older adults with\nvaried health and demographic compositions. Specifically,\nwe characterized the dose\u00adresponse relationship and as-\nsessed its consistency across the studies as well as in major\nsubgroups of older adults.\nMethods\nStudy Populations and Design\nIndividual participant data of older adults were analyzed\nfrom six cohort studies developed in collaboration with the\nLaboratory of Epidemiology, Demography, and Biometry,\nNational Institute on Aging/National Institutes of Health. In\naddition, publicly available data on older adults who par-\nticipated in the Third National Health and Nutrition Exami-\nnation Survey (NHANES III) were also analyzed. Table 1\nprovides a description of the studies included in the meta-\nanalysis. (A search of the MEDLINE and EMBASE data-\nwidth or RDW and mortality as search terms did not iden-\ntify additional community-based studies for inclusion in\nthis analysis.) In all seven studies, RDW was measured as\npart of the automated CBC and participants were subse-\nquently followed for mortality. Although each study cohort\nwas composed of community-dwelling older adults, the\ngoals of the studies varied and therefore the sampling pro-\ncedures and target populations differed accordingly. The\nWomen's Health andAging Study I (WHAS I), for instance,\nsampled moderately to severely disabled women aged 65\nyears and older, whereas the Health, Aging, and Body Com-\nposition Study (HealthABC Study) recruited well-function-\ning men and women aged 70\u00ad79 years from a Medicare\nsample within selected zip codes. The InCHIANTI (\"Invec-\nchiare in Chianti,\" aging in Chianti area) Study, NHANES\nIII, and the New Haven site of the Established Populations\nfor the Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly (EPESE) used\nprobabilistic methods to sample men and women aged 65\nyears and older regardless of functional status, whereas the\nEast Boston and Iowa EPESE sites recruited all older per-\nsons in their geographical areas. CBCs were collected at the\nbaseline visit in the InCHIANTI Study, NHANES III, and\nWHAS I; 2 years after baseline in the Health ABC Study;\nand 6 years after baseline in the East Boston, Iowa, and New\nHaven sites of the EPESE.\nAdjustment Variables\nA standard set of variables that might confound the as-\nsociation of RDW with mortality was available in each\nstudy. This included information on demographic and health\nbehavior\u00adrelated factors (age, sex, race, education level,\nTable 1.

Self-reported data on race\nwere included because of known differences in the distribu-\ntion of some CBC parameters by race, including RDW (5),\nand the differential effect of hemoglobin concentration on\nmortality by race (8). Laboratory measures included serum\ncreatinine, serum albumin, hemoglobin concentration, and\nmean corpuscular volume (MCV). The four-variable abbre-\nviated Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study formula\nwas used to calculate estimated glomerular filtration rate\n(eGFR) (9). For subgroup analysis, chronic kidney disease\nmia was defined as hemoglobin concentration less than 13\nand less than 12 g/dL in men and women, respectively. In\naddition, deficiencies in iron, folate, and vitamin B12 were\ndetermined in the InCHIANTI Study, NHANES III, and\nWHAS I using previously established criteria (10\u00ad13).\nStatistical Analysis\nDescriptive statistics were used to examine the baseline\ncharacteristics of each study sample (Table 2). To assess the\nshape of the RDW-to-mortality relationship, hazard ratios\n(HRs) for RDW divided into nine categories were obtained\nwith data combined from all studies using a Cox propor-\ntional hazards model that adjusted for age, sex, and study\n(Figure 1). The proportional hazards assumption was con-\nfirmed by examining plots of Schoenfeld residuals. Test of\ntrend was performed by entering RDW as an ordinal vari-\nable. HRs for RDW as a continuous variable were then\nobtained from each study separately using Cox models ad-\njusted for age, sex, education, race, smoking status, BMI,\neGFR, hemoglobin concentration, MCV, serum albumin,\nand medical conditions (cancer, diabetes, heart attack, hy-\npertension, and stroke). (A Cox model fitted with a penal-\nized spline for RDW as a continuous variable confirmed a\nlinear association with mortality.) As per established meta-\nanalysis methods (14,15), a random-effects model was then\nused to pool these HRs and determine the overall effect of\nRDW on total mortality and assess the consistency of effect\nacross studies (Figure 2). These analyses were repeated to\nseparately examine cause-specific mortality outcomes, in-\ncluding CVD, cancer, and other deaths (Figure 3). Finally,\nCox models were estimated with the pooled data to de-\ntermine whether RDW predicted mortality in various\nsubgroups adjusting for age, sex, and study (Figure 4). Sta-\ntistical interactions were tested to determine whether the\neffect of RDW on mortality varied by subgroups. Analyses\nwere completed using Stata/SE version 10.1 (StataCorp,\nTable 2.

The meta-analyses\nalso showed that RDW was significantly associated with\neach of the three cause-specific outcomes examined (Figure 3),\nalthough the association with CVD mortality was slightly\nstronger than with cancer and other causes of mortality.\nIn addition, RDW significantly predicted total mortality\nin all the major subgroups shown in Figure 4, adjusting for\nage, sex, and study.

The effect of RDW was weaker in blacks than in\nwhites (p for RDW by race interaction = .011), but again,\nhigher RDW was significantly associated with increased\nmortality for both racial groups. There was no significant\nvariation in the effect of RDW on mortality across sub-\ngroups defined according to smoking status, BMI category,\nand individual diseases, although the association was sig-\nnificantly weaker in anemic than in nonanemic older adults\nFigure 4.Hazard ratios for total mortality per 1% increment in red cell distribution width (RDW) in subgroups of older adults, adjusted for age, sex, and study.\nPatel et al.\n(p for RDW by anemia interaction <.001). Notably, RDW\nwas significantly associated with mortality in the subgroups\nshown in Figure 4 even after further adjusting for covari-\nates used in Figures 2 and 3 (results not shown). Further-\nmore, among the subset of 1,603 older adults without any\nof the major age-associated medical conditions (anemia,\ncancer, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, heart attack, hy-\npertension, and stroke), RDW remained a strong predictor\nof mortality adjusting for age, sex, race, education, smok-\ning status, BMI, eGFR, hemoglobin concentration, MCV,\nand serum albumin (adjusted HR for 1% increment in\nNutritional deficiencies were determined in the InCHI-\nANTI Study, NHANES III, and WHAS I. The association\nof RDW with mortality occurred in participants with iron,\nfolate, and/or vitamin B12 deficiencies (adjusted HR for 1%\nthose without these deficiencies (adjusted HR for 1% incre-\nsex, and study (data not shown). There was no statistical\ninteraction between RDW and nutritional status in predict-\ning mortality (p = .283). The results remained essentially\nunchanged when additionally adjusting for covariates used\nDiscussion\nIn this collaborative analysis of 11,827 community-\ndwelling older adults in seven cohort studies, RDW was\na remarkably consistent and strong predictor of total and\ncause-specific mortality. There was a clear gradient in\nmortality risk associated with increasing RDW values.\nFor every 1% increment in RDW, the risk of death in-\ncreased by 14%. This association was independent of\nseveral established risk factors for death in older adults,\nincluding hemoglobin concentration. Furthermore, the\nassociation occurred in all the major demographic, dis-\nease, and behavioral and nutritional risk factor subgroups\nexamined as well as in older adults without major\nage-associated medical conditions. Considering that the\ndistribution of RDW varied between cohorts and yet sig-\nnificantly predicted mortality in each of them indicates\nthat greater variability in RBC volume is a risk factor for\ndeath in older adults.\nThe mechanisms through which RDW increases with age\nand is associated with mortality have not been defined;\nhowever, it is possible that oxidative stress and inflamma-\ntion play a role given that both can reduce RBC survival\n(16,17), leading to a more mixed population of RBC vol-\numes in the circulation. In patients with conditions charac-\nterized by increased levels of oxidative stress, such as Down\nsyndrome (18), poor pulmonary function (19), and dialysis\n(20), RDW values are elevated. Analyses of the NHANES\nIII data showed that decreased serum antioxidant levels, in-\ncluding carotenoids, selenium, and vitamin E, were also as-\nsociated with increased RDW, although adjusting for these\nantioxidants did not meaningfully attenuate the RDW-to-\nmortality association (5). In addition to reduced RBC sur-\nvival, inflammation might further influence RDW levels by\ndisrupting erythropoiesis. Indeed, it is believed that the in-\ncreased prevalence of anemia with advancing age is due, in\npart, to the effects of proinflammatory cytokines on inhibit-\ning the proliferation of erythroid progenitor cells and down-\nPerturbations in erythropoiesis can lead to more variation in\ncell sizes exiting the bone marrow and might increase RDW.\nImportantly, however, RDW was more strongly associated\nwith mortality in nonanemic than in anemic older adults\n(Figure 4). In the NHANES III, adjustment for C-reactive\nprotein, fibrinogen level, and white blood cell count did not\nsubstantially alter the effect of RDW on mortality, even\nthough each of these factors was strongly related to RDW\nand mortality (5).\nInterestingly, the association of RDW with mortality was\nsignificantly stronger in healthier older adults without major\nage-associated diseases than in those with disease (p for inter-\naction <.001). It is conceivable that there are subclinical dis-\nease processes that cause subtle dysregulation of erythrocyte\nhomeostasis that is expressed in RDW. Given that RDW was\nsignificantly associated with CVD mortality and cancer mor-\ntality, it might be that RDW predicts the occurrence of these\ndiseases as well as other age-associated conditions. Further re-\nsearch is needed to understand the pathways through which\nRDW is associated with mortality.\nPrevious studies on RDW were mainly performed in co-\nhorts or randomized trials of patients with significant CVD\n(1\u00ad4,7). Although these studies showed that RDW was\nstrongly related to CVD events as well as all-cause mortality,\ndata from the NHANES III showed that RDW significantly\npredicted deaths from CVD, cancer, chronic lower respira-\ntory tract disease, and other causes except external ones (e.g.,\ntraffic accidents) (5,6). As RDW is associated with multiple\ncauses of death, it is plausible that RDW is influenced by\nmultiple diseases and is an integrative biomarker of dysfunc-\ntion and impairment across physiological systems.\nThe clinical utility of RDW beyond its current use in the\ndiagnosis of certain anemias needs to be evaluated. A few\nstudies have shown that RDW might be a useful screening\nmarker for celiac disease, colon cancer, and acute coronary\nsyndromes in emergency department settings (23\u00ad25). In\nterms of mortality risk prediction, RDW significantly\nimproved model performance in the NHANES III cohort\nbeyond established risk factors for adults aged 45\u00ad64 years\nand 65 years and older (5). However, whether RDW im-\nproves risk stratification for individual conditions, such as\nmyocardial infarction or congestive heart failure, is un-\nknown and should be investigated.\nThe current study does have some limitations that should\nbe considered. First, RDW was assessed in several different\nlaboratories. Although almost all modern automated blood\ncell counters report RDW as the coefficient of variation of\nred cell volume, algorithms used to eliminate artifacts and\noutliers vary to some extent between manufacturers, and\nrecommendations for standardization of cell sizing have not\nbeen uniformly adopted (26\u00ad28). Nonetheless, there was no\nevidence of heterogeneity among studies in the association\nof RDW with mortality. Second, RDW was assessed on a\nsingle occasion that might be influenced by biologic vari-\nability or measurement error, although such errors are likely\nto attenuate the observed associations between RDW and\nmortality. Third, despite adjusting for multiple risk factors\nand prevalent diseases, it is possible that there may be re-\nsidual confounding from conditions and medications not\nincluded in the analysis.\nIn summary, RDW is a newly recognized and powerful\npredictor of mortality in community-dwelling older adults\nwith and without major age-associated diseases. The bio-\nlogic mechanisms underlying this association merit investi-\ngation. Considering that RDW is an inexpensive test that is\nroutinely reported to physicians, further research is needed\nto determine whether RDW is a useful risk assessment tool\nin different clinical settings.\nFunding\nThis research was supported in part by the Intramural Research Program\nof the National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health, and by\nthe following grants and contracts from the National Institute on Aging:\nCorrespondence\nAddress correspondence to Kushang V.
