NHANES\nIntroduction\nThe prevalence of obesity in the United States is reaching\nepidemic proportions with one-third of the population being\nobese (BMI>30 kg/m2) and two-thirds being overweight.1\nHealth conditions associated with excess weight include\nincreased risk for type II diabetes, hypertension, dyslipide-\nmia, metabolic syndrome, atherosclerosis, degenerative\njoint disorders, obstructive sleep apnea, and certain can-\ncers.2\u00ad8 Obesity is also associated with cardiovascular\ndisease which is the leading cause of mortality in the\nUnited States.9 While the mechanistic relationship between\nobesity and the development of obesity-related conditions\nare not clearly understood, there is growing evidence to\nsupport the role of inflammation as a possible link.10\u00ad13\nC-reactive protein (CRP) and fibrinogen are biomarkers\nrepresenting increased risk for cardiovascular morbidity and\nmortality.14,15 CRP, the most extensively studied inflam-\nPresented at the 49th annual meeting of the Society for Surgery of the\nX.-M.

Nguyen (*)\nDivision of Gastrointestinal Surgery,\nUniversity of California, Irvine Medical Center,\ne-mail: Ninhn@uci.edu\nmatory biomarker, is a protein produced by hepatocytes in\nthe presence of inflammation due to factors such as\ninfection, injury, or conditions such as obesity.16 Elevated\nlevels of CRP have been associated with increased\ninflammation in the coronary arteries, and thus a marker\nfor increased risk for atherosclerosis and cardiovascular\ndisease.17,18 A meta-analysis of seven studies comparing\nindividuals within the top third with those within the\nbottom third at study baseline showed that higher CRP\nlevels were associated with a risk ratio of 1.7 (95% CI 1.4\u00ad\n2.1) for coronary heart disease (CHD).19 Additionally,\nshown that levels of CRP are elevated in individuals with\nhigh BMI.20,21 Another inflammatory biomarker that plays\na direct role in coronary artery thrombosis is fibrinogen.22\nFibrinogen, a major coagulation protein and the precursor\nto fibrin, is a major determinant of platelet aggregation and\nplasma viscosity.23,24 To our knowledge, no studies to date\nhave examined the relationship between fibrinogen levels\nand body weight, but a meta-analysis of 18 studies\nexamining the association between fibrinogen and CHD\nfound that individuals with fibrinogen values within the top\nthird compared to individuals within the bottom third of the\nstudy distribution had a high risk ratio of 1.8 (95% CI 1.6\u00ad\n2.0) for development of CHD.18 Since the relationship\nbetween obesity and cardiovascular disease, as well as the\nrelationship between inflammation and cardiovascular\ndisease, had been established, this study aimed to examine\nthe association between obesity class and levels of\ninflammatory biomarkers (CRP and fibrinogen) utilizing\nmore recent data from the National Health and Nutrition\nsized that there is a direct relationship between the levels of\ninflammatory biomarkers with increasing degree of obesity\nand there is an interaction between level of biomarkers and\ndiabetes and hypertension.\nSubjects and Methods\nStudy Population\nThe NHANES is conducted by the National Center for\nHealth Statistics which is part of the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention. The NHANES provides cross-\nsectional health and nutrition data for the US population.\nThe survey examines a nationally representative complex,\nmultistage probability sample of about 5,000 US civilians\neach year, located within 15 counties across the country.\nThe NHANES survey consists of an extensive health\ninformation interview, a complete physical examination,\nand extensive laboratory testing. The physical examinations\nwere performed in a mobile examination center and all\nsubjects signed a consent form approved by the Human\nSubjects Committee in the US Department of Health and\nHuman Services.25\u00ad27 The three latest, continuous\nAdditional information from each participant was collected\nduring an in-home interview and subsequent medical evalu-\nation at a mobile examination center. During the in-home\ninterview, information on age (limited to participants\n20 years), sex, race/ethnicity, smoking history, alcohol\nconsumption, history of diabetes mellitus, history of arthritis,\nand medication usage was obtained. Participants currently\nsmoking a cigarette, pipe and/or cigar were classified as\nsmokers while alcohol consumption was defined as having at\nleast one drink per week in the past 12 months. The\nprevalence of arthritis was self-reported and defined as ever\nbeing told by a doctor or health professional. At the mobile\nexamination center, blood pressure measurements were taken\nby trained interviewers and physicians using standardized\nmeasurement protocols recommended by the American Heart\nAssociation.28 Height, weight, and lipid profile measure-\nments were determined using standard protocols. More\ndetails are provided in the NHANES Laboratory/Medical\nTechnologists Procedures Manual.29\nParticipants were considered to have hypertension if\ntheir mean systolic blood pressure, measured at the mobile\nexamination center, was greater than 140 mmHg or mean\ndiastolic blood pressure was greater than 90 mmHg, if they\nwere told by their doctor that they have high blood pressure\nor hypertension, or if they were taking antihypertensive\nmedications. Diabetes mellitus was self-reported and\ndefined to include subjects who were told by their doctor\nthey have diabetes and subjects who stated that they were\ncurrently using antidiabetic medication(s) such as insulin or\noral hypoglycemic agents.\nDefinition of Obesity\nBody mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight in\nkilograms divided by the square of height in meters. The\nNational Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's definition for\noverweight and obesity were used to categorize the degree\nof obesity. A BMI <18.5 was categorized as underweight; a\ncategorized as obesity class 1; a BMI between 35.0 and\nwas categorized as obesity class 3. In this study, we did not\ndifferentiate between normal weight and underweight class.\nBiomarkers\nCRP concentrations were available for participants aged\n3 years and older and fibrinogen concentrations were taken\nfor individuals aged 40 years and older. Using blood samples\ncollected from participants, CRP concentrations were deter-\nmined using latex-enhanced nephelometry. Plasma fibrinogen\nlevels were quantified using the Clauss clotting method and\nthe levels of CRP and fibrinogen across the classes of obesity.\nStatistical Analysis\nAll statistical analyses were conducted in SAS 9.1 (SAS\nInstitute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Due to the NHANES'\ncomplex probability sampling of the US population, sample\nweights, stratification, and clustering of the sampling design\nwere incorporated into all SAS survey procedures to ensure\nthe correct estimation of standard errors, confidence intervals\nand p values. A 6-year sample weight was used for CRP\nanalyses and a 4-year weight was used for the fibrinogen\nanalysis. Two different sample weights were needed because\nwhile fibrinogen was only measured between 1999 and\n2002. These specific sample weights were created according\nto the National Center for Health Statistics guidelines to\naccount for oversampling of certain age, sex, race/ethnicity\ndomains and differential non-response or undercoverage.31\nThe initial study sample included 29,402 individuals with\nonly 24,157 participants having CRP measurements. Since\nthis study was limited to adult age 20 years or older, a total of\n10,796 persons were excluded from the CRP analysis,\nyielding a total of 13,361 individuals for the final CRP\nanalyses. Fibrinogen data was only publicly available for a\nsubset of participants aged 40 years or older in the NHANES\nfibrinogen levels. We limited our study sample to those age\n20 years or older because only individuals with complete data\nfor additional variables adjusted for in our analyses (i.e.,\nsmoking) were considered.\nUnadjusted and adjusted linear regression models were\ndesigned to assess the association between obesity class\n(with normal weight [BMI<25.0 kg/m2] as the reference\npoint) with CRP and fibrinogen levels. Adjusted models\naccounted for the possible effects of sex, age, race, smoking\nstatus, alcohol usage, arthritis status, blood pressure, and\ntriglyceride levels. Analysis of variance was used to\ncompare mean biomarker concentrations between all\ngroups. To determine if mean biomarker concentrations\ndiffered between participants with hypertension and diabe-\ntes compared to participants without hypertension and\ndiabetes according to obesity class, a multiplicative\ninteraction term was created between the BMI variable\nand the dichotomous disease variable for inclusion in\nadditional regression analyses. A similar strategy was\napplied to test for differences in biomarker marker levels\nby weight class and ethnicity. Unless otherwise noted, data\nare presented as mean\u00b1standard error (SE) and statistical\nsignificance was set at p values <0.05.\nResults\nTable 1 lists the demographics of the study population\naccording to obesity class. The majority of the study\nindividuals were categorized as normal or overweight;\n3,262 of the study participants were categorized as obesity\nclass 1; 1,335 of the study population were categorized as\nobesity class 2; and 827 individuals were categorized as\nobesity class 3 (BMI40). Estimates for the presence of\ndiabetes and hypertension within each of the weight classes\nshows that those in the normal weight group had the lowest\nprevalence of diabetes at 1.3% and hypertension at 6.8%\nwhile those in obesity class 3 had the highest prevalence for\nAssociation between CRP Levels and Obesity Class\nThe association between CRP and obesity class was\ninitially examined using linear regression without adjust-\nments and results were similar to those from adjusted linear\nregression (data not shown). Table 2 presents the change in\nCRP levels across weight classes after adjusting the\nregression model for age, gender, race/ethnicity, systolic\nblood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, triglyceride level,\npresence of arthritis, smoking status, and alcohol consump-\ntion. There was a positive association between CRP\nconcentration and each of the BMI levels (p<0.01). The\nmean CRP level for the reference group, which consisted of\nnon-smoking, white males with a BMI <25 kg/m2, was\n0.05 mg/dl. With each increase in weight category, the\nThe largest increase in CRP concentration was among\nindividuals in obesity class 3. A test for trend showed that\nthe overall increasing change in CRP concentrations was\nstatistically significant (p=0.04).

An upward trend was observed for mean\nfibrinogen levels across weight classes where concentrations\nranged from 287.28 mg/dl for normal weight individuals to\nnormal weight individuals as a reference, the mean fibrinogen\nlevels for those in the overweight category increased by 11.5\u00b1\n10.1 mg/dl for obesity class 3 individuals (Table 2). Changes\nin fibrinogen levels across all weight classes compared to\nfibrinogen levels in the normal weight group were statistically\nsignificant (p<0.01). The greatest increase in mean fibrinogen\nlevel was among the obesity class 3 group where mean\nfibrinogen levels increased by 32.5% compared to fibrinogen\nlevels in the normal weight group. Analysis on the relation-\nship between BMI and fibrinogen levels persists when further\nstratified by ethnicity (Table 4).\nAssociation between Inflammatory Biomarkers\nwith Diabetes and Hypertension\nResults from regression analysis confirmed that a synergis-\ntic relationship exists between levels of inflammatory\nbiomarkers with diabetes and hypertension, even when\nstratified by BMI. Within each BMI category, additional\nsubgroups were created based on the presence or absence of\ndiabetes or hypertension and the mean CRP and fibrinogen\nconcentrations were determined. Individuals with diabetes\nhad higher mean CRP and higher mean fibrinogen concen-\ntrations than individuals without diabetes even when\nstratified according to BMI (Tables 5 and 6). Similarly,\nindividuals with hypertension had higher mean CRP and\nhigher mean fibrinogen concentrations than individuals\nwithout hypertension even when stratified according to\nBMI (Tables 5 and 6).\nDiscussion\nIn this cross-sectional analysis of US men and women, the\nlowest concentrations of CRP and fibrinogen were found\namong normal weight individuals. As BMI ranges in-\ncreased from overweight to obesity classes 1, 2, and 3, CRP\nrespectively, and fibrinogen levels increased by 11.5\u00b1\n10.1 mg/dl, respectively. The strongest association between\nobesity and change in biomarker concentration was\nobserved among those in obesity class 3.\nObesity class (body mass index, kg/m2) Mean CRP level (mg/dl)\u00b1standard error\nNon-Hispanic White Non-Hispanic Black Mexican American Other\nWithin each obesity class, mean CRP concentration was significantly different across the ethnicity groups; p value <0.01 for the interaction term\nfor BMI and ethnicity\nObesity class (body mass index, kg/m2) Mean fibrinogen level (mg/dl)\u00b1standard error\nNon-Hispanic White Non-Hispanic Black Mexican American Other\nWithin each obesity class, mean fibrinogen concentration was significantly different across the ethnicity groups; p value=0.02 for the interaction\nterm for BMI and ethnicity\nWe observed a strong association between increasing\nweight class and increasing CRP concentrations. Compared\nto normal weight individuals, there was a 2-fold increase in\nmean CRP levels in overweight individuals; a 4-fold\nincrease in obesity class 1 individuals; and an 8-fold and\n14-fold increase among obesity class 2 and obesity class 3\nindividuals, respectively.

Elevated fibrinogen levels have\nbeen previously shown to associate with insulin resistance\nand atherosclerosis.34 We also examined fibrinogen con-\ncentrations across weight class according to diabetes status.\nOur findings suggest that increasing severity of obesity is\nassociated with increased risk for diabetes. The results also\nsupport the idea that inflammation may play a role in the\ndevelopment of insulin resistance,35 underlying the impor-\ntance of having a normal BMI to prevent the disease onset.\nIn addition to what has been presented in past studies,\nthis study quantifies the estimated change in biomarker\nconcentrations across different weight classes. As antici-\npated, those individuals in the highest weight class, obesity\nclass 3, had significantly higher CRP and fibrinogen\nconcentrations relative to the normal BMI group as well\nas the other weight groups. This trend did not change with\nadjustments for age, gender, arthritis status, race/ethnicity,\nor smoking, suggesting that the observed CRP\u00adobesity\nrelationship is not due to other factors possibly affecting\nCRP levels and/or weight status. When we stratified by\ndiabetes status, we also found that individuals in obesity\nclass 3 had higher biomarker levels than those in obesity\nclasses 1 and 2. This was also observed when we compared\nObesity class (body mass index, kg/m2) Mean CRP level (mg/dl)\u00b1standard error\nNo diabetes Diabetes* No hypertension Hypertension**\n*p value<0.01, CRP levels and diabetes interaction using 2-way ANOVA, **p value=0.06, CRP levels and hypertension interaction using two-\nObesity class (body mass index, kg/m2) Mean fibrinogen level (mg/dl)\u00b1standard error\nNo diabetes Diabetes* No hypertension Hypertension**\n*p value=0.09, fibrinogen levels and diabetes interaction using two-way ANOVA, **p value<0.01, fibrinogen levels and hypertension interaction\nusing two-way ANOVA\nCRP levels between diabetics and non-diabetics in obesity\nclass 3 to those in the overweight and normal weight\ncategories. Extending our analyses, we also stratified by\nhypertension status, reporting the mean biomarker concen-\ntrations within each weight class for a representative US\npopulation. The general trend supports our primary hy-\npothesis that inflammation severity, indicated by elevated\nbiomarker levels, directly correlates to weight class.\nInflammation in the presence of obesity is thought to\narise primarily in adipose tissue as a result of chronic\ndisruption of metabolic homeostasis, which leads to\nincreased cytokine production and the activation of inflam-\nclinical study by Madsen and colleagues investigated the\neffects of short-term and long-term weight loss on levels of\nCRP and fibrinogen among obese subjects and found that\nlong-term weight loss was associated with decreased CRP\nand fibrinogen concentrations.37 A systematic review found\nthat for each 1 kg of weight loss, mean CRP levels were\nreduced by 0.13 mg/l.38 Moderate, short-term weight loss,\nhowever, was shown to have no effect on fibrinogen\nlevels,23 suggesting that long-term weight loss solutions\nthrough lifestyle changes or surgical intervention may be\nmore useful for reducing inflammation and related disease\nrisks.\nLimitations of this study include the lack of repeated\nmeasurements of biomarker levels as well as the absence of\ninformation regarding any previous medical or surgical\ntreatment for obesity. Additionally, the extent of our study\non inflammatory biomarkers was limited by the availability\nof biomarker measurements in the NHANES dataset; we\ndid not have the opportunity to access other markers of\ninflammation such as interleukin-6 or TNF-alpha.

However, in\nthis study, possible information and recall biases were\nminimized by taking into account additional data collected\non hypertension and diabetes medication usage as well as\nany relevant examination or laboratory data. Additionally,\nthe under- or over-reporting of hypertension and diabetes\nshould be similar across BMI categories. Despite these\nlimitations, this study utilizes a large, comprehensive data\nset that serves as a representative sample of the US\npopulation, allowing for greater generalizability of the\nstudy results. Multiple markers of inflammation were also\nassessed, which increased the possibility of capturing a\nmore complete description of inflammatory status among\nindividuals. Future studies are needed to determine if the\nchanges in inflammatory markers further differ among\nobese individuals, and whether inflammatory biomarker\nlevels decrease at a different rate and by different amounts\nin obesity class 1 vs. obesity class 2 or 3. If trends from this\ncurrent study are persistent in such future studies, we\nanticipate that changes in levels of inflammatory bio-\nmarkers will differ according to weight class. Thus, the\ncurrent findings of an association of CRP and fibrinogen\nand body weight, if causal, would imply that weight\nreduction leads to reduced prevalence of inflammation with\nattendant public health benefits.\nConclusions\nThis study demonstrates that levels of inflammatory\nbiomarkers vary across weight classes, and that this\ndifference in CRP and fibrinogen concentration is persistent\nwhen patients are subgrouped by ethnicity and by the\npresence or absence of diabetes and hypertension. As\nshown in our analyses, an increase in severity of obesity\ncorresponded to higher CRP and fibrinogen levels. Such\nelevated biomarker concentrations based on a 6-year period\nbe within normal range of having a BMI less than 25.0 to\npossibly reduce the burden of obesity-related comorbidities\nin the US.\nOpen Access This article is distributed under the terms of the\nCreative Commons Attribution Noncommercial License which per-\nmits any noncommercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any\nmedium, provided the original author(s) and source are credited.\nReferences\n1.
