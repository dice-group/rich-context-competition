I would\nlike to thank Klaus Adam, Lawrence Christiano, Peter Karadi, Michael Krause, St\u00e9phane Moyen, Josef\nHollmayr, Ansgar Rannenberg, and seminar participants at the Bundesbank for helpful comments.\nThe paper represents the personal opinion of the author and does not necessarily reflect the views of the\nDeutsche Bundesbank.\n1 Introduction\nWhen the severity of the 2007-09 financial crisis became apparent, governments and cen-\ntral banks alike introduced unconventional policy measures to mitigate the spillover effects\nfrom the financial sector to the real economy. Particularly given the large amount of fi-\nnancial resources used to fight the recession, policy makers are interested in assessing\nthe efficacy of the unconventional measures taken. Moreover, it is also important to\nknow which measures are most suited to which conditions. This paper contributes to\nthis discussion by comparing different measures within the same consistent framework of\na dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model that allows for an elaborated\nfinancial sector with banks and a capital market and in which loans are the main source\nof funding.\nCountries and public agents took manifold measures during the financial crisis. On\nthe one hand, central banks started to buy private assets and government bonds out-\nright as well as providing liquidity to the banking sector.1 On the other hand, policy\nmeasures conducted by the central banks were often flanked by operations undertaken\nby governments. Their actions to support the financial sector mainly centered on the\nrecapitalization of banks.2 A number of papers investigate empirically the success of\nunconventional monetary policy measures. Empirical studies mostly try to evaluate the\neffects on interest rates or yields, while the effect on the real economy is not explicitly\nmodeled (D'Amico, English, Lop\u00e9z-Salido, and Nelson, 2012; Gagnon, Raskin, Remache,\nSwanson, 2011). The borrowing conditions for non-financial firms seemed to be affected\npositively in the USA (e.g. D'Amico et al., 2012; Gagnon et al., 2011; Krishnamurthy\nand Vissing-Jorgensen, 2011) and the UK (e.g. Joyce, Lasaosa, Stevens, and Tong, 2011;\nJoyce and Tong, 2012). Only few studies scrutinize empirically the effects of unconven-\ntional measures on the real economy. The study of Baumeister and Benati (2013) is geared\nto the USA and the UK, while Kapetanios, Mumtaz, Stevens, and Theodoridis (2012) fo-\ncus on the UK. Both papers report significant effects from asset purchases on output and\ninflation. In this respect, the ECB's unconventional measures are also reported to be\nsuccessful (see Fahr, Motto, Rostagno, Smets, and Tristani, 2011; Giannone, Lenza, Pill,\nand Reichlin, 2012; Peersman, 2011). An inherent problem with empirical work is that\n1Outright purchases were primarily conducted by the Federal Reserve with its Large Scale Asset\nPurchase Programs (LSAP 1 to 3), the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England but also by the Eurosystem\nwith its Covered Bond Purchase Programs (CBPP 1 and 2). Liquidity was provided in a variety of ways;\nthe Federal Reserve offered banks inter alia the opportunity to obtain central bank money by putting\nadvances forward as collateral. One major element of the Eurosystem's crisis resolution strategy was\nthe introduction of full allotment for central bank lending in conjunction with longer-term refinancing\noperations (LTROs), which allowed banks to receive reserves for a longer fixed period of time. Similar\npolicy instruments were also applied by the Bank of Japan. An essential tool for many central banks was\nthe expansion of the list of assets eligible as collateral together with a reduction in haircuts for central\nbank lending.\n2In the USA, the Treasury Department established the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), which\ncontained several instruments. One of these was the Capital Purchase Program (CPP), which provided\nadditional capital to financial institutions in order to compensate for losses by buying preferred stocks, for\ninstance. Similar tools were also used in Japan and in Europe. In Germany, for instance, the government\nintroduced the Special Financial Market Stabilization Fund (\"Finanzmarktstabilisierungsfonds\") that not\nonly guaranteed banks' capital issues but also recapitalized banks directly.\nthe effects of one specific measure cannot clearly be isolated because different measures\nwere applied simultaneously which results in an identification problem.\nTo circumvent this problem, theoretical models have been developed to study the ef-\nfects of different measures in isolation, i.e. policy tools are imitated to find an answer to\nthe question of macroeconomic feedback effects. Gertler and Karadi (2011) and Gertler\nand Karadi (2013) can, in principle, demonstrate that asset purchases have important ef-\nfects using New Keynesian DSGE models. The results of Dedola, Karadi, and Lombardo\n(2013) go in the same direction by stressing the potential of domestic programs to spill\nover internationally. Other models provide a more general result: asset purchases im-\nprove financial intermediation in times of financial stress but are ineffective in other cases\nother studies, Chen, C\u00fardia, and Ferrero (2012) report only marginal effects of asset pur-\nchases on output and inflation for the USA.3 Besides asset purchases, the recapitalization\nof banks, by providing net worth, seems to mitigate tensions in the financial sector very\nsignificantly (Christiano and Ikeda, 2013a; He and Krishnamurthy, 2013; Hirakata, Sudo,\nFollowing Gertler and Karadi (2011) and Gertler and Karadi (2013), outright pur-\nchases of assets seem to succeed in mitigating financial stress in economies which rely\non market-based financing.4 In a market-based economy, the stabilization of asset prices\nhas two effects: on the one hand, the value of these assets is supported, which stabilizes\nthe balance sheet of their holders. Asset purchases indirectly recapitalize the financial\nintermediaries in this environment, and lending to the non-financial sector is facilitated.\nOn the other hand, borrowing conditions in the real sector improve at the same time.\nHowever, few papers evaluate the effects of outright purchases in an economy in which\nnon-financial firms predominantly rely on non-market-based financing by taking loans,\ni.e. in an economy in which the second channel is of minor importance. Such a setting\ncomes closer to the structure of the euro area's economy compared to the US economy.5\nMarket-based debt is much more common in the USA than in the euro area, and equity\nconsists mostly of outside equity in the USA and not of inside equity, as in the euro\narea.6 From this point of view, it is of interest to investigate how asset purchases affect a\nnon-market-based economy.\nOur paper's main contribution is as follows: We draw on a fully specified New Key-\nnesian general equilibrium model, in which non-financial firms predominantly take non-\nmarket-based loans from banks in order to investigate the efficacy of outright purchases\nof bonds and the recapitalization of banks in a financial crisis situation. We compare not\nonly the qualitative properties but also the quantitative effects of the policy measures in\na model economy that exhibits features of and is calibrated to the euro area. Besides\ninvestigating the dynamics, we evaluate the measures from a welfare perspective. In this\nrespect, we differentiate between financial shocks with two different origins.\nBanks are faced with constraints resulting from agency problems with their creditors\n3Chen et al. (2012) estimate a DSGE model for the USA and simulate large-scale asset purchases.\n4This conclusion follows from their setting in which assets with market-determined prices dominate\nthe balance sheet of the financial intermediary.\n5See Table 6 in the appendix.\n6Market-based debt means that the debt instrument has a market-determined price that can change.\nConversely, non-market-based debt is not traded on a market and has a price of unity.\nC\u00fardia and Woodford, 2011). Moreover, agency problems also exist between banks and\nnon-financial firms (Bernanke, Gertler, and Gilchrist, 1999; Christiano, Motto, and Ros-\ntagno, 2014). For this reason, it is necessary to draw on a model that allows for financial\nfrictions on both sides of banks' balance sheet, i.e. to allow for two-sided financial con-\ntracting. Some recent contributions construct such a framework by relying on the costly\nstate verification framework on both sides of financial contracting (Hirakata, Sudo, and\ndefaults in both the real and the banking sector to be taken into account. However,\nchanges in bank lending rates reflect market forces and costs related to bank defaults. We\nwant to isolate market forces from default costs in the banking sector because the latter\nmeans bank runs or depositor insurances need to be taken into account. Nevertheless,\nbankruptcy costs stemming from the real sector might be relevant for the banking sector.\nFor this reason, we combine the approaches of Bernanke et al. (1999) and Gertler and Kiy-\notaki (2010).7 Thus, we assume a costly state verification problem between the financial\nsector and non-financial firms, while funders of banks are confronted with a costly en-\nforcement problem. In doing so, we additionally introduce two distinct debt instruments\nfor non-financial firms: non-market-based debt (loans) and market-based debt (corporate\nbonds). Consequently, our banks intermediate funds to non-financial firms by granting\nloans and buying corporate bonds. Furthermore, we allow our banks to hold government\nbonds.\nIn this framework, we scrutinize the effects of outright purchases of both government\nand corporate bonds, as well as of injections of equity into banks (build up of net worth).\nThese measures are similar to the measures investigated in Gertler and Kiyotaki (2010),\nKiyotaki (2010), our approach makes two additional contributions to the literature: firstly,\nwe apply a New Keynesian model with nominal and financial frictions instead of a real\nbusiness cycle framework, and secondly, we model the distinct policy measures within the\nsame model. Gertler and Kiyotaki (2010) basically apply the same modeling framework;\nnevertheless, they tailor their exact model to the policy measure under investigation.\nThis can potentially neglect important feedback effects, which we do not exclude a priori\nthrough the construction of our model. As in our case, Christiano and Ikeda (2013a)\nalso allow for tax-financed measures conducted by the government.9 Furthermore, they\nalso compare the effects of different intervention policies that are close to ours across\ndifferent models but do not embed these measures into a macroeconomic model as we\ndo.10 Although Gertler and Karadi (2013) also consider purchases of government bonds\nin a New Keynesian model, our framework allows for one additional asset on banks'\n8Both papers introduce financial friction between the banks and their creditors. In the model of\nGertler and Kiyotaki (2010), banks can divert a fraction of the financial resources they receive from\ntheir creditors, which is why bank net worth is important to guarantee repayment. Christiano and Ikeda\n(2013a) formulate, inter alia, the financial frictions slightly differently by stating that bankers must make\nan effort to choose projects with good returns (hidden action). Similarly, net worth helps to stabilize the\npay-off.\n9In their model, the tax is a lump-sum tax rather than a distortionary tax on wages as in our case.\n10Their focus is on the qualitative properties of different financial sector models.\nbalance sheets, whereas the main financial instrument in our model are loans rather than\nsecurities, as in their model.11 He and Krishnamurthy (2013), by contrast, do not rely\non the New Keynesian framework. Regarding the question of capital injections, Hirakata\net al. (2013) and Sandri and Valencia (2013) are closer to us. They draw on the costly state\nverification problem to motivate both financial frictions and investigate equity injections.\nHowever, we are able to investigate equity injections and asset purchases in the same\nframework simultaneously, which they are not.\nOur results indicate that the injection of inside equity, i.e. enhancing banks' net\nworth, is more efficient from a welfare perspective than asset purchases in order to miti-\ngate tensions resulting from the banking sector.12 Outright asset purchases, by contrast,\nmust be conducted on a larger scale in order to be quantitatively similarly successful in\nour economy, in which non-market-based financing is for non-financial corporations the\npredominant source to obtain external funds. However, too large equity injections start\nto harm welfare because they cause additional volatility at some point. Furthermore, the\norigin of the financial shock is important for the results. If financial stress does not stem\nfrom the banking sector in the first place, the welfare-improving range of equity injections\ninto banks is very small because the default risk of non-financial firms matters.\nOur results complement those of Gertler and Karadi (2011) or Gertler and Karadi\n(2013) who investigate asset purchases for an economy in which banks predominantly\nhold securities. In those cases, asset purchases stabilize the value of banks' assets and\nconsequently banks' net worth. In our case, asset purchases primarily reduce returns,\nwhich also weakens banks' net worth by reduced profits. Because of the dominance of\nnon-market-based debt in banks' balance sheets, the stabilizing role of asset purchases on\nasset prices is of minor importance. Thus, equity injections into banks are very powerful\nif the banking sector causes financial stress because equity injections alleviate financial\nfrictions.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a description\nand derivation of the model. In Section 3, we discuss calibration and the obtained steady\nstate values. Dynamics are presented in Section 4. Here we start with a comparison of the\ndynamics resulting from our model with those of standard models following a monetary\npolicy shock and a productivity shock. Then we discuss two types of financial shock\nbefore turning to the investigation of the policy measures. Section 5 concludes.\nThe modeling framework relies on the well-known class of DNK models, as outlined in\nSmets and Wouters (2003) or Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (2005). A standard\nDNK model is extended to include a financial sector in the sense that we introduce both\na bank and a capital market which both allocate financial resources. There is a financial\ncontracting problem between the real sector and the financial market and between the\nbank and its creditors. While in the first case lenders are confronted with a costly state\nverification problem, as outlined in Bernanke et al. (1999), the agency problem between\n11In addition, equity injections are not addressed in their model.\n12These results are principally in line with Christiano and Ikeda (2013a) and He and Krishnamurthy\nthe bank and its shareholders is modeled as proposed by Gertler and Kiyotaki (2010)\nand Gertler and Karadi (2011). This allows us to abstract from default problems in the\nbanking sector and is proposed and discussed by Rannenberg (2013). Our model consists\nof households, two types of entrepreneur, intermediate goods firms, final goods firms,\nmutual funds, banks and a public sector as active agents.\nA continuum of households save, consume and supply labor to the intermediate goods\nfirms. Households receive income from labor and from financial assets to consume a bundle\nof final goods, purchased from final goods firms. The financial wealth of households arises\nfrom holdings of corporate and government bonds, and bank deposits.\nWe distinguish between two types of entrepreneur (type A and type B entrepreneurs)\nto introduce a role for different debt instruments. Both entrepreneurs process newly pro-\nduced physical capital which is exposed to the individual skills of each entrepreneur and\nis then rented out to intermediate goods firms. Related to the entrepreneur, we allow\nfor two different stocks of capital.13 The two types of entrepreneur own different types\nof capital which are both used complementarily in the production of intermediate goods.\nBoth types of entrepreneur can finance their projects by raising external funds in excess of\ntheir net worth. Both types of physical capital are rented out to intermediate goods firms,\nwhich combine physical capital with rented labor to produce differentiated intermediate\ngoods. The intermediate goods firms sell their goods in a market of monopolistic com-\npetition to final goods producers. Finally, the final goods firms bundle the differentiated\ngoods into a homogenous final good. The final good can be used for consumption, in\ncapital utilization, as investment goods, or as government expenditures.\nBanks hold two different types of asset received from the private sector: loans and\nbonds from entrepreneurs. Moreover, lending banks purchase government bonds. They\nobtain funds from households through deposits.\nThe economy is populated by a continuum of households which are indexed by h with\nh  (0, 1). Each h-th household decides on the supply of labor, how much to consume\nand to save, and on the allocation of its wealth. Households' utility function is given in\nEquation (1)\nEj\n\nj\nCh,t+j\n- hCCt-1+j\n- \n(Nh,t+j\nwith discount factor  and the remaining variables described in this subsection. House-\nholds evaluate consumption relative to an external habit stock that is the value of the\nlast period's aggregate consumption. In this respect, the term hC reflects the impor-\ntance of external habits with hC  (0, 1), and  determines the elasticity of intertemporal\nsubstitution.\nThe households supply differentiated labor services (Nh,t\n) to the intermediate goods\nsector. Because of a monopolistically competitive labor market in which labor services\nare imperfect substitutes, each household has market power to set its nominal wage (Wt\n).\n13This is a slight modification of standard DNK models. A similar approach is often applied if impatient\nand patient households are introduced, for example, with applications to housing markets.\nFollowing Erceg, Henderson, and Levin (2000), we assume, in analogy to Calvo pricing,\nthat the household is not able to renegotiate its nominal wage each period. Instead, it can\nonly reoptimize with a specific probability (1 - w). In periods in which the household\ncannot renegotiate, it follows an indexation rule ~\nWt\n)w\n, where w\nis the weighting parameter. A labor agency is introduced that buys differentiated labor\nfrom households and pays the individual wage in order to produce a representative labor\naggregate as output\nNt\n=\n^\nNh,t\n dh\n\nwhere w is the degree of substitution. By minimizing the costs of producing this aggre-\ngator, the labor agency takes the wage rates of each differentiated labor input as given.\nFrom this optimization problem follows the demand for labor of household h for use in\ngoods production\nNh,t\n= Nt\nWh,t\nWt\n-w\nBy combining Equations (2) and (3), one obtains the aggregate wage index\nWt\n=\n^\nh,t\ndh\nWith the knowledge of demand for its labor, the household can proceed with determining\nthe optimal wage rate (W\nh,t\n) and the optimal labor supply (N\nh,t\n). Thus, it maximizes\nmax\n{Wh,t\n}\nEt\n\n(w)s -\nN\nh,t+s\n+ h,t+s\nw\nt+s\nt\n) W\nh,t\nPt+s\nN\nh,t+s\nby making use of Equation (3). The term  reflects the inverse Frisch elasticity. Changes\nin rates of inflation until date s, which are important for indexation, are summarized in\nw\nt+s\nin Equation (5). Before utility maximization is carried out, the optimal nominal\nwage emerges from a sub-problem in which the household minimizes its disutility of labor\nby choosing its nominal wage given the labor demand of firms.14\nSimilar to Gertler and Kiyotaki (2010) or Gertler and Karadi (2011), we assume that\nsome household members become banker managers who operate banks. The share of\nhousehold members in the banking sector in each period is sBM . In order to keep the\nshares constant over time, we assume that exactly the same number of workers become\nbankers as bankers return to the goods producing sector. The probability of staying a\nbanker pBM is exogenously fixed and does not change over time. The profits each bank\nmanager potentially earns are not transferred to the household before the bank manager\nleaves the bank, which happens with a probability of 1 - pBM .15 In addition, a specific\nshare se of households becomes entrepreneurs. Like bank managers, entrepreneurs survive\nwith a probability of pe. During the time they are entrepreneurs, household members\n14The derivation is presented in the appendix.\n15The reason why bankers exit lending banks is to guarantee that the lending banks do not accumulate\nequity indefinitely (see Gertler and Karadi (2011) or Gertler and Kiyotaki (2010)).\naccumulate net wealth, which is transferred back to the household when they leave the\nentrepreneurial sector.\nHouseholds place deposits (Dt\n) with banks, buy risk-free bonds which consist of short-\nterm Bshort,gov\nt\nand long-term government bonds (Bgov\nt\n) and (short-term) bonds issued\nby a public agency BIA\nt\n.16 On holdings of short-term government bonds and agency's\nbonds, summarized as short-term public sector debt BPS\nt\n, they receive the risk-free rate\nit\n, while they obtain the risk-free return rB,gov\nt\non long-term government bonds which bear\na coupon of igov\nand are traded at price QB,gov\nt\nIn order to allow for longer-term bonds, we follow Woodford (2001) and assume that\nonly a fraction of the government bonds (B,gov) issued last period are repaid this period.18\nRegarding the definition of the bond rate (rB,gov\nt\n) we obtain\nrB,gov\nt\n= t\nB,govQB,gov\nt\n+ igov\nQB,gov\nfor government bonds. In addition, deviations in the holdings of government bonds from\ntheir steady state value (Bgov\nh\n) entail costs\ngov,H\nt\n=\nB,gov\nBgov\nh,t+j\n- Bgov\nh\nQB,gov\nh,t+j\nwith B,gov as a scaling parameter. This approach is based on Gertler and Karadi (2013)\nand takes arguments from the \"preferred habitat\" theory of the term structure into ac-\ncount.\nFurthermore, households own intermediate goods firms and receive dividend payments\n(Divh,t\n) at the end of the period from them. Taken together, households earn money from\ninterest payments on their bond and deposit holdings, labor income and the dividends\npaid by intermediate goods firms. Since the supply of differentiated labor leads to different\nstreams of income, we follow Erceg et al. (2000) and assume that households bought state-\ncontingent securities with a lump-sum transfer. This is to make sure that all agents are\nable to consume the same amount each period, i.e. to equalize income differences among\nthe continuum of households. Households' expenditures are allotted to consumption, to\nlump-sum taxes, to lump-sum transfers including payments to entrepreneurs and bank\nmanagers, h,t\n, and to the purchase of financial assets, i.e. public sector bonds, corporate\nbonds, and deposits.\n16We introduce long-term bonds mainly because we want to allow government bonds to have a time-\nvarying market price, similar to Gertler and Karadi (2013).\n17In the following, we mean default-free if we talk about risk-free rates and spreads.\n18Chen et al. (2012) also allow for a maturity structure. While they use the yield-to-maturity in their\nmodel, we draw on the period return.\nThe budget constraint in real terms becomes\n)\nPt+j\n+ 1 + rB,gov\nt+j\nQB,gov\nBn,gov\nPt+j\nDn\nPt+j\nt\n)\nWh,t+j\nPt+j\nNh,t+j\n+\nDivh,t+j\nPt+j\n+ h,t+j\n Ch,t+j\n+ Tt+j\n+\nDn\nh,t+j\nPt+j\n+\nh,t+j\nPt+j\n+ gov,H\nt\n,\nwhere the superscript n denotes nominal terms.\nFrom the no-arbitrage conditions follow that each household holds the same amount\nof assets, which is why we can aggregate easily. First-order conditions can be found in\nthe technical appendix.\n2.2 Final goods firms\nWe assume that there is a continuum of intermediate goods producers in a market with\nmonopolistic competition where the i-th firm sells the i-th differentiated good to final\ngoods firms. The final goods sector is characterized by a representative final goods pro-\nducer that operates under conditions of perfect competition. The final good (Yt\n) is a\ncomposite of the continuum of differentiated intermediate goods (\n\u00b4\nYi,t\n di) purchased\nfrom the monopolistic competitive firms in the intermediate goods market (see, for ex-\nample, Smets and Wouters, 2003). The composite good arises from applying a bundling\ntechnology (Dixit-Stiglitz aggregator)\nYt\n=\n^\nYi,t\n di\n\nwhere the parameter  determines the degree of substitution among the intermediate\ngoods. By taking the prices of the intermediate goods as well as the price of the final good\nas given, the final goods firm maximizes its profits by choosing the amount of intermediate\ngoods and the amount of output of final goods. From the optimization problem follows\nthe demand function for intermediate goods\nYi,t\n= Yt\nPi,t\nPt\n-\nwhere Pit\nis the price of the i-th intermediate good and Pt\nthe price of the final good.\n2.3 Intermediate goods firms\nThe intermediate goods firms plan to rent capital (Ki,t\n) from the entrepreneurs and ho-\nmogeneous labor (Ni,t\n) from the households for use in production. As in standard DNK\nmodels, we assume a standard production function of the Cobb-Douglas type with con-\nstant returns to scale and fixed costs ()\nYi,t\n= exp (At\n) Ki,t\n\nNi,t\n- i\nwhere the term  is the share of capital in production. The term At\nallows for (stationary)\nshocks on total factor productivity with disturbance A\nt\nAt\n+ A\nt\n,\nwhere A is an autoregressive parameter. We allow for different types of capital in the pro-\nduction process such that\nKi,t\n= KA\nws\nKB\ni,t\n, where A and B refer to type A and B entrepreneurs and\nws is the share of utilized type A entrepreneurs' capital in utilized total capital. We mod-\nify the production technology because we later introduce two different debt instruments.\nFor this reason, we will attribute the production of one capital good to one specific debt\nAs is well known, the optimization problem each intermediate goods firm faces is\ntwofold. On the one hand, firms minimize their real costs by choosing inputs given their\nproduction technology. Thus,\nmin\n{Ki,t,Ni,t}\nrk,A\nt\nKA\ni,t\n+ rk,B\nt\nKB\ni,t\n+ wt\nNi,t\ns.t. Yi,t\n= At\nKA\ni,t\nws\nKB\ni,t\nNi,t\n- i\n.\nThe terms rk,A\nt\nand rk,B\nt\nare the cost of capital and wt\nis the real wage. The first order\nconditions for the minimization problem of each intermediate goods firm are presented in\nthe technical appendix from Equations (66) to (69). With their help it can be shown that\nthe ratio of type B entrepreneurs' capital to type A entrepreneurs' capital as well as the\ncapital to labor ratios are the same across all firms.\nSince the intermediate goods firms operate in a market with monopolistic competition,\nthey are basically free to set the price optimally given the demand for their goods as\npresented in Equation (9). Based on Calvo (1983), optimal pricing is only possible with\na probability of 1 - . Furthermore, we assume that the remaining fraction of firms that\ncannot optimize their price set the price equal to its value last period multiplied by the\npast rate of inflation (t-1\n) which is weighted by the steady state rate of inflation ().20\n19Fisher (1999) also introduces heterogeneous financially constrained firms and proceeds similarly. In\ncontrast to him, we do not introduce two complete goods producing sectors with fixed input shares and\na bundling technology to produce the final good. Instead, we split up the physical stock of capital. Our\napproach allows us in a sense to endogenize the financing decision in terms of the intermediate goods by\nvarying the capital input.\n20The price indexation is a combination of the indexation rules in Erceg et al. (2000) and Smets and\nWouters (2003) and can also be found in Christiano et al. (2014), whereas we replace the target inflation\nrate with the steady state rate of inflation.\nConsequently, the optimization problem becomes\nmax\n{P\ni,t\n}\nEt\n\njj Yi,t\nP\ni,t\n- mci,t+j\nPt+j\n.\nThe optimal price of the intermediate good is denoted by P\ni,t\nand mci,t\nrepresents the\nmarginal costs. The first-order conditions can be found in the technical appendix.\n2.4 Capital producers\nThe economy is populated by capital producers that are owned by households and work in\na market of perfect competition. Capital producers produce two different sorts of capital.\nBy doing so, they combine undepreciated physical capital with investment goods of class\ne to produce new physical capital of the same class.\nKe\nt\n= Ke\n(1 - e) + Ie\nt\nIe\nt\nIe\nEquation (11) presents the law of motion of capital, where Ke\nt\nis the capital stock, e the\nrate of depreciation and Ie\nt\nthe amount of investment goods. Since adjusting the capital\nstock involves costs, the term  Ie\nt\nIe\ndescribes the cost function which is, following\n\nIe\nt\nIe\n=\ne\nIe\nt\nIe\nCapital producers maximize their profits by determining the amount of newly produced\ninvestment goods. For convenience, investment goods have the same price as physical\ncapital.\nmax\nt\nt\n}\nEt\ne=A,B\n\njQe\nt+j\nKe\nt+j\n(1 - e) + Ie\nt+j\nIe\nt+j\nIe\n- Ke\n.\nIn reality, it is often the case that access to the financial market is restricted for some kinds\nof enterprises. The difference in entrepreneurs' size can be seen as one reason why different\nfinancial segments are used (see, for instance, Krishnaswami, Spindt, and Subramaniam,\n1999). Nevertheless, size-related transaction costs are only one explanation for the varying\naccess to the capital market. In principle, the availability of sufficient public information\non creditworthiness mainly explains why firms enter the capital market (see Diamond,\nto look at different ways of financing debt, we need to introduce two different financial\nsectors, which is rarely done in the literature. Fisher (1999), for example, introduces\nheterogeneity in a setting similar to Bernanke et al. (1999) and distinguishes between a\nfinancially constrained and an unstrained sector.21 De Fiore and Uhlig (2012) embed a\nframework of heterogeneous firms developed in De Fiore and Uhlig (2011) in a general\nequilibrium model. As opposed to Fisher (1999), all firms have private information,\nwhereas financial intermediaries have different degrees of access to information.22\nWe principally follow Bernanke et al. (1999) and assume that the economy is populated\nby a continuum of entrepreneurs that buy capital from capital producers and transform\nthe capital into new capital exposed to an idiosyncratic processing risk. After observing\nthe shock, the entrepreneurs rent the capital out to goods producers and receive rents\nfrom them. Since the entrepreneurs finance the capital purchases from their own net\nworth and external funds, the realization of the idiosyncratic shock affects their capacity\nBy introducing two financially constrained firms, our model is closely related to the\napproaches of Fisher (1999) and De Fiore and Uhlig (2012). We split the continuum\nof entrepreneurs, with m  [0, 1], into two groups e  [A, B] with A : m  [0, )\nand B : m  [ , 1]. Both groups face different degrees of credit constraint because\nentrepreneurs' creditors have different degrees of insight into shocks to their skills (i.e. to\ntheir productivity e\nt\n). The productivity shock on type A entrepreneurs' skills A\nt\ncan be\nobserved by paying a fixed fraction \u00b5A of the amount that can be recovered in the case\nof a default. Similarly, the productivity process of the type B entrepreneurs B\nt\nis not\nexclusive to the borrowers. However, it can only be discovered paying a greater fraction\n\u00b5B, with \u00b5B > \u00b5A, of the realizable assets. Since monitoring type B entrepreneurs is more\ncostly than monitoring type A entrepreneurs, the former will solely rely on bank finance,\nwhile the latter issue bonds in the capital market, which is basically in line with De Fiore\nand Uhlig (2011).23 Both entrepreneurs are modeled in accordance with BGG with the\npossibility of a steady state default, whereas the default risk of a type B entrepreneur is\ngreater than for a type A entrepreneur.24\n21In his model, the continuum of firms consists of two groups: one which has private information on\ntheir shock and one which shares the same information set with the financial intermediaries. Hence, the\nfirst group is credit constrained because lenders are confronted with a costly state verification problem\n(CSV) while the second group is unconstrained.\n22De Fiore and Uhlig (2011) introduce three different shocks to the productivity of goods producers.\nThe first shock is common knowledge, while the second can only be observed in relation to costs. Finally,\nthe third shock is private. Each shock plays its own role. While the first shock introduces heterogeneity\nacross firms, the second justifies the existence of a bank. The last shock is important for the credit\nconstraint.\n23In our model, each group makes use of only one specific form of debt finance. This is basically similar\n24For the sake of simplicity, we could call our two types of entrepreneur \"small\" (B) and \"large\" (A),\nalthough this distinction does not follow from their individual net worth, i.e. the net worth of the\nsmallest entrepreneur in the A-group is not necessarily greater than that of the largest in the B-group.\nThe labeling of the entrepreneurs would be arbitrary. We could have also defined one group \"high-risk\"\nand another group \"low-risk\" entrepreneurs (see, for instance, Bolton and Freixas, 2000) but we do not\nwant to stress the difference in risk too much. A more severe conceptual assumption is that there is no\ntransition between the groups. However, Levy and Hennessy (2007) also work with an ad hoc assumption\nconcerning the distinction between two types of firms. In their model, endowment issues are relevant\nfor the decision between equity and debt finance. The same is true for Fisher (1999) who makes an ad\nhoc assumption concerning credit constrained and unconstrained firms. Although the decision process\nis endogenized to a higher extent, each firm in De Fiore and Uhlig (2011, 2012) relies on one type of\nfinancing in the end. Nevertheless, our assumption is rather ad hoc but could be relaxed in a further\nFor capital processing, the entrepreneurs' individual skills are of importance and the\nentrepreneurs decide on the capital utilization (ue\nm,t\n), which can be varied. The skills\nof both type A and B entrepreneurs are subject to idiosyncratic shocks which affect\nthe physical properties of the capital. These shocks m,t\nare drawn from a lognormal\ndistribution with unit mean and are independent over time and across entrepreneurs. For\nthe m-th entrepreneur, we obtain the amount of processed capital ^\nKe\nm,t\n^\nKe\nm,t\n= e\nm,t\nKe\nm,t\nBoth types of entrepreneur finance the capital purchases with their own net worth\n(NWe\n) and external funds Le\nLe\n= Qe\nt\nKe\n- NWe\nwhere Qe\nt\nis the real price of entrepreneurs' capital. For type A entrepreneurs, this means\nthat they borrow from the capital market, proxied by mutual funds, the difference between\nthe value of their desired capital investment and their own net worth by issuing bonds\nBm,t\nat real price QB,corp\nt\n, i.e. LA\n= QB,corp\nt\n. Type B entrepreneurs obtain loans\nLe\nfrom banks.\nFor the case where the value of the project is exactly equal to the debt service, we can\ndefine e\nas a productivity threshold for which the borrower is just able to satisfy the\ndebt contract\ne,ex ante\nRk,e\nQe\nt\nKe\n= Ze\nLe\nwith Ze\nas the gross contract rate. We depart from the original BGG model and do not\nassume that the contract rate is state-contigent, which means that the contract is signed\nbefore the shocks materialize. Thus, we follow slightly Benes and Kumhof (2011) and\nZhang (2009) and replace the realized capital return by the expected capital return. This\ntiming convention proxies reality more closely, particularly for bank financing, and allows\nfor unexpected defaults in the period of the shocks. As a consequence, the productivity\nthreshold must be understood as an ex ante value. Given the expected gross return of\nthe project and its value as well as the borrowed amount, this threshold is linked to\nthe default-free risky bond rate. Equation (15) accordingly characterizes the optimal\ncontract. Since the contract is negotiated based upon the expected capital return, we\nhave to distinguish between ex ante and ex post thresholds. After the shock has occurred,\nthe realized (gross) capital return emerges as\nm,t\n= t\nrk,e\nm,t\nue\nt\n- (ue\nm,t\n) + Qe\nt\nQe\ne\nm,t\n= (1 + Rk,e\nm,t\n)e,ex post\nm,t\nFor the entrepreneur, there automatically arise two different scenarios in terms of\ndebt service. If the realized idiosyncratic shock is greater than (or equal to) the ex post\nthreshold, he will be able to repay his debt as contractually agreed and keep the difference\nas net earnings. However, a realization of the shock that is below the ex post threshold\nlevel results in a default, and the entrepreneur has to liquidate the remaining amount\nextension of the model.\ncompletely in order to satisfy its lenders. As a consequence, the shock also affects the\nrealized return on capital, as denoted by Rk,e\nm,t\nand given in Equation (16). Thus, the ex\npost productivity threshold e,ex post\n, below which defaults occur, turns out to be\ne,ex post\n=\nZe\nLe\nQe\nt\nKe\nwith variables as already defined (see, for instance, Zhang, 2009).25\nBased upon these considerations, the expected earnings of the m-th entrepreneur (Ee\nm,t\n)\ncan be calculated based upon the expected capital return and the ex ante productivity\nthreshold as\nEe\nm,t\n= E\n\u00b4\n\ne,ex ante\nedF (e; e\nt\n)\n- 1 - F e,ex ante\n; e\nt\ne,ex ante\nQe\nt\nKe\n.\nThe first term on the right-hand side characterizes the expected earnings from the project\nby taking all realizations for e\n e,ex ante\nm\ninto account, and the second term on the\nright-hand side reflects the payments to satisfy the debt contract. For e\n< e,ex ante\nm\n,\nthe entrepreneur would be left with no earnings. The function F e\n; e\nt\nin Equation\n(18) is the cumulative density function for realization of e\nm\nwhich means that its value\nfor e,ex ante\nm\nis the related ex ante default probability. The standard deviation e\nt\nof the\ndistribution can be time-varying, i.e. deviating from its steady state value e, and obeys\nan i.i.d. stochastic process where the variance of log  is 2\nt\nand  is an autoregressive\nparameter\nlog (e\nt\n) = (1 - ) log (e) + log e\n+ fin\nt\n.\nA time-varying standard deviation gives rise to the possibility of a \"financial risk shock\"\nfin\nt\n, which increases the range of realizations of the shocks (see, for instance, Christiano\net al. (2014)). The financial risk shock affects both entrepreneurs simultaneously.\nEntrepreneurs' net worth (NWe\nm,t\n) arises from two sources: the net value (NV e\nm,t\n) of\nthe project and transfers from households (we\nm\n). In order to prevent entrepreneurs from\naccumulating net worth indefinitely, which would make external funding unnecessary, we\nfollow BGG and assume that in each period entrepreneurs leave the market with a given\nprobability of 1 - pe and are exactly replaced by new entrepreneurs just endowed with\nhouseholds' transfers to keep the population of entrepreneurs stable. For the evolution of\nnet worth we obtain\n= peNV e\nm,t\n+ we\nm\nThe optimal bond contract for the lenders reveals that the lenders want to earn as\nmuch as they receive by investing in a risk-free asset. That is the reason why lenders'\nopportunity costs must be equal to the risk-free rate. Where the idiosyncratic shock\nexceeds the cut-off value, the lender receives the contractual interest payments. The\nconverse probability of the default probability at the cut-off value of the shocks yields the\nprobability of contractual payments. For the range of realizations of the shocks that are\nbelow the ex ante cut-off value e,ex ante\nm\n, the assets of the borrower are expected to be\n25Note that the realized rate of return enters Equation (17).\nliquidated in order to partly redeem the debt contract. Before collecting the remaining\nassets, the lender has to observe the state of the borrower. Information is asymmetrically\ndistributed, however. While the entrepreneur can always assess its situation, the financial\nintermediary cannot observe the state of the entrepreneur at no charge. As a consequence,\nthe creditor has to pay transaction costs, which lower its repayments in the case of a\ndefault. It is assumed that the transaction costs are proportional to the realizable assets.\nThese considerations are summarized in Equation (19)\n1 - F e,ex ante\n; e\nt\nZe\nLe\n^\ne,ex ante\nRk,e\nQe\nt\nKe\ndF (e; e\nt\n)\nt\n) Le\nwith rA\nt\n= Et\nrB,corp\nand rB\nt\n= rL\nt\n. While the current risk-free loan rate rL\nt\nenters the\nparticipation constraint for the type B entrepreneur, the expected (risk-free) bond return\nEt\nrB,corp\n, which is defined as\nrB,corp\nt\n= t\n\n\n\nB,corpQB,corp\nt\n+ icorp\n- B,e\nt\nQB,corp\nBcorp\nQB,corp\n\n\n\nbecomes relevant in intermediaries' participation constraint for the type A entrepreneurs.\nAs with government bonds, we allow for long-term bonds with a specific maturity struc-\nture, which is modeled according to Woodford (2001) with maturity parameter B,corp.26\nWhile QB,corp\nt\nis the price of the bond, icorp\ndenotes fixed coupon payments. Regarding\nthe loan contract of type B entrepreneurs, the loan rate is not state-contingent. For the\nbond rate, the same is, in principle, true although it only holds for expected terms. What\ncan be seen in Equation (20) is that, as long as the default is not unexpected, its costs\nare taken into account in bond pricing. Nevertheless, the contract is written before the\nproductivity shock on A is realized, i.e. before the capital return is known. As a con-\nsequence of the non-state contingent nature of the contracts, deviations of the realized\ncapital return from its expected value matter to debt servicing capacity (see Equation\n(17)) and, therefore, affect intermediaries' return. From this setting it follows that finan-\ncial intermediaries face ex post losses B,e\nt\nthat can cannot be completely diversified\nex ante (as is assumed in the original BGG setting). These ex post losses are defined as\nB,e\nt\n=\nF(e,ex-post\nt\n) - F(e\n) Ze\nLe\n+ 1 - \u00b5f,e\n\n\nKe\nQe\nG(e\n(Rk,e\nt\n)\n-Ke\nQe\nt\nG(e,ex-post\nt\n)\n\n\nwhich is similar to Benes and Kumhof (2011). Ex post losses can occur if the realization\nof the shock leaves the realized capital return below its expected value so that the risky\n26See K\u00fchl (2014) for the implications of introducing bonds with a maturity into the BGG approach.\ncontract rate is not sufficient to compensate the intermediaries for all defaults. The losses\ncan be split up into two parts: the additional losses, because the realized default rate\nF(e,ex post\nt\n) is above its ex ante value F(e,ex ante\nt\n) (upper line on the right-hand side in\nEquation (21)), and the reduced amount of realizable assets through defaults (lower line\non the right-hand side in Equation (21)).\nEach entrepreneur maximizes its expected profits from Equation (18) by choosing the\namount of capital and the cut-off point given the corresponding intermediaries' expected\nzero-profit conditions as presented in Equation (19).27\nIn an environment with a contract period of one period, the net value is equivalent\nto net earnings, which are simply the earnings net of the costs of the credit. Hence, we\nobtain for the aggregated net value\nNV e\nt\n=\nt\nt\nQe\nKe\nt\n-\n\nt\n) +\n\u00b5\n\u00b4\ne,ex post\ndF (; t\n) 1 + Rk,e\nt\nQe\nKe\nt\nQe\nKe\nt\n- NWe\nt\n\n Qe\nKe\nt\n- NWe\nt\n\n ,\nwhere we have made use of the aggregated version of Equation (18). In conjunction with\nEquation (18) and the omission of indexes, we obtain the aggregated law of motion for\nthe entrepreneurs' net worth. In order to be compensated ex ante for default costs, the\ncreditors add them to the risk-free rate as a fixed proportion (\u00b5e) of realizable assets.\nAfter processing the capital with the help of individual skill, the entrepreneurs decide\non capital utilization, which entails costs in the form of\n(ue\nm,t\n) =\nrk,e\nk,e\n(exp k,e ue\nm,t\nThe aggregate amount of physical capital distributed to the intermediate goods sector,\nafter the second stage is accomplished, is obtained by aggregating over the distribution\nof the productivity shock and over the continuum of entrepreneurs.\n^\n=\n^\n^\n\num,t\nKm,t\ndF () f(m)dm +\n^\n^\n\num,t\nKm,t\ndF () f(m)dm = ut\nKt\n.\nEquation (24) shows that shocks to entrepreneurs' skills do not matter for the economy\nas a whole because the idiosyncratic risk can be diversified perfectly and the utilization\nrate is identical across all entrepreneurs.\n27An important difference between the original BGG setting and our setting is that the intermediaries\nexpect zero profits in our model, while in the BGG model zero profits hold every period (see, for instance,\n2.6 Financial intermediaries\nMutual funds are introduced to proxy the capital market. This idea is lent on Bernanke\net al. (1999) and Christiano et al. (2014). Our mutual funds serve as intermediaries that\nchannel funds from banks, rent them out by buying bonds from type A entrepreneurs and\noperate on zero profits. Our main objective is to model the linkage between the issuance\nof bonds and the financing by banks. In a decentralized market structure, different banks\ncould earn different ex post returns (see Equation (15)) because some banks hold bonds\nissued by entrepreneurs that do not default, while some have purchased bonds from en-\ntrepreneurs that do. By introducing mutual funds, we easily circumvent this problem\nbecause we assume that mutual funds manage the market portfolio. Indeed, they are of\nno economic importance given the property of (expected) zero-profits as a by-product of\nentrepreneurs' optimizing problem, which we discussed in the previous section. Because\nof the non-state contingency we have introduced, ex post losses can occur that cannot\nbe diversified away. We simply assume that these losses are redistributed to the bond\nholders via a reduced pay-off.\nSince households cannot provide funds to the entrepreneurial sector directly, we introduce\na banking sector, which is basically lent on Gertler and Kiyotaki (2010) and Gertler\nand Karadi (2011). Our economy is populated by a continuum of lending banks n with\nn  [0, 1]. In addition to loans the lending banks can grant to type B entrepreneurs\ndirectly, they also buy (corporate) bonds issued by type A entrepreneurs.28 In addition,\neach lending bank buys government bonds. Hence, each n-th lending bank holds three\nassets and the total assets AB\nn,t\nevolves as\nAB\nn,t\n= Ln,t\n+ QB,corp\nt\nBcorp\nn,t\n+ QB,gov\nt\nBgov\nn,t\nFollowing the arguments outlined in the previous sections, the loan rate rL\nt\nis negotiated\nbefore the shocks are realized such that it becomes non-state contingent. As a result,\nex post defaults can occur, which must be borne by the lending bank. In the corporate\nbond market, unexpected losses materialize in the ex post period return rB,corp\nt\nas a result\nof unexpected changes in the price of the corporate bonds (see again Equation (20)).\nGovernment bonds have a return of rB,gov\nt\n. The return on total assets before losses on\nloans results as\nrA\nt\nAB\n+ 1 + rB,corp\nt\nQB,corp\nBcorp\nAB\n+ 1 + rB,gov\nt\nQB,gov\nBgov\nAB\nGoodfriend and McCallum (2007) argue that the production of loans can be associated\nwith costs that result from monitoring. Although monitoring costs are already taken into\n28Notice that they do not buy bonds directly from type A entrepreneurs. More precisely, they buy\nbonds from mutual funds which in turn hold bonds issued by type A entrepreneurs. For the sake of\nsimplicity, we argue that lending banks buy bonds from entrepreneurs but technically the funds are\nintermediated by mutual funds.\naccount through the BGG approach, giving loans to the non-financial sectors might be\nassociated with sales costs.29 Consequently, we attribute costs L\nn,t\nto the issuance of\nloans relative to bank's balance sheet\nL\nn,t\n=\nL\n1 - B,corp\nn,t\n- B,gov\nn,t\nwith B,corp\nn,t\n= QB,corp\nt\nBcorp\nn,t\nAB\nn,t\n, B,gov\nn,t\n= QB,gov\nt\nBgov\nn,t\nAB\nn,t\nand L is a scaling parameter. In the same\nvein, holdings of corporate bonds might entail costs which are similarly captured by\nB,corp\nn,t\n=\nB,corp\nB,corp\nn,t\nThis formulation is similar to Kirchner and van Wijnbergen (2012), who attribute costs\nto holdings of securities. However, we define the costs in shares and not in deviations from\na desired level.30 Looking at funding, the bank borrows from households at the rate rD\nt\nIn addition to debt, the lending bank can build up inside equity EI\nn,t\nby retaining\nearnings. Thus, the balance sheet constraint becomes\nLn,t\n+ QB,corp\nt\nBcorp\nn,t\n+ QB,gov\nt\nBgov\nn,t\n= EI\nn,t\n+ Dn,t\nTaking all costs together, the overall costs arise as n,t\n= L\nn,t\n+ B,corp\nn,t\n. Regarding\nthe costs the lending banks have to bear, we follow Kirchner and van Wijnbergen (2012)\nand express the costs in terms of inside equity. With this information at hand, we can\ndefine the law of motion for inside equity that is written in real terms, while financial\nassets are denominated in nominal terms\nEI\nn,t\nt\n+ 1 + rB,corp\nt\nQB,corp\nBcorp\nt\n+ 1 + rB,gov\nt\nQB,gov\nBgov\nt\nt\nEI\nt\n+ EI,gov\nn,t\n- n,t\n= RA\nt\nAB\nt\n- RD\nt\nEI\nt\n+ EI,gov\nn,t\n- n,t\nHere, we deviate from Gertler and Karadi (2011) who discuss real assets.32 The term\nEI,gov\nn,t\nin Equations (30) and (31) captures capital injections by a public agent, while\nn,t\ncomprises losses from the loan portfolio and costs for equity injections, i.e. t\n=\nA\nt\nEI,gov\n/t\n, where we assume that banks have to pay the risk-free rate for equity\ninjections. Equation (31) simplifies Equation (30) by summarizing all assets AB\nn,t\nand\nliabilities Dn,t\nin conjunction with the corresponding gross rates RA\nt\nand RD\nt\n.\nIn the setting described by Gertler and Kiyotaki (2010) or Gertler and Karadi (2011),\n29A similar argument is also taken into account by C\u00fardia and Woodford (2011).\n30This approach prevents corner solutions and preserves determinacy.\n31Because of the formulation of the bank, these loans comprise both deposits and bank bonds. From\nthis point of view, the interest rate is an \"average\" rate on bank's debt.\n32In this context, they consider real bonds which are completely hedged against inflation.\nthe lending banks maximize the present value of their net worth, i.e. the value of the\nbank Vn,t\n, i.e. the discounted sum of retained earnings (inside equity in our model). In\nour case, the bank managers would choose Ln,t\n, Bcorp\nn,t\n, Bgov\nn,t\n, and Dn,t\noptimally.\nVn,t\n= max\n{Ln,t,Bcorp\nn,t\n,Bgov\nn,t\n,Dn,t\n}\nEt\n\nEI\nAs explained in Section 2.1, a fraction sBM of household members becomes bank man-\nagers. While they operate a lending bank, they accumulate wealth by retaining earnings.\nHowever, it is not guaranteed that they will remain bank managers forever; the probabil-\nity of being a bank manager is pBM . Only when bank managers leave the lending bank do\nthey transfer the rest of their wealth back to the households. Thus, the term 1 - pBM\nin Equation (32) reflects this transfer, while t,t+1\nis the bank specific discount factor\nwhich is households' pricing kernel  t+1\nt\n.\nIn section 2.5, we have already described the agency problem between the real sector\nand the financial sector. In Gertler and Karadi (2011), this relationship is completely free\nfrom financial frictions. However, there are financial frictions between the banks and their\ncreditors in their model. We additionally adapt this approach and consequently introduce\ntwo different channels of financial frictions because of two-sided financial contracting: be-\ntween the real sector and the financial sector and between the banks and their creditors.33\nWith respect to the former, we utilize a costly state verification problem in the vein of\nBGG, as already outlined. In the latter case, we lean on Gertler and Kiyotaki (2010)\nand assume that bank managers can divert part of the bank's resources and redistribute\nthe money back to households rather than paying it back to creditors. Like Rannenberg\n(2013), we combine a BGG-type problem with a GK-type problem.34 An advantage of this\napproach is that we are able to investigate the different frictions separately by abstracting\nfrom a risky bank environment.35\nGK-type financial frictions aim at a moral hazard/costly enforcement problem between\nborrowers and lenders. The borrower, i.e. the bank, is not willing to meet its obligations\ncompletely in each period. If the borrower unilaterally reduces its pay-off and does not\ndischarge all payment obligations, the lender can initiate bankruptcy proceedings against\nthe borrower. However, the fraction IC of available funds that may have been diverted\ncannot be recovered because of high enforcement costs. Hence, the lenders only retrieve\nthe fraction 1 - IC of available funds. As a result, the lenders will only give funds to\nthe bank if the value of the bank is sufficient to guarantee the repayment of funds net of\ndiversion. Thus, the incentive constraint of the lenders becomes\nVn,t\nICAB\nn,t\nThe left-hand side of Equation (33) is net worth (discounted sum of expected inside equity)\nas defined in Equation (32), while the right-hand side comprises the amount of diversion.\n33This setting is basically similar to Hirakata et al. (2013), Meh and Moran (2010), Sandri and Valencia\n34Looking at the financial sector, the main difference between the model in Rannenberg (2013) and\nours is that we allow for the bank to have a more sophisticated balance sheet.\n35The treatment of risky banks would require either an insurance mechanism or the need to deal with\nbank runs.\nThus, Equation (32) is maximized subject to Equation (33).\nRegarding the optimization problem, we follow Kirchner and van Wijnbergen (2012)\nand assume that it can be divided into one main problem and one sub-problem. At the\nfirst level, the bank managers decide on total assets, while portfolio managers decide on\nthe composition of the assets at the second level.\nBank managers In order to solve the optimization problem at the first stage, we\nfollow Gertler and Kiyotaki (2010) and obtain an expression for the value function that\nis linear in quantities.\nVn,t\n= A\nt\nAB\nn,t\n- D\nt\nDn,t\n- IE\nt\nEI\nn,t\n+ OE,gov\nn,t\n- A\nn,t\n= (A\nt\n- D\nt\nn,t\n+ (D\nt\n- IE\nt\nn,t\n+ IE,gov\nn,t\n- A\nn,t\nAfter optimizing Equation (34) subject to Equation (33), we get the first order conditions\nAB\nn,t\n: (A\nt\n- D\nt\n) = IC\nt\nIC\nt\nand\nIC\nt\n: A\nt\n- D\nt\nAB\nn,t\n+ D\nt\n- IE\nt\nEI\nn,t\n+ IE,gov\nn,t\n- A\nn,t\nt\nAB\nn,t\nWith the help of the method of undetermined coefficients, we can deduce values for\nthe unknown parameters in Equation (34)\nA\nt\n= Et\nRA\nt\nD\nt\n= Et\nRD\nt\nIE\nt\n= Et\nn,t\nIE,gov\nn,t\n= Et\nEI,gov\nn,t\nIE,gov\nA\nn,t\n= Et\nn,t\nA\nwith\nt\n= 1 - pBM + pBM 1 + IC\nt\nD\nt\n- IE\nt\nand are able to find an economic interpretation for the first order conditions.36 Equation\n(37) is the expected discounted marginal return of one additional unit of assets, while\nEquation (38) represents the expected discounted marginal costs of one additional unit\nof external funds. Equation (39) gives the expected discounted marginal costs of holding\nentrepreneurial and government bonds. The variable IE,gov\nn,t\nin Equation (40) is the ex-\npected discounted gain from an additional unit of external capital injections conducted by\na government institution, i.e. the gain from the recapitalization of the bank. As explained\nabove, the bank can suffer losses from its holdings of assets and potentially has to pay for\nthe capital injections; the term A\nn,t\nin Equation (41) reflects these facts and represents\nthe expected discounted costs.\n36Derivations can be found in the appendix.\nConsequently, Equation (35) states that the net marginal profits on one additional\nunit of assets must be equal to the costs related to diversion. The variable IC\nt\nis the\nLagrange multiplier and signifies how much the incentive constraint binds. The second\nfirst order condition, as presented in Equation (36), says that the gain from extending the\nbalance sheet must be greater than or equal to the additional incentive to divert. It holds\nwith equality if the shadow price of the incentive constraint is positive.37 By combining\nboth first order conditions, total assets can be expressed as a function of inside equity\nby taking government's recapitalization and losses from the loan portfolio into account\nAB\nn,t\n= IE\nn,t\nEI\nn,t\n+ h\nn,t\n(IE,gov\nn,t\n- A\nn,t\nwith\nIE\nn,t\n=\nIC\nt\nD\nt\n- IE\nt\nA\nt\n- D\nt\nh\nn,t\n=\nIC\nt\nA\nt\n- F\nt\nAs opposed to Gertler and Karadi (2011), for instance, the variable IE\nn,t\nis not the\nleverage ratio in our model; rather it is a gross leverage ratio before taking government\ninterventions and losses into account.\nPortfolio managers After having determined total assets, portfolio managers de-\ncide on the composition of assets. To find the optimal values, the law of motion for inside\nequity can be rewritten with the help of the definitions outlined above.\nEI\n= RL\nt\n1 - B,corp\nn,t\n- B,gov\nn,t\nAB\nn,t\n+ E RB,corp\nB,corp\nn,t\nAB\nn,t\n+ E RB,gov\nB,gov\nn,t\nAB\nn,t\n- RD\nt\nAB\nn,t\n- n,t\nEI\nn,t\n+ EI,gov\nIn Equation (46), the value for inside equity available in period t+1 is expressed in terms\nof total assets and inside equity. Since portfolio managers have the same objective as bank\nmanagers, the optimization problem is aimed at maximizing inside equity. The difference\nis that bank managers evaluate the present and the future, from which the total asset\nposition results, while portfolio managers optimize each period given total assets. Thus,\nportfolio managers choose B,corp\nn,t\nand B,gov\nn,t\noptimally. From the maximization problem,\nwe obtain first order conditions that can be rewritten such that\nE RB,corp\n- RL\nt\nAB\nn,t\nEI\nn,t\n= C,corpB,corp\nn,t\n- C,LL\nn,t\nand\nRL\nt\n- E RB,gov\nAB\nn,t\nEI\nn,t\n= C,LL\nn,t\n37See, for an economic interpretation, Kirchner and van Wijnbergen (2012), for example.\narise. From Equation (47) it is clear that there is a positive relationship between the\nspread between the expected return of corporate bonds and the loan rate and the share of\ncorporate bonds corrected by the share of loans. All else being equal, an increase in the\nspread between the expected rate of return on corporate bonds and the loan rate raises\nthe share of corporate bonds in banks' assets. A similar relationship exists for the spread\nbetween the loan rate and the expected return on government bonds. If loans earn more\nmoney than government bonds per unit of leverage, the loan position is increased.\nAggregation By starting with the link between inside equity and the sum of assets\n(Equation (43)), we can rewrite this expression to obtain\nAB\nn,t\nEI\nn,t\n=\nD\nt\n- IE\nt\nIC - IE,gov\nn,t\nAB\nn,t\n+ A\nn,t\nAB\nn,t\n- (A\nt\n- D\nt\n)\n= IE\nn,t\nAs one can see in Equation (49), the leverage ratio IE\nn,t\nis equal to all individuals if the\nterms IE,gov\nn,t\nAB\nn,t\nand A\nn,t\nAB\nn,t\nare identical to all lending banks. One necessary condition for this\nto hold is that the Lagrangian multiplier for the enforcement constraint is identical across\nall individuals which is the case as long as the assets can be completely diverted to the\nsame extent across individuals, as one can see in Equation (35). Departing from Equations\n(40) and (41), it is easy to show by forward iteration and the validity of the transversality\ncondition that the two terms are (nearly) identical to all individuals in the neighborhood\nof the steady state, i.e. as long as the sum of assets does not vary to much.38 Thus, we\ncan drop the indexes in Equation (49).\nKnowing that the leverage ratio AB\nt\nEI\nt\nis identical to all lending banks, we see from the\nfirst order conditions resulting from portfolio managers' maximization problem that the\nshare of loans depends solely on the spread between the loan rate and the expected return\non government bonds and is consequently identical to all individuals. Knowing the share\nof loans in banks' portfolio, it can be shown with the help of Equation (47) that the\nshare of corporate bonds is also free from individual characteristics. Hence, the portfolio\ncomposition is the same across all lending banks. Thus, aggregation of quantities across\nthe individuals can simply be conducted by integration.\nFor the sum of assets we get AB\nt\n=\n\u00b4\nAB\nn,t\ndn = IE\nt\n\u00b4\nEI\nn,t\ndn = IE\nt\nEI\nt\nand for each\nasset class Lt\n=\n\u00b4\nLn,t\ndn = L\nt\nIE\nt\nEI\nt\n, QB,corp\nt\nBcorp\nt\n=\n\u00b4\nQB,corp\nt\nBcorp\nn,t\ndn = B,corp\nt\nIE\nt\nEI\nt\n,\nand QB,gov\nt\nBgov\nt\n=\n\u00b4\nQB,gov\nt\nBgov\nn,t\ndn = B,gov\nt\nIE\nt\nEI\nt\nrespectively. The aggregation of lia-\nbilities works similarly and the aggregate amount of external finance evolves as Dt\n=\nIE\nt\n\u00b4\nEI\nn,t\ndn.\nRegarding inside equity, the aggregate amount can be split up. Since a fraction of bank\nmanagers resign, bank managers continue to operate a lending bank with probability pBM .\nWhile the exiting bank managers' inside equity is no longer available, the remaining inside\nequity is a fraction of aggregate inside equity\nEI,old\nt\n= pBM EI\nt\n.\n38This is a conventional assumption particularly in models that work with collateral constraints, see\nNew bank managers fill the gap created by the exit of old bank managers and enter the\nmarket in order to start operating a lending bank. From their households they obtain an\nendowment with which inside equity is built up\nEI,new\nt\nt\nAB\nt\nthat is a fraction  of assets. Consequently, aggregate inside equity is the sum of both\ncomponents\nEt\n= EI,old\nt\n+ EI,new\nt\nand the law of motion for aggregate net worth becomes\nEI\nt\n= pBM + BM RL\nt\n+ RB,corp\nt\nQB,corp\nBcorp\nt\n+ RB,gov\nt\nQB,gov\nBgov\nt\n- pBM RD\nt\n- EI,gov\nt\n+ B\nt\n.\nHaving defined the private sector, we come to the description of the public sector, which\nconsists of a fiscal agent, the central bank, and an intervention authority. The author-\nities of the public sector do not face an optimization problem. To finance government\nexpenditures Gt\n, the fiscal authority uses internal funds, i.e. from tax revenues (Tt\n) and\nprofits received from the intervention authority PIA\nt\n, and external funds, i.e. from\nthe issuance of short-term Bshort,gov\nt\nand long-term government bonds Bgov\nt\nin the capital\nmarket traded at price QB,gov\nt\n. Short-term government bonds are in zero net supply. The\nbudget constraint of the fiscal agent is given in Equation (50).\nGt\n+ 1 + rB,gov\nt\nQB,gov\nBgov\nt\n+ Tt\n+ QB,gov\nt\nBgov\nt\nTax revenues stem from labor income such that we have Tt\n= w\nt\nwt\nNt\nwith w\nt\nas the\ntax rate. Our fiscal agent adjusts the tax rate on labor income in order to stabilize the\nlevel of real government debt, where the term BG is a positive number which reflects the\nfact that governments' insolvency is ruled out by conducting a passive fiscal policy (see,\nfor example, Leeper, 1991). The tax rule is presented in Equation (51).\nw\nt\n- w = w w\n- w + (1 - w) BG QB,gov\nBgov\n- QB,gov\ns\nBgov\ns\nFurthermore, the fiscal agent aims to effect smooth changes in the tax rate (with au-\ntoregressive parameter w). To complete the fiscal authority, we specify government\nexpenditures as a fixed proportion of output.\nThe central bank conducts monetary policy by controlling the policy rate iPR\nt\npurpose, it obeys a Taylor (1993)-type monetary policy rule, the objective of which is to\nset the policy rate according to\nt\nsmooth\n\n(1-smooth) Yt\ny(1-smooth)\ni\nt\n.\nAs can be seen in Equation (52), the central bank applies interest rate smoothing,\nwith smoothing parameter smooth. Since the economy possesses a non-zero steady state\nrate of inflation, the central bank's main interest lies in keeping the distance between the\nrate of inflation and the target rate of inflation () close to zero. In addition, the last\nperiod's real output growth also affects the policy rate. The term  is the weight given\nto inflation and y to output growth. Furthermore, the term i\nt\nrepresents an unexpected\nmonetary policy shock.\nIn order to investigate crisis resolution policies, we introduce an intervention authority\nthat is assigned to the public sector. It has full credibility and is able to issue risk-less\nshort-term debt. The reason why we introduce an intervention authority is that we want\nto sever the direct link to taxes on the one hand and do not want to assign the policies\nsolely to the central bank on the other hand.40 In the end, the balance sheet of the\nintervention authority feeds into the public sector's balance sheet.\nRegarding crisis resolution policies, we allow the intervention authority to conduct\noutright purchases of corporate bonds Bcorp,IA\nt\nand of government bonds Bgov,IA\nt\n. As\ninterventions rules, we have\nBcorp,IA\nt\n= corp,IA xcorp\nt-l\nfor corporate bonds and\nBcorp,IA\nt\n= gov,IA xgov\nt-l\nfor government bonds, respectively. A similar rule can also be established for the recapi-\ntalization of the bank\nt\nt-l\nThe terms corp,IA, gov,IA, and EI,IA reflect sensitivity parameters and xt\ndenotes a stress\nindicator for the corresponding asset.\n39The policy rate is the risk-free rate.\n40Although outright asset purchases are usually conducted by central banks, recapitalization of banks\nis sometimes undertaken by authorities with government guarantees. The latter are endowed with their\nown resources and operate in the capital market on their own. Profits can be redistributed to the\nfiscal authority or, in appropriate circumstances, losses are balanced by the fiscal authority. Smets and\nTrabandt (2012) also sever the link between central bank profits and the government. In their model,\ntransfers from the central bank to the government depend on a rule which is directed to central bank's\nholdings of government bonds. From this point of view, our approach is quite similar to theirs.\nWith the help of this knowledge, we can formulate the resource constraint of the\nintervention authority which is given in Equation (56)\nQB,corp\nt\nBcorp,IA\nt\n+ QB,gov\nt\nBgov,IA\nt\nt\nt\nThe profits arise as the difference in the returns and the costs\nPIA\nt\n= rB,gov\nt\nQB,gov\nBgov,IA\nt\n+ rB,corp\nt\nQB,corp\nBcorp,IA\nt\nt\nBIA\nt\n.\nIn the following equation, we present the market clearing condition for our economy\nYt\n= IA\nt\n+ IB\nt\n+ Ct\n+ Gt\n+ KA\nA\nt\n+ B\nt\nKB\n+ A\nt\n+ B\nt\n+ KA\nQA\nt\nt\n) \u00b5f,A\nt\n+ KB\nQB\nt\nt\n) \u00b5f,B\nt\n.\nInvestment spending by type A and type B entrepreneurs constitutes aggregate invest-\nment IA\nt\nt\n. Since changes in the stock of capital are related to costs, the resources spent\nin both sectors are expressed in KA\nA\nt\n+ B\nt\nKB\n+ A\nt\n+ B\nt\n. In addition, monitoring\ntype A and B entrepreneurs by the financial intermediaries absorbs resources, which is\nembodied in the second line of Equation (57). The market for physical capital clears by\nequating capital supply and capital demand Ke\nt\n= Ke\nt\n.\nIn terms of asset holdings, a continuum of households meets a continuum of lending\nbanks. The market for corporate bonds clears by introducing mutual funds in the in-\ntermediation process, which hold the market portfolio,\n\u00b4\nBcorp\nn,t\ndn + Bcorp,IA\nt\n= Bcorp,B\nt\n+\nBcorp,IA\nt\n=\n\u00b4\nBcorp\nm,t\ndm, where Bcorp,B\nt\ndenotes aggregate holdings of banks. In the market\nfor loans, it is also assumed that each lending bank holds the market portfolio of loans.41\nThe market clearing condition results as\n\u00b4\nLn,t\ndn =\n\u00b4\ndm. Regarding the asset mar-\nket for government bonds, the demand for assets resulting from the continuum of house-\nholds and banks equals the supply of government bonds,\n\u00b4\nBgov\nh,t\ndh+\n\u00b4\nBgov\nn,t\ndn+Bgov,IA\nt\n=\nBgov,H\nt\n+Bgov,B\nt\n+Bgov,IA\nt\n= Bgov\nt\n. Accordingly, the market for the intervention authority's\nbonds clears,\n\u00b4\nBIA\nh,t\ndh = BIA\nt\n. The deposit rate rD\nt\nis linked to the policy rate.\n3 Calibration and steady state\nIn this section, we discuss the parameterization of the model and the steady state values.\nOur calibration is chosen to reflect the euro area as a whole. The parameterization for the\nreal and the policy sector can be found in Table 1, while Table 2 provides the values for the\nfinancial sector. Table 3 presents the steady state values of the model (in the right-hand\ncolumn) in conjunction with the average data for the euro area for the corresponding\nvariable. The entire model is calibrated quarterly.\n41For technical reasons, as for corporate bonds, we need an aggregator that guarantees the same pay-off\nper unit of loans.\nMost of the parameters concerning the standard block in our DNK model are based\non the estimates for the euro area obtained by Smets and Wouters (2003), Christoffel,\nCoenen, and Warne (2008), and Amisano and Tristani (2010). We set the inverse Frisch\nelasticity, , to 2.5. The curvature on utility of consumption, , is set to 1.4 and the\nparameter for habit formation in consumption, hC, has the value of 0.6. We assume\nthat households are able to renegotiate their wage with a probability of 0.24, from which\nfollows that w is 0.76. Lagged inflation enters with a weight (w) of 0.75 in the indexation\nrule for non-optimizing wages. All these parameter values stem from Smets and Wouters\n(2003). The wage elasticity in the labor aggregator, w, equals 6 and is similar to Gerali,\nNeri, Sessa, and Signoretti (2010). The steady state value for hours worked is 0.33 of the\ntotal hours available.\nTable 1: Calibration of parameters - real and policy sector\nDescription Symbol Value\nPanel A: Household Sector\nInverse of Frisch elasticity of goods' production labor  2.5\nCurvature on utility of consumption  1.4\nProbability for non-reoptimization of wages w 0.76\nWage elasticity in labor aggregator w 5\nShare of lagged inflation in indexation rule for wages w 0.75\nSteady state labor input in goods' production Ns\nMaturity parameter for corporate bonds B 0.971\nMaturity parameter for government bonds B,gov 0.967\nPanel B: Intermediate and Final Goods' Producing Sectors\nCapital share in intermediate goods' production  0.3\nShare of type A entrepreneurs' capital ws 0.07\nDepreciation rate - type A and type B entrepreneurs A = B 0.025\nPrice elasticity in final goods' production  6.5\nProbability for non-adjusting of prices - Calvo pricing  0.9\nInvestment adjustment costs  6.9\nCapital utilization adjustment costs  0.15\nShare of lagged inflation in indexation rule for prices  0.45\nPanel C: Monetary and fiscal policy\nTaylor rule - interest smoothing i\nTaylor rule - inflation \nTaylor rule - output growth y\nPolicy rate, free-risk rate, annualized rCB, i 3.7 %\nSteady state rate of inflation, annualized s\nSensitivity parameter in tax rule BG 0.007\nShare of government expenditures on steady state output G/Y 0.2\nThe capital share in production, , is calibrated to 0.3, which is standard. Since\nwe have introduced two different types of capital for use in production, we need the\ncorresponding weights. Through the weight, ws, the relative share of loans to bonds is\ndetermined accordingly. To match the properties of the euro area in the steady state\n(loan-to-bond ratio: 9.9), we set ws to 0.07 so that the steady state loan-to-bond ratio\nin our model becomes 9.76.42 Concerning the rate of depreciation, , we attribute to both\n42The data reflect the sector of non-financial corporations and stem from the integrated euro area\nsectors the conventional value of 0.025. For our parameter for adjustment costs in the\ncapital stock, we once again make use of the estimate in Smets and Wouters (2003). The\nterm  has the value of 6.9 in both sectors. Our parameter for the costs resulting from\nvariations in the capital utilization, , is set to 0.15 in both sectors, which is between the\nvalues provided by Smets and Wouters (2003) and Christoffel et al. (2008). In line with\nboth references, we base the probability that goods producers cannot reoptimize their\nprices, , on their estimate of 0.9. Using the same source, we set the share of lagged\ninflation in the indexation rule for prices, , to 0.45. Following the estimates of Amisano\nand Tristani (2010), the price elasticity in final goods production, , has the value of\n6.5, which is between the values for their non-linear model (6.373) and for their linear\nmodel (6.914). As a result of our calibration exercise, the value of the scaling parameter\nfor disutility of labor in households' utility,  , as well as the fixed costs in intermediate\ngoods production, , are pinned down by the steady state.\nTable 2: Calibration of parameters - financial sector\nDescription Symbol Value\nPanel A: type A entrepreneurs\nShare of realized profits lost in case of default due to monitoring \u00b5A,f 0.12\nVariance of idiosyncratic productivity parameter A\ns\nBusiness failure rate in steady state F(A\ns\nSurvival probability of entrepreneurs pA,f\ns\nReturn on corporate bonds in the steady state, annualized rB 3.95%\nPanel B: type B entrepreneurs\nShare of realized profits lost in case of default due to monitoring \u00b5B,f 0.22\nVariance of idiosyncratic productivity parameter B\ns\nBusiness failure rate in steady state F(B\ns\nSurvival probability of entrepreneurs pB,f\ns\nLoan rate in the steady state, annualized rL 4.02%\nPanel C: Banking sector\nSurvival rate of bank managers psp 0.975\nEquity-to-total-assets ratio IE 6\nAfter having calibrated the intermediate and final goods producing sector, we turn to\nthe entrepreneurs. Since we have two different sectors, we decide to attribute different\nrisk parameters to them. As in BGG, we assume that the share of realized profits lost in\nthe case of a default is 0.12 for the type A entrepreneurs, which is a conventional assump-\ntion (see, for example, Christiano, Motto, and Rostagno, 2003; Gertler, Gilchrist, and\nNatalucci, 2007). For the type B entrepreneurs, we follow the argument that monitoring\nis more costly compared to market financing which feeds into a value for \u00b5B of 0.22. This\nis quite close to the value that is estimated for the euro area by von Heideken (2009) but\nguarantees that the transfer from households to entrepreneurs is a positive number. To\nset the business failure rate F(), we take an average value of bankruptcy rates in the\neuro area of 0.008.43 We use this value for both sectors. By contrast, we set two different\nvariances for the log of the idiosyncratic productivity variable, log(); for the type A\naccounts.\n43The data stem from different publications by the company Creditreform.\nentrepreneurial sector it is 0.05 and 0.09 for the type B entrepreneurs. With these values\nwe are very close to the euro area's value in Christiano, Motto, and Rostagno (2010). In\nline with the latter, we assume that the survival probability of entrepreneurs, pf , is 0.978\nin both sectors.\nWith this calibration we get a debt-to-output ratio in the real economy of 3.59, which\nis very close to the euro area figure (3.58). The same is true of the sectoral ratios. While\nthe loan-to-output ratio in the steady state of our model is 3.25, it is 3.12 in the euro\narea. Regarding the (corporate) bonds-to-output ratio, we observe a ratio of 0.31 for the\neuro area, whereas our model yields 0.33 in the steady state. Our debt-to-equity ratio\n(loans plus bonds to both types of entrepreneurs' net worth) amounts to 0.83, which is\nslightly higher than the historical average value, which equals 0.7 for the euro area.44\nIn our model, we allow for a specific maturity structure for corporate bonds. The\naverage maturity of corporate bonds in the euro area between 1999 and 2007 is about\n6.5 years.45 As a consequence, we set the parameter B to a value of 0.971, which yields\nan average maturity of 6.5 years. Our model is able to distinguish between risky and\nrisk-free spreads.46 The spread between the risk-free bond rate and the risk-free rate can\nbe interpreted as the difference in the yields on corporate bonds with the highest cred-\nitworthiness, those of AAA rated issuers, and government bonds. Among other factors,\nliquidity premiums can be seen as driving this spread (Longstaff, Mithal, and Neis, 2005).\nAlthough we do not explicitly incorporate liquidity issues in our model, liquidity premi-\nums might result from limits to arbitrage. Limits to arbitrage arise in our model because\nof portfolio costs. From this point of view, we calibrate the spread between the risk-free\nbond rate and the risk-free rate according to the difference between yields on AAA rated\ncorporate bonds in the euro area and German government bonds with a maturity of 5 to\nThe calibration of the risk-free loan rate rL is more difficult because credit conditions\nare reported without classifying creditworthiness. Furthermore, the period for which\nconditions are fixed cannot be directly compared to the maturity. As a solution, we\ncompute the volume-weighted loan rate based on the annualized rates agreed for new\nbusinesses as reported in the ECB's MIR statistics, and establish the spread to the risk\nand maturity weighted yield of non-financial corporations. In the pre-crisis period, we\nobtain a value of roughly 7 basis points, which we extrapolate by adding it to the risk-free\nbond rate to obtain the risk-free loan rate.48\nThe calibration of the risk-free rates together with the calibration of the risk param-\neters in the BGG partly pin down the steady state values for the remaining spreads.\n44By using similar data, De Fiore and Uhlig (2011) report a value of 0.64, which is slightly below our\nhistorical values because we also include more recent data.\nmember countries. The maturities are weighted by the amount issued. Similar values are reported in\n46Recall that the asset specific risk-free rates deviate from the risk-free rate because of limits to ar-\nbitrage. Hence, the asset specific risk-free rates exceed the risk-free rate in the steady state because of\nportfolio costs for both the lending banks and households.\n47AAA rated bonds nevertheless convey a default risk. However, we believe that our proceeding is an\nadequate way to calibrate the model. Yields on German government bonds are taken because they have\na high degree of liquidity and the highest credit rating throughout the period.\n48For the euro area, De Fiore and Uhlig (2011) report bond spreads that exceed loan spreads. Our\ncalculations of spreads with different maturities and risk attitudes do not support their findings.\nTable 3: Steady state values\nEMU Model\nPanel A: Real sector\nPanel B: Banks\nLoans relative to credits to non-fin. sector L/ L + QB,corpBcorp 0.923 0.91\nPanel C: Entrepreneurs\nCost of external finance, contractual rate,\nannualized\n1) ECB national accounts. 2) Integrated Euro Area Accounts, households. 3) Balance sheet items.

If three values are reported in the columns, the first entry relates to the aggregate while the second shows the\nnumber for large entrepreneurs and the third for type B entrepreneurs. If two values are given, the first is the number for large\nentrepreneurs and the second for type B entrepreneurs. Total assets as implied by the model are denoted by AB.\nFollowing Bernanke et al. (1999), the credit spread can be defined as the difference be-\ntween the risky-bond rate ZA and the risk-free bond rate. Our calibration exercise yields\na value of 0.59, which is equal to the spread between the yields of BBB and AAA rated\ncorporate bonds with a maturity of 5 to 7 years. Analogously, the spread between yields\non BBB rated corporate bonds and German government bonds with a maturity of 5 to 7\nyears, which is 0.84, corresponds to the spread of the pre-crisis period.\nBased upon the OECD central government debt statistics, the average maturity of\ngovernment bonds in the euro area is slightly below 6 years. Consequently, we set the\nparameter B,gov, which controls the maturity in our model, to 0.967. In line with this\nmaturity, we calibrate the quarterly discount factor of households, , to 0.9953, which\ncorresponds to an annual risk-free rate of 3.7%. The latter is the average yield on German\ngovernment bonds in the pre-crisis period. In setting the survival rate of bank managers\noperating a lending bank we depart slightly from Gertler and Karadi (2011) and assume\nthat bankers operate a bank for 10 years and exit thereafter, i.e. the survival rate is 0.975.\nBased again on banks' aggregate balance sheet, 13% of banks' total assets are allotted\nto government bonds. The leverage ratio is set to 6, which corresponds to the value in\nSumming up, our calibrated values are mostly in line with historical averages for the\neuro area. However, the size of the banking system relative to output in our model is well\nbelow the reality. While the ratio of total assets to GDP is 12 (or approximately 3 on an\nannual basis) in the euro area, the corresponding number in our model is 4.12 (or 1.03 on\nan annual basis). This remarkable difference might result from the fact that total assets\nin our model are determined by the calibration exercise regarding the entrepreneurs. We\nhave therefore neglected several assets on banks' balance sheets. Nevertheless, the values\nfor the steady state of the real sector and some of those for the financial sector fit quite\nwell.\nNext, we discuss the policy parameters. Our monetary authority puts a weight of\n1.7 on the inflation objective, \n, and a weight of 0.1 on changes in real production,\ny\n. The autoregressive parameter in the Taylor rule, i\n, is 0.8. Our economy exhibits\na non-zero steady state rate of inflation, s\n, of 0.45 per cent on a quarterly base, which\nresults in an annual value of 1.8 per cent and is close to but below the ECB's target rate.\nGovernment's indebtedness is set to 70% of GDP, from which a tax rate in the steady\nstate of 0.29 results. Regarding the tax rate, the fiscal agent reacts with a sensitivity of\n0.01 (BG) to changes in government debt.49 This value guarantees fiscal solvency and it\nis set to the lower bound at which the model becomes unstable.\nTable 4: Second moments of central variables\nEMU Model\nPanel A: Standard deviations\nPanel B: Correlations\n1) ECB national accounts. 2) Balance sheet items. ECB. Averages for the EMU are calculated for the period from Q1 1999 to Q4 2007.\nBefore we complete the description of the calibration exercise and the steady state\nvalues, we present selected second moments for key variables by activating a monetary\npolicy, a technology shock, and an aggregate risk shock. The standard deviation of the\nshock, we choose a standard deviation of 0.041 which stems from Christiano et al. (2014).\nThe simulated standard deviation of annual output growth in our model matches the\neuro area average from 1999 to 2007, while the standard deviation for investment growth\nwith a value of 3.32 only differs slightly from the euro area's average (3.14). Regarding\nthe correlation coefficient between output growth and investment growth, we are close\nto its historical average. The same is also true of the correlation between annual output\ngrowth and the rate of inflation. A further central variable in our model is banks' leverage\nby our model is quite far away from this number; however, it is positive in contrast to\nthe Gertler and Karadi (2011) setting. Although the correlation coefficient between the\nleverage ratio and output growth implied by our model deviates from its historical average,\nits sign corresponds with reality.\nOverall, our model is very good at replicating some features of real data.\n49Following Leeper (1991), monetary policy is active, while fiscal policy takes a passive stance.\n4 Evaluating policy measures for mitigating a financial\ncrisis\nIn this section, we evaluate policy measures that are aimed at mitigating financial stress,\nin other words we discuss outright purchases of assets and capital injections into the\nbanking sector. Concretely, we relate the amount of purchases or of equity injections to\nthe magnitude of financial stress. Before turning to the evaluation, we will discuss sources\nof financial stress because our model is able to distinguish between two different origins.\n4.1 Simulating financial stress\nOur first financial shock is fundamentally similar to the capital quality shock in Gertler\nand Karadi (2011).50 We draw on the \"risk shock\" stemming from the BGG part of\nthe model, which is aimed at the variance of entrepreneurs' productivity shock e\nt\n(see\nChristiano et al., 2014, for example). Hence, we increase entrepreneurial risk, which\nraises bankruptcies. From this point of view, it is a shock that stems from the real\nsector, namely the entrepreneurial sector, and impacts on the financing conditions of non-\nfinancial enterprises. Because of the setup, the shock can be seen as financial stress in\na perfectly diversified economy. Defaults are reflected in monitoring costs, which drives\nborrowing costs upwards; however, lenders' investment decisions depend solely on risk-free\nrates because risk can be diversified completely. Christiano et al. (2014) see this shock as\nbeing very important for the business cycle.\nTo obtain our second financial shock, we adapt the idea behind the capital quality\nshock to induce stress into the banking sector. However, we aim to focus on developments\nthat originate in the banking sector and then spill over to the real sector rather than\noccurring simultaneously in both sectors. To this end, we induce a shock on banks'\nreturns (Equation 26),\nrA\nt\nAB\n+ 1 + rB,corp\nt\nQB,corp\nBcorp\nAB\n+ 1 + rB,gov\nt\nQB,gov\nBgov\nAB\n\u00d7 exp(shockrA\nt\n),\nwhereas shockrA\nt\n= rAshockrA\n+ rA\nt\nwith rA as an autoregressive parameter and the\ndisturbance rA\nt\n. The shock drives the return on assets downwards and affects banks'\nprofits directly. From this point of view, the shock can be interpreted as losses from an\nundiversified portfolio because creditors can recover fewer assets. In terms of interpre-\ntation, it comes close to a pure loan supply shock (Peek, Rosengren, and Tootell, 2003;\nIn order to highlight the differences in the results of the two sources of financial stress,\nwe compare the dynamics of relevant variables in response to these shocks. In doing so,\nwe calibrate the return shock in such a way that investment behaves identically during the\n50Regarding the simulation of a financial crisis, we depart from Gertler and Kiyotaki (2010) or Gertler\nand Karadi (2011). In their models, financial stress is induced by shocking the quality of capital, which\nhas two consequences: it directly reduces the value of banks' assets and as a consequence their net worth,\nand it causes production to drop (with further consequences for the real economy and, therefore, for\nbanks' balance sheets).\nFigure 1: Effects of a shock on bankers' profits (black solid) and on entrepreneurial risk\n(blue dashed)\nOutput\n%  from ss\nConsumption\n%  from ss\nInflation\nAnnualized\nPP  from ss\nInvestments\n%  from ss\nInvestments (corp. bond sector)\n%  from ss\nInvestments (loan sector)\n%  from ss\nRisk-free spread (loans)\nAnnualized\nBP  from ss\nRisk-free spread (corp. bonds)\nAnnualized\nBP  from ss\nRisk-free rate\nAnnualized\nBP  from ss\nCredit spread (loan sector)\nAnnualized\nBP  from ss\nCredit spread (corp. bond sector)\nAnnualized\nBP  from ss\nCredit premium\nAnnualized\nBP  from ss\nEntrepr. net worth (loan sector)\n%  from ss\nEntrepr. net worth (corp. bond sector)\n%  from ss\nLeverage Ratio Bank\n from ss\nBank-specific Shock Entrepreneurial Risk Shock\nNote: The risk-free spread is defined as the difference between the asset specific risk-free return and the policy rate (re\nt\n- it),\nwhile the credit spread is the difference between the expected return on capital and the corresponding asset specific risk-free\nrate E Rk,e\n- re\nt\n. The credit premium is the spread between the expected return on capital and the policy rate of the\ntwo capital-producing sectors weighted by the share of sector-specific capital in overall capital E Rk\n- it .\nfirst year after the shock and achieves the same minimum value, which is then roughly also\ntrue of output. This is happening while the aggregate credit premium responds identically\nin both cases. As can be seen in Figure 1, both shocks cause a recession, mainly driven\nby a drop in investment which coincides with a lower rate of inflation. The bank profit\nshock is given by the solid black lines and the dynamics resulting from the risk shock are\ngiven by the dashed blue lines. A first obvious result is that the effect of the profit shock\non the real economy is more persistent than that of the risk shock, although the response\nof investment in the first year is the same.\nA major difference occurs with respect to interest rate spreads, i.e. risk-free spreads\nas the difference between the asset specific risk-free rate and the policy rate, and credit\nspreads as the difference between the expected return on capital and the asset specific\nrisk-free rate. While both risk-free spreads rise after the risk shock, credit spreads remain\nvirtually constant (with a slight tendency to decrease in the corporate bond sector) after\nthe profit shock. Here, the different nature of the shocks is evident. Since the profit\nshock depresses banks' equity position, lending to the non-financial sector shrinks and\nan excess demand for credit emerges. The rise in risk-free rates, which is even stronger\nthan the increase in the policy rate, contributes to a fall in investment. As a result,\nthe profit shock raises mainly the risk-free spreads rather than credit spreads. For the\nrisk shock, the situation is different. Entrepreneurial risk increases, which is why credit\nspreads rise predominantly. The fact that the pattern for premiums is similar in both\ncases is because entrepreneurs reduce their demand for capital, which causes the price of\ncapital to drop. A lower capital price reduces entrepreneurs' net worth. However, the\naggregate credit premium (the capital weighted spreads between the expected returns on\ncapital and the risk-free rate), which includes both components, behave similarly. An\nimportant distinction arises regarding banks' leverage ratio. While the leverage ratio falls\nfor the risk shock, it increases for the profit shock on impact.\nComparing the two different financial shocks, we see that the combination of financial\nfrictions between non-financial corporations and financial intermediaries with financial\nfrictions between financial intermediaries, namely banks, and their creditors produces\ndifferent dynamics in terms of spreads. Our modelling approach regarding the combination\nof the BGG framework with the GK framework is appealing since we are able to compare\na financial shock in a completely diversified economy (risk shock) with a financial shock\nin an economy in which the banking sector is not working efficiently (profit shock) and\ncan evaluate the driving forces. This allows us to scrutinize the adequacy of our policy\nmeasures, which we do in the next section.\n4.2 Policy instruments\nDuring the financial crisis, various financial assistance programs were introduced to pre-\nvent the economy from slowing down and to support the recovery. On the one hand,\nassets were purchased outright. The ideas behind asset purchase programs can be mani-\nfold (see, for example, Brett and Neely, 2013). During the financial crisis, some segments\nof the financial market were malfunctioning; extraordinary price dispersion could not be\nremoved by market forces. Purchase programs were therefore intended to remove these\nobstacles. Outright purchases by governments have the same fundamental objective as\npurchases of private assets, but also aim at reducing borrowing costs by influencing the\nbenchmark risk-free rate. Where the policy rate set by central banks reaches the zero\nlower bound, asset purchases can therefore be used to influence longer-term borrowing\nconditions. In general, a necessary condition for asset purchases to be effective is that\nthe Wallace Irrelevance proposition of full arbitrage does not hold, i.e. limits to arbitrage\ngertsson and Woodford, 2003). Hence, the main channel by which asset purchases work\nis by influencing the relative price of assets (Andr\u00e9s, L\u00f3pez-Salido, and Nelson, 2004).\nLimits to arbitrage also exist for the assets under consideration in our model, i.e. cor-\nporate and government bonds.51 However, we concentrate only on those cases in which\nunconventional measures can be used to mitigate tensions on the financial market and do\nnot treat the case of an instrument in a zero-lower-bound environment. As known from\nthe previous section, the policy rate is reduced as a response to the drop in inflation.\nFrom this point of view, our policy measures constitute additional policy tools.\n51Limits to arbitrage are introduced in our model by allowing for segmented capital markets. Because\nof transaction costs, portfolio adjustment or portfolio costs, and financial frictions in the banking sector,\nFigure 2: Purchases of government bonds and of corporate bonds as a response to an\nentrepreneurial risk shock\nOutput\n%  from ss\nInflation\nAnnualized\nPP  from ss\nInvestments\n%  from ss\nConsumption\n%  from ss\nCredit spread (aggregate)\nAnnualized\nBP  from ss\nRisk-free spread (aggregate)\nAnnualized\nBP  from ss\nCredit premium (aggregate)\nAnnualized\nBP  from ss\nInside equity bank\n%  from ss\nEntrepr. net worth\n%  from ss\nPrice gov. bonds\n%  from ss\nPrice corp. bonds\n%  from ss\nLeverage ratio (banks)\n from ss\nNo Policy Corp.

The aggregate credit premium is the capital-weighted average of the spread between the return\non capital and the policy rate in the two sectors. Entrepreneurial net worth is the capital-weighted entrepreneurial net\nworth of the two sectors.\nIn order to relate asset purchases to financial conditions, as done by Gertler and\nKaradi (2011), for instance, we draw on the policy rules as presented in Equations (53)\nand (54), which link the volume of purchases to a specific crisis indicator. Usually the\ncredit spread, as defined by the difference between the return on capital and the risk-\nfree rate, is a reliable crisis indicator. However, our model is rich in different sorts of\ncrisis indicators. To calculate the above-mentioned credit spread, we have two options:\nto calculate it with the asset specific risk-free rate (as done in Figure 1) or with the help\nof the policy rate. Alternatively, we could use the external finance premium as defined\nby Bernanke et al. (1999) or the spread between the risky rates (Ze\nt\n) and a risk-free rate.\nSince our model features two different sources of financial frictions, the spread between\nthe expected rate of capital and the policy rate comprises distortions from both frictions.\nHowever, we need to choose the sector because every indicator appears in each sector. We\nopt to link the volume of purchases to the capital-weighted average of the spread between\nthe return on capital and the policy rate. From this point of view, we keep close to the\nliterature.\nIn Figure 2, we depict the effects of asset purchases conducted by the intervention\nauthority in response to the risk shock. The black solid line represents what happens\ndifferences in returns cannot be removed completely by the households (see Andr\u00e9s et al. (2004)).\nwhere there is no policy response, i.e. the pure shock, while the blue dashed lines represent\nthe dynamics resulting from the purchases of corporate bonds and the dashed red lines\nwith dots the dynamics as a result of buying government bonds.\nBoth policy measures show the same qualitative and quantitative responses for most\nvariables. Bond purchases by the intervention authority increase the price of this asset\nclass, which is why the return on the respective bond falls. A standard story is that\nloans and other assets now appear more attractive to the bank, which means that the\nbank should buy the other bonds and grant more loans to the private sector (see, for\nexample, Gertler and Karadi, 2013). However, this is only partly true in our model for\nboth purchases of corporate bonds and government bonds.\nPurchases of corporate bonds reduce the (expected) return on corporate bonds, which\nis why the corresponding risk-free spread shrinks and both banks and households reduce\ntheir holdings of corporate bonds. Although funds are available to invest in other assets,\nthe reduction in returns lessens banks' profits and initiates a stronger reduction in inside\nequity. As a consequence, banks' leverage ratio rises even more strongly that in the initial\nshock scenario. As a result of the higher leverage ratio, the loan supply is even reduced\nby the purchases rather than being stimulated. While there is only a marginal effect on\ncredit spreads, risk-free spreads are mainly reduced through the policy measures. Similar\neffects also arise in the case of purchases of government bonds. Contrary to Gertler and\nKaradi (2013), the net worth of banks, i.e. inside bank equity in our model, does not\nimprove. In our model, inside bank equity is depressed even further because asset returns\nfall by more than the cost of liabilities. Because of the financial frictions between the\nbanking sector and its creditors, banks cut their balance sheets. Again, the reduction in\nreturns lowers banks' profits and increases the leverage ratio.\nThe effects of asset purchases in the case of the profit shock are fundamentally very\nsimilar to those of the risk shock (see Figure 3). Again, outright purchases mainly reduce\ncredit spreads but risk-free spreads only slightly. From the reduction in risk-free spreads\na more persistent fall in inside equity results which drives banks' leverage ratio upwards.\nThis bank leverage effect impairs investment in the third year which is why output falls\nshort of its no policy trajectory at this time.\nFrom the results derived in this subsection, outright purchases of government or cor-\nporate bonds represent a policy tool in our model to mitigate financial stress regardless of\nits source, i.e. whether stemming from the real economy or from the banking sector. In\nour model, outright purchases conducted by a public agent, however, also weaken finan-\ncial health of the bank because smaller asset returns reduce bank profits. From this point\nof view, our channel is similar to the channel highlighted in Benes and Kumhof (2011)\nwho stress the role of returns for the build up of bank equity but contrary to Gertler and\nKaradi (2013) who stress the asset price channel.\nEquity injections into banks are the second type of policy measure that has been widely\nused during the financial crisis to mitigate financial stress. A central problem during the\nfinancial crisis was the erosion of banks' equity position, which has forced banks to delever.\nZeng (2013) shows that equity injections can have real effects in an economy with perfect\nnominal flexibility. Similar results can also be obtained by applying different modelling\nFigure 3: Purchases of government bonds and of corporate bonds as a response to bankers'\nprofit shock\nOutput\n%  from ss\nInflation\nAnnualized\nPP  from ss\nInvestments\n%  from ss\nConsumption\n%  from ss\nCredit spread (aggregate)\nAnnualized\nBP  from ss\nRisk-free spread (aggregate)\nAnnualized\nBP  from ss\nCredit premium (aggregate)\nAnnualized\nBP  from ss\nInside equity bank\n%  from ss\nEntrepr. net worth\n%  from ss\nPrice gov. bonds\n%  from ss\nPrice corp. bonds\n%  from ss\nLeverage ratio (banks)\n from ss\nNo Policy Corp.

Hirakata et al. (2013) and Sandri and Valencia (2013)\ninvestigate equity injections in a general equilibrium model and stress their effectiveness\nin the banking sector. A similar result can be obtained in a continous-time general\nequilibrium model as developed by He and Krishnamurthy (2013). In this section, we\ninvestigate the effects of equity injections into banks within our New Keynesian general\nequilibrium model.\nIn Figures 4 and 5 the black lines represent the crisis situation without a policy re-\nsponse, i.e. the cases of the risk shock and the profit shock, respectively. The dashed blue\nlines show the effects of a moderate policy response in terms of resources used, while the\nred dashed lines with dots reflect a stronger policy response.\nAs in the models designed by He and Krishnamurthy (2013), Hirakata et al. (2013), and\nSandri and Valencia (2013), direct equity injections also relax the borrowing constraint of\nbanks in our model because the amount of inside equity rises and reduces banks' leverage\n(see Equation (36)). With the additional money that the bank receives, it expands its\nbalance sheet by lending more to entrepreneurs of type B and by buying more bonds\n(corporate bonds and government bonds). Lower loan rates and bond returns stimulate\nentrepreneurs' net worth and investment in physical capital by relaxing financial frictions.\nBoth credit spreads and risk-free spreads are lower compared to the no policy case in both\ninvestment sectors. The drop in investment is attenuated and output shrinks by less,\nFigure 4: Equity injections into banks as a response to an entrepreneurial risk shock\nOutput\n%  from ss\nInflation\nAnnualized\nPP  from ss\nInvestments\n%  from ss\nConsumption\n%  from ss\nCredit spread (aggregate)\nAnnualized\nBP  from ss\nRisk-free spread (aggregate)\nAnnualized\nBP  from ss\nCredit premium (aggregate)\nAnnualized\nBP  from ss\nInside equity bank\n%  from ss\nEntrepr. net worth\n%  from ss\nPrice gov. bonds\n%  from ss\nPrice corp. bonds\n%  from ss\nLeverage ratio (banks)\n from ss\nNo Policy Moderate Policy (EI=0.4) Stronger Policy (EI=1.5)\nNote: see notes for Figures 1 and 2.\nwhich also takes downward pressure from inflation. However, consumption initially falls\nby more but recovers faster because of wealth effects. Compared to the crisis situation,\nlower (risk-free) bond returns cut profits, which is why households reduce both their\nholdings of bonds and consumption even more.\nFor the profit shock, as presented in Figure 5, the effects are similar to the risk shock\ncase, again. The drop in investment is attenuated, which causes output to fall by less\ncompared to the no policy case. Differences occur with respect to the leverage ratio, the\ninitial effect of the shock has increased banks' leverage ratio, whereas the additional bank\nequity reduces the leverage ratio.\nAs can be seen, an important advantage of injections of inside bank equity is that\nfinancial frictions are alleviated (see Gertler and Kiyotaki (2010) for the argument, for\ninstance). Equity injections into banks are a particularly suitable response to the bank-\nspecific shock because they neutralize the original consequences of the shock. Injections\nof bank equity reduce banks' borrowing constraint at the same time as improving the real\nsector's borrowing conditions for the bank-specific shock and seem to be more favorable\nthan asset purchases in this case. For the bank-specific shock, asset purchases reinforce\nstress in the banking sector because of their consequences for bank equity. Since loans\ndominate banks' portfolio, the effects of the stabilization of asset prices as a result of the\npublic purchases are outweighed by the effects in terms of returns on banks' profits.\nIn order to evaluate the differences among the measures, we need to look at indicators\nwhich allow comparisons. In this respect, we also take the welfare perspective, which is\nFigure 5: Equity injections into banks as a response to bankers' profit shock\nOutput\n%  from ss\nInflation\nAnnualized\nPP  from ss\nInvestments\n%  from ss\nConsumption\n%  from ss\nCredit spread (aggregate)\nAnnualized\nBP  from ss\nRisk-free spread (aggregate)\nAnnualized\nBP  from ss\nCredit premium (aggregate)\nAnnualized\nBP  from ss\nInside equity bank\n%  from ss\nEntrepr. net worth\n%  from ss\nPrice gov. bonds\n%  from ss\nPrice corp. bonds\n%  from ss\nLeverage ratio (banks)\n from ss\nNo Policy Moderate Policy (EI=0.4) Stronger Policy (EI=1.5)\nNote: see notes for Figures 1 and 2.\ndone in the next section.\n4.3 Evaluation of policy measures\nThere are two dimensions to evaluating policy measures. Firstly, we compare the quali-\ntative effects of the responses across policy measures in more detail. For this purpose, we\nlook at the pure policy responses which are not linked to a specific crisis indicator. In this\nconnection, we also evaluate the effectiveness of measures by looking at the additional\noutput effects given specific resources used. Secondly, we take the welfare perspective to\ncomplete the evaluation of measures' effectiveness.\n4.3.1 Comparison of direct effects and effectiveness of policy measures\nIn Figure 6, the solid black lines represent the effects of an equity injection, while the blue\ndashed line and the red dashed line with dots show the responses to corporate bond and\ngovernment bond purchases, respectively. For the asset purchases, we scale the initial\nvolume of purchases to the same level, which amounts to 5% of GDP. For the equity\ninjection case, the amount of interventions falls short of the other two cases. Here, we\ncalibrate the intervention volume such that the peak in the response to investment roughly\ncoincides with the peak for corporate bond purchases. Regarding the macroeconomic\nvariables, output, inflation, consumption, and investment, the effects following corporate\nFigure 6: Comparison of responses to pure policy shocks\nOutput\n%  from ss\nAnnualized\nPP  from ss\nInvestments\n%  from ss\nConsumption\n%  from ss\nInvestment (loan sector)\n%  from ss\nInvestment (bond sector)\n%  from ss\nCredit spread (loan sector)\nAnnualized\nBP  from ss\nCredit spread (corp. bond sector)\nAnnualized\nBP  from ss\nRisk-free spread (loans)\nAnnualized\nBP  from ss\nRisk-free spread (corp. bonds)\nAnnualized\nBP  from ss\nLending to entrepr.\n%  from ss\nInside equity bank\n%  from ss\nCredit premium (aggregate)\nAnnualized\nBP  from ss\nLeverage ratio (bond sector)\n from ss\nLeverage ratio (loan sector)\n from ss\nEntrepr. net worth\n%  from ss\nPrice gov. bonds\n%  from ss\nPrice corp. bonds\n%  from ss\nLeverage ratio (banks)\n from ss\nAsset purchases\n% of GDP\nEquity injection Corporate bond purchases Government bond purchases\nNote: The Figure presents the pure responses to equity injections and purchases of government and corporate bonds. See\nalso notes for Figures 1 and 2.\nbond purchases are qualitatively nearly identical to the the impact of outright purchases\nof government bonds. A comparison of purchases of bonds with equity injections yields\nmajor differences. Aggregate investment is boosted on impact in all cases, which results\nin an increase in output, but output falls below the no policy case following the second\nyear for bond purchases.\nThese qualitative differences can, in part, be traced back to developments in sectoral\ninvestment, although aggregate investment responds equally on impact. As already de-\nscribed, equity injections lower banks' leverage ratio, which has two effects: external\nborrowing is facilitated because both financial frictions are relaxed and additional finan-\ncial resources are directly available. Thus, the loan rate decreases slightly and stimulates\nloan production. At the same time, corporate bond returns fall because of higher demand\nfor corporate bonds, which reduces borrowing costs in the bond sector and contributes to\nthe increase in investment in this sector.\nAs opposed to equity injections, investment in the bond sector is reduced in the case\nof bond purchases. As mentioned above, lower corporate bond returns weaken banks'\nbalance sheet by increasing the leverage ratio. This effect is similar for government bond\npurchases. The drop in bank equity resulting from the reduction in lending rates drives\nbanks' leverage ratio upwards. As a consequence, banks reduce their lending activities.\nFor the less financially constrained bond sector, this volume effect outweighs the improve-\nTable 5: Present value multiplier on output and investment as a response to the pure\npolicy shocks\nEquity injections Corporate bond\npurchases\nGovernment bond\npurchases\n4 quarters 8 quarters 4 quarters 8 quarters 4 quarters 8 quarters\nNote: The Table shows the multipliers on output and investment over one and two years following the pure policy shocks,\ni.e. equity injections and purchases of government and corporate bonds.\nment in borrowing conditions.52 Because of the introduction of market-based debt, bond\nprices also affect entrepreneurial net worth in this sector.53 Specifically, the support for\ncorporate bond prices from the introduction of the policy measures reduces entrepreneurial\nnet worth in the corporate bond sector and exerts upward pressure on the entrepreneurial\nleverage ratio with consequences for the credit spread in this sector. Thus, investment\nis reduced since banks need to adjust their asset holdings, while borrowing conditions\nare driven by the exogenous public intervention. This interrelationship becomes clear\nwhen the responses in terms of banks' leverage ratio are compared with the responses\nof bank equity, the price for corporate and government bonds, and aggregate lending to\nentrepreneurs. Asset purchases only stabilize banks' balance sheet in the first periods\nof the implementation of the policy. As public intermediation becomes weaker, bank\ndeleveraging even drives bond prices downwards.\nObviously, output does not improve persistently in the case of outright purchases.\nWhen evaluating the effectiveness of measures, Figure 6 provides a first hint. While nearly\nthe same output response is achieved, much more resources are spent for the purchase\nof bonds. In order to allow for qualitative comparisons among the measures, we use a\nsimple indicator, which is known from fiscal policy analysis. We compute the present value\nmultiplier over the first k quarters on the change in the macro variable Xt\nin response\nto the resources used for the corresponding policy measure PM. Similarly to Mountford\nand Uhlig (2009), the present value multiplier is defined as\n=\nk\ni\niXt+i\nk\ni\niPMt+i\n.\nWe draw on the multipliers on output and (aggregate) investment and provide the\npresent value multiplier for the next year and the next two years for every policy measure\nunder consideration in Table 5.\n52In a sense, this effect can be seen as a reflection of the different responses of more and less financially\nconstrained firms to monetary policy shocks, as discussed by Gertler and Gilchrist (1994). Gertler\nand Gilchrist (1994) demonstrate that more financially constrained firms reduce bank borrowing after a\ncontractionary monetary policy shock, whereas this is not the case for less constrained firms.\n53K\u00fchl (2014) investigates the effects of bond prices and maturities in the BGG framework. He shows\nthat prolongation risk becomes apparent for longer maturities and can reverse the behavior of the external\nfinance premium because bond prices also affect entrepreneurial net worth.\nIn line with the visual inspection, all measures exhibit a positive multiplier on both\noutput and investment. However, the multiplier following equity injections is of a greater\nsize than those for both purchases. Purchases of bonds are successful regardless of whether\ncorporate or government bonds are purchased; the exact multipliers are even nearly iden-\ntical for the specific cases. Regarding the qualitative responses, these results are broadly\nin line with those obtained by Gertler and Karadi (2013), who combine government debt\nwith a state-contingent asset. Nevertheless, quantitative difference occur which can be\ntraced back to the introduction of non-market debt in our model. From this point of view,\nequity injections are better suited to stabilize an economy since less resources are needed.\nThe special role of equity is mainly responsible for this result. As already stressed, equity\ninjections relax financial frictions in the banking sector by driving the leverage ratio down.\nThe comparison of measures has drawn on the quantitative effects on investment and\noutput. However, the evaluation of different measures compared to a benchmark case\n(the crisis situation) must be carried out under the welfare perspective to assess their\nusefulness for the agents (following the arguments of Lucas (1987) in the sense of reducing\nbusiness cycle fluctuations). Thus, we ask which of the three proposed measures is welfare\nimproving and compare the welfare implications among the measures. Welfare will also\ndepend on the amount of resources used, which is why we compute welfare for a range of\nresources used. Furthermore we depart slightly from a full-blown welfare analysis which\nstarts from specific shocks and investigates different policy rules under this environment.\nInstead, we assume that a specific shock is known to the policy maker and he reacts with\none specific measure to this shock, i.e. there is full information. This means that we\ntreat the cases of both financial shocks separately and for each we shock calculate and\nmeasure the consumption equivalent welfare gain by increasing the initial intervention\nvolume. Consumption equivalent welfare is calculated according to the approach discussed\nin Schmitt-Groh\u00e9 and Uribe (2007) based upon\n\ntu (Ct\n, Nt\n\nt\n) \u00af\nC, \u00af\nN ,\nin which c\nt\nis the consumption equivalent that equates conditional welfare with the basic\nscenario.\nIn Figure 7, we present consumption equivalent welfare gains by implementing the\npolicy measures following the risk shock. Figure 7 consists of two graphs: the left-hand\nside shows welfare gains for a range of resources from zero to 0.15% of GDP. In this range,\nequity injections following a risk shock first improve welfare before they start to lessen wel-\nfare significantly. Both types of asset purchase have similar welfare implications. While\nwelfare remains nearly constant for smaller intervention volumes, with increasing inter-\nvention volumes, which are presented in the right-hand graph, welfare increases steadily\nand even exceeds the maximum achieved by capital injections. The reason why welfare\ndeteriorates for larger equity injections following the risk shock is that the initial shock\nhas already depressed asset returns and consumption, which is exacerbated by the policy\nmeasure. Thus, equity injections in a case where financial stress does not stem from the\nFigure 7: Evaluation of the policy measures under the welfare perspective for the en-\ntrepreneurial risk shock\nWelfare gain in consumption equivalents\n% of GDP\nEquity Injection\nCorp. Bond Purchases\nGov. Bond Purchases\nWelfare gain in consumption equivalents\n% of GDP\nNote: The Figure reports the welfare gain measured in consumption equivalents by introducing one specific policy measure\nin response to one specific shock, whereas the intervention intensity in terms of resources expressed in percentage of GDP\nis varied.\nbanking sector quickly lowers welfare if injections are too large. Up to first order, this is\nbecause households receive lower returns from their asset holdings, this induces greater\nbusiness cycle fluctuations. Recall that a risk shock can be interpreted as a financial shock\nin a completely diversified economy. As long as risk has not returned to its normal level,\noutright asset purchases substitute private intermediation, reduce borrowing conditions,\nand mitigate the original shock (see again Figure 6 for the bond sector).\nFor the profit shock, as given in Figure 8, the evaluation of policy measures is again\nqualitatively similar for different ranges of intervention volume. Small amounts raised\nfor equity injections clearly improve welfare, but the effect is negative for larger volumes.\nAgain, asset purchases are welfare improving but equity injections are much more efficient\nin terms of alleviating the implications of the profit shock on households' welfare. The\ndriving force behind this is a combination of different effects: risk-free returns shrink\nless strongly and consumption falls more strongly but recovers faster. From this point of\nview, equity injections improve welfare more efficiently in the case of a financial shock that\ndistorts the main financial intermediary in the economy. Much larger volumes of outright\npurchases are needed to achieve the same welfare improvement. Nevertheless, excessively\nlarge equity injections also reduce welfare because they start to induce additional volatility.\nAs can be seen from our welfare analysis, outright purchases are strictly welfare im-\nproving for both types of shock, regardless of the resources used. However, the interven-\ntions conducted by the public intervention authority might be linked to costs (see Gertler\ncosts function to address the fact that outright purchases, by increasing the amount of\nintervention, are not per se welfare enhancing. Since the effects of costs on welfare cru-\ncially depend on the functional form of the cost function and its parameters, we decide\nnot to take account of these issues in our analysis. This does not mean that we deny that\npublic interventions raise costs.54 As can be seen in Figure 8, welfare improves with larger\n54Moreover, in our model, the public sector balance sheet allows for stronger feedback effects as in\nDedola et al. (2013) or Gertler and Karadi (2011), because we have a profit/loss redistributing channel\nFigure 8: Evaluation of the policy measures under the welfare perspective for bankers'\nprofit shock\nWelfare gain in consumption equivalents\n% of GDP\nEquity Injection\nCorp.

As long\nas the costs stemming from injections of equity into banks are not much greater than for\noutright purchases in cases of smaller equity injections, the welfare improving effects will\nremain. Moral hazard related to equity injections might be a factor that is not taken into\naccount in our model. Larger outright purchases will also induce costs, which will stop\nthe seemingly steady increase in welfare.\nOur results are in line with recent work by He and Krishnamurthy (2013), though we\nachieve our results within a New Keynesian model and carefully distinguish between the\nsources of financial shocks.55 Nevertheless, the mechanism that drives our results is very\nsimilar.\n4.4 The impact of maturities\nSince we have introduced average maturities in bond portfolios and different average\nmaturities might have an impact on the results, we shed more light on their effects. The\nmaturities in the main text were calibrated to reflect the corresponding euro area averages.\nHowever, it is of interest to see whether the results presented above depend on the average\nmaturity.\nIn Figure 9, we compare the effects of the equity injections as presented in Figure 6,\ni.e. where the corporate bond portfolio has an average maturity of 6.5 years (bold lines),\nwith those where we reduce the average maturity to one period (dashed blue lines). In\nterms of the macroeconomic variables, the qualitative responses do not change overall,\nalthough the quantitative results change slightly. Investment in the bond sector increases\nby more in the short average maturity case, which means that the slight decrease in the\nthird year after implementation disappears. This result is related to the development of\nentrepreneurs' leverage ratio in the bond sector, which translates into the corresponding\ncredit spread. As shown by K\u00fchl (2014), developments in the corporate bond price\nwith feedback on taxes.\n55The model of He and Krishnamurthy (2013) primarily works by affecting agents' risk sharing. Their\nconclusion is nevertheless very similar to ours.\nFigure 9: Comparison of responses to pure equity injection shock for a longer average\nmaturity (bold line) and an average maturity of one period (dashed blue line)\nOutput\n%  from ss\nAnnualized\nPP  from ss\nInvestments\n%  from ss\n%  from ss\nInvestment (loan sector)\n%  from ss\nInvestment (bond sector)\n%  from ss\nCredit spread (loan sector)\nAnnualized\nBP  from ss\nCredit spread (corp. bond sector)\nAnnualized\nBP  from ss\nRisk-free spread (loans)\nAnnualized\nBP  from ss\nRisk-free spread (corp. bonds)\nAnnualized\nBP  from ss\nInside equity bank\n%  from ss\nCredit premium (aggregate)\nAnnualized\nBP  from ss\nLeverage ratio (bond sector)\n from ss\nLeverage ratio (loan sector)\n from ss\nLeverage Ratio\n from ss\nLonger maturity for corp. bonds (6.5 years) Shorter maturity for corp. bonds (1 quarter)\nNote: The Figure presents the pure responses to equity injections with different average maturities. See also note for Figure\nalso affect entrepreneurial net worth, which is particularly relevant for longer average\nmaturities. Equity injections increase demand for bonds, causing prices to rise. This rise\nin corporate bond prices reduces entrepreneurial net worth in the bond sector, stimulates\nthe credit spread and dampens the increase in investment in this sector. For shorter\naverage maturities, entrepreneurial leverage ratios move in parallel in both sectors. As a\nconsequence, aggregate investment, output and inflation rise more as a result of equity\ninjections into the banking sector.\nAs seen in Figure 6, purchases of corporate and government bonds produce nearly\nidentical responses in terms of the variables in which we are interested. For this reason,\nwe rely solely on corporate bond purchases and compare the effects for longer and shorter\naverage maturities (Figure 10). The qualitative responses of macroeconomic variables\nchange more strongly than for equity injections into the banking sector. However, the\ndifferences in responses can be traced back to the same reasons as outlined for the equity\ninjection case. Purchases of corporate bonds directly increase bond prices. Again, higher\ncorporate bond prices tend to increase the entrepreneurial leverage ratio in the corporate\nbond sector. For shorter average maturities, the leverage ratio for type A entrepreneurs\nfalls by more, meaning that the credit spread is also reduced by more, which stimulates\ninvestment in this sector. Since there is no noticeable effect on banks' leverage ratio, the\nbehavior of investment in the bond sector shows the same pattern as for longer average\nFigure 10: Comparison of responses to pure bond purchases shock for a longer average\nmaturity (bold line) and an average maturity of one period (dashed blue line)\nOutput\n%  from ss\nAnnualized\nPP  from ss\nInvestments\n%  from ss\nConsumption\n%  from ss\nInvestment (loan sector)\n%  from ss\nInvestment (bond sector)\n%  from ss\nCredit spread (loan sector)\nAnnualized\nBP  from ss\nCredit spread (corp. bond sector)\nAnnualized\nBP  from ss\nRisk-free spread (loans)\nAnnualized\nBP  from ss\nRisk-free spread (corp. bonds)\nAnnualized\nBP  from ss\nInside equity bank\n%  from ss\nCredit premium (aggregate)\nAnnualized\nBP  from ss\nLeverage ratio (bond sector)\n from ss\nLeverage ratio (loan sector)\n from ss\nLeverage Ratio\n from ss\nLonger maturity for corp. bonds (6.5 years) Shorter maturity for corp. bonds (1 quarter)\nNote: The Figure presents the pure responses to purchases of corporate bonds for different average maturities. See also\nnote for Figure 1.\nmaturities, although an upward level shift takes place. Obviously, the volume effect as\na result of the increase in banks' leverage ratio is outweighed by the improvement in\nborrowing conditions for this case. The slight change in investment and a more persistent\nincrease in consumption, due to wealth effects, prevents output from falling in the second\nyear after introducing the policy measure. At the same time, inflation is stimulated rather\nthan being depressed.\nObviously, shorter average maturities coincide with an increase in the output multi-\nplier. In order to gauge the effects on output of changing the average maturity, we vary\nthe average maturity of corporate bonds on the x-axis in Figure 11 and compute, for each\nvalue, the corresponding output multiplier. Taken together, the pattern is very similar\nacross the three measures. With longer average maturities, the multipliers shrink. How-\never, the largest changes occur in the average maturity range of up to two years. For\nlonger maturities, the reduction is nearly negligible. From this point of view, different\naverage maturities do not affect the overall results.\n4.5 The role of financial frictions\nAs mentioned, we calibrate our model to the euro area. In this respect, we are able to\nreplicate many features of the economic structure such as credit spreads or maturities\nFigure 11: Impact of maturities on output multipliers following equity injections, pur-\nchases of corporate and government bonds\nEquity Injection\n.\nPresent Value Multiplier on Y\nYears\nPurchases of Corporate Bonds\n.\nYears\nPurchases of Government Bonds\n.\nYears\nNote: The Figure presents the output multiplier over four quarters by varying the average maturity of corporate bonds (see\nparameter B,corp in Equation (20)). The Figure presents years on the x-axis.\nof corporate bonds or government bonds. However, parameters which control financial\nfrictions are set plausibly but without an empirical backing. In this section, we investigate\nwhich factors might alter the general results obtained in the preceding sections.\nSince limits to arbitrage are crucial for obtaining non-trivial effects of outright pur-\nchases (Andr\u00e9s et al., 2004), we focus on the factors that drive market segmentation in\nour model. In bankers' incentive constraint (Equation (33)), we assumed that all as-\nsets can be diverted equally. As in Gertler and Karadi (2013), we consequently assume\nnow that assets can be diverted to different degrees. In principle, it is conceivable that\nmoney invested in the loan portfolio is easier to divert than money invested in bonds.\nBonds are traded on a market and the price is publicly available, which makes it easier\nto monitor. By contrast, observation of the loan portfolio is usually exclusive to bankers.\nConsequently, the incentive constraint can be rewritten as\nVn,t\nIC LLn,t\n+ B,BcorpQB,corp\nt\nBcorp\nn,t\n+ B,govQB,gov\nt\nBgov\nn,t\nwhere the parameters L, B,Bcorp, and B,gov range between 0 and 1 and express the\npercentage of money invested in the corresponding asset that can be diverted by bankers.\nAs a consequence, from the modified incentive constraint it follows that the first order\nconditions, which are provided in the Appendix A.6, change.\nIn addition to the features that affect financial frictions in the banking sector, our\nhousehold sector also exhibits financial frictions arising from portfolio costs as presented\nin Equation (7). These costs appear in the Euler equations and consequently affect the\npricing of the assets directly. Similar costs can also be found for the banks (see Equations\n(27) and (28)). Unlike for households, these parameters are pinned down by the steady\nstate because they result from the calibrated yield spreads, which is why we mainly focus\non the other parameters controlling the frictions. Regardless of the considerations made\nabove, we vary the values of the parameters over a broad range. For every parameter\ncombination, we decide to report the present value multiplier on output.\nIn Figure 12, we provide the results for frictions that are related to corporate bonds\nFigure 12: Impact of frictions relating to corporate bonds in the banking sector and\ngovernment bonds in the household sector on the output multiplier over four quarters as\na result of introducing policy measures\nB,corp\nEquity Injection\nB\nPresent Value Multiplier on Y\nB,corp\nPurchases of Corporate Bonds\nB\nPresent Value Multiplier on Y\nB,corp\nPurchases of Government Bonds\nB\nPresent Value Multiplier on Y\nNote: The Figure presents the output multiplier over four quarters where the B parameter in Equation (7) is varied,\nwhich controls the market segmentation related to government bonds with respect to households' portfolio decisions, as is\nthe parameter B,Bcorp in Equation (59), which controls the financial frictions related to corporate bonds in the banking\nsector.\nin the banking sector (x-axis) and to government bonds in the household sector (y-axis).\nIn terms of equity injections and purchases of government bonds, the qualitative effects\nare very similar. Frictions in the banking sector do not matter much for effectiveness,\nfrictions in the household sector mainly affect the magnitude of the multiplier. The larger\nportfolio costs for government bonds are, i.e. the greater market segmentation is, the\nlarger the multiplier is for equity injections, while it is the other way round for purchases\nof government bonds. Frictions in the banking sector mainly matter for purchases of\ncorporate bonds. The more money can be diverted from holdings of corporate bonds,\nthe more effective corporate bond purchases are. With respect to frictions in the banking\nsector, these results are in line with what is expected. A higher degree of friction fosters\nlimits to arbitrage and makes the proposed policy measures more effective. As a result,\nthe multiplier even moves into negative territory for smaller degrees of friction in the\nbanking sector in cases of corporate bond purchases because the effects on investment in\nthe bond sector are not strong enough.\nOutput multipliers resulting from equity injections are not mainly affected by frictions\nwith respect to government bonds in the banking sector. Again, frictions mainly matter\nif they manifest themselves in the household sector (see Figure 13, household sector on\nthe y-axis and banking sector on the x-axis). Greater parameter values for portfolio costs\nincrease the multiplier. For purchases of both corporate bonds and government bonds,\nthe effects of frictions relating to government bonds in the banking sector are qualitatively\nidentical to the previous case. Output multipliers increase more strongly for government\nbond purchases if banks divert more resources from holdings of government bonds.\nIn the last case, we again vary frictions in the household sector for government bonds\n(y-axis) and the share of loans that can be diverted in the banking sector (x-axis) as\nshown in Figure 14. Frictions in the banking sector mainly control the magnitude of\nthe multiplier for equity injections and asset purchases. However, a similar shape arises\nfor both asset purchases but with a reversed slope. The more money banks can divert\nFigure 13: Impact of frictions relating to government bonds on the output multiplier over\nfour quarters as a result of introducing policy measures\nB,gov\nEquity Injection\nB\nPresent Value Multiplier on Y\nB,gov\nPurchases of Corporate Bonds\nB\nPresent Value Multiplier on Y\nB,gov\nPurchases of Government Bonds\nB\nPresent Value Multiplier on Y\nNote: The Figure presents the output multiplier over four quarters where the Bgov parameter in Equation (7) is varied,\nwhich controls the market segmentation related to government bonds with respect to households' portfolio decisions, as is\nthe parameter B,gov in Equation (59), which controls the financial frictions related to government bonds in the banking\nsector.\nfrom the loan portfolio, the lower the multipliers are. As discussed in Section 4.3.1, asset\npurchases alter the returns and lower banks' profits. If frictions in the loan sector increase,\nthe amplification mechanism is stronger and decreases output by more.\nFigure 14: Impact of frictions relating to government bonds in the household sector and\nloans in the banking sector on the output multiplier over four quarters as a result of\nintroducing policy measures\nL\nEquity Injection\nB\nPresent Value Multiplier on Y\nL\nPurchases of Corporate Bonds\nB\nPresent Value Multiplier on Y\nL\nPurchases of Government Bonds\nB\nPresent Value Multiplier on Y\nNote: The Figure presents the output multiplier over four quarters where the Bgov parameter in Equation (7) is varied,\nwhich controls the market segmentation related to government bonds with respect to households' portfolio decisions, as is\nthe parameter L in Equation (59), which controls the financial frictions related to loans in the banking sector.\nSumming up the results from this section: equity injections remain more effective\nby looking at the present value multiplier on output regardless of the characteristics of\nfrictions. They do not turn into negative in the presented cases. The quantitative effects\nof outright purchases, however, heavily depend on the magnitude of frictions.\n5 Conclusion\nIn this paper, we investigated the unconventional policy measures applied by central banks\nand governments to fight the fallout from the financial crisis. We draw on a New Keynesian\nstochastic general equilibrium model with a well-elaborated financial sector in which bank-\nfinanced debt plays a major role. From this point of view, our model is able to imitate the\nstructure of the euro area to which we calibrate it. We combine an agency problem between\nthe banking sector and capital producers with a costly state verification problem between\nthe banking sector and non-financial corporations. As opposed to Hirakata et al. (2011),\nHirakata et al. (2013), and Sandri and Valencia (2013), our bank is not risky since it\ncannot go bankrupt. Nevertheless, we allow for a loss distribution channel. An advantage\nof our framework is that it abstracts from defaults in the banking sector. We modeled\ntwo different sectors which allows us to distinguish between non-market-based debt, i.e.\nloans, and market-based debt, i.e. corporate bonds that are traded on the capital market.\nFurthermore, two sided financial contracting makes it possible to distinguish between two\ndifferent sources of financial stress, i.e. the riskiness of the entrepreneurial sector and an\nexogenous drop in banks' net worth. This setting enabled us to investigate the effects of\nunconventional measures, equity injections and outright purchases, on the real economy\nand the financial sector. By using the same consistent framework, we were able to compare\nthe efficacy of different policy measures and even evaluate their feedback effects.\nIt turns out that injections of inside equity into banks seem to be more efficient in terms\nof resources used. However, equity injections are welfare improving mainly if financial\nstress stems from the banking sector. They tend to be efficient because the build-up of\ninside equity relaxes banks' borrowing constraints and reduces borrowing conditions at\nthe same time. Our results are in line with those of Christiano and Ikeda (2013a) and\nHe and Krishnamurthy (2013), who utilize different frameworks. Outright purchases (of\ncorporate bonds or government bonds) also improve welfare but only by utilizing more\nresources. They tend to reduce returns, which lowers banks' profits and weakens banks'\nbalance sheets. Since banks' balance sheets are dominated by loans rather than securities,\nthe price stabilizing role of asset purchases is of minor importance. From this point of\nview, our results complement the results obtained in the literature, where traded assets\nare accorded greater importance. If non-market-based debt dominates banks' balance\nsheets, as in the case of the euro area, equity injections into the banking sector might\nbe more efficient if the financial shock originates in the banking sector. However, moral\nhazard problems resulting from banks' inherent option of drawing on public resources in\ncases of financial stress are not addressed in this paper.\nA Model\nA.1 Households\nFor the optimal real wage (w\nh,t\n) one finally obtains\nw\nh,t\n=\n\n\n\n\nw\nEt\n\n(w)s w-w(1+)\nt+s\nw\nt+s\nPt\nPt+s\nt+s\nEt\n\n(w)s h,t+s\nt+s\n) w-w\nt+s\nw\nt+s\nPt\nPt+s\nNt+s\n\n\n\n\n,\nwhere the term w is the degree of substitution between differentiated labor,  reflects\nthe inverse Frisch elasticity and w\nt+s\ncomprises changes in rates of inflation until date s.\nThe optimal labor supply is denoted with N\nh,t\n.
