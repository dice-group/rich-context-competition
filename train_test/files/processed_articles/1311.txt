Add Health Wave III is available and\nprovides data on depression in adolescence and adult-\nhood and on biologically confirmed STI in young adult-\nhood. Given the limited research into depression and STI\nfrom adolescence into adulthood, further study of depres-\nsion and STI in the Add Health sample was warranted.\nThe purpose of this study was to measure the asso-\nciation between depression in adolescence and adult-\nhood and sexual risk behaviors and biologically con-\nfirmed STI in adulthood using Waves I and III of Add\nHealth. We investigated whether the associations be-\ntween depression and outcomes differed for men vs\nwomen and for whites vs blacks, to obtain population-\nspecific information needed to maximize intervention\nresources.\nMETHODS\nAdd Health is a prospective cohort study designed to investi-\ngate factors of health from adolescence into adulthood.53 The\noriginal study population was a stratified, random, school-\nbased sample representative of US middle and high school stu-\nadolescents completed a baseline interview assessing charac-\nteristics that included sexual behavior and depression. Par-\nI participants were reinterviewed and urine specimens were col-\nlected for determination of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisse-\nria gonorrhoeae infection with use of ligase chain reaction (Ab-\nbott LCx Probe System; Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park,\nIllinois) and of Trichomonas vaginalis infection with use of poly-\nmerase chain reaction (Amplicor CT/NG Urine Specimen Prep\nKit; Roche Diagnostic Systems, Indianapolis, Indiana). The study\ndesign has been described in detail elsewhere.54-59\nWe used measures from Waves I and III for this analysis of\ndepression and STI. Ethical approval for this research was ob-\ntained from The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\nSchool of Public Health Institutional Review Board.\nMEASURES\nExposure: Depression\nDepression was assessed using a modified version of the Cen-\nter for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D).60 The\noriginal CES-D is composed of 20 items, each of which as-\nsesses the frequency of experiencing depressive symptoms in\nthe past week (responses are rated as 0, never or rarely; 1, some-\ntimes; 2, a lot of the time; or 3, most of the time/all of the time).\nFour items assess positive symptoms (eg, frequency of happi-\nness, whether one enjoys life) and are reversed before the score\nis computed. The composite score (based on the 20-item CES-D)\nranges from 0 to 60, with higher scores indicating increased\nseverity of depression. The scores of 24 for females and 22 for\nmales have been determined to be sensitive and specific indi-\ncators of major depressive disorder among adolescents.61\nWe used a modified version of the CES-D composed of a\nsubset of 9 items common to both Waves I and III (eSupple-\nment; http://www.archpediatrics.com) to calculate each par-\nticipant's depression score at Wave I and at Wave III (possible\nFollowing the methods of Shrier et al,5,6 we identified sex-\nspecific cut points for major depressive disorder based on a modi-\nfied CES-D that were proportional to the cut points for major\ndepressive disorder based on the complete 20-item CES-D.61\namong females indicated major depressive disorder. For con-\nvenience, we identified male or female respondents with a score\nof 10 or greater as having a high likelihood of major depres-\nsive disorder. We subsequently refer to this high likelihood of\nmajor depressive disorder as \"depression.\"\nBased on our categorizations of depression at Waves I and\nIII, we defined a 3-level depression exposure variable. We coded\nrespondents with depression in adulthood (Wave III) who also\nhad depression in adolescence (Wave I) as having chronic de-\npression, respondents with depression in adulthood (Wave III)\nwho did not have depression in adolescence (Wave I) as hav-\ning recent depression, and respondents who were not de-\npressed in adulthood (Wave III) as having no adult depression.\nOutcomes: Sexual Risk Behaviors\nand STI (Wave III)\nWe measured associations between recent and chronic depres-\nsion and the following sexual risk behaviors in the year before\nWave III: 2 or more sexual partners, 6 or more sexual part-\nners, 10 or more sexual partners, 0% condom use, and less than\n100% condom use (yes vs no). We also examined the associa-\ntion between depression and biologically confirmed STI at Wave\nIII (a positive test result for C trachomatis, N gonorrhoeae, or\nT vaginalis on Wave III urine specimen vs a negative result for\nall 3 tests).\nWe considered each of the following covariates as a potential con-\nfounding variable based on its a priori causal relationship with\nthe exposure and outcome: age; marital history; maternal edu-\ncation measured by Wave I self-report if the mother was inter-\nviewed, otherwise by adolescent's report; Wave III low func-\ntionalincomestatusinthepastyear;ageatfirstvaginalintercourse;\nself-reported STI at Wave I (self-report of diagnosis with chla-\nmydial infection, gonorrhea, trichomoniasis, syphilis, genital her-\npes, or human immunodeficiency virus vs no self-reported STI\ndiagnosis); Wave I frequent alcohol consumption in the past year,\ndefined as drinking at least 3 days per week; Wave I lifetime mari-\njuana use; and Wave I lifetime crack or cocaine use.\nFor all analyses, we used survey commands in Stata Version\n9.1 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas) to account for stratifi-\ncation, clustering, and unequal selection probabilities, yield-\ning nationally representative estimates.\nWe used bivariable analyses to calculate weighted preva-\nlences and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of Wave III STI by\ndemographic,socioeconomic,mentalhealth,andbehavioralvari-\nables.Wealsoinvestigatedwhetherdepressionandmentalhealth\ncare differed between whites and blacks.\nWe estimated unadjusted prevalence ratios (PRs) and 95%\nCIs for associations between depression and outcomes (mul-\ntiple partner indicators, condom use indicators, and STI) by\nsex and race (white vs black) using a Poisson model without\nan offset, specifying a log link and probability weights.62,63 Ad-\njusted models included demographic, socioeconomic, depres-\nsion, and adolescent STI risk and substance use variables.\n\u00a92009 American Medical Association.

Among\nblack men, chronic depression was associated with mul-\ntiple sexual partners and STI.

In analyses adjusted\nfor original confounding factors and for variables hy-\npothesized to mediate the depression-STI association (in-\ndicators of having 2, 6, or 10 partners in the past year),\nthe association was not attenuated. In fact, the associa-\ntion between chronic depression and STI somewhat\ning 6 or more partners in the past year did not mediate\nthe association between chronic depression and STI.\nAlthough recent depression was associated with STI\namong black men, it was not associated with multiple\npartners or condom use. Other sexual behaviors or non-\nbehavioral factors not measured in this study appeared\nto account for the strong association between recent de-\npression and STI.\nCOMMENT\nAmong this nationally representative sample, white and\nblack young adults with recent or chronic depression were\nmuch more likely to have multiple sexual partners, an\nimportant determinant of STI, than were those identi-\nfied as having no depression in adulthood. In black men,\ndepression was associated with 2 to 3 times the preva-\nlence of STI. In all groups, associations between depres-\nsion and STI-related behaviors and infection remained\nwhen adjusted for demographic, socioeconomic, and ado-\nlescent STI risk and substance use variables, suggesting\nthat depression may influence STI risk independent of\nthese factors. Because our analysis included compo-\nnents of a longitudinal study, including measurement of\ndepression from adolescence and control of baseline STI\nrisk, we interpret these findings to suggest that depres-\nsion through adolescence likely contributed to STI risk\namong young adults. Our observations support earlier\nfindings that depression appears to predict STI and re-\nlated behaviors among adolescents and young adults.6,9\nGiven the strong associations between depression and STI\nrisk, these findings highlight a need for improved inte-\nTable 3.

Other factors underlie the\nassociation between depression and STI in black men. It\nis possible that chronic depression contributed to other\nsexual risk-taking behaviors that we did not measure.\nIn addition, chronically depressed black men may have\nhigh-risk social and sexual networks and, hence, expe-\nrience greater risk of coming into contact with an\ninfected sexual partner than do black men who are not\ndepressed. This may be the case, in part, because\ndepression is strongly associated with substance\nlevels of STI.50-52 This study has pointed to a robust\nassociation between depression and STI risk in black\nmen. Because this study has not elucidated the mecha-\nnisms through which depression may increase the\nprevalence of STI in this group, it highlights the need\nfor further research into the effects of depression on STI\nrisk for black men and their sexual partners.\nFor all groups (white men and women, and black men\nandwomen),depression-relatedincreasesinmultiplepart-\nners did not appear to translate into higher infection lev-\nels. For whites, this finding was not surprising given the\nlow prevalence of infection in white sexual networks.\nHowever, if infection were introduced into sexual net-\nworks of recently and chronically depressed whites, de-\npression-associated increases in multiple partners may\nfacilitate STI transmission.\nForblacks,althoughdepressionwasassociatedwithhav-\ning multiple partners, the prevalence of STI was alarm-\ningly high among blacks with both high and low levels of\ndepression and multiple partners. These findings validate\nan earlier Add Health study that found STI prevalence is\ndisproportionately high in blacks compared with that in\nwhites, even in blacks with relatively low levels of risk be-\nhaviors.66 The study concluded that factors other than in-\ndividual-levelriskbehaviorslikelydrivehighinfectionrates\ninblacks.Sexualmixingbetweenhigh-andlow-riskgroups\nismuchmorecommonforblacksthanforwhitesandlikely\ncontributes to disproportionate STI transmission in black\npopulations.66 It is possible that structural and contextual\nfactors play a more important role than individual-level be-\nhaviors in driving STI transmission in blacks, by contrib-\nuting to sexual mixing patterns and the concentration of\ninfection in black communities.\nThe prevalence of depression was higher for blacks than\nfor whites, and we observed a race differential in levels of\ncounseling and treatment for depression. These differ-\nences support existing evidence of a race disparity in men-\ntal health care67-69 and further indicate that undiagnosed,\nuntreateddepressionconstitutesanimportantpublichealth\nconcern for blacks. These results documented the high\nprevalence of depression and inadequate diagnosis of and\ncare for mental health needs in blacks, as well as strong as-\nsociations between depression and STI risk in this group,\nhighlighting the importance of improving mental health\ncare in black communities.\nThe most important limitation of this research was our\ninability to conduct a fully longitudinal study, because\nwe sought to examine chronic depression from adoles-\ncence into adulthood and STI in adulthood. In particu-\nlar, the long time between data collection in adoles-\ncence (Wave I) and young adulthood (Wave III) limited\nour ability to definitively assess the causal role of depres-\nsion in sexual risk behavior and STI. To establish whether\nadolescent depression is causally associated with acqui-\nsition of STI in adulthood among blacks, a longitudinal\nTable 4.

Our 9-item modified CES-D was not vali-\ndated against a clinical diagnosis of depression, which\nmay have resulted in misclassification of depression. Fur-\nthermore, we assumed that the CES-D functioned simi-\nlarly in white and black groups. While some research has\nshown that the CES-D measures differing underlying phe-\nnomena for different racial/ethnic adolescent groups,70\nother studies have suggested that the scale functions com-\nparably in both white and African American popula-\ntions71 and has good sensitivity and moderate specific-\nity to detect depression in black populations.72\nThis study provided further evidence that US youth\nat high risk for STI also experience a disproportionate\nrisk of depression, highlighting the need for improved\nintegration of mental health and STI diagnosis, treat-\nment, and prevention. Because levels of depression and\nSTI were higher and the associations between these vari-\nables were stronger for blacks than for whites, black youth\nshould be a priority when allocating resources to im-\nprove mental health care. Improved diagnosis and care\nfor depression are needed not only because depression\nconstitutes an important public health concern in itself\nbut also because addressing depression may lead to im-\nproved physical health, including lower risk for STI.\nCorrespondence: Maria R.
