Its development has brought about a series\nof local responses to global socioeconomic and political environments and \"soft\" stimuli. This conclusion is based on a\ncritical, interpretive reading of the history, form, and content of television in Nigeria from Obafemi Awolowo's Western\nNigeria Television in Ibadan through the federal government's reactive establishment of the national network: the Nigeria\nTelevision Authority, and later, states and private television stations. The ultimate deregulation of television broadcasting in\n1992, perceived as Babangida's \"politically-correct\" reaction to the pressures from the Bretton Woods institutions, opened\nup national media markets for global penetration, and fast-tracked media globalization and its effects in Nigeria.

Thussu (2000) notes that\n\"it's not surprising that theories of communication began to\nemerge in parallel with the rapid social and economic\nchanges of the Industrial Revolution in Europe\" (p. 53).\nCommunication at the international level also reflects its sig-\nnificance in the growth of \"capitalism and empire\" following\nadvances in science and technology. This becomes obvious\nwhen we recognize that a theory like Daniel Lerner's mod-\nernization theory essentially runs through many other theo-\nries. Modernization theory gained patronage from the United\nNations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization\n(UNESCO) as a way of spreading modernity, and also later\nin the 1990s by international nongovernmental organizations\nand global media corporations to spread \"capitalism on the\nwheels of electronics\" characterized by calls for open air-\nwaves and free flow of information. This move was to allow\nglobal media multi-nationals to operate without hindrance\nanywhere in the world. The dependency and structural impe-\nrialism theories also exemplified how colonial \"centers\"\n(political and economic) perpetrated and benefited from con-\ntinual maintenance of their \"peripheralities\" as dependents.\nThe capitalist-empire-states, according to Amoda (2000),\nreconstitute the developing world with structures and func-\ntions, which ensure their dependency; thus, export-import\ndependency equals structural dependency in the third world.\nThe beginning of empire service broadcasting by the\nBritish Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) in December 19,\n1932, to British colonial outposts typicalizes these theoreti-\ncal tendencies. It is noteworthy that Galtung's structural\nimperialism theory earlier identified five types of imperialis-\ntic exchanges between centers and peripheries (viz: eco-\nnomic, political, military, communication, and cultural\nflows), which tend to recur in contemporary Information\nsociety; and in media globalization theories'identification of\nwhat Appadurai calls \"homogenizing scapes\" (viz: eth-\nnoscapes, technoscapes, financescapes, mediascapes, and\nideoscapes; Appadurai, 1996).

In essence, therefore, the theoretical backbone of a\nhistorical narrative such as this is the persistence of modern-\nization/dependency theories whose links can be seen in other\ntheories like structural imperialism to 21st century media\nglobalization theories. We tend to see national broadcasters\nreplicating global broadcast structures and content on the\none hand, and mutual cooperation between national/interna-\ntional organizations or grants/aids toward modernizing\nbroadcasters in the periphery. What is the nature of this\n\"soft influence\" or subliminal power that these assistance\nand aids mean to the receiving nation, or is aid really gratis\nand without conditionality in our contemporary globalization\nsetting?\nThis reading is based on literature and decades of per-\nsonal field observation of TV broadcasting in Nigeria, espe-\ncially in its first 50 years, and it looks to see the various\nsubtle, indirect methods and approaches that dominant cen-\nters and hegemonies deploy to shape the development of the\nbroadcasting industry in a \"peripherality\" like Nigeria.\nHowever, it must be stated that this \"soft-power\" exercised\nby regional/global or extra-governmental influences may or\nmay not have directly influenced the form and even content\nof public service TV broadcasting in Nigeria.\nHistorical Influences in the\nDevelopment of TV Broadcasting in\nNigeria\nThe development of television broadcasting in Nigeria in the\nlast 50 years has brought about a series of reactive jerks to\nthe multiple local and global environments. With its umbili-\ncal cord in the Radio Distribution Service of the BBC, which\nbecame operational in Nigeria since 1935, this colonial\ncontrivance was designed to \"provide communication link\nbetween the colonial officer with the imperial home\"\nWestern Nigeria Broadcasting Corporation (WNBC)\nTelevision as first TV in Nigeria (or Africa), in 1959 as an act\nof protest against the colonial governor, John McPherson, by\nObafemi Awolowo, then premier of Western Nigeria,\nspawned a model for the spiral of new TV stations as a way\nof managing political propaganda through the airwaves.\nBoth acts conceived later years' paradigm of undue bureau-\ncratization and political domination of state media. This\ntrend has continued today among the nation's public service\nbroadcasters, whereby the medium is governed by authori-\ntarian principles with the political leadership and power elite\ndominating and interfering with media content, manage-\n1985). Like its beginnings, the evolution of TV broadcasting\nhas continued to be a series of local responses to global\nsocioeconomic and political promptings.\nFolarin (2000) breaks the timeline for television broad-\ncasting in Nigeria into four distinct phases. The first phase\ntook off with the establishment of the Western Nigeria\nTelevision/Western Nigeria Broadcasting Service (WNTV/\nWNBS) Ibadan in 1959 to the outbreak of the civil war in\n1967. The second phase continued from the hostilities in\n1970 till the Federal government takeover of television ser-\nvices and establishment of the Nigerian Television Authority\n(NTA). Even though Folarin considers the beginning of the\ncivil war as a disruption of broadcasting services, it needs to\nbe mentioned that the civil war, especially in Eastern Nigeria,\ncontributed to the evolution of guerilla-style or revolutionary\npractice of broadcasting even though it was only transitional\nwithin the Biafran experience. That experience may also\nhave later contributed to Wole Soyinka's Radio Democrat\n(later Radio Kudirat) during Sani Abacha's despotism.\nThe third phase was marked by the return of broadcasting\nwhen the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) was\nto deregulate the industry. The fourth stage is the era of\nderegulated and competitive broadcasting in Nigeria in the\npresent day, which has witnessed an astronomic rise in the\nnumber of terrestrial and cable TV stations to more than\nabout 166. This periodization can also be articulated politi-\nThe dominant character of these regimes, as perceptively\nnoted by Osaghae (2002), was their susceptibility to the\n\"new-found benevolence\" of the West that \"could not dis-\nguise the self-serving policies of the advanced capitalist\ncountries, which aimed at perpetuating the peripheralisation\nof the underdeveloped countries\" (p. 314). Continuing, Nnoli\nments became powerless to influence not only economic\nactivities in the international system but also within the\n\"soft\" influences may be read against the above periodiza-\ntion and dispositions of the various administrations.\nConceived as a medium for \"mass information and\ninstruction,\" Awolowo during the commissioning of WNBC\nin Ibadan asserted that television \"is a powerful influence for\ngood\" that will make our country greater (cited in Lasode,\nimmediate reaction from the eastern and northern regions.\nEastern Nigeria Television (ENTV) followed in October\n1960, while Radio Kaduna Television (RKTV) took off in\nMarch 1962, as TV service of the Broadcasting Company of\nNorthern Nigeria (BCNN).\nThe Federal Government in response initiated moves in\n1962 to establish the Nigeria Television Service (NTS) with\nthe National Broadcasting Company International (NBCI) of\nthe United States as managing partners. This followed the\n(now Cap 469, Laws of the Federal Republic of Nigeria,\nauthenticated the already established regional stations.

This Ministry, a forerunner of\ntoday's NBC, was by this Act charged with allocation of\nwavelength, regulating output and station location, and\nensuring compliance in line with the International\nTelecommunications Conventions.\nThe objectives of the various stations were the humdrum\nroles of educating, informing, and entertaining. Even though\nthere was a National Communications Policy which drew\ninspiration from the Cultural Policy and Constitution, there\nhas been no definite policy thrust for broadcasting in terms\nof grassroots cultural development (Opubor, 2005).

Television has been and remains a\n\"manipulative one way\" medium for governments both at\nthe federal and state levels to achieve their short-sighted\nWith the creation of the Midwest region in 1963 and the\n12 state structures in 1967, new TV stations were established\nin those states. This was given impetus with the proposed host-\ning of the Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture\n(FESTAC) in 1977. Color TV transmission was introduced\nfirst at Benue Plateau Television, Jos, in July 1974. Other\nstates' TV stations took off accordingly: Rivers State TV\nwere nine television stations in Nigeria. The First World Black\nand African Festival of Arts and Culture (FESTAC '77) also\nmade it possible for the television in Nigeria to acquire a\nDomestic Satellite System (DOMSAT) to improve transmis-\nsion and networking that took effect in April 1976. Apart from\nthis acquisition, funding improved, with the consequent acqui-\nsition of hard and software broadcast materials.\nThe establishment of the Broadcasting Organizations of\nNigeria (BON) earlier in 1973 contributed to improve and\nestablish more coordinated broadcasting. Formed as a child\nof necessity at the instance of Christopher Kolade, then\nDirector-General of Nigerian Broadcasting Corporation\n(NBC), the members, made up of all regional and state sta-\ntions, wanted to present a common front at a West German\norganized seminar on broadcasting in Nigeria. The new orga-\nnization now served as a platform for exchange of profes-\nsional advice, programming, and programs, as well as\npersonnel exchange, and so on. This also initiated the televi-\nThe Federal Government in April 1976 annexed state-\nowned TV stations that are now about 19 in number. This\nauthoritarian move was to stem their proliferation, make for\nincreased central coordination, and enhance program\nexchange and networking as well as promote unity. The first\nnetwork program was telecasted on April 1, 1976 from\nNBC-TV in Lagos. Even though this system created its own\neditorial management problems due to diverse cultural dif-\nferences, it forged some mythical ancestral fireside oneness\namong Nigerians through its network news, which, however,\nremains government-centered, manipulative, politically par-\ntisan, and serving more of the ends of leadership than that of\nthe people (Nwuneli, 1985). This happens most often in\nmomentous events like mass protests, strikes, or unpopular\nelections, which pitch the people against the government.\nProbably due to the authoritarian control of state-owned\nmedia through legislation, appointments of chief executive\nofficers and funding are done by central and state\ngovernments.\nThe NTA was established in May 1977 through its\n(1998), the Decree gave NTA monopoly over broadcasting\njust like it was with Radio as it stated that \"[t]he Authority\nshall, to the exclusion of any other broadcasting authority or\nany person in Nigeria, be responsible for television broad-\ncasting\" (p. 115). It was also established to carry out the\nduties of providing \"public service in the interest of Nigeria,\nindependent and impartial television broadcasting\" for\nNigeria, and emphasizing the unity in diversity of its cul-\ntures, but with a duty to the federal government. The Decree\nalso provided for the zoning system with a zonal manage-\nment structure. The six-zone structure was politically moti-\nvated to cater for the diverse national cultures and grassroot\ncoverage and networking, with zonal headquarters in Lagos,\nBenin, Enugu, Kaduna, Maiduguri, and Sokoto. Section\n11(1) specifically obliges NTA to broadcast government pro-\ngrams and announcements at its own expense and whenever\nrequested by an \"authorized officer,\" in the public services of\nthe Federation as may be declared by the President or gover-\nnor of a state. This also includes a provision that theAuthority\nshall broadcast materials from an \"authorized public officer\"\nprovision makes television and radio the first port of call for\npower-hungry coup plotters in Nigeria as well as popular\nmedia for political abuse by the so-called democratic\nleadership.\nThis monopoly and centralization of broadcast service on\nNTA were unpopular with state governments who felt disem-\npowered by the central government. The Constituent\nAssembly sitting in 1978 returned to the states the rights to\nown broadcast stations, enshrining it in the 1979 Constitution\n(Section 26(2)).

In spite of\nNTA's house codes on electioneering responsibilities, the\ndepths of abuse as even NTA personnel rights were threat-\nened with flagrant political interference and domination by\nalso acted irresponsibly in consort with the political and rul-\ning party leadership of the time. Interestingly, Nigerian TV\nand other media acted as true watchdogs during the 2010\ngeneral elections, which validated Goodluck Jonathan's\npresidency. State media performance in Nigeria, therefore,\nbecomes a barometric test for the disposition of political\nleadership.\nAs a result of all these political manipulations, the states\nbegan to establish their state-owned stations. This was to\ncounteract the NTA stations that had been installed in all the\nstates of the federation, thus demonstrating Maduka's (1998)\nobservation that the reason for establishment of TV stations\nin Nigeria have always been politically motivated, far and\nremoved from the professed inherited roles of education,\ninformation and entertainment that BBC public service\nbroadcasting means. Meanwhile, the cyclical and reactive\ndevelopment in the media continued.\nBy 1983, with the abortion of the Second Republic, the\neconomy had been vandalized and run-aground by the\nNational Party of Nigeria (NPN) political class; the cost of\nrunning NTA became too high and NTA was running at a\ndeficit. The new interventionist Muhammadu Buhari gov-\nernment cut down on subvention, and NTA stations were\nasked to commercialize in line with the administration's\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF)\u00adengineered austerity\nmeasures. This development took its toll on the quality of\njournalism and programming on television, thus proving as it\nwere that \"intense commercialization\" could not cohabit\nThe Buhari administration promoted a national re-orienta-\ntion through radio and television (through his War Against\nIndiscipline), promulgated the draconian Decrees 4 and 7\n(Public Officers Protection Against False Accusation Decree\nand Detention of Persons Decree), and finally abrogated the\nNTA Zonal structure.\nThe latter action was based on the recommendations of\nthe Christopher Kolade Committee set up in 1984 to consider\nrationalizing the NTA. Part of the committee's recommenda-\ntions was the two-tier public service model, whereby \"state-\nownedtelevision(was)lefttocarryonwiththecommunication\neffort and mobilization at grassroot level while NTA concen-\nnoteworthy that a management structure that encourages the\ndevelopment of professional policy and the government's\napproach to media regulation reveals what that government\nexpects from or how it views its citizenry as well as its atti-\ntude to power.\nAccording to Lasode (1994), Ibrahim Babangida's admin-\nistration embarked on seven government policies, which\ndirectly influenced the development of Television (and radio)\nin Nigeria. These policies included the abrogation of Decree\n2 of 1984, the Structural Adjustment Program (SAP),\nTransition to Civil Rule Program, Mass Mobilization for\nSocial and Economic Reconstruction and Recovery\nof the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1990), and later, the\nderegulation of broadcast industry.\nThese programs again needed the popular promotion and\nsupport from the media as a way of getting legitimacy and\nsupport from the people.

It was a creation that sought to diversify the\nairwaves as a way of providing access for other voices and\nviews, which are excluded by a commercialized broadcast\nmedia. Public service broadcasting, considered as an inven-\ntion of the British BBC, is designed to be a nonprofit broad-\ncasting organization that is operated through public funds\nfrom taxation. Like the BBC, it is charged with the duty of\nproviding \"information, education and entertainment,\" in the\npublic interest, even though it becomes problematic to define\nthe content of the term \"public good\" (Media Network on the\nHowever, the trusteeship model of broadcasting aims at\ncatering for a \"pluralist society\" with a commitment to the\nbasic tenet that \"radio and TV have specific civic functions\nand not simply ways of selling programming or commodities\nming is basically aimed at informing and enriching the lis-\ntener and viewer. But to meet these public or social\nobligations, some basic conditions have to be met by the\norganization and the government that run this system on\nbehalf of its people. These conditions include a secure\nmethod of finance, a strong broadcasting organization with\nfreedom of programming, a commitment by the organization\nto universal coverage, and a regulated system (of manage-\nment) designed to encourage the media practitioners to take\nboth cultural and political risks (Hutchinson, 1999). Other\nreputable national public service televisions with a reason-\nable degree of public service content and structure include\nSouth Africa's South African Broadcasting Corporation\n(SABC), India's Doordarshan, Iran's Press TV, Germany's\nDeutschwelle TV (DWTV), and Canada's Canadian\nBroadcasting Network (CBN).\nEven though the Nigeria Broadcasting Service was fash-\nioned after the BBC, and the many enabling acts, decrees, or\nedicts were to provide broadcasting services for the new\nplural entity called Nigeria, Maduka observes that the\ngive specific guidelines on the media's involvement in the\npromotion of Nigerian cultural values and entertainment, but\nrather concentrated more on news, politics, and other contro-\nversial matters. To complicate this scenario, commercializa-\ntion, politics, and its propagandist tendencies, systemic\nproblems of state-appointed managements have posed great\nchallenges on the NTA in the discharge of its functions in\nNigeria. Because most media enabling laws in Nigeria were\ncrafted during military regimes, government control of the\nnation's public media is very visibly authoritarian (Media\nIn spite of this apparent debilitating scenario newly com-\npounded by a deregulated broadcasting market, Yaya\nAbubakar (1998), erstwhile Director-General of Voice of\nNigeria (VON), notes that public service broadcasting in\nNigeria has played a remarkable positive role over the years:\nThese stations bridge distances and cross language barriers, and\nmobilize rural masses for development. They also provide an\nexciting platform for political communication and debate;\npromote local culture; provide the medium for educational\nbroadcasting, stimulate national dialogue and consensus; as well\nas providing the market place for locally produced goods and\nThe hyper-capitalism of media globalization has chal-\nlenged the practice of public service broadcasting in its pure\nform. Beyond this, media globalization with its tradition of\npenetrative, market-driven trans-national media practice has\nlike Buridan's ass placed the management of public service\nbroadcasting organizations between two opposite attractions:\nthe nobility of public service broadcasting and the capitalisti-\ncally attractive though relentless pull of market-driven\nbroadcasting.\nIt is noteworthy that even the BBC, the grand model of\npublic service broadcasting, has gone through this chequered\nthreat of restructuring due to changing political dispositions,\ncut funding, and the new challenge of the digital information\nrevolution. But the BBC management responded through\ninnovative programming, creation of advertising-financed\nchannels, and the commercial-driven BBC Worldwide, and\nlike the Indian TV Doordarshan, created more local language\nstations all over the world.\nThe Indian Doordarshan example is a rather unique model\nof television broadcasting. The corporation, which also\ninherited the BBC model, was deliberately designed to serve\nnot only the ends of state hierarchies but also for the uplift-\nment of the people in furtherance of an economic national-\nism,whichthethenMinisterofInformationandBroadcasting,\nSushma Swaraj, called \"swadeshi\" (Fernandez, 2000,\np. 624). Indian TV broadcasting system combines the best\ntradition of BBC public service and American market-driven\nbroadcasting, but within a regional protectionist policy.\nAccording to Chin (2003) \"even though transnational media\npose a challenge to a national media system and culture, the\n6 SAGE Open\nlocal state still plays a crucial role in regulating domestic\ncultural policies and guiding the development of broadcast-\ning\" (p. 17). This goes further to show that developing econ-\nomies can and should tailor their media systems to fit their\ndevelopment contexts.\nThe South African SABC picture shows an equally com-\npetitive television environment that has leap-frogged into the\nInformation Technology Age as though to make up for the\nlost years of apartheid. The liberalism and commercialism\nthat drive the independent cable/satellite and terrestrial\nbroadcasting sectors is equally matched with a determined,\npolicied, multi-channel national public service broadcaster\n(SABC-TV). The software and content infiltration from the\nWest and its consequent dissemination over the African con-\ntinent appear to be taken for granted by the South African TV\nregulators and managers, because of the belief that South\nAfrica's integration into the world economy will strengthen\nher international bargaining power, even at the expense of\nweaker African countries. In essence, therefore, the type of\nbroadcasting system a nation prefers would depend on what\nfunction is expected of the media as well as the nation's eco-\nnomic and cultural orientation.\nGlobal Influences and TV Programming\nin Nigeria\nSchupman identifies the threefold purpose of broadcasting to\nbe the \"maintenance, extension and transmission of a cul-\nture\"; even though broadcasting concerns itself with emer-\ngent values, it \"must concern itself even more with those\ntransmitted values without which no society can achieve\ncontinuity and stability\" (Peigh, 1979, p. 9). Programming is\nthe art of planning, producing, promoting, and placement of\na program package for broadcast in a broadcasting station. It\ninvolves the planning and identification of values and the\npackaging and transmission of those values to a critical audi-\nence. Unlike production per se, programming is a cardinal\nmanagement function in any television establishment, even\nthough the actual spade work is done by the producer who is\na line person in the establishment. A program, which is the\nend product of programming, according to the NBC Code is\na unified presentation on radio, television, or cable retrans-\nmission that occupies a distinct period with a beginning and\nThe evolution of programming in the Nigerian broadcast-\ning industry, like the broadcasting organizations themselves,\nhas a chequered history.

Farounbi notes that\ntelevision at this stage could not be said to be serving any definable\nnational interest . . .

Maduka notes the \"professionalism\" of the\n1990s but bewails the endangered species of serious devel-\nopmental programming driven under by commercialized\nbroadcasting. \"The trend with independents (producers),\" he\nsays, \"permeates of freshness, competition and merit. It is\nalso opening up the medium to anyone who has a claim,\"\nadding that it is \"clearly a movement in the direction of\nProgramming for any effective developmental broadcast-\ning is a painstaking management process, which requires\nresearch into media habits, socio-statistics, and the cultural\nenvironment of the target niche audience, as well as their\nopinions and biases concerning the content of the communi-\ncation. This process becomes necessary if a two-way collab-\norative communication is desired, a situation where\n\"everyone generates information (and) everyone receives\ninformation\" away from the prevalent medium abuse where\npolitical leaders promote a \"manipulative one way form of\ncommunication\" in clear breach of the NBC Code stipula-\ntions and the political leaders' oaths of office. This abuse is\nmost prevalent among state-owned stations, which are\ninvariably treated as extensions of the states' Ministries of\nInformation and Public Relations, and not public establish-\nments kept alive by tax-payers' money (cf. \"The Good, the\nBad & the Bungling,\" 2003; \"Whose Voices, Their Master's\nor the Peoples?\" 2003). It is interesting to note that during\nthe January 2012 mass protests against Goodluck Jonathan\ngovernment's removal of petroleum subsidy, NTA and state\nTV were clearly on the side of government: spreading propa-\nganda, under-reporting, misreporting events, or running\ndown labor and civil rights personalities, while the private\nstations like African Independent Television (AIT) and\nChannels TV provided more balanced stories to the admira-\ntion of audiences. Even the blood-letting activities of the\nIslamist group Boko Haram are hardly reported by public TV\nin Nigeria; all these in the name of what state media would\ncall developmental journalism.\nMaduka notices that even though broadcasting laws in\nNigeria are modeled after state controlled public trusteeship\nmodel, the stations' programming still gets dominated by\nnews, politics, and other controversial matters with little\nattention to Nigerian cultures, values, and indigenous enter-\ntainment, concluding that over the years, television has been\nrun \"as a free-wheeling medium, without any clear-cut objec-\ntives\" (Ukoha, 2000, p. 9). This lack of clear-cut policy and\nprogramming direction stands out when one compares NTA\nwith public service stations like Iran's Press TV and India's\nDoordarshan, which appear more objective in their news\nreporting.\nDespite increased programming and the presence of inde-\npendent production, commercialization and market-driven\nmedia altered the content of local programming, abolished\nand re-introduced the former zonal administrative structures,\nbrought about rationalization and multi-skilling in NTA and\nother TV stations. With deregulation and the entry of private\nbroadcasters, the motives for most private or some public\nlicensees have become more commercial, political, and often\npersonal. One clearly sees a predominance of commercial\nand pure-entertainment programs over development pro-\ngrams that have local cultural relevance. Even a public ser-\nvice network like NTA has come under great stress for the\nabove reason. While NTA headquarters in Abuja and Lagos\ndo fairly well, network stations are left to their wits to fill up\nairtime with cheap commercial and tele-evangelical pro-\ngrams without consideration for the commercial viability of\ntheir local environments. Where there is local production, the\nstations design their programs after western global \"formats\nthat sell\" like game-shows, pure entertainment and so-called\nactuality programs that ape the Big Brother phenomenon.\nThis tendency negatively affects the creativity of well-mean-\ning local producers and artists who still bother about local\ncultural content beyond postmodern market-oriented pro-\nIn the Nigerian broadcasting environment, the following\nfactors, events, and happenings have been contributory to\nshaping the development of television form and program-\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Like South Africa's SABC and India's Doordarshan,\nthe beginning of broadcasting in these colonial out-\nposts grew out of the need for imperial Britain (BBC)\nto connect with its colonies abroad. This expansion\nand program syndication were achieved through a re-\ndistribution or \"wire service\" located at the \"bridge-\nhead\" of the colony in Lagos in the case of Nigeria.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 The formation of the Broadcasting Organization of\nNigeria (BON) in 1972 facilitated subsequent net-\nworking, which improved programming quality, shar-\ning of management, and professional techniques\n(Maduka, 1998). This also applies to later deregula-\ntion days' networking like the defunct State-Owned\nBroadcasting Organizations of Nigeria (SOBON) and\nthe many independent TV and radio production guilds.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 The nation's hosting of international festivals like the\nAll Africa Games in 1973, as well as All Black and\nAfrican Festival of Arts and Culture (FESTAC '77),\n2009 somehow stimulated the content of TV broad-\ncasting industry. The impact on TV form and pro-\ngramming came through corporate sponsorship and\nlocal funding for infrastructural upgrading/develop-\nment in the media houses to enhance competence and\ncoverage, as well as skills sharing and transfer\nbetween national and international content producers.\nThe aborted Miss World Beauty Pageant in 2002 due\nto Muslim religious riots in Northern Nigeria also pro-\nduced similar multiplier benefits because some media\nestablishments were upgraded to global standards to\nmeet the challenge of providing coverage for the\nbeauty contest. Maduka (1998) considers this phe-\nnomenon as a symbiotic growth between the arts,\nsports, and the broadcast media.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 There has been some form of collaboration between\nthe TV in Nigeria and foreign media and development\norganizations and governments. Some of these include\nthe German Deutschwelle TV, former West German\ngovernment, Mitchell Beazley Television, and Greater\nWashington Educational Television Association\n(NETA). Other influences and collaborations include\nCommonwealth Broadcasting Organization, BBC-\nWorld Service Trust, Population Communication\nInternational (PCI)/Media Impact, United Nations\nChildren's Fund (UNICEF), United States' Agency\nfor International Development (USAID), Planned\nParenthood Federation (PPFN), Department for\nInternational Development (DfID), and Canadian\nInternational Development Agency (CIDA), as well\nas the McArthur Foundation, United Nations\nDevelopment Program (UNDP), United Nations Aid\n(UNAID), Global HIV/AIDS Initiative in Nigeria\n(GHAIN), European Union-Support for Reforming\nInstitutions Program (EU/SRIP), and the Australian\nHigh Commission. These organizations, through pro-\ngram sponsorship and collaboration, have contributed\nto program output and quality as well as empowered\nlocal content providers through training, man power\ndevelopment using collaborative production and\ndonation of broadcast equipment. While one may\nwant to consider these foreign interventions with\nsome sense of gratitude, it is also discomforting that\nsometimes, these foreign bodies use the local media to\npropagate their national/cultural ideologies/hegemo-\nnies and fill up the gap created by the irresponsibility\nof local/national governments with foreign propa-\nganda programming.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Television has been part and parcel of propaganda and\ndevelopment programming in Nigeria. The many pro-\ngrams that administrations have used to legitimize\nand launder their images include Ethical Revolution,\nWar Against Indiscipline, Green Revolution, Mass\n8 SAGE Open\nMobilization for Social and Economic Reconstruction,\nExpanded Program on Immunization (EPI), National\nDirectorate on Employment (NDE), Rebranding\nNigeria Campaign, and National Orientation Agency/\nCampaign. Others include Women Trafficking and\nChild Labor Eradication Foundation (WOTCLEF),\nSubsidy Re-Investment Program (SURE-P), and of\ncourse what has become the goldmine of HIV/AIDS\nadvocacy. Because of their intrinsic government pro-\npaganda content, these programs attract very high\nbudgets but whose trickle down effects on the broad-\ncast media remain significant. The popular program\nformats that these government propaganda programs\nengender have remained some kind of contribution to\nthe programming history of television in Nigeria.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 There are also programs and television festivals that\nhave gingered the development of programming and\nproduction on Nigerian television. Through sheer\nmanagerial ingenuity, NTA network and BON initi-\nated and have continued to organize arts and televi-\nsion festivals that have become avenues for talent\nhunts and promotion of new program formats and cre-\nativity among content providers. Such festivals\ninclude Festival of Plays (begun in 1965), Television\nFestival (Telefest, first in 1979), and subsequently\nNigerian Festival of Television Programs, which have\nbeen held annually since 1985. Private broadcasters\nhave also made their contribution. The local BOB-TV\nProgram Expo among Nigerian universities' media\ndepartments have made significant impact on local\ncontent generation in the television industry. Today,\nthe national Abuja Cultural Carnival and the famous\nCarnival Calabar have not only engendered the devel-\nopment of the performing/promenade arts in Nigeria\nbut have also provided the raw materials for TV pro-\ngramming. This new-look form of carnival culture is\nhowever not indigenous to Nigeria. The Carnival\nCalabar for instance has a technical relationship with\nTrinidad & Tobago. There are also other sponsored\nbig-budget, long-running reality shows like the\n\"Gulder Ultimate Search\" and the \"Maltina Dance\nAll\"' TV shows sponsored by Nigerian Breweries,\nPlc. The \"Star Quest\" music talent hunt has also pro-\nduced new music stars as well as cloned content for\nTV programming in Nigeria.\nWith the deregulation of broadcasting in Nigeria, the birth\nof independent producers has enriched programming and\ncontent production in the industry. This development\nwould not have come without the in-house standards of\nprofessionalism and on-the-job training that forms part of\nthe personnel development policy of government oper-\nated public service television stations, especially NTA\nand FRCN. The Television College at Jos, which has cur-\nrently been upgraded to a degree awarding institution\n(with its Radio Nigeria training corollary in Lagos) has\nmade significant input to the broadcast industry. The pub-\nlic service tradition of training and retiring staff without\nconsideration for indispensability has seen many a trained\npersonnel out of job but who have joined the independent\nproducers' movement. In addition, the now fashionable\ndownsizing and rightsizing in 21st century media global-\nization era, and the poor working civil service conditions\ninvoked on broadcasters, have seen increased motility of\ntalent among producers who have joined the army of ear-\nlier brain-drained names like Laolu Oguniyi, Jab Adu,\nLola Fanikayode, Eddie Ogbonna, state-murdered Ken\nSaro Wiwa and Mabel Oboh, etc. It may not be far from\nthe truth that most producers who have now spawned new\nprivate stations and independent production companies\nare products of these public service mother stations.\nThis tendency has also seen the formation of trade\nguilds like the Independent Television Producers\nAssociation of Nigeria (ITPAN), and Frontline\nIndependent TelevisionAssociation of Nigeria (FITRAN).\nThe advent of deregulated broadcasting has also brought\nabout the formation of other guilds like the Motion\nPictures Practitioners Council of Nigeria (MPPCN) with\nall its other composite guilds. The many productions of\nthese guilds have no doubt enriched local content creation\nin television broadcasting in Nigeria; as well as encour-\naged professionalism, standardization, networking and\nprofessional discipline. However, this may not be said of\nreturn-on-talent for their members in view of the rampant\nacquisition of programmes' composite rights by global\ncable companies and the prevalence of digital technolo-\ngies, which have encouraged piracy of local creative out-\nput. Cheap pirated DVDs contain as many as twenty home\nmovies; in the same way as cable TV stations float whole\nprogrammes like \"Africa Magic,\" Nollywood, etc, which\nplay Nigerian movies continually round the clock, with\nlittle returns-on-talents at home.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Despite shortcomings that border on cultural imperi-\nalism, deregulation/commercialization of television\nbroadcasting (handmaids of media globalization) has\nalso affected Nigerian television content creation. It\nwill be recalled that following Christopher Kolade's\nreport on commercialization in 1987, the Babangida\nregime drastically reduced government subvention\nstations had been shut down, while the rest, NTA sta-\ntions and state-owned stations, started commercial\ndrives. This in a way made the stations to become for\nthe first time more innovative in programming, even\nas it signaled the death-wish for public service broad-\ncasting. Profit motive became privileged over public\nservice as commercial programming increased\nthrough the sale of airtime, spots, sponsorships, and\ncommercial news coverage. In spite of all these, tele-\nvision at both national and state levels has remained\nunder the bureaucracy of the Ministry of Information\nand Culture.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 New developments in satellite communication tech-\nnology and media globalization have also affected TV\nprogramming and production. This phenomenon has\nmade it possible for broadcasting organizations, espe-\ncially for satellite and cable re-broadcasting stations,\nto access the stream of programming on global chan-\nnels. These signals are re-broadcast to subscribers,\nand even on terrestrial channels owned by state/gov-\nernments. Sophos argues that with the deregulated\nmedia of the 1980s, new networks evolved that were\n\"designed to provide subscribing stations with twenty-\nfour hour a day programming formats delivered in\nhigh fidelity stereo via satellite\". One such was erst-\nwhile South African content provider TV-Africa,\nwhose activities were promptly arrested by NBC in\nview of the many illegalities in their contractual oper-\nations with Nigerian TV stations. Other commonly\nsyndicated global and regional transnational media\ncontent providers include BBC World, DW-TV, Cable\nNews Network (CNN), FOX TV, and British Satellite\nTV. Today, Multichoice/MNet's Channel-O and local\ncontent music providers: Nigezee and ProudlyAfrican\ndominate the airwaves with foreign and local clones\nof western hip-hop culture.\nIn the same way as these digitized media facilitate content\ndistribution, the problem of piracy and monitoring have\nalso quadrupled. This development in digital technology\nhas in some way also spawned the pervasive Big Brother\ntemplate of reality shows, where like the American\n\"McDonalization\" of junk fast food, the Big Brother for-\nmat has become a global franchise; a practice that pro-\nmotes a tradition whereby the mass medium of television\nhas been reduced to a cultural apparatus for the mass pro-\nduction of what Turner calls \"celetoids,\" defined as the\nstudio production of celebrities from \"ordinary people\"\noutside the circle of the \"famous\" (2006).\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 The introduction and popularization of the global sys-\ntem of mobile telephony and its convergence in\nInternet and other computer-mediated communication\nhave also influenced content generation and packag-\ning in the Nigerian television industry. Multi-media\nproduction and interactive two-way broadcasting\nhave been enhanced even though with mixed conse-\nquences. The evolution of citizenship journalism\nthrough social media networks, using mobile hand-\nheld devices, has in some ways enriched broadcast\ncontent with less gatekeeping and monitoring. While\nthis trend has frustrated state-owned media like NTA\nand others who traditionally tailor news stories to suit\ntheir paymasters, the masses' participation and right\nto know and talk-back have been strengthened. While\ninteractive programming on both radio and TV\nbecomes commonly abused, down-loading and up-\nloading of satellite/Internet media fare have also\nbecome common, as well as increased cloning of\ncheap commercial-oriented formats. This scenario has\ncreated an ongoing discourse in media chat rooms\nabout media democratization and the need for respon-\nsible journalism.\nThe consequences of the foregoing on TV programming\nand production are obvious in the increased number of inde-\npendent producers, increased number of television stations,\nincreased AM-broadcasting with ever increasing number and\npopularity of telethon programs and programming. There is\nalso increased and more balanced news reporting on public\nservice NTA due to the influx of competing private broad-\ncasters who have liberated Nigerians from the surfeit of\n\"government say so news,\" and unfair and nonbalanced\nnews reporting (Uyo, 2000, p. 24). This credit hardly extends\nto \"state-owned\" public TV stations who still degradingly\nabuse these stations as propaganda outfits for state governors\nand ruling parties much to the alienation of the citizenry.\nBut Salihu (2002), an NBC broadcast monitor, concludes\nthat \"essentially, however, whether privately or government-\nowned, broadcasting is still largely its master's voice . . . as\nthe question of true independence is in fact the biggest chal-\nlenge before Nigerian broadcasting today\" (p. 154). Moreover,\nTV screens have continued to pander to western consumerist\nvalues, while entertainment has \"surrendered more or less to\nforeign programmes that have little or no redeeming values as\nappears to be a dearth of indigenous comedy on our TV sta-\ntions and the emergence of some unholy marriage between\nTV and home videos (VHS), which have tended to dwell\nmore on occultism and superstition with melodramatic plots\non the ill-informed belief that that is what the audiences want.\nTV stations and content providers have failed to understand\nthat the content provider creates and deserves the audiences\nthey have through the mass pacification process.\nTV programming and production have been besieged by a\nmyriad of interlocking problems. From all indications, there\nis an abundance of imaginative program producers in Nigeria\ntoday, but these also must depend on the \"simultaneous\navailability of performing, writing and production talent and\nproduction facilities\" (Akpan, 1994, p. 87). Such facilities\ninclude what Nigerian producers go to South Africa to access\nlike the (Sasani) studios, equipment, and technical crews, as\nwell as Nigeria's God-given variegated scenery from the\nAtlantic coast to the Sahara desert, and the multiple tradi-\ntions and colorful costumes of 400 ethnic cultures.\nOther challenges include the paucity of script-writers and\ninformed directors who are not necessarily market- but\nart-driven, and lack of corporate sponsorship. There is also\nthe preponderance of foreign and free-to-air cable tele-evan-\ngelical programs, which get aired with the false assumption\nthat they are free-to-air, but which actually carry heavily\nembedded western consumerist values that socialize\nNigerians the wrong way. The low motivation of govern-\nment-employed TV producers and hard-to-come-by sponsor-\nship encourage this over-dependence on foreign programs\nthat are of course cheaper and easier to acquire than local\nculturally relevant productions.\nThe continued attachment of federal/state-owned TV sta-\ntions to Ministries of Information constitutes a cog in the\nsmooth functioning of stations' programming and produc-\ntion. The creative artist cannot achieve professionalism with\nthe strictures of civil service whose goals are not those of\ncreative culture. The bureaucracy that guides approvals,\nunpredictability and changes in appointments and funding\ncreate discontinuity in programming. Other complications of\nthis situation include politicization of personnel recruitment\nand remuneration as well as equipment acquisition.\nMinistries' boardrooms recruit staff and personnel and\nacquire equipment on behalf of stations; most of which turn\nout to be unusable. The civil service attachment has also con-\ntributed to the high motility of staff from public stations to\nthe private ones (who do not provide security of tenure any-\nway). Incidentally, the silver lining behind this staff motility\nphenomenon is that public stations have become training\ngrounds for the industry as most of the staff in private sta-\ntions and independent markets passed through these public\nstations. This can be considered as some kind of silent fulfill-\nment of the public service personnel development calling of\npublic TV in Nigeria.\nOther Local Impacts\nEven though TV \"bends blurs and blends\" (apologies to\nGerbner), its impact is relative. It is obvious from the forego-\ning narrative of TV's history in Nigeria that television has\nmade various prismatic impacts because there are different\nmedia environments. Beyond the multiplication of stations,\nwhich the global phenomenon of deregulation has engen-\ndered, one doubts whether such fragmentation has equaled\naccess to media for the alienated rural dwellers that neither\nhave electricity to watch TV nor even get the signal.\nConsequently, well-placed persons in both urban and rural\nareas resort to patronizing satellite TV as terrestrial TV is out\nof reach or nonexistent; Nigeria provides the biggest market\nfor cable television regional corporations like Multichoice.\nOn the other hand, urban or metropolitan areas are suf-\nfused with TV stations, which fight and glut public space for\nniche audiences. But what is the content that they trade with\nadvertisers for these populations in the developing world?\nAdvertising admittedly provides the cash for the stations.\nBut what about the ostensible or subliminal values that\nadvertising carries? This is why arrowheads of\nmedia globalization shop for cultural converts to sell western\nconsumerist and cultural values. A 2009 study by this author\nshows the ignorance or unpreparedness of our media manag-\ners to manage media globalization due principally to the\nmanagers' inclination to see the world from the perspective\nof their pay-masters, who obviously are in business to make\nmoney. Government in Nigeria perceives globalization as an\nelixir of development without its post-industrial imperialism\nwith all its baggage (cf. Betiang, 2009). At the moment, sta-\ntions nationwide are struggling to digitize to meet global\nmedia 2015 digital migration standards which the country\ncannot input into but must comply, as nations must live or die\nby global standards.\nFrom inception in Nigeria, TV has existed for the subver-\nsive use of political leadership against the people it pretends\nto represent. NTA and public service stations in the states\nthat are terrestrial and actually have grassroots coverage\noften behave like hegemonic extensions of government. The\nprivate stations in the bid to win the people over to them-\nselves become sensational, consumerist, and nucleating\naround high-population urban zones. Their adventurous pro-\ngramming accounts for the high rate of NBC breaches com-\nmitted by these stations (Udekwu, 2002). Walter Ofonagoro\n(2002), former NTA's DG and Minister of Information\nrightly noted that \"in Nigeria, there is a strong co-relation\nbetween the posture of those in control of the media and the\nprofessional performance of their workers\" (p. 26).\nWhile the economic impact cannot be quantified in an\narticle of this scope, one can look at it from the point of view\nof the global media players, the regional media representa-\ntives, the public service stations, and the private-owned sta-\ntions. Because one cannot be privy to their annual statements\nof accounts, it can only be said that TV broadcasting is a\ncapital intensive venture, which one dares say has capital\nintensive returns, especially in this information age where\ninformation is power. The cost of public TV cannot be quan-\ntified. For instance, what is the real cost or opportunity cost\nof installing and running three politically motivated NTAsta-\ntions littered in almost each of the 90 senatorial districts of\nthe country? The drain on the economy in terms of imported\nbroadcast software, hardware, and overheads can only be\nimagined.\nCulturally relevant local programs like Village\nHeadmaster, Ichoku, Samanja, Mirror in the Sun, Cock Crow\nat Dawn, Nigerian Dances, and Food Basket, Master Mind,\nAdio Family, and Checkmate that ruled the airwaves have\ndisappeared. The reasons are not unconnected to the ever-\npresent commercialization drive, now cheaper foreign pro-\ngrams that have come with satellite and media digitization,\nthe dearth of cultural-minded sponsors and banks that do not\nunderstand the need to provide credit facilities for local con-\ntent production; and probably, the ever-present Nigerian\nhome video. This also invites one to question as to what real\ncultural values our Nigerian TV stations promote beyond\nmaterialism, consumerism, and magic quick-fix methods of\nmaking money which inundate Nigerian airwaves. Neo-\nPentecostal material-minded pastors preach on open air-\nwaves on prosperity that amounts to sanctification of crime;\na phenomenon that was not there in the early days of TV. The\nfamily with its values has been sacrificed on the altar of con-\nsumerist-minded television (cf. Didigu, 2002).\nThe real impact of TV can therefore be perceived if broad-\ncast managers and content providers contemplate the manner\nof children and future they hope to create through TV pro-\ngramming. This tendency is worsened by the paucity of com-\nmunity media, which have the potentialities to counterbalance\nthese new consumerist values and political-economic hege-\nmonies. Even though the family belt is being re-introduced\non NTA, not much is done about other purveyors of TV con-\ntent. The TV content monitor in contemporary Nigeria needs\nto broaden his/her periscope to go beyond mere classifica-\ntion and exhibition, because the content that media global-\nization technology avails through the airwaves and the open\nmarket needs re-consideration.\nConclusion\nThis critical, rather celebratory view of 50 years of TV in\nNigeria examined its brief history, public service dimension\nand programming and the subtle \"modernizing\" influences\nthat have aided its development. These influences and experi-\nences of some public TV managers show how little of deliber-\nate developmental policy there is in public TV broadcasting\nand its management. It also shows how much the Industry has\nrelied on developing itself through reactive responses to global\nchallenges and prompting from international corporate media,\ninternational NGOs, and other extra-governmental organiza-\ntions. There is the need to develop the hardware or form of TV\nin Nigeria along with the issues of content. Dependency theo-\nrists suggest that one major way of throwing off this syndrome\nis to \"have some self-sufficiency in the realm of information,\nour traditional national dependence on outsiders' prompting\nfor both form and content. This is because the new convergent\nTV promises potentialities for more damaging reconfiguration\nof our ethnic and national cultures and psyches through its\nnew soft imperialism.\nWhile the drive for independent production has geared up\nin recent times, independent content producers should have\nbetter ways of exhibiting their works other than the current\npractice where regional cable providers buy up their works\nand rights. Government can persuade the Committee of\nBankers to include the culture industries in their Small and\nMedium Industries Equity Investment Schemes (SMIES),\nwhile we await the emergence of culture-dedicated banks in\nthe country.\nGovernment could also strive to achieve universal access\nto TV media through encouraging educational and public\nservice broadcasting. It is not enough to expand the industry\nalong commercially determined lines. Instead of fragmenta-\ntion of stations, public service stations could establish dedi-\ncated channels, like the South African SABC, which may be\nwholly commercial, news, and entertainment, indigenous\nlanguages to make for easier management and reach within a\ncompetitive media environment. A deliberate policy on the\nmanagement of globalizing media, in the manner of India's\nDoordarshan, could also provide a policy direction for the\nindustry.\nFinally, the need to fully latch into the Internet web-cast-\ning age is overdue. Content production and distribution\nshould begin to explore cyberspace as another platform for\nconquest and content dissemination. While this will engen-\nder the acquisition of digital literacy, and digital policing on\nthe part of monitors, it will also expand media access. Above\nall, in the midst of this media quagmire, media advocates and\nactivists, as well as departments of theatre and media studies\nshould begin to include media literacy and social media prac-\ntice and management in their curricula as a way of strength-\nening viewers against local/global subliminal manipulations\nof television broadcasting hegemonies.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAbubakar, Y.
