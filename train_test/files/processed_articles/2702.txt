These types of error can lead to biased\nestimates and erroneous conclusions if they are not understood and addressed. The National\nCrime Victimization Survey (NCVS) is a nationally representative rotating panel survey with\nseven waves measuring property and violent crime victimization. Because not all crime is\nreported to the police, there is no gold standard measure of whether a respondent was\nvictimized. For panel data, Markov Latent Class Analysis (MLCA) is a model-based approach\nthat uses response patterns across interview waves to estimate false positive and false negative\nclassification probabilities typically applied to complete data.\nThis article uses Full Information Maximum Likelihood (FIML) to include respondents\nwith partial information in MLCA. The impact of including partial respondents in the MLCA\nis assessed for reduction of bias in the estimates, model specification differences, and\nvariability in classification error estimates by comparing results from complete case and\nFIML MLCA models. The goal is to determine the potential of FIML to improve MLCA\nestimates of classification error. While we apply this process to the NCVS, the approach\ndeveloped is general and can be applied to any panel survey.\nKey words: Survey error; full information maximum likelihood; measurement error; Markov\nlatent class analysis; national crime victimization.\n1. Introduction\nSocial and behavior science researchers often collect data using questionnaires or\ninstruments consisting of items that purport to measure some underlying construct that is\ndifficult to measure accurately. For example, it is well known that employment status is\ndifficult to measure because it relies on misunderstood concepts such as \"looking for\nwork,\" \"temporary layoff\" versus \"job termination,\" \"temporary work\" versus \"permanent\nemployment,\" and so on (see Biemer 2004). Employment classifications are typically\nbased on responses to a series of questions that must be combined to categorize an\nindividual as \"employed,\" \"unemployed,\" or \"not in the labor force.\" Because of the fine\nq Statistics Sweden\nsedwards@rti.org\nberzofsky@rti.org\n3 RTI International, 3040 East Cornwallis Road, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709, U.S.A.
