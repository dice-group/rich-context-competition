In order to achieve this goal, considerable\neffort has been spent developing and promoting the adop-\ntion of both international and domestic legal prohibitions of\ntorture. The efforts to promote both international and\ndomestic torture bans have largely been successful. In fact,\nagainst Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading\nTreatment or Punishment (CAT), and 157 countries had\nincluded torture prohibitions in their constitutions.1\nThe empirical scholarship testing the effectiveness\nof these international and domestic torture prohibitions,\nhowever, has produced mixed results. For example, stud-\nies testing the impact of the CAT have alternatively found\nthat ratification of the treaty is associated with increased\ntorture rates (Hafner-Burton and Tsutsui, 2005; Hathaway,\neven that it is associated with decreases in torture rates\nof constitutional torture prohibitions have both found that\nthey have had no effect on torture rates (Chilton and\nthey are associated with decreases in state repression (Hill\nPart of the reason that this line of scholarship has pro-\nduced conflicting results is that there are a number of sub-\nstantial barriers to inference that make it difficult to assess\nthe effectiveness of these measures with observational data\nalone. One of these barriers is that countries' decisions to\nadopt international (Lupu, 2013) and domestic (Chilton\nand Versteeg, 2015) torture prohibitions are endogenous\nto their rights practices. Moreover, recent research has\nsuggested that a great deal of the data has been used to\nInternational law, constitutional\nlaw, and public support for torture\nAdam S Chilton and Mila Versteeg\n Keywords\nHuman rights, torture, international law, constitutional law, survey experiment, public opinion\nUniversity of Chicago Law School, USA\nUniversity of Virginia School of Law, USA\nCorresponding author:\nAdam S Chilton, University of Chicago Law School, 1111 East 60th\nEmail: adamchilton@uchicago.edu\nResearch Article\n2 Research and Politics \nmeasure rates of torture is biased because reporting stand-\nards have changed over time (Fariss, 2014). Finally, even\nif it were possible to overcome these barriers to inference,\nit would still be difficult to disaggregate the impact of\ninternational and domestic torture bans because countries\nfrequently adopt both forms of legal prohibitions (Chilton\nGiven these hurdles that observational research\ndesigns face, one increasingly common research strategy\nhas been to use experimental methods to test the mecha-\nnisms that have been theorized as ways that legal restric-\ntions may alter government behavior. More specifically,\nexperiments have been used to test whether explicit refer-\nences to international legal agreements results in changes\nin public support for policies that would violate these\ndemocracy is one of the mechanisms through which\ntorture prohibitions might matter (Simmons, 2009).\nSpecifically, it is possible that when the public is told that\ntorture violates the country's legal commitments, this\nincreases public disapproval of these practices. Although\nexperimental methods have their own limitations, they\ndo make it possible to design studies with high degrees\nof internal validity, and, as a result, provide a valuable\nsupplement to the evidence that can be produced by\nobservational studies.\nIn order to comparatively test the effectiveness of both\ninternational and domestic prohibitions on torture, we have\nconducted what we believe to be the first survey experi-\nment that simultaneously tests the effect of exposing\nrespondents to arguments about the status of international\nlaw and constitutional law. More specifically, we fielded a\nsurvey experiment to a nationally representative sample of\nadults in the United States that asked respondents whether\nthey supported the use of torture while randomly exposing\nsome respondents to arguments that torture violates inter-\nnational law or constitutional law (or both). We also built\non the limited prior research that has explored why argu-\nments about international law change public opinion\n(Chilton, 2014), and asked the respondents a series of six\nquestions designed to test the mechanisms that may have\nlead our treatments to change respondents' views.\nOur results are consistent with recent polling that sug-\ngests that a bare majority of Americans support the use of\ntorture. What is more, we found that presenting respond-\nents with the argument that torture violates international\nlaw did not produce a statistically significant decrease in\nsupport. Presenting respondents with the argument that\ntorture violates the constitution, however, lowered support\nfor torture by 4.6 percentage points (although the effect\nfalls just short of conventional levels of statistical signifi-\ncance). That said, the difference between our international\nlaw and constitutional law treatments was not itself\nstatistically significant. We do find a more substantial\neffect for the sub-group of our respondents that identified\nas Democrats. Yet, overall, our findings suggest that infor-\nmation on the status of neither international law nor consti-\ntutional law has a substantial effect on public support for\nthe use of torture.\nResearch design\nSubject recruitment\nWe administered our experiment to a nationally represent-\nexperiment was administered online, and Survey Sampling\nInternational (SSI) recruited the respondents. SSI is a\nresearch firm based in the United States that conducts sur-\nveys for corporate and academic research. Our sample\nwas specifically designed to be nationally representative\nof the US adult population based on gender, age, race, and\ncensus region.2\nExperimental design\nWe designed our experiment based on a survey used by\nWallace (2013) to explore the effect of commitments to\ninternational law on public support for the use of torture.\nWallace's survey used a vignette to explore whether\nrespondents expressed lower support for using torture to\ninterrogate captured enemy combatants when they were\nrandomly assigned to a group that was told that torture\nwould violate international law and was prohibited by trea-\nties the United States had signed. The strengths of Wallace's\nvignette are that it was designed to: (1) present a realistic\nscenario; (2) not bias support of torture in any direction; (3)\navoid inflammatory language; and (4) present a neutral\nstance of the effectiveness of torture (Wallace, 2013:\nAlthough our survey used Wallace's research as a start-\ning point, we made a number of substantial changes to his\nexperiment.3 Since Wallace's goal was to assess the effects\nof international law on public opinion, his vignette focused\non the use of torture to interrogate enemy combatants. For\nhis purposes, the interrogation of enemy combatants pro-\nvided a realistic scenario where respondents could be told\nthat the use of torture was prohibited by international law.\nSince our goal is to compare the relative effectiveness of\ninternational law and constitutional law, we needed a sce-\nnario that was clearly prohibited by both international law\nand the American constitution. The torture of enemy com-\nbatants, however, is not clearly prohibited by the constitu-\ntion.4 As a result, our vignette did not stipulate that the\npotential victims of torture where combatants from an\nopposing side. Instead, our vignette focused on a scenario\nwhere torture would plausibly be prohibited by both inter-\nnational and domestic law.5\nChilton and Versteeg 3\nMore specifically, we started our vignette by presenting\nall respondents with the following scenario: \"Throughout\nhistory, people have plotted to overthrow or sabotage the\ngovernment, and have resorted to the use of violent means\nto do so. Occasionally, the military captures people that are\nconspiring to overthrow or sabotage the government\nthrough violent means.\" The vignette then proceeded to say\nthat: \"[t]hese individuals may have information of interest\nabout the conspiracy, such as the location of other conspira-\ntors or plans for future attacks. Some government officials\nbelieve interrogating these people through a variety of\nmethods is a useful way to obtain this information.\"\nWe then introduced the possibility of torture by saying\nthat: \"[t]he interrogation methods could involve torture,\nmeaning they would cause severe pain or suffering to the\npeople they are used on.\" Moreover, we added that \"[t]he\ninformation may, or may not, be accurate or relevant to the\nconspiracy.\" After this, the respondents were randomly pre-\nsented with one of four treatment conditions. The four\ntreatments were as follows:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Control: (No further information.)\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Int'l Law: \"The interrogation methods would vio-\nlate international law. The United States has signed\ninternational treaties that do not allow the use of\nthese methods under any circumstances.\"\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Con. Law: \"The interrogation methods would vio-\nlate the constitution. The United States' Constitution\nincludes a provision that does not allow the use of\nthese methods under any circumstances.\"\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Combined: \"The interrogation methods would vio-\nlate the constitution and international law. The\nUnited States' Constitution includes a provision that\ndoes not allow the use of these methods under any\ncircumstances, and the United States has signed\ninternational treaties that do not allow the use of\nthese methods under any circumstances.\"6\nThe respondents in the Control group were not presented\nwith an argument about the legal status of the use of torture.\nThe inclusion of this control group gives us a baseline to\ncompare the subsequent treatment groups against.7 The\nrespondents in the Int'l Law group were presented with the\nargument that the use of these methods violates interna-\ntional law. The wording of this treatment condition is iden-\ntical to the international law treatment used by Wallace\n(2013). The respondents in the Con. Law group were pre-\nsented with the argument that the use of these methods vio-\nlates the constitution. This treatment condition was\ndesigned to be as similar to the Int'l Law group as possible\n(for example, the treatments include the same number of\nwords, tone, and sentence structure). Finally, respondents\nin the Combined group were presented with both argu-\nments. Offering some respondents both arguments\nallows us to evaluate whether there is an \"additive\" or\n\"substitution\" effect to being given both arguments\nAfter being presented with the vignette and one of the\nfour randomly assigned treatments, respondents were\nasked: \"[t]o what extent do you agree or disagree with the\nfollowing statement: The United States should use interro-\ngation methods involving torture on people that have plot-\nted to overthrow or sabotage the government.\" The\nrespondents were then asked to provide an answer on a six-\npoint scale that included the following options: (1) \"strongly\ndisagree\"; (2) \"disagree\"; (3) \"lean towards disagree\"; (4)\n\"lean towards agree\"; (5) \"agree\"; and (6) \"strongly agree.\"\nFollowing Wallace (2013), we converted these responses\ninto a binary variable for easier interpretation. Our results\nare substantively similar, however, when using the full six-\npoint response variable as the dependent variable.8\nBalance\nIn addition to presenting respondents with the vignette\ndescribed above, we also asked respondents a series of\ndemographic questions.9 Doing so not only allows us to\nconfirm that our respondents are nationally representative\nbased on their gender, age, race, and census region, but also\nallows us to ensure that the demographic characteristics of\nthe respondents in each of our treatment groups were bal-\nanced. To do so, we followed Chaudoin (2014) and used the\nbalance test from Hansen and Bowers (2008). Using this\ntest, the overall 2 statistic and the associated overall p-val-\ndemographic imbalance across our four treatment groups.\nResults\nPrimary results\nFigure 1 presents the primary results of our experiment.10\nSince we did not find any evidence of imbalance across our\nrandomly assigned treatments, Figure 1 simply reports the\nmean responses--and 90% confidence intervals (CIs)--for\neach of the four treatment groups.11 All of our results, how-\never, are substantively the same when estimated using\nregressions that control for the demographic characteristics\nof the respondents.12\nAs Figure 1 shows, respondents in the Control group\nwere on balance more likely to agree than disagree with\nthe use of torture. For the control group, the mean level of\nsupport for using torture against people that have plotted to\n54.7%). This number closely tracks the recent public poll-\ning on the use of torture: a 2011 Pew survey found that\n53% of Americans said that torture could often or some-\n4 Research and Politics \nCenter for Public Affairs Research survey found that 50%\nof Americans said that torture could often or sometimes be\nRespondents in the Int'l Law group had a mean response\nents given the international law treatment did express lower\nsupport for the use of torture than the control group, the\ndifference between the two groups is not statistically sig-\nnificant (p = 0.54). The respondents in the Con. Law group\nAlthough the difference between the Control group and the\nCon. Law group is not statistically significant at the 0.1\nlevel using the binary response variable (p = 0.14), it is sta-\ntistically significant when using the full six-point response\nvariable, albeit only at the 0.1 level (p = 0.08). That said,\nthe difference in support between the Int'l Law group and\nthe Con. Law group is not statistically different (p = 0.38).\nFigure 1 also reveals that the respondents in the\nCombined group had a mean response of 50.2% (90% CI:\nthan the mean response for the Control group (p = 0.77).\nMoreover, the Combined group--whose members were\npresented with both the international law and constitutional\nlaw treatments--were more supportive of torture than the\nrespondents that were given either just the international law\ntreatment or the constitutional law treatment. Since the dif-\nferences between the Combined group and the other treat-\nments are substantially small and far from statistically\nsignificant,15 we believe that it would be inappropriate to\nput much weight on them.\nIt is still interesting, however, that the respondents that\nreceived the Combined treatment were more likely to sup-\nport torture than the respondents receiving either treatment\nindividually. Given the evidence from Tomz (2008) and\nChilton (2015) that arguments about the status of interna-\ntional law had an additive effect when combined with non-\nlegal arguments, this is a surprising result that likely cannot\nsimply be explained by the fact that the respondents that\nwere presented with the combined treatment were less\nlikely to read their slightly longer vignette. One possible\nexplanation for our results is that these previous studies did\nnot test combining two legal arguments, and instead com-\nbined arguments about international law with economic or\nmoral arguments. It is possible that informing respondents\nthat government officials are advocating for using interro-\ngation techniques including torture despite the fact that it\nwould violate international law and the constitution sends a\nsignal that these officials have particularly good reasons for\nwanting to use torture in that instance. More research will\nhave to be conducted, however, to verify the higher support\nfor rights violations when using combined legal treatments\nand to test the theory we have suggested.\nTaken together, these results do not reveal any statisti-\ncally significant differences between our four treatment\ngroups. Given these null results, it is reasonable to calculate\nhow large a difference between the control group and a\ntreatment group would have been needed to find a statisti-\ncally significant result. With our samples sizes and standard\ndeviations, it would have taken an effect size of roughly\n5.4% to find a difference that was statistically significant at\nthe 0.1 level and an effect size of roughly 6.0% to find a\ndifference that was statistically significant at the 0.05 level.\nTo put this in perspective, the level of support for torture\nwas 4.6% lower for our Con. Law group compared to the\nControl group (which, as previously noted, fell just short of\nstatistical significance at the 0.1 level).\nResults by party identification\nWe also examined whether the political affiliations of the\nrespondents influenced their responses.16 The results bro-\nken out by respondents that identified themselves as either\nDemocrats or Republicans are presented in Figure 2.17\nThere are three things worth nothing about our results\nbased on party identification. First, Democrats in all four\ntreatment groups were consistently less likely than\nRepublicans to support the use of torture: the mean response\nwhereas the mean response for Republicans was 61.7%\nlic polling showing that Republicans are more supportive\nof torture18 and the finding in Wallace (2013) that conserva-\ntives were more likely to support torture than liberals.\nSecond, the international law and constitutional law\ntreatments had an effect on support for torture among\nDemocrats but not Republicans. For Democrats, both the\nInt'l Law group and Con. Law group had a lower mean\nresponse than the Control group that is statistically signifi-\ncant at the 0.05 level. The Control group for Democrats\nwhile the Int'l Law group had a mean response of 43.9%\nRepublicans, however, the results for all four treatment\nFigure 1. Primary results (mean response and 90% CIs).\nChilton and Versteeg 5\nconditions are nearly identical. This result is consistent\nwith the finding in Wallace (2013) that the international\nlaw treatment lowered support for torture among liberals,\nbut had almost no effect on support for torture among\nconservatives.\nThird, it is puzzling that our results by party identifica-\ntion are consistent with Wallace (2013), but that our over-\nall results are not consistent with Wallace's finding that\npresenting respondents with arguments that torture vio-\nlates international law statistically significantly lowers\nsupport for torture. We explored three possibilities for this\ninconsistency. First, we considered whether this inconsist-\nency is due to the composition of our samples. Wallace's\nsample had 26% self-reported liberals, while our sample\nhad 41% self-reported Democrats. We do not think that\nthis cannot explain the inconsistency, because our larger\nproportion of Democrats should bias us towards finding\nstatistically significant results in the full sample. Second,\nwe considered whether this inconsistency emerges because\nour treatment groups are not balanced based on party iden-\ntification. Re-conducting the balance test from Hansen and\nBowers (2008) while including variables for Democrats,\nRepublicans, and Independents, however, does not reveal\nany evidence that our treatment groups are not balanced.19\nThird, we considered whether this inconsistency arises\nbecause of differences between the responses of moderates\nin Wallace's sample and the responses of independents\nin our sample. Wallace's replication data reveals that\nmoderates presented with his international law treatment\nwere 7.5% less likely to support the use of torture than\nrespondents in his control group.20 In contrast, in our sam-\nple independents presented with the international law\ntreatment were nearly 10% more likely to support the use\nof torture than the control group, and independents pre-\nsented with the constitutional law treatment were 0.04%\nmore likely to support the use of torture than the Control\ngroup. This suggests that the inconsistencies between our\noverall results and Wallace (2013) are due to the independ-\nents responding negatively or neutrally to our law treat-\nments. Future research should explore whether this is due\nto changes in the views of independents over time, the dif-\nferences in our vignettes, or idiosyncrasies in the composi-\ntion of our samples.\nMechanism questions\nWe also attempted to test the mechanisms that may lead\narguments about international law or constitutional law to\nchange public support for torture. To our knowledge, the\nonly previous study that has directly explored possible\nmechanisms for why arguments about international change\npublic opinion was Chilton (2014). After conducting an\nexperiment on how arguments about international law\nchange support for solitary confinement, Chilton (2014)\nasked respondents questions designed to test reasons why\nthe international law argument changed respondents'views.\nThe results suggested that the respondents that received the\nargument about international law were more likely to\nbelieve that it was important that the US treatment of pris-\noners conform to international standards.\nFigure 2. Results by party identification (mean response and 90% CIs).\n6 Research and Politics \nAfter respondents read our vignette, we also asked\" to\nread: we also asked a series of six additional questions to\nassess the mechanisms through which our international law\nand constitutional law treatments may influence public sup-\nport for the use of torture. Those questions are reported in\nTable 1. We randomized the order respondents were asked\nthese six questions, and for each we asked for responses on\na five-point scale (with 5 representing strong agreement\nand 1 representing strong disagreement). The responses to\nthese six questions are presented in Figure 3.\nOverall, the results in Figure 3 indicate that the treat-\nments that respondents received while reading our\nvignette had essentially no influence on the subsequent\nresponses to the six mechanism questions we asked. In\nfact, the differences in mean responses for the Control\ngroup and the Int'l Law group were not statistically sig-\nnificant at the 0.1 level for a single one of the six mecha-\nnism questions. This is perhaps unsurprising given that,\nas the previous results sections revealed, the responses\nfor the Control group and the Int'l Law group for our\nTable 1. Mechanism questions.\nInternational standards Should the United States' interrogation practices always conform to international standards?\nConstitutional standards Should the United States' interrogation practices always conform to US constitutional standards?\nRisk to Americans If the United States tortures, do you think that other countries will be more likely to torture\ncaptured Americans?\nRisk to others If the United States tortures, do you think that other countries will be more likely to torture their\nown citizens?\nValuable information Do you think the use of torture by the United States is likely to produce valuable information that\ncould not otherwise be obtained?\nMorality Is the use of torture immoral?\nFigure 3. Results to mechanism questions (mean response and 90% CIs).\nChilton and Versteeg 7\nprimary experiment were not different in a statistically\nsignificant way.\nThere were, however, statistically significant differ-\nences between the Control group and Con. Law group for\ntwo of the six questions. The respondents who received the\nconstitutional law treatment were less likely to think that\ntorture produces Valuable information (p = 0.03) and less\nlikely to think that the United States interrogation practices\nshould conform to International standards (p = 0.01). One\nexplanation for why respondents in the Con. Law group\nmay believe that torture is less likely to produce valuable\ninformation than respondents in the control group is that\nrespondents may believe that these interrogation techniques\nwould not have been constitutionally prohibited if they pro-\nduce important information. In other words, the constitu-\ntional law argument may prime respondents to think that\ntorture is less useful. One explanation for why respondents\nin the Con. Law group are less likely to think that United\nStates' interrogation practices should conform to\nInternational Standards than respondents in the Control\ngroup is that the respondents may think that international\nstandards are less relevant after they have been told about\ndomestic, constitutional standards that restrict torture. For\nexample, if the respondents in the Con. Law group thought\nthat the constitution had stricter limits on torture than inter-\nnational law, they would be less likely to think that the\nUnited States' interrogation practices should \"always con-\nform\" to international standards.\nAlthough these are small differences for only two of the\nsix mechanisms questions, it does provide some addi-\ntional--but admittedly very weak--evidence that informa-\ntion on constitutional law has a slightly larger effect on\nsupport for torture than information on international law.\nThat said, like with our primary results, the difference in\nmean responses between the Int'l Law group and Con. Law\ngroup for both the \"International standards\" and \"Valuable\ninformation\" questions were substantively small and far\nfrom statistically significant.\nConclusion\nOur experiment was designed to explore how information\nabout international law and constitutional law impacts pub-\nlic support for the use of torture. While we found no evi-\ndence that information about international law changed\npublic opinion, we found some weak evidence that infor-\nmation about constitutional law did. Specifically, using a\nbinary response scale, we found that presenting respond-\nents with the argument that constitutional law prohibits tor-\nture lowered public support for torture by 4.6 percentage\npoints. The effect, however, falls outside conventional lev-\nels of statistical significance. That said, although the argu-\nment about constitutional law had a slightly larger effect\nthan the argument about international law, there was not a\nstatistically significantly difference between these two\narguments. In general, our findings suggest that presenting\nrespondents with the arguments that international law and\nconstitutional law prohibits torture has little effect on pub-\nlic support for its use.21\nIt is worth noting that there are several limitations to\nour research design that may limit the generalizability of\nour results. First, since respondents may already be aware\nthat international law and constitutional law prohibit tor-\nture, our experiment cannot directly test the effect that\ninternational and constitutional torture prohibitions have\non public opinion. Instead, our experiment can only test\nthe effect that presenting respondents with arguments\nabout the status of these sources of law has on public sup-\nport for torture. As a result, despite the fact that our inter-\nnational law and constitutional law treatments had little\neffect, it may be the case that both international and\ndomestic torture prohibitions do have an impact on pub-\nlic support for torture, but that we simply cannot measure\nit because our control group is also aware of the prohibi-\ntions. Second, we only tested one vignette on a sample of\nrespondents from one country. It may be the case that\narguments about the status of international and constitu-\ntional law would have a different effect in other scenar-\nios, or that respondents from other countries would have\nresponded differently than the sample we recruited in the\nUnited States.\nDespite those limitations, our findings do help to\nexplain existing findings from observational studies on\nthe effectiveness of torture prohibitions. Our finding is\nconsistent with the observational studies that suggest that\nCAT ratification (e.g. Lupu, 2013; Powell and Staton,\n2009) and constitutional torture prohibitions (e.g. Chilton\ntorture. Our research is also consistent with studies that\nsuggest that even democratic governments are likely\nto engage in torture--especially in the face of terror\nthreats or violent dissent (Conrad and Moore, 2010;\nfindings do not directly prove that lack of popular support\nindeed causes legal torture prohibitions to fail, they\nsuggest that this is at least a factor that contributes to\ntheir ineffectiveness.\n"
