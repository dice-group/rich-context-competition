Inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for acute\nrespiratory infections (ARIs) is common and leads to many\nnegative public health consequences including increased\nantibiotic resistance, adverse drug reactions, and increased\ncost.2 We examined whether primary care physicians who\nsee a higher volume of ARI visits provide higher quality of\ncare in terms of antibiotic prescribing.\nMethods\nWe obtained electronic health record data for all 2012 adult\nambulatory visits for ARIs to primary care physicians in a\nlarge integrated health system that was affiliated with an aca-\ndemic medical center. The health system is located in the\nNortheastern United States, and operates more than 20 hospi-\ntals and 400 outpatient sites. Based on prior work,3 we divided\nARI diagnoses (based on International Classification of\nDiseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes) into 2\ngroups: (1) \"antibiotic-appropriate diagnoses\" (antibiotics\nmay be indicated), including streptococcal pharyngitis (034.x),\nappropriate diagnoses\" (antibiotics are never indicated),\nincluding non-specific upper respiratory infection (URI;\nprescriptions, and calculated the antibiotic prescribing rate for\nthe following: all ARI visits, individual conditions, non-\nantibiotic-appropriate diagnoses, antibiotic-appropriate\ndiagnoses, guideline concordance (for antibiotic-appropriate\n1RAND Corporation, Boston, MA, USA\n2Boston Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA,\nUSA\n3Division of General Medicine and Primary Care, Brigham and Women's\nHospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA\n4RAND Corporation, Pittsburgh, PA, USA\n5Department of Health Care Policy, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA,\nUSA\nCorresponding Author:\nCourtney Gidengil, RAND Corporation, 20 Park Plaza, Suite 920, Boston,\nEmail: gidengil@rand.org\nTable 1.

We defined guideline concor-\ndance as antibiotic prescriptions for antibiotic-appropriate\ndiagnoses that were the first-line antibiotic recommended for\nthe specific condition based on national guidelines: amoxicil-\nlin-clavulanate or amoxicillin for sinusitis,4,5 a macrolide or\ndoxycycline for pneumonia,6 amoxicillin or penicillin for\nstreptocccal pharyngitis,7,8 and amoxicillin for otitis media.9\nWe defined broad-spectrum antibiotics as macrolides, quino-\nlones, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and second- and third-genera-\ntion cephalosporins.10 We divided physicians into quintiles by\nARI visit volume and generated prescribing rates for each\nquintile using average prescribing rates for clinicians. We fit-\nted a linear regression model of prescribing rates across quin-\ntiles to assess for a significant difference in trend.\nResults\noverall antibiotic prescribing rate was 50%. For all ARI\ncases, physicians in higher volume quintiles were more\nlikely to list an antibiotic-appropriate diagnosis versus a non-\nantibiotic-appropriate diagnosis (P < .001; Table 1).\nPhysicians in higher volume quintiles had a higher antibiotic\nprescribing rate across all ARI visits (P < .001; Table 1), for\nnon-antibiotic-appropriate ARI diagnoses (P < .001), for\nantibiotic-appropriate ARI diagnoses, and for 4 individual\ndiagnoses: URI, bronchitis, non-streptococcal pharyngitis,\nand sinusitis (all Ps < .001). Broad-spectrum antibiotic\nprescribing increased significantly as volume increased (P =\n.001), whereas guideline-concordant antibiotic prescribing\ndecreased significantly (P < .001; Table 1).\nDiscussion\nPhysicians with a higher volume of cases manage ARI in a\nvery different manner. They are much more likely to list a\ndiagnosis where an antibiotic may be appropriate. However,\nfor both non-antibiotic-appropriate diagnoses and antibiotic-\nappropriate diagnoses, higher volume physicians are more\nlikely to prescribe antibiotics. When they prescribe an antibi-\notic for a diagnosis for which an antibiotic may be indicated,\nthey are less likely to prescribe guideline-concordant antibi-\notics. In contrast to previous studies on the volume-outcome\nrelationship, for ARI visits, higher volume physicians appear\nto provide lower quality care than lower volume physicians.\nThe relationship between volume and quality is generally\nthought to be due to increasing physician experience leading\nto better performance or decision making, which in turn can\nlead to improved outcomes. However, in the case of ARI vis-\nits, additional volume is unlikely to add substantively to the\nphysician's expertise. In fact, at a certain threshold, higher\nvolume may be associated with lower quality if physicians\nare rushed. Lower volume might also be a proxy for part-\ntime status, which has been associated with higher quality.11\nOne key limitation of our study is that it relies on physician\ndiagnostic coding. Higher volume physicians may see a differ-\nent patient mix, but physicians have substantial discretion in\nGidengil et al 3\nselecting specific ARI diagnoses. Also, antibiotic prescribing\nis not always indicated for many visits even for \"antibiotic-\nappropriate\" diagnoses.5 In addition, it is possible that physi-\ncians who are more likely to prescribe are also simply more\nlikely to document diagnoses well, resulting in a systematic\nreporting bias.\nAnother limitation is that we did not measure physicians'\noverall visit volume or time spent with each patient, potential\nmarkers of whether a physician is rushed. And finally, this is\na single health system study, which may constrain the gener-\nalizability of our results more broadly.\nOur results help inform efforts to identify targets for inter-\nvention. Given that high-volume physicians account for the\nbulk of ARI visits, efforts targeting this group are likely to\nyield important population effects in improving quality.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This\nInstitute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (PI: Dr. Mehrotra).
