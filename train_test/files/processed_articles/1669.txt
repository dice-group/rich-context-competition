Introduction\nIn its report, Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance--United States 2005, the CDC asserts that \"health-\nrisk behaviors, which contribute to the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among youth and\nadults, often are established during childhood and adolescence, extend into adulthood, are interrelated,\nand are preventable [1]. Results from the CDC's national Youth Risk Behavior Survey 2005 indicated\nused marijuana, and 2.1% reported past injection of an illegal drug [1]. Risky behavior among\nadolescents has decreased since 1991, but many still engage in behaviors which contravene achieving\nthe goals of Healthy People 2010 [2]. Those who continue to engage despite policy interventions may\nbe most at risk for negative outcomes.\nThe CDC calls for \"more effective school health programs and other policy and programmatic\ninterventions which are needed to reduce risk and improve health outcomes among youth\" [1]. While\nschool health programs may have some impact, it is critical for such programs to target those\nadolescents most at-risk. This research seeks to increase the effectiveness and target efficiency of\nhealth policies and programs whose aim is to reduce health-risk behaviors among adolescents, by\nexploring the role of resilience in adolescents' risk for participation in these behaviors.\nEfforts have been made to identify processes of both vulnerability and protection to reduce health\ncompromising behaviors in adolescents [3]. Resilience refers to an individual's capacity to engage in\nhealth-promoting behaviors in the face of adversity [4-9] and is an important element in human\nadaptation. It is a distinguishing quality necessary for adapting to changing demands of daily living.\nWork in psychology [5,7,8,10-12] introduces the notion of resilience to understand coping and\nadaptation, which can influence activity preferences, and supports the premise that resilient\nadolescents are more able to endure stress and avoid addiction [5,7,8]. Two individuals facing the\nsame family and social pressures may respond differently based on unobserved attributes like\nresilience. Previous literature [5,7,13] has suggested that factors associated with resilience and\nvulnerability occur on three levels: personal, family, and community and that each contributes to an\nindividual's overall resilience. Social supports outside the family contribute to community-level\nresilience, family-level resilience is associated with parental function and relationships, and\npersonal-resilience is associated with the individual's psychological, cognitive, and emotional\nprocesses [5,7,8,13,14]. The indices we construct in this paper capture resilience in these areas. While\nan individual's stock of resilience at any given point in time is also a function of these outside\ninfluences (community and family), it is the perception of one's own situation that will ultimately\ndrive behaviors such as smoking, drinking and drug use. There are three models of resilience in the\nliterature. In this paper we build on the compensatory model of resilience that posits that the collective\nappraisals of risk and compensatory factors predict competence. For example, negative personal self\nimage (risk factor) combined with a positive perception of peer support, respect and admiration\n(compensatory factor) may have a neutralizing effect on an individual's propensity to engage in\nunhealthy activities [15-18]. Whether the factor is risky or compensatory is determined by the\nindividual's own self perception. We construct our index in line with this theoretical framework. The\nother two models provide alternative rationale for resilience in adolescents. The protective factor\nmodel identifies social and environmental assets and resources as factors that reduce the degree of\nrisk [19]. The challenge model [18] focus on risk factors as facilitators of adaptation. Individuals\nbuild on their resilience capacities when confronted with stress that does not exceed their ability\nto cope.\nIndications of not enjoying life, feeling sad, feeling hopelessness etc., imply lower personal\ncompetence and resilience. Alternatively, feeling one has good qualities and having a sense of\naccomplishment and pride are indicators of a healthy sense of personal competence and mastery and,\nconsequently, of resilience [4,6,20-23]. In this research, we use indicators of these emotional attributes\nto construct measures of resilience in adolescents.\nAn adolescent functions in some dominant culture with customs, practices, ideologies, values,\nnorms, and beliefs. The social environment, in addition to personal competence, is fundamental to\nfostering and exercising resilience, which, in adolescents, may be influenced by adverse\nexperiences [13,24,25]. The social context might afford opportunities for feeling socially accepted,\nloved, and wanted (helping develop an adolescent's resilience), or, conversely, might foster a sense of\nvulnerability, hindering development of resilience and resulting in initiation of activities that\ncompromise health [6].\nAdolescents engage in activities that satisfy their physiological and psychological needs and\nprovide physical and mental comfort and security. The activities chosen (health-promoting or health-\ncompromising) depend on the contexts in which the individual exists. Regardless of the activities'\nbenefits or detriments, engagement in these activities is contextually purposeful and meaningful to the\nindividual [26]. Therefore, an adolescent's overall resilience is not just a function of individual make-\nup, but also strongly impacted by social constructs. We also use indicators of an adolescent's\ncontextual/social attributes in our construction of resilience measures.\nFactors such as peer and family influences, school, and policy environment have all proven to be\npredictors of early initiation of risky products like cigarettes [27-29], and policies have been enacted to\nreduce initiation, but with mixed results. At the margin, most of these policies have had some impact.\nThe economics literature consistently finds that increased price reduces initiation [30]. However, it\nmay be that \"sin taxes\" and advocacy programs have disproportionately provided incentives and\ninformation to deter such behavior among adolescents for whom addiction was an unlikely\noutcome [31,32]. To effectively reduce initiation and addiction, current policies may not be optimal\nsince their focus is on adolescents in general, rather than those with the highest propensity for adverse\noutcomes. For example, the D.A.R.E. (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) program, once offered by\n75% of American school districts to all adolescents and/or pre-adolescents in certain grades, may be\neliminated by some districts because studies have not demonstrated the program's\neffectiveness [33-35]. Some districts are considering replacing D.A.R.E. with alternative programs\nwhich assess \"the levels of risk factors related to problem behaviors such as alcohol, tobacco and other\ndrug use--and to identify the levels of protective factors that help guard against those behaviors\" [36].\nWe suggest that one difficulty in achieving success with existing anti-addiction policy is the lack of\nresearch that identifies at-risk groups. Jessor (1991) believes the aim of research regarding risky\nadolescent behavior should be identifying its psychosocial antecedents and determinants, that is,\n\"What are the risk factors for the risk factors?\" [37], and that effective policy in reducing this behavior\nmust address an adolescent's capacity for coping with life as a factor influencing initiation of risky\nbehaviors [4,9,20]. Our premise is that the protective factors which contribute to resilience help\nadolescents endure stress and avoid addiction-associated psychosocial impairments [5,7,8]. By\ndeveloping resilience indices, we identify an important source of heterogeneity among adolescents in\ntheir propensities to cope, in order to identify those that may be more or less at risk for participating in\nhealth-compromising behavior.\nPolicy makers need to know who is at risk, the magnitude of that risk, and the factors that drive\nrisky behavior, to develop target efficient policies aimed at improving outcomes among adolescents.\nConsidering personal, psychosocial, and environmental factors when developing policy to reduce risky\nbehavior should enable interventions to reduce participation and improve health more efficiently.\nFurther, if resilience is a key factor in predicting outcomes, effective policies may attempt to improve\nresilience among adolescents, strengthening coping skills and the contextual factors that contribute to\nresilience [38]. The three models of resilience in the literature can be used to inform policy. Therefore,\nthe ability to assess resilience in adolescents might help predict who is at risk for addiction, enabling\naddiction prevention policies to be targeted at those adolescents most likely to benefit. Using factor\nanalysis on data from the nationally representative sample of middle/high school students in the\nNational Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health [39] (Add Health), we identified three, mutually-\nexclusive manifestations of resilience. Consistent with assumptions and prior literature, these are\nrelated to social, family, and individual resilience [6]. To identify the effect of adolescent resilience on\nthe risk of engaging in health-compromising behaviors (smoking, drinking alcohol, and using illegal\ndrugs) and subsequent addiction, we tested the following hypothesis: Adolescents who are less\nresilient will be more likely to smoke, drink alcohol, and use illegal drugs and will consume greater\nquantities of cigarettes, alcohol, and illegal drugs.\n2. Methods\nThis study used data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health [39] (Add Health),\nwhich consists of data on adolescents from 132 schools nationwide, between grades 7 through 12 in\n1994. A description of the sample may be found in Table 1. The in-school portion of the first wave of\nthe survey (1994) contains a cross-section of data on about 90,000 adolescents. A subset of the initial\nsample (20,745 respondents) was also interviewed in their homes with follow-up surveys in 1996 and\nin 2002. The primary data for our analysis comes from the first wave (1994) of the in-home survey\nportion of Add Health. The study benefits from the richness of the Add Health data, both in terms of\nsample size as well as the quality of the measures of typically unobserved school, peer, family, and\nindividual attributes [13]. We capitalize on this strength to identify adolescents at risk. The use of the\nrestricted secondary Add Health data has been approved by the Carolina Population Center.\nThe sample for our analysis included the 20,700 in-home sample adolescents who responded to all\nrelevant questions for this study. Parents of the in-home sample were also interviewed regarding the\nparent-child relationship as well as parents' smoking and alcohol consumption. Additionally, school\nadministrators provided attributes of the school, including anti-smoking, -alcohol, and -drug\npolicies/prevention programs.\nTable 1.

Construction of Resilience Indices\nThere were 31 Add Health questions identified as being related to resilience (Table 2). Putting all 31\nquestions into the model would be noisy and difficult to interpret, particularly because of how collinear\nthey are. Using exploratory factor analysis, a simple, yet efficient data reduction technique, these 31\nquestions were reduced to three, mutually-exclusive, underlying, latent indices (factors) [6] which\nsignificantly captured the heterogeneity in the way that resilience is manifested in adolescents. The\nmethodology combines like underlying components of the 31 questions, and groups them into the three\nmutually exclusive indices. This minimizes the potential for attenuation bias that might result from\nindicators that may have offsetting effects (the attribute is associated with a good outcome, but may\nalso have the potential to be associated with a negative outcome). Table 2 contains the factor loadings\nand scoring coefficients from the factor analysis that depicts how each indicator can have more than\none non-random significant component that is tied to different underlying attributes of\nadolescent resilience.\nFactors are typically selected based on the magnitude of the eigenvalues. Some use a cutoff of\neigenvalue = 1 to retain a factor, while others argue that this is arbitrary, and that factors should be\nretained until there is a dramatic drop in the eigenvalue [40]. This latter approach is more consistent\nwith the intent of factor analysis: an exploratory quest for key, underlying commonalities in multiple\nindicators. Based on analyzing the factor loadings, we retained a factor as long as it loaded onto at least\none of the 31 questions stronger than the factors that preceded it. Had we used a cutoff of 1, we would\nhave retained only the first two factors, throwing information\naway. The third factor (eigenvalue close to 0.9) had information that appeared to be significant and\nwhich was not contained in the other factors. We felt it preferable to retain a less important factor than\nrisk throwing away a significant one, especially in light of the fact that the literature suggests that\nresilience has three separate aspects related to personal, family, and community [5-7].\nwith self, family, and peer/community components. Individuals scoring high on this factor averaged\npositive responses to most of the 31 questions. Scoring high on Factor 2 (eigenvalue = 1.46,\nM = 0.009, SD = 0.782) indicated self/family-resilience without peer/community components. We\ninterpret strong sense of self from favorable responses to components such as being happy, hopeful,\nand optimistic and having good qualities. For this index we also interpret strong sense of family\nsupport because they felt loved, wanted and that their parents care. However, while this group reported\nfeeling socially accepted and happy, they also were more likely to feel lonely, sad, and that people\nwere unfriendly. This suggests some strong family ties, and perhaps some good friends, but that they\nstruggle socially; perhaps these are the type who are part of a smaller group of friends that are not\nresilience without family and peer/community components. We retained this factor because it had the\nhighest load onto being non-argumentative so it contained information not captured elsewhere.\nRespondents scoring high in this factor are a type that are worthy of study. While they report lack of\nsupport from parents and teachers, some of the areas they score high in suggest strength within\nthemselves. For example these types score high on factors like not being sad, liking oneself, and\nconfidence going with gut feelings, suggesting strong self in the absence of feeling that adults care\nabout them. They were also less likely to face their problems--which could be a protective coping\nmechanism that keeps the adolescent optimistic, despite difficult circumstances. This type of\nadolescent has chosen to trust and rely on self given lack of alternatives.\nIf resilience in adolescents occurred such that the manifestation of any type of resilience\n(self, family, and/or community) was independent of the manifestation of any other type of resilience,\nthen we would expect the factor analysis to reveal three distinct components of resilience: self alone,\nfamily alone, and community alone. However, the factor analysis revealed that, in adolescents, the\nmanifestation of types of resilience is NOT independent, but rather highly correlated. One of the\nassumptions of factor analysis is that there is enough independence in the manifestation of distinct\ncomponents so that the factor analysis can tease the components apart. Our results suggest that this\nassumption that self, family and community resilience are independent is violated. That is why the\nfactor analysis results indicated three factors that are empirically (that is, based on the data) mutually-\nexclusive but not conceptually mutually exclusive, because, for example, clearly overall-resilience\ncontains elements of family-resilience and self-resilience. The factor analysis did not find three\nmutually-exclusive types of resilience, but rather revealed, among adolescents, three mutually-\nexclusive manifestations of resilience: overall-resilient, self/family-resilient, or self-resilient. In other\nwords, the factor analysis reveals three distinct types of adolescents that have some overlapping self-\nreported attributes. We can now identify these distinct types of adolescents in our model of behavior to\nbetter identify which types are at risk. A table showing the means and standard deviations for each\nsample characteristic (see Table 1 for a list of characteristics) for each of the three resilience factors\n(overall, self/family, and self) is available from the authors on request.\nTable 2.

Constructing Participation and Consumption Indicators\nVariables: Dependent variables included participation and consumption (smoking, drinking, or\nusing illegal drugs). Independent variables included resilience, other personal factors, family relations,\npeer behavior [41,42], and school policies. Confounding variables included parental education, and\nwhether or not the adolescent lived with both biological parents, in an urban setting, at least one parent\nsmoked, the parents consumed alcohol, and the adolescent indicated easy access to cigarettes at home.\nSmoking was classified into four levels: non- (never, ever tried cigarettes), experimental- (tried\ncigarettes, denied smoking within the past 30 days, never smoked regularly), intermittent- (smoked\nbetween 1 and 29 of the past 30 days), or regular-smoker (smoked on a daily basis the past\n30 days) [43,44], with the latter three groups classified as participating. Consumption was the number\nof cigarettes smoked each day that the person smoked. Drinking was classified into three levels: non-\n(never drank alcohol), light/moderate- (having one to four drinks each time), or heavy-drinker (having\nfive or more drinks each time), with the latter two groups classified as participating. Drinking\nconsumption was the number of drinks the adolescent had each time they drank alcohol. Illegal drug\nuse was classified into two levels with those who reported to have tried any illegal drugs in the\nprevious 30 days categorized as participating and consumption was measured by number of times\ndrugs were used in the last 30 days.\nA variable was constructed, using exploratory factor analysis, to capture both the child's and\nparent's perception of the parent-child relationship, to reflect roles that parents play in influencing\nadolescents' risky behavior [45]. Adolescents contributed perceptions of whether he/she thought that\nhis/her parents care, understand, pay attention, etc. and parents contributed perceptions of whether\nhe/she got along well with the child, could trust the child, etc. The factor analysis results indicated that\na single factor (eigenvalue = 2.25837) was sufficient to summarize all variables in the parent-child\nrelationship.\nThe average number of students in the respondent's grade and school who smoked, consumed\nalcohol, or used illegal drugs was used to identify peer influence. To account for various school\npolicies, models used school program indictors (whether the school offered alcohol, drug, and/or\nsmoking prevention/awareness programs) and school restriction indictors (whether smoking was\nprohibited for students and faculty on the school premises and/or whether possession of drugs and/or\nalcohol resulted in suspension from school).\nData Analysis: Since the participation variables were binary (adolescents either participated or they\ndid not participate), probit analysis was used to build three participation models for smoking, drinking,\nand using illegal drugs. Ordinary least-squares multiple regression was used to build three\nconsumption models: quantity of cigarettes, alcohol, and illegal drugs. Besides controlling for\nobserved environmental factors, we also controlled for unobserved differences within neighborhoods\nby introducing school-level variables (fixed effects) in all of our estimations. This allowed us to\naccount for environmental differences at the school level that might have influenced resiliency at the\nindividual level.\n3. Results\nThe results of our analyses of the influence of resilience on risky behavior are reported in Table 3.\nThe effect of resilience persisted even after controlling for family, peer, and other environmental and\npersonal factors. For each behavior (smoking, drinking alcohol, and using illegal drugs) we report the\ndifference in the probability of participating (columns 1, 9 and 17) from the average probability (for a\nmarginal increase in the resilience index or other variable) and then, for those who do participate, the\nincremental amount consumed (columns 5, 13 and 21). We modeled consumption thus to understand\nseverity of the behavior among those who chose to participate. (Overall consumption results, which are\nsimilar to these, are also available, upon request.)\nA one unit increase in the overall-resilience index reduces the probability of smoking by almost 5%,\nby 6% for drinking, and by 4% for illegal drug use. Those who were self/family-resilient but perhaps\nare weaker in social resilience were at a higher risk for participation. Individuals who score marginally\nhigher in this index are 6\u00ad7% more likely to smoke or drink and 2% more likely to use illegal drugs\nthan the average. Those who were self-resilient were marginally less likely to smoke or drink, but 1%\nmore likely to use illegal drugs.\nFor consumption (conditional on participation), those who were overall-resilient consumed less\nalcohol and cigarettes with no difference in illegal drug consumption. Those who were self-resilient\nconsumed more cigarettes, while those who were self/family-resilient smoked fewer cigarettes.\nDrinkers who were self-resilient consumed above average quantities of alcohol. Among drug users\n(smallest sample), there was no difference in consumption by resilience.\nThe confounding factors were also significant in predictable ways for both participation and\nconsumption. The role of parents was especially important with parental education and participation in\nrisky behaviors, as well as the relationship with the child, all being significant factors. After\ncontrolling for resilience, older adolescents, males, whites, and Hispanics were more likely to engage\nin risky behavior. Religious adolescents were less likely to do so.\n4. Discussion\nThe literature suggests three components of resilience (personal, family, and community) [8-11].\nThe data confirm three significant underlying components, with the bulk of what determines resilience\ncaptured by the first factor. However, two other factors, with sufficiently high eigenvalues and factor\nloadings, indicated residual commonalities worth including beyond the first resilience index. It was\npredicted that adolescents with high scores on these three factors had greater resilience and, in turn,\nwould exhibit better outcomes than those with low scores, after controlling for other risk factors.\nThe results (see Table 3) indicate that self/family-resilience, in the absence of peer/community\nresilience, was inadequate to prevent participation in risky behaviors (Risk factors - smoking, drinking,\nand using drugs). Perhaps those who experience an absence of peer acceptance (compensatory factors)\nmay be unable to resist risky behaviors due to peer pressure to \"fit in.\" However, strong self/family-\nresilience can lead to a reduction in the number of cigarettes smoked. These may be the experimenters\nor intermittent participants who smoke when out socially but with strong enough family support and\nself resilience to know when to stop. Alternatively, those who were overall-resilient may be better\nequipped to resist peer pressure to smoke, drink, or use drugs. Interestingly, those who were\nself-resilient, with little family or social support, were less likely to smoke or drink but those who\ndid consumed larger quantities. In a model where we control for other risk factors like family\ncharacteristics, strong self resilience (coping skills) predictably reduces propensities to engage in such\nbehaviors. There does appear to be a split among adolescents who fall into this resilience type since\nthose who do participate are the target group at highest risk for addiction since among those who do\nparticipate, they are consuming closer to addictive levels. In addition, within this type are those who\nare more likely to turn to illegal drug use rather than face problems.\nIn sum, perhaps smokers who were overall-resilient were primarily experimental, smokers who\nwere self/family-resilient were primarily experimental or intermittent (mainly to fit in socially), while\nsmokers who were self-resilient were primarily regular smokers who may smoke as an escape, rather\nthan for social acceptance. While those who were self-resilient consumed an average amount of drugs,\nthey were more likely to use drugs, and any use of illegal drugs could be seeking an escape. These\nassociations between resilience and consumption are particularly noteworthy because the consumption\nmodels contained only participants, who were more homogeneous in resilience and other risk factors,\nsince these factors already significantly explained the propensity to participate.\nPrograms like the DARE program may have had little impact because they are not target\nefficient [27-29]. This work has implications for policies aimed at improving outcomes for adolescents\nat risk of engaging in the health compromising activities. School wide programs that are \"one size fits\nall\" may not yield desirable results without attempting to tailor the program to include incentives that\nwill work for adolescents at risk. An alternative approach might be to identify at risk children in\nschools based on resilience scores and develop programs to increase self efficacy and compensate for\nlack of environmental assets and resources. Occupational therapists provide interventions in mental\nhealth and school-based settings that assist clients in developing compensatory strategies for building\nresilience and facilitating healthy adaptation. In school-based practice, occupational therapy can\nprovide target specific interventions that meet the specific needs of at risk children and promote\nOne limitation of this study is that the Add Health data was not designed with the intent to construct\nindicators of resilience. So while the data are rich with indicators that overlap those used in the\nliterature to construct resilience, the questions were not asked in a sequence consistent with how it\nmight be done in a resilience study, and we had to pool together indicators throughout the\nsurvey piecemeal.\nTable 3. 1994 Resilience's Effect on Smoking, Drinking Alcohol, and Using Illegal Drugs.\nMarginal Effect: Smoking Marginal Effect: Alcohol Marginal Effect: Illegal Drugs\nParticipation (Probit) Consumption (OLS) Participation (Probit) Consumption (OLS) Participation (Probit) Consumption (OLS)\nVariables Mean SD z p>|z| Mean SD z p>|z| Mean SD z p>|z| Mean SD z p>|z| Mean SD z p>|z| Mean SD z p>|z|\nResiliency Indices:\nPolicy Measures:\nParent Measures:\nPeer Measure:\nDemographics:\nFit (OLS regression:\nFit (probit regression: log\n*p <= 0.05 is statistically significant at 5% level. **p <= 0.01 is statistically significant at 1% level. ***p <= 0.001 is statistically significant at 0.1% level.\nThese results motivate further analysis of the relationships between adolescent resilience and\nrisky behavior. We can further examine consumption findings, to test for level of addiction, such as\nwhether those who were self-resilient were more likely to be regular smokers while those who were\nself/family-resilient were more likely to smoke intermittently. We also plan to further explore the\npsychometric properties of these resilience indices, comparing them to another measure of resilience\nand measures of related constructs (in another sample of adolescents) to assess concurrent and\ndiscriminant validity. Future research will also examine how resilience evolves over time and how this\nchange affects addictive behavior. Data from future waves of Add Health (1996 and 2002) will be\nanalyzed to further assess how adolescent resilience affects behavior throughout adult life. Also,\ninterventions should be tested which are targeted toward vulnerable adolescents, engaging them in\nexperiential learning and problem-solving to increase resilience and health-promoting behaviors when\navailable personal, family, and peer/community resources are insufficient [47,48].\nIn conclusion, we hypothesized that adolescents vary in resilience and using a nationally\nrepresentative sample of middle/high school students, we examined the role of individual resilience in\npredicting addictive behaviors: smoking, alcohol consumption, and illegal drug use. Examining\naddictive behavior in adolescents, controlling for confounding environmental and personal factors, the\nrole of resilience was robust to various model specifications and significantly explains heterogeneous\nrisks. We suggest that an adolescent's propensity for detrimental risky behavior, and subsequent\nnegative outcomes, relates to environmental and personal factors, including resilience. The value of\nknowing that resilience among adolescents tends to occur in one of three types: overall-resilient,\nself/family-resilient, or self-resilient, is that programs to reduce health-compromising behaviors can be\nmore effective and efficient if they are targeted to adolescents with specific needs, which can be\nidentified by their type of resilience.\n"
