This empirical research article examines the determinants of the discretionary\ninvestment policy of food sector firms in India. The study aims to analyze the impact of financial policies and firm characteristics\non the discretionary investment strategy of the food industry firms. The article uses the partial least squares structural\nequation modeling (PLS-SEM) to understand the drivers of discretionary investment policy of food sector firms. The study\nfinds that investment policy of firms is a major determinant of profitability of food sector firms. Higher investments in capital\nexpenditures and working capital result in higher profitability. Management efficiency significantly influences firm profitability.\nThe results suggest that riskier firms in food sector might focus on R&D investments as a strategy to generate more cash\nflows. Size of firm is negatively related to R&D intensity. Smaller firms in food sector tend to invest more in R&D. The study\ndoes not provide evidence to suggest that profitable firms invest more in R&D activities.\n",

Contemporary strategic\nthinking posits that firms can gain competitive advantage by\nincreasing its research and development (R&D) and adver-\ntising expenditures. R&D-based strategies attempt to gener-\nate knowledge assets which enable firms to develop either\nsuperior products or more efficient production techniques.\nAdvertising seeks to differentiate the firm's product from\nthose of competitors. Many research studies have provided\nevidence that advertising and R&D expenditures have large\npositive and consistent influences on the market value of the\nfirm. These studies suggest that advertising and R&D have\nstatistically significant and quantitatively important impact\non profit rates which provide a measure of market perfor-\nmance. Despite the postulated importance of these expendi-\ntures, firms still consider these expenditures as discretionary.\nDuring difficult times, firms often reduce discretionary\ninvestment expenditures due to reduction in income. The dis-\ncretionary investment policy of firms can be viewed as stra-\ntegic in nature. The present study aims to analyze the\ndeterminants of discretionary investment behavior of firms\nin food sector. Indian food products industry is chosen for\nthis study due to its complexity and diversity. Food and food\nproducts are the biggest consumption category in India, with\nspending on food accounting for nearly 21% of India's gross\ndomestic product (GDP) and with a market size of US$181\nbillion.\nReview of Literature\nsuggested that firms compromise on discretionary invest-\nments during difficult economic times. However, studies\nthere are advantages of increasing these activities when other\nfirms are compromising it.

Nishimura, Takanobu, and Kozo (2005)\npointed that firms which compromise on R&D often deviate\nfrom their long-term growth path and would significantly\nharm the company in long run.\nLiterature on R&D and advertisement decision has come\na long way since structure, conduct and performance (SCP)\nThese studies suggested that differences in conduct with\nrespect to R&D and advertisement behavior can be linked to\nstructure of the industry. Highly concentrated industry\nbehaves differently compared with less concentrated indus-\ntry. The SCP approach initially focused on inter-industry dif-\nferences. The focus then shifted to intra-industry differences.\npostulated that the differences in firm performance are due to\nunique firm-specific factors or resources. These specific\nresources are valuable, rare, inimitable, and non-substitut-\nable. Marketing and innovations facilitate firms to develop\nthese specific resources for gaining competitive advantage in\nlong run.\nDuring the 1960s, management theory and research began\nto adopt a new orientation which represented a middle ground\nby improving the generalizability of the former, while obtain-\ning richer characterizations than the latter (Valarie, Rajan, &\nCarl, 1988). The contingency approach in strategy literature\nadvocates that different strategies are contingent on competi-\ntive settings of businesses. Competitive settings are defined\nin terms of environmental and organizational contingencies.\nThese contingencies interact with firm-level factors, which\nultimately affects the strategies firms choose.\nGeorge and Agnes Cheng (1992) found that the differences\nin strategies are due to type of offering and market type.\nLevin, and Mowery (1987) found that the size of the firm is an\nimportant variable that determines R&D decision. Lee and\nSung (2005) found that the relationship between R&D and\nsize is probably stronger for industries with greater techno-\nlogical opportunities. Studies by Guariglia (2008) and\nHovakimian (2009) suggested that relationship between R&D\nand size is positive for firms with higher capital intensity.\nRyan and Wiggins (2002) pointed that firms with high\ngrowth opportunities have more incentives to invest in R&D\nonce a considerable percentage of their value is sourced from\nassets which are not in place. Del and Papagni (2003) on the\nbasis of summarized studies of 20 years suggested that the\nrelationship between growth of the firm and research inten-\nsity could not be established by many studies. The free cash\nflow hypothesis advanced by Jensen (1986) stated that man-\nagers endowed with free cash flow will invest it in negative\nnet present value (NPV) projects rather than pay it out to the\nshareholders. Henry and John (2000) suggested that expected\nreturns and cash flows are important explanatory variables of\nR&D intensities.\nGenerally Indian firms prefer technology purchase route\nby paying royalty. This helps the firms to reduce uncertainty\nsurrounding R&D investments. Katrak (1989) found that\nimported technology helped in promoting R&D activities in\nIndian firms. Siddharthan (1992) found the relationship\nbetween imports and R&D to be complementary. However,\nR&D intensive firms often see outsourcing as an impedi-\npost nineties, R&D intensive industries have increasingly\nentering into partnership relationship with outside suppliers.\nMyers (1977) suggested that financial leverage often influ-\nence firm's strategies through agency problem with its share-\nGrullon and George (2006) found that financial leverage is\nnegatively related to both R&D and advertising spending.\nJensen and William (1976) and Raji, Gary, and Shrihari\n(2011) suggested that higher level of debt in the capital struc-\nture moderates the effects of R&D and advertisement in influ-\nencing the profitability during difficult times. Kotabe (1990)\nconfirmed that profits have a positive relationship with R&D\ninitiatives. Paunov (2012) found that small companies in\ntimes of economic crisis faces difficulties in keeping their\nlevel of R&D investment. As debt increases, the expected\ncosts of financial distress also increase. Cost of financial dis-\ntress is called the underinvestment problem. Direct expenses\nassociated with administration of the bankruptcy costs appear\nto be small. Indirect costs are huge, and the most important\nindirect costs are likely to be reductions in firm value that\nresult from cutbacks in promising investment when compa-\nnies get into financial difficulty. Managers may cut back or\npostpone major capital projects, R&D, and advertising.\nThe study by Hirsch and Gschwandtner (2013) revealed\nthat the degree of profit persistence in the food industry is\nlower compared with other manufacturing sectors due to\nstrong competition among food processors and high retailer\nconcentration. Furthermore, firm size is an important driver\nof persistence, whereas firm age, risk, and R&D intensity\nhave a negative influence. The paper by Hirsch and Hartmann\n(2014) used autoregressive models and Arellano\u00adBond\ndynamic panel estimation to suggest that cooperatives which\naccount for around 20% of all firms in the European diary\nprocessing sector are not primarily profit oriented. The panel\nmodel reveals that short as well as long-run profit persistence\nis influenced by firm and industry characteristics.\nTheoretical Postulates\nR&D has become a key strategic driver to improve the prod-\nucts and services in the modern world based on new technol-\nogy innovation. This article provides evidence on the\nrelationship between the financial policies of firms in the\nfood industry and R&D activities. The study explores\nwhether firms with significantly larger financial performance\nhave an intensive investment strategy in R&D.\nSujit and Rajesh 3\nR&D investment strategy is long-term oriented and signi-\nfies uncertainty. New products and services are very critical\nfor competitive success. It may be noted that managers are\nrisk averse and may avoid R&D investments for the follow-\ning reasons. Intangible investments have a greater probability\nof failure than tangible investments. R&D being a long-term\ngrowth investment involves technological and competitive\nrisks. The returns from intangible investments like R&D are\nmore remote in time compared with returns from tangible\ninvestments. An important characteristic of R&D expenditure\nis irreversibility in which if a firm decides to stop a R&D\nproject, it will not be able to recover all the money invested,\nthe reason being that these investments are partly specific to\nthe firm and cannot be sold at their acquisition costs. The\nspillovers relating to processes of specific R&D will make it\npossible for competitor firms to gain competitiveness at a\nlower cost on account of the imitation of the processes.\nIn the context of risky nature of R&D investments, it can\nbe hypothesized that firms with greater financial perfor-\nmance involve in active R&D investment strategy. Thus,\nR&D investment strategy is a function of the financial per-\nformance and other financial policies of the firm. It can be\nstated that R&D investment strategy of food sector firms are\na function of profitability, size, liquidity, leverage, cash flow,\nand other external characteristics.\nValue drivers are crucial for value maximization. Value\ndrivers can be classified into operational, investment, and\nfinancial. Firms with higher growth rate in sales, assets, and\nprofits tend to have higher profits. Higher investments in\nform of capital investments and working capital result in\nhigher profitability. Improvement in management efficiency\nor operational efficiency would lead to higher value for firms\nin the form of increased profitability. Higher profitability\nacts as an incentive for firms to undertake more intensive\ndiscretionary investments like R&D activities. Higher profits\nwill lead to higher R&D intensity. R&D investment intensity\nis also a function of the firm's size, liquidity, leverage, cash\nflow, and risk characteristics. Large firms tend to make more\nR&D investments. Firms with higher leverage tend to make\nlower R&D investments. Firms with high liquidity and cash\nflows tend to invest more in R&D activities.\nThe study assumes that the discretionary investment pol-\nicy of food sector firms in the form of R&D expenses and\nadvertising expenses is a function of critical financial charac-\nteristics of the firm such as size, growth, financial leverage,\nrisk characteristics, investment decision policy, asset utiliza-\ntion efficiency, cash flow measures, and profitability. It is\nassumed these financial characteristics determine the R&D\ninvestment policy of food-based firms.\nData, Sample, and Method\nThe study collected required data from Prowess database\nprovided by Center for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE),\nMumbai. Prowess is the largest database of the financial\nperformance of Indian companies. The coverage includes\npublic, private, co-operative, and joint sector companies,\nlisted or otherwise. Total R&D expenditure is estimated by\nadding R&D on capital account and R&D on current account.\nThe final data set was compiled in the following manner.\nThose firms which reported zero sales figure were dropped\nfrom the database. Firms with no R&D and advertisement\nexpenses were also dropped from the sample list. The final\nsample consisted of 100 firms. The time period of study was\nfood industry but the availability of firm-level data restricted\nthe study to confine with the existing sample which remains\nthe limitation of the study.\nMethod\nThe present study tries to explore the determinants of R&D\nintensity in food industry using a series of interdependent set\nof construct. For this purpose, partial least squares structural\nequation modeling (PLS-SEM) is considered as one of the\nmodeling technique which allows to visually examine the\nrelationship among variables. This would help the firms to\nprioritize resources.\nPLS method is a soft modeling technique mainly used for\npredicting in social science. It is especially useful when the\nfactors are many and highly collinear. PLS path modeling\ntechnique works well with less rigid distributional assump-\ntions on the data. It allows researchers to simultaneously\nverify a series of interrelated dependence relationships\nbetween a set of constructs, represented by several variables\nwhile accounting for measurement error (Rigdon, 1998).\nThis technique is an alternative to covariance-based SEM\n(CB-SEM) for estimating theoretically established cause\u00ad\neffect relationship models. This method uses variance to\ndevelop theories in exploratory research by explaining vari-\nance in the target variables when examining the model. PLS-\nSEM enables to identify most important antecedents of the\ntarget construct. This method allows researchers to model\nand to simultaneously estimate and test complex theories\nwith empirical data (Hair, Hult, Ringle, & Sarstedt, 2014).\nFor the present study, the objective is to verify all the possi-\nble variables which could explain the variations in the R&D\nintensity in food industry in India.\nIn any structural equation model, there are two sub mod-\nels, that is, the inner model and the outer model. The inner\nmodel specifies the relationships between the independent\nand dependent latent variables, whereas the outer model\nspecifies the relationships between the latent variables and\ntheir observed indicators (Wong, 2013). The variables in\nSEM are exogenous and endogenous which can be identified\nwith the direction of the arrows in the path diagram.\nExogenous variables are those variables which have arrows\npointing outward and none leading toward it. On the con-\ntrary, an endogenous variable has at least one path leading to\nit and represents the effects of other variables.\n4 SAGE Open\nBecause PLS also reflects the sum of the diagonal in the\ncovariance matrix, it is also suited for prediction. Basically a\npath model is a diagram that connects variables/constructs\nbased on theory and logic to visually display the hypothesis\nthat will be tested. PLS-SEM is more preferable than\nCB-SEM in case of small samples and when the focus is on\nprediction and theory development.\nThe systematic procedure for applying PLS-SEM involves\nthe following steps: (a) specification of the structural model,\n(b) specification of the measurement models, (c) data collec-\ntion and examination, (d) PLS path model estimation, (e)\nreflective and formative model assessment, and (f) assess-\nment of the structural model.\nThe first step of estimation of PLS-SEM is to test for the\nreflective measurement scale where the indicators are highly\ncorrelated and interchangeable (Haenlein & Kaplan, 2004;\nand validity of reflective latent indicators are examined using\ntheir outer loadings, composite reliability, and average vari-\nance extracted (AVE) and its square root. If the construct is\nof formative measurement scale, where indicators are not\ninterchangeable, then it can be avoided.\nThe final stage of evaluation of the structural model con-\nsists of examining the coefficients of determination, predic-\ntive relevance, and size and significance of path coefficients;\nmeasurement of effect sizes by means of F2; and estimation\nof Q2 to find the predictive relevance through blindfolding.\nModel Specification\nThe PLS-SEM model proposed in the study assumes that dis-\ncretionary investment intensity (DII) of food sector firms is a\nfunction of financial policies and firm characteristics. The\nfinancial policies examined are basically capital investment\ndecisions and working capital policies. Firm's financial per-\nformance is also a major determinant of the investment\nintensity of discretionary expenditures like R&D. Firm's\ncharacteristics such as size, growth, risk, and leverage also\naffect the R&D intensity. The variables selected for latent\nconstruct DII were variables of R&D expenses and advertis-\ning expenses scaled by total assets, capital expenditures, and\ncash flows. The variable reflecting intangible asset was also\nincluded in the latent construct DII. The growth rates in\nsales, assets, cash flow, and net income were included in\nlatent construct GROWTH. The latent construct RISK was\ncomposed of variables such as variance of net income, sales,\nand cash flow. The cash flow measures are scaled by total\nassets and sales. The liquidity and leverage ratios are also\nincluded in their respective latent constructs. The proxy for\ninvestment measures were the variables of capital expendi-\nture and working capital which were scaled by sales. Proxy\nfor size measure was log of assets, sales, and net worth.\nReturn on equity, return on assets, profit after tax scaled by\ntotal assets, net worth, and total income were the major vari-\nables included in the construct of profitability. The proposed\nmodel for DII is framed with respect to latent constructs as\ngiven in the diagrammatic design for the path diagram (see\nFigure 1).\nThe values of latent construct DII are for the year 2013.\nThe other latent constructs have variables with average values\nyear 2009. Descriptive statistics are presented in Appendix A.\nFood Industry: A Snap Shot\nIndia is the world's second largest producer of food. The food\nprocessing industry is one of the largest industries in India\nand is ranked fifth in terms of production, consumption,\nexport, and expected growth. The total food production in\nIndia is likely to double in the next 10 years with the country's\ndomestic food market estimated to reach US$258 billion by\nAgriculture, which provides employment to 52% of the popu-\nlation, is estimated to account for 14% of the country's GDP.\nPresently, the Indian food processing industry accounts for\n32% of the country's total food market. Agricultural &\nProcessed food products Export Development Authority\n(APEDA) and Marine Products Export Development\nAuthority (MPEDA) are the two agencies established by gov-\nernment of India for promotion of exports. The food industry\nin India has been attracting a lot of attention from foreign\ninvestors as the country is close to the markets of Middle\nEast, Africa, and South East Asia. The food manufacturing\nindustry is one of the United States's largest manufacturing\nsectors, accounting for more than 10% of all manufacturing\nshipments. In 2013, the U.S. food and beverage manufactur-\ning sector employed about 1.5 million people or just more\nfood and beverage manufacturing plants are located through-\nout the country.\nExpenditure on R&D is one of the most widely used mea-\nsures of innovation inputs. R&D intensity is expressed as\nR&D expenditure as a percentage of GDP. Israel has the\nhighest R&D intensity, with gross domestic expenditure on\nR&D (GERD) in excess of 4% of GDP.\nR&D expenditure in the industrial sectors (both private\nand public) constitutes 30.4% of the total R&D expenditure\nof India. According to the Report of Research and\nDevelopment Statistics (2008), industrial R&D expenditure\nwas highest in the drug and pharmaceutical industry with a\nshare of 37.4% of total R&D expenditures as compared with\nother industries.\nIn India, very few firms spend on R&D activities and its\nintensity is very low. In food product manufacturing indus-\ntry, the 5-year average R&D intensity is 0.12. See Appendix\nB for industry wise R&D intensity in India. About 167 firms\nreported R&D expenses out of 1,150 firms. In terms of\namount spent, ITC Limited leads in the food industry with\n848.67 million Indian rupees, but in terms of R&D intensity\nSujit and Rajesh 5\n(R&D/sales), ITC ranks very low at 50. In terms of research\nintensity, Green Earth Bio Tech leads in food industry with\n34% followed by Venkateshwara Research & Breeding Farm\nPvt. Limited with 33%. In terms of R&D intensity, small\nfirms rank higher. See Tables 2 and 3, for example, though\nfood major ITC tops in R&D expenses, it occupies a low\nranking in terms of R&D intensity. This study provides\nunique results in terms of anomaly.\nEmpirical Analysis\nIn PLS-SEM, the significance of factor loading is assessed\nby the bootstrapping procedure with minimum samples of\n5,000 and the number of cases equivalent to sample size (n =\n50). Bootstrapping is a non-parametric procedure which can\nbe applied to test whether coefficients such as outer weights,\nouter loadings, and path coefficients are significant by esti-\nmating standard errors for the estimates. In the bootstrapping\nprocess, the subsamples are created with observations ran-\ndomly drawn from the original data set (with replacement).\nThrough the process of bootstrapping, reflective and for-\nmative indicators which were not significantly loading with\ntheir respective loadings or not meeting the criteria were\nremoved from the model. For reflective indicators, outer\nloading relevance testing is carried out based on the follow-\ning criteria. If outer loading is less than 0.4, the reflective\nindicator is deleted. If the outer loading is less than 0.7 but\ngreater than 0.4, then the impact of indicator deletion on\nAVE and the composite reliability are analyzed. If the dele-\ntion increases the measures above the threshold, the reflec-\ntive indicator is deleted. If the measures already meet the\nthreshold, then the reflective indicator is retained. The reflec-\ntive indicators like NCFIA/SA (latent construct CASH\nFLOW); OUTSOUR/SA (latent construct EXT); AG, NIG,\nPBDITGR (latent construct GROWTH); DAR (latent con-\nstruct LEV); and DTR (latent construct OPEFFI) were elimi-\nnated as their loadings were less than 0.4.\nValidity Assessment of Reflective Measurement\nModels\nThe PLS-SEM algorithm has converged. The assessment of the\nreflective measurement model is done through indicator reli-\nability, internal consistency reliability, convergent validity, and\nFigure 1.

The indicator reliabilities for reflective\nmeasures are analyzed by examining the outer loadings.\nIndicator reliability is also known as indicator communality.\nAll the reflective indicators of latent construct RISK (VARIN,\nVARPBDITA, VARSA) were found to be statistically signifi-\ncant. All the reflective indicators of latent construct SIZE\n8 SAGE Open\n(LNW, LSA, LTA) were statistically significant. The reflective\nindicators of OPEFFI (FATR, SA/NFA, NWCTR);\n(SG) were found to be statistically significant. On the basis of\ncriteriaforselectionforreflectiveindicatorswithvaluebetween\n0.4 and 0.7, the reflective indicator variable ROE was also\ndeleted.\nTable 4 shows the outer loadings of the indicator reli-\nabilities after removal of the non-significant indicator vari-\nables. All the variables except RD/TA are reflective\nindicator variables. All reflective indicator variables are\nstatistically significant. There is only one retained reflec-\ntive variable in the latent construct EXT. Hence, its outer\nloadings are equal to 1. Similarly, there is only one forma-\ntive indicator in the construct DII. DII refers to the mea-\nsures of discretionary expenditures incurred by the sample\nof firms in the food industry. In this study, the discretionary\nexpenses considered are the R&D measures. The initial for-\nmative variables used included RD/PBDIT, RD/SA, and\nRD/TA. In the final path construct, only the significant\nvariable of RD/TA was found to be relevant and retained.\nDiscretionary expenditures basically refer to advertising\nand R&D expenses. In the initial model, we included mea-\nsures of advertising variables such as Advertisement/Sales\nand Advertisement/Total Assets. But the loading values\nwere very low and insignificant.\nAnalysis of Internal Consistency of Reflective\nIndicators\nThe internal consistency reliability is analyzed through com-\nposite reliability and Cronbach's alpha in Tables 5 and 6,\nrespectively.\nGenerally composite reliability values of greater than 0.6\nare acceptable. The p values are statistically significant for\nall the latent constructs measuring growth, investment deci-\nsions, leverage, liquidity, operational efficiency, profitability,\nrisk, size, and external factors. The latent construct EXT and\nGROWTH have reliability value of 1 as only one reflective\nindicator is present in the latent construct.\nA Cronbach's alpha measure of value 0.7 is considered\nreliable. Majority of the constructs have Cronbach's alpha\nvalue greater than 0.7. The Cronbach's alpha can be consid-\nered as the lower bound and the composite reliability as the\nupper bound of the true internal consistency reliability.\nMeasurement of Convergent Validity\nThe AVE is the measure of convergent validity. AVE is the\ngrand mean of the squared loadings of all indicators associ-\nated with the construct. Each construct should account for at\nleast 50% of the assigned indicators variance. It is also\nreferred to as construct commonality. All the constructs sat-\nisfy the convergent validity criterion as shown in Table 7.\nTable 4.

Average Variance Extracted.\nLatent construct Original sample Sample mean p Value\nDII\nNote. DII = discretionary investment intensity.\nEach latent construct in the model has 50% or more of the\nassigned indicator variance.\nDiscriminant Validity\nDiscriminant validity is tested by means of assessment tests\nsuch as Fornell\u00adLarcker criterion, cross loadings criterion,\nand the heterotrait-monotrait ratio of correlations (HTMT)\nas presented in Tables 8, 9, and 10, respectively.\nThe Fornell\u00adLarcker criterion suggests that the square\nroot of AVE must be greater than the correlation of the con-\nstruct with all other constructs including the formative mea-\nsures in the structural model. The above criterion is satisfied\nwith respect to all the constructs.\nAccording to the cross loading criterion, each indicator\nmust load highest on the construct in which it is an indicator\nmeasured both in terms of reflective and formative\nmeasures.\nHTMT Criterion\nHTMT is the average heterotrait-heteromethod correlations\nrelative to the average monotrait-heteromethod correlations.\nMonotrait-heteromethod correlations represent correlations\nof indicators measuring the same construct. Heterotrait-\nheteromethod correlations are correlations of indicators\nacross constructs measuring different phenomena. HTMT\nvalues close to 1 indicate lack of discriminant validity. The\nthreshold value is considered close to 0.85. The constructs in\nthis study satisfy the discriminant validity assessment on the\nbasis of HTMT. The exception value is found for only con-\nstruct profitability versus investment decision.\nTable 9. Cross Loadings Criterion.\nLatent\nNote. DII = Discretionary investment Intensity.\nTable 8. Fornell\u00adLarcker Criterion.\nNote. DII = discretionary investment intensity.\nValidity Assessment of Formative Measurement\nModels\nThe validity assessment of formative measurement models\nconsists of assessing the collinearity issues and assessment of\nsignificance and relevance of the formative indicators.\nCollinearity issues occur when two or more indicators of a\nconstruct are highly correlated. Collinearity assessment is\ndone through the analysis of Variance Inflation Factors (VIFs).\nIf there are no critical levels of collinearity (i.e., VIF < 5), then\nthe assessment of formative measures enters the next stage.\nTable 11 reveals that all VIF values are less than 5. The\nouter VIF values also satisfy the conditions of lack of\nmulti-collinearity.\nThe next stage involves assessing the relevance of the for-\nmative indicators. The outer weight is assessed to be signifi-\ncant or not. If the outer weight is significant, then the\noperation is continued with the interpretation of the outer\nweight's absolute and relative size. If the outer weight is not\nsignificant, then the formative indicator's outer loading is\nanalyzed. If the outer loading is less than 0.5, then the sig-\nnificance of the formative indicator's outer loading is tested.\nIf the outer loading is less than 0.5 and not significant, then\nthe formative indicator is deleted. If the outer loading is less\nthan 0.5 but is significant, then the removal of indicator may\nbe considered. If the outer loading is greater than 0.5, then\nthe indicator is retained even if it is not significant. Based on\nall these selection criteria, the only formative indicator which\nwas included in the latent construct DII was RD/TA(research\nand development expenses / total assets). All other formative\nindicators representing advertising intensities and R&D\nintensities were deleted due to non-relevance based on selec-\ntion criteria as discussed above.\nAssessment of the Structural Model\nThe assessment of the structural model consists of five steps.\nIn the first step, the structural model is assessed for collinear-\nity issues. The VIF values are found to be less than 5. Hence,\nstructurally the model does not have collinearity issues. The\nsecond step involves assessing the significance and relevance\nof the structural model relationships. The process involves\ntesting the significance and relevance of path coefficients.\nThe path coefficients vary between -1 and +1. The type of\neffects is divided into direct effects, indirect effect, and total\neffects. The third step involves examination of coefficient of\ndetermination R2. R2 is a measure of the model's predictive\naccuracy. The fourth step involves measurement of effect\nsizes by means of F2. The last step involves estimation of Q2\nto find the predictive relevance through blindfolding.\nPath coefficient analysis explains the relevance and sig-\nnificance of path coefficients. Higher absolute values denote\nstronger predictive relationship between constructs. Direct\neffect measures the relationship linking two constructs with\na single arrow between the two. Indirect effect measures the\nsequence of relationship with at least one intervening con-\nstruct involved. The total effect is the sum of the direct effect\nand all indirect effects linking the two constructs.\nThe constructs signifying cash flow measures, externality\n(in terms of royalty measures), liquidity, and risk measures\nare directly and positively related to DII. The constructs sig-\nnifying leverage and size are negatively related to DII. The\nrelationship of risk and size with DII is statistically signifi-\ncant as shown in Table 12.\nTable 10. Discriminant Validity Assessment Through Heterotrait-Monotrait Ratio.\nTable 11. Collinearity Statistics Inner (VIF) Values.\nDII\nNote. VIF = Variance Inflation Factor; DII = discretionary investment intensity.\nThe indicator variable values represent the average values\nfor the period t-1 to t-4. The indicator variables for DII were\nfor the period t. The path coefficient analysis reveals that\nhigher the cash flow generation by the food sector firms,\ngreater would be the R&D investments by the firm. But the\nresults are not statistically significant. The royalty payments\nare directly related to R&D investments. This indicates that\nIndian firms in food industry use R&D efforts to adapt,\nassimilate, and develop imported technology. This result is\nsimilar to the findings of Katrak (1989) and Narayanan\n(1998). Firms with higher growth are more profitable. But\nthe results do not show statistical significance.\nThe path coefficient for construct investment decisions\n(INVESTDECI) is 0.381 with statistical significance at all\nlevels of significance. Higher the investments of the firms in\nterms of capital expenditures and working capital, higher is\nthe profitability of the firms. Hence, the investment policy of\nthe firms is a crucial determinant of the profitability of firms\nin food sector in India.\nLeverage is negatively related to R&D intensity with no\nstatistical significance. Higher the financial leverage of food\nsector firms, lower will be the investments in R&D. Firms\nwith high leverage are considered to be riskier and hence\nsuch firms may not be proactive in R&D investments. Firms\nwith higher liquidity positions would invest more in R&D.\nThe results are not statistically significant in this case.\nFood industry firms which are able to manage their assets\nefficiently are found to be more profitable. Higher the asset\nturnover ratios or asset management efficiency, higher is the\nprofitability of firms. The path coefficient value of the origi-\nnal sample was 0.659 with statistical significance at 1%\nlevel.\nThe statistical significance of the relationship between\nprofitability and R&D intensity is not established. Profitable\nfirms may not focus much on R&D intensity.\nThe risk measures were analyzed through indicators rep-\nresenting variance of cash flow measures. The results sug-\ngest that riskier firms tend to invest much in R&D. It can be\ninterpreted that riskier firms in food sector might focus on\nR&D investments as a strategy to generate more cash flows.\nThe path coefficient value was 0.142 with statistical signifi-\nSize is negatively related to R&D intensity. The path coef-\nficient value was -0.508 with statistical significance at all lev-\nels. Smaller firms in food sector tend to invest more in R&D.\nR2 is a measure of the model's predictive accuracy. It repre-\nsents the amount of variance in the endogenous constructs\nexplained by all of the exogenous constructs linked to it. The\nthe exogenous variables used in the study accounts for 37.9%\nof variation in the in the endogenous construct DII. Similarly,\nabout 70.5% of variation in profitability is explained by the\nexogenous variables associated with the construct.\nF2 measures the size effects. It assesses how strongly one\nexogenous construct contributes to explaining a certain\nendogenous construct in terms of R2. INVESTDECI to\nstrong effects (value greater than 0.35) and rest of the con-\nstructs have weak effects.\nBlindfolding is an iterative procedure in which different\nparts of data matrix are omitted. The estimates based on the\nreduced data sets are used to predict the omitted parts. The\nprediction error is used as an indicator of predictive rele-\nvance. Q2 value of 0.058 for DII signifies weak effect and\n0.286 for PROFITABILITY signifies moderate effect.\nOriginal sample Sample mean SE T Statistics (|original sample/SE|) p Value\nNote.

DII = discretionary investment intensity.\nInterpretation of Results\nThe study aims to analyze the impact of financial policies and\nfirm characteristics on the discretionary investment strategy of\nthe food industry firms. Using the PLS-SEM model, the study\naims to understand the impact of financial policies on profit-\nability and, in turn, its effect on the R&D investment strategy.\nAnother focus of the article is to explore the impact of charac-\nteristics like size, leverage, risk, royalty, and outsourcing capa-\nbilities on the discretionary investment strategy of the firm.\nThe investment policy decisions of firms in this sector are a\nmajor determinant of the profitability. The study finds that\nhigher investments in the form of capital expenditures and\nworking capital lead to higher profitability for firms in the\nfood industry sector. It can be interpreted that firms in food\nindustry sector would be able to enhance the profitability\nthrough sound capital investment decisions (selecting projects\nwith positive NPV) and improving the working capital effi-\nciency. Efficient management of assets also increases the prof-\nitability of the firms. However, the results could not establish\nthe relationship between profitability and discretionary invest-\nment characteristics of food sector firms. The results do not\nshow statistical significance to suggest that profitable firms\ninvest more in R&D activities. Higher the risk, greater is the\npropensity to invest in R&D activities. Smaller firms tend to\ninvest more in R&D activities (see Appendix C).\nConclusion and Implications\nThis study explores the determinants of discretionary expenses\nusing PLS method. These determinants are considered as\nlatent factors which can directly or indirectly influence the\ndecision to invest in discretionary expenses. R&D and adver-\ntisement intensities are taken as discretionary expenses. In the\ninitial analysis on account of low loading values which were\ninsignificant, the advertising variable indicators were deleted\nfrom the discretionary investment construct.\nUsing PLS-SEM, the paths of these relationships are\nexplored. This method allows to include different variables\nmeasuring latent factors. The result of the model shows that\ninvestment decision and operational efficiency are impor-\ntant factors which influence profitability. Manager's ability\nto create value depends on the three major policy decisions\ninvolving investments, financing, and working capital man-\nagement. The results of the study indicate that firms which\ninvest in capital expenditure would create value for firms in\nform of increased profitability. Efficient asset utilization\nalso emerges as a determinant of profitability of food sector\nfirms. However, profitability turned out to be not influenc-\ning discretionary expenses. Riskier firms tend to invest\nmore in discretionary expenses. It can be interpreted that\ninvestments in R&D itself is a risk-taking initiative for\nfirms. Riskier firms in food sector might focus on R&D\ninvestments as a strategy to generate more cash flows. It is\nalso interesting that size turned out to be negatively related\nto discretionary expenses. This study allows the managers to\nsee the impacts of many variables representing latent factors\nwhich directly or indirectly influence their decision to invest\non discretionary expenses. This allows the managers to pur-\nsue appropriate strategies for determining discretionary\nexpenses.\nAppendix A\nDescriptive Statistics.\nVariables M Median SD Minimum Maximum\n(continued)\nVariables M Median SD Minimum Maximum\nNote.
