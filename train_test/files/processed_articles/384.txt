    "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nPrevious reports on pernicious anemia treatment suggested that high\nfolic acid intake adversely influences the natural history of vitamin\nB-12 deficiency, which affects many elderly individuals. However,\nexperimental investigation of this hypothesis is unethical, and the\nfew existing observational data are inconclusive. With the use of data\nvey (NHANES), we evaluated the interaction between high serum\nfolate and low vitamin B-12 status [ie, plasma vitamin B-12 ,\n148 pmol/L or methylmalonic acid (MMA) . 210 nmol/L] with re-\nspect to anemia and cognitive impairment. With subjects having both\nplasma folate 59 nmol/L and normal vitamin B-12 status as the\nreferent category, odds ratios for the prevalence of anemia compared\nwith normal hemoglobin concentration and impaired compared with\nB-12 status and plasma folate .59 nmol/L. Among subjects\nwith low vitamin B-12 status, mean circulating vitamin B-12 was\n228 pmol/L for the normal-folate subgroup and 354 pmol/L for\nthe high-folate subgroup. We subsequently showed increases in cir-\nculating homocysteine and MMA concentrations with increasing se-\nrum folate among NHANES participants with serum vitamin B-12 ,\n148 pmol/L, whereas the opposite trends occurred among subjects\nwith serum vitamin B-12 ! 148 pmol/L. These interactions, which\nwere not seen in NHANES III before fortification, imply that, in\nvitamin B-12 deficiency, high folate status is associated with im-\npaired activity of the 2 vitamin B-12\u00addependent enzymes, methionine\nsynthase and MMA\u00adcoenzyme A mutase.

Specifically, a carbon unit from serine or\nglycine reacts with tetrahydrofolate (THF) to form methylene-\nTHF. This may be used for the synthesis of thymidylate, a DNA\nnucleotide, or for purine synthesis. Folate deficiency-related\nmacrocytic anemia is due to failure of precursor blood cells to\ndivide because of a lack of DNA. The adverse effect of vitamin\nB-12 deficiency on DNA synthesis is explained by the ``meth-\nylfolate trap hypothesis'' (1). Vitamin B-12 acts as a cofactor for\nmethionine synthase (MS), which catalyzes the remethylation of\nhomocysteine to methionine. The methyl group is donated by\nmethyl-THF, which is derived by the irreversible reduction of\nmethylene-THF to methyl-THF by methylene-THF reductase.\nIf MS is inactivated by a lack of vitamin B-12, the result is\na functional folate deficiency (ie, a lack of the nonmethylated\nfolates needed for serine-glycine interconversion and the syn-\nthesis of purines and pyrimidines) as folate becomes in-\ncreasingly ``trapped'' as methyl-THF.\nHyperhomocysteinemia is another consequence of deficiencies\nof either folate or vitamin B-12 (2). This effect is due, in part, to\nthe requirement by MS for both folate and vitamin B-12. Fur-\nthermore, a considerable proportion of the methionine that\nresults from homocysteine remethylation is converted to\nS-adenosylmethionine, which regulates the one-carbon pathway\nby inhibiting methylene-THF reductase and activating the\nhomocysteine-disposing enzyme, cystathionine-b synthase.\nS-adenosylmethionine also serves as the sole methyl donor for\nthe central nervous system, which may explain associations\nbetween folate deficiency and vitamin B-12 deficiency and\ncognitive impairment and mental illness (3, 4). One of the most\ndevastating consequences of vitamin B-12 deficiency is a classic\nneuropathy called combined degeneration of the spinal cord (5).\nThe mechanism by which vitamin B-12 deficiency leads to this\nfatal demyelinating illness is unknown, but its specific link to\nvitamin B-12 deficiency, but not folate deficiency, may provide\na clue to the causal pathway.\nAnother unique consequence of vitamin B-12 deficiency\nrelates to its role in the isomerization of L-methylmalonyl\u00ad\n1 From the Jean Mayer US Department of Agriculture Human Nutrition\nResearch Center on Aging at Tufts University, Boston, MA.\n2 Presented at the symposium ``Is It Time for Mandatory Vitamin B-12\nFortification in Flour?'' held at Experimental Biology 2008, San Diego, CA,\n3 Any opinions, findings, conclusions, or recommendations expressed in\nthis publication are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the\nview of the US Department of Agriculture.\n5 Reprints not available.

Thus, vitamin B-12 deficiency specifi-\ncally results in increased methylmalonic acid (MMA) concen-\ntrations in both plasma and urine.\nPernicious anemia and excessive intake of folic acid\nAfter studying malnourished pregnant women in India in the\nlate 1920s, Lucy Wills described a macrocytic anemia that shared\nsome features with the blood abnormalities of elderly Europeans\nwith pernicious anemia (6). For example, the cytologic proper-\nties of the 2 anemias were identical, and both types responded\nwell to crude liver extract. However, only the tropical illness\nresponded to yeast extract. Furthermore, although purified liver\nextract had proved effective in the treatment of pernicious\nanemia, it did not cure the tropical form (6). This difference in\nresponse between the 2 anemias led to the suggestion that the\n``Wills factor'' in the yeast extract was distinct from the ``ex-\ntrinsic factor'' in the purified liver extract. This hypothesis was\nsubsequently verified. However, the identification of vitamin\nB-12 as the anti\u00adpernicious anemia factor in liver (7) followed\nthe isolation of folic acid from yeast (8) by several years, during\nwhich time folic acid was administered in large doses to patients\nwith pernicious anemia (9). Because the inappropriateness of\nthis treatment quickly became apparent, reports of cases thus\nbody of literature on the effect of folic acid administration on\nReviews of the historic case reports allude to rapid neurologic\ndeterioration after improvement of anemia (10, 11). Conse-\nquently, the idea has developed that excessive intake of folic\nacid can obscure or mask vitamin B-12 deficiency and poten-\ntially delay its diagnosis until neurologic consequences become\nirreversible (13). Although some have questioned the connection\nbetween masking and either the diagnosis of vitamin B-12 de-\ndescribed the neurologic deterioration that occurred after folic\nacid administration as ``explosive'' and suggested that folic acid\nmight actually exert a detrimental effect on the central nervous\nsystem. Furthermore, Israels and Wilkinson (11) wrote that\n``some patients who had not previously shown signs of nervous\nsystem disturbances developed such signs, often very acutely,\nafter being treated with folic acid for variable periods'' (p 1072).\nFood folic acid fortification and the debate on folic acid\nsafety\nThe move by the United States and other governments to\nfortify staple food products with folic acid for the prevention of\nneural tube defects rekindled the debate over the safety of folic\nacid for the elderly, who are at high risk of vitamin B-12 de-\nficiency. On the basis of the historic case reports, as well as the\nknown metabolic interaction between folate and vitamin B-12,\nand animal data showing a link between folate supplementation\nand rapid development of neuropathology in animal deficient for\nvitamin B-12, the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of\nMedicine called the evidence for precipitation or exacerbation\nof the neurologic damage of vitamin B-12 deficiency by excess\nsupplemental folate intake ``suggestive'' and selected that end-\npoint, which was associated with intakes ! 5 mg/d, as the critical\nendpoint for the development of a tolerable upper intake for folate\n(13). Division of 5 mg/d by an uncertainty factor of 5 resulted in\nan upper intake of 1 mg/d. The high degree of uncertainty led\nsome to question the safety of fortification (19, 20) and inspired\nothers to criticize the upper intake as too conservative (21, 22).\nParticularly in light of continued demands for a higher level of\nfortification (23, 24), clearly defining the benefits and risks of\nhigh folic acid intake assumes vital importance. Writing about\nthis challenge, Moore (25) observed that the current fortification\nprogram provides the perfect opportunity for epidemiologic\nstudy of the unanswered questions, including those related to the\ninteraction between folate and vitamin B-12.\nFolate status and intake in the era of folic acid fortification\nMandatory folic acid fortification of enriched cereal grain\nproducts sold in the United States officially took effect in January\n1998 (26). Not surprisingly, the first report on the program's\neffect showed that fortification resulted in a marked increase in\nfolate status (27, 28). Specifically, mean plasma folate increased\n(23 nmol/L) after fortification (P , 0.001). Furthermore, the\nprevalence of folate deficiency decreased from 22.0% to 1.7%.\nAlthough the mandated fortification of 140 lg folic acid/100 g\nflour was estimated to increase folic acid intake by '100 lg/d (26),\nour estimates (29) and those of others (30) suggest that the ac-\ntual increase in intake from fortification was about twice that\nhigh. Furthermore, because of the combined intake of fortified\ncereal grain products, vitamin supplements, and voluntarily\nfortified breakfast cereals, a substantial proportion of Framing-\nham Offspring Cohort members consumed .1 mg folic acid/d.\nIndeed, 11% of supplement-using cohort members and '0.3%\nof nonusers exceeded the upper intake amount (29).\nTo test the hypothesis that the high folate status achievable in\nthe era of mandatory folic acid fortification affects the con-\nsequences of vitamin B-12 deficiency, either by a masking\nphenomenon or by exacerbating neurologic effects, we used data\ncollected in recent versions of the National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES) to evaluate the interaction be-\ntween high serum folate and low vitamin B-12 status in relation to\nseveral outcomes linked to vitamin B-12 deficiency; namely,\nanemia, macrocytosis, cognitive impairment, elevated homo-\ncysteine concentrations, and elevated MMA concentrations (31,\n32). We review and discuss the results of these studies here.\nMETHODS\nWe used data collected in the NHANES conducted during the\nthose aged !60 y), the only group whose cognitive function was\nbility requirements, complete data for analyses pertaining to\nanemia were available for 1458 subjects, and complete data for\nanalyses pertaining to cognitive function were available for 1302\nsubjects. Demographic and health data were collected by in-\nterview, and cognitive function was assessed by using a version of\nthe Digit Symbol-Substitution subtest of the Wechsler Adult\nIntelligence Scale III--a screening test designed to detect cog-\nnitive impairment in adults and children (33). Blood samples\nwere drawn and analyzed for biochemical markers, and a com-\nplete blood count was performed.\nWe defined low vitamin B-12 status as serum vitamin B-12 ,\nlished reference range for serum vitamin B-12\u00adreplete survey\nparticipants with normal serum creatinine concentrations (34)].\nWe defined anemia according to criteria from the World Health\nOrganization[ie,hemoglobin,12g/dLforwomenand,13g/dL\nfor men (35)], and macrocytosis as a mean cell volume . 99 fL.\nFinally, we used distribution-based cutoffs to define high serum\nfolate (ie, !59 nmol/L, the 80th percentile) and cognitive im-\npairment (ie, Digit Symbol-Substitution subtest score , 34/133,\nthe 20th percentile).\nInteraction between vitamin B-12 status and serum folate\nData displayed in Table 1 summarize the interaction between\nserum folate and vitamin B-12 status in relation to anemia and\naddress the potential role of homocysteine in the associations.\nThe tabulated data show that having low vitamin B-12 status,\nregardless of serum folate, was associated with a significantly\nincreased prevalence of both anemia and cognitive impairment.\nFurthermore, compared with having normal status for both vi-\ntamins, having high serum folate but normal vitamin B-12 status\nwas associated with a reduced prevalence of anemia and a sig-\nnificantly reduced prevalence of cognitive impairment. The\nworst combination was low vitamin B-12 status and high serum\nfolate. Specifically, anemia and cognitive impairment were ob-\nserved '5 times as often in the group with that combination as\nin the group with normal vitamin B-12 status and normal serum\nfolate. That the odds ratios were only modestly affected by\ncontrolling for homocysteine concentrations suggests that the\nhematologic and cognitive risks and benefits were not directly\naffected by homocysteine increases or decreases.\nThese data represent important epidemiologic evidence of an\nadverse interaction between high folate status and low vitamin\nB-12 status. Consequently, they seem to support the idea that the\nneuropsychiatric consequences of vitamin B-12 deficiency are\nexacerbated by high folate status. We also noted with interest that,\nin the Nurses' Health Study, although multivitamin users in the\nhighest plasma vitamin B-12 quartile category preformed some-\nwhat better on cognitive function tests than did subjects who did\nnot use supplements and were in the lowest quartile category for\nplasma vitamin B-12 (mean difference in global cognitive\nwere, nevertheless, in the lowest vitamin B-12 quartile category\nperformed worse than the comparison subjects (mean difference\ncause folic acid is a normal constituent of multivitamin pills,\nthese findings may also reflect the adverse interaction between\nhigh folate status and low vitamin B-12 status in relation to\ncognition.\nOur observation of a higher prevalence of not only cognitive\nimpairment but also anemia in association with high folate status\namong American seniors deficient for vitamin B-12 suggests that\nthe interaction is a general biological phenomenon (ie, that it\naffects all health consequences of vitamin B-12 deficiency). This\nfinding also seems to be supported by a report from Pune, India,\nof a higher prevalence of hyperglycemia (which was associated\nwith maternal vitamin B-12 deficiency) among children born to\nmothers deficient for vitamin B-12 with high folate status than\namong children born to mothers deficient for vitamin B-12 with\nlower folate status (20).\nInteraction between circulating vitamin B-12 and folate\nconcentrations in relation to circulating concentrations\nof the 2 indicators of vitamin B-12 function, homocysteine\nand MMA\nIn this study of the general US population in the age of folic\nacid fortification (32), we found that homocysteine does not\ngenerally decrease with increasing folate status among people\nwith low serum concentrations of vitamin B-12 (Table 2).\nSpecifically, although geometric mean homocysteine and geo-\nmetric mean MMA decreased significantly across increasing\nserum folate categories among survey participants with serum\nwere observed for subjects with serum vitamin B-12 , 148\npmol/L. Furthermore, geometric mean homocysteine for sub-\njects with low serum vitamin B-12 and serum folate , 19.3\nInteraction between vitamin B-12 status and serum folate in relation to anemia and cognitive impairment among nonexcluded senior participants in the\nVitamin status\nNo. of\nSubjects\nPercentage\n1 Low serum vitamin B-12 , 148 pmol/L or serum methylmalonic acid above reference range (ie, 60\u00ad210 nmol/L) for vitamin B-12\u00adreplete participants\nwith normal serum creatinine.\n2 High serum folate . 59 nmol/L (80th percentile).\nnmol/L was in the normal range and close to that of subjects in\nthe same serum folate category with higher serum vitamin B-12.\nHowever, the mean for the group with low serum vitamin B-12\nand serum folate . 32.6 nmol/L was nearly 12 lmol/L, a com-\nmonly used cutoff for hyperhomocystinemia, and serum MMA\nwas extremely elevated.\nIn vitamin B-12 deficiency, high homocysteine reflects im-\npaired MS activity, whereas high MMA indicates impaired\nmethylmalonyl-CoA mutase activity. Consequently, our findings\nsuggest that both pathways of vitamin B-12 metabolism are\nadversely affected by high serum folate despite the direct in-\nvolvement of folate only in MS activity. Simultaneous impair-\nment of both pathways is normally caused by insufficient intake\nof vitamin B-12 or by the disruption of early steps in vitamin\nB-12 processing (1, 23). The latter include intrinsic factor-\nmediated intestinal absorption, formation of the vitamin B-12\u00ad\ntranscobalamin II complex in plasma, transport of the complex\ninto peripheral tissue by a receptor-mediated endocytosis, in-\ncorporation of the complex into lysosomes, dissociation of the\ncomplex and exit of vitamin B-12 as acquocob(III)alamin into\nthe cytosol, and reduction to cob(II)alamin for subsequent dis-\ntribution to MS in the cytosol or to the mitochondria. The event\nthat effects the simultaneous disruption of both pathways could\nalso occur after the distribution of vitamin B-12 to the respective\ncompartments in the course of rendering the vitamin available\nfor interaction with the respective enzyme proteins or during\ncatalysis.\nWe found no adverse interactions between high serum folate\nand low vitamin B-12 status among participants of the NHANES\nfortification took effect (19). Although most of the seniors with\nserum folate concentrations . 59 nmol/L who participated in\nthrough the combined intake of enriched cereal grain products,\nfortified breakfast cereals, and multivitamins, the influence of\nfortification is indicated by the 40% prevalence of serum\nfolate . 59 nmol/L among supplement-using seniors who par-\nprevalence among comparable participants in the NHANES III.\nNote that most subjects with high folate status consumed sup-\nplemental vitamin B-12 and absorbed it.

Although un-\npublished results of our analyses of Framingham Study data\nshowed that 80% of the folate ingested by people with circu-\nlating folate concentrations . 50 nmol/L was in the form of\nfolic acid, it remains to be determined whether the interaction we\nobserved is a unique consequence of circulating unmetabolized\nfolic acid or merely the result of a high total (ie, both reduced and\noxidized) mass of body folate (Other articles in this supplement to\nThe authors' responsibilities were as follows--JS: originated the idea and\nreviewed the manuscript; MSM: performed statistical analyses and prepared\nthe manuscript; PFJ: reviewed statistical results and contributed to the man-\nuscript; and IHR: discussed ideas and reviewed the manuscript.
