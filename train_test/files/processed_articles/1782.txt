Approximately 72 million Americans are cur-\nrently living with hypertension, and the estimated direct and\nEffective drug therapies have been available for several\ndecades and the substantial benefit of hypertension treatment\non coronary heart disease and stroke has been demonstrated\nin numerous clinical trials.2\u00ad5 However, most population-\nbased studies indicate that a large proportion of hypertensive\npersons who are on drug therapy still have elevated blood\npressure (BP), and a considerable proportion of hyperten-\nsive persons are not even treated with any antihypertensive\nprevalence of hypertension has increased\nover the past decade,10 it is important to understand current\nantihypertensive medication utilization patterns and to study\ntheir impact on BP control and hypertension-related clinical\noutcomes.\nHistorically, hypertension in women has received little\nattention compared to their male counterparts because men\nhave a higher incidence of total cardiovascular end points at\nall ages.11 Early clinical trials of treating mild-to-moderate\nhypertension were primarily conducted on a middle-aged\nmale population, and most decisions regarding hypertensive\ntreatment for women prior to the 1990's were based on data\nobtained from trials done predominately on male patients.\nAlthough some studies have shown that the treatment of\nhypertension among women conferred less benefit against\ncardiac events compared to antihypertensive treatment\namong men,12\u00ad14 large long-term clinical trials of antihy-\npertensive treatment include both men and women have not\narticles Hypertension Treatment and Control\ndemonstrated clinical significant gender differences in BP\nresponse and outcomes,15,16 and the national guidelines rec-\nommend the same approach for treating hypertensive men\nand women.\nAntihypertensive medication use in the hypertensive popu-\nlation significantly increased in the past 10 years.17 However,\ndirect comparison of the reduction of BP using hypertensive\ntreatment between men and women with the same age, the\nsame ethnicity, and the same coexisting medical conditions\nhas not been performed. To understand gender-related dif-\nferences in the treatment and control of hypertension, we\nused the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\nhypertensive medication use among US adults with hyperten-\nsion, to compare the utilization patterns between hypertensive\nmen and women, and to access the impact of pharmacological\ntreatment on BP control rates.\nMethods\nsurvey based on a nationally representative sample of the\ncivilian noninstitutionalized US population.18 Survey partici-\npants received a detailed in-person home interview, followed\nby a physical examination including BP measurements at a\nmobile examination center. Informed consent was obtained\nfrom all participants, and the protocol was approved by the\ninstitutional review board of the National Center for Health\nStatistics.\nDuring the home interview, participants were asked, \"Have\nyou taken or used any prescription medicines in the past\nmonth?\" Respondents who answered affirmatively were fur-\nther asked to report the name, duration, and main reason for\neach product used. An interviewer recorded the exact product\nname from the medication container label. If the container was\nunavailable, the participant verbally reported this information.\nAntihypertensive agents reported by participants in NHANES\ntherapeutic classes: (i) diuretics, (ii) -blockers, (iii) calcium\nchannel blockers, (iv) angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibi-\ntors, (v) angiotensin receptor blockers, and (vi) other antihy-\npertensive agents (including 1\n-blockers, central 2\n-agonists,\ndirect vasodilators, and other centrally acting drugs). A person\nwho reported using more than one antihypertensive medica-\ntion, either as a single-combination pill or as multiple drugs,\nwas only counted once for the any antihypertensive medica-\ntion use category, and once within each drug class category.\nEach antihypertensive medication that was reported was, how-\never, used to compute the total number of antihypertensive\nmedications used within the past month.\nA history of physician-diagnosed diabetes, stroke, conges-\ntive heart failure, angina pectoris, heart attack, or coronary\nheart disease was also assessed by questionnaire. Serum crea-\ntinine19 as well as urine albumin and creatinine20 were mea-\nsured according to standard methods. Serum creatinine values\nthe recommended standards.19 Glomerular filtration rate was\nestimated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease\nequation.21 Chronic kidney disease was defined as either an\nestimated glomerular filtration rate <60ml/min per 1.73m2 or\n>200mg albumin per gram urinary creatinine.2\nBP was measured with the participant in the sitting position\nafter 5min of rest by trained physicians at the mobile exami-\nnation center following a standard protocol. Appropriate cuff\nsizes were used for participants based on measurement of\nmid-arm circumference. The average of up to three measure-\nments was used. Hypertension was defined as a mean systolic\ntaking antihypertensive medication, or being told at least\ntwice by a physician or other health professional that one has\nhigh BP.1,10 Hypertensive subjects who reported taking any\nantihypertensive agent identified from the NHANES prescrip-\ntion medication data were considered as treated hyperten-\nof the interview and health examination was 75%.18 Of those,\n5,510 adults aged 18 years were identified as hypertensives,\n100 subjects were excluded due to lack of prescription medi-\ncation data (n = 54) or pregnancy (n = 46). The final analytic\nStatistical analyses were conducted using SAS (SAS Institute,\nCary, NC) and SUDAAN (RTI, Research Triangle Park, NC).22\nSample weights were used to account for differential prob-\nabilities of selection and the complex sample design and to\nobtain estimates representative of the noninstitutionalized US\npopulation aged 18 years.18 Variance estimates were com-\nputed using the Taylor series linearization approximation\napproach.23 An estimate with a relative s.e. 30% was consid-\nered statistically unreliable and noted in the tables. Statistical\nhypotheses were tested with a t-statistic or a 2, as appropriate.\nTrend tests were used to evaluate changes in estimates across\nage groups. We also conducted logistic regression analysis to\nestimate prevalence of antihypertensive drug use and BP con-\ntrol rates according to gender, adjusted for age, race/ethnicity,\nand comorbidities using predictive marginal probabilities.24\nResults\nDemographic and clinical characteristics of the hyperten-\nsive population by gender are summarized in Table 1. The\naverage age of women was >5.4 years than men. Compared\nto hypertensive men, hypertensive women were more\nlikely to be non-Hispanic black, to have a higher systolic BP\ngreater prevalences of obesity, chronic kidney disease or\nstroke. Men, however, were more likely to be smokers and to\nhave ischemic heart disease including angina pectoris, coro-\nnary heart disease, and/or heart attack.\nThe unadjusted and multivariable adjusted proportions of\nhypertensivemenandwomenreceivingantihypertensivedrugs\nare shown in Table 2.

However, women with a\nprior history of stroke were less likely to receive drug therapy\ncompared with their male counterparts.\nAmong treated hypertensive persons, ~30% used two anti-\nhypertensive drugs, and <20% used three or more antihyper-\ntensive drugs (Table 2). Treated men and women had similar\nproportions for the use of two antihypertensive drugs across\nall age and race/ethnicity subgroups. However, women with\nkidney disease or ischemic heart disease were more likely than\ntheir male counterparts to receive 2 antihypertensive drugs.\nThe proportion of use of three or more antihypertensive drugs\nwas significantly lower among old women than old men.\nTable 3 compares the distribution of antihypertensive drug\nclasses prescribed to hypertensive persons and to those with\nhypertensive complications. Both unadjusted and multi-\nvariable adjusted estimates indicated that nearly one-third\nof hypertensive women reported using diuretics in contrast\nto less than one-fourth of hypertensive men. Diuretic use\nwas significantly higher among women than men for those\nwith diabetes and kidney disease. Women were also more\nlikely than men to use angiotensin receptor blockers, espe-\ncially among those with diabetes. In contrast, angiotensin-\n\nconverting enzyme inhibitor use was significantly lower\namong women than men for those with kidney disease. There\nwere no gender differences in the use of -blockers or calcium\nchannel blockers.\nForty-five percent of treated women achieved BP control,\nwhereas 51% of treated men achieved BP control (Table 4).\nAmong both genders, the proportions of BP control rates\ndecreased with age (P < 0.01) and non-Hispanic whites were\nmore likely to have their BP controlled compared to non-\nHispanic blacks and Mexican Americans (P < 0.05). Gender\ndifferences in BP control rates were observed among older\nage groups. Multivariable adjusted analyses indicated that BP\ncontrol rate was significantly lower among women than men,\nspecifically for older persons, non-Hispanic whites, and those\nwith coexisting medical conditions such as kidney disease,\nstroke, or ischemic heart disease. Poor systolic BP control was\nthe major contribution to lower BP control rates observed in\ntreated women.\nAdditional multivariable adjusted regression analyses were\nconducted to examine whether BP control rates differed among\nmen and women treated with the same antihypertensive drug\nclass. Among diuretic users, women were less likely than\nAmong -blocker users, women were also less likely than men\nwere no gender differences in BP control rates among calcium\nchannel blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, or\nangiotensin receptor blockers users.\nDiscussion\nThe findings of this study demonstrate that significant gender\ndisparities continue to exist in hypertension treatment and\ncontrol among the US hypertensive population. Consistent\nwith previous reports,7 women were more likely than men to\nuse antihypertensive medications, but treated women were\nsignificantly less likely than men to achieve the recommended\ngoals of therapy even after adjusting for differences in age,\nrace/ethnicity, and comorbidities.

However, gender differences\nin the control of hypertension were most evident among\nolder age groups, non-Hispanic whites, and those with a his-\ntory of cardiovascular disease. Lower control rates among the\nelderly may partially contribute to the \nunfavorable outcomes\nseen in women. Although the Framingham Heart Study orig-\ninally observed a consistently greater number of coronary\nheart disease events caused by hypertension in men com-\npared with women at any age, other studies have estimated\nthe attributable risk percent to be as great or greater in wom-\nen.25 As more women than men have hypertension, optimal\nBP control, particularly systolic BP control, may well result\nTable 3 | Antihypertensive medication use among hypertensive adults by drug classes and comorbidities,NHANES 1999\u00ad2004\nCrude Multivariable adjusteda\nMen, % (s.e.)

Women appeared to be less aggressively treated,\nas evidenced by the lower use of three or more antihyper-\ntensive drugs, although their overall use of antihypertensive\nmedication was higher compared to men. Owing to the cross-\n\nsectional design of NHANES, we could not confirm whether\nthe less aggressive therapy was associated with poorer BP con-\ntrol among currently treated women. However, large clinical\ntrials have demonstrated that most patients with hypertension\ncan achieve and sustain adequate BP control only with the use\nof multiple antihypertensive drugs.26,27\nUtilization patterns for certain antihypertensive drug classes\nwere also clearly different by gender. Women were more\nlikely to use a diuretic compared to men. Seemingly, greater\nuse of diuretics among women did not confer more benefit\nin terms of BP control. Instead, when examining individual\ndrug classes, BP control rates were significantly lower among\nwomen than men treated with a diuretic or a -blocker even\nafter adjustment was made for differences in age, race/ethnic-\nity, and coexisting medical conditions. This, however, contrasts\nwith the results of long-term clinical trials of antihyperten-\nsive treatment, which have not demonstrated clinically sig-\nnificant gender differences in BP responses and outcomes.15,16\nFu and Levine28 suggested that angiotensin-converting enzyme\ninhibitors plus dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers may\nbe a particularly effective combination in elderly women with\nsystolic hypertension based on Lipsitz's study.29 Gender differ-\nences in response to pharmacologic treatment of hypertension\nmay be incompletely understood. Further research appears\nwarranted to compare men and women of similar ages and\nmedical conditions directly to determine the precise levels of\nreduction of cardiovascular outcomes with hypertension treat-\nment and control.\nHypertension, although typically asymptomatic, is a\nmajor risk factor for stroke, heart failure, and coronary heart\n\ndisease. Hypertension is also commonly associated with dia-\nbetes and renal insufficiency. New clinical trials continue to\ndemonstrate different clinical outcomes of therapies tailored\nto specific coexisting medical conditions. National guidelines\nhave incorporated these findings and recommended preferred\ndrug classes for treating hypertensive patients with different\ndiseases, specifically with diabetes, chronic kidney disease,\ncongestive heart failure, stroke, and ischemic heart disease.2\nOur study found that antihypertensive prescription patterns\nwere generally compliant with current recommendations for\nboth men and women with diabetes, heart failure, or ischemic\nheart disease.\nBP control rates were poor among the US hypertensive\npopulation, especially among older women and those with\ncoexisting medical conditions. The Department of Health\nand Human Services has established a national goal to con-\ntrol high BP in at least 70% of treated hypertensive patients by\nthe year 2010.30 Clinical trials, including the Antihypertensive\nRace/ethnicityc\nComorbidities\nCHF, congestive heart failure; CKD, chronic kidney disease; DBP, diastolic blood pressure; IHD, ischemic heart disease; MA, Mexican Americans; NH, non-Hispanic; SBP, systolic blood\npressure.\naAdjusted for age, race/ethnicity, and specified comorbidities. bSBP <130mmHg and DBP <80mmHg for those with diabetes or chronic kidney disease or SBP <140mmHg and\nDBP <90mmHg for all rest of hypertensive persons. cData shown only for major race\u00adethnic groups in NHANES sample design, other race\u00adethnic groups not shown, but included in\ntotal estimate. dSBP <130mmHg for those with diabetes or chronic kidney disease or SBP <140mmHg for all rest of hypertensive persons. eDBP <80 mm Hg for those with diabetes or\nchronic kidney disease or DBP <90mmHg for all rest of hypertensive persons.\nTable 4 | Continued\nCrude Multivariable adjusteda\nMen, % (s.e.)

BP was measured by a\nphysician using a standardized approach. Prescription medica-\ntion data were collected by trained interviewers, with the use of\nan in-person, household interview protocol. Drug names were\nrecorded and verified by inspection of medication containers.\nThe observed gender differences in the prevalence of hyper-\ntension treatment and control in our study were based on an\nenhanced data collection protocol, incorporating BP question-\nnaire data, and prescription medication data. This allowed us\nto identify all antihypertensive agents currently used by hyper-\ntensive persons. Using the specific drug class data also allowed\nus to examine drug utilization patterns and outcomes more\ncompletely in terms of BP control as well as to illustrate how\nthe national guidelines for antihypertensive therapy are cur-\nrently being applied to the US hypertensive population.\nHowever, several potential limitations of our study should\nbe noted when interpreting our findings. First, while the aus-\ncultatory method of BP measurement in NHANES is fully\nconsistent with national standards, NHANES measurements\nare performed only at a single time point, rather than on two\nseparate occasions. It is therefore possible that some subjects\nwere misclassified with regard to their BP control status. This\npotential problem was minimized to some extent by taking\nthe average of three separate measurements obtained under\nthe same standardized conditions. Second, NHANES is a\ncross-\nsectional study, and participants were asked to recall\nmedications used in the past month to minimize recall bias.\nThus, hypertensive subjects who used an antihypertensive\ndrug at any time before the 1-month recall period are classi-\nfied as nonusers. The prevalence estimates could be affected\nby the particular choice of a study recall period. In addition,\ndrug dosage and strength information are not collected in\nNHANES. This limited our ability to address differences in\ndrug therapy responses across demographic subgroups and\nclinical conditions. Third, \nantihypertensive medications may\nbe used for other indications. In our data, 91% of antihyper-\ntensive users provided an affirmative answer to the question\n\"current taking prescribed medicine for hypertension\". The\nremaining 9% of antihypertensive users may have used the\ndrug for another indication.\nThe treatment of hypertension and the assurance of BP\ncontrol have been challenging and remain to some extent\n\nunsatisfactory. Potential benefits of antihypertensive therapy\ndepend on both the efficacy of treatment and the underly-\ning risks for cardiovascular disease in the individual subject.\nAlthough it is well demonstrated that age, race/ethnicity, and\ncoexisting medical conditions are important \nconsiderations\nin BP control, gender is also a significant factor that needs to\nbe considered. The gender disparities in hypertension treat-\nment and control as evidenced by the current US national\ndata will likely stimulate further prospective studies on\nwhether the response to antihypertensive treatment is the\nsame or different between the sexes. Ultimately, it is possible\nthat men and women may require different antihypertensive\nregimens due to differences in the progression and presenta-\ntion of hypertension. Efforts are still needed to achieve thera-\npeutic goals for the US hypertensive population, especially\nfor \nhypertensive women.\nDisclosure:The findings and conclusions in this report are those of the\nauthors and do not necessarily represent the views of the US Department\nof Health and Human Services and the Center for Disease Control and\nPrevention.\n1.
