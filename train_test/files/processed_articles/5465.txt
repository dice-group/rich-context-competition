Many\nbelieve that QOL should be a major component\nof clinical studies and treatment trials in func-\ntional gastrointestinal disorders.3,20,21 The aim of\nthis study was to evaluate the effect of repeat\ntreatment with rifaximin on IBS-related QOL in\npatients with IBS-D.\nMethods\nStudy design and patient population\nThis was a secondary analysis of a randomized,\ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter,\nphase III trial [ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:\nstudy design have been previously described.16\nBriefly, individuals 18 years of age with a\ndiagnosis of IBS (based on Rome III criteria)\nwith average symptom severity scores of 3 for\nIBS-related abdominal pain (range, 0 = no pain\nto 10 = worst possible pain you can imagine)\nand bloating (range, 0 = not at all to 6 = a very\ngreat deal) during the screening phase, and with\nstools for 2 days per week meeting Bristol\nStool Scale (BSS) criteria for type 6 or type 7\nconsistency, were eligible for inclusion in the\nstudy.\nDuring the screening phase (10 \u00b1 3 days), all\npatients received single-blind placebo three\ntimes a day and reported daily IBS-related\nsymptoms (Figure 1). In the open-label treat-\nment phase, patients received rifaximin 550 mg\nthree times a day for 2 weeks, followed by a\n4-week treatment-free follow-up period during\nwhich response [defined as meeting weekly\nresponse criteria for both abdominal pain\n(30% improvement from baseline in mean\nweekly pain score) and stool consistency (50%\ndecrease from baseline in number of days/week\nwith BSS type 6 or 7 stools) during 2 of the 4\nweeks] was evaluated. Nonresponders to open-\nlabel rifaximin were withdrawn from the study.\nResponders were subsequently followed, treat-\nment-free, for up to 18 additional weeks (obser-\nvation phase), or until relapse. Relapse after\nresponse to open-label rifaximin was defined as\n<30% improvement from baseline in mean\nweekly abdominal pain score or <50% reduc-\ntion from baseline in number of days/week with\nBD Cash, M Pimentel et al.\njournals.sagepub.com/home/tag 691\nBSS type 6 or 7 stools for 3 weeks of a con-\nsecutive, rolling 4-week period during the treat-\nment-free observation phase. Patients who\nrelapsed were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive\ntwo 2-week repeat courses of rifaximin 550 mg\nthree times a day or placebo, with repeat courses\nseparated by 10 weeks (double-blind treatment\nphases). All patients provided written informed\nconsent and the protocol was approved by all\ninstitutional review boards and ethics commit-\ntees at all centers. All authors had full access to\nstudy data and reviewed and approved the final\nmanuscript.\nQuality-of-life assessments\nBaseline data for the open-label and double-\nblind phases of the study were based on 7 days of\npatient diary data collected immediately preced-\ning open-label and double-blind rifaximin repeat\ntreatment, respectively. QOL was assessed using\na validated 34-item IBS-QOL questionnaire,22\nwith each item scored on a 5-point Likert\nresponse scale (1 = `not at all,' 2 = `slightly,' 3 =\n`moderately,' 4 = `quite a bit,' or 5 = `extremely'\nor `a great deal'). Data were converted to a\nsummed score (range, 0\u00ad100) using the follow-\ning formula: score = 100 \u00d7 [(number of items \u00d7\n5 - sum of all the items) / (5 \u00d7 number of items\n- number of items)]. A higher score on the 0\u00ad100\nscale indicated better QOL. IBS-QOL overall\nand eight subdomain scores (i.e. dysphoria,\ninterference with activity, body image, health\nworry, food avoidance, social reaction, sexual\nfunction, and social relationships) were calcu-\nlated. During the open-label treatment phase,\nthe IBS-QOL questionnaire was administered in\nthe clinic at open-label rifaximin baseline, by\nphone at end of the 4-week follow-up, and then\nby phone every 4 weeks for patients who contin-\nued to respond during the 18-week observation\nphase. During the double-blind treatment\nphases, the IBS-QOL questionnaire was admin-\nistered in the clinic at double-blind baseline (ran-\ndomization), by phone at the end of the 4-week\nfollow-up (primary evaluation period), by phone\nat 4-week intervals of the repeat treatment obser-\nvation phase, and in the clinic at the start of sec-\nond repeat treatment and the end of the study.\nScores were not calculated for patients with miss-\ning data for any item at a given assessment. An\nimprovement in IBS-QOL overall score of 14\npoints from baseline to a time point of interest\nwas considered the minimally clinically impor-\ntant difference (MCID; i.e. the smallest differ-\nence perceived by patients to be beneficial).21\nFigure 1.

For patients who received\nopen-label rifaximin and both double-blind treat-\nment courses, the improvement from double-\nblind baseline to the end of first double-blind\ntreatment follow-up in IBS-QOL overall and\nmost subdomain scores (excepting IBS-QOL\nhealth worry and sexual function subdomain\nscores) was greater compared with patients who\nreceived open-label rifaximin and two courses of\nplacebo treatment (Figure 5). However, in\npatients who received two repeat treatments, dif-\nferences between treatment groups (i.e. rifaximin\nversus placebo) were not statistically significant\nwhen comparing mean improvement in IBS-\nQOL overall score from open-label baseline with\nthe 4-week follow-up after open-label rifaximin\n(i.e. treatment #1) or the first double-blind treat-\nment (i.e. treatment #2) (see Figure S2, pub-\nlished online). A statistical analysis could not be\nconducted because there was an insufficient\nnumber of patients receiving both double-blind\ntreatments who had IBS-QOL data at the end of\nstudy; consequently, no comparison of change in\noverall score from open-label baseline to end of\nstudy was conducted. Mean improvement values\nfor IBS-QOL overall score from open-label base-\nline to 4 weeks after the first double-blind retreat-\nment with rifaximin or placebo were comparable\nwith those of the improvement from open-label\nbaseline to the second double-blind retreatment\nbaseline (see Figure S2, published online).\nPatients who completed the study had improve-\nment from open-label baseline in IBS-QOL over-\nall scores for the duration of the study (i.e. all\nassessments) with both rifaximin and placebo\n(see Figure S3, published online).\nDiscussion\nThe findings of this study indicate that repeat\ntreatment with rifaximin favorably impacts IBS-\nQOL overall and all eight subdomain scores in\npatients with IBS-D. Moreover, IBS-QOL overall\nand all subdomain scores were improved from\nbaseline for up to 4 weeks posttreatment in\npatients receiving 2-week open-label rifaximin\nFigure 4.

All of these\nsubdomain scores significantly improved in\nresponders treated with rifaximin compared with\nnonresponders. It is valuable to note that the IBS-\nQOL is a derivative measure that reflects the per-\nceptions of patients with IBS, including the\namount of control they have over their symptoms,\nif they can socialize, and their sexual relation-\nships, which can have lasting effects even if there\nis some degree of symptom change. It was not\ndesigned as a surrogate measure of symptoms or\nfunction.\nImprovements from open-label baseline in IBS-\nQOL overall and subdomain scores for food\navoidance, interference with activity, and body\nimage were significantly greater in patients who\nresponded to open-label rifaximin who did not\nrelapse during the treatment-free observation\nphase, as compared with those who responded\nand subsequently relapsed during the observation\nphase. This finding suggests that greater improve-\nment in QOL following treatment with rifaximin\nis associated with a lower chance of subsequent\nsymptom relapse. Indeed, responders to open-\nlabel treatment with rifaximin had significantly\ngreater improvement from baseline in the IBS-\nQOL overall score based on an MCID 14 points\ncompared with nonresponders at 4 weeks post-\ntreatment. The subgroup of nonresponders who\nachieved the MCID in IBS-QOL may not have\nmet the formal prespecified criteria for response,\nbut it is possible that they may have experienced\nenough improvement in their clinical symptoms\nwith rifaximin treatment that they deemed their\nQOL improved. While a direct association\nbetween MCID and the symptomatic response to\nrifaximin is not entirely expected, clinically mean-\ningful improvement in IBS-QOL appears to be\nconsistent with improvements in abdominal pain\nand stool consistency previously reported for\nthese patients.16 These data demonstrate that a\nsingle course of short-term treatment with\nFigure 5.

These favorable findings\nregarding QOL appear to align with the significant\nimprovement in efficacy outcomes observed with\nrifaximin compared with placebo during the first\ndouble-blind retreatment phase of the study, sug-\ngesting that improvement in IBS-QOL may, in\npart, be driven by relief of IBS symptoms follow-\ning repeat treatment with rifaximin versus pla-\ncebo.16 Interestingly, when patients had recurrent\nIBS symptoms after responding to open-label\nrifaximin, the baseline QOL immediately preced-\ning double-blind, repeat treatment was improved\ncompared with that reported at open-label base-\nline. This is consistent with data previously\nreported for this trial for IBS symptom scores (e.g.\n20% improvement in abdominal pain at double-\nblind baseline relative to symptom severity prior\nto open-label rifaximin), which were also lower\n(improved) compared with open-label baseline\ndata.16 The improvement in QOL at baseline of\nthe double-blind, repeat treatment phase reduces\nthe statistical power to detect measurable improve-\nment related to a potential carryover effect.26\nThe improvement from both open-label and dou-\nble-blind baseline to the end of study observed in\nIBS-QOL overall scores between rifaximin and\nplacebo with short-term exposure (i.e. 2 weeks)\nwas comparable with data reported for patients\nwith IBS-D receiving the mixed \u00b5-opioid receptor\nagonist/-opioid receptor antagonist eluxadoline\ntherapy.27 However, it is unclear whether\nimprovements in IBS-QOL overall scores are\ndurable for eluxadoline following treatment dis-\ncontinuation. The selective type 3 serotonin\nreceptor antagonist alosetron 1 mg administered\ntwice daily improved IBS-specific QOL subdo-\nmain scores for emotional, mental health, sleep,\nenergy, food/diet, social function, and physical\nrole from baseline after 12 weeks in women with\nsevere IBS-D.28 Alosetron 1 mg twice daily also\nimproved IBS-specific QOL subscale scores for\nphysical role, food/diet, and social function and\nmet or exceeded the MCID in two randomized,\nplacebo-controlled studies of women with IBS-D\nor IBS-M after 12 weeks of therapy.29 Similar to\neluxadoline, alosetron must be administered\ndaily, long-term, so durability of QOL improve-\nment following treatment discontinuation is\nunclear. In addition, direct comparisons of alose-\ntron with rifaximin are limited because of a differ-\nent disease-specific QOL instrument used in\nA limitation of the current study is that patients\nwho responded to open-label rifaximin, but who\ndid not relapse during the 18-week, treatment-\nfree observation phase, discontinued from the\nstudy per protocol. Therefore, further assessment\nof this nonrelapsing patient population was not\nconducted to evaluate the duration of improve-\nment in IBS-QOL scores beyond a total of 18\nweeks after response was assessed. Another limi-\ntation of the current study is that when data were\nmissing for an item within the subdomains of the\nIBS-QOL instrument, scores were not calculated\nat a given time point, limiting the data available\nfor some assessments during the study. Data from\nsome assessments included a small number of\npatients (e.g. patients who only received one\nrepeat treatment course). In addition, some com-\nponents of the IBS-QOL instrument, although a\nvalid instrument for IBS-D, have been reported\nnot to be optimal for patients with IBS-D,30 and\nthus using this instrument may not have fully\nassessed the condition of IBS-D and potential\nimpact of treatments. This study was not suffi-\nciently powered to examine specific demographic\nand baseline disease characteristics previously\nshown to be associated with QOL in patients with\nIBS-D (e.g. sex), and these analyses were not\nconducted.24 Finally, this study did not compare\nimprovement in QOL with patient daily activities,\nwhich are often impaired by IBS.6\nIn conclusion, patients with IBS-D receiving\nshort-term (2-week) repeat treatment with rifaxi-\nmin experienced clinically meaningful improve-\nments in QOL. Furthermore, repeat treatment\nwith rifaximin provided incremental overall and\nsubdomain QOL improvement in addition to the\nenduring improvement observed following initial\nTherapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology 10(9)\n698 journals.sagepub.com/home/tag\ntreatment with open-label rifaximin. The\nimprovements in QOL reported in the current\nstudy further support the clinical usefulness of a\nday as treatment and repeat treatment for the\nmanagement of IBS-D.\n"
