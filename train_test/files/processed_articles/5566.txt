As Couchsurfing was initiated, it was just an alternative accommodation for budget\ntravelers. However, now Couchsurfing has been recognized as a stylish way of travel, which\nbrings new forms of tourist experiences and scenarios. In the light of the transformation of\nCouchsurfing, this study tries to explore how social-media technologies, hosts, surfers, and\nspaces are mobilized to perform Couchsurfing. Goffman's performance theory as well as the\nextended concepts about online performance and tourist performance is adopted to analyze the\nCouchsurfing practice. By studying on couchsurfers' online performance, offline performance, as\nwell as certain \"inappropriate actions\" hidden in the backstage, this study displays the series of\nmechanism, which pushes Couchsurfing from simply a hospitality exchange network to a specific\ntravel style.\n",

It\nseems Couchsurfing has brought in certain scenarios, which are quite different from\nthose in a general tourist journey.\nCouchsurfing is a website to facilitate hospitality exchange among global travelers.\nAfter registering as members, one can ask for free accommodation from local members\nthrough the website and stay over at their homes during the trip, instead of booking a\nhotel or hostel. Since the website was launched in 2004, the number of its members has\nrapidly grown. After a decade, it has attracted over 10million members around the globe\n(Couchsurfing Statistics, 2017). As Couchsurfing develops, the use of the term\n\"Couchsurfing,\" has expanded to mean a specific way of travel, which refers to staying\nover at the local's home1 and often implies visiting a place through local eyes (Chen,\nOwing to its gradual popularity among global travelers, Couchsurfing has been\nnoticed by some social scientists and has been studied in various facets. Regarding\nCouchsurfing as Internet-based hospitality-exchange network, part of the studies focuses\non how Couchsurfing works with the aid of social-networking tools. According to\nO'Regan (2013), the original model of Couchsurfing was quite simple: \"if you need a\nplace to stay, Couchsurfing enables you to identity and find someone to give over sleep-\ning space in their home for free\" (p. 179). More precisely, the functions of personal\nprofile, couch-request (message-sending) and reputation system on the site facilitate the\nmutual understanding and communication between potential hosts and surfers and thus\nhelps online-trust building, which is the key factor of organizing the Internet-based hos-\nBesides, on the site, Couchsurfing is represented as a way to learn from other cultures\nand to achieve the cosmopolitan utopia. Thus, the cosmopolitan atmosphere becomes\nextraobtainmentinhospitalityexchangetobalancethereciprocalrelationofCouchsurfing\nSimultaneously, Couchsurfing practice is considered as part of phenomena of the\nmobile world, in which technologies support various forms of travel that generate new\nmodes of interaction and relationship (Urry, 2007). Thus, these moving people, informa-\ntion, objects, and so on shift people's worldview (Szerszynski and Urry, 2002). Bialski\n(2012, 2013) takes Couchsurfing as the case to demonstrate how social-networking tech-\nnologies are affecting the process of sociality today. Couchsurfing, according to Bialski,\nenables travelers to manage the encounters during the trip in advance, and also it helps\ninvolve locals in travelers' trips and create cross-cultural interaction between them. The\nface-to-face interaction generates a new form of relationship, which is usually intense,\nintimate yet lacking sort of any longevity (Bialski, 2012). Moreover, in many cases, the\ncross-cultural interaction induces the reflection on self and other (Zeuv, 2013), based on\nwhich couchsurfers are developing their perspectives on cosmopolitanism (Buchberger,\njust about the furniture\" (p. 215), but involving the hospitality exchange network, recip-\nrocal relationship, cross-cultural interaction, and the cosmopolitan ideologies. All these\nfactors constitute a particular landscape of Couchsurfing (Germann Molz, 2007;\nO'Regan, 2009) with its own norms, applied technologies, institutional arrangements,\nand methodologies, which make Couchsurfing a specific travel style (Adler, 1989: 1371).\nPrevious studies have made some achievements in exploring Couchsurfing; how-\never, there is still a gap between the site management of Couchsurfing and couchsurf-\ners' actual practice. Originally, Couchsurfing was organized for hospitality exchange,\nbut now it is practiced as a stylish way of travel. A process of forming the social con-\nventions in this online-to-offline community is missing. Therefore, a research question\nis raised here: what mechanisms have pushed Couchsurfing from just an alternative\naccommodation to a travel style with its own norms, value and specific ways of prac-\ntice, and, how does it work?\nTo demonstrate the process of tone-setting in Couchsurfing community with the con-\nsideration of institutional power and couchsurfers'agencies, this study traces how couch-\nsurfers use the online tool to manage the encounter and how they actually behave in\nface-to-face interaction, based on which this study further clarifies the mechanisms that\nlead couchsurfers' practice. The framework of theatrical performance by Goffman's\n(1959) (which is elaborated in the next section) is used to analyze couchsurfers' self-\nrepresentation, action and reaction in online and face-to-face interaction of Couchsurfing.\nEthnographic methods are used in this study, including participatory observation, text\nanalysis and qualitative interviews. I signed up to Couchsurfing and completed the per-\nsonal profile in 2010. Since then I did the fieldwork mainly in Taiwan and the Netherlands.\nIn the Netherlands, I opened my home in Amsterdam to host couchsurfers and started\nonline and face-to-face interaction with other couchsurfers (2011\u00ad2014). I also traveled in\nthe Netherlands with Couchsurfing several times, met couchsurfers for coffee, and\nattended couchsurfers' meetings. In Taiwan, I traveled with to Couchsurfing in 2011 and\nparticipated in several couchsurfers'meetings. Besides, I had online interaction with other\ncouchsurfers. All the online and face-to-face interactions are included in the participatory\nobservation. For the text analysis, I reviewed the webpages of Couchsurfing site, as well\nas the personal profile of the individual members whom I met during the fieldwork in\nTaiwan and the Netherlands. The interactions between me and other members recorded\nonline are also included. As for the qualitative interviews, there are 53 respondents, who\nare (1) hosting surfers in the Netherlands, (2) couchsurfing with locals in the Netherlands,\n(3) hosting surfers in Taiwan, or (4) couchsurfing with locals in Taiwan. The age of these\nthese respondents on various occasions of Couchsurfing: 8 of them were my hosts, 8 of\nthem were my surfers, 10 respondents were from the Couchsurfing meetings, and 14\nrespondents participated in an interview after chatting online with me. The remaining\nrespondents (13) were selected by snowball-sampling and were introduced by other\nrespondents. The interviews mainly took place at my home (when the interviewee was my\nsurfer), the hosts'home (when the interviewee was my host during my Couchsurfing trip),\nand the caf\u00e9s. The length of the interviews ranges from 1 to 4 hours, depends on how\nmany Couchsurfing experiences he/she has and how much he/she would like to share. All\nthe respondents are pseudonymous to keep anonymity in this study.\nPerformative analytical framework on Couchsurfing\nIn Erving Goffman's (1959) classic work, The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life, he\nuses the frame of a theatrical performance to analyze individuals' interactions in every-\nday life. Through the imaginative lenses of dramaturgical metaphor, people are all play-\ning various roles to give/give-off performance corresponding to different occasions and\ncontexts in the daily life. By changing, fixing, or complying with the settings, including\nthe potential rules about the appearance, manner, and spatial arrangement, we convey\ndifferent information, which may show one's identity, confirm or negotiate a relation-\nship, or define the situation. Invisible conventions, etiquettes, rituals, and informal rules\nare gradually recognized and formed in the performances (Jacobsen, 2010).\nGoffman distills individuals' behaviors, interactions, and spatial settings into the\ndichotomy of the front stage and the backstage. Formal performance and direct contact\nwith audience take place in the front stage, where the rules of decorum are highly con-\ncerned, while the backstage is for preparation, catharsis, and relaxation, in which public\nmasks are lifted and other aspects of self can be shown. Although Goffman's performa-\ntive conception has been proposed more than half century ago, it has continuously shown\nits worth and adequacy in demonstrating the newly widespread phenomena in the social\nlife of contemporary societies, such as interaction in online communities and tourist\nconsumption and practice.\nOnline performance\nInformation-communication technologies have brought new forms of relationship and\ninteraction in people's social life. Goffman's dramaturgical approach is regarded as a\nuseful analytical framework to study people's online participation and the virtual world\n2007). The metaphor of the front stage/backstage, for instance, is drawn upon to reveal\nthe anonymous attribute and its consequence in certain online environments, like role-\nplaying games and pseudonymous online communities. In the anonymous environ-\nment, one is able to express the real desire or certain aspect of self which is repressed\nin the offline environment (Ross, 2007). In other cases of social media, users are able\nto control other users' access to their posts to manage their privacy. The virtual space\nof the sites, in a sense, is considered private and therefore, is backstage-like (Boyd,\n2006; Lewis et al., 2008). The attributes of anonymity, pseudonymity, and privacy\nseem to make the online environment an autonomous region which allows fluid and\nAs social media have grown in popularity, more evidence shows that the online envi-\nronment and offline environment are not a simplified dichotomy of frontstage/backstage\nbut a continuity (Bullingham and Vasconcelos, 2013). On social media, which either\nsupport the maintenance of pre-existing social networks or facilitate new connections\nbased on shared interests, political views or activities, most people tend to use an identi-\nfied name in the online profile for the networking purpose (Boyd and Ellison, 2007;\nDiMicco and Millen, 2007). Thus, offline interaction can be continued in online environ-\nment, and vice versa. These sites like Facebook, Twitter, Friendster, LinkedIn, MySpace\net cetera, offer users another stage of self-representation, which, in Goffman's words,\nconstitutes an online performance for impression management (Bullingham and\nIn the previous case studies, the online environment can be either the backstage or the\nextended stage of the offline performance; it is related to how users perceive the charac-\nter of the sites and how they use them as tools to manage their social life. Thus, the con-\nnection between the online performance and offline performance is significant to explore\nsocial life in the Internet age. That is, the online performance and offline performance\nshould not be studied separately but taken as whole.\nBased on the character of social-networking tools, Hogan (2010) adjusts Goffman's\nperformative analytical framework and categorizes various forms of self-representation\non social media into two types: online exhibition and online interaction. Online exhibi-\ntion, which is a static display to unidentified audience, not only presents in the forms of\ntextual expression but also incorporates multiple forms of media to convey information,\nsuch as photos, videos or audios, whereas online interaction, which is a series of instant\nresponses in certain situations, normally presents in texts and icons. The various forms\nof digital communication supported by social-media technologies constitute a communi-\ncative body in the online performance (Boyd and Heer, 2006). In this study, Hogan's\nframework is adopted to analyze couchsurfers' online performance. Simultaneously,\nconsidering the integrity of sociality in Couchsurfing, how online interaction and online\nexhibition connect to the tourist performance in face-to-face interaction among couch-\nsurfers are addressed as well.\nTourist performance\nGoffman's performative metaphor is extended to study tourism phenomenon and has\nraised the debate on tourist practices, tourist identity, and tourist space. MacCannell\n(1973) is the first researcher to introduce the performative metaphor in tourism studies.\nGoffman's concept of the front stage/backstage is cited and extended to support\nMacCannell's idea of \"stage authenticity\" to illustrate the essence of tourism. MacCannell\nargues that tourism is the side-product of modern society, in which people mourn for the\npast of intimate relations and authentic experience; tourism industry offers a service for\nthose seeking utopia and fulfills the desire for \"what modernity destroys and keeps out\"\n(Larsen, 2010: 315). To fit in tourists' imagination of authenticity, the tourism industry\ncooperates with the locals and designs a series of backstage-like settings and scenarios,\ntings and scenarios are produced in a sacralizing process of \"naming, framing, elevation,\nenshrinement and reproduction,\" and socially ordered to correspond to the tourist gaze\nAfter MacCannell, the concept of tourist performance has been continually discussed,\nmodified and supplemented in following tourism studies. In these studies, the research\nfoci are extended from providers of tourist service to tourists, tourist objects and applied\ntechnologies in tourism performance. By doing so, the role of tourists, their practices,\nand the role of tourist spaces are reexamined and redefined. The extended discussions on\nperformative metaphor in tourism can be roughly summarized in three aspects.\nFirst, in the modified concept of tourist performance, tourists transcend the role of\npassive audience and engage in collective or individual performance as an active per-\nformer. Although tourists normally are informed by \"pre-existing discursive, practi-\ncal, embodied norms which help to guide their performative orientations and achieve\na working consensus about what to do\" before the tourist performance (Edensor,\nthe norms and conventions of tourist practice, tourists enact their role and inscribe the\nplaces with their own stories (Edensor, 1998; Haldrup and Larsen, 2010). The dis-\ncourse of tourist performance shows the situation of a traveling body, who is allowed\nto act, to give an impromptu response, or respond to the surroundings, but simultane-\nously is subject to the historical construction and stylistic constraint of the tourist role\nSecond, instead of privileging visual experience as in MacCannell's (1973) analysis\nof tourist performance (see also Selwyn, 1996; Urry, 2002), the discourse of tourist\nperformance highlights the multiple bodily sensations in tourist practices and material-\nizes the tourist practice with tourist settings which are used and lived with in it\nLarsen further clarify the materialization of the performative turn and signify the shift\nof paradigm in tourist studies: \"by shifting the focus from symbols and meanings to\nontologies of acting and doing, the corporeality of tourist bodies and their creative\npotentials, as well as the significance of technologies and the material affordance of\nplaces, are exposed\" (Haldrup and Larsen, 2010: 3). Succinctly saying, tourism repre-\nsents the embodied and performed engagement of people, objects and places, with the\nmutual entanglement of practices, images, conventions and creativity (Ateljevic and\nThird, rather than seeing places as fixed entities and containers, Coleman and Crang\nsuggest that places should be \"juxtaposed in analytical terms with dynamic flows of tour-\nists, images, and cultures,\" and all of them should be seen as fluid and created through\ntourist performance (Coleman and Crang, 2002: 1). Accordingly, place and its meaning\nare produced and consumed through the performance of spaces, tourists, and other rele-\nThe discussions above make the concept of tourist performance a useful model to\nstudy the dynamic landscape and complex network of contemporary tourism from indi-\nvidual perspective, and it responds to what Larsen and Urry (2011) call for, that \"tourism\ntheory needs to be on the move to capture the transformation of tourism\" (preface to 3.0).\nThis study adopts the model of tourist performance, associated with the analysis frame-\nwork of online performance, to explore the dynamics of Couchsurfing, which epitomizes\nthe transformation of tourist practice and tourist spaces as the social-media technologies\nand the sharing economy concept are applied in tourism at individual level. By focusing\non the online and face-to-face interactions of Couchsurfing and connecting both of them\nas whole, this study also takes Couchsurfing as the case of the online-to-offline model,\nwhich involves a more complex and sophisticated performance in contemporary social\nlife of this mobile world. In the following sections of analysis, through the theoretical\nlens of performance, Couchsurfing practice will be demonstrated in three parts: online\nperformance, offline performance, and the backstage.\nACT I: online performance in personal profile, reputation\nsystem, and couch-request\nCouchsurfing practice starts from a series of online performances. To sign up as a mem-\nber, one has to fill in the personal profile with the real name, actual location, personal\ninformation, photos, and self-description. After the procedure, members are able to send\na couch-request to ask for accommodation from other members. If the host accepts it, a\nCouchsurfing trip staying over with the locals can be expected. After the Couchsurfing\nencounter, members are requested to leave a reference to the host or surfer they met. The\npersonal profile, couch-request, and reputation system all involve couchsurfers' online\nexhibition and online interaction (Hogan, 2010).\nOnline exhibition- to set the tone of Couchsurfing\nPersonal profile can be the stage of individual members' online exhibition, which\nincludes the basic information like name, age, gender, education, occupation, spoken\nlanguages, and the autobiographical description through answering the assigned ques-\ntions, like \"my Couchsurfing experiences,\" \"(my favorite) music, movies and books,\"\n\"one amazing things I have done,\" \"(the things I am interested to) teach, learn and\nshare,\" \"the countries I've visited/lived in,\" and so on. It seems the personal profile ena-\nbles members to display his/her personality and character (see O'Regan, 2009), and to\nfind someone interesting among the diverse folks of the couchsurfing community\n(Bialski, 2011; Bialski and Batorski, 2010). Yet, rather than encouraging diversity, these\nquestions actually guide members to display certain characteristics. For instance, the\nquestions about Couchsurfing experiences and visited countries imply members perform\na travel savvy. Members are led to enact a social person enthusiastic about sharing as\nthey are requested to answer \"the things I would like to teach/learn/share.\" Also, mem-\nbers are displaying their cultural capital and taste through listing \"my favorite music/\nmovies/books.\" It has been shown that online users normally observe the rules of the\nsocial media, and then select certain aspects of self to perform online (Bullingham and\nVasconcelos, 2013); Couchsurfing members also do so. To be socially trusted and\naccepted in Couchsurfing community, most members tend to follow the hints to perform\nan open-minded, social, and cosmopolitan person online (Tan, 2013).\nIn the personal profile, some hosts also list their criteria of guest-selection, which\nimply their expectation as well as an appropriate performance of Couchsurfing from the\nhosts' perspective. For example, Abel, a German host in the Netherlands, clearly\ndescribed the characteristics of unwelcome and welcome guests in his profile:\nDON'T CONTACT ME if you[...] just need a cheap hotel, don't speak any of my languages\nfluently, just wanna stay for 10hours, just wanna drop off your bags and wanna go party with\nyour friends, are drunk half the time ...\nDO CONTACT ME if you're a true Couchsurfing aficionado, have understood this whole\nconcept is about cultural exchange and not a free ride, [...]wanna get to know my culture or my\ncity, need a guide to show you my town, wanna discuss politics/religion/philosophy/moral/arts/\nmusic or other intellectual concepts... have brought enough spare time for a beer and a\nprolonged discussion.\nIn this case, Abel expressed his expectation of an intellectual discussion or cultural\ninteraction with other surfers. Such online performance, according to Bialski (2011,\n2013) is part of the hosts'strategies to define the boundary between hosts and surfers and\nsimultaneously to set the social rules of the reciprocal relation before the face-to-face\nencounter. To get socially accepted by hosts, surfers naturally tend to perform the way\nhosts expect. As the owner of the private space who has the right to refuse the hospitality\nin Couchsurfing, hosts are more powerfully able to define the situation of Couchsurfing\ninteraction (Bialski, 2011). This unbalanced relation is hidden in the general saying\nabout the concept of Couchsurfing, \"it is about cultural exchange rather than a free\naccommodation,\" which is apparently a rule for surfers from hosts' perspective.\nReputation system, which is set for safety reasons (Tan, 2010), is another form of\nonline exhibition contributing to give the tone of Couchsurfing.After the encounter, surf-\ners may leave a positive, neutral or negative reference of the hosts, and vice versa.Abrief\ndescription of the face-to-face interaction is attached to the reference, like one of the\npositive references I got from my host, a 43-year-old Dutch women:\nThe reference for Doreen and Astor can't be anything but positive, because they let me win a\nboard game and claimed they liked dinner ... But without kidding, I really enjoyed having them\nover, the only bad thing was, that these tough \"biker girls\" only stayed for one night!\nSuch descriptions capture the scenario of Couchsurfing; they may show an example\nof a positive/neutral/negative experience of Couchsurfing encounter and a model of a\nwelcome/unwelcome surfer or a hospitable/inhospitable host, all of which imply appro-\npriate/inappropriate behaviors in Couchsurfing. These references are left on the personal\nprofile are like a participatory exhibition (Hogan, 2010). In the process of accumulating\nvarious Couchsurfing experiences in reputation system, the informal rules as well as the\ntone of Couchsurfing are gradually formed.\nOnline interaction- to define the reciprocal relationship\nCouch-request is the main channel for accommodation request. Mostly, it goes along\nwith the online interaction between potential hosts and surfers. A formal couch-request\nembraces a schedule form and a message including two parts: \"about me\" and \"why I\nwant to meet you.\" In the schedule form, surfers are strongly suggested to inform the\npotential hosts about the accurate date and time of arrival and departure as well as the\ntravel plan to reduce hosts' suspicion, since people are anxious that surfers might\ncouch-request guides surfers to perform as a reliable traveler with strict travel schedule\nfor trust building.\nIn the first paragraph \"about me,\" surfers are requested to introduce themselves. Tan\n(2013) indicates that surfers are trying to give a trustworthy impression to get acceptance\nin this part of online performance. Yet, according to the couch-requests I got, more surfers\nare performing \"cosmopolitan characteristics,\" like open-mindedness and friendliness.\nAmong the 142 couch-requests I got in 2012, the adjectives relevant with trustworthiness\nsuch as \"responsible and respectful\" appeared 8 times in their self-introduction, while\n\"tidy, clean, neat and organized\" appeared 15 times. On the other hand, the adjectives\nrelated to cosmopolitan characteristics like \"open-minded and easygoing,\" and \"friendly,\"\nappeared 39 and 15 times. In addition to the impression of a trustworthy and cosmopolitan\ntraveler, some surfers also display their characteristics which may be welcome to the\nhosts, such as \"interesting and funny,\" which appeared 18 times in the couch-request.\nThrough their self-descriptions, according to Goffman (1959; see also Hogan, 2010),\nthese couchsurfers actually are not presenting an authentic version of self but an \"ideal-\nized image\" of couchsurfer.\nThe other paragraph \"why I want to meet you\" whereby surfers make a personal\ncouch-request, also becomes a rule for many couchsurfers, such as Baldwin, a 30-year-\nold Taiwanese male host:\nI never accept a spammed couch-request. Come on, you don't have to spend a cent on your\naccommodation.At least spend some time on your host--read the profile, send a personal couch-\nrequest and show your interest in him. ... I only answer the couch-request with the password,\nwhich is hidden in my profile. Many hosts do so to filter out spammed couch-requests.\nBaldwin considered starting a personalized interaction as surfers' obligation, and his\nthought was clearly expressed to potential surfers as he required the password in the\ncouch-request. For Baldwin, Couchsurfing is not an indirect reciprocal system among\nthe whole community any longer, but a direct reciprocal relationship between surfers and\nhosts (Chen, 2011). Such a viewpoint becomes common among not only hosts but surf-\ners as well. Therefore, some surfers even promise to offer gift, food, or service in their\nand to set up a fair relationship of reciprocity.\nThe online performance not only shows an expected interaction and exemplifies the\nformal or informal rules in Couchsurfing, but also forms a mechanism to exclude those\nmembers who do not accept the rules, like Mandy, a 34-year-old host in the Netherlands:\nI started Couchsurfing by hosting surfers in 2005. I didn't think much then. I just felt good to\nshare my space, stuff, and food to those who need them. That was simple. I quitted (hosting\nsurfers) for a while because I moved to a small renting room. [...] After my husband and I\nopened our flat again in Amsterdam, I realized Couchsurfing have had changed. It was\nmentioned in every couch-request, \"I am talkative,\" \"I am a social person,\" or \"I hope to spend\nsome time with you.\" It seems that Couchsurfing requests both hosts and surfers to be social,\nand that is far from my idea about Couchsurfing. We felt pressure from it, so we decided to quit\nagain.\nIn terms of function, social-media technologies support an indirect reciprocal system of\nhospitality exchange. However, the analysis of couchsurfers'online performance has shown\na more complex mechanism supported by social-media technologies, which accommodate\na series of online performances to convey Couchsurfing conventions and to define the recip-\nrocal relationship between hosts and surfers before the face-to-face encounter. Also, the\nmechanism helps to select certain kinds of members with appropriate behaviors and similar\nthoughts and to filter out the others. Hence, the thought of \"Couchsurfing as simply an alter-\nnative accommodation\" is consequently hidden or excluded in Couchsurfing practices.\nACT II: offline performance among hosts, surfers and\nspaces\nGenerally speaking, those couchsurfers who show interest in cultural interaction and\ntheir sincereness in a personalized couch-request easily get access to the \"offline stage\"\n(Chen, 2011), where the face-to-face interaction takes place and basically continues the\npractice of the rules, values, and convention shown in the online performance of\nCouchsurfing. The Couchsurfing interaction with the locals, for example, is represented\nas a particular way of experiencing a place and knowing its people. Compared to the\nonline performance limited in literal expression and image display, these couchsurfers'\noffline performance is given in more sophisticated and varied ways, through which the\ncouchsurfer identity, the relationship among hosts, surfers and spaces, and the shared\nbelief behind the practice are shown.\nThe offline performance based on \"tourist-angst\" phenomenon\nWhen asked about the benefit of traveling with Couchsurfing, the couchsurfers usually\nmention \"a different experience from the one in mass tourism,\" which implies a vital part\nof couchsurfer identity:\nI don't like the crowded tourist sites, where tourists come, take photos and then leave. I hate this\nway of traveling and I don't want to be a tourist like that. Knowing a local person would make\nyour trip different. He or she may bring you to somewhere that tourists don't know. That's why\nI like Couchsurfing. (Candice, 21-year-old, female, Taiwanese surfer)\nThe hosts often share their favorite shops with me ... I love the small tea houses, where tourists\nnever go. (Wallis, 24-year-old, female, German surfer travelling in the Netherlands)\nMany tourists travel for collecting popular tourist attractions. That is not my style...For me\ntravel is about knowing a place from the local perspective. Couchsurfing makes my trip like\nthat. (Wade, 34-year-old, male, Taiwanese surfer and host)\nThese quotations embody the phenomenon of tourist angst, which can be observed in\ntraveling writing as well, as the authors seek to \"preserve their enjoyment of the periph-\nery by banishing tourists from it, or writing out the tourists' (Dann, 1999: 160).\nCouchsurfers take similar action to banish mass tourism from Couchsurfing performance\nand to show the couchsurfer identity: \"other people are tourists, while I am a traveler\"\n(MacCannell, 1976: 107). In many couchsurfers'oral expression, mass tourism is related\nto a predictable and shallow experience of place, typified by a short stop and quick\nglimpse in each place (Jacobsen, 2000). By emphasizing the negative image of mass\ntourism, couchsurfers distinguish Couchsurfing from it and make a binary version of\nmass tourism and Couchsurfing (see Table 1).\nTo display Couchsurfing as a specific travel style different from mass tourism, couch-\nsurfers tend to have interaction with their hosts to emphasize the relatively close relation-\nship with the host society while traveling. It is a shared belief that Couchsurfing invites\nsurfers to stay with local hosts and simultaneously allows insight into the local's private\nspaces and everyday life (Bialski, 2012; Chen, 2011). Hence, in the couchsurfers'perfor-\nmance, hosts represent part of local culture, and hosts' private spaces and semi-private\nspaces like the neighborhood represent the local living space. In other words, hosts and\nthe (semi-)private spaces are the indispensable roles to perform the \"authentic culture\"\nand to direct \"the specific ways to inscribe the place\" (Crang, 2006: 48). The trip of\nRachael, a 24-year-old, female, Taiwanese surfer, represents part of the scenarios of such\nperformance:\nMy host brought me to the places mainly for locals. We went for a drink, dancing, shopping at\nsupermarkets, and out walking the dog in the neighborhood. [...] I just followed the locals'way\nof living-- doing what they do, eating what they eat. Through this way I can experience the real\nlocal life.\nThese scenarios, such as having drinks with the hosts and walking the dog in the\nneighborhood, constitute Couchsurfing's offline performance, in which couchsurfers do\nnot passively follow the tourist gaze produced by tourism industry (see Urry, 2002), but\nactively experiencing the place and creating the meaning from it, that is, \"the real local\nlife.\" Through actual interaction with the locals as well as the surfers' bodily experi-\nences, couchsurfers construct the authenticity of their own mindset, that is, couchsurfers'\nway to make sense of this place (Crouch, 2000). By performing in this way, the couch-\nsurfer identity is also strengthened (Cohen et al., 2013).\n\"Non-monetary exchange\" is also performed in Couchsurfing to emphasize the dis-\ntinction between Couchsurfing and mass tourism. The non-monetary exchange principle,\nwhich makes the non-profit image of Couchsurfing (Germann Molz, 2013), keeps the\nhosts' hospitality away from commercialization, and thus the hospitality is priceless for\nmany couchsurfers, like Jack, a 32-year-old male Taiwanese host:\nI can afford a hotel, so free accommodation is never a reason for me to join Couchsurfing. I am\ndoing Couchsurfing because I want to experience the real local atmosphere, which is priceless.\n[...] According to my own experiences, the attachment of certain places often came from the\nhosts' hospitality and the interactions between us, which made the trips more meaningful.\nThe interesting part of this case is how a couchsurfer interprets and performs the non-\nmonetary-exchange of Couchsurfing. The principle does not lead surfers to interpret\nTable 1. Couchsurfers' binary version of mass tourism and Couchsurfing.\nMass tourism Couchsurfing\nTourist experiences Local experiences\nConsuming the place/culture Experiencing (locals') daily life\nCommodified spaces Living space\nCouchsurfing as a free accommodation, but the hospitality from \"a friend you haven't\nmet,\" that is, a friend-like relationship (Bialski, 2012), which makes Couchsurfing a\nmore personal (Zuev, 2013) and emotional (Bialski, 2012) performance. The interpreta-\ntion and performance of non-monetary-exchange principle corresponds to the value of\nCouchsurfing, which refers to building cross-cultural friendship and connection, rather\nthan crashing at a place for free.\nThe role of space in Couchsurfing performance\nMany researchers argue that space plays an active role in tourist performance (Coleman\nperformance is no exception. Earl, a 43-year-old Dutch male host, indicated the active\nrole of spatial setting to trigger the interaction:\nCouchsurfing is like camping. You have neighbors when you go camping. You also have\nneighbors at a hotel but you never see them, because they always close the door. You don't\nknow whether they are in their room or not. But in a camping site, you know your neighbors are\nthere through the window of the tent. Or, you see the tent is open, and then you walk there and\ntalk to them.\nEarl used the metaphor of a camping site to illustrate how a shared space stimulates the\ninteraction between strangers. In contrast to the divided spatial setting of the hotel,\nCouchsurfing makes tourists and locals more visible and approachable to each other.\nBialski's (2012) research also indicates a new relationship is easily built in the status in\nwhich the traveling strangers are sharing the same private space, like a room or a car. The\ncontact generated in the mobile world, according to Baumann (2003: 62), \"requires less\ntime and effort to be entered, and less time and effort to be broken.\" Although most surfers\nonly stay for a short period of time, the intimate atmosphere of the private space shared by\nhosts and surfers often triggers and sustains a friend-like relationship in Couchsurfing.\nAt the same time, various spatial meanings are created in the interaction between\nhosts and surfers during the offline performance. Locals'participation in surfers'journey\nis important in Couchsurfing performance, because it builds personal connection between\nsurfers and places.Although the surfers visit some must-go sites as mass tourists do, with\nthe locals' guide and company the surfers perform the visit as \"experiencing the place\nthrough locals'eyes,\" and thus a new meaning of the space is created. Rachael's (24-year-\nold, female, Taiwanese surfer) described her experience in Notre Dame, Paris:\nThe tourist brochures may tell about the history or the art value of the Notre Dame, which\nmeans nothing to me. Although I look at every detail of the architecture, I don't feel any\nconnection with it. But, when I visited it with my host at two o'clock at the midnight, we drank\nbeer outside of it, and I saw my host peeing there. These memories made me feel that, yes, I did\nhave certain connection with the Notre Dame.\nRachael's description, again, emphasized the contrast between couchsurfers and mass\ntourists through showing a different process constructing the spatial meaning. This case\nalso indicates the complexity of tourist performance, which actually is a display\nOwing to the existence of the conventional meaning of Notre Dame, a distinct spatial\nmeaning can be produced through a performance of subverting or challenging the con-\nventional meaning. In this performance, the couchsurfer identity is shown.\nLocal hosts' role in the subversion action is significant. The spatial meaning from\nlocal perspective is often connected to what Agnew (1987) called \"the sense of place,\"\nwhich, in many cases like Couchsurfing, has partly replaced the spatial meaning created\nand promoted by tourism industry through a process of sacralization (MacCannell,\n1973). Therefore, Couchsurfing and its fortuitous action which challenges the tourist\nconventions, signify more personal and diverse tourist experiences.\nThe backstage\nAccording to Goffman (1959), backstage is the region where the actors retire between\nperformances to relax and to prepare, and it also allows concealment of activities which\nmight discredit the performance out front. In Couchsurfing, the invisible surveillance of\nthe reputation system divides the front and back region for couchsurfers. For a surfer, the\nhost is the main audience in the front stage and also the one who judges the surfer's per-\nformance through reputation system, and vice versa. To keep the impression of a good\nsurfer, some surfers hide behaviors which seem inappropriate from the hosts. For exam-\nple, Cara, a 23-year-old Taiwanese surfer tried to conceal the fact that \"she was shopping\nlike a tourist\":\nNormally tourists would like to buy some luxury handbags when traveling in Europe. You\nknow, they are not that expensive there. [...] When I was Couchsurfing in Italy, I was afraid that\nmy host would find that I was shopping there. After shopping I didn't go back to the host\ndirectly but sat by Rome plaza, unwrapped the package, stuffed my new Gucci bag into my old\nbackpack, and then I dared to go to the host.\nCara's concealment displays how couchsurfer identity influences the surfers' behav-\niors. For those \"improper manners,\" such as tourist-like behaviors, which might incom-\npatible with surfers'image, are hidden within the backstage. The backstage of surfers not\nonly refers to a space without hosts, but also to a period of time staying alone at a hotel\nor hostel. Many surfers, like, Jacqueline, 24-year old Taiwanese surfer, arrange accom-\nmodation at a hotel or hostel when they need a break from intensive interaction with the\nhosts:\nI know that many hosts expect me to spend some time together and to talk with them. [...] If I\ndon't have enough time, or sometimes I feel tired of chatting with people, I would rather stay\nat a hostel. Like my trip to Cologne, I felt like to visit certain museum alone, and I only had\nlimited time, so I didn't do Couchsurfing.\nThe performative character of Couchsurfing interaction has been clearly shown in this\nquotation. For surfers, interaction with hosts is a necessary part of Couchsurfing performance\nfor the hosts, so Jacqueline arranged a backstage when she felt like to stay alone, which might\nnot fit in hosts' expectation in a Couchsurfing performance. As MacCannell (1973) argues,\nthe backstage functions to sustain the commonsense polarity of social life, including what is\nappropriate to show and what should be hidden. By creating the backstage, the social conven-\ntions of Couchsurfing are thus sustained and the inharmonious performance may be reduced.\nConclusion\nThrough the theoretical lens of theatrical performance, this article demonstrates the\ntransforming process of Couchsurfing, which extends from hospitality exchange to a\ntravel style with certain norms, value, and practice. On the stage of online performance,\nthe site organizer has set the tone of Couchsurfing. By highlighting cultural interaction\nbetween couchsurfers, the site organizer displays a cordial, tolerant, and cosmopolitan\natmosphere of Couchsurfing community. Since hosts have the right to decline the surf-\ners'couch request, the hosts also play a dominant role in leading the online performance,\nin which surfers tend to show an open-minded, friendly, and social image to fit into the\nhosts' expectation.\nAfter mutual selection, the couchsurfers who share the same value and perform prop-\nerly online are selected to the stage of offline performance, while others might be\nexcluded from the face-to-face interaction of Couchsurfing. In the offline performance,\nthe cultural interaction between hosts and surfers is still regarded necessary and impor-\ntant especially by the surfers, who tend to perform it as the way to build a personal and\nauthentic connection with the place they visit. By doing so, the surfers distinguish them-\nselves from mass tourists and show the couchsurfer identity. The reputation system func-\ntions to monitor couchsurfers' offline performance, and it marks the (in)appropriate\nbehaviors in couchsurfers' personal profile as part of online display. To avoid a negative\nreference, couchsurfers create a backstage to hide the \"improper behaviours\" which\nmight conflict with the social conventions of Couchsurfing.\nThus, the online performance, offline performance, mutual selection, reputation sys-\ntem, and the backstage constitute a series of mechanism, which, integrating the hosts'\nexpectation of cultural interaction, the surfers' mindset of tourist-angst, and the\nCouchsurfing organizer's managerial strategy, transforms Couchsurfing practice to a\nstylish way of travel with authentic and personalized experience. The social-media tech-\nnologies here play a role to connect the online and offline performance as whole and to\nstabilize the social conventions performed in both: the social-media technologies aid the\nselectionoftheproperCouchsurfingmembersfortheofflineperformance.Simultaneously,\nthe technologies help to capture the offline performance and to display it online to\nstrengthen the rules of Couchsurfing.\nDue to the ethnographical methods adopted by this study, subjectivity/objectivity is\nan unescapable issue. As I participated in the hospitality exchange network, I was\ninvolved in the Couchsurfing selection mechanism, which may categorizes like-minded\npeople into groups (Bialski, 2011; Germann Molz, 2007). That means, to some extent,\nmy identities, appearance and characteristics shown online, \"a Taiwanese women work-\ning in academia abroad,\" have decided the person I may meet, the data I may collect and\nmy perspective. Instead of claiming the objectivity of this study, I admit the unavoidable\nlimitation owing to the researcher's identities, which simultaneously contribute to a par-\nticular angle of view for Couchsurfing studies.\nAnother limitation of this study is that I was not able to update the latest situation of\nCouchsurfing is still growing and developing because social-media technologies,\nmobile devices, and the accessibility to the Internet are improving all the time. In the\nCouchsurfing community, a large number of new members may challenge the existing\nconventions and influence the balance the reciprocal relation of Couchsurfing. At the\nsame time, a new website, Airbnb, adopts a similar idea of Couchsurfing and develops\nit as a new business model, which allows the hosts to charge their guests and takes com-\nmission from the hospitality exchange. Airbnb has become very popular in recent years\nand has attracted some Couchsurfing members to join. The appearance of such website\nand its influence on Couchsurfing are worthy of future research to explore the new shar-\ning economic system in tourism or to further study the latest development of\nCouchsurfing.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship,\nand/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nNote\n1.
