Among children less than 5\nyears of age, hepatoblastoma accounted for 91% of primary hepatic malignancy cases,\nwhereas among those 15 to 19 years of age, hepatocellular carcinoma accounted for 87% of\ncases.

In contrast, pri-\nmary hepatic malignancies in children are most\ncommonly either hepatoblastoma or hepatocellular carci-\nnoma. Hepatocellular carcinoma has been observed in\nyoung children with tyrosinemia and other inherited met-\nabolic disorders7 and in older children with hepatitis B\nvirus infection acquired perinatally.8-10 However, the ep-\nidemiology of primary hepatic malignancies in U.S. chil-\ndren is not well characterized. Most available information\nis from institution-based case series; since a 1975 national\nsurvey of U.S. pediatric surgeons,11 no population-based\nevaluation of primary liver cancer in U.S. children has\nbeen published.\nIn recent decades, the advent of pediatric liver trans-\nplantation and other developments has brought increased\nattention to a number of potentially fatal childhood liver\ndiseases, including primary hepatic malignancy. Pediatric\nhepatocellular carcinoma is of special interest because its\nrates in children decreased in Taiwan after introduction of\nroutine infant hepatitis B vaccination.12,13 To improve\nthe medical and surgical management of primary hepatic\nmalignancies and to develop and evaluate prevention\nAbbreviations: NCHS, National Center for Health Statistics; SEER, Surveil-\nlance, Epidemiology, and End Results; ICD-O, International Classification of Dis-\nease for Oncology; ICCC, International Classification for Childhood Cancers.\nFrom the 1Division of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition, Department of\nPediatrics, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD; and\n2Division of Viral Hepatitis, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta,\nK.M.S. is currently with the Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention, Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA.\nAddress reprint requests to: Anil Darbari, M.D., Assist.

It codes histology\nand cancer site by the International Classification of Dis-\nease for Oncology, second edition (ICD-O-2), and by the\nInternational Classification for Childhood Cancers\n(ICCC) systems.16,17 Histologically confirmed cases of\nto 1997 were included in this study. Other information\ncollected included duration of survival after diagnosis and\npopulation characteristics.\nPopulation Data. Population estimates were ob-\ntained from the U.S. Census Bureau.\nStatistical Analysis. Data analyses were performed\nusing SPSS and Sigmastat (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL) sta-\ntistical packages. Rates were calculated using population\ndata and adjusted to the 1990 U.S. standard population\nusing the direct method. Differences in age-specific inci-\ndence of hepatoblastoma and hepatocellular carcinoma\nand differences in gender-specific incidence were analyzed\nby the 2 test. Trends in annual incidence rates were an-\nalyzed using standard linear regression methods.\nResults\nMultiple-Cause-of-Death Data.

For hepato-\ncellular carcinoma, the survival was significantly lower in\nthe third, fourth, and fifth years following the diagnosis as\ncompared with the first year (P  .001). There were no\nstatistically significant differences in the survival by age,\nsex, or race, although the numbers of persons within each\nsubcategory were small (data not shown).\nFig. 2.

Age-adjusted incidence rates of primary hepatic malignancies\n(multiple-cause-of-death, NCHS).\nDiscussion\nPrimary hepatic malignancies in children are relatively\nrare. Based on SEER data, primary hepatic malignancies\nmake up approximately 1% of all malignant neoplasms\namong children less than 20 years of age. Previously pub-\nlished reviews of hepatoblastoma and hepatocellular car-\ncinoma have been generally institution-based case series,\nand the clinical reports on hepatocellular carcinoma in\nU.S. children since 1905 are scarce. Most of the reports\nfrom the United States are case series or questionnaires of\nries9,22,23 and epidemiologic analysis of hepatocellular car-\ncinoma from the cancer registry24 of China. The data\npresented here, which are based on nationwide death cer-\ntificate data (NCHS) and population-based registries\n(SEER), provide a more complete and representative\noverview than can be obtained from case series.\nAnnually, 36 to 69 deaths from primary malignant\nneoplasms of the liver among children less than 20 years\nof age were reported in the multiple-cause-of-death data-\nbase. From the SEER database, 67% and 31% of primary\nhepatic malignancies were histologically confirmed as\nhepatoblastoma and hepatocellular carcinoma, respec-\ntively. Applying these percentages to the multiple-cause-\nof-death database, an estimated 615 children (average, 34\nper year) and 284 children (average, 16 per year) would\nhave died of hepatoblastoma and hepatocellular carci-\nAs reflected in the SEER data, hepatoblastoma is gen-\nerally a disease of children less than 5 years of age. Rates of\nhepatoblastoma are 20-fold higher than rates of hepato-\ncellular carcinoma for children under 5 years of age. Based\non SEER data, the rates among boys and girls did not\ndiffer significantly (M/F ratio was 1.32 for hepatoblas-\ntoma and 1.27 for hepatocellular carcinoma). This con-\ntrasts with previous reports, in which a stronger male\npredominance for both hepatoblastoma and hepatocellu-\nRisk factors for hepatoblastoma are not well character-\nized. Hepatoblastoma has been shown to be associated\nwith Beckwith-Weidmann syndrome25,26 hemihypertro-\nphy, and familial adenomatous polyposis, none of which\nhave unique ICD-9 codes.27 The relatively low incidence\nof these conditions did not allow us to examine their\nassociation with hepatoblastoma in the multiple cause of\ndeath database. Recent reports from the United States and\nJapan have suggested an increased incidence of hepato-\nblastoma in extremely low birth weight infants.28-31 Be-\ncause birth weight is not collected in the SEER database,\nwe could not analyze this association.\nFig. 3.

For hepatoblastoma, 6 patients were excluded from the analysis because they were autopsy or death certificate case (2), because race values were not\nprovided (2), and because they were alive with no survival time (2). For hepatocellular carcinoma, 2 patients were excluded from the survival analysis because of\ndevelopment of a second malignancy (1), and because they were autopsy or death certificate cases (1). Data are age adjusted to the 1970 U.S. standard population.\n*Denotes P  .001 compared with percentage surviving 1 year following diagnosis.\nRisk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma in children\nhepatocellular carcinoma was the third most frequently\nseen pediatric liver tumor at the Armed Forces Institute of\nPathology.18 Associated conditions were seen in less than\n25% of cases, including biliary atresia, congenital hepatic\nfibrosis, Byler disease, and Wilson disease. Hepatorenal\ntyrosinemia is associated with an early age of onset of\nhepatocellular carcinoma.32 This condition could not be\nexamined specifically in the multiple-cause-of-death da-\ntabase; aromatic amino acid disorders in general were re-\nported in less than 2% of hepatocellular carcinoma\ndeaths. Hepatocellular carcinoma is strongly associated\nwith hepatitis B virus infection in adults.33 In young chil-\ndren with hepatitis B virus infection, hepatocellular car-\ncinoma has been reported from Southeast Asia and\ncause-of-death database, less than 6% had any associated\nliver disease coded, e.g., chronic liver disease, hepatitis\nB, and others. The relative absence of contributory con-\nditions reported with hepatocellular carcinoma in the\nmultiple-cause-of-death database suggests that these con-\nditions may have been underdiagnosed or unrecognized.\nHowever, the higher proportion of foreign-born children\nwith hepatitis B listed as a contributory cause of death\ncompared with U.S.-born children highlights an impor-\ntant feature of the epidemiology of hepatitis B virus infec-\ntion in the United States. Although prevalence of\nhepatitis B virus infection is relatively low in the United\nStates, where, overall, only 5% of the general population\nhas serologic evidence of past infection and less than 1%\nare chronically infected,35 the extent to which children\nacquire hepatitis B virus infection in the United States has\nnot been appreciated, primarily because most infections\nin this age group are asymptomatic. Not including peri-\nnatal infections, recent estimates indicate that 16,000\nchildren less than 10 years old were being infected annu-\nally in the United States prior to implementation of rou-\nfully immunized with 3 doses of hepatitis B vaccine,37 and\nthe incidence of acute hepatitis B among children less\nrisk of developing chronic infection and its sequelae such\nas hepatocellular carcinoma is inversely related to age,\nroutine childhood hepatitis B immunization will eventu-\nally have a major impact on hepatitis B-related chronic\nliver disease deaths among both children and adults.\nThe success of routine childhood hepatitis B immuni-\nzation in interrupting hepatitis B virus transmission and\npreventing chronic infection has been demonstrated in\ndeveloping countries where most infections are acquired\nin infancy and early childhood. During the 15 years after\nroutine childhood hepatitis B immunization was imple-\nmented in Taiwan, chronic hepatitis B virus prevalence\namong children less than 15 years old declined 93%, and\nhepatocellular carcinoma rates among 6- to 14-year-old\nGiven the absence of alcoholic liver disease in children\nand the association of some inborn errors of metabolism\nwith hepatocellular carcinoma in childhood, we expected\nthat the epidemiology of hepatocellular carcinoma in U.S.\nchildren might differ from that for adults. For childhood\nhepatocellular carcinoma, we observed (1) no increase in\nthe annual incidence over the last 2 decades compared\nwith the rate for adults, which increased from\na contributing cause in children than adults; (3) lack of\nmale predominance compared with adults among whom\nincidence is 3-fold higher in men versus women40; (4) no\ndifference in incidence in whites versus blacks compared\nwith a 2-fold higher incidence in blacks compared with\nwhites in adults40; and (5) poorer 5-year survival rates\ncompared with those in adults.40\nThe 5-year survival rate for children with hepatoblas-\ntoma was 52%. An improvement in surgical techniques\nand improved chemotherapy along with selective use of\ntransplantation could account for these survival rates.41-43\nHowever, hepatocellular carcinoma survival rates con-\ntinue to be poor. The 18% overall 5-year survival rate in\nthe U.S. children with hepatocellular carcinoma in this\nstudy is similar to that reported from previous studies.18,20\nIn contrast, the 5-year survival rate in adults from an\nInternational Registry of Hepatic Tumors in Liver Trans-\nplantation has been shown to be 44.4%.43 Survival rates\nare better with surgical resection plus transplantation in\nselected groups of individuals41-43 compared with resec-\ntion alone and better for resection compared with no re-\ntechniques such as intrahepatic chemoembolization have\nbeen shown to be promising in children with unresectable\nThe United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) has\noperated the Organ Procurement and Transplantation\nNetwork (OPTN) under contract with the Health Re-\nsources and Services Administration of the U.S. Depart-\nreview whether liver transplantation had any effect on\nprimary hepatic malignancies, we reviewed the OPTN\nstudied in SEER and NCHS databases.

This could result in\nvascular invasion and be considered a factor for worse\nsurvival in adults, even with resection.41,43 We hope to\nimprove the awareness of childhood hepatocellular carci-\nnoma among physicians caring for children so that these\nchildren are diagnosed earlier and their survival is im-\nproved.\nThis study has several limitations. Autopsies are not\nroutinely performed to verify cause of death; therefore,\ndiagnoses may not be accurate. Lack of differentiation\nbetween hepatoblastoma and hepatocellular carcinoma\nbased on ICD-9 CM codes in the multiple-cause-of-death\ndatabase makes finer analyses impossible. The SEER da-\ntabase is representative of 14% of the U.S. population and\nshould not be extrapolated to the entire United States.\nOur study highlights the need for inclusion of contribut-\ning causes of death in these databases.\nPrimary hepatic malignancies in children are predom-\ninantly hepatoblastoma in children less than 5 years of age\nand hepatocellular carcinoma in children older than 5\nyears. Over the last 2 decades, rates of hepatoblastoma in\nchildren less than 20 years of age have increased, but rates\nof hepatocellular carcinoma have been relatively stable.\nSurvival rates for hepatoblastoma are substantially higher\nthan for hepatocellular carcinoma. Finally, the epidemi-\nology of hepatocellular carcinoma in children appears to\ndiffer from that in adults. Risk factors and conditions\ncontributing to both hepatoblastoma and hepatocellular\ncarcinoma need to be better characterized to optimize the\nmedical and surgical management and to improve the\nsurvival of children with such highly fatal malignancies.\nReferences\n1.
