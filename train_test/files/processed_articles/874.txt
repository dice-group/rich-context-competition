ERS Journals Ltd\n Keywords: Arachidonic acid\nfish consumption\nlung function\nFatty acids are essential nutrients that are incorporated\ninto a variety of cell membranes. These fatty acids, speci-\nfically linoleic, eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic\nare found in varying amounts in the human diet and are\nmetabolized to arachidonic acid. The further metabolism\nof arachidonic acid, by cyclooxygenase and lipoxy-\ngenase pathways, yields a variety of prostenoids and\nleukotrienes which are potentially toxic to cell mem-\nbranes, smooth muscle, and epithelial and endothelial\nsurfaces. In contrast, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which\npredominates in marine fish, tends to counteract and\ninhibit the uptake and incorporation of arachidonic acid\ninto membrane phospholipids and dilute arachidonic acid\nas a potential substrate for oxidization. The relatively\nlow prevalences of coronary heart disease and asthma\namong Eskimos and other populations who have high\ndietary intake of EPA have suggested the hypothesis that\nfish intake may be protective for the occurrence of asthma\nand other diseases [1]. To date, no population based\nstudy has examined the effect of chronic dietary intake\nof fish and its relationship to level of pulmonary function.\nWe chose to examine this hypothesis using dietary intake\ndata from the First National Health and Nutrition Survey\nMaterials and methods\nThe First National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey (NHANES I) was conducted at 90 locations across\nsurvey of adults only, with no dietary information, was\nwere performed, trained interviewers visited the subjects\nin their homes to administer socioeconomic and medical\nhistory questionnaires. A detailed sub-sample of 3,478\nsubjects aged 30 or older was given a more detailed\nmedical history questionnaire and a spirometric examin-\nation. The detailed subsample was also representative\nof the U.S. population. This included standard respiratory\nquestions from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood\nInstitute questionnaire on chronic respiratory disease.\nThey also included smoking history, including whether\nthe subject had ever smoked one hundred cigarettes,\ncurrent number of cigarettes smoked per day, maximal\ncigarettes per day, years of smoking, and years since\nquitting. A Food Frequency questionnaire asked about\nusual consumption of fish in the past three months.\nIntake of fish was coded as portions per week. Inter-\nviewers and medical examiners who conducted the\nNHANES I survey were specially trained to ensure that\nconduct of the survey at each site was standardized.\nSpirometric examinations were performed using an\nOhio Medical Instruments Corporation Model 800 elec-\ntronic spirometer, a storage x-y oscilloscope that displayed\nflow-volume curves for monitoring purposes, a single\nchannel linear script chart recorder, and a data acquisi-\ntion unit to encode, convert, and record on digital tape\nthe spirometry signals. A pneumatic 5 litre calibration\nprocedure was performed at the beginning of each session\non each day. The electronic portion of the instrumentation\nwas calibrated before each subject was tested. Barometric\npressure, temperature, saturated (BPTS) correction factors\nwere computed and encoded. Further details have been\npublished elsewhere [3].\nAll subjects were given a complete physical examination\nby a physician before they performed the spirometric\nexamination. Subjects who were pregnant, or had acute\nor chronic medical conditions that the physician felt made\na spirometry manoeuvre inappropriate were excluded\nfrom the spirometry examination. At least five trials\nwere required for a test set to be complete for an individual.\nThe best trial was defined as the trial with the maximum\nsum of forced vital capacity FVC and forced expiratory\nvolume in one second (FEV\n) from at least two repro-\nducible and error free trials. If reproducibility was not\nachieved the subjects were excluded from the analysis.\nFurther details have been published [3]. The data from\nthe NHANES I were compared to results from the Harvard\nSix City Study, and, adjusting for height and age, the\nresults were essentially identical [3]. These exclusions\nAs noted previously, the variance of the pulmonary\nfunction measurements increases with height and age [3].\nLogarithmic transformation of the pulmonary function\nmeasurements achieved homoscedastic residuals with\nrespect to height and age. Hence regression analyses\nwere done using log (FEV\n) as the dependent variable.\nThe units of the dependent variable are the log of the ml\nof FEV\n. Age and height were also converted to their\nnatural logarithm transformation in the analysis. In a\nregression of the logarithm of lung function against an\nexplanatory variable, the coefficient of the variable is\neasily related to the percent difference from predicted by\nthe equation:\n100 \u00d7 (exp () - 1) = % difference from predicted\nfor a unit change in the explanatory variable.\nCigarette smoking is clearly an important predictor of\nFEV\n. To assure our assessment of dietary fish intake\nwas not confounded by any correlation with smoking,\nwe first developed the best models we could using smoking\nvariables, before examining fish intake. Current cigarettes\nper day were used to index the effect of current smoking.\nWe note that a model for the logarithm of FEV\nis a\nmultiplicative model, so the distinction between main\neffects and interactions is less clear. Lung function may\nnot decrease linearly with cigarettes per day, so a square\nroot transform of cigarettes per day was also considered\nas a variable in the models. Such a transformation has\nproved superior to the untransformed variable in evaluating\nthe association of cigarette smoking with markers of\ninflammation such as peripheral white cell counts [4].\nCumulative smoking may be described either by pack\nyears or by years smoked. We considered both possi-\nbilities. Again, square root transforms of pack years and\nyears smoked were also considered. A dummy variable\nfor former smokers was also examined. The different\ncombinations of terms for current and past smoking were\nexamined, and the terms that best fit the model were\nchosen. Interaction terms were included only if at least\nmarginally significant (p<0.10). Once the smoking model\nwas developed, we considered the impact of dietary fish\nintake on FEV\n. Dietary fish intake is strongly asso-\nciated with socioeconomic status. To test whether that\nmight be confounding any observed association, we re-\nestimated our regression controlling for family income.\nThis reduced the sample size by 103 individuals who did\nnot provide such data. We also examined whether the\nimpact of fish consumption varied by age or gender. To\navoid a major loss of power, this was done by testing\ninteraction terms for fish consumption by females, and\nfor fish consumption in persons over the age of 52 yrs.\nThe NHANES I survey was a stratified clustered sample,\nwith all the subjects being drawn from the 90 geographic\nsites. Subjects who live in the same area are often more\nalike on certain characteristics than subjects randomly\nchosen from the population. If those characteristics are\nimportant for the outcomes being studied, and are not\nperfectly controlled for, there is likely to be correlation\nbetween the residuals from subjects within each site. We\nhave dealt with these design effects by incorporating a\nrandom site effect into our analysis. In addition, we\nhave estimated robust variance estimates. This method\ngives standard errors for the regression coefficients that\nare asymptotically unbiased even if the correlation in the\nresiduals is not perfectly specified. To estimate these\nrandom site effects and robust variances, we have used\nthe Generalized Estimating Equations of ZEGER and LIANG\n[5]. The GEE macro of M.R. Karim of the Department\nof Biostatistics, Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and\nPublic Health was used.\nResults\nThe distribution of variables used in this analysis is\nshown in table 1. Table 2 compares subjects without\nspirometry to those with spirometry values. Subjects\nwithout spirometry values were more likely to have asthma\nor bronchitis, more likely to be a smoker, and had greater\npack yrs of exposure. The square root transform of\ncigarettes per day was a better predictor of FEV\nthan a\nlinear form. The baseline model is shown in table 3.\nWhen added to the baseline model dietary fish intake\nshowed a protective association with FEV\nchitic subjects were excluded, the impact of dietary fish\np=0.059). When smokers were excluded, the effect of\np=0.061). When fish intake was divided into categories,\na stepped dose-response relationship was observed.\nCompared to subjects who consumed fewer than one\nportion of fish per week, subjects who consumed one\nportion per week had a covariate adjusted 1.35% higher\nFEV\n(SEM=1.35%), and subjects consuming more than\none portion per week had a covariate adjusted 2.51 higher\nFEV\n(SEM=1.16%). The test for trend across the categories\nwas significant (p=0.04). Controlling for family income\nhad little effect on the association between dietary fish\nintake and FEV\n, except for the reduction in sample size\na different slope for dietary fish intake in females (p=0.46)\nDiscussion\nfrom the First National Health and Nutrition Survey we\nfound a monotonic relationship between dietary por-\ntions of fish per week and the natural logorithm of\npredicted FEV\n. The magnitude of the level of effect\nobserved in this study was 115 ml difference in FEV\nbetween those eating fish less than once a week and those\neating fish more than once a week. This relationship\nwas insensitive to the exclusion of currently sympto-\nmatic asthmatic or bronchitic subjects. The effect size\nwas slightly larger when smokers were excluded from\nthe analysis. Finally, dietary fish intake did not appear\nto be a proxy for socioeconomic status.\nTo our knowledge, no epidemiologic studies have been\nperformed concerning the relationship between dietary\nfish intake and any respiratory outcome. Short term\nphysiologic studies have yielded conflicting results on\nthe relationship of dietary eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)\nand its effect on asthma. KIRSCH and co-workers studied\nthe effect of EPA on 12 adult asthmatic patients [6].\nPulmonary function tests were done at baseline and at\ntotal of 8 weeks. No significant effect of either high or\nlow dose EPA ingestion on pulmonary function was\nnoted. However, this study did note an alteration, in\nboth the high and the low dose groups, in leukocyte\nfunction in patients with asthma. This effect was to\ndecrease the leukocyte content of arachidonic acid and\nthe generation of the leukotriene B\n) and prosta-\nglandin E\n) from arachidonic acid. Only the high\ndose EPA, however, led to significant inhibition of\npolymorphonuclear leukocyte chemotaxis. No signifi-\ncant effect on symptoms was noted in this investigation.\nPARM and co-workers studied 20 adult subjects with mild\nasthma [7]. Twelve subjects received capsules contain-\ning 3.2 g of the EPA and 2.2 g of docosahexaenoic acid\ndaily, and 8 asthmatic subjects received placebo cap-\nsules containing olive oil for 10 wks in a double-blind\nfashion.

This\nstudy confirmed the results of KIRSCH et al. [6] in that\nneutrophil leukotriene B\ngeneration was decreased by\nEPA. In addition, neutrophil chemotaxis was substantially\nand significantly suppressed.\nPAYAN et al. [8] examined two groups of 6 adult asth-\nmatics who were receiving 0.1 or 4 g of EPA daily for\n8 weeks, and also found reduction in leukocyte arachi-\ndonic acid and LTB\nand PGE\nwith the higher dose of\nEPA. Although a variety of studies have documented\nan effect of fish oil on leukotriene production in vivo\nfrom inflammatory cells [6\u00ad8] our study is the first to\nexamine this issue in an epidemiologic context and find\na significant relationship between ordinary dietary fish\nintake and level of pulmonary function.\nWe wish to stress some of the methodologic deficiencies\nof our investigation. This investigation is a cross-sectional\nstudy and thus cannot establish a temporal relation-\nship between fish intake and pulmonary function. In\naddition, food frequency questionnaire data is inherently\nvariable [9]. Also, supplemental use of fish oil and other\ndietary supplements were not examined. Finally, the\neffects of medication use on our results cannot be asses-\nsed. It is certainly possible that subjects who eat fish\non a regular basis are those who follow a more healthy\nlifestyle and it is not the fish per se but some other dietary\ncomponent correlated with fish which is responsible for\nthese associations. However, further evaluation of fish\nintake and its relationship to pulmonary function and\nasthma symptoms in epidemiology would be worthwhile.\nReferences\n1. Horrobin DF.
