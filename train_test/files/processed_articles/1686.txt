Liu, Coughlin, and McBride (1991) reported\nthat older adults with greater limitations in activities of daily\nliving (ADLs) are less likely to continue to live indepen-\ndently and utilize assisted-living arrangements earlier. Mod-\nels of the disablement process (Nagi, 1979; Verbrugge &\nJette, 1994) postulate that impairments resulting from pa-\nthology (e.g., disease) lead to limitations in physical activi-\nties (e.g., walking), which subsequently alter individuals'\nability to perform these tasks of daily living. Research is\nneeded to investigate disparities in health risk factors that\ncan result in functional impairment. The current study in-\nvestigates the impact of hypertension, which is more preva-\nlent among Hispanics, in order to quantify the impact of this\nrisk factor on Mexican American elders' ability to perform\nADLs and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs).\nDespite inconsistent terminology in describing the con-\nstruct that ADLs and IADLs measure (e.g., \"disability\" by\ntions\" by Johnson & Wolinsky, 1993; and \"functional status\"\nby Liang et al., 2008), the tasks assessed by ADL and IADL\nmeasures are relatively consistent in the literature.ADL tasks\ninclude basic self-care activities, such as bathing and eating\n(Katz, Ford, Moskowitz, Jackson, & Jaffe, 1963), and IADL\ntasks are those activities necessary to run a household, in-\ncluding meal preparation and keeping track of finances\n(Lawton & Brody, 1969). Previous longitudinal analyses\nhave indicated that ADL/IADL limitations increase with age\n(e.g., Bowen & Gonzalez, 2008; Kahng, Dunkle, & Jackson,\n2004; Liang et al.). Although Spector, Katz, Murphy, and\nFulton (1987) suggested that older adults generally become\ndependent in IADLs before ADLs, loss of basic ADL abili-\nties may have more serious consequences. For example, in-\ndividuals with greater dependency in ADLs, but not IADLs,\nhave higher mortality rates and greater likelihood of utilizing\nan assisted-living facility (Liu, Manton, & Aragon, 2000).\nMultiple studies support a link between poorer health status\nand ADL/IADL limitations in the older adult community. In\nparticular, cardiovascular health problems, including hyper-\ntension, have been shown to have a more prominent harmful\neffect on ADL/IADL limitations than do other types of health\nconditions that may affect older adults (e.g., osteoporosis;\nfound that ever having a hypertension diagnosis was predic-\ntive of greater disability status for both men and women.\nSimilar findings by Wu, Huang, Wu, McCrone, and Lai\n(2007) indicated that hypertension was among one of the\nhighest risk factors for severe disability (defined as two or\nmore ADL limitations) in a sample of community-dwelling\nolder adults. In a literature review by Stuck and colleagues\n(1999), hypertension was one of the medical conditions most\nclosely associated with functional status decline, with 13\nindependent studies reporting significant risk of functional\nstatus decline for those self-reporting hypertension.\nMore than half of American adults older than 60 years are\nestimated to have hypertension (Ostchega,Yoon, Hughes, &\nLouis, 2008), and this rate rises to three fourths by age 70\n(U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2008).\nFor Mexican Americans aged 65 years and older, the rate of\nhypertension reaches approximately 60% (Satish, Stroup-\nBenham, Espino, Markides, & Goodwin, 1998). Thus, the\nimpact of hypertension on the ADL/IADL limitations\nThe Relation of Hypertension to Changes in ADL/IADL\nLimitations of Mexican American Older Adults\nGrace I. L. Caskie,1 MaryAnn C. Sutton,1 and Jennifer A. Margrett2\n1Department of Education and Human Services, Lehigh University, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.\n2Department of Human Development and Family Studies, Iowa State University, Ames.\nHypertension, highly prevalent and often undiagnosed among older MexicanAmericans, is associated with greater\nlimitations in activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) that can lead to\ngreater dependency for older adults. Using data from the Hispanic Established Populations for Epidemiologic\nStudies of the Elderly study, the rate of increase in ADL/IADL limitations for a 7-year period was examined for\n3,046 older Mexican Americans classified either as reporting hypertension at baseline, first reporting hypertension\nat subsequent waves, or never reporting hypertension. Latent growth models indicated increased ADL/IADL\nlimitations over time; individuals with hypertension evidenced greater increases than those without hypertension.\nAge, comorbidities, and depression were positively related to greater ADL/IADL limitations at baseline for all\ngroups; only age was consistently related to ADL/IADL change over time. Development of hypertension may in-\ncrease the risk of ADL/IADL decline, but early diagnosis and treatment may attenuate this effect.\nKey Words: ADLs--Cardiovascular disease--IADLs--Longitudinal change--Minority and diverse populations.\nexperienced by older adults may be especially great for older\nadults in general and for Mexican American older adults in\nparticular. For adults, hypertension is generally defined as a\nblood pressure more than 140/90 mm Hg (e.g., Hajjar &\nphysicians only after at least two separate blood pressure\nreadings more than this level (Carretero & Oparil, 2000;\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2008). If\nhypertension is left untreated, serious cardiovascular health\nthreats can occur, including heart attacks and strokes, and, as\na result, hypertension is associated with increased mortality\nrates over time (Hajjar & Kotchen).\nDespite the potential health complications associated\nwith hypertension and the high prevalence of this condition\nwithin the Mexican American community, little research\nhas focused on the links between hypertension and ADL/\nIADL limitations for Mexican Americans. Kington and\nSmith (1997) found that chronic diseases, including\nhypertension, led to greater functional decline for African\nAmerican and Hispanic older adults than for Whites, but\nthis relationship disappeared when controlling for socioeco-\nnomic status. In addition, Mexican Americans older than 65\nyears are among the groups least likely to achieve hyperten-\nsion control through medication adherence and lifestyle al-\nterations (Wang &Wang, 2004); for example, approximately\n13% of Mexican Americans did not alter their diet or exer-\ncise routine, and 31% did not take blood pressure medica-\ntion. Thus, Mexican Americans could be at substantial risk\nfor decrements in overall well-being due to a hypertension\ndiagnosis.\nStuck and colleagues (1999) called for additional\nresearch on the underlying causes of change in functional\nstatus decline (defined as a combination of ADL/IADL and\nphysical function limitations) among older adults, such as\nthe impact of chronic diseases like hypertension. Given the\nlack of research on the effects of hypertension in the Mexican\nAmerican community, it is important to look at subsequent\nchanges in ADL/IADL limitations in this group. In addi-\ntion, because hypertension is often a precursor to more\nserious cardiovascular problems, the timing of if and when\nan older adult develops hypertension may influence the\nincrease in ADL/IADL limitations. Because hypertension\nmay be comorbid with other chronic health conditions that\naffect ADL and IADL limitations (e.g., Kington & Smith,\n1997; Stuck et al.), the comorbidity of arthritis, diabetes,\nheart attack, and stroke was examined in the current study\nas a predictor of ADL/IADL limitations. Other correlates of\nADL/IADL limitations were also examined, including de-\npressive symptomatology, acculturation, and demographic\ncharacteristics. Past research has indicated that depression\nis related to greater ADL/IADL limitations (Fifield, Tennen,\nReisine, & McQuillan, 1998; Friedman, Lyness, Delavan,\nLi, & Barker, 2008; Starkstein, Mayberg, Leiguarda,\nPreziosi, & Robinson, 1992). However, risk for ADL/IADL\nlimitations can be lower with increased physical activity\nlevels (Miller, Rejeski, Reboussin, Ten Have, & Ettinger,\n2000). Although physical activity was not directly assessed\nin the current study, previous studies of Latino samples have\nfound that more acculturated individuals are more likely to\nreport exercising regularly (Cantero, Richardson, Baezconde-\nGarbanati, & Marks, 1999) and meet recommendations\nfor moderate and vigorous physical activity (Evenson,\nSarmiento, & Ayala, 2004) and less likely to report a seden-\ntary lifestyle (P\u00e9rez-Stable, Mar\u00edn, & VanOss Mar\u00edn, 1994).\nFinally, reports of ADL limitations have been found to be\nhigher for women, to increase with age, and to be lower for\nmore educated individuals (e.g., Amaducci et al., 1998;\nThus, the present study examined change over time in\nADL and IADL limitations for a group of community-\ndwelling Mexican American older adults. We hypothesized\nthat significant increases in ADL and IADL limitations\nwould be found over time, given the previous research\ndemonstrating this trend. Furthermore, three groups were\ncompared: those with hypertension at baseline, those with\nhypertension at a later time point, and those who never had\nhypertension. We hypothesized that significant differences\nwould be found in the ADL and IADL trajectories based on\nthe timing of development of hypertension such that the two\ngroups with hypertension would experience greater increases\nin ADL/IADL limitations over time. Finally, we examined\ndemographic variables and other potential correlates ofADL\nand IADL performance, hypothesizing that more comorbid\nchronic conditions, more depressive symptoms, lower accul-\nturation, being female, greater age, and less education would\nbe related to greater ADL and IADL limitations.\nMethods\nParticipants\nThe current study utilized the longitudinal Hispanic\nEstablished Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the\nMarkides & Ray, 2005), which is archived for secondary\ndata analysis with the Inter-university Consortium for\nPolitical and Social Research. The archived database con-\ntained variables collected for a sample of 3,050 Mexican\nAmericans aged 65 years or older. The current analysis\ndeleted four participants from the archived database due to\nthe lack of ADL data at any of the time points. The analysis\ncation (SD = 3.9; range = 0\u00ad20); in addition, it included\ndemographic variables are presented in Table 1.\nThe Hispanic EPESE used a probability sampling method\nto obtain a representative sample of noninstitutionalized\nMexicanAmerican elders fromTexas, New Mexico, Colorado,\nArizona, and California; an 86% response rate was obtained\nof those initially contacted to participate in the study. All\nCaskie et al.\ndata were collected through face-to-face interviews conducted\nin the homes of participants with interviewers who were flu-\nent in both Spanish and English; the majority of interviews\nwere conducted in Spanish. The average time to complete the\nadditional information about the Hispanic EPESE methodol-\nogy.) The first wave of data collection took place between\nMeasures\nHypertension status.--Hypertension status was assessed\nusing a combination of: (a) self-reported hypertension (\"Has\na doctor ever told you that you have high blood pressure?\"),\n(b) self-reported hypertension medications (\"Are you cur-\nrently taking any medication for high blood pressure?\"), (c)\nthe average of two systolic blood pressure values, and (d)\nthe average of two diastolic blood pressure values. Partici-\npants who answered affirmatively to both of the self-report\nquestions or who self-reported hypertension and had either\nan average systolic pressure at or more than 140 mm Hg or\nan average diastolic pressure at or more than 90 mm Hg\nwere classified as having hypertension (Markides, 1999).\nUsing this variable calculated at each of the four waves, par-\nticipants were then classified into one of the following three\ngroups: those with high blood pressure (HBP) at baseline\n(i.e., Wave 1), those with HBP at a later time point (i.e.,\nWaves 2, 3, or 4), and those never having HBP. The sample\nsizes for these three groups were as follows: (a) Baseline\nActivities of daily living.--Participants were asked if they\nneeded any assistance with the following seven activities:\nwalking across a small room, bathing, personal grooming,\ndressing, eating, getting out of bed and into a chair, and\ntoileting (Branch, Katz, Kniepmann, & Papsidero, 1984;\nKatz et al., 1963). The ADL total score is the total number\nof areas with limitations as reported by the participant; thus,\nhigher scores indicate greater need for assistance. Descrip-\ntive statistics for all measures are given in Table 2.\nInstrumental activities of daily living.--The IADL\nscale assessed limitations in a total of eight areas: using\nthe telephone, traveling alone, shopping, preparing meals,\ndoing light housework, taking medication, keeping track\nof personal finances, and heavy housework (Lawton &\nBrody, 1969). Similar to the ADL measure, the total score\nfor IADLs represented the total number of areas for which\nthe participant reported needing assistance (yes = 1, no = 0),\nTable 1.

The\npossible range for ADLs was 0\u00ad7 and for IADLs was 0\u00ad8. ADLs = activities of\ndaily living; HBP = high blood pressure; IADLs = instrumental activities of\ndaily living.\nwith higher total scores indicating greater need for\nassistance.\nDemographic covariates.--Three demographic variables\nwere controlled for in the analyses: sex, age, and education.\nParticipants were asked to specify their sex, age in years,\nand the highest grade of school completed.\nComorbidity.--Comorbidity was assessed as the number\nof four health conditions (arthritis, diabetes, heart attack,\nand stroke) self-reported by participants at baseline.\nDepressive symptoms.--Depressive symptoms at baseline\nwere measured by the Center for Epidemiological Studies--\nDepression Scale (CES-D; Radloff, 1977). The CES-D\nincludes a total of 20 items measured on a 4-point scale\n(coded 0\u00ad3), assessing the presence (e.g., I felt sad) and\nabsence (e.g., I was happy) of specific depressive symptoms\nover the past week. Possible scores range from 0 to 60.\nEnglish language usage.--English language usage has\nbeen used previously as a measure of acculturation (Masel,\nRudkin, & Peek, 2006). This nine-item scale assessed self-\nreported competencies in understanding, speaking, and read-\ning English (each coded 0\u00ad3); frequency of English usage\nwith children, friends, neighbors, and at family gatherings\n(each coded 0\u00ad4); and use of television and radio programs\nin English (each coded 0\u00ad4). Possible scores range from 0 to\n33; greater scores indicate greater English usage at baseline.\nData Analysis\nTo estimate the rate of change over time in ADLs and\nIADLs and investigate possible nonlinearity of the curve,\nlatent growth models were used to estimate both linear and\nquadratic change over time. The linear growth model in-\ncluded an intercept and linear slope to represent, respec-\ntively, the average performance at Wave 1 and the average\nrate of linear change. In the quadratic model, an additional\nquadratic parameter was estimated to represent the average\nrate of quadratic change, sometimes described as the rate of\nacceleration or deceleration of the curve. All factor loadings\nfrom the intercept to the four observed data points were\nfixed to 1; for the linear slope factor, these paths were set to\n0, 2, 5, and 7, representing the number of years elapsed\nsince Wave 1. Factor loadings for the quadratic slope were\nset to 0, 4, 25, and 49. Thus, the mean linear and quadratic\nslopes are interpreted, respectively, as the average rates of\nlinear and quadratic change for 1 year. Because latent\ngrowth modeling was used, the assumption of equal mea-\nsurement errors was also able to be tested for both models\n(Willett & Sayer, 1994). Measurement error, loosely con-\nceptualized as the random variance between observed and\ntrue scores on a construct, is typically assumed to be inde-\npendent and homoscedastic (i.e., equal) over time. How-\never, as Sayer and Cumsille (2001) explain, observing\nheterogeneous error variances over time is typical in devel-\nopmental research because developmental changes in the\nconstruct under study are often accompanied by increases\nin variance in the construct over time.\nSeveral fit indices assessed model fit. In addition to the\nchi-square statistic, known to be overly sensitive with large\nsamples such as in the current study, three additional fit in-\ndices were also examined: the comparative fit index (CFI),\nthe Tucker\u00adLewis index (TLI), and the root mean square\nerror of approximation (RMSEA). Values of .95 or better on\nthe CFI and TLI and values of .05 or less on the RMSEA\nware (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL) (Arbuckle, 2007) was used\nto estimate the latent growth models; this program uses full\ninformation maximum likelihood estimation, which accom-\nmodates missing data.\nThe first step of the analysis estimated two unconditional\n(i.e., no-predictor) growth models for the total sample (i.e.,\nlinear and quadratic models) to investigate the form of the\ncurve and establish base rates of change in the total sample.\nNext, three multigroup models were estimated to allow pa-\nrameter estimates to be compared across the three HBP\ngroups (i.e., Baseline HBP, Later HBP, No HBP). The first\nmultigroup model allowed both the intercept and slope of\nthe three HBP groups to be freely estimated. This full model\nwas then compared, using a chi-square difference test, with\ntwo restricted models: (a) where intercepts were constrained\nto equality across the three HBP groups and (b) where slopes\nwere constrained to equality across the three HBP groups.\nThese comparisons tested, respectively, the hypothesis of\nHBP group differences in baseline ADL and IADL limita-\ntions and the hypothesis of HBP group differences in rate\nof change in ADLs and IADLs for the 7-year period cov-\nered by the Hispanic EPESE database. Finally, covariates\n(i.e., age, sex, education, baseline comorbidities, depressive\nsymptoms, and English language usage) were added to the\nmodels to investigate their influence on group differences in\nADL and IADL change and their relationship to baseline\nperformance and change over time in ADLs and IADLs.\nResults\nGrowth Models for ADL and IADL Limitations: Total\nSample\nUsing data from the total sample (N = 3,046), linear and\nquadratic growth models were first estimated for ADLs and\nIADLs to determine the appropriate form of the trajectories,\nassuming a homogeneous error structure.As shown in Table 3,\nboth models fit equally well; however, little benefit appeared to\nbe gained by increasing the complexity of the model to include\nthe quadratic term. For ADLs, mean quadratic growth was\nvery small though statistically significant (p = .025), and the\nvariance for the quadratic term could not be estimated and was\nset to 0. For IADLs, both the mean and variance for quadratic\nCaskie et al.\ntively). Thus, the linear model was used in further analyses.\nNext, the assumption of homogeneous error variances over\ntime was tested (Willett & Sayer, 1994) by comparing linear\nmodels with homogeneous (i.e., equal over time) and het-\neroscedastic (i.e., unequal over time) measurement error struc-\ntures. Parameter estimates and fit indices for both models are\nreported in Table 4. The equal error variances model was re-\njected in favor of the unequal error variances model for both\np < .001, indicating that the measurement error variance for\nthese measures was not constant across the four time points.\nFor both measures, the linear rate of change for the total\nsample was statistically significant and positive, although\nyear). These slopes equate to an average increase of almost\ntween the baseline and Wave 4 assessments. Thus, ADL\nlimitations were estimated to increase from a baseline aver-\nincrease from a baseline average of 1.53 to 2.58. Significant\ninterindividual variability was observed for ADL and IADL\noutcomes in both intercept (baseline value) and slope (lin-\near rate of change).\nGrowth Models for ADL and IADL Limitations: By HBP\nGroup\nGiven the significant variability in intercepts and slopes\nobserved for both ADLs and IADLs, multiple-group latent\ngrowth models were estimated to investigate HBP status\n(i.e., Baseline HBP, Later HBP, or No HBP) as a possible\nexplanation for this variability. To test for group differences\nat baseline, the unconstrained intercepts and slopes model\nwas compared with the constrained Intercepts Only model\nfor each of the two outcomes. The chi-square difference\ntests indicated significant baseline differences between the\ndifferences in the linear rate of change were examined by\ncomparing the unconstrained Intercepts and Slopes model\nTable 3.

Significant group differences in slopes were found\nthe unconstrained intercepts and slopes model for ADLs\nand the constrained slopes Only model for IADLs. The\nmodel fit statistics for the three models analyzed for ADLs\nand for IADLs are shown in Table 5, and the parameter\nestimates for the best-fitting unconditional models are\nshown in Table 6.\nFor all three HBP groups, significant increases for 7 years\n(i.e., slopes) were found for both ADL and IADL limita-\ntions, with significant between-group differences in these\nrates of change for ADLs only. The estimate of change in\nIADLs was identical to the finding in the total sample. For\nADLs, the Later HBP group had the largest slope, indicat-\ning the largest increase in ADL limitations after baseline,\nand the No HBP group had the lowest rate of change.\nFinally, baseline ADL and IADL limitations were not sig-\nnificantly correlated with ADL or IADL slope, except in the\nADL model for the group with hypertension at baseline\nControlling for Covariates of ADL and IADL Limitations\nIn the final models, demographic covariates (age, educa-\ntion, and sex), comorbidities, depressive symptoms, and\nEnglish language usage were added to the multiple-group\nlatent growth models. Controlling for these covariates, chi-\nsquare difference tests again indicated significant differ-\nences at baseline between the HBP groups for ADLs (p <\na significant difference (p = .043) was now found when\nIADL slopes were constrained across group. Follow-up\nmodel comparisons showed that the IADL slopes for Base-\nline HBP and Later HBP were significantly greater than the\nNo HBP group's slope. Estimates for the growth parameters\nfrom the conditional models are shown in Table 7.\nFor all three groups, age was significantly related to ADL\nlimitation at baseline (p < .001), IADL limitation at baseline\n.001). Greater age was related to more ADL and IADL lim-\nitations at baseline and greater rates of change over time.\nEducation was significantly related to changes in IADL\nlimitations (p = .013) only for Baseline HBP; less education\nwas related to greater rates of change in IADL limitations.\nSex was a significant predictor only of IADL impairment at\nbaseline (p = .03) for Baseline HBP; women had higher\nIADL limitations at baseline than men. The number of co-\nmorbidities was a significant predictor of ADL and IADL\nlimitations at baseline (p < .001 for Baseline HBP and No\nHBP; p = .003 for Later HBP), but was only significantly\nrelated to ADL slope in the Baseline HBP group (p = .003)\nand IADL slope in the No HBP group (p = .030). Greater\ncomorbidities at baseline were related to more baseline\nADL and IADL limitations; furthermore, for those with hy-\npertension at baseline, having more comorbid conditions\nwas related to a greater rate of increase in ADL limitations,\nand for those never reporting hypertension, to greater rate of\nincrease in IADL limitations. Greater depressive symptoms\n(p < .001) were related to greater ADL and IADL limita-\ntions at baseline for all groups and to less change over time in\nIADLs (p = .030) for the Later HBP group. Greater English\nlanguage usage was related to fewer ADL and IADL limita-\nslopes for the No HBP group (p = .048).\nDiscussion\nThe current study utilized latent growth curve modeling\nto examine changes in ADL/IADL limitations for a sample\nof Mexican American elders for a 7-year period as well as\nthe relation of hypertension status and other covariates to\nADL/IADL trajectories. Investigation of the potential ef-\nfects of hypertension status on performance of ADL/IADL\ntasks is particularly important as: (a) hypertension is a\nknown correlate of decline in functioning and negative out-\ncomes (e.g., physical disability, heart attack, stroke) and (b)\nHispanic elders, including Mexican Americans, demon-\nstrate an elevated risk for hypertension. This longitudinal\nanalysis adds to the limited research available documenting\nchanges in Mexican American elders' ADL/IADL limita-\ntions over time and examines predictors of ADL/IADL\nlimitations that are relevant to this ethnic group.\nAs hypothesized, the results of the present study indi-\ncated that significant increases in ADL and IADL limita-\ntions were experienced for the 7 years in which the research\nTable 6.

This finding is in agreement with the litera-\nture on this topic, which has shown that ADL/IADL limita-\ntions tend to increase over time in older adults (e.g., Liang\net al., 2008). More IADL limitations than ADL limitations\nwere observed, supporting previous findings by Spector and\ncolleagues (1987). Also consistent with expectations, dif-\nferences in the rate of increase in ADL/IADL limitations\nwere observed as a function of hypertension status. Indi-\nviduals without hypertension demonstrated lower increases\nover time in the number of ADL and IADL limitations than\nindividuals who met hypertensive criteria. This finding sug-\ngests that a hypertension diagnosis may lead to more rapid\ndeclines in the ability to perform ADLs in the older adult\nMexican American population. These results support previ-\nous research (e.g., Hajjar, Lackland, Cupples, & Lipsitz,\nviduals are more likely to experience difficulties perform-\ning ADLs/IADLs than are nonhypertensive individuals.\nExamination of the effects of covariates on ADL/IADL\ntrajectories revealed several findings. Consistent with prior\nresearch, greater age was related to more ADL and IADL\nlimitations at baseline and greater rates of change over time.\nLess education was related to greater IADL change for indi-\nviduals with hypertension at baseline. It is possible that the\ngreater cognitive demands of the IADL tasks (e.g., financial\nmanagement) combined with the physical toll of hyperten-\nsion may explain this increased rate of impairment for indi-\nviduals with less education.This group also had significantly\nhigher comorbidities at baseline than the other two groups,\nwhich may have contributed to their greater increases in\nIADL limitations. Women had higher IADL limitations at\nbaseline compared with men in the group with hypertension\nat baseline. Sex differences in IADLs may be explained by\ndifferences in socioeconomic status, division of labor, and\neducation between men and women, particularly when\ncomparing the current older adult cohort with younger\ncohorts (Liang et al., 2008). For all three groups, number\nof comorbidities (i.e., arthritis, diabetes, heart attack, and\nstroke) was a significant predictor of baseline ADL and\nIADL limitations. However, the relation of comorbid condi-\ntions to change in ADLs/IADLs was fairly limited; having\nmore comorbid conditions was significantly related only to\ngreater increases in ADL limitations for individuals report-\ning hypertension at baseline and to greater increases in\nIADL limitations for individuals never reporting hyperten-\nsion. The finding for the group with hypertension at base-\nline may reflect an additive effect of having multiple\nconditions, resulting in possible decreases in physical activ-\nity or polypharmacy. The group never reporting hyperten-\nsion experienced greater attrition at each wave than other\ngroups, which may have resulted in a healthier remaining\nsubsample who did not experience IADL declines until af-\nter baseline.\nIn summary, this study demonstrated significant increases\nin ADL and IADL limitations for a 7-year period. Greater\nincreases were observed for IADL limitations as opposed to\nADL limitations, although the amount differed based on\nwhen or if an individual met the criteria for hypertension.\nIndividuals who met these criteria showed higher rates of\nincrease in ADL and IADL limitations than those without\nhypertension, though for ADLs, these increases were\nsmaller for individuals meeting hypertensive criteria at en-\ntry into the study than for individuals meeting hypertensive\ncriteria during the study, when controlling for demographic,\nhealth, and psychological covariates. Thus, development of\nHBP appears to put individuals at risk for functional de-\ncline, but earlier diagnosis or treatment may be protective.\nHowever, we also found that having a greater number of\ncomorbid conditions (i.e., arthritis, diabetes, heart attack,\nand stroke) increased the rate of ADL limitations for indi-\nviduals with hypertension at entry to the study. In compari-\nson, increased comorbidities at baseline were related to\ngreater increases in IADL limitations for individuals not\nmeeting hypertensive criteria during the study.\nThe present study is limited in several ways. First, it is\nimportant to note that the current findings are specific to a\nMexican American population of older adults and should\nnot be generalized to all Hispanic individuals or other\nethnic groups. The second caveat relates to the accurate as-\nsessment of hypertension, which is a critical issue, particu-\nlarly among this population. Of those Mexican Americans\nwith hypertension, up to half may be unaware that they have\nthis health condition (Glover, Greenlund, Ayala, & Croft,\nWang, 2004) and, even among those aware of having hyper-\ntension, some individuals may not respond accurately to\nself-report health measures, such as those utilized in this\nstudy (Bush, Miller, Golden, & Hale, 1989). A strength of\nthe current study is the inclusion of both subjective (i.e.,\nself-reported diagnosis and medications) and objective (i.e.,\nactual blood pressure readings) indicators of hypertension;\nhowever, a physician's diagnosis was not available. A third\nissue is that hypertension control was not examined directly\nin our analyses. Some research indicates that the use of anti-\nhypertensive medications can help to prevent or delay subse-\nquent ADL/IADL limitations in older adults (e.g., Elias &\nadults have been shown to be less likely to achieve control of\ntheir condition compared with other groups, often due to\nlower antihypertensive medication use (Sudano & Baker,\n2001; Wang & Wang). Sudano and Baker speculated that\nHispanics' lower antihypertensive medications use may be\nrelated to limited English proficiency, influencing the level\nof care they receive and their understanding of physician\nrecommendations. This sample's English proficiency was\nrelatively limited, which may have influenced their level of\nhypertension control. Finally, we did not have a direct mea-\nsure of physical activity, but examined acculturation as a\ncorrelate of physical activity (Cantero et al., 1999; Evenson\nshould include variables that assess antihypertension medi-\ncation use as well as other methods of hypertension control\n(e.g., lifestyle change) in Hispanic older adults. Other\nmeasures that would also be beneficial to include in future\nstudies include a direct measure of physical activity and\nexamination of medical records to determine objectively the\nlength of time for which individuals entering the study with\ndiagnosed hypertension may have had this health condition.\nThis study contributes to the existing body of literature\nby examining the relationship between hypertension and\nADLs over time in an understudied ethnic minority older\nadult population. The demonstrated increases over time in\nADL and IADL limitations for Mexican Americans are\nimportant for public health and social service agencies as\nwell as researchers to consider in light of the growing\nnumbers of older Mexican Americans, whose increased\nneeds for assistance with ADLs as a consequence of hy-\npertension would likely increase demands not only on\npublic resources but also their kin networks (Angel & An-\ngel, 1998). Over-reliance by Hispanic elders on social sup-\nport networks could lead to increased psychological\ndistress and decreased quality of life for the elders (Cruza-\nGuet, Spokane, Caskie, Szapocznik, & Brown, 2008).\nAdditional research is needed to compare various ethnic\nminority groups of older adults with hypertension and the\nsubsequent rates of change in ADL and IADL limitations\nthat they experience over time to better understand health\ndisparities of these groups. Such a study could also com-\npare socioeconomic status and its relationship with func-\ntional decline over time (e.g., Kington & Smith, 1997).\nFuture research in this area may also explore additional\npsychological variables, such as social support, which\nmay influence the relationship between hypertension and\nchanges in ADLs and IADLs over time.\nCorrespondence\nAddress correspondence to Grace I.
