In the United States about 29%\nof adults have hypertension.1,2 Hypertension constitutes a signif-\nicant attributable cause of coronary heart disease, heart failure,\nstroke, renal disease, and glaucoma.1,3,4 Due to loss of human\nlife and high cost of the management and treatment of hyper-\ntension, and its complications, many recommendations have\nbeen forwarded to help prevent it.5\u00ad7 Notable among these rec-\nommendations is a reduction in dietary sodium (salt) intake.5,6,8\nThis recommendation is warranted because excessive sodium\nconsumption has been associated with hypertension and fluid\nretention.5,8\u00ad10 In the United States, about 75% of the sodium in\nthe diet comes from salt (NaCl) added by food manufacturers\nrecommended intake.5\nRestriction of dietary salt consumption as a treatment\noption for hypertension could mean a significant curtailing\nof iodine intake and hence risk of iodine deficiency. Iodized\nsalt contains small but substantial amount of the essential\nmineral iodine. In the human body, iodine is required for the\nproduction of \nthyroid hormones notably, thyroxine (T4\n) and\ntriiodothyronine (T3\n), which are required for the regulation\nof various physiological processes including growth, neuro-\nlogical development, body weight, temperature, and rate of\noxidation in cells. Regular consumption of iodized salt is an\neffective prophylaxis against iodine deficiency.11,12 Iodine defi-\nciency causes deficiency of the thyroid hormones which sub-\nsequently results in iodine deficiency disorders (IDD), a major\npublic health problem in many countries.13 Of great concern\namong the IDD are developmental failure, mental retardation,\nneurological damage, dwarfism, hearing loss, and decreased\nintelligence quotient in children.13\u00ad15 In adults, IDD results\nin hypothyroidism, infertility, thyroid cancer, goiter, poor\n\ncognition, lethargy, and decreased labor productivity.13\u00ad16\nIn the United States, iodized salt was introduced all over the\nand voluntary salt iodization was embraced thereafter.\nHitherto, IDD were a major health problem.

The blood pressure and\nwaves of the United States National Health and Nutrition\nstudy. The NHANES is an ongoing population-based survey,\nconducted by the National Center for Health Statistics of the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, to monitor and\nassess the health status of the noninstitutionalized United\na stratified, multistage probability cluster sampling method\nand include interviews, physical examination, and laboratory\ntests of participants from representative households. In 1999,\nNHANES was converted from a static survey to a continuous\nannual survey.20 Data collected over successive 2-year intervals\nare periodically released for public use. The NHANES survey\ndata are released together with analytical guides, related notes,\nand analytical survey weights to ensure unbiased estimation of\npopulation averages.21\nData from participants in the blood pressure and iodine\ntion center (MEC) were matched into a combined dataset. In\nof the noninstitutionalized United States civilian population\nprovided data on urinary iodine.22 The final sample for this\nstudy comprised participants who had characteristics compa-\nrable to the general NHANES population. Inclusion criteria\nwere: ages 20\u00ad60 years, nonpregnant, and had complete blood\n\npressure, urinary iodine, and gender information. Participants\naged 20\u00ad60 years were included to avoid the complex influ-\nence of age on blood pressure and glomerular filtration.23\nincluded only those 20 years and over. The final combined\nSociodemographic information: age, gender, income, eth-\nnicity, and education, were obtained from the NHANES\ndemographic questionnaire data files.19 Physical activity infor-\nmation was obtained from the physical activity and physical\nfitness data files whereas body weight and body mass index\n(BMI) data were from the MEC body measures data files.19\nUrinary creatinine and albumin information were obtained\nThe Ethics Review Board of the National Center for Health\nStatistics approved the survey procedures and informed con-\nsent was obtained from all participants.19 The procedures for\nthis study were approved locally by the Institutional Review\nBoard, Office of Research and Sponsored Programs, Central\nMichigan University.\nIdentification of hypertension and measurement of blood\npressure. Participants were categorized as hypertensive if they\nhad a mean systolic blood pressure of 140mm Hg or diastolic\nblood pressure of 90mm Hg or affirmed current use of anti-\nhypertension medication.1,24,25 They had history of hyperten-\nsion if they had ever been told by a health professional that\nthey had hypertension but were not hypertensive at the time\nof examination.26 In the NHANES, blood pressure was meas-\nured manually by a trained technician using a mercury sphyg-\nmomanometer by following a standard protocol.4,26 Repeated\nmeasurements were done and acceptable values were averaged\nand recorded.4,26 In this study, the first blood pressure read-\ning was discarded and the second and third blood pressure\nreadings were used, because the first reading was consistently\nhigher than the second and the third, which were closer. The\nblood pressure measurement protocols were identical for the\nIdentification of dietary salt restriction. The NHANES 2001\u00ad\n2004 blood pressure questionnaire contained questions related\nto dietary salt restriction: \"told to reduce sodium for hyperten-\nsion?,\" \"now reducing sodium/salt?\" whereas the dietary inter-\nview questionnaire included current use of salt substitute, and\nsalt use in cooking or at the table.\" Participants who affirmed\nthe \"told to reduce sodium for hypertension?,\" \"now reducing\nsodium/salt?,\" were using salt substitute, and did not use salt\nin cooking or at the table,\" inclusively, satisfied the criteria for\ndietary salt restriction.26\nDietary sodium intake. To enhance the validity and to buttress\nthe salt restriction questions, dietary sodium intake was assessed\nin relation to hypertension conditions and dietary salt restric-\ntion. Data on dietary sodium intake were obtained from the\nby a multiple-pass in-person 24-h dietary recall \nthis study, dietary sodium intake was dichotomized as: mod-\nNational Committee's guidelines for sodium intake.5,25\nDetermining urinary iodine concentration and iodine nutri-\nfiles contained urinary iodine concentration (UIC) data.27\nIodine nutritional status was determined using urinary iodine\ncutoffs defined by the World Health Organization and used by\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention.28,29 Three catego-\nries were defined as follows: iodine deficient, UIC <100g/l;\noriginal contributions\nHypertension, Salt Restriction, and Iodine Deficiency\nDuring the NHANES, spot urine samples were used for the\nassessment of iodine nutritional status. Determination of UIC\nwas done by means of an Inductively Coupled Plasma Dynamic\nReaction Cell Mass Spectroscopy. The laboratory method used\nfor the determination of UIC is publicly available.22,26\nStatistical analysis and confounding variable. To account for\nMEC complex probability sampling design and to apply MEC\nsampling weights, STATA 10.0 (STATA, College Station, TX)\nwas used to estimate all descriptive and inferential statistics.20\nThe SAS 9.1.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) statistical software\nwas used for data organization. In all analyses, the NHANES\nwere halved and applied.21,30 We initially performed gender-\nstratified descriptive comparisons of proportions that were\niodine deficient, had high iodine level or had moderate \ndietary\nsodium intake for participants who satisfied the following\nexposure variables: (i) had history of hypertension but was not\nhypertensive at the time of examination; (ii) had clinical hyper-\ntension at the time of examination; (iii) was restricting dietary\nsalt intake. The referent groups were participants who had no\nhistory of hypertension, were normotensive, not restricting die-\ntary salt, respectively. Multiple regression models were used to\nestimate mean UIC and dietary sodium intake whereas logistic\nregression models were used to estimate adjusted odds ratios\nfor iodine deficiency, high iodine status, and moderate dietary\nsodium intake (sodium intake 2,400mg/day) for the expo-\nsure variables 1\u00ad3 above. The referent group for the \nmoderate\nsodium intake was those who had high sodium intake (sodium\nintake >2,400mg/day). Significant differences among the con-\ntinuous variables in the background data were tested using\nthe overall F-test. Significant differences in the mean UIC and\ndietary sodium intake within the hypertension and salt restric-\ntion categories were tested using a t-test. For \ncategorical data,\nPearson's 2-test of independence with Rao and Scott correc-\ntion was used to test for significant differences.31,32 To improve\nestimator reliability, we controlled for age, body mass index,\neducation, income, physical activity, and ethnicity in all the\nregression analyses. While a large and a small frame person\ncan have the same BMI, they are not likely to consume the\nsame quantity of food and therefore sodium. Therefore, dietary\nsodium intakes were adjusted for body weight whereas all other\nestimations were adjusted for BMI instead. Dietary sodium,\nurinary albumin, urinary creatinine, and urinary iodine data\nwere log-transformed to achieve normality. Renal differences\nwere corrected using urinary creatinine and urinary albumin\nconcentrations. Controlling for urinary creatinine levels helped\nto correct for differences in hydration state such as dehydration\nor polyuria. Renal disease was corrected using urinary albumin\nand creatinine concentrations. Abnormal \nurinary albumin and\ncreatinine concentrations are indicative of renal disease.24,33,34\nDue to small sample sizes for some ethnic groups, they were\ncollapsed into three categories: black (non-Hispanic), Mexican-\nAmerican and other Hispanics, and white (non-Hispanic). The\nwhite (non-Hispanic) category included other white ethnicity.\nEducation was collapsed into three \nlevels: less than high school\ndegree, high school degree, and above high school degree.\nPhysical activity was self-reported as less than average, same\nas average, and greater than the average American. Although\nphysical activity was self-reported, it has been found reliable\nin many studies.35,36 The referent groups for the categorical\nconfounding variables were high school degree, average physi-\ncal activity level, and white (non-Hispanic). All categorical\nconfounding variables were examined as indicator variables.\nIncome was examined as a continuous variable in the form of\npoverty income ratio, a ratio of the federal poverty threshold\nprovided by the Bureau of Census. Age, body weight, BMI,\nurinary \ncreatinine, and urinary albumin concentrations were\n\nexamined as continuous variables. In all analyses, statistical sig-\nnificance was tested at P < 0.05.\nResults\nSample characteristics\nThe characteristics of the participants are presented in Table 1.\nhad hypertension. Of these, 15.5% of the men and 15.6% of the\nwomen were taking blood pressure medication. Dietary salt\nrestriction was reported by 13.6% of the men and 12.8% of the\nwomen.

On the whole, 26.1% of the men restricting dietary\nsalt intake had moderate sodium intake (sodium 2,400mg/\nday), \ncompared to 24.9% for men not restricting salt intake.\nHowever, 41.3% of the women restricting dietary salt intake\nhad moderate sodium intake (sodium 2,400mg/day), com-\npared to 28.9% of the women not restricting salt intake.

It is worth mentioning however, that a\nsubstantial percentage of women restricting dietary salt were\niodine deficient, 47.7%, compared with women not restrict-\ning dietary salt, 39.4%, (Table 2). The adjusted mean dietary\nsodium intake and UIC of participants by hypertension cat-\negories are shown in Table 3. In men and women, current\nhypertension or having a history of hypertension did not asso-\nciate with statistically significant differences in dietary sodium\nintake and UIC, compared with those without history of or\nwho have current hypertension, respectively.\nTable 4 shows the adjusted mean dietary sodium intake and\nUIC of participants by salt restriction status. In both men and\nwomen, dietary salt restriction did not associate with statisti-\ncally significant decreases in the adjusted mean dietary sodium\nintakes. Among men, dietary salt restriction did not associate\noriginal contributions Hypertension, Salt Restriction, and Iodine Deficiency\nwith a statistically significant decrease in the adjusted mean\nUIC compared with men not restricting dietary salt intake.\nHowever, among women, dietary salt restriction associated\nwith a statistically significant decrease in the adjusted mean\nUIC compared with women not restricting dietary salt intake\n(Table 4).\nResults of the logistic regression analysis, which \ncontrolled\nfor confounders, indicated that, in both men and women,\ncurrent hypertension or having a history of hypertension\nwas not significantly associated with likelihood of iodine\ndeficiency, high iodine status, or moderate sodium intake,\ncompared with those without current or history of hyperten-\nsion (Table 3). Among men, salt restriction did not associate\n\nsignificantly with likelihood of iodine deficiency, high iodine\nstatus, or \nmoderate sodium intake compared with men not\n\nrestricting dietary salt intake (Table 4). However, women who\nwere restricting dietary salt were more likely to have moderate\nsodium intake, P = 0.02, have lower adjusted mean UIC, P =\n0.01, and be iodine deficient, P = 0.03, compared with women\nnot restricting dietary salt intake (Table 4).\nDiscussion\nSignificant findings\nCurrent hypertension per se or having a history of hyperten-\nsion did not associate significantly with iodine nutritional\nstatus in both men and women.

The high prevalence of iodine deficiency among adults\nhas serious health repercussions because the outcome of iodine\ndeficiency is IDD.13\u00ad16 Literature on studies that link dietary salt\nrestriction to iodine nutritional status is scarce. One study in\nPoland reported a decrease in UIC among \npersons consuming\nlimited amount of iodized salt as well as among hypertension\npatients.37 In the present study, we provide evidence that the\nassociation between salt restriction and iodine deficiency may\nbe true for women but may not be for men in this population.\nWe observed that women tended to have lower UIC than men\n(Table 3), implying that salt restriction among women could\nhave greater overall effect on the already lower iodine levels. It\nis possible that the different associations observed for men and\nwomen may be due to differences in absolute levels of iodine.\nIt is thus likely that dietary salt restriction may associate with\niodine deficiency in persons with limited iodine intake irre-\nspective of gender. A recent study has ingeminated the possible\ndifficulties in maintaining essential mineral balance, including\niodine, while cutting salt to achieve sodium balance in hyper-\ntensives.38 This is partly because salt is a source of essential\nminerals such as iodine, iron, zinc, and manganese.13,14 Thus\ncutting salt to achieve sodium balance may mean an indirect\ncurtailing of the intake of such minerals.\nIn men, dietary salt restriction did not associate with mod-\nerate dietary sodium intake (sodium intake 2,400mg/\nday).\nIn women, however, dietary salt restriction associated with\n\nmoderate dietary sodium intake. Even though salt restric-\ntion did not show a statistically significant decrease in die-\ntary sodium intake in men, it was limiting enough in women\nto influence iodine nutritional status. It is likely that those\nrestricting salt may have more control on salt used at home,\nmost of which is iodized,11,39 than the mostly uniodized\n\"\nhidden\" salt used in processed foods and restaurants.40\nBetween 50 and 70% of the US population choose iodize salt\nfor domestic use.11,39 On the average, iodized salt contributes\nabout 50g iodine/day11 which is substantial considering the\nfact that good dietary sources of iodine are few. Despite the\npresence of iodine absorption inhibitors, goitrogens and other\nantithyroid factors in some plant foods, persons with limited\nsalt and thus iodine intake may obtain some iodine from root\nand leafy vegetables grown on iodine-rich soils, and sea foods\nlike sea fish and kelp (seaweed) from uncontaminated sources.\nDairy products from animals nurtured on iodine-rich feed\nsupplements could also be good sources of iodine.\nStrengths and limitations\nThis is the first study that looks at the association between\n\ndietary salt restriction and iodine deficiency in the United\nStates in an era in which the prevalence of overweight and\nobesity has increased with an attendant increase in the preva-\nlence of hypertension. In this study, participants were sampled\nfrom all over the United States and were representative of the\nUS civilian population. Other strengths are that many possi-\nble confounding variables were controlled in this analysis, and\nthat the analysis was gender stratified.\nThe limitations of the study include the fact that some cell\nsizes were small during the analysis.
