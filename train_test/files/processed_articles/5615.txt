Our article aims to contribute to this research area by focusing on how adolescents' narration of\ntheir schooling frames their life planning. In particular, we explore a major finding of our research--namely, their defending\nof vocational training--by means of the notion of ambivalent biographical identity. We argue (a) that today's adolescents do\nnot openly reject vocational training, and they try to transform the unofficial skills and knowledge obtained in their cultures\ninto official cultural capital capable of making them enter the job market and (b) that their life planning is tied up with a\nbiographical identity formation through which they try to coherently reconcile their embodied cultures with the vocational\nqualifications they aspire to acquire.\n",

They could cultivate anti-school val-\nues and create oppositional cultures within which they could\naccrue social capital and forge a respectable adolescent iden-\ntity simply because opportunity structures in the old days\ncould assure them a safe and stable passage into working-\nDespite the fact that they had to face educational exclusion\nand disrespect in their teen years, working-class adolescents'\nidentities were protected against this social exclusion due to\nthe power of their resistant culture and to the fact that they\ncould safely plan their transition into manual jobs (Clarke,\nIn the last 30 years, youth sociology researchers tend to\nsubscribe a kind of paradigm shift regarding identity forma-\ntion of working-class adolescents. Radical transformations in\nthe job market are so overwhelming for working-class youth\nthat direct transition into traditional manual jobs has been\nmade an unattainable dream. Stemming from what has been\ncalled \"risk-individualization thesis,\" the dominant argu-\nment that youth scholars seem to subscribe holds that, even\nif social inequalities remain intact and pervasive as in the old\ndays, working-class adolescents are forced to reflect upon\ntheir post high school options in individual terms and to\nbecome the authors of their narratives all by themselves,\nwithout resorting to class ties or to oppositional cultures\nIn the remaining of the article, we aim at forging an argu-\nment on how vocational adolescents of our days shape their\nself-narratives and take decisions on their life transitions by\nfocusing on the interplay of social class and biographical\ncontexts within which these decisions are made. Two basic\nassumptions frame our line of reasoning. First, how adoles-\ncents reconstruct their biographical life events is not struc-\nturally determined, but it is something that takes place in\nspecific life-world contexts which have to be thoroughly\n1University of Patras, Greece\nCorresponding Author:\nPandelis Kiprianos, University of Patras, Lemesou 29, Patras,\nEmail: Kiprian@upatras.gr\nAmbivalent Biographies in Adolescence:\nWhat Vocational Students Think and Feel\nAbout Their Schooling\nPandelis Kiprianos1 and Michael Christodoulou1\n Keywords\nadolescence, embodiment, history and sociology of education, narrative identity, vocabularies of motives, vocational schooling\n2 SAGE Open\nanalyzed should one wish to understand when and to what\nextent agency or structure prevails in his or her life transi-\ntions, and second, how they narrate their turning points and\nconstruct their biographical identities seems to be a crucial\nfactor regarding the framing of their life decisions.\nLiterature Review and Research\nQuestions\nResearch on how self-formation of working-class adoles-\ncents affects their life transitions shows that in our days, they\nare exposed to an array of vocational and training options\nwhich make them be more reflective about their post-second-\nary routes. However, it is a kind of reflexivity of which the\ndynamic is extremely forged by and through social forces.\nResearch conclusions could be summed up as following: (a)\ndecision making should not be seen as grounded on a rational\nplanning but on what is called pragmatistic rationality, mean-\ning that it is not the psychological or developmental tasks\nthat guide adolescents' decisions but it is the context-spe-\ncific, practical and partial character of their everyday life that\nshapes the criteria for their post-secondary transitions\n(Hodkinson & Sparkes, 1997; Hodkinson, Sparkes, &\ncents' agency is bounded by the restricted cultural capital of\ntheir parents who are not able to contribute to their planning\nand by the limited opportunity structure that the local job\nmarkets offer them and which tie them up with their geo-\nSoutherton, 2002); (c) they are more prone to trust not the\nofficial or \"cold\" knowledge of school authorities but the\ninformal and \"hot\" knowledge of their social networks (Ball\nLeonard, 2005); and (d) working-class origin of adolescents\nshould not be seen as an independent variable that deter-\nmines life transition but that it is the decisive role of school-\ning experiences that mediates their job aspirations (Ball,\nDespite its contribution to how vocational adolescents\nmake decisions regarding their job careers, the above-men-\ntioned research presents some gaps, which we believe\ndeserve thorough discussion. First of all, in some cases,\nexplanations seem to resort to a kind of habitus determinism,\nas it is either negative schooling experiences which make\nvocational adolescents have poor job aspirations (Sletten,\n2011) or parents' poor emotional capital which makes them\nbelieve in interpersonal information regarding their job\noptions (Foskett & Hemsley-Brown, 1999; West & Ribbens,\n1994). Second, despite the fact that vocational adolescents\nare called to become the authors of their narratives due to the\nmultiple and risky options they face, proponents of \"risk-\nindividualization\" thesis do not provide us with a clear theo-\nretical proposition which could frame the end product of this\nself-narration. In other words, we are told half of the story--\nnot how it ends in theoretical terms (Foskett & Hesketh,\n1997). Finally, there is a tendency to approach vocational\nadolescents'life decisions in disembodied terms, that is, as if\ntheir decision making is a discursive matter disconnected\nfrom their system of relevance (Francis, 1999b).\nOur research comes to deal with these gaps by focusing\non the cognitive, emotional, and embodied dimensions which\nframe working-class adolescents life planning and on how\nidentity formation process is tied up with their schooling\nexperiences and with their post-secondary routes. In particu-\nlar, we are going to explore (a) the evaluations and represen-\ntations these pupils hold in relation to their choice to pursue\nvocational schooling, (b) the vocabulary of motives (Mills,\n1940) they use for constructing (and construing) their sense\nof self and others, and (c) the ways the above two parameters\nare inscribed in their life-world conditions and give shape to\ntheir post-secondary ambitions.\nTheoretical Underpinnings of the\nResearch\nIn framing the above questions, we adopted two core ideas\nfrom Bourdieu's theory of habitus and from research on nar-\nrative identity. According to Bourdieu and some commenta-\nshaped through one's involvement into what his or her life-\nworld considers as valuable and practically relevant. Social\ninteraction and familiarization of the actor with the classifi-\ncations and typifications of the group within which he or she\ngrows up are the reasons why he or she comes to see some\nlife options as self-evident and others as unthinkable.\nActions are put in motion by means of actor's embodied\nhabituation with what his or her social situation enables him\nAlthough habitus can effectively tap the taken-for-grant-\nedness of actor's everyday life and the social grounding of\nhis or her orientations, biographical identity is a term used to\ncapture the narrative ways he or she implements to meaning-\nfully analyze how his or her past life-world experiences are\nconnected with present self-conceptions (Bruner, 1991;\nthrough narratives that actors cohere biographical life events\nbut also they claim an identity related to how they became\nwhat they are and to how they want to be conceived by others\n(Spector-Mersel, 2011). Actors, by looking back at what they\nhave been through and looking forward to what they aspire\nto be, produce narratives through which they can coherently\ncope with their psychologically painful life experiences by\ndrawing upon the stock of knowledge of the social worlds of\nwhich these narratives are a part of (Fischer-Rosenthal, 2000;\nKiprianos and Christodoulou 3\nMethodological Considerations\nSampling Choices\nOur sample strategy was designed according to the logic of\n\"maximum variation purposeful sampling\" (Miles &\nHuberman, 1994), that is, we recruited vocational adolescents\ntaking into account, besides social class origin, the location of\nthe school and the social attributes of adolescents' neighbor-\nhood so as to compare data drawn from vocational adolescents\nwho have different socializing experiences. The goal of our\nresearch design was twofold. In particular, we wanted to pres-\nent a quantitative picture of how vocational adolescents evalu-\nate their option to enroll in vocational school after the\ncompletion of junior high school. In addition, we aimed at dig-\nging into how local knowledge of vocational adolescents' life-\nworld shapes the subjective orientations regarding their\npost-secondary ambitions. To reach these goals, we imple-\nmented two research instruments, questionnaire and inter-\nviews. The questionnaire enabled us to get a complete picture\non an aggregate level both of how vocational adolescents value\ntheir schooling and of the socio-demographic composition of\nvocational schools. Interviews were used to get deeper under-\nstanding of the social micro-process through which vocational\nadolescents make sense of themselves and on how this cultural\ngrounding of their self-construction affects their post-second-\nary life decisions. Thus, as a consequence of the above-men-\ntioned sample strategy, we delivered questionnaires to 145\neighteen-year-old adolescents attending their last year in three\nvocational schools in a big city of Western Greece. Schools are\nlocated in different areas (one in the center of the city, one in\nsuburban location, and one in a working-class area), and we\ncarried out 50 narrative interviews with 22 girls and 28 boys\nof the same sample. All the names we present are fictional.\nData Collection\nGiven the qualitative orientation of the research, the main\ndata collection research technique was what Wengraf (2001)\nand relevant scholars term biographical-narrative interview.\nAccording to this way of conducting interviews, the aim is to\ntap the meaningful thematic fields of the actor that support\nhis or her narrative renderings and how these fields are cor-\nrelated to the life-world relevancies upon which they draw.\nPriority is given to make informants use accounts containing\nnarratives imbued by personal experiences and not to talk\nsolely in an argumentative or descriptive manner about social\n1995). Given that not all adolescents are in a position to pro-\nduce extempore narratives (McLean, Pasupathi, & Pals,\n2007), we made up an interview guide which we divided into\nfour discussion axis related to (a) their schooling experiences,\n(b) their family habitus, (c) their leisure activities, and (d) to\nwhat C. Taylor (1988) has called \"strong evaluations\"\n(p. 310), that is, the moral boundaries that make up their value\norientations. Some of the interview questions we included in\neach of these axis were the following: what were your expe-\nriences from high school all these years? What are you plan-\nning to do after high school? What are your parents' dreams\nof you? How was it for you to grow up in this neighborhood?\nHow do you spend your free time? What things or experi-\nences are you proud of? How do you imagine yourself in 5\nyears' time?\nIt should be noted that according to this type of interview-\ning, what interviewees say is not to be taken to represent\ndirectly the outer world. The interviewer does not aim at dis-\ncovering whether what informants talk about corresponds to\nwhat is happening outside the interview context. Instead, by\ntreating what informant say as accounts, we tried to investi-\ngate the sense-making work through which participants\nengage in explaining, attributing, justifying, describing, and\notherwise finding possible sense or orderliness in the various\nevents, people, places, and courses of action they talk about\nIn parallel with narrative interviews, we delivered ques-\ntionnaires to adolescents aimed at highlighting, in quantita-\ntive terms, the reasons they give for attending vocational\nschool, the level of satisfaction they experience from this\ntype of school, and the job they aspire to obtain. The reason\nwhy we used questionnaires was that we wanted to bring to\nthe fore possible connections between their answers in the\nquestionnaire and the thematic fields we tapped from their\nnarrative accounts. In combining data obtained from ques-\ntionnaire and interviews, we aimed not at validating our find-\nings but mostly at providing complementary points of view\nof the same phenomenon, namely, the role of self-formation\non how vocational adolescents take life decisions (for a simi-\nlar usage of combining interviews and questionnaire on life\nData Analysis\nIn analyzing our interview data, we emphasized the Glaserian\nversion of the Grounded Theory (Charmaz, 2002; Glaser,\nSpector-Mersel, 2011). In particular, we implemented a four-\nstep process in dealing with the transcripted interviews: (a) we\nsketched the portraits for each of the informants so as to tap\nthe sequential order of their biographical life events, (b) we\ncoded in vivo their accounts from the above-mentioned dis-\ncussion axis and we wrote down in diagrammatic form the\nsum of categories that emerged from each participant so as to\nobtain an overall view of these categories, (c) we compared\nthe categories and we tried to bring to the fore the informants'\nmain concern (or core category) which permeated the thematic\nfield, and (d) in a more conceptual refining, we highlighted\nhow their main concerns were related to the identities they\nclaimed as they were articulated by means of the strong eval-\n4 SAGE Open\nuations regarding who they are and how they want to be per-\nceived by others.\nIssues of Trustworthiness of the Research\nReliability and validity are issues which are dealt with in dif-\nferent terms in qualitative research in comparison with tradi-\ntional quantitative approaches, simply because of the\nintentional character of social action (Healy & Perry, 2000;\nthat qualitative researchers remain blind to such issues.\nHaving as an epistemological point of departure conceptions\nof social world stemming from critical realism (Bhaskar,\nto the question how sure can one be as to the truth of what\ninformants say in the interviews. We have no reason to\nbelieve that adolescents of the study intend to lie in the inter-\nview or that they come to participate in it with an intention to\ndeceive the interviewer. Quite the contrary, in treating what\nthey say as accounts, what we aspire to understand is adoles-\ncents' point of view on how they narrate their past, present,\nand future lives and the version of the world they construct,\ngiven the structural frames that exist in their lives (on narra-\ntive interviews validity, see Elliot, 2006). Our goal was to\nunderstand why adolescents produced these specific narra-\ntive versions of the world and not others. In addition, it has\nbeen shown that the more one commits himself or herself in\nnarrating his or her life, the more close the content of his or\nher narration is in what \"actually happened.\" Finally, we\nchecked what adolescents were saying by prompting them to\ngive accounts of the same experience (e.g., leisure time prac-\ntices) in various narrative moments of the interview.\nWith regard to whether the conclusions we have reached\nare accidentally produced, we tried to triangulate our data in\nthe following way: (a) data obtained from the questionnaire\nwere in the same direction with what adolescents talked\nabout in the interviews, namely, that they defend and posi-\ntively value vocational schools, (b) we collected life stories\nfrom adolescents who reside in different geographical loca-\ntions, and we saw that it does not affect their stance against\nvocational schools, and (c) due to the differentiated sampling\nof our data, we were able to compare responses of adoles-\ncents who have opted for various vocational specialties (e.g.,\nhairdressers, car mechanics, or cooks). It was through this\nthreefold crosschecking process that we were able to be more\nconfident with regard to why vocational adolescents defend\ntheir option to pursue vocational training. According to this\nline of methodological reasoning, how theory is implemented\nin data processing affects our knowledge claims as far as\ngeneralizability is concerned. In our research, habitus theory\nand narrative identity approach were implemented neither to\nprovide us with deductively produced hypotheses which\nwere going to be tested against our findings nor as a means\nfor operationalizing central terms of the research. By con-\ntrast, these theories were used as sensitized concepts through\nwhich we were able to put questions to our data, to order\nthem, and to transform the emic words of the informants into\nan epic argument the researcher sets up (for reasons of clar-\nity, we provide Tables 1 and 2 containing the in vivo catego-\nries and the main themes of the interview data. Habitus\ntheory and biographical identity enabled us to transform\nthese themes into theoretical argument.). Hence, what we\nclaim is not generalizability assured by statistical procedures\nrelated to individuals who present the same socio-demo-\ngraphic variables, but a theoretical proposition containing\nconcepts which could explain processes that take place\nwithin contexts similar to our own and could provide us with\ninterpretations as to how vocational adolescents' habitus for-\nmation sets in motion specific biographical planning and\nTable 1.

In contrast to their\naspirations, however, the results of this initiative were poor,\nfor until the early 1960s; the number of children in technical\njunior high schools and high schools did not exceed 10% of\nthe total number of children of this age group (15-18). Thanks\nto the admonitions of International organizations, particularly\nthe Organization for Co-operation and Development (OCDE)\nand the World Bank; the percentage of children attending sec-\nondary technical schools would reach 25% of the above-\nmentioned age group during the mid-1970s.

A total of 73.5% of students\nanswered \"good\" and \"very good,\" while 26.5% were not so\nsatisfied with their experience.\nThe reasons for their attendance was the second question\nwe posed, and the answers we provided were (a) \"because\nattendance in TS is easier,\" (b) \"because my attendance in\nvocational school helps me to accomplish my professional\ngoals,\" (c) \"because I could not cope with general high\nschool,\" (d) \"because my friends are in vocational school,\"\nand (e) \"because of other reasons.\" In comparison with the\nTable 2.

This is further related to the answers\nthey gave to the next three questions. The fourth and the fifth\nquestion asked students to evaluate the career prospects of\ntheir friends attending general high schools, while the sixth\nasked if they thought that vocational school provided them\nwith the skills needed for their professional career. Sixty-five\npercent of vocational students believe that children attending\nGeneral high school will find themselves in a worse position\nin comparison with themselves in regard to their career suc-\ncess, and that better professional prospects awaited children\nof technical high school (75%), providing them with the nec-\nessary skills to do so (87%).\nAll in all, our findings conclude that students of technical-\nvocational education generally consider themselves satisfied\nwith their studies. They posit as a key motivation or reason\nfor their choice, their professional prospects, and they place\nthemselves in a privileged position compared with general\nhigh school graduates. When asked to identify the profession\nthey want to practice in the future, they referred to the pro-\nfessions of car mechanic (19.6%), refrigerant technician\ngave no answer as they were undecided.\nThe high percentage of those who gave no answer should\nnot be explained simply in terms of class culture but also in\nrelation to the extent in which the interaction networks of\nthese students are capable of providing them with enough\nsocial capital to invest in working-class jobs or in related\nprospects. From the analyses of the questionnaires, it could\nbe argued that vocational students' views on how they\nface their career prospects are permeated by the following\ncharacteristics:\nA. They consider themselves as being satisfied with their\nattendance, and they present as a basic motivation for\ntheir choice, the help technical education offers them\nin finding employment in post-adolescent years.\nB. This incentive seems to give them reasons to construct\nnarratives of themselves within which they represent\ntheir identities as superior in comparison with the stu-\ndents of general high school, believing that the latter\nwill find themselves at a later disadvantage in the job\nmarket.\nIf we stick to the last two findings, one could approach\nthem via the rational-choice model: Pupils invest in school\nafter having calculated the costs and the likely profits of their\nefforts, meaning that children from poor backgrounds do not\ninvest in school as much as pupils attending general high\nschools because the benefits related to them are not worth\npursuing. This consideration, however, cannot explain a key\nfinding of the questionnaires, that is, the contrast observed\nbetween the effort to support their choice to attend voca-\ntional school and the fact that one out of three pupils seemed\nto be unable to answer the question regarding the profession\nhe or she wants to practice in the future. In addition, the\nquestion still remains as to what extent the fact that they\nvalue and defend vocational school is related to the way their\nself-formation is shaped. In other words, what the question-\nnaire does not highlight concerns whether their option in pur-\nsuing working-class jobs via vocational schooling has been\nplanned in rational terms in their junior high school years or\nit is the end product of their effort to coherently reconstruct\ntheir past, present, and future self. In the next sections, we\naim at shedding light to this question.\nIdentity Claims in Vocational Adolescents'\nSchooling Trajectories\nIn coding our interview data, one permanent theme that per-\nmeated adolescents' answers was that vocational school\ncomes to be crystallized as post-junior high school option in\nconnection with what Gubrium and Holstein (1995) called\n\"local culture\" (p. 50), that is, locally promoted and bio-\ngraphically sedimented ways and interpretive resources for\nmaking sense of their lives. One of our interviewees, Maria,\nfor instance, raised in an extended family in a village, has\nexcluded the choice of attending university from her options,\ndespite succeeding in national exams, believing that this\ndoes not constitute a worthwhile investment from a career\npoint of view. Discussing her plans about the future, the\nbiased enthusiasm of the researcher for \"undergraduate stu-\ndent life,\" which intrudes unconsciously in our interaction, is\ncontradicted by Maria in the blatant and matter-of-fact way\nshe defends and promotes her career prospects:\nExtract 1:\nHow did you do in your national exams?\nI succeeded as an agriculturist in plant production\nDepartment\nSo are you going to start your undergraduate career now?\nI don't know. I don't think I will go.\nWhy so?\nWhat for? Just to have a certificate that I graduated from\nHigher Technical Education? There are no jobs. To go\nthere for five years and then for two more looking for\na job?\nAnd what are you thinking of doing?\nKiprianos and Christodoulou 7\nI'm thinking of getting a job to get money quickly or\nbecome a hairdresser . . . Our financial status isn't that\ngood to go to study in one other town but, okay, I have\nalso applied to the police force for a position as a spe-\ncial guard.\nInsofar as she has been helping her father in the farming\nof their land since she was a child, and to the extent that she\nknows that growing crops will not enable her to establish a\ncareer (not because it is a man's world, but because \"you are\nleft with nothing, you end up in debt\"), Maria experiences\nher relation with time in terms of pressure. For Maria, higher\ntechnical education constitutes neither a means of attaining\nupward social mobility nor a form of investment in which\nshe will obtain prestige, issues that do not seem to have\ncrossed her mind as she has already decided not to attend the\nfaculty she has succeeded in the national exams. Her motives\nand her goals are combined in such a way that she grounds\nher educational choices not on a positively formulated job\nperspective but rather on the avoidance of a future negative\nsituation (unemployment).\nIf this is the case, however, why did she choose to attend\ntechnical senior high school as she does not consider it as a\nmeans for realizing job aspirations? The answer could lie in\nthat is, in her motivational statements through which her\nworld comes to be seen as taken for granted and within which\nthe major and minor issues that make up her life are speci-\nfied. Discussing the reasons, Maria invokes to attend voca-\ntional school; she enunciates a range of typifications which\nallow her to put an order to her school experience and to\nprivilege her self-determination:\nExtract 2:\nAnd why did you choose Technical and not General [high\nschool]?\nBecause I do not like studying a lot. Because I knew that\nGeneral [high school] includes courses such asAncient\nGreek and Mathematics; courses I couldn't handle.\nOnly in the first grade of the technical high school are\nwe taught the same courses with General [school] with\nthe exception of Ancient Greek. Then in the second\ngrade I was able to select the classes of my section,\neasy classes, and a lot of laboratory courses . . . In gen-\neral, [school] in my opinion, whoever wants to enter\nuniversity, to study, attends this kind of school, while\nin the technical one all children come [to school] with-\nout a satchel. I selected technical [school] just to have\na good final mark because in general [school] I\nwouldn't be able achieve that. I do not have the\npatience to study, while in technical school I would\njust study for the classes I was examined in. It's not\nthat I don't want to study. It's that I am unable to focus\non studying for hours.\nIt is evident that Maria places herself in the \"non-studi-\nous\" category of students, not so much in the sense that she\nchooses not to study, but mainly because of her mood and a\nlack of patience. This self-typification does not seem to be a\nsource of shame or embarrassment against someone (i.e., the\nresearcher) who is presented as an exponent of the values of\nthe school institution. Rather, it is something that it may be\nindicative of the fact that the categorization of students into\n\"studious\" and \"non-studious\" is so obvious to her that she\ndoes not consider it threatening to the way she presents her-\nself. It has a clearly practical value for her, functioning as a\nway not so much to make a post-secondary school decision,\nbut rather to deal with her schooling trajectory and to make a\nchoice as to whether to attend general or vocational school\nafter junior high school. The \"studious\"/\"non-studious\" clas-\nsification allows her to attribute motives to the members of\nthese two groups in relation to post-junior high school\nchoices, for the former go to general high school to \"enter a\nfaculty in Higher Technical Education or a university\" while\nthe latter choose to attend vocational school to \"get a good\nfinal mark.\"\nFurthermore, the self-positionings students of technical\nschool produce to interpret their choice to attend vocational\nschool are also a source that permits them to biographically\nthematize their identity claims. Those students who defend\ntheir choice do so not only to highlight the social signifi-\ncance of technical education but also to protect the interpre-\ntation and the categorization of themselves as \"non-studious.\"\nThey achieve this through the way they understand their rela-\ntion to the general high school students. When we asked\nthem their opinion about general high school students, we\ngot the following answers:\nExtract 3:\nThey are different characters. For example, boys are totally\ndifferent. There is no relation [to us]. I call them \"college-boys,\"\nas if it was a college. They study a lot, nerds, while the boys in\ntechnical [school] never enter the class. They never attend\nclasses. Students project a cunning image of themselves. No\nlesson can be taught, there is a mess. Even teachers are different\nbetween the two [kinds of] schools. Let's say that in technical\nschools they are friends with the teachers. They talk to them in\nsingular. Only the headmaster was a bit strict. (Eva, 17)\nExtract 4:\nWell, General school has many differences with the Technical\nbecause I have a friend who attends General . . . That is to say\nchildren are very different . . . That is, in our school they\ndon't care about anything.\nWhat do you mean?\nThat they care to have a car, a motorbike and how to earn\nmoney, while in General school they care about their\nfuture, too.\n8 SAGE Open\nDo you have friends from General [school]?\nYes. I connect with a guy, but he doesn't care about any-\nthing. He's like us.\nThat is to say there is a distinction between the guys com-\ning from General and Technical [schools] . . .\nI believe there is no relation at all. No relation . . . No rela-\ntion with these guys. (Jim, 17, emphasis added)\nExtract 5:\nStudious students are not the most normal people, it's kind of\nlike a college there; they're not the most normal people. It's\nquite obvious. Basically, I believe that over there most of them\nlive in a fantasy world. They just study to enter a faculty. I know\nthat because I attended first class in General [school] but I quit\nas I didn't study. Everyone is a crank there. I used to try to fit in,\nbut they didn't pay attention to me, and I said that it was not\nworth being with them and I left. (Alex, 17)\nIt is obvious from the above passages that for technical\neducation students, the sense of difference is experienced in\nemotionally strained and gendered terms. Masculinity and\nthe undermining of official school values (\"No lesson can be\ntaught, there is a mess,\" Extract 3) function as a basis for a\ngendered standardization and classification of students\n(\"They study a lot,\" Extract 3), and as evidence of the sepa-\nrate and potentially superior behavior of vocational school\nstudents. The emphasis given to masculinity serves as a\nresource to morally legitimize the mode of action of those\nwho fall into the category of such students who can state, \"It's\nnot that I don't want to study. It's that I am unable to . . . \" The\nidentity that technical education students claim refers to the\nfact that they are \"non-studious,\" and that attendance in tech-\nnical school is grounded on all those practices through which\n\"mess\" is performed and money is earned.\nFor our speakers, their sense of self is formed by what\nthey exclude and evaluate negatively, such as to be \"studi-\nous,\" \"college-boys,\" \"nerds,\" and \"crank\" (Extract 5), prop-\nerties they think are suited to general high schools students.\nBy means of this classificatory evaluation, pupils in voca-\ntional schooling not only make motivational statements\nabout two types of different school contexts but claim to\nvalorize their belonging in vocational education in relation\nto pupils of General high schools as well. The emotionally\ncharged character of these relational self-understandings is\ntied up with the unequal social value that is attributed to\nvocational and general education in Greece. Thus, to the\nextent that pupils in vocational education seem to defend an\ninstitution devoid of what Bourdieu would have called \"sym-\nforge a sense of connectedness based on their trying to\ndeflect official classifications that defines them as being\n\"less talented.\" Knowing that they have in common a present\nwith no future (in contradistinction to General school pupils\nwho share a future with no present), pupils in vocational edu-\ncation attempt to define as valuable both the institution they\nlive in and, even more so, their way of being-in-the-world.\nBut what this being-in-the-world actually consists of and\nhow are their identity claims embodied in actual practices?\nThrough what experiences and feelings is their cultural world\nconstructed and deemed worthy of respect? And, finally, to\nwhat extent does this cultural world function as a reserve\nwithin which their sense of manliness is to be sustained?\nEmbodied Cultures in Adolescents'\nEveryday Lives\nThe identity pupils in vocational education claim by dint of\nthe vocabularies of motives they draw upon is not a cognitive\nmatter or something that happens within their head but rather\na constitutive aspect of their life-world experiences. What\nwe want to argue is that adolescents'identity claims are not a\npsychological mechanism deployed in their cognitive pro-\ncesses, but instead that it emerges in the collectively orga-\nnized and meaningful practices they engage in in their\neveryday life interactions. The par excellence practice where\none can see the emergent nature of vocational adolescents'\nidentity is motorcycle driving. The range of meanings they\ndevelop in motorcycle driving and the values that permeate it\nare revealing of their collective attempt to make sense of\nthemselves and to forge their career plans. Motorbike is not\njust a means of transport but a symbol of sociability and a\nsign of embodied skillfulness. Take Jim, for example,\nExtract 6:\nWhere did you use to go in the afternoons?\nWe used to gather in the square or go for a ride with our\nmotorcycles.\nAnd what did you use to do in the square?\nWe used to discuss things and sometimes to play over\nthere . . . To play? Basically we used to make a fuss so\nthat the police come and chase us. You know, to laugh.\nAnd did the police used to come?\nYeah listen to me, listen to me . . . Another time a police\nofficer came and we had hidden the motorbikes and\nokay . . . The police officer left. Then we created\ntrouble again and the police car arrived and . . .\nWhen you say trouble, what did you do namely?\nWe went here and there by motorbike . . . \"Accelerations\"\n. . .\nAnd what time did you use to do that?\nAt night. Half past eleven, twelve o' clock. Something\nlike that. Basically, it's nice like this. I like living this\nway.\nIn the above passage, our speaker does not describe some-\nthing he has seen but in his narration valorizes something he has\nexperienced. Dimitris likes challenging authorities \"for fun\"\nand as a way of living, because through this ritualized provoca-\ntion he builds, proves, and strengthens his relationship with his\nKiprianos and Christodoulou 9\nfriends as it provides him with opportunities for testing his\ncapacity in effectively handling motorbikes. The use he\nmakes of the motorbike means that it is a necessary and sig-\nnificant symbol of their cultural toolkit and a cultural object\nin which they collectively attribute meaning and value and\nobtain access to their social practices. The street and the\nsquare are experienced by the adolescents of our sample as\nsocial places for displaying their capacity in driving motor-\nbikes. Doing \"accelerations\" is a collectively orchestrated\nritual that bonds together those who participate in it as the\nshared knowledge of doing so functions as a sign of member-\nship of their social group. Risk taking in driving motorbikes\n(usually without a license) is something they have learned to\nface from their childhood years, while all the potential fail-\nures encountered (tumbles, injuries, and accidents) constitute\nprimary stages for successful and skillful driving in the\nfuture:\nExtract 7:\nAnd what intrigues you in the whole situation?\nFor me it's the experience . . . Well, those who do drag\nraces didn't start right away on a 1000cc motorbike,\nmy man. They used to race with small motorbikes here\nand there, on 650cc motorbikes and stuff, and then\nthey ride these [1000cc motorbikes]. They do not ride\nthem right away. They start when they are young.\nAnd how did you learn?\nI used to watch the others and I did it. And I decided to do\nit. What's the big deal? Well, in order to learn this you\nshould tumble twice or three times, that's for sure\nExcitement for these students means their involvement in\nthe possibility of failure as its surpassing of this is indicative\nof their moral strength and provides an opportunity to dis-\nplay \"character\" to their friends. Learning to handle a motor-\nbike and its concomitant risks is a process inscribed in body\nmovements. Their body, through mimicry, comes to be\nadjusted in patterned ways to all the practical exigencies of a\nspecific kind of driving which necessitates total control of all\nthe parts of the motorbike. Students in our interviews liked to\nnarrate stories full of incidents indicating the high risk of\nmotorbike driving and of the embodied skillfulness which is\ndemanded in overcoming it. Only in such practical testing\ndoes one come to understand how to move and use one's\nbody when driving the motorbike; that is, how to position\none's body upon it so that one can have the mastery of the\ncorrect speed, height, or twist of the body when driving\ndangerously:\nExtract 8:\nYes, you know why this is difficult, eh? Basically, on powerful\nmotorbikes they do not do that because the moment you shift\ngear and you have the hand here the steering wheel can twist and\nthe motorbike might drive on one wheel . . . I watched a\nmotorbike in a drag race and a car appeared and hit the rider.\nWell, he was not hurt but you should have seen the way he fell\nExtract 9:\nWell, I don't know how to handle it with the foot very well,\nbecause to go straight forward you use the foot, then you\n\"play\" with the brake, brake-throttle, brake-throttle . . . Did\nyou use to ride a bike [in such a way on one wheel]?\nYes. yes. I used to do it.\nUsing the brake, right?\nYes. yes.\nSo, as you pressed the pedal you motivate the pedal and\nthe brake. Move the pedal and brake. That's it, but you\nalso have to find the torque to raise it.\nAnd aren't you afraid?\nLook, my best friend has never fallen off, and he rides it\nstraightforwardly, a motorbike without gears, while\nwith a more powerful motorbike it's different. You\nknow something? With the bigger motorbike? The first\ntime I made a shift from first to second [gear], I opened\nthe legs . . . unconsciously . . . You don't say the foot\ngoes there and press the pedal off the brake. That's it,\nyou have to learn this. (Mike, 17)\nLearning to drive in the street presupposes that the driver\nhas gradually learned to coordinate his body movements in\naccordance to how the motorbike is moving so that he has\nreached a point where his body can unconsciously adjust on\nits own \"unconsciously,\" without needing \"to say that the\nfoot goes there and press the pedal off the brake.\" One can\neasily see that driving entails the discipline of the body and\nthe following of \"rules\" that are intuitively assimilated, with-\nout it being necessary to attain knowledge explicitly formu-\nlated and learned. This pre-reflective and bodily knowledge\nvalorized by those vocational education pupils interviewed\nfunctions as a source of accumulating symbolic capital\nwithin the peer group. Practical mastery of a motorbike in\nrisky driving situations is experienced as a personal exploit\ncapable of creating feelings of pride in those who publicly\nexhibit the strength to face the challenge, insofar as over-\ncoming danger entails a combination of body-movement pat-\nterning with improvisation.\nIt can be seen then that the students of our sample have\nlearned in practice to face this embodied skillfulness as a kind\nof personal and improvised accomplishment in relation to\nforming a hierarchy of status among them. Furthermore, the\nrules and the principles of this kind of visual learning and of\npractical imitation, thanks to which this embodied know-how\nin motorbike driving is developed, are nowhere explicitly for-\nmulated, and yet are formed collectively by the members of\nthe group. This is a kind of knowledge forged both through\npractice and experience (in riding on one wheel, in accelera-\ntion, in drag racing, etc.) and tested in risky circumstances.\nIts principles are transferred though word of mouth, and only\nby those who have themselves been initiated, thus creating\nthe feeling that they are indeed special.\nConclusion\nWhile previous years research on vocational adolescent\nidentity formation posits that the core element of its evolve-\nment revolves around adolescent disavowal for vocational\nschool qualifications, our findings highlight that adolescents\nof our days do not seem to reject the profits these qualifica-\ntions could assure them. In particular, today's adolescents\nseem to make sense of themselves in forging biographical\nidentities by which they try to reconcile two contrasting life-\nworld experiences: on one hand, they ground their self-posi-\ntionings in reversing official school culture classifications by\npromoting the embodied skills they acquire in their out-of-\nschool interactions and by valorizing \"street knowledge,\"\nand on the other hand, they have to construct life plans based\non the qualifications the vocational school provides.\nWe consider this finding to be in line with A. Taylor's\n(2005) argument that it is the evolvement of social self in\nschool life that gives shape to vocational adolescents' deci-\nsion making. What we have shown is that the crucial and\ncore element of this evolvement concerns the extent to which\nagency affects vocational adolescents' habitus formation.\nMore specifically, we noted that in trying to reconcile these\ncontrasting urgencies, adolescents' habitus is shaped not\nonly in an unconscious and practical way but it is through its\nreflexive involvement in forging narrative identities combin-\ning experiences from their street culture with the prospects\nentailed in vocational school that habitus is formed. In other\nwords, vocational adolescents' habitus is constructed in\nreflexive terms through narrative self-understandings that\nmake them capable to align their working-class lives with the\nnew prospects the vocational schools promises. Within this\ncontext, vocational adolescents try to make a socially deval-\nuated institution, that is, technical schools, into a place where\nproper admission is dependent on the extent to which one\naccepts the criteria of vocational identity membership they\ntry to impose. Through such practices as if and when they\nwill bring a satchel, if and how many absences will be noted\ndown, if they go to school by motorcycle, and whether they\nquestion a teacher's authority and undermine the official\nschool values that usually prevail in general high schools,\nvocational adolescents try to make technical education into\nsomething that belongs to them, by controlling the ebb and\nflow of its daily school life and by claiming that this is their\nway to \"define the situation\" of what schooling means.\nInsofar as they cannot turn their backs to the job careers\nwhich are based on these qualifications because of the cre-\ndentialization of job market, adolescents of our days come to\nshape their identity claims in navigating between these two\ncontrasting demands. Defending vocational school is their\nway to narratively cohere both the practical logic of their\nhabitus shaped in street-knowledge exigencies and the skills\nqualified in their passage from vocational training. As the\njobs they aspire to cannot be taken without the vocational\ntraining they go through in their teen years, today's adoles-\ncents cannot rely only on careers provided by \"street corner\nsociety\" connections.\nDespite the fact that other researchers have pointed out\nthe role of the informal networks in assuring successful pas-\nsages into work life, what they have missed concerns that\nworking-class social networks are not as much weak and\nincapable as these researchers believe (see, for example,\nWalther, Stauber, & Pohl, 2005). In contrast, one should not\ndownplay the social capital they acquire through the net-\nworks they forge in their local cultures. To the extent that they\nmake job decisions related either to their father's job or to\ntheir embodied cultures, adolescents through their vocational\ntraining try to make the unofficial skills acquired in these cul-\ntures into educational qualifications. For instance, buying a\nmotorbike, exchanging it with another one, the care they\ninvest in fixing it, to paint it, to change its engine and improve\nit, the drag races they do, and the bets they lay, are all indica-\ntive of the process through which it is possible for these ado-\nlescents to plan their job-related careers. It is exactly their\nimmersion into the motorbike culture that which provides\nthem with an intersubjective stock of knowledge upon which\nthey draw for constructing their life decisions and possible\nselves. In other words, in case that an adolescent raised in this\nlife-world locality chooses to become a car mechanic, for\nexample, he has to follow the path of vocational training in\norder to transform the embodied skills he acquired in this\nsocial world into qualifications which will enable him\nexchange them with a working-class job career. This finding\nis more close to relevant research which has shown how\nworking-class adolescents transform their local knowledge\ninto cultural capital which enables them to navigate in job\nIn a more theoretical vein, it is our contention that by\ncombining the concept of habitus with how identity is bio-\ngraphically thematized can youth sociologists explain why\nworking-class adolescents of our era seem to be in a situation\nof permanent disjunction that permeates their life stories. As\nthe disjunction is born out of the fact that their aspirations to\nfollow a normal biography containing job security and settled\nlife are at odds with the flexible and risky options opened up\nfor them by the vocational training. Raised in the contexts of\nthis disjunction, vocational adolescents become familiarized\nwith a reflexive habitus which makes them feel that decision\nmaking is a stressful and burdened social action because they\ndo not control the criteria of entrance into manual jobs. Thus,\nreflexivity is turned into biographical ambivalence that feeds\nan identity formation process through which working-class\nKiprianos and Christodoulou 11\nadolescents come to be aware of the frustration entailed in the\ngap between aspirations and access to resources. Only by\nunraveling the ebb and flow of the social embeddedness within\nwhich decision making of vocational adolescents' biographi-\ncal planning is shaped can policy makers produce forms of\nguidance adjusted to their practical needs and values.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAdams, M.
