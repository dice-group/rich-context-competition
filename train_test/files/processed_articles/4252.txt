    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe aggregation and formation of amyloid plaques by amyloid b-peptides (Abs) is believed to be one of the pathological\nhallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Intriguingly, Abs have also been shown to possess proliferative effects on neural stem\ncells (NSCs). Many essential cellular processes in NSCs, such as fate determination and proliferation, are heavily influenced by\ncell surface glycoconjugates, including gangliosides. It has recently been shown that Ab1-42 alters several key glycosyltrans-\nferases and glycosidases. To further define the effects of Abs and to clarify the potential mechanisms of action of those\npeptides on NSCs, NSCs were cultured from embryonic brains of the double-transgenic mouse model of AD [B6C3-\nTg(APPswe,PSEN1dE9)85Dbo/J] coexpressing mutants of amyloid precursor protein (APPswe) and presenilin1\n(PSEN1dE9). We found that Abs not only promoted cell proliferation but also altered expression of several key glycogenes\nfor glycoconjugate metabolism, such as sialyltransferases II and III (ST-II & -III) in AD NSCs. In addition, we found upregulation\nof epidermal growth factor receptor and Notch1 intracellular domain. Moreover, the increased expression of ST-II and -III\ncoincided with the elevated levels of c-series gangliosides (A2B5\u00fe antigens) in AD NSCs. Further, we revealed that epidermal\ngrowth factor signaling and gangliosides are necessary components on Ab-stimulated NSC proliferation. Our present study\nhas thus provided a novel mechanism for the upregulation of c-series ganglioside expression and increases in several NSC\nmarkers to account for the proliferative effect of Abs on NSCs in AD mouse brain. These observations support the potential\nbeneficial effects of Abs and gangliosides in promoting neurogenesis in AD brain.\n",

These symptoms usually\ndevelop slowly and become worse over time. They inter-\nfere with daily tasks and ultimately lead to death. It is\nwell accepted that deposition of aggregated amyloid b-\npeptide (Ab) to form amyloid plaques, also known as\nsenile plaques, together with associated reactive astrocy-\ntosis and dystrophic neuritis, represent major patho-\nstudied physiologically relevant Abs include 4-kDa pep-\nAbs are derived from proteolytic cleavage of amyloid\nprecursor protein (APP). The two dominant forms of\nAbs have a high tendency to assemble initially into the\nsoluble form and later to insoluble aggregated fibrils as\nextracellular amyloid plaques in the AD brain.\nIntermediate soluble oligomers of Abs, rather than the\naggregated Abs, are increasingly recognized as having\ncellular toxicity in AD (Kuo et al., 1996; Lansbury,\net al., 2015). Genetic linkage analyses of familial cases\nof AD have identified APP and presenilins as the highest\nrisk factors for AD pathogenesis (Guerreiro et al., 2013).\nDuring normal metabolism of amyloid protein (APP),\nAb1-40 is abundantly produced.

Approximately 1% of freshly dissolved monomeric\nAb1-40s forms dimers, but under the same conditions,\nabout 7.4% of Ab1-42 is converted to the dimeric form\n(Roher et al., 1996). This observation suggests that the\nsoluble form of Ab1-42 has a higher tendency to exist as a\ndimer. Ab dimers are the most abundant form of soluble\noligomers in the cortex of AD patients (Jin et al., 2011).\nAbs are produced by cultured cells as part of the normal\ncellular metabolism (Haass et al., 1992; Seubert et al.,\nbrain and cerebrospinal fluid of normal individuals, it\nsuggests that these peptides may possess certain physio-\nlogical activities in normal life (Shoji, 2002). Despite\nextensive efforts for studying Abs for their cytotoxic\neffects in AD, the normal biological functions and posi-\ntive effects of Abs have remained elusive. With respect to\ntheir impact on neural stem cells (NSCs), we and others\nhave reported that Ab1-42 promoted NSC proliferation\ndue to the fact that Ab1-42 stimulated Notch signaling\nand upregulated the expression of fucosyltransferase-IX\n(FUT9), which is a key enzyme for the synthesis of the\nLewis x carbohydrate epitope (Itokazu and Yu, 2014).\nGangliosides are sialic acid-containing glycosphingoli-\npids expressed primarily in the outer leaflet of the plasma\nmembrane of all vertebrate cells and are particularly\nabundant in the nervous system (Ngamukote et al.,\ncellular differentiation and brain development, it is\nknown that dramatic and consistent changes in the com-\nposition of neural gangliosides occur (Yu et al., 1988;\nNgamukote et al., 2007). In rodent brain, a shift from\nthe synthesis of simple gangliosides, such as GM3 and\nGD3, to the synthesis of the more complex gangliosides\nin the a- and b-series, particularly GM1, GD1a, GD1b,\nand GT1b, during brain development has been well docu-\n(Eisenbarth et al., 1979), and it recognizes c-series gan-\ngliosides, including GQ1c, GT1c, and GT3 (Kasai and\nare abundant in embryonic mammalian brains but are\npresent in extremely low amount in adult brains\n(Ngamukote et al., 2007). Stage-specific embryonic anti-\ngen-1 (SSEA-1/Lewis X/CD15) is a well-known carbohy-\ndrate antigenic epitope of undifferentiated cells and has\nbeen recognized as an NSC marker (Yu and Itokazu,\n2014). The 3-fucosyl-N-acetyllactosamine or Lewis X\ncarbohydrate structure is defined as [Galb1-4(Fuca1-\n3)GlcNAcb-]. Lewis X carbohydrate epitope is synthe-\nsized by transferring a fucosyl residue from GDP-fucose\nto N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) by the action of a1,3-\nFUT9 (Kudo et al., 1998). Recently, we showed that\nFUT9 knockdown in mouse NSCs impaired Musashi-1\nexpression and NSC proliferation, suggesting that NSC\nproliferation can be modulated by FUT9 and the Notch\nAt present, there has not been any effective therapy to\nhalt the progression of AD, although it is generally\naccepted that it is more promising to halt the progression\nof AD during the earlier stages (Bateman, 2015). With the\nadvent of stem cell therapy, it is expected that the use of\nNSCs may contribute to the treatment of AD as well as\nseveral other neurodegenerative disorders. NSCs are\nundifferentiated neural cells characterized by the capacity\nfor self-renewal and proliferation with retention of multi-\npotency, that is, generating brain-forming cells such as\nneurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. For the thera-\npeutic use of NSCs in AD, a detailed clarification of the\neffects of Abs and gangliosides on NSCs is warranted. In\nthis study, we investigated the possible interactions\nbetween gangliosides and NSC proliferation in AD\nbrain. Here, we demonstrated that NSCs from embryonic\nbrains of a double-transgenic mouse model of AD have\nincreased capacity for proliferation with upregulation of\nkey glycogenes for c-series gangliosides synthesis, such as\nsialyltransferases II and III (ST-II and-III). Both are key\nenzymes involved in the synthesis of c-series gangliosides\nwhose expression is characteristic of NSCs. The increased\nexpression of ST-II and -III elevated levels of c-series\ngangliosides (A2B5-antigen). In AD NSCs, NSC-\nassociated markers, such as epidermal growth factor\nreceptor (EGFR) and Notch1 intracellular domain\n(NICD), were upregulated. Interestingly, our results\nrevealed that EGF and b/c-series gangliosides are\nrequired for Ab-stimulated NSC proliferation. Our pre-\nsent study thus provides a novel mechanism for NSC\nproliferation in AD brain tightly regulated by ganglio-\nsides and suggests that Abs and gangliosides could be\nused as potential therapeutic targets for promoting\nneurogenesis in AD brain.\nMaterials and Methods\nMaterials\nAb1-42 was purchased from Bachem Americas (Torrance,\nCA). Freshly prepared soluble Abs were used for the experi-\nment. Antibodies used were as follows: anti-Notch-1 (mouse;\nBD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), anti-EGFR (rabbit; Santa\nCruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX), and antiactin (rabbit;\nSigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO).\nNSC Culture\n(Jankowsky et al., 2001) were purchased from the\n2 ASN Neuro\nJackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME), and ST-II-\nknockout (KO) mice were originally provided by the\ncourtesy of Dr. Richard Proia (NIDDK, NIH,\nBethesda, MD). Wild-type (WT) littermates of these\nmice were used for control. Mouse NSCs were prepared\nfrom embryonic brains in the form of neurospheres,\nwhich were floating clonal aggregates formed by NSCs\nin vitro (Nakatani et al., 2010). In brief, single-cell sus-\npensions were prepared from the striata of embryonic day\n(E)-14.5 mouse brains. NSCs were cultured in\nNeurobasal A medium (Life Technologies, Carlsbad,\nCA) supplemented with B27 (Life Technologies) and\n20 ng/ml of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2;\nPeprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ) and 20 ng/ml of EGF\n(Peprotech). Neurospheres formed after 1 week were col-\nlected for further passages and analyses. The use of ani-\nmals for this study was approved by the Institutional\nAnimal Care and Use Committees at Georgia Regents\nUniversity and the VA Medical Center, Augusta, GA.\nWST-8 Assay\nThe number of cultured NSCs was estimated by the\nWST-8 assay using a Cell Counting Kit-8 (Dojindo,\nKumamoto, Japan). The dissociated NSCs from neuro-\nspheres were plated at a density of 1 \u00c2 104 cells per well\nonto 96-well plates that had been coated with poly-L-\nornithine (Sigma-Aldrich) and fibronectin (Sigma-\nAldrich). After 3 days of culture, 10 ml of WST-8 solution\nwas added to each well. After incubating for 3 hr in a CO2\nincubator, the spectrophotometric absorbance of WST-\n8-formazan produced by the dehydrogenase activity in\nthe living neural cells was measured at the wavelength\nof 450 nm using a Benchmark Plus Microplate\nSpectrophotometer (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules,\nCA). The spectrophotometric absorbance measured by\nthis assay was highly correlated with the number of\nliving NSCs (Kanemura et al., 2002; Itokazu et al.,\nfreshly dissolved in media were replaced to each well on\nthe next day after cell plating, and WST-8 analysis was\nperformed on those cells after 3 days.\nReverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction\nTotal RNA samples were isolated from cultured NSCs\nusing the Trizol reagent (Life Technologies). cDNAs\nwere synthesized based on the total RNAs as templates\nusing MultiScribeTM Reverse Transcriptase (Applied\nBioscience). PCR was performed using ReadyMixTM\nREDTaq\u00d5 (Sigma-Aldrich) with the following settings:\nproducts were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis\nusing 1.5% agarose gels containing SYBR SafeTM\nDNA Gel stain (Life Technologies). The bands were\nquantified using the NIH ImageJ 1.46 r image processing\nprogram (rsb.info.nih.gov) to reflect the original mRNA\nlevels. Densitometric data were normalized against b-\nactin mRNA. The normalized value from control (WT)\nis defined as 1.0.

Proteins\nwere separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide\ngel electrophoresis (8% gel) under reducing conditions\nand transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes.\nThe membranes were probed with primary antibodies fol-\nlowed by appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated\nwith horseradish peroxidase (BD Biosciences). Signals\nwere visualized with Western Lightning Western blot\nchemiluminescence reagent (Perkin Elmer Life\nand Analytical Sciences, Boston, MA). The bands were\nquantified using the NIH ImageJ. Densitometric values\nwere normalized by setting the NICD/actin or EGFR/\nactin protein ratio for control (WT) in each treatment.\nThe normalized value from control (WT) is defined\nImmunocytochemistry\nCells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20min at\nroom temperature, washed three times with PBS, and\nblocked with 5% goat serum and 1% BSA for 30min.\nThe treated cells were then incubated with antibodies over-\nnight in a chamber with a humid atmosphere at 4C. The\nprimary antibody used was an anti-A2B5 mouse antibody\n(IgM). After incubation with the primary antibody,\nthe cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated\nwith Alexa 488 anti-mouse IgM antibody (Thermo Fisher\nScientific Inc.) for 2 hr in the dark, washed and then\nincubated with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Thermo\nFisher Scientific Inc.) for 5 min to stain the nuclei.\nSpecimens were mounted in Fluoro-Gel from Electron\nMicroscopy Sciences (Hatfield, PA) and observed using a\nZeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss GmbH,\nJena, Germany).\nKoon et al. 3\nStatistical Evaluation\nData are expressed as means \u00c6 standard error of the\nmean from 3 to 20 independent experiments. Statistical\nsignificance was determined using one-way analysis of\nvariance followed by Tukey's post hoc multiple compari-\nson test and unpaired two-tailed Student's t test, and\np < .05 was regarded as significant.\nResults\nIncreased Number of NSCs in AD Mouse Brain\nWe have reported that supplemented Ab1-42 promotes\nmouse NSC proliferation (Itokazu et al., 2013; Itokazu\nand Yu, 2014). In the previous study, to evaluate cell\ndeath accompanied by DNA fragmentation, terminal\ndeoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end\nlabeling (TUNEL) assay was performed after Ab treat-\nments. It has revealed that there were no significant\nTUNEL-positive cells in the intact cells and NSCs treated\nwith Abs (Itokazu et al., 2013). That result was also in\naccord with our previous report showing that the expres-\nsion of active caspase 3 was not different in intact cells\nand NSCs treated with the soluble form of Abs\n(Yanagisawa et al., 2010). Those results suggest that the\nincrease of NSC number upon treatment with Abs was\nlikely caused by cell proliferation rather than by protec-\ntion the cells from undergoing apoptosis.\nNSCs were cultured from embryonic brains (E 14.5) of\nthe double-transgenic mouse model of AD coexpressing\nmutants of APP (APPswe) and presenilin1 (PSEN1dE9).\nThe dissociated NSCs (from neurospheres) were plated at\nwith poly-L-ornithine and fibronectin. After 3 days of\nculture, the number of NSCs was estimated by the\nWST-8 assay. The absorbance measured by this assay\nwas highly correlative with the number of living NSCs\n(Kanemura et al., 2002). NSCs from AD mouse model\n(AD NSCs) significantly increased the number of cells\ncompared with their littermate WT (Figure 1).\nRecently, it was reported that all of the NSCs from this\nAD mice are immunopositive for anti-Ab monoclonal\n42) and a wide range of oligomers are detected in both\ncell lysate and culture media of AD NSCs, but these pep-\ntides are not expressed in NSCs of their WT littermates\nExpression of NSC-Associated Markers\nMany essential cellular processes, such as fate determin-\nation and proliferation, in NSCs are profoundly influ-\nenced by cell surface glycoconjugates whose expression\nis dramatically altered during differentiation. FUT9 is a\nkey enzyme for the synthesis of Lewis X-carrying\nN-glycans, which has been used as an NSC marker\n(Yu and Itokazu, 2014). In our previous study, FUT9\nwas shown to increase following treatment by Ab1-42,\nwhich is expected to affect NSC proliferation (Itokazu\nand Yu, 2014). For this reason, we analyzed the gene\nexpression level of FUT9 as well as cell lineage-associated\nmarkers in AD NSCs (Figure 2(a)). The expression of\nFUT9 increased in AD NSCs. FUT9 was reported to\nbe controlled by Pax6 that promotes proliferation of\nneural progenitor cells and neurogenesis, and it was\nrevealed that Pax6 mRNA expression was increased in\nAD NSCs. Other NSC markers, such as Musashi-1 and\nSOX2, were also upregulated in AD NSCs. On the other\nhand, the expression of the mRNA of a glial marker (glial\nfibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]) was not significantly\naltered. These are consistent with the fact that Ab1-42\nstimulated FUT9, Pax6, and Musashi-1 expression as\nshown by our reverse transcription-polymerase chain\nreaction (RT-PCR) experiment in a previous study\n(Itokazu and Yu, 2014). The expression of the mRNA\nof a neuronal marker (microtubule-associated protein 2)\nis also elevated.\nFigure 1. Increased number of NSCs in AD mouse in vitro. The\nnumber of NSCs from wild-type (WT) and AD mice [B6C3-\nTg(APPswe,Psen1dE9)85Dbo/J], cultured for 3 days as monolayer\nculture with FGF2 and EGF, was estimated by the WST-8 assay. The\ny axis represents the relative absorbance (Abs.), which indicates the\npercentage of absorbance against WT. Each bar represents\nmean \u00c6 SEM of 20 independent experiments (n \u00bc 20).

Western blot analysis shows that the protein\nexpression of NICD was upregulated in AD NSCs. In\naddition to the Notch signaling pathway, the EGFR\npathway is also important to regulate stem cell\nproliferation. It is known that both pathways are capable\nof regulating the NSC number and self-renewal capability\n(Aguirre et al., 2010). We also examined the protein\nexpression level of EGFR and found that the EGFR\nexpression was significantly elevated in AD NSCs\n(Figure 2(b)). These data are consistent with the notion\nthat both Notch and EGFR pathways are contributing to\nthe enhanced cell proliferation for AD NSCs.\nFigure 2.

We performed RT-PCR experi-\nments and semiquantified gene expressions of ST-II and -\nIII. We found increased expression of ST-II and -III in\nAD NSCs (Figure 3(b)). Next, we evaluated the expres-\nsion of A2B5 antigens, including c-series gangliosides, by\nimmunocytochemistry. The increased expression of ST-II\nand -III resulted in elevated levels of c-series gangliosides\n(A2B5-antigens) in AD NSCs (Figure 3(c)). These data\nsuggest that c-series gangliosides may also be associated\nwith NSC proliferation in AD.\nEGF Is Required for Increased NSC\nProliferation in AD\nWe found that the expression of EGFR was significantly\nincreased in AD NSCs (Figure 2(b)). We previously\nreported that ST-II-KO NSCs that were cultured with\nEGF showed significantly suppressed cellular prolifer-\nation (Wang and Yu, 2013). Surprisingly, however, no\ndifference in the proliferation rate and expression of line-\nage-associated markers was found between ST-II\u00fe/\u00fe\n(WT) NSCs and ST-II-KO NSCs that were cultured in\nthe presence of FGF2 but in the absence of EGF (Yu\nand Yanagisawa, 2007). Accordingly, this ganglioside-\ndependent NSC proliferation is considered to be\nregulated mainly through the EGFR signaling pathway.\nTo investigate whether the increase of cell proliferation in\nAD NSCs was dependent EGFR-signaling, we cultured\nAD NSCs in the absence of EGF. It was revealed\nthat AD NSCs did not show any increased cell prolifer-\nation under this condition (Figure 4(a)). Because FGF2 is\nknown to maintain NSC proliferation even in the absence\nof EGF (Yanagisawa et al., 2010), the results clearly\nshowed that EGFR signaling is a key pathway for\nAb-induced NSC proliferation.\nGangliosides Are Required for A-Stimulated\nNSC Proliferation\nThe earlier results suggest that the enhanced cell prolifer-\nation in AD NSC could depend on gangliosides through\nthe EGFR-signaling (Wang and Yu, 2013). To evaluate\nthis possibility, NSCs were isolated from ST-II-KO mice\nin which GD3 and its downstream products, including b-\nand c-series gangliosides, are missing (Figure 3(a)), and\ntheir WT littermates. Figure 4(b) shows that Ab1-42 dra-\nmatically increased WT NSC proliferation as similar as\nshown in Figure 1. Most intriguingly, however, Ab1-42\ncould not stimulate cell proliferation on ST-II-KO NSCs.\nThe results clearly show that b- or c-series gangliosides\nare required for Ab1-42-induced NSC proliferation.\nDiscussion\nThe present study provides the first direct evidence that\ngangliosides are required for Ab-stimulated NSC prolif-\neration. We and others have previously reported that\nFigure 2. Continued.\n6 ASN Neuro\nsupplemented soluble Ab1-42-stimulated NSC prolifer-\nation. In this study, we discovered that NSCs from an\nmouse AD model [B6.Cg-Tg (APPswe,PSEN1\ndE9)85Dbo/J] showed increased cell proliferation with\nupregulation of ganglioside expression. Recently, NSCs\nhave been cultured from this AD model mouse (Ghate\net al., 2014), and these AD NSCs are confirmed to highly\nexpress APP and its proteolytic peptides including both\nAb monomer and a wide range of pathogenic oligomers\n42) were detected only in AD NSCs, but they were not\nexpressed in NSCs from their WT littermates.

We showed that NICD was\nincreased in AD NSCs (Figure 2(b)). Presenilins are a\nnecessary substrate transporter and the catalytic compo-\nnent of g-secretase (van Tijn et al., 2011). g-Secretase is a\ntransmembrane enzyme that cleaves APP and catalyzes\nthe formation of Ab peptides. g-Secretase also cleaves\nNotch and releases NICD that is translocated to the\nnucleus to regulate expression of genes important for\ndevelopment (Hardy and Israel, 1999). The mutation of\nPSEN1dE9 in AD models lacks the endoproteolytic\ncleavage site which is located at exon 9 of presenilin1,\nand this mutant PSEN1dE9 is constitutively active\n(Thinakaran et al., 1996). It has been reported that\nNotch expression is upregulated in brains of AD patients\nDavis et al. (1998) reported that both human WT and\nAD mutant presenilin1 elevate Notch1 expression and\nrestore normal development in presenilin1-KO mouse.\nIt is therefore possible that the presenilin1 mutation\nexpressed in the Tg(APPswe,PSEN1dE9) mouse model\nof AD may be responsible for the enhanced Notch cleav-\nages and increased NICD level for NSC proliferation.\nEGFR signaling plays central roles in cell proliferation\ndifferentiation and neuronal development, and it is\nknown that NSCs express EGFR (Reynolds et al.,\nhas been reported that mice lacking either EGFR or its\nFigure 3.

Thus, it can be\nconsidered that EGFR modulates NSC functions in AD\nbrain under physiological and pathophysiological\nconditions.\nAlthough adult neurogenesis is gradually diminished\nwith the onset of aging in mice, a significant number of\nNSCs still exists in aged brains (Jin et al., 2003). Not\nsurprisingly, the EGFR expression in rodent brain is\nalso reduced with aging (Hiramatsu et al., 1988). Jin\net al. reported that bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-labeled\ncells were reduced by 90% in dentate gyrus (DG) and\nmonth-old mice. Infusions of Hb-EGF restored and\nincreased the number of BrdU \u00fe cells by 450% in DG\n2003). It is considered that Hb-EGF can activate\nEGFR and induce NSC proliferation via the EGFR sig-\nnaling pathway (Higashiyama et al., 1991; Kornblum\net al., 1999). Recently, Hb-EGF is also reported to be\nrequired for maintaining synaptic plasticity and\nmemory function in adult mice (Oyagi et al., 2011).\nThese studies reinforce the notion that EGFR signaling\npathway is crucial in maintaining adult NSCs and in\nretarding the aging process of the brain.\nRecently, we presented evidence that GD3, which is\nthe major ganglioside in NSCs (Nakatani et al., 2010),\nwas required for maintaining the self-renewal ability of\nmouse NSCs in vivo and in vitro (Wang and Yu, 2013;\nWang et al., 2014). In the absence of GD3, NSCs from\npostnatal ST-II-KO mice had even lower self-renewal\ncapacity than NSCs from embryonic ST-II-KO mice.\nFigure 4. EGF signaling is required for cell proliferation of AD\nNSCs, and gangliosides are necessary for Ab-stimulated NSC\nproliferation. (a) NSCs were isolated from brains of AD mice and\ntheir WT littermates. NSCs were cultured for 3 days with FGF2\nbut without EGF, and the number of NSCs was estimated by the\nWST-8 assay. The y axis represents the relative absorbance (Abs.),\nwhich indicates the percentage of absorbance against WT. Each bar\nrepresents mean \u00c6 SD of 12 independent experiments (n \u00bc 12).\nComparison was made between AD mice versus their WT litter-\nmates. No statistical significance was detected on the number of\nNSCs in this condition (\u00c0EGF, \u00feFGF2). (b) NSCs were isolated\nfrom ST-II (GD3 synthase)-KO mice and their WT littermates.\nNSCs were cultured for 3 days with or without Abs. The number\nof NSCs in the monolayer culture in the presence of soluble Ab1-\n42 (10 mM) was estimated by the WST-8 assay. The y axis represents\nrelative absorbance (Abs.), which represents the percentage of\nabsorbance against vehicle treatment. Each bar represents\nmean \u00c6 SD of eight independent experiments (n \u00bc 8). *p <.05 and\n**p <.01 indicate the level of significance.\nWT \u00bcwild-type; AD \u00bcAlzheimer's disease; ST-II \u00bc sialyltransferase\nII; KO \u00bc knockout; EGF \u00bc epidermal growth factor; NSCs \u00bc neural\nstem cells; FGF \u00bc fibroblast growth factor.\nKoon et al. 9\nOur previous in vivo study also showed that the ventricu-\nlar wall was significantly thinner in adult ST-II-KO\nmouse brain, and there was a progressive loss of NSCs\nin DG (80%) and SVZ (70%) regions of 6-month-old ST-\nII-KO mouse brains. In addition, the greater impaired\nneurogenesis in the adult ST-II-KO mice led to depres-\nsion-like behaviors in adult animals (Wang et al., 2014).\nFor maintenance of healthy NSC functions, our previous\nstudy suggested that GD3 has important roles to keep cell\nsurface EGFR expression by modulating the EGFR\nintracellular recycling pathway (Wang and Yu, 2013).\nThe expression of EGFR mRNA was not changed\n(Figure 2(a)), whereas the protein level of EGFR was\nhighly elevated (Figure 2(b)) in AD NSCs. Taken\ntogether, gangliosides may enhance the sorting of\nEGFR through the early endosomes to the recycling\nendosomal pathway, rather than through the degradative\nlysosomal pathway in AD NSCs. The present study dem-\nonstrates that b-/c-series gangliosides and EGF-signaling\nare both necessary for Ab-stimulated NSC proliferation\n(Figure 4(b)). Accordingly, gangliosides, which are\nimportant modulator(s) of EGFR signaling pathway,\nmay maintain adult NSC functions. Further studies are\nneeded to examine whether the EGFR recycling pathway\nis similarly involved in enhancing NSC proliferation in\nAD brain.\nIt has been reported that endogenous neurogenesis is\naltered in AD patients and transgenic AD mouse models.\nRecently, stage-specific changes in neurogenesis were stu-\ndied in AD patients' brains (Ekonomou et al., 2015). In\nthat study, it was found that there was a trend showing an\nincrease in the number of neuroblasts (PCNA\u00fe/HuC/\nD\u00fe) in the DG of moderate AD brains, but eventually\na decrease in the number of immature neurons (HuC/\nD\u00fe) in the DG of patients at the stage of severe AD\n(Ekonomou et al., 2015). The majority of AD cases\n(>95%) are sporadic, and only 5% of AD cases are\nexplained by genetic mutations (Alzheimer's\nAssociation, 2014). Increased NSC proliferation is also\nreported in sporadic AD mouse model (Diaz-Moreno\nRegarding the aging process and AD, it is worth men-\ntioning that a senescence-accelerated mouse prone\n(SAMP8) model of accelerated senescence, which was ori-\nginally generated from AKR/J mice after selective breed-\ning (Takeda et al., 1981), has been proposed as a suitable\nmodel to study changes associated with aging and AD\nbrains, given that SAMP8 mice develop AD lesions in\nan age-dependent manner (Butterfield and Poon, 2005;\nMorley et al., 2012). More recently, Di\u00b4az-Moreno et al.\nreported that NSC cultures from 2-month-old SAMP8\nmice displayed increased cell proliferation. On the other\nhand, NSC proliferation was decreased at 10 months of\nage in the SAMP8 mouse. In their in vivo study, the\nnumber of BrdU\u00fe proliferating cells was similar in\n1-month-old mice, transiently elevated between\n2 months (BrdU\u00fe cells increased by almost 2-fold com-\npared with 1 month) and 6 months (about 1.4-fold\nincreased from 1 month) of ages in SAMP8 mice, and\nfinally decreased in older (14-month-old) SAMP8 mice\ncompared with control animals. GFAP\u00fe/SOX2\u00fe NSCs\nwere increased significantly at SVZ, and the thickness of\nthe ventricular wall was also significantly larger in\n2-month-old SAMP8 mice than that in the control\nIn conclusion, the studies from AD patients and\nmouse models clearly indicate an enhanced neurogenesis\nin early/moderate stage of AD and then neurogenesis\nbecomes impaired in late/severe AD brains. In late/\nsevere AD brains, neurogenic impairments may underlie,\nat least in part, the progressive loss of memory and com-\npromised ability to learn and process new information\ncharacterizing the disease. Both olfactory and hippocam-\npal dysfunction might be enhanced by compromised\nneurogenesis in the SVZ and in the DG, respectively.\nTherefore, endogenous neurogenesis has been suggested\nas an important treatment target in AD (Mu and Gage,\nincreased the number of adult NSCs as well as embryonic\nAlthough other determinants (e.g., APP intracellular\ndomain, soluble APP beta, or presenilin) that are ger-\nmane to Abs may also contribute to enhancement of\ncell proliferation, our present study provides a novel\nmechanism for NSC proliferation in AD brain that is\ntightly regulated by gangliosides. Ganglioside expression\nprofiles are associated not only with central nervous\nsystem development but also with the pathogenic mech-\nanisms of central nervous system diseases, such as AD.\nUnderstanding the roles of gangliosides and Abs on NSC\nfunctions should be very useful in providing novel strate-\ngies for promoting adult neurogenesis in AD damaged\nbrains.\n"
