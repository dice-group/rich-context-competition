Tukey mean \u00b1 difference plots were used to investigate the changes in the\ndistributions of BMI within sex \u00b1 age groups.\nRESULTS: Mean \u00b1 difference plots allow qualitative visual comparisons of the distributions of BMI between surveys.\nFor all sex \u00b1 age groups, there was increasing skewness with a greater shift in the upper part of the distribution so\nthat, within each group, the heaviest subgroup was heavier in NHANES III than in prior surveys. For the youngest\nchildren, the lower part of the distribution showed virtually no change. With increasing age the whole distribution\ntended to shift upward slightly, suggesting an increase in BMI across the entire population.\nCONCLUSIONS: These changes in the distribution of BMI suggest the combination of both profound environmental\ndeterminants and a population with a high degree of susceptibility. The reasons for the increasing prevalence of\nobesity should be sought in part by seeking to understand the factors causing increases in the population as a whole.\nKeywords: adults; body weight; body mass index; children; health surveys; overweight; obesity; time trends;\nUnited States\nIntroduction\nThe prevalence of overweight and obesity have\nincreased markedly in the United States for both\nchildren and adults.1 \u00b1 3 National survey data show\nprevalence of obesity (body mass index (BMI)\n! 30.0) increased by 8 percentage points, from\n20 \u00b1 74 y. Mean levels of BMI also increased, from\nincreased markedly for children and adolescents in\nthe United States over the same period. Before these\nobservations, previous surveys had shown only slight\nLittle is known about the reasons for these increases\nin obesity in the population, although similar trends\nhave been seen elsewhere in the world as well. Within\na given population, these increases are likely to be\nresponses to changes in environmental and social\nfactors, rather than to genetic changes in the popula-\ntion or to the effects of immigration and emigration.\nAs Rose has pointed out, increases in the prevalence\nof an elevated level of a characteristic such as blood\npressure or BMI tend to be associated with shifts in\nthe distribution of that characteristic in the entire\nSeveral general models for the increase in the\npopulation prevalence of obesity are possible. One\nsubgroup of the population may be heavier than the\ncomparable subgroup in the past, with little change in\nthe rest of the population. Or all subgroups of the\npopulation might be heavier than the comparable\nsubgroups were previously. Because both these\nchanges, as well as many other types of changes,\nwould lead to increases both in the prevalence of\noverweight and in mean BMI, these increases do not\nin themselves show exactly what the underlying\nchanges in the population distribution of BMI might\nbe. The Rose model would suggest that increases in\nthe prevalence of obesity are likely to be related to\nchanges in the distribution of BMI in the population as\na whole.\nThe objective of this paper is to apply graphical\nmethods to investigate the changes in the distribution\nof BMI in the United States, using data from cross-\nsectional nationally representative health examination\nsurveys. Because these comparisons are based on\nsuccessive cross-sectional surveys, each of which\nexamined a different sample of individuals, these\n*Correspondence: KM Flegal, National Center for Health\nE-mail: kmf2@cdc.gov\nwww.nature.com/ijo\nincreases over time do not show changes on an\nindividual level. However, the differences in the\ndistribution of BMI between two surveys can be\nexamined.\nBecause we found no standard approach in the\nliterature for comparing distributions of BMI, we\nreviewed a number of graphical methods. We selected\nTukey mean \u00b1 difference (m \u00b1 d plots)7 to compare the\ndistribution of BMI in NHANES III to the distribution\nof BMI in prior surveys for the same sex \u00b1 age\ncategories. Since these plots may be unfamiliar, we\n\u00aerst describe the construction and use of m \u00b1 d plots\nand give some examples. We then apply this method\nto data for the US population. We previously\npublished some examples of m \u00b1 d plots for a few\nselected age \u00b1 sex groups for adults from the \u00aerst\nMethods\nThe third National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey (NHANES III) was conducted from 1988 to\n1994 by the National Center for Health Statistics\n(NCHS) of the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention. A nationally representative sample of\nthe US civilian non-institutionalized population was\nselected using a complex, strati\u00aeed, multistage prob-\nability cluster sampling design. Informed consent was\nobtained from all respondents and the protocol was\nreviewed and approved by the NCHS NHANES\nInstitutional Review Board. A home interview was\nfollowed by a physical examination in a mobile\nexamination center. A description of the plan and\noperation of the survey has been published.9\nNHANES III is the most recent in a series of cross-\nsectional health examination surveys carried out by\nNCHS. Although each survey provides representative\nnational data, different individuals are examined each\ntime. In all surveys, weight and height were measured\nusing standardized techniques and equipment.1 Body\nmass index (BMI) was calculated as weight (kg)\ndivided by the square of height (m). For adults,\nobesity was de\u00aened as a BMI value ! 30.0. For\nchildren and adolescents, overweight was de\u00aened as\na BMI value equal to or greater than the preliminary\nmonth-of-age-and sex-speci\u00aec 95th percentile values\nfrom the revision of the NCHS growth charts.\nFor adults aged 20 \u00b1 74 y, we compared the distri-\nbution of BMI in NHANES III with the distribution of\nBMI in the preceding survey, NHANES II, which was\nand similar methods. A description of that survey has\nalso been published.10 In NHANES III there was no\nupper age limit. However, because for NHANES II,\nthe upper age limit was 74 y, comparisons for adults\nare limited to the age range 20 \u00b1 74 y. Women who\nwere pregnant at the time of the examination are\nexcluded from these analyses. Unweighted sample\nsizes by sex and age group for adults are presented\nin Table 1.\nFor children and adolescents aged 6 \u00b1 17 y, we\ncompared the distribution of BMI in NHANES III\nwith the distribution of BMI in two earlier surveys in\nthe series. Cycles II and III of the National Health\nbeen published.11,12 NHES II was limited to children\naged 6 \u00b1 11 y and NHES III was limited to children\nand adolescents aged 12 \u00b1 17 y. Because the preva-\nlence of overweight in these two earlier surveys was\nsimilar to that in NHANES II and because these\nsurveys had large sample sizes for children and\nadolescents, these surveys were selected as the basis\nTable 1 Sample sizes by sex, age and survey for adults aged\nMen\nWomen\nTable 2 Sample sizes by age, sex and survey for children and\nMales\nFemales\nChanges in distribution of BMI in US\nKM Flegal and RP Troiano\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nfor comparison with children and adolescents from\nNHANES III. Unweighted sample sizes for children\nand adolescents are presented in Table 2. Pregnant\ngirls aged 17 (n  15) in NHANES III were excluded\nfrom these analyses: pregnancy status was not avail-\nable for younger girls or for earlier surveys.\nMean-difference plots\nTo examine the changes in the distribution of BMI,\nwe used Tukey mean \u00b1 difference plots (m \u00b1 d plots) to\ncompare the distributions from the two surveys.7 A\nmean \u00b1 difference plot is a graphical method for com-\nparing distributions that is related to the quantile \u00b1\nquantile (q \u00b1 q) plot of Wilk and Gnanadesikan.7 For\nboth types of plots, shifts in distributions are investi-\ngated by comparing corresponding quantiles (for\nexample, percentiles) from two distributions. To con-\nstruct a q \u00b1 q plot, the quantiles from one distribution\nare graphed against the corresponding quantiles from\nthe other distribution. To construct an m \u00b1 d plot, the\ndifferences between the corresponding quantiles are\ngraphed on the y axis against the means of the same\nquantiles on the x axis. The points on the plot\nrepresent the differences between two distributions\nat a given quantile level plotted against the means of\nthe same quantile level from the two distributions. For\nexample, if the value of the 40th percentile for one\ndistribution was 21.5 and for the other distribution\nwas 20.0, the plot would include a point for that\npercentile that showed the difference between the\ntwo values (1.5) plotted against the mean of the two\nvalues (20.75). If the two distributions were the same,\nthe quantiles would be equal and the differences\nwould all be zero. The location of the plotted point\non the y axis shows the direction and magnitude of the\nshift. The shift is assessed by judging differences from\nthe horizontal line representing zero.\nAnother graphical method sometimes used to com-\npare distributions is a plot that shows the cumulative\npercent of the population from each distribution at\neach BMI value.13 \u00b1 15 The information in a plot of\ncumulative distributions is similar to that contained in\nan m \u00b1 d plot. However, the plot of cumulative dis-\ntributions can be dif\u00aecult to interpret and a clearer\nvisual assessment of the type of shifts between the two\ndistributions can often be derived from the m \u00b1 d plot.\nThe m \u00b1 d plot shows the differences more explicitly\nthan the cumulative distribution plot and is easier to\nassess visually because of the horizontal orientation. It\nalso shows the numeric value of the shift more clearly.\nThree simpli\u00aeed examples showing several types\nof possible differences between two distributions are\npresented in Figures 1, 2 and 3, along with the m \u00b1 d\nplots and cumulative distribution plots corresponding\nto those differences. In the \u00aerst example, both\ndistributions have the same shape but the second\ndistribution is shifted rightward (upward) by a con-\nstant amount relative to the \u00aerst distribution (Figure\n1). The constant shift appears in the m \u00b1 d plot as a\nconstant difference between percentiles of the two\ndistributions. The amount of the constant shift can be\nread directly from the m \u00b1 d plot axis.\nThe second example also shows two distributions\n(Figure 2). At the lower end, the two distributions are\nvery similar and correspond closely, but at the upper\nend, one distribution is more skewed to the right than\nthe other. In the corresponding m \u00b1 d plot, the differ-\nences corresponding to the lower percentiles are close\nto zero, showing no shift of the distribution at the\nlower percentiles, and increase progressively at higher\npercentiles, showing the increasing skewness.\nThe third example (Figure 3) combines the features\nof the \u00aerst and second examples. The second distribu-\ntion, relative to the \u00aerst, is both shifted upward\nand more skew. The corresponding m \u00b1 d plot shows\nboth the shift at lower percentiles and an increasing\ndifference at upper percentiles indicating increased\nskewness as well.\nThese three \u00aegures provide schematic representa-\ntions of three possible changes in the distribution of\nBMI, all of which would result both in an increased\nmean BMI and in an increase in the prevalence of\nobesity. These are presented simply as examples to\nshow how m \u00b1 d plots represent some speci\u00aec changes\nFigure 1 Schematic representation of a constant rightward\n(upward) shift between two distributions. (a) Frequency distribu-\ntions, (b) Corresponding m \u00b1 d plot. (c) corresponding cumulative\ndistribution plot.\nChanges in distribution of BMI in US\nKM Flegal and RP Troiano\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nbetween two distributions. Many other types of\nchanges could also occur.\nAs a real-life example, a frequency distribution plot\nfor men aged 40 \u00b1 49 y is presented in Figure 4 with\nthe corresponding m \u00b1 d plot and cumulative distribu-\ntion plot. The frequency distribution is sensitive to the\nchoice of intervals for the plots. In this example, the\ninterval is 1 BMI unit. A wider interval would produce\na smoother plot but lose detail and obscure some\nfeatures of the distributions. A \u00aener interval would\nproduce a more detailed but more jagged plot. In\ncontrast, the quantiles used for m \u00b1 d plots are not\naffected by the choice of intervals. Although with\nsmaller intervals between quantiles the number of\npoints on the plot will increase, the value of any\ngiven point such as the 90th percentile is not affected\nby the choice of interval. As can be seen from this\nexample and the preceding examples, in both the\nfrequency distribution and the cumulative distribution\nplot, it is dif\u00aecult to evaluate changes at the extremes\nof the distribution. It is also dif\u00aecult to assess how\nconstant or how variable the shift might be across the\ndistributions. The m \u00b1 d plot permits evaluation of\nboth these features.\nData analysis and statistical methods\nFor adults, age was de\u00aened as age in years at the time\nof the household interview, which generally preceded\nthe examination by 2 \u00b1 3 weeks. The age groups used\nand 70 \u00b1 74 y. For children and adolescents ages 6 \u00b1\n17 y age was de\u00aened as age at the time of the\nexamination. Single year of age groupings were\nused for children and adolescents because over this\nage range BMI increases with age and the BMI values\nfor children of different ages are not directly compar-\nable. In the age range 6 \u00b1 17 y, \u00aendings should be\ninterpreted cautiously because the unweighted sample\nsizes for the NHANES III data are small, particularly\nfor adolescents.\nStatistical analyses were carried out using SAS and\nSUDAAN.16,17 For each survey, sampling weights\nFigure 2 Schematic representation of a change to increased\nskewness.

(a) Frequency distributions, (b) Correspond-\ning m \u00b1 d plot. (c) Corresponding cumulative distribution plot.\nChanges in distribution of BMI in US\nKM Flegal and RP Troiano\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nhave been calculated that take into account the\nunequal probabilities of selection resulting from the\nsample design and from planned oversampling of\ncertain subgroups. Con\u00aedence intervals were calcu-\nlated using variance estimates that took into account\nthe complex sample design of the surveys.\nWeighted percentiles were calculated using the\nsampling weights. We calculated the even percentile\nvalues for each distribution (2nd, 4th, 6th percentile,\netc., up to the 98th percentile). For each percentile\nlevel, we then calculated the mean of the correspond-\ning percentile values from the two distributions and\nthe difference between the corresponding percentile\nvalues from the two distributions, calculated as\nNHANES III minus the other survey. Each point on\nthe plot represents the mean (on the x axis) and the\ndifference (on the y axis) for an even percentile from\nthe 2nd to the 98th percentile. Data were omitted from\nthe m \u00b1 d plots for one adolescent male age 14 y who\nhad both a very high BMI (49.4) and a high sampling\nweight, making this single point unduly in\u00afuential.\nFor children and adolescents, analyses were repeated\nlimiting the sample to white children and adolescents\nin NHES and to non-Hispanic white children and\nadolescents in NHANES III. The results were similar\nto those found including all race-ethnic groups (data\nnot shown).\nResults\nIncreases in mean BMI and the prevalence of obesity\nFor adults the increases in mean and median BMI and\nin the prevalence of obesity (BMI ! 30.0) between the\ntwo surveys are shown in Table 3. For children and\nadolescents, the differences in mean and median BMI\nare presented in Table 4 by single year of age, and the\ndifferences in the prevalence of overweight are pre-\nsented in Table 5 for broader age groups. For every\nage \u00b1 sex group, both mean and median BMI and the\nprevalence of overweight or obesity were greater in\nNHANES III than in the previous survey, suggesting\nthat for both children and adults the distribution of\nFigure 4 Example of frequency distributions from NHANES II\nand NHANES III for men aged 40 \u00b1 49 y.

For the changes in mean BMI and the\nchanges in the prevalence of overweight, 95% con-\n\u00aedence intervals generally did not include zero. For\nchildren and adolescents, the median BMIs were\nalways greater in NHANES III than in NHES IIaIII\nalthough the con\u00aedence intervals generally included\nzero.\nMean \u00b1 difference plots\nM \u00b1 d plots comparing the distribution of BMI in\nNHANES III with the distribution of BMI in NHES\nII are shown in Figure 5 by single year of age for\nchildren aged 6 \u00b1 11 y. The y-axis shows the value\nof the difference between corresponding percentiles\nof the two distributions and can be interpreted as\nshowing the direction and distance of any shift\nbetween the distributions. The shape of the line\nformed by the points suggests the nature of the\nshift. These are qualitative graphical methods\ndesigned to summarize and display differences\nbetween two distributions. Because of this and\nbecause of the small sample sizes for some age\ngroups the general patterns are more important than\nthe individual details.\nFor 6-y-old children, both male and female, the m \u00b1\nd plots show that the distributions of BMI from the\ntwo surveys are virtually identical over most of the\nrange. Most of the differences are very close to zero.\nHowever, at the upper (higher) end of the distribution,\nthe differences begin to increase progressively until at\nthe highest percentiles, the percentiles for NHANES\nIII are 4 \u00b1 6 BMI units greater than the corresponding\nNHES II percentiles. These large differences show a\nmarked upward shift and increased skewness at the\nupper end of the distribution, while most of the\ndistribution is unchanged.\nAlthough there are differences in detail, the patterns\nfor children aged 6 \u00b1 11 y are broadly similar. Most of\nthe plots suggest that the distributions of BMI in the\ntwo surveys have changed little if at all at the lower\nend, where the mean differences are close to and\nsometimes less than zero. However, at the upper end\nof the distribution all plots, except for 11-year-old\nMean BMI Median BMI\nAge^sex NHES IIaIII NHANES III Increase* (95% CI) NHES IIaIII NHANES III Increase* (95% CI)\nMales\nFemales\n*Numbers may not add up exactly due to rounding.\nTable 5 Mean prevalence of overweight (BMI ! 95th percentile)\nPrevalence (%) of overweight*\nAge^sex group NHES IIaIII NHANES III Increase (95% CI)\nMales\nFemales\n*Based on sex and month-of-age-speci\u00aec percentile cutoffs from\nrevised US growth charts (preliminary data).\nChanges in distribution of BMI in US\nKM Flegal and RP Troiano\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nFigure 5 Mean \u00b1 difference plots for the distribution of body mass index from NHES II and NHANES III, for children aged 6 \u00b1 11 y, by\nsex and age group.

The 10th, 50th and 90th percentiles are marked by a  sign.\nChanges in distribution of BMI in US\nKM Flegal and RP Troiano\nInternational Journal of Obesity\ngirls, show a large difference of at least 2 BMI units\nand often much more. This shows pronounced\nincreases in skewness with large shifts at the upper\nend of the distribution. Thus the changes in the\ndistribution of BMI for children between NHES II\nand NHANES III are characterized by little or no\ndifference at the lower end of the distribution, increas-\ning skewness and large changes at the upper end of the\ndistribution.\nM \u00b1 d plots comparing the distribution of BMI in\nNHANES III with the distribution of BMI in NHES\nIII are shown in Figure 6 by single year of age for\nadolescents aged 12 \u00b1 17 y. Here again, the pattern is\nsimilar with little change at the lowest part of the\ndistribution but strikingly large changes of 2 \u00b1 6 BMI\nunits at the upper percentiles for most groups, except\nM \u00b1 d plots comparing the distribution of BMI in\nNHANES III with the distribution of BMI in\nNHANES II are shown in Figure 7 for men and\nAlthough the details differ between sex \u00d0 age\ngroups, there are some broad similarities. In\nalmost every case, the percentiles from NHANES\nIII are greater than the corresponding percentiles\nfrom NHANES II. This shows that there is some\nupward shift in the distribution of BMI for every\nsex \u00b1 age group. All age \u00b1 sex groups also show\ngreater differences in the upper portion of the\ndistribution. This shows that there is also increased\nskewness in the distribution of BMI for every sex \u00b1\nage group. The magnitude of the differences varies\nfrom group to group. However, in most groups, the\nlargest differences are approximately 3 \u00b1 4 BMI\nunits and are seen at the highest percentiles of the\ndistribution.\nFor younger men (aged 20 \u00b1 49 y), the differences at\nthe lower end of the distribution are small ( ` 1 BMI\nunit) and fairly constant. However, at the upper end of\nthe distribution, the differences are much larger and\nare progressively greater at higher percentile levels.\nThis pattern shows that, at these ages, there is a slight\nupward shift of the entire distribution and in addition a\nlarge increase at the upper end of the distribution, so\nthat the distribution is also becoming more skewed.\nFor men in the older age ranges (50 \u00b1 74 y), the\npattern is similar, but the degree of the shift is greater\nat lower levels and less at higher percentiles than for\nthe younger age groups. This pattern suggests that for\nolder men, the upward shift is stronger and the\nincreased skewness at the upper end of the distribution\nis less than for younger men.\nFor women, the pattern is different. For most age\ngroups of women, the differences increase steadily\nacross percentiles. This shows that the entire distribu-\ntion is shifting upward and becoming progressively\nmore skewed at higher levels. Compared with men in\nthe same age range, the shifts in the distribution for\nwomen are greater at lower percentiles for the age\nDiscussion\nIncreases in mean and median BMI and in the pre-\nvalence of BMI ! 30.0 all show that the distribution of\nBMI for adults in NHANES III differs in some way\nfrom the distribution of BMI in NHANES II. Similar\n\u00aendings for mean and median BMI and the prevalence\nof BMI ! 95th percentile also show that the distribu-\ntion of BMI for children and adolescents in NHANES\nIII differs from the distribution of BMI for the\ncorresponding age \u00b1 sex groups in NHES II and III.\nHowever, these \u00aendings do not in themselves give a\ncomplete picture of how the distributions of BMI have\nchanged over time.\nThe changes in the distributions can be represented\ngraphically by mean \u00b1 difference plots. These graphi-\ncal methods by their nature include a very large\nnumber of individual data points, as compared with\nsummary statistics such as the mean or standard\ndeviation. The purpose of these methods is not to\nfocus closely on any given individual data point, but\nrather to depict graphically the overall differences in\nthe two distributions. These methods are not suited,\nfor instance, clearly to identify with certainty a\nparticular value of BMI above which the distribution\nshifts. However, they can show broad qualitative\ndifferences between the distributions.\nThese plots show that for both adults and children,\nthe distribution of BMI is becoming more skewed in\nall sex \u00b1 age groups. The heaviest subgroup of the\npopulation is much heavier in NHANES III than was\nthe heaviest subgroup in previous surveys. In addition,\nfor adults, the entire distribution of BMI is shifted\nupward in NHANES III relative to NHANES II.\nHowever, these plots show that this is not a uniform\nshift across the whole distribution.\nThe degree of these changes in the distribution\ndiffers by age. For younger children and to some\nextent for adolescents, the lower portion of the dis-\ntribution seems to be anchored with no substantive\nchange over time. In these age groups, the principal\neffect is increased positive skewness at the upper part\nof the distribution. For younger men (aged 20 \u00b1 49 y)\nthe principal change is also increased positive skew-\nness at the upper part of the distribution, but there is in\naddition a slight upward shift that tends to be small\nand fairly consistent. The differences in the lower\nportion of the distribution are small ( ` 1 BMI unit).\nFor older men (aged 50 \u00b1 74 y). however, the upward\nshift is more pronounced and the shift at the upper\nend, indicating skewness, less pronounced. For\nwomen, there is a more gradual increase across the\nentire distribution, suggesting both an upward shift\nand increasing positive skewness.\nTaken together, these observations suggest that for\nadults some factors causing increases in BMI are\naffecting the entire distribution of BMI, although the\nchanges in the distribution of BMI are most marked at\nthe upper end of the distributions. These plots show\nChanges in distribution of BMI in US\nKM Flegal and RP Troiano\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nFigure 7 Mean \u00b1 difference plots for the distribution of body mass index from NHANES II and NHANES III, for adults aged 20 \u00b1 74 y, by\nsex and age group. The 10th, 50th and 90th percentiles are marked by a  sign.\nChanges in distribution of BMI in US\nKM Flegal and RP Troiano\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nthat for adults in all age \u00b1 sex groups, almost the entire\ndistribution of BMI appears to have shifted upward\nto some extent in NHANES III compared with the\ncorresponding distributions in NHANES II. Thus\nthese \u00aendings do not suggest that the increases in\nmean BMI and in the prevalence of BMI ! 30.0 in\nNHANES III, relative to NHANES II, are due solely\nto the heaviest people in NHANES III being heavier\nthan the heaviest people in NHANES II. For adults,\nthere is no part of the distribution that is clearly\nunresponsive to the in\u00afuences that are causing the\npopulation increase in BMI and the prevalence of\nobesity. For older men there is almost a complete shift\nof the distribution.\nThese \u00aendings suggest that the causes for the\nincrease in obesity should be sought in part at the\npopulation level rather than focusing on individuals.\nFrom the perspective of individual behaviors, changes\nin physical activity, energy intake and smoking initia-\ntion or cessation may lead to changes in energy\nbalance and thus to the increases in overweight and\nobesity. However, these changes in behaviors are\nlikely to be related to social and environmental\nchanges that may affect the whole population. Accord-\ning to Rose, to \u00aend the determinants of prevalence and\nincidence rates, we need to study characteristics of\npopulations, not of individuals.4 The social and envir-\nonmental causes of changes in BMI are unclear but\nmight include increased availability of food, changes\nin food composition, changes in patterns of food\nintake, fewer opportunities for physical activity,\nincreased use of labor-saving devices, changes in\ncigarette smoking, and perhaps also changes in cul-\ntural and social attitudes and values that might directly\nor indirectly affect body weight.18 \u00b1 20\nThe changes observed in the US affect the popula-\ntion broadly enough that they appear unlikely to be\ndue to the effects on the population of immigration\nand emigration. Nor are they likely to be due to trends\nin the race \u00b1 ethnic composition of the US population.\nThe increases in the prevalence of overweight are as\nlarge or larger for non-Hispanic white children and\nadults than for other subgroups.1 \u00b1 3 When the analyses\nwere repeated limiting the sample to white children\nand adults, the general \u00aendings were unchanged.\nThese changes might represent either a differential\nresponse to changing environmental conditions, or a\nsubset increasingly exposed to changing environmen-\ntal conditions, or possibly some combination of\ndifferential exposure and differential response. These\ndata do not permit these effects to be disentangled.\nHowever, these \u00aendings are not inconsistent with a\ngene \u00b1 environment interaction effect. The factors that\nare causing the increase in obesity appear to operate\nbroadly and have an effect on the distribution of BMI\nfor almost the entire adult population, but to have a\nstronger effect on the upper portion of the distribution,\nsuggesting there may be a subgroup of the population\nthat is more susceptible to these in\u00afuences. These data\nalso broadly support Rose's suggestion that changes in\nthe upper portion of the distribution re\u00afect changes\noccurring in the whole distribution.5\nThis interpretation is less true for children, how-\never. For children, particularly younger children, and\nto some extent also for adolescents and young men,\nthe main effect appears to be on the upper part of the\ndistribution of BMI. This suggests that, for these\ngroups, the increase in prevalence is chie\u00afy due to\nthe heaviest individuals being heavier in NHANES III\nthan were the heaviest individuals in earlier surveys.\nThis is consistent with Price's \u00aendings for secular\ntrends in overweight among young Danish inductees,\nin which BMI could be modeled as a mixture of\ndistributions of a `normal' and `overweight' compo-\nnent.14 Secular trends in overweight among young\nDanish men could be explained by an increase in the\nproportion in the overweight component, with no\nchange in the mean of either the normal or the over-\nweight component, leading to the speculation that the\nincreases in overweight might represent a differential\nresponse to environmental change, possibly mediated\nby genotype. Although methodological differences\npreclude exact comparisons, our \u00aendings for children,\nadolescents and young men, showing only small or no\nshifts in the lower part of the distribution but with a\nmuch larger shift in the upper portion of the distribu-\ntion, are consistent with the notion of a differential\nresponse in these age groups. For older men, however,\nour data suggest a more uniform response affecting all\nportions of the distribution.\nMany investigations of BMI phenotypes suggest\nthat BMI can often be modeled as a mixture of several\ncomponents, although \u00aendings about the number and\ncharacteristics of these components vary from study\ntions of BMI, which appear to vary by sex and age,\nmay affect such phenotypic comparisons of BMI and\ncould make it more dif\u00aecult to \u00aend stable models for\nRose and Day examined cross-sectional data on\nblood pressure, BMI, alcohol intake and sodium\nintake from 52 populations in the Intersalt study and\nfound that the distributions of most health related\ncharacteristics appeared to move up and down as a\nwhole so that the population mean predicted the\nnumber of deviant individuals.5 In the case of BMI,\nhowever, the distributions of BMI in the populations\nwith higher values were not only shifted upward but\nalso tended to become more skewed.6 This increasing\nskewness is similar to that seen in the NHANES data\nfor adults, where small increases in mean and median\nBMI values are accompanied by greater than expected\nincreases in the prevalence of high values because of\nthe increasing skewness.\nWithin a given population, differences in character-\nistics such as serum cholesterol probably re\u00afect prin-\ncipally genetic variability with some effects of be-\nhavioral differences. However, the large differences\nseen between populations in characteristics such as\nserum cholesterol suggest profound effects of social\nChanges in distribution of BMI in US\nKM Flegal and RP Troiano\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nand environmental determinants of such characteris-\ntics. The environment includes not just the physical\nenvironment, but also social and cultural forces affect-\ning work, leisure, time allocation, food patterns and\navailability, psychological factors and many other\ndeterminants. These trends in BMI suggest the com-\nbination of both profound environmental determinants\nat work and a population with a high degree of\nsusceptibility. Following the line of thought put\nforth by Rose,4 \u00b1 6 this would imply that the reasons\nfor the increasing prevalence of obesity should be\nsought not by comparing obese and non-obese indi-\nviduals but rather by seeking to understand what\nfactors are causing increases in the population as a\nwhole. Interventions may need to focus on the popu-\nlation rather than solely on the heaviest individuals.\nReferences\n1 Kuczmarski RJ, Flegal KM, Campbell SM, Johnson CL.\nIncreasing prevalence of overweight among US adults.
