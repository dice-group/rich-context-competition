Quinn, PhD,2 and Michael Kozy, MA2\nThere is considerable concern among policy ana-\nlysts about the economic well-being of future gener-\nations of American retirees. Important demographic\nchanges are underway, including a dramatic aging of\nthe population and an increase in the proportion of\nelderly Americans who are minorities. Both are\ncauses of concern -- the first because of the financial\nstrains population aging will impose on Social Secu-\nrity, employer pensions, and Medicare, and the lat-\nter because minorities of all ages are disproportion-\nately at risk of poverty (see Appendix, Note 1). One\nway in which society might adjust to the problems on\nthe horizon is to encourage older Americans to work\nlonger than they now do. If this happens, there are\nreasons to believe that much of the extended work\nlife will occur on jobs other than the individuals'\ncareer jobs.\nThe purpose of this article is twofold: (1) to de-\nscribe the retirement patterns of the early 1990s,\nusing the first wave of the new Health and Retire-\nment Study (HRS; Juster & Suzman, 1995), and (2) to\nask whether these patterns of labor market disen-\ngagement appear to differ between the white major-\nity and minority populations more at risk; specifi-\ncally, blacks and Hispanics.\nConsiderable research has established that for\nmany Americans retirement is a process, not a single\nevent. Many older workers use one or more transi-\ntional stages -- bridge jobs -- between career em-\nployment and complete labor force withdrawal.

Both increase dramatically with age. Al-\npart time (fewer than 35 hours per week), 12% of\nover half of those still working after age 70 (see\nAppendix, Note 2). Among employed women, part-\ntime work is more prevalent at all ages, but the age\ndifferentials are similar. About 20% of employed\nall working women aged 65 or older. Over 85% of\nthose aged 60 or older who work part time say they\nare doing so voluntarily, and this proportion also\nrises with age.\nSelf-employment in the United States also increases\nsteadily with age, with a large jump at age 65. Nearly a\nquarter of employed (nonagricultural) men aged 65\nemployed, compared to less than 8% of employed\nmen aged 16-54. For women, the proportion self-\nemployed is smaller at all ages. It jumps from less than\nthat self-employment is more common among older\nworkers is that those already self-employed in their\ncareer jobs tend to retire later than do wage and salary\nworkers. In addition, however, some people turn to\nself-employment late in life, often as a means of grad-\nSome of these part-time and self-employment jobs\nare bridge jobs between career work and retirement.\nThe importance of bridge jobs is likely to increase in\nthe future, as the population ages, as life expectan-\ncies continue to increase, and as public and private\nsector retirement incentives diverge. The number of\nAmericans aged 65 or older is projected to double by\ncreases by two-thirds. In stark contrast, the number\nunder 55 will remain almost unchanged. As a result,\nthe percentage of Americans aged 65 and over will\nwith most of the increase occurring between 2010\nand 2030. By then, a third of the U.S. population will\nbe 55 or older, and the median age will have risen\nThe older population of the future will be much\nmore diverse racially and ethnically than are current\nretirees. Although the older (65 + ) white population\nthe older black population will increase by almost\n250% and the older Hispanic population by nearly\n400%. The proportion of the elderly who are minority\nwill increase from about 15% today to a quarter by\nCurrently, elderly Hispanics are twice as likely and\nelderly blacks three times as likely to be poor as are\nelderly whites. For all groups, those elderly individ-\nuals who are still working are much less likely to be\npoor than those already out of the labor force (U.S.\nBureau of the Census, 1992). Clearly, the issues of\nlabor force activity, race and ethnicity, and economic\nwell-being among the elderly are closely intertwined.\nPublic policy initiatives are also important. At the\nfederal level, changes are underway to encourage (or\nat least to stop discouraging) work by older Ameri-\ncans. Mandatory retirement has been virtually elimi-\nnated, Social Security's normal retirement age is\nscheduled to increase from 65 to 66 and eventually to\n67, the amount of money that Social Security recipi-\nents can earn without reducing their benefits has\nbeen increased, and the reward for delaying benefit\nreceipt beyond the normal retirement age (the de-\nlayed retirement credit) is on the rise. Some analysts\nhave proposed that the normal retirement age be\nincreased more quickly and further than currently\nlegislated, to 68 and then beyond, indexed to longev-\nity, and that early eligibility for Social Security retire-\nment benefits be delayed from age 62 to 65 (Mitchell\nAt the same time that these changes in federal\npolicies are encouraging additional work, many em-\nployers, through their defined-benefit private pen-\nsion plans, continue to penalize work beyond partic-\nular ages. They do so with benefit calculation rules\nthat reduce a worker's pension wealth (the present\nvalue of expected pension benefits) with additional\nyears on the job (see Appendix, Note 3). This contra-\ndictory combination of public and private sector pol-\nicies (encouraging work by older Americans, but not\non their career jobs) may make gradual retirement\nvia bridge jobs even more prevalent than it is today.\nRational workers may leave their career jobs when\nthe pension incentives dictate, but continue working\nwith another employer or on their own.\nTo anticipate the issues facing future retirees, we\nmust foresee the retirement trends and patterns of\nthe future and understand the influence of public\npolicy on them. To do so, it is important to under-\nstand the exit patterns of today. How common are\nbridge jobs in the 1990s? Who is likely to use them,\nand why? Are there differences in labor force with-\ndrawal patterns by race and ethnicity, differences\nthat might accentuate poverty risks late in life?\nMuch of our current knowledge about the retire-\nment process is based on the Retirement History\nStudy (RHS; Irelan, 1972), an outstanding but now\noutdated survey of older Americans aged 58 to 63\ndecades ago. Because the RHS contained no married\nwomen as primary respondents and had no over-\nsampling, we know much more about the retire-\nment pattern of white men than we do about wom-\nen or minorities. The new Health and Retirement\nStudy (HRS) represents a significant improvement on\nthe RHS and a great opportunity to update and ex-\npand what we know. The HRS is current and much\nmore sophisticated than the RHS, it includes men\nand women as primary respondents, and it oversam-\nples blacks and Hispanics to increase their sample\nsizes.\nIn this article, we report preliminary findings from\nthe initial wave (1992) of the HRS on the nature of\nretirement in the early 1990s by gender, race and\nethnicity, and type of work (wage and salary vs self-\nemployment). We focus on the use of bridge jobs\nbetween full-time career employment and complete\nlabor force withdrawal. We review briefly the litera-\nture on retirement transitions, define the sample we\nhave chosen for analysis, present the results, and\ndraw some preliminary conclusions.\nSeveral authors have focused on the nature of the\nretirement process, with emphasis on the transi-\ntional stages of partial or gradual retirement. Gust-\nman and Steinmeier (1984), using the RHS and a\nsubjective definition of \"partial retirement\" pro-\nvided by the survey respondents themselves, found\npartial retirement to be widespread in the early\n1970s, even among those in good health and not\nsubject to mandatory retirement or employer pen-\nsion incentives. They estimated that about one-third\nof white males would become partially retired at\nsome time during their working lives, and found that\npartial retirement usually involved a job change.\nHonig and Hanoch (1985) used the RHS and an\nobjective definition of partial retirement, real annual\nearnings less than half the individual's highest real\nannual earnings. They also found that partial retire-\nment was important and that it tended to increase\nwith age: 8% of white married men aged 60 were\npartially retired, as were 14% of those aged 62 and\nsimilar results with the RHS sample of nonmarried\nwomen, one of a few studies of women. Partial retire-\nment was quantitatively important for these women,\nthough less so than for men, and was of significant\nduration.\nyears of the RHS and focused on exit routes from\ncareer jobs, defined as full-time jobs held for at least\n10 years. They disaggregated the RHS sample by\ngender and type of work, but not by race or ethnicity.\nAs suggested by the prior research, they found that\nmany older Americans did not follow the stereotypi-\ncal retirement route; that is, they did not leave full-\ntime status on their career jobs and the labor force in\none move. Among male wage and salary workers,\nmore than a quarter did something else. Most of\nthem found a new job, evenly distributed between\nfull time and part time. The percentage \"nontradi-\ntional\" was about the same for wage and salary (non-\nmarried) women, although most of those who stayed\nin the labor force moved to part-time work.\nThe self-employed followed very different retire-\nment patterns, probably because they have more\ncontrol over the amount and kind of work they do\nwent directly from their full-time career job to com-\nplete retirement (Quinn et al., 1990). Those who did\nnot were evenly split between part-time employment\non their own career jobs (an option rarely found in\nthe wage and salary sector) and part-time or full-time\nwork on a new job.\nIn the 1970s, these transitional jobs generally\nlasted long enough to be interesting to researchers.\nOf those older workers who switched employers,\nnearly 60% were still working two years later. Most\nbridge jobs were in different occupations and indus-\ntries, and most involved some movement down the\nsocioeconomic ladder; for example, from skilled to\nunskilled or from white collar to blue collar. There\nwas some evidence that those at the ends of the\neconomic spectrum -- the rich and the poor -- were\nthe most likely to use nontraditional retirement\nroutes (Quinn et al., 1990). The poor may be forced\nto do so because they lack pension coverage and\npersonal savings and often are eligible for only mod-\nest Social Security benefits. The rich may do so sim-\nply because they want to, enjoying interesting jobs\nwith important nonpecuniary benefits.\ncareer job as the longest job held, and again found\nthat postcareer jobs were an important part of the\nretirement process in the 1970s. For example, of\nthose who left their longest job between the ages of\nbetween ages 65 and 69, nearly a quarter continued\nto work.\nThe consensus from this literature is that partial or\ngradual retirement, defined in a number of ways, was\nan important part of the retirement transition for a\nsignificant minority of older Americans in the 1970s.\nBut what has happened since then? One early\nglimpse is provided by Ruhm (1995), who used data\nNot surprisingly, he found much lower age-specific\nis the well-documented early retirement trend. But\nhe continued to find substantial bridge employment,\nwith about a third of the men employed in 1989\nworking on postcareer transitional jobs.\nRetirement routes in America are many and varied,\nand the stereotypical exit from full-time work to full-\ntime leisure is only a part of the story. Many older\nAmericans (although a minority) continue to work\nafter they leave their career jobs, often part time\nand usually on a new job and in a new line of work.\nFor some, this new line of work involves self-\nemployment. The new HRS allows us to update our\nknowledge and expand it to minority populations.\nData and Sample\nand women in about 8,000 households. The age-\nsome spouses were older or younger. The HRS con-\ntains detailed information on the individuals' demo-\ngraphic background, health and disability status,\nhousing, family structure and intrafamily transfers,\ncurrent and previous employment and some earlier\njob history, retirement plans (for those still working),\nhealth and life insurance coverage, income, and\nwealth.\nBecause we are focusing on the retirement transi-\ntion, we have excluded all those with no work experi-\nence after age 49, leaving us with a sample of about\n9,500 individuals. Our race/ethnicity categories are\nHispanic, black, and white (see Appendix, Note 4).\nTable 1 shows the distribution by gender and race/\nethnicity. The unweighted sample is 55% male, and\nbers overstate the proportions of blacks and Hispan-\nics in the population, because these groups were\nintentionally oversampled. When sample weights\nare applied, the male/female ratio stays the same, but\nthe race/ethnicity ratios change to 83% white, 11%\nblack, and 6% Hispanic.\nAn important variable in any study of retirement is\nage, because large behavioral changes are observed\npension and Social Security regulations. Table 2\nshows the age distributions for our sample. Note that\nthere are more men than women aged 62 or older,\nTable 1.

Blacks and Hispanics have lower levels of\neducation, lower wages, and jobs with lower socio-\neconomic status than do whites. A quarter of the\nwhite men in this sample have a college degree,\ncompared to only 10% of the black and Hispanic\nmen. Among women, the differences are less dra-\nmatic; the analogous proportions are 18,14, and 7%\n(see Appendix, Note 5).\nAs would be expected given the educational differ-\nences, the male wage distributions differ by race and\nethnicity. Well over half of the employed Hispanic\nmen and over 40% of the black men earn below $10/\nhour, compared to less than 30% of the white men.\nThe women in this sample tend to earn less than the\nmen, especially when they are not disaggregated by\nfull-time/part-time status. The wage distributions for\nwhite and black women are remarkably similar, given\nthe educational differences, and are higher than for\nthe Hispanic women.\nA similar story appears in the occupational distri-\nbutions. Whites are about twice as likely to hold\nmanagerial, professional, technical, sales, and ad-\nministrative jobs than are either blacks or Hispanics,\nand this is true for men and for women. Black and\nHispanic men, on the other hand, are much more\nlikely to be operators, fabricators, and laborers.\nOver 40% of these black women and over a third of\nthe Hispanic women are service workers (which in-\ncludes private household and personal service occu-\npations), compared to only 17% of the white women.\nThe net result of these socioeconomic differences\non retirement patterns is unclear. As mentioned ear-\nlier, prior research suggests that those at the ends of\nthe socioeconomic spectrum were the most likely to\nuse nontraditional retirement patterns in the 1970s.\nWhites tend to be the most well-off, and blacks and\nHispanics are overrepresented among those least\nwell-off.\nHealth is another very important variable in the\nretirement literature, and one with significant differ-\nences by race and ethnicity. Whites in this sample are\nmuch more likely than either blacks or Hispanics to\ndescribe their health as excellent or very good, and\nmuch less likely to report fair or poor. For example,\nless than 15% of the whites claimed their health was\nfair or poor, compared to almost 30% of the blacks\nand Hispanics.\nResults and Discussion\nCurrent Labor Force Status\nOne focus of this research is the prevalence of\npart-time work as a transitional stage between full-\ntime career employment and complete labor force\nwithdrawal. The definition of part time is arbitrary.\nWe choose to define it relatively narrowly, less than\n1,600 hours per year, lest we discover bridge jobs\nthat are really not there. This definition of part time\nexcludes someone working 35 hours per week (the\nstandard definition of a minimum full-time week) for\n46 or more weeks per year, someone working 40\nhours per week for as few as 40 weeks (e.g., a con-\nstruction worker with some weeks off between jobs),\nor someone reporting as few as 31 hours per week\nfor the full 52 weeks of the year (including weeks of\npaid vacation). When we looked at those working\njust below full time by this definition (between 1,400\nand 1,600 hours per year), we found that a large\nproportion (primarily women) were in the education\nindustry (mostly in elementary and secondary\nschools; a few in colleges and universities), report-\ning full-time hours per week but just for the aca-\ndemic year. This is certainly not part-time, retire-\nment-transition work in the sense we mean, so we\nhave included in our definition of full-time 111 indi-\nviduals in the education industry with annual hours\nTable 3 shows the current employment status of\nthe sample. Overall, 78% were working at the time of\nthe following figures are based on weighted data).\nBlacks and Hispanics were more likely to be without\na job than were whites. Among those working, white\nmen were the most likely to be self-employed; a\nquarter were, compared to 18 and 14% of blacks and\nHispanics, respectively. The proportion of women\nwho were self-employed was significantly lower than\nthat of men. Finally, there were large differences in\nfull-time/part-time status by gender, but only modest\nones by race and ethnicity. White men were slightly\nmore likely to be working full time than either blacks\nor Hispanics, while blacks were the most likely to be\nfull time among the women (see Appendix, Note 6).\nWhen annual hours per year are calculated, two\ndifferences stand out. Black and Hispanic men were\nmuch more likely than white men to work the stand-\ntively, compared to only about a third of the white\nmen. Most of the difference appears in the highest\nannual hours categories. White men in this sample\nand more than 2,500 hours per year. To some extent,\nthis reflects the larger proportion of self-employed,\nwho traditionally report long hours, but the differ-\nence remains within the wage and salary population\nas well.\nIn Figure 1, we categorize all individuals as either\nworking full time, working part time, or not working,\ndisaggregate by age, gender, and race/ethnicity. The\ngeneral decline in full-time employment with age\nand the analogous increase in the proportion of\nthose not working can be seen for all groups, espe-\ncially at the key Social Security ages of 62 and 65. The\nage-specific data on part-time work are erratic, re-\nflecting the small number of blacks and Hispanics in\nthis category when the sample is also disaggregated\nby gender and age.\nBlacks approaching the age of initial Social Secu-\nrity eligibility (ages 55-61) are less likely to be work-\ning full time and more likely to be without a job than\nwhites. The experience of the smaller number of\nHispanics tends to fall in between. Part-time work is\nmore important for these women than for the men,\nbut there are no consistent patterns by race/ethnicity\n(see Appendix, Note 7). Whether these part-time\njobs are part of a retirement transition or reflect a\ncareer of part-time employment remains to be seen.\nThe self-descriptions of those who are not cur-\nrently employed differ significantly by gender and\nage. The youngest men without a job are about\nevenly distributed among retired, disabled, and\nunemployed/laid off (Figure 2). The proportion de-\nscribing themselves as \"retired\" increases steadily\nthe proportion \"unemployed\" drops from about\none-third to only 2% by age 62. The \"disabled\" self-\ndescription stays important (25-30%) through ages\nwomen without a job, \"homemaker\" and \"retired\"\nare the most common self-descriptions, with the\nsum rising from about half (at ages 50-54) to three-\nquarters (at ages 60-61), and then even higher for the\nsmall number of women aged 62 and over.\nThese data suggest that health and labor market\ndifficulties may be important in explaining the\n(sometimes involuntary) labor force status of the\nyounger members of this sample. For older workers,\nhowever, voluntary departures and, we suspect, the\nimportance of specific retirement incentives are\nlikely to dominate.\nThe Process of Retirement\nThe primary focus of this research is on how older\nworkers exit the labor force. We will describe this for\ntwo samples, all those with work experience after age\n49 (the sample used thus far), and then the subset for\nwhom we can identify a full-time career job.\nWe have defined a full-time career job as one that a\nworker has held for 10 or more years, on which he or\nshe is working full time. A bridge job, therefore,\ncould be a part-time job of any duration or a full-time\njob of less than 10 years' duration.\nOne problem is that some full-time workers are on\njobs that currently look like short-duration bridge\njobs, but that will turn out to be career jobs (that is,\nwith tenure of 10 or more years) by the time the\nworkers eventually leave them. A likely case would\nbe a 51-year-old with 9 years tenure on a full-time\njob. It is highly unlikely that this will turn out to be a\nbridge job by our definition, although it would be\ndefined as one at the time of the survey. One pur-\npose of this research is to derive some early esti-\nmates of the importance of bridge jobs in the retire-\nment processes of the 1990s. Because a majority of\nthe sample has not yet retired, we have to make\nsome assumptions about future behavior in order to\nderive these estimates. To use current tenure implic-\nitly assumes that all workers are just about to leave\ntheir jobs. This is a poor oversimplification and\nwould lead to an overestimate of bridge job activity.\nA better oversimplification, and the one we adopt\nhere, is to assume that full-time workers remain on\ntheir current jobs until age 62. We pick age 62 be-\nTable 3.

Source: Health and Retirement Study Wave II (see Juster & Suzman,\ncause it is the most important single age of retire-\nment transition (see Appendix, Note 8). We then\nclassify the jobs as career or bridge depending on\ntheir (assumed) eventual tenure. This may lead to an\nunderestimate of bridge job activity, because we\nmiss those who will leave before age 62 with less than\n10 years' tenure, but who would have had 10 years or\nmore had they actually stayed until 62. At this stage,\nwe adopt a conservative stance, preferring to under-\nestimate than overestimate the importance of the\nbridge job phenomenon. Of course, these problems\nwill disappear as the sample ages and retires in future\nwaves of the HRS.\nSome workers, of course, have already left the\nlabor force or are employed part time. We can and\ndo describe how they got where they are. The prob-\nlem here is that these workers are not a random\nsample of the population (they tend to be people\nwho left their career jobs early) and therefore do not\nnecessarily provide accurate estimates of what the\nentire population will do. Again, subsequent waves\nof the HRS will eliminate this problem.\nCurrent Job Status and History. -- Figures 3 and 4\nrespondents with work experience after age 49.\nNearly 60% of the men are currently working on what\nis or what will become a career job (Figure 3).

Of those working on full-time but short-\nduration jobs, nearly all were full time previously.\nWhen we look back in time at the 23% of men\nwithout a job in 1992, about two-thirds had left di-\nrectly from a career job, and a third last worked on a\nbridge job.\nThe experiences of the women in this sample are\nvery different, and statistically so at the .01 level\n(Figure 4). Although the proportion of women not\nworking is almost identical to that of the men, the\nworking women are less likely to be employed on a\nfull-time career job (49% versus 59% of males) and\nmuch more likely to be on a bridge job (28% versus\n16%). Those not working are much more likely to\nhave last worked on a bridge job (two-thirds did\nversus one-third of the men). In all cases, a higher\nproportion of the women's bridge jobs were part\ntime (rather than short duration) than was the case\nfor the men.\nThere are some statistically significant differences\nby race/ethnicity in addition to those noted in Table\n3. Bridge jobs are more common among Hispanic\nmen than among white or black men. For example, of\nthose not working, 54% of Hispanic men last worked\non a bridge job, compared to only about one-third of\nwhites and blacks. Of those currently working on a\npart-time job, one-fifth of the Hispanic men also\nnot working\nFigure 3. Current job status, males. N* = weighted observa-\ntions.

For\nsome, in fact, employment may be a series of\n\"bridge-like jobs\" that may or may not signify any-\nthing about retirement transition (see next section).\nAlthough bridge jobs are more important for\nwomen than for men, they are less important for\nblack women than for either white or Hispanic\nwomen. Only 23% of these black women are on\nbridge jobs, compared to about 30% of the whites\nand Hispanics. Of the women without a job, only\n59% of the black women came from a bridge job,\ncompared to 68 and 75% of the whites and Hispanics.\nHow much bridge job activity do we observe in this\nsnapshot? Among the approximately one-quarter of\nthe sample not working, a great deal -- about one-\nthird of the men and two-thirds of the women with-\nout a job -- last worked on a bridge job. Among the\napproximately three-quarters who are still working,\nthere is also considerable bridge job activity -- one-\nfifth of the employed men and one-third of the em-\nployed women are working on jobs that are either\npart time or will have less than 10 years' duration\neven if they work until age 62. If our \"age 62\" as-\nsumption turns out to be true for everyone, 25% of\nthe men and 40% of the women in this sample will\nhave last worked on a bridge job when they leave the\nlabor force. Although calculation of the exact pro-\nportion must await later waves of the HRS, it is clear\nthat the proportion will represent a significant mi-\nnority of the population.\nCareerJob Status. -- For some workers, life may be\na series of part-time or short-duration jobs. If so, the\nones observed late in life may not represent any\nchange in the pattern, and we might be misled into\nseeing retirement transition when none in fact exists.\nWe would certainly not describe a part-time or short-\nduration job at age 35 as evidence of gradual retire-\nment; for some, we should be careful of doing so at\nlater ages as well.\nTo concentrate on those for whom a bridge job\nwould represent a change, we focus here on only\nthose for whom we can identify a full-time career job,\nand then observe the transitions from these jobs. By\nlooking at current, last, and prior jobs, we can iden-\ntify a full-time career job for 86% of the (weighted)\nmen and 63% of the (weighted) women with work\nexperience after age 49. Among the men, we lose a\nmuch higher percentage of the blacks (19%) and the\nHispanics (30%) than we do the whites (13%); among\nthe women, we lose nearly half of the Hispanics but\nonly about one-third of the whites and blacks.\nIn Figures 5 and 6, we describe the transition status\nas of 1992 of these \"career\" men and women, assum-\ning again that all those currently working full time\nwill continue to do so until age 62. The vast majority\nwere still working on their career jobs in 1992, and\nwe will follow their departure patterns over time. Of\nthose who had left their career jobs, however, nearly\nhalf moved to a bridge job rather than directly out of\nthe labor force, and the proportions were nearly\nidentical for career men and women. The differences\nby race were also much smaller than were observed\nin the larger sample. It is too early to draw strong\nconclusions from these early movers, but the data do\nsuggest that bridge job activity is important even\namong those with long-term career jobs, that much\nof the difference between the withdrawal patterns of\nmen and women is due to the lower proportion of\nwomen with a full-time, long-duration career job,\nand that some of the differences observed by race/\nethnicity are due to the differential likelihood of\nhaving a career job late in life.\nWage and Salary Versus Self-Employed Workers. --\nIn Figures 7 and 8, we disaggregate the career sample\nin another way, to see whether there are differences\nin the transition patterns of wage and salary (W&S)\nand self-employed (SE) workers, and whether work-\ners switch status on the way out.\nAs expected, career wage and salary workers were\nsignificantly more likely to be out of the labor force;\ncareer self-employed.

Source: Health and Retirement Study Wave I (see Juster &\nactivity (among those with a transition) was about the\nsame for the two groups, and both exhibited consid-\nerable cross-over. Of the career wage and salary\nworkers already on another job, more than a quarter\nhad moved to self-employment, as did 10% of those\nwho used a bridge job on the way out (Figure 7).\nThese may be workers searching for a new line of\nwork or the flexible hours unavailable on their career\njobs. Of the much smaller number of career self-\nemployed who switched jobs, over half moved to a\nwage and salary job. Despite this higher proportion,\nthere is a net influx into self-employment because of\nthe much higher number of wage and salary workers.\nSummary\nThe results from the 1992 wave of the HRS can only\nsuggest what the longitudinal data will reveal, but the\npreliminary results are intriguing.\n\u00b7 There is a wide variety of retirement behaviors\nto be studied, even within narrowly defined age\ngroups.\n\u00b7 Bridge jobs continue to provide an important\nintermediate step in the retirement processes of a\nsignificant minority of older Americans.\n\u00b7 Despite cross-overs in both directions, there is a\nstill on career job\ncareer - bridge \u00b7 out\nFigure 7.

Although the majority do leave their\ncareer jobs and the labor market simultaneously, a\nsignificant minority use bridge jobs to retire more\ngradually. Second careers are a common phenome-\nnon. As the nation ages and as changes in federal\npolicy, including Social Security, reduce the work\ndisincentives facing older Americans, these rich and\nvaried retirement routes are likely to become all the\nmore prevalent and important.\nstill on career job\ncareer - bridge - out\nFigure 8.

In this initial HRS\nwave, Hispanic men are more likely than other men\nto be on a bridge job or to have last worked on a\nbridge job; among women, blacks are the least likely\nto have done so. The implications of this are as yet\nunclear.\n\u00b7 Hispanic men and women and black men are\nmore likely than the other groups to have a series of\njobs with \"bridge\" characteristics, suggesting cau-\ntion when interpreting a bridge job, even late in life,\nReferences\nFuchs, V.

A recent review of current demographic and labor\nmarket trends, and their implications for the economic\nwell-being of future retirees, can be found in Mitchell\nThese numbers are based on unpublished Bureau of\nLabor Statistics data on the nonagricultural workforce\nthat include more age detail than is available in the\ntables published in Employment and Earnings.\nThis occurs when the future benefit increases that\nfollow additional years of work on the job are insuffi-\ncient to make up for the pension benefits initially\nforegone. For a discussion of these financial incentives\nand their effects, see Quinn and Burkhauser (1994).\nThese categories are derived from 2 HRS questions.\nIndividuals are asked whether they consider themselves\nHispanic or Latino, and then whether they consider\nthemselves White/Caucasian, Black/African American,\nAmerican Indian or Alaskan Native, Asian or Pacific\nIslander, or Other. We categorized all those who an-\nswered \"yes\" to the Hispanic/Latino question as His-\npanic, and (almost all) the rest as either black or white.\nThere are about 200 Asians and American Indians who\nconsider themselves neither black, white, nor Hispanic,\nand they are also excluded from this analysis.\nThe wide disparities within this Hispanic population\nstand out in the educational distributions. Over 40% of\nthese older Hispanics report having no more than an\n8th grade education (and over a third have only 0-7\nyears), while a very different 8% have college or post-\ngraduate degrees. About two-thirds of the Hispanics in\nthe sample are Mexican-Americans, 10% are Cubans,\n7% are Puerto-Rican, 6% are Spanish, and the remain-\nder are Central or South American or other.\n6. All these differences are statistically significant at the\nfull-time, part-time differences among the women.\n7. The full-time, part-time, not working differences are\nstatistically different at the 0.01 level for men; for\nwomen, the differences are only significant at the 0.10\nlevel.\n9. A small number (less than 2% of the men and 1 % of the\nwomen) did not provide enough information to deter-\nmine whether they were working full-time or part-\ntime, or what their current job tenure was.\n10. The HRS asked about prior jobs that lasted at least 5\nyears. Some of those with no prior job history may\nhave had prior jobs that lasted less than 5 years.\nA quarterly publication\nof the National Academy on Aging\nbringingyou the latest research and analysis\non the public policy implications of an aging society.\nRATES\nCanada & Mexico $35/yr.\nFAX or mail your name, address, phone number,\ncredit card number and expiration date.\nFor information, please call"
