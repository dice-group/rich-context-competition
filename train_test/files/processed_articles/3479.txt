Within gliomas, mi-\ncroglia/macrophages represent the largest tumor-infiltrating\ncell population, contributing by at least one-third to the to-\ntal tumor mass. Bi-directional interactions between glioma\ncells and microglia may therefore play an important role on\ntumor growth and biology. In the present study, we have\ncharacterized the influence of glioma-soluble factors on mi-\ncroglial function, comparing the effects of media harvested\nunder basal conditions with those of media obtained after\ninducing a pro-inflammatory activation state in glioma cells.\nWe found that microglial cells undergo a different pattern of\nactivation depending on the stimulus; in the presence of ac-\ntivated glioma-derived factors, i.e. a condition mimicking the\nlate stage of pathology, microglia presents as a mixture of\npolarization phenotypes (M1 and M2a/b), with up-regulation\nof iNOS (inducible nitric oxide synthase), ARG (arginase) and\nIL (interleukine)-10.

ASN NEURO\n Key words: arginase, glioma, IL-10, microglia, microglial\npolarization, mTOR, NOS.\nINTRODUCTION\nPrimary brain tumors represent approximately 2% of all adult\nneoplasia; of these, most common phenotype is the high-\ngrade malignant glioma (grade III\u00adIV by the World Health\nOrganization) (Wen and Kesari, 2008). Malignant gliomas\nare primary CNS (central nervous system) tumors, originat-\ning from glial cells and characterized by morphological and\ngenetic complexity as well as diffuse infiltration of tumor\ncells into the normal brain parenchyma (Rolle et al., 2012).\nL. Lisi and others\nCurrent therapeutic strategies (i.e., aggressive surgical resec-\ntion combined with radiation and chemotherapy) are largely\nineffective; patients have a life expectancy of 14 months\nfrom the initial diagnosis of GBM (glioblastoma multiforme),\nthe most aggressive glioma type of tumor (Stupp et al., 2005,\n2009). In fact, malignant gliomas remain at present among\nthe most lethal cancers (for a recent review Bradley and Rees,\n2014), and this underscores the need for novel and more ef-\nfective therapeutic approaches.\nIt has been widely shown that gliomas are histologically\nheterogeneous tumors, containing cancerous cells mostly de-\nrived from astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, but also stro-\nmal cells and a significant amount of different inflammatory\ncells; the latter have been found to significantly contribute\nto glioma cell growth and progression (Charles et al., 2012).\nAmong tumor-infiltrating cells, microglia/macrophages rep-\nresent the largest population of cells, contributing to at least\none-third of the total tumor mass (Carvalho da Fonseca and\nBadie, 2013). The percentage of microglia within the tu-\nmor positively correlates with the tumor grade, with the\nhighest proportion (78%) found in proliferative and high-\ngrade glioma (Roggendorf et al., 1996). Furthermore, the\nabundance of microglia is also positively related to can-\ncer invasiveness (Markovic et al., 2005). In the last decade,\na large number of experimental studies provided evidence\nfor a tumor-supporting role of microglia; on the opposite,\ndata in support of microglial anti-tumor properties have also\nbeen reported (Li and Graeber, 2012). Interestingly, the group\nof Seyfried hypothesized that some neoplastic cells within\nthe GBM arise from the transformed macrophage/microglia\n(Huysentruyt et al, 2011), further suggesting the tumor-\nsupporting hypothesis of microglia. However, the exact role\nof microglia in the biology of malignant gliomas remain to\nbe fully elucidated (Zhai et al., 2011).\nUnder pathological conditions microglia do not consti-\ntute a uniform cell population, but rather comprise a family\nof cells with diverse phenotypes, which may be associated to\nbeneficial or, on the contrary, to detrimental biological activ-\nities (Schwartz et al., 2006). Microglial-activated cells can be\nbroadly divided into classically activated M1 cells, with cy-\ntotoxic properties and alternatively activated M2 cells, with\nphagocytic activities. Furthermore, the M2 activation can be\nfurther divided into three classes: M2a, involved in repair\nand regeneration; M2b, an immune-regulatory phenotype;\nor M2c, an acquired-deactivating phenotype (Chhor et al.,\n2013). Each of these distinct microglia phenotypes has spe-\ncific inducers: Toll-like receptor-4 agonist LPS (lipopolysac-\ncharide), IFN (interferon ) and TNF (tumor necrosis factor\n) for M1; IL (interleukine)-4 and IL-13 for M2a; immune\ncomplexes and toll-like receptor agonists, as well as IL-1R\nligands for M2b; IL-10, TGF (transforming growth factor )\nand glucocorticoids for M2c (for a recent review, see Boche\net al., 2013). Several reports have shown that intra-tumoral\nmicroglia express an M2 phenotype in response to soluble\nfactors released by glioma cells. For example, Kaminska and\nco-workers have recently characterized the M2 activation\nstate of rat microglia cells exposed to a conditioned medium\nharvested by rat C6 glioma cell cultures as well as the molecu-\nlar pathways that direct microglia toward a pro-invasive and\nimmunosuppressive phenotype (Gabrusiewicz et al., 2011;\nEllert-Miklaszewska et al., 2013). Using co-cultures of the\nhuman microglia cell line CHME-5 and the rat glioma C6\ncells, Bouzier-Sore and co-workers showed that microglial\nactivation after exposure to C6 cells is bi-phasic, with a prior\ntransitory phagocytic activated phenotype (M2) followed by\na reversal to a non-phagocytic status (M1) (Voisin et al.,\n2010). Microglia express a variety of receptors on their sur-\nface, which can be activated by signals from glioma cells\nglioma cells produce cytokines, such as IL-10, IL-4, IL-6, TGF\nand prostaglandins E2 (Rolle et al., 2012). These factors are\nable to activate microglial cells; in particular, IL-4 causes al-\nternative activation (M2) of microglia (Gadani et al., 2012).\nMoreover, interactions between microglia and tumor cells\nare bi-directional (Galv~\nof glioma, microglia release several classes of molecules that\nfoster glioma growth, progression and inflammatory acti-\nvation (Li and Graeber, 2012). Activated microglia can also\nrelease inflammatory products, such as nitrites, IL-10 and\nurea, that may exert detrimental effects on glioma cells.\nA further factor of complexity comes from yet other cell\ntypes involved in multi-lateral communications. In fact ma-\nlignant gliomas can cause a disruption of the BBB (blood\u00ad\nbrain barrier), thus circulating immune cells not normally\nfound in the CNS gain access to the tumor areas (Zhan and\nLu, 2012). These include various types of T cells, macrophages\nand myeloid-derived suppressor cells that all together partic-\nipate in the response to tumor growth (Charles et al., 2012,\nKushchayev et al., 2012). These cells tend to secrete anti-\ninflammatory or pro-inflammatory cytokines, peptides and\nproteins that can directly activate glioma cells. Additionally,\nthe glioma is invaded or surrounded by reactive astrocytes,\nwhich contribute to the inflammatory milieu as well (Rivera-\nIn the present paper, we have compared the effects of\ndifferent conditioned medium on microglial cell biology.\nConditioned medium harvested from inflammatory activated\nglioma cells should better mimic the situation that is expected\nto be found in vivo at the moment that a malignant glioma\nis diagnosed, i.e. when bi-directional communications be-\ntween microglia and tumor cells are already well-established.\nFor the first time, here we show that microglial cell activa-\ntion undergoes a different fate depending on the stimulus\nused and, in presence of factors derived from the glioma-\nactivated cells, they express a distinctive phenotype. The lat-\nter is substantially different from the phenotype expressed\nby microglial cells exposed to CM (conditioned media) col-\nlected by glioma cells under basal conditions. In particular,\nboth CM-induced morphological changes in microglial cells,\nand increased cell viability and proliferation. However, while\nC-CM (control-conditioned media) tend to induce an M2b\npolarization of microglia, with production of free oxygen\n172 C 2014 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Licence (CC-BY) (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) which permits unrestricted use, distribution\nand reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nGlioma and microglial polarization\nradicals and a significant up-regulation of IL-10 gene expres-\nsion, CM obtained after glioma stimulation with LI-CM [LPS\n(lipopolysaccharide)\u00adIFN (interferon )-conditioned media]\ninduced a significant up-regulation of iNOS (inducible nitric\noxide synthase), ARG (arginase) and IL-10 gene expression,\nindicating the induction of a mixed polarization profile, i.e.\nboth M1 and M2a/b (mixture of polarization phenotypes)\nphenotypes.\nMaterials\nCell culture reagents [DMEM (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's\nmedium), DMEM-F12 and FBS] were from Invitrogen Cor-\nporation.

After a change of Paraplast Plus, tissue\nwas incubated in a 60C vacuum oven for 2 h prior to plac-\ning in molds to cool and solidify. Sections, 5-m thick, were\ncut and mounted. Sections were deparaffinized by drying on\nsuperfrost plus slides (Fisher), heating at 56C overnight, and\nthen washing through mixed xylenes, 100% ethanol, 95%\nethanol, ddHO. Slides were immersed in 10 mm citrate buffer,\npH 6.0, dry heated for 10 min each to unmask antigen sites,\nand then cooled and washed in PBS. Endogenous peroxidase\nactivity was inhibited by rinsing the slides in 3% hydro-\ngen peroxide for 5 min.

Data were analyzed by one-way\nANOVA followed by the Bonferroni's post hoc test. ***P < 0.001 versus Control,\nLPS, used as a positive control, induced a 1.5-fold increase in\nthe activation of mTOR, whereas the exposure to a medium\ncontaining 50% DMEM (1% FBS) reduced mTOR activation\nby roughly 50% (results not shown).\nA subsequent set of experiments was carried out to as-\nsess the effect of glioma CM on microglial pro-inflammatory\nactivity. First, we measured total levels of reactive species,\nboth nitrogen and oxygen-free radicals, using the fluores-\ncent probe H2\nDCF-DA (LeBel et al., 1992). Both CMs were\nable to increase total ROS (reactive oxygen species) levels\n(Figure 5A). However, the exposure of microglial cells to C-\nCM significantly increased the expression of iNOS (Figure 5C)\nwith no sizable effect on iNOS activity (Figure 5B), whereas\non the contrary LI-CM was found able to increase both iNOS\nexpression and enzyme activity (Figures 5B and 5C). Further-\nmore, LI-CM significantly increased the expression of dif-\nferent genes involved in both classic (M1) and alternative\n(M2) activation of microglial cells. In response to LI-CM, we\ndetected a significant up-regulation of the following genes:\nCD86, an M1/M2 polarization marker (Figure 6A); TNF- (Fig-\nure 6B) and IL-1 (Figure 6C), markers of M1 classic activa-\ntion; TGF (Figure 6D), an M2 marker; ARG (Figure 6E), an\nM2a polarization marker; and IL-10 (Figure 6F) a marker of\nthe M2b activation status. Conversely, C-CM mostly induced\na significant up-regulation of genes involved in the induc-\ntion of the alternative M2b activation phenotype, such as\nIL-10 (Figure 6F) and TGF (Figure 6D). Finally, C-CM had no\nstimulatory effect on ARG expression, whereas a 20% reduc-\ntion was observed after 24 h (Figure 6E).Taken together, these\ndata show that soluble factors from glioma cells promote mi-\ncroglial inflammatory activation, even though C-CM seems\nC 2014 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Licence (CC-BY) (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) which permits unrestricted use, distribution\nand reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nL.

As shown in Figure 7, a 24-h challenge\nwith LPS did not modify iNOS expression (A) and activity (B)\nin microglia pre-treated for 24 h with C-CM. Conversely, a\n24-h pretreatment with LI-CM was associated to a 3-fold\nincrease in iNOS expression, and a 2-fold increase in the\namount of nitrites, induced by LPS with respect to controls\n(Figure 7). In a further series of experiments, we investigated\nthe effects of C6-CMs pretreatment on COX (cyclooxygenase)\nisoforms gene expression. Pretreatment of microglial cells\nwith C-CM results in a selective up-regulation of constitutive\nCOX (COX1), but not COX-2, in response to LPS (Figure7C),\nwhereas on the contrary pre-incubation with LI-CM led to\nthe up-regulation of pro-inflammatory COX2, but not COX1\n(Figure 7D).\nFinally, sections of glioma tissue obtained from surgical\nresection of patients diagnosed with IV grade glioblastoma\n(GBM) were stained for CD68 (PG-M1 clone), a marker of\nphagocytic activity of macrophages/microglia (Boche et al.,\npositive cells was detected, thus supporting the hypothesis\nthat in vitro findings presented here might indeed occur in\nthe setting of human pathology.\nDISCUSSION\nIn the present study, we showed that media collected from\nboth basal and pre-activated C6 glioma cells induce morpho-\nlogical changes in microglia cells and increase cell viability\nand proliferation. However, while C-CM induced a specific\nM2b-type polarization of microglia, characterized mainly by\na significant up-regulation of IL-10 and TGF gene expres-\nsion; LI-CM harvested from pre-stimulated (LPS\u00adIFN) glioma\ncells led to a mixed phenotype, M1 and M2a/M2b, as indi-\ncated by the concurrent up-regulation of iNOS, TNF, IL-1,\nIncubation medium used for C6 cell cultures (DMEM with 1%\nFBS) differs from that used for microglia (DMEM-F12 with\n10% FBS); being the most important difference between\nthem the percentage of serum added to the medium, which\ncan directly affect cell viability as well as the response to\npro-inflammatory stimuli. Therefore one might expect that\nthe switch of the microglial cultures to a medium contain-\ning 50% of C6 cell incubation medium could per se induce\nmorphological changes. However, this is not the case since\nno significant differences were associated to the different\ntype of medium (Figures 2A, 2B, 2E and 2F). Therefore the\n50% C6 cell incubation medium was used as control in most\nof the experimental procedures.\nThe CM from activated C6 glioma cells were generated\nfollowing a more complex protocol (see the Method sec-\ntion), aimed to remove LPS and IFN from the media in order\nto avoid their direct effects on microglia.

Conversely, we considered\nthe C-CM experimental paradigm as an in vitro correlate of\nearly-stage glioma pathology, when glioma cells are seem-\ningly not yet activated.\nBoth C-CM and LI-CM increased microglia cell prolifer-\nation in a similar manner, suggesting the similar underly-\ning mechanisms, seemingly not involving pro-inflammatory\nmolecular pathways. Consistent with this hypothesis, Kamin-\nska and co-workers reported that glioma-derived solu-\nble factors induce the activation of focal adhesion ki-\nnase, PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)/Akt (protein kinase B),\nERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase), and P38 MAPK\n(mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling pathways, re-\nsulting in enhancement of cell motility, phagocytosis, sus-\ntained proliferation and a distinct genomic response. Such\nactivated microglial phenotype appeared to be unique, be-\ning not associated with activation of NFB (nuclear factor\nB) and Stat1 and thus up-regulation of inflammatory genes\nWe have recently demonstrated that mTOR kinase activa-\ntion is involved in microglial cell proliferation and viability\nunder basal conditions, as well as in pro-inflammatory ac-\ntivation in response to bacterial endotoxin or a mixture of\ninflammatory cytokines (Dello Russo et al., 2009).

Albeit in different amount, CD68 positive\ncells were found in all stained samples. Representative sections are shown 20\u00d7\nmTOR phosphorylation at Ser2448, albeit to a different extent.\nIn this regard, we have previously observed that the effect\nof LPS was more marked compared with cytokines on mTOR\nphosphorylation at Ser2448, suggesting that different stimuli\ncan induce a different level of mTOR phosphorylation, possi-\nbly because of different signaling mechanisms. Moreover, we\ncan speculate that different magnitudes of mTOR phospho-\nrylation can be associated to different pattern of microglial\nactivation. In support of this hypothesis, we observed that the\nhigher level of mTOR activation induced by LI-CM in compar-\nison with C-CM (or else to the direct effect of 1 ng/ml LPS)\nresulted in the activation of a larger array of inflammatory\nmediators. In particular, the exposure of microglial cells to\nC-CM, despite a modest albeit significant increase in iNOS ex-\npression (Figure 5C), did not modify iNOS activity (Figure 5B),\nwhereas it significantly increased IL-10 and TGF gene ex-\npression after 24 h (Figures 6F and 6D). Conversely, LI-CM was\nfound to increase both iNOS expression and the enzyme ac-\ntivity (Figures 5B and 5C), and was also able to increase other\nmarkers of M1 inflammatory activation, such as TNF and\nIL-1 (Figures 6B and 6C). However, LI-CM also significantly\nincreased the expression of ARG, IL-10 and TGF (Figures 6D\u00ad\n6F) as well as the expression of the M1/M2 marker CD86\n(Figure 6A). In this regard, Chhor et al. (2013) have previously\nshown that iNOS is a marker of M1 activation, ARG of M2a\nactivation and IL-10 of M2b activation. Therefore, our results,\nbased on this classification, suggest that C-CM is able to po-\nlarize the microglia cells mainly versus the M2b alternative\nstatus of activation, whereas LI-CM induces a switch toward\nalso showed that a pre-exposure of microglial cells to the\nM2a-inducing stimulus IL-4 before the LPS challenge failed\nto prevent the typical induction of M1 markers (COX2, iNOS).\nSimilarly, in our model the administration of LPS after LI-CM\n(i.e. an M2a-inducing condition) significantly increased COX2\ngene expression and both iNOS gene expression and activity.\nOn the other hand, a previous exposure to C-CM, taken as\nan M2b-inducing condition, prevented the typical effects of\nLPS, i.e. microglial expression of M1 markers. Similar find-\nings were also obtained by Hu et al.(2012) in focal cerebral\nischemia. Consistent with our data, Voisin et al. (2010) found\nthat 45% of the microglia appeared to be in a low phago-\ncytic state (M1) and 55% of the cells had a high capacity\nfor phagocytosis (M2) at the beginning of exposure to both\nisolated culture conditions and microglia-glioma co-cultures\n(human microglial cell line, CHME5 and rat glioma C6 cells).\nDuring the first 3 h of co-culture, the population in a low\nphagocytic state tended to decrease, whereas the opposite\noccurred with the population in a higher phagocytic state;\nhowever, after 6 h of co-culture, this trend tended to reverse\nso that, after 24 h of co-culture, a large increase in the M1\npopulation and a drastic reduction of the M2 phagocytic one\nwere observed.\nAt a late stage of this research we thought it was interest-\ning to seek for any parameter of human pathology that could\npossibly correlate with our in vitro findings on the animal\nmodel. Interestingly, in human glioma tissue obtained from\nsurgical resection of patients with IV grade glioblastoma, we\ndetected a significant amount of CD68 positive cells. The\nlatter is a marker of macrophage/microglial phagocytic ac-\ntivity, thus a not specific index of M1/M2 activated cells.\nThe presence of CD68 positive cells in all the analyzed tumor\nsamples, albeit in different amount, suggest the relevance of\nactivated microglia/macrophages in the human pathology as\nwell. However, further characterization is necessary in order\nto correlate the in vitro data to the human pathology with\nrespect to the extent of microglial polarization at different\nstages of disease and/or the possible neoplastic nature of\nCD68 positive cells, as hypothesized by the group of Seyfried\nIn conclusion, our data consistently show that a different\ndegree of glioma activation can polarize microglia cells in\ndifferent manners, suggesting that microglia might in turn\nexert different effects on glioma cells depending on the stage\nof disease.
