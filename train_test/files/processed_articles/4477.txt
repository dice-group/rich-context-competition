    "abstract": "Abstract\nObjective: This study aimed to define the correlation between microRNA-122 (miR-122)\nexpression and hepatectomy-induced liver injury in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).\nMethods: Plasma miR-122 expression in patients with HCC and healthy age-matched controls\nwas determined, and correlated with plasma alanine transaminase activity (ALT) and bilirubin levels\npreoperatively and on days 1 and 7 postoperation. Correlations between plasma miR-122 and\nclinicopathological characteristics at 1 day postoperation were also determined.\nResults: This study included 80 patients with HCC and 80 controls. Baseline expression of miR-\n122 mRNA and ALT in patients with HCC was significantly higher than in controls. MiR-122\nexpression correlated with ALT and bilirubin levels preoperatively and on days 1 and\n7 postoperatively. In patients with HCC who received a block of the first hepatic portal during\nsurgery and those with excised tumour size >5 cm, plasma miR-122 expression was significantly\nincreased on day 1 postoperatively, compared with expression levels in those who did not receive a\nblock and those with smaller tumours.\nConclusions: Plasma miR-122 expression is correlated with hepatectomy-induced liver injury in\npatients with HCC. Increase in miR-122 expression could be used as an index of such injury before\nand after hepatectomy in these patients.\n",

All patients were infected with\nhepatitis B and had not received any treat-\nment before the operation. HCC was patho-\nlogically confirmed after the hepatectomy.\nHealthy age-matched volunteers (who did\nnot present with a medical history of hepa-\ntitis B or any tumourtypes) were used as\nnegative controls; suitable individuals were\nrecruited from those who attended a health\ncheck-up at the Physical Health\nExamination Centre of Central South\nUniversity, Hunan, China.\nStudy protocols were approved by the\nInstitutional Review Board at Central\nSouth University, Changsha, China, and\nall participants provided written\ninformed consent prior to participation.\nParticipant examinations were conducted\nin the Department of Hepatobiliary\nSurgery, Third Xiangya Hospital,\nChangsha, China.\nHepatectomy procedure\nAll patients underwent hepatectomy accord-\ning to standard practice; block of the first\nhepatic portal vein was performed as neces-\nsary during the procedure.18 Tumour size\nwas measured by computed tomography\n(Aquilon; Toshiba Medical Systems,\nTokyo, Japan) before the hepatectomy.\nBlood loss during surgery was measured by\nthe attending anaesthesiologist and con-\nsisted of a combination of blood accumula-\ntion in the suction device and that weighed\nfrom surgical sponges.\n78 Journal of International Medical Research 42(1)\nBlood samples and RNA extraction\nVenous blood samples from patients with\nHCC were collected preoperatively during a\nclinic visit, and on day s1 and 7 postopera-\ntion, when patients were still hospitalized.\nSamples were taken after overnight fasting\n(>12 h) and analysed 3 h after the sam-\npling. Two ml of venous blood was with-\ndrawn from each participant, using 1%\nheparin as the anticoagulant, and stored at\n4C before use. Samples were centrifuged for\nthe plasma was obtained and total RNA was\nextracted from 100 ml of plasma using\nTRIzol\u00d5 Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,\nCA, USA); isopropanol was used as precipi-\ntate and finally the RNA was dissolved in\n20 ml of distilled water.\nQuantitative RT and PCR\nTaqMan\u00d5 MicroRNA Assays (ABI\nPRISM, Carlsbad, CA, USA) were used to\nevaluate mature miR-122 expression levels.\nFor the reverse transcription (RT) reactions,\n10 ng of total RNA was used in each reac-\ntion and mixed with the RT primer as\npreviously described.19 RT reactions were\nat 4C. Following the RT reactions, 1.5 ml of\ncDNA was used for a polymerase chain\nreaction (PCR) using 2 ml of the TaqMan\nprimers. The quantitative RT\u00adPCR cycling\nprogramme involved preliminary denatur-\nation at 94C for 2 min followed by 1 cycle\n30 s, followed by a final elongation step at\nPCR system (ABI PRISM). The real-time\nPCR results were analysed and expressed as\nthe relative miRNA level using U6 snRNA\nfor normalization purposes. The RT and\nPCR primers for miR-122 were purchased\nfrom ABI PRISM. Furthermore, U6\nsnRNA was used as the internal control,\nand the miRNA-122 expression was\nobtained using the 2\u00c0\u00c1\u00c1CT assay, as previ-\nLaboratory measurements\nFor the miR-122 evaluation, laboratory\nmeasurements were conducted on the\nblood samples that were collected from\npatients preoperatively, and from controls.\nTotal bilirubin in the blood samples was\nmeasured by an enzymatic assay using an\nTarrytown, NY, USA). For determination\nof ALT activity, the reference method\ndefined by the International Federation of\nClinical Chemistry with pyridoxal phos-\nphate was used and calibrated, as previously\nStatistical analyses\nData were expressed as mean \u00c6 SD (all SDs\nwere <5%) of three experiments.

Patients with excised tumours\n>5 cm in diameter also had significantly\nincreased plasma miR-122 expression, com-\npared with those with smaller excised\ntion.

Four miRNAs were\nfound to be significantly up-regulated and\nthree miRNAs were significantly down-\nregulated in tissue samples from patients\nhighly expressed in liver, and accounts for\n>70% of total miRNAs. Additionally, miR-\ngreater than in other tissues: miR-122\nexpression in other tissues is so low that it\ncannot be detected. MiR-122 is character-\nized by high tissue specificity, and it is an\nimportant regulatory factor in the liver.27\nAt present, ALT is used as a serological\nmarker that correlates with clinical liver\ninjury. However, numerous extrahepatic\nconditions can increase ALT levels\nTable 1.

Hence, increases in ALT\nlevels are not specific to liver injury and it is\ntherefore not a suitable marker of such\ninjury.28 It has been reported that miRNA\nin tumour cells is released into blood using a\nspecific mechanism.29 Previously, it was\nbelieved that RNA was not stable in per-\nipheral blood and that RNA was easily\ndegraded by RNase,30 therefore, it was\ndifficult to detect the RNA in blood.31\nHowever, miRNA has now been found to\nmaintain its stability well in peripheral\nhas been used for the diagnosis and prog-\nnosis of tumours.35 MiRNA is specifically\nexpressed in liver cells; therefore, cellular\nmiR-122 may be released into the blood\nafter liver injury. Additionally, peripheral\nmiR-122 expression may reflect the degree of\nliver injury. Zhang et al.17 showed that ALT\nand miR-122 levels in the plasma of patients\nwith chronic hepatitis B were higher than\nsuch levels in healthy volunteers. Hence,\nthey deemed that miR-122 was a useful\nbiomarker for the evaluation of hepatitis B\nvirus-induced liver injury. However, the\nmechanism involved in the transportation\nand release of miR-122 is still not clear. In\nthe present study, we found that preopera-\ntive miR-122 and ALT levels in the plasma\nof patients with HCC before were signifi-\ncantly higher than those in healthy controls,\nand that miR-122 expression was positively\ncorrelated with ALT levels.\nData from the present study are consist-\nent with the results of Zhang et al.,17 and this\nmay be because HCC is commonly accom-\npanied by chronic hepatitis B-induced liver\ninjury. Additionally, miR-122 in the cyto-\nplasm of HCC cells may be released into the\nblood, and a synergistic action may occur.36\nHence, detection of plasma miR-122 expres-\nsion preoperatively could be used to com-\nplement the ALT assay for the evaluation of\nliver injury. Furthermore, the present study\nTable 3.

These three\nindices returned to normal levels 7 days\npostoperation. The change in plasma miR-\n122 was similar to ALT and bilirubin. In\naddition, miR-122 expression was positively\ncorrelated with ALT and bilirubin expres-\nsion (R > 0.7). Hence, these data primarily\nshowed that plasma miR-122 may be a novel\nbiomarker for liver injury induced by\nhepatectomy.\nThe present study also analysed the rela-\ntionship between plasma miR-122 and clin-\nicopathological indices of patients 1 day\npostoperation, and suggested that plasma\nmiR-122 expression was not associated with\nage, sex or extent of intraoperative haemor-\nrhage. However, its expression was asso-\nciated with first hepatic portal control and\nexcised tumour size: receiving first hepatic\nportal control and having a large excised\ntumour (>5 cm) induced an increase in\nplasma miR-122 expression. This may be\ndue to liver cells being injured due to hypoxia\nafter occlusion of hepatic blood flow, and a\nlarge excised tumour size means that a large\nliver section had to be removed, causing\nmore extensive liver injury than would be\nseen with smaller excisions. However, a\nlarger sample quantity than that studied in\nthe present analysis is needed to further\nstudy the mechanisms involved.\nThe approach presented in our paper has\nbeen already proposed for monitoring drug-\nand viral-induced liver damage, but it\nshould be considered with some caution.\nSpecifically, the 2\u00c0\u00c1\u00c1CT assay method is\nwidely used to compare control and treated\nsamples, but it is reliable only if the house-\nkeeping RNA levels (in this case U6) are\nconstant and are not modified by the treat-\nment. Future research could involve a\nstandard-curve method, in addition to the\n2\u00c0\u00c1\u00c1CT method, although this is a more\ntechnically challenging approach.\nThe present study findings indicate the\npotential value of miR-122 expression in\npatients with HCC, but it should be noted\nthat this test method is currently more\nexpensive compared with other techniques.\nIt is feasible, therefore, that where only\nstandard serological testing is available,\nseverity of liver damage and post-surgery\nprognosis could be indicated by raised ALT\nand bilirubin levels, particularly in those\nwith occluded hepatic blood flow and larger\nexcised tumours. However, miR-122 expres-\nsion is of value because of its good repeat-\nability, sensitivity and specificity.\nTo conclude, the present study primarily\nsuggested that plasma miR-122 expression\nin patients with HCC was related to ALT\nand bilirubin levels, and that hepatic blood\nflow occlusion and large excised tumour size\nmay be used as a novel serological marker\nto evaluate liver injury induced by\nhepatectomy.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial, or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
