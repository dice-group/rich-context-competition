Average life\nexpectancy has steadily increased in the United States but there is limited information on long-\nterm mortality trends in the US counties This study aimed to investigate trends in county\nmortality and cross-county mortality disparities, including the contributions of specific diseases\nto county level mortality trends.\nMethods and Findings\nWe used mortality statistics (from the National Center for Health Statistics [NCHS]) and\npopulation (from the US Census) to estimate sex-specific life expectancy for US counties for\nevery year between 1961 and 1999. Data for analyses in subsequent years were not provided to\nus by the NCHS. We calculated different metrics of cross-county mortality disparity, and also\ngrouped counties on the basis of whether their mortality changed favorably or unfavorably\nrelative to the national average. We estimated the probability of death from specific diseases\nfor counties with above- or below-average mortality performance. We simulated the effect of\ncross-county migration on each county's life expectancy using a time-based simulation model.\nBetween 1961 and 1999, the standard deviation (SD) of life expectancy across US counties was\nat its lowest in 1983, at 1.9 and 1.4 y for men and women, respectively. Cross-county life\nstatistically significant increase in mortality; the major cause of mortality decline for both sexes\nwas reduction in cardiovascular mortality. From 1983 to 1999, life expectancy declined\nsignificantly in 11 counties for men (by 1.3 y) and in 180 counties for women (by 1.3 y); another\n48 (men) and 783 (women) counties had nonsignificant life expectancy decline. Life expectancy\ndecline in both sexes was caused by increased mortality from lung cancer, chronic obstructive\npulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, and a range of other noncommunicable diseases, which\nwere no longer compensated for by the decline in cardiovascular mortality. Higher HIV/AIDS\nand homicide deaths also contributed substantially to life expectancy decline for men, but not\nfor women. Alternative specifications of the effects of migration showed that the rise in cross-\ncounty life expectancy SD was unlikely to be caused by migration.\nConclusions\nThere was a steady increase in mortality inequality across the US counties between 1983 and\n1999, resulting from stagnation or increase in mortality among the worst-off segment of the\npopulation. Female mortality increased in a large number of counties, primarily because of\nchronic diseases related to smoking, overweight and obesity, and high blood pressure.\nThe Editors' Summary of this article follows the references.\nIntroduction\nAverage life expectancy in the United States has increased\nsteadily in the past few decades, rising by more than 7 y for\nParallel to this aggregate improvement, there are large\ndisparities in health and mortality across population sub-\ngroups defined by race, income, geography, social class,\neducation, and community deprivation indices [1\u00ad18]. Fur-\nthermore, there is evidence that health and mortality\ndisparities have persisted or even increased over time in\nthat the observed aggregate health gains may not have been\ndistributed evenly.\nCounties are an important unit of analysis in under-\nstanding trends in mortality disparities in the United States.\nFirst, county-level analysis helps assess health disparities in\nrelation to place of residence, and therefore complements\nanalysis by race, income, and other socioeconomic factors.\nSecond, counties are the smallest measurable unit for which\nmortality data are routinely available, and county-level data\nallow analyses for small subgroups of the US population. For\n(pooled over 5 y to increase the number of observations in\nsmall counties) demonstrates that the highest and lowest\ncounty life expectancies in the United States were 18.2 and\n12.7 y apart for males and females, respectively, compared to\n6.7- and 4.9-y gaps between whites and blacks as a whole.\nFurther, county definition is relatively invariant over time,\nallowing consistent and comparable long-term analysis of\ntrends in health disparities. This consistency is an important\nadvantage because even analysis by race may be affected by\nchanges in self-reported race in census figures over time\n[21,22]. Finally, county-level socioeconomic data are available\nfrom the census, and cause-specific mortality data are\navailable from the vital statistics. These two data sources\nallow analysis of trends in all-cause mortality as well as\nmortality from specific diseases, in relation to both the\nlocation of county of residence and its environmental and\nsocioeconomic characteristics (see also Singh [10,20]).\nWe used data on all-cause mortality to analyze trends in\nmortality and mortality disparities in US counties for a\nlongest trend analyses of mortality disparities in the United\nStates to our knowledge. We also grouped counties on the\nbasis of whether their mortality changed favorably or\nunfavorably relative to the national average, and identified\nthose counties with mortality stagnation and increase. Finally,\nwe examined the epidemiological (disease-specific mortality)\nand selected socioeconomic characteristics of counties with\nbelow- or above-average mortality performance.\nMethods\nconsisting of one or multiple individual counties. There were\ntwo reasons for forming merged county units: (1) to avoid\nunstable death rates, smaller counties were merged with\nadjacent counties to form units with a total population of at\naccount for changes in county definitions and lines, such as\nformation of new counties and reversion to non-county\nstatus. This grouping of counties created a consistent set of\n2,068 individual or merged county units that represent the\nsame physical land areas from 1959 through the present.\nBecause borough-specific death statistics were not available\nprior to 1982 in New York City, its five separate counties were\nmerged into a single unit. For each county unit, we calculated\nannual sex-specific life expectancies. Table 1 provides\nsummary information on the sociodemographic character-\nistics of counties. We also calculated probabilities of death\nfrom all causes as well as from specific diseases and disease\nWe report the standard deviation (SD) of life expectancies\nof the 2,068 county units in the United States, as well as life\nexpectancy for counties that make up the 2.5% of the US\npopulation with the highest and lowest county life expect-\nancies in each year, by sex. We also report changes in\nmortality from specific diseases for six groups of counties,\ndefined on the basis of how their life expectancy changed in\nrelation to the national sex-specific change as follows: group\n1, counties whose life expectancy increased at a level\n(statistically) significantly higher than the national sex-\nspecific mean; group 2, counties whose life expectancy\nincreased at a level significantly higher than zero but not\nsignificantly distinguishable from the national sex-specific\nmean; group 3, counties whose life expectancy increased at a\nlevel significantly higher than zero but significantly less than\nthe national sex-specific mean; group 4, counties whose life\nexpectancy change was statistically indistinguishable from\nzero and from the national sex-specific mean; group 5,\ncounties whose life expectancy change was statistically\nindistinguishable from zero and was significantly less than\nthe national sex-specific mean; and group 6, counties whose\nlife expectancy had a statistically significant decline. All\nstatistical significance was assessed at 90%.\nData Sources\nMortality statistics, including county of residence and cause\nof death certified and coded according to the International\nClassification of Diseases (ICD) system, were obtained from\nthe National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). Standard\npublic-use mortality files do not include geographic identi-\nfiers for deaths in counties with fewer than 100,000 people.\nWe obtained county identifiers for all deaths for years 1959\nthrough 2001 through a special request to the NCHS. County\nidentifiers for years after 2001 were not provided to us by the\nNCHS.

Detailed data to quantify cross-county migration for\nStatistical Methods for the Analysis of Mortality Data\nWe estimated life expectancy and probabilities of death\nbetween specific ages, from all causes combined as well as\nfrom specific diseases, using standard life table techniques\n[23]. Life tables for each county-year were constructed using\nage-specific death and population data in 5-y age groups.\nFollowing standard life table techniques [23], those surviving\nto 85 y of age were assigned a life expectancy equal to the\ninverse of their observed mortality rate. For each year in each\ncounty unit, we calculated life expectancy and probabilities of\ndeath by pooling death and population data over 5 y (the year\nof analysis and two years on each side) to reduce sensitivity to\nsmall numbers (e.g., life expectancy in 1999 used death and\npresented in Dataset S2 for all county-years. National-level\nlife expectancy was not affected by small number of deaths\nand was calculated using data from individual years.\nWe estimated uncertainty in county life expectancy, and in\nchange in life expectancy over time, using a binomial\nsimulation. In brief, the uncertainty in the age-specific death\nrate in each county depends on the number of deaths\n(numerator) (n) and population (denominator) (N), and can\nbe characterized with a binomial parameter with an expected\nvalue of p \u00bc n/N and a variance of p 3 (1 \u00c0 p)/N. We simulated\n1,000 draws from this distribution for every age-sex combi-\nexpectancies for each county-year in these 3 y. The\ndistribution of the 1,000 differences in the randomly drawn\nused to calculate confidence intervals and establish the\nstatistical significance for life expectancy change. Owing to\ncomputational constraints, we used 100 draws for estimating\nthe confidence intervals for absolute disparity between\ncounties at the extremes of mortality advantage and\ndisadvantage. The total number of simulated life tables was\nEffects of Cross-County Migration on Life Expectancy\nChange\nWe simulated the effect of cross-county migration on each\ncounty's life expectancy using a time-based simulation model.\nsufficiently detailed cross-county migration data were avail-\nable. For each year after 1993, simulated life expectancy in\neach of the 2,068 county units was calculated as the weighted\nsum of its own life expectancy from the previous year and\nthose of immigrants from all other counties, with weights\nbeing equal to the proportion of the new population from\nmigration matrix). This analysis was done for both sexes\ncombined, because sex-specific migration data were not\navailable. We repeated this analysis using three alternative\nassumptions: (1) emigrants had the same life expectancy as\nthose who stay in the county of origin; (2) the life expectancy\nof all emigrants was 1 y higher than the life expectancy of\nthose who stayed in the country of origin; and (3) the life\nexpectancy of the emigrants to counties with higher life\nexpectancy was 1 y higher than those who stayed in the\ncountry of origin or migrated to counties of lower life\nexpectancy. The last two scenarios were based on some\nevidence that migrants may be healthier than those who do\nnot move [24,25]. In both scenarios, the life expectancy of the\nremaining population was adjusted downwards so that overall\nlife expectancy was correctly calculated.\nAll analyses were done using Stata version 9.2 and ESRI\nResults\nUnited States increased from 66.9 to 74.1 y for men and from\nTable 1.

The spread of male life expectancy\nacross US counties, as measured by SD, rose slowly in the\nto rise again to 2.3 in 1999; the rate of increase declined in\nthe 1990s (Figure 1). For women, cross-county life expectancy\nrose steadily to 1.7 y in 1999. Cross-county life expectancy SD\nwas always larger for men than for women.\nIn the early 1980s, the absolute disparity between counties\nat the extremes of mortality advantage and disadvantage also\nbegan to increase. For example, the difference between life\nexpectancies of the counties that make up the 2.5% of the US\npopulation with the lowest and highest mortality in each year\ny to 7.5 y for women (Figure 2B). This widening gap was\ncaused by stagnating improvements in life expectancy among\nthe worst off, while the best off experienced consistent\nlife expectancy in counties with the lowest mortality rose\nmore punctuated: Life expectancy increased in the 1960s and\nearly 1980s, life expectancy of the worst-off females remained\n1999); that of the worst-off men had a period of decline,\nrising again in the 1990s. The stagnation of mortality among\nthe worst off was primarily caused by a slowdown or halt of\nthe earlier decline of cardiovascular mortality, coupled with a\nmoderate rise in a number of other chronic diseases, for both\nsexes as well as HIV/AIDS and homicide for men.\nFigure 3 groups counties by change in life expectancy,\nsex-specific national average life expectancy change over the\nsame period. Figure 4 shows the epidemiological character-\nistics of below- or above-average mortality reduction ob-\nserved in Figure 3.

During this same period, life\nexpectancy improvements were significantly below the na-\ntional average in the Midwest and Southern California for\nboth sexes, in the Mississippi Delta for men, and in parts of\nthe West Coast for women. In this period, the best-perform-\ning counties had the lowest average starting life expectancy of\nTable 2), and the worst-performing ones had the highest\nstarting life expectancy (68.9 for men and 77.6 y for women).\nThis negative association between starting life expectancy\nand change in life expectancy supports the finding of\nno counties had a statistically significant decline in sex-\nspecific life expectancy at the 90% confidence level. The\nbroad improvement of life expectancy observed during this\nperiod was primarily caused by major reductions in cardio-\nvascular disease mortality for both sexes, compensating and\nsurpassing the rise in cancers and chronic obstructive\npulmonary disease (COPD). The distinction between those\ncounties that performed better or worse than the national\naverage in this period was primarily the rate of decline in\ncardiovascular diseases, with secondary effects from injuries\nand other noncommunicable diseases.\nhad statistically significant decline in 11 and 180 counties,\nrespectively (0.5% and 3.0% of the male and female\npopulations); average decline in these counties was 1.3 y for\nboth men and women. Another 48 and 783 counties had\nnonsignificant life expectancy decline for men and women\n(0.4% and 8.8% of the male and female populations),\nrespectively. The average life expectancy decline in these\ncounties was 0.5 y for women and 0.4 y for men, but these\nwere not statistically significant because these counties were\nrelatively small. Of the counties with statistically significant\nlife expectancy decline, all for males and all but seven for\nfemales were in the Deep South, along the Mississippi River,\nand in Appalachia, extending into the southern portion of\nthe Midwest and into Texas. There were also a number of\ncounties with significant female life expectancy decline in the\nRocky Mountain area and the Four Corners region, and one\ngain also became geographically more concentrated, and\nshifted to the Northeastern and Pacific Coast counties.\nThe decline in female life expectancy after 1983 was caused\nby a rise in mortality from lung cancer, COPD, diabetes, and a\nrange of other noncommunicable diseases in the older ages\n(Figure 4; detailed numerical results available in Dataset S1).\nFemale mortality from lung cancer, COPD, and even diabetes\ndecline in cardiovascular disease mortality.

Our\nfinding on the decline and subsequent rise of mortality\ndisparities across US counties would be the same using other\nmetrics of mortality disparity, such as the interquartile range.\nEqually important is the finding that the higher disparity\npartly resulted from stagnation or increase in mortality\namong the worst-off segment of the population, with life\nexpectancy for approximately 4% of the male population and\n19% of the female population having had either statistically\nsignificant decline or stagnation. This stagnation and reversal\nof mortality decline, although affecting a minority of the\nnation's population, is particularly troubling because an oft-\nstated aim of the US health system is the improvement of the\nhealth of ``all people, and especially those at greater risk of\nhealth disparities'' (see for example http://www.cdc.gov/osi/\ngoals/SIHPGPostcard.pdf).\nAnalyses of life expectancy of individual counties over\nthese four decades showed worsening of life expectancy in a\nlarge number of counties after the early 1980s, especially\namong women. The majority of these counties were in the\nDeep South, along the Mississippi River, and in Appalachia,\nextending into the southern portion of the Midwest and into\nTexas. The rise in all-cause mortality was caused by an\nincrease in cancers, diabetes, COPD, and a reduction in the\nrate of decline of cardiovascular diseases. There was also\nimportant influence of HIV/AIDS and homicide among men.\nHarper et al. [18] found a widening gap in life expectancy\nby a narrowing. To examine if the observed cross-county\nmortality distribution in Figure 1 is caused by a clustering of\nblack population, we estimated the SD of county life\nexpectancies separately for white and black populations of\nall counties for whites and those counties with sufficient\npopulation and deaths to allow life expectancy calculation for\nblacks). Race-specific cross-county SD for white males and\nfemales and for black males mirrored the combined pattern\nseen in Figure 1; it remained relatively unchanged for black\nfemales. In other words, the observed trends in geographical\nmortality disparities were applicable even for the same race.\nThis study has a number of limitations. First, our analysis\ndid not incorporate data after 2001 (leading to estimates up\nto 1999), because these data were not provided to us by the\nNCHS. However, the post-2001 data are particularly impor-\ntant for continued monitoring of mortality and mortality\ndisparities in US counties, for example for the purpose of\nmonitoring progress towards Healthy People 2010 goals.\nSecond, although counties provide the smallest unit of\nanalysis for mortality and causes of death and are ideal for\ncomparable analysis over time, they do not allow considering\ndisparities within individual counties, especially in relation to\nsociodemographic factors. In the absence of detailed data on\nwithin-county mortality disparities, the cross-county SD does\nnot directly measure total mortality inequalities in the United\nStates (this applies to all analyses of population subgroups;\nsee Gakidou et al. [26] for a discussion of within- and\nbetween-group health disparities). Third, analysis of cause-of-\ndeath data may be affected by regional variability in cause-of-\ndeath coding, which may also change over time [27]. The\nrelatively broad disease categories (e.g., all cardiovascular\ndiseases and clusters of cancers) used in our analysis have\nlikely limited this effect. Fourth, the estimated uncertainty in\nlife expectancy accounts for statistical uncertainty in death\nrates caused by (finite) population size and number of deaths.\nHowever, it was not possible to formally incorporate non-\nsampling error in death and population numbers. For\nexample, population figures in the US censuses are not\nadjusted for under- and over-counts; the extent of under- and\nover-count may itself vary across counties or over time.\nPopulation and death figures have additional uncertainty\nowing to factors such as illegal or seasonal migrants and age\nmisreporting. Finally, even the best-available data on migra-\ntion could only provide indicative, versus conclusive, evi-\ndence of its role in trends in county mortality. The use of\nInternal Revenue Service migration data required making an\nassumption on the relative health status of emigrants,\ncompared to nonmigrants. Alternative specifications of this\nassumption showed that migration still attenuated the rise in\ninequality, even when migrants were assumed to have\nsubstantial advantages in life expectancy. Therefore, although\nuncertainty about the precise relationship between the health\nof migrants and nonmigrants remains, it is unlikely that our\nfindings on rising cross-county disparity are an artifact of\nmigration. Although the mortality rates of cross-county\nmigrants are not known, analysis of income data illustrates\nthat, on average, family incomes of migrants were about $500\nmay have acted to further attenuate the true rise in mortality\nif it had the same pattern as the years in our analysis. It is,\nhowever, possible that the migration pattern differed in the\nearlier years of the analysis period.

All statistical significance was\nMortality Trends in US Counties\nBasis of the Level of Change in Life Expectancy as in Figure 3\nThe total height of each column shows the change in the probability of dying (from all causes) in the age range shown, divided into the probability of\ndying from specific diseases and injuries. The change is calculated as the probability of death in the end year minus that of the initial year. Therefore, a\npositive number indicates an increase in mortality, and a negative number indicates a decline in mortality (disease-specific or all-cause for the net\neffects of all diseases).

The\nimplication is that cohort effects on education are not adjusted for in these estimates. The data are for both sexes combined due to data availability.\nlAverage of the first year for which data were available in the period (1970 and 1983) and the last year of the period (1983 and 1999).

A separate implication of\ncross-county migration is that, in counties with large\npopulation growth, a larger proportion of the population\nhas recently immigrated from other counties. There was a\nweak relationship between change in life expectancy and\npopulation growth rate (correlation coefficients were 0.14 for\nDemographic and epidemiologic research has commonly\ndocumented the continued rise in life expectancy in the\nWestern populations and the epidemiological dynamics and\ntransitions that occur as mortality declines [28\u00ad30]. At the\nnational level, the most notable examples of adult mortality\nrise are those in populations affected by the HIV/AIDS\nepidemic and in the former Soviet Union as a result of a rise\nin chronic diseases and injuries [31\u00ad35]. In high-income\ncountries, there were periods of stagnation, or even slight\nAustralia, the Netherlands, and Norway), possibly as a result\nvery high prevalence of smoking; the effects were substan-\ntially more pronounced among men [36,37]. To the best of\nour knowledge, Denmark is the only high-income country\npossibly because of high smoking prevalence among Danish\nwomen [39]. Subnationally, recent analyses in Australia and\nthe United Kingdom have found that an increase in mortality\ndisparities was not accompanied by an actual rise in mortality\nin population subgroups; rather it was caused by differential\nHIV/AIDS mortality in the United States declined after the\nintroduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy in the\nFigure 4 may be due to incomplete coverage and/or\ncontinued (albeit lower) mortality among the previously\nincident cases, itself due to treatment failure; the disparities\nin HIV/AIDS mortality could be caused by higher incidence\nor lower access and effectiveness in the worst-off groups. The\nrise in chronic disease mortality for relatively large segments\nof the American population, especially women, however,\ndefies recent trends in other high-income countries. The\nepidemiological (disease-specific) patterns of female mortal-\nity rise are consistent with the geographical patterns of, and\ntrends in, smoking, high blood pressure, and obesity [44\u00ad47].\nIn particular, the sex and cohort patterns of the increase in\nlung cancer and chronic respiratory disease mortality point\nto an important potential role for smoking (see also Preston\nand Wang [48]). The role of these risk factors in the reversal\nof the epidemiological transition should be further inves-\ntigated, and programs that increase the coverage of inter-\nventions for chronic disease and injury risk factors in the\nworst-off counties, states, and regions should be established\nand regularly monitored and evaluated with respect to their\nlocal, versus aggregate only, impacts.\nSupporting Information\nDataset S1.
