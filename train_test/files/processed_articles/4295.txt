    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe majority of people with dementia, even at advanced stages, receive most of their care and support from family members,\nfriends, and neighbors, rather than formal support systems. This qualitative research undertaken in the Australian state of\nQueensland explored how family carers of people with dementia living in the community successfully manage and sustain\ninformal caring. It also considers challenges these carers anticipated in continuing to support their family member with\ndementia in the future. What emerges through this analysis of the carers' perspective on the sustainability of care is the\nimpact of factors including the living arrangements, generational cohort and life stage of the carer, financial issues, and ability\nto effectively combine caring with their other roles and responsibilities in life.\n",

The World Health\nmillion people across the world with some form of dementia,\nwith the numbers set to double by 2040 (World Health\nOrganization, 2012). A large proportion of people with\ndementia receive in-home support from family carers. Caring\nfor a person with dementia can result in physical, psycho-\nlogical, and economic impacts on the carer, which are often\ngreater than in caring for people with other conditions asso-\nThese impacts are primarily related to a number of symp-\ntoms resulting from memory loss, challenging behaviors,\nand gradual loss of ability to carry out activities of everyday\nliving, which necessitate intense support from carers.\nThe most recent data from Australia estimate that more\nthan 332,000 Australians are living with dementia (of a total\npopulation of just more than 21.5 million people) with the\nnumbers set to rise significantly in the next two decades\n(Alzheimer's Australia, 2014). Across Australia, it is esti-\nmated that 70% of people with dementia continue to live in\nthe community (rather than in residential care) and the vast\nmajority (92%) receive informal care and support from one\nor more people (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare\nIn their recent review, Rummery and Fine (2012) identi-\nfied three interconnected facets of care, each of which have\nimplications for the family care of people with dementia:\nThe first facet they identified was care as a disposition\ntoward another as both a cognitive and emotional orienta-\ntion. This orientation incorporates taking an interest in the\nlife of the person along with a degree of responsibility for\ntheir well-being. The second facet was care as a form of\nlabor, foregrounding such issues as workload, physical\ndemands, and the costs of care. The third facet was care as a\nsocial relationship, through which both the care recipient and\ncaregiver may lose autonomy due to the acceptance of depen-\ndency and responsibility. The sustainability of the work, or\nlabor, of informal care is often assessed as \"perseverance\ntime,\" or the time that an informal carer anticipates he or she\ncan continue to care under their current conditions (Kraijo,\nThere is "
