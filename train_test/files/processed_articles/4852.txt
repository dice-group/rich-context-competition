Most such minor problems\nremain unpredictable. Therefore, this field\nof research is important because some of\nthese problems may progress from a state of\ninconvenience to a situation of disturbing\nmorbidity.1,2 Nausea and vomiting in the\npostoperative period of epidural anaesthesia\nis a well-studied subject, but intraoperative\nnausea and vomiting (IONV) has not been\nwell studied.3,4 Nausea and vomiting with\nonset during the operation and persisting in\nthe postoperative period cause reduced\npatient comfort, delayed discharge from\nthe hospital, and an increase in costs. This\nproblem deserves more attention when some\npossible consequences, such as dehydration,\nelectrolyte imbalance, wound dehiscence,\nvenous hypertension and bleeding, rupture\nof the oesophagus, airway obstruction, and\naspiration pneumonia, are taken into\nNausea and vomiting are not uncommon\nin a wide variety of surgical operations.\nHowever, this problem arises even more\noften in caesarean operations under regional\nanaesthesia.7 Increased intra-gastric pres-\nsure, hypotension, stretching the periton-\neum (exteriorization of the uterus), excessive\nsurgical manipulation and visceral stimula-\ntion, using opioids, using uterotonic agents,\nand the patient's mental status play a role\nand place the patient at high risk for\nIONV.4,7\u00ad9 Hypotension associated with\n(combined) anaesthesia12 is a particularly\nimportant contributing factor for IONV.\nSome details associated with the surgical\ntechnique, such as peritonealization, exter-\niorizing the uterus for suturing, and peri-\ntoneal washing, may also contribute to\nIONV.8 The incidence of IONV is as high\nas 80%.7 Therefore, prophylactic medica-\ntion for this condition is critical.\nPrevious studies that have been con-\nducted on IONV have focussed on treat-\nment, rather than prevention, of this\ncondition. Preoperative and intraoperative\nadministration of midazolam and propofol,\nclose monitoring of hypotension, achieving\na good anaesthetic block, a gentle surgical\ntechnique, and judicious use of uterotonic\nagents appear to have beneficial effects on\nThis study aimed to investigate the effect\nof particular anaesthetic and surgical tech-\nniques and the significance of the antenatal-\nmedical-surgical history on occurrence of\nIONV in patients who have caesarean deliv-\nery under regional anaesthesia. Our results\ncould prompt anaesthetists and surgeons to\ntake appropriate preventive measures.\nMethods\nThe study was retrospectively conducted by\nthe Memorial Hospital (private hospital),\nGATA Haydarpasa Training Hospital (aca-\ndemic military hospital), and Necip Fazil\nState Hospital (training status, state hos-\nparticipate in this multicentre study. The\nsample size was considered sufficient to draw\nconclusions because the condition of IONV\nsections under epidural anaesthesia. The\nstudy protocol was approved by the ethics\ncommittee of GATA Haydarpasa Training\nHospital. The inclusion criteria were as\nfollows: regular antenatal clinic attendance\n(at least one attendance in the first trimester\nand observation four times weekly, or com-\nplying with the attending obstetrician's\nadvice, more often until term); elective\ncaesarean section (the patient's decision\nwas not to have vaginal delivery); singleton\npregnancy; and cephalic presentation. The\nexclusion criteria were as follows: any his-\ntory of diabetes, hypertension, thyroid dis-\nease, obesity, gastrointestinal disease,\nanaemia or any other condition requiring\nlong-term medication; no history of alcohol\nor drug abuse; and no major complications\nof pregnancy (pregnancy-induced hyperten-\nsion, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes) in\nthe antenatal period. Only patients with the\nabove-mentioned details recorded in their\nhospital records and who could provide\ninformation to complete the data set when\ncontacted were included in the study.\nEpidural anaesthesia was applied under the\nfollowing routine: 1000 ml of Isolyte-S solu-\ntion was infused as a co-load through a 20\ngauge peripheral intravenous catheter. An\nelectrocardiogram, blood pressure, heart\nrate, and peripheral oxygen saturation\nwere continuously monitored. The patient\nwas placed in the seated position and 2%\nlidocaine infiltration was performed at the\nappropriate level. A combined spinal-epi-\ndural Tuohy needle (Tuohy Portex 19 G)\nwas progressed to the epidural space using\nthe technique of loss of resistance with\nnormal saline. The spinal needle was further\nadvanced through and free flow of cerebro-\nspinal fluid was observed. A combination\nsolution of 2 ml 0.5% bupivacaine hydro-\nchloride anhydrous (Marcain Heavy) and\n25 mcg fentanyl was injected. The spinal\nneedle was withdrawn and the catheter\nremained in situ for continuous epidural\nanaesthesia with 0.5% bupivacaine. The\nepidural catheter was then progressed for 4\nto 5 cm cranially. The needle was withdrawn\nand the catheter was fixated. The level of\nsensory block was tested by temperature\nsensation.\nA common operative technique adopted\nby obstetricians was performed as follows. A\nPfannenstiel incision was performed using\nscissors to open the fascial and peritoneal\nlayers (to minimize the peritoneal stretch\nfactor), and a scalpel incision was made for a\nlower segment transverse (Kerr) uterotomy,\nwhich was extended sideways by the fingers.\nThe foetus was delivered by directing the\nocciput to the incision and moderate fundal\npressure by the assistant. The uterus was not\nexteriorized during repair. If the uterus had\nto be exteriorized for any reason, the patient\nwas excluded from the sample. The average\nminutes) from making the incision to com-\npletion of skin closure. As soon as the\nnewborn was delivered, 1 ml of oxytocin\nof isotonic sodium chloride (0.9% NaCl)\ninfusion in addition to a bolus of the same\ndose. The patients were monitored to deter-\nmine whether they felt nauseated during\ncaesarean delivery and nausea was recorded\nalong with vomiting episodes if encountered.\nTreatment was provided as appropriate by\nthe anaesthetist when vomiting occurred.\nEpidural anaesthesia was performed using\nthe same technique by the anaesthetists in\neach of the three assigned hospitals with\nsimilar times for the procedure.\nUsing records or interviews, severe\nnausea and vomiting in the first trimester\n(1st TM nausea/vomiting) was accepted as\npresent when the patient expressed this\ncomplaint in the antenatal clinic in the first\ntrimester, as occurring every day and requir-\ning antiemetics other than herbal or dietary\nmeasures. A distinction between emesis and\nhyperemesis was not made. Smoking was\nrecorded as positive if the patient continued\nor started smoking while pregnant. Motion\nsickness was recorded as positive when the\npatient described nausea and/or vomiting\nduring a car, boat, or air travel before\npregnancy as shown on records or inter-\nviews. PMS was recorded as positive using\nthe patients' description and answers based\non the criteria of the International Society\nfor Premenstrual disorders.\nStatistical analysis was conducted using\nPASW 18.0 for Windows. To form the\nsample group, we chose criterion sampling\nof the purposive/purposeful sampling\napproach where only those patients who\nconformed to some specified criteria were\nincluded. The descriptive statistics for cat-\negorical variables are shown as counts and\npercentages. Continuous variables are\nshown as mean, standard deviation,\nmedian, 25th percentile, 75th percentile,\nminimum, and maximum. For continuous\nvariables, the Mann\u00adWhitney U test was\nused for testing differences between groups\nwhen the assumption of normality was not\nsatisfied. For categorical variables, the chi-\nsquare test was used when its conditions\nwere met. Otherwise, Fisher's exact test was\nused. Furthermore, logistic regression was\nused to determine the risk factors, where the\nlevel of significance was p < 0.05.\nResults\nA total of 209 women with a mean age of\nmulticentre study. Mean body mass index\nwith 1st TM nausea/vomiting was 59\n(9.6%), and the number of those describing\nnumber of patients who experienced PMS\nbefore pregnancy was 20 (9.6%). A total of\nparameters are shown in Table 1.\nOf the 209 patients included in the study,\nduring the caesarean operation and 19\n(9.1%) suffered from vomiting. Patients\nwho experienced nausea intraoperatively\nhad a significantly higher rate of 1st TM\nnausea/vomiting, motion sickness, and a\nfemale newborn than did those who did\nnot experience nausea intraoperatively\n(Table 2). Patients who had a female new-\nborn, 1st TM nausea/vomiting, and a\nhistory of PMS and motion sickness before\npregnancy experienced a significantly higher\nIn the model that was formed by inclusion\nof variables that showed significance for\nnausea (age and comparison analyses,\nvomiting and motion sickness, but not\nPMS, were significant risk factors\nIn the model that was created for evaluation\nof risk factors for vomiting, the parameters\nthat were significant by multivariate analyses\n(age and comparison analyses, p < 0.250)\nwere 1st TM nausea/vomiting and a female\n(Table 5).\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we primarily aimed to define\npreventive measures for intraoperative\nnausea and vomiting during caesarean sec-\ntion under epidural anaesthesia. After main-\ntaining the parameters of surgical, medical,\nand anaesthesiological factors within certain\nstandards, a female newborn, nausea and\nvomiting in the first trimester, and a history\nof PMS and motion sickness were risk\nfactors for IONV. We conclude that this\ngroup of patients will benefit from prophy-\nlactic medication.\nTable 1. Summary of parameters.\nBMI: body mass index; 1st TM nausea/vomiting: severe\nnausea and vomiting in the first trimester; PMS: premen-\nstrual syndrome; SD: standard deviation.\nRegional anaesthesia is a safe method for\nelective and emergency caesarean sec-\ntions.8,14 IONV has been reported to be as\nhigh as 50% to 80% in caesarean sections,\nwhile in non-obstetric operations, this rate\naffected by factors that are particular to the\npatient, anaesthesia, and surgery. Prediction\nof IONV is important for enabling appro-\npriate and timely use of antiemetics.15,16\nApfel et al.1 described a useful risk scoring\nsystem based on four parameters for post-\noperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), but\nthere is no such system for IONV.\nTherefore, there is no such system in\ncaesarean section under spinal anaesthesia.\nIn most studies on IONV, only the triad of\npatients, surgery, and anaesthesia were kept\nconstant and other parameters were investi-\ngated. Predictive factors concerning the\npatient have been more consistently defined,\nbut those concerning surgery and anaesthe-\nsia have been more variable and\nuncontrolled.\nOur study showed that nausea was more\nlikely to occur if the patient's history con-\nsisted of 1st TM nausea/vomiting, when a\nhistory of motion sickness before pregnancy\nwas present, and if the newborn was female.\nThis is an interesting finding because it has\nnot been shown in other studies. Female sex\nof the newborn has been shown to be closely\nTable 2.

The fact that\nIONV is observed less frequently with\nadvanced maternal age, which is attributed\nto decreased oestrogen levels, also supports\nthis hypothesis.1 In non-obstetric oper-\nations, women are four times more suscep-\ntible to nausea and vomiting than men.1,2\nThis rate decreases after menopause, but still\nremains higher than that in men, which\nsupports a significant role of sex hormones\nPrevious studies have shown that being a\nnon-smoker results in more susceptibility to\nIONV, but this finding was not confirmed in\nour study.1,2,21 The only finding in our study\nthat was related to this previous finding,\nwhich suggests that liver enzymes are\ninduced by smoking and thus produce a\nprotective effect on IONV, was the higher\nnumber of smokers in the group without\nvomiting. However, this finding did not\nreach significance. We also found that 1st\nTM nausea/vomiting in addition to motion\nsickness were also significant risk factors for\nIONV. Migraines are also a contributing\nfactor in PONV.2,22 We found that the rate\nof PMS was significantly higher in the group\naffected by vomiting compared to the group\nwho had nausea only. While the mechanism\nof PMS is not completely known, women\nwith PMS are considered to have increased\nsensitivity to hormonal changes along with\nneurotransmitter abnormalities.23\nThe presence of gastric distension, an\noperating time exceeding 30 minutes, use of\nopioids intraoperatively, nitrous oxide, and\npositive pressure ventilation with a face mask\nincrease the likelihood of IONV.3,24 The\nstimulating agents of the vomiting mechan-\nism comprise the vagal nerves, cerebral\ncortex, vestibular body, and the chemorecep-\ntor trigger zone. The receptors of dopamine,\nserotonin, histamine, and muscarine play a\nrole in this process.19,25 All studies on these\naspects have been at the epidemiological level.\nThere is a notable lack of studies at the\ngenetic and molecular biology level, which\nwould provide more understanding on the\npathology and management of IONV.\nPrevious studies have suggested that to\nprevent IONV during caesarean section,\nblood pressure must be closely monitored,\nuse of opioids must be kept to a minimum,\nthe operative technique must be gentle with\nminimum displacement of the uterus (not\nexteriorising through an incision), and\nuterotonics and antibiotics must be admin-\nistered in dilute and slow infusions. Our\nstudy shows that if a patient has a history of\nPMS, motion sickness, or severe nausea-\nvomiting in the first trimester, and the\nnewborn is a girl, prophylactic antiemetics\nshould be used. Further work on this issue is\nnecessary to confirm the role of the factors\nthat we analysed in this study in identifying\ncandidates who are at risk of IONV and the\neffectiveness of measures in its prevention. A\nscoring system could be devised in such a\nstudy to enable clinicians to identify patients\nat risk for IONV more specifically and\neffectively.\nTable 4.
