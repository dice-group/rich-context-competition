Introduction\nThe health and welfare of adolescents is a major topic within health economics. Considerable\nattention has been paid in recent years to examination of risky behaviors by youth, such as smoking,\ndrinking, drunk driving, drug use, unprotected sex, and crime [1-6]. These activities are often first\nundertaken prior to the age of nineteen, but can have important implications for longer-term health and\nwelfare of adults. In this context, a possible definition of risky behavior is that the activity involves\nshort-term benefits and potential longer-term costs. For example, the decision by a youth to engage in\nsmoking or binge drinking has short-term payoffs that are both personal and social in nature. The\nlonger-term costs can include adverse impacts on individual health, employability, longevity, marital\nstability, and other outcomes. Social external costs also can arise, either immediately or in the long\nrun [7-9]. The ability of youth to weigh immediate benefits against potential adverse consequences is\nthe subject of debate within economics and psychology. For economics, a starting point for modeling\nrisky decisions is expected utility maximization whereby individuals weigh expected benefits against\nexpected costs with exponential (time-consistent) preferences. In the rational addiction model due to\nBecker and Murphy [10-12], utility-maximizing individuals also incorporate interdependencies among\npast, current, and future consumption. Short-term benefits derived from current consumption are\nweighed against long-run costs, which include monetary and implicit costs associated with\naccumulated stocks of the addictive activity. A refutable hypothesis is that past, current, and future\nprices affect current consumption. Empirical tests of the rational addiction hypothesis have been\ncarried out for several risky behaviors, including alcohol use, smoking, drug use, gambling, and\nobesity [13-17]. Several theoretical and econometric issues remain unresolved in the literature,\nespecially when aggregate data are used [18-20].\nDevelopmental psychology, as summarized by Fischoff [21], defines risk-taking as any action\ninvolving at least one uncertain outcome, where the outcome can be positive (winning a lottery) or\nnegative (drug addiction). Hence, risk-taking is the deliberate choice of a risky behavior. The choice\nmay be a single or infrequent behavior (drunk drinking) or a sequence of repeated behaviors (daily\ndrinking). There should be voluntary choice at some point if an individual is to be described as taking\nrisks, rather than just bearing them. According to Fischoff [21], the decision to undertake risky\nbehavior is affected by an individual`s cognitive development (how people think about the world);\naffective development (how people feel about the world); and social development (roles that others\nplay in people`s choices). For risky decisions, debate exists regarding the future orientation of youth\ncompared to adults [18,22]. For example, some psychology studies report that consequences of risky\nactivities involving social reactions are considered more heavily by teenagers than by adults, although\nthe two groups are remarkably similar overall [23]. Peer pressure does not generally imply extreme\nforms of irrationality or purely emotional decision-making, but youth might react non-optimally to the\nintrinsic costs and benefits that they face. From an economic perspective, policies can be designed to\nmanipulate incentives so as to better align perceived immediate benefits with longer-term social goals.\nAltering prices through the use of tax policy is one such example [24-30], but changing the regulatory\nor informational environment for risky decisions also can affect perceptions and incentives.\nNow consider an environment in which the information used in decision-making is partly under the\ncontrol of producers, such as the advertising messages and promotional campaigns used by producers\nof alcohol and tobacco. These messages might alter incentives to engage in underage drinking and\nsmoking by glamorizing the activity, by altering perceptions of the risks involved with the activity or\nby altering perceptions of pervasiveness among peers and adults [31,32]. For example, the 1994\nSurgeon General`s report [33] opines that cigarette advertising appears to affect young people`s\nperceptions of the pervasiveness, image, and function of smoking (p195). Psychologists use the term\nfalse consensus effect to describe individuals who perceive that their beliefs, choices or behaviors\nare relatively common [34]. The advertising messages also can be targeted to appeal to well-defined\nconsumer groups or market segments according to dimensions such as age, gender, ethnicity, income,\noccupation, lifestyle, and past experience with the product. In the Bayesian learning model of addictive\nbehavior due to Orphanides and Zervos [35], inexperienced individuals are initially uncertain of the\npotential harm associated with consumption of addictive products such as cigarettes. Each individual\npossesses a subjective belief or prior probability concerning his or her potential to become addicted,\nand this belief structure is updated with information gained from past consumption, peer behavior,\nschooling, advertising, and other marketing activities. In particular, advertising might alter the prior on\nthe incidence of harmful addiction by changing youths` smoker prototypes or their perceptions of the\npervasiveness of smoking. Due to misperceptions, some experimenters with tobacco become addicted\nand may experience regret at a later point in life. Further, the misperception can be associated with\nsocial external costs. If accurate, the Bayesian model of addiction has implications for the content,\nplacement, and amount of advertising and promotion that is permitted for risky products, especially\nthose that involve youth or other inexperienced consumers.\nOn the other hand, advertising seeks to persuade and everyone knows it, even quite young\nchildren [36,37]. Consumers have reason to be skeptical of claims and images in advertisements\nbecause they recognize that ads represent producers` self-interest, and sellers are aware that consumers\nare skeptical [38]. For this reason, consumers ignore or belittle many ads, but producers have an\nincentive to better match brands to consumer preferences and to compete with other sellers by\ninforming consumers of this match. Consumers learn what brands to trust, so existing competitors and\nnew sellers must work to overcome this trust, also known as brand loyalty. This essentially competitive\nprocess is most evident in the case of price advertising, where a series of economic studies have shown\nthat bans of price advertising increase product prices [38,39]. More generally, by reducing information\nand restricting entry of new products and producers, advertising bans can entrench market shares and\ncreate market power for existing producers. Even in the case of persuasive advertising, such as that\ncarried out for alcohol and tobacco products, there are self-correcting mechanisms in place. For\nexample, advertisers sometimes engage in comparative (less-bad) brand advertising that also informs\nconsumers of inherent risks associated with the product [38]. Advertising for well-known products\nwith static markets (i.e., mature products) rarely serves to increase industry sales, so a producer`s\nincentive often is to increase the number of its brands and direct its appeals for patronage to market\nsegments. Some highly-advertised brands do better in the marketplace, but it is a fallacy to argue that\nsuccessful advertising by one producer implies that all producers do better by advertising more [40,41].\nHowever, advertising might be objectionable if it affects youthful consumers of restricted products,\neven if the products are legal for adults. Does mass-media advertising for alcohol and tobacco affect\nyouth behaviors in a significant manner? How strong an influence is advertising and other marketing\npromotions? Most of the research directly bearing on these questions is found in survey studies carried\nout by psychologists and public health researchers. In particular, prospective cohort (longitudinal)\nstudies are regarded as evidence of a causal relationship between marketing activities and drinking and\nsmoking behaviors. Lovato et al. [42] argue that longitudinal studies . . . capture what happens to\nindividuals over time and can demonstrate whether individuals who differ in their exposure to\nadvertising when they are not smoking, then differ in their future smoking behaviour (p3). In a\nlongitudinal study, a sample of youth is interviewed at least twice. During the initial or baseline survey,\ninformation is collected about each respondent`s use of alcohol or tobacco and his or her receptivity or\nexposure to mass media advertising and other marketing practices (branded merchandise, exposure in\ncinema and videos, etc.). All information on receptivity and exposure is self-reported, although various\nmanipulations of these data are often performed such as combining responses to several survey\nquestions to form an index. Data also are collected on possible covariates such as age, gender, race,\nethnicity, family environment, parental education, school performance, and so forth. During one or\nmore follow\u00adup surveys, each individual`s drinking or smoking behavior is measured again. The\nfollow-up survey usually is conducted one or two years later, but shorter and longer durations are\npossible. The behavior status at follow-up is typically analyzed using a logistic regression model,\nwhich computes the odds ratio of progression from, say, non-smoking to smoking status conditional on\nbaseline receptivity and other covariates. It is argued that cross-sectional and time-series studies\nprovide weaker correlational evidence because it is unclear if advertising exposure preceded the\ndrinking or smoking outcomes [42,43]. Nevertheless, it is common practice for studies and reviews to\ncite these other methodologies if they provide supportive evidence [31,32].\nMany longitudinal studies are based on Social Cognitive Theory, which incorporates aspects of\nsocial and cognitive development and learning [44,45]. Social cognitive theory suggests that a\ncombination of environmental (social) and personal or cognitive factors influence behaviors (beliefs,\nattitudes, perceptions). Requirements for people to learn and model behavior are often divided into\nattention (attending to an advertisement); retention (remembering a brand); reproduction (initiating or\nintending to initiate product use); and motivation to adopt the behavior (net positive reinforcement).\nAdvertising`s role is characterized as symbolic modeling [32], in which the medium of observation is\nthrough mass media (such as television or movies) rather than face-to-face observation (such as a\nparent and child) . . . [however] audiences are conceived as complex and active agents in the\nperson-media relationship (p32). More specifically, expectancy beliefs are central to social cognitive\ntheory, whereby individuals form symbolic beliefs or representations about the anticipated benefits and\ncosts associated with a given behavior [46,47]. Using the technique of path analysis, elaborate models\nof expectancy theory have been constructed [40,47]. Compared to economic models, psychological\nmodels focus more on the process of decision making, which requires consideration of a wide variety\nof factors that might affect youthful decisions.\nSeveral recent articles provide reviews of longitudinal studies of advertising and youth alcohol or\nyouth to use alcohol and tobacco, although the magnitude is sometimes labeled modest. However,\nthe reviews provide simple narratives that focus on basic methodology and empirical results, especially\nresults that conform to social learning theories. Assessments of the empirical model specification and\nstatistical testing are frequently brief or absent. Assessments of the overall significance and magnitude\nare not reported in a summary fashion. Publication bias is ignored [51]. Despite the weaknesses in the\nstudies and reviews, strong policy recommendations often are presented, such as calls for bans of all\nalcohol and tobacco advertising including passive advertising at sponsored sports events and similar\nvenues. Given these past recommendations, the objective of this review is to provide a critical\nassessment of the modeling framework employed in longitudinal studies, the statistical procedures\nutilized, and empirical results achieved in such studies. In particular, I demonstrate that many\nlongitudinal studies are seriously incomplete or ignore statistical problems and solutions that are\nwell-known in econometrics, including issues of specification bias, measurement error, endogeneity,\nand sample selection bias. My conclusion is that the emphasis on advertising bans and similar\nregulations in the public health literature is misplaced. More effective policies need to be sought to\ndeal with issues of youthful risk-taking associated with alcohol and tobacco.\nIt is of course possible for advertising to have a null or negative effect on the behaviors of adults\nand youth, and some longitudinal studies do report such results. Indeed, among economists, there is a\nlong-standing belief that advertising does not have a large impact on aggregate product sales, either\npositive or negative [52]. There are three main reasons why advertising and other marketing activities\nmay fail to influence behaviors. First, advertising can affect brand shares only with no effect\nwhatsoever on initial purchase or eventual consumption, other than the choice of a particular brand.\nThat is, the effect of advertising is purely redistributive even at the initial point in a consumer`s\nconsumptive history. This is referred to as the weak or predatory theory of advertising [53].\nSecond, advertising can increase brand loyalty for some producers, which in turn increases the price\nthat profit-maximizing producers find optimal. The increase in product price, which arises because the\nconsumers` demand function is rendered less elastic, reduces product demand. Additionally, due to\nadvertising, consumer preferences or demand may be shifted or concentrated more in higher-quality\n(higher-priced) brands, so the indirect effect of higher prices can offset any direct effect of advertising.\nThird, advertising may raise costs and thereby increase product prices and reduce demand. In the\ncontext of an oligopoly, this is a prisoners` dilemma equilibrium since all firms might be better off at\na lower level of advertising. Although mixed results are reported, empirical research on the market for\ncigarettes demonstrate that restrictions on mass media advertising tend to lower consumption primarily\nby reducing price competition [54-56], so the direct effect of the restrictions is possibly benign.\nOverall, there are reasons to be skeptical that advertising plays a substantial role in youthful decisions\nto drink or smoke, over and above the choice of a particular brand.\nThe remainder of this review is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a brief summary of trends\nin adolescent drinking and smoking, using data for the US from the annual Monitoring the Future\nsurvey. Section 3 outlines some of the validation problems associated with empirical studies. Section 4\npresents a summary of 20 longitudinal studies of youth drinking and 26 studies of youth smoking. The\nfocus in this section is on model specification and testing, including critical analysis of measures used\nfor receptivity and exposure to marketing and advertising. Tabular summaries are used to present the\nmain features of the various studies and their findings. Section 5 analyzes longitudinal methodology\nwith a focus on two advanced econometric issues, endogeneity and sample selection bias. Section 6 is a\ndiscussion of the findings, including a brief analysis of alternative methodologies presenting evidence\non the effects of advertising bans for alcohol and tobacco. Section 7 contains the conclusions. Overall,\nthe review finds that longitudinal studies of advertising and youth drinking-smoking behaviors contain\nsignificant econometric and statistical problems, which preclude a causal interpretation. Some\nsuggestions are offered for improving the research in this area.\n2. Trends in Adolescent Drinking and Smoking: Monitoring the Future\nSystematic annual data on the prevalence of underage drinking and smoking in the US are collected\nand tracked by several organizations. This section relies on data from the Monitoring the Future (MTF)\nsurvey, which is an annual school-based survey conducted every spring since 1975. The most recent\ngrades (ages 13\u00ad18). Selected information also is reported by MTF for full-time undergraduate college\nstudents (ages 19\u00ad22) and young adults ages 19\u00ad28 who are high school graduates. Alcohol data\ncollected by MTF include any use in the past 30 days, daily use in the past 30 days, consumption of\nfive or more drinks in the past 30 days, annual and lifetime use of alcohol. Various data also are\ncollected on prevalence of drunkenness, type of beverage consumed, perceived risks and harms, and\nattitudes about disapproval and legality of underage drinking, heavy drinking, and drunkenness.\nTobacco data collected by MTF include 30-day use, daily use, half-pack or more per day, annual and\nlifetime use of cigarettes. Various data also are collected on perceived risks of smoking, disapproval,\nuse of smokeless tobacco, attitudes toward cigarette use, and ease of availability of tobacco products.\nFor both products, subgroup data are reported by grade level, gender, race, etc. However, cautionary\nuse of these data is necessary due to nonresponses (both individuals and schools) and inaccurate\nresponses [57]. Other social processes, such as the stigmatization of tobacco use, also complicate\ninterpretation of the data, leading to inferences that are at best tentative.\nTable 1 and Figures 1 and 2 display the available information in the MTF surveys on 30-day\nprevalence for any use of alcohol and tobacco. Across grade levels, alcohol and tobacco use is high, but\ndeclining over time. Prevalence levels in the US also are below those in many other developed\ncountries [58,59]. For alcohol, the trend for secondary students is toward lower levels of use, with an\napparent slowing of the rate of decline in the mid-1990s followed by steady decline since the year\n2000. One explanation for the decline is a higher minimum legal drinking age, which for the US has\nbeen 21 years in all states since the year 1989. For cigarettes, there is a sharp decline over time in\nsmoking prevalence, although not always uniformly. The early 1980s was a steady period for\nprevalence as judged by 12th grade smoking, followed by a rise in the early 1990s. Since 1995, there\nhas been a sharp decline in smoking at all age levels. Enactment of stricter regulations again played a\nrole, but increased social stigma is probably important. However, smoking in the US is not federally\nillegal at ages younger than 18 as only the purchase of tobacco products is regulated. Some individual\nstates have enacted laws making possession by a minor illegal or have increased the legal age for\npurchase. What else explains these trends? This turns out to be a surprisingly difficult question to\nanswer, but higher real prices play an important role for tobacco products [60-62].\nTable 1. Trends in US Youth Drinking and Smoking Prevalence (% Use).\n30-day alcohol use (%)\n30-day cigarette use (%)\nTable 1. Cont.\nFigure 1. Trends in 30-Day Alcohol Use.\nFigure 2. Trends in 30-Day Cigarette Use.\nThese trends also are of possible importance for longitudinal survey studies. First, the trend data\nshow little change over short periods of one to three years, but there can be important changes over\nlonger periods of time. Longitudinal studies that conduct a follow-up survey after more than three years\nmay be capturing some of the trends revealed in the MTF data. Second, one possible way of explaining\nthe trend in youth prevalence is to show that it is related to similar trends in adult behavior as shown by\nCook and Moore [61], Gruber [62], and Nelson [63]. However, causality is unclear. The importance of\nadult behaviors may be that there is a direct effect if youth are influenced by adult prevalence. On the\nother hand, it can be that the adult and youth levels and trends reflect common underlying factors, such\nas a greater value placed on long-term health or similar responses to price changes. In either case, this\nreinforces the importance of accounting for a wide variety of factors in longitudinal studies, especially\nthose covariates related to parental and peer behaviors.\n3. Research Designs and Validity\nIt is useful to begin by thinking about an ideal research design, which is an experimental or\nrandomized controlled trial. Suppose each youth in a random sample is to receive a specific treatment\nor dose of advertising, which is assigned by a random mechanism. Random selection and assignment\nof youth insures that the study groups are unbiased. Some groups may receive no treatment whatsoever,\nso there is a well-defined control group. The effect of the treatment could be measured on a\nbefore-after basis for each treated group, but the use of a control group can detect any placebo effects\nassociated with the experiment. It is widely recognized that ethical considerations as well as practical\nproblems restrict the use of experimental studies for advertising and youth drinking or smoking. In\naddition, no single experiment could capture the vast array of advertising and marketing methods used\nby producers. Any true experiment might underestimate the overall effects of advertising because only\na limited number of key factors are studied at once [42]. Although some experimental studies of\nadvertising have been conducted, they will not be reviewed here.\nAn alternative to a randomized trial is a quasi-experimental research design, where the treatment\ngroups and comparison groups are not randomly assigned [64,65]. For example, econometric studies of\nadvertising bans entail a statistical analysis of groups subject to complete or comprehensive bans,\npartial bans, and no bans of advertising. Both cross-section and time-series variation in the treatment\nmay be present, so the data comprise a panel of observations. A natural experiment occurs if there is\nan exogenous source of variation across the groups, which might lead to changes in some important\noutcome. In his study of alcohol advertising bans, Nelson [66] argues that membership in the European\nEconomic Union (EEU) constitutes a natural experiment for analysis of advertising bans and cross-\ncountry per capita alcohol consumption. EEU legal authority had the effect of changing advertising\nregulations independent of other country-specific influences on drinking. Other economic studies that\nmight fall generally under the heading of quasi-experiments are reviewed in Section 6. An alternative\nquasi-experimental research design, widely used in psychology and public health, is a longitudinal\nsurvey study. Lovato et al. [42] argue that longitudinal studies can isolate the causal effect of\nadvertising under the following conditions: (1) the advertising treatment must clearly precede the\nhypothesized effect; (2) behavior is measured at baseline and in one or more follow-ups; and (3) there\nare controls for possible confounding factors, such as age, gender, race, peer smoking, parental\nsmoking, and so forth. Further, in most studies, a narrowly-defined cohort is selected based on age or\nschool grade. This selection rules out some time-invariant confounders. Because the behavior\nmeasurements are essentially forward-looking, longitudinal studies reviewed here also are called\nprospective cohort studies.\nBoth longitudinal and econometric studies must address a number of general problems if empirical\nresults are to be considered valid and possibly valuable for other purposes, such as policy design. Many\nproblems arise due to the non-randomness of the treatment and comparison groups. If not addressed,\nthese problems undermine any causal interpretation of the studies, so they are labeled threats to\nvalidity [65]. As defined by Campbell [67], internal validity refers to the confidence with which a\ncausal relationship between two variables can be drawn. External validity refers to the confidence with\nwhich a presumed causal relationship can be generalized beyond the specific sample, setting, and time\nstudied. Examination of internal validity is best carried out on a study-by-study basis, but the task of a\nreview in part is to determine the external validity of a set of studies. The main threats to internal\nvalidity for longitudinal and econometric studies are as follows [65]:\n1. Omitted variables: Personal characteristics of respondents and intervening events other than the\ntreatment that provide alternative explanations for the outcomes. Omission of relevant explanatory\nvariables results in specification bias, which is discussed further below.\n2. Trends in outcomes: As explained above, there can be processes at work that are mainly a\nfunction of the passage of time per se, which may go undetected in the study.\n3. Mismeasurement: A critical factor in longitudinal and econometric studies is the accurate\nmeasurement of advertising and marketing activities for alcohol and tobacco. This important threat is\nexamined in detail below for longitudinal studies.\n4. Misspecified variances: The significance of statistical tests is overstated if outcomes for some\nindividuals are correlated or clustered, so the data have a group structure [64]. A number of treatments\nfor clustered standard errors are now available.\n5. Omitted interactions and paths: Omitted variables that capture differential effects by group, such\nas males and females, and omitted relationships that reflect more complex causal orders. As explained\nbelow, the terms for these influences in psychology are moderated and mediated effects.\n6. Endogeneity: This term refers to the joint determination of outcomes. For example, many\nlongitudinal studies determine youths` baseline ownership of alcohol- or cigarette-branded\nmerchandise and then measure the effect of baseline ownership on drinking or smoking outcomes at\nfollow-up. After controlling for confounders, a significant positive relationship between ownership and\noutcomes is given a causal interpretation. However, in contrast to true experiments, ownership of the\nmerchandise--or other exposure to advertising--is not randomly assigned, rather it is a choice on the\npart of the respondent. Hence, there is a strong possibility that ownership is endogenous, which\nrequires a stochastic examination, and not predetermined or assigned in the experimental sense. As\nexplained below, modeling of simultaneity is a common task in econometric studies, but this step is\nignored in the longitudinal literature on youth drinking and smoking. As a result, empirical results in\nlongitudinal studies are suspect due to simultaneity bias. Note that simultaneity is not an economic or\neconometric feature of the data; rather it arises due to use of a non-experimental research design. Its\ndetection and measurement is critical to the internal validity of quasi-experimental research designs.\n7. Selection bias: Selection can take many forms. For example, self-selection occurs if respondents\ncan opt out of the survey and their participation decision is based on characteristics that also are\nrelevant to drinking or smoking outcomes, but are unobserved. As shown by Heckman [68], self\nselection creates specification bias for the empirical relationship. The crucial detail is that the sample is\nno longer random and there are omitted variables associated with the participation decision.\n8. Sample attrition: The differential loss of participants from different groups, such as the failure of\nminority students to participate in the follow-up survey at a rate comparable to non-minority students.\nBoth selection and attrition threats are discussed in detail below.\nWith the exception of endogeneity, all of the threats to internal validity are well-known statistical\nproblems in the psychology and public health literatures, although individual studies may fail to fully\nrecognize or deal with some threats. It is a special feature of many econometric studies that they\ngrapple with endogeneity issues, where several statistical techniques are available. In the remainder of\nthis review, the threats are taken up in conventional order, but readers with a strong background in\neconometrics might desire to read Section 5 prior to the rest of the review. Many details are examined\nfor model specification and measurement, but it cannot be emphasized too strongly that the single-most\nimportant contribution of health econometrics is its focus on endogeneity issues.\n4. Specification and Estimation of Longitudinal Models: Alcohol and Tobacco\n4.1. Model Specification: Specification Bias and Measurement Errors\nThis section reviews the model specification used in 20 longitudinal studies of youth drinking and\n26 studies of youth smoking. Overall, there are a number of common features of the studies, which\nallow cross-study comparisons and generalizations. However, the two groups of studies employ\nslightly different models, especially for advertising receptivity and exposure. I first examine the model\nspecifications used in studies of youth alcohol behavior and summarize the difficulties associated with\nthe measures of advertising in these studies, especially the consistency of empirical results across\nstudies. Second, I examine the model specifications used in studies of youth smoking behavior, and\noffer critical assessments of these studies. In both cases, there are numerous empirical estimates that\nare null or statistically insignificant that tend to be ignored in other reviews and policy discussions.\nSpecification errors arise when an empirical model omits a relevant covariate (omitted variable bias)\nor when an empirical model includes an irrelevant variable [69]. In the first instance of\nunder-specification, the least-squares estimator of the remaining variable(s) is biased, with the\ndirection of bias depending on the correlation between the omitted variable and the included variable\nand the correct sign of the omitted variable on the outcome in question. Suppose risk-preferences of\nsurvey respondents are positively correlated with receptivity to marketing, and risk-preference has a\npositive effect on drinking and smoking behaviors. If risk-preference is omitted as a covariate or\nunobserved, a positive correlation and a positive (but omitted) sign impart a positive bias to the\nreceptivity variable [70]. The measured effect of marketing is overstated. The size of the bias is\ndetermined by the effect size of the omitted variable (risk) and the partial effect of risk on receptivity,\ni.e., the risk-adjusted effect of receptivity. Hence, it is crucial in an empirical study that all important\nvariables are included, especially those that are more highly correlated with the explanatory variable\nthat is the focus of the investigation. Potentially, this list of variables is quite long. In a multivariate\ncontext, the bias can be transferred to other covariates depending on the pattern of correlations among\nthe included variables. Only in the unlikely case where all covariates are uncorrelated (orthogonal\nregressors) is the bias avoided. The variance-covariance matrix for the included variables is unbiased,\nbut larger in magnitude (less efficient). Further, including an irrelevant variable does not result in bias\nfor the other variables, although the least-squares estimator is not as efficient. Because there is always\nuncertainty regarding the correct model specification, a number of statistical tests and diagnostics\nhave been developed, including tests for omitted variables, functional form, structural change, and data\noutliers [69,70]. More generally, it is common practice in econometrics to present results for several\ndifferent specifications or estimation methods, which tests less formally the robustness of the results\nfor omitted variables [69]. This is referred to as a robustness check or sensitivity analysis. As\ndiscussed below, both formal and informal specification tests are rarely conducted in\nlongitudinal studies.\nThe second problem discussed in this section is measurement error associated with variables for\nadvertising receptivity and exposure (errors-in-variable problem). Ideally, an advertising or marketing\nmeasure should satisfy three criteria. First, it should represent accurately the forces that influence a\ndecision by a youth to consume alcohol or tobacco, insofar as these decisions are affected by\nadvertising and marketing. Second, all relevant advertising and marketing variables are included in the\nfinal regression (otherwise there is specification bias). Third, the advertising variables in the model\nshould be related in some manner to actual or anticipated public policies, such as broadcast advertising\nbans or restrictions on the contents of advertisements and promotions. In the first instance,\nmismeasuring the advertising variable renders this explanatory variable stochastic and hence correlated\nwith the error term in the regression. The least-squares estimator of the advertising coefficient is biased\nand inconsistent, i.e., the problem is not solved by increasing the sample size [69]. In general, the bias\nis toward zero, with the magnitude of the bias depending on the how much variation there is in the true\nvariable measured without bias and the variation in the measurement error [70]. In the multivariate\ncase, estimators of all included variables can be biased and inconsistent. However, the direction of the\nbias can go either way and is generally difficult to determine. Econometric procedures for dealing with\nerrors-in-variable bias include use of instrumental variables, but traditional methods applied to survey\ndata present special problems [71]. Latent variable models have been widely used in health\neconomics [72], with several indicator variables that are related linearly to unobserved true values of\nthe mismeasured variable. However, instrumental variable estimation is a special case, which avoids\nstrong assumptions regarding measurement error variances [69].\nIn addition to measurement and specification errors, many of the receptivity-exposure measures\npresent special problems for assessment of public policies toward alcohol and tobacco advertising.\nMost measures in question are not demonstrated to be related to or even correlated with actual\nadvertising exposure or with any actual public policy [73]. This is in sharp contrast to econometric\nstudies that attempt in various ways to evaluate the effects of advertising expenditures, broadcast\nadvertising bans, and other regulatory policies (e.g., price advertising bans, billboard bans, warning\nlabels). Because the receptivity measures in longitudinal studies tend to be broad and amorphous, it is\ndifficult to say (or even guess) how receptivity might change in light of a particular public policy.\nHence, as a crude policy application, longitudinal studies usually are led to recommend complete bans\nof all forms of alcohol and tobacco advertising, but this is not a statistical application or even logical\nextension of the models. It is not possible to simulate the consequences of the proposal to see if the\nestimated results are reasonable. As a result of these problems, most longitudinal studies are devoid of\npolicy implications as that term is commonly understood by economists.\nA final issue here concerns the nomenclature applied to the right-hand side (RHS) of regression\nequations. In econometrics, RHS variables (the X variables) are usually referred to as regressors,\ncovariates, independent variables, or explanatory variables. The outcome or response is the regressand\nor dependent variable (the LHS y variable). Other disciplines frequently employ the term\nconfounders or extraneous variables to refer to RHS variables other than the variable(s) that are\nthe focus of the study. However, in psychology, an important distinction also is drawn between RHS\nvariables that are moderators and mediators of a focus variable [74]. Briefly, a moderator variable is\nthird variable (z) that interacts with a variable x so as to affect the relationship of x and y. This\nmoderating effect can be accounted for by including z in the regression and an interaction term\nbetween x and z, given by the variable xz. The relationship between x and y now depends on the level\nof z. Hence, excluding the interaction variable from the regression is a specification error and could\nresult in specification bias of some magnitude. Since multicollinearity also is an issue here, tests for\nstatistical significance generally require examining the joint significance of the coefficients for x, z,\nand xz. In econometrics, moderating effects are accounted for in the same fashion or by choice of\nfunctional form for the regression (double-log, semi-log, translog). A mediator variable is a variable\nthat both causes y and is caused by x, so in a path analysis diagram there is direct path from x to y and\nan indirect or intervening path through which x causes z and z causes y. Note that the mediated\nrelationship is theoretical as opposed to a moderating relationship, which can be treated as a purely\nstatistical problem. Mediating variables are not usually considered as endogenous variables in the\npsychology literature. As long as the indirect relationship or amount of mediation between x and z is\nnot of major importance, then estimation by multivariate least-squares is straightforward. However,\nthis precludes a complete causal or structural interpretation, which requires estimation by path analysis\nor similar models. Several of the studies reviewed below report results for interaction variables or use\nmultilevel hierarchical or path analysis models for mediation effects. Complete examination of these\nmodels is beyond the scope of this review, although some critical comments have been offered\n4.2. Alcohol Advertising: Model Specification in Twenty Studies\nTwenty studies were determined to meet the following criteria: (1) a longitudinal study with\nbaseline and follow-up sample(s) of youth or young adults; (2) one or more drinking behaviors as\noutcomes (drinking onset, frequency, binge drinking, etc.); (3) one or more advertising, marketing,\npromotional, brand recognition or receptivity measures as covariates, determined at baseline (one\nexception); and (4) the study uses a multivariate statistical procedure such as logistic regressions. Some\nstudies noted below use the same sample of respondents, but analyze the data in different ways. For the\nmost part, the studies were identified by using previous surveys and searches on MEDLINE, PsycINFO\nor Google, and reference lists in more recent publications. Experimental, cross-sectional, and\ntime-series or econometric studies are excluded from this review. Also excluded are studies of drinking\nThe 20 studies are summarized in the Appendix [75-94]. Fourteen of the studies are for the US,\nincluding four nationwide studies. The other countries studied are Belgium (1 study), Germany (2), and\nNew Zealand (3). Some studies use several waves of a continuing survey, such as the New Zealand\nstudies. Some studies use identical or very similar samples: there are two identical nationwide US\nstudies [85,92]; two studies of South Dakota middle school students [77,79]; two studies of middle\nschool students in New Hampshire and Vermont [84,88]; and two studies of German youth [81,82]. A\ncommon theme in these overlapping studies is emphasis on different methods of alcohol advertising\nand marketing. For example, McClure et al. [84] use the New Hampshire-Vermont sample to study the\neffect of alcohol-branded merchandise on drinking onset of youth who were baseline nondrinkers. The\nsame sample and drinking outcome is used by Sargent et al. [88] to examine the effect of exposure to\nalcohol portrayals in movies. Neither study mentions or includes the data on the other promotional\nmethod. Both models are therefore misspecified and potentially biased. This statement also applies to\nother overlapping studies. The age range for respondents in the studies includes youth who generally\nare 16 years or younger, but several studies also include young adults [75,76,89]. In some cases, the\nempirical analysis is conducted using subsamples by age or gender [75,78,80,89]. Although attrition\nand completion rates in the surveys are difficult to determine exactly, most of the surveys indicate a\ncompletion rate from baseline to follow-up of about 70% or better. The exception is the survey used by\nMultiple outcome measures are reported including drinking onset by baseline nondrinkers, any\nalcohol use, average amount per occasion, frequency of consumption, binge drinking, and other\nmeasures such as maximum amount. A difficulty here is that drinking onset tends to cover any use,\nwhich does not necessarily imply continued or frequent use of alcohol. The same problem applies to\ncurrent or regular drinking as an outcome, usually defined as any alcohol use in the 30 days prior to\nthe survey. All outcome measures rely on self-reports by the respondents, but it is difficult to determine\nif any cross-checks are included in the survey questions. The studies cover a range of outcomes and use\ndifferent statistical models, which makes quantitative summaries more difficult to achieve. The\nexceptions are those studies that examine drinking onset and behaviors by baseline nondrinkers and\nemploy logistic (or log-link) regression models.\nIn order to isolate the effects of alcohol advertising and promotion on youth drinking behaviors, it is\nnecessary to control for important covariates or confounders. Lists of included covariates are reported\nin the last column of the Appendix table. Substantial diversity is revealed in the lists. In many cases,\nsocial learning theory is cited as a basis for the model specification for advertising, but there is little\ndiscussion of the important covariates that permit a valid test of the effect of advertising in this theory.\nMost model specifications are rather ad hoc, and are not guided by a well-defined theoretical model. A\nfew studies are unclear as to the final list of covariates [90,93]. Some studies include only a few basic\ndemographics [76,77,87,91] or exclude important variables such as parental or peer\nWhat is required in order for the studies to pass an internal validity test? First, the studies need a\nbetter rationale for the model specification. A starting point is provided by Ellickson et al. [79], where\n15 covariates are divided into several broad categories, including social influences (e.g., peer drinking),\nsocial bonds (religiosity, parental monitoring), attitudes and behavior (impulsivity), and demographics\n(gender, etc.). In Henriksen et al. [83], the categories are social influences (peer drinking),\npsychosocial risk factors (school performance), and demographics. Classifications such as these serve\nto indicate the presence or absence of important explanatory variables and facilitate comparisons across\nstudies. Consulting other surveys in this area would be helpful, such as the review of familial\ninfluences by Avenevoli and Merikangas [95]. Second, more extensive testing of model specifications\nshould be carried out in the form of a robustness check or sensitivity analysis. This is a standard\npractice in econometrics, but almost never included (or reported) in longitudinal studies. Formal\nmethods of model specification such as Hendry`s general-to-specific procedures should be\nconsidered [96]. Correlations or variance inflation factors among the covariates are seldom reported to\nsee if there is extensive duplication of information due to multicollinearity. Full reporting of empirical\nresults also is encouraged as some studies lack p-values (or standard errors) or fail to report coefficient\nThird, some studies use more than one market area and need to consider the inclusion of\nmarket-area variables, such as beverage prices, regulations, average income, and other aggregate\nvariables. This is standard practice in econometric studies, including those based on survey data such\nas Markowitz and Grossman [97] for alcohol regulation and Czart et al. [98] for smoking regulation.\nTwo nationwide longitudinal alcohol studies for the US use samples of over 6500 youth [85,92], but\nneither includes location-specific variables that might be important for youthful decisions. Other\nwhich also might require additional data. Aggregate variables also may be required for studies in which\nthe follow-up survey is more than three years after the baseline survey, such as Casswell et al. [75].\nThe necessity of controlling for the market environment does not seem to have been considered by\nsurvey researchers. The importance of prices for youthful drinking and smoking speaks against this\nomission in survey studies. This issue is discussed further in Section 6.\n4.3. Alcohol Advertising Studies: Measures of Advertising and Promotion\nThe information in the Appendix table reveals a wide variety of measures of advertising and other\nforms of promotion for alcohol. A diverse set of empirical results also is revealed. Upon close\nexamination, there are studies with negative, null, and positive results for advertisements, sometimes in\nthe same study [75,79,87,90]. Results for some variables, such as TV exposure and other mass media,\nare especially fragile. In Table 2, I first provide a narrative summary of the advertising measures,\nmaking note of the range of measures, studies that restrict the variables to one or two covariates, and\nother specification and measurement errors. Second, I provide a quantitative summary of the results for\na selected group of 12 studies that estimate a logistic (or log-link) model.\nTable 2. Advertising-Promotion Variables by Study: Alcohol.\nAdvertising-Promotion Variable Studies (ref. no.) Using This Variable\nAdvertising receptivity index (ABI, favorite ad, brand) [83]\nBrand recognition, brand recall or favorite brand [76,83 (2 types),90 (2 types)]\nAdvertising expenditures in local media market [89]\nRadio listening [77]\nTable 2. Cont.\nMagazine reading, magazines with alcohol ads [77,79]\nOutdoor displays (billboards, outside store ads) [86 (4 types)]\nConcession stands at events; entertainment portrayals [77,78,79]\nThere are several critical points to make about this information. First, there is little replication of\nmeasures across studies, making assessment more difficult. For example, six studies use general TV\nviewing habits as a covariate, but this is unrelated to exposure to alcohol ads and might be a surrogate\nfor personality traits. Four studies use ownership of an alcohol-branded item (ABI) as a covariate and\nfive studies use movie portrayals of alcohol. However, there is overlapping information in the sets of\nstudies. Two German studies [81,82] use the same sample to examine two different measures of movie\nexposure. McClure et al. [84] and Sargent et al. [88] use the same New England sample to study the\neffects of ABIs and movies, respectively. McClure et al. [85] and Wills et al. [92] use the same\nnationwide US sample to study ABIs and movies, respectively. Hence there is less independent\ninformation than might be apparent from Table 2. Further, these studies are misspecified due to the\nomission of the other promotion variables; that is, there is no statistical rationale for regressing alcohol\noutcomes on ABIs in one study and omitting it as a covariate in a related study of movie exposure. In\ngeneral, this will bias the advertising coefficient in each study toward a larger positive value. The same\ncritical comments apply to other overlapping studies, including the studies by Collins et al. [77] and\nEllickson et al. [79] for South Dakota students.\nSecond, given the variety of advertising measures in Table 2, it is difficult to understand why so\nmany studies severely restrict the number of measures or fail to validate the measures with more\ncomplete models. A few studies experiment with general indexes such as advertising receptivity and\nliking/awareness of ads and brands. For example, in Henriksen et al. [83], a composite index of\nreceptivity to alcohol marketing is based on survey responses for: (1) having a favorite alcohol\nadvertisement; and (2) owning or wanting to own alcohol promotion items. Based on responses,\nindividuals are divided into minimal, moderate, and high receptivity groups. Henriksen et al. [83] find\nstatistical associations between high receptivity and drinking onset and current drinking, but the model\nis poorly specified and receptivity is not a robust variable. As pointed out by Heckman [73], it is\nimportant to control for all other plausible factors in order to establish a causal relationship, but\nHenriksen et al. [83] exclude all familial variables. Further, it is possible that marketing receptivity is\ncapturing unobserved attitudes and preferences toward drinking. That is, survey respondents who are\nmore likely to drink would be more likely to be classified as high-receptivity individuals, all other\nthings held equal. Henriksen et al. [83] provide evidence that alcohol-marketing receptivity is\npositively associated with variables for individual risk-taking, lower grades, perceived prevalence, and\nperceived approval. Hence, high receptivity may simply be capturing these and other underlying\nattitudes and preferences. A plausible conclusion in this and other longitudinal studies is that\nadolescents with a greater preference for risk or higher perceptions of drinking prevalence/approval are\nmore likely to drink. In McClure et al. [85], ownership of an ABI is positively associated with\nvariables for sensation-seeking, rebelliousness, and peer drinking. Including an interaction variable\nbetween these preference variables and ABI ownership would be useful to determine if the effect of\nABI-ownership is greater for certain groups of youth. Only a few of the 20 studies have experimented\nwith interaction effects [80,86,90]. Similar comments apply to studies that measure liking of ads.\nThird, evidence on brand recognition or brand approval is not clear evidence regarding the general\neffects of advertising-marketing on youth drinking behaviors or evidence of a causal effect of\nadvertising on youthful drinking. It is not surprising that youth (as well as adults) have a favorite brand\nor are able to recognize brands in favorite advertisements. There are informational advantages to new\nconsumers to associate their consumption with a well-known brand, so economic incentives work in\nfavor of choosing a brand, especially a well-known brand. Well-known brands also tend to be highly\nadvertised. However, brand-related variables do not provide convincing evidence of a causal link with\nyouthful choices. It would not be surprising that individuals who watch lots of broadcasts of\nprofessional football or auto racing also own more branded merchandise related to those sports. It is\nnot logical to argue that ownership of the merchandise caused them to watch the broadcasts or express\nloyalty for a particular team. Brand loyalty is different than a causal effect of advertising.\nGiven these shortcomings, a final issue is to examine the studies for consistency of empirical\nresults, which is a simple test of external validity. Table 3 presents a summary of the results for 12\nstudies that use a logistic or log-link model, which draws on my comprehensive meta-analysis of\nlongitudinal studies [51]. Results are summarized for the odds ratio for advertising-marketing variables\nfor drinking onset and other drinking behaviors (frequency, amount, binge drinking, etc.). Advertising\nand marketing variables can be divided into four categories: (1) mass media (TV, magazines,\nbillboards, etc.); (2) promotion portrayals (ABIs, movies, videos); (3) other media exposures (in-store\ndisplays, concessions); and (4) attitudinal or subjective measures (liking of ads, brand recall, etc.). In\nNelson [51], I demonstrate that publication bias is a substantial problem in longitudinal studies, which\nis ignored by prior systematic surveys [48-50]. Publication bias occurs when the publication of\nempirical results depend on the direction, significance, and magnitude of the results [99,100]. Due to\nemphasis on statistical significance, published studies are likely to be skewed toward larger effects. As\na consequence, the published studies comprise a biased sample, so the results of a literature review or\nmeta-analysis can be misleading. Hence, it is important to take note of insignificant results in\nlongitudinal studies of advertising and youth alcohol behaviors.\nIn Table 3, there are 63 estimates of the effects of advertising and promotion on adolescent drinking.\nA variety of drinking behaviors are examined, including onset of drinking, maintenance by baseline\ndrinkers, drinking amounts by beverage, frequency, and binge drinking. Only 21 of 63 estimates (33%)\nare statistically significant at the standard 95% confidence level. This does not support\nrecommendations for bans of advertising. For drinking onset, only one estimate for mass media is\nstatistically significant. For other drinking behaviors, only 5 of 14 estimates for mass media are\nstatistically significant, but 4 of these estimates are from the same study by Stacy et al. for Los Angeles\nyouth [90]. Ten of 15 estimates for promotional portrayals, including ABIs and movies, are significant,\nbut several z-statistics are close to the lower limit of 2.0. The distribution is right-skewed and several\nstudies produce point estimates that are outliers (more than two standard deviations above the mean),\nespecially the estimates for movie displays in [81] and [82]. Several estimates for ABIs in [77,80,85]\nare close to this cutoff.\nFinally, in Table 3, there are 18 estimates of the effect of TV viewing on drinking onset and\ndrinking behaviors, which are significant in 7 cases and insignificant in 11 cases. Both estimates for\nmagazines are insignificant. There are 10 estimates for ABIs, 6 of which are significant and 4 are\ninsignificant. A similar problem exists for studies of movie displays. Except for one estimate for\nin-store displays, none of the 10 estimates for other promotions are significant. There are 8 estimates\nfor subjective liking of ads, awareness of ads and self-reported ad exposure. Only one estimate is\nstatistically significant. None of the 7 estimates for brand awareness are statistically significant. These\nresults raise questions of what exactly is being captured by more objective measures of marketing\nexposure. One possibility is that youth who are predisposed to drink for unobserved reasons also are\nattracted to advertising and promotion of alcohol. This means generally that the models used in\nlongitudinal studies should treat measures of advertising and marketing as endogenous variables, and\nnot predetermined or exogenous variables. This issue is addressed below.\nTable 3.

Tobacco Advertising: Model Specification in Twenty-Six Studies\nTwenty-six tobacco studies were determined to meet the following criteria: (1) a longitudinal study\nwith baseline and follow-up sample(s) of youth; (2) one or more smoking behaviors as outcomes\n(smoking susceptibility, onset, regular smoker, etc.); (3) one or more advertising, marketing,\npromotional, brand recognition or receptivity measures as covariates, determined at baseline (one\nexception); and (4) the study uses a multivariate statistical procedure such as logistic regressions (one\nexception). Excluded are longitudinal studies that use descriptive methods for analysis or which\nexamine smoking intentions, anti-smoking media campaigns, young adults exclusively, or smoking\nregulations. Some studies noted below use the same sample of respondents, but analyze the data in\ndifferent ways. For the most part, the studies were identified by using previous surveys and searches\non MEDLINE, PsycINFO or Google, and reference lists in more recent publications. Experimental,\ncross-sectional, and time-series or econometric studies are excluded from this review. Three previous\nincluding two nationwide studies. The other countries studied are Australia (2 studies), Germany (2),\nMexico (1), Spain (1), and the United Kingdom (1). Some studies use several waves of a continuing\nsurvey, such as the studies using the California Tobacco Survey (CTS). Some studies use identical or\nvery similar samples: there are three studies for Massachusetts [104,105,117]; two studies for\nthemes in these overlapping studies are emphasis on different tobacco advertising methods or different\nadvertising receptivity on smoking susceptibility, controlling for the covariate curiosity about\nsmoking. Virtually the same sample is used by Distefan et al. [109] to examine the effects of smoking\nby a favorite movie star on smoking onset, but curiosity is omitted as a covariate. The use of\noverlapping samples means the amount of independent information in the table is less than what is\napparent. In some cases, the empirical analysis is conducted using subsamples by age, gender, race,\nrespondents is very important for measuring the influence of advertising on smoking behaviors. Across\nthe 26 studies, the range of ages for respondents at baseline is about 10\u00ad15 years (grades 6\u00ad9), but one\nstudy [111] includes older respondents and one [123] uses younger respondents. Attrition and\ncompletion rates in the surveys are difficult to determine exactly, but most of the surveys indicate a\ncompletion rate from baseline to follow-up of about 65%. In several of the CTS studies, the rate is\nonly four months, suggesting this study might be better treated as a cross-sectional study. Several\nstudies use surveys separated by 4 to 6 years, which raises issues of confounding due to trend effects.\nThe outcome measures in the studies include regular smoking, onset of smoking, experimenting\nwith smoking, susceptibility to smoking, and a smoking index. A few studies use two or more\noutcomes [117,123,126]. Except for regular smoking and experimentation, these measures present\ninterpretation problems. Onset measures combine experimenters, occasional smokers, and regular\nsmokers, while susceptibility measures combine susceptible nonsmokers with experimenters and\n(possibly) regular smokers. The ordinal smoking indexes combine all individuals from\nnon-susceptibiles to regular smokers, but it is unclear if a linear scale is appropriate for this task. It is\nsometimes argued that using smoking susceptibility as an outcome is a more sensitive measure than\nactual smoking [119], but this ignores the possibility that the two groups (susceptibiles and smokers)\nmight have fundamentally different responses to advertising stimuli. Unfortunately, this issue has not\nbeen addressed within the confines of a single sample of respondents.\nIn order to accurately isolate the effects of tobacco advertising and promotion on youth smoking\nbehaviors, it is necessary to control for important covariates or confounders. Lists of included\ncovariates are reported in the last column of the Appendix table. Substantial diversity is revealed in the\nlists. Most studies include basic demographic information (age, gender, race/ethnicity) and most\nstudies include variables for parental and peer smoking, but there are exceptions [111,117,119].\nMeasures of risk-taking or impulsiveness are included in some, but not all,\nBiener and Siegel [104], use simple bivariate regressions to select the variables in their final model, but\nfail to consider interactions between, say, receptivity and parental smoking and fail to examine\nmulticollinearity issues. Several studies test for mediation effects by using multilevel, path analysis or\nvariable and do not test for possible endogeneity (see below). In a number of cases, full results for\nvariable for curiosity about smoking is included as a possible covariate for experimentation and\nsusceptibility to smoking. Past curiosity about smoking at baseline is a strong predictor of\nexperimentation and susceptibility at follow-up. However, including curiosity as a regressor leads to\ninsignificant results for receptivity to tobacco advertising in both regressions. This raises an important\nissue of omitted variable bias in other studies, since this is the only study that considers curiosity as an\nintermediate goal of advertising. Pierce et al. [116] argue that curiosity appears to be an antecedent to\nsusceptibility to smoking, but it is unclear why only higher levels of receptivity are associated with\ncuriosity in a cross-sectional regression. As discussed below, curiosity as a personality trait could be\nused to construct an instrumental variable estimate of the advertising-marketing covariate [64,127].\nWhat is required in order for the studies to pass an internal validity test? In many cases, social\nlearning theory is cited as a basis for the model specification for advertising, but there is little\ndiscussion of the important covariates that permit a valid test of the effects of advertising in this theory.\nMost model specifications are rather ad hoc, and are not guided by a well-defined theoretical model.\nFirst, the studies need a better rationale for model specification. Several studies provide categorical\nsummaries of the covariates, such as that in Alexander et al. [102] where variables are classified\naccording to attitudes, knowledge, social and personal factors and usage of other drugs. For\nmost part, longitudinal studies simply present a list of covariates with little justification, although\nsometimes there is a supporting cross-sectional study that delves into the specifics of the survey\ninstrument and sampling procedures [108,128]. Second, more extensive testing of model specification\nshould be carried out in the form of a robustness check or sensitivity analysis (see above on alcohol\nstudies). Third, some studies use multiarea samples, such as two nationwide surveys for the\nUS [110,121]. More generally, all of the tobacco studies employ broad geographic areas, where prices,\neconomic conditions, smoking regulations, health information and costs, and other variables can differ\nacross jurisdictions. Studies for states as large as California, Massachusetts, and North Carolina need to\nconsider including variables that control for the market environment as well as the social environment.\nThis omission is a common theme for all alcohol and tobacco studies. An alternative approach, widely\nused in econometrics, is a fixed-effects panel model, with binary indicator variables for schools,\njurisdictions, states, etc. [64,69,70]. Unobserved heterogeneity is captured by the fixed-effect intercept\nfor each group in the panel. No longitudinal study has incorporated this methodology.\n4.5. Tobacco Advertising Studies: Measures of Advertising and Promotion\nReflecting restrictions on tobacco advertising, longitudinal studies have relied on fewer measures of\nadvertising and promotion compared to similar studies for alcohol. Allowing for multiple measures in\nsome studies, the Appendix table indicates the following measures have been used: receptivity index,\nmovie-smoking exposure, general TV viewing, knowledge of brands, approval/favorite cigarette ads,\nownership of a cigarette-branded item, and magazine exposure. None of these measures is validated in\nthe sense that it is shown to be related to actual advertising campaigns or public regulations that have\naffected tobacco advertising. General measures, such as TV viewing, are especially suspect.\nReceptivity to tobacco marketing has been used often as an advertising measure, but it is a rather broad\nand amorphous index. As originally proposed by Pierce et al. [114], receptivity captures exposure to a\ncommunication and a cognitive response that indicates an understanding of the communication. Survey\nrespondents are asked three questions in order to determine their position on a receptivity scale, such\nas: (1) Do you own or would you be willing to use a cigarette-branded item (CBI), such as a t-shirt?;\n(2) What brand of cigarette was most advertised in ads you have recently seen on billboards or in\nmagazines?; and (3) What is the name of the cigarette brand of your favorite advertisement?\nDepending on the study, respondents are considered to be highly receptive if the first question is\nanswered affirmatively; moderately receptive if the third question is answered with a specific brand,\nbut they answer the first question negatively; and low receptivity if the second question is answered,\nbut the respondent does not name a favorite ad or own a CBI. Hence, the receptivity index is: minimal\n(no brand, no favorite ad, no CBI); low (brand, no favorite ad, no CBI); moderate (brand, favorite ad,\nno CBI); and high receptivity (willing/has CBI).\nThere are several things to note critically about receptivity indexes. First, receptivity is largely about\nbrand recognition and not about exposure to different levels of advertising. Hence, it is possible that\nreceptivity merely tests the weak theory of advertising or demonstrates that advertised brands are\nrecognized by smokers. No causal interpretation should be assigned to this relationship. Second,\nreceptivity measures have not been validated by showing they measure exposure to actual cigarette\nadvertising campaigns. The terminology used in longitudinal studies confuses personal preferences\nwith advertising exposure [73]. Third, respondents with high receptivity may differ in important but\nunobservable ways from those with lower levels of receptivity. It should not be assumed that\nrespondents who wear a branded t-shirt (or are willing to wear one) are in all ways identical to those\nwho do not, except for the observable covariates in the regression equation. Fourth, as discussed\nbelow, receptivity and indeed all measures of advertising and marketing involve choices on the part of\nthe respondent. Each respondent chooses to own or not own a CBI. Each respondent chooses to view\nmore or fewer R-rated movies. The choice process is fundamental to testing of theoretical models of\nthe effects of advertising and marketing on youthful behaviors regarding alcohol and tobacco.\nLongitudinal studies in psychology and public health ignore this part of the problem and treat\nreceptivity as a purely exogenous treatment, and thereby seek to estimate a dose-response\nrelationship. The level of dosage is not randomly assigned to each respondent, but is rather chosen by\nthe respondent. Hence, in order to demonstrate causality, a detailed model of the choice process and the\naccompanying incentive structure must be sought [73].\nGiven these shortcomings, the final issue is to examine the studies for consistency of empirical\nresults. Table 4 presents a summary for 18 studies that use a logistic or log-link model. Results are\nsummarized for the odds ratio and 95% confidence interval for groups of studies by outcome: regular\nsmoker, onset of smoking, experimentation, susceptibility, and smoking indexes. Overall, there are 63\nempirical results reported in Table 4, which are insignificant in 32 cases (51%). Low receptivity is\ninsignificant in 6 of 6 cases and moderate receptivity is insignificant in 7 of 10 cases. High receptivity\nis insignificant in 3 of 10 cases. Overall, receptivity is insignificant in 16 of 26 cases (62%). The lack\nof robust results is an indication of theoretical weaknesses or evidence of measurement errors. The\nresults for high receptivity may reveal only an association between brand loyalty and smoking\nbehaviors. The results are even poorer for general TV exposure. There are 8 results for TV-viewing,\nwhich are significant in 2 cases and insignificant in 6 others. For movie exposure, the results are\ninsignificant in 8 of 22 cases. The distribution is right-skewed and some coefficient estimates are\noutliers (i.e., more than two standard deviations above the mean), especially values for TV viewing\nin [110]. It might be argued that the evidence is stronger for high levels of receptivity or exposure, but\nit also might be the case that youth who wear cigarette-branded t-shirts, watch lots of TV and videos,\nand go to lots of R-rated movies are different in fundamental ways from youth who moderate these\nbehaviors. Finally, no study includes more than two measures of advertising and marketing, so there is\nomitted variable bias in all studies. One study [112] merely reports separate regressions for movies and\nTV. Overall, this is a generally weak set of results that fail to support either a causal relationship\nbetween advertising and youth smoking or the implied public policy of advertising bans.\nTable 4.

[118] Smoking status index\nOwn or willing to\nown CBI\nAs shown in the Appendix, there are ten longitudinal studies of movie-smoking exposure and youth\nby Charlesworth and Glantz [129] of the movie-exposure literature argues that there is strong\nempirical evidence that smoking in movies increases adolescent smoking initiation (p1516). However,\nOmidvari et al. [130] point out that smoking prevalence in US movies is no more common than in real\nlife (23.2% vs. 24.8%, respectively). They reviewed 447 movies that depicted contemporary American\ntop 10 movies on the weekly box office charts, so they are in general popular films that are seen by\nmany viewers. Overall, the depiction of smoking in movies is more prevalent for men, antagonistic\ncharacters (bad guys and villains), lower socioeconomic class (SEC) characters, whites compared\nto non-whites, independent movies rather than studio films, and R-rated movies. In particular, smoking\nprevalence in R-rated movies is higher than the general US population for both studio films (30.5%)\nand independent productions (50.6%). The majority of R-rated films portray smokers as white males,\nlower-middle SEC, and antagonists. Much has been written negatively about product placement of\ncigarettes in cinema. Omidvari et al. [130] point out that, contrary to previous reports, if there is a\nconscious attempt to influence public smoking habits, it is being orchestrated by independent movies,\nand not by Hollywood (p751). These conclusions are not unexpected. Independent producers\n(entrants) must differentiate themselves from established producers (incumbents) by making more\nanti-establishment films that appeal to particular tastes and preferences. Thus, scientific evidence on\nmovie portrayals of smoking points to unobserved tastes and preferences as a motivator of adolescent\nchoices related to movie viewing. This issue deserves greater attention in longitudinal studies.\n5. Endogenous Regressors, Sample Selection Bias, and Unobserved Heterogeneity\nThe analysis in this section concerns estimation and sampling issues that heretofore have not been\nconsidered by researchers that estimate longitudinal models of youth drinking and smoking. Previous\narticles by Geweke and Martin [131], Heckman [73], and Heckman et al. [132] provide insightful\ndiscussions of endogeneity and sample selection for a limited number of early smoking\nrecent smoking studies. To the best of my knowledge, the analysis in these articles has escaped the\nattention of public health researchers. It is useful to begin with an intuitive discussion of the problems\nbefore turning to evidence from the longitudinal studies.\nConsider a sample of youth where a portion owns an alcohol-branded item (ABI). Suppose the\nresearch problem is to identify the determinates of drinking behavior, conditional on baseline\nownership of an ABI (yes or no) and other covariates for demographics, attitudes toward drinking,\npersonality traits, social environment, and so forth. The objective is to use the empirical relationship\nfor the sample to make predictions about the effect of ABI-ownership on drinking behaviors of the\nadolescent population. That is, the investigator desires ultimately to predict the effect on drinking from\nreducing or eliminating ABIs for the population as a whole. Endogeneity occurs when an independent\nvariable included in the model is potentially a choice variable or is correlated with unobservables\nincluded in the error term of the regression equation. The problem is illustrated by assuming that each\nyouth has a baseline endowment of observable and unobservable personal and social characteristics.\nObservable characteristics might include age, gender, race/ethnicity, school performance, family\ndrinking, and peer drinking. Unobservable characteristics might include genetics, risk propensity,\ndiscount rate on future health, feelings of invulnerability, curiosity about drinking, schooling prior to\nbaseline, attitudes toward authority, crime and other deviance, family health status, family wealth,\nsocial status, legal environment, market prices, and so forth. Note that many of the unobservables may\npredate the baseline survey, such as genetic characteristics or early upbringing.\nThe dependent variable for drinking behavior and the covariate for ABI-ownership are observed for\nall youth in the sample. ABI-ownership is endogenous if individuals` decision to acquire an ABI is\ncorrelated with unobservables that affect drinking behavior. For instance, if curiosity affects ownership\nand is an omitted covariate in the regression for drinking behavior, then the failure to control for\ncuriosity will yield a biased estimate for ABI-ownership due to its correlation with the error term. The\nbias is positive in this example, so the effect of ABIs on drinking is overstated. The least-squares\nestimator is biased and inconsistent (asymptotically biased), so an alternative estimator is often\ndesirable. It is a characteristic of many econometric studies that investigators attempt to model both the\nrelationship between the input factors determining the outcome (drinking) and the choices leading to\nobservation of some of those factors [132]. Examples of potentially endogenous regressors are\nABI-ownership, attendance at R-rated movies, and self-reported exposure to advertising. The\ninstrumental variable technique is often used for endogenous regressors and is discussed below.\nSelection bias occurs when the dependent variable is only observed for a restricted, non-random\nsample. The problem may arise due to non-participation (refusals) during the baseline survey or from\nattrition (drop-outs) during the follow-up survey. At both points in time, individuals decide whether\nto participate or not, so there is self-selection in the sample used in the analysis. In his seminal article\non this problem, Heckman [68] demonstrated that bias is created because fitted regression functions\nconfound the behavioral parameters of interest with parameters of the function determining the\nprobability of entrance into [or exit from] the sample (p154). Selection bias also may arise if the\ninvestigator decides to screen the data in various ways, such as pre-screening of survey participants,\nfavoring longer time intervals over shorter intervals, or arbitrarily discarding observations with missing\ndata. Selection by investigators also can lead to a non-random sample.\nSuppose that owners and non-owners of ABIs are chosen randomly from the population and have\nsimilar endowments of observable and unobservable characteristics. A randomly-chosen baseline\nsample should have average characteristics for ABI-owners and non-owners that mirror the average\ncharacteristics of the population. However, participation in the surveys is a personal decision, so the\nrespondents are unlikely to be randomly distributed. Sample selection bias arises when some\ncomponent of the participation decision also is relevant to drinking outcomes, but is unobserved [133].\nAccounting for observables is reasonably straight-forward, but controlling for unobservables is not.\nThat is, when the relationship between the survey participation decision and the drinking decision is\npurely through observables, appropriate specification of the regression equation will account for\ndifferences among individuals in the sample. Sample selection bias will not arise solely because of\ndifferences in observable characteristics. If the participation decision also depends on unobservables\n(curiosity, attitudes toward authority, family wealth, etc.) and these characteristics are correlated with\nunobservables affecting respondents` drinking decision, then the model is misspecified. If the analyst\nestimates a regression of drinking behavior conditional on only observables, the model fails to account\nfor an additional process or influence on behavior, namely, the process that determines whether the\nrespondent participates in the baseline survey or drops-out of the follow-up survey. A bias arises due to\nsample self-selection, which is another way of saying the sample is non-random due to behavioral\nchoices by participants. There are several ways for dealing with selection bias such as insuring high\nresponse rates; conducting a follow-up survey; the Heckman two-stage approach; and other estimation\nmethods [69,70,131,133]. Finally, it is clear that in longitudinal studies both endogeneity bias and\nsample selection bias can be present in the same study.\n5.1. Endogeneity Bias in Longitudinal Studies\nIn econometrics, statistics, and epidemiology, the problem of endogeneity occurs when an\nexplanatory variable is correlated with the error term in the regression model. This implies that\nregression coefficients estimated by ordinary least-squares (OLS) are biased and inconsistent. The\ncorrelation may arise due to omission of a relevant confounding variable (specification bias),\nmeasurement errors in an explanatory variable (errors-in-variable bias), or joint determination of an\nexplanatory variable with the dependent variable (simultaneity or reverse causality bias). The method\nof instrumental variables (IV) is frequently used to deal with issues of endogeneity [64,134]. Briefly, in\nthe IV model there are one or more variables (the instruments) that affect the endogenous\nexplanatory variable, but only impact the dependent variable through the explanatory variable. For\nexample, suppose that parental political beliefs are correlated with ABI-ownership by a son or\ndaughter, but are not correlated with the youth`s drinking behavior. In order for political beliefs to be a\nvalid instrument, the following conditions must hold: (1) the instrument must be correlated with the\nendogenous explanatory variable, conditional on other covariates; (2) the instrument cannot be\ncorrelated with the error term in the equation of interest, otherwise it is an invalid instrument; and\n(3) the selected instrument should be a strong predictor of the endogenous variable in question,\notherwise the predicted values of the endogenous variable will have too little variation. A weak\ninstrument is a variable that is weakly correlated with the endogenous explanatory\nvariable [127,133,134]. For instance, in a study of the effects of smoking on adult physical functional\nstatus (i.e., health), Leigh and Schembri [135] argue that smoking affects health (and vice versa), but\ncigarette prices only affect smoking. Hence, they choose price as an instrument in the IV method to\nobtain predicted values for smoking for inclusion in the health regression, and report that the true\neffect of smoking on health is larger than conventional methods have estimated (p290).\nThe standard approach to IV estimation--referred to as Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS)--is, first,\nto regress the endogenous explanatory variable on the instrument(s) and all exogenous covariates (age,\ngender, race, school performance, etc.) to obtain predicted values for ABI-ownership. In many cases,\nthe first-stage regression is of interest in its own right because it explains ownership behavior. Call the\npredicted values ABI-hat. Second, regress drinking behavior on ABI-hat and all other exogenous\ncovariates, which will yield a statistically consistent estimate for ABI-ownership. Depending on the\nsoftware used, the correct standard errors in the IV procedure may require additional estimation [64].\nSome caution is required if the model is inherently nonlinear [136]. Various statistical tests for\npotential endogeneity also are available such as the widely-used test suggested by Hausman [137].\nNone of the longitudinal studies of youth drinking and smoking seem to have recognized the potential\nfor endogenous regressors. In particular, all advertising and marketing covariates are treated as\nexogenous. Hence, all longitudinal studies are potentially subject to endogeneity bias. However, a few\nstudies do provide descriptive analyses of the advertising covariate. Note that dealing with endogeneity\nalso requires addressing the problem of the correct set of covariates for advertising receptivity and\nexposure, which is equally troublesome. I briefly summarize the results in two studies of alcohol\nbehavior and two studies of smoking behavior that describe underlying aspects of the ownership or\nexposure decisions, which demonstrate non-random assignment among participants or\npotential endogeneity.\nMcClure et al. [85] study the effect of ABI-ownership on initiation of drinking and binge drinking\nconducted at 8, 16, and 24 months, and information on ABI-ownership was acquired at 8 months. As\npart of the study, they examine the characteristics of adolescents that own ABIs using a multivariate\nlogistic regression and also report how the ABI was obtained. ABI-ownership is strongly and positively\nrelated to age of respondent, access to alcohol at home, sensation seeking, exposure to alcohol\nportrayals in movies, and susceptibility to alcohol use at baseline. Ownership also is positively related\nto peer drinking, rebelliousness, extracurricular activities, but not to television viewing, parental\ndrinking, parenting style, or academic performance. Variables for blacks and Hispanics are negative\npredictors of ownership. All of these variables are treated as exogenous and are covariates in\nregressions for initiation of alcohol use and binge drinking. Because ABI-ownership is a behavioral\nchoice, it is possible it is an endogenous regressor, which imparts bias to the reported coefficient\nestimates. In their discussion of the study`s limitations, the authors fail to recognize or comment on\nthis problem. Sargent et al. [88] study the effect of movie-alcohol use on drinking initiation in a sample\naverage at 17 months (range 12\u00ad26 months) after the baseline survey. As part of the study, they\nexamine bivariate logistic relationships between movie-alcohol exposure (in hours) and other\ncovariates in the drinking regression. They report that exposure to movie-alcohol use is significantly\nhigher in older adolescents; in males; adolescents who smoke; and in those with lower parental\neducation, poor school performance, lower levels of self-esteem, lower maternal support, and higher\nlevels of rebelliousness and sensation seeking. All of these variables are treated as exogenous and\nincluded in a logistic regression for drinking onset. Because movie exposure is a behavioral choice, it\nis possible it is an endogenous regressor, which imparts bias to the reported coefficient estimates. In\ntheir discussion of the study`s limitations, the authors fail to recognize or comment on this problem.\nBecause the ownership and exposure measures are shown to be predictable in a reasonable manner, the\npartial results in both drinking studies demonstrate that a multicausal model is required to understand\nrisky behavior by adolescents [132].\nSargent et al. [118] study the effect of CBI-ownership on smoking status (6-point index) in a sample\nestablished baseline smokers. Follow-up surveys are conducted in 1997 and 1998. As part of the study,\nthey examine bivariate logistic relationships between CBI-ownership and other baseline covariates.\nOwnership is positively related to male gender, smoking by family and peers, and smoking status at\nbaseline. In other words, male smokers at baseline are more likely to own or are more willing to use a\nCBI, regardless of other characteristics (age, school performance, parental education). No mention is\nmade in this study of the possibility that CBI-ownership is an endogenous variable. Instead,\nSargent et al. [118] claim that these data provide strong evidence supporting a causal link between\nprogression of smoking among adolescents and changes in their response to cigarette promotional\nitems (p326). This conclusion is premature. Wilkinson et al. [125] study the effect of movie-smoking\nexposure on smoking experimentation in a sample of 1300 Mexican-heritage adolescents, ages 11\u00ad13\npart of the study, they determine participants` level of exposure to movie smoking using 50 box office\nhits for the years 1999 to 2004. For each of eleven pairs of covariates, they calculate mean levels of\nexposure to smoking in movies and perform statistical tests for significant differences. Based on these\nsimple comparisons, movie exposure is more prevalent for older adolescents; for males; youth born in\nthe US; and those exhibiting higher-levels of risk-taking, anxiety, acculturation, school detention, and\nparental education. Movie exposure also is higher for baseline experimenters, adolescents with other\nsmokers in the household, and those respondents who had friends who smoke. The authors fail to\nrecognize that movie exposure also is a choice variable that might be endogenous in the\nsmoking regression.\nAs noted by Geweke and Martin [131], youth who have strongly favorable attitudes and\npreferences toward smoking will plausibly pay more attention to information of various kinds about\ncigarettes, are plausibly more likely to convey their preferences through the use of promotional\nproducts, and are plausibly more likely to start smoking at some point (p119). In a similar vein,\nHeckman et al. [132] argue that participants who have greater preferences for smoking might seek out\nand obtain more tobacco-related items, even if the items have no independent causal effect on their\ndesire to smoke (p43). Thus, a finding that CBIs or movie-exposure is associated with smoking\nbehavior does not demonstrate or prove causality. These four examinations of receptivity and exposure\nin the smoking and drinking studies are consistent with this behavioral interpretation and inconsistent\nwith a random assignment of these variables among adolescents. More complex and complete\nmulticausal models of choice behavior are required if longitudinal researchers desire to better measure\nyouth preferences for advertising and drinking or smoking outcomes.\n5.2. Selection Bias in Longitudinal Studies\nSample selection bias arises when a rule other than random sampling is used to sample from the\nunderlying population of interest. Distorted or unrepresentative sampling may be present in a study due\nto decisions by investigators or more frequently, and subtly, as a result of self-selection decisions on\nthe part of individuals being surveyed. Adolescents (or their parents) decide whether or not to\nparticipate in a school-based survey or telephone survey. Adolescents (or their parents) decide whether\nto participate in one or more follow-up surveys. In his seminal paper, Heckman [68] outlined an\neconomic model of self-selection and used it to demonstrate that selection bias can be treated as a\nspecification error that leads to biased estimates in an OLS regression. That is, variables that affect the\nparticipation decision are correlated with unobservables that affect the outcome of interest, such as\nadolescents` drinking or smoking behaviors. According to Vella [138], it may be possible to detect\nselection bias by studying differences in observables across subsamples. If the subsamples differ\nimportantly, this may indicate that there are unobservables that are correlated with the observed\noutcome variable. Heckman`s solution for dealing with the self-selection problem is a two-stage\nmodel. In brief, it is possible to obtain an estimate of the unobservables by, first, estimating a\nregression for participation. That is, use the information on attrition in the follow-up sample and\ncovariates to estimate a regression in which the binary dependent variable is the participation decision.\nThe expected values of the errors from the first-stage regression are used to calculate a new variable\n(called the inverse Mills ratio). The second-stage regression is for the outcome, but with the addition of\nthe new variable that corrects for misspecification arising from self-selection by survey participants.\nBecause Heckman`s procedure has a rather limited structure and is highly parameterized, a number of\nAre longitudinal survey studies subject to sample selection bias? Three pieces of information can be\npresented that pertain to this issue. First, an examination by Geweke and Martin [131] of the CTS\nsample used by Pierce et al. [114] to study the influence of advertising receptivity on adolescent\nsmoking. Second, the information contained in studies that estimate the outcome regression for\nimportant subsamples by age, gender, race, country of origin, and parenting style. Third, information\ncontained in many longitudinal studies on attrition in the follow-up sample.\nIn their critique of longitudinal studies of adolescent smoking, Geweke and Martin [131] obtained\nthe raw data used by Pierce et al. [114]. They use these data to demonstrate that Pierce`s sample is not\nrandom due to selection bias. Westat Inc., the firm that collected the CTS data on adolescent smoking,\nstarted with a random-digit dial survey for 78,000 randomly-selected telephone numbers for the entire\nstate of California. Of this number, 44,000 were residential household telephone numbers. From the\nhousehold sample, there were 10,000 refusals and 3000 other non-responses. These omitted households\ncontained an estimated 3006 adolescents eligible for the youth part of the survey. Because Westat\nprovided information on the broad purpose of the survey, Geweke and Martin [131] argue that it is\nplausible that the 22.9% of the random sample of households that refused to complete the screening\ninterview have attitudes and experiences relating to smoking . . . that are not representative of the\npopulation at large \u00ad that is, that are not random (p122). In the remaining 31,000 households, there\nwere 6862 adolescents who were eligible for the youth portion of the survey, but 727 (11%) of these\nindividuals refused to participate and 604 were unavailable for other reasons. A total of 5,531\ninterviews were completed for the baseline, but 320 youth (6%) refused to participate in the follow-up\nsurvey, 371 were unavailable for other reasons, and 1464 could not be located. The final sample size\nwas 3,376, which is only 34.2% of the randomly-selected youth at the start. This is far from the\n85-90% that is the target response rate in survey studies and not even close to the 80% rate reported by\nfail to address selection bias in these data. Geweke and Martin [131] then go on to study the probability\nof re-interview. Using a logistic regression, they show that re-interview was less likely for older youth,\nmales, non-whites, less academically inclined, and smokers. They use this information to reject the\nhypothesis that the follow-up sample is a random subsample of the baseline sample. Finally, they study\npossible reassignments of the excluded respondents on Pierce`s study results. Geweke and\nMartin [131] observe that even modest sample selection problems can account for the relationship\nbetween receptivity and smoking progression found in Pierce et al. (p127). They conclude that this\nstudy is so beset by sample selection problems that it cannot be used with any reliability (p129), even\nfor the limited purpose of descriptive-inferential modeling.\nA second piece of information on selection bias is found in studies that estimate subsample\nregressions, which tend to demonstrate that empirical results for advertising receptivity and exposure\ndiffer importantly depending on how the data are divided. If the full sample is biased in some manner\ntoward the subgroup with a stronger response to advertising, the study results will be biased in the\npositive direction. The opposite bias is equally likely, but the issue in part is the direction of bias due to\nself-selection at baseline, which is not observed or reported in most studies. In alcohol studies, separate\nresults by gender are reported by Caswell et al. [75] for New Zealand youth. They report that liking of\nadvertising is marginally significant for males and insignificant for females. Connolly et al. [78] also\nstudied New Zealand youth using similar survey data. They find that for males and females, none of the\nmedia variables are significant for wine/spirits, but some media variables for beer are significant for\nmales and some are negative for females. Fisher et al. [80] also divide the sample by gender.\nOwnership of an ABI is significant for both males and females and the coefficient magnitudes are\nsimilar. Snyder et al. [89] present results for the full sample (ages 15-26) and for a subsample of\nyounger participants (ages 15\u00ad20). The results for three advertising variables are similar, except that\nadvertising exposure within-individuals is not significant in the full sample. Only mean advertising\nexposure is marginally significant for both samples, but it is subject to measurement errors. The\nsubsample results in some studies of adolescent drinking are suggestive of selection bias, but the\nevidence is limited to a few simple comparisons. As is common practice in econometrics, it would be\nhelpful for investigators to provide additional empirical results in the form of a sensitivity analysis for\nimportant subsamples by gender, race/ethnicity, school performance, parental drinking, parenting style,\nand so forth.\nIn smoking studies, Charlton and Blair [106] report results by gender for youth in the UK, ages\n12\u00ad13 years. The risk of smoking onset is somewhat greater for girls compared to boys. In particular,\nability to name at least one cigarette brand is significant for girls and not for boys. However, having a\nfavorite cigarette advertisement and watching cigarette-sponsored TV sports programs is insignificant\nfor both genders. Jackson et al. [112] report separate results for black and white adolescents, ages\n12-14 years. After adjusting for covariates, high-exposure to R-rated movies is insignificant for blacks\nand significant for whites. However, variables for hours of TV viewing per day and per week are\ninsignificant for both races. Pierce et al. [115] report separate results for respondents with more- and\nless-authoritative parents. Never-smokers at baseline with more-authoritative parents are more likely to\nbegin smoking if they also had a high-level of receptivity to tobacco advertising and promotion. The\nreceptivity variables at all levels are insignificant for respondents with less-authoritative parents. These\nfindings are somewhat surprising and Pierce et al. [115] interpret their results in terms of\ncommunication theory, but ignore the possibility of selection bias. Wilkinson et al. [125] report\nseparate results by country of origin for a sample of Hispanic adolescents (Mexican born, US born).\nExposure to smoking in movies is significant for Mexican-born youth, although the authors note that\nthe number of high-exposure youth is small for both subsamples. Overall, the subsample results in\nsome studies suggest that unobserved influences may create sample selection bias according to gender,\nrace/ethnicity, curiosity, and parenting style. As a consequence, sensitivity analyses are recommended.\nFinally, many longitudinal studies report information on attrition of participants in the baseline\nsample, i.e., those respondents who dropped-out of the follow-up sample. In general, the objective of\nthese analyses is to demonstrate that the drop-outs have characteristics that are broadly representative\nof the baseline sample; that is, attrition does not result in a sample that is biased toward a positive\nresult for the advertising covariate [83,104]. As discussed above, attrition in the follow-up sample is\nonly part of the problem as baseline refusals also are relevant. Most analyses are rather descriptive or\nincomplete. For example, Hanewinkel et al. [81] simply report that sample attrition is higher for\nyounger participants, males, sensation-seekers, having parents who drink less frequently, less movie\nexposure, and other variables. They fail to provide more details regarding the causes or effects of\nattrition. A few studies report results from a multivariate analysis. For drinking studies,\nSargent et al. [88] report that attrition is significantly associated with parental education, school\nperformance, smoking status, and rebelliousness, but the overall explanatory power of the regression is\npoor. This may be due to randomness among drop-outs or to unobserved characteristics in the study.\nStacy et al. [90] report the construction of a risk-based propensity score for drop-outs, but many\ndetails are omitted. For smoking studies, Sargent et al. [118] report results from an experiment with\ndifferent levels of predicted smoking uptake for the 122 drop-outs in their sample. They conclude that\ntheir results are not sensitive to increased smoking propensity or higher advertising receptivity among\ndrop-outs. Titus-Ernstoff et al. [124] report the results of a logistic regression for drop-out status\nconditional on all other baseline covariates. Dropping out of the study is associated with\nrebelliousness, parental smoking, and lower parental education. Non-whites are somewhat more likely\nto drop-out, other things being equal. Overall, the results in some attrition analyses are suggestive of\nselection bias according to race, parental drinking, and parental smoking, but these analyses do not\ninclude baseline refusals.\n6. Discussion and Alternative Research Designs\nA critical assessment of longitudinal studies of youth drinking and smoking reveals a number of\nshortcomings and omissions in the study methodologies. These problems mean that the studies do not\ndemonstrate causality between advertising-marketing exposure and youth drinking and smoking\nbehaviors. First, specification errors arise when an empirical model omits a relevant covariate or\nexplanatory variable. Many model specifications are ad hoc and not guided by a well-defined\ntheoretical model. Greater use of classifications for the explanatory variables would help, but virtually\nall studies omit market-area variables such as product prices and regulations. A simple approach is the\ninclusion of fixed-effects binary indicator variables, but this may not help if there is interest in the\neffect of specific regulations. Some econometric studies reviewed below have included policy indexes\nas an alternative to indicator variables. Formal methods for model selection are available, such as\nHendry`s general-to-specific procedure [69,96]. Sensitivity analysis is required to test the robustness of\nempirical results, with particular attention to the range of results for the advertising and marketing\nvariables. Of special importance is the lack of attention to models with several advertising and\nmarketing variables. Rather than test a general model, investigators have reported separate regressions\nfor individual marketing variables, either in the same paper or in separate papers using the same data.\nThis biases the results and overstates any possible effect of advertising on the outcomes.\nSecond, measurement errors are associated with current use of advertising receptivity and exposure\nvariables, which creates a bias due to endogeneity. In order to have policy relevance,\nreceptivity-exposure measures should be related in some fashion to actual advertising campaigns or\npublic policies affecting advertising and marketing. Most measures are not demonstrated in any\nmanner to have policy implications, other than the broad policy of total bans of alcohol and tobacco\nadvertising and promotion. Receptivity measures are rather broad and amorphous, and focused on\nbrand identification (favorite ad, brand recall, branded merchandise). Brand loyalty is not the same as a\ncausal effect of advertising on behaviors, but numerous studies draw this connection based on\nreceptivity and other brand-related variables. As noted by Heckman [73], this confuses personal\npreferences with advertising exposure. The results are especially fragile for moderate and low levels of\nreceptivity, but this raises an issue of measurement error or possibly omitted or mediating variables.\nModerating effects of advertising also deserve greater attention than it has received, with reporting of\nfull empirical results and standard errors. Given the results assembled to date, there is no clear\nevidence of a positive effect of advertising and marketing on alcohol and tobacco outcomes. The\nresults are particularly fragile for mass-media variables, but even the results for alcohol-branded items\n(ABIs), cigarette-branded items (CBIs), and movie-exposure contain inconsistent results. Overall, only\n21 of 63 estimates (33%) for drinking behaviors are statistically significant in Table 3. For smoking\nbehaviors, only 31 of 63 estimates (49%) are statistically significant in Table 4. Many of the significant\ncoefficients are for movie-exposure where model misspecification is an important issue. Results for\nmovie-exposure must be regarded as tentative until more complete models with several advertising\ncovariates are reported.\nThird, the theoretical models that underlie longitudinal studies do not admit the possibility that\nadvertising receptivity and exposure are determined endogenously. The result is a biased set of\nestimates that offer little in the way of causal relationships. Ownership of an ABI or CBI is a\nbehavioral choice in the same manner as a youth chooses (or refuses) to drink or smoke. Hence, models\nof adolescent behaviors must entertain the possibility of a multicausal model, wherein the choice\nbehaviors affecting advertising receptivity and exposure are modeled as well as the choice behavior for\nthe outcome in question. Instead, longitudinal studies adopt a simple research design in which the\nadvertising variable represents an exogenous treatment and the relationship being measured is akin\nto a dose-response relationship. The point here is that advertising receptivity and exposure are not\nrandomly assigned across survey participants, but rather are the outcomes of choice behavior by the\nparticipants. The evidence reviewed from several studies is entirely consistent with a non-random\nassignment. In order to be useful for alcohol and tobacco policy, longitudinal studies must consider the\nuse of instrumental variables in order to control for or rule out underlying preferences as the cause of\nalcohol and tobacco behaviors. As noted by Heckman et al. [132], longitudinal studies do not\naccurately model human behavior, as these studies ignore how human choice affects the measurement\nof both treatment` and outcome . . . [and] not addressing the potential role individual choices have in\nshaping the choice or acceptance of a tobacco item or other receptivity measures, which are taken to be\nsurrogates for advertising in many public health areas, makes cited results unreliable (p43).\nFourth, although longitudinal studies go to great lengths to ensure random samples of participants,\nthe studies are deficient in attending to issues of sample selection bias, especially bias introduced at the\ntime of the initial or baseline survey. Participation in the survey is a choice-outcome by adolescents\n(and their parents), which under the right circumstances can be observed and modeled. The procedures\nused presently to check on attrition bias are too simple and inadequate to deal with the task of detecting\nand controlling for self selection. The review in this paper noted three pieces of information that are at\nleast suggestive of selection bias. First, an examination by Geweke and Martin [131] of the raw CTS\ndata used in [114] shows that there is substantial non-response at baseline as well as attrition in the\nfollow-up sample. Possible reassignments of refusals in this study render void the conclusions. Second,\na number of studies offer results for subsamples, which might reveal important differences among\nparticipants that could bias the results or have important policy implications. Results for advertising\nand receptivity variables are in some instances quite sensitive to modeling of the subpopulation, which\nis a less formal method for detecting selection bias [138,139]. Third, many longitudinal studies report\ninformation on attrition during the follow-up sample, which is generally low and aided in part by the\nshort-duration from baseline to follow-up. This poses a dilemma for survey studies because choosing a\nshort duration can restrict the outcome to a group of more receptive individuals who may smoke or\ndrink for reasons that pre-date the baseline survey. Choosing a longer duration leads to greater attrition\nfrom the baseline sample. For example, in the four-year study by Audrain-McGovern et al. [126], the\ninitial population of 9th graders in five northern Virginia high schools was 2,382, but the baseline\nsample was only 1,123 students (47%) due to refusals and nonresponses. It is unclear in many\nlongitudinal studies whether attrition of this magnitude occurs (or matters) since the focus is usually on\nonly the follow-up sample.\nGiven the important limitations of longitudinal studies, it is useful to consider alternative\neconometric methodologies for determining the effects of advertising and advertising regulation.\nTable 5 presents a selected group of nine alcohol studies and nine tobacco studies. The study lists are\nnot comprehensive, but rather are chosen to illustrate several important analytical points regarding\nestimation and policy-related results. First, it is possible to model advertising expenditures or public\npolicies that affect advertising such that the empirical results have policy implications. The studies in\nTable 5 include examinations of advertising expenditures, partial advertising bans, and comprehensive\nbans. Many of the studies illustrate quasi-experimental designs. Second, the studies demonstrate the\nimportant role that product prices have for outcomes. The strength of longitudinal studies is that they\nfocus modeling efforts on a subpopulation of interest, namely adolescents. A major weakness of\nlongitudinal studies is that they do not model advertising in a useful manner or account for market\nvariables such as product prices. The studies in Table 5 include four time-series studies for Australia,\nstudies [145,149] report some positive results, the effects of advertising in these studies are modest or\ninconsistent across subpopulations [51]. In some cases, regulations have a short-run effect that\ndissipates with time [140,150] or there are cross-product compensating effects [143]. These important\nmodeling considerations are omitted from longitudinal studies.\nThere are several conclusions to be drawn from Table 5. First, there is no evidence that\nhigher-frequency data are important. A study using monthly advertising expenditure data fails to reveal\nan effect of advertising on alcohol consumption [141]. This replicates the results obtained in numerous\nother studies using annual and quarterly data [39,40]. Second, both partial and complete bans of\nadvertising are ineffective in reducing alcohol or tobacco use for adult and youth populations. In\nPaschall et al. [144], a composite alcohol advertising control rating is not statistically significant at\nstandard confidence levels and hence does not affect alcohol use by youth in 26 developed countries. In\nHublet et al. [148], bans of advertising do not have a significant effect on smoking behaviors of youth\nin 29 developed countries. In Nelson [152], partial and complete bans of advertising do not have an\neffect on youth smoking in 42 developing countries. Similar results are found in other alcohol and\ntobacco studies for partial bans (billboards, window displays, campus bulletin boards, distilled spirits\nadvertising), more complete bans (bans of broadcast advertising, bans of all media), and other\nregulations (warning labels). Third, product price is an important variable that significantly affects\ndrinking and smoking outcomes. All of the econometric studies in Table 5 that include prices find\nsignificant price elasticities for alcohol and tobacco, including youth behaviors. This variable is\noverlooked in social learning theory and omitted in longitudinal studies. Finally, the cumulative\nevidence in two meta-analyses [51,153] does not support the use of advertising bans as a means to\nreduce alcohol or tobacco consumption. As noted, this finding applies to youth as well adults. The\nsummary of findings in Table 5 supports other reviews of advertising for alcohol [39,40] and\ntobacco [154,155], which also conclude that advertising bans are ineffective.\nTable 5.

Conclusions and Policy Implications\nLongitudinal studies use a quasi-experimental research design, which implies non-randomness in\nthe assignment of treatment and comparison groups. This design requires attention to a number of\nstatistical and econometric problems [64]. Overall, the results in the present review fail to agree with\nimportant issues regarding both internal and external validity threats to research conclusions, which are\nlargely ignored by longitudinal researchers and public health reviewers. This review has offered a\nnumber of suggestions for improving the research methods used by longitudinal investigators. First,\nattention needs to be paid to selecting sets of covariates that provide an adequate test of the underlying\ntheory, including market-wide variables. Second, several methods of advertising and promotion should\nbe investigated using the same sample. Many studies investigate only one measure, such as branded\nmerchandise or movie portrayals. Third, exposure to advertising and marketing needs to be treated as\nendogenous variables involving choices on the part of youthful respondents. Given a nonrandom\nassignment of advertising among respondents, the instrumental variable technique should be\nconsidered as a means of handling this problem. Fourth, selection bias is an issue in longitudinal\nstudies since participation is a personal choice on the part of youth and their parents. Failure to deal\nadequately with this problem results in a nonrandom sample and biased empirical results. Overall, here\nare many areas where improvements are needed and much work to be done if longitudinal studies are\nto serve as a bias for public policy.\nAdvertising of alcohol and tobacco is a major preoccupation of regulators in most developed\ncountries. This stems from social costs associated with the use of these products and concern for the\nhealth and welfare of adolescents. Youth who engage in risky behaviors may not experience immediate\nadverse effects of drinking and smoking, but the choices they face as adults may be adversely restricted\nby past adolescent behaviors and outcomes. This creates concerns by public officials and advocacy\ngroups regarding persuasive advertisements for these products, and the information and images\ncontained in the ads or other promotions. However, it is important to remember that advertising\nregulation is but one of a large number of public policies that can affect alcohol or tobacco use,\nincluding controls on purchase age, possession, physical availability, product strength, warning labels,\nserver training, education programs, taxation, and advertising content codes. Simultaneous\nconsideration of a menu of policies should be used to select those tools that are most effective or can\nbe implemented at a low social cost. Given a policy menu, the important lessons from this review are\nthat, first, studies using longitudinal surveys have not established that advertising is a causal factor for\nyouth drinking and smoking and, second, these studies cannot be used to support recommendations for\nadvertising and marketing bans. My analysis and conclusions support several previous surveys that\nexamine a menu of public policies available for alcohol regulation [156,157] and tobacco\nregulation [158,159], and which reach a similar conclusion regarding the relative importance of\nadvertising. In conclusion, it would be useful to refocus longitudinal studies on other policy variables\nthat importantly affect youth alcohol and tobacco behaviors.\n"
