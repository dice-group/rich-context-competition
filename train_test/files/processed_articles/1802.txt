Perception of weight status was assessed by asking participants to classify\ntheir weight as about the right weight, underweight or overweight. Comparisons were made across\nage groups, genders, race/ethnicities and various income levels.\nResults: Fewer overweight people during the NHANES 1999\u00ad2004 survey perceived themselves\nas overweight when compared to overweight people during the NHANES III survey. The change\nin distortion between the survey periods was greatest among persons with lower income, males\nand African-Americans.\nConclusion: The increase in overweight/obesity between the survey years (NHANES III and\nNHANES 1999\u00ad2004 has been accompanied with fewer overweight people perceiving themselves\nas overweight.\nBackground\nIn 2001, The Surgeon General's Call to Action to Prevent and\nDecrease Overweight and Obesity was issued in response to\nthe increasing population prevalence of overweight and\nobesity and the resulting public health threat [1]. At the\ntime of this report, the prevalence of overweight (BMI 25\namong adults was 34% and 30.5%, respectively, based on\ndata from the National Health and Nutrition Examination\nincrease from the 32% who were overweight and 22.5%\nwho were obese during the NHANES III survey period\nweight/obesity prevalence data from NHANES in 2003\u00ad\nThis article is available from: http://www.ijbnpa.org/content/5/1/9\n\u00a9 2008 Johnson-Taylor et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.\nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0),\nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nInternational Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity 2008, 5:9 http://www.ijbnpa.org/content/5/1/9\n(page number not for citation purposes)\noverweight and 32% were obese [2]. Clearly we are mov-\ning in the wrong direction. Though a number of different\nfactors have been attributed to this occurrence, including\nfewer opportunities to be physically active and increased\naccessibility of food [1]; this study attempts to explore the\npotential contribution of alterations in self-perception of\nweight. For the purposes of this study, distorted weight\nperception occurs when one perceives his/her weight to be\nin a different category (underweight, overweight, just\nright) than would be determined when making a compar-\nison to the NIH Clinical Guidelines on the Identification,\nEvaluation and Treatment of Overweight and Obesity in\nAdults \u00ad The Evidence Report [4].\nDistorted weight perception is not a new phenomenon\nand is actually very well documented [5-16]. Studies in\nthis area have consistently found that women (regardless\nof weight status category) are more likely to perceive\nthemselves as overweight when compared to overweight\nmen. Emslie et al found that among British bank and uni-\nversity workers, overweight women were more likely to\nperceive themselves as overweight than men [15]. This is\nalso clearly illustrated in a study by Inoue et colleagues\nwhere they compared the agreement between measured\nBMI and perceived weight status. They found that 55.3%\nof normal weight women perceived themselves as over-\nCaucasians are more likely to perceive themselves as over-\nweight when compared to African Americans and Mexican\nAmericans. Overweight people of higher socioeconomic\nstatus (SES) are more likely to perceive themselves over-\nweight when compared to those of lower SES. Individuals\nwith BMIs greater than 30 are more likely to perceive\nthemselves overweight when compared to those with\nappears to hold true across all races and genders.\nBMI Category\nPercent of Total\nInternational Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity 2008, 5:9 http://www.ijbnpa.org/content/5/1/9\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nThe overweight public's failure to accurately recognize\ntheir own overweight status prior to becoming obese may\nprevent them from changing behaviors that might con-\ntribute to additional weight gain. Therefore, it is impor-\ntant to understand the magnitude of weight status\ndistortion within persons with BMI scores within the over-\nweight range.\nThe intent of the present study was to determine if there is\na trend for more individuals observed in the \"overweight\"\nBMI range to perceive themselves to be of \"normal\" or\nwhether income, race and gender moderated this effect.\nMethods\nprobability sample of non-institutionalized U.S. civilians,\nages 2 months and older. The survey is conducted by the\nNational Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention (CDC) and includes\nadministration of questionnaires, a physical exam, and a\nbattery of laboratory tests. Details of the questionnaires,\nthe exam, and the tests have been described elsewhere\nAnalytic Sample\nAdult participants ( 20 years of age) classified as over-\n4,645), were included in our sample. Respondents were\nexcluded if they were pregnant or under the age of 20\n(children/adolescents). Pregnancy status was determined\nusing self-reported information as well as results of the\nurine test administered during the medical examination.\nMeasures\nHeight and weight were measured by trained examiners\nduring the extensive medical evaluation at the Mobile\nExamination Center (MEC). Participants were weighed\nusing a scale with a digital display readout, and height was\nmeasured using a stadiometer.\nBody Mass Index (BMI) was calculated based on these\nweight and height measurements and calculated as weight\n(kg)/height (meters) squared. Participants were then clas-\nsistent with the NIH Clinical Guidelines on the Identifica-\ntion, Evaluation and Treatment of Overweight and\nObesity in Adults \u00ad The Evidence Report [4].\nWeight perception was ascertained asking subjects during\nthe face-to-face interview if they considered themselves to\nbe overweight, underweight, or about the right weight.\nLess than 0.01% of respondents were missing weight sta-\ntus data, and these individuals were excluded from analy-\nses examining weight distortion. At the time respondents\nwere asked to report their weight status, they were also\ntold that their weight would be measured at a follow-up\nsession.\nPoverty Income Ratio\nRespondents were asked to select the category of income\nthat most accurately reflected their total combined family\nincome over the last 12 months. Reported income was\nthen used to develop the poverty income ratio (PIR),\nwhich is the ratio of income to the family's appropriate\npoverty threshold. Using the PIR allows income data to be\ncompared across various survey years. Income was catego-\nrized, as suggested by NCHS, using the PIR eligibility cut\npoints for the United States Department of Agriculture\n(USDA) food assistance programs, into the following cat-\ndata were excluded from all income analyses. This\nincluded 9.7% (551) overweight adults from NHANES III\nAge\nNon-age specific estimates were age-standardized to the\n2000 Census using the standard population structure as\nsuggested by NCHS. For specific estimates examining age,\nand 65+. These categories enable exploration of how\nweight perception differs across the age spectrum while\nproviding a sufficient number of subjects in each group.\nRace/Ethnicity\nNHANES participants during both survey periods were\nasked to select the race and ethnicity that they most read-\nily identified with. Responses were then systematically\ncollapsed into the following categories of Non-Hispanic\n(NH) Whites, Non-Hispanic (NH) Blacks, Mexican-Amer-\nicans and Other [21,22]. Only the first three categories are\nreported on in this paper.\nStatistical Analysis\nAnalysis of the NHANES data was conducted using SAS\n(version 9, SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) and SUDAAN\n(version 9, Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle\nPark, NC) statistical software packages. To account for\nunequal probabilities of selection and non-response, all\nour analyses incorporated sample weights in order to pro-\nvide national estimates of population proportions. Stand-\nard errors were calculated in SUDAAN based on the Taylor\nSeries Linearization method [23]. Analyses were con-\nducted separately for each survey period (NHANES III\nInternational Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity 2008, 5:9 http://www.ijbnpa.org/content/5/1/9\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nlation was stratified by gender, race, age and income. T-\ntests were used to assess differences between each of the\nindividual groups and the reference population, which\nwas defined as white males or white females, ages 20\u00ad34\nor a PIR of 0\u00ad1.85. T-tests were also used to test differ-\nences in proportions between the two survey periods. A p-\nvalue < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nResults\nSixty-two percent of measured overweight (BMI  25 kg/\nidentified themselves as overweight when asked whether\nthey considered themselves underweight, overweight or\njust the right weight compared to 68% who were asked the\nveys, the percentage of overweight females who accurately\nidentified their weight status as overweight was greater\nthan the percentage of overweight males who accurately\nidentified themselves as overweight. This was consistent\nacross all racial/ethnic and age groups. However, those in\nthe youngest age group (ages 20\u00ad34) in both genders\nexperienced statistically significantly more alteration in\nperception of weight status than the older groups between\nthe survey years with 13% fewer males and females ages\n20\u00ad34 accurately identifying themselves as overweight in\nAmong both genders, Non-Hispanic blacks were least\nlikely to perceive themselves as overweight during the\nblack males considered themselves to be overweight in\nmales. Among females for the same survey period\nrate perception of their weight status whereas 82.1% of\nNH white females had an accurate perception. This repre-\nshows that fewer Non-Hispanic Blacks (males and\nfemales), fewer Non-Hispanic Whites (males and\nfemales) and fewer Mexican American males accurately\nperceive their weight status in the latter survey. It is also\nimportant to note that the weight perception of Mexican\nAmericans of both genders and white males did not\nchange significantly over the survey years. In addition\namong all ethnic groups, NH blacks experienced the great-\nest change in weight status perception between the survey\nperiods. See Table 1.\nAs PIR increased, the trend was for more people to cor-\nrectly perceive themselves as overweight. This trend was\nconsistent across all racial ethnic groups. However, whites\nwith lower and middle PIR and blacks with lower PIR real-\nized the greatest growth in distortion between surveys\nwith 8%, 9% and 18% (respectively) fewer persons accu-\nrately identifying themselves as overweight (p < 0.05).\nMexican Americans with lower PIR were more likely than\ntheir NH black counterparts and less likely than NH\nwhites of the same income level to perceive themselves\noverweight. However, there was an insignificant differ-\nence across survey years for the low income Mexican\nAmericans.

In order to gain a better under-\nstanding of the degree of distortion along the BMI contin-\nuum, an ad hoc analysis was conducted to examine the\nshift in weight perception among males and females with\nwas a statistically significant decrease in the number of\noverweight adults with an accurate weight perception\n< 001 respectively). While individuals in the higher BMI\ncategory (BMI 27.5\u00ad<30) experienced a decrease in accu-\nrate weight perception, this difference was not statistically\nsignificant. Among the individuals with a BMI greater\nthan 30, there was no change in perception across survey\nperiods. The majority of males and females with a BMI\nabove 30 are aware that they are overweight (87.0% and\n95.5% respectively). The shift at lower BMI levels suggests\nthe perception of a healthy weight is expanding to include\nthose who are mildly overweight.\nThe findings of our study are consistent with those found\nacknowledge that there is a weight problem in this coun-\ntry and 7 in 10 acknowledge that their family and friends\nhave a problem, yet only 4 in 10 say they themselves are\noverweight. Within the same survey 51% of respondents\nwhose reports of their own height and weight would\nresult in them being classified as overweight perceived\nthemselves to be just right [24]. The findings suggest that\nwhile people seemingly understand the concept of over-\nweight, the slide rule by which they conceptually estimate\ntheir own weight status is skewed. This observation may\ncontribute to the continued increase in prevalence of\nobesity. More research is needed to help us understand\nnot only the reasons for the distorted perception but also\nthe potential impact.\nConclusion\nThe results of this study speak to the need to increase the\nawareness of the public's perception of weight status. As\nthe weight status perception becomes more distorted it\nlessens the likelihood that individuals will make the rec-\nommended behavioral changes necessary to realize the\nhealth benefits associated with even small weight loss.\nCompeting interests\nThe author(s) declare that they have no competing inter-\nests.\nAuthors' contributions\nWJT conceived of the study, participated in the design of\nthe study, the analysis, drafted the manuscript and incor-\nporated other author comments.
