(J Clin\nSEVERAL STUDIES HAVE linked obesity with poorer\nvitamin D status, as reflected by lower serum 25-\nhydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] values (1\u00ad9). Both obesity and\nlow serum 25(OH)D values are more common in African-\nAmerican women than in Caucasian women (10\u00ad12), but few\nstudies to date have examined the connection between these\ntwo variables by race. Results of these studies have con-\nflicted. For example, Epstein et al. (13) and Nesby-O'Dell et\nal. (12) reported no relationship between serum 25(OH)D\nlevels and obesity or body mass index (BMI) in blacks,\nwhereas Parikh et al. (9) found a significant negative correlation\nbetween BMI and serum 25(OH)D in African-Americans.\nThe present study uses data from 6402 adolescent and adult\nfemales, aged 12 yr and older, from the third National Health\nto examine the extent to which body fat differences between the\nraces contribute to serum 25(OH)D differences by race. In ad-\ndition, it assesses whether the relationship between body fat\nandserum25(OH)Dvariesbyraceinwomen,andifso,whether\nthis difference is constant across age. Addressing these issues\nis pertinent in light of the heightened interest in the poorer\nvitamin D status of African-Americans coupled with their sig-\nnificantly higher prevalence of obesity (10\u00ad12).\nSubjects and Methods\nSubjects\nfor Health Statistics, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n(Hyattsville, MD), to assess the health and nutrition status of a large\nrepresentative sample of the noninstitutionalized, civilian United\nStates population. Data were collected via household interviews, and\ndirect standardized physical examinations were conducted in spe-\ncially equipped mobile examination centers (14). NHANES III was\ndesigned to provide reliable estimates for three race/ethnic groups:\nnon-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, and Mexican-Americans.\nAll procedures were approved by the National Center for Health\nStatistics institutional review board, and written informed consent\nwas obtained from all subjects.\nuals, aged 12 yr and older, in NHANES III. In the present study the\npanic black females, aged 12 yr, with nonmissing data for serum\n25(OH)D and percent body fat (%BF). This sample represents 61% of\nnon-Hispanic white or black females in this age range who were orig-\ninally selected for the survey, 73% of those who were interviewed, and\n83% of those who received physical examinations in the survey.\nVariables\nSerum 25(OH)D levels were assayed with an RIA kit (DiaSorin, Still-\nwater, MN). Assays were performed at the primary environmental and\nnutritional health laboratory for NHANES at the National Center for\nEnvironmental Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n(Atlanta, GA). The assay was designed to detect serum 25(OH)D\nreassay. Sera from five measurements of bench quality control (QC)\nmaterials (e.g. identifiable to the analyst as a QC) and two levels of blind\nQC materials (e.g. not identifiable to the analyst) were tested on a regular\nbasis throughout the survey period. The bench control materials were\ndesigned to cover a wide range of serum 25(OH)D values: 5 ng/ml (12.5\nblind QC pools were used to address low (15 ng/ml or 37.5 nmol/liter)\nor elevated (50 ng/ml or 125 nmol/liter) levels. A total of 13 blind QC\npools aimed at low values and 11 aimed at high values were used during\nthe survey. Assay coefficients of variation for these blind QC pools were\nliter).

Details of the assay method for this measurement have been\npreviously reported (15).\nThe %BF was calculated using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA)\ndata. A single, tetrapolar BIA measurement of resistance (Res) and\nreactance at 50 kHz was taken between the right wrist and ankle while\nthe respondent was supine using a 1990B Bio-Resistance Body Compo-\nsition Analyzer (Valhalla Scientific, San Diego, CA). Total body water\nand fat-free mass (FFM) were calculated from Res measurements using\nprediction equations that have been validated and published for\nNHANES III previously (16). Because these equations were based on Res\ndata from RJL bioelectrical impedance analyzers (RJL, Clinton Town-\nship, MI), the NHANES III Res data had to be converted to RJL values\nbefore applying the equations, as described previously (16). Estimates\nof total body fat (TBF) and %BF were calculated as follows: TBF  FFM \nbody weight, and %BF  TBF/body weight. Body weight was measured\nto the nearest 0.01 kg using an electronic load cell scale (14).\nRace and ethnicity were self-reported by the participants. Several\nadditional variables were included in the study because previous studies\nsuggested that they were related to serum 25(OH)D (11, 12), and pre-\nliminary analyses indicated they were also related to body fat and race\nand thus might confound the results of the present analysis. These\nincluded the following variables. 1) The month of blood collection was\nbased on the date of the respondent's physical examination. 2) Physical\nactivity was based on self-reported times per month that the respondent\nperformed exercise that made him/her sweat for subjects aged 12\u00ad16 yr;\nfor subjects aged 17 yr and older, it was based on self-reported times per\nmonth of performing various activities (walking a mile or more without\nstopping, jogging or running, bicycling, swimming, aerobics or aerobic\ndancing, other dancing, calisthenics or exercise, gardening or yard work,\nweight lifting, or other exercises, sports, or physically active hobbies).\nAll activities for adults were included in the main analyses to be more\ncomparable with the physical activity item for adolescents, which could\nnot be separated into outdoor vs. indoor activities. Secondary analyses\nwere performed for adults using only those activities likely to be per-\nformed outdoors (walking, jogging, or running; bicycling; swimming;\nand gardening and yard work) to compare with results based on all\nactivities. 3) Dietary vitamin D intake from food was based on a single\n24-h recall. The University of Minnesota Nutrition Coordinating Center\nfood composition database was used for the vitamin D composition data\n(17, 18). 4) The frequency of milk consumption was based on self-\nreported times per month that the respondents drank milk or added it\nto cereal; cereal consumption was based on times per month that cold\ncereal was consumed. 5) Smoking was based on responses to question-\nnaire items asking whether the respondent had ever smoked at least 100\ncigarettes and, if so, whether he/she currently smoked. Responses to\nthese items were combined to identify current smoker or former smokers\nvs. never smokers. 6) Vitamin-mineral supplement use was based on a\nquestionnaire item that asked whether the respondents had taken any\nvitamin or mineral supplements in the past month. 7) Current oral\ncontraceptive or hormone therapy use were based on questionnaire\nitems that asked about the use of birth control pills or estrogen (pills,\ncream, suppository, injection, or patch).\nData analyses\nSample weights were used when calculating point estimates. The use\nof these weights provides estimates representative of the civilian, non-\ninstitutionalized U.S. population at the time of NHANES III; the weights\nalso account for oversampling and nonresponse in the survey. The\nanalyses were performed using SUDAAN (19), a family of statistical\nprocedures for analysis of data from complex sample surveys. Potential\nconfounding variables were identified using regression or 2 analyses.\nBecause responses to the physical activity variable were skewed, these\ndata were analyzed after performing a log transformation. Age-adjusted\nmeans of the various confounding variables were calculated and com-\npared between the two races using regression.\nRegression analysis was also used to assess the effect of adjusting for\nbody fat differences on racial differences in serum 25(OH)D values by\ncalculating mean serum 25(OH)D values by race before and after ad-\njusting for %BF. Age-adjusted mean serum 25(OH)D levels were also\ncompared by quartile of %BF in white vs. black women. Finally, regres-\nsion analyses were used to examine the relationship between serum\n25(OH)D and body fat separately by race and age before and after\nadjusting for the confounding variables.\nSeveral secondary analyses were also performed to address potential\nlimitations in the study. For example, because BIA only provides an\nindirect measure of %BF, the analyses described above were repeated\nusing BMI. Analyses were also repeated after restricting the sample to\nthose examined between November and March (when UV radiation\nlevels are low) as an additional way to address the unequal distribution\nof month of blood collection between blacks and whites (11). Analyses\nin which confounders were controlled were repeated for adults after\nrestricting the physical activity variable to only those activities that were\nmore likely to be performed outdoors, as a means of better assessing\npossible differences in sun exposure. To explore the serum 25(OH)D-\n%BF relationship by age in more depth, analyses were performed in\nFinally, physical activity levels were compared in obese individuals by\nrace and age to assess whether potential sun avoidance by obese indi-\nviduals varied by these factors.\nA secondary analysis was also conducted to assess the extent to which\ndifferences in the serum 25(OH)D-body fat relationship by race were\naffected by the smaller variation in serum 25(OH)D distribution ob-\nserved in black women. In this analysis, the relationship was examined\nin white women after restricting the sample to those with serum\nliter); these values correspond to the 1st and 99th percentiles of the serum\n25(OH)D distribution of the black women.\nResults\nSample sizes by age and age-adjusted means or preva-\nlences of selected confounding variables by race are shown\nin Table 1 for the study sample. Non-Hispanic black women\nwere younger and had more body fat than white women.\nThey had lower intakes of vitamin D from food, as assessed\nTABLE 1.

They were more\nlikely to be nonsmokers than white women, but less likely to\nperform physical activity or use vitamin-mineral supple-\nments or female hormones. Finally, they were more likely to\nhave had their blood collected during November-March; this\noccurred because NHANES collects data in the south during\nthe winter (because the mobile exam centers are not designed\nfor cold weather operation), and the majority of African\nfrom the U.S. Census Bureau (20)].\nTable 2 compares mean serum 25(OH)D values by race\nbefore and after adjusting for %BF. Mean serum 25(OH)D\nvalues were 1.4\u00ad1.9 times higher in white women than in\nblack women before adjusting for %BF. Adjusting for %BF\nreduced, but did not remove, the white/black difference;\nwhites. The lack of impact of %BF on racial differences in\nserum 25(OH)D is also evident by the consistent difference\nin age-adjusted mean serum 25(OH)D levels in white vs.\nblack women in the different %BF quartiles (Fig. 1). The ratio\nof white/black means was 1.7 in the first three quartiles and\n1.5 in the fourth, or highest, quartile of %BF.\nTo explore the basis for the lack of impact of body fat on\nracial differences in serum 25(OH)D, a regression of serum\n25(OH)D on %BF was performed separately by race after\nadjusting for age or for all confounders. Results are shown\nin Table 3. %BF was significantly related to serum 25(OH)D\nin white women regardless of age, but among black women,\nthe relationship was significant only among women less than\n50 yr of age. Furthermore, the  coefficients for the relation-\nship in white women were approximately 3\u00ad7 times larger\nthan those in black women, indicating that the strength of the\nrelationship is greater in whites than in blacks.\nThe strength of the relationship also varied by age within\nrace, as suggested by the smaller  coefficients for women\nages 50 yr relative to those for the younger women in both\nraces (Table 3). The lack of statistically reliable estimates for\nolder black women precluded firm conclusions about the age\nrelationship among blacks, but among white women,  co-\nefficients were approximately 2\u00ad3 times higher in those ages\n12\u00ad49 yr than in those over age 50 yr either before or after\nadjusting for other confounding variables. Additional explo-\nration of the relationship in older white women revealed a\ntendency for the relationship to continue to weaken with age,\nas suggested by the larger  coefficient for women ages\nResults of the secondary analyses of body fat and serum\n25(OH)D performed to address various potential study lim-\nitations (e.g. use BMI instead of %BF, restrict sample to winter\nonly, or restrict physical activity to likely outdoor activities)\nwere similar to those obtained in the main analyses (data not\nshown). In addition, the frequency of physical activity did\nnot differ in obese individuals by race or age (data not\nshown); this analysis was performed to assess whether sun\navoidance in obese subjects might vary by these factors.\nFinally, results of the analysis performed to assess whether\nthe smaller variation in serum 25(OH)D values among blacks\naccounted for its weaker relationship with body fat in this\ngroup suggested that this was not the case. Specifically, the\n coefficient for %BF remained noticeably higher for white\nafter restricting the sample to white women with serum\n25(OH)D values that fell between the 1st and 99th percentiles\nof the serum 25(OH)D distribution of the black women.\nDiscussion\nRecent concerns have been raised about the high preva-\nlence of low serum 25(OH)D values observed in African-\nAmericans (12). The lower values observed in African-Amer-\nicans have been attributed primarily to reduced synthesis of\nvitamin D in the skin due to greater skin pigmentation (21).\nAlthough differences in skin synthesis due to melanin un-\ndoubtedly play a major role in racial differences in serum\n25(OH)D, other factors may also contribute. Obesity is of\nparticular interest, given its link to lower serum 25(OH)D\nvalues and the fact that the prevalence of obesity is signif-\nicantly higher in African-American women than in white\nwomen (10). However, to date, few studies have examined\nwhether obesity is linked to the lower serum 25(OH)D levels\nin African-Americans, and these have produced conflicting\nThe present study found that adjusting for body fat dif-\nferences did not noticeably reduce the differences in serum\n25(OH)D levels between white and black women in any of\nthe age groups examined. Subsequent analyses of the rela-\ntionship between serum 25(OH)D and %BF within race/\nethnic groups highlighted a likely explanation for this lack of\nTABLE 2.

In\nspecific, the relationship is stronger in whites than in blacks\nat all ages. In addition, there is divergence by age within race;\nwe found a significant, although weak, relationship among\nyounger black women, but no relationship among older\nblack women. The divergence in strength by age was also\nobserved in white women, although the relationship re-\nmained statistically significant in older white women, aged\nThe reason for the weaker relationship between body fat\nand serum 25 (OH)D in blacks is not clear. Wortsman et al.\n(7) recently proposed that the lower serum 25(OH)D levels\nseen among obese whites was the result of increased seques-\ntration of vitamin D in fat tissue. Whether this applies to\nblacks is uncertain. On the one hand, differences in fat me-\ntabolism observed by race [enhanced lipogenesis and re-\nduced lipolysis in blacks (22\u00ad24)] seem more consistent with\nblacks having a greater ability to sequester vitamin D than\nwhites, which should lead to a stronger body fat-vitamin D\nrelationship in blacks. On the other hand, blacks have re-\nduced synthesis of vitamin D in the skin due to the presence\nof more melanin, which absorbs the UV radiation needed for\nthe skin synthesis to occur (21). Skin synthesis of vitamin D\nhas been estimated to account for the majority of vitamin D\nin the human body (25). Thus, it is possible that body fat has\na lower impact in blacks because there is less vitamin D\nformed in the skin to sequester.\nOther mechanisms proposed to explain the link between\nobesity and serum 25(OH)D in whites include greater avoid-\nance of the sun by obese persons (3), and negative feedback\ncontrol on hepatic synthesis of serum 25(OH)D due to higher\nD] in the\nobese (1). Sun avoidance could play a role in the differences\nin the body fat-serum 25(OH)D relationship by race if, for ex-\nample, obese blacks were more likely to avoid the sun than\nobese whites. However, in the present study, self-reported\nphysical activity levels did not differ significantly between\nobese whites and blacks, which is not consistent with that pos-\nD was not measured in NHANES III,\nso its potential role in differences in the body fat-serum\n25(OH)D relationship by race could not be evaluated in the\npresent study. However, there are data to suggest racial dif-\nferences occur in the relationship between serum 1,25(OH)2\nD\nand obesity. Epstein et al. (13) reported that serum 1,25(OH)2\nD\nvalues did not differ by obesity status in blacks, which suggests\nD on hepatic synthesis of\nserum 25(OH)D might be affected less by obesity status in\nblacks than in whites. However, their study sample was small\n(12 nonobese and 10 obese blacks) and may have lacked the\nstatistical power needed to detect a difference.\nIn the present study, the serum 25(OH)D-body fat rela-\ntionship was also weaker in older individuals relative to\nyounger subjects of the same race. The mechanisms outlined\nabove for the racial difference in this relationship may also\napply to the age-related difference. For example, older in-\ndividuals have a reduced ability to synthesize vitamin D in\nthe skin (26), which could result in less vitamin D available\nto sequester. Another possibility, e.g. differences in sun\navoidance in older vs. younger obese persons, does not ap-\npear to explain the findings in the present study, because\nself-reported physical activity levels did not differ signifi-\ncantly between obese younger vs. older persons when ana-\nlyzed in broad age groups among whites. Whether differ-\nD levels by age play a role is harder\nto assess, given the complex age patterns displayed by this\nvariable; levels appear to increase up until age 65 yr, then\ndecline (27). The present study could not directly examine the\nD, but the serum 25(OH)D-%BF relation-\nship was noticeably weaker in white women aged 65 yr [in\nD values are presumably lower] than\nin white women aged 50\u00ad64 yr, which is not consistent with\nD levels explaining age differences in\nthis relationship. More work is clearly needed to better un-\nderstand the mechanisms underlying the differences in the\nrelationship between body fat and serum 25(OH)D by age as\nwell as by race.\nThe present study has several limitations, including the\nuse of %BF estimates based on BIA. BIA does not directly\nmeasure body fat; instead, it measures total body water, from\nwhich FFM and fat mass are subsequently derived using\nprediction equations. An NIH panel concluded that BIA was\nuseful for body composition analysis in most individuals\nTABLE 3.

An extensive study was undertaken to\ndevelop and evaluate prediction equations for the BIA data\ncollected in NHANES III; this multicenter study used a mul-\nticompartment model to assess body composition in more\nthan 1800 individuals (16). The evaluation indicated that the\nequations have excellent precision overall, but they did not\nperform as well in blacks as in whites (16). In specific, total\nbody water and FFM were underpredicted in blacks; this\nsystematic difference could affect comparisons between\nraces (29). Two approaches were used to address the poten-\ntial impact of this difference: 1) the relationship between %BF\nand serum 25(OH)D values was examined separately within\neach racial group as part of the main analyses in the present\nstudy, because, according to Chumlea et al. (29), the NHANES\nIII body composition estimates from BIA are probably adequate\nfor comparisons within racial groups; and 2) the relationship\nbetween body fat and serum 25(OH)D was assessed in sec-\nondary analyses using BMI rather than %BF. Results from both\nsets of analyses supported the finding of a reduced relationship\nbetween body fat and serum 25(OH)D in blacks.\nOther limitations include differences in the season during\nwhich blood was collected by race, with more blacks having\nblood collected in the winter. However, we controlled for\nmonth of blood collection in all main analyses, and the results\nof the secondary analysis in which the sample was restricted\nto those with blood collected in winter were similar to the\nmain analyses as well. NHANES III also lacks data on sun\nD. Physical activity level was\nused as a proxy for sun exposure in the present study, but\nit is only an approximation in light of the inability to define\noutdoor activities with certainty and the fact that sun expo-\nsure during nonleisure physical activity is not assessed.\nThere is also potential for nonresponse bias in the sample,\nbecause not all of those who were selected to participate in\nthe survey did so. Nonresponse bias in the sample that came\nto the mobile exam centers in NHANES III is reduced to some\nextent by a nonresponse adjustment factor included in the\ncalculation of the sample weights (30). After applying these\nweighting adjustments, differences between examinees and\nnonexaminees were minor (30). However, about 17% of the\neligible women who came to the mobile exam centers did not\nhave usable serum 25(OH)D data, and this nonresponse is\nnot addressed by the sample weight adjustments.\nIn conclusion, the relationship between body fat and se-\nrum 25(OH)D in women is complex; it is weaker in blacks\nthan in whites, and within race, it is weaker in older than in\nyounger subjects. Thus, it appears to depend on both race\nand age. The weaker relationship in African-Americans\nprobably explains why the higher body fat levels in black\nwomen did not appear to play a major role in explaining their\nlower serum 25(OH)D values relative to those in white\nwomen. More work is needed to identify the mechanisms\nthat underlie these variations in the relationship between\nbody fat and vitamin D status.\n"
