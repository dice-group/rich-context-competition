This article describes strategies reported in six\nfocus group discussions with Community Advisory Board members, educators, and consent counselors at an active HIV\nvaccine trial site in South Africa. Thematic analysis identified a considerable range of strategies, and findings suggest that\nsuch staff do not only try to promote understanding of critical information but also try to build trust in communicated\ninformation, to respect cultural differences, and to promote voluntariness. Findings also suggest occasional tensions\nbetween these implicit goals. Actual engagement and consent encounters at HIV vaccine trial sites should be observed,\nrecorded, and analyzed; and the relationship between practices and valued outcomes should be assessed. These efforts\nmay help to make consent-related encounters as \"potent\" as possible given finite resources.\n",

Ethical\u00adlegal frameworks stipulate a long\nmenu of concepts that must be understood, for example, the\nguidelines from Council for International Organizations of\nelements. Prior research has shown many deficiencies in\nparticipants' understanding across many research settings\n(Mandava, Pace, Campbell, Emanuel, & Grady, 2012), and\nsome commentators have argued that consent is \"widely\nhas been recommended that consent efforts be strengthened\nwith adult education and communication principles (Meade,\nthat consent interactions be observed and analyzed using\nspecialized observational frameworks (Gross-Cohn, Jia,\nChapman Smith, Erwin, & Larson, 2011; Tomamichel, Sessa,\nHerzig, de Jong, Pagani, & Cavalli, 1995). Commentators\nhave asserted that critical consent outcomes, such as under-\nstanding, are best understood as a function of the interaction\nbetween individual characteristics (e.g., educational attain-\nment, literacy, familiarity with research) and the consent\ncontext, including the skills and strategies of communicators\n(cf. Fisher, 2010). Faden and Beauchamp drily observed in\n1986 that \"disclosure is the lawyer's entre to the world of\ninformed consent, but it is a back-fence gate to that world,\nand a narrow one at that\" (p. 307) arguing instead for the\ncentrality of \"effective communication\" (p. 307).\n1HIV AIDS Vaccines Ethics Group, University of KwaZulu-Natal,\nPietermaritzburg South Africa\n2South African Research Ethics Training Initiative (SARETI), University of\nKwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, South Africa\n3University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada\n4University of Cape Town, South Africa\nCorresponding Author:\nCatherine Slack, HIV/AIDS Vaccines Ethics Group (HAVEG), School of\nApplied Human Sciences, College of Humanities, University of KwaZulu-\nNatal, Corner Ridge and Golf Rd., SCOTTSVILLE, Pietermaritzburg\nEmail: slackca@ukzn.ac.za\n\". . .

However, commentators\nin this field also increasingly argue for attention to the pro-\ncesses by which these complex concepts are communicated\n(Koblin et al., 2010; Ndebele, Wassenaar, Masiye, &\nMunula-Nkandu, 2014; Rautenbach, Lindegger, Slack,\nYet, there is very little published work evaluating commu-\nnication during consent interactions in HIV vaccine trials\n(Watermeyer & Penn, 2008). This article explores the strat-\negies and practices being used by key vaccine stakeholders\nat an HIV vaccine trial site in South Africa to communicate\ncomplex research concepts to prospective participants in\nconsent and engagement encounters in HIV vaccine trials,\nand the attendant challenges.\nAims and Method\nOur overall study aimed to explore--with critical site con-\nstituencies--the representations of key research concepts in\nHIV vaccine trials, and strategies used to communicate con-\ncepts for such trials, and to consider the implications for\nconsent processes. The overall study was approved by all\nResearch Ethics Committees affiliated to the research team,\nthe site, and the funders [University of KwaZulu-Natal\nHumanities and Social Sciences Research Ethics Committee\nof key concepts were presented in an earlier article\n(Rautenbach et al., 2015). The present article describes\nresults regarding the strategies reportedly being used to\ncommunicate complex research concepts to prospective\nparticipants in consent and engagement encounters in HIV\nvaccine trials and complexities.\nOngoing outreach to the site underscored that there\nwere various encounters in which research concepts are\ncommunicated. First, there were sessions in the commu-\nnity where Community Advisory Board (CAB) members\nand educators interact with participating community\nmembers about the site and research more generally.\nSecond, there were group-discussion sessions at the site\nwhere educators interact with community members inter-\nested in research. Third, there were group-based consent-\ndiscussion groups, and individual sessions, at the site\nwhere consent counselors interact with potential partici-\npants about enrollment into specific trials. Representatives\nfrom these three site-related constituencies (namely, CAB\nmembers, educators, and consent counselors) took part in\nfocus group discussions (FGDs) because all were well\nplaced to shed light on how information is communicated\nabout HIV vaccine trials. Specifically, we conducted two\nFGDs with 10 CAB members each (i.e., 20 CAB-enrollees)\nlate in 2013. Then we conducted one FGD with eight edu-\ncators also late in 2013 (i.e., eight educator-enrollees).\nSubsequently, we conducted three FGDs with consent\ncounselors of seven, six, and eight members, respectively\n(comprising 10 counselor-enrollees because several con-\nsent counselors participated in more than one FGD).\nConsent counselor FGDs were conducted in early 2014,\ndepended on availability and interest, and we did not pre-\nclude any interested person from participation--given that\nour objective was in-depth exploration through an itera-\ntive process characteristic of qualitative research, rather\nthan to achieve generalizability.\nDuring FGDs, representatives from each of the three\nconstituencies were asked to discuss key concepts, how key\nconcepts are explained (including the use of analogies), and\nchallenges or difficulties they experienced. Semistructured\nschedules with probes guided the FGDs (cf. Kvale, 1996).\nAlso, facilitators and FGD-participants role-played the\nexplanation of concepts to \"mock\" participating commu-\nnity members or \"mock\" potential participants and, subse-\nquently, FGD-participants were invited to reflect on these\nrole-plays to stimulate discussion about the concepts, how\nthey are communicated, and challenges (cf. Rautenbach\net al., 2015). All FGDs explored similar domains, but ques-\ntions and prompts were tailored to the activities and roles of\ndifferent trial constituencies.\nFGDs were conducted between August 2013 and\nFebruary 2016, as set out above. The data set consisted of\nsix transcribed FGDs. Text was coded for practices using a\ndeductive and inductive approach to thematic analysis,\nwhere some codes emerged from the literature and other\ncodes emerged from engagement with the transcripts\nwere collated according to the interface being reported on,\nthat is, CAB-participating community members, educator-\ninterested community members, and consent counselor-\npotential participants and were finally clustered according\nto critical goals being pursued, such as comprehension. A\nsample of interviews was coded by an independent coder.\nCoding differences were resolved by \"reconciliation discus-\nwas obtained for participation in FGDs. Site leadership\ngave permission for site entry, and visits with various site\nconstituencies were undertaken to plan the research in 2013.\nThree interactive feedback sessions were conducted in mid-\naccuracy of the preliminary results (using anonymized\ndata), to stimulate discussion about the preliminary\n324 Journal of Empirical Research on Human Research Ethics 11(4)\nfindings, to discuss the practical utility of the emerging\nresults, and to plan avenues for future inquiry.\nResults\nCAB members, educators and consent counselors all\ndescribed various practices to communicate key concepts in\na way that enhanced understanding. However, in many\ninstances, they appeared to be striving to reach other impor-\ntant goals, such as building trust in communicated informa-\ntion, respecting the culture of persons with whom they were\ninteracting, and preserving the free choice of potential par-\nticipants. Notably, in a few select instances, these goals\nappeared to be in tension. The results are organized into\nfour sections representing overarching goals, and within\neach section, various strategies to achieve these goals are\ndescribed.\nEnhancing Comprehension\nCAB members, educators, and consent counselors all\nreported that they \"share\"/\"give\" information (\"inform\")\nor \"educate\" potential participants and participating com-\nmunity members about key issues, such as HIV as a prob-\nlem, the need for multiple HIV-prevention methods, the\nneed for research, the nature of research, HIV vaccine tri-\nals, aims, procedures, risks, benefits, right to withdraw,\nand other concepts. This \"informing\" was explicitly linked\nto the goal of enhancing understanding, but more implic-\nitly, they also seemed to view themselves as providing a\nkind of information service--to build knowledge and\nskills about HIV prevention. This information (the \"what\")\nwas reportedly delivered using various practices (the\n\"how\") outlined below.\nRepresentatives from most constituencies reportedly\nmade efforts to \"inform\" without using unfamiliar or overly\ntechnical terms. Also, CAB members, educators, and con-\nsent counselors all discussed using analogies to explain dif-\nficult research-related concepts. This included, for example,\nreferring to \"soldiers\" to help explain the role of antibodies\n(\"Antibodies, I can make an example of the soldiers. Like,\nthe army . . . the army is there to attack, the intruder\" [FGD\n3, Educators]). Various analogies were reportedly available\nto help explain different risks associated with being vacci-\nnated with an experimental HIV vaccine in a clinical trial.\nFor example, to help communicate the potential risk of\nincreased susceptibility to HIV if vaccinated, the analogy of\na \"magnet\" could help explain how an experimental vac-\ncine might make people more susceptible to HIV infection.\nParticipants also acknowledged the potential for confusion\nto arise from the use of some analogies.1\nFurthermore, CAB members, educators, and consent\ncounselors all reported using familiar examples--from\neveryday life--to explain research and its contribution to\nhealth (e.g., a popular local over-the-counter analgesic like\nGrandpa headache powder was alluded to as a product of\nresearch). They also frequently invoked familiar childhood\nvaccines (such as polio vaccine or tuberculosis (TB) vac-\ncine) to explain the process and benefits of vaccines--how\nvaccines have controlled deadly diseases, and how their\nsafety and efficacy must be explored with human volun-\nteers (\"you have to start with what they know, you have to\nstart with the flu vaccine\" [FGD 4, Consent Counselors]).\nHere, they were trying to build understanding of less famil-\niar material by drawing on experiences with common med-\nical interventions:\n. . . if you make mention of the vaccines about polio, measles\nand other diseases, it clears up their mind, and it gets into\ntheir understanding--\"okay there is a vaccine for other\ndiseases\" so, there are, you make comparison, of the HIV\nvaccine to the vaccines that are available in the local clinics.\n(FGD 3, Educators)\nIn addition, site staff reported using various aids, for\nexample, educators reported using PowerPoint presenta-\ntions or pamphlets to ensure that participating community\nmembers have a visual representation of what is being ver-\nbally discussed. Consent counselors reported bringing\ninstruments to the consent discussion (such as tubes for\nblood draws) to help potential participants better under-\nstand procedures they would undergo:\nSo, another thing that's, that helps a lot, if you are going to talk\nabout blood samples, visual aids help a lot. If you gonna talk\nabout blood samples you cannot say \"we gonna take this much\nblood,\" in their mind they cannot make up, how much blood\nyou gonna take. You need to have those tubes in front of you\n. . . (FGD 4, Consent Counselors)\nAlso, educators and consent counselors reported using\nvarious techniques to increase discussion with, participa-\ntion by, and contributions from, potential participants.\nEducators reported modeling the asking of challenging\nquestions, and using group formats where question-ask-\ning would be modeled by other attendees. Consent coun-\nselors described building in \"pauses\" (\"stops\"), asking\nfor questions, directly asking questions of attendees,\nworking through consent forms, and using group formats\nfor consent discussions where making inputs was mod-\neled for other group attendees. Here, trying to get persons\nto interact with site staff seemed to be viewed as a good\noutcome in and of itself (possibly because it respected\ntheir status as adult learners, with an experiential base)\nbut was also viewed as an important way to improve\nunderstanding by identifying knowledge needs and\nknowledge deficiencies:\n. . . we make sure that we do, when we are doing a consent\ndiscussion group, we have more people, maybe ten people, so\nthat there can be more discussion and it will be the first time that\nthey will be hearing about the study, so we expect that they will\nhave many questions, so that they can be able to understand what\nwill be going on in the study . . . (FGD 6, Consent Counselors)\nConsent counselors observed that participants some-\ntimes report that they understand even when they do not\nunderstand, linking this to potential power differentials\n(e.g., between participants and senior study staff like study\nclinicians), or to participants'desires to service the relation-\nship with the counselor:\n. . . like they will stare at you, and then when you ask questions\nthey'll say, \"no I'm ok.\" You know what I mean, so that's why\nyou need to prepare at first that, \"we will interact, I will give\nyou information, (there'll be) questions. If you don't ask me, I\nwill ask you.\" (FGD 4, Consent Counselors)\nIn response, consent counselors described not necessar-\nily accepting reports that participants understood, but rather\nattempting to check participants' understanding by asking\nthem to explain research concepts in their own words, iden-\ntifying gaps in understanding, and revisiting informational\naspects, as highlighted in the quote below:\n. . . that is why from the very onset, when that participant\ncomes to the site, when you are giving that information, you\npause, and ask the participant \"do you understand? Can you\nexplain to me what exactly did you (take in), from what I was\nsaying to you?\" From there it's . . . pick up that ok, now the\nparticipant absorbed this information, this one didn't really go\nin. Then we know where to do the touch-ups . . . (FGD 5,\nConsent Counselors)\nFurthermore, consent counselors reported making\nefforts to communicate with potential participants using\ntheir preferred language--to help get messages across\nthereby improving understanding. However, it seemed to\nalso be used to achieve other more implicit goals such as\nmaking participants feel more comfortable (at ease) during\nthe interaction, to equip them for the consent encounter and\nto respect them as choosing agents by showing them that\ntheir preferences would be respected. Sometimes the goal\nof improving understanding and the goal of respecting\nchoices appeared to conflict--such as when counselors\nreported overriding preferences for English when it was\nclear that this would undermine comprehension, as seen in\nthe following quote:\n. . . our participant would like to choose English . . . maybe they\nare fearing to be judged, by us . . . you'll find \"no, sisi [sister],\nyou don't understand English.\" And, they said \"no I\nunderstand\" I said \"ok fine, explain to me, what `blood test'\nmean.\" You know what I mean. (FGD 4, Consent Counselors)\nConsent counselors also reported switching between\nlanguages to accommodate participants' language prefer-\nences. (\"So you switch yourself you go for the language\nthat is easy for him, you can go for the deeper language,\nyou just accommodate\" [FGD 4, counselors].) Educators\nand consent counselors reported doing on-the-spot trans-\nlation of terminology into potential participants' home\nlanguage--with some resulting challenges. As one coun-\nselor remarked, \"Most of the scientific terms do not exist\nat all, in the indigenous language, so we have to make a\nsentence in order to define that word\" (FGD 4, Consent\nCounselor). Consent counselors reportedly viewed the\ninformed-consent process as an ongoing process with\nmultiple opportunities to interact with participants and to\nreinforce information:\n. . . so every visit they come, we review the informed consent.\nWe know mos it's a lot of information that we give them in the\ninformed consent form--maybe they will forget . . . If they\nhaving some questions in that--because they have got their\ncopies, to take home and to read it at home. Then, if they've got\nany questions, come back they answer/they ask the questions.\nAnd then each day . . . has got its own procedures. That is when\nyou have to revisit the informed consent that we did at first . . .\n(FGD 5, Consent Counselors)\nConsent counselors experienced some tension between\nsound understanding and the sheer volume of information\nthat needed to be disclosed in the available time frame, and\ntensions between sound understanding, and the demands of\nworking through several consent forms, for example, one\nfor trial enrollment and another for stored samples. As one\nreported,\nSo for us we find it is very strenuous but there are these\nclauses that limit us that come from the sponsor that part of\nthese visits these are the consents. Cos we feel it's too much,\nreally, doing different consents in one time . . . (FGD 4,\nConsent Counselors)\nEducators and consent counselors also described identi-\nfying key characteristics of the persons they were educating\nand making efforts to accommodate these:\n. . . we need to understand this person or this group. You\nunderstand. Their level of understanding, a way of observing\n. . . these are the things that you always consider, you know\nprior you know starting a consent . . . (FGD 4, Consent\nCounselors)\nEducators and consent counselors recognized that there\nmay be preexisting ideas in the minds of potential partici-\npants or circulating in the community that might undermine\nunderstanding of important information, and that explana-\ntions have to be tailored to such misunderstandings:\n326 Journal of Empirical Research on Human Research Ethics 11(4)\n. . . we start explaining to the participant that, what exactly the\nCentre is doing. That we are a research centre unit, we are not\ntaking blood as for donation . . . we are not giving people food\nparcels because some of them they come with that mind-set that\nthey are going to get food parcels, so we need to explain to\nparticipants, some of them they will come and said, \"I'm\ncoming for VCT\" [Voluntary Counseling and Testing] . . .\n(FGD 5, Consent Counselors)\nBuilding Trust\nCAB members, educators, and counselors all reported\nencountering information about key research concepts\namong community members and potential participants that\nis wrong or inaccurate. In response, they reported that they\nelaborate, explain, educate, invite for education, use spe-\ncific terms, give the \"right\" or \"correct\" information, as\nwell as track common suspicions. However, in addition to\nmerely giving information that is \"correct\" (or simplified,\nor translated, or adequately discussed--as discussed under\nthe \"Enhancing Comprehension\" section), they reported\nvarious strategies likely to build trust in the information that\nis given, that is, likely to strengthen the credibility of infor-\nmation that is given\nFor example, it was reported that ex-participants play a\nrole in informing others about the research. This served not\nonly to enhance understanding, by being able to detail the\nimpacts of participation, but also, more implicitly, to build\ntrust in the account because it derived from a credible\nsource:\nAnd when I reach out to the community I explain to them that\nI am also, one of those participants on the site, so I practice\nwhat I actually preach to them . . . I say \"no, I've been I've\ngone through this my own self, so, I practice what I actually\npreach . . .\" (FGD 2, CAB members)\nFurthermore, it was reported that educators and consent\ncounselors employed at the site were drawn from similar\ncultural, racial, and linguistic backgrounds. This served not\nonly to improve comprehension of transmitted information\nby, for example, using appropriate language but also to\nstrengthen confidence that such information is trustworthy.\nRepresentatives from most constituencies described var-\nious practices they viewed as critical in building interper-\nsonal trust between themselves and participating community\nmembers or potential participants with whom they interact.\nCAB members and consent counselors reported the impor-\ntance of being honest or transparent, and being consistent or\nreliable:\nyou can never try to motivate behavior in the communities, if\nyou talk this, and tomorrow you do the other . . . And it will\nreally lose trust in you, because you telling us this, and you are\nnot doing it yourself. (FGD 2 CAB)\nIn addition, consent counselors acknowledged the\nimportance of respecting confidences, and generally treat-\ning potential participants right (such as greeting, welcom-\ning, offering refreshments, and showing interest in their\nnonresearch lives). These latter aspects underscore the\nintrinsic importance of treating potential participants with\nrespect:\n. . . then I'm like \"have a seat, and relax,\" make that\nparticipant feel at home, and to try to communicate with the\nparticipant, try to feel what the participant is feeling, try to\nput yourself in their shoes. Then that's what makes the\nparticipant--the other thing is, speaking the same language\nwith the participant . . . it makes him or her comfortable . . .\n(FGD 5, Consent Counselors)\nAlso, educators and consent counselors noted the impor-\ntance of the site providing services to participating commu-\nnity members who are not enrolled in any research (e.g.,\nhealth screening, counseling) and also to enrolled partici-\npants (e.g., ancillary care). Serving the community and\npotential participants, and describing such services when\neducating about trials, communicated that the site (and its\nstaff) is not motivated merely by self-interest but can be\ntrusted to further the nonresearch interests of the constitu-\nencies with whom it interacts.Serving acted as a balance to\ntaking (time, goodwill) from such persons--it was a form\nof giving back, and an observable demonstration of sensi-\ntivity to their nonresearch lives:\nAnd then you ask them about social impacts, because there are\nso many things that are happening in our communities . . . So\nthat makes a person feel very, very comfortable, and see that\nyou care for them. So you don't just give them vaccine and just\nsit down and, you don't follow up on whatever happens in their\nlives. [And later] then you'll see that that participant has hope\nthat it's not about the study, that's it, then you deal with the\nother issues that they have. (FGD 5, Consent Counselors)\nIn addition, CAB members, educators, and counselors\nall reported that they describe the site as a partner in the\nstruggle against HIV--a struggle shared with community\nmembers. Here, the site was positioned as an ally doing its\npart against the epidemic, not only implying that a com-\nmensurate response from the participating community\nwould be valued but also increasing trust in the site's broad\nmotivation--HIV prevention. Also, as discussed earlier,\nCAB members, educators, and consent counselors fre-\nquently invoked proven childhood vaccines such as polio\nvaccine--which not only served to enhance understanding\nof the pathway for HIV vaccine research but also might\nserve to build trust in medical research as a whole, by citing\nsignificant contributions that research has made to improve\nthe everyday lives, and health, of the most vulnerable soci-\netal members, namely, children.\nRespecting Culture\nConsent counselors reported recognizing that potential\nparticipants are drawn from cultures where norms govern-\ning how information can be discussed may differ from\nnorms governing the research enterprise. There were\ninstances where counselor efforts to improve understand-\ning of research concepts appeared to conflict with demon-\nstrating respect for participants' culture. In such instances,\nconsent counselors reported seeking permission to break\ncultural boundaries--whereby they signaled to prospective\nparticipants that culturally sensitive material was immi-\nnent, justified the importance of the material in relation to\nits sensitivity, and sought implicit permission to proceed.\nIn the quote below, the research procedure of rectal sam-\npling is being discussed:\n. . . in our African people like if you say, to talk about, rectal\nsampling when you have to explain to them, it seems as if you\nbeing rude . . . so when you have to talk about anus and vaginas,\nand now when you have to explain it in Xhosa, it's becoming a\nbig word, and her/in her ears. So you try to be like, even when\nyou talk to her and say, \"This is going to be sensitive\" . . .\nbecause they start to be shocked when you try to explain these\nwords to them. (FGD 4, Consent Counselors)\nPreserving Free Choice\nConsent counselors experienced some tensions when pro-\nmoting understanding of key concepts such as payment for\nparticipation. They recognized that payment often acts as\nthe initial motivator, so efforts are needed to broaden moti-\nvation by informing potential participants about beneficial\nstudy procedures, for example, health screens, as well as the\noverall purpose of HIV vaccine research:\n. . . we had a participant on (protocol name) . . . She said \"you\nknow what when I came in here, my intention was to get\nmoney, honestly, you understand. But now as the time goes by\nwhere I get educated by counselors, I start changing that\nattitude.\" That's the process of our most participants they\nfollow . . . (FGD 4, Consent Counselors)\nThey experienced some conflict between, on one hand,\ntheir need for potential participants to understand study-\nrelated payments (and study-related benefits), and, on the\nother hand, their need for participants to concentrate on the\nright things when deciding about research enrollment:\nSo, you have to explain clear, about that, not to put money\nfirst. Because if you put money first the participant will only\ncome because they will get money, they will not concentrate or\nunderstand what's gonna, what is, going on . . . (FGD 5,\nConsent Counselors)\nConsent counselors also reported emphasizing the\nconcept of voluntariness in their interactions with potential\nparticipants, so that the right to refuse or withdraw is under-\nstood, even while recognizing that participants may fail to\nwithdraw from studies (despite understanding their right to\nwithdraw) because of complexities linked, paradoxically, to\nthe high-quality relationship described under the \"Building\nTrust\" section:\nWe always tell them, at the first, they have a right to withdraw\nat any time they want, this is their voluntary, but you will find\nout now, they are not doing their best, because they want to\nimpress us, because we have built that kind of a relationship\nwhere we know them, on their first-name basis, now they want\nto impress us . . . (FGD 4, Consent Counselors)\nLastly, consent counselors (and, in fact, also educators\nand CAB members) reported appealing to altruism when\nencouraging support for trials, and even participation in tri-\nals. They described emphasizing that participation contrib-\nutes positively to society as a whole, and that selfless acts\nare required in the fight against the HIV epidemic. They did\nnot explicitly report concerns about the impact of such\nappeals on voluntary choices.\n. . . because we all know that HIV is killing all of us. And, I\nbelieve that as we are explaining the importance of using this\n(product) they will be, at some point or in some years to come,\nthey will be happy and knowing that they were part of that\nclinical trials, that came up along with the product, that can\nprevent the HIV infections . . . at the end of the day it's gonna\nbenefit many people, generations and generations of people to\ncome . . . (FGD 4, Consent Counselors)\nDiscussion\nRepresentatives from various constituencies in our study\nreported a range of strategies to promote understanding of\nkey research concepts. However, they also appeared com-\nmitted to building trust, showing cultural respect, and pro-\nmoting voluntary consent for participation. In most\ninstances, there was harmony among these goals, yet, in\nsome instances, there was some tension between them. In\nthis section, these goals are discussed in relation to relevant\nliterature.\nPromoting Comprehension\nFirst, many of the practices reported to communicate trial\ninformation resonate with recommendations to inform edu-\ncational and consent encounters with principles of adult\neducation and principles of communication (Meade, 1999;\nWoodsong & Abdool Karim, 2005). For example, everyday\nexamples and analogies were reportedly used--represent-\ning efforts to help people understand new ideas by relating\nthese to the rich reservoir of information and experience\nthey already possess as adult learners (Spezzini, 2010).\nThe use of more than one language (code switching) was\n328 Journal of Empirical Research on Human Research Ethics 11(4)\ndescribed--recommended in adult education to not only\npresent the subject matter clearly but also create a warmer,\nless alienating atmosphere for learning (Omidire, 2014).\nEfforts to increase interaction were reportedly used--repre-\nsenting efforts to tap into accumulated skills and awareness\n(Knowles, 1980). Critically for consent, \"active participa-\ntion\" (where questions are asked, and concerns elicited)\nhelps ensure participants \"receive information that is per-\nsonally material\"--allowing them to act on personal values\nleading to better quality decision making.\nSecond, many of the reported strategies are consistent\nwith ethical-guideline recommendations to be process-\nfocused--namely, that research teams should strive to\ncommunicate key concepts, to promote the expression of\nparticipants'concerns and questions, to establish an optimal\nemotional context to explore information, to be sensitive to\nthe interpersonal interaction, to be aware of social desirabil-\nity, and to be culturally sensitive (UNAIDS/WHO, 2012;\nJoint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS\nThird, many of the reported practices are in accordance\nwith empirical research underscoring the importance of dis-\ncussion in enhancing comprehension of research. For\nresearch generally, Nishimura and colleagues (2013) found,\nin a systematic review of 54 consent interventions tested in\nrandomized controlled trials, that discussion-based inter-\nventions were among the most effective at promoting\nunderstanding. Tamariz, Palacio, Robert, and Marcos\n(2012) found, in a systematic review of consent interven-\ntions for low-literacy participants, that more time in discus-\nsion was the most effective intervention. For HIV vaccine\ntrials specifically, Coletti and colleagues (2003) found that\nan enhanced consent process among a subset of participants\nin a vaccine preparedness study was associated with sub-\nstantial knowledge gains compared with a standard con-\nsent--the enhanced process included discussion of materials\nwith educators, and additional discussion with trained staff\nmembers. However, Koblin et al. (2010) found no apparent\nadvantage to a consent intervention (also comprising dis-\ncussion) conceding this may have been due to the success of\nthe standard consent. Other consent explorations in HIV\nvaccine trials point to success of educational sessions\n(Fitzgerald, Marotte, Verdier, Johnson, & Pape, 2002;\nJoseph, 2006). Notably, the communication strategies used\nin these discussions (and implicated in the positive out-\ncomes) have not been analyzed or described in published\nresearch. We are aware of only one study for HIV vaccine\ntrials--conducted by Watermeyer and Penn (2008)--that\ndescribed communication practices being used in two taped\nconsent discussions between counselors and potential par-\nticipants. They reported finding several positive counselor\npractices, such as providing simple explanations at appro-\npriate linguistic levels and creating personalized moments\n(humor, laughter). They also reported finding several nega-\ntive counselor practices, such as dominating the session,\nallowing minimal participant contribution, and not making\nefforts to verify information. Yet, they did not explore the\nrelationship of such practices to outcomes such as improved\ncomprehension. It has been argued that--even for research\nas a whole--it is still not entirely clear what aspects of con-\nsent discussions or \"person to person\" interactions promote\nFourth, many of the strategies reported here underscore\nthe recommendation in the HIV-prevention literature that\ninformed-consent processes can be strengthened by prior\nand ongoing community engagement (UNAIDS, 2011;\nWoodsong & Abdool Karim, 2005). Strategies to communi-\ncate key concepts were reportedly implemented by engage-\nment stakeholders (educators and CAB members) at earlier\neducation sessions in the community and at the site, as well\nas by consent staff during consent discussions. This sug-\ngests that engagement and consent staff should be helped to\ndevelop and share accurate and consistent messaging for\ntheir communications. Even where sites do not use this\n\"staggered\" approach, they should be aware that potential\nparticipants might have been exposed to some concepts\nbefore they interact with consent staff in individual consent\nsessions, and that community-level (\"on the street\") under-\nstandings may have an impact on individual-level apprais-\nAlso, some forms of effective communication may well\nbe threatened by time and efficiency pressures. For example,\ninteractive encounters are arguably more time-consuming\nand less \"efficient\" than conventional \"lecture\"-type inter-\nactions but may be associated with better outcomes (e.g.,\nbetter attention or better motivation to learn; Knight &\nWood, 2005). Continued frank discussion, during staff\ntraining, about potential threats to effective communication\nis important to ongoing efforts to strengthen key processes.\nFinally, we found that several communication practices\nperceived to be important by site staff involved in consent\nencounters were not reflected in available observational\nframeworks for consent, such as the Process and Quality of\nInformed Consent instrument or P-QUIC (Gross-Cohn\net al., 2011), for example, practices to demonstrate aware-\nness of cultural differences. Available frameworks may\nbenefit from adaptation based on empirical work with con-\nsent communicators.\nBuilding Trust\nMany of the practices reported here from both educational\nand consent encounters to build trust in the information\nbeing communicated (e.g., making use of trustworthy\nsources) show that site staff face considerable suspicion\nabout medical research in general, about the site itself and\neven about themselves (Rautenbach et al., 2015). This\nunderscores the importance of the dual goals of building\n\"research competency\" (\"literacy\") and of building trusting\nrelationships (cf. UNAIDS, 2011) and recognizes \"mis-\ntrust\" to be as important a barrier to involvement in trials as\n\"misinformation\" (cf. Andrasik et al., 2014; Newman &\nMacQueen, Bhan, Frohlich, Holzer, Sugarman et al. (2015),\nfuture research into engagement should evaluate the explicit\ncontribution of various practices to various outcomes--not\nonly increased trust but also increased understanding, cul-\ntural sensitivity, and contributions to research, as well as\ndecreased controversy or conflict (MacQueen et al., 2015;\nNewman et al., 2015; Rubincam, Lacombe-Duncan, &\nNewman, 2016). This qualitative investigation cannot deter-\nmine which practices actually have an impact on the desired\noutcome of increased trust (nor any other desired outcome),\nbut can shed light on practices perceived by core stakehold-\ners to be significant, for incorporation into future explora-\ntions. What this study does indicate is that a singular focus\non information disclosure may elide crucial elements of trust\nbuilding implicit in the education and consent process.\nRespecting Culture\nSeveral practices described by these constituents represent\nefforts to show respect for the culture of potential partici-\npants, such as using appropriate linguistic terms and care-\nfully broaching sensitive topics (cf. Bayer, 1994; Rubincam\net al., 2016). Interestingly, in instances where helping\npotential participants to understand what might happen to\nthem in trials was expected to run counter to cultural norms\nabout \"who\" can say \"what,\" consent counselors \"prepared\nthe ground\" for disclosure of sensitive information. This\npractice suggests that consent counselors do not uncritically\naccept cultural norms (cf. Bayer, 1994), such as those\nrestricting women from discussing sensitive topics with\nmen (e.g., sexual body parts). Instead, they acknowledge\nthese norms and justify sensitively overruling them in the\ninterests of participant understanding. Of course, it is not\nclear from this study whether such practices are actually\neffective in adjudicating between the goals of understand-\ning and cultural respect, but they merit further attention in\nresearch and practice guidelines.\nPromoting Voluntariness\nSeveral practices described by these constituents (e.g.,\nemphasizing voluntariness, discussing benefits) appear\nmore relevant to promoting voluntary research participa-\ntion, rather than informed research participation although\nvoluntariness and benefits are obviously concepts to be\nunderstood in their own right. There were concerns about\nwhether promoting understanding of benefits might come at\na price--where decision making is somehow undermined.\nMamotte and Wassenaar (2015) observed that voluntariness\nhas generally been conceptualized poorly. Leading models\nassert that \"offers\" are not threats to voluntariness unless\nresearch-related risks are undervalued, ignored, or disre-\ngarded (Appelbaum, Lidz, & Klitzman, 2009a). Site staff\nmay need reassurance that discussing payments or benefits\n(that themselves should be modest and well justified) with\npotential participants is not in and of itself ethically prob-\nlematic unless risks are being overlooked. Some site staff\ndescribed strategies to cultivate nonfinancial motivations\nfor enrollment. These data suggest that site staff may value\nopportunities to practice communicating research-related\nrisks skillfully to potential participants in such discussions.\nA recent study found that participants in two HIV clinical\ntrials did not report payment as the main reason for partici-\npation, nor was payment associated with reduced voluntari-\nThe practice of appealing to altruism was not explicitly\nreported as a concern; however, its ethical acceptability will\nbe briefly discussed here as this approach seemed to be fre-\nquently used. Appelbaum, Lidz, and Klitzman (2009a)\nargued that appealing to values such as \"altruistic impulses\"\n(p. 33) does not render a decision to enroll nonvoluntary,\nand \"altruism is generally regarded as the least problematic\nmotivation for participation\" (Appelbaum, Lidz, &\nappeals to altruism should not be at the expense of a thor-\nough discussion of research risks, or be used to preempt\nindividuals' stated concerns. Also, there are arguably many\nways to express altruism in the HIV epidemicapart from\ntrial enrollment, such as taking part in advocacy efforts for\nLimitations\nWe explored reported practices at one site, and therefore,\nour results may not be generalizable across other HIV vac-\ncine trial sites; however, it is possible that sites with similar\napproaches, staffing arrangements, and context may have\nsimilar experiences and may find aspects of this study\napplicable. Also, by design, FGDs were homogeneous to\nencourage openness and candor. Therefore, there was no\nopportunity for CABs, educators, and consent counselors to\ninteract and compare across constituencies their practices\n(or challenges they face), which may further illuminate\nsome of the issues described. Furthermore, FGDs were con-\nducted across a period of time, during which staffing duties,\npersonnel, and approaches may have shifted. Finally, as\nalluded to earlier, study methods used here cannot verify the\nactual practices being implemented. For example, it is pos-\nsible that in practice, educators and consent counselors use\nless interactive techniques than they reported--because of\nsocial desirability pressures to report communication efforts\nand the contextual pressure in practice to transmit many\n330 Journal of Empirical Research on Human Research Ethics 11(4)\ncomplex and legally required concepts in an efficient time\nframe. Also, merely because a strategy was not raised in a\nFGD does not necessarily mean it is not used. In addition,\nthis study cannot shed light on which practices are effective\nin achieving desired goals. Last, we did not canvass the\nviews of actual trial participants on these issues--this is a\nmore challenging population to engage with given under-\nstandable concerns with additional research activities that\nmay influence participant behaviors and the course of a\ntrial. Our results do, however, reveal important challenges,\nunofficial strategies, and insights from uniquely positioned\nand understudied informants who play vital roles in directly\ninterfacing with potential participants in HIV vaccine trials;\nand the results raise important issues for further research\nand engagement efforts.\nConclusion\nOverall, site staff involved in engagement and consent pro-\ncesses--such as educators and consent counselors--were\nnot merely trying to promote understanding of HIV vaccine\ntrials but appeared committed to other valued goals, such as\nbuilding trust, respecting culture, and promoting voluntari-\nness. The range of strategies and practices reportedly used\nto promote these goals was quite considerable. In several\ninstances, these goals appear to be in tension, such as\nrespecting language choice while promoting understanding,\npromoting understanding of invasive procedures while\nrespecting culture, or promoting understanding of study\naspects like payment while preserving free choice. Also, for\nthe goal of enhanced understanding, the need to transmit\nmultiple, complex concepts in an \"efficient\" time frame\nmay threaten those communication practices that are not\nnecessarily \"efficient.\"\nBest Practices\nTrial sites should continue to make the human-resource\ncommitments needed to ensure that participating commu-\nnity members and potential participants are engaged in mul-\ntiple activities designed to increase understanding of\nHIV-prevention trials. Sites should evaluate how well com-\nplex concepts are being communicated in consent and\nengagement encounters. Research Ethics Committees\nshould ask for more detail about the interpersonal strategies\nthat will be implemented to promote understanding (cf.\nWoodsong & Abdool Karim, 2005), in addition to scrutiniz-\ning the adequacy of written consent forms.\nResearch Agenda\nBuilding on our findings, actual engagement and consent\nencounters at HIV vaccine trial sites should be observed,\nrecorded, and analyzed. This might help open an important\n\"black box\" (cf. Wade, Donovan, Athene-Lane, Neal, &\nframeworks, for example, the P-QUIC (Gross-Cohn et al.,\n2011), but these should be adapted based on empirical\nresearch with relevant communicators, such as the present\nstudy. Site staff themselves should be involved in develop-\ning user-friendly frameworks that allow them to observe\nsimulated and real encounters, as part of their in-service\ntraining.Also, the relationship between practices being imple-\nmented in such encounters (e.g., promoting discussion) and\noutcomes (e.g., enhanced understanding) should be assessed\nNewman et al., 2015) so that site staff can inform their encoun-\nters with empirically informed practices. Further qualitative\nresearch should more fully explore the similarities and differ-\nences in practices used across different site constituencies.\nFurther qualitative research should explore more thoroughly\nimplicit tensions between site staff members' multiple goals,\nsuch as whether describing services as part of trust building\nmay be in tension with efforts to promote understanding of the\nsite's central purpose to conduct research. Finally, research\nwith enrolled trial participants (e.g., to explore the perceived\nusefulness of strategies such as using analogies) would enable\ntriangulation of participant perspectives with those of site\nstaff. In addition, it may be helpful to investigate changes in\nunderstanding and trust across various time points at clinical\ntrial sites--to ascertain how such phenomena evolve through-\nout ongoing contacts. Research with enrolled participants\ncould comprise ancillary studies attached to \"parent\" HIV\nvaccine trial protocols.\nEducational Implications\nRole-players at HIV vaccine sites involved in engagement\nand consent encounters should have access to training in\ncore communicative competencies--ideally those with evi-\ndence for their usefulness, not only those informed by, for\nexample, adult education principles. These efforts may help\nto make consent-related encounters as \"potent\" as possible\ngiven finite resources for such trials, and competing claims\non resources. Pressure to transmit multiple, complex con-\ncepts \"efficiently\" should be faced head-on as a potential\nthreat to effective communication, and best practices for\nresolving this tension should be shared. Further training and\neducational support should address other potential tensions\nidentified empirically, for example, how to respect cultural\nchoices about preferred language while still promoting\nunderstanding.\n"
