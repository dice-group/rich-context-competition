Daugherty et al. demonstrated that\nantagonist treatment exaggerated Ang II-induced ather-\nosclerosis in apoE-/- mice7; however, studies using AT2\n-\ndeficient mice showed conflicting results. Daugherty et al.\nshowed that AT2\ndeficiency did not affect atherosclerosis in\nlow density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-deficient mice,8\nwhereas Iwai et al. reported that the atherosclerotic lesion\narea was significantly enhanced in AT2\n/apoE double-defi-\ncient mice through the exacerbation of oxidative stress.9\nThese results raise concerns about the AT2\n-medited anti-\natherogenic effect of long-term treatment with Ang II\nreceptor blockers (ARB) or compound 21 (C21), a recently\ndeveloped orally active non-peptide and selective AT2\nThe expression of AT2\nis known to be restricted in the\nadult cardiovascular system, with lower expression levels\nrelative to the AT1\nreceptor, while it is up-regulated in vari-\nous pathological conditions including post-myocardial\ninfarction, heart failure, and arterial injury.11\u00ad13 It was\nrecently shown that the AT2\nis expressed in the muscular\nVascular angiotensin II type 2 receptor\nattenuates atherosclerosis via a\nkinin/NO-dependent mechanism\nHiroki Takata, Hiroyuki Yamada, Hiroyuki Kawahito, Sou Kishida,\nDaisuke Irie, Taku Kato, Noriyuki Wakana, Sonoko Miyagawa,\nKensuke Fukui and Hiroaki Matsubara\n Keywords\nAngiotensin, receptor, atherosclerosis, nitric oxide, oxidative stress\nDepartment of Cardiovascular Medicine,\nKyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan\nCorresponding author:\nHiroyuki Yamada, Department of Cardiovascular Medicine,\nKyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, 465 Kajii-cho,\nEmail: hiyamada@koto.kpu-m.ac.jp\nOriginal Article\n312 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(2)\nmedial layer of the aorta and in endothelial cells of resistant\narteries,14 and it is also up-regulated in the aortas of apoE-/-\nmice on an atherogenic diet.9,15 We previously generated\ntransgenic (AT2\n-Tg) mice featuring targeted AT2\nover-\nexpression in the vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs)\nand demonstrated that AT2\nin VSMCs promotes intracellu-\nlar acidosis by blocking the amiloride-sensitive Na+/H+\nexchanger, leading to kininogenase activation followed by\nbradykinin release from VSMCs, resulting in endothelial\nnitric oxide (NO)-dependent vasodilation and an anti-pres-\nsor response to Ang II.16 These findings lead to the hypoth-\nesis that AT2\nin the aortic medial layer exerts its\nanti-atherogenic action through endothelial bradykinin/NO\nsystem activation.\nIn this study, we crossed AT2\n-Tg mice with apoE-/- mice\nto generate vascular AT2\n-overexpressing apoE-/- (AT2\n-Tg/\napoE-/-) mice in an effort to elucidate the involvement of\nthe kinin/NO system in the observed AT2\n-mediated anti-\natherogenic action. We found that vascular AT2\nactivation\nexerts its anti-atherogenic action in an endothelial kinin/\nNO-dependent manner accompanied by decreased oxida-\ntive stress through decreased accumulation of superoxide-\nproducing mononuclear leukocytes. Our findings support\nthe notion that direct AT2\nactivation could be a potential\ntherapeutic option for preventing the development of ath-\nerosclerotic cardiovascular diseases.\nMaterials and methods\nAnimal preparation\n-Tg mice (C57BL/6) overexpressing the AT2\nunder con-\ntrol of the -smooth muscle actin promoter were generated\nas described previously.16 Homozygous AT2\n-Tg mice were\ncrossed with homozygous apoE-/- mice (C57BL/6) to yield\ndouble heterozygous mice. These heterozygous littermates\nwere bred with apoE-/- mice to establish AT2\n-Tg/apoE-/- mice\n(backcrossed>10 times). Male apoE-/- mice and AT2\n-Tg/\napoE-/- mice were weaned at 5 weeks of age onto a high-\ncholesterol diet (21% fat, 0.125% cholesterol; Oriental Yeast\nCo., Tokyo, Japan) that was maintained for 8 weeks. Starting\nat the age of 8 weeks, a subpressor dose ofAng II (100 ng/kg/\nmin) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was administered\nfor 4 weeks using an osmotic minipump. Before the implan-\ntation of osmotic minipumps, mice were anesthetized with a\nsingle intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (50 mg/kg) and\nxylazine (8 mg/kg). Sufficient anesthesia depth was con-\nfirmed by the lack of a tail pinch response.Additional groups\nof 8-week-old apoE-/- and AT2\n-Tg/apoE-/- mice were treated\nwith either L-NG-nitroarginine methyl ester (L-NAME;\n1 mg/ml in drinking water) or the bradykinin receptor inhibi-\ntor icatibant (70 mg/kg/day, osmotic minipump) in parallel\nwith the Ang II infusion.\nBefore the aortic tissues were isolated, the mice were sac-\nrificed by transcardiac perfusion under terminal anesthesia\nby intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital (200 mg/kg).\nAll investigations conformed to the Guidelines for Animal\nExperiments of the Kyoto Prefectural University of\nMedicine. The experiments were also approved by a local\nuniversity ethics review board.\nMembrane preparation and receptor assay\nMembrane fractions were prepared from pooled aortic sam-\nples and incubated with different concentrations (0.05\u00ad1 nM)\n20\u00b0C for the saturation experiment as described previously.17\nCGP42112A was determined from the difference between\ncounts in the absence of 10 \u00b5mol/l AT1\nantagonist (losartan)\nand the presence of 1 \u00b5mol/l AT2\nKd\nand Bmax\nvalues were estimated by Rosenthal analysis of\nthe saturation data, while the AT1\ndensities were cal-\nculated from the Bmax\nvalues.\nHemodynamic analysis\nMean blood pressure and heart rate were measured under\nconscious and unrestrained conditions using a programma-\nble sphygmomanometer (BP-98A; Softron, Tokyo, Japan).\nPlasma lipid analysis\nTotal cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations were deter-\nmined using an automated chemistry analyzer (Wako\nChemicals Co., Tokyo, Japan). LDL-cholesterol levels were\nquantified by an enzymatic reaction using a commercially\navailable kit (Daiichi Pure Chemicals Co., Tokyo, Japan).\nQuantitative measurement of atherosclerotic\nlesions\nThe mice were euthanized at 12 weeks of age and the ath-\nerosclerotic lesions were analyzed as described previ-\nously.18 Image analysis was performed on Oil Red O-stained\naortas using Scion Imaging software. The aortic lesion area\nin each animal was measured as the percentage of lesion\narea per total aortic area.\nImmunohistochemistry\nFor immunohistochemical analysis and superoxide product\nevaluation,AngIIwasadministeredfor2weekstotheapoE-/- and\n-Tg/apoE-/- mice from the age of 8 weeks. The aortic arch\nwas rapidly removed after PBS perfusion, embedded in opti-\nmal cutting temperature compound, and quick-frozen in liquid\nnitrogen. The atherosclerotic lesions in the aortic arch region\nwere examined at five locations at 100 \u00b5m intervals, and nine\nserial 6 \u00b5m-thick sections were prepared from each location,\nstained immunohistochemically with fluorescein isothiocy-\nanate (FITC)- or tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate\n(TRITC)-conjugated antibodies against vascular cell adhesion\nmolecule-1 (VCAM-1; clone 429, Pharmingen, San Diego,\nCA) and monocyte/macrophage antibody-2 (MOMA-2;\nSerotec, Oxford, UK), and then observed using a confocal\nmicroscope (FLUOVIEW FV300; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).\nAs a negative control, non-immune immunoglobulin and\nFITC- or TRITC-conjugated secondary antibodies were used.\nPositive VCAM-1 and MOMA-2 staining was evaluated using\nimage-analysissoftware.ThepercentagecoverageofVCAM-1\nin the total aortic area and the MOMA-2 staining area were\nassessed in five sections from six animals in each group.\nIn situ detection of superoxide anions\nFresh-frozen cross-sections of the ascending aorta (30 \u00b5m\neach) were incubated with dihydroethidium (DHE) (1 \u00b5M)\nin PBS for 30 min at 37\u00b0C in a humidified chamber pro-\ntected from light.19 To detect the ethidium, samples were\nexamined using a fluorescence microscope equipped with\na computer-based imaging system. The fluorescence\nintensity was pixilated and quantified using Scion Image\nsoftware.\nReal-time polymerase chain reaction\nThe thoracic aortas of the mice were dissected and the total\nRNA was isolated. Real-time polymerase chain reaction\n(RT-PCR) was performed using a LightCycler ST300\n(Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) with SYBR\nGreen PCR Master Mix and RT-PCR (Applied Biosystems,\nFoster City, CA) as described previously.20 The dissocia-\ntion curves were monitored to check for the aberrant primer\ndimers formation. PCR-amplified products were electro-\nphoresed on 2% agarose gels to confirm the presence of a\nsingle band. Data are expressed as levels relative to apoE-/-\nmice with PBS treatment.\nNicotinamide adenine dinucleotide\nphosphate oxidase activity\nProtein samples were extracted from aortas after 1 week of\nAng II infusion, and incubated for 30 min in Krebs-HEPES\nbuffer at 37\u00b0C. The rings were transferred to scintillation\nand incubated for 5 min at 37\u00b0C in the dark. After incuba-\ntion, chemiluminescence was measured using a luminom-\neter (Lumat LB 9507; Berthold Technologies Ltd) over a\nperiod of 10 min at 1 min intervals. After measurement,\n100 \u00b5mol/l nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate\n(NADPH) (Sigma Chemical Co, St Louis, MO) was added\nand the rings were further incubated at 37\u00b0C for 60 min.\nL-012 chemiluminescence was expressed as relative light\nunits per milligram of dry tissue weight per minute.\nNADPH oxidase activity was quantified from the absorb-\nance with or without NADPH.\nMeasurement of Ca2+-dependent NO\nsynthase activity\nProtein samples were extracted from the aortas after 1 week of\nAng II infusion. NO synthase (NOS) activity was measured\nusing the conversion rate of radio-labeled L-[3H] citrulline\nfrom L-[3H] arginine (Amersham, Little Chalfont, UK).21\nDuplicate incubations were performed for 60 min at room\ntemperature for each sample in the presence or absence of\nethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (2 mmol/l) to determine the\nCa2+-dependent NOS activity.\nStatistical analysis\nAll data are expressed as means \u00b1 SE. Mean values were\ncompared using analysis of variance. If a statistically sig-\nnificant effect was found, Scheffe's F test was performed to\ndetect the difference between groups. Values of p<0.05\nwere considered statistically significant.\nResults\nExpression of AT2\nin the aortas of AT2-Tg/\napoE-/- mice\nWe generated five different AT2\n-Tg lines and then crossed\n-Tg902 mice, which expressed aortic\nmost abundantly, with apoE-/- mice. As the findings\nobtained from AT2\nmice were similar, we here described the result from\n-Tg901/apoE-/- that expressed aortic AT2\nfmol/mg protein) (Supplemental Figure 1) more abundantly\nThe proportion of aortic AT2\nrelative to AT1\n0.1%, identical to that in AT2\nwas not detected in the aortas of apoE-/- mice,\nand there were no significant differences in aortic AT1\nreceptor density between apoE-/- and AT2\nmice (Supplemental Figure 1). The Kd\nvalue (nmol/l) of\nin the aorta from AT2\nmals had similar weights relative to their control littermates\n(designated as apoE-/- mice), and there was no evidence of\nobvious morphological changes of the aorta.\nVascular AT2\nactivation inhibits\natherosclerosis development in apoE-/- mice\nWe first compared the atherosclerotic lesion area between\napoE-/- and AT2\n-Tg/apoE-/- mice fed a high-cholesterol\ndiet for 8 weeks; however, no significant difference was\nobserved between groups. We next examined the effect of\na subpressor dose of Ang II (100 ng/kg/min) on athero-\nsclerotic lesion development. Atherosclerotic lesion area\nwas markedly increased in apoE-/- mice (from 3.0% \u00b1\n314 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(2)\natherosclerotic lesion development was substantially\n-Tg/apoE-/- mice (p<0.05) (Figures\n1(a) and 1(b)), suggesting that activation of the vascular\nexerts anti-atherogenic actions. Hemodynamic\nparameters and lipid profiles did not differ between the\ntwo groups (Supplemental Figures 2A and 2B).\nBlockade of the bradykinin/NO system by\nL-NAME or icatibant abolishes AT2\n-mediated\nanti-atherogenic actions\nWe previously demonstrated that targeted overexpression\nof the AT2\nin VSMCs exerted an antipressor response to\nAng II through a kinin/NO-dependent mechanism.16 To\nelucidate the involvement of the kinin/NO system in AT2\n-\nmediated anti-atherogenic actions, L-NAME or icatibant\nwas administered in combination with the Ang II infusion.\nCo-treatment with L-NAME did not affect the Ang\nII-induced atherosclerotic lesions in apoE-/- mice; how-\never, the lesion area in L-NAME-treated AT2\n-Tg/apoE-/-\nmice was significantly increased to a similar extent as that\napoE-/- vs. AT2\n-Tg/apoE-/-; p=n.s.) (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)).\nSimilarly, the AT2\n-mediated anti-atherogenic action\nobserved in AT2\n-Tg/apoE-/- mice was completely reversed\nby icatibant treatment. Considering that the bradykinin\ntype 2 receptor is exclusively expressed in the endothe-\nlium, these results suggest that the endothelial bradykinin/\nNO system is likely to be involved in AT2\n-mediated anti-\natherogenic action.\nVascular AT2\nactivation increases Ca2+-\ndependent NOS activity in apoE-/- mice\nTo further elucidate the activation of an endothelial brad-\nykinin/NO system in AT2\n-Tg/apoE-/- mice, Ca2+-\ndependent NOS activity in the aorta was examined after\n1 week of Ang II infusion, in which few adhesive mono-\nnuclear cells were observed in the intima (data not\nshown). In the absence ofAng II infusion, Ca2+-dependent\nNOS activity did not differ between the two groups of\nmice (Figure 3). In contrast, Ang II infusion into AT2\n-Tg/\napoE-/- mice markedly increased Ca2+-dependent NOS\nactivity (67% increase vs. PBS infusion, p<0.01), but had\nno effect on that in apoE-/- mice. This finding further sup-\nports the notion that the AT2\n-mediated enhancement of\nNOS activation and the subsequent NO production\nthrough an endothelial kinin/NO-dependent mechanism\nplay a critical role in AT2\n-mediated anti-atherogenic\naction.\nFigure 1.Vascular angiotensin II (Ang II) type 2 receptor (AT2) inhibits Ang II-induced atherosclerotic lesion formation.

In the absence of Ang II, the VCAM-1 expression\nwas equivalent between the two groups of mice.\nConsistent with the previous data,24 Ang II infusion sig-\nnificantly increased the expression of VCAM-1 on the\nFigure 2.

Similarly, Ang II-induced monocyte/mac-\nrophage accumulation in the luminal surface was signifi-\ncantly decreased in AT2\n-Tg/apoE-/- mice compared with\napoE-/- mice (Figures 4(c) and 4(d)), suggesting that aug-\nmented NO production inhibits VCAM-1 expression,\nresulting in attenuated accumulation of monocytes/mac-\nrophages in AT2\n-Tg/apoE-/- mice.\nWe also examined the effects of L-NAME on Ang\nII-induced VCAM-1 expression and monocyte/mac-\nrophage accumulation. L-NAME treatment further\nincreased Ang II-induced VCAM-1 expression in both\napoE-/- and AT2\n-Tg/apoE-/- mice; however, the extent was\nmuch larger in AT2\n-Tg/apoE-/- mice than in apoE-/- mice.\nConsequently, there was no significant difference in\nVCAM-1-positive area between apoE-/- and AT2\n-Tg/apoE-/-\nmice after L-NAME treatment (Supplemental Figure 3A).\nSimilarly, L-NAME treatment markedly augmented Ang\nII-induced monocyte/macrophage accumulation in\n-Tg/apoE-/- mice to the same extent as that in apoE-/-\nmice (Supplemental Figures 3B and 3C). These findings\nfurther supported the current hypothesis that vascular AT2\noverexpression exerts anti-atherogenic action through an\nendothelial kinin/NO system.\nVascular AT2\nattenuates Ang II-induced\noxidative stress by inhibiting the\naccumulation of superoxide-producing\nmononuclear leukocytes\nTo elucidate the manner in which AT2\ncounteracts AT1\n-\nmediated oxidative stress, cell-specific generation of super-\noxide anions was examined. In the absence of Ang II, the\nfluorescence intensity of DHE-positive mononuclear cells\nin the intima did not differ between apoE-/- and AT2\n-Tg/\napoE-/- mice (Figures 5(a) and 5(b)). In contrast, 2 weeks of\nAng II infusion into apoE-/- mice significantly increased the\nfluorescence intensity, particularly in the intima, which was\ncompletely inhibited in AT2\n-Tg/apoE-/- mice. Consistent\nwith this finding, the mRNA expression level of Nox2,\nphagocytic NADPH oxidase,25 was markedly increased in\napoE-/- mice (5.1-fold vs. PBS; p<0.05) after Ang II infu-\nsion (Supplemental Figure 4A), but was significantly\nreduced in AT2\n-Tg/apoE-/- mice, suggesting that AT2\n-\nmediated anti-oxidative action is mostly exerted by inhibit-\ning the accumulation of superoxide-producing mononuclear\nleukocytes.\nWe also examined the activity of NADPH oxidase after\n1 week of Ang II infusion, at which time few adhesive\nmononuclear cells were observed in the intima (data not\nshown), and found no significant difference between the\ntwo groups of mice (Supplemental Figure 4B). These find-\nings suggest that vascular-targeted overexpression of AT2\nexerts its anti-oxidative action by attenuating the accumula-\ntion of superoxide-producing mononuclear leukocytes\nrather than by a direct effect on vascular NADPH oxidase\nactivity.\nDiscussion\nThis is the first study to indicate that targeted overexpres-\nsion of AT2\nin VSMCs significantly attenuates atheroscle-\nrotic lesion development in an endothelial kinin/\nNO-dependent manner. We previously demonstrated that\nstimulation in VSMCs promotes intracellular acidosis\nby blocking the amiloride-sensitive Na+/H+ exchanger,\nleading to activation of kininogenases followed by brady-\nkinin release, which causes endothelial NO-dependent vas-\nodilation in mice.16 Accumulating evidence supports the\nnotion that the AT2\nstimulates a vasodilator signaling cas-\ncade that includes bradykinin, NO, and guanosine cyclic 3',\n5'-monophosphate.26 The present study using AT2\n-Tg/\napoE-/- mice provides new evidence that the AT2\nbradykinin\nNO system exerts its anti-atherogenic action by attenuating\nthe increased VCAM-1 expression and monocyte/mac-\nrophage accumulation, both of which are essentially\ninvolved in the early stage of atherosclerosis development.\nFurthermore, the protective effect ofAT2\non oxidative stress\nwas mostly exerted through reduced accumulation of\nsuperoxide-producing mononuclear leukocytes rather than\nFigure 3.Vascular angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT2)\nactivation increases Ca2+-dependent nitric oxide synthase\n(NOS) activity in apoE-/- mice.

The biological relevance of these results\nshould be assessed in vivo experiments. From this point of\n-Tg/apoE-/- mice in which AT2\nis overexpressed\nin aortic VSMCs might be a suitable model for investing\nthe vascular action of aortic AT2\nin atherogenesis. Our\nfindings suggest that AT2\nreceptor in VSMCs plays a criti-\ncal role in atherogenesis, especially in hypercholester-\nolemia which elicits re-expression of the aortic AT2\nin the\nmedial cell layer including VSMCs.\nStudies investigating the effect of AT2\non the develop-\nment of atherosclerosis showed conflicting results. AT2\nexerted an anti-atherogenic effect in AT2\n/apoE double-defi-\ncient mice,9 whereas no such action was observed in AT2\n/\nLDL double-deficient mice.15 These discrepancies most\nlikely resulted from the different stages of atherosclerosis\ninvestigated. For example, the atherosclerotic lesion areas in\n/apoE double-deficient mice were estimated after 10\nweeks on a high-cholesterol diet, corresponding to the early\nstage of atherosclerosis, whereas the AT2\n/LDL double-defi-\ncient mice were analyzed at 5 months of age, at which point\nthe plaque evolution was further advanced. Similarly,\nDaugherty et al. demonstrated thatAT2\ntreatment exaggerated the Ang II-induced atherosclerotic\nlesion area in 2-month-old apoE-/- mice, whereas no such\neffect was observed at the age of 11 months.7\nLong-term treatment with a Western diet has been shown\nto impair endothelial function in apoE-/- mice.30,31\nConsidering that Ang II-induced Ca2+-dependent NOS\nactivity was enhanced in AT2\n-Tg/apoE-/- mice, the AT2\n-\nmediated anti-atherogenic effect is likely to be exerted in\nthe early stage of atherosclerosis, during which endothelial\nfunction was preserved. Therefore, it is of great importance\nthat the tissue-specific effect and time-dependent action of\nvascular AT2\nis carefully considered for estimating AT2\n-\nmediated anti-atherogenic actions in the multifactorial pro-\ncess of atherosclerosis.\nReactive oxygen species (ROS) and NO are crucial for\nthe development of atherosclerosis.32 AT2\nhas been shown\nto both increase NO production16 and inhibit ROS produc-\ntion9; however, the precise mechanism for AT2\n-mediated\nmodulation of oxidative stress remains to be determined.\nIwai et al.9 demonstrated that the AT2\naugmented Ang II-induced NADPH oxidase activity in rat\nfetal VSMCs, suggesting that the anti-atherogenic effect of\noccurs, in part, through the inhibitory effect on NADPH\noxidase activation, a dominant source of oxidative stress in\nthe vasculature.25 However, the present study did not show\nan inhibitory effect of AT2\non NADPH oxidase activity\nFigure 5.Vascular angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT2\n) attenuates Ang II-induced oxidative stress by inhibiting the accumulation\nof superoxide-producing mononuclear leukocytes.

(B) Quantitative analysis showing Ang II-induced augmentation of superoxide production\nin apoE-deficient (apoE-/-) mice, a phenomenon that was profoundly attenuated in AT2\ntransgenic/apoE-/- (AT2\n-Tg/apoE-/-) mice.\nSuperoxide levels were calculated as the ratio (fold increase) to the control values obtained from sequential unstained sections from\neach mouse.The bar graphs represent the mean \u00b1 SE relative to phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-treated apoE-/- mice set at 100%.\nAt least 6 mice were tested in each group. *p<0.05 vs. vessels from PBS-treated apoE-/- mice. #p<0.05 vs. vessels from Ang II-treated\napoE-/- mice.\n(Supplemental Figure 4B). Iwai et al. stimulated fetal\nVSMCs with 10-7 M Ang II and observed a significant\nincrease in NADPH oxidase activity,9 while the present\nstudy showed that a subpressor dose of Ang II did not\nincrease NADPH oxidase activity (Supplemental Figure 4B),\nsuggesting that AT2\nstimulation was likely to antagonize\n-mediated NADPH oxidase activity by directly inhibit-\ning crosstalk of the two receptors. Accordingly, the discrep-\nancy between these two experiments might be attributable\nto the extent of AT1\n-mediated augmentation of NADPH\noxidase activity.\nThe clinical relevance of AT2\nreceptor has not been con-\nfirmed because of the lack of a selective AT2\nagonist avail-\nable in clinical practice. Recently, compound 21 (C21), a\nnon-peptide, orally active and selective AT2\nagonist has\nstimulation by C21 has been\nreported to exert beneficial effects on cardiac and vascular\nfunction in rodents through an increased production of NO\nand/or suppression of the inflammatory response.33,34\nRehman et al.34 reported that endothelium-dependent relax-\nation in isolated rat aortas was enhanced in the C21\u00adlosartan\ncombination groups compared with losartan alone, suggest-\ning that C21 treatment increases NO production, ARB\ntreatment inhibits superoxide production, and both lead to\nthe increased NO bioavailability. Considering that the\nexpression of AT2\nreceptor is up-regulated in various patho-\nlogical conditions including post-myocardial infarction,\nheart failure, and arterial injury,11\u00ad13 the beneficial effect of\nis expected to be assessed in the future clinical trials.\nOur findings strongly support the notion that direct AT2\nstimulation exerts anti-atherogenic action and could be a\npotential therapeutic strategy for producing a clinically\nbeneficial effect on the cardiovascular system.\nConclusions\nactivation in VSMCs markedly inhibited the initiation of\natherosclerotic lesion development in an endothelial brady-\nkinin/NO-dependent manner, and AT2\n-mediated modulation\nof oxidative stress was mostly attributable to the enhanced\nNO production and inhibited accumulation of superoxide-\nproducing leukocytes. These findings provide novel evi-\ndence of vascular AT2\n-mediated anti-atherogenic actions and\nnew insight into the mechanism for AT2\n-mediated anti-oxi-\ndative action, which could resolve the controversial issue\nregarding the AT2\n-mediated effect on atherosclerosis.\nConflict of interest\nNone declared.\nFunding\nThis work was supported by a grant from the Ministry of\nEducation, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of\nJapan.\nReferences\n1.
