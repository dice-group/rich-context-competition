    "abstract": "Abstract\nPrevious research finds that marriage is associated with better health and lower mortality,\nand one of the mechanisms underlying this association is health-related selection out of\nmarriage. Using longitudinal survey data from 2,348 couples from the Fragile Families and\nChild Wellbeing Study, we examine whether certain health behaviors--smoking and binge\ndrinking--are associated with risk of union dissolution among couples with young children.\nWe use discrete time hazard models to test whether associations between health behaviors\nand union dissolution differ between married and cohabiting parents. We find no statistically\nsignificant association between binge drinking and union dissolution for either cohabiting or\nmarried couples. Parental smoking, however, is associated with union dissolution. On aver-\nage, married and cohabiting couples in which both parents smoke have a higher risk of\nunion dissolution than couples in which neither parent smokes. Additionally, father's smok-\ning (in couples in which the mother does not smoke) is associated with union dissolution, but\nonly for married couples. These findings illustrate the importance of considering the health\nbehaviors of both partners and provide further evidence of differences in union dissolution\ndynamics between married and cohabiting couples.\n",

Empirical evidence suggests that mar-\nriage causes individuals to change their health behaviors, including causing a reduction in\nrisky health behaviors, such as binge drinking and illegal drug use (see reviews in [2,3]). Previ-\nous research also suggests that engaging in certain health behaviors, such as heavy drinking, is\nnegatively associated with likelihood of entering marriage [4].

For example, frequent binge drinking may interfere with an individual's ability to parent\nresponsibly, placing children's safety at risk and/or causing the co-parent to shoulder more of\nthe caretaking responsibilities. The extent to which risky health behaviors interfere with family\nrole expectations may differ by gender, in part because norms about parenting differ by gen-\nder. Many risky health behaviors are also more normative for men [7], and behaviors that are\nmore common may be perceived as less incompatible with gender-specific family norms.\nSecond, risky health behaviors may incur substantial short-term and long-term financial\ncosts or instability. In the short-term, some health behaviors may cause a partner to miss work\nor lose employment, and the behavior itself may be expensive, as in the case of a cigarette\nsmoking habit or frequent bouts of heavy drinking. In the long-term, risky health behaviors\nmay impair health and cause serious morbidity or disability, potentially decreasing employ-\nment earnings and incurring high health care costs. Financial strain, in turn, might negatively\nimpact the quality of a couple's relationship [8].\nThird, risky health behaviors may impact the quality and tone of interactions between part-\nners, perhaps especially in couples in which only one partner engages in the risky behavior.\nBecause risky health behavior may interfere with family roles, incur financial costs, and nega-\ntively impact health, the partner who is not binge-drinking or smoking may try to exert social\ncontrol over the partner who is engaging in the risky behavior (see [1,9] regarding spousal\nsocial control of health behavior). Attempts by one partner to monitor or sanction the other\npartner's behavior might lead to conflict and a deterioration of relationship quality (for exam-\nple, [10] shows psychosocial effects of spousal diet control attempts).\nAnother possibility is that risky health behaviors are not themselves causally related to mar-\nital or union stability but rather are correlated with other characteristics that are associated\nwith union dissolution. For example, cigarette smoking is more common among less educated\nadults in the United States, and education is an important predictor of marital stability in the\nUnited States [11]. Some risky health behaviors--like binge drinking--are also associated with\nparticular health conditions, such as depressive symptoms [12], which previous research has\nfound are predictive of marital dissolution [13]. Risky health behaviors could also affect health\nstatus, and it may be the resultant health conditions, not the risky behaviors per se, that impact\nunion stability. For example, previous research finds that poor self-rated health is associated\nwith union dissolution [14].\nPsychosocial factors at the couple and individual levels might also produce non-causal asso-\nciations between health behaviors and union dissolution. For instance, if poor relationship\nquality generates psychosocial stress, individuals in lower quality relationships might be more\nlikely to smoke, as previous research has found that stress is linked to smoking [15]. At the\nindividual level, personality characteristics such as neuroticism are associated with both smok-\ning behavior and marital quality [16,17].\nStudies that have empirically examined the relationship between risky health behaviors and\nmarital dissolution have mixed findings. For example, in a sample pooling men and women\ntogether, Collins, Ellickson, and Klein [18] find that frequency of alcohol intoxication is posi-\ntively associated with risk of divorce among young, married individuals in the U.S. In contrast,\nin a U.K. sample, Cheung [19] finds that harmful drinking is associated with increased likeli-\nhood of being divorced for women, but not for men. Additionally, Cheung [19] finds that\nwomen who were light smokers were significantly more likely than non-smokers to be\ndivorced ten years later, but among men, heavy smokers were significantly less likely than\nnon-smokers to be divorced. Fu and Goldman [5] also find a complicated pattern of results\nHealth behaviors and union dissolution among parents of young children\nregarding risky health behaviors and divorce, in a U.S. sample (that excluded blacks and His-\npanics). On the whole, their findings suggest that smoking is positively associated with risk of\ndivorce for women and men, and that for men married longer than four years, moderate\ndrinking is negatively associated with divorce risk. Finally, another study finds that a \"mis-\nmatch\" in alcohol use is associated with an increased likelihood of marital dissolution [20].\nAmong studies analyzing the association between health behaviors and future dissolution\nrisk, relatively few examine couples with children specifically. One exception [6] shows evi-\ndence supportive of role incompatibility between parenthood and marijuana use, but does not\nfind statistically significant interactions between parental status and marijuana use in predict-\ning union dissolution. A more recent study by Tach and Edin (2013) [21] finds that among\ncouples with children, problematic drinking or drug use (i.e., that which interferes with work\nor relationships) by mothers (but not fathers) is associated with higher likelihood of future\nunion dissolution, but only among married couples.\nThe prevalence of cohabiting relationships has risen dramatically over the past four decades\n[22], and almost one-quarter of children are now born to unmarried cohabiting couples [23].\nGiven the importance of family stability to child wellbeing (e.g. [24,25]), it is particularly\nimportant to understand whether risky health behaviors are associated with union stability\namong parents. Relatively little research has examined whether the associations between risky\nhealth behaviors and union stability are similar for married and cohabiting couples, and to our\nknowledge, no study has explicitly analyzed how the associations of specific health behaviors\nwith union dissolution differ between married and cohabiting couples with young children.\nAlthough marriage and cohabitation are both sexual co-residential relationships, there are\nstill notable differences between the two union types in the United States. These include differ-\nences in the legal rights and obligations of the partners, social and financial support from kin\ntionally, cohabiting parents separate at a much higher rate than married parents [21]. These\ndifferences may alter the associations between risky health behaviors and union stability.\nIn this article, we examine how health behaviors are associated with union dissolution for\nmarried and cohabiting couples with children. Using nine years of data from the Fragile Fami-\nlies and Child Wellbeing Study, a study of parents with children born in 1999 and 2000 who\nlive in urban areas in the United States, we examine the association between union stability\nand two health behaviors: smoking and binge drinking. In contrast to earlier research on this\ntopic using data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study [21,32], we examine spe-\ncific measures of cigarette use and binge drinking among mothers and fathers. We investigate\nthree questions: 1) Are risky health behaviors (smoking and binge drinking) associated with\n(future) union dissolution? 2) Do the associations of these health behaviors with union dissolu-\ntion differ between married and cohabiting couples? 3) Do the associations between these\nhealth behaviors and union dissolution differ by the gender of the partner engaging in the\nbehavior?\nOn the one hand, given the stronger norms for men's and women's behavior within the\ninstitution of marriage, we might expect risky health behaviors to be more predictive of union\ndissolution among married couples. Tach and Edin's (2013) [21] research, for example, sug-\ngests that mothers' drinking or drug problems are predictive of union dissolution among\nmarried couples, but not unmarried couples (in their analysis, this category included both\ncohabiting and dating couples). On the other hand, cohabiting unions are more likely to dis-\nsolve than marriages, so to the extent that a risky health behavior produces strain within cou-\nples, we might expect this behavior to be more predictive of dissolution among cohabiting\nunions.\nHealth behaviors and union dissolution among parents of young children\nOur expectations regarding gender differences in the associations between risky health\nbehaviors and union dissolution are more one-sided. Given gendered norms of parenting\nbehavior, and the incompatibility of risky health behaviors with supervising children, we\nexpect that mothers' risky health behaviors will be more predictive of union dissolution than\nsimilar behavior by fathers.\nWe do not hold a priori expectations regarding whether binge drinking or smoking will be\nmore predictive of union dissolution. Both activities can incur a financial cost, which varies\naccording to frequency of engaging in the health behavior. Binge drinking could more severely\nlimit a parent's ability to supervise or transport children to school, activities, etc. Smoking,\nhowever, could impact children's health via second-hand smoke exposure [33], potentially\ninterfering with expectations about good parenting.\nThus, the overall aim of this research is to analyze whether associations between health\nbehaviors and union dissolution differ by marital status, but we also explore differences by\ngender and the specific health behavior examined. We achieve this objective by using discrete\ntime hazard models to examine risk of union dissolution among a sample of parents with\nyoung children in U.S. urban areas. Our findings demonstrate the importance of considering\nmarital status, gender, and disaggregated health behavior measures in research connecting\nhealth behavior to union dissolution.\nData and methods\nData\nThis analysis was deemed exempt by the IRB at the authors' university as it uses publicly avail-\nable data. Our data come from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, a birth cohort\nThe Fragile Families sample contains a larger number of cohabiting couples than is available\nin many other datasets, as the study oversampled unmarried births. More details about the\nsampling methodology are available in [34]. Readers should note that although these data are\nnot representative of the entire U.S. population, they are potentially informative regarding a\nsubstantial segment of it; in the year 2000, 22% of all U.S. births and 29% of non-marital births\nwere in urban areas [35].\nAnother exceptional feature of the Fragile Families study is that both mothers and fathers\nwere interviewed, even if the parents were unmarried. (There are no mothers who report a\nsame-sex partner at the baseline wave of the study.) Thus, these data include a much larger\nsample of cohabiting couples than most datasets with health information for both partners.\nThe baseline interviews were conducted shortly after the child's birth (usually while the mother\nand infant were still in the hospital), and subsequent interviews were conducted 1 year, 3\nyears, 5 years, and 9 years later.\nBecause the same health behavior questions were not asked of both parents at the baseline\ninterview, we define the start of our observation window as the 1-year interview. Additionally,\nthe mothers' baseline survey asked about health behaviors during pregnancy, and associations\nbetween health behaviors during pregnancy (when mothers' health behaviors may impact the\nfetus) and union dissolution might differ from the associations at other points in the life course.\nBecause the start of our observation period is one year after the baseline interview, couples\nwhose unions dissolved by their child's first birthday are not included in our main sample. Of\nthe 4,898 families who participated in the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing study, 2,997\nincluded couples in a residential union at the 1-year interview or, if they did not participate in\nthe 1-year interview, in a residential union at baseline. Of these families, our analytic sample\nincludes couples in which both partners participated in the 1-year interview (n = 2,348). We use\nHealth behaviors and union dissolution among parents of young children\nmultiple imputation techniques (with twenty iterations) to address missing data on predictor\nand covariate variables. Of our sample, 88.37% of couples had one or no predictor or control\nvariables with missing data. Most variables included in our analysis had relatively few missing\ncases. Of the health behavior variables, all variables had 5 or fewer cases with missing values.\nVariables. We measure marital status using a dichotomous indicator of whether the cou-\nple is married or in an unmarried, cohabiting union at the 1-year interview. Our outcome\nmeasure is an indicator that the couple has separated between survey waves (i.e. between the 1\nyear and 3 year survey, between the 3 year and 5 year survey, or between the 5 and 9 year sur-\nvey). We use mothers' reports when available and supplement with fathers' reports if the\nmother did not participate in the interview wave.\nWe examine two health behaviors, each measured for both members of the couple at the\n1-year interview when the child was approximately one year old. These behaviors are 1)\nwhether the respondent reported smoking cigarettes in the previous month (a dichotomous\nvariable); and 2) whether the respondent reports one or more days in the previous month on\nwhich they drank five or more alcoholic beverages (a dichotomous variable). We distinguish\nbetween indicators of mothers' and fathers' health behaviors. Unfortunately, questions about\nbinge drinking in later survey years are not directly comparable to the 1-year measure. Smok-\ning measures are more comparable across waves, but, because of a survey implementation\nerror, are not available at the 3-year interview for most parents. Given this limitation and the\nfact that less than 15% of mothers and fathers change smoking behavior between the 1-year\nand 5-year interviews, we use only the 1-year interview measures in our analysis.\nFor smoking, we construct a four-category smoking variable denoting the combination of\npaternal and maternal smoking behavior at the 1-year interview. The categories include: nei-\nther parent smokes, mother smokes only, father smokes only, and both parents smoke. (Mater-\nnal binge drinking is too rare to include the parallel measure for parental binge drinking in the\nanalysis.)\nThe full set of control variables includes variables previously found to be associated with\nunion dissolution (e.g. [11,21]). Mother's characteristics include age (measured using five cate-\ngories), race/ethnicity (with variables indicating whether she is non-Hispanic white, non-His-\npanic black, Hispanic, or other), mother's education (with variables indicating whether she has\nless than a high school degree, high school, some college, or a college degree or more), her\nchildhood family structure (with a variable indicating whether she lived with both parents at\nage 15), and whether she was previously married (an indicator variable). Father's characteris-\ntics include measures of his involvement with the criminal justice system (an indicator of\nwhether he has a criminal record), his current or previous military enlistment (a variable indi-\ncating military service), recent unemployment (measured with an indicator of whether he was\nnot working for three or more weeks in the year before the birth), and whether he was previ-\nously married (an indicator variable).\nCouple-level characteristics include: the age difference between the mother and father;\nwhether the mother and father are of the same race/ethnicity (a variable indicating if they are\nhomogamous); whether either or both parents are immigrants (an indicator variable); whether\nthe mother has children with a previous partner (an indicator variable); whether the father has\nchildren with a previous partner (an indicator variable); whether they have other shared chil-\ndren together (an indicator variable); whether the couple considered abortion (coded yes if the\nmother says that she considered it or the father suggested it); and whether the mother reports\nthat there was domestic violence in the relationship prior to the child's birth (an indicator\nvariable).\nControls for additional family characteristics include the following, operationalized as\ndichotomous variables: whether the couple's infant has a serious health problem or disability,\nHealth behaviors and union dissolution among parents of young children\nwhether the couple owns their home, whether their income in the year between their child's\nbirth and the 1-year interview was below the federal poverty level, and whether both members\nof the couple attend religious services weekly. Additionally, we include two variables for union\nduration at the time of the child's birth: a variable indicating that the couple had lived together\none year or less, and an indicator variable for whether they had lived together for five or more\nyears (with the reference category being couples who had lived together more than one year\nbut less than five years at the time of the birth).\nAnalysis\nWe use discrete time hazard models to analyze the association between health behaviors (as\nreported at the 1-year interview) and risk of union dissolution. The event outcome we model\nis union dissolution, defined as a married or cohabiting couple ceasing to live together. We\nassess this outcome at three points in time: the 3-year interview, the 5-year interview, and\n9-year interview. Our unit of analysis is the couple, and each couple contributes an observation\nto our sample for each period at which they are at risk of separating, leading to a total of 5,811\nobservations. Couples in which a partner dies are treated as censored at the first wave that the\ndeath is reported, and are not included in the analysis at later waves. For couples in which nei-\nther partner completed an interview at a particular wave, we treat relationship status as cen-\nsored for that particular wave and do not follow the couple at later waves.\nOur modeling strategy is similar to that of Tach and Edin [21], and our first model, Model\n1, can be represented using the following equation:\nlog\nP\nit\nit\n!\n\u00bc b\n\u00f0Period\u00de\nit\n\u00fe b\n\u00f0Married\u00de\ni\n\u00feb\n\u00f0Married X Period\u00de\nit\n\u00fe b\n\u00f0Smoking\u00de\ni\n\u00fe b\n\u00f0Drinking\u00de\ni\n\u00fe \nit\nIn this model, Pit\nrepresents the probability of union dissolution for couple i during discrete\ntime period t, conditional on the couple being at risk of union dissolution during this period\n[21]. In this model specification, Period is a categorical variable that indicates to which of the\nthree discrete measurement periods (between the 1-year and 3-year surveys, between the\n3-year and 5-year surveys, or between the 5-year and 9-year surveys) couple i belongs at wave\nt. We do not include an intercept term in these regression models, so no one time period is\ntreated as the reference period. Rather, the coefficient for each period represents the log odds\nof dissolution during that period when controlling for the other variables in the model. Marital\nstatus, parental smoking, and parental binge drinking do not vary within couples over time, as\nthey are all measured at the 1-year interview. The 2\ncoefficient represents the difference in log\nodds of dissolution between married and cohabiting couples for the period between the 1-year\nand 3-year surveys. 3\ncaptures interactions between marital status and period, demonstrating\nhow differences in log odds of dissolution between married and cohabiting couples change\nover time. Associations of parental smoking variables with log odds of dissolution are captured\n, and associations of parental binge drinking variables with dissolution are represented by\n.\nIn the second model specification (Model 2), we add interactions between the health behav-\nior variables and marital status. In Model 3, we add the full set of control characteristics. (We\nchecked for evidence of multi-collinearity among the control variables; we find no indication\nof such a problem.)\nTo aid interpretation of the substantive meaning of key coefficients, we calculate predicted\nprobabilities of union dissolution. These probabilities are calculated for a couple with the refer-\nence values for the control characteristics (e.g., non-Hispanic white mother with a high school\nHealth behaviors and union dissolution among parents of young children\ndegree), except for the following: the mother lived with both parents in childhood, the parents\nare of the same race and ethnicity, and the age difference between parents is two years.\nResults\nThere are substantial differences in the demographic characteristics and resources of cohabit-\ning and married couples, as well as in their risk factors for separation (see S1 Table). Table 1\nshows rates of separation by relationship type. More than half of cohabiting couples split up\nduring the observation window compared with approximately one-quarter of married couples.\nThis higher rate of union dissolution among cohabiting couples is not unique to our sample;\nnational data also show short union durations for cohabitors [36].\nNotably, health behaviors differ by gender and relationship type. Almost one-third of\ncohabiting mothers and one-half of cohabiting fathers reported smoking compared to approx-\nimately 15% of married mothers and one-quarter of married fathers. Binge drinking is rare\namong mothers, but is more common among fathers.\nThe results in Table 2 show how binge drinking and smoking associate with union dissolu-\ntion. In Model 1, couples in which only the mother smokes, only the father smokes, or both\nparents smoke have higher odds of union dissolution, on average, than couples in which nei-\nther parent smokes. With regard to binge drinking, Model 1 shows no association between\nmaternal or paternal binge drinking and union dissolution.\nWhen we add interactions between parental health behavior variables and marital status in\nModel 2, the coefficients for maternal smoking (only), paternal smoking (only), and both\nparents smoking remain statistically significant. Interactions of marital status with paternal\nsmoking (only) and both parents smoking are statistically significant. We do not find statisti-\ncally significant interactions between marital status and paternal or maternal binge drinking.\nIn Table 3, we show the results for Model 3, which includes the full set of control covariates.\nAs in Models 1 and 2, Model 3 shows no associations between binge drinking and union disso-\nlution for either cohabiting or married parents. With regard to smoking, the main coefficients\nTable 1.

However, paternal smoking\ncontinues to interact with marital status (OR = 1.64, p < .05). The predicted probability of\nunion dissolution between the 1 and 3 year interviews for married couples with the reference\ncharacteristics is .10 for couples in which the father (only) smokes compared with .05 for cou-\nples in which neither parent smokes. In Model 3, the main coefficient for both parents smok-\ning maintains statistical significance (OR = 1.38, p < .05), but notably, the interaction of both\nparents smoking with marital status is not statistically significant. This shows that both parents\nsmoking is equally predictive of union dissolution for married and cohabiting couples. For a\ncohabiting reference couple in which neither parent smokes, the probability of union dissolu-\ntion between the 1-year and 3-year interviews is .16; for a couple with the same characteristics,\nthis probability increases to .20 if both parents smoke.\nSupplementary analyses and robustness checks\nRelationship quality may mediate the associations between health behaviors and union disso-\nlution. To investigate this, we check whether the inclusion of a variable for poor relationship\nquality at the child's birth (based on mother's responses to items that comprise a supportive-\nness scale) alters our findings about the associations between health behaviors and union dis-\nsolution; it does not.\nTable 2.

We check whether excluding the variable\nindicating a child health problem from our models modifies our main findings; it does not.\nMoreover, excluding couples who have a child with a health problem from the analysis also\ndoes not change our main findings.\nIn alternative model specifications, we include measures of each parent's self-rated health\nand whether the parent exhibits high levels of (untreated) depressive symptoms using the\nshortened form of the CES-D checklist. Inclusion of these variables does not meaningfully\nchange the associations between health behaviors and union dissolution. This suggests that the\nstatistically significant associations we find between smoking and union dissolution are not\nspurious relationships caused by associations of self-rated health or depression with either the\nmain predictors (smoking and binge drinking) or outcome variable (union dissolution). Inter-\nestingly, these results also suggest that self-rated health and depressive symptoms do not medi-\nate the associations we find between smoking and union dissolution.\nThe beginning of our observation period is the 1-year interview, and some unions dissolved\nbetween the child's birth and the 1-year interviews. To explore the selectivity of our sample, we\nexamine the distribution of baseline health behaviors among all couples married or cohabiting\nat the child's birth, disaggregated by whether the couple is included in our sample. The health\nbehavior measures available at the baseline interview are not directly comparable to the mea-\nsures we use in our main analysis, but provide information about possible selection. The\nresults of this analysis are presented in S2 Table, and they provide some evidence of selection\ninto our analytic sample on maternal and paternal smoking behavior. Among married couples,\nthose in our sample are less likely to include mothers that smoked during pregnancy or fathers\nthat smoked in the three months prior to the baseline interview. Given that couples in which\nmothers or fathers smoked are more likely to select out of our sample, it is possible that our\nmain findings underestimate the association of smoking behaviors with union dissolution.\nTable 3. (Continued)\nOR  s.e. P > |t|\nSource: Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (n = 2348)\nNote: Statistical significance levels are denoted as follows:\nHealth behaviors and union dissolution among parents of young children\nIn an additional supplemental analysis, we run separate models for married and cohabiting\ncouples; we do this because of evidence that the predictors of union dissolution are different\nfor cohabiting and marital unions [21,37]. Our conclusions from these analyses parallel those\nfrom the models that include marital status interactions with health behaviors.\nWe also check whether our results are robust to using the couple's relationship status at the\nchild's birth instead of at the start of our observation period (the 1-year interview). Consistent\nwith our main analyses, findings from the Model 3 specification of this set of analyses show\nthat couples in which both parents smoke and married couples in which the father (only)\nsmokes have increased odds of union dissolution. In contrast to our main analyses (which use\nmarital status at 1 year), this analysis also shows a statistically significant interaction term\nbetween maternal smoking and marital status (OR = 2.00, p < .05). This suggests that married\ncouples in which the mother smokes have increased odds of union dissolution, but the same\nassociation does not hold for cohabiting mothers who smoke.\nFinally, we check whether associations between health behaviors and union dissolution\ndiffer between couples cohabiting at the 1-year interview that later marry (n = 327) and cohab-\niting couples that do not marry during our observation period. Among couples that are cohab-\niting at the 1-year interview, we do not find statistically significant interactions of marrying in\nsubsequent years with maternal smoking, paternal smoking, or paternal binge drinking. We\nmay be underpowered to detect such interactions if they are small in magnitude. (Because of\nthe small number of mothers who binge drink, we are unable to explore interactions between\nmarrying and maternal binge drinking.)\nDiscussion\nRisky health behaviors might negatively affect individuals' well-being and decrease the well-\nbeing of their partners and their children. In this paper, we investigate whether smoking or\nbinge drinking among urban couples with a young child are associated with higher risk of\nfuture union dissolution. We expected that these health behaviors would be associated with an\nincreased risk of union dissolution, as they might interfere with an individual's ability to be a\ngood partner or parent, and might incur substantial financial costs. We also posited that a\n\"mismatch\" between partners in risky health behaviors might cause conflict or strain that\nwould lead to increased risk of dissolution. Previous research and theory suggest that the asso-\nciations of these health behaviors with union dissolution might vary by the marital status of\nthe couple and the gender of the partner engaging in the behavior.\nIn our analysis, we find that couples in which both parents smoke have an increased risk of\nunion dissolution, and this increased risk does not differ by marital status. This finding is\ninconsistent with what we would expect if the \"mismatch\" hypothesis fully held. Additionally,\nthis finding demonstrates the importance of considering dyadic pairings of health behaviors\nwhen predicting union dissolution, as opposed to examining each partner's health behaviors\nin isolation from the other partner.\nWe also find evidence suggestive of gender differences in the relationships between smok-\ning, marital status, and union dissolution. Notably, we do not find evidence in support of our\nexpectation regarding the direction of gender differences; maternal smoking was not more\npredictive of union dissolution than paternal smoking. Instead, we find that married couples\nin which only the father smokes have an increased risk of union dissolution; however, the asso-\nciation between paternal smoking and dissolution risk does not hold for cohabiting couples.\nThe fact that a \"mismatch\" in parental smoking behavior is predictive of dissolution only\namong married couples and only when the smoking parent is the father suggests that the\nHealth behaviors and union dissolution among parents of young children\nmechanism linking paternal smoking to union dissolution might not be a \"mismatch\" per se,\nbut rather gendered family dynamics surrounding health behaviors.\nOne potential explanation for our finding that married fathers' smoking is particularly\npredictive of union dissolution relates to partner social control of health behaviors. Prior\nresearch suggests that for men, being married is associated with a higher frequency of receiving\nhealth behavior social control from others [9]. Married men are also more likely than married\nwomen to report their partner (or ex-partner) as the person that most frequently performs\nsuch social control in their life [9]. If attempts at socially controlling a partner's risky health\nbehaviors are associated with relationship discord and union instability, our pattern of find-\nings would be consistent with the gendered patterns of social control documented by previous\nresearch. Future research might examine whether cohabiting and married couples differ in\ngendered efforts to socially control health behavior, whether these efforts are more likely\namong couples in which only one partner engages in a particular risky health behavior, and\nhow such efforts impact relationship quality.\nWe find no evidence that binge drinking is associated with union dissolution for either\nmarried or cohabiting parents. However, given the small number of mothers who binge drink\nin our sample, it is possible that our analysis is underpowered to detect associations among\nthis group.\nIn further analyses, we explored possible mechanisms linking health behaviors to union dis-\nsolution, including relationship quality, self-rated health, and depression. We did not find any\nevidence that these account for the associations between smoking and union dissolution.\nFuture research should investigate whether the association of smoking with union dissolution\nis spurious and generated by correlation with factors not captured by the Fragile Families\nStudy, such as measures of personality dimensions or stress, that are associated with marital\nOur analysis focuses on parents who live in urban areas. Parents in U.S. cities are more\nracially diverse than parents not residing in cities. Cohabiting and married couples in urban\nareas may also differ from their less urban or rural counterparts on non-demographic charac-\nteristics. Thus, findings based on this sample may not generalize to the population of all\nparents in the U.S. This limitation is compensated for by the availability of health behavior\ninformation from both partners in the Fragile Families data, which is not typical for studies in\nthis field [39]. Additionally, these data contain a larger number of cohabiting couples (over\n1,000) than what most nationally representative datasets include.\nIn conclusion, our findings make two important contributions to the existing scholarly lit-\nerature. First, consistent with previous research, we find that certain risky health behaviors are\nassociated with romantic union dissolution. Like previous research, we find a somewhat com-\nplicated pattern of associations, with differences by the specific behavior examined (i.e., smok-\ning versus binge drinking), by the gender of the partner engaging in the behavior, and by the\nmarital status of the couple. Future research might fruitfully examine the precise mechanisms\nexplaining why these associations differ across population subgroups. Second, our finding of\ndifferences in the association between smoking and dissolution by marital status adds to the\ngrowing body of research continuing to find differences in union dynamics between married\nand cohabiting couples, suggesting that marriage and cohabitation are still distinct family\nforms in the United States.\nSupporting information\nS1 Table.
