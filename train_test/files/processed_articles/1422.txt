Newly acquired T. gondii infec-\ntion in a pregnant woman can be transmitted to the fetus\nand may cause mental retardation, blindness, epilepsy, and\ndeath. T. gondii can also cause severe encephalitis via acute\ninfection or reactivation of latent infection among immune-\nsuppressed persons, including those with acquired immuno-\ndeficiency syndrome, those with immunosuppressive can-\ncer, and transplant recipients on immunosuppressive drugs.\nToxoplasmosis is the most frequent severe neurologic\ninfection among persons with acquired immunodeficiency\nsyndrome (1). However, adults with normal immune func-\ntion are usually asymptomatic or have symptoms such as\nfever, malaise, and lymphadenopathy that resolve sponta-\nneously. Estimates of the incidence of congenital infection\nyear (2), but because toxoplasmosis is not a nationally\nreportable disease, the true magnitude of disease is not\nknown. The annual economic impact of toxoplasmosis in\nthe United States is estimated to be $7.7 billion (3).\nMost T. gondii infections among humans occur in one of\nthree ways: 1) by eating raw or undercooked meat contain-\ning T. gondii tissue cysts or eating food that has been cross-\ncontaminated with raw/undercooked meat; 2) by ingesting\noocysts from soil (for example, through gardening, han-\ndling/eating unwashed vegetables, or changing a cat litter\nbox); or 3) by acquiring congenital infection through the\nplacenta. Of the estimated 750 deaths caused by toxoplas-\nmosis in the United States each year, 375 are thought to\noccur from eating raw or undercooked meat; this makes tox-\noplasmosis the third-leading cause of US foodborne death\nRecent epidemiologic studies have identified the follow-\ning risk factors for T. gondii infection: owning cats (5);\nbeing in proximity to seropositive cats in farming areas (6);\ncleaning the cat litter box (7); eating raw or undercooked\npork, mutton, lamb, beef, or mincemeat products (5\u00ad8); gar-\ndening (6); having contact with soil (8); eating raw or\nunwashed vegetables or fruits (5); eating raw vegetables\noutside the home (5); washing kitchen knives infrequently\n(7); having poor hand hygiene (5); and traveling outside of\nEurope, the United States, and Canada (8). However, own-\ning a cat was not shown to be a risk factor for T. gondii\ninfection in two studies of pregnant women (8, 9) or in a\nstudy of persons infected with human immunodeficiency\nvirus (10). Protective factors include adhering to a meat-free\ndiet (11), living at a high altitude or in an arid climate (12,\n13), and living in a climate with frequent freezing and thaw-\ning (14). Outbreaks of toxoplasmosis have been attributed to\ningestion of raw or undercooked ground beef, lamb, pork, or\nvenison (15\u00ad20); consumption of unpasteurized goat's milk\nor aerosolized soil (25).\nHigh T. gondii seroprevalence has been found in countries\n(such as France) where undercooked meat is commonly\neaten (26, 27) and in tropical areas of Latin America or sub-\nSaharan Africa where cats are abundant and the climate\nFrance, a seroprevalence of 71 percent has been found\namong pregnant women (26, 27). In Panama, seropreva-\nlence has been reported to be 13 percent by age 6 years (29)\nbeen reported to be 78 percent among pregnant women in\nIbadan, Nigeria (34), 44 percent among persons living in the\ndrier regions of Somalia (12), and 83 percent in the popula-\ntion of the South Delta in Nigeria (12). Researchers working\nin Panama (where meat was well cooked) found that there\nwas a rapid rise in seroprevalence during childhood that\nprobably reflected soil exposure to T. gondii oocysts (30).\nOn the other hand, extrapolation from a study of women of\nchildbearing age in France showed that the risk of being\ninfected with T. gondii was the same throughout life (35).\nStudies carried out in Scandinavian countries (36\u00ad38) and in\nEngland (39) have shown lower seroprevalence.\nTo our knowledge, the prevalence of T. gondii infection in\nthe general US population has not been previously reported.\nWe present here the results of T. gondii serologic testing\ndone on a representative sample of the US general popula-\ntion selected in the Third National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES III).\nNHANES III was a cross-sectional survey conducted by\nthe National Center for Health Statistics of the Centers for\nwas designed to obtain nationally representative statistics on\na variety of health measures and conditions through house-\nhold interviews, standardized physical examinations, and\ncollection of blood samples in mobile examination centers\n(40). NHANES III was based on a stratified, multistage,\nprobability cluster design from which a sample representa-\ntive of the civilian, noninstitutionalized US population aged\n2 months or older was drawn. Persons aged 60 years, chil-\ndren aged 2 months through 5 years, Mexican Americans,\nand Blacks were sampled at higher rates than other persons\nto assure an adequate sample size for these age, racial, and\nethnic groups. Detailed descriptions of the design of the sur-\nvey and the sample have been published elsewhere (40).\nSurplus sera from a representative sample of persons\naged 12 years were available for testing for antibodies to\nT. gondii. Sera were also tested for a limited number of\nchildren aged 1\u00ad5 and 6\u00ad11 years for whom sera were\navailable. Because of the limited availability of sera from\nchildren, these groups represent convenience samples\nrather than random subsets of children aged <12 years;\ntherefore, we cannot assume that they are representative of\nthe US population. Nevertheless, for completeness, we pre-\nsent the data for children aged <12 years in a figure show-\ning seroprevalence by age and sex.\nRace/ethnicity was defined by self-report as non-Hispanic\nWhite, non-Hispanic Black, or Mexican-American. Persons\nwho did not self-select into one of these three groups were\nclassified as \"other\" and were analyzed only within the total\npopulation. Multivariate analyses were conducted for per-\nsons aged 20 years or older, because some important pre-\ndictor variables (education and occupation) were only\napplicable to this age range. Age was grouped as 20\u00ad29,\ninto logistic regression models using these categories. A sep-\narate logistic regression analysis was carried out for persons\naged 12\u00ad19 years, excluding education and occupation. A\npoverty index was calculated by dividing total family\nincome by the US poverty threshold, adjusted for family\nsize. A crowding index was calculated by dividing the total\nnumber of rooms in a household (excluding bathrooms) by\nthe number of household residents; it was expressed as num-\nber of persons per room, and the variable was categorized as\nmeasured as the last year of schooling completed and was\ngrouped into four levels (no high school, some high school,\nhigh school completion, some college) for entry into all\nlogistic regression models. Residence in a central county\nwith a population of 1 million was defined as metropolitan\nresidence; residence in all other counties (including rural\nareas) was defined as nonmetropolitan residence.\nWorking in a soil-related occupation was defined by the\nlongest-held job and included farm workers, farm operators,\nfarm managers, and related agricultural occupations.\nBecause NHANES III was not specifically designed to\nstudy T. gondii seroprevalence, no other data on soil expo-\nsure variables were collected. Meat consumption was deter-\nmined from average consumption over the past month and\nincluded bacon, sausage, luncheon meat, liver and other\norgan meat, beef, pork, chicken, and turkey. Average meat\nconsumption was grouped into categories of none, 1\u00ad15\nservings per month.\nLaboratory testing\nusing the Platelia Toxo-G immunoglobulin G enzyme\nimmunoassay test (Sanofi Diagnostics Pasteur, BioRad,\nHercules, California), according to the manufacturer's\ninstructions. Results were reported in International Units\n(IU); samples with >6 IU were considered positive for T.\ngondii immunoglobulin G antibodies. Prior to initiation of the\nstudy, the Platelia Toxo-G kit was evaluated using a battery of\n90 sera (23 negative and 67 positive) with various titers in the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention's Toxoplasma\nimmunofluorescence assay\u00adimmunoglobulin G test.\nSpecificity was 100 percent; sensitivity was 95.5 percent. The\nthree specimens with discrepant results (immunofluorescence\nassay-positive, Platelia-negative) were analyzed by means of\nthe dye test (Dr. Jack Remington, Palo Alto, California) and\nToxoplasma gondii in the United States 359\nfound to be dye test-negative; thus, the sensitivity of the\nPlatelia Toxo-G kit was actually 100 percent in this group of\nspecimens.\nStatistical analysis\nAll estimates were weighted to represent the total US\npopulation and to account for oversampling and nonre-\nsponse to the household interview and physical examination\n(41, 42). Statistical analyses were conducted using\nSUDAAN, a family of statistical procedures for analysis of\ndata from complex sample surveys (43). Prevalence esti-\nmates were age-adjusted by the direct method to the 1980\nUS population when seroprevalence was compared across\npopulation subgroups.\nTo screen for possible predictors of T. gondii seroposi-\ntivity, we evaluated differences in seroprevalence without\ncorrecting for multiple comparisons, by examining the 95\npercent confidence intervals for the seroprevalence values\ngenerated by SUDAAN. We determined p values from a\ngeneral linear contrast procedure in SUDAAN, using a uni-\nvariate t statistic. Independent predictors were further\ndetermined by means of multivariate logistic regression.\nFor persons aged 20 years, modeling was conducted for\nthe combined population and for each racial/ethnic group\n(non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, and Mexican-\nAmerican). Subset analyses were conducted in persons\naged 12\u00ad19 years (all three racial/ethnic groups) and, for\nVariables that had a Satterthwaite-adjusted F statistic with\na p value  0.05 were considered significant. A reduced\nmodel containing only those cofactors that were considered\nindependent predictors of T. gondii seropositivity for at\nleast one of the three racial/ethnic groups is presented indi-\nvidually for each racial/ethnic group.\nRESULTS\ninterviewed and underwent a physical examination, and 65\npercent (n  17,658) had sera tested for T. gondii antibod-\nies. The availability of a specimen for antibody testing\namong those interviewed did not vary by age, race/ethnicity,\nsex, poverty index, educational level, crowding, or other\ncharacteristics included in our analysis (range, 77\u00ad83 per-\ncent), except that it was somewhat lower (69 percent)\namong persons aged 70 years. Previous analysis of\nNHANES III data found that no apparent bias was intro-\nduced by nonresponse (41).\nAs we noted above, the availability of sera for children\naged <12 years was limited. The availability of specimens\nfor all children under 12 with completed interviews ranged\nfrom 30 percent to 35 percent when data were stratified\naccording to all important demographic cofactors, except\nthat availability was somewhat lower among non-Hispanic\nWhites (27 percent) and higher among the foreign-born (45\npercent) and those from the northeastern United States (43\npercent).\nThe overall age-adjusted T. gondii seroprevalence for per-\npercent were seropositive for T. gondii immunoglobulin G.\nsera available for testing, and 5.2 percent were seropositive\nfor T. gondii immunoglobulin G. Because the proportion of\nchildren aged <12 years who had sera available for testing\nwas low, there is a greater potential for these estimates to be\nbiased. Regardless, these estimates will be useful \"bench-\nmarks\" with which to compare results of future studies in\nthis age group.\nThe age-adjusted seroprevalence of T. gondii was higher\nin the Northeast (29.2 percent) than in the South (22.8 per-\n0.05; table 1). Seroprevalence was similar for males and\nfemales by age group, except among persons aged 30\u00ad39\nyears, where it was somewhat higher for males (p  0.02)\n(figure 1). Age-adjusted seroprevalence did not differ signif-\nicantly by racial/ethnic group; however, seroprevalence did\nvary by race/ethnicity within specific age groups (figure 2).\nAge-adjusted seroprevalence differed significantly by educa-\ntion (in the combined population, among non-Hispanic\nWhites, and among MexicanAmericans) and by birth outside\nof the United States (all groups except non-Hispanic\nWhites). Age-adjusted seroprevalence also differed signifi-\ncantly by household crowding (combined population and\nMexican Americans), poverty (combined population and\nnon-Hispanic Whites), soil-exposed occupation (all groups\nexcept non-Hispanic Blacks), and cat ownership (Mexican\nAmericans only). Age-adjusted seroprevalence did not differ\nsignificantly by sex, residence in a metropolitan area, or con-\nsumption of meat in the past 30 days (table 1).\nIn the overall multivariate model for persons aged 20\nyears or older, T. gondii seroprevalence was significantly\nlower among Mexican Americans (compared with non-\nHispanic Whites) and among persons living in the West,\nMidwest, and South (compared with the Northeast) (table\n2). Seroprevalence was significantly higher among those in\nthe age groups 40\u00ad49 years and above, those who had not\nbeen born in the United States, those living in more crowded\nconditions (1 persons per room vs. <0.5 persons per room),\nthose with less than some college education, and those who\nworked in soil-related occupations (table 2). In the overall\nmultivariate model, seroprevalence did not vary signifi-\ncantly by sex, socioeconomic level, metropolitan area, cur-\nrent amount of meat in the diet, or cat ownership (table 2).\nThere were significant interactions between race/ethnicity\nand age, education, country of birth, occupation, cat owner-\nship, and metropolitan residence; therefore, we present\nresults from reduced models for each of the three racial/\nethnic groups that contain only those variables that were sig-\nnificant predictors of T. gondii seropositivity for at least one\nof the racial/ethnic groups (table 3). Among non-Hispanic\nWhites, four age categories, less education at all three\nlevels, birth outside of the United States, and history of\nTABLE 1.

Among non-Hispanic Blacks, significantly higher\nrisk for T. gondii seropositivity was associated with four age\ncategories, with having no education/elementary education\nor some high school education as compared with some col-\nlege, and with birth outside of the United States. In addition,\namong non-Hispanic Black persons, lower seropositivity for\nT. gondii was associated with living in a metropolitan area.\nAmong Mexican Americans, the two highest age categories,\nno education/elementary education or some high school\neducation as compared with some college, birth outside of\nthe United States, and employment in an occupation involv-\ning heavy soil exposure were associated with increased risk\nof T. gondii seropositivity. Current cat ownership was asso-\nciated with a reduced risk for T. gondii seropositivity among\nMexican Americans.\nSubset multivariate analysis was carried out for persons\naged 12\u00ad19 years, excluding the occupation and education\nvariables. In this analysis, none of the risk factors for White\nor Black persons reached statistical significance. Results for\nMexican Americans are described below.\nBecause the age curve for Mexican Americans had a dif-\nferent shape than the curve for the other two racial/ethnic\ngroups, with a flatting from ages 20\u00ad29 years through ages\n50\u00ad59 years (figure 2), we conducted a subset analysis com-\nparing the age groups 12\u00ad19 years (without education and\ngondii seropositivity risk factors might vary between these\ngroups. Among Mexican Americans aged 12\u00ad19 years, risk\nwas significantly increased only for foreign birth (relative\nMexican Americans aged 20\u00ad59 years, risk was increased\nfor some high school education compared with some college\ndecreased for cat ownership (RR  0.58, 95 percent CI:\nyear age categories were significantly associated with risk\nparison with ages 20\u00ad29 years). Among Mexican Americans\npercent CI: 1.04, 3.27) were the only two factors associated\nwith risk for T. gondii seropositivity.\nDISCUSSION\nWe found an overall age-adjusted T. gondii seropreva-\nlence of 22.5 percent, and among women of childbearing\nage we found a seroprevalence of 15.0 percent. These results\nindicate that the United States is a country with low T.\ngondii seroprevalence in comparison with other nations\nsuch as France (26, 27) and many countries in Latin\ngradual increase in seroprevalence associated with age sug-\ngests that soil exposure, which is greatest during the child-\nhood years, may not be the principal mechanism by which\npersons are exposed to T. gondii in the United States.\nTherefore, a significant proportion of toxoplasmosis in this\ncountry may be due to ingestion of raw or undercooked\ninfected meat or cross-contamination from such meat.\nHowever, we cannot rule out a cohort effect, with there\nbeing a higher risk for T. gondii infection in the past, as an\nexplanation for the age trends. Risk for T. gondii infection is\nlikely to have been higher in the past, because freezing of\nmeat was formerly less common and because improved live-\nstock rearing practices have led to a decline in toxoplasmo-\nsis (which has been documented in pork (44)).\nThese data suggest that 85 percent of women in the\nUnited States are susceptible to acute Toxoplasma infection\nduring the childbearing years, and therefore their infants are\nsusceptible to congenital toxoplasmosis. For this reason, it is\nimportant that women of childbearing age, especially preg-\nnant women, be educated about not eating raw or under-\ncooked meat and using good cat feces- and soil-related\nhygiene. Recommendations for preventing congenital toxo-\nplasmosis among pregnant women have been published (2).\nIt is also important that persons infected with human\nimmunodeficiency virus and other immunosuppressed indi-\nviduals be made aware of toxoplasmosis prevention guide-\nlines. Recommendations for prevention of toxoplasmosis\namong persons with human immunodeficiency virus have\nalso been published (45).\nexamined among military recruits, with results of 14.4 per-\nTABLE 2.

This is consistent with the previ-\nous studies, although different types of serologic tests were\nused for each of these studies.\nWe found the lowest T. gondii seropositivity among per-\nsons residing in the western region of the United States. This\nfinding is consistent with the studies of military recruits (46,\n47) and with the lower seropositivity previously found in\nwestern cities (48). Previous studies have found a lower\nincidence of T. gondii in hot, dry climates and at high alti-\ntudes (12, 13). Although local rainfall varies, the western\nregion of the United States is generally drier than the East,\nand it has many areas with higher altitudes (49). Therefore,\nthe climatic and topographic characteristics of the West may\nexplain the lower T. gondii seroprevalence found there. We\ndo not know why the Northeast had the highest seropreva-\nlence in our population; it may be a consequence of food\npreparation and eating practices. Regardless of the overall\nseroprevalence for a region, there is likely to be wide varia-\ntion within regions. However, the NHANES III sample was\nnot designed to obtain estimates for geographic areas\nsmaller than the four major regions of the United States.\nLower levels of education were associated with an\nincreased risk for toxoplasmosis in the overall and race/\nethnicity-specific logistic regression models. Lower levels\nof education are associated with lower socioeconomic status\nand may be related to employment in jobs with greater soil\nexposure. In our analysis, soil-related occupations were also\nindependently associated with T. gondii seropositivity\namong non-Hispanic Whites and Mexican Americans (table\n3). There is some preliminary evidence from a population-\nbased survey done in seven states indicating that persons\nwith less education are not more likely to eat undercooked\nhamburger, steak, roast, or pork (50). However, this same\nsurvey found that persons with less education may be less\nlikely to wash cutting boards with soap or bleach after cut-\nting raw meat.\nIn the overall multivariate analysis, the risk for T. gondii\nseropositivity was lower among Mexican Americans (table\n2). In the race/ethnicity-specific analysis, risk for T. gondii\nTABLE 3.

We do not know why risk was not increased in\nthese age groups for Mexican Americans.\nIt is also notable that among Mexican Americans (and no\nother group), current cat ownership was associated with\nreduced risk for T. gondii seropositivity. Although in most\nprevious studies cat ownership has been associated with\neither increased risk for toxoplasmosis/T. gondii seroposi-\ntivity or no change in risk, one previous study found that\npossession of cats decreased the risk for seropositivity (51).\nIn our overall multivariate results, current cat ownership did\nnot significantly change the risk for T. gondii seropositivity.\nThere are several possible reasons for this finding. The\nNHANES III interview only inquired about current owner-\nship of cats. Persons who did not own cats at the time of the\ninterview may have owned them in the past. In addition, risk\nof T. gondii infection in humans derives from exposure to\nthe feces of a cat that is shedding oocysts. Cats generally\nshed oocysts for only a few weeks during their lives. Cats\nthat are kept indoors, do not hunt, and are not fed raw meat\nare not likely to acquire T. gondii infection and therefore\npose little risk to humans. In addition, neighborhood or feral\ncats that defecate in gardens or sandboxes may pose the\ngreatest risk of T. gondii infection for some people, regard-\nless of whether they own a cat.\nHigher seroprevalence of T. gondii infection was found\namong foreign-born persons in all three major racial/ethnic\ngroups in multivariate analysis. Reasons for high T. gondii\nseroprevalence vary in different countries and are related to\nthe amount of T. gondii in meat, food-preparation and eating\nhabits, and exposure to soil and cat feces. We did not have a\nsufficient number of cases to examine risk associated with\nbirth in individual countries or regions outside of the United\nStates. It is notable that in London, Gilbert et al. (52) found\na higher incidence of acute symptomatic Toxoplasma cho-\nrioretinitis among Blacks born in West Africa than among\npeople born in Britain.\nMeat consumption in the past 30 days was also not a sig-\nnificant predictor for T. gondii seropositivity in our analysis.\nHowever, very few persons in our study population ate no\nmeat (n  89), so our power to examine meat consumption\nwas limited. Because NHANES III was not designed as a\nstudy of T. gondii seroprevalence, there were no questions\nasked in the survey about how thoroughly meat was cooked.\nIn addition, the NHANES III questionnaire only inquired\nabout meat consumption within the 30 days prior to the\ninterview, not about meat consumption prior to that time.\nResidence in a metropolitan area with less than 1 million\npersons was significantly associated with T. gondii seropos-\nitivity only among non-Hispanic Blacks (table 3). We\nattempted to examine seropositivity further in persons from\nber of strata and primary sampling units in the NHANES III\nsample limited our power to detect differences associated\nwith smaller metropolitan areas or with rural residence. One\nprevious study showed higher T. gondii seropositivity\namong persons who grew up in rural areas in the United\nStates (47), but another study failed to show a difference\nbetween rural and urban seroprevalence (46). NHANES III\nonly collected information about current residence, not\nabout past living locations.\nThere are a number of limitations involved in using data\nfrom the NHANES III survey to evaluate T. gondii sero-\nprevalence. NHANES III was designed to collect informa-\ntion on a wide variety of risk factors for chronic diseases; it\nwas not designed to evaluate T. gondii risk factors and sero-\nprevalence. Surplus serum samples were examined for T.\ngondii antibodies. As we noted above, only a limited num-\nber of surplus samples were available for children under age\n12, so it cannot be assumed that these samples are represen-\ntative of the US population. NHANES III data were also\nlimited in terms of the information provided about soil\nexposure and pet exposure. It would be helpful for T. gondii-\nrelated studies if future NHANES surveys contained addi-\ntional questions about cat- and soil-related risk factors.\nDespite these drawbacks, NHANES III has provided us\nwith a way to assess the prevalence of T. gondii infection\nand has enhanced our understanding of the seroepidemiol-\nogy of this organism in the United States. We plan to con-\ntinue monitoring T. gondii seropositivity in future NHANES\nsurveys.\n"
