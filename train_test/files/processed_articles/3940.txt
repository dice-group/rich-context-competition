    "abstract": "Abstract\nSocial interest was Alfred Adler's most important personality trait, and it reflects one's genuine concern for the welfare of\nall individuals. Several measures of social interest are available, and the Social Interest Index (SII) is one of the most popular\nin current use. This study is the first to report the results of a confirmatory factor analysis of the SII. Using college students,\nthree models were tested in an effort to find support for the factorial validity of this scale. All analyses showed a poor fit\nbetween the theoretical model and scale items. The results paint a fairly negative picture of the factor structure of this\nimportant scale.\n",

Adler stated, \"Social inter-\nest is the main characteristic of each person and is involved\nin all his [sic] actions\" (p. 774). Social interest involves a\nsense of social feeling toward all humankind, and the\nessence of social interest is the valuing of something outside\nthe self without ulterior motives. In other words, people with\nsocial interest have an absence of self-centeredness, egocen-\ntricity, and self-absorption. Social interest is based on one's\nidentification with others and a transcendence of one's own\ninterests, resulting in a genuine concern with and striving for\ncommunity and human welfare. Adler believed that social\ninterest is manifested in the life tasks of friendship, love, and\nwork, and he also believed that mental health requires that\none successfully cope with these major and pervasive chal-\nlenges of life through social interest. Adler's theory stated\nthat social interest has important implications for personal\nadjustment as well as for the well-being of society. Social\ninterest was seen as the foundation of mental health, and, as\na corollary, many intrapersonal and interpersonal difficulties\ncould be traced to an absence of social interest and commu-\nnity feeling.\nEmpirical Support\nfor Social Interest Theory\nDecades of research has established that individuals with\nrelatively high levels of social interest, as assessed by a vari-\nety of instruments, possess common personality traits, such\nas friendliness, empathy, cooperation, tolerance, nurturance,\nand constructive independence (e.g., Crandall, 1981; Leak,\nespecially helpful review). Such individuals have also been\nfound to have higher levels of marital satisfaction (e.g.,\nMarkowski & Greenwood, 1984), faith development, and\nspiritual maturity (Leak, 1992), and fewer symptoms of neu-\nroticism, such as anxiety, hostility, and depression (cited in\nMeasurement of Social Interest\nWith the Social Interest Index (SII)\nWithin the past three decades, at least six self-report mea-\nsures of social interest have been developed. Perhaps the\nmost frequently used measure is the SII (Greever, Tseng, &\nFriedland, 1973). This instrument is divided into four sub-\nscales of eight items each, and it was designed to measure\none's level of social interest in the four Adlerian \"life tasks\"\nof friendship, love, work, and self-significance. Prior research\n(Watkins, 1994) and a recent meta-analysis (Bass, Curlette,\nKern, & McWilliams, 2002) have presented evidence sup-\nporting the criterion validity of the SII.\nDespite research indicating that the total score on the SII\nmay be a sound measure of social interest, it has received\nsome criticisms. The areas of greatest weakness seem to be\n1Creighton University, Omaha, NE, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nGary K.

Some studies have found a four-factor solution\n(Zarski, Bubenzer, & West, 1983) whereas others have\nfound a five-factor solution (Zarski, West, & Bubenzer,\n1981). Furthermore, some studies have found the existence\nof a general social interest factor (Greever et al., 1973),\nwhereas others have not (Leak, 1982). Finally, the four sub-\nscales have been plagued by low internal consistencies\nPurpose of the Present Study\nThis research focused on the SII because it is one of the most\nfrequently used measures of social interest, and many stud-\nies have found support for its criterion validity (Bass et al.,\n2002). Despite its popularity and promise, however, Leak\nproblems with the SII (reviewed above), such as conceptu-\nally and statistically flawed items (e.g., \"I enjoy music and\nliterature\" as an indicator of social feeling, and low or nega-\ntive item-total correlations, respectively) and poor factorial\nvalidity.\nHowever, there is a serious limitation to factor analytic\nstudies mentioned above: They were based on exploratory\nfactor analysis (EFA) only. The superiority of confirmatory\nfactor analysis (CFA) over EFA is widely noted (e.g.,\nthese advantages of CFA are its ability to examine correla-\ntions among factors (rather than scales), and the ability to\nestimate parameters (e.g., factor loadings), without the influ-\nence of measurement error. In addition, CFA allows for a\nmore rigorous and precise test of the structure of a scale\n(e.g., EFA allows all items to load on all factors whereas\nCFA forces items to load on only certain factors.) To date no\nassessment of the factorial validity of the SII using CFA has\nbeen attempted. This study was designed to provide more\ninformation about the factorial validity of the SII through the\nuse of CFA.\nMethod\nParticipants, Procedure, and Instrument\nage\nat a Jesuit university were recruited from Introductory,\nDevelopmental, and Personal Growth psychology classes.\nData were collected in groups of approximately 10 as part\nof a larger project on social interest, religion, and psycho-\nlogical well-being. They were awarded extra credit toward\ntheir course grade for their participation.\nitems clustered into four scales of 8 items each, each designed\nto assess the specific Adlerian \"life tasks\" of Friendship,\nSelf-Significance, Love, and Work. Respondents answered\non a 5-point Likert-type scale from strongly disagree to\nstrongly agree.\nResults\nEvaluation of the SII Using\nthe Original Theoretical Model\nInitial analyses searched for violation of CFA assumptions\n(e.g., multivariate normality). Next, a measurement model\nwas proposed based on the conceptualization of social inter-\nest that guided the development of the SII. This was Model 1,\nand it specified four factors or latent traits with 8 items per\nfactor. In other words, the model specified that social inter-\nest is manifested in four psychological domains or latent\ntraits, and those traits are assessed with 32 items or indica-\ntors from the original scale. Table 1 presents the factor load-\nings of each item on its putative latent trait.\nAn examination of the parameter estimates' critical ratios\nFour items had low standardized regression weights (s < .20;\nto .72). Two of the covariances between factors were unac-\nceptably low (p > .01), and both involved the Work factor\n(mean correlation between factors = .57). Furthermore, the\nonly factor variance to not reach acceptable significance\nwas, again, the Work factor (p > .01). Finally, the squared\nmultiple correlations (R2) between the 32 scale items or indi-\ncators and their underlying factor revealed that 11 were\nextremely low1 indicating weak linkages between the factor\nTable 2 presents fit indices for model evaluation. The\nindices selected are among the most respected in the field\n(Byrne, 2010), and they differ in terms of the information\nthey provide about model fit as well as the factors they take\ninto account in their calculation (e.g., being sensitive to the\nparsimony of the model). Several fit measures indicated a\npoor fit between the theoretical model and the observed\nparative fit index (CFI) = .68; Akaike information criterion\n(AIC) = 1,743. Root mean square error of approximation\n(RMSEA), however, had a value of .07, and that value repre-\nsents \"reasonable errors of approximation\" (Byrne, p. 80). A\nlarge number of modification indices had values above 10\nsuggesting many areas of model weakness or \"strain\" con-\ntributing to poor model-data fit.\nEvaluation of a Revised Three-Factor,\nA second model was tested after removing the largest source\nof ill-fit, the psychometrically weak Work factor and its\nitems from the model. This resulted in a 24-item, three-\nfactor model and labeled Model 2 in Table 1. Fit measures\nsuggested an improved but still poor (2, CFI, AIC) or ade-\nquate (RMSEA) fit between the model and the data. A test\nfor the difference in fit between the two models, using a test\nof the difference between chi-square values (Kline, 2005),\nfailed to establish that Model 2 was superior to Model 1,\n2 CFI and AIC values argued for the superiority of Model 2.\nAgain, weak items were found that either (a) failed to\nhave significant critical ratios for their parameter estimates,\n(b) had low standardized regression weights (s < .40), and/or\n(c) had low R2 values.\nEvaluation of a Three-Factor, 15-Item Model\nNine weak items identified in Model 2 were eliminated. The\nnew model, Model 3, generated an improved fit relative to\nModel 2 in terms of changes in CFI and AIC values but not\np > .05, or RMSEA. Even though Model 3 is a better model\nin some ways, the improvement over Model 2 is a relative\none; Model 3 still represents a poor fit in an absolute sense.\nEven after eliminating the poorest items from Model 2, the\nthree-factor, 15-item model still did not adequately repro-\nduce the empirical covariance matrix and thus has unaccept-\nable factorial validity.2\nTest of a Unidimensional Model\nIn light of the negative evidence to this point, it is possible\nthat the theoretical structure of the SII, based on various life\ntasks or factors, is fundamentally incorrect. In other words,\nit may indeed be best not to view it as a multidimensional\nscale. Thus, a one-factor, 32-indicator model was tested.\nDiscussion\nSummary of Results\nSeveral models were tested that explored the factorial valid-\nity of the SII. The examination of Model 1 (the full 32-item\nTable 1.

A copy of the SII is available from the\nauthor.\nTable 2.

Model 1 is based on the original theoretical model\nthat generated the Social Interest Index (SII) and it contained four factors\nand 32 indicators. Model 2 is the SII with the problematic Work factor\nand its 8 items removed (i.e., retaining three factors and 24 items). Model 3\ncontains three factors and 15 items (i.e., after 9 statistically weak items\nwere removed from Model 2). For CFI, a well-fitting model should have a\nvalue .95 (Byrne, 2009); for AIC and RMSEA, the smaller the values the\nbetter the fit.\n4 SAGE Open\nscale with four hypothesized latent traits) generated a severe\nchallenge to the factorial validity of the SII based on every\nstatistic of model fit used except one. Given previous chal-\nlenges to the integrity of the factor structure of the SII using\nEFA, coupled with the results presented here, I believe it\nwould be negligent to maintain faith in, and continue to use\nin research, the original four subscales of SII as measures of\nAdlerian life tasks. Especially problematic was the Work\nfactor, and it was deleted in Model 2. Again there was a poor\nfit of the model to the data. Various statistics were used as\nguidance in generating another hypothesized model to\nobtain better fit. This resulted in the best fitting model: a\nthree-factor, 15-item scale, but although better than previous\nversions, the solution remained inadequate by traditional\nImplications\nWhat can be concluded from the results of these analyses?\nI believe three conclusions are reasonable. One, researchers\nshould not include the Work subscale and its psychometri-\ncally weak items in social interest research. Second, the\nrevised Love factor (Model 3) was evaluated as a four-item\nscale, and it had unacceptably low internal consistency reli-\nability to justify its use in research.2 This leaves only two\nlatent traits as the basis for two subscales, and one of those,\nSelf-Significance, is of dubious theoretical heritage.\n(Watkins, 1994, has argued that self-significance does not\nappear in Adler's writings and seem antithetical to the nature\nof other-oriented social interest.) Third, do not be tempted to\nuse Model 3 as the foundation for a revised, shortened mea-\nsure of social interest. The third model was certainly the best\none tested, but it still did not perform well in the CFA (see\nTables 1 and 2). Researchers cannot continue to justify their\nfaith in the SII or any of its progeny that emerged here as\nmeasures of specific Adlerian life tasks. Researchers should\ninstead turn to other measures of social interest that have\nshown greater promise (cf. Bass et al., 2002).\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to\nthe research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nNotes\n1. R2 < .20. This means that less than 20% of the variance on the item\n(i.e., differences among people) could be predicted by its putative\ncausal factor of social interest, whereas more than 80% variance of\nan item could be traced to systematic and/or random measurement\nerror and not differences among people in social interest.\n2. Three brief scales were constructed from the 15 items in\nModel 3. The alphas for the abbreviated Friendship, Self-\nSignificance, and Love scales were .79, .82, and .72, respec-\ntively. A total score based on those 15 items yielded an alpha\nsample.\nReferences\nAdler, A. (1964). Social interest: A challenge to mankind. New York,\nNY: Capricorn.
