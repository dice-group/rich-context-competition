Patients were divided into those with active or\ninactive disease.\nResults: Data from 236 patients with Behc\n\u00b8et's disease (77 with active and 159 with inactive\ndisease) and 72 controls were analysed. RDW, ESR and hsCRP were significantly higher in patients\nwith Behc\n\u00b8et's disease than in controls, and in those with active disease compared with inactive\ndisease or controls. In addition, ESR and hsCRP were significantly higher in those with inactive\ndisease than controls. No correlations were found between hsCRP, ESR and RDW. No differences\nwere observed in RDW, ESR or hsCRP between patients with or without ocular or vascular\ninvolvement. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that RDW was significantly higher in\nactive disease compared with inactive disease.\nConclusions: RDW was increased in active disease compared with inactive disease. No\nrelationships were found between organ involvement and RDW. RDW may be a cost-effective,\nnovel potential parameter to evaluate disease activity in Behc\n\u00b8et's disease.\nJournal of International Medical Research\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav\nimr.sagepub.com\n1Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine,\nGaziantep University, Gaziantep, Turkey\n2Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine,\nGaziantep University, Gaziantep, Turkey\n3Department of Cardiology, Faculty of Medicine,\nGaziantep University, Gaziantep, Turkey\n4Department of Rheumatology, Faculty of Medicine,\nGaziantep University, Gaziantep, Turkey\n5Department of Biostatistics, Faculty of Medicine,\nGaziantep University, Gaziantep, Turkey\nCorresponding author:\n\u00b8\nSefika Nur Aksoy, Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of\nGaziantep, Turkey.\nEmail: snuraksoy@yahoo.com\nCreative Commons CC-BY-NC: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial\n3.0 License (http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/) which permits non-commercial use, reproduction and\ndistribution of the work without further permission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access page\n(https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).\n",

It is calculated by\ndividing the standard deviation of the\nmean cell size by the mean cell volume\nof red blood cells and multiplying by 100\nto convert to a percentage.2 An elevated\nRDW can be seen in diseases such as\nanaemia, renal dysfunction, thyroid dis-\nease, hepatic dysfunction, nutritional defi-\nciencies (iron, vitamin B12\nand folic acid),\nbone marrow dysfunction, cancer, diabetes\nmellitus and inflammatory disease.3\nStudies report that RDW was associated\nwith inflammatory indices such as\nC-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte\nsedimentation rate (ESR).4\u00ad7\nBehc\n\u00b8 et's disease is a chronic, recurrent,\nmultisystemic inflammatory disorder. It is\ncharacterized by involvement of the muco-\ncutaneous, urogenital, ocular, vascular,\nlocomotor, neurological, gastrointestinal\nand respiratory systems, and inflammatory\nattacks.8 Both ESR and CRP have been\nused to assess activity in Behc\n\u00b8 et's disease.9\nAlthough other investigational markers\nhave been identified, they are not routinely\nused in clinical practice since they are not\neasily measured and clinical values have not\nThe aim of the present study was to\ninvestigate whether RDW may have poten-\ntial as a diagnostic marker in Behc\n\u00b8 et's\ndisease by examining associations between\nRDW, organ involvement and disease\nactivity.\nPatients and methods\nPatients\nPatients with Behc\n\u00b8 et's disease were\nidentified retrospectively from the database\nof the Rheumatology Department, Faculty\nof Medicine, Gaziantep University,\nGaziantep, Turkey. The study was con-\n2013. Patients were diagnosed according to\nthe International Study Group criteria for\nBehc\n\u00b8 et's disease.12 Exclusion criteria\nincluded autoimmune disease (such as\nSjo\n\u00a8 gren's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis\nand inflammatory bowel disease), malignant\ndisease, thyroid disease, bone marrow dys-\nfunction, diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal\ndisease and liver disease. Demographic par-\nameters such as age, sex, clinical features\nand organ involvement were obtained from\npatient records. Controls consisted of\nhealthy volunteers who were recruited pro-\nspectively from members of hospital staff or\npatients' relatives. Patients and controls\nwere age- and sex-matched.\nWritten consent had been obtained from\nall patients as standard practice on admis-\nsion to hospital, covering the use of their\ndata for research purposes. All controls gave\nwritten informed consent when recruited.\nThe study protocol was approved by the\nClinical Research Ethics Committee of\nconducted according to the Declaration of\nHelsinki.\nPatients with Behc\n\u00b8 et's disease were\ndivided into those with active disease and\nthose with inactive disease, using the\nTurkish version of the simplified Behc\n\u00b8 et's\nDisease Current Activity Form\n(BDCAF).13,14 Active disease was defined\nas a BDCAF value !2. Those with active\ndisease were being treated with standard\nregimens, involving immunosuppressive and\nanti-inflammatory drugs.\nLaboratory measurements\nComplete blood count, high-sensitivity CRP\n(hsCRP) level and ESR were measured.\nBlood samples were obtained following an\novernight fast and were drawn from the\nantecubital vein for immediate analysis.\nBlood assayed for hsCRP was collected in\nstandard serum gel biochemistry tubes.\nhsCRP levels were measured using an\nimmunonephelometry assay on a Dade\nBehring Nephelometer BN II device\n(Siemens Healthcare GmbH, Erlangen,\nGermany). Blood for ESR measurement\nwas collected in citrated glass tubes; ESR\nwas measured using a traditional\nWestergren method. Blood collected in\ntubes containing ethylenediaminetetra-\nacetic acid was analysed to give a complete\nblood count, including RDW, haemoglobin,\nmean corpuscular volume (MCV), white\nblood cell count (WBC), red blood cell\ncount (RBC), lymphocytes, neutrophils,\nhaematocrit, mean corpuscular haemoglo-\nbin (MCH) and mean corpuscular haemo-\nglobin concentration (MCHC), using a\nCoulter LH 780 device (Beckman Coulter,\nMiami, FL, USA).\nStatistical analyses\nBased on the reference values of RDW for\nhealthy subjects, the minimum sample size\nrequired was determined as 54 in each group\nto demonstrate a significant difference of\n1 \u00c6 2 units between patients with Behc\n\u00b8 et's\nResults were given as n patients or\nmean \u00c6 SD. The distribution of continuous\nvariables was evaluated using the\nKolmogorov\u00adSmirnov test. Two normally\ndistributed variables were compared using\nStudent's t-test, with Mann\u00adWhitney U-test\nbeing used for non-normally distributed\nvariables. Analysis of variance and least\nsignificant difference multicomparison tests\nwere used to compare more than two nor-\nmally distributed variables, while Kruskal\u00ad\nWallis and pairwise multicomparison meth-\nods were used for non-normally distributed\nvariables. The 2-test was used for the\nanalysis of associations between categorical\nvariables. Pearson's correlation coefficient\ntest was used for correlation analysis of\nhsCRP, ESR, RBC, haemoglobin, MCV\nand MCHC against RDW. Multivariate\nlogistic regression was used to adjust for\nthe effect of other possible factors. Receiver\noperating characteristic (ROC) analysis was\nperformed to assess the ability of RDW to\ndifferentiate patients with Behc\n\u00b8 et's disease\nfrom healthy controls and active from\ninactive disease. A P-value < 0.05 was con-\nsidered to be statistically significant. All\nstatistical analyses were performed using\nIBM SPSS\u00d5 software, version 22 (IBM,\nSomers, NY, USA).\nResults\nA total of 236 patients with Behc\n\u00b8 et's disease\nmale; 34 female) were included in the study.\nOf the patients with Behc\n\u00b8 et's disease, 77 had\nactive disease and 159 had inactive disease.\nThere were no significant differences in\nterms of age and sex between the three\ngroups (Table 1). RDW, hsCRP and ESR\nwere significantly higher in patients with\nBehc\n\u00b8 et's disease than in controls (Table 1).\nWhen analysed according to disease activity,\nESR, hsCRP and RDW were significantly\nhigher in patients with active Behc\n\u00b8 et's dis-\nease than in inactive Behc\n\u00b8 et's disease or\ncontrols. In addition, those with inactive\ndisease had significantly higher ESR and\nhsCRP levels than controls (Table 1). There\nwas no significant difference in RDW\nbetween those with inactive disease and\ncontrols. A comparison of RDW values in\nthe three groups is shown in Figure 1. RBC,\nhaemoglobin, haematocrit, MCHC, MCH\nand MCV levels were significantly lower in\npatients with active disease than in those\nwith inactive disease or controls (Table 1).\nThere were no significant differences in\nneutrophil levels or WBC between patients\nwith Behc\n\u00b8 et's disease and controls (Table 1).\nA total of 235 patients with Behc\n\u00b8 et's\ndisease had mucocutaneous manifestations;\nof these, 73 also had ocular involvement, 34\nhad vascular involvement, 12 had locomotor\nsystem involvement, three had gastrointes-\ntinal system involvement and nine had\nneurological system involvement. When\nhaematological parameters were compared\nin those with or without vascular involve-\nment, WBC, neutrophils, RBC, haemoglo-\nbin, haematocrit and MCV were\nsignificantly higher in those with vascular\ninvolvement than in those without, but there\nwas no significant difference in hsCRP,\nESR, RDW, MCH, MCHC and lympho-\ncytes between these two groups (Table 2).\nThere were no significant differences in any\nof the haematological parameters measured\nbetween those with ocular involvement and\nthose without (Table 2).\nThere were moderate negative correl-\nations between RDW and haemoglobin\nTable 1.

In addition, significant increases in\nRDW, ESR and hsCRP were observed in\nthose with active disease compared with\nthose with inactive disease. Those with\ninactive disease also had significantly\nhigher ESR and hsCRP levels than controls.\nThere are very few studies evaluating the\nrelationships between these parameters in\nthe literature. In a study by Aktu\nESR, CRP and RDW were significantly\nhigher in patients with active Behc\n\u00b8 et's dis-\nease than those with inactive Behc\n\u00b8 et's dis-\nease or controls. Moreover, they found that\nESR, CRP and RDW were significantly\nhigher in patients with inactive Behc\n\u00b8 et's\ndisease compared with controls. In addition,\nVaya\n\u00b4 et al.16 reported that RDW and CRP\nwere significantly higher in patients with\nBehc\n\u00b8 et's disease than in controls. The find-\nings of both these studies are consistent with\nthe results of the present study.\nIncreased RDW values have been reported\nto be associated with disease activity in a\nnumber of inflammatory and autoimmune\ndiseases such as inflammatory bowel disease,\nrheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus ery-\nthematosus.4\u00ad7 In addition, RDW has been\nshown to be positively correlated with inflam-\nmatory indices such as CRP and ESR.17,18\nIn the present study ESR and hsCRP\nwere significantly higher in those with active\ndisease than in those with inactive disease or\ncontrols. However, no correlations were\nfound between RDW, ESR and hsCRP\nwithin each group. Vaya\nreported no correlation between RDW and\nseveral inflammatory parameters in patients\nwith inactive Behc\n\u00b8 et's disease, whereas\nAktu\n\u00a8 rk et al.15 found modest positive cor-\nrelations between ESR, CRP and RDW.\nIn the present study, increased RDW\nlevels were associated with Behc\n\u00b8 et's disease\nactivity, but the mechanism is unclear.\nElevated RDW may arise from several\nmechanisms such as chronic inflammation,\nor folate deficiencies and\noxidative stress, which may result in inef-\nfective erythropoiesis. Among these mech-\nanisms, oxidative stress and inflammation\nhave been shown to be significant determin-\nsuggested that raised levels of the cytokines\ninterleukin 1, interleukin 6 and tumour\nnecrosis factor-a in inflammatory diseases\ncan shorten the lifespan of red blood cells,\nincrease in RDW may also be caused by\noxidative damage. Several studies have\ndemonstrated an oxidative response in\npatients with Behc\n\u00b8 et's disease; as a result\nof exposure to oxidative stress, the lifespan\nof erythrocytes decreases, production of\nreticulocytes increases and the RDW\nIn the present study, significantly higher\nRDW values were seen in patients with\nactive Behc\n\u00b8 et's disease compared with\nthose with inactive disease after multivariate\nlogistic regression analysis for age, sex,\nCRP, MCV, ESR and MCHC. This differ-\nence in RDW was seen even though all the\npatients with active disease were receiving\nimmunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory\ndrugs, which are known to suppress erythro-\ncyte stem cells.25 Therefore the main factor\naffecting the increase in RDW in those with\nactive Behc\n\u00b8 et's disease is likely to be severe\ninflammation and oxidative stress resulting\nfrom disease activity.\nHaemoglobin, RBC, haematocrit,\nMCHC, MCH and MCV levels were lower\nin those with active disease compared to\nthose with inactive disease. Reductions in\nthese parameters may also be associated\nwith anaemia of chronic disease.26 Anaemia\nas a chronic disorder has been shown to\nreflect disease activity in systemic auto-\nimmune diseases, with several inflamma-\ntory cytokines being implicated in its\nThe present study is the first to examine\nthe relationship between RDW and organ\ninvolvement in Behc\n\u00b8 et's disease. There were\nno significant differences in RDW, ESR and\nhsCRP between patients with or without\nvascular or ocular involvement. In a study\non patients with scleroderma, a significantly\nhigher RDW was found in patients with\nvascular involvement compared with those\nwithout major vascular symptoms.28 In the\npresent study, WBC, neutrophils, RBC,\nhaemoglobin, haematocrit and MCV\nvalues were significantly higher in patients\nwith vascular involvement compared with\npatients without. However, all the patients\nwith vascular involvement were male, which\nmay have influenced these results. A more\neven sex distribution would allow a more\nrobust analysis of these parameters and\nvascular involvement.\nA limitation of the present study was the\ninclusion of patients with anaemia. No\ninformation was provided relating to levels\nof serum folic acid, iron or vitamin B12\n.\nDeficiency of these vitamins and minerals\nmay result in anaemia, thus affecting RDW\nlevels.\nIn conclusion, the findings of the present\nstudy suggest that RDW may be a novel\npotential marker in determining the active\nperiod of Behc\n\u00b8 et's disease. The cause of\nincreased RDW values in Behc\n\u00b8 et's disease is\nunclear. Further studies are required to\nunderstand the importance of an increased\nRDW in Behc\n\u00b8 et's disease and to clarify the\nmechanisms involved.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial, or not\nfor profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
