To test the hypothesis\nthat postmenopausal bone resorption increases blood lead levels, the authors examined cross-sectional\nassociations of bone density-related factors with blood lead levels among women aged 40\u00ad59 years from the\nThird National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988\u00ad1994). Factors related to bone turnover were\nsignificant predictors of blood lead level. Bone mineral density was significantly inversely related to blood lead\nlevels in log-linear multivariate models that adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, smoking, education, household\nincome, alcohol use, and residence (urban/rural). With menopausal status added to the model, naturally and\nsurgically menopausal women had adjusted median blood lead levels that were 25% and 30% higher,\nrespectively, than those of premenopausal women (2.0 \u00b5g/dl). Current use of hormone replacement therapy was\nassociated with significantly lower adjusted median blood lead levels (1.8 \u00b5g/dl) than past use (2.6 \u00b5g/dl) and\nnever use (2.2 \u00b5g/dl). Lead stored in bone may significantly increase blood lead levels in perimenopausal women\nbecause of postmenopausal bone mineral resorption.

While young children\nand some adults continue to be at risk from exogenous\nsources of lead exposure, new evidence suggests that some\npersons may be at risk for recurring endogenous exposure to\nlead previously accumulated over time in the skeleton (3\u00ad6).\nLike calcium, lead is a bone-seeking element. Over 90\npercent of the total burden of lead in the body resides in the\nskeleton, where it has a half-life on the order of years to\ndecades (7\u00ad10). Thus, exposure to lead over the course of a\nlifetime results in accumulation of lead in the skeletal\ncompartment (11\u00ad13) such that bone lead levels are gener-\nally higher among older persons (14). Of particular concern\nis the potential for renewed exposure to lead released from\nbone in older persons who were excessively exposed to envi-\nronmental lead, by current standards, prior to its removal\nThe human skeleton is a dynamic physiologic compart-\nment of mineral metabolism.

In response to these factors, both lead and calcium are\ndeposited in the skeleton and may act similarly (4, 21, 22).\nLead competes with calcium for transport and binding sites,\nand when calcium is released from bone, lead is also liber-\nated (23\u00ad30). Additionally, lead does not accumulate\nuniformly throughout the skeleton but is selectively taken up\nat different sites and in different types of bone (e.g., trabec-\nevents may be of particular importance to women because of\nthe changing dynamics of bone mineral metabolism related\nto events such as pregnancy, lactation, and menopause (33,\n34). Over her lifetime, a woman loses up to 50 percent of\npercent of this bone loss occurs in the early postmenopausal\nyears (35\u00ad39).

A cross-sectional study\nconducted in the early 1990s found an inverse relation\nbetween blood lead levels and bone-related factors,\nincluding menopause (63). Another study also identified\nmenopausal status as an independent predictor of blood lead\nlevels in a random sample of Scandinavian women (53).\nHowever, these studies were carried out at a time when envi-\nronmental exposures and population blood lead levels were\nmuch higher than they are at present. More recently, among\nperimenopausal women from the Nurses' Health Study who\nwere not using HRT, investigators found higher blood lead\nlevels and observed that bone lead was more strongly associ-\nated with blood lead in comparison with current HRT users\n(64). In a study of women from the Third National Health\nand Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), Nash et\nal. (58) reported the association between blood lead and dia-\nstolic hypertension to be most pronounced in postmeno-\npausal women. A recent study of women in Mexico City,\nMexico, where environmental exposure to lead is high,\nfound no association between blood lead and bone mineral\ndensity (BMD) (65). However, to our knowledge, the associ-\nation has never been examined in the context of lower envi-\nronmental lead exposures, where the contribution of\nendogenous lead to blood lead may be more relevant.\nThe goal of this investigation was to test whether BMD\nand other factors related to bone status (menopausal status,\ntime since menopause, and use of HRT) are associated with\nblood lead levels in ways consistent with the hypothesis that\npostmenopausal bone density loss results in increased\nendogenous lead exposure in the context of low exogenous\nexposure to lead.\nStudy population\nThe study population included adult females from\nNHANES III. NHANES III comprised a cross-sectional\npopulation sample that was obtained through a complex\nsurvey design and was intended to be representative of the\nUS civilian, noninstitutionalized population. Over a 6-year\nsurvey interview and an in-depth physical examination with\nlaboratory tests. Other details on the survey design have been\npublished by the National Center for Health Statistics (66).\nThe present investigation focused on the 2,575 women\naged 40\u00ad59 years who took part in the NHANES III survey\ninterview. From this group, women were excluded for the\nfollowing reasons: 212 did not undergo physical examina-\ntion or blood testing; 77 did not have information on blood\nlead levels; 181 had bone density measurements that were\nconsidered unreliable by the technicians performing the\ndual-energy x-ray absorptiometry; and 70 had an indetermi-\nnate menopausal status because of missing information. A\nfurther 121 women of ethnicities other than non-Hispanic\nBlack, non-Hispanic White, and Mexican-American were\nexcluded because of low numbers in any single category of\nself-reported ethnicity. The remaining 1,914 women consti-\ntuted the sample used in the present analyses.\nDefinitions\nBlood lead. Blood samples were obtained by venipunc-\nture from all adult participants during the physical examina-\ntion. Blood lead was measured by graphite furnace atomic\nabsorption spectrophotometry at the laboratories of the\nCenter for Environmental Health, Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention (Atlanta, Georgia). The assay detec-\ntion limit was 1.0 \u00b5g/dl. Each sample analysis was\nperformed in duplicate, and the average of both measure-\nments was used in these analyses. Persons with blood lead\nlevels less than 1.0 \u00b5g/dl (n = 201) were assigned a value of\n0.5 \u00b5g/dl for consistency with previous analyses of\nNHANES III data by other investigators (2).\nCovariates. Information on race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic\nBlack, non-Hispanic White, or Mexican-American), age\n(years), smoking (current, former, or never), household\nincome, and education was obtained from the household\ninterview. The poverty income ratio, a ratio of household\nincome to the federal poverty-level income (for a given\nfamily size, adjusted to the poverty threshold for the year of\nthe interview), was used to create a three-level household\nBMD-related Predictors of Blood Lead Level in Women 903\nincome variable. A participant was assigned a household\nincome level above the poverty line if the poverty income\nratio was greater than 1 and a household income level at or\nbelow the poverty line if the poverty income ratio was less\nthan or equal to 1; data were considered missing if the survey\nparticipant did not report household income. A four-level\neducation variable was created on the basis of the number of\nyears of education reported by the survey participant: less\nthan high school (<12 years), completion of high school (12\nyears), some college (>12\u00ad<16 years), and completion of\ncollege or more (16 years). A dichotomous variable based\non area of residence (urban/rural) was also included.\nInformation on participants' alcohol use (frequency and\namount consumed per week) was obtained using the exami-\nnation-associated interview questionnaire. A four-level cate-\ngorical variable for weekly alcohol intake was created, with\nthe following levels: none; <1 drink per week; 1\u00ad<3 drinks\nper week; and 3 drinks per week.\nMenopausal status. A variable was created to categorize\nwomen as premenopausal (ovarian function intact), surgi-\ncally menopausal (both ovaries removed surgically before\nTABLE 1.

Women were classified as current users, past\nusers, or never users of HRT on the basis of self-reported\ndata from the examination questionnaire. Duration of HRT\nuse in years was also ascertained by self-report at the time of\nthe examination.\nTime since menopause. Information on time since\nmenopause was estimated as the difference in years between\nage at the time of the NHANES interview and self-reported\nage at the time of the last menstrual period or ovariectomy,\nwhichever came first. Women aged 51 years or more whose\nlast menstrual period coincided with hysterectomy were\nassumed to be postmenopausal.\nBone mineral density. BMD was measured in five\nregions of the femur by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry in\nthe NHANES III medical examination: femoral neck, inter-\ntrochanter, trochanter, Ward's triangle, and total. All five\nmeasurements were examined in bivariate analyses of BMD\nand blood lead level. For multivariate analyses, the BMD\nvalue from the trochanter region was used.\nStatistical methods\nThe associations of blood lead level with trochanter BMD,\nmenopause, time since menopause, and HRT were modeled\nusing multiple linear regression, controlling for other factors\nrelated to blood lead level.

All estimates\npresented here were calculated incorporating the sampling\nweights. Adjusted geometric mean blood lead levels were\nobtained using the LSMEANS statement in SUDAAN.\nRESULTS\nSample characteristics\nA demographic description of the sample is provided in\ntable 1. The distribution of menopausal status among women\naged 40\u00ad59 years varied significantly by race/ethnicity (p =\n0.0136). As compared with White women, non-Hispanic\nBlacks appeared to be overrepresented among surgically\nmenopausal women, whereas non-Hispanic Whites and\nMexican Americans were slightly underrepresented. The\nmean age of the sample was 48.1 years, and, as expected,\nmenopausal status was strongly correlated with age. Post-\nmenopausal women were more likely to abstain from weekly\nalcohol use (by self-report) and less likely to have a college\neducation than premenopausal women.\nDistributions of data on BMD and other bone density-\nrelated factors\nMenopausal status was significantly associated with BMD\nmeasurements from all five regions of the femur (p <\n0.0001), with premenopausal women having a higher BMD\nthan surgically and naturally menopausal women (table 2).\nPostmenopausal women were more likely than premeno-\npausal women to be either current or past users of HRT (p <\n0.0001). Current users of HRT had been undergoing HRT\nfor a longer amount of time than past users (a mean of 6\nyears vs. 2.9 years). Current users of HRT who were meno-\npausal had the longest duration of HRT use (6.9 years).\nSurgically menopausal women were, on average, further\naway in time from menopause than naturally menopausal\nBlood lead levels for bone density-related predictor\nvariables\nPremenopausal women had a geometric mean blood lead\nlevel of 1.9 \u00b5g/dl, as compared with 2.7 \u00b5g/dl and 2.9 \u00b5g/dl\nfor surgically menopausal women and naturally menopausal\nwomen, respectively (table 3). Current users of HRT had a\nlower geometric mean blood lead level than women who\nreported never having used HRT (1.9 \u00b5g/dl vs. 2.2 \u00b5g/dl).\nPast users of HRT had a geometric mean blood lead level of\n3.0 \u00b5g/dl. Women who had never used HRT and women\nwho had used HRT for at least 1 year had lower mean blood\nlead levels than women who had been using HRT for less\nthan 1 year. Relative to premenopausal women, geometric\nmean blood lead levels peaked among women who were 0\u00ad2\nyears past menopause and were lowest among postmeno-\npausal women who were 9 or more years beyond meno-\npause. Blood lead levels were significantly related to\nmenopausal status and BMD. In bivariate analyses, BMD\nmeasured in all five regions of the femur was significantly\ninversely associated with blood lead level (table 4).\nAge-stratified analyses\nCompared with premenopausal women of the same age,\npostmenopausal women had significantly higher geometric\nmean blood lead levels in every age group (figure 1), with\nthe greatest differences being observed in the group aged\n45\u00ad49 years. In addition, for every age category, current\nusers of HRT had lower geometric mean blood lead levels\nthan past or never users (figure 2).\nTABLE 3.

A\none-unit change in BMD was associated with a 0.6-\u00b5g/dl\nlower geometric mean blood lead level. Age was positively\nassociated with blood lead. Non-Hispanic Blacks had signif-\nicantly higher blood lead levels than non-Hispanic Whites.\nPersons living in urban or suburban areas had higher blood\nlead levels than those living in more rural areas. Having a\nhousehold income at or below the poverty line was associ-\nated with a significantly higher blood lead level than having\nan income above the poverty line.

When menopausal status was added\nto the model, the association of BMD with blood lead (log-\ntransformed) remained significant.

Surgically menopausal women also had a\nsignificantly higher adjusted blood lead level than premeno-\nHRT use. HRT use was significantly associated with log\nblood lead level in a model that adjusted for BMD, meno-\npausal status, and other covariates (table 5, model with\nBMD, menopausal status, and HRT). The addition of HRT to\nthe model did not materially alter the association of BMD or\nmenopausal status with blood lead level. Among postmeno-\npausal women, never users of HRT had a significantly higher\nadjusted geometric mean blood lead level than women who\nwere currently using HRT (2.2 \u00b5g/dl vs. 1.8 \u00b5g/dl; p =\n0.0006). Former users of HRT also had a significantly higher\nadjusted blood lead level than current users (2.6 \u00b5g/dl vs. 1.8\nTime since menopause. Time (years) since menopause\nwas a significant predictor of blood lead level among women\nwho were not current users of HRT (table 5, model with time\nsince menopause). Postmenopausal women who were closer\nin time to the last menstrual period tended to have signifi-\ncantly higher blood lead levels than both premenopausal\nwomen and postmenopausal women who were further away\nin time (9 years) from the menopausal transition.\nDISCUSSION\nThese analyses suggest that menopause and bone status\nare predictors of blood lead level among women aged 40\u00ad59\nyears in the US population. BMD was significantly inversely\nassociated with blood lead level after adjustment for other\nfactors traditionally associated with blood lead. Menopausal\nstatus and HRT use, both of which are associated with BMD,\nwere important predictors of blood lead level independently\nof age and other factors. Despite recent declines in environ-\nmental lead exposure, the estimated effects of menopause\nobserved in this study are similar to those reported for\nother investigators (6, 63, 65). Among women not currently\non HRT, time since menopause, a potential marker of bone\ndensity loss, was significantly associated with blood lead,\nwith postmenopausal women closer in time to the meno-\npausal transition tending to have higher blood lead levels\nthan those further away from menopause. These associations\nwithstood multivariate adjustment for current BMD, race/\nethnicity, age, smoking, alcohol use, education, household\nincome, and urbanicity. In the absence of HRT, time since\nthe menopausal transition was associated with bone\ndemineralization; these observations are consistent with the\nhypothesis that bone demineralization increases the blood\nlead levels of menopausal women.\nTo our knowledge, this study is the first to have examined\nthe relation between BMD measured by dual-energy x-ray\nabsorptiometry and blood lead level. A statistically signifi-\ncant association between concurrent measurements of BMD\nand blood lead level was observed after multivariate adjust-\nment for menopausal status. A low BMD measurement may\nreflect either recent decline in BMD or longstanding bone\nmineral status. It is possible that lead may affect BMD,\nrather than BMD's affecting lead. Experimental studies in\nrats demonstrate that the effects of lead in decreasing bone\ngrowth and density are associated with perinatal exposures\n(69, 70). Because of the cross-sectional design of NHANES\nIII, inferences about the temporal nature of any of the associ-\nations reported here cannot be made on the basis of these\ndata alone.\nFIGURE 2. Adjusted geometric mean blood lead levels by age and use of hormone replacement therapy, Third National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey, 1988\u00ad1994. (*Statistically significant difference in blood lead levels relative to premenopausal women.)\nWomen who were current users of HRT had adjusted blood\nlead levels lower than those of past or never users, indepen-\ndently of age. This observation is consistent with the findings\nof other investigators (64) and supports the hypothesis that\nblood lead levels among postmenopausal women are partly\ndriven by factors that affect bone loss. However, the possi-\nbility cannot be ruled out that differing lead exposure profiles\nbetween these groups of women were responsible for the\nobserved effect, despite our attempt to control for this through\nmultivariate adjustment for factors known to be associated\nwith lead exposure. Women who choose to use HRT may be\ndifferent from women who do not with regard to many health\nbehaviors and exposures, both known and unknown (71).\nHowever, it is unlikely that this is the only explanation, since\nno differences between former users and never users of HRT\nwere observed after multivariate adjustment.\nOur results reinforce the possibility that blood lead stores\nmay represent an endogenous source of lead exposure.\nAlthough the differences in average blood lead levels\nreported here are relatively small, increases in blood lead by\nthese amounts may still pose a risk to women who experi-\nence significant bone loss or have higher bone lead levels at\nthe start of menopause. Moreover, small increases in blood\nlead level are associated with decrements in neurocognitive\nperformance (72) and increased risks of atherosclerosis and\nperipheral arterial disease were reported in adults with\nincreases in blood lead within the range found in this study\nThe magnitude of postmenopausal changes in blood lead\nlevel may depend on a number of factors, including the\namount and bioavailability of lead stored in bone prior to\nmenopause and the rate and magnitude of bone mineral loss.\nInitial bone lead stores at menopause may differ among\ndifferent ethnic groups on the basis of prior exposures (2).\nMoreover, there is evidence that BMD and rates of loss after\nmenopause may differ by ethnicity (75\u00ad77).

If this is the case, increases in the release of endog-\nenous lead may result in transfers of more lead to critical\ncompartments in soft tissue (10, 78). Although this theory\nhas not been proven directly, this observation may explain\nrecent findings that bone lead is more predictive of outcomes\nsuch as hypertension in older persons than is blood lead (57,\n80), as well as observations that the relation between blood\nlead and diastolic hypertension appears to be stronger among\npostmenopausal women (58). We recommend that investiga-\ntors studying health outcomes associated with lead exposure\nin women during the menopausal transition measure bone\nlead levels in addition to blood lead levels.\n"
