BPA is also found in the resin linings of\nfood and beverage cans and dental sealants [1], leaching readily\nfrom many of these products and leading to exposure in large\nsegments of the population [2]. Biomonitoring data indicate that\n93% of U.S. general population aged six and older has detectable\nlevels of BPA in urine [3].\nWhile BPA has been evaluated as an endocrine disruptor, the\npotential metabolic effects of BPA are also of interest. Studies using\nrodent models have suggested that BPA can alter insulin\nbiosynthesis and secretion in pancreatic b-cells, potentially through\nthe over-activation of the estrogen receptor, ERa [4\u00ad6]. This may\nlead to insulin resistance and the subsequent development of type-2\ndiabetes mellitus (T2DM). Other evidence of BPA's metabolic\neffects include dysregulation of glucose transport in adipocytes [7]\nand inhibition of adiponectin release [8].\nPrevious epidemiological studies using data from the National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), which\ncombines questionnaires and physical exams to assess health and\nnutrition in the U.S. population (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/\nnhanes.htm) have shown an inconsistent association between the\nprevalence of self-reported T2DM and urinary BPA levels. In\nstandard deviation increase in BPA) [9], but this association was\nAlthough self-reported diabetes is reported to be reasonably in\nagreement with medication use and the clinical cutoff, as\ndetermined by fasting glucose levels (126 mg/dL or higher) [11\u00ad\n13], the possibility of an underestimation of diabetes in the\npopulation by using this outcome measure still exists, since people\nmay not be aware of their true clinical status [14]. Recently, the\nInternational Expert Committee recommended the use of the\nhemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), a measure of glycated hemoglobin in\nred blood cells, as an alternative method for the diagnosis of\nIn addition to potential problems with the diabetes outcome metric\nused in previous studies, those previous studies also assumed linear\nexposure-response relations between urinary BPA and the health\noutcomes including T2DM [9,10]. Non-linear exposure-response\nrelations are frequently observed in environmental epidemiologic\nstudies when biomonitoring exposure data are used. Often, a higher\nslope in the lower exposure region and a plateau in the higher\nexposure region (log-linear exposure-response) is observed [16].\nTherefore, a more thorough exploration of the shape of the exposure-\nresponse curve may be warranted to aid assessment of the risks BPA\nmay pose to human health, and in particular, metabolic function.\nGiven the increasing burden of T2DM and the ubiquitous\nexposures to BPA, determining if the two are associated may have\nimportant implications for prevention. Here, we examined the\npossible association between BPA exposure and T2DM, defined as\nHbA1c greater than and equal to 6.5%, in an expanded NHANES\nas well as in individual cycles. We also explored exposure-response\nrelations using a smoothing method (natural splines).\nMethods\nEthics Statement\nNHANES is a publicly available data set and all participants in\nNHANES provide written informed consent, consistent with\napproval by the National Center for Health Statistics Institutional\nReview Board.\nStudy Population\ncross-sectional study designed to be representative of the health\nand diet of the non-institutionalized U.S. population.

For the present study, 4,792 adults, aged 20 years or\nolder, who participated in the sub-study of the environmental\nphenol measurement in urine, were eligible. Eight subjects with\nurinary BPA concentrations greater than 80.1 ng/mL were\nexcluded, consistent with previous reports [9,10].

Gender\nwas categorized as male or female. Race/ethnicity was categorized\ninto five groups: Mexican American, other Hispanic, non-Hispanic\nWhite, non-Hispanic Black, and other. Self-reported educational\nattainment was categorized into three levels: ,high school, high\nschool diploma, and some college and over.

Body mass index\n(BMI) was calculated as measured weight in kilograms divided by\nmeasured height in meters squared. Waist circumference was\nmeasured in centimeters. Urinary creatinine, an indicator of renal\nstatus, was measured on the Beckman CX3 using a Jaffe reaction in\nusing an enzymatic (creatinase) method in the NHANES 2007/08\ncycle. Because the Jaffe method is subject to more interference,\nNHANES conducted a crossover study to identify the following\nequations to adjust urinary creatinine assayed before 2007 [21]:\nUrine creatinin e,75 mg/dL:\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nX(unadj Cr)\np\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nX(unadj Cr)\np\nUrine Bisphenol A and Type-2 Diabetes in US Adults\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nX(unadj Cr)\np\nThese adjustments were applied for the current analysis.\nStatistical Analysis\nNHANES implemented a complex cluster sample design to\ninclude adequate representation from various socioeconomic\nstrata and minorities. In recognition of these design effects, we\ncomputed weighted estimates according to the NHANES Analytic\nand Reporting Guidelines [22] including six-year sampling\nweights. We used the survey package (version 3.22-3) in R\nsoftware (version 2.11.1; R Foundation for Statistical Computing,\nhttp://www.r-project.org).\nThe distribution of urinary BPA was highly right-skewed, and\nthus, we computed survey-weighted geometric means and\ngeometric standard errors (SEs). We used survey-weighted\ngeneralized linear models to fit binary T2DM and continuous\nHbA1c outcomes. The following variables were chosen a priori as\ncovariates in the models because of their biological relevance to\nthe outcomes: age (linear and quadratic terms), gender, race/\nethnicity, education, income, BMI, waist circumference, smoking\nstatus and urinary creatinine [3,9,10,23]. We modeled urinary\ncreatinine with a natural spline (restricted cubic spline) with four\ndegrees of freedom (knots at 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles) to\naccommodate potential nonlinearity because log-transformation\nor adding a quadratic term could not capture such nonlinearity\nwell. We constructed sequential covariate models: model 1\nadjusted for urinary creatinine and age; model 2: further\nadjustment for gender, race-ethnicity, education and income;\nmodel 3 further adjustment for smoking status, BMI, and waist\nFigure 1.

Recently, attention has been paid to the\npotential contribution of BPA to the etiology of this disease, and\nthe study by Lang et al., that reported statistically significant\nassociations between urinary BPA and self-reported, physician-\ncycle [9], has catalyzed a hot debate on the potential role of BPA\nas a ``diabetogen'' [24]. The present work complements the\nanalyses of Lang et al. [9] and Melzer et al. [10] by further\nexamining the question of whether or not BPA exposure may have\nan adverse impact on glucose homeostasis, and by further\nused as a biomarker for glucose homeostasis and T2DM, rather\nthan the previously studied, self-reported, physician-diagnosed\ndiabetes measurement.\nHere, we found that urinary BPA concentrations were signifi-\ncantly positively associated with the prevalence of T2DM as well as\nthe continuous measure of HbA1c when all three NHANES cycles\nwere combined and analyzed together. However, when we\ncompleted the analyses separately for each NHANES cycle, we\nonly found a statistically significant association between urinary\nFurther, there was no consistency in the association among different\ncycles. This suggests that the observed, statistically significant\nassociation in the pooled data may actually be driven by data from\nonly one NHANES cycle. This may, in part, be due to the\nunclear whether this difference is due to random chance or some\nvariation in the sampling of the different cycles. It is unlikely that the\nsignificantly lower mean urinary BPA concentrations for 2005\u00ad\n2008 are due to a decrease in exposure to BPA, since it is only\nrecently that BPA has captured the public's attention thus leading to\nan increased number of BPA-free products on the market. It may be\nmost likely, however, that the non-significant associations in 2005/\nresult of the narrower range (less variation) of urinary BPA (95% CI,\nusing natural splines revealed that the exposure-response relation-\nships were close to being log-linear rather than linear (Figure 1).\nThis suggests that the assumption of linearity in the association\nbetween BPA and T2DM made in previously published work may\nnot be appropriate.\nTable 3.

Second, a continuous biomarker such as\nHbA1c would better capture individuals with undiagnosed disease,\nwhich could reduce outcome misclassification. Seven million\npeople in the U.S. are believed to have undiagnosed diabetes [26].\nThe absence of diagnosis is likely the biggest concern in\nunderserved populations, those of lower socioeconomic status,\nand those with poorer access to healthcare. A study of newly-\nadmitted hospital patients in the Bronx, New York found that 35%\nof patients had HbA1c levels that met the clinical definition of\nT2DM but had never been diagnosed [27]. Therefore, we\nconsidered HbA1c a favorable outcome measure for this study\nbecause it would include individuals without a physician's\ndiagnosis who might otherwise have been excluded.\nSome diabetes researchers and physicians argue that several\nfactors could potentially lead to inaccuracies in the HbA1c test and\na subsequent misdiagnosis. These include any kind of hemoglo-\nbinopathy, such as sickle cell anemia or other anemias, which tend\nto be found more frequently in subjects of selected race/ethnicity,\ngender or age [25,28]. This possibility is unlikely to have\ninfluenced our results, because age, gender and race-ethnicity\ndid not modify the association between urinary BPA and T2DM\nin the present study. An additional issue with HbA1c is that there\nseem to be inconsistencies across laboratory equipment and\nmethods so that results vary based on the laboratory performing\nthe test [25,28]. In NHANES, the laboratory methods for HbA1c\n(Tosoh method). One may argue that the statistically significant\nassociation found only in the NHANES 2003/04, but not in the\nother two cycles, is due to the difference in the assay method for\nHbA1c. This is unlikely, however, because we adjusted the 2003/\n04 HbA1c values using the calibration equation suggested by\nNHANES [20] (provided in Methods) and because our results are\nconsistent with those found using self-reported diagnosis of\nT2DM. Lastly, T2DM is strongly associated with heart disease\nand heart disease medications, such as diuretics, can affect the\nclearance of BPA. Thus, because increased BPA levels in urine\ncould be a consequence of treatment of heart disease, the cross-\nsectional association between BPA and T2DM could be capturing\nthe association between T2DM and heart disease. In our study,\nsubjects who took diuretics had significantly higher concentrations\nof urinary BPA than those who did not (age, gender, race-\nethnicity, and urinary creatinine-adjusted difference in urinary\ninclusion of diuretic use in the model only slightly attenuated the\nobserved associations and did not change the overall patterns of\nassociation (data not shown).\nAlthough there is scant evidence of the association between BPA\nexposure and T2DM or other relevant biomarkers in human\nFigure 2. Adjusted odds ratio of type-2 diabetes for a doubling in urinary bisphenol-A (BPA) by important subgroups. The adjusted\ncovariates are the same as in Figure 1.\nUrine Bisphenol A and Type-2 Diabetes in US Adults\npopulations, the physiological plausibility of BPA's effect on\nmetabolic homeostasis has been explored in both rodent and\nhuman tissue culture models and several mechanisms have been\nproposed. The first is that BPA may lead to overstimulation of the\nestrogen receptor ERa in pancreatic b-cells. ERa plays a role in\nincreasing insulin biosynthesis in response to increased physiolog-\nical concentrations of estrogen, such as during pregnancy [5].\nStudies in male mice have shown that BPA may also stimulate\ninsulin biosynthesis and secretion through ERa, leading to\nhyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance [5,6]. Additionally, genetic\ndefects of ERa are associated with impaired glucose metabolism,\ninsulin resistance, T2DM and metabolic syndrome [29\u00ad31]. A\nsecond proposed mechanism is that BPA mimics estradiol (E2)\nwhich is also important to maintaining insulin sensitivity and b-cell\nfunction during physiologically relevant periods [32,33]. Male\nmice treated with either BPA or E2 show altered glucose tolerance,\ninsulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia [6,34,35]. A third\nmechanism suggested is that BPA may suppress adiponectin, an\nadipocyte-specific hormone responsible for maintaining insulin\nsensitivity [36], and that is known to be reduced prior to\ndevelopment of T2DM [37]. Hugo et al. compared the effects of\nlow doses of BPA and E2 on adiponectin secretion from human\nbreast cells, adipose explants and mature adipocytes and found\nthat low doses of BPA and E2 were both effective at suppressing\nadiponectin release in all tissue types [7]. Similarly, Ben-Jonathan\net al. also found that low doses of BPA inhibited adiponectin\nrelease in human adipose tissue [8]. This body of evidence suggests\nthat exposure to BPA may lead to altered metabolic homeostasis\nvia multiple pathways.\nThe strengths of this study include 1) the use of three\nindependent representative samples of the U.S. general population\n(including oversampled minority populations), which enables the\nobserved results to be generalizable; 2) the use of NHANES data\nconducted with strict quality control procedures; and 3) the fact\nthat this is the first and largest study of BPA exposure and HbA1c,\na stable marker of glycemic index.\nDespite HbA1c's benefits, the cross-sectional design used in the\nNHANES survey may limit causal inferences. Only a single urine\nsample and a single blood draw were taken for each patient\nstudied in this analysis. While HbA1c is considered relatively\nstable over several months, BPA is believed to have a short half-life\nin the human body, with generally all BPA being eliminated within\n24 hours of exposure [38]. Exposure assessment using a single\nurine sample makes it impossible to address the temporal\nvariability of a person's BPA exposure. In fact, BPA concentrations\nin urine have been found to be highly variable from day to day and\nthe reproducibility has been low [39,40]. This variability would\nlead to a non-differential misclassification and therefore bias the\nassociation towards the null. Therefore, the use of a single urinary\nmeasurement of environmental exposure as a predictor of chronic\ndisease may not be appropriate, especially when the exposure is\nbelieved to be relatively short-lived in the human body. While a\nrecent study suggested that the half-life of BPA within the\npopulation might be longer than originally believed, the observed\nstability could also be an effect of continuous widespread exposure\nin the population, including from non-food sources [41].\nTherefore, longitudinal studies, with multiple measures over a\nmuch longer time period, will be necessary in order to further\ninvestigate if there is a true association between BPA exposure and\nAdditionally, because this study only examined concurrent BPA\nexposure among adults, it was impossible to investigate any effect\nthat BPA exposure during critical growth periods, such as\nprenatally, may be having on disease. This is an important\nresearch aspect as evidence is mounting that is suggestive that\nearly life exposures may predispose an individual to developing\ndisease later in life [42\u00ad44]. A recent study in mice even suggested\nthat maternal exposure to BPA could lead to altered metabolic\nhomeostasis in offspring [45]. Male offspring who were exposed to\nBPA in utero were found to have significantly reduced glucose\ntolerance and increased insulin resistance compared to the\noffspring of untreated mothers [45]. This would be an important\narea of future research, given that BPA has been detected in\nhuman breast milk, amniotic fluid, placenta, neonatal and cord\nGiven their widespread prevalence in the environment,\ninvestigating the role of environmental contaminants like BPA in\nthe pathogenesis of T2DM, obesity and metabolic syndrome is of\nsignificant public health importance. While the results of this work\nhave limitations, further study of this possible association is\nwarranted, both to explore possible physiologic pathways involved\nas well as to understand if long-term exposure and exposure\nduring critical periods of growth and development may play a role\nin the development of T2DM and other metabolic diseases.\nAuthor Contributions\nConceived and designed the experiments: SKP.
