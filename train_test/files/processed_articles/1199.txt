Research on smoking and suicide requires\nvery large samples that sometime have to be\nfollowed many years. It is much easier to study the\nrelationship of smoking with more commonly\noccurring SROs. The latter are relevant outcomes\nbecause SROs are the immediate precursors to suicide\ndeath and are important in their own right because\nthey are associated with substantial distress and\ninjury.\nStatistically significant associations similar to those\nbetween smoking and suicide deaths have been\ndocumented between smoking and SROs in cross-\nples.13,14 These associations have held up after\ncontrolling for sociodemographics and limited mea-\nsures of psychological functioning (including mea-\nsures of depression and drug use disorders). A\nnumber of other studies, though,15\u00ad18 have found that\nsmoking is not significantly related to SROs after\ncontrolling more comprehensively for mental disor-\nders. However, as the temporal priorities between\nsmoking and mental disorders were not established in\nthese studies, it remains unclear whether this finding\nshould be interpreted as due to confounding (that is,\nmental disorders causing both smoking and SROs) or\nmediation (that is, smoking causing mental disorders\nand mental disorders, in turn, causing SROs).\nIt is difficult to make sense of available epidemio-\nlogical data on this question because smoking is a\ncomplex addictive behavior that clusters with other\nbehavioral risk factors for suicide and SROs.19\u00ad22 An\nadditional complication is that basic research on\nsmoking suggests that smoking might plausibly be\nboth a cause and a consequence of psychopatho-\nlogy.23\u00ad27 Chronic smoking, for example, has been\nfound to reduce the sensitivity of serotonin receptors\nin the frontal cortex,24 possibly promoting depression.\nAcute exposure to smoking, on the other hand, may\nhave the opposite physiologic effect by raising\nserotonin levels in the frontal cortex,26 providing a\nphysiologic explanation for the hypothesis that some\npeople with affective disorders self-medicate their\ndysphoria by smoking.\nThe current study was designed to provide new\ninformation about the epidemiology of smoking and\nSROs by analyzing data from a nationally representa-\ntive two-wave panel survey of the US population that\nstudies, which merely attempted to document and\nthen explain away the prospective association be-\ntween smoking and SROs by introducing controls for\nbaseline variables, we set out to distinguish the effects\nof confounding and mediating variables in explaining\nthis association. The analysis is based on a dataset\nthat has more comprehensive measures of smoking,\nSROs and mental disorders than previous studies. In\naddition, the sample is more broadly representative\nand the follow-up period is longer than in most\nprevious studies.\nMaterials and methods\nSample\nData come from the 5001 respondents who partici-\n(NCS-2).29 The NCS28 was a nationally representative\na response rate of 82.4%. Interviews were conducted\nby professional survey interviewers and administered\nin two parts. Part I, which included the core\ndiagnostic interview, was administered to all respon-\ndents. Part II, which included additional disorders\nand risk factors, was administered to a probability\nsubsample of 5877 respondents including all respon-\ndents aged 15\u00ad24 years, all others with any lifetime\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,\n3rd edn, revised (DSM-III-R) disorder assessed in\nPart I, and a random subsample of remaining Part I\nrespondents. The Part II sample was weighted to\nadjust for differential probabilities of selection and for\nnonresponse bias. The nonresponse adjustment\nweight was based on the results of a brief screening\nsurvey carried out in a representative subsample\nof initial survey nonrespondents. Further details\nabout the NCS design and weighting are reported\nThe NCS-2 sought to trace and reinterview all Part\nII NCS respondents a decade after the NCS. Of the\ndeceased and 5001 reinterviewed, for a conditional\nresponse rate of 87.6%. The unconditional response\nwere assessed using an expanded version of the\nbaseline interview that assessed onset and course of\ndisorders between the two surveys. Relative to other\nbaseline NCS respondents, NCS-2 respondents were\nsignificantly more likely to be female, well educated\nand residents of rural areas. A propensity score\nadjustment weight30 corrected for these discrepan-\ncies. Importantly, there was no difference between\nNCS-2 respondents and nonrespondents in their\nreports of SROs at the baseline assessment.31\nSuicide-related outcomes\nSROs were assessed using parallel questions in the\nNCS and NCS-2. At the baseline assessment, respon-\ndents were asked about lifetime experiences of\nsuicide ideation (`Have you ever seriously thought\nabout committing suicide?'), suicide plans (`Have you\never made a plan for committing suicide?') and\nsuicide attempts (`Have you ever attempted suicide?').\nBecause self-administered surveys have been shown\nto yield higher rates of reporting embarrassing\nbehaviors than interviewer-administered surveys,32\nSROs were assessed in a self-administered booklet.\nRespondents who reported an SRO were asked\nquestions about age of onset and recency. Those\nwho reported a suicide attempt were also presented\nwith three statements and asked to identify the one\nthat best described their experience: `(1) I made a\nSmoking and suicide-related outcomes in the NCS panel\nRC Kessler et al\nMolecular Psychiatry\nserious attempt to kill myself and it was only luck that\nI did not succeed; (2) I tried to kill myself but I knew\nthe method was not foolproof; (3) My attempt was a\ncry for help, I did not want to die.' In line with\ncontemporary distinctions between suicidal and\nnonsuicidal self-injury,33,34 respondents endorsing\nstatements 1 or 2 were considered to have made a\nsuicide attempt, whereas respondents endorsing\nstatement 3 were considered to have made a suicide\n`gesture' (that is, potentially injurious behavior in\nwhich the intent was not to die, but to signal distress\nand/or to seek help from others). At the NCS-2 follow-\nup assessment, respondents were asked a similar\nseries of self-administered SRO questions as at base-\nline, but this time focusing on the interval between\nthe two surveys rather than over their lifetime. In\nanalyzing these data, we distinguished between new\nonsets (that is, SROs at follow-up among those who\ndenied ever having such an experience at baseline)\nand persistence (that is, SROs that occurred between\nthe two surveys among respondents who also\nreported a lifetime history of the same experiences\nat baseline).\nSmoking\nAll baseline NCS respondents were asked if they ever\nsmoked even occasionally. Those who responded\naffirmatively were asked retrospectively to report\nthe age when they had their first smoke. Recency of\nsmoking was also assessed, with respondents who\nreported smoking at all in the past year being defined\n`current' smokers and those with less recent smoking\ndefined `past' smokers. In addition, a Tobacco\nSupplement, in which more detailed information\nabout history of smoking was obtained, was adminis-\ntered to a representative subsample of 4414 Part II\nNCS respondents out of the total Part II sample of\n5877. The Tobacco Supplement began with a screen-\ning question that asked respondent if they ever in\ntheir life smoked daily for a month or more. Lifetime\ndaily smokers were also assessed for DSM-III-R\nnicotine dependence. Age of onset and recency of\ndaily smoking and nicotine dependence were as-\nsessed using the same approach as in the assessment\nof lifetime use. The NCS-2 assessment repeated these\nquestions for respondents who were not in the\nbaseline Tobacco Supplement.\nOther risk factors for SROs\nWe also considered the effects of additional baseline\nrisk factors for SROs, focusing on risk factors that\nhave been documented in the literature as potential\ndeterminants of the relationship between smoking\ncontrols, baseline measures that might most reason-\nably be conceptualized as common causes of respon-\ndent smoking and SROs (parental history of common\nmental\u00adsubstance disorders and other respondent\nchildhood adversities), and baseline measures that\nmight possibly be mediators of the effects of smoking\non SROs (respondent lifetime of DSM-III-R mental\ndisorders, history of substance use and history of\ntreatment for mental\u00adsubstance problems). We also\ncontrolled for baseline history of SROs to distinguish\nfirst onsets from recurrences in the intervening\ndecade. As the results of analyses using these controls\nto predict the outcomes considered here have been\nreported previously,31 they are not discussed in the\ncurrent report.\nBaseline sociodemographic controls included age,\nsex, race-ethnicity, marital status, employment status,\nreligious affiliation, education, family income and\nhaving/not having a young child. Parental mental\ndisorders were assessed with the Family History\nResearch Diagnostic Criteria interview35 and its\nextension.36 The parental disorders included were\nmajor depression, generalized anxiety disorder, panic\ndisorder, antisocial personality disorder and alcohol\u00ad\ndrug dependence. Other respondent childhood ad-\nversities assessed included neglect, physical abuse,\nsexual abuse and childhood financial adversity.\nThese measures were developed specifically for the\nBaseline respondent DSM-III-R disorders included\nlifetime and recent (in the year before the baseline\ninterview) mood disorders (major depressive, bipolar I\nand dysthymic disorders), anxiety disorders (panic\ndisorder, agoraphobia without panic, social phobia,\nsimple phobia, generalized anxiety disorder and\nposttraumatic stress disorder), substance use disor-\nders (alcohol or other drug abuse or dependence) and\nantisocial spectrum disorders (conduct disorder and\nadult antisocial behavior). These disorders were\nassessed at baseline with the World Health Organiza-\ntion Composite International Diagnostic Interview\n(CIDI).38\u00ad40 Quantity\u00adfrequency of alcohol use were\nassessed with both lifetime (the one year in the\nrespondent's life when he drank the most) and\n12-month questions about how many days in a typical\nmonth the respondent drank and number of drinks on\ndays drinking. Frequency of illicit drug use was\nassessed with both lifetime and 12-month questions\nabout how many days in a typical month the\nrespondent used each of a wide variety of illicit\ndrugs. Baseline history of treatment for emotional\u00ad\nsubstance problems was defined dichotomously in\nresponse to a series of questions about treatment for\nspecific disorders in the CIDI.\nStatistical analyses\nCross-tabulations were used to estimate the preva-\nlence of SROs that occurred between the two surveys.\nMultivariate logistic regression analysis41 was used to\nestimate associations of baseline smoking with the\nsubsequent onset and persistence of SROs, with and\nwithout controls for other baseline risk factors. In\norder to distinguish effects in predicting suicide\nideation from effects on rarer SROs that are con-\ntingent on ideation, separate equations were used to\npredict ideation in the total sample and then, within\nthe subsample of ideators, to predict conditional\nrisk of plans, gestures and attempts. A Tobacco\nSmoking and suicide-related outcomes in the NCS panel\nRC Kessler et al\nMolecular Psychiatry\nSupplement dummy variable (DTS) was included in\nthe prediction equations to distinguish panel survey\nrespondents who were in the Tobacco Supplement\nfrom other respondents. Both types of respondents\nwere included in the initial analyses, where the\nbaseline smoking data were treated as equivalent in\nboth subsamples even though these data were\nobtained retrospectively from panel sample respon-\ndents who did not participate in the NCS Tobacco\nSupplement. Once final models were developed,\nthese models were expanded to include interactions\nbetween the smoking predictors and the DTS dummy\nvariable in order to determine if the magnitude of the\nassociations of baseline smoking and nicotine depen-\ndence with the later SROs differs significantly in the\nsubsamples where smoking was assessed prospec-\ntively vs retrospectively.\nLogistic regression coefficients and their 95%\nconfidence intervals (95% CIs) were exponentiated\nto create odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% CIs. The\nlatter are presented here because they are easier to\ninterpret than logistic regression coefficients. The\nterm `gross effects' of baseline smoking and nicotine\ndependence is used to refer to associations based on\nprediction equations that controlled only for baseline\nsociodemographics and baseline history of SROs. The\nterm `net effects,' in comparison, is used to refer to\nassociations based on prediction equations that\nadditionally controlled for the full set of baseline risk\nfactors enumerated above. Continuous predictors\nwere divided into categories to minimize the effects\nof extreme values, whereas some categories of\npredictors were combined to stabilize associations\nwhen the odds ratio (OR) did not differ meaningfully\nacross contiguous categories. Standard errors and\nsignificance tests were estimated using the Taylor\nseries method42 implemented in the SUDAAN soft-\nware system43 to adjust for NCS and NCS-2 design\neffects. Multivariate significance was evaluated using\nWald w2 tests based on design-corrected coefficient\nvariance-covariance matrices. Statistical significance\nwas evaluated using two-tailed 0.05 level tests.\nResults\nOnset and persistence of SROs\ndents who participated in both waves of the survey\nreported a lifetime history of suicide ideation at\nbaseline, whereas 4.0% reported a baseline history of\na suicide plan, 2.2% a suicide gesture and 2.2% a\nsuicide attempt (Table 1). Substantial proportions of\nthe respondents with a baseline SRO history reported\nrecurrences a decade later: 35.0% of those with a\nbaseline history of suicide ideation, 21.2% of those\nwith a history of plans, 10.8% of those with a history\nof gestures and 15.4% of those with a baseline history\nof attempts. An additional 6.2% of panel respondents\nreported the first onset of suicide ideation in the\ndecade between the surveys, whereas 2.3% reported\nthe first onset of a suicide plan, 0.7% a suicide\ngesture and 0.9% a suicide attempt. Combining\nrecurrences and first onsets, a full 10.0% of respon-\ndents reported having suicide ideation in the decade\nbetween the surveys, whereas 3.0% had a suicide\nplan, 0.9% made a suicide gesture and 1.3% made a\nsuicide attempt. The majority of these cases (53.7% of\nfirst onsets in the decade between the two surveys.\nGross associations of baseline smoking and nicotine\ndependence with subsequent SROs\nThe gross associations (odds-ratios) of baseline smok-\ning-related predictors with subsequent SROs were\nfound generally not to differ in predicting SRO onset\nand persistence (detailed results available on\nrequest). As a result, we focus here on pooled\nassociations that combine the prediction of onset\nwith the prediction of persistence. A total of eight\nseparate baseline smoking-related variables were\nconsidered one at a time in models to predict\nsubsequent SROs: lifetime smoking, age of first use,\nlifetime daily smoking, age of first daily use,\nfrequency-recency of lifetime use (non-daily lifetime\nuse, past daily use, current daily use), lifetime\nnicotine dependence, age of first dependence and\nrecency of dependence. A total of 17 regression\ncoefficients were estimated to examine the associa-\ntions of these eight variables with each of the\nsubsequent SROs (Table 2). All of these coefficients\nthe 0.05 level, in predicting suicide ideation. A\nsomewhat smaller proportion (88%) are elevated,\n17% of them (3/17) significantly so, in predicting\nsuicide plans. Only slightly more than half of the\ncoefficients (58%), in comparison, are elevated in\npredicting suicide gestures and only a minority (29%)\nare elevated in predicting suicide attempts. None of\nthe coefficients is significant in predicting either\ngestures or attempts.\nInteractions of the DTS dummy variable with the 17\nsmoking-related predictors in predicting the four\noutcomes are significant for only 1 of the 68\ncoefficients, which is no more than we would expect\nby chance. Consistent with this result, replication of\nthese analyses exclusively in the subsample of\nrespondents who participated in the baseline Tobacco\nSupplement found the same results as in Table 2\n(detailed results available on request). These findings\nargue against the possibility that retrospective recall\nbias in the subsample of respondents who did not\nparticipate in the baseline Tobacco Supplement\naccounts for the findings in Table 2. On the basis of\nthese findings, we retained respondents who did not\nparticipate in the Tobacco Supplement in subsequent\nanalyses.\nA modest dose\u00adresponse pattern can be seen in the\naggregate predictions in two places in Table 2. First,\nthe OR associated with lifetime dependence is some-\nwhat higher than the OR associated with daily use,\nwhereas the latter is somewhat higher than the OR\nassociated with use. Second, early ages of use, daily\nSmoking and suicide-related outcomes in the NCS panel\nRC Kessler et al\nMolecular Psychiatry\nuse and dependence are associated with somewhat\nhigher risks than later onsets. However, neither of\nthese patterns is statistically significant. Furthermore,\ncontrary to expectation, current (at the time of the\nbaseline interview) daily use and dependence are not\nassociated with higher risk than past daily use and\ndependence. Similarly modest evidence for a dose\u00ad\nresponse pattern can be seen in the prediction of\nsuicide plans. Even this modest pattern breaks down,\nthough, in predicting gestures and attempts.\nNet associations of baseline smoking and nicotine\ndependence with subsequent SROs\nThe introduction of additional controls in the net\nmodels generally leads to a decrease in the already\nfairly modest associations of baseline smoking and\nnicotine dependence with subsequent suicide idea-\ntion (Table 3). It should be noted that even though\nsome of the control variables are highly intercorre-\nlated, no evidence of multicollinearity can be found\nusing standard tests (that is, examination of the\ncondition number of the predictor variable covar-\niance, inspection for high negative correlations in the\ncoefficient variance\u00adcovariance matrix and compar-\nison of increases in the 95% CIs in the net models vs\nthe gross models). Although the sign pattern in the\nnet models holds up with the introduction of the\nadditional controls (88% of the ORs remain elevated),\nnone of these ORs is significant at the 0.05 level.\nFurthermore, the dose\u00adresponse pattern found in the\ngross coefficients virtually disappears in the net\nmodels. In the case of suicide plans, in comparison,\nthe sign pattern remains (88% of the ORs remain\nelevated) and the proportion of ORs that are statisti-\ncally significant (17%, 3/17) is the same as in the\ngross models. Furthermore, some aspects of the\ndose\u00adresponse pattern continue to hold in the net\nmodels, most notably the higher ORs associated with\nearly than later onsets of use, daily use and\ndependence. Interestingly, the net coefficients are\nmore consistently elevated than the gross coefficients\nin predicting suicide gestures, with 88% of the ORs\nelevated, although none is statistically significant and\nthere is no evidence of a dose\u00adresponse pattern in the\ncoefficients. Only a minority of the ORs in the net\nmodels to predict suicide attempts, finally, is elevated\n(11%, 2/17) and none is statistically significant.\nElaboration of the classification of smoking\ninvolvement\nWe next created a more elaborate ordinal measure\ndesigned to describe baseline smoking history in a\nway that takes into consideration information con-\ntained in all eight of the measures considered above.\nThis results in a six-category classification scheme in\nwhich the lowest category consists of respondents\nwho never smoked and the highest of respondents\nwith a history of early-onset use, early-onset daily use\nand early-onset dependence (Table 4). The two high-\nest categories in this scheme are associated with\nsignificantly elevated ORs of ideation in the gross\nmodel. The highest category is associated with a\nsignificantly elevated OR of plans in the gross model.\nNone of the categories, though, is significantly\nassociated with either gestures or attempts in the\ngross models.\nThe situation is different in the net models. In the\ncase of ideation, the significant ORs disappear\nentirely in the net model and no dose\u00adresponse\nrelationship can be seen in the set of ORs as a whole.\nIn the case of plans, the significant OR associated\nwith the highest category of involvement (3.0) is\nunchanged from the gross effects model. In the case of\ngestures, each OR associated with any of the smoking\ncategories becomes elevated compared to the never-\nsmoked comparison group in the net model. These\nORs are in the range 1.7\u00ad2.0, but there is no dose\u00ad\nresponse relationship and none of these ORs is\nstatistically significant. In light of this consistently\nelevated set of ORs, we might suspect that the\nassociation is genuine rather than due to random\nerror. However, the pooled OR (95% CI in parentheses)\nTable 1 The distribution of suicide-related outcomes in the NCS (T1)\u00adNCS-2 (T2) panel sample (n = 5001)\nT1 lifetime\nprevalencea\n(% (s.e.))\nrecurrenceb\n(% (s.e.))\nonsetc (% (s.e.))\nprevalenced (% (s.e.))\nT1\u00adT2 first onset/period\nprevalencee (% (s.e.))\nAbbreviations: SRO, suicide-related outcome; NCS, National Comorbidity Survey.\naThe lifetime prevalence of each SRO at baseline.\nbThe proportion of respondents with a T1 lifetime history of the SRO who reported at T2 that the same SRO occurred in the\ndecade between the two surveys.\ncThe proportion of respondents with no T1 lifetime history of the SRO who reported at T2 that they had a first onset of the\nSRO in the decade between the surveys.\ndThe proportion of T2 respondents who reported having the SRO in the decade between the two surveys, whether or not they\nhad a T1 lifetime history of the SRO.\neThe proportion of respondents reporting SROs in the decade between the surveys that were first onsets.\nSmoking and suicide-related outcomes in the NCS panel\nRC Kessler et al\nMolecular Psychiatry\nmodel that makes a global contrast between respon-\ndents who ever smoked (that is, pooling all the\nsmoking categories) vs those who never smoked.

Both ORs are significant,\nis higher than the OR for active dependence (2.6\n(1.1\u00ad6.0)), suggesting that the causal pathways linking\ndependence with subsequent suicide plans are for\nthe most part not mediated by current tobacco\ninvolvement.\nDiscussion\nFour methodological limitations need to be noted in\nevaluating the substantive meaning our results. First,\nour predictors are limited by the fact that no\ninformation was collected about smokeless tobacco\nuse or about quantity\u00adfrequency of smoking (for\nexample, number of cigarettes, cigars or pipes smoked\nper day; number of years smoked). The prospective\nassociations found here might have been stronger if\nthe predictors had included these refinements. Sec-\nond, we did not consider the possibility that some\npeople who make suicide plans and attempts might\ndeny ever having suicide ideation, as the skip logic\nused in our surveys only assessed plans and attempts\namong respondents who reported a history of suicide\nideation. Third, we did not control for all DSM-IV\ndisorders. Nonaffective psychosis (NAP), for exam-\nple, was not included in the core NCS-R assessment.\nYet we know that both smoking44 and suicidality45 are\ncomparatively common among people with NAP.\nExclusion of NAP, then, presumably led to an over-\nestimation of the net effects of smoking. Fourth,\nalthough control data on history of preexisting mental\ndisorders and suicidality were gathered prospectively\nin our two-wave panel survey, the measures in each\nsurvey were based on retrospective reports. For\nexample, the aspect of baseline tobacco use most\nstrongly predictive of later SROs was early-onset\nnicotine dependence, a measure that required\nrespondents to provide retrospective reports in the\nbaseline survey about their age when they first\nexperienced symptoms of dependence. Similarly,\nthe outcome measures required respondents to make\nretrospective reports about the occurrence of SROs in\nthe decade since the baseline survey. Systematic\nrecall errors in these reports could have introduced\nbias into our estimates of predictive associations.\nSome indication that retrospective recall of smoking\nhistory is likely to be unbiased comes from our\ninvestigation of the fact that the detailed baseline\nassessment of smoking history was obtained only\nfrom the respondents in the Tobacco Supplement.\nOur finding that the associations of baseline smoking\nwith subsequent SROs were equivalent in magnitude\nwhether smoking was assessed prospectively or\nretrospectively argues against the existence of retro-\nspective recall bias at least for this part of the\nassessment of smoking history.\nIn the context of these limitations, we were able to\nreproduce the same basic data pattern that has been\ndocumented in previous prospective studies of\nsmoking and SROs: a significant time-lagged dose\u00ad\nresponse association between smoking-related vari-\nables and subsequent SROs. The associations involving\nsuicide ideation disappeared when we introduced\ncontrols for baseline risk factors. The conditional\nassociation of the highest level of smoking involve-\nment (lifetime nicotine dependence with early ages of\nonset of use, daily use and dependence) with suicide\nplans among ideators, in comparison, remained\nstatistically significant even in a model that included\na comprehensive set of controls.\nSeveral previous prospective epidemiological stu-\ndies found, unlike us, that significant gross prospec-\ntive associations between smoking and SROs\ndisappeared entirely after controlling for a series of\nof these associations to remain, between the highest\nlevel of smoking involvement and subsequent suicide\nplans, might be due to the fact that the smoking\nvariables in these earlier studies all measured use\nrather than nicotine dependence, whereas the sig-\nnificant net association in our study involved early-\nonset nicotine dependence. Another possible expla-\nnation for the difference between our result and the\nresults of these earlier studies is that our finding of a\nsignificant net association is a chance finding due to\nthe fact that we examined associations between many\ndifferent measures of smoking and four different\nmeasures of SROs. Replication of our finding that\nearly-onset nicotine dependence predicts suicide\nplans among ideators is needed before we can reject\nthe hypothesis of chance association. It is also\nnoteworthy that one other previous prospective\nepidemiological study found more consistent evi-\ndence than we did of statistically significant effects of\nsmoking on SROs after controlling for risk factors.11\nThis difference might be due to the fact that the\ncontrols used in that earlier study were much less\ncomplete than those used here.\nBy using more refined measures of both smoking\nand SROs than previous studies, we were able to\nexpand our understanding of these associations by\ndiscovering that early-onset nicotine dependence is\nthe aspect of smoking most strongly predictive of\nsubsequent SROs and that suicide ideation and,\namong ideators, suicide plans, are the only SROs\npredicted. Importantly, neither suicide gestures\namong ideators nor suicide attempts among ideators\nwere significantly predicted by any of the smoking-\nrelated variables we considered. Significant uncondi-\ntional time-lagged associations of smoking-related\nvariables with subsequent suicide gestures and\nsuicide attempts are, in fact, present in our data due\nto the people who make suicide gestures and attempts\nbeing a subset of the people who have suicide\nideation, but our decomposition of the SROs shows\nthat the significant associations are actually only with\nideation and plans. Previous research has shown that\nother predictors of ideation differ from the condi-\ntional predictors of attempts among ideators.46 The\npredictive effects of smoking now have to be\nSmoking and suicide-related outcomes in the NCS panel\nRC Kessler et al\nMolecular Psychiatry\nconceptualized in terms of this emerging evidence of\ndifferential effects.\nAlthough, as noted above, some previous prospec-\nbetween smoking and subsequent suicide ideation\ncan largely be explained by baseline risk factors, those\nprevious studies made no attempt to distinguish the\nexplanatory effects of common causes from the\nmediating effects of controls that might have been\nboth consequences of smoking and determinants of\nsubsequent suicide ideation. Our decomposition of\nthese different types of effects is consequently\nespecially useful in showing that the subset of these\nvariables most reasonably conceptualized as common\ncauses account for more of the explanatory effect than\nthe variables that might, at least in part, be mediators.\nThis finding argues against the otherwise plausible\npossibility that the significant gross effects documen-\nted here are due to causal associations of smoking-\nrelated predictors that are mediated by intervening\nmental disorders.\nWe found, in comparison, that our control variables\ndid not explain the statistically significant association\nbetween early-onset nicotine dependence and subse-\nquent suicide plans among ideators. Although this\nfailure might be seen as indirectly arguing that\nnicotine dependence might have a causal effect on\nsuicide plans, the finding that remitted nicotine\ndependence was as strong a predictor as active\nnicotine dependence is inconsistent with this inter-\npretation. A more plausible interpretation in light of\nthis specification is that the determinants of nicotine\ndependence, which are presumably indicated by\nrespondents having either active dependence or a\nhistory of remitted dependence, rather than depen-\ndence itself are the true causal factors. Our failure to\nexplain the association between baseline history of\nearly-onset dependence and subsequent suicide\nplans, under this interpretation, might be seen as\ndue to the fact that we did not measure the actual\ncommon causes of the two variables. It remains for\nfuture research to determine what those common\ncauses might be, but it seems likely based on the\ncurrent results that smoking is not itself of causal\nimportance in this regard, at least in predicting SROs.\nIt is important to reiterate the caution in the\nintroduction, though, that the same results might\nnot hold in predicting suicide deaths, as only a small\nfraction of the people who have SROs go on to\ncomplete suicides and the predictive associations of\nsmoking with suicide deaths might go through\ndifferent causal pathways than those involving SROs.\n"
