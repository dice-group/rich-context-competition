The rate of long-term compli-\ncations of venous thromboembolism\nincluding chronic thromboembolic pulmo-\nnary hypertension after APE2 and PTS\nfrom DVT, may reach 40%.3 Patients\nwith these complications are more likely\nto develop lifelong adverse clinical conse-\nquences and are the most frequently hospi-\ntalized for treatment. In contemporary\nclinical practice, a focus should always be\nplaced on relieving APE symptoms because\nof the lethality of this condition. In most\ncases, treatment of thrombi in the lower\nextremity is initiated only after completion\nof thrombolysis in the pulmonary artery.\nInherently, such management prolongs the\nlysis time, lowers the treatment efficacy, and\nmay miss the best therapeutic window for\nLEDVT (normally 14 days), resulting in a\ndistinct increase in the incidence of PTS.\nFor the treatment of venous thromboembo-\nlism, systemic thrombolysis alone ineffec-\ntively removes thrombi of the deep venous\nsystem; hence, catheter-directed thromboly-\nsis (CDT) with or without percutaneous\nmechanical thrombectomy (PMT) is\nbecoming the standard of medical care in\nthe treatment of acute and subacute proxi-\nmal DVT.4,5 The present prospective study\nwas performed to evaluate the feasibility,\nefficacy and safety of PMT\u00feCDT for con-\ncurrent management of APE and LEDVT.\nMaterials and methods\nStudy population\nThe present study was conducted as an\nopen noncomparative prospective cohort\nSurgery at The Affiliated Hospital of\nQingdao University, HuangDao District,\nShandong, China. Approval for the study\nwas obtained from the ethics committee of\nthe institute, and all patients provided writ-\nten informed consent. The American\nCollege of Chest Physicians Guidelines 9th\nedition6 and the Diagnosis and\nManagement of Acute Pulmonary\nEmbolism of the European Society of\nCardiology7 were used to define whether\nthe diagnoses of LEDVT and APE were\nestablished.\nInclusion criteria\nThe inclusion criteria for the present study\nwere as follows:\na. dyspnea, hypoxia, or hemodynamic\ninstability\nb. evidence of APE by computed tomo-\ngraphic pulmonary angiography or pul-\nmonary arteriography\nc. diagnosis of LEDVT by duplex ultra-\nsound (DUS) or venography\nd. overwhelming symptoms of lower\nextremity swelling, incapacitating pain,\nor phlegmasia dolens, indicating an\nextensive iliocaval or iliofemoral throm-\nbus that is compromising lower limb\nblood flow\ne. APE and LEDVT onset of <14 days\nExclusion criteria\nThe following patients were excluded from\nthe study:\na. patients with asymptomatic LEDVT who\nunderwent conventional anticoagulation\ntreatment at our institution\nb. patients with contraindications to antico-\nagulation or thrombolytic therapy, such\nas a history of major bleeding, recent\ndelivery or major surgery (up to 10 days\nbefore study onset), neurosurgical inter-\nvention (up to 3 months), recent signifi-\ncant trauma, or a disease with a known\nrisk of hemorrhagic complications\nc. patients who refused to participate in\nfollow-up\nd. patients with no APE but with only iso-\nlated infrapopliteal thrombosis, recurrent\nipsilateral LEDVT, pre-existing leg\nulcers, a short life expectancy, or contra-\nindications for the use of contrast media\nAll patients who met the inclusion crite-\nria were included in this study. Patients who\nshowed a rapid deterioration of their car-\ndiopulmonary condition underwent\noxygen supplementation with noninvasive\npressure support or intubation. Positive\ninotropic and vasoactive support with cat-\necholamines was also performed according\nto the patient's hemodynamic condition\nprior to right heart catheterization and pul-\nmonary angiography.\nDefinitions and outcomes\nPrimary outcomes. The primary outcomes of\nthis study were evaluation of safety by cal-\nculation of the major adverse events rate\nand in-hospital death rate and evaluation\nof efficacy by calculation of the clinical suc-\ncess rate and technical success rate.\nClinical success was defined as improve-\nment in the clinical manifestations or a\ndecrease in the vasopressor requirement\nand hemodynamic decompensation in\npatients with APE as well as alleviation of\nlower limb swelling in patients with\nLEDVT, without major adverse events or\nin-hospital death. Digital subtraction pul-\nmonary angiograms obtained at baseline\nand after PMT\u00feCDT of the pulmonary\narteries and lower extremity were reviewed\nby two vascular surgeons and two radiolog-\nists. Technical success was defined as suc-\ncessful placement and withdrawal of the\ndevices and completion of the procedure\nwithout major complications such as perfo-\nration of the pulmonary artery or cardiac\nstructures, tamponade, cerebral vascular\naccident, or death.\nMajor adverse events were defined as\ntreatment-related events requiring surgery\nor transfusion, the need for dialysis, wors-\nening pulmonary artery hypertension, and\nany stroke, hypoxia or shock, and/or peri-\noperative death. Minor adverse events\nwere defined as transient catheter-induced\narrhythmia, mild contrast reactions,\ncatheter-related infection, and small hema-\ntomas not requiring transfusion. A major\nhematoma was defined as a hematoma\nrequiring one or more blood transfusions.\nSecondary outcomes. Secondary outcomes\nwere the pulmonary arterial pressure\n(PAP), partial pressure of oxygen in arterial\nblood, Miller score (MS), thigh and calf cir-\ncumference, shock index, thrombus-lysis\ngrade, and Villalta scale (VS) score.\nThe variation in the pulmonary artery\nindicating the thrombus burden from base-\nline to postoperative digital subtraction\narteriography was assessed by the MS,8\nthe use of which was shifted in the present\nstudy from the traditional emphasis on\nradiological imaging to managing treatment\nbased on physiologic measurements of car-\ndiac function obtained from echocardio-\ngram reading as well as the patient's\nclinical condition.9 The MS was calculated\nby two blinded reviewers. As previously\ndescribed,10 the right and left main pulmo-\nnary arteries are considered to have nine\nand seven major branches, respectively,\nand an embolism in any of these branches\nis scored as 1 point. Each lung is considered\nto have an upper, middle, and lower zone,\nand in each of these three zones, the\nabsence of pulmonary artery flow is\nscored as 3 points; severely reduced flow,\n2 points; mildly reduced flow, 1 point; and\nnormal flow, 0 points. Therefore, the MS\nranges from 0 to 34. We did not classify\nmassive or submassive APE into subgroups.\nWe followed the reporting standard of a\nnational multicenter registry11 that assessed\nthe pre- and post-lysis thrombus effect in\nthe extremity by grading the portion of\nthrombolysis at the completion of treat-\nment as follows: complete (Grade III,\n>90% clearance), near complete (Grade\nII, 50%\u00ad90% clearance), or partial (Grade\nI, <50% clearance). We used DUS to inves-\ntigate venous patency during follow-up.\nOther variables that were analyzed to eval-\nuate the effect of therapy were the PAP,\npartial pressure of oxygen in arterial\nblood, and thigh and calf circumference\nbefore and after treatment. We calculated\nthe mean circumference by measuring the\nthigh circumference 15 cm above the knee\njoint and that of the calf 10 cm below the\ntibial tuberosity. Hemodynamic measure-\nments were obtained before diagnostic angi-\nography was performed and after the\nprocedure. Hemodynamic decompensation\nwas in turn defined as new-onset sustained\nhypotension, a new requirement for ino-\ntropes or vasopressors, or continued or\nworsening hypotension despite treatment.\nProcedures\nAll procedures included four sequential\nsteps: venography, implantation of the infe-\nrior vena cava (IVC) filter, treatment for\nAPE, and treatment for LEDVT. The pro-\ncedures were performed in a hybrid operat-\ning room with a fixed angiography suite,\nand punctures were performed under DUS\nguidance.\nVenography. Before the procedure, the\npatients were diagnosed with LEDVT via\nDUS. The superficial veins were blocked\nby a tourniquet on the ipsilateral ankle,\nand Ultravist (Bayer Schering Pharma,\nBerlin, Germany) diluted 1:1 with saline\nwas manually injected into the ipsilateral\ndorsalis pedis vein at the speed of 2 ml/s\nwhile performing digital subtraction venog-\nraphy. This standard procedure was per-\nformed in all patients to determine the\nproximal and distal extent of the thrombus\nand estimate the overall clot burden.\nImplantation of IVC filter. All patients under-\nwent IVC filter implantation using a stan-\ndard protocol as previously described.12\nAfter sterilizing the contralateral inguinal\narea and perineum, a 6-French sheath was\nplaced into the common iliac vein through a\npuncture in the common femoral vein, and\n20 ml of contrast medium (Ultravist\n300 mg; Bayer Schering Pharma) was\nintravenous bolus dose of unfractionated\nheparin (UFH) (Changzhou Qianhong\nBio-Pharma Co. Ltd., Changzhou, China)\nwas administered followed by continuous\nintravenous infusion of UFH at the rate\nof 1000 U/h through the side port of the\nsheath. The long sheath was then advanced\nto the level of the inferior renal vein, and\nthe IVC filter (OptEase filter; Cordis,\nMiami, FL, USA) was released below the\ninfrarenal level. The accurate positioning of\nthe filter was reconfirmed with venography\nafter completion of the procedure. The filter\nwas inserted via the right jugular route in\none patient with LEDVT in the bilateral\nlower limbs. Under fluoroscopic guidance,\nthe filters were retrieved following the stan-\ndard protocol12 after completion of the\nthrombolytic infusion procedure.\nTreatment for APE. Under local anesthesia, a\n6-French, 10-cm vascular sheath (Terumo\nMedical Corporation, Elkton, MD, USA)\nwas inserted in the ipsilateral femoral vein\nthrough a puncture, and then a 6-French\ncurved pigtail catheter (Cordis\nCorporation, Miami Lakes, FL, USA)\nwas passed by the IVC filter with deliberate\ncalibration and advanced into the main pul-\nmonary artery for pulmonary angiography\n(Figure 1). Digital subtraction\narteriography was subsequently performed\nto confirm the amplitude and magnitude of\nthe thrombus (Figure 1(a)). The intralumi-\nnal PAP was measured with a Swan\u00adGanz\ncatheter (Baxter Healthcare, Irvine, CA,\nUSA) after a satisfactory pulmonary\nartery waveform was recorded. Following\nthe American College of Cardiology para-\ndiameter) was used in the central portion of\nthe pulmonary artery, whereas a 5-French\ncatheter (8-mm diameter) was used in the\nperipheral part of the pulmonary vascular\ntree. Once the embolic occlusion of the pul-\nmonary artery had been passed with\nthe wire, the catheter was manually\nrotated around the axis of the guidewire\n(Figure 1(b)). While rotating, it was repeat-\nedly moved back and forth over several cen-\ntimeters within the clot. This was followed\nby manual clot aspiration via a 20-ml\nsyringe with a Luer Lock connector until\nsufficient fragmentation of the embolus\nwas achieved. After the embolus had been\nfragmented with the rotating pigtail cathe-\nter, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty\n(PTA) was performed through the larger\nsheath if significant thrombosis (>50% of\nthe lumen) was found. During this session,\nthe thromboembolism in the pulmonary\nartery or branches was incompletely dilated\nusing one or two 3- to 6-mm balloon\ncatheters (Admiral Xtreme; INVATEC/\nMedtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA)\nbased on the diameter of the target pulmo-\nnary artery (Figure 1(c)). A balloon cathe-\nter was utilized to crush the thrombus\nattached to the vessel wall. The patient\nthen received an intrapulmonary pulse\nspray thrombolysis injection of urokinase\n(Unifuse, 240 cm; Angiodynamics, Latham,\nNY, USA), and the catheter was retained in\nthe artery for subsequent adjuvant infusion\ntherapy. Pulmonary angiography and PAP\nmeasurement were repeated and recorded\n(Figure 1(f)).\nTreatment for LEDVT. After venography, we\npunctured the contralateral common femo-\nral vein or the mildly thrombosed vein if\nboth lower extremities were thrombosed\n(Figure 2(a)). A 6-French Balkin sheath\n(Cook Medical Inc., Bloomingdale, IN,\nUSA) was introduced to cross the bifurca-\ntion of the IVC and placed in the ipsilateral\niliac vein. If severe iliac vein stenosis\n(>70%) was found, an Admiral Xtreme\nINVATEC/Medtronic) was used to predi-\nlate the lesion. After placement of a 0.035-\ninch guidewire (Terumo Medical, Tokyo,\nJapan), a 4-French vertebral catheter\n(Angiodynamics) was retrogradely\nadvanced via the iliac vein, femoral vein,\npopliteal vein, and calf vein to penetrate\nthe thrombus. We performed contrast\nvenous angiography to reconfirm the\nedge of the thrombosis (Figure 2(b)).\nThe vertebral catheter was then exchanged\nfor an Admiral Xtreme balloon catheter\nMedtronic). The balloon catheter was used\nto pre-dilate the venous lumen (Figure 2\n(c)). Next, a 4- or 5-French multi-side\nhole thrombolytic catheter (Unifuse;\nFigure 1.

The\npulmonary arterial pressure was 52/22 (mean, 37) mmHg, and the Miller score was 18. (b) After initial\ncatheter fragmentation of the right lobe artery via a 6-French pigtail catheter, the embolus dislodged and\npartially diminished.

The thrombolytic cath-\neter was repositioned via the guidewire to\nensure that the treatment zone traversed the\nentire clot and the tip exited the thrombus.\nThe catheter was retained in the veins for\nadjuvant infusion therapy, and we typically\nobtained a final venograph to reconfirm\nthat the clot burden had been alleviated\nbefore all instruments were withdrawn\n(Figure 2(e), (f)).\nPostoperative and follow-up management\nIn the clinical ward, each patient was\ninstructed to move the ankle joint at regular\nintervals. The patients' medical records\nFigure 2. Low extremity venogram images from the same patient as in Figure 1.

A total of\nBio-Pharma Co. Ltd.) was given through\nthe side port of the two sheaths (each\npumping to bathe the clot along the cathe-\nter. An angiogram was obtained every 24\nhours to assess the clot burden and treat-\nment efficacy. Blood samples were taken\nevery 12 hours to measure the hematocrit\nlevel, hemoglobin level, active partial\nthromboplastin time, fibrinogen level, and\nplatelet count to adjust the UFH dose and\ndetect blood loss.\nDose adjustment was performed accor-\ndance with the laboratory results: a throm-\nbolytic dose reduction was performed when\nthe fibrinogen level was <1.5 g/L, and\nthrombolysis was discontinued when the\nfibrinogen level was <1 g/L. After throm-\nbolysis, additional adjunctive procedures\n(angioplasty or stent implantation) were\nperformed if an underlying vein stenosis of\n>70% was present. Postprocedure venogra-\nphy was performed before removing the\nintroducer. All patients continued to receive\nanticoagulation therapy (low-molecular-\nweight heparin followed by warfarin) to\npreserve an international normalized ratio\nof 2 to 3. Low-dose aspirin was prescribed\nfor three months for patients who under-\nwent stent implantation. All filters were\nremoved within 4 weeks. After discharge,\noral anticoagulation with warfarin was con-\ntinued concomitant with the use of gradu-\nated elastic compression stockings. Clinical\nfollow-up by the referring physician includ-\ned physical examination, color Doppler\nDUS, and measurement of the international\nnormalized ratio in all patients. Evaluation\nof PTS was performed in compliance with\nthe modified VS.14 The clinical evaluation\noutcomes were classified as follows: severe\nPTS was defined as a total score of >14\npoints or a venous ulcer, mild PTS was\ndefined as 5 to 14 points, and no PTS was\ndefined as <5 points.15 Venous patency was\nclassified as complete recanalization for a\nminimal recanalization for <50% due to\nresidual stenosis or an organized\nStatistical analysis\nStandard statistical tests were used to ana-\nlyze discrete data. Discrete variables are\nreported as numbers with percentages, and\ncontinuous data are reported as mean and\nstandard deviation. Paired t-tests were used\nto analyze continuous data, and the chi-\nsquare test or Fisher's exact test was used\nto compare nominal variables. Statistical\nsignificance was set at P<0.05. The\nKaplan\u00adMeier method was used to analyze\ntime-to-event survival data. All statistical\ntests were performed using GraphPad\nInStat (version 11.5; GraphPad Software,\nInc., La Jolla, CA, USA).\nResults\nBaseline demographic profile\nTwenty consecutive patients diagnosed with\nAPE and LEDVT were enrolled in this\nstudy.

In the present study, we\ndemonstrated the following. First, PMT\ncombined with CDT rapidly improved the\npatients' hemodynamic parameters and\nclinical manifestations and provided a sat-\nisfactory outcome for patients with APE\nassociated with LEDVT. Second, this\none-step endovascular strategy involving\nsimultaneous treatment of thrombi in the\npulmonary arteries and lower extremity\ndeep veins is a novel but feasible and effi-\ncient algorithm, and it may have a potential\nrole in preventing long-term sequelae of\npulmonary hypertension or chronic venous\nobstruction. However, to the best of our\nknowledge, no previous reports have\ndescribed one-step treatment of APE com-\nplicated with LEDVT using PMT\u00feCDT or\npharmacomechanical therapy.\nDespite the improvement in diagnostic\nand therapeutic modalities, contemporary\nin-hospital mortality of patients with APE\nis still approximately 20%.18 Similarly, PTS\nor chronic thromboembolic pulmonary\nHowever, the treatments for APE and\nLEDVT are separate in most studies. APE\nis typically secondary to exfoliation of an\nembolus that originally colonized a periph-\neral deep vein, but physicians usually take\nAPE into consideration first because of its\nhighly lethal nature. LEDVT must then be\ntreated in the second step, and the patient\nmay therefore miss the best treatment time\nwindow and develop an organized throm-\nbus. We performed the herein-described\none-step pharmacomechanical therapy to\nreduce venous pressure overload in the\nearly period and minimize the risk of\nlong-term complications. Inherently, more\neffort is required to lyse a chronic thrombus\nthan a fresh one, and early recanalization\nreduces the incidence of chronic thrombo-\nembolic pulmonary hypertension or\nLEDVT require early treatment. We per-\nform interventions for LEDVT when the\nthrombus is found mainly above the knee\n(femoral venous thrombosis) because a clot\nin this part of the body often leads to phle-\nbostenosis22 after discharge. If the throm-\nbus is just located in the veins below the\nknee, we simply perform intravenous\nthrombolysis and anticoagulation. The\nstandard CDT procedure we applied in\nthis study was described in a previously\npublished article.23,24 We also used a bal-\nloon catheter to crush large clots into\nsmaller ones during the thrombolytic ther-\napy. Based on our experience, monitoring\nfibrinogen every 12 hours is sufficient, and\nwe achieved a good cost-effective outcome.\nThere still no generally accepted protocol\nfor monitoring fibrinogen, but some schol-\nars have recommended a frequency of every\nPMT is used to relieve pulmonary\nthromboembolic lesions and was first\nreported about two decades ago, initially\nusing a pigtail rotation catheter.13,26 The\nmain concept of this technique is to crush\nthe clots in the pulmonary arteries, causing\nfragmentation and distal migration of the\nsmaller fragments. The fragments have a\ngreater surface area that is exposed to the\nthrombolytic agent, thus improving the\nresults of lytic activity and allowing for\nreductions in the dose and infusion time.\nMore recent case series have demonstrated\nthat outcomes have been improving as the\ntechnique has been refined.27\u00ad29 Piazza et\nwith APE who were treated with an\nultrasound-facilitated system (EKOS\nEndoWaveV\nR ; EKOS Medical, Bothell,\nWA) and CDT. Fifteen (10% of all)\nmajor bleeding events occurred in their\nseries, whereas only two cases of moderate\nbleeding (10% of all) occurred in the pre-\nsent study. This result may have been due to\nthe fact that two baseline indexes, the mean\nhigher in their study than in ours, indicating\nmore severe embolism. In our study, seven\n(35%) patients had Grade III lysis, eight\nhad Grade I lysis after infusion, which is\nin agreement with the results found in the\nliterature.30,31 Few studies have reported on\npatency after 6 months. According to a\nCochrane review,32 the patency rates vary\ncations range from 0% to 11%, and the rate\nof PTS ranges from 3% to 48%. We iden-\ntified a low PTS rate (10%) and low major\nbleeding rate (0%) in our study, which may\nbe attributed to the decrease in the\nthrombolysis dose due to prompt thrombus\nfragmentation (PMT\u00fePTA); however, this\nconclusion is limited by the small study\nsample. Compared with CDT alone, PMT\nhas been shown to result in similar levels of\nclot removal but with a significant reduc-\ntion in the infusion time and total dose of\nthrombolytic, thus potentially reducing\nadverse bleeding events and low-dose\nthrombolysis; it has also been shown to\nreduce PTS recurrence.4,5 This is why we\nconducted PMT\u00feCDT in our study.\nAlthough numerous devices have been\nrecently developed for pharmacomechani-\ncal thrombolysis, we performed mechanical\nthrombectomy by manual rotation and\naspiration using pigtail catheters. This is a\nrelatively elementary practice. Newly devel-\noped catheters such as the rotating motor-\nized system (CLEANER XT; Argon\nMedical Devices, Plano, TX, USA), rheo-\nlytic instruments (AngioJet system; Boston\nScientific, Marlborough, MA, USA), or\nultrasound-facilitated systems (EKOS\nEndoWave) are not available to us.\nHowever, Lin et al.33 demonstrated no sig-\nnificant difference in the thrombus removal\nrate during pharmacomechanical thrombol-\nysis between the AngioJet system and CDT\nin the management of LEDVT. Indeed,\nmultiple devices are available to perform\nPMT. We believe that these new and spe-\ncially designed pharmacomechanical\nthrombolysis devices may surpass manual\nmechanical thrombus fragmentation.\nHowever, the most effective strategy ulti-\nmately relies on the physician's knowledge\nof each device and specific patient charac-\nteristics to determine which device offers\nthe best risk\u00adbenefit ratio. Mechanical\nthrombus fragmentation still plays a role\nin APE and LEDVT management because\nit is readily available and has a high cost\u00ad\nbenefit ratio.\nThe IVC filter plays a small but crucial\nrole in the procedure because it prevents\nrecurrence of APE. The advantage of the\nIVC filter remains controversial, however.\nWe inserted the IVC filter with this consid-\neration. First, all of the patients in this\nstudy had been diagnosed with APE,\nwhich is the indication for implantation of\nan IVC filter as recommended by estab-\nlished guidelines.7,34 Second, the incidence\nof the thrombus falling off during percuta-\nneous CDT is high; thus, an IVC filter is\nrationally placed to prevent APE recur-\nrence. However, it must be emphasized\nthat misplacement or malpositioning of\nthe filter may cause IVC perforation, and\nthe IVC filter itself can cause recurrent\nthrombogenesis.35 We therefore choose the\nOptEase filter because of its olive-like shape\nand lack of a sharp claw configuration\nrather than filters such as the Gunther\nTulip (Cook Medical Inc.). We placed the\nfilter with extraordinary precaution. All\nmotions were as slight as possible to con-\nfirm that the filter had been placed in\nthe optimal position when the catheter\npassed it.\nWe did not use venous stents because the\nonly available venous stent in our institu-\ntion is the Wallstent (Boston Scientific),\nwhich has a steel weave helical design, is\nsoft in structure, and is not suitable for\nstiff chronic venous stenosis such as that\nin patients with iliac vein compression syn-\ndrome. However, we used a Luminexx stent\n(Bard, Inc.) because this stent is made by\nlaser cutting and provides a better braced\nforce with which to prop the stenosis. We\nhave performed 300 Luminexx stent\nimplantations in patients with venous ste-\nnosis with patient follow-up every 6\nmonths. The outcome is very promising:\n90% of patients maintained patency, and\n>70% of them had complete patency\n(>90% true luminal cavity) at the 1-year\nfollow-up. However, the need for a specially\ndesigned stent in the treatment of phlebos-\ntenosis is obvious. We anticipate the future\ndevelopment of more effective venous\nstents.\nLimitations\nThe major limitation of our study was the\nlack of a comparator group. Because we did\nnot include a comparator group, we cannot\ndirectly compare on the efficacy or safety of\nPMT\u00feCDT versus CDT in APE or\nLEDVT alone. In addition, the number of\npatients enrolled was not large.\nConclusion\nOur prospective study has demonstrated\nthe successful treatment of patients with\nAPE and LEDVT via PMT and CDT.\nThe results showed significant improve-\nments in hemodynamics and respiratory\nparameters, good short- and long-term\npatency, and a low PTS rate, indicating\nthat this is a low-risk and promising strate-\ngy for treatment of acute venous thrombo-\nembolism. A large-scale collaborative\nprospective study is needed to confirm the\nefficacy and safety of this one-step treat-\nment algorithm.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis study was supported by a grant from The\nYouth Fund of the Affiliated Hospital of\nReferences\n1.
