In addition, case reporting\nand selection biases may contribute to the marked racial disparities\nseen for syphilis, in which blacks are disproportionately affected.4\nBlacks may be more likely to attend public clinics where case\nreporting is thought to be most complete, and may be overrepre-\nsented at the limited sites where screening occurs. We analyzed\ndata from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys\nserologic tests for syphilis among a representative sample of the\nMethods\nStudy Population and Survey Design\nducted by the National Center for Health Statistics.5 Each year, a\ncomplex, stratified, multistage probability sample design was used\nto select a representative sample of the civilian, noninstitutional-\nized US population of all ages. Race/ethnicity categories in\nNHANES were defined by self-report as non-Hispanic (NH) white,\nNH black, and Mexican-American. Persons who did not fit into\none of these categories, including those who reported being \"mul-\ntiracial\" were classified as \"other\" and included in the total pop-\nulation. NH blacks and Mexican-Americans were sampled at a\nhigher rate compared with other racial/ethnic groups to allow\nsufficient sample sizes for analysis.\nEach survey participant was interviewed and underwent a stan-\ndardized health examination and biologic specimen collection.\nData on sexual behavior were collected using audio computer-\nassisted self-interview, and sex was defined as vaginal, oral, or\nanal sex. NHANES participants were not asked about a prior\nclinical diagnosis of syphilis. All participants tested for syphilis\nThe authors thank Martha Fears and Susan Kikkert for their laboratory\nwork.

Written, informed consent\nwas obtained from all survey participants.\nLaboratory Methods\nwere evaluated at CDC using serologic tests for syphilis infection\naccording to a standardized algorithm based on screening with a\ntreponemal test, a strategy found to have favorable performance in\nother settings.6\u00ad8 Detailed methods for all laboratory tests in the\nalgorithm, including cut-off values for positive and indeterminate\nresults, are documented on the NHANES Web site.9 All specimens\nwere first tested for syphilis IgG treponemal antibody using an\nCaptia Syphilis-G EIA was used.10\u00ad12 However, because of avail-\nability issues with the Captia test, during November 2002, all EIA\ntesting was switched to the Trep-Chek Syphilis EIA.13,14 Perfor-\nmance of the two EIA tests was comparable on internal quality\nassurance evaluations (side-by-side testing). Specimens with pos-\nitive or indeterminate EIAs (of either type) underwent nontrepo-\nnemal rapid plasma reagin (RPR) testing.15,16 Specimens with\nnonreactive RPRs or RPR titers 1:8 underwent confirmatory\ntesting with Treponema pallidum particle agglutination (TP-PA).17\nThe algorithm for defining a final determination of syphilis\ninfection was as follows. Specimens with a positive or indetermi-\nnate EIA and an RPR titer 1:8 were considered to be positive for\nsyphilis, and more likely to reflect recent infection. Specimens\nwith a positive or indeterminate EIA, a nonreactive RPR or an\nRPR titer 1:8, and a positive TP-PA were considered to be\npositive for syphilis, and more likely to reflect remote infection.\nSpecimens with a negative EIA or a negative TP-PA were con-\nsidered to be negative for recent or remote syphilis infection.\nStatistical Analyses\nSUDAAN software version 9.0 (Research Triangle Institute,\nCary, NC) was used for statistical analyses to incorporate sampling\nweights and account for the clustered sample design in calculating\nvariance estimates based on a Taylor Series approximation. All\nseroprevalence estimates were weighted to represent the total US\ncivilian, noninstitutionalized population and to account for over-\nsampling and nonresponse to the household interview and physical\nexamination. We estimated weighted syphilis seroprevalence over-\nall and by selected demographic and behavioral variables. Bivari-\nate significance tests for association were based on a Wald 2\nstatistic with 2-sided P-values. The confidence intervals for the\nprevalence estimates were calculated using the Clopper-Pearson\nmethod.18,19 The critical values used for the confidence intervals\nwere based on the t-distribution, with degrees of freedom equal to\nthe number of strata minus the number of primary sampling units.\nRelative standard errors (RSEs) were computed for each\nweighted estimate as (SE/Estimate)*100. An RSE 30% is\nconsidered unstable and the corresponding estimate should be\ninterpreted cautiously.\nWe also performed a weighted analysis of the positive predic-\ntive value (PPV) of the EIA screening test, alone and in combi-\nnation with RPR results, for a final determination of syphilis\ninfection as defined by our laboratory testing algorithm. The PPV\nwas defined as the proportion of initially positive tests that were\nultimately determined to represent syphilis infection, after ac-\nResults\nA total of 25, 917 individuals were selected to participate in\nspecimens underwent syphilis EIA testing; testing algorithm re-\nsults are shown in Figure 1.

Table 1 shows overall syphilis seroprevalence (both recent\nand remote infection) according to selected characteristics.

Small\nnumbers of men reporting a history of a same-sex sex partner and\nthose reporting homosexual, bisexual, or \"other\" sexual identity\nlimited our ability to make reliable estimates of syphilis seropreva-\nlence among men who have sex with men (MSM). Although\nsyphilis seroprevalence was slightly higher among men who had a\nhistory of a same-sex sex partner (1.4%) and among those who\nself-identified as nonheterosexual (2.2%) compared with those\nwho did not (0.6% for each), these differences were not statisti-\ncally significant. Among the 28 NHANES participants with a\npositive HIV test, syphilis seroprevalence was 13.3%.\nTable 2 shows the PPV of the EIA screening test, alone and in\ncombination with RPR results, for a final determination of syphilis\ninfection as defined by our laboratory algorithm. Of 112 specimens\nwith positive EIAs, 69 were ultimately determined to be positive\nfor syphilis, yielding a weighted PPV of 48%. In other words, 52%\nof all positive screening EIAs were ultimately deemed to be false\npositives. All 28 specimens with a positive EIA and a reactive RPR\n(titer 1:1) were determined to be positive for syphilis (PPV:\nnonreactive RPRs had syphilis (PPV: 37%). Of 14 specimens with\nindeterminate EIAs, only 1 (with an RPR titer of 1:4) had syphilis.\nDiscussion\nWe found that the prevalence of syphilis seroreactivity was low\n(0.71%) in the general, noninstitutionalized US population of 18-\nto 49-year-olds. However, there were marked racial disparities in\nsyphilis infections, with NH blacks disproportionately affected.\nThis nationally representative survey supports surveillance data;\ncase reporting and selection biases are unlikely to play a major role\nin explaining apparent racial disparities.4 Because positive trepo-\nnemal serologic tests are a marker for lifetime syphilis infection,\nthe magnitude of disparity among racial/ethnic groups does not\nnecessarily reflect current differences in syphilis infections, but\nrather differences in cumulative incidence for each group over the\nprevious approximately 15 to 20 years. The magnitude of the\ndifferences between NH blacks and NH whites in NHANES\nsurveillance data, where the black:white rate ratio was 62:1. It\nis encouraging that the black:white rate ratio in surveillance\nAlthough progress has been made in reducing racial disparities\nin syphilis in recent years, reports of outbreaks and increased\nnumbers of primary and secondary syphilis cases among MSM\nhave been on the rise.20\u00ad23 In fact, currently more than 60% of new\nsyphilis infections are estimated to occur in MSM.23 In our anal-\nysis, small numbers of MSM made precise syphilis seroprevalence\nestimates unreliable. Syphilis seroprevalence appeared to be higher\nin MSM, but differences by MSM status were not statistically\nsignificant. Since we evaluated lifetime syphilis infections that\nmay have occurred over many years, recent increases may not have\nbeen as apparent. In addition, the NHANES surveys are not\nwell-suited for evaluating low prevalence diseases like syphilis in\nsmall subpopulations such as MSM that have not been explicitly\noversampled. Groups of MSM with high-risk behavior and high\nsyphilis rates that are localized within a few urban centers may be\nmissed with the broad, population-based sampling for NHANES.\nIn addition to evaluating seroprevalence, we used the NHANES\ndata to evaluate laboratory screening with treponemal tests. Tra-\nditionally, testing for syphilis in the United States has relied on\nscreening with a nontreponemal test followed by a confirmatory\ntreponemal test. However, many sites in the United States are\nadopting initial screening with treponemal tests, instead of non-\ntreponemal tests, because of economic and logistical consider-\nations,24 and several have documented that treponemal-based\nscreening algorithms are a reasonable alternative to algorithms\nbased on nontreponemal screening, with comparable sensitivity,\nspecificity, and predictive values.6\u00ad8 Screening with our trepone-\nmal testing algorithm identified 41 specimens that were deter-\nmined to be positive for syphilis (59% of all those found), which\nwould have been missed with nontreponemal RPR screening.\nSome of these may have represented either very early or very\nlongstanding latent syphilis infection, situations that might still\nbenefit from therapy. However, lack of information on prior diag-\nnosis and treatment makes it unclear whether these had clinical or\npublic health importance. The PPV of screening EIA in our as-\nsessment was 48%. Even with very specific treponemal tests, we\nwould predict a substantial number of false positives in a very low\nprevalence population, so the PPV we observed was not out of the\nrange of what might be expected. When a positive screening EIA\nwas followed by a reactive RPR (of any titer), the PPV was 100%\nfor a final determination of syphilis infection, suggesting that\nconfirmation with another treponemal test would not be necessary\nin this scenario. However, the PPV of the screening EIA was much\nlower if the follow-up RPR was nonreactive. In this scenario,\nconfirmatory testing might be helpful, although interpretation of\nresults is not always clear. Although a positive second treponemal\ntest would likely confirm a syphilis infection, a negative second\nEIA testing\nRPR reactive\nRPR nonreactive\nTP-PA testing\nTP-PA positive\n-PA negative\nMore likely\nof infection\nEIA testing\nRPR reactive\nRPR nonreactive\nTP -PA testing\nTP-PA positive\nTP -PA negative\nPositive for syphilis,\nmore likely remote infection\nEIA positive\nEIA indeterminate\nEIA negative\nRPR testing\nNo evidence\nof infection\nEIA positive\nEIA indeterminate\nEIA negative\nRPR testing\nNegative\nfor syphilis\nNegative\nfor syphilis\nPositive for syphilis,\nmore likely remote infection\nPositive for syphilis,\nmore likely recent infection\nFig. 1.

All 19 specimens with an RPR\nnonreactive specimens.\ntreponemal test might represent a false positive on the first test or\na false negative on the second; for purposes of our analysis, we\nassumed the first test to be falsely positive. Use of treponemal tests\nfor syphilis screening will require careful consideration of clinical\nand therapeutic histories when treponemal tests are positive in the\nsetting of nonreactive nontreponemal tests.\nOur analysis had several limitations. First, low prevalence led to\nunstable estimates for many subpopulations, including NH whites\nand MSM. Second, syphilis treponemal seroreactivity indicates\ninfection at any time over a lifetime, and so these estimates do not\nshed light on new or untreated syphilis infections in recent years.\nCategorization as \"recent\" or \"remote\" infection using RPR titer\nwill undoubtedly result in misclassification, and the number of\ninfections we identified with RPR titers 1:8 was too small to\nmake reliable estimates. Third, no information about a reported\nhistory of diagnosed or treated syphilis was available; thus, we\ncould not determine the extent of undiagnosed syphilis infections\nin the United States. Finally, the previous assessment of national\nvolved a nontreponemal-based screening algorithm using 3 differ-\nent tests from those used in the current assessment, including the\nautomated reagin test, which has not been available as a nontrepo-\nnemal screening test for years.25,26 Because of this, and the fact\nthat race/ethnicity was categorized differently in NHANES II, we\nfelt we could not accurately evaluate trends in syphilis seroreac-\ntivity over time.\nIn conclusion, we found a low prevalence of lifetime syphilis\ninfection in the general population of US 18- to 49-year-olds.\nHowever, consistent with surveillance findings, these nationally\nrepresentative data underscore the disproportionate impact of\nsyphilis on NH blacks in the United States. Although the racial gap\nin syphilis infections has narrowed substantially since the 1990s,4\ncontinued efforts to minimize these racial disparities remain a\nmajor national priority.2 Future efforts will also need to address the\nburgeoning epidemic of syphilis among MSM.\nTABLE 1.
