The CKD prevalent area covers approximately\nlion (Figure 1; Chandrajith et al., 2010). CKD is the most\nprevalent among male farmers in the 40 to 60 age group\nengaged in rice cultivation, although lately, it has also been\ndetected among women, children, and even cattle (Centre for\nThere is scientific consensus that this fatal disease in Sri\nLanka is not related to known causes commonly identified\nwith kidney disease, such as, diabetes, hypertension, obesity,\nor other factors such as snake bite (World Health Organization\n[WHO] & Ministry of HealthCare and Nutrition,\nEpidemiology Unit, Sri Lanka, 2009). The exact cause of this\ndisease is being determined. The WHO and the Sri Lankan\ngovernment continue to designate it as \"Chronic Kidney\nDisease of Unknown Etiology\" (CKDu; WHO & Ministry of\nHealthcare and Nutrition, 2009). This rare form of tubule-\ninterstitial disease involves slow, asymptomatic progressive\nkidney damage over 3 or more months, making diagnosis\nand treatment difficult. Nearly 80% of patients experience\ntotal kidney failure within 2 years following diagnosis. Given\nthe inadequacy of medical services, the high cost of treat-\nment--dialysis and organ transplantation--and the poverty\nof most victims, death becomes inevitable for most\nA group of Sri Lankan doctors estimates that as many as\nhave died from CKD over the past 2 decades in the NCP with\nat least 5 or 6 out of 100 people there currently affected\n(N. Gunawardena, 2012). In other words, more people in the\nNCP have died from CKD than from the armed conflict in\nSri Lanka (Rathnasooriya, 2009). Some have speculated,\nwithout any evidence, that given the proximity of the NCP to\nthe region claimed by Tamil secessionists, CKD could well\nbe the result of bioterrorism--calculated use of micro-organ-\nisms to bring ill health or death to humans and the environ-\nment (Weerasekara, n.d.). In contrast to the bloody 30-year\nsecessionist war (which ended in May 2009) and post-con-\nflict politics, which continue to draw national and interna-\ntional attention, the structural violence of poverty and\nenvironmental destruction underlying CKD has received\nrelatively little attention.

This focus has\ndelayed action on immediate health and social needs of\npatients and their families. It has also contributed to a rela-\ntive neglect of the broader political-economic and social-\npsychological dimensions of the problem; an exception is the\nwork of Chandani Liyanage and Ramanie Jayathilaka\n(Liyanage & Jayathilaka, 2009). In Sri Lanka, CKD is com-\nmonly seen from a limited perspective as an isolated issue\nparticular to the island's dry zone agricultural region. Its\nlocal designation is \"Rajarata Kidney Disease,\" Rajarata\n(country of the kings) being the ancient Sinhala name for the\ndry zone agricultural civilization (Rathnasooriya, 2009).\nCKD is not commonly found in other rural areas of the coun-\ntry that have rice cultivation practices and lifestyles similar\nto the north central dry zone. Some researchers consider the\n\"unique hydrochemistry of the drinking water\" in the\nRajarata to be the reason for the prevalence of CKD\n(Chandrajith et al., 2011). Other researchers consider the\n\"hardness of the ground water\" and the \"heavy metal reten-\ntion capacity\" of the soil in the region to be the causative\nThis article is based largely on a review of the literature\non CKD in Sri Lanka. While incorporating the findings of\nbio-medical research, it seeks to provide a broader interdisci-\nplinary and global approach to CKD. It draws on the theo-\nretical perspectives of political economy, international\ndevelopment, ecology, and environmental justice as well as\ncomparative information of spreading CKD in agricultural\nregions in Nicaragua and India. The Sri Lankan case is\nplaced within the context of globalization and unsustainable\neconomic development, specifically industrialization of agri-\nculture and the widespread use of controversial agrochemi-\ncals. The article concludes emphasizing organic agriculture\nand access to safe water and food as the long-term solutions\nto CKD in Sri Lanka and related problems of public health\nand environmental sustainability worldwide.\nThe literature review and theoretical approach of this\nstudy are informed by many years of fieldwork. The study\nhas its origin in the late 1990s in the author's work in\nSri Lanka as a consultant to the Sarvodaya Women's\nMovement (Sarvodaya is considered to be the largest village-\nbased NGO in the world) and its organic cultivation and\nincome generation program for women. The author's field\nresearch and Report for Care International on Integrated Pest\nManagement in Sri Lanka in 1998 has greatly helped this\nwork (Bandarage, 1998). The author first came into contact\nwith kidney patients, kidney donors, and doctors in the\nKidney Unit of the Kandy hospital in Sri Lanka in 2005.\nSince then, she has been investigating CKD through discus-\nsions with kidney patients, donors, scientists, physicians, and\nenvironmental and health rights activists in Sri Lanka\n(Bandarage, 2005). The research has benefitted greatly from\ncommunication with colleagues in activist organizations,\nsuch as, the Center for Environmental Justice, an affiliate of\nFriends of Earth International in Sri Lanka and the Kandy\nKidney Protection Society, an NGO that was organized\nlargely by volunteer doctors.\nSpreading CKD\nCKD is rising at an alarming rate in Sri Lanka, but the exact\nextent is difficult to determine given that many people may\nnot be receiving hospital treatment. There is an estimated 2%\nto 3% prevalence rate in all affected provinces with a 15%\nFigure 1. CKD prevalent areas in Sri Lanka.\nSource. Adapted from Chandrajith et al. (2010).\nBandarage 3\nprevalence rate in the 15 to 70 age group in the NCP and Uva\nadmissions due to all diseases of the genitourinary system in\nSri Lanka doubled with hospital deaths due to such diseases\n2012 Report from the CSE in New Delhi, India noted, \"CKD\nhas been the predominant contributor to this rise in hospital\nmorbidity and mortality\" (CSE, 2012)., According to the\nrelated deaths occur in hospitals annually. However, the total\nnumber of deaths due to CKD could be as much as 1,400\nannually nationwide because home deaths are not included\nin death registries (Athuralia, Abeysekara, Amerasinghe,\nKumarasiri, & Dissanayake, 2009; A. Gunawardena, n.d.).\nSri Lanka has a relatively comprehensive and free public\nstate health care system but finds it difficult to keep pace\nwith the alarming rate of growth of CKD. Current dialysis\nunits can serve only a small proportion of patients and exist-\ning facilities are considered to be grossly inadequate. About\n5% of the Annual Health Budget is spent on the management\nWHO & Ministry of Healthcare and Nutrition, 2009). Many\nmore dialysis machines and other equipment and services are\nneeded to meet the growing demand (N. Gunawardena,\n2012). The Kandy Kidney Protection Society points out that\n\"awareness programs regarding prevention, screening pro-\ngrams for early diagnosis, provision of financial and other\nsupport for needy patients, improvement of infrastructure\nand promotion of kidney donations for transplant have to be\ncarried out in a well organized manner\" (Kandy Kidney\nProtection Society, n.d.)\nIn 2005, a kidney patient had to spend approximately\n(Gunatilleke, 2012). Lacking funds, patients pour into the\nkidney units of the few public hospitals that provide free kid-\nney dialysis and transplants. The vast majority of the patients\nwho come there are so poor that many of them have to forego\nsome of the procedures and medications that require pay-\nment. The dialysis patients have to come several times a\nweek traveling great distances. Being too weak to travel\nalone, they come with family members. Frequently after\ndialysis, some of the patients and their families sleep together\non the hospital floors because there are not enough beds.\nWhen a breadwinner develops kidney disease and can no\nlonger work, the entire family goes into financial ruin and\ndebt. In some cases, children have had to forego schooling to\nfind employment and women have had to engage in prostitu-\ntion for economic survival (Bandarage, 2005).\nMany patients wait years in pain and agony and many die\ndue to chronic shortage of kidneys (Bandarage, 2013b). Due\nto the \"frantic and sometimes futile search by desperate vic-\ntims . . . to find a donor with a matching kidney,\" doctors in\nthe Kandy Teaching Hospital have initiated new efforts, such\nas \"double transplants\" with four patients, two kidney donors\nand two recipients side by side (Hettiarachchi, 2011).\nAccording to the WHO, organ trafficking accounts for 5% to\n10% of all kidney transplants in the world (Budiani-Saberi &\nDelmonico, 2008). Kidney sales and all organ sales are ille-\ngal in Sri Lanka. Until September 2010, kidney donations\nwere accepted only from relatives and members of the clergy.\nThe desperate need for kidneys led to the change in govern-\nment policy allowing kidney donations by non-relatives\nBuddhist monks, many of them young men and from rural\nagricultural communities themselves, continue to be the pre-\ndominant kidney donors. Like the patients, these monks have\nhardly any money or material possessions; but their compas-\nsion and generosity are enormous. As one mother whose son\nwas to receive a kidney said of his donor monk, \"he is not\ndoing it for money. I can only bless him as I have nothing to\ngive.\" The donor monk responded, \"I thought about the\nimpermanence of life and how our bodies will anyway\nbe absorbed to the soil one day. If one can make a sacrifice\nwhen we are alive, one can gain some spiritual happiness\"\n(Chavkin, 2012b). Such selflessness is the most admirable,\nbut long-term solutions to CKD require attention to scientific\ncontroversies and the political economy of the disease.\nIdentifying the Cause\nDespite its emergence more than 20 years ago, the mystery\nsurrounding the Rajarata Kidney Disease has not yet been\nresolved. People fear attending medical clinics due to the\nstigma attached to being classified as a \"kidney patient\" car-\nrying the dreaded CKD. This has contributed in part to delays\nin understanding the origins and spread of CKD\n(Kulatungaarachchi, 2011). The scientific community con-\ntinues to be perplexed as to why CKD is peculiar to the north\ncentral region and not the other rural areas of the country that\nhave similar rice cultivation practices and lifestyles includ-\ning extensive use of agrochemicals and aluminum utensils\nfor cooking and storing water (Chandrajith et al., 2011). A\nstudy published in 2011 comparing three rural populations in\nMedawachchciya in the NCP, Yatinuwara in the Central\nProvince (CP), and Hambantota in the Southern Province\n(SP) concluded that while CKD of an \"unknown etiology\"\nwas prevalent in the NCP, known risk factors, notably diabe-\ntes and long-standing hypertension were the main factors for\nCKD in the other two provinces in Sri Lanka (Athuralia\net al., 2011). As the national controversy over the cause of\nthe Rajarata kidney disease expands, the disease's etiology\ncontinues to be classified as \"unidentified\" (Mendis, 2012b).\nA study by a team of Sri Lankan scientists published in\nApril 2009 attributed CKD to heavy metals from various\nforms of fertilizers and agrochemicals entering the human\nbody through the food chain (Chandrajith et al., 2010).\nSeveral other studies of the north central region revealed\nCKD prevalence in areas where drinking water was drawn\nfrom the ground from wells or pipelines and non-prevalence\n4 SAGE Open\nof CKD in areas where drinking water was obtained from\nAnother study published in January 2010 by a team of\nSri Lankan and Japanese scientists hypothesized that \"the\nunique hydrogeochemistry of the drinking water,\" specifi-\ncally high levels of fluoride, to be the decisive factor in the\nemergence of the disease in the north central region\n(Chandrajith et al., 2011). Aluminum utensils used for cook-\ning and storing water, which enhance fluoride intake into the\nbody, and Cynotoxin that comes from blue green algae have\nalso been hypothesized as possible causes (CSE, 2012;\nThe high temperatures in the dry zone and the need to\nconsume higher volumes of water to regulate water balance\nby farmers working long hours have also been postulated as\nfactors in CKD (Chandrajith et al., 2010). Global warming,\nclimate change, and increasing droughts and water shortages\nin Sri Lanka's dry zone may not bode well for the eradication\nof CKD. As a researcher from Sri Lanka's University of\nPeradeniya who co-authored a 2011 Report on CKD put it,\n\"if the temperatures are going up, the situation is likely to\nworsen\" (Perera, 2012b). The Government Ministry of the\nEnvironment has reported 1,400 droughts island wide\nAccording to the Climate Change Unit of the Ministry, tem-\nperatures in the island have risen by about 0.45\u00b0 Celsius in\nthe past two decades (Perera, 2012c). In some of the CKD\nprevalent areas, such as, the Polonnaruwa District, tempera-\ntures have reached record levels of 34\u00b0 to 35\u00b0 Celsius (Perera,\nResearch findings released in January 2011 by scientists\nin the Medicine and Allied Science Faculty of the Rajarata\nUniversity in the NCP concluded that the \"contamination of\nwater resources by extensive and continuous use of agro-\nchemicals\" that contain high percentages of arsenic and mer-\ncury are the causes of CKD in the NCP (LankaJournal, 2011).\nThey also found the \"total hardness of drinking water of\nCKDue patients [in the region] to be very high\" (CSE, 2012).\nThe calcium content in the hard water in the NCP when com-\nbined with the arsenic in fertilizers and pesticides reportedly\nforms calcium arsenic crystals. When transported to the kid-\nneys, the calcium arsenate crystal \"disturbs the antioxidant\ndefense system in the renal tissues\" (CSE, 2012). Postmortem\ntests have found deposits of arsenic in diseased kidneys of\nCKD patients. Even a very tiny amount of arsenic is believed\ntobetoxictotheenvironmentandhumanhealth(Jayasumana,\n2012). A study conducted by a research team from the\nKelaniya University in Sri Lanka also found a \"strong posi-\ntive correlation between the arsenic content and ground\nwater hardness in CKDue prevalent areas\" (CSE, 2012). Dr.\nPriyani Paranagama of the Kelaniya Team reported finding\nhyper-pigmentation and keratosis in the soles and palms of\nCKD patients signifying chronic arsenic poisoning (de Silva\nThe above multi-factorial findings implicating agrochem-\nicals and water quality soon became controversial given\nwide media coverage of opposing perspectives. At a press\nconference \"Croplife Sri Lanka,\" an industry group repre-\nsenting 26 agrochemical companies criticized \"dubious\nresearch\" of the Rajarata and Kelaniya University research-\ners asserting that there was no arsenic in the pesticides used\nresearch was also subjected to media ridicule because\none researcher claimed that he derived the insights into the\ncause of CKD through divine intervention (BBCSinhala.\nLankan and Japanese scientists published in June 2011 yet\nagain concluded that CKD was the \"outcome of exposure to\nan unknown nephrotoxin\" (Nanayakkara et al., 2012). In\nlight of conflicting analyses and divergences, the Sri Lankan\nGovernment Health Ministry announced that it would declare\nthe \"real cause\" of CKD by June 2012 after the release of a\nspecialist report \"from a medical institution in Belgium\"\nThe \"real cause\" has not yet been declared. The contro-\nversy has only intensified taking attention away from the\nbroader political and economic and global context of the dis-\nease and the urgent health and survival needs of victims and\nfamilies. Recently, the debate has been focused on two\nreports recently released to the media, one associated with\nWHO and the other by a leading New Delhi\u00adbased NGO,\nCSE. The WHO study was commissioned by Sri Lanka's\nextensive 10-part study to test \"people and the environ-\nment--blood, urine, tissue samples and the region's food,\nwater and air\" (Countercurrents.org, 2012). The CSE Study\nwas done in collaboration with the Sri Lankan Government's\nMinistry of Water Supply and Drainage and the NGO,\nthe Center for Environmental Justice in Colombo\n(N. Gunawardena, 2012). It tested drinking water as well as\nsoil and food in the affected and unaffected regions to deter-\nWhile the WHO findings still remained classified, a group\nof Sri Lankan doctors associated with the WHO study com-\nmissioned by Sri Lanka's Health Ministry's epidemiological\nAccording to that report, heavy metals in water caused by\n\"unregulated use of fertiliser and pesticides\" is the main\ncause of CKD (Perera, 2012a). Other progress reports from\nthe WHO Study also implicate heavy metal toxicity, particu-\nlarly Arsenic and Cadmium in either water or food as\nreflected in raised levels of these found in urine samples of\nress reports claim that \"drinking water is unlikely to be the\nsource of the Arsenic and Cadmium exposure that is causing\nCKDu\" (Mendis, 2011). WHO recommends \"urgent action\nto improve safe use and quality control of agrochemicals and\nquality control of fertilizer\" (Mendis, 2011). However, the\nBandarage 5\nruled out Arsenic and heavy metals in food and water attrib-\nuting CKD instead to poor water quality in the affected\nregion. Arguing that \"the quality of drinking water is at the\nbase of all theories linked with CKDu,\" it called for improve-\nment of the quality of drinking water in the affected region\nDivergent opinions highlight scientific gaps and the need\nfor better data collection and dissemination. Even more\nimportantly, it highlights the need for a multi-factorial and\nintegrated approach that goes beyond the fragmented search\nfor a single \"real cause\" of CKD. Instead of waiting to iden-\ntify one bio-medical cause, the seemingly mysterious and\nisolated Rajarata disease needs to be seen in the broader con-\ntext of unsustainable economic growth and the degradation\nof the environment and public health. The controversy over\nCKD in Sri Lanka also highlights a host of political issues\npertaining to transparency and accountability of government\nauthorities, international organizations, and agrochemical\ncorporations.\nLocal and international activists have accused the Sri\nLankan government for maintaining complete silence about\nthe findings of the 10-part WHO study commissioned by the\nHealth Ministry for 3 years despite \"growing public pressure\nand repeated promises of definitive answers\" (Chavkin,\n2012a). Dr. Channa Jayasumana, a member of the team of\ndoctors that released the earlier mentioned report to the\nmedia in August 2012 has accused the authorities for failure\nto make the WHO Report public and to take action based on\nits results (Perera, 2012a). Local journalists and activists\nwere also asking why the findings of the WHO Report had\nnot yet been released (N. Gunawardena, 2012). As one jour-\nnalist wrote: \"We cannot afford bureaucratic apathy in a mat-\nter of such urgency and importance. The outcome of public\nscience must be shared with the public and media in the pub-\nlic interest\" (N. Gunawardena, 2012). In the CKD affected\nRajarata, there is growing frustration with seemingly endless\ntesting of people and their environment, bureaucratic apathy,\nand the contradictory explanations given by outside experts.\nNo real progress is evident in eradicating the disease or\nin improvement in people's lives. There is a sense that\nbecause they are poor, they are being treated as \"lab rats\"\n(N. Gunawardena, 2012). The local people who have lived in\nthe villages since birth have their own explanations of the\netiology, origin, and spread of the disease (Liyanage, 2011).\nThey have an experiential understanding that the \"real cause\"\nof CKD does not lie in one isolated cause but the entire tra-\njectory of unsustainable social and economic development\nset in motion in recent decades. A local Buddhist monk from\nthe NCP gives voice to the general consensus in the local vil-\nlages when he says,\nin the good old days none of these problems were evident.\nThose days no chemicals were used to gain harvests. They\nindulged in pure cultivation methods. Today the water content\nthat is used is not subjected to checks. This results in people\ncoming into contact with poisonous and harmful substances.\nIn certain CKD affected regions in the NCP in Sri Lanka,\nthe environment is extensively affected: Species of fish are\ndisappearing and cattle are affected with interstitial nephritis\n(CSE, 2012). Pesticides are also contributing to the decline\nof amphibians, such as, the common hourglass tree frog\n(Jayawardena, et al., 2010). A bio-medical approach alone is\nnot sufficient for understanding the depth of environmental\nand social destruction or long-term solutions. CKD has to be\ndemystified from a broader ecological and political-eco-\nnomic perspective. The industrialization of agriculture and\nthe model of social and economic growth it represents need\nexploration.\nIndustrialization of Agriculture\nRajarata, home to the CKD tragedy, was the seat of the\nancient hydraulic civilization and is still the \"rice bowl\" of\nthe island producing much of its staple food. A vast intercon-\nnected irrigation system of reservoirs and canals formed\nthe basis of the prosperous economy and the Rajarata\nculture (Bandarage, 1983). Even after the demise of the dry\nzone civilization in 12 ad and the shift of populations to the\nwet zone, the farmer remained the backbone of the society\nand rice cultivation the occupation of the largest segment of\nthe population. However, now, CKD is decimating the bear-\ners of the noble occupation who amid enormous hardship\nand suffering continue to till the land to feed the country.\nTraditional agriculture in Sri Lanka, as in other parts of\nthe world, was characterized by ecologically sound practices\nsuch as inter-cropping, crop rotation, use of compost and ani-\nmal manure, and natural pesticides. Swidden (chena) cultiva-\ntion, which complemented rice cultivation, was characterized\nby diversified cultivation of millet, legumes, beans, and so\non and the abandonment of land after each season until re-\ncultivation years later. Such practices helped maintain eco-\nlogical harmony including balance between crops and pests.\nUnnatural increase in pests or contamination of water and\nsoil were not common problems (Thirugnanasuntharan,\n1989). Labor-intensive traditional agriculture was also char-\nacterized by well established collective labor sharing\narrangements with neighbors helping each other plant, safe-\nguard, and harvest crops (Bandarage, 1983).\nWith European colonialism, a new form of export ori-\nented plantation agriculture was introduced in the wet zone\nof the island. In the pre\u00adWorld War II period, even this sector\nrelied on traditional methods, such as \"cut and burn or bury\"\nfor purposes of pest control (Thirugnanasuntharan, 1989).\nThe plantation sector became dominant taking land, labor,\nand state support away from subsistence agriculture. The dry\nzone rice cultivating areas were neglected and the rice or\npaddy farmers were marginalized. As rice cultivation suf-\nfered and as the population increased, the country became\n6 SAGE Open\nmore and more dependent on imported rice and the vagaries\nAfter 1948 in the post-independence period, the Sri Lankan\nGovernment introduced massive projects to resuscitate rice\nagriculture through irrigation schemes and settlement of\nfamilies from the populous wet zone areas to the sparsely\npopulated dry zone. Many of the people stricken with CKD\nin the dry zone today are likely the descendants of those\nwho settled in projects aimed at improving farmer self-suf-\nficiency and prosperity. While a few farmers have pros-\npered, the long-term result has been political patronage,\nclass differentiation, and impoverishment of peasant rice\nproducers. The resettlement projects that could not repro-\nduce traditional labor sharing arrangements and commu-\nnity-based lifestyle, introduced a more competitive and\nindividualist approach to agriculture and social relations\n(Bandarage, 1988; Udyanganie, Prasada, Kodithuwakku,\nGiven hypotheses implicating the hydrogeochemistry\nand waterborne chemicals as causative factors for CKD in\nSri Lanka, the impact of the Mahaweli River Development\nand Resettlement Program on the dry zone needs investiga-\ntion.

Faulty and hasty con-\nstruction of dams, reservoirs, and so on are believed to\nthreaten the ecological balance of the hill country where the\nMahaweli originates and the dry zone through which the\nmassive river flows into the ocean (Bandarage, 1988). As a\njoint research study published in 2010 by Sri Lankan and\nJapanese scientists pointed out, change in the hydrogeo-\nchemistry and salinity in the CKD affected areas \"could well\nbe caused by the large irrigation scheme that commenced\ntwo decades ago\" (Chandrajith et al., 2011).\nThe \"Green Revolution\" using \"miracle\" hybrid varieties\nof seeds and dependent on extensive use of agrochemicals\nincluding fertilizers, hormones, soil treatments, and pesti-\ncideswasintroducedtoSriLankainthe1970s.Agrochemicals\nthat enhance crops began to be used extensively in\nSri Lanka's plantation and traditional agricultural sectors\nwith the introduction of the \"Open Economy\" and import lib-\nof formulated pesticides (insecticides, herbicides, and fungi-\nWhile imports leveled off in subsequent years, increasing\ncommoditization and industrialization of agriculture kept\npesticide use at high levels.

However,\nincreased fertilizer inputs will also result in increased weed\ngrowth, so herbicides are commonly applied throughout the\nA study published in 2009 by Rohana Chandrajith and a\nteam of Sri Lankan scientists reported that paddy soils in\nareas experiencing rapid economic development are polluted\nwith potentially toxic metals. The study observed widespread\napplication of phosphate fertilizers with uranium and other\nelements known for their nephrotoxic effects:\nThe paddy soils in Sri Lanka are . . . highly modified by artificial\nfertilizer applications. During the period of waterlogging in rice\ncultivation, the chemical nature of the soil can be drastically\nchanged and pollutants can be leached easily into subsurface,\nwhich eventually contaminate the ground water that rural people\nuse as a drinking water source. (Chandrajith et al., 2010)\nIn Sri Lanka, where rice is cultivated in two or some cases\nthree seasons per year, fertilizers tend to be applied 3 times\nevery season. Chandrajith et al explain that the recommended\namount of application is 270kg per hectare of fertilizers such\nas urea, triple phosphate (TSP), and potash per season.\nHowever, over the past few decades, their application has\nincreased by more than a factor of two exceeding the recom-\nmended levels. They attributes this massive increase to fertil-\nizer subsidies granted by the government and the use of\n\"very low quality\" imported fertilizer due to \"the unavail-\nability of a proper controlling mechanism\" (Chandrajith\net al., 2010). The search for causes of the CKD epidemic\nnecessitates consideration of the bio-medical as well as the\necological and political-economic dimensions of agrochemi-\ncal use.\nAgrochemicals\nChemical pesticides have their origin in modern warfare:\nNazi Germany experimented with them as weapons to be\nused against human enemies. Malathion and Parathion were\noriginally developed as neurotoxins during World War II. It\nwas only later that they came to be applied against pests in\nagriculture (Sasi, 1996). Pesticide pollution is one of the\nmost serious global environmental and health problems\ntoday. Consumer agitation has led to banning and restricting\nof some of the most dangerous pesticides and improving\nsafety standards in the global North. However, many danger-\nous pesticides banned in the North are still being \"dumped\"\nin some countries in the South where regulation and safety\nBandarage 7\nUltimately, however, the cycle of poison created by chemical\nagriculture envelops all life on earth. The countries in the\nNorth do not escape the poison: It comes back via pesticide-\nladen food imported from the South and through the\necosystem.\nHybrid seed varieties promoted by the Green Revolution\nrequire large amounts of water from irrigation systems and\ndams, which in turn aggravate pest problems. Populations of\nharmful pests increase as they become resistant to chemical\ninputs. As newer, stronger, and more serious insect diseases\nand weed problems develop, even smallholders cultivating\ntiny plots of land are caught in a \"pesticide treadmill\" that\nthey find difficult to escape (Bull, 1982). Excessive use of\nchemical pesticides in Sri Lanka have introduced insects,\nsuch as the brown planthopper, infecting rice crops as well as\nweeds and diseases that were never problems previously. As\npesticide problems worsen, poor farmers have to buy expen-\nsive and stronger varieties of pesticides before they could\nearn any money from the harvest. Chemical pesticides kill\nharmful pests, but they also kill beneficial life-forms disturb-\ning the delicate balance of ecosystems depleting soil of nutri-\nents and rendering lands unsuitable for cultivation. The\nshort-term approach leads to quick returns--high yields and\nprofits--but poses fundamental threats to environmental sus-\ntainability, global food security, and human health (Bull,\n1982; Centre for Science and Technology of the Non-Aligned\nA Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) study in\nistered marketed and/or handled by private sector organiza-\ntions in Sri Lanka (Sumith, 2005). Due to \"commercial\npressure and competition\" between the agrochemical compa-\nnies, credit facilities for purchase of pesticides are widely\navailable to Sri Lankan farmers (Taylor, 1999). Since the\n1980s, synthetic pesticides have been \"freely available over\nthe counter with no controls or restrictions on sales\" and in\nrural areas often sold \"through general stores alongside food\nstuffs and household goods.\" (Taylor, 1999).The sales-driven\npromotional strategies of agrochemical firms seem to pay\nlittle attention to farmer education of the toxicity and proper\nuse of pesticides. Studies have shown that some vegetable\nfarmers in Sri Lanka apply pesticides to their crops before\nappearance of any pests as a measure of precaution (Bull,\nalso common among farmers to spray vegetable crops just\nbefore harvesting and marketing. Most of the fruits and veg-\netables grown in Sri Lanka may thus be laden with chemicals\nposing threats to producers and consumers locally and inter-\nnationally (Sumith, 2005). Sociologists Ramanie Jayathilaka\nand Chandani Liyanage who conducted field based research\nin the Anuradhapura District report that the villagers they\ninterviewed believe that \"all the food items including tank\nfish available in their locality are not suitable for consump-\ntion\" because of chemical contamination and CKD risk\nEven when Sri Lankan farmers are aware of the extreme\ndangers of some of the agrochemicals, they lack the proper\nequipment and protective gear for safe use or the facilities\nfor safe storage. As a result, occupational and accidental pes-\nticide poisoning is rampant. In the late 1970s, Sri Lanka had\nthe highest rate of pesticide poisoning in the world (Bull,\nFAO figures in 1997, Sri Lanka still ranked \"very high in the\nAsia Pacific Region with regard to pesticide related health\nhazards\" with an annual total number of pesticide accidents\nOxfam sponsored study of pesticides and the Third World\npoor,\nMost of the victims of pesticide poisoning in Sri Lanka are rice\nand vegetable farmers. These are not rich farmers. Over 90% of\n. . . paddy (rice) holdings are of 10 acres or less. It is among the\nmass of the rural poor in this poor country that pesticides take\nMinor pesticide poisoning contributes to nose bleeds,\ndepression, dizziness, and headaches, as well as long-term\nhealth problems such as cancer and Parkinson's disease and\nmay be traceable to inhalation of the widely used herbicide\nParaquat (also known as Gramoxene) and other chemicals\n(Taylor, 1999). The toxic effects are not limited to male\nfarmers. Entire communities are affected. Long-term repro-\nductive health problems associated with pesticides including\nsterility, miscarriages, and birth defects are particularly high\nin the Mahaweli areas (Care International, Sri Lanka, 1997;\nInternational Water Management Institute, 2002). Purchase\nof expensive pesticides has also put many farmers in debt\nforcing some to sell their lands and become landless labor-\ners. As in India, suicide by pesticide poisoning is not uncom-\nmon among indebted farmers in the agricultural regions in\nDespite growing awareness of the risks of chemicals and\npesticides and possible link to the epidemic kidney disease,\nfarmers in the CKD affected regions are extremely reluctant\nto give up the use of agrochemicals. They now have little\nconfidence in themselves and in the organic, traditional agri-\ncultural methods of their ancestors. They have been made to\nbelieve that the new chemical-industrial approach represents\nprogress and that chemical pesticides are indispensable for\ntheir survival. As one farmer in the NCP put it,\nIt is difficult for us to earn our day to day living without using\nchemicals for our cultivations. This is the stark truth. If we do\nnot use them our harvest will not be as bountiful as it is right\nnow. But then again we know the health hazards posed to us by\nconstant use of such products. This is the never-ending struggle\nthatwearefacingandwehavenoalternative.(Kulatungaarachchi,\nRecognizing the deep psychological conditioning of\nfarmers and difficulties they have giving up \"addiction\" to\n8 SAGE Open\nagrochemicals, village leaders are calling for strong govern-\nmental action. As a Buddhist monk in the region, says,\nThere is no use in debating on the merits and demerits of such\nproducts [agrochemicals] because no matter what we say these\npeople are beholden to these products . . . Officials must strictly\nban the use of products which imperils the lives of people. It is\nonly through such a measure that the government will be able to\nsave the lives of countless others who would otherwise succumb\nto this dread in the years to come. (Kulatungaarachchi, 2011)\nThis, however, is not an easy task. The import of agro-\nchemicals is financed by the Sri Lankan government.\nEstablishment of a definitive link between agrochemicals\nand CKD may have significant implications for the corpo-\nrate\u00adstate relationship (Chavkin, 2012a).\nBattle Over Pesticides\nTen companies in the Global North now control 90% of the\n44 billion dollar global pesticide market. Those consist of the\n\"Big Six\"--Syngenta, Bayer, Monsanto, Dow, BASF, and\nDu Pont--(ETC Group, 2011). Corporate control is not\nrestricted to pesticides; it extends to other agricultural inputs,\nnotably seeds and biotechnology. Fifty of the global seed\nmarkets are dominated by 10 corporations many of whom\nare also the top pesticide corporations (Pesticide Action\nNetwork, 2013b). According to Robert Fraley, co-president,\nMonsanto's Agricultural Sector (now Monsanto's executive\nvice president and chief technology officer), \"what you are\nseeing is . . . a consolidation of the entire food chain\"\nPesticide Action Network points out that this consolidation is\nachieved through the \"revolving door\" between government\nand corporate sector employment and lobbying in\nWashington, D.C., and other capitals around the world:\nMany of the agrochemical industry's former executives, lawyers\nand scientists serve in the government agencies that are charged\nwith keeping watch over their industries . . . The agricultural\ninput industry maintains an army of lobbyists in Washington\nD.C., state capitals and countries worldwide to protect their\ninterests . . . agribusiness spends over $100 million a year\nlobbying Congress. (Pesticide Action Network, 2013c)\nPesticide use is supported by governments and donor\nagencies, which often require funds granted to the South to\nbe used to buy a pesticide of a specific origin. Pesticide use\nhas been growing at higher rates in the poor countries than in\nthe North in recent decades. In addition, no strict guidelines\nexist in the United States to prevent a company from export-\ning banned pesticides (Environmental Protection Agency,\n1992). The World Bank, which promotes export agriculture\nin the Third World, has also earmarked large sums of money\nspecifically for pesticide purchases (Bandarage, 1997).\nWhile practically all chemical pesticides were manufactured\nabroad in the past, now, local formulation is increasingly\nundertaken in the South by subsidiaries of Northern corpora-\nIn Sri Lanka, a handful of local firms--Hayleys, Harrisons\nChemical, Lankem, and CIC Crop Guard--and their subsid-\niaries sell base chemicals and patented products of transna-\ntional corporations, such as Syngenta, Monsanto, DuPont,\nBayer, Ciba-Geigy, Shell Company, and F.M.C. Corporation\n(de Alwis, 1989). Like the transnational corporations, some\nof the leading local pesticide companies also control other\nsectors of local food production--seed production, biotech-\nnology, and food processing and packaging (Hayleys, n.d.)\nThe Capital Maharaja Organization, which acquired\nHarrisons Chemical in 1989 and is considered to be the \"sin-\ngle largest group of private sector companies in Sri Lanka,\"\nalso leads in the fields of communication, media, and infor-\nmation technology in Sri Lanka (Capital Maharaja, n.d.).\nThe spread of pesticides throughout Sri Lanka is the result\nof extremely effective marketing and distribution strategies\ninvolving hundreds, if not thousands, of regional dealers and\nsub-dealers. Agrochemical firms have large advertising bud-\ngets, and they use attractive posters, radio, and television\nadvertisements and films to extol the benefits of agrochemi-\ncals as the modern and practical way to high yields and\nfarmer prosperity (de Alwis, 1989). Long-term relationships\nbetween the agrochemical firms and agricultural officials\n(from the government's Department of Agriculture) working\nat the field level help give legitimacy to pesticide use.\nCultivation of close relationships with farm leaders and local\npesticide dealers through economic incentives has also\nproved to be a successful strategy for agrochemical firms\nprofessional marketing personnel and provide high achievers\nin their dealer networks with lavish rewards and incentives.\nCKD activists believe that media objectivity on the CKD may\nalso be compromised due to the heavy dependence of the\nmainstream media on lucrative advertising in newspapers,\nradio, and television by the agrochemical companies.1\nSri Lanka's powerful agrochemical industry disputes the\nnotion that its products are to be blamed for CKD. The\nSecretary of Sri Lanka's National Agribusiness Council\nclaims that pesticides produced by many multinational and\ninternational companies follow all the WHO and FAO guide-\nlines and \"those are not in harmful levels\" (Chavkin, 2012a).\nAfter tests revealed contamination with small amounts of\narsenic, Sri Lanka's Registrar of Pesticides briefly banned\nseveral common pesticides containing the substances glypho-\nsate and carbofuran in June 2011. However, a few months\nlater, the ban was lifted on grounds that \"the arsenic levels\nwere too low to pose a serious threat\" (Chavkin, 2012b).\nInvestigative reporter Sasha Chavkin of the international\nNGO, Public Integrity points out that the ban was overturned\neven when WHO's internal progress reports on CKDu in the\nNCP in June 2011 called for stronger regulation of \"nephro-\ntoxic agrochemicals\" warning that any delay would cause\nBandarage 9\n\"further accumulation of toxic agents in the environment . . .\nresult[ing] in cumulative damage to the health of the people\nliving in these areas\" (Chavkin, 2012b). An internal Progress\nReport of June 2012 on CKDu in Sri Lanka by Dr. Shanthi\nMendis, Senior Advisor and Coordinator, Chronic Disease\nPrevention and Management of the WHO in Geneva con-\ncluded that \"contamination of the soil appears to be mainly\nfrom fertilizer and also from agrochemicals\" (Mendis,\n2012b). It recommended that the government\nstrengthen the regulatory framework to improve quality control\nof imported agrochemicals, particularly with regard to\nnephrotoxic agents such as cadmium and arsenic, i.e.\namendments to existing legislation, capacity strengthening for\nimplementation and monitoring. (Mendis, 2012b)\nAnuraddha Padaniya, President of the Government Medical\nOfficers' Association voices the opinion of growing numbers\nof Sri Lankans when he says that while tackling CKD \"should\nbe a national priority,\" \"vested interests\" are \"preventing strict\npolicing of agrochemicals\" (Countercurrents.org, 2012). On\nstaged a protest in front of the office of the United Nations\nFAO in Colombo. The protest organized by the local NGO\nSwarna Hansa Foundation claimed that CKD in Sri Lanka is\ncaused by chemical fertilizer use encouraged by the FAO,\nwhich supports the multinational agribusiness. The protesters\ndemanded compensation for farmers suffering from CKD and\nan official ban on imported agrochemicals \"with immediate\nIn comparison with many other developing countries, the\nPesticide Registrar in Sri Lanka has been successful in regu-\nlating pesticides. A regulatory mechanism was introduced in\n(Eddleton,Manuweera,&Roberts,2003;Wijegunawardhana,\n2010). However, as Michael Eddleston (Centre for Tropical\nMedicine, University of Oxford, United Kingdom), Gamini\nManuweera (Office of the Pesticide Registrar, Government\nDepartment of Agriculture, Sri Lanka), and Darren Roberts\n(Division of Medicine, Royal Brisbane Hospital, Australia)\nhave written in The Lancet, global financial realities make\nstricter regulation of agrochemicals difficult for the Sri\nLankan Government:\nIndustry resources dwarf those available to the government for\nregulation of pesticides. The size of the marketing department of\none agrochemical company active in Sri Lanka is more than\nthree times the size of the whole government regulatory\ndepartment. It can be difficult to make big changes in complex\nsocial issues quickly, especially in view of the financial\nconstraints faced by countries like Sri Lanka. (Eddleton et al.,\nGiven growing public outcry, the Sri Lanka's Ministry of\nHealth finally released the final WHO Report on CKDu in\nearly April 2013 (WHO, n.d.). Following recommendations\nin the Report, the Ministry of Agriculture banned the impor-\ntation of the pesticides--Carbofuran, Chlorpyrifos, Propanil\nand Carbaryl--on April 8, 2013, and called for the reduction\nof the use of triple super phosphate fertilizer (ColomboPage,\n2013). However, the battle over agrochemicals is far from\nover. The Registrar of Pesticides has not issued any \"guide-\nlines\" on the issue and the banned pesticides are still avail-\nable in the market and being used by farmers. Many of the\nleading agrochemical companies are interpreting the ban\nonly as a \"temporary measure\" (Jayawardana, 2013). CKD\nand the battle over pesticides are not restricted to Sri Lanka's\ndry zone agricultural region. These are global problems\nA Global Problem\nLike in Sri Lanka, today, the kidney disease epidemics in the\nPacific Coast of Nicaragua and in Uddanam in the remote\nagricultural belt of Andhra Pradesh, India are also classified\nas mysterious diseases of \"unknown etiology.\" According to\nthe WHO, more than 16,000 men died of kidney failure in\npopulation in some villages are estimated to be affected by\nthe disease (Chavkin, 2012b). The CKD epidemics in Sri\nLanka, Nicaragua, and India have important features in com-\nmon: The victims are farm workers; all suffer from \"a rare\nform of kidney damage known as tubule-interstitial disease,\nconsistent with severe dehydration and toxic poisoning\"; few\nsuffer from diabetes and hypertension, common risk factors\nfor kidney disease (Chavkin, 2012b). CKD activists in\nNicaragua see the sugar industry where most of the victims\nwork as a root cause of the disease. According to the trade\ngroup for Nicaragua's sugar companies, however, \"the agri-\ncultural sugar industry in Nicaragua has no responsibility\nwhatsoever for the spreading disease\" (Aleman &\nGroup, the private sector arm of the World Bank, provided\nmore than US$100 million to two privately owned sugar\nplantations in Nicaragua to promote sugar cultivation and\nbiofuel production (Aleman & Wessenstein, 2012; Sanders\n& Seville, 2012). The workers at Ingenio San Antonio, one\nof the plantations funded by the Bank, however, have been\nprotesting for close to a decade alleging that pesticide use\nand labor practices of the plantation have caused the disease\nThe search for causes and solutions to CKD whether in\nSri Lanka, Nicaragua, India, or elsewhere must go beyond\nthe bio-medical focus on the delineation of illness and treat-\nment. To understand root causes, it is imperative to consider\nthe industrialization of agriculture and the \"consolidation of\nthe entire food chain\" by transnational corporations (Pesticide\nAction Network, 2013a). Through privatization of resources\nand technological domination, corporate control is being\nextended beyond the food chain to all of nature. The\nlong-term result is not the promised progress and prosperity\nfor all but structural violence--environmental degradation,\npoverty, ill health, and loss of livelihoods for the majority.\nThese issues are discussed in the author's book Sustainability\nand Well-Being: The Middle Path to Environment, Society\nIn 1962, Rachel Carson warned in Silent Spring that \"for\nthe first time in the history of the world, every human being\nis now subjected to contact with dangerous chemicals from\nthe moment of conception until death\" (Benson, 2011;\nCarson, 1987). Today, the cycle of poison created by chemi-\ncal agriculture envelops almost all life on earth--water, soil,\nair, plants, and animals--threatening the very survival of\nhumans and the health of ecosystems. The Sri Lankan\nGovernment's recent ban (August 2013) of imported milk\npowder from New Zealand that was allegedly contaminated\nwith dicyandamide (DCD) is a case in point. An editorial in\nthe Sri Lankan newspaper, Daily Mirror, voices growing\npublic fear of poisoned food and drink when it says that\nHundreds of people may be silently dying due to a daily intake\nof poisoned or polluted food. Even post-mortem examinations\nmay not reveal the root cause . . . the verdict will be recorded as\ndeath due to natural causes. They are far from natural. In addition\nto the use of agro-chemicals, trans-national companies have\ninvaded Sri Lanka with their genetically modified foods and\nterminator technology . . . The long-term effect may be the\ndestruction of an agriculture system that has been part of our\ncivilisation and culture for thousands of years. The . . . solution\n. . . is for the Government . . . to work out an effective national\npolicy on food and nutrition. (Daily Mirror, 2013)\nPolicies on food and nutrition at the national level are not\nsufficient. The elimination of CKD and contamination of food\nand water call for a transformation of consciousness and an\nintegrated global policy approach (Bandarage, 2013c). CKD\nis a complex issue requiring multi-dimensional, short- and\nlong-term approaches. The struggle against toxic chemicals\nrepresents a challenge to the dominant model of development\nand its emphasis on economic growth and profits over envi-\nronmental sustainability and human well-being. It calls for a\nfundamental shift from the dominant individualistic and com-\npetitive approach toward a partnership approach to human\ninteraction with nature and with each other. The global move-\nment away from industrialized agriculture, imported and fast\nfoods toward organic agriculture, \"food sovereignty,\" and\n\"slow food\" are integral aspects of this shift (Amin, 2011;\nInternational Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements,\nToward Sustainability and Well-Being\nUnlike agribusiness, which pursues a fragmented, highly\ntechno-bureaucratic approach, organic agriculture is an inte-\ngrated approach that helps maintain an appropriate agroeco-\nlogical balance between the soil, water, people, animals, and\ninsects. It depends on the use of local inputs such as indige-\nnous seed varieties, compost, animal manure, and the culti-\nvation of a diversity of crops. Organic agriculture also relies\non the accumulated knowledge and skills of local farming\ntraditions but can be dynamic and adapted to changing needs\nand circumstances (J. M. R. S. Bandara, 2009).\nIt may not be necessary to dismiss all aspects of industri-\nalized agriculture or attempt to return to romanticized pre-\nmodern agriculture. A range of alternatives to the chemical\nled approach to pest management can be considered. One is\nIntegrated Pest Management (IPM) encouraged by the well-\nknown international NGO, Care International in Sri Lanka\nmaximize the use of safe, cheap, and simple pest control\ntechniques by including organic traditional methods with the\nsafest possible use of chemical pesticides where necessary.\nAnother is Effective Microorganism (EM), a multi-purpose\norganic fertilizer and pesticide. It has been tried with much\nsuccess in IPM projects in Sri Lanka including control of the\nbrown hopper, which could not be contained by chemical\nGiven farmers' fear of economic survival and reluctance\nto give up chemical inputs, the switch to organic fertilizers\nand pesticides must involve a gradual process including\nresearch, advocacy, and public education. It calls for partner-\nship among farmer producers, consumers, civil society\ngroups, the government, intergovernmental organizations,\nsuch as the WHO and companies that are genuinely willing\nto support sustainable agriculture. Sri Lankan companies can\nplay an important role in developing local organic alterna-\ntives to imported agrochemicals and food products, such as\nmilk powder.\nAs shortages, prices, and contamination of food increases,\nmore and more people across the world are joining the sus-\ntainable agriculture movement. In Sri Lanka, a number of\ninternational, national, and local governmental and non-gov-\nernmental organizations are pursuing organic agricultural\nventures. Efforts are under way in CKD prevalent areas to\neducate farming communities especially the youth on pesti-\ncides, kidney disease, and the need to shift to organic agricul-\nture and safe use of water (Jayasumana, 2012). The concept\nof \"learning through doing\" relies on farmers'ability to make\nappropriate decisions about pest management based on their\nown observations and discussions with each other and train-\ners (van den Berg, 2004). The objectives are to minimize use\nof chemical pesticides, increase agricultural yields and\nincome of farmers, and restore their enthusiasm, self-confi-\ndence, and self-respect. Indeed, efforts to eradicate CKD in\nSri Lanka and elsewhere are integral aspects of the global\nsocial movement toward environmental sustainability and\nhuman well-being.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nNote\n1.
