Measurement of brachial blood pressure alone may exaggerate the true blood pressure elevation due to exercise-\ninduced change to pressure amplification. Whether blood pressure-lowering treatment modulates pressure amplification\nduring exercise is unknown.\nMethods: Thirty-two participants with stage 1\u00ad2 hypertension (mean age 59.2 years) received eight weeks' blood\npressure lowering with either aliskiren (300mg, n=16) or valsartan (320mg, n=16). Brachial and central aortic pressure\n(CASP) were measured non-invasively during treadmill exercise (Bruce protocol) at baseline, after eight weeks' treatment\nand 48 hours following treatment withdrawal.\nResults: The rise in brachial blood pressure with exercise exceeded the rise in CASP, indicative of enhanced pressure\namplification. Eight weeks' treatment elicited similar reductions in brachial blood pressure and CASP which did not differ\nbetween rest and peak exercise (p>0.05). The exercise-induced increase in systolic pressure amplification did not differ\nbetween baseline and following eight weeks' treatment (p>0.05). These effects remained unchanged following treatment\nwithdrawal.\nConclusion: Blood pressure lowering does not directly influence the relationship between aortic and brachial pressure\neither at rest or during exercise in patients with hypertension, other than through proportionate lowering of both\npressures. These effects remained unchanged 48 hours after a simulated missed medication dose.\n",

To date,\nthe effect of exercise on central aortic pressure has received\nlittle attention, in part due to the complexity of undertak-\ning such measurements during active exercise. Early inva-\nsive studies with direct measurement of aortic pressure\ndemonstrated an exaggeration of pressure amplification\nfrom the aortic root to the periphery with vigorous exer-\ncise, such that the exercise-induced rise in peripheral\npressure was found to exceed the rise in central pressure.5,6\nMore recently these differential effects of exercise on\nperipheral and central pressure have been confirmed using\nnon-invasive methods based on peripheral pulse wave\nanalysis, suggesting that the magnitude of pressure\nEffects of exercise on central aortic\npressure before and after treatment\nwith renin\u00adangiotensin system blockade\nin patients with hypertension\nPeter S Lacy1, Patrick Brunel2, Fabio Baschiera2, Jaco Botha2 and\nBryan Williams1\n Keywords\nHypertension, exercise test, central aortic blood pressure, direct renin inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker\nUniversity College London and the National Institute for Health\nResearch University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research\nCentre, UK\n2Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland\nCorresponding author:\nBryan Williams, University College London, NIHR UCL Hospitals\nBiomedical Research Centre, 170 Tottenham Court Road, London,\nEmail: bryan.williams@ucl.ac.uk\nOriginal Article\namplification may depend upon the type and extent of\nexercise undertaken, as well as age and other factors.7\u00ad11\nRemarkably, to date no previous study has reported the\neffects of BP-lowering treatment on the response of central\npressure to exercise. We recently reported in this journal data\nfrom a study evaluating the effects of two different strategies\nfor therapeutic inhibition of the renin\u00adangiotensin system\n(RAS) on brachial BP during exercise. This study compared\nthe direct renin-inhibitor aliskiren with the angiotensin recep-\ntor blocker valsartan and showed that both treatments simi-\nlarlyattenuatedanexercise-inducedriseinbrachialpressure.12\nIn that study, central aortic pressure was also recorded non-\ninvasively via pulse wave analysis, using tonometry (BProTM,\nHealthSTATS International, Singapore) and mathematical\ncomputation of the radial pressure wave.13 These data are pre-\nsented in the current report and describes for the first time the\neffects of BP-lowering therapy on the relationship between\ncentral aortic and brachial pressures during exercise.\nPatients and methods\nThe results presented in this paper derive from both pre-\nspecified and exploratory analysis of data from patients\nrecruited into a multicentre randomized controlled trial\n(RCT) evaluating the effects of RAS blockade on bra-\nchial and central aortic pressures (ClinicalTrials.gov\nPatients\nMen and women aged  50 years with stage 1\u00ad2 hyperten-\nsion (mean sitting systolic BP (msSBP)  140 mmHg and\n< 180 mmHg, and mean sitting diastolic BP (msDBP) <\n110 mmHg, measured at rest) were eligible for inclusion.\nIn addition, patients had to be anticipated to be able to\nreach peak exercise capacity (85% of their predicted maxi-\nmum heart rate) during a treadmill exercise test conducted\naccording to the standard Bruce protocol.\nThe main exclusion criteria included: secondary hyper-\ntension, therapy with more than two antihypertensive\ndrugs, a history of severe cardiovascular or cerebrovascu-\nlar disease, known Keith\u00adWagener grade III or IV hyper-\ntensive retinopathy, and type I diabetes. Pregnant or\nnursing women were also excluded. All patients provided\nwritten informed consent before participating in any study\nprocedures and all study centres received approval from\nthe relevant local and central ethical review boards.\nStudy design\nThe study design has been reported previously12 and is\noutlined below.\nThe study from which data were analysed was a rand-\nomized, double blind, parallel-group study. After a two-week\nwashout and a one- to two-week placebo run-in period,\neligible patients were randomized to once-daily aliskiren 150\nmg or valsartan 160 mg for one week, with forced titration to\ndouble the initial dose for a further seven weeks (Figure 1).\nThree treadmill exercise tests were conducted using the\nstandard Bruce protocol at: (i) baseline (immediately prior to\nrandomization), (ii) at the end of the active treatment period\n(week 8) and (iii) 48 hours after treatment withdrawal, to\nevaluate the persistence of the treatment effect two days after\ntreatment withdrawal (missed dose, week 8 + 2 days).\nExercise tests were conducted according to American\nCollege of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/\nAHA)14 and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guide-\nlines for exercise testing15 and patients were closely moni-\ntored before, during and after the tests. Electrocardiogram\n(ECG) monitoring was continuously performed during the\ntest to ensure patient safety and tests could be stopped if any\nof several ECG criteria were met (such as severe ST-segment\ndepression; ST-segment elevation; frequent ventricular\nextra-systoles; onset of ventricular tachycardia).\nStudy assessments\nThe main objective of this analysis was to assess the exer-\ncise-induced changes in central aortic systolic pressure\n(CASP) relative to the corresponding changes in standing\nbrachial BP after eight weeks of aliskiren or valsartan ther-\napy and following treatment withdrawal. Our primary\nfocus was on CASP because the measurement of pulse\npressure (brachial and central) is dependent upon accu-\nrately determining true diastolic pressure, which we found\nto be less reliable with manual sphygmomanometry during\nexercise. The primary endpoint for this analysis was the\nchange in systolic pressure amplification from rest to peak\nexercise, comparing baseline with end of treatment (eight\nweeks). Changes in other central haemodynamic variables\nduring exercise were also investigated. In order to stand-\nardize exercise effort according to the Bruce protocol,\nincremental treadmill exercise was maintained by each\nparticipant until 85% predicted maximal heart rate (HR)\nFor the primary analysis, due to the limited size of the\nstudy, baseline and treatment data for the study population\nwere pooled to assess the physiological effects of exercise\non brachial and central pressure parameters. This was a\nreasonable approach as we had shown that both valsartan\nand aliskiren had had similar effects on brachial pressure\nat rest and during exercise.12 Brachial BP and CASP were\nmeasured whilst standing at rest, at peak exercise and dur-\ning the recovery phase, prior to administering study medi-\ncation. Other central haemodynamic variables, including\nsystolic pressure amplification ratio (calculated as bra-\nchial/central BP), were also recorded.\nStanding BP provided the baseline (at rest) value for the\nexercise test, and was the mean of three measurements\ntaken at 1\u00ad2-min intervals prior to the test. Standing BP\nwas also measured during exercise at the end of each 3-min\nperiod, immediately after reaching peak exercise capacity\npeak exercise; Figure 1 and Supplementary Digital Content\nFigure 1 online). A mercury sphygmomanometer was used\nfor brachial BP measurement due to the recognized unreli-\nability of automated BP measurement during exercise.\nSystolic BPwas defined according to the onset of Korotkoff\nphase I sounds, whilst diastolic pressure was defined using\nKorotkoff phase IV sounds.\nMeasurement of central aortic pressure.Central aortic\npressures were measured using the BProTM device\n(HealthSTATS International, Singapore) during each\nexercise test at rest, at peak exercise and during recovery\ndesigned like a wrist watch, uses applanation tonometry to\ncapture radial artery waveforms, which are calibrated\nto brachial BP and processed using a validated algorithm\nto derive central aortic pressures.13,16 The device was\nworn clamped to the wrist using a `square lock' restraint,\nwhich allowed reliable and consistent recording of high-\nfidelity radial artery waveforms during exercise testing.\nAt rest, waveforms were captured immediately following\nthe final of three brachial blood pressure measurements\n(within 15 s) and calibrated to the averaged brachial\nblood pressure. At peak exercise and during the recovery\nperiod, waveforms were captured immediately following\nthe first brachial blood pressure measurement with the\nparticipant temporarily stationary and with their wrist\nheld still at heart level. Captured waveforms were back-\ncalibrated to the appropriate brachial blood pressure\nvalue. For all measurements using the BProTM device,\narterial pressure waveforms were sampled in 10-s blocks\nover the course of 20\u00ad30 s and the first stable waveform\nblock used for data analysis. In selecting the first stable\nwaveform block, waveforms were visually inspected for\nanomalies by an experienced operator and quality control\ncriteria applied to ensure adequate pulse height (100 mV)\nand pulse length variability (<20%).\nStatistical analyses\nThe study population was defined as those participants com-\npleting central and brachial blood pressure measurements\nboth at rest and at peak exercise.

CASP\nincreased from rest to peak exercise by a mean of 30\u00b125.5\nmmHg, and then fell to below the resting level during the\nrecovery period (Figure 2). The changes in standing bra-\nchial SBP showed a similar profile during exercise (Figure\n2), although the mean increase from rest to peak exercise\n(p<0.01). Systolic pressure amplification, that is, the ratio\nbetween CASP and brachial SBP, together with the differ-\nence between brachial and central pressures, showed a\nmarked elevation with peak exercise before declining to\nresting values during recovery (Figure 3).\nEffects of BP lowering at rest and during\nexercise in the pooled population\nEight weeks' BP-lowering treatment was associated with\nreductions in both brachial SBP and CASP from baseline at\nrest (Figure 2). Eight weeks' treatment was also associated\nwith reductions in brachial SBP and CASP at peak exercise.\nThe extent of the treatment-induced reductions at rest and\npeak exercise did not differ when compared (reduction in\nextent of the increase in brachial SBP and CASP from rest\nto peak exercise did not differ between baseline and after\neight weeks' treatment (brachial SBP change (rest\u00adpeak\nexercise): baseline 30\u00b125.5 mmHg; eight weeks' treatment\nrevealed no difference between the effects of treatment at\nrest and peak exercise, a trend towards a lesser reduction in\nCASP, however, was apparent at peak exercise relative to\nrest.

This was seen in\nspite of some residual variability in the effects of treatment\non central pressure at peak exercise.\nEffects of a missed medication dose on BP\nlowering at rest and during exercise in the\npooled population\nForty-eight hours after a missed medication dose, brachial\nand central pressures remained unaltered both at rest and at\npeak exercise relative to values seen after eight weeks'\ntreatment (Figure 2). Similarly, the increase with exercise\nin systolic pressure amplification and the difference\nbetween brachial and central pressure remained unchanged\nrelative to that seen at eight weeks or baseline following a\nmissed medication dose (Figure 3).\nAnalysis of data by BP-lowering treatment type\nWhilst this study was not powered to demonstrate differ-\nences in exercise haemodynamics between treatments, the\nchanges in brachial and central pressure during exercise\nwere broadly similar when the two different treatments\n(aliskiren versus valsartan) were compared (Figure 4).\nDiscussion\nTo our knowledge, this is the first report of the influence of\nBP lowering on exercise-induced change in brachial and\ncentral blood pressure in people with hypertension. The\nmain findings are that the rise in central pressure from rest\nto peak exercise was markedly lower than the correspond-\ning rise in brachial pressure, consistent with increased\naortic\u00adbrachial systolic pressure amplification during exer-\ncise. Blood pressure lowering treatment for eight weeks\nreduced both brachial and central pressures at rest and dur-\ning exercise. However, the reductions in aortic and brachial\npressures following treatment were proportionate to the\npre-treatment relationship between aortic and brachial\npressures, at all time points. These findings demonstrate for\nthe first time that BP-lowering treatment, at least with the\ndrugs tested here, does not exert a major influence on the\nrelationship between aortic and brachial pressure at rest and\nduring exercise, other than through proportionate lowering\nof both pressures. Consistent with the latter, the increased\nsystolic pressure amplification associated with peak exer-\ncise was not significantly modulated by BP-lowering treat-\nment, nor was there any significant treatment-induced\nFigure 3.

Data\nshow mean \u00b1 SEM.\n**p<0.01 versus value at rest.\nchange in the difference between aortic and brachial pres-\nsure at corresponding time points. If anything, there was a\ntrend toward a lesser reduction in central relative to bra-\nchial pressure at peak exercise, together with a trend to a\nsmaller exercise-induced increase in systolic amplification\nfollowing eight weeks' treatment, which did not achieve\nstatistical significance. Finally, the beneficial influence of\ntreatment on brachial and central pressure during exercise\nwas not diminished 48 h after medication withdrawal, sim-\nulating a missed medication dose.\nThe exaggeration of systolic and pulse pressure ampli-\nfication with exercise has been demonstrated in previous\nstudies using both direct5,6 and indirect7\u00ad11 measurement of\naortic pressure waveforms, together with contemporane-\nous measurement of peripheral BP. This indicates that the\ntrue pressure excursion (i.e. central pressure) during exer-\ncise is much less dramatic than the typical rise in brachial\npressure. This may be a direct consequence of functional\nchanges in the systemic circulation in response to the\ndemands of the working musculature for increased perfu-\nsion, but may also serve to protect the major organs against\nexcessive pressure elevations during the exercise period.\nThe mechanism for the increase in systolic pressure\namplification during exercise has not been fully eluci-\ndated. Dynamic exercise is associated with increases in\ncardiac output, heart rate and sympathetic mediated vaso-\nconstriction and venoconstriction. In addition to the conse-\nquent elevation in systemic BP in response to exercise,\nstimuli within the exercising musculature mediate local-\nized vasodilatation in response to the increased metabolic\nactivity to maintain adequate muscle perfusion. Thus\nassessment of central BP together with peripheral blood\npressure as measured over a non-working musculature, for\nexample, over the brachial artery in the case of treadmill\nexercise, demonstrates enhanced pressure amplification\nrelative to the resting state.5\u00ad11 By contrast, the degree of\ncentral to peripheral amplification has been reported to be\nattenuated when peripheral pressure is measured over the\nworking muscle5 as a consequence of local vasodilatation\nin the working limb.17,18 Similarly, the exercise-induced\nenhancement in central to peripheral amplification meas-\nured over the non-working muscle has been reported to be\nattenuated following initiation of local vasodilator stimuli\nsuch as induction of reactive hyperaemia6 or application of\nheat locally.19 These observations indicate that the\nincreased pressure amplification induced by exercise may\nbe modulated by local conditions and may involve changes\nto pressure wave reflections in the face of an unchanged or\ndiminished aortic impedance. Alternatively the enhanced\namplification may result as a consequence of increased\nblood flow into a vasoconstricted vasculature and may also\nresult in part from enhanced sensitivity of central BP to\nOur observation that the enhancement in pressure ampli-\nfication with exercise remained relatively unchanged\ndespite BP lowering is intriguing. It suggests either that in\nspite of effective BP lowering, RAS blockade does not\ndirectly affect the physiological performance of the arterial\nsystem during exercise, or that global changes to the physi-\ncal characteristics of the arterial system do not modulate\nthe pressure amplification response to exercise. The latter is\nconsistent with other studies investigating the influence of\nfactors such as diabetes or ageing on pressure amplifica-\ntion. Thus, whilst type 2 diabetes has been associated with\nexaggerated brachial and central BP responses to exercise\nrelative to age- and gender-matched people without diabe-\ntes, no difference in systolic or pulse pressure amplification\nbetween groups was reported either at baseline or following\nexercise.21 In a study comparing the effects of exercise on\nbrachial and central pressure in groups of young and older\nmen, Casey and colleagues11 reported that whilst ageing\nwas associated with changes to brachial and central pres-\nsure at both rest and peak exercise, there was little differ-\nence in the magnitude of the pressure amplification change\nFigure 4. Influence of treatment type on brachial SBP and\nCASP during exercise. Data are shown at baseline, after eight\nweeks of treatment and 48 hours after a missed dose. Upper\npanel: aliskiren; lower panel: valsartan. Data show mean \u00b1 SEM.\nBrSBP: brachial systolic blood pressure; CASP: central aortic systolic\npressure\nto exercise in relation to age. Similar data were reported by\nSharman and colleagues10 with regard to the influence of\nage on the exercise-mediated change from baseline values\nin pressure amplification. However, these workers also\nreported a reduction in the extent of exercise-induced ampli-\nfication in the presence of hypercholesterolaemia. This was\ninterpreted to indicate that exercise-induced elevations in\npressure amplification were attenuated by enhanced periph-\neral pressure wave reflections resulting from impaired\nendothelial function with hypercholesterolaemia.\nOur findings would not necessarily support a major role\nfor wave reflection. Treatment-induced reduction in wave\nreflections might have been expected to minimize the\nexercise-induced increase in central relative to brachial\npressure, thereby enhancing the amplification response.\nInstead, we found a trend towards an attenuated exercise-\ninduced increase in amplification following treatment,\nwhich is difficult to reconcile with the concept of benefi-\ncial effects of treatment on wave reflections.\nOur suggestion that wave reflections are unlikely to\nplay a major role in modulating exercise-mediated pres-\nsure amplification is supported by recent work using wave\nseparation analysis during moderate exercise22,23 which\nindicates that changes in pressure amplification with exer-\ncise are independent of changes to arterial pressure wave\nreflections. Similarly, other studies investigating the influ-\nence of short-term infusion with noradrenaline or inhibi-\ntors of nitric oxide synthase (LNMMA) on the change in\npressure amplification during exercise8 report no change\nto the exercise-induced increase in pressure amplification\nwith drug infusion. These data are also consistent with the\nnotion that exercise-induced changes to pressure amplifi-\ncation are independent of global change in arterial physical\ncharacteristics.\nA key issue for the interpretation of exercise studies\nusing non-invasive measurements of central pressure is\nwhether exercise itself has any influence on the method for\nderiving central pressure. Previous studies have produced\nequivocal findings. Sharman and colleagues, using a com-\nmercially available generalized transfer function for deriv-\ning central pressure, reported no influence of exercise on\nnon-invasively-derived central pressure in a small group of\npatients referred for diagnostic cardiac catheterization.7\nSimilarly Holland and colleagues24 reported non-inva-\nsively-derived central pressure to be a reproducible and\nreliable technique during haemodynamic perturbations\ninduced by exercise. However, using a radial to carotid\ntransfer function, Payne and colleagues reported that exer-\ncise was associated with an underestimation of transfer\nfunction-derived carotid pressure compared with directly\nmeasured carotid pressure, in a group of healthy men\nundergoing moderate exercise.25 Other workers using a\ndigital to aortic transfer function generated in cardiac\npatients reported that exercise modulates the characteristics\nof the transfer function such that derivation of aortic\npressure became unreliable, especially at higher heart\nrates.26 Importantly, however, the extent of any possible\nunderestimation in central systolic pressure defined in these\nstudies was small, that is, no more than 5mmHg, when\ncompared with the rise in central pressure with exercise\n(circa 30mmHg in our study) and is comparable to the vari-\nability typically seen in comparisons between invasively-\nmeasured and non-invasively-derived central pressure.\nBy contrast, studies using direct invasive measurement\nof aortic pressure suggest little influence of exercise on\naortic waveform shape,27 or on the impedance spectrum,22\nindicating that underestimation of central pressure in non-\ninvasive studies may be specific to use of a generalized\ntransfer function derived at rest. The present study used\nlow-pass filtering via a N-point moving average to derive\ncentral pressure non-invasively rather than using a gener-\nalized transfer function. Whilst exercise was associated\nwith modulation to the shape of the radial pressure wave,\nwhether exercise potentially modulates the degree of fil-\ntering required accurately to derive central pressure is\nunknown.\nThe persistence of BP-lowering effects following a\nmissed dose of BP-lowering medication, which mimics\nlack of compliance to treatment, is another important treat-\nment consideration.28 For sportsmen and very active indi-\nviduals, the effects of a missed dose on the changes in BP\nduring exercise are of particular clinical importance, given\nthe relationship between exercise-induced rises in SBP and\nadverse clinical outcomes.1\u00ad4 The current study suggests\nthat the beneficial effects of BP lowering with valsartan or\naliskiren were maintained following a missed dose, even\nduring the stress induced by vigorous exercise. This find-\ning is consistent with data from the ASSERTIVE study,\nwhich compared the effect of aliskiren and telmisartan on\nBP after a one-week treatment withdrawal.29,30\nThe present study has a number of limitations, which\nshould be addressed. This was a small study with an\nexploratory objective to investigate the influence of\nRAS-blocking treatment on the exercise-induced rise in\ncentral pressure. As such it was not powered to demon-\nstrate differences in central pressures or related haemo-\ndynamic parameters between the two different treatments\nused in the study. Similarly, the study was not powered\nto investigate the response of central pressure elevation\nto exercise by age, gender or height. Nevertheless, our\nstudy was well powered to show changes in both bra-\nchial and central blood pressure and amplification in\nresponse to exercise and the data are consistent with pre-\nviously published reports. However, this is the first study\nto report the effects of BP-lowering treatment on exer-\ncise-induced pressure amplification change. As such it\nwas not possible, a priori, to calculate the necessary\nsample size required should a change in the amplifica-\ntion response to exercise become apparent \u00ad especially\none that trended in the opposite direction to what many\nmight have predicted. An indicative, retrospective power\ncalculation indicates that the study would have required\n77 participants to demonstrate a significant decrease in\nsystolic pressure amplification and a sample size of 115 to\nshow a significant change for the difference between bra-\nchial and central pressure with exercise between baseline\nand end of treatment. This information will be useful for\ncalculating statistical power for future studies of this\nkind. We focused on systolic pressure amplification\nrather than pulse pressure. Although diastolic pressures\nwere measured at rest and during exercise, the investiga-\ntors noted that the measurement of DBP by auscultation\n(Korotkoff phase IV) during exercise was problematic\ndue to noise and movement, and less reliable than sys-\ntolic pressure recordings. Moreover, other workers have\nreported rhythmic variations in pulse pressure associated\nwith exercise, particularly upright dynamic exercise.31,32\nWe therefore elected to focus our data analysis on systolic\npressure. Undertaking detailed physiological studies dur-\ning exercise is complex. Despite the small numbers, our\nfindings clearly demonstrate that BP lowering does not\nenhance exercise-mediated pressure amplification. If any-\nthing there was a trend to the opposite direction, that is,\ntowards an attenuation in exercise-mediated amplification.\nImportantly, these data were recorded within the rigorous\ncontext of a randomized clinical trial of BP lowering.\nIn conclusion, this study reports for the first time that\nBP lowering treatment, at least with the RAS-blocking\ndrugs tested here, did not directly influence the relation-\nship between aortic and brachial pressure at rest and dur-\ning exercise, other than through proportionate lowering of\nboth pressures. Further work is needed to better understand\nthe mechanisms underpinning aortic\u00adbrachial pressure\namplification during exercise.\n"
