Amongst humans,\npaternal care is much more common, although fathers typically provide far less parental\ncare than mothers (Hewlett and Lamb, 2005; Hrdy, 1999). One reason for this is that men\nare believed to invest more time in pursuing additional status and mating opportunities than\nwomen (Geary, 2010). Another reason may be that men are less certain of their investment\ndue to concerns of paternal certainty. Unlike women, men are faced with the possibility of\nunwittingly raising a child that is not biologically related to themselves (Anderson, 2006).\nThus men should face different decisions and weigh different factors than women when it\ncomes to parental investment (Volk and Quinsey, 2002). One such factor is believed to be\ncues of infant-father resemblance (Daly and Wilson, 1982).\nPaternal care and perceptions of resemblance\nEvolutionary theory states that adults should be primarily interested in investing in\nrelated infants, and thereby favoring the fitness of shared genes (Trivers, 1972). Given their\nconcern with investing in related offspring, adults may attempt to determine the degree to\nwhich they share genes with a given child. Perhaps the simplest way of doing this (and\ncertainly one of the methods most available to our ancestors) is to look for shared\nphenotypical traits (i.e., resemblance) that may indicate shared genotypes that underlie the\nexpression of the shared phenotypes (Volk and Quinsey, 2002, 2007). Theoretically and all\nelse being equal, a man who invests more in children who resemble him, versus children\nwho do not, should have a lower chance of investing in unrelated children (Volk and\nQuinsey, 2007). A growing body of literature has found just such a positive male-bias\ntowards cues of resemblance with respect to hypothetical paternal care decisions (Platek,\nBurch, Panyavin, Wasserman, and Gallup, 2002; Platek et al., 2003; Platek, Keenan, and\nreports of actual paternal care are related to ratings of paternal resemblance (Alvergne,\nHowever, there remain several concerns regarding paternal resemblance and\npaternal care. In general, the findings to date have been based on indirect paternal reports\nor reports from non-fathers, and/or they have not been done experimentally with actual\nfathers. For example, it is generally presumed that the relationship between resemblance\nand paternal care is unidirectional, but there is no evidence supporting this claim. Indeed,\nBressan and Dal Martallo (2002) found that perceptions of resemblance where susceptible\nto social ascriptions. So it is possible that paternal ascriptions of resemblance may also be\ninfluenced by social behaviors. Furthermore, amongst many mammalian species adult\nexposure to infants can alter adults' neurological circuits that in turn alter adults'\nperceptions of infants and parental care (Rosenblatt, 2002). So besides social/cognitive\nmechanisms of change, human fathers' resemblance perceptions may also be altered by\nexposure to a particular infant. As human paternal care in general is facultative (Gray and\nAnderson, 2010; Marlowe, 1999), these perceptual changes may be part of the mechanism\nthat allows for facultative paternal care.\nTo address these concerns, we propose a quasi-experimental study of father-infant\nresemblance that manipulates the level of paternal involvement. This will allow us to\nexamine whether the relationship between parental care and resemblance is bidirectional.\nWe predict that father-infant resemblance will significantly negatively correlate with\nfather's ratings of parental stress both pre- and post-intervention and that increased paternal\ninvestment will be positively correlated with paternal perceptions of father-infant\nresemblance.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\nTwenty-four infant-father dyads were recruited for a study of father-infant massage\nand bonding (resemblance was not mentioned). Experience with fatherhood ranged from\nfirst time fathers to one father who had twelve children. Previous experience as a father and\nPaternal care and perceptions of resemblance\nsex of the infant were not controlled for as previous research suggests these factors may not\nbe statistically insignificant (Volk, Lukjanczuk, and Quinsey, 2007; Volk and Quinsey,\n2002). Fathers were assigned to one of two groups, and both groups had five male and\nseven female infants for a total of ten male infants and fourteen female infants. The infants\nranged in age from five months to fourteen months of age with a mean age of 8.08 months.\nFathers ranged in age from 24 to 50 years of age with a mean age of 33.6 years of age. The\nmajority of fathers had an undergraduate or graduate degree (n = 18, or 66.7%), considered\nthemselves of average wealth (n = 19, or 79.2%), and had no previous infant-massage\nexperience (n = 19, or 79.2%). All the participating fathers were the biological fathers of\nthe infant. They all lived with their infant and 83.3% (n = 20) were married to the infant's\nbiological mother. The average duration of their relationship with the infant's mother was\n6.75 years (SD = 4.25). While we did not ask direct questions of paternity certainty (to\navoid biasing participants), one of the questions asked in the Parental Stress Index at the\nbeginning of the study (see below) asked fathers if they agreed with the following\nstatement: \"My child knows I am his or her parent and wants me more than other people.\"\nAll of the fathers either agreed (79%) or strongly agreed (21%) with this statement,\nsuggesting a reasonable degree of confidence in their paternity. Fathers were recruited\nlocally through posters and a large newspaper article on the topic as well as through\nInternet advertisement sites such as Kijiji.com.\nMeasures\nThe Parent Stress Index: The PSI is a commercially available tool designed to\nmeasure parent stress (Abidin, 1995). It was used to gather pre and post intervention data\nfor both the control and experimental groups. The PSI is a highly validated test that was\ndeveloped for use as both a diagnostic tool as well as a research tool aimed at studying the\neffects of stress on parent-child interactions (Abidin, 1995). The test consists of 120 items\nstandardized for use with parents of children 1 month \u00ad 12 years of age, and it consists of\nthree domains: child, parent, and general stressors. The first domain is child stresses which\ninclude: the child's distractibility/hyperactivity, adaptability, reinforcement of the parent,\nmood, and acceptability. The second domain of parent stresses includes: parent-child\nattachment and parental competence, role restriction, depression and spousal support. The\nthird domain of stressors is called situational/demographic life stress, and it measures\nexternal life stresses such as a personal or financial loss, legal problems, moving, and other\ngeneral problems. Parents who earn a high life stress score find themselves in stressful\nsituational circumstances that are often beyond their control (Abidin, 1995). Prior to\nanalysis all subscales were tested for internal consistency reliability, for which they all\nrated  > .70. The participants' stress scores fell within the sub-clinical range of the PSI\nalso provided qualitative answers regarding their stress experiences; these are analyzed in a\nconcurrent paper on the fathers' experiences of infant massage (Darrell, Volk, and Marini,\nFacial cues: The facial cues rating scale has been developed and evaluated by the\nfirst author (e.g., Volk and Quinsey, 2002, 2007). It is a series of Likert scales that ask\nadults to rate infants on measures including perceived resemblance, cuteness, health, and\nPaternal care and perceptions of resemblance\nhappiness. For example, fathers were asked to rate their resemblance to their infant. A\nresemblance score of 1 indicates \"no resemblance at all\" and a score of 7 indicates \"perfect\nresemblance.\"\nIntervention: The intervention was based on infant massage techniques described by\nthe International Association of Infant Massage (IAIM) in this study. The IAIM instructor\nnever touches the infant; rather they demonstrate the strokes on a doll for the parent to\nmimic with their own child (Simpson, 2001). The IAIM suggests 4-5 sessions of infant\nmassage teaching to cover the entire body. Teaching often occurs in a class setting, which\ncan also benefit the infant-parent dyad by reducing isolation. The IAIM also suggests that\nin a class setting, the certified infant massage instructor (CIMI) can facilitate parent support\non a variety of infant development issues such as colic, bonding and feelings of efficacy\nProcedure\nThe experimental condition: The experimental part of the study took place in a\nwarm, carpeted laboratory at Brock University with plenty of floor space. At the first class,\nthe fathers were reminded of the goals and methods of the study and were asked to provide\nconsent for their and their infant's participation. Prior to instruction in infant massage, the\nfathers were asked to complete a brief demographic form, the full PSI, and to rate their\ninfants' health, cuteness, and paternal resemblance. The experimental condition ran for four\nconsecutive weeks. At the end of the four weeks, fathers completed a second round of the\nPSI and infant ratings. Three groups of classes (with four father-infant pairs in each) were\nheld in order to recruit the desired number of participants.\nAs previous research has shown the power of social ascriptions of resemblance can\ninfluence perceptions of resemblance (Bressan and Dal Martallo, 2002), we made an effort\nto avoid biasing language whenever possible. Thus, we referred to fathers and infants in\none of two ways. First, as a group, it was impractical to refer to infants as anything other\nthan \"your\". For example, when asking the group to place their infants on the ground, the\ninstructor said to the entire group: \"Please place your infants gently on the carpet.\" The\nalternate use of: \"Please place the infants gently on the carpet.\" was avoided as it sounded\ncold and impersonal. However, unlike at the group level, at the individual level (where\nmuch of the instruction took place) fathers and infants were referred to by their actual\nnames in order to avoid direct, personal attributions of relatedness. For example, instead of\nsaying to an individual father: \"Please place your infant gently on the carpet,\" the instructor\nasked: \"[Father's name], can you please place [infant's name] gently on the carpet?\" Thus\nwe were able to avoid direct individual verbal attributions suggesting relatedness. No\nstatements were made at any time regarding resemblance (physical or behavioral) between\nthe fathers and the infants.\nThe control condition: This group operated similar to a wait-list control group.\nOnce identified, fathers provided their home or work mailing address. They received an\ninformation package containing the informed consent document and the first set of\nquestionnaires. The fathers were instructed to fill out the documents and send them back in\nthe return pre-paid envelope. After a period of four weeks the fathers were sent a second\npackage of information to complete and return.\nPaternal care and perceptions of resemblance\nAt this end of the study, fathers in both conditions received a $50 honorarium and\nwere thanked for their participation.\nResults\nGiven the small sample size and the attendant limitations of statistical power, we\ndecided to focus solely on three variables of interest: resemblance, paternal stress, and life\nstress. The remaining variables (e.g., father age, child stress index, cuteness ratings, etc.)\ndid not significantly mediate or moderate the results presented in this paper (Darrell, 2009).\nWe thus focused on resemblance and paternal stress with life stress was kept as a useful\ncontrol variable. The data was analyzed between the two groups: experimental and\ncontrols.\nThe Spearman's correlations for the two groups are presented in Figure 1. The only\nsignificant correlations for resemblance were the strong, positive, pre-post resemblance\ncorrelations for both groups. Amongst the control group, there were large, significant\ncorrelations between all of the stress ratings. Amongst the experimental group, a similar\npattern existed with the exception of non-significance for the pre-paternal stress \u00ad post-life\nstress ratings and the post-paternal stress and pre-life stress ratings. There was a trend\ntowards the experimental group having stronger correlations between resemblance and the\nstress indices (particularly post-intervention stress). However, a comparison of the two\ngroups' correlations (using Fisher's z' transformation; Cohen and Cohen, 1983) failed to\nreveal any significant differences.\nTable 1.

Simulation studies have shown that MANOVAs with small sample sizes\nremain robust with regards to Type I error, although they still suffer from low power\n(Tiger, Kosinski, Barnhard, and Kleinbaum, 1998). The multivariate results are presented\nin Table 2 below. There was a significant, moderately-sized difference between pre-post\ngroup scores as well as a significant, moderately-sized interaction between pre-post scores\nand group membership.\nTable 2.

Pre-post life stress ratings by group\nPre Post\nLife Stress Score\nControl\nExperimental\nDiscussion\nWe conducted a quasi-experimental study of father-infant resemblance that\nmanipulated the level of paternal involvement by teaching fathers infant massage\ntechniques. This study was designed to test two predictions: that father-infant resemblance\nwould significantly predict father's ratings of parental stress and that increased paternal\ninvestment would increase paternal perceptions of father-infant resemblance.\nOur first prediction, that father-infant resemblance would significantly negatively\ncorrelate with paternal stress, was not supported. An obvious limitation of the correlational\nanalyses was the low statistical power available to them, which limited the study to reliably\ndetecting significance only for correlations greater than .6 in effect size (Faul and\nErdfelder, 1992). Nevertheless, these correlations still offer some descriptive value. It is\nworth noting that the correlations were both in the right direction (negative) and roughly of\nthe same effect size as has been found in previous studies of both hypothetical and reported\npaternal investment (e.g., Alvergne et al., 2009; Heijkoop et al., 2009; Volk and Quinsey,\n2002, 2007). The correlations were also larger (but not significant) in the experimental\ngroup, which is consistent with the hypothesis that there was a relationship between\nresemblance and paternal care.\nOur second prediction, that increased paternal investment would correlate positively\nwith paternal perceptions of father-infant resemblance, was supported. It appears that our\nexperimental paternal intervention had the desired effect on the experimental group and not\nPaternal care and perceptions of resemblance\nthe control group. Fathers who learned infant massage reported experiencing significant\nless paternal stress post-intervention than fathers in the control group. This is particularly\nworth noting given the opposite appeared to be true for their total life stress. That is, fathers\nin the experimental group appeared to experience coincidentally greater levels of general\nlife stress during the post-study phase, yet they reported lower levels of paternal stress.\nFathers in the control group showed a coincidental drop in their general life stress, but did\nnot report a drop in their paternal stress levels. This interaction was technically not\nsignificant, but even interpreted in that light, it is clear that the drop in paternal stress\nexperienced by the experimental group cannot be attributed to a simultaneous significant\ndrop in their life stress, or the reverse for the control group.\nFurther to the second prediction, fathers in the experimental group reported a\nsignificant increase in their post-intervention ratings of resemblance to their infant, unlike\nfathers in the control group. This suggests that the relationship between resemblance and\npaternal care may be bidirectional. Not only might fathers use resemblance as a cue for\nguiding their paternal investment decisions, but paternal investment may alter perceptions\nof resemblance. There are several possible explanations of this, one or more of which may\nbe true. First, as in many other mammals (Rosenblatt, 2002), mere exposure to infants may\nalter fathers' perceptions of those infants. Fathers in the experimental group may have\nsimply exposed themselves to their infants' cues more than fathers in the control group,\nresulting in a perceptual change regarding their resemblance to their infant. A second\npossibility is that fathers who invest heavily in their infants may be experiencing a form of\ncognitive dissonance that motivates them to give their child high ratings of resemblance\n(Festinger, 1957). In other words, rather than admit that they are investing heavily in a\nchild with low resemblance to them, these fathers change their perceptions of the infant to\nbelieve that they are investing heavily in an infant that resembles them. A third possibility\nis that fathers become more accurate in perceiving cues of resemblance when they have\nspent more time with the infant. Their greater familiarity with the infant might allow them\nto pick up resemblance cues that they previously were unaware of. Combined with either\ncognitive dissonance or a general bias towards cues that promote resemblance, this would\naccount for the experimental group's increased resemblance ratings. A fourth possibility is\nthat the fathers' investment in their infant created cues of resemblance, particularly\nbehavioral cues. Fathers who are involved with their infants (i.e., have secure attachment)\nmay be better at dyadic interactions than less-involved fathers (Feldman, 2003), which\ncould in turn increase father's perceptions of behavioral resemblance.\nFrom an adaptive perspective, one plausible explanation for our results is that\nexposure to infants triggers paternal perceptions of resemblance in order to promote\nfacultative paternal investment. In this scenario, fathers who have chosen to care for an\ninfant receive a perceptual boost to their efforts by the recruitment and promotion of the\nneural circuitry involved with resemblance and paternal care (Platek et al., 2005). For\nexample, a father with an infant who does not resemble himself physically may decide for\nother reasons (e.g., social cues, behavior of mother, or other factors) that the infant is\nindeed his own and thus choose to invest in it. A mechanism that promoted resemblance as\nhe cared for the infant could help promote and maintain his investment in that child, to the\nbenefit of their shared genes. The obvious drawback of this explanation is that it leaves\nPaternal care and perceptions of resemblance\nfathers vulnerable to generating false-resemblance to unrelated infants. What would be\nneeded is for this to be adaptive is for fathers to benefit more from creating increased\nresemblance with related offspring than they would potentially lose from creating increased\nresemblance with unrelated offspring. Given that recent estimates for paternity certainty in\nhumans are generally quite high (Gray and Anderson, 2010), this is a plausible scenario,\nmaking flexible perceptions of resemblance a plausible adaptation in fathers, particularly in\ncircumstances where fathers already have confidence that the child is theirs (e.g., the\nfathers in this study).\nThe alternative is that the increase in perceptions of paternal resemblance is a non-\nadaptive by-product of other adaptations, including (but not limited to): familiarity, infant\nmimicry, and/or cognitive dissonance. Of course, one or more of these other adaptations\ncould also be part of the adaptive response outlined above. At this stage, we simply lack the\nevidence for determining whether this perceptual shift is adaptive or not. For example,\nwould fathers who have low paternity certainty also change their perceptions of\nresemblance as a function of paternal investment provided? Is this effect stronger at a\nparticular age of infant? Is this shift influenced by other cues of resemblance (e.g., maternal\nascriptions of paternal resemblance)? What kinds of paternal care can influence perceptions\nof resemblance? The answers to these questions, and others, should help determine whether\nthe perceptual shift observed in this study is adaptive or simply a by-product of other\nadaptations.\nLimitations\nAs has already been acknowledged, the current study has relatively low statistical\npower due to its low sample size. This was of particular concern for the significance testing\nof the correlations. Fortunately, synchrony between the correlations presented in the study\nand the correlations found in the literature offer some confidence in the descriptive nature\nof the current correlations. The experimental, repeated-measures design of the study offers\nfurther confidence about the results, particularly for the MANOVA. While it would have\nbeen ideal to recruit more fathers, it should be noted that fathers of infants are a difficult\ngroup to recruit in general (Mitchell et al., 2007), while they are particularly challenging to\nrecruit for a lengthy out-of-home commitment such as the current study (Mackereth, 2003;\nMatthey and Barnett, 1999). The relatively large compensation we awarded to our father\nparticipants was a reflection of this challenge.\nAnother limitation is that we did not have a direct measure of parental care. Instead,\nwe relied on paternal self-reports of stress levels. While these are a valid indication of\nnumerous parent-child outcomes (Abidin, 1992, 1995), it would have been ideal to also\ninclude actual observations of father-infant interactions in order to confirm that the\nexperimental intervention was successful, as well as to provide an alternate measure of\npaternal investment.\nConclusions\nFather-child resemblance is increasingly attracting attention from researchers\ninterested in studying paternal investment. The current study sought to determine whether a\nquasi-experimental infant massage intervention would increase father's perceptions of\nPaternal care and perceptions of resemblance\nresemblance. Although we did not find significant correlations between paternal investment\nand resemblance, we did find that fathers who participated in the infant massage\nintervention reported significantly larger post-study ratings of resemblance and lower\nratings of paternal stress. This suggests that the relationship between father-child\nresemblance and paternal investment may be bidirectional. This adds a further layer of\ncomplexity to our understanding of father-infant interactions and it suggests that fathers'\nresponses to infant cues of resemblance may be more flexible to environmental cues than\npreviously thought.\n"
