This study examined nativity as a risk factor for poor physical and emotional health for an ethnically di-\nverse population making the transition into retirement. The authors addressed whether the health disadvantage observed\nfor immigrants lessens with increased time spent in the country (supporting theories of assimilation) or increases with\nduration of residence (supporting theories of cumulative disadvantage).\nMethods. The sample was drawn from Waves 1 and 2 of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), an in-depth eco-\nnomic, social, and health database of persons in midlife and beyond. The analyses were restricted to 9,912 native-born\nResults. The data revealed that after socioeconomic factors were controlled, foreign-born individuals were at higher\nrisk of poor emotional health than their native-born counterparts. Although aging immigrants displayed worse health\nthan the native-born population, this disadvantage was mediated by duration of residence (young age at migration) and\nsocioeconomic incorporation.\nDiscussion. These findings extend our understanding of nativity and duration as risk factors for poor physical and\nemotional health. Immigrants may overcome the nativity disadvantages found for emotional distress with increased du-\nration of residence, but the pattern becomes more complicated with the inclusion of race and Hispanic ethnicity.\nN this study we considered an important dimension of\npopulation diversity, nativity, in explaining health differ-\nentials throughout the adult life course. Controlling for eco-\nnomic and social resources, we examined the salience of\nnativity with respect to self-reported health among an ethni-\ncally diverse population poised for retirement. Regardless\nof selection effects, adult immigrants report worse global\nhealth than native-born persons. But, does that health disad-\nvantage lessen or intensify with duration of residence? Ex-\nploring differences between two competing approaches of\nassimilation enabled us to evaluate the potential positive\nand negative contributions of duration of residence for the\nhealth status of aging immigrants compared with that of na-\ntive-born individuals.\nWe employed the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a\nnationally representative sample of individuals nearing re-\ntirement in the United States. This dataset is uniquely suited\nto the proposed analyses for several reasons. First, it con-\ntains detailed health, wealth, and labor force participation\ninformation (Bound, Schoenbaum, & Waidmann, 1996).\nSecond, it provides information on nativity, including age at\nmigration, and indicators of social isolation. Most impor-\ntant, the longitudinal design of HRS enables the isolation of\npredictor variables at Time 1 and their relationship to health\noutcomes at Time 2. Although not a perfect solution to the\ndifficulties associated with disentangling the health\u00adwealth\nnexus, this time order helps establish the asymmetry of a\ncausal relationship (Bohrnstedt & Knoke, 1988). Building\non previous HRS investigations, these data permit an analy-\nsis of the ways in which demographic, social, and economic\ncharacteristics indirectly and directly influence the general\nwell-being of persons approaching retirement (e.g., Kington\nIndividuals transitioning into retirement represent a\nunique study population. They are approaching the end of\ntheir working life, which represents not only changes in life-\nstyle, but most likely the end of asset accumulation. In\nterms of social networks, contacts are gained throughout the\nlife course, yet the pre-retirement years are critical for es-\ntablishing patterns of reliance in later life. In the postretire-\nment years, when health may decline, preexisting social net-\nworks are crucial. In observing individuals approaching\nretirement we were able to assess the resources transferred\ninto retirement. Most resource accumulation occurs during\nthe working years. Therefore, differentiation in financial re-\nsources (whether by nativity or race/Hispanic ethnicity) ob-\nserved at this period may be indicative of future inequality\npatterns and is likely to have serious health implications. By\nfocusing on this age group, we attempted to highlight pat-\nterns of differentiation in resource access and health out-\ncomes, patterns likely to amplify as this group moves into\nretirement and beyond.\nBackground\nThe ethnic composition of the immigrant stream into the\nUnited States has changed dramatically over the past cen-\ntury with recent concerns centering on its racial and ethnic\ncomposition. Differences in education, occupational attain-\nment, and income associated with minority group member-\nship persist throughout the life course, placing individuals at\ndistinctly different risks of poverty and subsequent illness\n(Williams & Collins, 1995). Evidence suggests that Blacks\nI\nand Hispanics are especially affected by involuntary labor\nmarket exit or withdrawals, undermining their economic\nwell-being in later life (Crystal, Shea, & Krishnaswami,\namong socioeconomic factors, nativity, and health status is\nfundamental for understanding racial and ethnic disparities.\nResearch points to the increasing importance of sociocul-\ntural characteristics in determining individual health status\nand well-being, especially in light of increasing ethnic di-\nversity in the United States (Pampel, 1998). Demographic\ncharacteristics, such as advanced age, gender (female), and\nmarital status (nonmarried), are known proximate risk fac-\ntors for poor self-health ratings (e.g., Maddox, 1962; Ver-\nbrugge, 1983). Socioeconomic factors, such as education,\nincome, and employment, are also very powerful determi-\nnants (Feinstein, 1993). House, Landis, and Umberson\n(1988), for example, found that social assets, such as pres-\nence of children in the household and friendship networks\nin the community, are associated with good health (see also\nFew investigations have examined the role of nativity in\nexplaining general health status (Findley, 1988). Foreign-\nborn persons appear to enjoy a mortality advantage over in-\ndividuals born in the United States (Hummer, Rogers, Nam,\nRumbaut, & Ojeda, 1999). However, increased time spent\nin the United States erases much of the mortality advantage\nassociated with nativity status. Individuals less acculturated\nin terms of language proficiency and social mores (such as\nimmigrants) exhibit higher rates of social isolation and\ncompromised health (J. L. Angel & Angel, 1992; J. L. An-\ngel, Angel, McClellan, & Markides, 1996; Kossoudji,\n1989). Access to formal and informal support systems (e.g.,\nthe lay-referral network) may differ by nativity and in some\ncases decrease immigrant access to assistance (LeClere,\nJensen, & Biddlecom, 1994). Consequently, immigrants\nmay be less likely or able than native-born individuals to\nseek assistance, because they either lack health insurance\n(R. J. Angel & Angel, 1996) or have no lay or professional\nreferral networks available. Nevertheless, few studies have\nfocused on the interaction between nativity, duration, and\nrace/Hispanic ethnicity as it affects health.\nImmigrants, on average, report fewer financial resources,\nincluding health insurance, than the native-born population,\nwhich adversely affects their health through lowered social\nJensen, & Bach, 1984; Zsembik, Drevenstedt, & McLane,\n1997). Recent research has indicated that financial assets\nare more important than sociocultural factors, such as nativ-\nity (Hao & Johnson, 2000). Several studies have shown that\nimmigrants often find themselves in lower paying, physi-\ncally demanding, and dangerous occupations (Borjas &\nrevealed that the Mexican-origin foreign-born persons who\nhad fewer than 12 years of education and low family in-\ncomes (below $20,000) were more inclined to indicate\n\"fair\" or \"poor\" health than were native-born persons (see\nLoue & Bunce, 1999, for a review of the literature).\nImmigrants face many challenges in their efforts to attain\neconomic integration. Even the racial and ethnic composi-\ntion of immigrant streams affects the process of socioeco-\nnomic inclusion, reinforcing health disparities (Williams &\nCollins, 1995). As the proportion of Black and Hispanic im-\nmigrants grows, attempts to delineate the risk factors associ-\nated with nativity, independent of the risk factors associated\nwith race and ethnicity, become increasingly complex (Mar-\ntin & Soldo, 1997). Several studies have suggested that the\nprocess of assimilation has deleterious health consequences.\nHowever, cultural assimilation differs depending on the na-\nture of the socioeconomic experience in the nation of origin\n(Rumbaut, 1997). Migrants into the United States are favor-\nably selected from their origin populations (Lindstrom,\nyoung age, good general health, and high social capital\nJensen, & Bach, 1984). Positive selectivity explains find-\nings in which immigrants display health and economic ad-\nvantages when compared with U.S. native-born individuals.\nCultural Assimilation or Cumulative Disadvantage?\nTraditional views of immigrant assimilation into U.S. so-\nciety primarily focus on the process of linguistic and social\nadaptation (Schlesinger, 1992). Relying upon the experi-\nence of the early 1900s, a period of high immigration from\nEurope into the United States, such frameworks focus on\nimmigrants who are socially and linguistically diverse but\nracially homogenous. Predicated on the assumptions that\nthe chief barrier to assimilation is linguistic and that over\ntime linguistic and cultural barriers between immigrants and\nnative-born persons will dissipate, these viewpoints suggest\nthat higher levels of integration are positively correlated\nwith time spent in the United States. Assimilation theory\nsuggests that differences in self-reported health between na-\ntive- and foreign-born persons are functions of duration of\nresidence, that is, immigrants with long tenure in the United\nStates have health profiles indistinguishable from those of\nnative-born persons (Amaro, Whitaker, Coffman, & Heeren,\nHaffner, Stern, & Hazuda, 1996). Numerous studies have\ninterpreted the positive correlation between length of resi-\ndence and socioeconomic incorporation as evidence to sup-\nport the assimilation hypothesis (cf. Bean, Berg, & Van\nHowever, time spent in the United States has complex\nand not always positive health consequences. Immigrants,\nbecause of positive selectivity, initially demonstrate favor-\nable health behaviors (Findley, 1988). Even if immigrants\nengage in risky lifestyles and unhealthy behaviors, such as\ncigarette smoking and excessive alcohol use, they may be\nprotected by the salubrious effects of a culture of origin that\nreduces the risks associated with such behaviors (Finch,\nal., 1998). These countervailing forces of assimilation (neg-\native) and selectivity (positive) take place in the context of\nsocioeconomic disadvantage (Elkeles & Seifert, 1996; San-\nCumulative disadvantage, a perspective guided by con-\nflict theory, provides an alternative interpretation to the\nhealth benefits of assimilation (Dowd & Bengtson, 1978).\nThis perspective focuses on persistent barriers to immigrant\nadaptation. Immigrants are unlikely to lose their disadvan-\ntaged social or economic status. The negative effects of this\nmarginalization are cumulative and are likely to increase\nwith duration. Simply put, duration of residence correlates\nnot with increased integration but with exposure to the\ndetrimental effects of social and economic disadvantage.\nThe cumulative disadvantage and cultural assimilation ap-\nproaches both emphasize economic factors, such as income,\neducation, and employment. These variables, often associ-\nated with membership in the lower classes, increase the risk\nof poor health.\nRelated theoretical approaches concerning immigrant ad-\naptation focus on social capital (Portes, 1995), a widely ob-\nserved explanatory variable in personal health and well-being.\nSome immigrants develop additional networks with in-\ncreased duration; for others, the process of acculturation is\nassisted by social networks at the place of destination. Im-\nmigration disrupts access to location-specific ties and may\ndiminish access to formal and informal means of support in\nthe country of origin. Research has shown the ability of im-\nmigrants to develop new networks at their points of destina-\ntion and the positive influence such networks have on health\nand well-being (J. L. Angel & Angel, 1992; Portes & Rum-\nbaut, 1990). Studies on family reliance have underscored\nthe importance of age at migration, because elderly Mexi-\ncan immigrants arriving during childhood are less depen-\ndent on their families than those immigrating in later life\n(R. J. Angel, Angel, Lee, & Markides, 1999). This indicates\nthat although some forms of social capital may be positively\ninfluenced by duration of residence, reliance on other forms\n(such as kin networks) may be negatively influenced by du-\nration of residence.\nGuided by these two perspectives, we considered a set of\nthree interrelated hypotheses:\n1. Hypothesis 1: Immigrants approaching retirement tend\nto display worse physical and emotional health than na-\ntive-born individuals.\n2. Hypothesis 2: Increased duration of residence mitigates\nthe negative effect of nativity on health.\n3. Hypothesis 3: The ability of duration of residence to mit-\nigate the immigrant disadvantage in health varies among\nimmigrants, with Blacks and Hispanics benefiting less\nfrom increased duration than non-Hispanic Whites.\nMETHODS\nData were drawn from Waves 1 and 2 of the HRS. This\nstudy, funded by the National Institute on Aging (NIA),\ncontains longitudinal socioeconomic and health information\nfrom a nationwide sample of Americans born between 1931\nthe entire population contacted through the HRS (N \ntrition between Waves 1 and 2 are as follows: (a) 231 de-\nceased; (b) 136 aged into the Assets and Health Dynamics\nSurvey (AHEAD); and (c) 689 lost to follow-up. Our analy-\nses included respondents who participated in Waves 1 and\nand women. For cell size consideration, we expanded the\ncategory of individuals approaching retirement to include\ndetracted from the nationally representative nature of the\nHRS sample (because spouses are not randomly selected), it\nenabled stronger comparative analyses of native- and for-\neign-born persons by race and ethnicity, which was the\nchief focus of this study.\nMeasures\nWe viewed nativity not as a dichotomous status but rather\nas a characteristic that affects the ways in which individuals\ninteract with social institutions. Previous research has indi-\ncated that duration of residence often mitigates the influ-\nence of nativity for individuals. With increased duration of\nresidence, foreign-born individuals increase their opportuni-\nties to assimilate into American society. They are able to de-\nvelop coping strategies that improve their ability to interact\nwith social institutions, although such strategies are system-\natically tied to social location, cultural distance, and eco-\nnomic position (Alba & Nee, 1997). The analyses divide\nimmigrants into three life course stages of migration for the-\noretical and statistical motivations. Life course stage of mi-\ngration is likely to influence the relative economic welfare\nof elderly immigrants (Zsembik et al., 1997). Late-life mi-\ngrants are more dependent upon family than are native-born\npersons or those immigrating earlier in life and are less\nlikely to have private pensions and social security retire-\nment income (R. J. Angel et al., 1999). In our analyses, the\nfirst life course stage of migration included respondents\nwho arrived in the United States prior to age 15 (childhood);\nthey may have an economic profile that resembles that of\nnative-born persons. The second stage included those who\narrived in the United States between ages 15 and 34 (young\nadulthood); they have ample opportunity for economic inte-\ngration. The third stage included individuals who arrived in\nthe United States at or after age 35 (mature adulthood); they\nhave less opportunity for social and economic assimilation.\nIn the statistical models, we relied on these age at migra-\ntion categories. Supplemental analyses were conducted with\nage at migration as a continuous variable and measured as\nthe proportion of life spent in the United States. Both mea-\nsures yielded similar results across the independent vari-\nables. We believe the categorical approach best reflects the\nnonlinear nature of the relationship between duration and\nhealth. As mentioned earlier, the age structure of the sample\nwas relatively homogenous, with the vast majority of re-\nspondents approximately 55 years old. Because of the trun-\ncated age structure of the sample, life course stage of migra-\ntion and duration of residence were functionally equivalent.\nWe measured socioeconomic status in three ways: eco-\nnomic status, education, and employment disruption. In-\ncome reflected the financial resources of the respondent at\nTime 1; the analyses compared individuals earning less than\nnancial assets reflected accumulated savings. We compared\nindividuals in the bottom third of reported nonhousing as-\nsets (less than $10,075) to those in higher terciles. Similar\nrelative measures of economic status have been used in\nother analyses of HRS data (Kington & Smith, 1997). Home\nownership was the third measure of economic status, repre-\nsenting the most common form of equity in the United\nStates. Individuals not owning a home were compared to\nthose who owned their home, regardless of mortgage status.\nResponse rates for each of the economic measures were in-\ncomplete, and as a result, we included dummy variables in-\ndicating missing data to preserve sample size.\nLow education, a proximate risk factor for poor health,\nwas coded as a binary variable. Respondents without a high\nschool diploma or General Equivalency Diploma (GED)\nwere compared with those with at least a high school di-\nploma or GED (reference category).\nOur measure of employment status focused on individu-\nals who indicated they were unemployed, looking for work,\nor laid off at Time 1 of the study. Individuals reporting any\nof these employment difficulties were compared with those\nwho were gainfully employed or who were not identified as\nseeking employment at Time 1.\nSocial connectedness measured the quality of the respon-\ndent's perceived community integration at Time 1. Social\nisolation was measured by reported familiarity with neigh-\nbors, who reflect a potential source of informal support and\nsocial integration. Here, as in measures of economic status,\nresponse rates necessitated the inclusion of a dummy vari-\nable for missing data for us to preserve sample size.\nThe demographic variables included age (measured con-\ntinuously), gender, and marital status (unmarried). We cre-\nated two dummy variables indicating whether the respon-\ndent was African American or Hispanic. To clarify the\ndirection of the relationship, we focused on independent\nvariables measured at Time 1 to predict health status re-\nported at Time 2.\nCriterion Variables\nPersonal health, the dependent variable, is a complex and\nmultifaceted concept (R. J. Angel & Williams, 2000). Self-\nassessed health generally reflects an individual's percep-\ntions of his or her physical and emotional state, providing a\nglobal indicator of well-being. Self-assessed health reports\ndo not always coincide with clinical evaluations (Maddox,\n1962), but they are exceptionally robust in predicting mor-\ntality (Idler & Benyamini, 1997), disability (Ferraro, Farmer,\n& Wybraniec, 1997), expectations for health services (Wolin-\nsky & Tierney, 1998), and psychological well-being (Buck-\nInvestigations of self-reported health across racial and\nethnic groups are complicated by the possibility of different\nconceptions of subjective well-being (Johnson & Wolin-\nsky, 1994; Jylha, Guralnik, Ferrucci, Jokela, & Heikkinen,\n1998). Limited research has suggested that potential racial/\nethnic differences exist in the assessment of health (R. J.\nAngel & Williams, 2000), potentially contributing to ob-\nserved group differentials in self-rated health (Williams &\nCollins, 1995). However, similar predictors of self-reported\nhealth status (socioeconomic status, marital status, etc.) op-\nerate consistently across groups (Lillie-Blanton & Laveist,\n1996). In meta-analyses, self-assessments of health (how-\never conceptualized) were just as predictive of mortality for\nracial/ethnic minorities as for non-Hispanic Whites (Idler &\nBenyamini, 1997), a finding supported by McGee, Liao,\nCao, and Cooper (1999). Even though actors may perceive\ntheir health differently, poor self-assessed health generates\nadverse health outcomes consistently across groups, making\nthe identification of health risk factors, such as nativity, im-\nportant.\nIn the HRS, two questions asked respondents to rate their\ngeneral physical and emotional health: first, \"Would you\nsay your health is excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?\"\nand second, \"How good do you feel or how stressed, anx-\nious, or depressed do you feel now?\" As has been suggested\nin previous investigations of immigrant health, we em-\nployed a dichotomous measure of self-rated health. Persons\nreporting either fair or poor health were coded 1, and if they\nidentified themselves to be in excellent, very good, or good\nhealth (reference category) they were coded 0. Respondents\nreporting either fair or poor emotional health (i.e., emo-\ntional distress) were coded 1 and were coded 0 if otherwise\n(excellent, very good, or good health). Although the full ar-\nray of response categories facilitates a wider distribution of\nresponses, there is no reason to assume that the conceptual\ndistance between categories is equal (i.e., the data are ordi-\nnal, not continuous). The response categories of fair and\npoor represent mortality risks that are substantially higher\nthan those of any other response (Idler & Benyamini, 1997).\nIn our analyses, therefore, we employed logistic models to\ndetermine proximate risk factors for poor physical and emo-\ntional health (see J. L. Angel, Buckley, & Finch, in press;\nBesides using universal self-assessments of health, we\ncaptured overall physical functioning by employing a modi-\nfied version of the Katz, Ford, Moskowitz, Jackson, and\nJoffe (1963) basic activities of daily living (ADL) summary\nindex. This measure, although less prevalent in our study\ngroup, provides an excellent indicator of impaired daily\nfunctioning. Respondents are asked to report any difficulty\nin performing five basic activities of daily living, that is,\nbathing, dressing, eating, walking across a room, and get-\nting in and out of bed. Because we employed binomial lo-\ngistic regressions, we partitioned this variable into two cate-\ngories: 1  \"at least some ADL disability\" and 0  \"no\nADL difficulty.\"\nThe relationship between resources and self-rated physi-\ncal and emotional health is complex. Are the poor more\nlikely to suffer ill health or are those in ill health more likely\nto be poor? It is difficult to disentangle the specific effects\nof wealth on health because of the effect of health on\nwealth. In our analyses we used the panel aspect of our data\nto minimize the endogeneity problem. The dependent vari-\nables for our models were measured at Wave 2 (1995),\nwhereas independent variables were either ascribed (i.e.,\ngender, age, race) or measured at Wave 1 (1992). Measures\nobtained in 1995 cannot go backward in time to affect mea-\nsures that were obtained in 1992; therefore, the estimates of\nthe parameters were less affected by endogeneity bias be-\ncause of the time ordering of our data (Davis, 1985). We did\nnot generalize about the total mutual, reciprocal effects\nacross the entire life course between health and socioeco-\nnomic conditions but rather limited the analysis to isolating\nthe net effects of particular independent variables on these\nspecific dependent variables for persons at this stage of the\nlife course.\nRESULTS\nTable 1 presents summary descriptive statistics and sam-\nple means for the independent variables used in the multi-\nvariate analyses. Each indicator was measured at baseline\nand reflected one of three life domains: demographic struc-\nture, economic position, or social integration. These explan-\natory variables spanned a broad range of factors previous\ninvestigators have clearly shown to be related to social con-\nstructions (self-rated) of health, either directly or indirectly\nThe data in Table 1 compare immigrants with native-born\npersons and indicate that immigrants tended to be Hispanic\nImmigrants had markedly lower levels of education (45.4%\nvs 25.6%) and were also more likely than native-born indi-\nviduals to have been laid off or unemployed (8.3% vs 4.7%)\nat Wave 1. The immigrants' health disadvantage, in part, re-\nflected their disadvantaged social class. Immigrants were\nslightly more likely to have data missing on home owner-\nship, employment problems, and nonhousing assets but\nwere more likely to report data on the social isolation vari-\nable.\nTable 2 contrasts the native-born to foreign-born men and\nwomen on five health measures. A profile of poor health\namong foreign-born persons emerges. Foreign-born men\nand women reported worse physical health and lower levels\nof emotional well-being. Because of the age structure of the\npopulation, only a small percentage of the sample had prob-\nlems carrying out ADLs, but more of those who had diffi-\nculties were immigrants. Overall, these data reveal that\ncompared with native-born men and women, foreign-born\nmen and women had worse health in 1995, consistent with\nother studies assessing nativity differences in various health\noutcomes (R. J. Angel & Angel, 1996; Santiago & Musch-\nkin, 1996) and supporting our first hypothesis.\nWe examined the heterogeneity of the immigrant popula-\ntion in terms of age at migration (Table 3) using the percent-\nage distribution of racial and ethnic characteristics in the\nimmigrant subsample by age at migration. A large percent-\nage of European immigrants (non-Hispanic Whites) moved\nto the United States during childhood and early adulthood\n(86.6%). Two-thirds of the Hispanics immigrated to the\nUnited States early in the life course (prior to turning 35\nyears old). Conversely, more than half of other ethnic\ngroups identified in the HRS sample (i.e., Blacks, Asians/\nother races) came to the United States after age 35.\nThe next step in our analysis was to contrast the health of\nnative-born respondents to those who immigrated in child-\nTable 1.

We calculated\na chi-square test for the gradient in proportions using the\nvariables shown in Table 4, the chi-square test results sup-\nported the hypothesis that the population proportions are or-\ndered across the four categories of age at immigration, indi-\ncating the degree of exposure to American society (i.e.,\nyears). The null hypothesis that the population proportions\nare all equal across the four categories was rejected. In each\ncase, the test statistic was greater than the critical value at\nthe .05 level of statistical significance.\nTable 4 displays the proportion reporting compromised\nADL function, poor physical health, and emotional distress\nby estimated duration of residence. There was a monotonic\nincrease in poor health with duration. This linear pattern\nwas statistically significant. Rank ordering respondents\nfrom native-born persons, early migrants, young adult mi-\ngrants, and late-life migrants, we found a compelling nega-\ntive association between time spent in the United States and\npoor health. Late-life immigrants were in worse health\nrespectively), individuals who moved to the United States at\na younger age (26.4%), and those who moved in early adult-\nhood (31.3%). A similar pattern was revealed for those late-\nlife immigrants reporting emotional distress, supporting our\nsecond hypothesis.\nTable 5 presents logistic regression results identifying the\nnet effect of socioeconomic predictors on health and daily\nfunctioning. Each of the dependent variables (ADL limita-\ntion, poor self-rated health, and emotional distress) was ana-\nlyzed in a two-step process. Model 1 included age at mi-\ngration and exogenous variables, with Model 2 adding\nindicators of socioeconomic status and social integration.\nThe results show that age at migration affected each of the\nthree health outcomes; however, the effect declined dramat-\nically when we controlled for socioeconomic factors. In pre-\ndicting ADL limitations, immigrants exhibited a higher risk\nof disability regardless of life course stage of migration.\nChildhood immigrants, young adult immigrants, and mid-\nlife immigrants were each significantly more likely than na-\ntive-born individuals to report ADL disability, 86%, 64%,\nand 99%, respectively. In terms of self-assessed health, a\nsimilar pattern was revealed in Model 1, but the relative risk\nwas much stronger for young adult and midlife migrants,\nwith midlife migrants more than twice as likely to report\npoor health than others. However, in Model 2, the effect of\nmigration disappeared. The results for emotional distress\nwere more consistent across Models 1 and 2. In both mod-\nels, childhood migrants were statistically indistinguishable\nfrom native-born persons. The effect of duration of resi-\ndence was further shown by the higher risk associated with\nmidlife migration when compared with young adult migra-\ntion. Midlife migrants were nearly three times more likely\nto report emotional distress in Model 1 and nearly two times\nmore likely to report emotional distress in Model 2. Results\nfor emotional distress supported our second hypothesis be-\ncause migrants with longer duration of residence exhibited\nlower risk of poor health.\nOur initial demographic measures, age, gender, and mari-\ntal status, displayed consistent results across both models.\nInterestingly, women were only at a statistically significant\nrisk for emotional distress, but only when we did not control\nfor socioeconomic variables. Gender did not influence the\nrelative risk for compromised ADLs or poor self-rated\nhealth. Age exhibited an effect across our three dependent\nvariables and across Models 1 and 2. The odds ratios were\nmodest, but we note that age was measured continuously,\nand therefore the cumulative effect may be substantial. Con-\ntrary to its effect on physical health, age decreased the risk\nfor emotional distress. The risk of being in poor health out-\nside a marital union was substantial for all three dependent\nvariables in Model 1, with the nonmarried nearly twice as\nlikely to report ADL limitation, poor self-assessed health,\nand emotional distress, respectively (odds ratio [OR] 2.18,\nwhen we controlled for socioeconomic indicators but re-\nAs expected, sociocultural variables substantially influ-\nenced health. As noted previously, the addition of these\nvariables erased the effect of immigration for physical\nhealth indicators. Two of our three measures of financial\nwealth, low income and few assets, increased the log odds of\na respondent's reporting poor physical and emotional health.\nThe interpretation of these variables was complicated by\ntheir highly correlated dummies for missing information.\nEmployment problems at Wave 1 increased the risk of poor\nhealth assessments at Wave 2 but were not associated with\nADL limitation. This finding indicates that employment dif-\nficulties were not associated with objective physical limita-\ntions. Last, social isolation, measured as unfamiliarity with\nneighbors, exhibited a modest but consistent effect on health\nacross the three dependent variables. Socially isolated indi-\nviduals were 30% more likely to have compromised ADLs,\nTable 3.

Immigration generally, and duration of res-\nidence specifically, did not appear to affect physical indica-\ntors of health. However, our expectations concerning immi-\ngrant risk and the importance of duration were borne out\nin the results on emotional distress. Midlife immigrants\nreported substantially higher risk for emotional distress\n(84%), whereas young adult migrants faced a moderate risk\n(37%). Childhood immigrants, those with the longest dura-\ntion of residence, resembled native-born individuals. The\ncomposition of immigrants by race and Hispanic ethnicity\nvaried dramatically by age at migration. To further specify\nour findings on duration, we next performed analyses in-\ncluding race and ethnicity to address our third hypothesis.\nAlthough the initial multivariate logistic regressions as-\nsessed the impact of duration on health (physical and emo-\ntional) and ADL disability after social resources were con-\ntrolled, they did not account for race. In the next analyses\n(Table 6), we included terms for race (Black) and Hispanic\nethnicity and in the final stage tested interaction terms for\nrace and duration. In Model 1, it was clear that Black and\nHispanic respondents faced a statistically higher risk of\npoor physical and emotional health, yet the inclusion of race\nand Hispanic ethnicity did not substantively alter the results\nin the previous table. Black respondents were 67% more\nlikely to report compromised ADLs, 63% more likely to re-\nport poor self-rated health, and 23% more likely to report\nemotional distress than non-Hispanic Whites. Hispanics\nspectively).\nTo directly address our third hypothesis on the variation\nof duration among immigrants, we added interaction effects\nfor midlife Black and Hispanic immigrants in Model 2. The\ninteraction effects were telling. Blacks coming to the United\nStates in midlife (with low duration of residence) were less\nlikely than native-born Blacks or longer term immigrants to\nreport poor physical and emotional health. The inclusion of\nthe interaction effects did not change the health risks associ-\nated with the rest of the model.\nThe models in Table 6 suggest a complicated picture.\nBlacks and Hispanics were at significantly higher risk for\npoor health than non-Hispanic Whites, with the exception of\nrecent Black immigrants. Models not including race may\nconclude that the emotional health disadvantage for immi-\ngrants diminishes with increased duration, but this may not\nbe the case. Increased duration of residence may enable im-\nmigrants to acquire the socioeconomic rewards indicative of\nnative-born persons, explaining why the inclusion of socio-\neconomic indicators washes out the predictive values of age\nat migration. At the same time, in comparison with native-\nborn persons, minority immigrants facing the disadvantages\nassociated with being Black in the United States may find\nthe barrier of race makes it more difficult to overcome the\nstatus of being an immigrant.\nDISCUSSION\nThis study highlights the complex interplay of nativity,\nduration of residence, and race/ethnicity on health profiles.\nThe results are as anticipated in the first hypothesis; immi-\ngrants face a self-assessed health disadvantage. Nativity is a\nproximate risk factor for ADL disability, poor physical\nhealth, and emotional distress, but the effect largely oper-\nates through socioeconomic characteristics.\nTable 5.

Respondents immigrating early in life resemble\nnative-born individuals, whereas individuals immigrating in\nyoung adulthood or midlife are significantly different. This\nmay be a result of lower health care access in their country of\norigin than that for child immigrants and native-born persons.\nOur third hypothesis is not strongly supported. It is clear\nthat in the United States, analyses of duration should take\ninto account the changing racial/ethnic composition of im-\nmigrants. The dramatic racial differences among immi-\ngrants across time may preclude a clear delineation of the\neffects of duration. Race complicates the effects of duration\non emotional health. It may be the case that the adverse ef-\nfects of race/ethnicity lessen the positive effects of assimila-\ntion and integration associated with increased duration of\nresidence. Across our models, Blacks and Hispanics (both\nnative and foreign born) face a significant self-assessed\nhealth disadvantage. Only further empirical analyses into\nthe relationship between duration as it relates to race and\nHispanic ethnicity will clarify these patterns.\nAlthough intriguing, these results are preliminary. Two\nmajor avenues for further work examining the salience of\nnativity on health emerge. First, as data allow, investigators\nshould pursue more sophisticated longitudinal modeling\nopportunities to assess the dynamic determinants of health\nacross time for aging non-Hispanic Whites, Blacks, and\nHispanics. Second, additional research should focus on the\nprecise delineation of issues such as economic assimilation\nand social and family support, and on detailed analyses of\nanticipated and actual monetary and nonmonetary remit-\ntances to children, siblings, and elderly parents. Access to\nstructural supports, such as health insurance and supple-\nmental medical insurance coverage (public and private),\ncould be more fully developed in studies emphasizing the\nconfluence of nativity and ethnicity on health as individuals\nnear retirement. Subsequent longitudinal analyses would\nalso benefit from assessment of the compositional effects of\nincome and tests of specific wealth thresholds on health.\nThis will illuminate the specific mechanisms through which\nincome affects health and, ultimately, shed light on the en-\ndogenous relationship between income and physical well-\nbeing profiles in the years prior and subsequent to retire-\nment. Models need to also explore the utility of household-\nrather than individual-based analyses.\nAlthough our findings are only a modest step toward un-\nderstanding the intricate relationship between nativity and\nhealth dynamics, they provide strong justification for con-\ntinued research along these lines. Further work should ad-\ndress these issues; the impact of Hispanic subgroups and\nAsian Americans on these health outcomes would be partic-\nularly informative. Consistent with the literature, and as\nthese analyses demonstrate, when comparing health and\nwell-being researchers should not assume that risk factors\nfor poor health, such as nativity, act uniformly across racial\nand ethnic groups.\nTable 6.
