Greil5\nJulia McQuillan6\n Introduction\nDemographers interested in fertility trends and projections have long considered the\nrole of infertility, particularly in analyses of developing countries (see Rutstein and\nShah 2004). When surveyed about infertility, the lay public also understands the term\n`infertility' to mean a permanent inability to give birth (Maill 1994). Yet the medical\ndefinition of infertility  12 months or more of unprotected, heterosexual intercourse\nwithout conception (American Society for Reproductive Medicine [ASRM] 2008),\nsometimes referred to as subfecundity  does not indicate permanent involuntary\nchildlessness. The proportion of women in the US who experience infertility using the\nASRM definition is 7% to 15.5% in a given year depending upon specific measurement\nprocedures (Thoma et al. 2013). The percentage is substantially higher (51.8%) for\nwomen who have met the ASRM criteria at some point throughout their reproductive\nlifespan (Greil et al. 2011a). Little is known about how women who experience\ninfertility (e.g., meet the medical criteria) or identify as having a fertility problem (i.e.,\nwith or without meeting the medical criteria) think about their fertility intentions and\ndesires compared to women without infertility experiences. Further, it is not known\nhow infertility affects birth outcomes in countries such as the United States, where over\n10% of all women trying to become pregnant seek medical treatment for infertility\n(Simonsen, Baksh, and Stanford 2012). Fears of infertility and decisions about how to\nrespond to failures to conceive may influence fertility intentions, desires, and outcomes.\nYet scant research has examined these relationships. We therefore use the National\nSurvey of Fertility Barriers (NSFB) to explore the associations between infertility and\nfertility intentions, fertility desires, and the ideal number of children among US women\nages 2545 by fertility status (not infertile, medically infertile, self-identifying as\ninfertile without meeting the medical definition of infertility, and self-identifying as\ninfertile with experience of infertility) and motherhood status (childless and having one\nor more children). We further examine how infertility and motherhood predict the\nlikelihood of a birth in the three years after the initial interview.\nDemographic Research: Volume 35, Article 39\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 1151\n1.1 Connecting the infertility experience and identity with demographic research\non fertility\nInfertility is an interesting phenomenon for fertility researchers and theorists who study\nfertility intentions. Though seemingly straightforward, infertility does not necessarily\nhave clear implications for fertility considerations. Demographers have long realized\nthe importance of infertility at the societal level for measures of fertility trends. For\nexample, Davis and Blake (1956) identified intermediate fertility variables including\nsterility, which included noncontraceptive sterility, or what we think of today as\ninfertility or subfecundity. Calculations predicting fertility trends measure infertility in\ndifferent ways: Stover (1998) suggested including a measure of sterility in fertility\ncalculations that includes women in a union who are not menopausal, postpartum\namenorrheic, or pregnant but have not given birth within the past five years despite not\nusing contraception, as well as women who declare themselves to be infertile.\nMascarenhas and colleagues (2012) have applied this approach to Demographic Health\nSurvey data from 53 countries, for example, in an effort to determine the global\nprevalence of infertility.\nThus, whereas the demographic approach often infers infertility from questions on\ncouple status, contraception use, and fertility desires (Mascarenhas et al. 2012), the\nmedical approach utilizes questions focused on meeting the medical criteria for\ninfertility (e.g., \"Have you ever had a period of at least 12 months of regular,\nunprotected sexual intercourse without becoming pregnant?\") and perceptions of a\nfertility problem (e.g., \"Do you see yourself as someone who has had trouble trying to\nconceive?\"). The medical approach, therefore, can identify individuals or couples who\nmay benefit from medical assistance to achieve conception, whereas the demographic\napproach is typically seeking to identify women who are not likely to become pregnant.\nIn the demographic- and social-science literatures, we are perhaps most familiar with\ninfertile women who are involuntarily childless. This is a meaningful group for both\ndemographic and social scientists, as this group has important implications for fertility-\nrate calculations (Bongaarts and Potter 2013) and because infertility is particularly\ndistressing for women who are childless and have strong fertility desires\n(Schwerdtfeger and Shreffler 2009). Yet the majority of women who experience\ninfertility do not remain childless (Schwerdtfeger and Shreffler 2009). Further, while\nwe might expect a great deal of overlap between experiencing a period of infertility\n(e.g., not getting pregnant after at least a year of regular, unprotected heterosexual\nintercourse) and realizing that there might be a fertility problem, there are surprising\ndiscrepancies. A substantial proportion of women (35%) who meet the medical criteria\ndo not view themselves as being infertile (White et al. 2006). Surprisingly, there are\nalso women who do not appear to meet the medical criteria for infertility but believe\nthat they have a fertility problem or expect to have a problem when they start trying to\nShreffler et al.: Infertility and fertility intentions, desires, and outcomes among US women\n1152 http://www.demographic-research.org\nconceive. A study of unmarried adults aged 1829, for example, found that 19% of\nwomen believed that they were \"very likely\" to be infertile, and having this belief was\nassociated with contraceptive behaviors (Polis and Zabin 2012). Infertility, therefore,\ncould affect fertility in two directions. Women who meet the medical criteria for\ninfertility are not getting pregnant, at least temporarily. Women who identify as infertile\nbut do not meet the medical criteria may actually be more likely to give birth due to\ntheir beliefs that contraception to prevent birth is unnecessary. Moreover, if women\nwho are infertile do not think that they will become pregnant, these births could be\nclassified as `unintended' due to the current measurement of fertility intentions..\n1.2 What does it mean to \"intend to give birth\" in the context of infertility?\nTheoretical conceptualizations of fertility intentions suggest that they are shaped by the\ndesire for a particular outcome, a belief that taking an action will result in that desired\noutcome, and a commitment to perform the action (Malle, Moses, and Baldwin 2003).\nAjzen and Klobas (2013) suggest that one factor affecting fertility intentions is the\ndegree of perceived control that individuals have over their fertility. Women who are\ninfertile may not believe that taking an action (e.g., stopping contraception, predicting\novulation) will result in pregnancy. Yet the experience of infertility alone may not be\nenough to influence fertility intentions and behaviors. It may require conscious\nprocessing of this experience, resulting in identification of a fertility problem. Thus,\nthere needs to be a consideration of both the experience of infertility and the perception\nof infertility. Not all women who meet the medical criteria for infertility are aware that\nthey have a problem (Greil and McQuillan 2010). Indeed, it is the perception of\ninfertility that matters more for psychological outcomes than merely meeting the\nmedical criteria for infertility (Greil et al. 2011b).\nTherefore, women who have given thought to their fertility experiences and have\ncome to realize that they have trouble becoming pregnant may be particularly\nsusceptible to influences of infertility on their fertility intentions. Fertility-intentions\nquestions seemingly assume the ability to carry out intentions; for example, the 2006\n2010 National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) asked respondents, \"Looking to the\nfuture, do you intend to have (a/another) child at some time?\" followed by, \"How sure\nare you that you (will/will not) have a baby?\" Often, these questions are coded into one\nmeasure ranging from `very sure, do not intend' to `very sure, intend' (e.g., Thomson\n1997), which is then used to predict future fertility (e.g., Schoen et al. 1999) or\nintendedness of a birth (e.g., Maximova and Quesnel-Vall\u00e9e 2009).\nYet, infertility calls into question the meaning of fertility intentions when the\noutcomes are uncertain, especially if respondents are asked to report intentions within a\nDemographic Research: Volume 35, Article 39\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 1153\nparticular time frame. McQuillan et al. (2015) suggest a stronger emphasis on identity is\nneeded in studies of fertility intentions in addition to the more structural (i.e., life\ncourse) and cultural (i.e., values) approaches often used. Though they focused on\nmotherhood identity, we suggest that identifying as infertile may be another salient\nidentity in the study of fertility intentions. Because perception of infertility and meeting\nthe medical criteria of infertility are often not synonymous constructs, measuring them\nseparately allows for more-refined investigation of associations between infertility and\nfertility intentions, desires, ideals, and outcomes. For example, the uncertainty of the\noutcome following perceived infertility raises interesting questions about fertility\nintentions. What do intentions mean for women who may strongly want to give birth or\navoid giving birth but are uncertain about their ability to be able to conceive? Do they\nreport strong intentions (e.g., very sure that they intend or do not intend to give birth),\nor do they downgrade or downplay their intentions even if they might want to have a\nbaby, or alternatively, do they downplay intentions if they plan to avoid pregnancy\nbecause it seems unnecessary to have strong intentions not to have a baby while\ninfertile? Do infertile women reduce their intentions, and possibly their preferred\nnumber of children, to meet their expectations of lowered fertility, perhaps because they\nare trying to be realistic about what they believe is possible? On the other hand, does\nconcern over infertility increase their desire to have a baby and/or preferred family size,\nresulting in inflated preferences? And finally, are infertile women able to have the\nnumber of children that they want to have, or does meeting the medical criteria for\ninfertility predict a lower likelihood of a birth?\n2. Data and methods\nOur data comes from the National Survey of Fertility Barriers (NSFB), a random digit-\ndialing telephone survey of 4,712 women of childbearing ages (25\u00ad45) and a subset of\ntheir husbands and partners. The study was designed to assess social and health factors\nrelated to reproductive choices and fertility for US women. The first wave was collected\nrepresentative, with an oversample of Black and Hispanic women and women with\nfertility problems. Analyses for this study are weighted to account for the oversamples.\nOur sample for fertility intentions and desires analyses is restricted to 2,978 women\nwho are not surgically sterilized or in a heterosexual marriage or cohabiting relationship\nwith a man who has been surgically sterilized. Our sample for the analysis examining\nShreffler et al.: Infertility and fertility intentions, desires, and outcomes among US women\n1154 http://www.demographic-research.org\nbirth odds by infertility and parity status includes 1,547 women from the first sample\nwho participated in the wave-two interview.\nDependent variables. In our first set of multivariate analyses utilizing wave-one data\nonly, we examine three dependent variables targeting fertility intentions, wants, and\nideals. In a subsequent analysis, we utilize these variables as predictor variables of\nwhether or not a birth occurred between survey waves. The first dependent variable,\nfertility intentions, is based on two questions that are combined to create an ordinal\nmeasure of fertility intentions. Respondents were asked, \"Do you intend to have a\nbaby?\" and \"Of course, sometimes things do not work out exactly as we intend them to,\nor something makes us change our minds. In your case, how sure are you that you\nwill/will not have a child?\" Responses were coded so that low scores indicate, \"Very\nsure, do not intend,\" (2) and high scores indicate, \"Very sure, do intend\" (+2). Women\nwho said they \"don't know\" their intentions, who said they cannot have children, or\nwho said they would let God or nature decide are coded 0 (the center of the scale).\nThese questions are similar to those used in the National Survey of Families and\nHouseholds; we recoded the response categories so that a positive score indicates\nintending and a negative score indicates not intending to have a baby. Our second\ndependent variable, want a baby, is measured by a question asking, \"In the future,\nwould you like to have a(nother) baby?\" Responses are coded from 1 (definitely no) to\n4 (definitely yes). Ideal number of children was measured by asking, \"How many\nchildren would you consider to be ideal for you?\" and coded from 0 to 5, with 5\nincluding preferences of five or more children. Birth between waves is an indicator\nvariable where 1 means that the respondent gave birth between waves.\nInfertility and parity groups. We categorized women as medically infertile if\nthey had ever had a period of 12 months or more during which they had unprotected\nheterosexual intercourse and did not get pregnant. We considered women to be self-\nidentifying as infertile if they answered yes to either, \"Do you think of yourself as\nsomeone who has, has had, or might have trouble getting pregnant?\" or \"Do you think\nof yourself as someone who has or has had fertility problems?\" Three distinct groups\nwere created: women who were medically infertile but did not self-identify as infertile,\nwomen who did not meet the medical criteria for infertility but did identify as infertile,\nand women who both met medical criteria and self-identified as infertile. A fourth\ngroup, of non-infertile women (answering no to both the self-identification and\nmedically infertile questions), was also included in the study. These four groups were\nDemographic Research: Volume 35, Article 39\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 1155\nfurther split by parity, comparing women who were childless to women who had at\nleast one biological child.\nSociodemographic control variables. Age is a continuous variable and ranges\nfrom 25 to 45 in our sample. Married was measured by a question about marital status,\nwith 1 indicating that the respondent was married at the time of the interview.\nCohabiting was coded by either a voluntary response to the marital status question or a\nyes to a follow-up question, \"Are you currently living with a romantic partner?\" Single\nwomen who are neither married nor in a cohabiting relationship are the reference\ncategory. Education (in years) is a continuous variable, ranging from 2 to 22 in our\nsample. Race/ethnicity is included as a dummy variable for Black, Hispanic, and \"Other\nrace,\" with White respondents as the reference category.\n2.3 Analytic strategy\nWe first provide an overview of the sample, comparing descriptive statistics\n(means/percentages) of all study variables by infertility and parity status. To examine\ndifferences within infertility and parity groups, we employed Bonferroni post-hoc tests.\nThe differences in distributions of our variables by parity motivated our decision to run\nseparate multivariate analyses for women with young children and women with 1 or\nmore children.\nOur first multivariate analysis uses stereotype logistic regression (SLM) to predict\nfertility intentions and desires. Both fertility intentions and fertility desires are measured\non an ordinal scale, but ordinal logistic regression assumes that the distance between\neach category is the same (proportional odds) (Long and Freese 2006). We tested the\nproportional-odds assumption using a likelihood-ratio test and a Brant test. Our\nsensitivity analyses suggested that coefficients for both fertility intentions and fertility\ndesires were significantly different, which violates the proportional-odds assumption.\nSLM does not require proportional odds and is therefore a more appropriate method for\nvariables that have unequal distances between response options.\nNext, we conducted an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analysis to\nexamine the predictors of one's ideal number of children. Because `ideal number of\nchildren' is a count variable ranging from 0 to 5, we also performed a sensitivity\nanalysis using a Poisson modeling approach; the results were robust across modeling\nstrategies. We present findings from the more widely used OLS models because they\nare more intuitive to interpret. Finally, we conducted a logistic regression analysis to\nestimate associations between infertility statuses and intentions by parity and the odds\nof giving birth in the three years between waves of the study.\nShreffler et al.: Infertility and fertility intentions, desires, and outcomes among US women\n1156 http://www.demographic-research.org\n3. Results\nResults indicate that infertility experience and identity shape fertility intentions and\ndesires in interesting ways. The means and percentages of fertility intentions, desires for\na baby, and ideal number of children are provided in Table 1 by infertility- and parity-\ngroup statuses. Findings reveal that childless women at the extremes of the infertility\ncontinuum have the highest overall fertility intentions, including women who are not\ninfertile and those who are both medically infertile and self-identifying as infertile; all\nother groups had negative scores on the intentions variable, indicating that the average\nresponse was a no to the question on intentions to have a child. The `desire to have a\nbaby' and `ideal number of children' variables reveal a different pattern, however.\nChildless women in every group had higher scores for wanting to have a baby than\nwomen with children. Women without children who both identify as infertile and meet\nmedical criteria for infertility, however, had the highest mean score (M=3.36),\nindicating their responses to wanting a baby were between \"definitely yes\" and\n\"probably yes.\" Further, when asked how many children would be ideal for them,\nwomen who already had at least one child reported more children as ideal across every\ncategory of infertility. Among childless women, however, those who experienced\ninfertility and identified as infertile reported the highest ideal number of children\n(M=2.35). At the bivariate level, therefore, it appears that women at the extreme end of\ninfertility  those who are both medically infertile and identifying as infertile  have\nhigher fertility intentions, are more likely to report wanting to have a baby, and report a\nhigher ideal number of children than women in other groups. Women who already had\nat least one child at the first wave and were not infertile were significantly more likely\nto have given birth by wave two compared to women who only met the medical criteria\nand women with children who met the medical criteria and identified as infertile.\nStereotype regression analyses, presented in Table 2, indicate similar patterns.\nRegardless of parity, women who have experienced a fertility problem and identify as\nhaving a fertility problem report higher levels of fertility intentions and desire to have a\nbaby. Fertility status was not associated with significantly higher levels of fertility\nintentions for childless women. Among women with children, those who self-identified\nonly and those who identified and experienced infertility had higher odds of being very\nsure that they intend to have more children versus being very sure that they will not\nhave more children relative to women without fertility problems (OR=2.13; OR=1.64).\nAmong childless women, the odds of definitely wanting a child versus definitely not\nincrease significantly by an odds ratio of 7.62. Among mothers, identifying a fertility\nproblem (with [OR=4.12] and without [OR2.34] meeting medical criteria for\ninfertility) the odds of definitely wanting another child are also significantly higher as\ncompared to mothers without fertility problems.\nDemographic Research: Volume 35, Article 39\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 1157\nTable 1: Means of dependent and sociodemographic variables by fertility and\nChildless 1+Child\nNot\ninfertile\nMedically\ninfertile\nSelf-ID\ninfertile\nInfertile\n& ID Post hoc2\nNot\ninfertile\nMedically\ninfertile\nSelf-ID\ninfertile\nInfertile\n& ID Post hoc2\nIntentions and desires\nSociodemographic variables\nSource: Wave 1 & Wave 2 National Survey of Fertility Barriers, N=2,978.\n1.

Among childless women, those who were both medically infertile and self-\nidentified as infertile reported wanting more children than their fertile counterparts,\nsupporting the notion that infertility may be driving the higher preferences for\nchildbearing among infertile women. The pattern is not the same among women who\nalready had children (parity of one or more). Among mothers, those who were\nmedically infertile wanted significantly more children than fertile women, net of other\nfactors.\nTable 3: OLS regression analyses of the association between fertility,\nsociodemographic variables, and ideal number of children by parity\nIdeal number of children\nChildless 1+Child\nb se b se\nInfertility status\nNot infertile (Ref)\nSociodemographic variables\nUnmarried (Ref)\nWhite (Ref)\nSource: Wave 1 National Survey of Fertility Barriers.\nShreffler et al.: Infertility and fertility intentions, desires, and outcomes among US women\n1160 http://www.demographic-research.org\nAre fertility and parity statuses associated with the odds of a birth between waves?\nTo answer this question, on Table 4, we present odds ratios from multivariate logistic\nregression models exploring whether fertility status, intentions, and desires influenced\nthe likelihood of giving birth between waves, controlling for a rich array of\nsociodemographic characteristics. We ran separate sets of models for childless women\nand women with children. Our first model examines only fertility status. Among\nchildless women, those who were medically infertile were 66% less likely to give birth\nbetween waves, relative to fertile women (OR=.34). And among those who were\nalready mothers, medically infertile women were about 60% less likely to give birth\nbetween waves, relative to fertile women (OR=.38). Likewise, mothers who were both\nmedically infertile and self-identified as infertile were significantly less likely than\nfertile women to have children between waves (OR=.31). Next, we added fertility\nintentions and desires in model two. Lastly, our third model includes all variables.\nFertility intentions and desires were positively associated with the likelihood of having\na child between waves. Taking into account fertility intentions and desires largely\nreduced the difference between fertile and medically infertile mothers. Conversely,\nmothers who experienced infertility and identified as infertile were significantly less\nlikely to have children, even when we take intentions and desires into account. Among\nchildless women, those who met the medical criteria only remained significantly less\nlikely to give birth between waves compared to fertile childless women. Our findings\nsuggest that birth outcomes differ by parity. Among childless women, those who met\nthe medical criteria only were significantly less likely to give birth between waves.\nInterestingly, we find that among mothers, women who meet medical criteria for\ninfertility and self-identify as infertile were least likely to meet their expectations,\ndespite having the highest preferences for having children. As expected, women who\nmeet the medical criteria for infertility have significantly fewer children on average\nthan women who do not meet criteria for infertility.\nDemographic Research: Volume 35, Article 39\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 1161\nTable 4: Logistic regression analyses of the association between infertility,\nfertility, sociodemographic variables, and birth between waves by\nChildless 1+ Child\nOR se OR se OR se OR se OR se OR se\nInfertility and fertility variables\nNot infertile (Ref)\nFertility intentions W1\n(Centered)\nIdeal number of children\n(Centered)\nSociodemographic variables\nUnmarried (Ref)\nWhite (Ref)\nSource: Wave 1 and Wave 2 National Survey of Fertility Barriers.\nExponentiated coefficients; Standard errors in parentheses.\nBirth between waves reflect a smaller subset of respondents re-interviewed at Wave 2, N=1,547.\n4. Conclusions\nDespite a growing body of literature on infertility/subfecundity in demographic and\nsocial-science fields, little is known about the associations between infertility and\nfertility intentions, desires, and birth outcomes. Further, extant research typically fails\nShreffler et al.: Infertility and fertility intentions, desires, and outcomes among US women\n1162 http://www.demographic-research.org\nto differentiate between those who meet the medical criteria but do not realize they are\ninfertile, those who perceive themselves to have a fertility problem although they do not\nmeet the medical criteria for infertility, and those who both meet the medical criteria\nand identify as infertile. A few exceptions are Greil and colleagues' work on the\n\"hidden infertile\" (Greil et al. 2009) and the link between perceiving a fertility problem\nand distress about infertility (Greil et al. 2011b).\nThe findings presented here highlight the importance of both the experience of\ninfertility and identification as a person with fertility problems for fertility intentions,\ndesires, and birth outcomes. Supporting theories of intentions that suggest that an\noutcome needs to be certain to formulate an intention (Ajzen and Klobas 2013; Malle,\nMoses, and Baldwin 2003), we found that fertility intentions were highest for women\nwho had never experienced infertility and were childless at the time of the first\ninterview. Taken at face value, this might suggest that women who meet the medical\ncriteria or perceive that they are infertile are not trying to get pregnant. Yet when we\nexplored fertility desires further, we found that women who both meet the medical\ncriteria and identify as infertile report significantly greater desires to have a baby.\nAmong childless women, they also have a much higher ideal number of children than\nother women in the sample. Of course, simply wanting a birth may not predict one,\nespecially for women who have met the medical criteria for infertility in the past.\nIndeed, our findings indicate that, regardless of parity, women who met the medical\ncriteria for infertility but did not identify as having a fertility problem at the first survey\nwave were less likely to give birth by the second wave. Women who identified as\ninfertile but did not meet the medical criteria at the first wave were actually more likely\nto give births between waves than women who were not infertile, though the difference\nwas not significant.\nThese findings suggest that fertility intentions may not be the best predictors of\nbirths for women who have experienced infertility and/or identify as someone with\nfertility problems. The uncertainty of whether or not they will be able to give birth may\nprevent them from reporting a strong intention to have a baby. Bachrach and Morgan\n(2013) have called for greater theory development \"at the intersection of cognitive\nscience, social science, and social demography\" (page 480) to better understand fertility\nintentions and their realization. In particular, they argue that fertility researchers need\nimproved understanding of how mental and social phenomena are related to intentions\n(Bachrach and Morgan 2013). This study provides an example of when intentions may\nnot be as meaningful or predictive for fertility outcomes. Because of the substantial\nminority of women who experience infertility each year, our findings have important\nimplications for theory and research regarding fertility intentions.\nOur findings also highlight the importance of distinguishing between experiencing\ninfertility and identifying as infertile; moreover, these classifications of infertility\nDemographic Research: Volume 35, Article 39\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 1163\nmatter in different ways for fertility intentions vs. outcomes. Not surprisingly, identity\nmatters for fertility intentions; women who view themselves as having a fertility\nproblem, especially when they also have met the medical criteria for infertility, are\nreporting lower fertility intentions but greater desires to have a baby and higher family\nsize preferences. This is problematic because women who believe that they have\nfertility problems may be assigned lower values on fertility intentions measures despite\nwanting (and perhaps trying) to have a baby, and any births may be misidentified as\nunplanned or unwanted when they do give birth. Interestingly, it appears that women\nwho fail to realize a fertility problem when, in fact, they meet the criteria for infertility,\nare least likely to give birth. This finding has important implications as well; this may\nbe one reason why fertility outcomes do not always match intentions. There are also\nimportant medical implications, as women who do not identify as having fertility\nproblems may be less likely to seek treatment that could help them achieve a desired\nOf course, the results of this study should be interpreted with caution in light of its\nlimitations. First, respondents' infertility statuses relied on retrospective reports of\nperiods of 12 months or more during which respondents had regular, unprotected\nheterosexual intercourse with no pregnancy. To our knowledge, there have been no\nstudies examining the validity of retrospective reports of infertility episodes. Integrating\nmedical records with survey data would provide a more accurate classification of\ninfertility episodes. Given our significant findings for infertility experience, however,\nwe are confident that, if anything, our findings provide conservative estimates. Second,\nalthough the study participants were of reproductive age and not surgically sterilized,\nthe timing of the infertility episode(s) varied; in some cases, the infertility episodes\noccurred more than 10 years before the survey interview. Again, we suspect that, if\nanything, this might make our findings more conservative than a study that includes\nonly women currently experiencing infertility. Due to the much smaller percentage of\nwomen who experience infertility in a given year as compared to women who ever\nexperience infertility, it is difficult to assess these relationships with such small\nsamples. Another limitation related to this issue of small cell counts when creating four\ngroups of infertility statuses is that we were only able to utilize two groups of parity\nstatuses (women with and without children).\nFuture research should explore infertility-group membership and possible\nselectivity. It is unclear, for example, why many women who have not met the medical\ncriteria for infertility perceive themselves as infertile. It is also unclear why some\nwomen meet the medical criteria for infertility but do not recognize that they might\nhave a fertility problem. Future prospective data-collection efforts are encouraged to\ninclude questions that allow for the classification of women into infertility categories,\nincluding identity and experience, and follow women over time to more definitively\nShreffler et al.: Infertility and fertility intentions, desires, and outcomes among US women\n1164 http://www.demographic-research.org\nillustrate the ways in which infertility affects fertility. Future research is also\nencouraged to investigate the reverse relationship between fertility intentions, wants,\nand ideals and perception of a fertility problem. The meaning of the period of infertility\nmay matter for outcomes; not all women who are not contracepting are actively\n\"trying\" to get pregnant (Johnson et al. 2014). Whereas some women may experience a\nrelatively long period of unprotected sex without conception and not consider it a\nproblem, those who are hoping or trying for a pregnancy may self-identify a problem\nbefore they meet the medical criteria for infertility\nDespite limitations, our findings suggest that women who meet the medical criteria\nfor infertility and/or identify as having a fertility problem are a special case for fertility-\nintentions and -outcomes research and theory. This study highlights the need for more\nin-depth probing of fertility plans, desires, and contraceptive behaviors when women\nbelieve that they may not be able to conceive. Simply asking these women if they\nintend to give birth may be an inadequate question.\nDemographic Research: Volume 35, Article 39\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 1165\nReferences\nAjzen, I. and Klobas, J.
