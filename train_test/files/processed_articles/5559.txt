Since\nDarwin (1859) first pinpointed the altruism problem, evolutionary models based on conditional\nreciprocity, such as reciprocal altruism (Trivers, 1971), risk reduction (Cashdan, 1985), and\ntolerated theft (Blurton Jones, 1987), have provided valuable insight into the dynamics of\ncooperative behavior. However, many cases of human sharing, such as meat allocation by\nhunters in foraging societies, appear to come with no strings attached (Smith, Bliege Bird, and\nBird, 2002; Sosis, 2000). With an increasing interest in incidents of unconditional sharing, new\napproaches for understanding non-kin human sharing have emerged. Costly signaling theory\n(CST) has proven a useful tool for explicating cases of conspicuous generosity (Gurven, Allen-\nStatus signaling in peer-to-peer networks\nArave, Hill, and Hurtado, 2000; Zahavi and Zahavi, 1997) and other forms of wasteful\nadvertising (Neiman, 1998). Peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing networks are contemporary\nexamples of large-scale generosity in which altruists (file uploaders) share digital data such as\nmusic with non-reciprocating free riders (file downloaders) via the Internet. This research\naddresses the altruism problem by testing evolutionary hypotheses about non-kin sharing within\nthe novel milieu of P2P file-sharing networks.\nP2P file-sharing networks such as Limewire allow free downloading of music and other\ndigital media from the computers of anonymous uploaders. In this study, we define a downloader\nas a file sharer who strictly downloads files without contributing digital data to the network; we\ndefine an uploader as a file sharer who downloads files, but additionally contributes digital\nmedia to the file-sharing system. File sharing is convenient and virtually risk-free for\ndownloaders, most of whom simply log on to an online file-sharing program, choose the desired\nmedia from a variety of uploaders, copy the file to a computer hard drive, and log off. Uploaders,\non the other hand, allow other file sharers direct access to their computer's hard drive, which can\nincrease susceptibility to computer viruses and hackers. Most significantly, uploaders are the\ntarget of well-publicized attempts by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) to\ndeter infringement of copyright laws, and can be fined up to $150,000 for sharing files online\n(Rainie and Madden, 2004). The zealous uploader further increases such risks by leaving his or\nher computer on overnight and while at work or school, which allows other file sharers to\ndownload large files such as movies or TV sitcoms. In light of the benefit downloaders enjoy\nwith little cost, it comes as no surprise that the majority of file sharers are downloaders, whereas\nuploaders represent only a small proportion of file sharers. From this intriguing sharing system\nan evolutionary paradox emerges: why do uploaders risk prosecution and other tangible costs, to\nprovide free digital data to a large number of non-reciprocating downloaders?\nWhen modeling human altruism, a researcher may observe naturally-occurring\nphenomena (e.g., Smith et al., 2002), implement an experimental protocol (e.g., Henrich et al.,\n2005), or test theoretical sharing strategies using game theory (e.g., Axelrod and Hamilton,\n1981), all of which are methodologies with intrinsic benefits and shortcomings. A current\nmethodological focus on hypothetical scenarios of economic resource exchange (such as the\nDictator and Ultimatum games) has contributed an abundance of data on non-kin sharing, but\nseldom do these experimental methods reflect real-life dynamics of human reciprocity (Sullivan\nand Lyle, 2005). In contrast to the artificial parameters of economic game theory, P2P file-\nsharing networks are observable, ubiquitous phenomena that involve repeated, real-life resource\nexchange between millions of distantly related strangers throughout the world. These dynamic\nsharing systems--which transcend language, social and geographic boundaries--provide a\nunique opportunity to test evolutionary hypotheses about unconditional sharing.\nZahavi (1975) proposed that the effectiveness of sexual selection lies in its ability to\nprovide information to the selecting sex about the quality of the selected sex. Females are more\noften the selecting sex, since they endure disproportionate costs associated with reproduction\n(e.g. gestation, parental care). As a result, males in most mammalian species vie for access to\nmates by signaling an underlying quality directly to a female or by competing for status among\nother males. Zahavi's handicap principle (1975, 1977) contends that by exhibiting a costly\ndisplay such as an elaborate physical character or an altruistic behavior, a signaler honestly\nreveals a hidden quality to potential mates. Costly signaling theory, derived from the handicap\nprinciple, has provided powerful insight into enduring anthropological puzzles, such as\nunconditional provisioning by hunters in foraging societies (Gurven et al., 2000; Smith et al.,\nStatus signaling in peer-to-peer networks\nHutchinson, Todd, and Kruger, 2006). Although sexual selection models for handicap signaling\nfocus on signal transmission from male to female, CST anticipates signals between members of\nA conflict of interest between the signaler and the audience may arise, so mechanisms\nmust exist to reduce the chances that signalers cheat and to ensure that audience members pay\nattention. Signals can achieve evolutionary stability if (1) signalers differ in a quality that is\notherwise not readily observable; (2) both the audience and signaler can potentially benefit from\nthe transaction; (3) a link exists between the quality advertised and the cost of the signal; (4) a\nconflict of interest exists between signalers and the audience in that the signal can be \"faked\" by\nlow-quality signalers; and (5) the signal provides honest information about the quality advertised\ninsofar as high quality signalers pay lower signal costs or receive greater benefits (Bliege Bird\nFrom the CST perspective, meat sharing at public feasts creates a social arena in which\nhunters can competitively display their kill to a general audience, instead of specifically towards\npotential mates. Both the hunter and the audience benefit from the signal. The audience, by\nobserving differential hunting success, receives adaptive information about the value of each\nhunter as a reciprocator, ally, competitor or mate. Using this information, the audience members\ncan make educated decisions concerning how to interact with the signaler in the future (Hawkes\nand Bleige Bird, 2002). The successful hunter potentially receives benefits associated with\nincreased relative status, such as securing coalitional ties and high-quality mates. Finally, the\nsignal is quality-dependent, and thus honest. That is, low-quality hunters cannot systematically\nfake the signal because it is too costly and will not yield long term benefits. Therefore, only a\nskilled hunter can afford to incur the cost of sharing meat that would otherwise be consumed by\nhimself and his family.\nFile-sharing networks are also social venues in which altruists provide a resource to a\nlarge number of non-reciprocators. Asymmetrical sharing by uploaders is different from other\ntypes of generosity in that the cost of the signal does not result from giving up a resource that can\nbe individually consumed. Most of the digital data that is shared by uploaders was likely\ndownloaded for free or is a copy of an original file that is retained by the uploader. The handicap\nthat uploaders do endure is two-fold: file uploading is risky in that uploaders are more\nsusceptible to litigation, viruses, and hackers; and uploading is also costly because it requires\ntime, an expensive Internet connection speed and a high performance computer.\nRisk taking and unconditional generosity by uploaders may be explicable within a costly\nsignaling framework. First, uploaders differ in quality in terms of both willingness to take risks\nand in the quantity and variety of media that they provide, and these differences are highly\nobservable both online and offline. Second, there are potential benefits for both signalers and\nrecipients. Uploader username \"tags\" help downloaders recognize those file sharers who have\nthe qualities that they prefer (e.g., similar music interests, willingness to upload for extended\nperiods of time, and/or a fast connection speed), and peers who observe the display online or\noffline may obtain useful information about the signaler such as the their ability to incur costs,\nand/or their willingness to share. File uploaders may benefit by increasing social status among\noffline peers and/or by enhancing their reputations among the online audience via their username\ntags. Finally, the signal is honest because only high quality file sharers can systematically incur\nthe cost and risk of the signal. In other words, it won't pay for low-quality file sharers to fake the\nStatus signaling in peer-to-peer networks\nsignal over the long run. Drawing upon current evolutionary signaling theory, we tested the\nfollowing hypotheses:\n1. More males than females upload\nImportant differences in signaling behavior regarding level of participation and\nmotivation exist between the sexes, but these dimensions are virtually unexplored in the\nscientific literature. Indeed, Bliege Bird and Smith (2005) contend that extrapolating the sex-\ndifferences dynamic of signaling behavior is one of the \"most significant arenas\" for future\nstudies using CST. It is clear that many signaling games, such as those that are subsistence-\nbased, are sex-specific. Further, there appear to be sex-specific interests in those signaling\nvenues where both sexes participate. A study by Farthing (2005), which assessed attitudinal\ndifferences between the sexes regarding risk-taking behavior, suggested that males are more\nlikely to attend to a risky signal. Of the three non-heroic risk types--physical risk taking, risky\ndrug use, and financial risk taking--incorporated in Farthing's study, females did not prefer any\nrisk type as a quality in potential mates or friends. Males also did not prefer risk taking in\npotential mates; however, males did prefer physical and financial risk-takers as friends to risk-\navoiders. Hawkes and Bliege Bird (2002) have pointed out that a signal is not worth performing\nif there is no audience. Farthing's results suggest that females are not motivated to participate in\nsignaling games that involve risk because two important audiences--female friends and potential\nmale mates--will not attend to the signal. On the other hand, risk-taking males have a signal-\nreceiving audience \u00ad other males. Sex differences in attentiveness to risk-taking behavior is also\nsupported by a wealth of data indicating that young males are more prone to take avoidable risks,\nparticularly in the presence of other males (Wilson and Daly, 1985; Byrne, Miller, and Schafer,\nor extreme sports, uploading involves potential risks that are well known among peers.\nFurthermore, because most file sharers are between the ages of 18-29, P2P file-sharing networks\nare an ideal arena for competitive signaling among young, risk-taking males (Rainie and\nMadden, 2004). We predict that (a) P2P activity will be gendered with significantly more males\nuploading than females, while (b) downloading, which is much less risky than uploading, will be\ncomparatively less gendered.\n2. Uploaders are signaling to offline peers and online file sharers\nIn P2P file-sharing networks, there are two possible audiences to whom uploaders are\ndirecting their signal: offline peers and online file sharers. It is highly plausible that uploaders are\ncompeting for status among same-sex offline peers (i.e. friends from college). It is also possible\nthat uploaders are attempting to increase their online prestige by way of an observable tag such\nas a username. We anticipate that uploaders will be concerned with (a) offline recognition as\nuploaders among friends and (b) online reputation as uploaders among other file sharers.\n3. File sharers are self-interested vs. group oriented\nFile-sharing networks cannot function without individuals who upload, suggesting a\ngroup selection scenario, and we test for the presence of group motivated altruism. Henrich and\ncolleagues have argued that prosocial cooperation can evolve in very large groups in which\nStatus signaling in peer-to-peer networks\n\"institutional\" norms are maintained by the anonymous punishment of individual rule violators\n(Henrich et al. 2006). However, \"open\" P2P file-sharing systems--the focus of this study--are\nanarchic with few rules, and participants expect cheating to occur. Further, there are few\n\"institutional\" mechanisms for imposing costs on individual file sharers who do not reciprocate\n(exceptions are \"closed\" administered systems like Bit Torrent that will be discussed below).\nAlthough cooperative, P2P file-sharing networks are also highly unstable because non-\nreciprocators greatly outnumber reciprocators. Given the opportunities for anonymous self-\ninterested acquisition of media in P2P networks, we anticipate decision making that optimizes\nselfish returns (Maynard Smith, 1989; Trivers, 1971), and predict that both uploaders and\ndownloaders are acting in their own interests, rather than for the good of the file-sharing\ncommunity.\nMaterials and Methods\nThis is the first study to apply evolutionary concepts to the dynamic of Internet file\nsharing, and the primary goal is an initial descriptive analysis of file sharing by university\nundergraduates based on attitudinal and factual questionnaire data. Institutional review board\nresearch approval was obtained from California State University, Sacramento (CSUS) and\nSacramento City College (SCC). Focus group discussions were used to obtain information on\nfile-sharing behavior and to identify pertinent research questions and item statements. Four\nseparate focus group sessions were conducted, each containing three to five subjects. A\nquestionnaire was developed and implemented in a pilot study of 52 SCC students (56% male\nand 44% female) to test focus group-derived items/item clusters and questionnaire structure for\nthe principal research phase.\nConsistent with the descriptive objectives of the study, the assessment instrument is not\nconstructed as a unidimensional scale of \"file sharing,\" rather a series of subscales, or item\nclusters, designed to explore discrete file-sharing dimensions assayed during the pilot interviews.\nThe final questionnaire comprised 36 items in three sections related to file-sharing behavior: one\nsection (18 items) was completed by all file sharers (both uploaders and downloaders) (Table 4),\na second section (10 items) was completed only by uploaders (Table 5), and a final section (8\nitems) was completed by non-file sharers. For the first section of the questionnaire, file sharers\nresponded to clusters of items assessing the costs of uploading, selfish motivation when file\nsharing, recognition of uploaders while online, appreciation of uploaders, differential uploader\nquality, and the altruistic \"message\" of uploading (Table 4). Two major risk categories, risk of\nexposure to viruses/hackers and risk of prosecution, were included among other general\nstatements about the costs of uploading. Selfishness in file sharing was assessed using direct\nstatements about the benefits of file sharing, including saving money and time spent shopping for\nmovies and music. To evaluate online recognition of uploaders by other file sharers, the\nquestionnaire included statements about whether file sharers looked for specific usernames when\ndownloading or used instant messaging to chat with uploaders. Focus group discussions revealed\ntwo qualities that file sharers looked for when downloading: uploaders who leave their\ncomputers on for an extended period (overnight or while at school or work) and uploaders with a\nfast connection speed. These two traits were used to measure \"signal quality\" among uploaders.\nThe second section, completed by uploaders only, contained groups of items that\nsurveyed attitudes about group motivation, concern with online reputation, and concern with\nrecognition as an uploader among offline friends (Table 5). Group motivation was measured\nStatus signaling in peer-to-peer networks\nusing items that examined an uploader's willingness to contribute to the file-sharing community\ndespite the costs at the individual level. Concern with online reputation was assessed by\nincluding a statement about reputation building via usernames. Offline recognition was\ndetermined using items that examined peer identification of file sharers as uploaders. Non-file\nsharers responded to items that assessed concern with the costs of file sharing, perception of file\nsharers, and associations with file sharers. The questionnaire employed a five-point Likert scale:\n(1) strongly agree, (2) agree, (3) undecided, (4) disagree, and (5) strongly disagree. The\nquestionnaire also assayed demographic information: age, gender, and relationship status, and\nadditional factors such as self-rated computer competence, undergraduate focus of study, and\npreferred file-sharing digital medium (music files, music videos, popular movies or\npornography).\nDescriptive statistics of item cluster distributions were generated using 95th-percentile\nconfidence intervals. Relationships between ranked dependent variables and fixed factors were\nanalyzed using Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance, with Bonferroni adjustment for\nmultiple measurements. The Bonferroni adjustment is used to avoid false positives (type 1 error),\nbut is a conservative method that also increases the risk of false negatives (type 2 error). With\nthis in mind, uncorrected as well as corrected p values are shown to mitigate the risk of type 2\nerror in the presentation of results. The underlying structure of the assessment variables was\nexplored using principal components analysis. Two-way demographic comparisons were\nassessed with the chi-square test. The predictive relationships between uploader/downloader\nstatus, computer skill, and gender were tested using logistic regression. All tests are two-tailed at\nthe 0.05 level of significance. Statistical analyses were carried out in SPSS 13.\nResults\nParticipants\nStudy participants were recruited from General Education courses in anthropology and\nbiology at CSUS. The study population (N=331) was composed of 55% females (n=183) and\ndating, and 6% (n=21) of the subjects were married. Thirteen subjects returned incomplete\nquestionnaires and were excluded. The average subject age was 20.8 (SD=3.61) years. File\nmajority of the subjects were undecided (27%) about their focus of study in college, while 18%\nmajored in the social sciences, 18% in business, 14% in health and human services, 9% in arts\nand letters, 6% in engineering and computer science, 4% in the natural sciences, and 4% in\neducation. Digital music files were the primary shared medium of 94% of file sharers; and there\nwere no sex differences among uploaders (x2=1.74, df=2, p=0.420) or among downloaders in this\nFactorial structure of assessment variables\nPrincipal components analyses (PCA) were conducted to explore the underlying structure\nof the questionnaire items. Variables comprising the questionnaire answered by both\ndownloaders and uploaders (see Table 4) were included in a PCA. Varimax rotation produced\nStatus signaling in peer-to-peer networks\neight components with eigenvalues >1 which accounted for 64.8% of the total variance. The\ncomponents comprising the majority of variance were representative of the main four-item\nquestionnaire clusters, but the rotated structure was complex with multiple loadings across\ncomponents by items from the two-item clusters. These results indicate that moving from\ndescriptive to predictive analyses in subsequent research would require expansion of the two-\nitem clusters to four-item constructs.\nTo obtain a clearer picture of the relationships among the main assessment variables, a\nsecond analysis was conducted including only the four-item subscales. Five components with\neigenvalues >1 were retained, accounting for 61.8% of the total variance in this model (Table 1).\nThe rotated components closely paralleled the questionnaire item clusters (see Table 4): the first\ncomponent \"online recognition of uploaders\" accounted for 15.5% of the rotated variance. The\nsecond and third items accounted for 13.3 and 12.2% of the variance, respectively, and split the\n\"selfish motivation\" items into separate components, suggesting that these items can be usefully\nmodified in subsequent analyses. The fourth component comprised most of the \"concern with\ncosts\" items and accounted for 11.9% of the variance.\nTable 1. Factor loadings of items answered by uploaders and downloaders N=233 (see Table 4)\nVarimax Rotated Component Loadings\nLoadings < .3 are not shown\nThe underlying structure of items answered exclusively by file uploaders (see Table 5)\nwas also assessed using PCA. Varimax rotation of the three uploader item clusters yielded a\nfour-factor model accounting for 69.1% of the total variance (Table 2). The rotated components\nwere congruent with the uploader questionnaire sub-scales (see Table 5): the first component\n\"offline recognition\" accounted for 20.9% of the variance; the second component \"online\nreputation\" accounted for 17.3% of the variance, and component three composed mainly of\n\"group good\" items comprised 17.2% of the rotated variance. The number of uploaders is small\nfor a PCA, but the analysis is validated by the high factor loadings for the majority of rotated\nitems (>0.6: Mertler and Vannatta 2005). Beyond the descriptive objectives of the current study,\nStatus signaling in peer-to-peer networks\nthe orthogonal structure of the questionnaire sub-scale items shows potential for further\ndevelopment and refinement in subsequent research.\nTable 2. Factor loadings of items answered by uploaders only N=64 (see Table 4)\nVarimax Rotated Component Loadings\nLoadings < .3 are not shown\nComputer skill\nSubjects self-rated their computer competence by means of a five-point scale in order to\nassess correlations between computer competence and fixed factors, such as gender and P2P file-\nsharing activity. Only 5% of the study population reported novice computer competence (x < 3),\n48% reported average skill (x = 3), and 47% rated expert computer competence (x > 3). The\nmean self-rated computer competence was 3.50 for all subjects. Males rated their computer\ncompetence significantly higher than females among all subjects (Kruskal-Wallis H test=30.2,\nand non-file sharers (H=10.9, df=1, p=0.001); however, among uploaders there were no\ndifferences in self-rated computer competence between the sexes (H=0.56, df=1, p=0.46).\nThere were no within-sex differences between male uploaders and male downloaders in\nself-rated computer competence (H=0.87, df=1, p=0.351); in the same regard, there were no\ndifferences between female uploaders and female downloaders (H=2.46, df=1, p=0.116).\nGender differences in file sharing\nAs anticipated, there were significant gender differences in P2P file-sharing activity\n1(b), that downloading would not be gendered, was also supported (45% male and 55% female,\nx2=.009, df=1, p=0.92). Although not included as a study prediction, there were significantly\nStatus signaling in peer-to-peer networks\nFigure 1. Gender differences in P2P file-sharing activity (N=331)\nA possible confounding factor in our results is that males are more likely to upload as a\nfunction of gender differences in computer competence. The relationships between file-sharing\nactivity, gender and computer skill were further tested using binomial logistic regression, with\nfile-sharing activity as the dependent variable, and gender and computer competence as\nindependent covariates. With non-file sharers excluded from the model, male gender\nsignificantly predicts file uploading, whereas computer skill had no significant effect on the\nmodel (Table 3). These results confirm that gender is predictive of file uploading, and that file\nuploaders as a group are not uniquely computer competent. Therefore, we conclude that the\nobserved sex-differences in P2P activity are not the result of a gender divergence in computer\ncompetence.\nStatus signaling in peer-to-peer networks\nTable 3.

While males were more cognizant about the risk of\nprosecution from uploading (H=6.45, df=1, p=0.01), females were more aware of possible\nexposure to viruses and hackers (H=3.75, df=1, p=0.05). Females were significantly more likely\nthan males to contend that uploading is riskier than downloading (H=4.95, df=1, p=0.03).\nTable 5 reports means for items answered specifically by uploaders and reveals\ndifferences in attitude between male and female uploaders. Items related to concern with offline\nrecognition (Table 5, C8 and C9) show marked differences between the sexes. Males were\nsignificantly more likely to upload in the presence of friends and were more likely to be\nrecognized as uploaders among friends. Regarding concern with group good, males--unlike\nfemales--felt strongly that the file-sharing system would collapse if not for their participation as\nuploaders (Table 5, Item A1).\nStatus signaling in peer-to-peer networks\nTable 4.

The results support this hypothesis, and it appears\nthat uploaders, particularly males (Table 5, Items C7, C8, C9), are engaging in signaling offline\nThe final prediction was that file sharers were motivated by selfish rather than group\ninterests. All file sharers (item cluster mean 3.61, SD=0.68), including both uploaders (item\nselfishness as a primary reason for file sharing, and the differences between them were not\nsignificant in this regard (H=1.57, df=1, p=0.211). Because uploaders can receive the same\nbenefits (free digital data) as downloaders without incurring the risks, we also must consider\nwhether uploaders were behaving in this manner for the good of the file-sharing community.\nWhereas uploaders acknowledged selfish motivation as the primary reason for file sharing, they\nalso claimed that they were uploading for the good of the file-sharing community, albeit to a\nsignificantly reduced degree (Figure 3). Our results indicate, therefore, that both downloaders\nand uploaders are primarily self-interested, but that they also acknowledge greater than expected\ngroup-directed motivation.\nStatus signaling in peer-to-peer networks\nFigure 3.

Cultural restrictions on inter-sex participation can explain many examples\nof sex-biased signaling (Bliege Bird and Smith, 2005), but in many signaling venues, such as\nP2P file sharing, males and females have equal opportunities to participate. Of the file sharers in\nthis study, there were negligible differences between the sexes concerning participation (53%\nmale, 47% females). In fact, more females (55%) than males (45%) exclusively downloaded\nfiles. It is not that females are excluded from or voluntarily do not engage in the file-sharing\nculture, it is that they choose to participate in the less risky, more immediately profitable\nbehavior \u00ad downloading.\nRisk taking has always been closely linked to males, but the mechanisms that favor such\nbehavior have yet to be fully explicated within a costly-signaling framework (Wilke, Hutchinson,\nTodd, and Kruger, 2006). Our findings indicate that the level of risk a signal incurs can be a\npowerful predictor when extrapolating sex differences in costly signaling behavior. Compared\nwith males, female file sharers felt that uploading was \"riskier\" than downloading (Table 4, Item\nStatus signaling in peer-to-peer networks\nA3). Interestingly, male and female perceptions of the risks associated with uploading differed\nsignificantly. Females were more concerned about exposure to viruses and hackers, whereas\nmales were more concerned with the potential of prosecution (Table 4, Items 1 and 2), implying\nthat females and males interpret the costs and thus the information derived from the signal\ndifferently.\nExposure to hackers and viruses are real threats to file sharers, but the greatest risk is\nrecording industry litigation, which can cost an uploader many thousands of dollars. A recent\nsurvey conducted by Pew Internet and American Life, a non-profit organization, reports that the\npercentage of file sharers was reduced by one-half after the RIAA pursued lawsuits against\nuploaders in 2003 (Rainie and Madden, 2004). Females stopped file sharing more than any other\ndemographic group with a 58% decline in the number of users (Rainie and Madden, 2004). In\nour study, males were more cognizant of the risk of prosecution than females, yet males were\nsignificantly more likely than females to engage in risky uploading behavior \u00ad an outcome\nconsistent with a CST dynamic in which risky file-uploading behavior by males constitutes the\ncostly signal.\nThe efficacy of a signal is dependent upon the attentiveness of the audience, so in order\nfor an offline signal to be effective, those who upload files must be recognized as uploaders\namong peers. Female uploaders were not identified as such among friends from college, did not\ntalk about uploading with offline peers, and were much less likely to upload in the presence of\npeers when compared with males (Table 5, Item C9, C7, C8). Since few females upload, and it is\nseldom discussed among those who do, there are few, if any, potential benefits for a female\nsignaler. Males, on the other hand, were more likely than females to upload, to talk about\nuploading, to upload in the presence of peers, and to be identified as uploaders among friends\n(Table 5, Items 7-9). The results also indicated that differences in signal quality are recognized\nmore by males (Table 4, Items E15-E16). Sex differences in P2P participation and motivation\nstrongly suggest that risky uploading behavior is an intrasex signal between males.\nFile sharing is a selfish endeavor\nWe considered two possible evolutionary explanations for uploading behavior: that\ngroup-beneficial uploading by file sharers is a self-interested costly-signaling dynamic, and a\ngroup-selection scenario in which uploaders are sharing for the good of the file-sharing\ncommunity, despite the individual costs. Our hypothesis that uploaders would endorse self\ninterest over group motivation was supported, but uploaders also tended to agree with items\ndescribing group-directed motivation (Figure 3). This is an interesting result and suggests that\nfurther research is required to parse these apparently conflicting responses from file sharers.\nHowever, there are several factors which anticipate the finding that self-interest is the primary\nmotivation in P2P file sharing.\nFirst, as discussed above, \"open\" P2P networks are anarchic: accessible to anyone who\nwants to participate, based on an expectation that participants will not necessarily reciprocate,\nand without administration or rules. This is in stark contrast to contemporary group selection\nmodels predicting that cooperation can be maintained in groups if institutional mechanisms exist\nfor reducing within-group phenotypic variation and to limit within-group competition (Gintis,\nBowles, Boyd and Fehr, 2003). Further, P2P file-sharing networks employ tools that create a\ncompetitive social environment by displaying phenotypic differences in uploader quality, an\nissue we explore below.\nStatus signaling in peer-to-peer networks\nSecond, non-reciprocators (or \"leechers\" in the P2P lingo) greatly outnumber\nreciprocators. In our study, only 27% of file sharers uploaded, which--from a group selectionist\nperspective--makes P2P file-sharing networks highly unstable cooperative systems. Boyd and\ncolleagues (2003) have demonstrated that group-benefiting behavior that is individually costly\ncan emerge if non-cooperators are punished. Interestingly, the level of leaching in open P2P\nnetworks has led many file sharers to choose to participate in \"closed\" networks like Bit Torrent.\nSuch networks are the opposite of the more common \"anarchic\" systems: participants are\nregistered members of the network, uploading is required and file sharing is regulated by system\nadministrators. Therefore, Torrent networks have rules that reduce cheating, effectively exclude\nleechers and punish those that do not contribute enough files. Torrent systems are cooperative\nnetworks that may be explicable from the cultural group selection perspective, and we strongly\nrecommend subsequent research of file sharing in these networks to test contemporary theories\nof costly punishment of non-cooperative norm violators (Boyd et al. 2003; Gintis et al. 2003;\nSignaling strategies: generosity\nOur study results indicate that uploaders are concerned with recognition among their\nfriends offline rather than online. We investigated two possible offline signaling strategies\nincorporated by uploaders. First, uploaders are signaling a willingness to share; and second, that\nuploaders are engaging in competitive status signaling in a risky social environment.\nAs a highly social species, humans often make important decisions about how to interact\nwith one another based on imperfect and sometimes misleading information. Signaling provides\nan honest arena for individuals to communicate about aspects of human social life, for instance,\nwith whom to develop a long term, mutually beneficial, reciprocal relationship. By reliably\nsignaling a willingness to share, reciprocators can assort in a manner that excludes non-\nreciprocators. Furthermore, signaling a willingness and capacity to share can reassure current\nsharing relationships and increase the likelihood of reciprocation in times of need (Roberts,\nWe investigated the possibility that uploaders are signaling a willingness to share.\nAlthough uploaders were more likely than downloaders to recognize uploading as a signal of\ngenerosity, the degree of endorsement among uploaders was not significant (Table 4, Items F17,\nF18). We also considered that male uploaders were signaling a willingness to share to potential\nmates. Females did care more about who they were downloading from than did males (Table 4,\nItem D11), but female uploaders and downloaders did not appear to recognize the altruistic\nmessage associated with uploading (Table 4, Items F17, F18). Consequently, the data suggest\nthat uploading is not an intersex signal from males to females designed to broadcast a propensity\nfor generous behavior. Male uploaders, however, were more likely than females to recognize the\naltruistic message of uploading, and the possibility of intrasex generosity signaling may\nconstitute a useful direction for further research.\nSignaling strategies: Status competition\nVeblen (1899) explained how conspicuously consuming material items can be a form of\nsocial competition that reliably signals economic status. Conspicuous consumption is a signal\nstrategy involving uneconomical behavior that is observable among peers, including leisurely\nStatus signaling in peer-to-peer networks\nspending and disinterest in financial profits. Veblen posited that this type of behavior honestly\nadvertises economic status in social environments where status information is unreliable. This\nsame logic has been applied by Mauss (1924) and is mentioned more recently by Zahavi and\nZahavi (1997) when considering examples of conspicuous generosity such as public donations.\nAccording to the latter, charity donors are concerned with how they are perceived by peers,\ncompetitors, and potential mates, rather than with increasing reputations among charity\nrecipients (Zahavi and Zahavi, 1997). Our results indicate that uploaders, like donors at charity\nevents, are using their file-sharing activities to impress and compete with their \"flesh and blood\"\nsocial peers offline, and are relatively unconcerned about how they are perceived by those online\nfile downloaders that receive their gift.\nIn order for a signaling game to be competitive, there must be variations in the cost\nand/or risk of the signal that logically relate to differential quality among signalers. Based on\nclues from the study data, and the accounts of informants obtained during the pilot interviews, it\nappears that all uploaders are not equal. In addition to a general willingness to risk litigation,\nthere are other variable qualities that relate to the cost and the risk of uploading: (1) the degree of\nfinancial investment in technology used in file sharing (a high performance computer and fast\ninternet connection), and (2) the degree of computer competence that a file sharer may use to\nmitigate online exposure to risk. These observable differences in quality can be competitively\ndisplayed in a manner that signals status among offline peers while file sharing.\nAll file-sharing programs allow downloaders who are searching for digital media to\nchoose among available uploaders by connection speed (T3 or higher, T1, cable/DSL, or 65K\nmodem). It has become such an important quality in uploaders that many file-sharing programs\nallow downloaders to filter-out low quality uploaders when searching for digital data. Moreover,\nsome P2P file-sharing networks have icons that display an uploader's connection speed on his or\nher computer screen, and this signal of quality is highly observable when an uploader is file\nsharing in the presence of friends. The prestige element of connection speed is further evident in\nthe uploader vernacular. When uploaders converse they will commonly ask, \"What is your pipe\nsize?\" referring to one's connection speed. The size of one's \"pipe\" is positively correlated with\nthe amount of data that can be transferred between file sharers. For example, the authors\ndownloaded a 6-minute song from an uploader with a T4 connection speed (high-speed network)\nin one-tenth of the time it took to download the same song from an uploader with a 64K (dial-up)\nconnection speed. Enhancing signal quality using technology is financially expensive--in the\nvernacular of file sharing, a high quality or \"choice\" uploader must be equipped with a computer\nwith a fast processor, a \"fat\" hard drive that is capable of holding large quantities of\ndownloadable data, and a \"big pipe\" for quickly transferring digital data.\nIn addition to greater financial investment, some uploaders also take comparatively\ngreater risks. Differences in the level of risk incurred may logically relate to differences in\ncomputer competence among uploaders. Some uploaders leave their computers on all day and\nover night in order to allow long downloads from their computers, whereas others only upload\nwhile downloading files. The former increases the amount of time an uploader is vulnerable to\nhackers and viruses, while also increasing the chances an uploader is caught for infringing\ncopyright laws. The aforementioned study conducted by Pew Internet and American Life,\nillustrates how \"time spent uploading\" increases risk. Among those surveyed that continued to\nfile share after the 2003 wave of subpoenas, 20% claimed to spend considerably less time file\nimportant signal of quality--time spent uploading--is recognized significantly more by\nStatus signaling in peer-to-peer networks\nuploaders than downloaders, and to a greater degree by males when compared to females (Table\nAs discussed, many risky signals such as reckless driving are more likely to be performed\nby males (Nell, 2002). Turning to pop culture for an example, Richard Linklater's 1993 film\nentitled Dazed and Confused is rich with examples of competitive status signaling, ritual, and\ninitiation among young adults. In one scene, a young man named Wooderson stands over his\n1970 Chevrolet Chevelle SS, named \"Melba Toast.\" Wooderson, with the hood \"popped,\"\nconfidently describes various qualities of his car to a male peer: \"I'll tell you what Melba Toast\nis packing here. I've got a 411 positrac out back, 750 double pumper, Edelbrock intake, bored\nover 30, 11 to 1 pop-up pistons, turbo-jet, 390 horsepower. We're talking some [expletive]\nmuscle.\" Later on, the reliability of this verbal display was demonstrated on the highway as\nWooderson recklessly races a peer with both cars packed with teenage males. It was not difficult\nto recognize a parallel in behavior between the pop-icon car enthusiast and the uploader who\nmuttered to another uploader as they sat down and \"popped\" open their laptops prior to a focus\ngroup discussion: \"What do you have there... an Apple G4 Powerbook with a 450MHz G3\nprocessor? My XPS M170 runs an Intel Pentium 2.26 GHz processor with 2 gigs of dual channel\nSDRAM. I've got 6 USB connectors and an 80GB, high speed, 7200 RPM hard drive.\" It\nappears that P2P file-sharing networks, like the highways where young men race their cars,\nprovide a risky environment for uploaders to show-off their \"skills\" and \"machinery.\"\nIn closing, Internet uploading behavior meets the criteria for a costly signal. File\nuploading is an avoidable and risky behavior that is highly observable among peers, and displays\nvariation between uploaders in the costs/risks incurred that logically relate to differences in\nsignaler quality. Both parties potentially benefit from the signal transaction: signalers can\ncompete for enhanced peer-group status, and the audience (which is likely composed of other\nuploaders) gains important information about the differences in quality between members of\ntheir peer group.\nFuture research\nPeer-to-peer file sharing constitutes an observable natural experiment in human\nreciprocity and is highly amenable to subsequent research. Future goals include development of\nmethods to parse factors affecting the quality of the communicated signal, such as technology\ninvestment and computer competence, and to further understand the motivations for off-line\ncompetition among male uploaders. Second, in contrast to males, the nature and target of the\nsignal being sent by female uploaders is unclear. As a group, female uploaders were not\nconcerned with either their reputation online or recognition while offline, and were ambivalent\nabout uploading for the good of the file-sharing community. Further research is required to\nclarify the motivations for risky uploading among female file sharers. Third, research of \"closed\"\nadministered file-sharing systems such as Bit Torrent is recommended to test contemporary\ngroup selection theory of costly punishment of norm violators in cooperative groups.\n"
