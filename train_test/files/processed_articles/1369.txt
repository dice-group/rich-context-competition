    "reduced_content": "Racial Differences in the Relationship Between\nHepatitis C Infection and Iron Stores\nGeorge N. Ioannou,1,2 Jason A. Dominitz,1,2 Noel S. Weiss,3 Patrick J. Heagerty,4 and Kris V. Kowdley1\nBlack race and increased hepatic iron stores predict poor response to interferon treatment for\nchronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. We tested the hypothesis that these 2 observations\nare linked by investigating whether HCV-infected African-Americans have increased iron\nstores relative to uninfected persons. Using data from the third National Health and Nutri-\ntion Examination Survey (NHANES III), we determined the risk of having increased iron\nstores, defined as elevation of both serum ferritin and transferrin-iron saturation (TS), in\nHCV-RNA\u00adpositive blacks (n  100) and nonblacks (n  126) relative to HCV-RNA\u00ad\ntimes (95% CI, 1.2 to 24) more likely to have increased iron stores than HCV-positive\nnonblacks. The proportion of HCV-positive blacks who had increased iron stores was 16.4%\namong those with abnormal liver enzymes and 2.8% among those with normal liver en-\nzymes, compared with only 0.6% among HCV-negative blacks. After adjustment for age,\nalcohol intake, gender, menopausal status, education, body mass index, and poverty index,\nHCV-positive blacks with abnormal liver enzymes had an elevated risk of having increased\niron stores (odds ratio, 17.8; 95% CI, 5.1 to 63). In contrast, among persons of other races,\nthere was a much smaller difference in the proportion of persons with increased iron stores\nbetween HCV-positive persons with (3.4%) or without (1.4%) abnormal liver enzymes and\nHCV-negative persons (0.9%). In conclusion, a greater proportion of blacks than persons of\nother races respond to HCV infection with an increase in iron stores. This finding may partly\nexplain the reduced response of HCV-positive African-Americans to antiviral treatment.\nRelative to whites, black patients with hepatitis C\nvirus (HCV) infection are more resistant to an-\ntiviral treatment with interferon, pegylated in-\nterferon, or combination of interferon and ribavirin.1-6\nInterracial differences in viral loads and the prevalence\nof HCV genotype 1 infection only partly account for\nthe observed differences in response to antiviral treat-\nments.\nPrevious studies have suggested that patients with\nchronic HCV commonly have elevated levels of serum\nmarkers of iron stores (ferritin, transferrin-iron saturation\n[TS], or iron).7-13 The presence of elevated body iron\nstores and, in particular, elevated hepatic iron levels, is one\nof the strongest predictors of resistance to interferon treat-\nWe used data from the third National Health and Nutri-\ntion Examination Survey (NHANES III) to determine\nwhether there are differences between HCV-infected blacks\nand HCV-infected nonblacks with respect to the likelihood\nof increased iron stores. We hypothesized that among per-\nsonswithHCVinfection,agreaterpercentageofblacks than\nnonblacks would have elevated iron stores, because such a\nfinding would be in agreement with the observed lower re-\nsponse of blacks to antiviral treatment. Also, we asked\nwhether any difference in iron stores between HCV-infected\nblacks and other races might be attributed to a response to\nthe HCV infection itself, rather than an underlying excess of\niron stores in blacks without HCV infection.\nAbbreviations: HCV, hepatitis C virus; TS, transferrin-iron saturation;\nNHANES, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.\nFrom the 1Department of Medicine and Division of Gastroenterology, University\nof Washington; 2Health Services Research and Development, Northwest Hepatitis C\nResource Center, Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System; 3Department of\nEpidemiology, University of Washington; and 4Department of Biostatistics, Uni-\nversity of Washington, Seattle, WA.\nG.N.I. is a fellow at the Health Services Research and Development program of\nthe Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Health Care system.

NHANES\nIII was conducted by the National Center for Health\nnutritional status of the United States population.23 It\nof age from 89 randomly selected locations throughout\nthe United States. The NHANES sampling process is\ndesigned such that the participants constitute a represen-\ntative sample of the civilian, noninstitutionalized, United\nStates population. The survey collected data via house-\nhold interviews, standardized physical examinations, and\nlaboratory investigations.\nwe assumed that iron status is influenced by different\nfactors in the pediatric population compared with the\nadult population. We also excluded 3,373 persons who\nwere not tested for serum iron, TS, ferritin, albumin,\nbilirubin, platelet count, aspartate aminotransferase, ala-\nnine aminotransferase, or hepatitis C viral antibodies. Ad-\nditionally, we excluded 1,039 participants with missing\ndata regarding alcohol consumption, demographic char-\nacteristics, or menstrual history. We wanted to evaluate\nwhether hepatitis C infection is associated with increased\niron stores even in the absence of advanced cirrhosis, be-\ncause advanced cirrhosis secondary to any cause is associ-\nated with iron overload.24-26 No questions were asked in\nNHANES III regarding the presence of cirrhosis or\nchronic liver disease; therefore, we attempted to identify\nparticipants at risk of having advanced cirrhosis based on\nthe presence of either a serum albumin less than 3.5 g/dL,\nrum bilirubin greater than 2.0 mg/dL. We identified 928\nparticipants who fulfilled at least 1 of these criteria, in-\ncluding only 29 who were HCV-RNA positive. This\nnumber of HCV-RNA\u00adpositive participants with evi-\ndence of cirrhosis was too small to be analyzed separately;\ntherefore, all 928 participants with possible evidence of\ncirrhosis were excluded, leaving 15,171 participants in\nthis analysis.\nMeasurement of Serum Markers of Iron Stores.\nDetails of the assay methods used in NHANES III for the\nevaluation of serum ferritin, iron, and TS have been de-\nscribed elsewhere,29,30 and will only be summarized here.\nSerum iron and total iron binding capacity were measured\ncolorimetrically (Alpkem RFA analyzer; Clackamas, OR),\nand 1% thiourea was added to complex copper and pre-\nvent copper interference.30 Iron saturation was calculated\nas the ratio of serum iron to total iron binding capacity.\nSerum ferritin was measured with the BioRad Quantim-\nmune IRMA kit (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA).\nParticipants who were scheduled for phlebotomy between\nfast for 10 to 16 hours, and participants who were sched-\nuled for phlebotomy after noon were instructed to fast for\nAssessment of HCV Status. A second-generation en-\nzyme immunoassay and a supplemental test (EIA 2.0 and\nHCV MATRIX, Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago,\nIL) were used to test for anti-HCV antibodies. Samples\nfound to be anti-HCV positive were subsequently tested\nfor HCV-RNA by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain\nreaction.31,32 Samples found to be negative by reverse\ntranscriptase polymerase chain reaction were extracted a\nsecond time by the same procedure, with an additional\ntranscriptase (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN)\nand 10 U of ribonuclease inhibitor (Boehringer Mann-\nheim). For this study, only participants with positive\nHCV-RNA were considered to be chronically infected\nwith HCV. All subjects with negative anti-HCV antibody\ntests were assumed to be HCV-RNA negative.\nAssessment of Potential Confounding Variables.\nRace, gender, menopausal status, age, education, poverty\nindex, body mass index, and alcohol consumption may be\nassociated with both HCV infection32 and the levels of\nserum markers of iron stores.33,34 These variables, which\nwere obtained in NHANES III by subject interviews and\nexaminations, were, therefore, selected a priori for inclu-\nsion in regression models as potential confounders. Race\nwas categorized in 3 groups: non-Hispanic black, non-\nHispanic white, and other. There were too few Asians/\nPacific Islanders/American Indians (n  207, of whom\nonly 4 were HCV positive) to allow separate categoriza-\ntion. Age was modeled as a continuous variable. Educa-\ntional attainment was classified according to whether or\nnot a participant had graduated from high school. The\npoverty income ratio, a measure of poverty that is inde-\npendent of calendar year, was computed as the ratio of\nself-reported family income to the poverty threshold ac-\ncording to each calendar year.23 Participants with a pov-\nerty income ratio less than 1.0 were considered to be\nbelow the poverty level. Body mass index was computed\nas the ratio of the measured weight in kg to the square of\nthe measured height in meters and was modeled as a con-\ntinuous variable. Participants of NHANES III were asked\nthe average number of days during which alcohol was\nconsumed and the average number of drinks consumed\non each of those days during the past 12 months. We used\nthese data to calculate the average number of alcoholic\ndrinks per day during the preceding year.\nStatistical Analysis. The primary outcome of this\nstudy was the presence of increased iron stores, defined as\nelevation of both serum TS (45%) and serum ferritin\nis a more specific indicator of increased iron stores than\neither test alone.35,36 The aims of our analyses were, first,\nto investigate whether HCV-infected blacks were more\nlikely than HCV-infected nonblacks to have increased\niron stores. This was determined by limiting our analysis\nto HCV-infected persons and using a multivariate logistic\nregression model to compare blacks and nonblacks with\nrespect to the risk of having elevated iron stores, after\nadjusting for the potential confounders described above.\nThe second aim of our analyses was to investigate\nwhether there were differences between blacks and other\nracial groups in regard to the association between HCV\ninfection and increased iron stores. We determined this\nby using a multivariate logistic regression model that\ncompared HCV-negative to HCV-positive persons with\nrespect to the odds of having increased iron stores and\nincluded an interaction term between race and HCV sta-\ntus. The HCV-positive persons with and without abnor-\nmal levels of serum liver enzymes were analyzed separately\nbecause previous studies suggested that serum markers of\niron stores are higher among those with abnormal liver\nenzyme levels.13 Liver enzyme levels were considered ab-\nnormal if either serum aspartate or alanine aminotrans-\nferases were 40 U/L.\nLevels of serum ferritin and TS may be affected not\nonly by iron stores, but also by the presence of acute\ninflammation.37 To exclude the possibility that any ob-\nserved differences in levels of serum ferritin or TS were\nattributable to differences in the prevalence of inflamma-\ntory conditions, we performed additional analyses adjust-\ning for the level of C-reactive protein, an acute phase\nreactant believed to reflect inflammation levels. C-reac-\ntive protein levels were categorized as \"undetectable\" (de-\n0.4 mg/dL (corresponding to the seventy-fifth centile),\nTo increase the efficiency of the sampling process,\nNHANES III employed a complex, multistage sampling\ndesign whereby potential participants were identified\nfrom 89 locations in the United States. This induces a\ncorrelation structure among the observations, which can-\nnot be treated as a simple random sample. In addition,\nbecause NHANES III involved oversampling of certain\nage and racial groups, sample weights are provided to\nreflect this and also to attempt to adjust for nonresponse\nbias (because of people refusing to participate) and non-\ncoverage bias (because of people who do not live in house-\nholds and, therefore, could not participate). We used\nSTATA software version 7.0 (College Station, TX) in our\nanalyses to account for both the sampling and the weight-\ning processes.\nResults\nThe prevalence of HCV-RNA positivity in this study\npersons of other races (Table 1). Compared with other\nHCV-positive persons, HCV-positive blacks were\nyounger and leaner but otherwise were similar in regard to\ngender distribution, alcohol consumption, educational\nattainment, income level, and the prevalence of abnormal\nlevels of liver enzymes or undetectable levels of C-reactive\nprotein. Compared with black or nonblack HCV-nega-\ntive participants, those who were HCV positive were\nyounger, leaner, had lower educational attainment and\nincome, consumed more alcohol, and were more likely to\nbe male and to have abnormal liver enzyme levels and\nundetectable levels of C-reactive protein (Table 1).\nThe prevalence of elevations in serum ferritin, TS, or\nboth was higher in HCV-infected blacks than HCV-in-\nfected persons of other races (Table 2).

HCV-posi-\ntive blacks with normal liver enzyme levels also had eleva-\ntions in serum ferritin, TS, and iron, but the magnitude of\nthese elevations was approximately half of that observed\nin HCV-positive blacks with abnormal liver enzymes.\nThe proportion of HCV-positive blacks who had elevated\nserum ferritin and TS was 16.4% among those with ab-\nnormal liver enzyme levels and 2.8% among those with\nnormal liver enzyme levels compared with only 0.6%\namong HCV-negative blacks (Table 3 and Fig. 1). Com-\npared with HCV-negative blacks, the odds ratio of having\nelevations in both serum ferritin and TS was 17.8 (95%\nCI, 5.1 to 63) in blacks with abnormal liver enzyme levels\nwere normal after adjustment for age, alcohol intake, gen-\nder, menopausal status, education, body mass index, and\npoverty index.\nIn contrast, among nonblack participants, there was no\ndifference in mean serum TS and iron between HCV-\nnegative and HCV-positive participants (with or without\nabnormal liver enzymes). Mean serum ferritin level was\nHCV-positive participants with abnormal liver enzymes,\nbut not in those with normal liver enzymes, compared\nwith HCV-negative participants. Compared with the dif-\nferences that we observed in blacks, among nonblacks\nthere was a much smaller difference in the proportion of\npersons with increased iron stores between HCV-positive\npersons with (3.4%) or without (1.4%) abnormal liver\nenzymes and HCV-negative persons (0.9%) (Table 3 and\nFig. 1). Additionally adjusting for C-reactive protein lev-\nels had negligible effect on the results presented above\n(data not shown).\nDiscussion\nBlack patients with hepatitis C have lower likelihood of\nresponse to antiviral treatment than white patients even\nwhen differences in HCV genotype distribution and\nHCV viral loads between blacks and whites are taken into\nconsideration.1-6 We investigated whether there are dif-\nferences between HCV-infected blacks and whites in re-\ngard to the presence of elevated iron stores, which is a\npredictor of poor response to interferon treatment.14-21\nOur results suggest that the prevalence of increased\niron stores, as defined by elevations in both serum ferritin\nand TS, is higher in HCV-infected blacks (10.7%) than\nin HCV-infected whites (2.4%; adjusted odds ratio, 5.4;\nexplained by our observation that HCV infection is asso-\nciated with much greater increases in iron stores in blacks\ncompared with nonblacks.\nThe extent to which these differences in iron stores can\nexplain the previously described racial differences in re-\nsponse to antiviral treatment depends on the extent to\nwhich the association between elevated iron stores and\nimproved response to interferon treatment is believed to\nbe causative. Increased body or hepatic iron stores may be\nsurrogate markers for other factors associated with a low\nlikelihood of response, such as advanced fibrosis, HCV\ngenotype 1, high viral load, male gender, and long dura-\nTable 1.

On the other hand, the fact that\niron depletion by phlebotomy in patients with HCV re-\nduces serum aminotransferase levels38-43 and, in combina-\ntion with interferon, may have improved antiviral efficacy\ncreased iron stores may be the cause of the reduced re-\nsponse to interferon.\nAlthough the presence of increased iron stores is a rec-\nognized predictor of poor response to interferon mono-\ntherapy,15-22 the association between increased iron stores\nand response to combination treatment with interferon\nand ribavirin or pegylated interferon and ribavirin has not\nbeen investigated adequately. Only one such study is cur-\nrently available44 in which 40 patients were treated with\ninterferon and ribavirin, of whom 18 had sustained viro-\nlogic response. There was no difference in hepatic iron\nconcentration between responders and nonresponders;\nhowever, given the small number of subjects involved, it is\ndifficult to exclude a type 2 error. Of note, in this study,\nthe mean serum ferritin concentration was higher in non-\nalthough, again, this difference was not statistically signif-\nicant. Therefore, larger, prospective studies are required\nto evaluate whether iron stores are associated with re-\nsponse to combination treatment, and whether such an\nassociation is modified by race.\nOur finding that HCV-positive blacks were 5.4 times\nmore likely to have increased iron stores than HCV-pos-\nitive nonblacks may have implications beyond potentially\nexplaining racial differences in treatment response rates.\nHepatic iron increases the production of reactive oxygen\nspecies, which may lead to lipid peroxidation, steatosis,\ndepletion of glutathione stores, and accelerated liver dam-\nage.45,46 Furthermore, the presence of increased iron\nFig. 1.

Indeed, the incidence of hep-\natocellular carcinoma in the United States is 2 to 3 times\ngreater in blacks than in white persons.48 On the other\nhand, retrospective studies have suggested that the rate of\nhistologic progression in chronic HCV infection is either\nsimilar28 or lower49 in blacks than in whites. However,\nthese studies are subject to both selection bias and to great\ninaccuracies in the calculation of histological progression,\nwhich was based on duration of infection estimated from\nthe earliest potential exposure to the virus.\nWe observed that HCV infection was associated with\nmuch greater elevations in serum markers of iron stores in\npatients with abnormal liver enzymes compared with pa-\ntients with normal liver enzymes. One potential explana-\ntion for this finding is that elevated liver enzymes are a\nsign of ongoing hepatic necroinflammation, which may\nlead to elevations in serum markers of iron stores through\nrelease of iron-loaded ferritin from dying hepatocytes. Al-\nternatively, if hepatitis C infection has effects on gastro-\nintestinal iron absorption or iron metabolism, then these\neffects may be more pronounced in patients with active\ndisease as evidenced by elevated liver enzymes.\nOur study is limited by the fact that the hepatic iron\nconcentration, which is a better predictor of response to\ninterferon than serum markers of iron stores, was not\navailable because liver biopsies were not performed in this\npopulation-based study. Nonetheless, serum ferritin and\nTS levels have been shown to have good correlation to\nhepatic iron concentration levels.7,11,50 Future studies will\nbe required to determine if hepatic iron concentration\nalso is higher in blacks compared with whites with chronic\nHCV infection. Also, future studies should investigate\nwhether the lower response of blacks than persons of other\nraces to antiviral treatment is restricted to persons with\nevidence of elevated hepatic iron concentration or serum\nmarkers of iron stores.\nIt is unlikely that the absence of data on hemochroma-\ntosis gene (HFE) mutations has given rise to uncontrolled\nconfounding in our comparison between HCV-positive\nand HCV-negative persons, because the prevalence of\nHFE mutations is the same in HCV-positive and negative\npersons.7 It is also unlikely that the presence of sickle cell\ndisease accounts for the elevation in iron stores that we\nobserved in black patients with HCV infection: sickle\ncells were present in 4 out of 4,534 participants who had\nmicroscopic examination of a peripheral blood film, in-\ncluding 3 blacks, none of whom was HCV-RNA positive.\nFinally, it is unlikely that the differences in iron markers\nthat we observed between HCV-positive blacks and\nHCV-positive nonblacks, or between HCV-positive and\nHCV-negative persons are related to differences in the\npresence of acute inflammation, because adjustment for\nC-reactive protein levels did not affect these observations.\nIn summary, we observed that HCV-infected blacks\nare 5 times more likely to have elevated serum markers of\niron stores than HCV-infected nonblacks. This finding is,\nin turn, the result of a particularly strong association be-\ntween HCV infection and increased iron stores among\nblacks. Future studies should investigate whether these\nfindings can partly explain the relatively low response of\nblacks to antiviral treatment.\nReferences\n1. Howell C, Jeffers L, Hoofnagle JH.
