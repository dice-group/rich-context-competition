This study examines the risk for all-cause mortality in metabolically\nnormal and abnormal obese (MNOB and MAOB, respectively) individuals.\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- The sample included 6,011 men and women\nfrom the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) with public-access\nmortality data linkage (follow-up  8.7  0.2 years; 292 deaths). Metabolically abnormal was defined as\ninsulin resistance (IR) or two or more metabolic syndrome (MetSyn) criteria (excluding waist).\nRESULTS -- A total of 30% of obese subjects had IR, and 38.4% had two or more MetSyn factors,\nwhereas only 6.0% (or 1.6% of the whole population) were free from both IR and all MetSyn factors.\nBy MetSyn factors or IR alone, MNOB subjects (hazard ratio [HR]MetSyn\nsimilar elevations in mortality risk compared with metabolically normal, normal weight subjects.\nCONCLUSIONS -- Although a rare phenotype, obesity, even in the absence of overt meta-\nbolic aberrations, is associated with increased all-cause mortality risk.\nRecentinteresthasfocusedonaunique\nsubgroup of obese individuals who\nare \"metabolically normal\" (MNOB)\ndespite increased adiposity (1\u00ad4). The in-\nterpretation of some of these studies is that\nMNOB subjects are not at increased risk for\nmorbidity and mortality and that obesity\ntreatment is therefore unnecessary. This is\nin clear contrast with the current U.S. obe-\nsity treatment guidelines that suggest that\nobese individuals should be treated for their\nobesity, regardless of their cardiovascular\n(CVD) risk status (5).\nThe purpose of this study is to exam-\nine all-cause mortality risk in \"metaboli-\ncally normal obese\" and \"metabolically\nabnormal obese\" (MAOB) phenotypes.\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey(NHANESIII)PublicAccessMortal-\nity Linkage was used. Age, sex, income, eth-\nnicity, smoking status, exercise frequency,\ndietary fat (30%), alcohol intake, inten-\ntions to lose weight over the last year (yes/\nno), and self-reported body weight 10 years\nprior were assessed by questionnaire. BMI\n(30 kg/m2) were used.

Because of small cell sizes, mortal-\nity analyses were limited to metabolically\nnormal definitions 1 and 2.

We used a\nmore stringent definition with lower clin-\nical cutoffs and a HOMA cutoff of 2.5 that\nis associated with clamp-measured IR (7)\nas opposed to an arbitrary 90th percentile\ncutoff of 5.13. Despite our stricter defini-\ntion, the true prevalence of MNOB may in\nfact be lower than the 6.0% that we re-\nport, since individuals in negative energy\nbalance typically display metabolic pro-\nfiles that are better than expected for their\nlevel of obesity (8). Because over two-\nthirds of obese individuals are attempting\nto lose weight (9), some MNOB subjects\nmay be in negative energy balance. Nev-\nertheless, reported intentions to lose\nweight were not different between MNOB\nand MAOB subjects.\nThe name \"metabolically normal\" im-\nplies MNOB subjects are not at an ele-\nvated health risk. For example, Brochu et\nal. (1) identified a subgroup of MNOB\npostmenopausal women who were insu-\nlin sensitive and questioned the medical\nurgency to treat these women as they were\n\"metabolically normal.\" The notion that\nsome obese individuals may not require\nobesity treatment is in contrast to current\nU.S. obesity treatment algorithms (5) that\nrecommend overweight individuals with\ntwo or more CVD risk factors and all\nobese individuals regardless of their risk\nprofile should be treated. The algorithm de-\nfines CVD risk using nonmetabolic (age,\nsmoking, and personal/family CVD history)\nand metabolic (LDL, HDL, hypertension,\nand glucose) factors. Although important,\nmanyofthenonmetabolicCVDfactorscan-\nnot be altered. Thus, examination of modi-\nfiable metabolic factors may be more\nclinically relevant and useful.\nThat MAOB subjects were older and\nmore obese currently and 10 years prior\nmay imply that MNOB subjects have not\nhad sufficiently high levels of obesity, or\nadequate time for metabolic abnormali-\nties to develop as a consequence of their\nobesity (10). Alternatively, increased\nmortality risk could be mediated through\nboth metabolic and nonmetabolic conse-\nquences. Obese individuals are more\nlikely to die from traumatic incidences\n(11) and have cancer diagnosed at more\nadvanced stages than their normal weight\ncounterparts (12). Further, weight bias by\nsome health professionals results in\ngreater reluctance to provide health\ncare--a problem that is compounded by\nthe fact that obese individuals are more\nlikely to avoid seeking health care (13).\nRegardless of the reasons why MNOB and\nMAOB subjects are at similarly elevated\nmortality risk, these findings reinforce the\nimportance of obesity reduction in all\nobese individuals.\nIn summary, obesity in the absence of\nmetabolic abnormalities is a rare condi-\ntion. Further, obesity is associated with an\nincreased risk for all-cause mortality, re-\ngardless of whether the obese patients\npresent with insulin resistance or a clus-\ntering of metabolic risk factors. As such,\nweight management should continue to\nbe a target for reducing morbidity and\nmortality in all obese individuals.\n"
