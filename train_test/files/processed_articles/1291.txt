Impor-\ntantly, this interaction was found to predict not only greater incidence but also earlier incidence\nof adverse events in older adults.\nCONCLUSIONS -- Whether a marker for underlying disease severity, an indicator of di-\nminished self-care motivation, or the result of physiologic changes, the interaction of depression\nand diabetes has a synergistic effect on the health of older Mexican Americans, increasing the risk\nfor poor outcomes. This is of particular clinical importance because although depression is often\nunderrecognized in older adults, effective treatment is available and can result in improved\nmedical outcomes.\nDepression, long recognized as a con-\nsequence of physical illness (1), is\nincreasingly being perceived as a\npotential risk factor for compromised\nhealth, particularly among older adults\n(2). A number of recent studies have\nshown that depression predicts the onset\nof many medical conditions, including\nhypertension, heart disease, cancer,\nstroke, and angina, as well as type 2 dia-\nSeveral studies have also shown de-\npression as a predictor of mortality (8) as\nwell as the onset of disability (9). Indeed,\npression will be the second leading cause\nof disability worldwide (10). Depression\nhas also been shown to impact adherence\nto treatment regimens and the cost of\nhealth care among individuals with\nchronic disease (11), including diabetes\n(12). Despite this evidence, few studies\nhave examined the influence of depres-\nsion on the course of chronic disease, par-\nticularly in large samples of older adults\nliving in the community.\nIn earlier studies from the Hispanic\nEstablished Population for the Epidemio-\nlogic Study of the Elderly (EPESE) survey,\nwe demonstrated that depressive symp-\ntoms were associated with a number of\npoor health indicators among older dia-\nbetic Mexican Americans, including\nelevated rates of comorbid medical con-\nditions, greater functional disability, and\nincreased health care utilization (2,13).\nMoreover, death rates among individuals\nwith both diabetes and depression were\nfound to be three times higher than rates\namong diabetic individuals without de-\npression (2). Little is known, however, re-\ngarding the impact of depression on other\nadverse health outcomes in diabetes, such\nas increasing disease severity, disability,\nand comorbidity of disease.\nIn the present study, longitudinal\ndata from the Hispanic EPESE survey\nwere used to assess the separate and com-\nbined influences of depression and diabe-\ntes on the incidence of macrovascular and\nmicrovascular complications, functional\ndisability, and mortality among older\nMexican Americans. This is a particularly\nappropriate population in which to exam-\nine this relationship because older Mexi-\ncan Americans experience elevated rates\n                                                \nFrom the 1Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, University of Maryland Baltimore, Balti-\nmore, Maryland; and the 2Department of Preventive Medicine & Community Health, University of Texas\nMedical Branch, Galveston, Texas.\nAddress correspondence and reprint requests to Dr. Sandra A.

The baseline sample was designed\nMexican Americans aged 65 years re-\nsiding in the southwestern U.S. The initial\nbaseline wave of interviews was followed\nby three waves of follow-up: the first was\nthe third wave of follow-up was con-\nDepressive symptoms were assessed\nat baseline. Individuals who were too ill\nor cognitively impaired to complete face-\nto-face interviews at baseline were not in-\ncluded in the present analyses, which\nplete data for analyses predicting mortal-\nity. Analyses predicting incident diabetic\ncomplications or disability reflect only the\nreports of the 2,462 individuals who were\nnot deceased by the first follow-up. Clin-\nical diagnostic criteria for depression\nwere assessed at the first wave of fol-\nlow-up and yielded a total of 2,092 indi-\nviduals with complete data for analyses\npredicting mortality, incident complica-\ntions, and disability.\nAs can be seen in Table 1, older\nwomen comprised 59% of the sample.\nJust over two-thirds of the participants\ncompleted high school. Just over half of\nthe participants in the sample were cur-\nrently married; older men were much\nmore likely to have been married than\nMeasures\n  and diabetic complications.\nAt baseline and both follow-up inter-\nviews, the presence of diabetes was as-\nsessed by asking the respondents whether\nthey had ever been told by a physician\nthat they had diabetes. All individuals\nwho responded affirmatively were then\nasked whether they had type 1 or type 2\ndiabetes; all respondents indicated that\nthey had been diagnosed with type 2 dia-\nbetes. Individuals reporting impaired glu-\ncose tolerance were not designated as\nhaving diabetes in the present analyses.\nRespondents were also asked whether\nthey had experienced any kidney prob-\nlems (nephropathy), eye problems (reti-\nnopathy), circulation or nerve problems\n(neuropathy), or amputations as a result\nof having diabetes. Respondents were\nthen categorized as having any incident\nmicrovascular complications at each wave\nof follow-up if they reported any compli-\ncations that were not present at baseline.\nAt baseline and all three waves of fol-\nlow-up interviews, respondents were\nasked whether they had ever received a\nphysician's diagnosis of other medical\nconditions that are often sequelae of dia-\nbetes, including cardiovascular disease,\nstroke, and kidney disease. Respondents\nwere categorized as having incident mac-\nrovascular complications at each wave of\nfollow-up if they reported any conditions\nthat were not reported at baseline.\nFunctional disability. Disability in ac-\ntivities of daily living was measured with a\nmodified version of the Katz Activities of\nDaily Living scale (15), which included\nwalking across a small room, bathing,\ngrooming, dressing, eating, transferring\nfrom a bed to a chair, and using the toilet.\nRespondents were categorized as having\nincident disability at each wave of fol-\nlow-up if they reported any difficulties\nwith activities of daily living that were not\nreported at baseline.\nSociodemographic characteristics in-\ncluded the sex, age, years of education,\nlevel of acculturation, and marital status\nat baseline.

Depressive symptoms\nwere measured at baseline with the Cen-\nter for Epidemiologic Studies Depression\nScale (CESD) (16), the most commonly\nused survey measure of depressive symp-\ntomatology in studies of older adults.\nFound to be reliable and valid when used\nin elderly individuals, the scale consists of\n20 items that ask how often specific\nsymptoms were experienced during the\nweek preceding the interview, and re-\nsponses are scored on a four-point scale,\nwith potential total scores ranging from 0\nto 60. These scores were used to delineate\nthree categories of respondents: those\nwith minor depression (based on a CESD\nscore of 16), those with minimal de-\npression (CESD scores of 1\u00ad15, often re-\nferred to as subthreshold depressive\nsyndrome), and those without any de-\npressive symptoms (CESD score of 0).\nThe cutoff for minor depression, although\nnot indicative of a diagnosis of clinical de-\npression, has previously been shown to\neffectively identify individuals with clini-\ncally significant levels of depressive symp-\ntoms in other studies of older adults (17)\nas well as with this sample of older Mex-\nican Americans (2).\nDepressive diagnoses were assessed at\nthe second wave (first follow-up inter-\nview) with a modified version of the de-\npression module of the Composite\nInternational Diagnostic Interview (CIDI)\n(18), which matches the criteria for de-\npressive disorders as delineated in the Di-\nagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fourth\nEdition (DSM-IV) of the American Psy-\nchiatric Association (19). Developed by\nthe Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental\nHealth Administration and the World\nHealth Organization, the CIDI was de-\nsigned specifically for large-scale psychi-\natric epidemiologic research with\npopulations from diverse cultures and ed-\nucation levels. Earlier versions of these\ncriteria have been extensively used to\nyield valid and reliable diagnoses of de-\npressive disorders in survey research, in-\ncluding surveys of the elderly. The\nHispanic EPESE specifically used the de-\npression module from the Fresno CIDI\n(20), which was culturally and linguisti-\ncally adapted for Mexican Americans.\nIn the present study, depressive diag-\nnoses included reporting of any lifetime\nmajor depressive episode (requiring an\naffirmative response to five of nine de-\npressive symptoms experienced in a\n2-week period, at least one of which was\ndepressed mood or anhedonia) or lifetime\ndysthymia (requiring an affirmative re-\nsponse to three depressive symptoms that\nlasted 2 years, without absence of\nsymptoms for at least 2 months, at least\none of which was depressed mood,\namong individuals not concomitantly\nmeeting the criteria for major depression)\n(19). Individuals who reported that\nsymptoms were in response to bereave-\nment of no more than 2 months' duration\nwere not included in the depressed\ngroup.\nTwo sets of diabetic/depressive\nclasses were derived. The depressive\nsymptom classes included six categories:\n1) respondents with no diabetes and a to-\ntal absence of any depressive symptoms\n(CESD score of 0), 2) respondents with no\ndiabetes and with only minimal levels of\ndepressive symptoms (CESD scores of\n16), 3) respondents with minor depres-\nsion (CESD scores of 16) but no diabe-\ntes, 4) respondents with diabetes but with\na total absence of any depressive symp-\ntoms (CESD score of 0), 5) respondents\nwith diabetes and minimal depression\ndents with diabetes and minor depression\n(CESD scores of 16). The depressive di-\nagnosis classes included four categories:\n1) respondents with no diabetes or life-\ntime depressive diagnoses, 2) respon-\ndents with lifetime depressive diagnoses\nbut no diabetes, 3) respondents with dia-\nbetes but no lifetime depressive diag-\nnoses, and 4) respondents with diabetes\nand lifetime depressive diagnoses.\nAnalyses\nThe rates of incident macrovascular and\nincident microvascular complications, in-\ncident disability, and mortality over the 7\nyears of study were assessed across socio-\ndemographics, diabetic status, minor de-\npression alone, lifetime depression alone,\nand across each of the two sets of diabetic/\ndepressive classes. Cumulative rates were\nderived at each follow-up wave and dif-\nferences were assessed with 2 analyses.\nInitial logistic regression models were\nused to assess the main effects and inter-\naction effects of diabetes and depression.\nInteraction effects were assessed by enter-\ning a second-order term for depression\nand diabetes into the main effects model\n(21). Survival analysis was then used to\nestimate the hazard ratios and survival\nfunction estimates associated with the di-\nabetic/depressive classes, while control-\nling for sociodemographic characteristics\n(22). The PHREG procedure for Cox pro-\nportional hazards regression in the SAS\nstatistical software (SAS Institute, Cary,\nNC) was used to estimate these functions.\nThis procedure was particularly appro-\npriate because it easily accommodates\nboth discrete (for incident complications\nand disability) and continuous (for mor-\ntality) measurement of event times and\nallows testing of time dependency, that is,\nwhether the event occurs earlier or later in\nassociation with an independent variable.\nAll analyses were adjusted for design ef-\nfects using SUDAAN statistical software\n(SAS Institute) (23).\nRESULTS\nPrevalence of diabetes and\ndepression\nAlmost 23% of individuals in the sample\ngroup reported a physician's diagnosis of\ntype 2 diabetes; no variation by sex was\nnoted (Table 1). Approximately 24% of\nsubjects reported minor depression; how-\never, older women reported a substan-\ntially higher rate (28.6%) than older men\nria for any lifetime diagnosis of major de-\npressive episode or dysthymia; however,\nthe rate among older women (11.5%) was\nmore than twice that of older men (5.3%).\nCategorizing by depressive symptoms,\n13% of subjects had neither diabetes nor\nany depressive symptom, 47% had diabe-\ntes with only minimal depressive symp-\ntoms, 17.3% had minor depression but\nno diabetes, 2.8% had diabetes without\nany depressive symptoms, 13.1% had di-\nabetes with minimal depression, and\n6.6% had both diabetes and minor de-\npression. Categorizing by lifetime depres-\nsive diagnoses, 71.8% of the sample had\nneither diabetes nor lifetime depression,\n6.5% had lifetime depression but no dia-\nbetes, 19.2% had diabetes but no lifetime\ndepression, and 2.5% had both diabetes\nand lifetime depression.\nRates of adverse outcomes\nBy the final wave of follow-up, 35% of\nindividuals in the sample group had ma-\ncrovascular complications that were not\npresent at baseline, 14% had new mi-\ncrovascular complications, 24% had inci-\ndent disability, and 28% had died. At all\nDepression predicts adverse outcomes in diabetes\nthree waves of follow-up, the older men\nwere less likely to have incident disability\nbut more likely to have died than the\nolder women. Individuals who were aged\n75 years at baseline were more likely to\nhave incident disability and to have died\nat all three waves of follow-up. Respon-\ndents with 12 years of formal education\nwere less likely to have developed macro-\nvascular complications and disability and\nwere less likely to have died at all three\nwaves of follow-up. Those who were mar-\nried at baseline were less likely to have\ndeveloped disability and less likely to\nhave died at all three waves of follow-up.\nIndividuals with diabetes or minor de-\npression at baseline, as well as those who\nmet criteria for any lifetime diagnosis of\ndepressive disorders had much higher\nrates of all four adverse events at all three\nwaves of follow-up (lifetime depressive\ndisorders were measured at the first fol-\nlow-up and, therefore, could predict\ndeath only at the final two waves of fol-\nlow-up).\nAmong the diabetic/depressive symp-\ntom classes, respondents with both di-\nabetes and minor depression had\ndramatically higher rates of all four ad-\nverse events. For example, by the final\nwave of follow-up, 44% of subjects with\nboth conditions had macrovascular com-\nplications, compared with only 30% who\nhad neither condition. Similar rate differ-\nences were apparent for microvascular\ncomplications (43% with both conditions\nversus 36% with only diabetes and only\n3% with neither condition), disability\nwith neither condition), and mortality\nwith neither condition). The rates for sub-\njects with only diabetes and those with\nonly minor depression were comparable\nacross adverse events, with the exception\nthat those with only diabetes were more\nlikely than those with only minor depres-\nsion to develop microvascular complica-\ntions by any of the waves of follow-up.\nImportantly, subjects who had diabe-\ntes but no depressive symptoms whatso-\never (CESD score of 0) were at much\nlower risk for all adverse outcomes than\nthose with both conditions and at compa-\nrable risk to individuals with only minor\ndepression (again, with the exception of\nmicrovascular complications).\nSimilar results were found among the\ndiabetic/depressive diagnosis classes: re-\nspondents with both diabetes and any\nlifetime depressive disorders also had dra-\nmatically higher rates of all four adverse\nevents. For example, by the final wave of\nfollow-up, 64% of subjects with both con-\nditions had macrovascular complications\ncompared with only 38% of those with\nneither condition. Approximately 52% of\nthose with both conditions developed mi-\ncrovascular complications versus 42% of\nthose with only diabetes and 7% of those\nwith neither condition. Incident disability\noccurred in 52% of subjects with both\nconditions versus 23% of those with nei-\nther condition, and 56% of those with\nboth conditions died by the final wave of\nfollow-up compared with only 18% of\nthose with neither condition. Respon-\ndents with neither diabetes nor any life-\ntime depressive disorder had the lowest\nrates of all four adverse events, and the\nrates for those with only diabetes and\nthose with only lifetime depression were\ncomparable across all adverse events,\nagain with the exception that those with\nonly diabetes were more likely than those\nwith only depression to develop diabetic\ncomplications.\nMultivariate findings\nThe elevated risk associated with the in-\nteraction of diabetes and depression was\neven more apparent in the results of the\nmultivariate analyses. Results of prelimi-\nnary logistic regression models (not\nshown in the tables) predicting the inci-\ndence of all four adverse outcomes indi-\ncated that both diabetes and the two\nmeasures of depression had significant\nmain effects, with the exception that nei-\nther measure of depression predicted the\nincidence of microvascular complica-\ntions. More importantly, however, the ef-\nfects of the interaction between diabetes\nand depression were striking. First, the\neffects of the interaction seemed to be\nsynergistic (that is, greater than the addi-\ntive main effects of diabetes and depres-\nsion). For example, regarding mortality,\nthe risk associated with the interaction\nbetween diabetes and depression (odds\ngreater than the additive main effects of\n1.69; additive effects for these main\nSimilarly, regarding incident disability,\nthe risk associated with the interaction\nadditive main effects of diabetes (1.74,\nsured with depressive symptoms (1.27,\nSecond, these initial results also indi-\ncated that the interaction effects were\nmore substantial earlier than later during\nthe follow-up period. For example, the\nrisk for microvascular complications as-\nsociated with the interaction between di-\nabetes and any lifetime depressive\ndisorder was considerably higher at the\n7.95). Similarly, the risk for mortality as-\nsociated with the interaction between\ndiabetes and minor depression declined\nseries of survival analyses were conducted\nfor each of the four adverse outcomes.\nMacrovascular complications. Table 2\nshows the hazard ratio (HR) for each of\nthe four adverse events associated with\nthe combined risk factors over the 7 years\nof follow-up, controlling for the influence\nof sociodemographic characteristics.\nThese results were derived from a set of\nsurvival analyses subsequent to the pre-\nliminary logistic regression models. As\ncan be seen in Table 2, older Mexican\nAmericans with both diabetes and minor\ndepression had not only a significantly\nhigher risk of comorbid disease than\nthose with neither condition (HR 2.40,\nthan respondents with only minor de-\ndiabetes and minimal depression (1.56,\ndiabetes but no depressive symptoms\nwhatsoever (CESD score of 0) were at\nindividuals with only minor depression,\nlower than the risk even for those with\ndiabetes and minimal depression. Impor-\ntantly, these findings illustrate a gradient\nof risk from diabetic individuals with no\ndepressive symptoms to those with mini-\nmal depression to those with minor de-\npression. Similar results were found for\nincident microvascular complications, in-\ncident disability, and mortality (Table 2).\nThe risks associated with the diabetic/\ndepressive diagnosis classes are also\nshown in Table 2. Respondents with both\ndiabetes and any lifetime depressive diag-\nnoses had a significantly higher risk of\nBlack, Markides, and Ray\ndisability than those with neither condi-\nconditions also had a higher risk than re-\nspondents with only depressive diagnoses\nevident for incident macrovascular com-\nplications, incident microvascular com-\nplications, and mortality.\nImportantly, the results from testing\nfor time dependency in regards to having\nboth depression and diabetes (Table 2)\nindicate that the comorbidity of the two\nconditions was predictive not only of\ngreater risk but also of earlier risk of all\nadverse outcomes, with the exception of\nmacrovascular complications. This find-\ning was evident for both the comorbidity\nof diabetes and minor depression and the\ncomorbidity of diabetes and lifetime de-\npressive disorder.\nBecause the nature and course of ma-\njor depression and dysthymia vary con-\nsiderably, analyses were also conducted\nthat compared the hazards associated\nwith diabetes comorbid with lifetime ma-\njor depression versus diabetes comorbid\nwith lifetime dysthymia. Although not\nshown, these results indicated no sub-\nstantial differences in the risk associated\nwith either depressive disorder, with the\nexception that lifetime dysthymia was a\nsomewhat stronger predictor of mortality\nthan lifetime major depression.\nCONCLUSIONS -- Our findings\nprovide compelling evidence that the in-\nteraction between diabetes and depres-\nsion, whether measured by clinical\ndiagnostic criteria or by self-reported de-\npressive symptoms, has a synergistic ef-\nfect on adverse health outcomes in older\nMexican Americans. We provide evi-\ndence for a gradient response such that\nthe risk of adverse outcomes increases\nwith the increasing severity of depression\npresent with diabetes. Importantly, we\nalso found that the interaction between\ndiabetes and depression predicts not only\nincreased mortality, complications, and\ndisability but also earlier occurrence of all\nof these adverse outcomes, with the ex-\nception of macrovascular complications.\nSpeculation regarding the pathways\nby which depression impacts diabetes\nfalls into two broad categories: psychobe-\nhavioral and pathophysiological. Depres-\nsion may influence diabetes through\ndecreased motivation to maintain behav-\niors that will protect against the develop-\nment or worsening of diabetes, such as\nproper weight, diet, and exercise (24).\nThe increased risk of negative diabetic\noutcomes may also be the result of bio-\nlogic changes that occur as a result of de-\npression, including neurohormonal or\nneurotransmitter abnormalities (25), or\nlowered immune functioning, or inhib-\nited cortisol release, which in turn in-\ncrease vulnerability to diabetes (26,27). It\nmay also be possible that both depression\nand diabetes share common pathogene-\nsis, such as actions of the autonomic or\npolymorphism of genes associated with\nobesity, insulin resistance, and sensitivity\nto stress (30), reduction of glucose use\nand increased insulin resistance (31),\ncommon neuroendocrine pathways (32),\nor the disruption of the hypothalamic-\npituitary-adrenal axis (33). The link be-\ntween depression and diabetes may also\nbe the direct or indirect result of risk fac-\ntors common to both conditions, such as\nobesity, inactivity, medication use, and\nother preexisting psychological and phys-\nical conditions (34).\nImportantly, psychobehavioral and\npathophysiological mechanisms may act\nindependently or in conjunction. There\nTable 2--HRs for incident adverse outcomes among older Mexican Americans*\nMacrovascular\ncomplications\nMicrovascular\ncomplications Disability Mortality\n  and depressive symptoms\n  and lifetime depressive diagnoses\n*n  2,830 for mortality analyses and 2,462 for all other analyses with depressive symptoms, and n  2,092 for all analyses with lifetime depression; CESD scores\nof 1\u00ad15; CESD scores of 16 or more; \u00a7CESD score of 0; CIDI/DSM-IV criteria for any lifetime major depression or dysthymia.\nDepression predicts adverse outcomes in diabetes\nmay also be differences in the timing of\nactions of psychobehavioral versus patho-\nphysiological mechanisms. A recent study\nby Peyrot and Rubin (24) suggests that\nthe influence of factors such as stress and\nsocial support may engage in response to\nlife circumstances, whereas factors such\nas disease severity, blood glucose, and\nother biologic measures may be more\nconsistent, long-term influences.\nIt should be noted that this study has\nseveral limitations. First, diabetes was\nmeasured by self-reported physician di-\nagnosis because no measure of fasting\nblood glucose was available in the study.\nSelf-reports of chronic conditions, how-\never, have been widely used in popula-\ntion-based surveys and have proven to be\nhighly reliable, including self-reports of\ndiabetes (35). Second, although the meth-\nods used to assess depression are standard\nand well validated for use in epidemio-\nlogic studies, there is no absolute cer-\ntainty regarding diagnosis. In addition,\nthe assessment for lifetime depressive dis-\norder did not occur until the first fol-\nlow-up interview. The fact that similar\nresults were found for both clinical diag-\nnostic criteria and high levels of depres-\nsive symptoms and the evidence of a\ngradient in severity of depression, how-\never, suggest that our findings are robust\nand generalizable. In addition, we could\nnot account for the transition between de-\npressive states over time. Depression can\noccur once for a short time period, con-\nsistently over a long time period, or can\ncome and go repeatedly over the course of\ntime. Future work will need to incorpo-\nrate these transitions. Finally, the present\nstudy was limited to older Mexican Amer-\nicans with type 2 diabetes. It is not clear\nwhether the interaction between depres-\nsion and diabetes is consistent across ra-\ncial and ethnic groups, across age-groups,\nor in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.\nThis study is unique, however, in that\nit is the first large, population-based study\nto show that the interaction between de-\npression and diabetes has a synergistic ef-\nfect on mortality and the development of\ncomplications and disability. In other\nwords, the effects of concomitant depres-\nsion and diabetes on negative health out-\ncomes are multiplicative, that is, greater\nthan simply the sum of the main effects of\neach individual condition. Furthermore,\nour results also show that the interaction\nresults in earlier occurrence of macrovas-\ncular complications, microvascular com-\nplications, disability, and mortality.\nOur study findings hold particular\nclinical importance because effective\ntreatment is available for both diabetes\nand depression. Close case management\nof diabetes that includes assessment and\ntreatment for depression has been shown\nto be beneficial. Treatment for depression\nin patients with diabetes can result in im-\nproved medical outcomes, as well as im-\nproved psychological well-being. Most\nimportantly, treatment for depression has\nbeen found to be associated with im-\nproved glycemic control (36). Treatment\nfor depression has also been found to re-\nsult in weight reduction and improve-\nments in diabetic neuropathy (37).\nTreatment for diabetes has been demon-\nstrated to reduce functional disability, al-\nleviate psychological distress in depressed\nindividuals, and increase overall well-\nbeing (38). As it has been amply demon-\nstrated that improved glycemic control\nresults in reductions of the microvascular\nand macrovascular consequences of dia-\nbetes, including mortality (39) and reduc-\ntion of diabetic symptoms (38), treatment\nfor depression that leads to improved gly-\ncemic control is essential for depressed\ndiabetic adults.\n"
