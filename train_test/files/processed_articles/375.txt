Although intact paint does not gener-\nally result in significant immediate exposure, all\npaint eventually deteriorates; lead-based paint\nthat is chipping, peeling, or flaking or other-\nwise separating from its substrate presents a\nhazard. In addition, lead-contaminated settled\ndust, which is often found in houses with dete-\nriorated lead-based paint, is a significant lead\nhazard (Lanphear et al. 1998). PbD can also be\ngenerated from the friction and impact of lead-\npainted surfaces (Dixon et al. 2007) and during\nhousing renovation and repair projects where\nlead-based paint is present and proper precau-\ntions are not in place (Lanphear et al. 2005a;\nReissman et al. 2002). The use of leaded gaso-\nline, which peaked in the early 1970s, has also\ncontaminated soil around the home (Mielke\n1999). Many studies, employing a variety of\nresearch designs, have demonstrated that soil-\nlead concentrations are a significant contribu-\ntor to PbD and children's PbB (Bornschein\ncross-sectional (Lanphear et al. 1998) and\nlongitudinal studies [U.S. Department of\nHousing and Urban Development (HUD)\n2004] have firmly established the correlation\nof settled PbD and children's PbB.

In 1999\u00ad2004, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)\ncollected dust lead (PbD) loading samples from the homes of children 12\u00ad60 months of age.\nObjectives: In this study we aimed to compare national PbD levels with existing health-based stan-\ndards and to identify housing and demographic factors associated with floor and windowsill PbD.\nMethods: We used NHANES PbD data (n = 2,065 from floors and n = 1,618 from windowsills)\nand covariates to construct linear and logistic regression models.\nResults: The population-weighted geometric mean floor and windowsill PbD were 0.5 \u00b5g/ft2\nthe floors and 4.0% of the sills had PbD at or above current federal standards of 40 and 250 \u00b5g/ft2,\nrespectively. Income, race/ethnicity, floor surface/condition, windowsill PbD, year of construction,\nrecent renovation, smoking, and survey year were significant predictors of floor PbD [the propor-\ntion of variability in the dependent variable accounted for by the model (R2) = 35%]. A similar set\nof predictors plus the presence of large areas of exterior deteriorated paint in pre-1950 homes and\nthe presence of interior deteriorated paint explained 20% of the variability in sill PbD. A compan-\nbetween children's blood lead and PbD.\nConclusion: Most houses with children have PbD levels that comply with federal standards but\nmay put children at risk. Factors associated with PbD in our population-based models are primarily\nthe same as factors identified in smaller at-risk cohorts. PbD on floors and windowsills should be\nkept as low as possible to protect children.\nKey words: dust lead, housing, lead, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey,\nGaitens et al.\nof age with measured PbB.

Characteristics included\nchild's race/ethnicity, household and family\nincome, type of home (e.g., mobile home or\ntrailer, one-family house detached, one-family\nhouse attached to one or more houses, apart-\nment, or \"other\"), number of apartment units\nin building, year of construction, number of\nyears the family had lived in the home, owner-\nship status, and smoking in the home. Parents\nof participants reported the race/ethnicity\nof their child based on lists that included an\nopen response. We used a composite race/eth-\nnicity variable for this analysis: non-Hispanic\nwhite, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic (com-\nposed mostly of Mexican American because\nof oversampling), or other race or ethnicity.\nThe poverty-to-income ratio (PIR) is the ratio\nof income to the family's appropriate pov-\nerty threshold (Office of Management and\nthe poverty threshold, whereas PIR values\nof  1.00 indicate income above the poverty\nlevel. Variables on smoking behavior included\nthe presence of smoking in the home, num-\nber of smokers, and the number of cigarettes\nsmoked in the home per day. An adult mem-\nber of the household reported the presence\nof peeling, chipping, or flaking paint (i.e.,\ndeteriorated) inside and outside the home.\nThe household member categorized the paint\ncondition inside the house as follows: no dete-\nriorated paint, deteriorated paint but no large\nareas, large areas of deteriorated paint in one\nroom, or large areas of deteriorated paint in\nmore than one room. Similarly, the house-\nhold member classified the exterior paint con-\ndition as no deteriorated paint, deteriorated\npaint but no large areas, or large areas of dete-\nriorated paint. Large areas inside the home\nwere defined as areas larger than one sheet of\na newspaper and large areas on the outside of\nthe home as areas larger than a door.\nThe household member also reported\nwhether the home had been repainted, whether\nthey had scraped old paint or whether there\nhad been renovations of windows, cabinets,\nand/or walls in the preceding 12 months.\nPbD measurements. Interviewers collected\nseparate single-surface floor and windowsill\nPbD samples from the room where the fam-\nily member reported that children spent most\nof their time while awake, typically the living\nroom or play room. Floor PbD wipe samples\nwere collected from a measured 1 ft2 area\nin 2,065 homes using a standard procedure\nInternational 2003). Floor PbD was measured\nusing graphite furnace atomic absorption\nspectroscopy and reported in micrograms per\nsquare foot. Windowsill PbD in 1,618 homes\nwas also reported as micrograms per square\nfoot using information on the length and\nwidth dimensions of the windowsill wiped\narea. The laboratory detection limits (DLs)\nfor the moist wipe samples were 0.16 \u00b5g for\nfloors and 2 \u00b5g for windowsills. Blank samples\nwere collected in 10% of the sampled homes.\nRobust laboratory quality control procedures\nFloor and sill PbD values that were below\nthe DLs were assigned the value of DL/\n\u00ad\nthe NHANES dust analysis data set. Forty-four\npercent of the sill loadings and 12.5% of the\nfloor loadings were below the DLs. Although\nsill loadings are generally higher than floor\nPbD, the surface area of windowsills is typically\nless than the 1 ft2 sampled on floors, resulting\nin more sill loadings below the DL. The effects\nof the high percentage of sill loadings below\nthe DL in the linear model are limited because\nthe surface areas of sills sampled varied and\nconsequently the loadings varied.\nWe categorized the floor's surface and\ncondition as uncarpeted smooth and clean-\nable, uncarpeted not smooth or not clean-\nable, low-pile carpet, or high-pile carpet.\nWindowsill conditions were characterized\nas either smooth and cleanable or not. The\nmodeling presented here also examined room\ncleanliness, presence of clutter, and room\nlocation as reported by the individual collect-\ning the wipe sample.\nStatistical methods. We analyzed data\nusing SAS (SAS System for Windows, ver-\nsion 9.1.3; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC)\nand SUDAAN software (version 9.0.0; RTI\nInternational, Research Triangle Park, NC).\nWe used linear regression models to pre-\ndict natural log-transformed PbD and logistic\nregression models to predict the probability\nthat a home's PbD exceeds various thresholds\nft2 for windowsills). Models for 10 \u00b5g/ft2 for\nfloors and 100 \u00b5g/ft2 for windowsills were\nselected because analyses in the companion\narticle indicate that 95% of children 1\u00ad5 years\nof age would have PbB  10 \u00b5g/dL at these\ndust lead levels. Because only three homes in\nthe data set had floor PbD exceeding the fed-\neral hazard standard of 40 \u00b5g/ft2, we could\nnot use logistic regression modeling to predict\nthe probability that floor PbD exceeded the\nstandard. The models adjusted the parameter\nestimates for the clustering and unequal sur-\nvey weights within NHANES. The modeling\nemployed Taylor series expansion theory with-\nout degrees of freedom adjustments. Backward\nelimination of insignificant independent vari-\nables (p > 0.10) was followed by additional\nsteps to allow addition and/or removal of vari-\nables. For certain variables, there was a high\npercentage of missing values (e.g., 28% of the\nstudy sample did not have year of construction\ndocumented). We fit an intercept term for the\nstudy participants who had a missing value\nso that we could include these homes in the\nanalysis. For categorical variables, we reported\nthe p-value for the test for a significant differ-\nence in the dependent variable between the\ncategory of interest and the comparison cat-\negory, where the comparison category is the\ncategory with parameter estimate of zero. The\noverall p-value is the type 3 F-test that cap-\ntures the overall statistical significance of each\nvariable included in the model. For categorical\nvariables with missing values, the missing level\nwas not included in this hypothesis test.\nTable 1.

For example, smoking and year of\nbuilding construction were significant in all\nthree models. Paint scraping in the preceding\n12 months and the years lived in the home\nwere only significant in the logistic model for\nPbD  100 \u00b5g/ft2. Window surface condition\nwas only significant in the linear model.\nDiscussion\nConsistent with other national data (Jacobs\net al. 2002), we confirm that the year of con-\nstruction is a strong predictor of PbD and\nthat post-1978 housing has significantly lower\nPbD than older housing. Housing units built\nafter 1950 have significantly lower floor PbD\nthan older housing. Furthermore, floor PbD\nnot significantly different than in the pre-\n1940 houses. This is consistent with the\nconcentration of lead in paint. Before 1940,\nthis concentration typically ranged from 10\nHowever, in 1955, a voluntary paint industry\nstandard limited the concentration to 1%,\nalthough the degree of compliance with this\nstandard is unknown (American National\nConsumer Product Safety Commission and\nCongress banned the use of lead paint for res-\nidential use, limiting lead in new house paint\nto 0.06% by weight (Consumer Products\nor wall renovation within the preceding 12\nmonths had higher floor PbD than other\nhomes. Renovation activities completed with-\nout using lead-safe work practices can gener-\nate significant amounts of PbD (Jacobs et al.\n2003). The U.S. EPA recently promulgated\na final regulation in an attempt to control\nexposures from renovation (U.S. EPA 2008).\nReplacing windows in a lead-safe manner can\nhelp control PbD and may have large eco-\nnomic benefits (Nevin et al. 2008). Compared\nwith other housing components, windows are\nknown to have the highest levels of lead-based\npaint and lead-contaminated dust (Jacobs\nWe found that dust wipe samples taken\nfrom homes with chipping, peeling, or flaking\n(i.e., deteriorated) paint had higher windowsill\nPbD than homes without deteriorated paint,\nwhich is consistent with other research (U.S.\nwe expected to see similar findings for floors,\nwe did not. This could be attributable to other\nfactors included in the model. For example,\nPIR and recent renovation were significant\nin the floor model, but not in the windowsill\nmodel, which could have masked the effect\nof deteriorated paint. In addition, it is more\nlikely that floors are more regularly cleaned\nthan windowsills.\nThe homes of non-Hispanic blacks had\nsignificantly higher PbD than the homes of\nnon-Hispanic whites, even after controlling for\nother factors. Many prior studies have shown\nthat African-American children are at higher\nrisk compared with white children (U.S. CDC\n2005). For example, similar to our findings,\nfound that African-American children were\nexposed to higher PbD loadings and worse\nhousing conditions than white children.\nPreviously published studies suggest that\nrental units were more likely to have lead-based\npaint hazards than owner-occupied housing\nAlthough we found that homeownership sta-\ntus was a significant predictor of floor PbD in\nbivariate analysis, after controlling for other fac-\ntors such as PIR, renovation, and the presence\nof deteriorating paint, it was not significant in\nthe final models. Because low-income fami-\nlies are more likely to rent, the fact that home\nownership was not significant in the model\n(but poverty was) is not surprising. Moreover,\nthe type of home had a significant association\nwith PbD in bivariate analysis, but not in the\nfinal models, again probably because of the\nconfounding influence of poverty.\nA prior study found a relationship between\nexposure to environmental tobacco smoke\nexposure and the PbB levels of young chil-\ndren who were included in the NHANES III\nlead is a component of tobacco smoke, such a\nrelationship between PbB levels and tobacco\nsmoke exposure is not surprising. That smok-\ning in the home was a significant predictor of\nfloor and windowsill PbD, even when control-\nling other factors, suggests that lead in second-\nhand smoke is a significant contributor to lead\non interior surfaces, at least at the relatively\nlow surface loadings documented in this study.\nWe found that the surface condition from\nwhich the PbD samples were taken signifi-\ncantly influences the reported PbD. Other\nstudies have found that uncarpeted smooth\nand cleanable surfaces have significantly\nlower PbD after cleaning compared with\nrough uncarpeted surfaces (Dixon et al. 1999;\nEttinger et al. 2002). Although our results\nindicated that floor PbD on uncarpeted non-\nsmooth or noncleanable surfaces was not sig-\nnificantly higher than floor PbD on smooth\nand cleanable surfaces, the trend was in the\nexpected direction. It is possible that our find-\nings were not statistically significant because\nof the small number of dust samples taken\nfrom nonsmooth or noncleanable floor sur-\nfaces in this data set.\nThe presence of carpeting also influ-\nenced reported PbD. We found that PbD\non carpeted floors was significantly lower\nthan lead loadings on hard-surfaced floors.\nThis observed difference in lead loading by\nflooring type is likely attributable to the fact\nthat wipe sampling was the methodology\nused in this study. Wipe sampling captures\nonly dust adhering to the tops of the carpet\nfibers, whereas most of the dust in the carpet\nmatrix is located deeper in the pile. A study\nthat reported much higher PbD in vacuum\nsamples from carpet compared with adja-\ncent wipe samples (Bai et al. 2003) supports\nthis idea. The significance of this observation\nwith respect to children's lead exposure is not\nwell understood. Our findings do not clarify\nwhether or not carpet contributes to higher or\nlower exposures.\nThe NHANES survey year was signifi-\ncantly associated with PbD. Although PbD\nshould decline with time as the ratio of post-\nnitude of the decline (14%) for the floor PbD\nbetween the first and second waves was much\nlarger than expected. Similarly, the magnitude\nof the decline (43%) between the first and\nsecond waves for windowsill PbD is unlikely\nto be explained only by temporal changes\nin national PbD. Although many housing\ncharacteristics were included in the model,\nother significant factors that we were unable\nto control for may exist (e.g., different waves\nof NHANES sampling may occur in different\ngeographic regions). Thus, the year of survey\nvariable may reflect geographic differences\nin the three study wave locations that could\naccount for the observed trend in floor PbD.\nWe used data from a large national sur-\nvey that combined housing and environmen-\ntal data, which is a strength of our study.\nHowever, the housing data included in this\nstudy may not be representative of the national\nhousing stock. The sampling and weighting\nmethodology used in NHANES is population\nbased, not geography based; thus, the survey\nincludes a nationally representative sample\nof the U.S. population but not a representa-\ntive sample of U.S. housing. Integrated health\nand housing surveys that are representative of\nboth the population and the housing stock are\nneeded in the United States; such surveys were\ncompleted recently in eight European cities\n(Bonnefoy et al. 2003). Finally, a limitation of\nthe NHANES PbD data is that they are based\non a single floor and a single windowsill PbD\nmeasurement in a given home. The HUD\nGuidelines for the Evaluation and Control of\nLead-Based Paint Hazard in Housing recom-\nmend that six to eight floor and sill samples be\ntaken to help reduce spatial variability, which\ncould not be assessed here (U.S. HUD 1995).\nDust lead in homes of U.S. children\nDespite these potential limitations, the study\nresults presented are largely consistent with\nearlier findings.\nLevels of PbD on floors and windowsills\nshould be kept as low as possible to protect\nchildren from lead exposure. The current stan-\ndards for floor and windowsill PbD were set in\ndeveloping a PbB level > 15 \u00b5g/dL [the envi-\nronmental intervention level established by the\nCDC (2005)], in light of feasibility and mea-\nsurement limitations. These findings show that\nin most children's homes, the average level of\nPbD is well below the current standards, mak-\ning it feasible to lower the current standards\nand thus afford more protection for children.\nReferences\nAmerican National Standards Institute. 1955.
