Few studies have evaluated the potential influence of Helicobacter pylori on biomarkers for diabetes.\nMethods. We conducted cross-sectional analyses using data from 7417 participants in the National Health and\n(aged $3 years) to assess the association between H. pylori and levels of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c).\nResults. There was no association between H. pylori and history of self-reported diabetes. Helicobacter pylori\nseropositivity, especially H. pylori cagA positivity, was positively associated (P , .01, NHANES III; P 5 .02,\nNHANES 1999\u00ad2000) with HbA1c levels after excluding individuals with history of diabetes and controlling for\npotential confounders. There was also a synergistic interaction between H. pylori and higher body mass index (BMI),\nsuch that increased levels of HbA1c associated with having both H. pylori and higher BMI were greater than the sum\nof their individual effects (P for interaction , .01). This interaction was observed consistently in both NHANES III\nConclusions. The findings indicate a role of H. pylori in impaired glucose tolerance in adults that may be\npotentiated by higher BMI level.\nDiabetes mellitus, a chronic disease marked by high\nlevels of sugar in the blood, is common and increasing\naround the world [1]. Although major risk factors for\ntype 2 diabetes, such as obesity, have been identified,\nresearch that assesses susceptibility to diabetes risk due\nto obesity is needed.\nThe mammalian stomach produces leptin and ghre-\nlin, 2 hormones involved in energy homeostasis [2, 3]\nand whose interactions affect obesity, insulin sensi-\ntivity, and glucose homeostasis [4, 5]. Helicobacter\npylori are gram-negative bacteria that colonize the\nhuman stomach; increasing evidence indicates that\nH. pylori is involved in the regulation of these 2 hor-\nmones [6]. Helicobacter pylori is an ancient organism\nthat is highly prevalent in developing countries but is\nfalling in incidence in developed countries [7, 8]. This\nchange in the microecology of human populations\ndue to the disappearance of H. pylori may have met-\nabolic consequences both early and late in life and, in\nparticular, could affect risk of obesity and diabetes\nby influencing the production of gastric leptin and\nghrelin [6].\nThe literature on the relationship between H. pylori\ncolonization and diabetes is inconsistent [9\u00ad15]. To\nbetter understand the pathophysiologic mechanisms by\nwhich H. pylori plays a role in diabetes etiology, studies\nof diabetes biomarkers are needed. Glycated hemoglobin\n(HbA1c) results from the nonenzymatic glycosylation of\nhemoglobin, reflecting integrated blood glucose levels\nfasting is not necessary for its measurement. HbA1c\nlevels are predictive of both prevalent and incident\ndiabetes and are useful in diagnosing prediabetes and\ndiabetes [16\u00ad18]. Prior studies on the association\nbetween H. pylori and HbA1c have been limited [19].\nIn cross-sectional analyses using data from 7417\nparticipants in the National Health and Nutrition\nCorrespondence: Yu Chen, PhD, Departments of Environmental Medicine and\nMedicine, New York University School of Medicine, 650 First Ave, New York, NY\n\u00d3 The Author 2012.

NHANES is a program of studies designed\nto assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children\nin the United States, using a stratified, multistage probability\ndesign to select a representative sample of the civilian, non-\ninstitutionalized US population [20]. NHANES III, the seventh\nhealth examination survey performed in the United States\nin 2 phases, each comprising a national probability sample.\nwere adults sampled during the first phase from 18 October\ncame a continuous annual survey of 5000 people rather than\nof NHANES IV. The survey protocol was approved by the\nInstitutional Review Board of the Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention. All participants gave written informed con-\nreleases of this cross-sectional national survey that include\nlaboratory data on H. pylori status. The present study included\nand sociodemographic and lifestyle variables.\nHelicobacter pylori Status\nIn NHANES III phase 1, examinees aged $18 years were tested\nfor H. pylori immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies in 1996 using\nthe H. pylori IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)\n(Wampole Laboratories) and CagA IgG ELISA developed and\nstandardized at Vanderbilt University, as described previously\n[22]. On the basis of H. pylori and cagA results, patients were\nclassified into 3 groups: H. pylori\u00adpositive and cagA-positive;\nH. pylori\u00adpositive and cagA-negative; and H. pylori\u00adnegative and\ncagA-negative, as described previously [23, 24]. The H. pylori\u00ad\nnegative cagA-positive group included all persons with a positive\nCagA assay regardless of the results of the H. pylori assay,\nbased on the utility of the CagA antigen to detect true-positive\nresponses in culture-positive persons in the face of negative or\nequivocal values in the H. pylori serologic assay [25]. By defi-\nnition, all persons in the H. pylori\u00adnegative group had negative\nCagA assays.\nAmong all 8969 participants aged $3 years enrolled in\nusing the Wampole ELISA. For each specimen, an immune\nstatus ratio (ISR) was calculated by dividing the specimen\noptical density by the mean optical density of the cutoff\ncontrols. Specimens were considered negative if the ISR\nDiabetes Status and HbA1c Measurement\nDiabetes was defined by either self-report of a physician di-\nagnosis or insulin use. HbA1c measurements were performed\nby the Diabetes Diagnostic Laboratory at the University of\nMissouri\u00adColumbia using the Diamat Analyzer System (Bio-\nstandardized to the reference method that was used for the\nDiabetes Control and Complications Trial [28].\nStatistical Methods\nDescriptive analyses were first conducted to compare the\ndistributions of H. pylori status and means of HbA1c by so-\nciodemographic and lifestyle variables. Multiple linear re-\ngression models were conducted to evaluate the relationship\nbetween H. pylori status and HbA1c levels. We computed\nadjusted least squares means of HbA1c by H. pylori status in the\noverall population. We also conducted analyses excluding\ncases of diabetes and insulin users to evaluate the associations\nin individuals whose HbA1c levels were not affected by\ntreatments of diabetes, such as insulin use. Potential con-\nfounders including age, gender, race/ethnicity, body mass\nindex (BMI), smoking status, and educational attainment\nwere adjusted in the models. Analyses were conducted to\nevaluate HbA1c levels by H. pylori positive and negative status\nstatus was available only in NHANES III, analyses that as-\nsessed HbA1c levels by joint status of H. pylori and cagA\n(H. pylori\u00adpositive and cagA-positive; H. pylori\u00adpositive and\ncagA-negative; and H. pylori\u00adnegative) were performed only in\nNHANES III. In addition, we evaluated whether the association\nbetween H. pylori and HbA1c differed by BMI by including\na cross-product term between H. pylori and BMI expressed as\na continuous variable. The P value of the coefficient for the cross-\nproduct term was used to consider the significance of the in-\nteraction. We also conducted stratified analyses using the stan-\ndard definition for overweight (BMI $25) vs normal (BMI ,25).\nTo evaluate the association between H. pylori status and di-\nabetes, we estimated odds ratios (ORs) for diabetes in relation to\nH. pylori using unconditional logistic regression, controlling\nfor the same potential variables indicated above. Similar\nanalyses for testing interaction by BMI and stratified BMI\nlevel also were conducted. To evaluate the association between\nH. pylori and diabetes using a more strict definition of di-\nabetes, sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate the\nassociation between H. pylori status and current use of insulin\ndue to diabetes.\nAll analyses were conducted using SAS 9.1.4 proc survey\nprocedures (SAS Institute), accounting for the complex\nsampling design in NHANES. Sampling errors were estimated\nusing the primary sampling units and strata provided in the\ndata set. Sampling weights were used to adjust for nonresponse\nbias and the oversampling in NHANES.\nRESULTS\nIn NHANES III, men had higher levels of HbA1c compared\nwith women (Table 1). As expected, there was a positive as-\nsociation between age and HbA1c and between BMI and\nHbA1c in both NHANES study populations. Participants with\nhigher educational attainment or who were past smokers had\nsignificantly lower HbA1c levels. There also were associations\nwith race/ethnicity such that non-Hispanic blacks and Mexi-\ncan Americans had a higher level of HbA1c compared with\nnon-Hispanic whites (Table 1). Older participants, those who\nhad lower educational attainment, non-Hispanic black and\nMexican American participants, and those with a higher BMI\nwere more likely to have been colonized by H. pylori com-\npared with their counterparts. In total, these data confirm\nexpected associations of demographic and lifestyle factors\nwith HbA1c and H. pylori status and suggest a relationship\nbetween H. pylori and BMI.\nAssociation Between H. pylori and HbA1c\nwho were H. pylori\u00adpositive had higher mean HbA1c levels\n(P 5 .02) (Table 2), a finding that persisted when subjects\nwho had known diabetes or were insulin users were excluded\n(P 5 .02). The positive association was more apparent among\nthose aged $18 years (P 5 .01). In contrast, among those\naged # 18 years, there was no association between H. pylori\nand HbA1c levels. There was a significant interaction between\nH. pylori and age, such that the increased levels of HbA1c as-\nsociated with H. pylori positivity was greater in those who were\naged .18 years (P for interaction ,.01). When the population\nof adults was stratified on the basis of BMI (,25 and $25),\nthere was a positive association between H. pylori positivity\nTable 1.

The interaction between H. pylori and BMI\nalso was significant, suggesting a synergistic effect between\nH. pylori positivity and higher BMI in relation to HbA1c. The\nmagnitude of the positive associations between H. pylori\nappears to be comparable when cases of diabetes and current\ninsulin use were excluded.\nAssociation Between H. pylori cagA and HbA1c\nBecause H. pylori cagA status also was ascertained in NHANES\nIII, we could determine whether persons who had cagA-positive\nor cagA-negative strains had differences in HbA1c (Table 3).\nThese data showed a progressive increase in HbA1c compar-\ning H. pylori\u00adnegative, H. pylori\u00adpositive/cagA-negative, and\nH. pylori\u00adpositive/cagA-positive subjects in the overall study\npopulation (P 5 .02), especially after those with diabetes or\nTable 2.

In\nstratified analyses by BMI, H. pylori cagA positivity was pos-\nitively related to HbA1c levels in both participants with\na lower BMI and participants with a higher BMI after ex-\ncluding those with history of diabetes. The joint status of\nhigher BMI and H. pylori cagA positivity (but not cagA neg-\nativity) was associated with increased HbA1c levels in relation\nto the sum of their individual effects (P for interaction , .01).\nAssociation Between H. pylori and Diabetes\nWe also estimated ORs for diabetes in relation to H. pylori\ntion between H. pylori and prevalence of diabetes (OR, 1.30;\nwas significant among participants with BMI .25 (OR, 1.43;\nciation between H. pylori and diabetes differs by levels of BMI\nIn NHANES III, there was no association between H. pylori\nand diabetes overall nor was there an association in partic-\nipants stratified by BMI (Table 4). We also further assessed\nwhether there was an association between cagA positivity and\ndiabetes. The data also indicate that there was no association\nbetween cagA positivity and diabetes overall and in stratified\nanalyses by BMI.\nIn sensitivity analyses, we evaluated the association between\nH. pylori and current use of insulin due to diabetes. There was no\nsignificant association between H. pylori or H. pylori cagA\npositivity in the overall populations or within BMI strata, al-\nthough the sample size was limited for this analysis (data not\nshown).\nDISCUSSION\nIn this large, cross-sectional study, we found a positive associ-\nation between H. pylori status and HbA1c levels among adult\nparticipants free of diabetes. The increased levels of HbA1c as-\nsociated with H. pylori were greater among those with higher\nBMI. These associations were consistent in the independent\npopulations from the 2 NHANES, completed about 10 years\napart. In addition, H. pylori cagA positivity was related to high\nlevels of HbA1c, and there was an interaction between H. pylori\ncagA positivity and higher levels of BMI in HbA1c. However,\nthe data did not indicate that there was an association between\nH. pylori and self-report of diabetes.\nPrevious studies on the association between H. pylori and\ndiabetes have had mixed results [9\u00ad14], likely due to incon-\nsistencies in the methods used to define H. pylori positivity and\ndiabetes status, the limited sample sizes, and adjustments for\npotential confounders [9]. In particular, the accuracy of self-\nreported data on medical history depends on the subjects'\nknowledge and understanding of the relevant information,\ntheir ability to recall, and their willingness to report it [29],\nwhich also may change over time. In prior studies, the sensi-\ntivity of self-reported diabetes has ranged from 66.7% to 85.2%\n[29\u00ad32], which may lead to nondifferential misclassification\nand a bias toward the null. In addition, the prevalence of\nTable 3.

It has been estimated that\nthe prevalence of obesity increased substantially from NHANES\ninformation on diagnosis of diabetes are needed to evaluate the\nassociation between H. pylori and diabetes.\nWe found a positive association between H. pylori status and\nHbA1c levels, a valid and reliable biomarker for long-term\nblood glucose level [16\u00ad18]. The results from the 2 NHANES\npopulations were consistent, suggesting validity of the find-\nings. Although the present study is a cross-sectional study,\nreverse causation is not likely. Helicobacter pylori is acquired\nalmost exclusively in childhood [8], and there is no clear\nmechanism for how glucose intolerance present only after the\nage of 18 would increase risk of H. pylori colonization. It also is\nunlikely that H. pylori positivity and high levels of HbA1c\nlevels share a mutual antecedent cause because there is no\ndiathesis to both acquire H. pylori and to cause glucose in-\ntolerance. The most plausible hypothesis is that H. pylori di-\nrectly or indirectly increases levels of HbA1c in adulthood,\nparticularly in obese individuals. We now know that H. pylori\nplays a role in the regulation of leptin and ghrelin [6, 35\u00ad38],\nwhich are central to energy homeostasis and metabolism [4, 5].\nAccumulating evidence also indicates that the metabolic\nsyndrome is an inflammatory disorder. Helicobacter pylori\ninduces gastric inflammation; the H. pylori\u00adpositive stomach\nand the H. pylori\u00adnegative stomach are markedly different in\nterms of T-cell and B-cell populations and proinflammatory\ncytokines [39\u00ad41]dthese have a local effect, but there is in-\ncreasing evidence for global effects [42].\nHelicobacter pylori strains possessing the cag genomic island\nexpress a type 4 secretion system that injects the CagA protein\ninto human epithelial cells [43]. Antibody responses to the\nCagA protein permit detection of such cag-positive strains\n[22], which are more interactive with host cells than cag-\nnegative strains [43, 44] and are associated with higher risk for\ngastric cancer and peptic ulcer disease and lower risk of esopha-\nbased on the NHANES III study population show a gradient in\nA1c levels from H. pylori\u00adnegative, to H. pylori\u00adpositive and\ncagA-negative to H. pylori\u00adpositive and cagA-positive. This con-\nsistency, predicted by the biological differences between the\n3 states of gastric microecology [43, 44], provides evidence\nthat the relationship is not due to artifacts.\nAlthough the literature indicates that there is no clear re-\nlationship between H. pylori and obesity [23], our study pro-\nvides further evidence that H. pylori affects host metabolic status.\nThe increasing trend in diabetes and obesity can not be ex-\nplained by the decreasing prevalence of H. pylori because di-\nabetes and obesity are multifactorial disorders that involve\nenvironmental, lifestyle, genetic, and social factors. Given that\nTable 4.

However, among older individuals and especially\nthose with a higher BMI, glucose intolerance associated with\nH. pylori could remain significant. The findings add to the\nevidence of a model for age-related pleiotrophy of H. pylori\nor a life-course perspective in H. pylori [44]. The potential\nbenefits of H. pylori occur predominantly earlier in life, in-\ncluding a reduced risk of asthma [24, 27], tuberculosis re-\nactivation [50], childhood diarrhea [51], and gastroesophageal\nreflux disease [45\u00ad49]. Among older individuals, the adverse\nhealth effects include peptic ulcer disease, gastric cancer, and\nperhaps increased glucose intolerance. The data from this\nstudy are consistent with findings that H. pylori eradication in\nolder individuals may be beneficial.\nNotes\nFinancial support.
