This legislation was in response to the Public\nHealth Service's recommendation that all women who are ca-\npable of getting pregnant should consume 400 lg folic acid/d to\nreduce the risk of having a child with a neural tube defect (NTD)\n(2). The predicted increase in intake of folic acid was 100 g/d by\nthe target population (1). However, the actual intake of folic acid\nafter folic acid fortification has exceeded the projected intake\n(3, 4) because several fortified foods contain higher amounts of\nfolic acid than the amount required by the Food and Drug Ad-\nministration regulation (5). Since folic acid fortification began,\nthe prevalence of NTDs has decreased by 19% in the United\nStates (6). Additionally, folic acid fortification has significantly\nimproved circulating folate and red blood cell folate concen-\ntrations (7\u00ad11) and has lowered circulating total homocysteine\nBecause folic acid supplementation cures folate deficiency\u00ad\ninduced macrocytic or megaloblastic anemia (macrocytosis),\nwe hypothesized that folic acid fortification would have\na positive impact on indexes of anemia and the prevalence of\nanemia, especially macrocytosis, in the United States. No data\non the possible impact of folic acid fortification on indicators\nof anemia or the prevalence of overall anemia and macrocy-\ntosis have been published. From a public health perspective, it\nis important to monitor the impact of nationwide folic acid\nfortification efforts on the overall health and well being of US\nresidents on a continuous basis because the actual consump-\ntion of folic acid from food fortification has exceeded the\npredicted intake (3, 4).\nThe National Center for Health Statistics of the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention conducts cross-sectional Na-\ntional Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES)\non civilian, noninstitutionalized residents of the United States.\nbegan.

NHANES is based on a complex, stratified,\nmultistage probability sample survey design. Demographic, so-\ncioeconomic, dietary, and health-related data were collected in the\nparticipants' home as part of a household interview. Health ex-\namination was administered by a physician on all persons in the\nhousehold interviewed in Mobile Examination Centers (MECs).\nSome received health examinations in their homes because they\nwere unable to come to the MECs. Certain individuals, such as\nyoung children, older persons, and non-Hispanic black (NHB) and\nMexican American/Hispanic (MA/H) participants were over-\nsampled to yield reliable estimates for these groups.\nIn this study, we used data from 4 surveys: NHANES 1988\u00ad\nthe survey methodologies and analytic guidelines was reported\nwere examined in MECs; and 493 were examined in the home.\nducted as continuous, annual surveys rather than as periodic\nthe household-interview component and 78% for the examination\ncomponent; whereas, the survey response rates for NHANES\nStudy sample\nFrom the analysis, missing values for sex, race-ethnicity, age,\npoverty:income ratio, vitamin/mineral supplement use, hemo-\nglobin, hematocrit, and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) were\nexcluded. Additionally, individuals who reported their race-\nethnicity as ``unknown'' or other than non-Hispanic white (NHW),\nNHB, or MA/H were excluded because of a small sample size.\nAfter the above criteria were applied, the final study sample\nFor the purpose of data analysis, age was classified into 3 cate-\nto define the socioeconomic status. Poverty:income ratio is the\nratio of the family's income to the family's appropriate threshold\nincome. A poverty:income ratio of ,1.0 was considered an\nincome below poverty level (22). The poverty:income ratio was\ncategories. Individuals who took vitamin/mineral supplements\n1 mo before the survey were categorized as supplement users.\nDietary intake assessment\nIn NHANES, nutrient intakes were calculated from 24-h di-\netary recalls, which were collected by using an automated,\nmicrocomputer-based dietary interview and coding system known\nas Dietary Data Collection. Participants reported all foods and\nbeverages consumed, except plain water, for the previous 24-h time\nin food recalls was based on the US Department of Agricul-\nture Survey Nutrient Databases (23). A number of quality-control\nmeasures were used to ensure the accuracy of food recalls. A\ndetailed description of dietary intake methodology was published\nelsewhere (20). For this study, the intakes of folate, iron, vitamin\ncure anemia.\nBlood measurements and assessment of anemia\nBlood was collected by venipuncture in the MECs according to\nstandard protocols. Whole blood was collected into EDTA-treated\ntubesforacompletebloodcountanalysis.Aquantitative,automated\nhematology analyzer was used to measure hemoglobin, hematocrit,\nandMCV(Coulter method).Thedetaileddescriptiononspecimen\nprocessing and laboratory methods was described elsewhere (24,\n25). Anemia was defined as having hemoglobin concentrations\n,13 g/dL for men and ,12 g/dL for women according to the\nWorld Health Organization criteria (26), and macrocytosis was\ndefined as having MCV values .98 fL for both men and women.\nStatistical analysis\nSUDAAN statistical software Windows (version 8.0.2; Re-\nsearch Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC) was used\nto account for complex survey design. Sample weights, primary\nsampling units, and stratification variables were considered in the\ndata analysis so that the differential probabilities of selection\nand adjustments for noncoverage and nonresponse bias were\naccounted for. We also used SAS for Windows (version 8.0; SAS\nInstitute Inc, Cary, NC) in conjunction with SUDAAN to manage\nand analyze the data files.\nIn the data analysis, final examined sample weights were used\nper NHANES guidelines (21). For the purpose of comparing data\nfrom before to after folic acid fortification, we concatenated\npercentages were estimated with the Taylor Series Linearization\nmethod. This method incorporates sample weights and accounts\nfor the complex survey design.\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nadjusted and univariate values for hemoglobin, hematocrit, and\nMCV and prevalence rates (%) for overall anemia and macro-\ncytosis were determined according to sex, race-ethnicity (NHW,\n!3.5), and vitamin/mineral supplement use (yes or no).

On the other hand, the\nprevalence of macrocytosis by and large remained the same in the\npostfortification period as in the prefortification period.\nFolic acid fortification has significantly increased serum folate\nand red blood cell folate in the United States (7\u00ad11). We reported\npreviously that the prevalence of low serum folate decreased\nfrom 18.4% in the prefortification period to 0.8% in the post-\nfortification period (7).

Given the remarkable improvement\nin folate status after folic acid fortification, one would expect the\nprevalence of macrocytosis to be lower in the postfortification\nperiod than in the prefortification period because folic acid cures\nfolate deficiency\u00adinduced macrocytosis. Folate deficiency\u00adinduced\nmacrocytosis is not common in the United States. The preva-\nlence of macrocytosis from folate deficiency accounts for 3% of\nall macrocytosis cases (28). The majority of the macrocytosis\ncases are related to drug treatment (methotrexate, mercaptopu-\nrine, 5-fluouracil, zidovudine, metformin, trimethoprim, sulfa-\nmethoxazole, valproic acid, etc), alcoholism, reticulocytosis,\nalcoholic andnonalcoholic liverdisease, hypothyroidism,multiple\nmyeloma, aplastic anemia, acute leukemia, and vitamin B-12 de-\nficiency(29,30).Thus,mandatedfolicacidfortificationisunlikely\nto have a significant impact on the prevalence of macrocytosis.\nWhat is remarkable is the 16\u00ad52% decrease we observed in the\nprevalence of overall anemia from the pre- to the postfortification\nperiod. The decreased prevalence of anemia was mostly observed\nin women. Additionally, in women, the odds of having anemia in\nthe postfortification period decreased by 36% relative to the\nprefortification period (P , 0.0001). Improved indexes of ane-\nmia and decreased prevalence of overall anemia in women could\npartly be attributed to improved folate status due to increased\nIndexes of anemia by sex, race-ethnicity, age, poverty:income ratio, and vitamin/mineral supplement use in National Health and Nutrition Examination\nHemoglobin Mean corpuscular volume\ng/dL fL\nMen\nRace-ethnicity\nAge\nPoverty:income ratio6\nVitamin/mineral supplement use7\nWomen\nRace-ethnicity\nAge\nPoverty:income ratio6\nVitamin/mineral supplement use7\n1 All values are means 6 SEMs; n \u00bc 26,596.

In men,\na slight and significant increase in hemoglobin from the pre- to the\npostfortification period translated into a marginally significant\nwhich suggests that most cases of anemia in men are of non-\nnutritional origin. Men in low socioeconomic strata and men who\ndid not consume supplements experienced a significant reduction\nin the prevalence of anemia from the pre- to the postfortification\nperiod (Table 3). In these specific men, as in women, it is possible\nthat the removal of folate deficiency is likely the explanation for\nthe lower prevalence of anemia in the postfortification period.\nBecause folic acid cures folate deficiency\u00adinduced macrocy-\ntosis, one would expect lower concentrations of MCV in the\npostfortification period than in the prefortification period. How-\never, we found no such decrease in MCV in women. On the other\nhand, in men, there was a significant increase in MCV, albeit\nslight. However, this increase in MCV in men did not result in the\nincreased prevalence of macrocytosis, which suggests that the\nchanges in MCV might have occurred within the normal range in\nThe observation of increased MCV in the postfortification\nperiod, especially in men and in older persons, is at odds with our\nearlier observation of lower MCVs in the postfortification period\nthan in the prefortification period in patients who received health\ncare in an urban institution (33). Difference in results between\nthis current study and our earlier study can be attributed to the\ndifferences in characteristics of subjects. In support of our cur-\nrent study findings, Hirsch et al (34) found an increase in MCV\nin older Chilean people from the pre- to the postfortification\nperiod. They concluded that increased MCV in the postforti-\nfication period may be due to continued vitamin B-12 deficiency.\nRecently, Morris et al (35), using NHANES data, found that\na high folate status was directly associated with anemia and\ncognitive impairment in older subjects with a low vitamin B-12\nstatus. We previously reported that the proportion of individuals\nwith low serum vitamin B-12 without macrocytosis was sig-\nnificantly higher in the postfortification period than in the pre-\nfortification period, which suggests a possible masking (delay in\ndiagnosis due to lack of anemia) of vitamin B-12 deficiency\n(35). However, Mills et al (36) found no masking of vitamin\nB-12 deficiency in patients who received care in a Veterans\nAffairs hospital. More recently, Selhub et al (37) provided\na possible biochemical explanation for the exacerbation of clini-\ncal manifestations of vitamin B-12 deficiency after high folic\nacid intakes. Oakley (38), in his editorial, called for\nAdjusted intakes of total folate, iron, vitamin B-6, and vitamin B-12 in\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANESs) 1988\u00ad\nFolic acid fortification period\nTotal folate (lg DFE)\nIron (mg)\nVitamin B-6 (mg)\nrace-ethnicity, age, poverty:income ratio, and vitamin/mineral supplement\nuse and were based on examined adults aged !19 y.

However, we cannot ascertain whether the increased\nMCV in men and in older persons was due to an exacerbation of\nhematologic symptoms associated with vitamin B-12 in-\nsufficiency because of the cross-sectional nature of the study.\nNonetheless, the cause of increased MCV in nontarget pop-\nulations, such as men in general and in older persons specifi-\ncally, warrants future study.\nIt is possible that differences in methods used to measure in-\ndexes of anemia may account for some of the differences we\nobserved between pre- and postfortification periods. This is un-\nlikely, however, because the methods used to measure indexes of\nanemia were largely consistent between fortification periods. It is\nimportant to note that each fortification period contained different\nsubjects with possibly different dietary behaviors. Dietary intakes\ncollected with the use of 24-h recalls are prone to measurement\nerror because of the participant's inability to recall the foods eaten\naccurately. Because of the cross-sectional nature of this study, the\nmeasurement of cause and effect was not possible.\nafter folic acid fortification was initiated, the changes we observed\nin indexes of anemia and in the prevalence of anemia may be\nattributable to the mandated folic acid fortification and increased\nuse of vitamin/mineral supplements, although other potential un-\nknown confounding factors cannot be ruled out. Folic acid forti-\nfication not only reduced the prevalence of NTDs as documented\npreviously (6), but it also indirectly improved indicators of anemia,\nwhich led a significant reduction in the prevalence of anemia in\ntarget population (an unintended benefit), which suggests much\nwider public health implications than just NTDs. Because un-\nmetabolized folic acid has been found in the circulation at a dose\nof 400 lg (39), folic acid status and its effects in both target and\nnontarget populations should be monitored on a regular basis.\nAlthough the prevalence of anemia was found to be significantly\nlower after the initiation than before the initiation of folic acid\nfortification, anemia continues to be a public health problem in\nwomen, specifically in NHB and MA/H, and in those with in-\ncomes below the poverty level.\nThe authors' responsibilities were as follows--VG: contributed to the\nstudy design and writing of the manuscript; MRK: contributed to the data\nacquisition, data management, and data analysis; and VG and MRK: contrib-\nuted to the interpretation of results, review, revision, and editing of the man-\nuscript.
