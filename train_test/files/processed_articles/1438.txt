Such studies are rare, and many\ncountries clearly lack epidemiologic data.\nThe past decade has seen numerous stud-\nies of the management and consequences\nof CMV infection during pregnancy, but\nmost of these studies were heterogeneous\nand based on small numbers of patients.\nMore recent studies have sought to eval-\nuate prevention strategies [2, 3] and treat-\nments [4, 5], whereas others have focused\non vaccine development [6]. Both options\nare important and certainly not mutually\nexclusive.\nBate et al [1] remind us, \"Compared\nwith a maternal nonprimary infection\n(i.e., reinfection or reactivation), a mater-\nnal primary infection is more likely to\ntransmit CMV from mother to fetus (1%\nReprints or correspondence: Dr Olivier Picone, Ho\n^pital\nAntoine Be\n\u00b4cle\nClamart, France (Olivier.picone@abc.aphp.fr).\n 2010 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

These rates are therefore dif-\nficult to compare. Although a diagnosis of\nprimary infection during pregnancy is re-\nliable, the diagnosis of recurrent infection\nis much more questionable. Most studies\nbase a diagnosis of recurrent infection on\nan increase of immunoglobulin (Ig) G\n(with high IgG avidity) or the presence of\nIgM antibodies or both. These findings\ncan also be found in other clinical situa-\ntions, such as nonspecific stimulation of\nthe immune system, maternal autoim-\nmune disorders, and other cross-reacting\nherpetic infections. In addition, in some\nstudies, CMV detection in urine or cer-\nvical samples in women who were CMV\nseropositive before pregnancy is also de-\nfined as recurrent infection [7, 8].\nAnother unresolved question about re-\ncurrent infections is whether transplacen-\ntal transmission of CMV in women with\npreexisting immunity is most often sec-\nondary to reactivation or to infection with\na different CMV strain during pregnancy.\nReactivation is the reappearance of the en-\ndogenous CMV strain acquired before\npregnancy and would be mainly local: in\nthe macrophages of the uterus [8], in the\ncervix, and in the kidneys, leading to ma-\nternal viruria. Such local reactivation is\nunlikely to be linked with maternal vire-\nmia. Unless reactivation occurs in the\nuterus, the risk of fetal infection appears\nhighly improbable. Reinfection, on the\nother hand, is infection with a new viral\nstrain. Reinfection is thought to lead to\nmaternal viremia and eventually to fetal\ninfection. In both cases (reactivation and\nreinfection), it is difficult to investigate the\nkinetics of humoral immune response.\nNovak et al [9] developed a novel ap-\nproach to diagnosis of reinfection based\non the appearance of new antibody spec-\nificity against at least 1 of 4 polymorphic\nepitopes designed from 2 prototypic lab-\noratory strains of CMV (AD169 and\nTowne). This procedure made it possible\nto show that reinfection with a different\nstrain of CMV can lead to intrauterine\ntransmission and symptomatic congenital\ninfection [10]. Investigators estimate the\nannual incidence rate of reinfection at\n10% in populations with a high CMV se-\nroprevalence, which are thus at high risk\nof CMV infection during pregnancy [11,\n12]. However, the recombinant antigens\ndescribed herein failed to detect up to one-\nthird of the CMV-seropositive individuals\nin their population, that is, up to one-third\nof CMV strains. Accordingly, they can give\nus only a general idea of the incidence of\nreinfections during pregnancy, but it is not\nknown how many women will have a re-\nactivation during pregnancy, how many\nwill have infected infants, and what the\nconsequences of this congenital infection\nwill be. Before we can learn these things,\nthe diagnosis of both reinfection and re-\nactivation during pregnancy must be im-\nproved, along with our understanding of\nthe mechanisms leading to intrauterine\nCMV transmission and congenital infec-\ntion in infants born to women with pre-\nexisting immunity.\nMaternal antibodies to CMV before\nconception provide substantial protection\nto the fetus against congenital damage\nfrom maternal infection [13]: primary\nmaternal infection during pregnancy is as-\nsociated with more severe sequelae of con-\ngenital CMV infection, even though the\nfrequency may not differ. A study of hear-\ning loss, for example, found the prevalence\nin children born to mothers with non-\nprimary infection (10%) was similar to\nthat in those with primary infection (11%)\nbut also that significantly more children\nin the primary infection group had pro-\ngressive and severe or profound hearing\nloss compared with children in the non-\nChild-to-mother CMV transmission in\nseronegative pregnant women with young\nchildren can probably be prevented by hy-\ngienic intervention [2, 3], and treatments\nare under evaluation for pregnant women\nwho have acquired a primary CMV in-\nfection during pregnancy (CMV hyper-\nimmune globulin, valacyclovir) [4, 5, 15].\nWhat kind of prevention is possible for\nthe population with a preconceptional\nCMV immunity? A vaccine is probably\nnot an effective option in this population.\nHygiene counseling and sexual advice dur-\ning pregnancy may well be the most cost-\neffective solution. Again, Bate et al [1]\nhave pertinent epidemiologic informa-\ntion. They describe the population at high\nrisk of developing CMV infection during\npregnancy, that is, nonwhite women with\nlow socioeconomic statuses and low ed-\nucation levels. They report that nearly all\nnon-Hispanic black women who are CMV\nseronegative during their teen years sero-\nconvert by the time they are in their 30s--\nthat is, still during the reproductive period.\nHowever, most congenital CMVinfections\nin the United States result from recurrent\ninfections among pregnant women. This\nproportion is likely to be even higher in\ncountries with higher CMV seropreva-\nlence. Therefore, all women would bene-\nfit from hygiene counseling throughout\npregnancy.\nRegardless of maternal immune sta-\ntus, CMV infection during pregnancy re-\nmains a global public health problem. All\nof the strategies discussed herein--hy-\ngiene counseling, new treatment, and vac-\ncine development--must be developed in\ncombination to decrease the burden of\nthis infection.\n"
