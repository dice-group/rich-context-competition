    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe Affordable Care Act (ACA) expanded Medicaid eligibility to adults with incomes under 138% of the federal poverty\nlevel, leading to substantial reductions in uninsured rates among low-income adults. Despite large gains in coverage, studies\nsuggest that Latinos may be less likely than other racial/ethnic groups to apply and enroll in health insurance, and they remain\nthe group with the highest uninsured rate in the United States. We explore two potential factors related to racial/ethnic\ndifferences in ACA enrollment--awareness of the law and receipt of application assistance such as navigator services. Using\nlower levels of awareness of the ACA relative to other groups, even after adjusting for demographic covariates. Higher\neducation was the strongest positive predictor of ACA awareness. In contrast, Latinos were much more likely to receive\nassistance from navigators or social workers when applying, relative to other racial/ethnic groups. Taken together, these\nresults highlight the importance of ACA outreach efforts to increase awareness among low-income and less educated\npopulations, two groups that are overrepresented in the Latino population, to close existing disparities in coverage.\n",

Hua2, and\nBenjamin D. Sommers, MD, Ph.D3\n Keywords\nAffordable Care Act, Hispanic health, Medicaid, navigators, disparities\nOriginal Research\nIntroduction\nStarting in 2014, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) expanded\nMedicaid eligibility to adults in participating states with\nincomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level (FPL).\nLevel of awareness of the ACA is a key predictor of whether\npeople apply for coverage.1 Despite significant outreach\nefforts, overall knowledge about the law remains poor\namong low-income and uninsured adults.2 Working with a\nnavigator or receiving other application assistance has been\nshown to be a major factor in improving enrollment rates.1\nMeanwhile, several studies have reported that Latinos may\nbe less likely to apply and enroll in health insurance under\nthe ACA, even though they remain the highest risk group to\nbe uninsured in the United States.3,4 Possible explanations\ninclude lower levels of health insurance literacy, language\nbarriers, and immigration status.5 Our objective was to\nexplore whether ACA awareness and receipt of application\nassistance differed across racial and ethnic groups among\nlow-income U.S. citizens in 3 Southern states with high\npre-ACA uninsured rates.\nMethods\nOur data come from a telephone survey of US citizens\nof FPL in Texas, Arkansas, and Kentucky. The survey was\nconducted in November and December 2014 on mobile\nand landline phones, and was available in English and\nSpanish. Survey estimates were weighted to Census demo-\ngraphic benchmarks for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education,\nmarital status, population density, and cell phone status;\ndetails of the survey have been published previously.6\nThe interview focused on respondents' awareness of and\nexperiences with the ACA.\n1Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA\n2University of Texas at Austin, USA\n3Harvard T.

The key vari-\nable of interest was race/ethnicity, in the following mutually\nexclusive categories: Latino, white non-Latino, black non-\nLatino, and Other (which included those reporting more than\none race or providing no response). We estimated differences\nby race/ethnicity after controlling for state, age, sex, educa-\ntion, income, rural versus urban residence, and whether the\nsurvey was completed in Spanish. We reported odds ratios and\npredicted probabilities associated with each covariate.\nResults\nTable 1 presents racial/ethnic differences in ACA awareness\nand use of application assistance. In the unadjusted model\n(n = 2794), Latinos had significantly lower awareness of the\nACA than whites (P = .007), and this difference remained\nhighly significant even after adjustment. Overall, Latinos\nhad the lowest level of awareness of the racial/ethnic groups\nin our sample, with only 38.5% having heard or read \"some\"\nor \"a lot\" about the ACA, compared with 48% for whites and\n46% for blacks, and 50.1% for Other. The fully adjusted\nmodel demonstrated that education was a much stronger\npredictor ofACAawareness than race/ethnicity. Respondents\nwho attended or graduated college had nearly a 20 percentage\npoint higher ACA awareness than respondents without high\nschool degrees.\nTable 1 also presents findings on the use of application\nassistance among applicants for Medicaid or Marketplace\ncoverage (n = 1107). The unadjusted model showed no\nsignificant differences in rates of application assistance by\nrace/ethnicity, but after adjustment, receipt of assistance was\n13 percentage points higher among Latinos than whites\n(P = .09). Kentucky and Arkansas respondents received\nthan respondents in Texas (28.7%).\nTable 1. Predictors of Awareness of the ACA and Application Assistance Among Low-Income Adults.\nVariable\nHeard or read a lot or some about the ACA\nReceived application assistance from\nnavigator/social worker\nUnadjusted Full model Unadjusted Full model\n% of sample OR\nPred. prob.\n(%) OR\nPred. prob.\n(%) % of sample OR\nPred. prob.\n(%) OR\nPred. prob.\n(%)\nRace/ethnicity\nState\nAge\nOther demographics\nEducation\nIncome\nNote. Total sample size = 2801. Analysis of ACA awareness excluded 7 individuals who chose not to answer that item (n = 2794). Only respondents who said they had applied\nfor Medicaid or marketplace coverage were asked whether they received application assistance (n = 1107). Unadjusted models controlled for race/ethnicity. Full models added\nstate of residence, age, gender, Spanish language survey, rural versus urban residence, education level, and income as covariates. We calculated predicted probabilities from the\nlogistic regression estimates using Stata's \"margins\" command with default settings, which holds all covariates at their actual values. ACA = Affordable Care Act; OR = odds\nratios from multivariate logistical regression; Pred. prob. = predicted probability; FPL = federal poverty level.\nGarcia Mosqueira et al 3\nGiven that language and ethnicity are highly correlated,\nwe tested the effect of excluding Spanish language as a\ncovariate. The results for Latino ethnicity were similar\n(awareness odds ratio [OR] = 0.73, P = .07; application\nassistance OR = 1.81, P = .05) to those in our full model.\nDiscussion\nIn our survey of low-income US citizens in 3 states, we found\nthat Latinos have significantly lower ACA awareness even\nafter adjusting for income and education. ACA awareness\nis the critical first step in improving uninsured rates among\nvulnerable populations, and our findings suggest that lack of\ninformation is a key barrier among Latinos.7 Somewhat sur-\nprisingly, language did not contribute to these informational\nbarriers in our study, as completing the survey in Spanish\nwas not a significant predictor of awareness. Education and\nrace/ethnicity were more important factors, suggesting the\nneed for targeted approaches that can reach individuals who\nmay have low levels of experience with the health care system.\nOur findings also suggest that application assistance can\nplay an important role in reducing racial/ethnic gaps in enroll-\nment rates.These results are consistent with previous research,\nespecially in the case of Latinos, who are the least likely to\napply for coverage, but simultaneously use assistance most\nheavily.3,8 Not surprisingly, Kentucky residents were more\nlikely to receive application assistance, given the state's\naggressive outreach efforts.9 However, navigators can only be\neffective after applicants seek assistance, and thus must\nalready be at least somewhat knowledgeable about the ACA.\nOur study has several limitations. We can only present cor-\nrelations between our covariates and outcome variables, as\nopposed to causal relationships. Furthermore, our sample's\nracial composition differs significantly between states: More\nthan 80% of the Latinos in our sample live in Texas, whereas\nother racial and ethnic groups were more evenly distributed,\nthough we adjusted directly for state of residence in our analy-\nsis. Our study also focused exclusively on those reporting US\ncitizenship and did not ask about the legal status of other\nhousehold members. This means our results are not due to dif-\nferences in eligibility for public coverage due to immigration\nstatus among survey respondents. However, having family\nmembers with undocumented status can reduce coverage rates\namong legal immigrants and US citizens, and our data set\ndid not allow us to explore this important issue. Finally, our\nresponse rate of 26% may be subject to non-response bias,\nthough we weighted to appropriate population benchmarks,\nwhich research shows can mitigate this potential bias.10\nIn conclusion, despite abundant research pointing to\nlarge drops in uninsured rates associated with the ACA and\nMedicaid expansion,2,11-13 disparities remain for Latinos.\nOur results highlight the need to target outreach efforts to\nlow-income adults with less education--a group with a\ndisproportionately high number of Latinos--to close gaps\ninACAawareness and, ultimately, health insurance coverage\nrates.\nAuthors' Note\nDr. Sommers currently serves part-time as an advisor in the Office\nof the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, at the U.S.\nDepartment of Health and Human Services.The views presented\nhere are those of the authors and do not represent U.S. Department\nof Health and Human Services, Agency for Healthcare Research\nand Quality, or the Commonwealth Fund.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This\nproject was supported by a research grant from the Commonwealth\nFund.
