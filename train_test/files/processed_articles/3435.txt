Postoperative analgesia is\nrequired to achieve patient comfort, stable\nhaemodynamics and postoperative rehabili-\ntation.3 Analgesia with opioids alone can\ncause side-effects such as respiratory depres-\nsion, sedation, urinary retention and\nnausea.4 Since opioids have limited anal-\ngesic potency, it has been suggested that\ndrug combinations might improve analgesia\nand limit the occurrence and severity of side-\neffects.5 Studies have consistently demon-\nstrated a 30\u00ad40% decrease in postoperative\nopioid consumption when nefopam is used\nfollowing abdominal or orthopaedic sur-\ngery.6,7 Unlike nonsteroidal anti-inflamma-\ntory drugs, nefopam has no effect on platelet\nfunction,8 and (in contrast to opioids) does\nnot increase the risk of respiratory depres-\nsion.9 In addition, nefopam has been shown\nto result in decreased morphine consump-\ntion when used as a coanalgesic following\nabdominal surgery.10\nThe efficacy and safety of nefopam have\nnot been proven in patients undergoing\ncardiac surgery. In addition, to the best of\nour knowledge there are no studies report-\ning on the use of nefopam as the sole\nanalgesic after cardiac surgery. The aim of\nthis prospective, randomized, double-blind\nstudy, therefore, was to investigate the\nefficacy and side-effects of nefopam both\nas a sole analgesic and as an adjuvant\nanalgesic in support of fentanyl for\npatient-controlled analgesia (PCA) after\ncardiac surgery.\nPatients and methods\nStudy population\nThe study enrolled patients aged !20 years\nwith ASA physical status I\u00adIII,11 scheduled\nto undergo cardiac surgery in the\nDepartment of Anaesthesia and Pain\nMedicine, Asan Medical Centre, Seoul,\nJanuary 2012. Exclusion criteria were: emer-\ngency surgery; failure to give informed con-\nsent; reduced left ventricular function\n(ejection fraction <40%); history of allergy\nto study drugs; use of monoamine oxidase\ninhibitors; active seizure or history of seiz-\nure; glaucoma; high risk of urinary retention\n(i.e., urethral or prostate disease); severe\nrenal or hepatic disease; critical pulmonary\ndisease or history of respiratory disease;\ntachyarrhythmia or surgery for arrhythmia.\nPatients were assigned to one of three PCA\ngroups using a randomization plan gener-\nator (available at http://\nwww.Randomization.com/): nefopam only;\nfentanyl only; nefopam \u00fe fentanyl\nThe Asan Medical Centre Institutional\nReview Board, Seoul, Republic of Korea\napproved the study. Ad all patients provided\nwritten informed consent prior to\nenrolment.\nAnaesthesia\nIn all patients, anaesthesia was induced\nusing 0.2 mg/kg etomidate, 0.6 mg/kg rocur-\nonium and 20.0 ng/ml effective site concen-\ntration remifentanil via target-controlled\ninfusion (Minto pharmacokinetic model12).\nAnaesthesia was maintained with propofol\nand remifentanil using the Orchestra\u00d5 Base\nPrimea target-controlled infusion system\n(Fresinius Kabi, Bad Homburg, Germany).\nDuring surgery, volume-controlled ventila-\ntion was performed and systemic arterial\npressure, central venous pressure and car-\ndiac output were monitored.\nPCA\nBased on the findings of others,13 the present\nstudy used a basal fentanyl PCA infusion\nrate of 20 mg/h, with a bolus demand dose of\n10 mg/15 min and maximal hourly infusion\ndose of 60 mg. The analgesic effect of 20 mg\nnefopam has been shown to equal that of\n6\u00ad12 mg morphine at a continuous basal\nPCA dose of 2 mg/h.14 Therefore our study\nused a basal nefopam PCA infusion dose of\n4 mg/h, with a bolus demand dose of 2 mg/\n15 min and maximal hourly dose of 12 mg.\nThe PCA was initiated postoperatively in\na double-blind manner by an anaesthetist.\nThe total drug volume was 150 ml/patient.\nPatients in the nefopam group received\n300 mg nefopam (2 mg/ml, infused continu-\nously at 4 mg/h) and 0.6 mg ramosetron (to\nprevent nausea). Patients in the fentanyl\ninfused continuously at 20 mg/h) with 0.6 mg\nramosetron. Patients in the nefopam\u00fefen-\ntanyl group received 140 mg nefopam\n(0.93 mg/ml, infused continuously at\ninfused continuously at 9.4 mg/h) and 0.6 mg\nramosetron. Drugs were infused at 2 ml/h\nSeoul, Republic of Korea), with a patient-\ncontrolled bolus injection volume of 1 ml.\nThe lock out time was set to 15 min to\nprotect against overdose. The maximal infu-\nsion volume was 6 ml per h.\nPain was assessed using a visual analogue\nsurgery, both at rest (VASR\n) and during\nmovement (VASM\n). Tachycardia, sweating,\nsedation, respiratory depression, itching,\nnausea and vomiting were noted during the\nfirst 48 h postoperatively. The total PCA\nvolume and number of rescue drug injec-\npostoperatively. Duration of intubation and\nlength of stay in the intensive care unit\n(ICU) were noted.\nSample size\nSince the aim of the study was to test the\nnoninferiority of nefopam to fentanyl, VAS\nat 24 h postoperatively was chosen as the\nprimary endpoint. The required number of\nsubjects per group was calculated from the\nexpression:\nn \u00bc\n\u00fe Z\nwhere 1 was 2.2 (mean VAS of fentanyl\ngroup in a pilot study), 2 was 2.9, (mean\nVAS of nefopam group in a pilot study), the\nnoninferiority margin () was 1.5 (the largest\nchange from the reference value considered\nand  was 1.66 (the pooled variance). Based\non this calculation and assuming a 10%\ndropout rate, the study required 100 patients\nper group. Criteria for exclusion from final\nanalysis were: postoperative duration of\nintubation !48 h; repeat surgery within\n72 h; reintubation in ICU; and malfunction-\ning PCA device.\nStatistical analyses\nData were expressed as mean \u00c6 SD or n (%).\nDemographic data were compared using\nKruskal\u00adWallis test for continuous vari-\nables and 2-test for categorical variables.\nBetween-group comparisons of side-effects\nwere performed using 2-test or Fisher's\nexact test, and multiple comparisons were\nperformed using 2-test or Fisher's exact test\nwith Bonferroni correction. Between-group\ncomparisons of extubation time and dur-\nation of ICU stay were made using Kruskal\u00ad\nWallis test. Total PCA volume and number\n48 h were compared using repeated meas-\nures analysis of variance followed by post\nhoc test to assess significance between two\ngroups. A linear mixed model was used to\ncompare simultaneous VAS values, to\naccount for correlations between repeated\nobservations. The noninferiority of nefopam\nto fentanyl was analysed using 95% confi-\ndence intervals (CI) for the difference in\nVAS (2\u00c01, as above). Noninferiority was\nconfirmed when the upper 95% CI was less\nthan the noninferiority margin ( \u00bc 1.5). All\nstatistical analyses were performed with\nSPSS\u00d5 version 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago,\nIL, USA) for Windows\u00d5. P-values <0.05\nwere considered statistically significant.\nResults\nrange 20\u00ad83 years). Reasons for noncomple-\ntion were: postoperative duration of intub-\nation !48 h (n \u00bc 11); repeat surgery within\n72 h (n \u00bc 5); reintubation in ICU (n \u00bc 4);\nmalfunctioning PCA device (n \u00bc 4).

This is in contrast with others\nwho reported that sweating was more\ncommon in patients given nefopam than\npropacetemol or morphine.7 All patients in\nthe present study were admitted to the ICU\nfollowing surgery and some were infused\nwith inotropic agents or vasopressors,\naccording to need. As these sympatho-\nmimetic drugs can mask the effects of\nnefopam,23 the vital signs, respiratory\neffort and hepatorenal functions of every\npatient in the present study were closely\nobserved while they were in the ICU. It was\ntherefore not relevant that the sympatho-\nmimetic action of nefopam renders it contra-\nindicated for patients with limited coronary\nreserves3 since it was possible to detect any\nearly signs of unstable haemodynamics,\nsuch as tachycardia and sweating.\nThe nonopioid nature of nefopam sug-\ngests that it would result in fewer side-effects\n(such as sedation or respiratory depression)\ncompared with opioids. The frequencies of\nsedation and respiratory depression were\nsimilar in all groups in the present study,\nhowever. This may be explained by the\ncumulative effect of the opioids used\nduring general anaesthesia; in addition, the\nsurgical procedure itself may have contrib-\nuted to these side-effects. A low incidence of\nsedation due to nefopam was also reported\nNefopam was associated with a lower\nincidence of nausea than fentanyl, in the\npresent study. It has been reported that 10\u00ad\n30% of patients given a low dose of nefopam\nexperience nausea, usually after its first\nadministration.25 Nefopam may affect the\nincidence of nausea by modulating chemical\nmediators such as serotonin.\nThe present data indicate that nefopam\nhas a favourable safety profile in relation to\nmany systemic organs of patients who\nundergo cardiac surgery. It did not cause\nhaemorrhagic complications at the usual\ndose.8 Life-threatening effects have been\nreported in relation to nefopam overdose,\nhowever, including rare fatal overdoses\ncharacterized by convulsions and arrhyth-\nreported in a 77-year-old man who devel-\noped acute neurological impairment and\nrenal failure.28 Overdose was unlikely in\nthe present study, however, since a low dose\nwas used and all patients were closely\nobserved in the ICU after surgery.\nThe present study has some limitations. A\ndose of 20 mg nefopam has been shown to be\nfentanyl equivalent is not known. The study\ntherefore employed the usual analgesic dose\nof nefopam. Since the focus of the study was\non pain control rather than the physical\nstatus of the patients, we used the same drug\ndose for each patient regardless of their\nweight. ICU care with mechanical ventila-\ntion and sedation or inotropic and vaso-\nactive agents could mask the effect of\nnefopam. In addition, we did not study the\nlong-term effects of nefopam (e.g. duration\nof hospital stay) or its cost effectiveness. A\nlong term multicentre study is needed.\nIn conclusion, the present study indicates\nthat nefopam is effective for patients who\nhave undergone cardiac surgery, and PCA\nwith nefopam alone provides suitable post-\noperative analgesia after cardiac surgery.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThis study was funded by Pharmbio, who are the\nmanufacturers of nefopam.\nFunding\nThis study was supported by a grant from Asan\nCommissioned by Pharmbio Pharmaceutical,\nCo, Ltd).\nReferences\n1.
