This study\nis one of the largest genetic studies of IgAN (n = 237) and\ninvolved the longest observational period (9.9 \u00b1 4.2 years),\nthus providing pivotal information for establishing a thera-\npeutic strategy of RAS blockade in IgAN patients.\nMaterials and methods\nParticipants\nGenetic and clinical data of 237 IgAN patients included in\nthe present study were derived from our previous study,\nPolymorphism REsearch to DIstinguish genetic factors\nContributing To progression of IgA Nephropathy\nnosed with IgAN by kidney biopsy at the Osaka University\nHospital, Osaka General Medical Center and Osaka Rosai\nHospital in the Osaka prefecture, Japan. Among 482\npatients who visited these hospitals between April 2006\nmerular filtration rate (eGFR), 40 patients with RAS\nblockade (ACEIs (n = 31) and ARBs (n = 10)) at kidney\nbiopsy were excluded, because RAS blockade at kidney\nbiopsy might influence baseline prognostic confounders\nand potentially lead to the biased estimates of associations\nbetween RAS blockade and IgAN progression (prevalent\nuser bias).23 After excluding one patient with malignant\nhypertension at kidney biopsy and six patients with miss-\ning baseline data, a final 237 IgAN patients were enrolled\nin the present study. The study protocol was approved by\nthe ethical committee of Osaka University, Osaka General\nMedical Center and Osaka Rosai Hospital.\nMeasurements\nBased on previous genetic studies of RAS-related gene\npolymorphisms, we selected three major RAS-related gene\npolymorphisms as possible predictors of the renoprotective\ncollected at kidney biopsy included age, gender, smoking\nstatus, mean arterial pressure (diastolic blood pressure +\n[systolic blood pressure \u00ad diastolic blood pressure]/3),\nhypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure  130\nmmHg, diastolic blood pressure  80 mmHg or use of anti-\nhypertensive agents including calcium channel blockers,\n-blockers, -blockers and thiazides), serum creatinine\nlevel, eGFR based on the Japanese equation (eGFR (ml/\nand urinary occult blood. The values of eGFR and urinary\nues of urinary occult blood were measured using dipstick\nand were stratified into three categories (negative or trace,\n1+ or 2+ and 3+ or more). Smoking status was based on a\nquestionnaire completed at admission for kidney biopsy.27\nNonsmokers and past smokers were combined into a single\ncategory (non- or past smokers) because the number of past\nsmokers was very small (n = 7). Therapeutic interventions\nassessed were RAS blockade, including use of ACEIs and/\nor ARBs, and use of immunosuppressants, including corti-\ncosteroids and other immunosuppressive agents. As long-\nterm survivors might have more opportunities to receive\ntherapeutic interventions in an observational study, thus\npotentially biasing their effectiveness (survivor treatment\nselection bias),28,29 we confined the therapeutic interven-\ntions to those initiated within one year of kidney biopsy.\nThe observational period was defined as the time from\nkidney biopsy to incidence of ESRD or the last measure-\nment of the serum creatinine level before September 2009,\nwhichever came first. The study outcomes were an irre-\nversible 50% increase in the serum creatinine level at kid-\nney biopsy and the slope of eGFR (ml/min/1.73 m2 per\nyear), which was calculated based on serum creatinine lev-\nels at kidney biopsy and the end of the observational\nperiod. To clarify the clinical course of blood pressure and\nurinary protein after initiating RAS blockade, we assessed\nblood pressure and dipstick urinary protein at one and two\nyears after kidney biopsy. Measurements closest to year 1\nand 2 within a caliper width of 60 days were collected.\nStatistics\nClinical characteristics of patients with and without RAS\nblockade within one year of kidney biopsy and clinical\ncourses of blood pressure and dipstick urinary protein\nwithin two years of kidney biopsy were compared using\nthe Student's t test, Wilcoxon's rank sum test and 2 test as\nappropriate. Genotype frequencies of three polymorphisms\nin the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were compared\nbetween the patients with and without RAS blockade, by\nusing the 2 test. Each gene polymorphism had three geno-\ntypes: major homozygote, heterozygote and minor\nhomozygote. The associations between each polymor-\nphism and the outcomes were examined using dominant\nmodels (homozygote of nonrisk allele vs heterozygote/\nhomozygote of risk allele) and recessive models (homozy-\ngote of risk allele vs heterozygote/homozygote of nonrisk\nallele). Based on previous studies, we classified the fol-\nlowing as risk alleles: ACE D allele of ACE I/D,30\u00ad32 C\ndid not analyze dominant or recessive models with <10%\nfrequencies of minor homozygotes because a small sample\nsize would hinder any meaningful statistical analysis.\nGenetic predictor of IgAN progression were identified\nusing facility-adjusted Cox proportional-hazards (CPH)\nmodels and multivariate CPH models adjusting for facility\nand clinically relevant factors. To identify genetic predic-\ntors of the renoprotective effectiveness of RAS blockade,\nwe examined the effect modification between each RAS-\nrelated gene polymorphism and RAS blockade in a multi-\nvariate CPH model. Because a test for interaction is\ngenerally conservative, p for interaction <0.1 was regarded\nas statistically significant.33 To clarify the effect modifica-\ntion, patients were classified into four categories based on\ngene polymorphisms, and RAS blockade and their hazard\nratios were calculated in multivariate CPH models. As a\nsensitivity analysis, the effect modifications of each gene\npolymorphism and RAS blockade were examined using\nmultivariate linear regression model with the slope of\neGFR as the outcome.\nNormally distributed continuous variables were\nexpressed as mean \u00b1 SD, and non-normally distributed\ncontinuous variables were expressed as median (interquar-\ntile range). Categorical variables were expressed as num-\nber (proportion). Statistical significance was defined as\np < 0.05, if not specified. All statistical analyses were per-\nformed using STATA version 11 (STATA Corp., College\nStation, TX, USA).\nResults\nThe baseline characteristics of 237 IgAN patients are pre-\nsented in Table 1.

A significant interaction was observed in a recessive\nmodel of ACE I/D polymorphism (p for ACE DD * RAS\nblockade = 0.087) but not in other models (Table 3). To\nclarify the effect modification between ACE I/D and RAS\nblockade, patients were categorized into four groups based\non ACE I/D and RAS blockade (Figure 1). The hazard\nratio of ACE DD patients with RAS blockade was remark-\nably lower than that of ACE DD patients without RAS\nblockade; however, this trend was not observed in ACE\nID/II patients (ACE ID/II without RAS blockade as a refer-\nhalved the risk of a 50% increase in serum creatinine level\nin ACE DD patients, whereas it did not in ACE ID/II\npatients.\nA sensitivity analysis effect modification between ACE\nI/D and RAS blockade was also ascertained, with the slope\nof eGFR as the outcome.

A similar effect modi-\nfication was observed in the multivariate linear regression\nmodel (Figure 1(b)).\nSimilar effect modification between ACE I/D polymor-\nphism and RAS blockade was observed in dipstick urinary\nprotein within two years of kidney biopsy (Figure 2). At\none year after kidney biopsy, the proportion of negative or\ntrace urinary protein of ACE DD patients with RAS block-\nade was significantly higher than that of ACE DD patients\ntwo years after kidney biopsy, proportions of negative or\ntrace urinary protein and also 1+ of urinary protein were\nsignificantly different between ACE DD patients with\nRAS blockade and those without RAS blockade (negative\nsix (33.3%) patients without RAS blockade within one\nyear of kidney biopsy received RAS blockade two years\nafter kidney biopsy.

Compared with ACE\nII/ID patients, ACE DD patients were at higher risk of\nIgAN progression and RAS blockade halved their risk,\nmitigating their genetic disadvantage (Figure 1). These\nfindings suggest that ACE I/D is a potentially useful\nmarker to identify patients who will clinically benefit from\nRAS blockade. Compared with the previous studies assess-\ning the associations between RAS-related gene polymor-\nphisms and IgAN progression, this study is the third largest\ngenetic study with 237 IgAN patients, following two larger\ntional period (9.9 \u00b1 4.2 years). Furthermore, we performed\na comparative assessment of three major RAS-related\ngene polymorphisms and carefully controlled for several\nTable 2.

One exception was the largest genetic\nstudy by Suzuki and colleagues, which included 527\npatients with IgAN.34 Their study found that ACE I/D\nwas not associated with the composite outcome of 100%\nincrease in serum creatinine level or ESRD in all patients\n(n = 527) as well as in patients without RAS blockade\nduring the entire observational period (n = 333), suggest-\ning that ACE I/D did not modify the renoprotective effect\nof RAS blockade. In contrast, the present study revealed\nthat RAS blockade remarkably improved renal prognosis\nin ACE DD patients, but not in ACE II/ID patients\n(Figure 1). These conflicting results may be owing to\nseveral biases such as the prevalent user bias23 and survi-\nvor treatment bias,28,29 which were deliberately controlled\nin our study. Interestingly, a randomized controlled trial,\nthe Ramipril Efficacy in Nephropathy (REIN) study,\nincluding mostly nondiabetic proteinuric patients,\ndescribed an effect modification between ACE I/D and\nRAS blockade similar to the present study.38 The inci-\ndence of ESRD was significantly suppressed by ramipril\nin ACE DD patients, but not in II/ID patients, which cor-\nroborates our study findings.\nThe present study clarified that RAS blockade exerted a\nrenoprotective effect in ACE DD patients, but not in ID/II\npatients. ACE I/D affects the level of circulating and tissue\nACE.39 Serum ACE level was higher in ACE DD subjects\ncompared with ID/II subjects.17,18 Furthermore, the local\nexpression of ACE in T-lymphocytes40 and cardiac tissue19\nwere higher in ACE DD subjects compared with ID/II sub-\njects. A Japanese study of 50 healthy kidney donors\nrevealed that tubular and glomerular ACE messengerRNA\n(mRNA) signals measured using in situ hybridization were\nhigher in ACE DD subjects than in ID/II subjects,41 indi-\ncating that intrarenal RAS was more activated in DD\npatients compared to ID/II patients. Although its precise\nbiological mechanism remains unknown, a recent study\nreported that ACE I/D regulated the transcriptional activity\nof ACE promoters,42 providing new insight into the direct\ninfluence of ACE I/D on ACE activity. Therefore, ACE DD\npatients, who likely have higher activity of intrarenal RAS,\nmight reap more renoprotective benefits from RAS block-\nade, compared to ID/II patients, as evidenced in the pre-\nsent study and REIN study.\nThe present study had several limitations. First,\nindication of RAS blockade was dependent on each\nphysician and RAS blockade was not uniform in the\npresent study because of its observational study design.\nFigure 3. Mean arterial pressure at kidney biopsy and one and two years after kidney biopsy. No significant difference was\nobserved between the patients with RAS blockade and those without RAS blockade at one and two years after kidney biopsy in\nACE DD and II/ID patients, although ACE ID/II patients with RAS blockade had higher mean arterial pressure, compared with those\nRAS: renin-angiotensin system; ACE: angiotensin-converting enzyme; I: insertion; D: deletion. *<0.05, RAS blockade vs no RAS blockade.\n640 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(3)\nNevertheless, our results were compatible with the\nREIN study,38 which is the largest randomized control\ntrial assessing the efficacy of RAS blockade mainly in\nnondiabetic proteinuric patients. The similar findings\nsupport the validity of the present study. Second, minor\nwere too small to examine their clinical impact on\neffectiveness of RAS blockade. A larger cohort is\nessential for further investigation. Third, our study\nused the candidate gene approach and examined only\none of a large number of gene polymorphisms in ACE.\nA previous study of 267 IgAN patients reported an\neffect modification between ACE A2350G and RAS\nblockade, though this was not ascertained in a multi-\nvariate model adjusting for clinically relevant factors.35\nA broader investigation of RAS-related gene polymor-\nphisms is required to identify genetic predictors of the\nrenoprotective effect of RAS blockade. Fourth, the pre-\nsent study assessed the associations between RAS\nblockade and RAS-related gene polymorphisms but did\nnot measure systemic or intrarenal RAS activity. The\nprecise biological mechanism of effect modification\nbetween the renoprotective effect of RAS blockade\nand ACE I/D-dependent RAS activity needs further\nclarification. Fifth, a lack of information on the histo-\npathological lesion, one of the conventional prognostic\nfactors, might affect the results of the present study. A\nslightly higher hazard ratio and lower  coefficient of\nACE ID/II with RAS blockade compared with ID/II\nwithout RAS blockade might be due to the unmeasured\nhistopathological lesion (confounding by indication).\nConclusions\nThe present study clarified that ACE I/D predicted renal\noutcomes and the renoprotective effectiveness of RAS\nblockade in IgAN patients. Recognition of ACE I/D poten-\ntially provides pivotal information for treatment optimiza-\ntion to prevent further progression of IgAN. Further studies\nare required to establish a therapeutic strategy based on\nboth genetic and clinical evidence.\n"
