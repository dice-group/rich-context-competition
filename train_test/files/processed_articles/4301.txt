A\nmajor component of the Lower Secondary Science course is\ndesigned around developing inquiry through engaging in sci-\nentific investigations and processes (Ministry of Education,\nSingapore, 2012). Besides engaging in hands-on science\nlaboratory work, most pen-and-paper science questions are\ncrafted along experiments (Figure 1).\nA core facet of science is the ability to construct explana-\ntions from interpreting evidences or texts and assessing\nclaims (Driver, Newton, & Osborne, 2000). The ability to\nderive proper scientific explanations encompasses the goal\nof inquiry learning because it involves understanding the\nphenomena and convincing others of the same understanding\n(Sandoval & Reiser, 2004). Students' engagement in con-\nstruction of scientific explanation may promote a positive\noutlook on science as well as increase their understanding of\nWe noticed that our lower secondary students find it chal-\nlenging to interpret experimental data. Generally, students\nhave a few challenges in answering data-based questions: (a)\ninability to describe the data (Figure 2) and (b) inability to\ninfer and interpret the data (Figure 3).\nFor the first challenge (Figure 2), our students tend to\ngeneralize loosely and prematurely in their written answers.\nMost students fail to put in effort to describe the pattern(s)\noffered by the data in a given question (Sandoval, 2003).\nInstead of using the data provided, students often rely on\ntheir personal views, textbook knowledge, and beliefs to\ndraw conclusions (Hogan & Maglienti, 2001). For instance,\nas depicted in Figure 2, the student answered by using\n\"affects\" to describe the effect of increasing water tempera-\nture on the amount of solute that can be dissolved in the\nwater without clear mention of what exactly the effect was.\nIn the case of the second challenge, our students were\nunable to understand the intention of the data. As illustrated\nin Figure 3, the student was neither able to provide a reason-\ning nor make a reference to a taught theory; the student failed\n1Pasir Ris Secondary School, Singapore\nCorresponding Author:\nDeborah Goh, Pasir Ris Secondary School, 390 Tampines Street 21,\nEmail: deborah.hh.goh@gmail.com\nExpanded Understandings of the\nConnective Approach in Helping\nStudents Construct Scientific\nExplanations\nDeborah Goh1\n Keywords\nconnective approach, ontology, epistemology, logic, social constructivism\n2 SAGE Open\nto link the question to the concept of air pressure in the inner\nand outer ear. As pointed out by Chinn and Brewer (2001),\nour students' understanding of content knowledge and data\nevidence in question affects whether they are able to provide\nappropriate evidence for a particular task. Students are also\nlikely to ignore data that contradict the theoretical knowl-\nedge they already know, and they are more likely to take data\ninto account if they can visualize the concept behind the data\npattern. Therefore, the need for stronger content knowledge\nand exposure to data patterns may help students improve\ntheir understanding for the underlying intention of a given\nscience question.\nScaffolding, as described by Wood, Bruner, and Ross\n(1976), consists of an adult manipulating the elements of\ntask that are beyond the learner's ability, so that the learner is\nable to focus on and achieve competence in the fundamentals\nwithin his or her capacity. A number of researchers (Brown\nthat scaffolding allows learners to reach a higher level of\nunderstanding for task within their zone of proximal devel-\nopment (ZPD). According to Vygotsky's (1978) theory, the\nZPD defines the area where a learner is able to solve prob-\nlems independently and attain a potential level of problem-\nsolving capabilities with guidance. For a scaffold to serve its\nfunction well, it should reside within the learner's ZPD. If\nthe scaffold provides too much assistance, the learner will\nnot be challenged to inquire more. Hence, the scaffold should\nprovide just enough assistance so that the learner will be able\nto progress independently and achieve a higher level of\nIn the past, we have tried to explain the answering of\nexperimental-based questions on a question-by-question\nbasis. This may have led to some students memorizing\nanswers to specific questions. There are studies indicating\nthat the ability to craft scientific explanations does not come\nnaturally to most individuals; instead, it is mostly assimilated\nthrough practice (Osborne, Erduran, & Simon, 2004).\nTherefore, students should be explicitly taught the skill on\nhow to craft accurate scientific explanations, and this should\nbe practiced regularly in science lessons.\nConnective Approach in Construction\nof Scientific Explanations\nThe connective approach is developed by Sir Peter Strawson,\nemeritus professor of philosophy at Oxford University, as an\neffective way to understand the fundamental structure of\nhuman thinking in the field of analytical philosophy. At the\nheart of the connective approach are the three distinct dimen-\nsions of ontology, epistemology, and logic (Strawson, 1992;\nby Strawson (1992) as the three dimensions of a unified\nenquiry. Figure 4 shows how epistemology, ontology, and\nlogic can be represented.\nThe meaning of the three dimensions is described by Tay\nOntology [sic] is defined by Reber (1995) and Zuber-Skerritt\n(2001) as an aspect of metaphysical inquiry concerned with the\nquestion of existence apart from specific objects and events. It is\nFigure 1. Example of pen and paper science question.\none's assumptions about the nature of being and reality. As\npointed out by Nita (1999), ontology takes on two meanings.\nThe first meaning takes reference to the real world, where\nexperience is characterized in terms of what is \"out there.\" The\nsecond meaning includes belief in the existence of the things in\nquestion such that these things are separated and related in time\nand space. (p. 2)\nEpistemology [sic] is defined by Reber (1995) and Zuber-\nSkerritt (2001) as the branch of philosophy that is concerned\nwith the origins, nature, methods and limits of human knowledge.\nIt is our assumptions about the nature of knowledge and\nknowing. As pointed out by Nita (1999), epistemology is either\nsomething objective, to be accumulated independently of the\nperceptions of any particular observer or something subjective,\na product created by the observer. In other words, epistemology\nis the use of concepts in judgement or belief. It refers to the\npersonal and subjective phenomenon. The experience is\ncharacterized in terms of what is \"in the head\" of humans. (p. 2)\nIn Strawson's view [sic], logic is the study of the general forms\nof the proposition and of their relations of logical dependence\nand independence. It has no concern with the internal structure\nof uncompounded propositions that enter into its compounds.\nIt has nothing to say about the content of logically simple\npropositions. It has nothing to do with an ontological order.\nAccording to Bench-Capon (1990), the main concern of logic\nis with the soundness and unsoundness of arguments. Its goal\nis to represent an argument in such a way that it will be\nuncontroversial as to whether that argument is acceptable or\nnot. (p. 3)\nThe above literature prompts us to develop an adopted\ncollective approach consisting of aspects to the three\ndomains: ontology, epistemology, and logic. The ontological\ndimension can be represented by experiential focal lessons.\nThe epistemological dimension can be represented by the set\nof pre-requisite knowledge taught to students in class. The\nlogic dimension refers to the instructional method to scaffold\nstudents in crafting scientific explanations.\nIn addition, as pointed out by Strawson (1992), the con-\ncepts to be included in the connective approach must be\nhighly general, irreducible, and non-contingent.\nFigure 4. Connective approach.\nFigure 2. Generalization in describing data.\nFigure 3. Inability to understand intention of data provided.\n4 SAGE Open\nand Tay (2003) as a judgment or decision that is applicable to\nan entire class or category of objects, events, or phenomena.\nFor example, the word \"flower\" can be used as a general\nterm to refer to the bud, the stalk, the leaves, and the root.\nThe three dimensions adopted in this research study are gen-\neral in nature. The experiential \"Focal Lesson\" is based on\nthe general theory of being. It applies the notion of ontology\nby ensuring all its phenomena take reference to the real\nworld. All the phenomena observed by students must be\nfound in the physical setting associated with that focal les-\nson. The set of pre-requisite knowledge adopts the general\ntheory of knowledge. It represents the collective body of\ninformation where students can use the underlying nouns,\nverbs, phrases, or sentences to construct their concepts or\nexplanations. The instructional method uses the general the-\nory of proposition. It is concerned with what is true or false.\nSecond, as pointed out by Tay (2003), the term \"irreduc-\nibility\" does not mean or imply \"simple.\" A concept may be\ncomplex, in the sense that its elucidation requires the estab-\nlishment of its connections with other concepts. At the same\ntime, it is also irreducible, in the sense that it cannot be\ndefined away, without circularity, in terms of those other\nconcepts to which it is necessarily related. All the three\ndimensions in this research study are irreducible. This is\nbased on the fact that against judgments or beliefs derived\nfrom pre-requisite knowledge is the natural world or the\nphysical setting associated with a respective focal lesson to\nwhich the judgments or beliefs relate. To determine whether\nthe judgments or beliefs are true or false, the instructional\nmethod is required by students to process the states gathered\nfrom the relations of judgments or beliefs derived from pre-\nrequisite knowledge with that of the natural world associated\nwith the focal lesson.\nThird, the term \"non-contingency\" is defined by Reber\nan event. It is considered to be the learned response of a bond\nbetween that response and stimulus. It occurs independently\nof any behavior. It has a role to play in the development and\nmaintenance of that behavior. Beyond that, the very concept\nof experience itself would be lost. The adopted three dimen-\nsions are non-contingent. Each element contains a distinct\nfeature that is non-contingent. The focal lesson is concerned\nwith things that are \"out there.\" A pre-requisite knowledge is\nconcerned with things that are \"in the heads\" of humans. The\ninstructional method is only concerned with the reasoning\nprocess. It interprets neither the content of the things in a\nfocal lesson nor the concepts derived from pre-requisite\nknowledge.\nTherefore, during the processing of applying our derived\napproach, the students traverse through an elaborate network\nof connected objects and concepts that enables students to\nconstruct an explanation concisely and comprehensively and\nalso to be able to interpret observed phenomena systemically\nand at higher level of complexity.\nThis article focuses on the feasibility of implementing the\nconnective approach in helping lower secondary science stu-\ndents construct scientific explanations for experimental-based\nquestions in science. The concepts and theories relevant to\nthis study are presented in the following sections:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Derivation of Scaffolding Strategy\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Intervention of Scaffolding Strategy\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Data Collection and Interpretation\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Expanded Understandings of Connective Approach in\nSocial Constructivist Classrooms\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Future Directions\nDerivation of Scaffolding Strategy\nFirst Aspect: Developing the Appropriate\nInstructional Method for Crafting Scientific\nExplanations\nPrior to our research study, the art curriculum in Singapore\nhas already adopted Feldman's (1967) method of art criti-\ncism as a simple four-step method for evaluating a work of\nart. It comprises the following:\n1. Description: Listing what an art object seems to\ninclude\n2. Formal analysis: Describing the relationship among\nthe things that were listed\n3. Interpretation: Deciding what all your earlier obser-\nvation means\n4. Judgment: Deciding the value of an art object\nWe noticed the similarities behind the Feldman thinking\nmodel of art criticism and constructing scientific explana-\ntions. Hence, we decided to adapt Feldman's model instead\nof using it directly, with a view to make it more accessible to\nlower secondary students for learning science. Besides, we\nalso intentionally reduced the complexity of experimental-\nbased questions for students with a view that students can\ncollaborate among themselves in deriving valid scientific\nAs a result, we created an instructional model (DINE)\nconsisting of three elements for thinking:\n1. Describe--State what you have observed (adapted\nfrom 1 of Feldman's method). For example, what\ngeneral trends does the graph show? What are the\nhighest and lowest points on the graph? What changes\nwere seen in the set-up?\n2. Interpret--What does your observation mean?\n(adapted from 2 and 3 of Feldman's method). For\nexample, explain the relationship between the vari-\nables. How does the dependent variable (y-axis) vary\nwith the independent variable (x-axis)? How does one\nvariable affect the other variables to cause changes?\n3. Evaluate--How does your observation relate to the-\nory/scientific concepts? (adapted from 4 of Feldman's\nmethod). For example, justify the decision, or explain\nthe concept using theories you have learnt. Why does\nthe graph show such a trend? Why do the changes\nhappen in the setup? Are the results expected accord-\ning to concept?\nIn addition, a DINE poster (Online Appendix A) was\nprinted for every science classroom and exhibited on the\nclassroom walls. It is a step toward making DINE more vis-\nible in classrooms that hopefully increases the frequency of\nits use. Students were taught the use of DINE directly in\nclassrooms through exemplars of experimental-based ques-\ntions (Online Appendix A).\nSecond Aspect: Preparation of Bite-Size Notes for\nTeaching Pre-Requisite Knowledge\nStudent epistemology influences the learning experiences\nstudents have and affects student learning (Hogan &\nMaglienti, 2001). As such, we took into consideration the\nprior knowledge of our target students who had just gradu-\nated from primary school and incorporated additional infor-\nmation on a \"need-to-know\" basis, with focus on context that\ncan help students move forward in their inquiry during the\nscaffolding lesson. For example, pre-requisite knowledge for\nFocal Lesson 1 includes the concept of osmosis, relevant\npractical skills, laboratory safety procedures, and use of an\nonline platform like Google documents for collaboration.\nThird Aspect: Design of Focal Lessons\nWe designed two laboratory-based science experiments as\nfocal lessons where students were able to collect their own\ndata and derive their explanations to data. We were mindful\nthat the tasks in the focal lessons were pitched at the right\nlevel for the students--tasks that are too difficult are outside\nthe students' ZPD, and tasks that are too easy will leave the\nstudents unmotivated. The core difference between the two\nfocal lessons is that the first focal lesson is a laboratory\nexperiment largely based on a scientific concept of osmosis\nwhere students develop explanations based on divergence\nfrom accepted scientific theory, while the second focal les-\nson allows students to design their own experiment and\ndevelop their own scientific explanations. These lessons will\nbe elaborated in the next section.\nFourth Aspect: Developing Domain Pre-Test and\nPost-Test\nPen-and-paper assessment tests based on domain knowledge\nwere developed and administered to students before the\nadministration of DINE instructional strategy and after the\nadministration of DINE instructional strategy, respectively.\nThese assessments included data-based questions in both mul-\ntiple-choice questions and structured questions (Figures 1-3).\nThrough this, we wanted to assess how the preparation and\nteaching of domain knowledge together with the logic dimen-\nsion, DINE instructional strategy, affect learning science.\nFifth Aspect: Adaptation of University of New\nSouth Wales (UNSW) Non-Domain Pre-Test and\nPost-Test\nWe adapted 10 multiple-choice questions extracted from the\nInternational Competitions and Assessments for Schools\n(ICAS) science papers administered by the UNSW from\nB). The ICAS questions were chosen because the questions\nassess students' skills in the key scientific areas of interpret-\ning data, applying data, and higher order skills (http://www.\neaa.unsw.edu.au/forms/pdf/icas/subjects/science-frame-\nwork.pdf). We administered this test before the explicit\nteaching of DINE to understand their pre-analytical ability\nfor experimental data-based questions and administered the\nsame test after the DINE implementation period to check for\nimprovement in their post-analytical ability. It is important to\nnote that we did not conduct any pre-knowledge lessons to\nstudents for these extracted UNSW questions. This fifth\naspect was introduced to find out whether students were able\nto use DINE alone to analyze scientific data beyond their\nepistemological and conceptual knowledge.\nIntervention of Scaffolding Strategy\nThe two focal lessons were carried out accordingly in chron-\nological order and administered to all four Secondary 1\nexpress stream classes comprising of 40 students each (total\n160 students), over a period of 8 months.\nStage 1: Conduct UNSW non-domain pre-test and domain\npre-test before DINE is taught to students.\nStage 2: Students were taught directly and explicitly the\nuse of DINE prior to focal lessons in the following for-\nmat: Describe--What do you observe? Interpret--What\ndoes your observation mean? Evaluate--How is your\nobservation related to theory/scientific concepts? Guiding\nslides on DINE and examples can be found in Online\nAppendix A.\nStage 3: Conduct of Focal Lesson 1 (Online Appendix C).\nStage 4: Conduct of Focal Lesson 2 (Online Appendix D).\nStage 5: Conduct UNSW non-domain post-test and\ndomain post-test after the implementation of DINE and\nfocal lessons.\nThe activities of Stages 3 and 4 are described in detail in\nthe remaining parts of this chapter.\n6 SAGE Open\nStage 3: Focal Lesson 1\nIn the selected laboratory experiment on diffusion and osmo-\nsis (Online Appendix C), students were tasked to carry out\nthe experiment and obtain their own tabular data through the\npractical session. Via Google document, students worked in\ngroups of four and used DINE to answer the two questions\nposed in the practical session.\nStep 1: Students participated in the practical session and\ncollected the tabular data on their own (Figure 5). Practical\nskills and laboratory safety were taught prior to this focal\nlesson.\nStep 2: After completing the practical and clearing up the\nlaboratory benches, students worked collaboratively in\ngroups of four and used DINE to answer the two ques-\ntions at the end of the practical exercise: Explain what\nhappens to the potato strip when placed in distilled water?\nAnd explain what happens to the potato strip when placed\nin 20% sucrose solution? They answered the questions in\na Google document that was created and shared among\nclassmates. The Google document allowed students to\ncollaborate and share answers with a view to help each\nother develop a better understanding of construction of\nscientific explanation.\nStep 3: Each student was allocated one part of explanation\ndone by another group to critique; that is, Student A cri-\ntiqued on the \"Describe\" statement done by Group 1,\nStudent B in turn would critique on the \"Interpret\" state-\nment done by Group 1. Some students were observed to\nhave gone on to critique the entire explanation (D, IN, E\nparts) done by a group (Online Appendix E).\nStep 4: Teacher does a general feedback for the class.\nStage 4: Focal Lesson 2\nThe second focal lesson was carried out in two separate les-\nson periods--exploration of school eco-garden and generat-\ning inquiry questions (Part 1) and using DINE strategy to\nconstruct scientific explanations to the students' inquiry\nquestions (Part 2; Online Appendix D).\nStep 1: In Focal Lesson 2 Part 1, students worked in\ngroups of four. They were brought down to the school\neco-garden to observe the biodiversity there and came up\nwith their own inquiry questions and hypotheses using the\nworksheet provided. In groups, they designed a simple\nexperiment to test out their hypotheses and included the\ntype of data they were collecting. At the end of the Focal\nLesson 2 Part 1, the teacher collected the worksheets.\nStep 2: The teacher looked at each experiment and hypoth-\nesis selected by each group and came up with fictitious\ndata in tabular form for the groups to analyze. The ficti-\ntious data were customized to the hypotheses and experi-\nments of each group (Figure 6). This fictitious data\ngeneration was performed between Parts 1 and 2 of Focal\nStep 3: In Focal Lesson 2 Part 2, the teacher returned to\nthe classroom with fictitious data generated for each\ngroup. Using the guided worksheet (Online Appendix D),\nstudents worked in their own groups and used DINE\ninstructional strategy to construct scientific explanations\nfor their hypotheses. During the session, each group had\nto use the data provided to Describe, \"What are the high-\nest and lowest readings?\" Interpret, \"What do these read-\nings signify? Is the trend of the data increasing, decreasing,\nor constant and what does it mean?\" and Evaluate--\"Give\na conclusion to your hypothesis, stating whether it was\npossibly true or possibly false, and why.\" The teacher col-\nlected the worksheets and assessed students' ability to\nconstruct scientific explanations.\nData Collection and Interpretation\nQuantitative Analysis of Domain Pre-Test and\nPost-Test\nWe conducted a paired-sample t test to understand if there is\na significant improvement in students structuring scientific\nexplanations using DINE, in assessment tests that require\ndomain knowledge.\nThe null hypothesis (H\n) is that DINE instructional strat-\negy has no impact in improving students' understanding and\nInitial length /cm Final length /cm Difference in length /cm Texture and appearance\nFigure 5.

With regard to the test results listed in\nFigure 7, the p value obtained for a one-tail t test is .027 (p <\n.05), and the null hypothesis can be rejected. Therefore, we\ncan conclude that DINE has a significant impact on students'\nability to construct scientific explanations if scaffolding\noccurs within their ZPD.\nComparing the individual classes in Figure 8 using a\npaired-sample t test as above (null hypothesis [H\n] is that\nDINE has no impact in improving students' construction of\nscientific explanations), the p values obtained and respective\nimplications are collated in Figure 9.\nA possible explanation to qualitatively explain why DINE\nmay not have a positive impact on Class S will be the English\nlanguage ability of the class. A comparison of the English\nlanguage examination scores in the same time frame of this\nproject showed that Class S had the lowest mean score\namong all four classes. The command of the English lan-\nguage may have an important role to play in helping students\nunderstand what Describe, Interpret, and Evaluate entail and\nthe science concepts taught during the period. This would be\nin line with Jacob, Alexander, and Shola (2013) who found\nthat there was a correlation between proficiency in English\nlanguage and academic performance of students in science\nand technical education.\nHowever, as depicted in Figure 8, Class P that performed\nthe best in the domain pre-test among the four express classes\nobtained a slightly lower overall mean for the domain post-\ntest. Our act of \"intentional reduction of complexity of\nexperimental based questions\" may have caused some\nstudents to lose their interest during the focal lessons. This\noffers the explanation on why the null hypothesis for Class P\nis not rejected.\nTherefore, the results in Figure 9 explicate two important\nfacts: The weaker Class S needs pre-knowledge teaching,\nand the stronger Class P needs a more complex ZPD.\nBesides, the positive results offered by Figures 7 and 9\nexplicate the fact that we need to apply three aspects collec-\ntively for our scaffolding strategy.\nQuantitative Analysis of UNSW DINE Pre-Test\nand Post-Test\nOne mark was allocated per correct answer, with a maximum\nscoring of 10 marks. We conducted a paired-sample t test to\nexamine whether there is a significant improvement in the\nmean marks of post-test compared with the mean marks of\npre-test of all the four classes (Figure 10).\nOnly for Class Q, the absolute value of the t stat was\nsmaller than the t critical two-tail and the probability that the\nnull hypothesis is true is smaller than alpha (p = .0012). For\nClasses P, R, and S, there was no significant statistical differ-\nence between the mean pre-test and post-test scores.\nThe adapted UNSW pre-test and post-test assesses stu-\ndents'ability to analyze data-based questions without a com-\nmon understanding of the assessed scientific concepts and\nFigure 8.

With\nthese findings, we realized that equipping students with just\nDINE approach alone is not sufficient for students to learn\nscience; instead, it reinforces that learning science occurs in\ncontext, and students need to have a connected epistemologi-\ncal and ontological domain that functions in tandem with the\nlogic dimension. These results also provide the grounding\nfor the need of shared epistemologies and ontologies that can\nbe achieved through proper argumentation when learning in\ngroups.\nQualitative Feedback of Student Survey\nUsing an online survey platform, we created a survey for the\nstudents after the implementation of DINE instructional\nstrategy to gather feedback on the usefulness of the strategy.\nThe following questions were asked:\nQuestion 1: Do you find the DINE method (Describe,\nINterpret, Evaluate) taught to you earlier to answer struc-\ntured or essay questions effective?\n--Yes\n--No\nQuestion 2: What can be improved on for DINE?\nFor Question 1, on the effectiveness of DINE instruc-\ntional strategy in constructing scientific explanations for\ndata-based questions, the results are shown in the graph\nbelow (Figure 11). In all, 85% majority of students do see the\nneed for a structured approach to help train skills for con-\nstruction of scientific explanations.\nFor Question 2 on the possible improvements for the\nDINE action strategy, the students' comments are collated\nand listed in Figure 12 below.\nComparative Observations of Students' Products\nin Focal Lessons 1 and 2\nFocal Lessons 1 and 2 were two different approaches that\nallowed students to use DINE to construct their scientific\nexplanations. Both lessons enabled students to work collab-\noratively in groups where spaces were provided for argumen-\ntation. The approach for Focal Lesson 1 focused more on\nstudents'ability to construct scientific explanations to explain\ntheir data coherence to or divergence from the accepted scien-\ntific theory of osmosis that was taught prior in lessons. The\napproach for Focal Lesson 2 enabled students in groups to\nformulate their own scientific explanations and theories based\non the given data. Focal Lesson 1 also allowed for both indi-\nvidual and shared expressions of their understanding in con-\nstructing scientific explanations; Focal Lesson 2 allowed for\na shared expression of their understanding.\nFocal Lesson 1. In Focal Lesson 1, where groups collaborate\nin discussing explanations of data divergence to accepted\ntheory (osmosis) using DINE, their answers showed a more\ncomplete analysis of data as seen in (a), as compared with\nanswers in (e) and (f) discussed below.\na. \"The potato strip increased in length. The water mole-\ncules had moved from the water which has higher water\npotential to the potato which has lower water potential of\nwater molecules through osmosis through the partially\npermeable membrane.\" (Online Appendix E)\nIt was also noticed that when students were given the\nownership to critique the work of their peers, it seems that\nindividually, they were better at pointing out the missing\ngaps.\nb. \" . . . although all three statements are correct, the\nwhole explanation does not make sense. In the `E' col-\numn, how did the process of osmosis cause the potato\nstrip to increase in length? The group only provided the\ndefinition of osmosis and even the explanation is incom-\nplete (what does the water molecules pass through?).\nThey also did not explain how the process relates to the\npotato strip's increase in length.\" (Online Appendix E)\nIn the above comment (b) from a student on a group's\nanswer, he or she accurately pinpoints the mistakes that stu-\ndents have been making over the years--they are able to\nreproduce theoretical knowledge, but unable to link that\ndomain knowledge to the context in the question given.\nc. \"You should be more specific and state it as `potato\nstrip' instead of potato as there's a difference between a\nwhole potato and just a strip.\" (Online Appendix E)\nd. \"The definition is incomplete, they should have men-\ntioned \"osmosis\" in their answer as it is a key word . . . \"\n(Online Appendix E)\nIn the critiques (c) and (d) above, individual students echo\nthe common mantra of teachers for students to be more spe-\ncific in writing their scientific explanations--students tend\nto be careless with keywords and use of scientific terms in\ntheir daily work.\nFocal Lesson 2. In Focal Lesson 2 where there is no evident or\nshared understanding of a scientific theory to evaluate coher-\nence to, or divergence of theory from, data, it was observed that\nstudents were more general in their scientific explanations.\nFigure 11. Survey findings of the effectiveness of DINE.\ne. \"The readings signify that the water quality is bad . . . If\nthere are dead fishes in the water, it means that the water\nquality is not good. Our hypothesis is possibly false. As\nstated in the reading that when the pH level is high, there\nare dead fishes, when the pH level is low, there are lesser\ndead fishes.\" (Online Appendix F)\nf. \"The readings signify that the plant grow taller with\nsupport than without support. The trend of the data is\nincreasing. The support enable the plant to grow taller.\nThus, enables the plant to get more sunlight and make\nfood. So the plant will grow healthily. Our hypothesis is\ntrue. The plant without support grew slower than the plant\nwith support even though they were given the same\namount of time.\" (Online Appendix F)\nIn Example (e), the students used vague words, \"bad\"\nand \"not good,\" to describe the water quality when data on\npH were provided. It implies that not only are the students\nunclear about how pH can affect water quality for fish\nsurvival, it also shows that they do not comprehend the\nscientific measurement of pH. Their conclusions implied\nthat as the pH level increases, the number of dead fish\nincreases although the readings given ranged between pH\nIn Example (f), the students were able to describe that\n\"the support enable the plant to grow taller\" and added the\nconsequence of how height \"enables the plant to get more\nsunlight and make food.\" The consequence did not explain\nhow the support enabled the plant to grow taller. These\nexamples fully support the importance of role of domain\nknowledge in applying scaffolding strategies as substanti-\nated by Vygotsky (1978). Without sufficient domain knowl-\nedge, the scaffolding is not within their ZPD; hence, it is\nnot effective, and it does not help to extend their potential\nof constructing proper scientific explanations. The differ-\nence between Focal Lessons 1 and 2 is that domain knowl-\nedge is shared by the teacher in Focal Lesson 1 but common\ndomain knowledge has to undergo group processes of argu-\nmentation in Focal Lesson 2 before there is a shared\nunderstanding.\nIn Focal Lesson 1, where data were interpreted based\non divergence from theory, students were taught the pre-\nrequisite theoretical knowledge of osmosis prior, and their\nargumentation in groups was based on a similar shared\nunderstanding among students. This could possibly have led\nto more constructive argumentation and refinement of their\nconstruction of scientific explanations. In Focal Lesson 2,\nwhere students had more space to develop their own theories\nand consequently scientific explanations, we observed that\nthere was more variation in quality of responses to construc-\ntion of explanations. This could be due to the lack of a strong\nshared epistemology of theoretical knowledge among the\ngroup members due to weak argumentation skills in group\nwork. Because of the lack of a common theoretical under-\nstanding, students have to rely more on the argumentation\nprocess that occurs in collaborative group work to create a\nshared understanding to construct better scientific explana-\ntions for their theories.\nThese observations have led to an expanded understand-\ning of the use of the connective approach in constructing\nscientific explanations. From the quantitative analysis of\ndomain scores and UNSW non-domain test scores and the\nqualitative feedback of the student survey, it is evident that\nthe collective use of epistemology, ontology, and logic is\nnecessary in developing scientific explanations in students.\nHowever, the observations of the group processes in con-\nstructing shared understandings of scientific explanations\nmay point to an expanded understanding of the connective\napproach, where learning occurs both in context and in cre-\nating shared understandings in groups.\nExpanded Understandings of the\nConnective Approach\nBecause learning occurs in context and within communities\nof practice (Lave & Wenger, 1991), it is necessary to look\nat the connective approach in social learning environments.\nThe individual cognitive aspects of the connective approach\nhave expanded meanings when studied in the perspective of\nlearning in social classroom settings where knowledge is\nPositive Areas for improvement\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Nothing; it is good enough\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Outdoor experiments makes questions related/requires the\nDINE method makes it more easy and fun to do.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 DINE has already covered all the question needed for\nexplanation question as long as we follow the DINE\napproach there shouldn't be any other things to add on hence\ni think the DINE approach is good enough.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Teachers can explain the way of answering questions using this method\nbetter as students may not know when and how to use this method when a\nquestion is given to them to answer. They can also give some examples of\nstudents answering the questions correctly using the DINE method.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 For example the IN in DINE, the meaning is to INterpret. It is not really\nclear what to interpret when you already describe your answer.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Use it more often for most questions and also expand its use to elaborate\nanswers longer.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 The DINE method can be improved by adding on extra information about\nthe method and tips on how to answer the questions with better answers\nwhen using the DINE method.\nFigure 12. Student comments on DINE strategy.\nNote. DINE = describe, interpret, and evaluate.\nsocially constructed. Ontology has expanded meanings in\n\"realist ontology\" where scientific knowledge is socially\nconstructed but restricted by ontology of natural phenom-\nena (as cited in Driver, Asoko, Leach, Scott, & Mortimer,\n1994, p. 6); individual epistemology can be re-conceptual-\nized as epistemology as a social practice (Kelly, McDonald,\n& Wickman, 2012) where sociocultural norms can affect\none's conceptions; individual logic can be viewed as shared\nlogic formation through argumentation that can be affected\nby persuasive goals and ethnographic norms (Bricker &\nwork that focused on the cognition aspects of conceptual\nchange, Pintrich, Marx, and Boyle (1993) pointed out the\nmotivational constructs of the learner that can affect the\nstate of conceptual change. This perspective takes into\naccount the idea that teachers teach learners with complex\ngoals, values, and beliefs, not just the logical subject mat-\nter. Factoring the inclusion of both individual motivational\nand social constructs that are present in learning based on\ncurrent understandings, Figure 13 aims to represent how\nthe connective approach looks like in social constructivist\nclassrooms.\nOntology\nDriver et al. (1994) contend that it is important to realize that\nscientific knowledge is \"both symbolic in nature and also\nsocially negotiated\" (p. 5). What we know are constructs of\nphenomena of nature that are interpreted and accepted by the\nscientific community (Driver et al., 1994). Yet, a view that\nscientific knowledge is socially constructed does not equate\nto relativism. Harre (as cited in Driver et al., 1994, p. 6) pro-\nposed a realist ontology, where scientific knowledge though\nsocially negotiated, is still constrained by natural phenomena\nin the world and the empirical data that scientists gather from\nit. Pickering (as cited in Lehrer, Schauble, & Lucas, 2008)\ndescribes science as a process that \"forms a dialectic of\nresistance (by nature) and accommodation (by humans)\"\nand the \"outcome of this dialectic cannot be determined a\nlearning science is more than just extension of an individu-\nal's knowledge about natural phenomena, more than chal-\nlenging prior conceptions through discrepant events, more\nthan a reorganization of \"commonsense reasoning\" (p. 8);\nlearning science had to involve learners in ways of thinking\nand explaining the world by becoming socialized into the\nways of the scientific community.\nEpistemology\nFrom a psychological perspective, an individual can have\nmore than one epistemology; for instance, formal and prac-\ntical epistemologies (Sandoval, 2005), personal epistemol-\nogy, and epistemology as social practice (Kelly et al., 2012).\nThe study of students' epistemology helps us comprehend\nthe origins, scope, nature, and limitations of their under-\nstandings of scientific knowledge. Epistemology as social\npractice sees \"epistemology as constituted through situated\nclassrooms like ethnography and sociocultural norms can\naffect how learners participate in learning and meaning-\nmaking. In this view of sociocultural epistemology, \"knowl-\nedge is seen as a competent action in a situation rather than\nas correct, static representations of the world\" (Kelly et al.,\nenacted upon rather than being absorbed. Through discourse\nand interactions in classrooms, a teacher or a more knowl-\nedgeable other can influence the conversations to what is\nvalued as knowledge.\nLogic\nOne of the science practices central to the study of science is\nengagement with argument from evidence. Formal logic\nignores the power of scientific persuasion; social construc-\ntion of scientific facts through history, anthropology, and\nsociology (Latour & Woolgar, 1979); the cultural milieu of\nthe scientific community; and effects of ethnography and\ncognitive psychology in the formation of arguments (Bricker\n& Bell, 2008). Conceptualizations of argumentation show\nthe gradual shift of viewing logic formation internally in the\nminds of individuals, to shared logic formation expressed\nexternally that takes social and cultural factors into account\nand is developed together in communities. For instance,\nargumentation theory focuses on the persuasive goal of argu-\nments. Here, argumentation is \"social\" (as cited in Bricker\np. 477) because it involves two or more people often aimed\nFigure 13. Connective approach in social constructivist\nclassrooms.\nat defending their personal standpoints until it becomes\nacceptable to one another. \"Reasonableness\" (as cited in\nBricker & Bell, 2008) is dependent on context and can be\njudged by \"target audiences\" or \"criteria specific to specific\ngroups\" (p. 478) like scientists. Argumentation can appear in\nvarious forms like verbal, written, and visual argumentation\nSummary and Future Directions\nAt the end of this research study, it became apparent that\nthere are three factors that must converge to affect the devel-\nopment of an individual student's ability to construct scien-\ntific explanations and consequently, better understanding of\nscientific concepts. They are as follows:\n1. DINE instructional strategy (Logic)\n2. Domain knowledge through bite-size classroom\nteaching (Epistemology)\n3. Focal lessons within ZPD (Ontology)\nStatistical results through the measurement of domain\npre-test and domain post-test scores have shown a significant\nimprovement in student performance in two out of four\nclasses. This means that to develop a successful scaffolding\nstrategy for answering experimental-based questions, we\nneed a collective approach of \"DINE,\" \"Bite-size Learning,\"\nand \"Focal Lesson\" via the connective approach. From our\nstudent survey feedback, most of the students have found the\nDINE instructional strategy helpful in the construction of\nscientific explanation.\nThe observations of student products derived from the\ndifferent approaches in Focal Lessons 1 and 2 also suggested\nthat the connective approach can be and should be applied to\nlearning within social contexts. They are as follows:\n1. Argumentation (Logic)\n2. Epistemology as a social practice (Epistemology)\n3. Realist/personal ontologies (Ontology)\nThe ontology, epistemology, and logic of students' think-\ning and learning of science in social contexts should be\nunderstood together because of the relatedness to each\ndomain. The understanding of personal ontologies relies on\nan understanding of students' epistemologies; the logic of\nscientific argumentation in classroom relies on an under-\nstanding of students' epistemologies; different epistemolo-\ngiescanelicitdifferentreasonsthatwillmodifyanontological\nview (Gupta, Hammer, & Redish, 2010). An understanding\nof epistemologies alone is incomplete to guide science teach-\ners in developing \"reality\" within natural phenomena, con-\nceptual changes, and scientific argumentation in classrooms.\nThese three domains each have expanded views that include\nideas of socially constructed knowledge that is consistent\nwith current science education understandings of learning in\nclassrooms.\nThe interplay of the three domains of connective approach\nin socially negotiated spaces can also be observed in scien-\ntific modeling practices (Passmore & Svoboda, 2012) and\nother science pedagogies like project-based science instruc-\ntion. The role of teacher in social constructivist classrooms\nis important. The teacher not only facilitates students' co-\nconstruction of shared knowledge, but he or she also needs to\nhave a well-structured classroom environment that provides\nspace for development of the three domains. These include\ntaking into account group dynamics for argumentation, scaf-\nfolding structures to elicit epistemic aims of models, and\nexperiential learning experiences. Structures in managing\ngroup dynamics need to be in place to engage the silent\nlearner, provide room for individual accountability (Barron\net al., 1998), and prevent a marginalization of the alternative,\nto have full participation and co-construction of knowledge\nwhile satisfying all three domains in each student.Assessment\nof learning is needed to provide feedback to students on epis-\ntemic, ontological, and logic dimensions for development\n(Duschl, 2008). The conclusions from this research study\nhave benefited our teachers in understanding how students\nlearn via the dimensions of the connective approach and will\nallow us to direct our future studies on learning science in\nsocial constructivist classrooms.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nBarron, B.
