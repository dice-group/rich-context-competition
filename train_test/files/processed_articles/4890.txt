In addition, we examined the effect of stress on the\nperceived trustworthiness of faces in these two groups. Stress was induced in 45 civilian participants and 45 army participants\nthrough the Sing-a-Song Stress Test (SSST). In this paradigm seven neutral sentences are presented, each followed by a\n60-s interval. An eighth sentence asks participants to sing a song aloud after the next (eighth or stress) interval. Participants\nrated the trustworthiness of five neutral faces, both before and after the SSST. Pupil size, heart rate, and skin conductance\nwere adopted as physiological stress correlates. Stress response was calculated as the difference between the mean values\nover the last neutral interval and the stress interval. Subjective stress ratings were obtained before and after the SSST. The\nbaseline levels of all physiological and subjective measures were the same in the army and civilian groups, while all measures\nshowed a significant increase following the stressor. However, compared with the civilian group, army participants reported\nsignificantly less stress and showed significantly attenuated heart rate and skin conductance responses to the SSST.

It is typically\nassumed that, through selection, training or experience, mili-\ntary personnel is more resilient to stress than civilians and\nthat their judgment is less affected by stress. However, until\nnow, this hypothesis has not been tested.\nAn important type of judgment that army personnel needs\nto make is the threat posed by the individuals they encounter\n(Becker et al., 2011). It is known that people typically base\ntheir initial rapid assessment of the intentions of \"the other\" on\nfacial trustworthiness judgments (Klapper, Dotsch, van Rooij,\n& Wigboldus, 2016). The neural mechanisms that are involved\nin these judgments also mediate stress reactions (van Marle,\nHermans, Qin, & Fern\u00e1ndez, 2009). Because acute stress typi-\ncally induces negative affect, it is likely to negatively modu-\nlate (bias) facial trustworthiness judgments. Especially in\nstressful peace keeping operations involving regular social\ncontact with civilians (i.e., people who do not directly take\npart in the conflict), military should at all times maintain their\nability to make unbiased social judgments. If stress should\ncompromise this capability (with potentially serious and even\ndeadly consequences), this would indicate the need for stress\nawareness training or inoculation programs.\nIn this study, we investigate acute stress in civilians and\narmy personnel, using both subjective and objective (physi-\nological) stress response measures. For both groups, we\nexamine the effect of the stressor on facial trustworthiness\njudgments and the association between stress and facial\njudgment. We hypothesize that (Hypothesis 1 [H1]) army\npersonnel is more resilient against acute stress than civilians,\nthat (Hypothesis 2 [H2]) acute stress negatively biases facial\ntrustworthiness judgments, and that (Hypothesis 3 [H3]) this\neffect is weaker in army personnel than in civilians.\nIn the next sections, we discuss factors that modulate sus-\nceptibility to stress and that are potentially relevant for our\n1TNO, Soesterberg, The Netherlands\nCorresponding Author:\nAlexander Toet, TNO, Kampweg 5, Soesterberg 3769 DE,\nThe Netherlands.\nEmail: lex.toet@tno.nl\nStress Response and Facial\nTrustworthiness Judgments in Civilians\nand Military\nAlexander Toet1, Martijn Bijlsma1, and Anne-Marie Brouwer1\n Keywords\nstress, facial trustworthiness, SSST, civilians, military\n2 SAGE Open\ntopic of research, like personality and experience, and the\neffects of stress on facial trustworthiness measurements.\nStress and Personality\nThe ability to react promptly to adverse conditions or events\nthat threaten homeostasis is essential for survival (McEwen,\ntive) that are appraised as threatening and unmanageable\n(stressors) typically elicit a psychological state commonly\nreferred to as stress and trigger a cascade of behavioral and\nphysiological activation systems that strive to maintain\nhomeostasis (de Kloet, Joels, & Holsboer, 2005; Lazarus,\nClosely associated with stress response and recovery is\nthe concept of resilience, a broad term defining the process\nof coping with or overcoming exposure to adversity or stress.\nTypical coping styles that people use to deal with the adverse\neffects of stress are either active (problem- or emotion-\nfocused) or passive (avoidant; Afshar et al., 2015). Both the\nvulnerability to stress and the preference for a certain coping\nstrategy depend on a person's personality traits (Afshar et al.,\nTorgersen, 2000). People with adaptive personality traits\n(e.g., high extraversion and conscientiousness) are less sus-\nceptible to stress and prefer active coping styles while people\nwith maladaptive personality traits (neuroticism) are more\nvulnerable to stress and prefer avoidance coping. Depending\non their coping style, people perceive a stressor either as a\nchallenge or a threat (Blascovich, Mendes, Vanman, &\nChallenge is considered an adaptive response which occurs\nwhen evaluated personal resources meet or exceed perceived\nsituational demands, whereas threat is seen as a maladaptive\nresponse that occurs when the perceived demands exceed the\npersonal resources. Simply framing a task as either a chal-\nlenge or a threat (without altering the perceive task demands)\ncan significantly affect a person's stress reactivity (Turner,\nJones, Sheffield, Barker, & Coffee, 2014). Challenges are\ntypically associated with positive affect while threats are\ntypically associated with negative affect (Turner, Jones,\nIn the current study, we investigate whether military per-\nsonnel, who are typically expected and trained to be adaptive\nand to view their task as a challenge rather than a threat,\nshow lower subjective and physiological stress responses\nthan civilians to a negative stressor that is well-controlled,\neasy to administer, and social in nature.\nStress and Experience\nSusceptibility to stress depends not only on personality but\nalso on previous experiences. Subjective levels of anxiety\nand stress are found to be lower in experienced people than\nin novices for stressful tasks like shooting under pressure\n(Landman, Nieuwenhuys, & Oudejans, 2016) or skydiving\n(Breivik, Roth, & Erik J\u00f8rgensen, 1998; Hare, Wetherell, &\nHofmann, 1996). Physiological markers have been found to\nindicate lower levels of stress in experienced people than in\nnovices as well. Pre-jump levels of heart rate (HR) were\nlower for experienced skydivers than for inexperienced ones\nrespiration (Roth et al., 1996) and cortisol (Meyer et al.,\n2015). In these skydiving studies, effects of a stressor on sub-\njective and physiological measures of stress were compared\nbetween participants who were either experienced or not on\nthat specific stressor.\nIn the current study, we investigate the hypothesis that\nmilitary personnel, being more experienced in dealing with\nstressful situations in general, show lower subjective and\nphysiological stress responses than civilians to a negative\nstressor.\nStress and Facial Trustworthiness Judgments\nTrust judgments are of primary relevance to human social\nperception (Fiske, Cuddy, & Glick, 2007). This probably\nreflects the result of evolutionary pressures: On encountering\nstrangers, people must quickly determine whether the inten-\ntions of the \"other\" are good or bad. Perceptions of trustwor-\nthiness are largely based on facial features (Oosterhof &\nTodorov, 2008). People routinely evaluate facial expressions\nto infer each other's specific behavioral or interaction inten-\ntions. Especially under time pressure and in complex situa-\ntions, these judgments are often made spontaneously\nidly (Marzi, Righi, Ottonello, Cincotta, & Viggiano, 2012),\nand largely nonconscious (Ballew & Todorov, 2007; Olivola\nTodorov, 2006), well before relevant information has been\nretrieved from memory (Rudoy & Paller, 2009). Rapid per-\nsonality judgments based only on facial appearance influ-\nence various social outcomes, ranging from the willingness\nto cooperate (van't Wout & Sanfey, 2008) to political voting\nbehavior and criminal sentencing decisions (Ballew &\nOur social judgments are known to be affected by our\nIn other words, people have a tendency to base their judg-\nments on their current mental state. As a result, affect elicited\nby one event may infuse (bias) social judgments of unrelated\nAffect infusion is most likely to occur in situations with high\nToet et al. 3\nuncertainty and time pressure when people resort to heuristic\njudgments, affect may bias the assessment since people need\nto rely on heuristic information processing when judging\nunfamiliar persons. Dunn and Schweitzer (2005) found that\nemotions (happiness, sadness, anger, guilt, and gratitude)\ntypically bias trust judgments in the direction of the emo-\ntion's valence. Also, neutral faces are perceived as more\nnegative in negative self-related contexts (Wieser et al.,\n2014), while socially anxious individuals interpret neutral\nfaces as more threatening (Schwarz, Wieser, Gerdes,\nrecent study found that higher state anxiety causes a bias\ntoward identifying anger in ambiguous facial expressions\nNeuropsychological studies have shown that our ability to\nconstrain the spillover of affect from one context into the\nnext critically depends on the functioning of our lateral pre-\nfrontal cortex. It appears that even mild acute uncontrollable\nstress can rapidly and significantly inhibit prefrontal cogni-\ntive functions (Arnsten, 2009), resulting in a biased evalua-\ntion of novel neutral faces (Lapate et al., 2017).\nIn this study, we examine whether neutral faces are judged\nas less trustworthy after the occurrence of a personally rele-\nvant negative stressor (whose effectiveness is examined\nusing other variables). If there is indeed a stress-related bias\nof facial trustworthiness ratings, it is not a priori evident that\nstress resilience may reduce this bias (over and above the\nreduced level of stress). This will be examined here as well.\nCurrent Study\nTo summarize, in this study, we tested the hypothesis that\n(either through training or selection) army personnel is more\nresilient to stress than civilians (as indicated by several sub-\njective and physiological measures). In addition, we investi-\ngated whether stress differentially affects perceived facial\ntrustworthiness in these two groups. While a military realis-\ntic stressor may be considered the most suitable stimulus for\nthis purpose, its use is evidently not desirable from a practi-\ncal and ethical point of view. We therefore used an acute\nsocial stressor in this study (the Sing-a-Song Stress Test or\nSSST: Brouwer & Hogervorst, 2014) assuming that subjec-\ntive and physiological stress responses to, for example, phys-\nical and body threatening stressors generalize to other types\nof stressors.\nMethods and Material\nParticipants\nThe participant sample was comprised of 45 male civilian\nparticipants and 45 male army participants. The civilian par-\nstudents recruited at Utrecht University (Utrecht, The\nNetherlands). The army participants, aged from 24 to 49 years\n(M = 31.4, SD = 6.9), were recruited at the \"Oranjekazerne\"\narmy base (Schaarsbergen, The Netherlands). For final analy-\nsis, we excluded 15 civilian and 14 army participants with\nmissing or unreliable data in one or more of the data streams\n(pupil size [PS], electrocardiograph [ECG], no cursor move-\nment in response to the trustworthiness questions for the\nentire experiment), to maintain exactly the same group of\nindividuals for each variable. As a result, the final analysis\nincluded 30 civilian participants, aged from 18 to 53 years (M\nThe experimental protocol was reviewed and approved by\nthe TNO Internal Review Board on experiments with human\nand was in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of\nand the ethical guidelines of the American Psychological\nAssociation. All participants gave their written consent prior\nto the experiment.\nStress Induction\nThe validated SSST (Brouwer & Hogervorst, 2014) was\nused to induce acute stress. In the SSST paradigm, partici-\npants are instructed to sit still in front of a computer screen\nand read some neutral sentences that are consecutively pre-\nsented, each followed by a 60-s countdown interval (the neu-\ntral intervals). The final sentence announces that the\nparticipant should sing a song aloud after the next countdown\ninterval (the stress interval). It has been shown that the antic-\nipation of singing reliably induces an acute stress response at\nlevels that are comparable to that induced by the more elabo-\nrate Trier Social Stress Task, where the SSST paradigm con-\ntrols for motor activity and perceptual input (Brouwer &\nHogervorst, 2014). In this study, we used seven neutral\nDutch phrases that were presented for 5 s each and followed\nby a timer counting down from 60 to 0 s. The eighth sentence\nwas (translated from Dutch): \"Task: Start singing a song\naloud when the counter reaches zero. Keep sitting still until\nthat moment.\" This eighth stress sentence was similar in\nlength and structure to the previous seven neutral sentences.\nAn example of a (translated) neutral sentence is \"Sentence:\nThe first vacuum cleaner was constructed by Sweep\nCompany. This was in 1907 and the device was called\nHoover.\" A confederate (posing as an additional participant\nwaiting for his turn) was present during the entire experi-\nment. The confederate and the experimenter together formed\nthe audience that served to increase the social stress experi-\nenced by the participant (Harris, 2001). The version of the\nSSST used in this study was shortened and simplified com-\npared with the original version as described by Brouwer and\nHogervorst (2014) in that we used seven rather than nine\nneutral sentences, and that we used one confederate and the\nexperimenter rather than two \"participant\" confederates.\n4 SAGE Open\nSubjective Measurements\nPerceived stress.The participants reported their perceived\nstress level by positioning a mouse controlled slider along a\nVisual Analog Scale (VAS; Aitken, 1969; Bond & Lader,\nstress.\" This VAS was administered before the SSST (asking\nfor their currently experienced stress level) and after the\nSSST (asking for their stress level in the countdown interval\njust before singing).\nFacial trustworthiness.To measure facial trustworthiness, we\nselected 10 male faces from the validated Princeton Faces\nDatabase that are classified as neutral on the Trustworthiness\ndimension (Figure 1: the images with identifiers fi_000_tw3.\nbmp - fi_009_tw3.bmp, available from http://tlab.princeton.\nedu/databases/25-maximally-distinct-identities-trustworthi-\nness; see also Oosterhof & Todorov, 2008; Todorov, Dotsch,\nPorter, Oosterhof, & Falvello, 2013). We selected faces that\nwere neutral on Trustworthiness as their affective appraisal is\nmost likely to be influenced by the emotional state of the\nobserver because of their ambiguous nature (Cooney, Atlas,\nwhile they minimize the risk of facial trustworthiness adapta-\ntion (Wincenciak, Dzhelyova, Perrett, & Barraclough, 2013).\nWe only used Caucasian male faces to eliminate sex- and race\ncontingent face aftereffects (Anthony C (Little, DeBruine, &\nFive randomly selected faces from the total set of 10 were\nshown during the prestress induction interval of the SSST.\nThe remaining five faces were presented during the poststress\ninduction interval. Their order of presentation was random-\nized across the participants. Hence, each face was shown only\nonce to each of the participants. Participants were asked to\nrate the Trustworthiness of each face \"on their gut feeling\" by\nmoving a cursor along a VAS on the computer screen that was\nlabeled from 0 or \"absolutely not trustworthy\" to a 100 or\n\"absolutely trustworthy.\" No time limit was imposed for the\nrating task.\nPhysiological Measurements\nHR, skin conductance level (SCL), and PS were registered to\nmonitor the participant's physical response during the exper-\niment. HR (Brouwer, Van Wouwe, Muehl, van Erp, & Toet,\n2013; Mandrick, Peysakhovich, R\u00e9my, Lepron, & Causse,\nstress or arousal response and expected to increase following\nthe stressor in this case. For each of these three physiological\nparameters, we define the stress response as the difference\nbetween their mean values over, respectively, the SSST stress\ninterval (the eighth and last 60-s countdown interval follow-\ning the sing-a-song assignment) and the last neutral SSST\ncountdown interval (the seventh 60-s countdown interval\nfollowing the last neutral sentence).\nHR and skin conductance. The SCL and HR signals were digi-\ntized with a BioSemi ActiveTwo AD-box (www.biosemi.\ncom) and stored on a Dell Optiplex 960 computer running\nLabVIEW graphical software (www.ni.com) for data inspec-\ntion and acquisition.\nHR was determined from an ECG signal. The ECG chan-\nnel electrode was placed at the sixth left intercostal space\n(midclavicular line). The reference electrode was placed at\nthe first right intercostal space below the right clavicular\nbone (midclavicular line). From the ECG data, the mean time\nperiod between two consecutive heart beats was determined\n(the interbeat interval or IBI in ms) over the two countdown\nintervals of interest. The mean IBI value was then converted\nto beats per minute or HR.\nFigure 1. Ten face images from the Princeton Faces Database that are classified as neutral on the Trustworthiness dimension.\nSource. Available from http://tlab.princeton.edu/databases/25-maximally-distinct-identities-trustworthiness.\nToet et al. 5\nSkin conductance was recorded with two Nihon Kohden\nelectrodes which induced an oscillator signal synchronized\nwith the sample rate. The electrodes were applied to the tips\nof, respectively, the forefinger and the middle finger of the\nleft hand of the participant (the hand not used to respond in\nthe experiment). The skin conductance signal was filtered by\na 30-Hz low-pass two-sided Butterworth filter, and mean\nSCL was determined for the two countdown intervals of\ninterest.\nPS. Left and right PS (in pixels) was sampled at 30 Hz using\nan EyeTribe tracker system (theeyetribe.com; see also Ooms,\nDupont, Lapon, & Popelka, 2015) that was located directly\nunderneath the monitor on which the visual stimuli (faces)\nwere presented. Before each run, participants performed a\n9-point calibration procedure. The data from the EyeTribe\nwere collected using the PyGaze plugin (Dalmaijer, Math\u00f4t,\n& Van der Stigchel, 2014) for OpenSesame (Math\u00f4t, Schreij,\n& Theeuwes, 2012). Samples in which pupil diameter was\nrecorded as 0.0 (reflecting eye blinks) were dropped from the\nanalysis, as were values in which pupil diameter changed by\nmore than 1 pixel between consecutive samples. The left\u00ad\nright average pupil diameter for each system was used, and\naverages were determined for the two countdown intervals of\ninterest.\nProcedure\nThe experiment took place either at Utrecht University (The\nNetherlands) for the civilian group or the Oranjekazerne\narmy base (Schaarsbergen, The Netherlands) for the military\ngroup. After their arrival at the experimental location, the\nparticipant and the confederate \"participant\" were welcomed\nby the experimenter and guided to the experimental room. At\nboth locations, the windows in the experimental rooms were\nblinded (to exclude direct sunlight), and only artificial light-\ning was used. A notebook computer was used to present the\nvisual stimuli (VAS scales, the SSST sentences and counters,\nand the facial images), generate time stamps, and record the\neye tracking data. The same experimental setup was used at\nboth locations. The experimenter explained the participants\nthat their task was to sit still in front of a laptop screen and\nread the different messages that would be presented, each\nfollowed by a counter counting down from 60 to 0 s. They\nwere told that one of the messages could entail a task that\nthey were required to carry out after the subsequent counter\nhad reached 0. The participants were not informed about the\nexact nature of the experiment or that it involved singing out\nloud. Subsequently, the participant and the confederate both\nfilled out an informed consent form and the demographic\nquestionnaire. The experimental leader then appointed the\nreal participant as the one to start (since he \"happened\" to\nhave the lowest participant number on his informed consent\nform), seated him in front of the laptop and attached the\nphysiological sensors. The confederate was asked to wait for\nhis turn and was seated on a chair visible from the partici-\npant's periphery. Then the electrodes for the ECG and skin\nconductance signals were attached to the participant.\nParticipants used a chin rest such that their eyes were at a\ndistance of 43 cm from the center of the stimulus display.\nThe eyetracker was calibrated, and the experimental leader\nsat down behind the participant.\nThen the actual experiment started. First, the participant\nreported his current stress level. Next, he rated the trustwor-\nthiness of five consecutively presented male faces. The five\nfaces were randomly picked from the total set of 10 neutral\nfaces selected for this study, and presented on the screen until\nthe participant entered his response. Then the SSST started\nby presenting seven neutral sentences in random order for 5\ns each, followed by a countdown interval from 60 to 0 s. The\neighth sentence stated the request to sing a song aloud after\nthe following countdown interval. At the end of that interval,\nthe message \"Please start singing\" appeared. After 10 s, this\nmessage was replaced by the message \"You can stop singing\nnow.\" Immediately after the singing interval, the participant\nwas asked to rate the trustworthiness of five neutral male\nfaces (different from the ones shown before the SSST), and\nthe stress experienced during the final (eighth) countdown\ninterval of the SSST (just before singing). During the entire\nexperiment, both the experimental leader and confederate sat\nquietly on their designated places.\nIn the debriefing, the researcher explained the aim of the\nexperiment and asked the participant whether he had sus-\npected that the other participant was a confederate. In total,\n84 out of 89 participants stated that they had actually believed\nthat the confederate participant was a genuine participant.\nData Analysis\nFor all statistical analyses, a probability level of p < .05 was\nconsidered to be statistically significant. The dependent vari-\nables of this study were as follows: the physiological mea-\nsurements of HR, SCL, and PS; the facial trustworthiness\nmeasurements; and the perceived stress levels. For each of\nthese dependent variables, we tested whether there was a pre-\nversus poststressor difference (i.e., a within-participants test\nof stress response) and whether these differences were the\nsame for both groups of participants (between-participants\ntest). We also tested whether the baselines (i.e., prestressor\nvalues) and poststressor values differed between groups.\nResults\nPerceived Stress\nFigure 2 shows the mean subjective stress level for the civil-\nian and army participants, as experienced before the SSST\nand during the SSST stress interval. Paired t tests showed\nthat the perceived stress levels were indeed significantly\nhigher during the SSST stress interval than before the SSST,\n6 SAGE Open\ntest showed that the mean perceived stress level before the\nSSST did not differ significantly between the army and civil-\nmean perceived stress level during the stress interval was\nsignificantly lower in the army group than in the civilian\nhypothesis (H1) that army personnel is more resilient against\nacute stress than civilians. Due to the trend of a lower stress\nlevel before the SSST in the army group, an independent t\ntest on the subjective stress response to the SSST (i.e., the\nincrease of stress) between civilian and army participants\nThus, the significantly lower perceived stress level during\nthe SSST as reported by army participants compared with\ncivilians seems to reflect a combination of lower overall sub-\njective stress levels and a smaller stress response.\nFacial Trustworthiness Judgments\nFigure 3 shows the mean facial trustworthiness ratings (on a\nVAS scale ranging from 0 to 100) for the civilian and army\nparticipants, both before and after the SSST. Paired t tests\nshowed that mean perceived facial trustworthiness was sig-\nnificantly lower after the SSST than before, both for civil-\n(H2) that acute social stress negatively biases facial trustwor-\nthiness judgments. An independent t test showed that mean\nperceived facial trustworthiness did not differ significantly\nbetween the army and civilian groups, both before the SSST,\nour present results do not support our hypothesis (H3) that\narmy personnel is less susceptible than civilians for stress-\nrelated negative bias in facial trustworthiness judgments.\nHR\nFigure 4a shows the mean HR (in beats/min) over each of the\neight 60-s countdown intervals of the SSST, for civilian and\narmy participants separately. Paired t tests showed that the\nmean HR during the SSST stress (eighth) countdown interval\nwas significantly higher than the mean HR during the pre-\nceding last (seventh) neutral countdown interval, both for\nsuccessfully induced stress in both groups. An independent t\ntest showed that the mean HR during the last neutral SSST\ninterval did not differ significantly between the army and\narmy group had a significantly lower mean HR than the\ncivilian group during the SSST stress interval, t(59) = -2.44,\np = .01, d = .64. To compare the HR response with the SSST\nbetween civilian and army participants, we computed for\nboth groups the difference between the mean HR values over\nthe SSST stress interval and the last neutral SSST countdown\ninterval. An independent t test showed that the increase in\nHR in response to the SSST was significantly lower for army\nparticipants than for civilian participants, t(59) = 2.56, p =\n0.01, d = .67, supporting our hypothesis (H1) that army per-\nsonnel is more resilient against acute stress than civilians.\nSkin Conductance\nFigure 4b shows the mean SCL (in \u00b5S) over each of the eight\n60-s countdown intervals of the SSST, for both civilian and\narmy participants.

An independent t test showed that that the increase in\nSCL in response to the SSST was significantly lower for army\nparticipants than for civilian participants, t(59) = 14.13, p =\n.00, d = 3.68. Note that the latter test is less sensitive for the\nlarge variations between participants usually found in SCL.\nThis finding supports our hypothesis (H1) that army personnel\nis more resilient against acute stress than civilians.\nPS\nFigure 4c shows the mean PS (in pixels) over each of the\neight 60-s countdown intervals of the SSST, for both civilian\nand army participants. Paired t tests showed that the mean PS\nduring the SSST stress (eighth) countdown interval was\nsignificantly larger than the mean PS during the preceding\nlast (seventh) neutral countdown interval, both for civilians,\np = .000, d = 1.67, again indicating stress in both groups. An\nindependent t test showed that the mean PS did not differ sig-\nnificantly between the army and civilian groups, both during\n= .21. An independent t test on the increase in the mean PS in\nresponse to the SSST also did not differ significantly between\nHowever, and as shown in Figure 4c, there is a trend for larger\npoststress PS values and larger increases from the last neutral\ncountdown interval to the stress interval for civilians com-\npared with army participants. These trends reached signifi-\ncance when all participants with valid PS data (37 civilian and\n38 army participants) were included. Thus, although the mean\nPS results of the currently examined selection do not support\nour hypothesis (H1) that army personnel is more resilient\nagainst acute stress than civilians, incorporating more partici-\npants leads to findings that agree with this hypothesis.\nRelation Between Facial Trustworthiness and\nStress Response\nWe also investigated whether any of the stress response mea-\nsures in this study (HR, SCL, PS, and subjective stress\nresponses) were associated with the decrease in perceived\nfacial trustworthiness, using Pearson's product\u00admoment cor-\nrelation coefficient. The results are listed in Table 1. For civil-\nians, there was a significant negative correlation between HR\nresponse and facial trustworthiness: A larger increase in HR\nwas associated with a stronger decrease in perceived facial\ntrustworthiness. All other correlations were not significant.\nRelation Between Age and Stress Response\nOur military participants were somewhat older than our\ncivilian participants. To test whether age predicts any of the\nstress response correlates measured in this study, we\nFigure 4.

The results\n(listed in Table 2) showed that none of the correlations were\nsignificant. This suggests that the stronger stress responses\nwe found for the civilian than for the military group cannot\nbe attributed to the difference in age between both groups.\nDiscussion and Conclusion\nStress Response\nIn this study, we tested the hypothesis (H1) that (either\nthrough training or selection) army personnel is more resil-\nient to stress than civilians. We thereto measured the subjec-\ntive and physiological response of army and military\nparticipants to acute social stress.\nWe used a slightly modified version of the SSST procedure\nto induce acute stress. The results show that the levels of per-\nceived stress, HR, SCL, and PS were all significantly raised\nduring the SSST stress interval compared with their baseline\nlevels as measured over the last neutral SSST interval, both for\ncivilian and army participants. This indicates that the modified\nSSST successfully induced stress in all participants.\nThe baseline levels of all physiological and subjective mea-\nsures were statistically the same for the army and civilian\ngroups. However, compared with the civilian group, army par-\nticipants reported significantly less perceived stress during the\nSSST, and showed significantly attenuated HR and SCL\nresponses to the SSST. There was no significant difference\nbetween both groups in their PS response to the SSST when\nthe current selection of participants was considered, but the\ntrend for an attenuated stress response in PS for the army\ngroup became significant when including more participants.\nOverall, our results support our hypothesis (H1) that army per-\nsonnel is more resilient to stress, both subjectively and physi-\nologically. The fact that these results were found using a social\nstressor with little resemblance to a common military stressor\nsuggests that the observed stress resilience is quite general.\nOur current finding that the physiological (HR, SCL, and\nPS) response to the SSST of the military was attenuated with\nrespect to the response of the civilian participants agrees\nwith a study by of Li, Duan, and Guo (2017). They found that\nHR and blood pressure of people with high- and low charac-\nter strength varied in a similar way in response to a TSST,\nwhich is another social stressor, involving preparing and giv-\ning a speech for an unsupportive audience. Thus, it appears\nthat resilience or character strength dampens the response to\na stressor but does not completely suppress it.\nFacial Trustworthiness\nOur results show that both army and civilian participants\nrated the perceived facial trustworthiness of neutral faces\nsignificantly lower after experiencing the SSST. Thus, the\npresent results support our hypothesis (H2) that acute social\nstress negatively biases facial trustworthiness judgments.\nThis agrees with the recent finding that higher state anxiety\ncan cause a negative bias in judging ambiguous facial expres-\nsions (Attwood et al., 2017). The effect of the stressor on\nmean perceived facial trustworthiness did not differ signifi-\ncantly between the army and civilian groups. Hence, this\nfinding does not support our hypothesis (H3) that army per-\nsonnel is less susceptible than civilians for stress-related\nnegative bias in facial trustworthiness judgments.\nIt appears surprising that both groups showed a similar\ndecrease in facial trustworthiness in response to the social\nstressor, although they experienced different levels of stress as\nindicated by the physiological and subjective measures. In\naccordance with this, we only found a modest link between the\nstress response and the decrease in facial trustworthiness\nthrough the correlational analyses--there was only a correla-\ntion between the decrease in facial trustworthiness and the\nincrease in HR for civilians. This may be caused by the fact\nthat the faces were judged only after the stress interval had\nended. This was done to not reduce the stress through a double\ntask and not to confound the physiological measures of stress\nwith body movement related to the judging. However, the\ndownside of this methodological decision is that at the time of\njudgment, stress may have already partially passed resulting in\na less clear relation between stress and trustworthiness judg-\nments, and a weaker effect of stress on trustworthiness rating\nin general. Another possible reason for the modest link\nbetween stress response and decrease trustworthiness rating is\nrelated to the observation that even mild acute uncontrollable\nstress can rapidly and significantly inhibit prefrontal cognitive\nfunctions (Arnsten, 2009), resulting in a biased evaluation of\nneutral faces (Lapate et al., 2017). If even a mild amount of\nstress suffices to compromise facial trustworthiness judg-\nments, this could explain our present finding that acute stress\nreduced the perceived facial trustworthiness of neutral faces to\na similar degree for both military and civilians. Moreover, this\nsuggests that stressful experiences in general may negatively\nbias facial trustworthiness judgments, independent of their\nintensity. Follow-up research is required to investigate whether\nstress affects trustworthiness in such an all or none way, or\nTable 2.

HR = heart rate; SCL = skin conductance level; PS = pupil size;\nVAS = visual analog scale.\nToet et al. 9\nwhether our finding is related to the fact that trustworthiness\njudgment and the stress peak did not exactly coincide in time.\nFuture Directions\nOur subjective and physiological results indicate that the\narmy group was more resilient to stress than the civilian\ngroup. However, this study does not answer the question\nwhether the observed differences are due to preexisting per-\nsonality characteristics between civilians and army person-\nnel or to military training and experience. Thus, future\nstudies will need to examine, using within-subjects designs,\nindividuals prior to and after military training.\nNeutral faces are probably more profoundly evaluated in\nself-related contexts than in contexts that have no direct per-\nsonal relevance (Schwarz et al., 2013). Hence, the effects\nobserved here may become more evident when the faces that\nare to be judged have a direct relation with the observer.\nWe did not measure personality factors like trait anxiety\n(State-Trait Anxiety Inventory [STAI]: Spielberger, Gorsuch,\n& Lushene, 1970). However, previous studies found that expe-\nrience is a more powerful predictor of stress response than psy-\nFurther studies may also focus on mitigating effects of\nstress on social judgments. It is known that the salience of an\nemotion's source mitigates the effects of incidental emotions\non trust (Dunn & Schweitzer, 2005). Hence, individuals may\ncurtail the influence of stress on their social judgments by\nheightening their awareness of the source of their stress.\nOur current finding that there appears to be a robust spill-\nover of stress on facial trustworthiness judgments suggests\nthe need to develop a combined social training and stress\nawareness program (possibly integrated with biofeedback)\nfor the military (and other people working in stressful condi-\ntions, such as police, firefighters, and first responders) to\nmitigate these undesired side effects.\nSummary\nCompared with civilians, army participants reported signifi-\ncantly less stress and showed significantly attenuated HR,\nskin conductance, and a trend of PS responses to a social\nstressor. These results indicate higher stress resilience in the\narmy compared with the civilian group. For both groups, per-\nceived facial trustworthiness decreased after experiencing\nthe stressor, suggesting that a stressor can influence in prin-\nciple unrelated social judgments based on facial information.\nThese findings suggest that an integrated social training and\nstress awareness program (possibly with biofeedback) for\npeople who need to maintain social contact while working in\nstressful conditions might be beneficial.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\nAfshar, H., Roohafza, H.
