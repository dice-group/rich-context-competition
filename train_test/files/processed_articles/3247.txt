At the same time, financial institutions were heavily\nexposed to the mortgage market when the crisis started. Figure 1 displays the rela-\ntionship between mortgages and charge-off rates in the US. As we can see, mortgages\nincreased strongly as long as charge-off rates were low. Therefore, the banks' exposure\nwas at its peak when the bubble burst and charge-off rates suddenly increased strongly.\nAs a result, many banks suffered high losses or even failed. In 2009 the FDIC recorded\nOne reason for this was that financial institutions underestimated the risk associated\nwith mortgages. The development of the lending standards of banks and their the\nmortgage supply1 indicates that financial institutions base their risk models on the\npast performance of mortgages rather than on the main economic risk drivers. Among\nothers, these risk drivers are the income of borrowers and the development of house\nprices.\nAnother reason for the extent of the crisis was that also existing banking regula-\ntion and capital requirements did not adequately capture the build-up of risks in the\nmortgage market and the resulting systemic impact. As a reaction, we see increasing\ninternational efforts (especially by the Financial Stability Board, the BIS and the IMF)\nto enhance macroprudential instruments in order to identify and monitor systemic risks\nand to limit the build-up and/or the impact of these risks.2 The process is still ongo-\ning; however, key methodologies to identify systemic risks are constructing aggregated\nindicators for systemic imbalances like the credit-to-GDP ratio and conducting macro\nstress tests. The most prominent macroprudential instrument is the countercyclical\ncapital buffer, under which banks have to hold more capital in boom phases and can\nuse the buffer to cover losses in a downturn phase. A further instrument is the limi-\ntation of loan-to-value and loan-to-income ratios, which are important parameters for\nbanks to influence the risk profile of their mortgage loan portfolio.\nVarious papers evaluate the driving forces behind mortgage defaults and the result-\ning losses. Campbell and Cocco (2011), for example, examine default risks and develop\n1Lown and Morgan (2006) show that lending standards (as measured by the Loan Officer Opinion\nSurvey of the Federal Reserve) are a key driver of loans.\na model where households maximize their discounted future utility from consumption\nand housing. They finance their house by a mortgage and decide in each period whether\nor not to default on the mortgage. The authors assume that the mortgage lender has\nno recourse to the defaulter's income or savings. Following their model, households de-\ncide to default when their home equity turns negative, meaning the value of the house\nbecomes smaller then the outstanding mortgage loan. However, the authors show that\nif borrowing constrains are less binding (due to a higher income), households might\ndecide not to default even when home equity is negative.\nDeng, Yongheng, Quigley, and Van Order (2000) argue that a mortgage borrower\nhas two separate options: a prepayment option and a default option. The authors\ndevelop a unified model of these two options and show that the simultaneity of the two\noptions can help to explain borrower behavior. However, since in many countries there\nare prepayment penalties and lenders have recourse to defaulters' income, the results\nare mainly relevant for some US states like California.\nHaughwout, Peach, and Tracy (2008) evaluate possible reasons for the strong in-\ncrease in early mortgage defaults in the US in 2006 and 2007. In their empirical\nestimation they use credit risk variables like loan-to-value ratios and debt service-to-\nincome ratios as well as variables that capture the economic conditions like regional\nunemployment rates or house prices. Their results indicate that both bad credit stan-\ndards and bad economic conditions contributed to the increase in defaults and that\nthe economic conditions had the largest impact. However, the empirical model only\npredicts less than half of the strong increase in early defaults after 2006.\nWhile most studies focus on default rates of mortgages, Qi and Yang (2009) evaluate\ndifferent influence factors of the loss given default. Their empirical study is based on\na large pre-crisis loan level data set and indicates that the current loan-to-value ratio\nis the single most important determinant of the loss given default.\nThe aim of this paper is to develop a theoretical model of mortgage loss rates,\nmeaning the product of default probabilities and loss given defaults. Furthermore, the\nmodel serves as a basis for macroprudential instruments like countercyclical buffers.\nThe development of a foundation for these macroprudential instruments is the main\ncontribution of this paper.\nIn the theoretical model, banks provide mortgages to a priori identical households.\nA heterogenous development of the households' income and house prices leads to the de-\nfault of some households in the following period. In order to demonstrate the empirical\nrelevance of the model, we calibrate it for two countries that experienced pronounced\nreal estate crises within the past 25 years but had a different development: the US and\nSwitzerland. The results of the calibration are used to demonstrate the ability of the\nmodel to estimate the impact of stress scenarios on mortgage losses, to calculate the\nsize and development of countercyclical buffers, and to set standards for risk weights\non mortgages with different loan-to-values and loan-to-incomes.\nThe paper is organized as follows: in the next section we develop the theoretical\nmodel, in section 3 we calibrate the model, section 4 shows potential applications of the\nmodel for macroprudential instruments, and section 5 offers some concluding remarks.\n2 The Model\nIn this section we develop a theoretical two-period model that enables us to calculate\nloss rates for mortgage loans. The basic setting of the model is very similar to Hott\n(2011): in period t = 1 banks provide mortgages to a priori identical households. In\nperiod t = 2 each household receives a random labor income and defaults if this labor\nincome plus the value of the house is too low to fulfill the mortgage duties. In contrast\nto Hott (2011), however, we assume that the constant loan-to-value of mortgages is\nless then 100%. In addition, we consider unemployment, maintenance costs for houses,\nforeclosure costs, and a heterogenous development of house prices. By introducing\nthese additional features, the model becomes more realistic and, hence, more suitable\nfor describing actual loss rates on mortgages.\n2.1 Basic Assumptions\nThere are S ex ante identical houses and in period t = 1 the price of house i is\nPi\n, where i=1,...,S. Therefore, the value of the entire housing stock is SP1\n.\nFurther, we assume that houses are subject to depreciation and that owning a house\nleads to maintenance costs. The sum of the depreciation and the maintenance costs\n(as a fraction of the house price) is assumed to be 1 >   0.\nIn period t = 2 the price of house i is assumed to be uniformly distributed between\n, where P2\nis the average house price in t = 2 and  > 0 is the\nmaximum relative deviation from this average price. Therefore, in t = 2 the value of\nthe entire housing stock is SP2\n.\nIn period t = 1 banks provide mortgages to households at the interest rate m1\nSince banks cannot ex ante differentiate between different households and different\nhouses, this mortgage rate is identical for each household. The loan-to-value (LTV)\nis the constant l, where 0 < l < 1.3 Therefore, in period t = 1 the amount of all\nmortgages is lSP1\n. The maturity of each mortgage loan is assumed to be one year.\nThis implies that households have to refinance their mortgage every year.\nWhen a mortgage borrower defaults, the house goes into the ownership of the bank.\nWe assume that the foreclosure and change in ownership causes costs. These foreclosure\ncosts are assumed to be a fixed fraction  of the amount of the mortgage. We further\nassume that the bank has recourse to the defaulter's income.4\nThere are N ex ante identical households. For simplicity, we assume that N = S.\nEach of them buys the same fraction of the housing stock: S/N = 1. It uses its entire\nwealth to finance the fraction (1 - l) of its housing investment. To finance the rest of\nthe investment, each household takes out a mortgage in the amount of lP1\n.\nOn the one hand, in period t = 2 each household bears depreciation and main-\ntenance costs of lP1\n, where  =  /l. In addition, each household has to pay the\nmortgage rate and has to pay back the mortgage: (1 + m1\n. Hence, its total ex-\npenses are: (1 +  + m1\n. Further we assume that depreciation and maintenance\ncosts are senior to the mortgage payments.\nOn the other hand, household i owns a house which can be sold at the price Pi\n,\nwhere Pi\nis uniformly distributed between (1 - )P2\n. In addition, we as-\nsume that in t = 2 household i receives a labor income Y i\nthat is uniformly distributed\nbetween zero and Y2\n. With probability u2\na household becomes unemployed and re-\nceives an income of zero. In reality, in most countries the minimum (transfer) income\n3Iacoviello (2005) and Kiyotaki and Moore (1997) also assume fixed LTV ratios when evaluating\nthe link between real estate prices and output. Campbell and Cocco (2011) show that in the US, LTV\n4This might not be the case in some US states. However, following the results of Campbell and\nCocco (2011), income also matters if there is no recourse. In addition, as we will see, our model\nprovides relatively good results also for the US (see section 3).\nis greater then zero. However, since we do not consider consumption expenditures, we\nassume that the minimum income is used for an autonomous consumption and can,\ntherefore, not be used for mortgage payments.\nHousehold i becomes insolvent in t = 2 if:\nPi\n+ Y i\nor\nY i\n- Pi\nThe right-hand side of equation (1) is also known as the imputed rent for housing.\nThis imputed rent is in line with the assumptions of many other studies on real estate\nmelberg, Mayer, and Sinai (2005), and Hott and Monnin (2008), for example, use very\nsimilar factors to define imputed rents.\n2.2 Calculation of Loss Rates\nTo calculate loss rates on mortgage loans, we first calculate the default probability\n(PD) and the loss given default (LGD) of mortgages independently. The expected\nloss rate is given by the multiplication of the PD and the LGD.\nThe calculation of the PD and the LGD depends strongly on the development\nof house prices in t = 2. There are two extreme cases. In the first case, house prices\nincrease so strongly that no household defaults (PD = 0). This is the case if (1-)P2\n\n. In the other extreme case, house prices fall so strongly that all\nhouseholds default (PD = 1). This is the case if (1+)P2\n. Both\ncases are not very realistic and will, therefore, not be considered. The intermediate\ncase can be divided into several subcases as well. However, we will only consider the\nfollowing case as the relevant case:5\n\nand\n5The calibration of the model confirms that this is the relevant case. See also Hott (2011).\nIn this range, neither households with the best performing houses (Pi\n)\nnor households with the highest labor income (Y i\n) default. However, there are\nalways at least some households that default.\nFigure 2 illustrates which households default and which stay solvent. As we can see,\nfor a household with a labor income greater than [(1 +  + m1\n], the\nprobability of a default is zero. Therefore, the probability that an employed household\nhas an income that leads to a positive default probability Pr(PD > 0|employed) is:\nPr(PD > 0|employed) =\nIf a household is unemployed, this probability is one.\nFor households that can default (PD > 0), the default probability decreases with\nlabor income. For an unemployed household with zero labor income (Y i\nprobability of default is:\nPD(Y i\nUnder the condition that the labor income of an employed household is in a range where\nthere is a positive default probability, the default probability is 50% of PD(Y i\nMultiplied by the probability Pr(PD > 0|employed) from equation (3) we obtain the\ndefault probability of an employed household:\nPD(employed) =\nThe unconditional PD is given by:\n6Since each income in this range is equally likely.\nAs we can see, the PD depends positively on the unemployment rate (u2\n), the depre-\nciation and maintenance costs (), the LTV, the mortgage rate (m1\n), the house price\n), and the maximum deviation from the average house price in t = 2\n().7 It depends negatively on the house price increase (P2\n) and on income (Y2\n).\nNote that condition (2) assures that (3) to (6) lie between 0 and 1.\nThere are two factors that have an influence on losses for a bank when a mortgage\nborrower defaults. Firstly, the difference between the outstanding mortgage (lP1\n) plus\ninterest, depreciation and maintenance costs8 ((+m1\n), and the value of the house\nin period 2 (Pi\n) plus the income of the house (Y i\n). The second factor are the foreclosure\ncosts (lP1\n). As a result, the loss given default (LGD) of a mortgage to household i\nis:\n, Y i\n) =\n- Pi\n- Y i\nFor an unemployed household with zero income, the LGD can vary between  and\n] + . Since each of the LGD in this range is equally\nlikely, the expected LGD of an unemployed household is:\nThe LGD of a mortgage to an employed household decreases linearly with the labor\nincome of the borrower. It varies between  for Y i\n(the maximum income for a PD greater than zero) and LGD(Y i\n= 0) for an employed\nhousehold with zero income. As we have seen in section 2.2.1, the different LGDs are\nnot equally likely, however. The probability that a household defaults varies between\nzero and the result of equation (4). The expected LGD of a mortgage to an employed\nhousehold is therefore:\nLGD(employed) =\n7The relationship between  and PD depends on the development of the house price. In the\nrelevant range, however, PD/ is positive.\n8Depreciation and maintenance costs have to be borne by the household or the bank. However, in\nboth cases the loss for the bank would be the same.\nThis LGD depends positively on , , m1\n, l, , and P1\n, it depends negatively on P2\nand it is independent of the maximum income Y2\n.\nThe expected loss rate in period t = 2 (EL2\n) is given by the weighted average of the\nproduct of the PD and LGD for unemployed and employed households:\n+ \nAs we can see, the expected loss rate depends negatively on income (Y2\n) and on the\nhouse price increase (P2\n) and it depends positively on the unemployment rate\n), the foreclosure costs (), the house price level (P1\n), the loan-to-value (l), and the\nmortgage rate (m1\n). Furthermore, in the relevant range9 the expected loss rate also\ndepends positively on the heterogeneity of the house price development ().\nThese results are in line with the usual empirical findings. Deng et al. (2000), for\nexample, find empirical evidence that increasing interest rates and decreasing house\nprices increase the probability of default. Furthermore, the authors find evidence that\na higher LTV leads to higher defaults. Qi and Yang (2009) examine defaults in the\nUS mortgage market and find the current LTV is the most important determinant\nof the loss given default of a mortgage. Lambrecht, Perraudi, and Satchell (1997)\nexamine the UK mortgage market and find a positive relationship between interest\nrates and default probabilities and a negative relationship between income and default\nprobabilities. Surprisingly, the authors also find a negative relationship between the\nLTV and default probabilities. One explanation for this finding could be that high\nLTV mortgages are only provided to households with low credit risk.\n3 Model Calibration\nTo examine the empirical relevance of the model, we calibrate it for two different\ncountries: the US and Switzerland. Both countries have experienced a major real estate\ncrisis within the past 25 years. However, the overall development of the two mortgage\nmarkets was rather different. Besides an in sample calibration we also calibrate the\ncrisis development out of sample, i.e. using only data up to 2005 Q4.\nAccording to equation (10) we need data on mortgage rates (mt\n), house prices (Pt\n),\nunemployment rates (ut\n), and the maximum household income (Yt\n) to calibrate loss\nrates. The maximum household income is calculated as (2GDPt\n)/[(1 - ut\n)Nt\n] and by\nusing nominal GDP and population data (Nt\n). To compare the resulting theoretical\nexpected loss rates with reality, we also need data on actual loss rates (Lt\n). The\nfrequency of most data series is quarterly. Annual population data and the annual\nloss rates for Switzerland are transformed into quarterly data by linear interpolation.\nTable 1 provides a brief description of the data, the sources, and transformations.\n3.2 Parameter Values\nAccording to equation (10) we need parameter values for the LTV (l), the heterogeneity\nof the house price development (), the depreciation and maintenance rate (), and the\nforeclosure costs () for both countries. In addition, we need a conversion factor \nto adjust the level of GDP to the house price level (Yt\n)Nt\n]).\nFirstly, house prices (index values) and GDP are not expressed in the same unit and,\nsecondly, Y reflects only the (constant) fraction of the income that is available for\nhousing expenditures.\nThe first parameter is the loan-to-value (l). According to Green and Wachter (2005),\nin the US the average LTV is 75% but it can go up to 97%. For the calibration we use\nl = 0.75 for the average LTV in the US. In Switzerland a mortgage usually has a LTV\nof 67% and it can go up to 100%. We use l = 0.67 for the calibration. To capture the\nvariation of the loan-to-value in both countries, we consider the difference between the\nmaximum and the average LTV in the heterogeneity of the house price development\n().\nThe second parameter is the heterogeneity of the house price development ().\nWhen calibrating a mortgage model for the UK, Miles (2005) uses 12.5% as the stan-\ndard deviation of house price growth. Campbell and Cocco (2003) consider 11.5% when\nevaluating the US mortgage market. This would imply around 22% for our parameter\n.10 As already mentioned, we will also consider the difference between the maximum\nand the average LTV in the parameter . We assume that the difference between the\nmaximum and the average LTV is equal to three standard deviations of the LTV .\nTherefore, the add-on for  (maximum of a uniform distribution) is\n\n\ntimes the difference between the maximum and the average LTV . For the US the\nresulting  is 35%, and for Switzerland it is 41%.\nThe literature offers different estimates of the depreciation and maintenance rate.\nHarding, Rosenthal, and Sirmans (2006) estimate that the annual rate is between 2.4\nand 2.9 percent. McCarthy and Peach (2004) assume that the depreciation rate plus\nrepairs is 2.5 percent per year and Poterba (1992) assumes that the sum of depreciation\nand maintenance rate is four percent. For simplicity, we use  = 2.5% for each of the\ntwo countries. Therefore, we obtain  =  /l = 3.3% for the US and  =  /l = 3.7%\nfor Switzerland.\nForeclosure costs () involve legal fees, taxes, insurance, commissions etc. Although\nthese costs might vary between countries, for simplicity, we assume that they are 15%\nin both countries. This figure is based on anecdotal evidence from contacts with banks.\nThe fifth parameter is the conversion factor . For this parameter we do not have\nan a priori assumption (except that it is positive). Therefore, we chose a parameter\nvalue for  that solves the following minimization problem:\nmin\n\nT\n[ELt\n- Lt+k\nsubject to  > 0. While T - k is equal to the end of the data sample (2010 Q4 for\nour out of sample calibration. The parameter k reflects the lead of the theoretical\nseries compared to the actual series expressed as the number of quarters. The lead is\nderived by looking at the maximum cross correlation of the two series. The choice of\nthe different parameter values is summarized in Table 2.\n10The maximum deviation of the uniformly distributed heterogeneity of the house price development\nis\n\n3 times the standard deviation.\n3.3 Calibration Results\nFigure 3 displays the development of actual (Lt\n) and theoretical expected (ELt\n) in and\nout of sample loss rates for the US and Switzerland. As we can see, the fit between\nactual and theoretical in sample loss rates is quite good. In particular the model is able\nto mirror the high loss rates during the crisis episodes: The current real estate crisis\nin the US and the crisis in the early 1990s in Switzerland. According to Table 2, the\ntheoretical expected losses have a lead of k = 4 quarters. This reflects that in reality\nit can take several periods until a bank knows how high the losses from a defaulted\nmortgage really are.\nFor Switzerland, the difference between the in and out of sample expected loss rates\nis negligible. For the US, however, we can observe a difference. This is no surprise,\nsince charge-off rates in the US experienced an unprecedented strong increase after\nthe end of 2005 and, therefore, the end of the considered data for the out of sample\ncalibration. Nevertheless, even the out of sample calibration of the crisis leads to a\nrelatively good fit with the actual development.\n4 Macroprudential Applications of the Model\nOur model and its calibration give us information about the impact of macroeco-\nnomic developments on mortgage losses. This information can be used as an input for\nmacroprudential instruments. Important examples of macruprudential instruments are\nconducting stress tests, introducing countercyclical buffers, and setting risk weights for\nmortgages with different loan-to-value and loan-to-income ratios.\nAs a reaction to the recent crisis and in order to identify systemic risks, banking\nsupervisors and central banks are conducting more and more stress tests. In theses\nstress tests banks are asked to calculate the impact of an adverse combination of\nmacroeconomic shocks on their profits and losses and, therefore, on their capital needs.\nOur model can provide us with an alternative view on the impact of an adverse\nscenario on a macro level. To demonstrate this, we calculate the aggregated impact of\nthe adverse scenarios from the 2009 Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP)\nof the Federal Reserve Board for the US and the adverse scenario from the 2011 EU-\nwide stress test of the European Banking Authority (EBA) for the UK.11 The scenarios\nare summarized in Table 3.\nThe impact of the scenarios on expected losses (ELt\n) is presented in Figure 4. The\nsolid (SCAP) and the broken grey (EBA) lines indicate that both scenarios lead to an\nincrease in expected losses. As we can see, the impact of the SCAP scenario is much\nstronger then the impact of the EBA scenario. This is not a surprise since the assumed\nGDP and house price declines are much higher. Another noteworthy outcome is that\nboth scenarios have a stronger impact on expected losses in the US than on expected\nlosses in Switzerland. The main reason for this is that we assume a higher LTV for the\nCompared to the estimates of the Fed with regard to the impact of the SCAP sce-\nnario on US banks, our expected loss rates are relatively low. While the Fed estimates\nindicate an aggregated two year loss rate of 7 to 8.5%,12 our model indicates only 5%\nwith an annual maximum of 3.3%. One reason for this might be that we are calculating\nthe expected losses under an adverse scenario and not adverse losses under this sce-\nnario. According to Table 2, the difference between our estimate and the Fed estimate\nis about three times the average difference between the expected and actual loss rates.\n4.2 Countercyclical Buffers\nWith a countercyclical buffer, banks have to hold more capital when imbalances in the\ncredit market are building up. The aim of this additional requirement is that banks\nhave a higher capital buffer which they can use when the bubble bursts. Therefore, the\ncountercyclical buffer should compensate for the additional risk that arises from the\nincreasing imbalances. A further potential effect of the countercyclical buffer is that it\ncan help to lean against emerging bubbles.\nThe Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS, 2010) proposes monitoring\nthe ratio of credit to GDP and the deviation from its trend to assess the phase of the\ncycle and the build-up of the imbalances. The size of the buffer should then increase\nwith this indicator between zero and a (more or less arbitrary) maximum buffer size.\nIn our model the credit (or mortgage) volume is defined as a constant fraction l of\nthe house price Pt\nmultiplied by the housing stock S = N. GDP, on the other hand,\n11The EBA stress test included scenarios for all EU countries. However, we only consider the\nscenario for the UK.\nis given by (1 - ut\n)NYt\n/2. Hence, the ratio of credit to GDP (it\n) is given by:\nit\n=\n)NYt\n=\n)Yt\nAs an indicator for imbalances we take the difference between it\nand its average iaverage.\nTo determine the size of the countercyclical buffer, we look at the impact of an above-\naverage it\non expected losses (ELt\n). We rewrite equation (10) to:\n= ut\n+ \n+it\nwhere Rt-1\nand 1 + wt\n= Pt\n. The impact of an above-average it\non expected losses is then given by:\nbuffersize = ELt\n=\n(it\n- iaverage)(1 - ut\nCapital requirements should make sure that banks hold enough capital to cover losses\nin stress events. As a stress scenario for the capital requirements we take the strongest\nhistorical drop in real estate prices in combination with the average mortgage rate or\nRt\n, respectively. According to equation (14), the unemployment rate has a negative\neffect on the buffer size. One reason for this is that the loan-to-income (LTI) is only\nimportant for households that are employed. With a lower unemployment rate the\nLTI is relevant for a higher fraction of the population. Another reason is that, given\na level of GDP, the income of an employed household has to be higher the higher the\nunemployment rate is. Hence, for the stress scenario we take the average unemployment\nrate. The scenarios for the two countries are summarized in Table 4.\nFigure 5 shows the evolution of the resulting buffer size. It is assumed (as in the\nBCBS proposal) that the buffer cannot be negative. As we can see, the countercyclical\nbuffer increases before the crises begin and loss rates increase. Hence, banks can use\nthe capital buffer to cover losses and the buffer requirements are gradually reduced to\nzero.\nThe maximum buffer size is about 0.47% of the mortgage volume in the US and\nabout 0.25% in Switzerland. Reasons for the higher buffer size in the US are the\nmore adverse scenario and a higher LTV but also a greater imbalance during the stress\nepisodes. In contrast to the BCBS proposal, our buffer is not based on risk-weighted\nassets but on loan volumes. If we assume average risk weights of about 35%, the buffer\nsize would reach a maximum value of about 1.34% in the US and about 0.71% in\nSwitzerland.\nThe loan-to-value and the loan-to-income are the most important parameters for banks\nto influence the risk profile of their mortgage loan book. According to equation (13),\nboth parameters have a positive effect on expected losses. Hence, risk weights for\ncapital requirements should increase with LTV and LTI.\nOur model can help to estimate to which extent risk weights should increase with\nboth parameters and how strong the tradeoff between both parameters is. Figure\n6 shows the impact of a change in LTV on expected losses for different LTI. These\nexpected losses are calculated according to equation (13). As in section 4.2 we consider\na stress scenario with the strongest historical drop in real estate prices and an average\ninterest rate level. Since the unemployment rate has a negative effect on expected\nlosses, we take the highest historical unemployment rate (US: 10.7%, Switzerland:\nAccording to Figure 6, expected losses are higher in the US than in Switzerland. The\nmain reason for this is that the US scenario assumes a much higher drop in real estate\nprices. In general, however, the relationship between LTV, LTI, and expected losses is\nvery similar: Expected losses increase with increasing LTV and with increasing LTI.\nIn addition, we can see that the impact of an increasing LTV is stronger when the LTI\nis higher. These effects should be reflected when risk weights for capital requirements\nfor mortgages loans are set.\n5 Conclusions\nIn this paper we develop a theoretical model of mortgage loss rates. Following the\nmodel, loss rates are positively influenced by the house price level, the unemployment\nrate, the loan-to-value, and interest rates. They are negatively influenced by the income\nlevel and the growth of house prices. The calibration of the model for the US and\nSwitzerland has demonstrated that it is well able to describe the overall development\nof the actual loss rates.\nPotential applications of the model are the calibration of loss rates under stress\nevents, the calculation of the size and development of countercyclical buffer, and the\nsetting of risk weights for different combinations of loan-to-value and loan-to-income.\nThe model has two main shortcomings: First, the maturity of mortgage loans\nis assumed to be one year. In reality, however, most mortgages have a much longer\nmaturity. Therefore, actual reactions to house price declines are smaller than predicted\nby the model when they are only temporary, but they can become larger when house\nprices decline over a longer period of time. A second shortcoming of the model is that\nall the parameters are assumed to be constant. In reality, especially the loan-to-value\ncan react to the market sentiment and the lending conditions of banks and can therefore\nvary over time. In spite of these shortcomings, however, the model is able to explain\nthe main developments of mortgage loss rates in the US and Switzerland. In addition,\nit can serve as a basis for various macruprudential instruments. Efforts to make the\nmodel more realistic should be aligned to the specific needs of its application.\nReferences\n[1] Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (2010). \"Countercyclical Capital Buffer\nProposal\".
