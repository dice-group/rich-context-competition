Current treatment for chronic hepatitis C with pegylated interferon (IFN)\nand ribavirin is associated with suboptimal responses and numerous adverse effects.\nA number of botanical products have been used to treat hepatic disorders.

The prevalence of antibodies\nto hepatitis C in the United States is approximately\n1.6%, representing 4.1 million anti-HCV-positive\npersons, according to the National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey [1]. Chronic viral\nhepatitis infection can lead to cirrhosis, hepatic\ndecompensation (i.e., liver failure), hepatocellular\ncarcinoma (i.e., liver cancer), and death. Further,\nC-associated complications annually. End-stage\nliver disease due to chronic hepatitis C is the main\nindication for liver transplantation [2]. Current esti-\nmates suggest that there will be a continually\nincreasing disease burden, at least over the next\ncouple of decades, from hepatitis C and its compli-\ncations [2].\nWhile there have been some advances in the\ntreatment for chronic hepatitis C infection, thera-\npeutic options remain limited. Over the past two\ndecades, treatment has evolved from standard\ninterferon (IFN) monotherapy to current standard\nof care with pegylated IFN and ribavirin [3\u00ad5].\nApart from less than ideal response rates for most\nHCV genotype 1 patients in the United States,\nthere is a more difficult issue of tolerance of ther-\napy. Both IFN and ribavirin have numerous side\neffects that are frequently not well-tolerated by\npatients; several studies estimate that up to 86% of\npatients are deferred from conventional IFN treat-\nment due to medical or psychiatric comorbidities\n[6\u00ad8]. Substantial numbers of patients with chronic\nHCV in the United States therefore do not receive\navailable therapies or are nonresponders to current\ntreatment regimens, due at least in part to the ina-\nbility to tolerate full therapy [3\u00ad5]. With the dearth\nof treatment options for such a common and seri-\nous disease, it is not surprising that both clinicians\nand patients have an interest in studying other\npotential therapies for treatment-resistant chronic\nHCV infection that may have a better side effect\nprofile.\nSilymarin, extracted from the milk thistle plant,\nSilybum marianum, is one of a variety of botanical\nproducts that have been used to treat hepatic disor-\nders, including chronic hepatitis C, B, and alcoholic\nliver disease [9\u00ad12]. Silymarin is primarily a mixture\nof at least six major isomeric flavonolignans and a\nfew flavonoids and is touted for its antioxidant\nproperties [13]. Data from the National Health\nInterview Survey (NHIS) from 2007 indicate that\n20% of the U.S. population uses botanical products\nregularly, and that silymarin use constitutes nearly\n5% of this product exposure [14].\nLimitations of current silymarin data\nAlthough largely in vitro evidence has accumulated\non silymarin and its putative antiviral, immu-\nnomodulatory, and antifibrotic properties, clinical\nstudies have not suggested a clinical benefit for sily-\nclinical studies of botanical products, including sily-\nmarin, that have been used for hepatic diseases\nrevealed a lack of consistency in botanical prepara-\ntions, dosing, clinical outcome measures, and\nlength of treatment. There was no firm evidence\nthat botanical products conferred clinical benefit in\nAs is common with clinical trials of all or most\nbotanical products, studies are limited by a lack of\nstandardization of the product to be tested and lack\nof pharmacokinetic and dosing data. In addition,\nthe outcome measures may not be comparable with\nthose used in other studies. Furthermore, informa-\ntion on duration of treatment and follow-up are\noften lacking. For clinical trials of conventional\npharmaceuticals, extensive preliminary preclinical\nand clinical studies (i.e., pharmacokinetics, dosing,\nand mechanistic studies) are undertaken early in\nproduct development, prior to studies testing effi-\ncacy, due to regulatory requirements of the U.S.\nFood and Drug Administration (FDA). Such data,\nhowever, typically are not required, or even availa-\nble, for most marketed botanical products, includ-\ning silymarin. Also, unlike conventional drugs,\nbotanicals are typically mixtures of uncharacterized\nconstituents; particular attention must be given to\nanalyzing all potentially active ingredients.\nTherefore, it is essential to perform early-phase test-\ning of botanical products to provide such critical\ninformation before embarking on large-scale clini-\ncal trials.\nIdentifying the silymarin\nmanufacturer\nPrior to issuing the request for applications (RFA)\nfor the clinical trials of silymarin in 2005 (Figure 1),\nthe U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), via the\nNational Center for Complementary and Alternative\nMedicine (NCCAM), issued a Notice of Opportunity\nfor Clinical Trial Collaboration to identify manu-\nfacturers of silymarin that would be interested in\ndonating product and placebo for proposed future\ntrials. The early identification of a manufacturer\nwas essential in developing a clinical trial for this\nbotanical product. Unlike conventional pharma-\nceuticals, there is considerable variability in com-\nposition and chemistry of marketed botanical\nproducts. Therefore, it was necessary to identify a\nmanufacturer that could provide appropriate prod-\nuct information. Moreover, as dietary supplements\nare marketed in the United States without require-\nments for standard chemistry, manufacturing and\ncontrols, or providing preclinical data to the FDA,\nthe manufacturer selected was expected to be will-\ning to work with both NIH and FDA to provide\nsuch information for silymarin.\nSilymarin manufacturers who responded to the\nNotice of Opportunity were requested to provide\nNIH/NCCAM information regarding their silyma-\nrin product as it was anticipated that a trial of sily-\nmarin for a chronic liver disease would require\napproval of an Investigational New Drug (IND)\napplication from the FDA; thus, product specifica-\ntions would have to comply with standard FDA\nrequirements. NIH/NCCAM selected the manufac-\nturer based on several components of the product\ninformation, including product chemistry, manu-\nfacturing and controls, preclinical data, clinical\ndata, information on regulatory filings, and the\nability to provide support for phased clinical trials.\nFollowing review of responses from the manufac-\nturers, the Legalon\u00ae 140 brand of silymarin mar-\nketed by Rottapharm|Madaus (Monza, Italy and\nCologne, Germany) was selected for the silymarin\ntrials.\nStudy organization\nAfter identifying the silymarin manufacturer, NIH/\nNCCAM issued an RFA in 2005 for Phase I/II trials of\nsilymarin for chronic liver disease (Figure 1) in order\nto assemble a consortium (the Silymarin in Non-\nalcoholic Steatohepatitis and C Hepatitis (SyNCH)\nStudy Group, Appendix). The National Institute\nof Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\n(NIDDK) also participated in the project. This Phase\nII multicenter trial was conducted with four clinical\ncenters and a data-coordinating center (DCC) in the\nUnited States. The steering committee for the con-\nsortium comprises the principal investigators from\nthe clinical centers, one of whom is the steering\ncommittee chair, and the DCC and two NIH project\nscientists (NIH/NCCAM and NIH/NIDDK). The\nsteering committee members designed and imple-\nmented the clinical trials of this consortium. A Data\nand Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) was estab-\nlished by NIH/NCCAM to provide trial oversight.\nInvestigational product\nLegalon\u00ae 140 is a milk thistle fruit extract (Silybum\nmarianum (L) Gaertn. (Asteraceae)) standardized to\nmg of silymarin per gelatin capsule (53% as\ntotal silibinin, quantified photometrically). A\nmg of dried\nextract of milk thistle fruits, or 140mg of silymarin,\nwhich is the presumed active ingredient, or 108mg\nof silymarin quantified as silibinin by high-pressure\nliquid chromatography. The total weight of the cap-\nsule is 429mg and includes other milk thistle com-\nponents of the extraction process, excipients, and\nthe capsule shell. The 108mg of silymarin in Legalon\u00ae\ncapsules consists of the following potentially active\ningredients: silibinins A + B (~50\nmg), silicristin\n(~20mg), silidianin (~15mg), and isosilibinins A + B\nmg). The placebo gelatin capsules used in the\ntrial were identically sized capsules filled with a\npowder containing lactose and other components\nof Legalon\u00ae 140, including mannitol, magnesium\nstearate, and sodium carboxymethyl starch. The\nphased trials in this program were conducted under\nan IND, held by NIH/NCCAM, from the FDA.\nFigure 1. Chronology of planning and implementation of silymarin Phase I and Phase II studies.\nSilymarin in chronic hepatitis C 105\nPhase I study and selection of\ndoses for Phase II\nIn view of suggestive in vitro evidence, a phased-\nstudy approach was developed by the SyNCH Study\nGroup (Figure 1) to study the potential role of sily-\nmarin in research participants with chronic hepatitis\nC who were previously refractory to conventional\ntherapy. Since preliminary dosing and pharmacoki-\nnetic data on the product were not available, a Phase\nI dose-ranging study in research participants with\nchronic HCV was performed initially by the study\nteam [22]. The research participants were randomized\nto one of four silymarin doses covering a fivefold\nmg, thrice daily), to\nassess safety and dose\u00adexposure relationships in HCV\npatients who were previously treatment nonrespond-\ners. No drug-related adverse events were reported\nduring the Phase I study, and daily oral doses of up to\ng were well tolerated. Nonlinear pharmacokinet-\nics of silibinins A and B were noted, with data sug-\ngesting that the otherwise low bioavailability of\nsilymarin may be overcome at higher than usual\nmg thrice daily). Since no adverse events\nwere observed at the highest exposures obtained\nwith a dose of 700mg, this dose was identified as the\nhigh dose for Phase II trial, as it was expected to pro-\nvide reliable exposures and to be safe and well toler-\nated in the HCV population. In addition, the dose\nburden of five pills three times daily was considered\nthe largest at which acceptable patient compliance\ncan be expected. As dose\u00adexposure proportionality\nmg of\nsilymarin, a dose of 420mg was selected for the lower\ndose in the Phase II trial, as it would be expected to\nresult in 40% lower exposure than the 700-mg dose,\nwhich might be associated with clinically significant\ndifferences in pharmacodynamic end points.\nThe Phase II study, the subject of this report, was\na placebo-controlled, double-masked, randomized\ntrial that focused on safety and efficacy of silymarin\nfor treating patients with chronic HCV infection\nwho had previously failed to respond successfully to\nIFN-based therapy. This report describes the ration-\nale for the design of a Phase II trial of a botanical\nproduct in treating previous nonresponders, the\nchallenges encountered in study design and imple-\nmentation, and presents baseline characteristics of\nthe enrolled cohort.\nMethods\nSelection of trial participants\nThis clinical trial studying silymarin treatment in\nchronic hepatitis C included treatment-resistant\npatients. Several studies estimated that up to 86% of\npatients are deferred from conventional IFN treat-\nment due to medical or psychiatric comorbidities\n[6\u00ad8]. Adverse events are common in patients with\nchronic hepatitis C treated with combination of\npegylated IFN and ribavirin [23]. The impressive\ntherapeutic response rates from Phase III clinical tri-\nals of pegylated IFN and ribavirin reflect a highly\nselect patient population, that is, those who are\ndeemed to be ideal treatment candidates and who\nhave no comorbidities that would hamper their\nability to tolerate a rigorous therapy. The remainder\nof patients with chronic hepatitis C, those with\nabsolute or relative contraindications and those\nwho did not achieve sustained virological response\nwith previous therapy, could potentially benefit\nfrom other therapies.\nThus, as conventional treatment options existed\nfor chronic hepatitis C when this trial began and\ncurrently, this study focused on the subset who had\nfailed to have a sustained virological response to\nprevious IFN-based therapy (treatment resistant),\nthen the standard of care, rather than treatment-\nna\u00efve patients. Lack of a sustained virological\nresponse was defined as detectable virus less than 6\nmonths following end of treatment:\n1. HCV RNA remained detectable throughout\nthe therapy (nonresponders).\n2. HCV RNA dropped to below detectable levels\nduring treatment but became detectable\nwhile still on therapy (breakthrough).\n3. HCV RNA dropped to below detectable levels\nduring treatment but became detectable once\ntherapy was discontinued (relapsers).\nAfter they completed screening (see Table 1), 154\npatients with chronic hepatitis who did not have a\nsustained virological response to previous IFN-based\nantiviral therapy, with or without ribavirin, were\nallocated, using an adaptive minimization randomi-\nzation scheme, to one of three treatment arms:\n420mg of silymarin (three Legalon\u00ae capsules + two\nplacebo capsules), 700mg of silymarin (five Legalon\u00ae\ncapsules), or placebo (five placebo capsules). Thus,\nfive capsules of study treatment were taken orally\nthrice daily for 24 weeks. At screening, eligible\npatients were instructed to avoid the use of milk\nthistle products, and most were randomized within\nPatients with any of the HCV genotypes were eli-\ngible, provided they met the treatment-resistant\ndefinition. Study visits were planned as outlined in\nFigure 2; they were planned to provide the opportu-\nnity to perform population-based pharmacokinetic\nstudies. In addition, the multiple study visits and\ntrial infrastructure provided the opportunity to\n\ncollect serum samples from a well-characterized\ncohort that can be assayed for mechanistic studies,\nincluding exploring immunologic effects of chronic\nsilymarin exposure and biomarker screening.\nAn exemption subcommittee of the overall steer-\ning committee, comprising two hepatologists from\nthe NIH/NIDDK who did not enroll participants,\nadjudicated whether participants who did not meet\nall inclusion, or who met at least one exclusion, cri-\nterion could be enrolled in the trial. During accrual,\n25 exemptions were requested and 24 were\napproved. None of the exemptions were related to\nalanine aminotransferase (ALT), which was the basis\nof the primary efficacy end point of the trial.\nPhase II trial objectives and\noutcome variables\nThe primary objectives of the Phase II trial are to\nassess the safety profile of silymarin versus placebo\nand to evaluate whether a 24-week course of silyma-\nrin has a discernible impact on ALT, a biochemical\nmarker of hepatic disease. The primary outcome\nvariable for efficacy is serum ALT level of 45\n(approximate maximum of normal range) or less, or\na decrease in ALT from baseline level by at least 50%\nIU/L (approximately 1.5 times the\nupper limit of normal) at the end of the 24-week\ntreatment period. The primary outcome variable for\nsafety is the occurrence of a dose-limiting toxicity\nduring the 24-week treatment period.\nSecondary objectives of the trial include assessing\nchanges in serum levels of HCV RNA during silyma-\nrin therapy, characterizing the population pharma-\ncokinetics and pharmacodynamics of silymarin\nisomers, including silibinins A and B, isosilibinins A\nand B, silicristin, and silidianin, following adminis-\ntration of silymarin to participants with HCV, and\nexploring relationships between silymarin therapy\nand clinical markers of HCV hepatic disease activ-\nity. The relationship between dose and change in\n(ALT) will also be assessed.\nChoice of primary outcome\nvariable\nPerhaps the most direct measure of improvement in\nliver disease is obtained by assessing the grade of\nnecroinflammatory activity and stage of fibrosis in\nTable 1.

Indeed, most therapeutic trials of liver\ndisease have focused on liver biopsy end points.\nHowever, liver biopsies confer some risks and dis-\ncomfort to the patient and are costly to perform.\nMore importantly, it is possible that significant\nchanges in hepatic histology cannot be discerned in\ntrials conducted for relatively short treatment peri-\nods (i.e., weeks to months). These factors, as well as\nthe inherent variability of liver biopsy sampling and\nits histologic scoring, compelled the investigators to\ndevelop a nonbiopsy primary outcome variable for\nthis Phase II trial.\nTherefore, when designing this trial for resistant\ndisease, the approach focused on a clinically\nimportant end point (changes in ALT level), which\ndid not require a liver biopsy. Precedence for such\nthis choice of outcome was available from earlier\ntrials of antiviral therapies for chronic hepatitis C,\nprior to the advent of qualitative assays for HCV\nRNA, which utilized biochemical response (changes\nin hepatic enzyme activity) as the primary end\npoint [25\u00ad29]. Histologic improvement, however,\nfrequently accompanied biochemical improve-\nment in these studies during IFN therapy, even\nwhen sustained virological response was not\nobserved. Many hepatologists consider that serum\nALT activity may provide an indirect marker for\nimprovement in disease activity, although this\nsupposition has not been demonstrated conclu-\nThus, the primary outcome assessment for this\n24-week Phase II study of silymarin focuses on\nquantifying changes in ALT levels to explore initial\nevidence for efficacy of silymarin in treatment-\nresistant chronic HCV infection. The primary end\npoint of the trial incorporates stringent criteria for\nchanges in ALT levels. In order to detect such\nmarked changes in ALT, the enrollment criteria also\nrequired a high threshold for inclusion (at least\nIU/L). It is likely that therapeutic agents that\ncould improve surrogate biochemical markers of\ndisease activity and, perhaps, ameliorate complica-\ntions of hepatic disease even without affecting HCV\nRNA, would be an attractive adjunct to currently\navailable medications.\nScreen Treatment-24 weeks Follow-Up\nScreening Evaluation/Criteria/Consent +\nRandomization +\nScreening Demographic +\nAdherence Self-Efficacy Scale + + + + +\nQuality of Life Questionnaires + + + + +\nPatient Diary Summary + + + + + + +\nLaboratory Evaluation + + + + + + + + + +\nVisit Evaluation + + + + + + + +\nConcomitant Medications\nAll study visits\nAdverse Event From baseline to end of study\nPharmacokinetics\nBlood + + +\nUrine + + +\nBlood + + +\nUrine + + +\nRandom\nBlood + + + + + + +\nUrine + + + + + + +\nWhole blood for genetics sample b\n+\nSerum and Plasma c + + + +\na Phone interviews were conducted for weeks 6 and 16 visits.\nb The genetic sample was collected at the baseline (BL) visit or at any of the subsequent study visits.\nc Includes HCV RNA sample for central testing laboratory (treatment weeks 0, 12, 24, and follow-up week 4)\nFigure 2. Study visits for the Phase II trial.\nRationale for revising eligibility\ncriteria to include patients with\nwell-compensated cirrhosis\nAt initial study implementation, trial eligibility was\nrestricted to patients without cirrhosis noted on any\nprevious liver biopsy. Subsequently, the protocol\nwas amended to permit enrollment of patients with\nwell-compensated cirrhosis. This protocol change\nresulted primarily from two considerations. The\nfirst consideration was that a significant proportion\nof patients with chronic HCV have cirrhosis but\nwere excluded from the trial. During the trial plan-\nning phase, there was considerable interest in\nincluding patients with well-compensated cirrhosis\nas they are a significant subgroup of those with\nchronic disease. But due to insufficient product\nsafety data in the patient population, they were\nexcluded. Another consideration was the lower\nthan anticipated enrollment rate across all sites dur-\ning the trial enrollment phase, in part due to exclud-\ning a significant fraction of patients with chronic\nHCV infection and cirrhosis, a factor associated\nwith nonresponse to IFN-based therapies.\nThe Phase I trial had provided safety data across\nmany dose levels among HCV patients without doc-\numented cirrhosis. After the Phase II trial was initi-\nated, however, pharmacokinetic and safety data\nfrom a newly published study suggested that cir-\nrhotic patients could be treated safely with an intra-\nvenous form of silibinin (Legalon\u00ae SIL). It was noted\nthat circulating levels associated with the intrave-\nnous form of the product were considerably higher\nthan those associated with orally administered sily-\nmarin [12]. In that study, higher serum levels of sili-\nbinins A and B were achieved during daily\nintravenous infusions for a 2-week period with no\ndose-related adverse effects; patients with cirrhosis\nwho had failed prior therapy were an important\nsubgroup of study participants [12].\nHowever, the safety profile observed in patients\nwith cirrhosis with the intravenous form of silibinin\n(Legalon\u00ae SIL) may not be identical to silymarin since\nthey are chemically two different drugs. Silymarin is\ncomposed of six flavonolignans including silibinins\nA and B, whereas Legalon\u00ae SIL is composed of water-\nsoluble hemisuccinate covalent esters of only silib-\ninins A and B. Therefore, once the protocol was\nmodified to include those with well-compensated\ncirrhosis, after approval from the DSMB and relevant\ninstitutional review boards (IRBs), the study adopted\na more stringent plan to monitor safety in trial\n\nparticipants with well-compensated cirrhosis. This\nplan included monitoring plasma concentrations in\nthe event of a serious adverse event or hepatic bio-\nchemical test elevation in someone with cirrhosis,\nsince the only oral silymarin pharmacokinetic data\npublished to date indicated that blood levels were\nlikely to be substantially higher in cirrhotics than in\nSample size considerations\nThe sample size for this study was estimated based\non the primary comparison of the proportions of\nparticipants in each arm who attain the primary\nend point, as defined earlier. The total sample size\ndetect a clinically meaningful difference in outcome\nbetween the placebo and silymarin arms if there\nwas no dose\u00adresponse relationship, and over 90% if\nthere was a dose\u00adresponse relationship. This sample\nsize calculation assumed a spontaneous ALT nor-\nmalization (primary end point) in 15% of placebo-\ntreated participants and assumed a clinically\nsignificant (25%) improvement in the success rate\nfor the silymarin-treated group. A total of 154 par-\nticipants were enrolled.\nBaseline characteristics of\nparticipants in the Phase II trial\nThe baseline characteristics of the participants\nenrolled in the Phase II trial (summarized in Table 2)\nare representative of the population of nonrespond-\ners to current hepatitis C therapy of pegylated IFN\nand ribavirin [33]. The median age of the predomi-\nanticipated, many of these previous IFN-based ther-\napy nonresponders had characteristics of difficult-\nto-successfully-treat patients including genotype 1\nobese (85.0%), and elevated fasting blood glucose of\ncohort is composed of 20% African-American par-\nticipants, similar to the percentage enrolled in non-\nresponder trials but higher than the percentage\nenrolled in clinical trials involving treatment-na\u00efve\npatients [3\u00ad5]. Nearly 90% of the cohort reported\nregular use of medications (prescription or over-the-\ncounter preparations) at study enrollment, with\nalmost 30% reporting taking one or more alterna-\ntive or complementary medications. Dietary supple-\nments reported by 28% of trial participants at\nenrollment included a variety of products such as\nnutrients and botanicals.\nDiscussion\nDespite a large body of literature describing the use\nof silymarin over several decades, the published\n\nevidence of clinical efficacy in hepatic disease is\nSilymarin in chronic hepatitis C 109\nequivocal. Thus, it was important to systematically\nstudy the potential benefit of silymarin in a com-\nmon chronic liver disease. The large disease burden,\nwith lack of effective therapies, along with frequent\npoor tolerability of IFN and ribavirin therapy by\nchronic hepatitis C patients made them an impor-\ntant group of patients in which to evaluate silyma-\nrin. The previous lack of consistency across the few\nstudies with regard to efficacy end points, silymarin\npreparations, and liver disease diagnosis was further\nimpetus to implement a phased development plan\nfor clinical testing. During the early planning stages,\nit was apparent that, as for most botanical products,\ndose-finding pharmacokinetic studies were sparse\nand doses of different preparations had been identi-\nfied arbitrarily for assessment in liver diseases. In\naddition, there were no preexisting studies of botan-\nical-food or botanical-drug pharmacokinetics. It\nwas also important to identify an industry collabo-\nrator motivated to participate in the development\nplan, which would provide study product of stand-\nard composition and which also could provide a\nproduct that complied with FDA IND requirements\nfor clinical testing. Implementing a phased\napproach, the investigators initially performed a\ndose-ranging Phase I study to assess pharmacokinet-\nics and safety, after which two doses of 420 and\nmg taken three times a day were targeted for\nevaluation in the Phase II study.\nThe cohort reflects the treatment-resistant HCV\npopulation in the United States in many ways, as it\nis predominantly male, with a number of clinical\nparameters associated with resistant disease, includ-\ning genotype 1, obesity, diabetes, and cirrhosis [3\u00ad5,\n34,35]. Several reports have suggested that African-\nAmericans do not respond well to hepatitis C ther-\napy [36]. Thus, it was anticipated that the cohort\nwould consist of substantial numbers of African-\nAmericans. Although 20% of the cohort is African-\nAmerican, it is lower than might be expected in a\ncohort of treatment-resistant HCV patients. This is\nlikely due to several factors, including the typically\nlower ALT levels observed in African-American\npatients, compared with Caucasian with chronic\nHCV, and the stringent inclusion threshold of at\nIU/L for the current trial [37]. In addition,\ndata regarding botanical product use from the 2007\nNHIS CAM survey indicate much greater use for\nsuch products in Caucasians (43%) than African-\nAmericans (26%), suggesting that Caucasians might\nhave greater interest in enrolling in studies of\nbotanical therapies [14].\nWhile IFN and ribavirin are known to cause sig-\nnificant side effects, silymarin has been well tolerated\nby patients with chronic hepatitis C [9\u00ad12]. As fre-\nquently noted among patients with serious chronic\nillnesses, quality of life is significantly diminished in\npatients with chronic hepatitis C. This aspect of the\nTable 2.

Many patients explore other potential thera-\npies, such as silymarin, to complement conventional\ntherapies, or less frequently, as an alternative to con-\nventional therapies. In view of the fairly widespread\nuse of silymarin, the current phased investigation of\nits use in chronic hepatitis C will provide a rigorous\nassessment of its safety and associated quality of life,\nas well as further pharmacokinetic data on silymarin\nin patients with hepatic disease.\nSummary\nThe phased-study approach undertaken for silyma-\nrin as described in this report addressed several\nunique challenges to design of clinical trials pro-\ngrams of botanical products. As products may be\nmarketed in the United States without standard\nchemistry data provided and usually with limited\ndata on pharmacokinetics and dosing, much early-\nphase testing is required before clinical trials can be\ndesigned and implemented. Unlike studies of con-\nventional pharmaceuticals, early work to identify a\nmanufacturer and a standard botanical formulation\nmust be undertaken to begin the process of prelimi-\nnary preclinical assessment. Verifying the accepta-\nbility of testing for IND filings with the FDA is an\nimportant early step in planning clinical testing of\nall new products for specific disease indications but\nare particularly challenging for botanical products\ndue to lack of data, manufacturing requirements,\nand standard product composition. The phased-\nstudy approach implemented by the SyNCH Study\nGroup for silymarin has required several years of\neffort but has been successful in providing impor-\ntant chemistry, pharmacokinetic, and dosing data\non a commonly used botanical product.
