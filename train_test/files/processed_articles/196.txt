In the male samples data indicate\ninverted \"U\" relations among both black\nand white men, reaching maxima between\n12 and 15 years ofschooling. The sides ofthe\n\"U\" curve are much steeper for black than\nfor white men.\nConclusions-The four gender/race cate-\ngories display four different body mass\nindex and education associations. These\nfour associations are only slightly altered by\nsimultaneously adjusting for two additional\nmeasures of socioeconomic status: occupa-\ntion and income.\nObesity has been strongly linked to heart disease,'\nmany forms ofcancer,2 and arthritis, especially of\nthe knees.3 Thus further research into the causes\nand/or correlates of obesity is warranted. This\nstudy investigates the correlation between educa-\ntion, one of the components of socioeconomic\nstatus, and obesity in a national sample of adult\nwomen and men. Prior research indicates that\nsocioeconomic status measured in a variety of\nways is strongly and inversely correlated with\nbeing overweight among women.4-10 The results\namong men have been less consistent. Some\nstudies find a negative relationship,4 while others\nfind a weak positive association,5 and still others\nfind a curvilinear relationship.6 A recent review\nof published reports confirms the inverse\nrelationship for women and the great variety of\nfindings for men.8 However, these previous\nstudies (1) do not usually account for additional\nsuspected correlates ofbody mass such as marital\nstatus and square ofage, (2) do not rely on a model\nwhich accounts for the separate influences of\noccupation, income, and education, and (3) do not\nallow for curvilinear relations between schooling\nand body mass.\nAn important criticism of prior research on\nsocioeconomic correlates of obesity is that the\nstudies have not carefully distinguished between\nsocial science variables. Occupation, income, and\neducation are either grouped together to form a\nsocioeconomic status index or treated separately\nin univariate analyses. Neither approach is fully\nsatisfactory. Occupation, income, and education\nare best viewed as separate variables for two\nreasons. First, theyhave different implications for\ngovernment and business intervention.1' 12 For\nexample, some businesses might sponsor exercise\nor health promotion campaigns at work. Income\ncan be adjusted through businesses raising wages\nor government altering taxation, welfare, and\nsocial security spending. Education may be\naffected by government spending on schools,\nHeadstart, and special training programs such as\nthe Job Corps. An economic analysis in a widely\ncited text by Feldstein'3 suggests that ifincreased\neducation improves health, then national spend-\ning on education may be more cost-effective than\nspending on medical care to reduce national\nmortalityand morbidity. Second, there are widely\naccepted theories explaining relationships among\noccupation, income, and education. A proper\nunderstanding of the role of schooling, for\nexample, must take into account that for most\npeople, educational achievement precedes career\nchoice and subsequent income. Thus many social\nscience models assume that high educational\nachievement results in high earnings and employ-\nment in \"good\" jobs rather than vice versa.\"\nMethods\nSAMPLE\nData were drawn from the medical examination\ncomponent of the first US National Health and\n(NHANES I), conducted by the National Center\nfor Health Statistics.

Income was entered in categories in\nthe NHANES I. The income variable we used\nrepresented midpoint values within each\ncategory. Thus, for example, income between\nprovides a summary of and descriptive statistics\non variables used in the analyses.\nANALYSES\nAnalyses of covariance and multiple regression\ntechniques were used where body mass index was\ntreated as the dependent variable, and five\ncategories of schooling, age, age squared, income,\nseven occupations, three marital status categories,\nand work/activity status variables were treated as\ncovariates. Separate regressions were run for\nwomen and men since prior studies showed great\ndisparities across gender in the correlation\nbetween body mass and schooling41l0 The five\nTable I NHANES I study characteristics by race and gender.

Age and marital status\ncategories are widely recognised covariates of\nobesity.4-l Occupation, income, and activity, eg,\nretired, student, disabled, and homemaker, are\nall known to be strongly correlated with\nTwo different analyses of covariance were con-\nducted on each of the four gender/race groups.\nThe first included the five schooling categories\ntogether with age, age squared, and marital status\n(columns 1 and 3 in tables II and III). The second\nincluded the five schooling categories and all\nknown confounding variables: age through work/\nactivity status (columns 2 and 4 in tables II and\nIII). These analyses allowed for comparisons\nbetween schooling-body mass index relationships\nwhich did not control for the well known\nassociations among education, occupation,\nincome, and work/activity status.\nIn addition, two different sets of weighted\nmultiple regressions were applied. The first\nweighted multiple regression set treated the five\nschooling categories as dummy variables (this is\nequivalent to analysis of covariance).'8 The sec-\nond multiple regression approach treated school-\ning as a continuous variable. Again, two\nregressions in each set were run within each\ngender/race category, as described above. The\nweighted multiple regression techniques were\nused since NHANES I is a stratified and clustered\nsample. Unweighted multiple regressions may\nresult in inefficient parameter estimates and\nbiased standard errors since the regression errors\nwithin strata and groups are often correlated. 19 To\nestimated regressions properly for this sample,\nthe weighted multiple regression routines\navailable in PCCARP were used.20\nResults\nWeighted and unweighted analysis of covariance\nand multiple regressions yielded similar results.\nThe potential bias from using a stratified and\nclustered sample appeared minimal in these\nanalyses ofthe NHANES I data. Thus the results\npresented here are for the first and most familiar\ntechnique, analysis of covariance.\nTables II and III present the analysis of\ncovariance results for women and men. The first\nrow indicates the mean body mass index for each\nof the four subsamples. The next five rows\npresent the mean body mass indices, for each of\nthe five schooling categories, together with their\n95% confidence intervals. Two sets of results\napply to each of the two analyses of covariance.\nThe first included only a few covariates: age, age\nsquared, and four marital status categories\n(columns 1 and 3). The second included age,\nage squared, marital status categories, income,\nseven occupations, and variables for work/activity\nstatus (columns 2 and 4). In the interest ofbrevity,\nonly the results pertaining to schooling will be\npresented and discussed. A longer version of the\npaper which discusses all results is available from\nthe authors.\nGender, race, and body mass\nWOMEN\nThe results in table II and for figs 1 and 2 provide\ncontrasting pictures for the body mass index-\neducation association between black and white\nwomen. With increases in education in the early\nyears, from less thanor equal to 7 to between 8 and\n11, body mass index increased in black women.\nAfter 8 to 11 years, average body mass index fell\nfor black women. The inverted \"U\" for black\nwomen was most pronounced in analysis of\ncovariance results which did not control for\noccupation, income, and work/activity. For white\nwomen, on the other hand, body mass index\ncontinuously fell with increased schooling. This\ncontinuous drop for white women is especially\nclear in the analysis of covariance results which\ncontrolled for occupation, income, and work/\nactivity.\nWhile some ofthe confidence intervals in figs 1\nand 2 overlap with other estimated means, the\npatterns clearly suggest an inverted \"U\" for black\nwomen and a simple inverse relation for white\nwomen, and confidence intervals for the highest\nmeans do not overlap with the lowest means. A\nsimple comparison oftwo overlapping confidence\nintervals, however, cannot test for the overall\npattern since information on the three other\nestimated means and confidence intervals would\nbe ignored. Statistically significant multiple\nregression results on schooling and schooling\nsquared, both entered as continuous variables,\nconfirmed the upside down \"U\" for black women\nYears of schooling\nFigure I Body mass index and schooling for black\nwomen\nTable II The\nrelationship between\nschooling and body mass\nindex: results of analysis\nof covariance in women.\nDependent variable is\nbody mass index\nTable III The\nrelationship between\nschooling and body mass\nindex: results of analysis\nof covariance in men.\nDependent variable is\nbody mass index\nBlack women White women\nAdditional covariates:\nAge, age squared, 4 marital status categories Included Included Included Included\nIncome, 7 occupations, variables for retired,\nstudents, and unable to work Excluded Included Excluded Included\nBMI = body mass index; CI = confidence interval\nBlack men White men\nAdditional covariates:\nAge, age squared, 4 marital status categories Included Included Included Included\nIncome, 7 occupations, variables for retired,\nstudents, and unable to work Excluded Included Excluded Included\nBMI = body mass index; CI = confidence interval\no Adjusted for all covariates\n* Adjusted only for age,\nL\nage squared and marital status\nr I I I I I\n1 Paul Leigh, 3tames F Fries, Helen B Hubert\nand strictly inverse (monotonically decreasing)\nrelation for white women.\nAdjusting for all the covariates appeared to\nmake some difference for both black and white\nwomen.

Beginning with the 8 to 11 year category,\nboth male figures suggest an inverted \"U\" shape.\nThe height and magnitude of the inverted \"U\"\nvary considerably between the black and white\nmen, however. The black male inverted \"U\" is\ntall with steep sides. The white male \"U\" rises\nand falls only slightly from the lowest to the\nhighest levels of education. Little variation is\npresent between the first two schooling\ncategories, grammar school and some high school,\nfor black men. The general shape of the\nassociations was only slightly altered once con-\ntrols are entered for occupation, income, work/\nactivity.\nu\nYears of schooling The results presented here shed further light on\nthe schooling and occupation debate as it applies\n27 to obesity.'' 21 One economic model, the \"institu-\ntional\" theory, would suggest that the schooling-\nobesity association is indirect2l; that is, schooling\nallows access to safe jobs and it is the safe jobs, not\nTT T the schooling, that lead to better health. The\n_B * ^^ \"human capital\" view, a second economic model,\nholds that schooling improves health directly.\"\nBetter educated people more efficiently allocate\ntheir resources, time, and energy to produce\nhealth than less well educated people. In the\n\"human capital\" view, schooling has a direct\nl effect on obesity. Additional results from the\npresent study indicate that the broad occupational\no Adjusted for all covariates categories were not statistically significant in their\n_ *\nAdjusted only for age, association with obesity while schooling main-\nage squared and marital status tained its statistical significance in the four\n22 _ gender/race categories.\n01\" I I I 1 A third model, however, cannot be directly\nYears of schooling education may act as a surrogate for true causal\nvariables (eg, intelligence, ability to defer\n27 gratification, self-efficacy, ambition, drive) which\nin turn act to increase education level, to decrease\nbody mass, and to obtain a high status job.22 In\n26 T T this third interpretation, interventions directed at\nincreasing education levels would not be expected\nto influence body mass. However, recent research\n25 _-_* 1 1 ~t on the association between education on the one\nT L hand and blood pressure, disability, and seat belt\n_ t use on the other'2 23 24 rejects this view.

An\nupside down \"U\" was observed for both black\nand white men. A strictly linear, inverse relation\nwas observed for white women, and an inverse\nrelation for black women beyond seven years of\nschooling. While the inverse relation between\nbody mass and socioeconomic status among\nwomen is not unique,8 the finding of a strictly\nlinear relation with only schooling for white\nwomen while simultaneously accounting for the\nseparate influences of income, occupation, and\nmarital status is unique. Prior studies did not\ncontrol for the separate influences of income,\noccupation, and marital status.\nA number of \"human capital\" and \"education\nas surrogate\" hypotheses are consistent with this\nfinding for white women and black women after\neight years of schooling. (1) Schooling has been\nalleged to teach selfdiscipline, a skill which can be\ntransmitted to dieting and exercise (human capi-\ntal).15 (2) Schooling may improve self efficacy,\nthat is, increase the belief that what happens to a\nperson is their own doing and that luck plays only\na small role (human capital).26 (3) Alternatively,\nhigher levels of schooling may be achieved by\nthose with greater self efficacy (education as\nsurrogate). The poorly educated may be more\nlikely to have acquired \"learned helplessness\"\nthan the better educated. Again, if this attitude\ncan be applied to health, more educated women\nwould more likely view their weight as under their\ncontrol thanless educated women.27 (4) Schooling\nmay be positively associated with time prefer-\nences or delayed gratification (education as sur-\nrogate).22 More educated women may be more\nthoughtful concerning the long term health con-\nsequences ofobesity than less educated women; or\nthose innately possessing low time preference\n(ability to delay gratification) may thereby achieve\nhigher education levels.\nThe curvilinear, upside down \"U\", relation\nbetween body mass and schooling observed for\nmen is intriguing. Prior studies found positive as\nwell as negative relationships. There is no con-\nsistency in the prior studies for men as there\nappears to be for women.8 Ifthe relation is, in fact,\nan inverted \"U\", it is not surprising that prior\nresearchers looking for linear relations have been\nperplexed. If data included mostly men with\nmany years ofschooling, a negative relation would\nbe observed. If data were drawn from men with\nfew and many years of schooling, and if a linear\nmodel was assumed, a different line with a shallow\npositive slope would be observed.\nThe inverted \"U\" curve for men might be\nexplained by a high body mass being less likely to\nindicate obesity for men than for women; that is,\nbody mass index may measure other attributes in\nmen, such as muscle mass. Alternatively, if the\nbroad occupation categories do not capture all the\nvariations in working conditions across jobs, then\nthree additional reasons can be suggested: more\nmen than women were employed in physically\ndemanding (fat consuming) jobs in the early\n1970s; many of the most physically demanding\njobs requiredonly a high school diploma; and men\nwith desk jobs and many years ofschooling might\nhave been more likely to exercise than men with\ndesk jobs and few years ofschooling. Finally, very\nlittle education could have resulted in poor health\nand subsequent low body mass, especially among\nblack men, similar to what may have been seen in\nblack women.\nIn conclusion, the four gender/race categories\ndisplay four different body mass index and\neducation associations. These four associations\nare only slightly altered by simultaneously\nadjusting for two additional measures of socio-\neconomic status: occupation and income. Medical\nexperts frequently advocate government and\nbusiness interventions designed to improve\npublic health. The strong associations between\nsocioeconomic status and measures ofhealth have\nled some experts to advocate policies to improve\nthe status of those in the lower socioeconomic\ngroups. But effective policies require a clear\nunderstanding of the reasons why socioeconomic\nstatus is correlated with health. Education,\noccupation, and income are components of socio-\neconomics with different implications for inter-\nvention. This study suggests that the correlations\nbetween socioeconomic status and body mass are\nlargely due to education and not occupation or\nincome. Since the data used are cross sectional, we\ncannot conclude that education results in high or\nlow body mass. Nevertheless, future researchers\ninterested in understanding the impact of\nsocioeconomic status on obesity may want to\ndirect greater attention to education rather than\neither occupation or income.\nThe authors would like to thank John Oehlert, Lisa\nCendejas, and Mary Peterson for research and typing\nassistance.\n1 Hubert HB, Fienleib N, McNamara P, Castelli WP.

It is, in this case, as in many others, the peculiarity of what are\noddly styled \"practical measures\", that they supersede agencies which are answering well by\nagencies which are not likely to answer well. Here is a heavy charge of inefficiency brought against\nthe drains, cesspools, stink-traps, &c., of England in general, and London in particular. The\nevidence is voluminous and conclusive, and by common consent a verdict of proven is returned.\nCitizens look grave and determine to petition parliament about it. Parliament promises to consider\nthe matter; and after the usual amount of debate, says-\"Let there be a Board of Health\".\nWhereupon petitioners rub their hands, and look out for great things. They have unbounded\nsimplicity-these good citizens. Legislation may disappoint them fifty times running, without at all\nshaking their faith in its efficiency. They hoped that Church abuses would be rectified by the\nEcclesiastical Commission: the poor curates can say whether that hope has been realized. Backed by\nan act ofparliament, the Poor-Law Commissioners were to have eradicated able-bodied pauperism:\nyet, until checked by the recent prosperity, the poors'-rates have been rapidly rising to their old\nlevel. The New Building Act was to have given the people of London better homes; whereas, as we\nlately saw, it has made worse the homes that most wanted improving. Men were sanguine of\nreforming criminals by the silent system, or the separate system; but, if we are to judge by the\ndisputes oftheir respective advocates, neither of these plans is very successful. Pauper children were\nto have been made into good citizens by industrial education; from all quarters, however, come\nstatements that a very large percentage of them get into gaol, or become prostitutes, or return to the\nworkhouse. The measures enjoined by the Vaccination Act of 1840 were to have exterminated\nsmall-pox; yet the Registrar-General's reports show that the deaths from small-pox have been\nincreasing. And thus does year after year add to those abortive schemes, of which so many have been\nquoted. Yet scarcely a doubt seems to arise, respecting the competency of legislators to do what they\nprofess. From the times when they tried to fix the value of money down to our own day, when they\nhave just abandoned the attempt to fix the price ofcorn, statesmen have been undertaking all kinds of\nthings, from regulating the cut of boot-toes, up to preparing people for Heaven; and have been\nconstantly failing, or producing widely-different results from those intended. Nevertheless such\ninexhaustible faith have men, that, although they see this, and although they are daily hearing of\nimbecilities in public departments-of Admiralty Boards that squander three millions a year in\nbuilding bad ships and breaking them up again-of Woods and Forests Commissioners who do not\neven know the rental of the estates they manage-of bungling excise-chemists who commit their\nchiefs to losing prosecutions, for which compensation has to be made-yet government needs but to\nannounce another plausible project, and men straightway hurrah, and throw up their caps, in the full\nexpectation of getting all that is promised.\nSocial Statics: or the conditions essential to human happiness\nspecified, and the first of them developed by",
