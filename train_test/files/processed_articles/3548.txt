    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis paper investigates the relation between food, the body and morality in fashion\nmodelling. More than has been recognized so far, eating is a continuous form of body\nwork that is decidedly essential to aesthetic labour. Against the backdrop of slender\naesthetics, models are purposefully socialized into remaining or becoming slender,\nthrough food beliefs inducing them to eat in specific ways. Food is classified into\ngood and bad categories, and believed to affect male and female bodies differently.\nBut other than to aesthetics or gender, considering `what (not) to eat' links to morality,\nenabling models to draw symbolic boundaries between themselves and others. These\nshow two main moral imperatives: models should eat controlled and effortlessly. Solving\nthis moral paradox, models normalize and conceal controlled eating. Ultimately, the\nfashion modelling food system preoccupies models with self-surveillance and reinforces\npower inequalities between models and other professionals.\n",

From the age of 14 she has been a\nhigh-end `ethnic' model working mainly in Paris and Milan. Retired from the\nindustry for four years now, she currently works in Brussels as a social volunteer.\nShe looks back on her time in modelling as a joyful and exciting period: `fashion\nwas an environment where I felt completely in the right place.

And luckily', she says, `I managed to keep both my feet\nfirmly on the ground'. She reminisces about the amazing parties and the beautiful,\npleasant people she encountered. Recalling the glamour and excitement of those\ntimes, a radiant, almost euphoric expression appears on her face.\nNahima tells me all about the sexy, low-cut dresses and the high heels she used\nto wear during photo-shoots. I ask her whether she had to make any particular\neffort in order to fit into those outfits. She replies: `no, look at me now!' \u00ad Nahima\nhas a slender body, and a particularly narrow face, with prominent cheekbones \u00ad\n`and now, I even gained weight! No, all that just went by itself'. At some point\nduring our conversation I feel like having a drink. I decide on a glass of beer and\nI offer to get one for Nahima as well, at which point she looks disgusted, and even\nquite shocked by my proposal. She answers with a firm, decisive `no'. In response\nto my probably puzzled facial expression (surprised that offering someone a drink\ncould elicit such an indignant reaction) she explains that her aversion to beer is a\nremainder from her modelling period. `The problem with beer', she says, `is not just\nthe amount of calories it contains, but that it stimulates the body's production of\nfemale hormones, oestrogen'. She tells me that oestrogen stimulates the body to\nproduce fat and slows down the generation of muscles. Hence, beer makes the body\nparticularly plump. Nahima prefers to drink wine, which contains around the same\namount of calories as beer, a bit over a hundred per glass she tells me, but does not\nhave negative hormonal effects on her body.\nNahima then continues to lay out her nutritional habits to me, emphasizing that\nshe never followed a diet, but has always eaten quite normally. Her extensive\nexplanation of her eating and drinking habits, however, indicates something else:\nI eat no carbohydrates, not at all back then and now very rarely. I used to eat a lot of\ngrated carrots, because they put that in just about everything they served me at\nwork . . . And meat, only that very white part of a chicken. But no lamb, absolutely\nno lamb! Very fat. No pig, but that's also because I'm a Muslim. And no beef. Maybe,\nyes, sometimes I eat goat, a little piece. And fish, grilled fish.\nSpeaking about oil, she starts looking troubled, saying she uses only a little bit of\nolive oil for frying something, but prefers to avoid it. To get enough sugar she eats\na piece of fruit every now and then. Only the sugars coming from fruits are good\nsugars, but having too much of them is bad. This is why fruit juices are a no-go for\nNahima: `the amount of fruits that go into one juice, plus all the added sugars,\nmakes that really way too many'.\nIn the detailed account of her eating habits, Nahima excludes a range of food-\nstuffs from her habitual regimen by constructing categories of allowed, good foods\nand forbidden, bad foods (cf. Furst et al., 2000). These categories are based on\nvarious (presumed) characteristics, such as caloric value, sugar level, amount of fat,\ncarbohydrates, and hormonal effect. In addition, she takes into account religious\nprohibitions regarding pork. Nahima's classifications lay bare rules and beliefs\nregarding food salient to fashion modelling \u00ad a field particularly preoccupied\nstandard of thinness is (increasingly) extreme and, for many models, not readily\nbackdrop of slender corporeal aesthetics, beginning young models are purposefully\nsocialized, often by modelling agents, into remaining or becoming slender, through\nfood rules and beliefs inducing them to eat in specific ways.\nBased on ethnographic data obtained in Amsterdam, Paris and Warsaw, I inves-\ntigate the relation between food, the body and morality in the aesthetic labour of\nfashion models. I present fashion modelling as an insightful case for understanding\nhow food and eating practices are relevant and often challenging to the work of\naesthetic labourers, and ask: how, and to what ends, do professional fields embed\nfood rules and beliefs that structure (as well as challenge) the aesthetic labour of the\nworkers they inhabit?\nThis paper is inspired by Mary Douglas' work on food categorizations (1972,\n2003). It identifies which food categories are relevant in this field by looking at how\nclassifications of food are often embedded in rational, scientific frames, they are not\nmerely based on facts. They rather provide a guide for individuals to assess their\neating habits in terms of what is good (Coveney, 2001: viii). Because the know-\nledges upon which food is categorized are normative, and at times arbitrary, I study\nfood in fashion modelling anthropologically, as a categorical belief system\nThe consideration of `what (not) to eat' is both an aesthetic and ethical one, and\nin addition, it is a gendered concern. First, eating is a form of body work that is\ncarried out with the motivation to aesthetically shape, or alter, the model's body\nbestow food with specific properties that are believed to affect models' physiques.\nDifferent foods and eating techniques are classified as more or less obstructive to\nsuccessfully embodying the standard of slenderness. At the same time, eating is\nlinked to various moral rules, which enable fashion models to draw boundaries and\nmorally position themselves vis-a\nLamont, 1992). And finally, food is believed to have different effects on male\nand female model-bodies. Caloric foods, in particular carbohydrates, are framed\nas dangerous for female model bodies, and needing to be controlled in different\nways and by various degrees (cf. Douglas, 2003).\nCategorizations of good, bad, healthy or dangerous foods, produced in the\nfashion modelling food system, stimulate controlled eating. Simultaneously, a per-\nsistent norm of effortlessness requires concealment of such control (Tyler and\npied with self-surveillance and self-objectification, and subjugated by agencies and\nclients (cf. Mears, 2008). It also renders eating a sober, solitary, hardly enjoyable\npractice for models.\nFinally, the fashion modelling food system is significant for how people increas-\ningly `aestheticize' and moralize the body, its size and the practice of eating\nfashion modelling reflect, in a magnified way, how food is categorized and dealt\nwith in contemporary western societies that are increasingly obsessed with food in\nMoralizing looks, size and food\nWithin the contemporary western framework of bodily aesthetics, slenderness is an\ndemand of being slim places minding what you eat central to people's body\nwork in industries revolving around appearance, being slender is a job requirement\ntheir salaries depend on (Warhurst and Nickson, 2001; Witz et al. 2003). However,\nalso for people outside aesthetic industries slenderness has become something to\naspire: not in the last place, because it comes with social and economic benefits\nSlenderness is associated with a whole range of positive traits: advertising, fash-\nion and mainstream media project the belief that thinness connotes control, power,\nSlender persons, then, are perceived to `house a self that errs on the side of moral\nsuperiority' (Paxson, 2005: 20). Such positive perceptions, in turn, create a `halo-\neffect': a self-fulfilling prophecy of being granted those opportunities (in work,\nfriendship, love) through which people actually become more successful (Kaplan,\npositions.\nVis-a\n` -vis the appraisal of slender bodies there is an intensified condemnation of\nfat bodies \u00ad on aesthetic, but on moral grounds too: `fat individuals are considered\npersonally responsible for their weight, lazy, lacking in self-control, and incompe-\n`as an indication of moral sloppiness' (Paxson, 2005: 17). This condemnation of fat\nbodies gives ground to a persistent fat stigma that leads to workplace discrimin-\nation and social exclusion of the obese (Kwan and Trautner, 2011; O'Brien et al.,\nThe moralization of body size turns food and the eating body into a moral\nespecially, there has been a surge of foodie blogging (Johnston and Baumann,\n2010) and food activism (Siniscalchi and Counihan, 2014), giving rise to a prolif-\neration of food discourses that separate right from wrong foodstuffs and ways of\neating them. Food consumption is increasingly used by people to morally position\nthemselves as good eaters in relation to others who they depict as bad eaters\n(Johnston et al., 2011: 312). This makes food a very personal thing, touching\nupon people's sense of self. Belasco and Scranton write that `if we are what we\neat, we are also what we don't eat . . . To eat is to distinguish and discriminate,\ninclude and exclude. Food choices establish boundaries and borders' (2014: 2). The\nfood system in fashion modelling is a case in point to get a closer look into the way\nsymbolic boundaries between self and others are drawn.\nBringing food studies to aesthetic labour studies\nFood and eating practices are relevant to aesthetic labourers across a myriad of\nprofessions and fields, but mostly to those that involve display work (Mears and\nConnell, 2016). For ballet dancers, exotic dancers, but also for shopfloor workers\nin clothing retail, the control of food-intake is an important aesthetic practice that\nresearched fact in studies of dance or professional athleticism (Wacquant, 1992;\napparent centrality of (not) eating in the field of fashion modelling is largely dis-\nregarded. Especially viewing the abundant attention popular media and fashion\nindustries pay to (disordered) eating practices of fashion models,11 surprisingly few\nscholars have placed fashion models' eating practices central to their investigations\nlooks at the backstage of aesthetic labour and pays attention to eating practices of\nplus-size female fashion models. Interestingly, she argues that plus-size models\nengage in forms of bodily discipline that rely on wider, societally shared `thin\nThis paper empirically investigates the role of food and eating in the field of\nfashion modelling. In doing so, I draw on the concept of `body work', notably\nelaborated by Debra Gimlin. Body work particularly covers the load of what\nfashion models (are expected to) do with their bodies, as well as what other pro-\nfessionals do with the bodies of models, as it refers to the work that individuals\nundertake on their bodies in private; to the practices through which bodies are\nproduced in the workplace; and to the paid work performed on the bodies of others\nImportantly, private body work and professional aesthetic labour are hardly\nseparable. The one continuously seeps into the other (Enwistle and Wissinger,\nto `always be on', as they need to adapt their whole lifestyle \u00ad their entire embodied\nselves \u00ad to professional aesthetic imperatives (Entwistle and Wissinger, 2006: 783).\nBy analogy to Hochschild's emotion work (Hochschild, 1979), body work further\nimplies that the embodiment of aesthetics is practised most successfully when it is\ndone through constraint, concealment and containment (Young, 1990). Moreover,\nmuch body work is reflexive, carried out with the primary purpose of `acting back\nupon the body, so as to modify, maintain or thematise it in some way' (Crossley,\n2005: 9). And finally, body work is gendered. Even though men are increasingly\nsubjected to more rigorous norms of physical beauty, Gimlin notes that, still,\n`women are expected to engage in a larger number of body management practices,\nspend more effort and money on them, and be more concerned about them\nthan men' (2007: 354). In fashion modelling, slender aesthetics do not merely\napply to female models: male models too are concerned with controlling their\nbodily measurements and size (Entwistle, 2004). Whether and how eating in fash-\nion modelling is gendered is explored by looking at differences in beliefs about food\naffecting male and female model-bodies that possibly result in gendered eating\npractices.\nLinking food talk to food practice through\nperson-centred ethnography\nTo investigate the relation between food beliefs and eating practices in fashion\nmodelling, I draw on in-depth interviews and participant observation, often accom-\n36 models in Amsterdam, Paris and Warsaw, cities that are all part of the trans-\nnational field of fashion modelling. Some of these models became key informants\nand were interviewed more than once. I spoke to fashion photographers, bookers,\nscouts, fashion designers, magazine editors, stylists, make-up artists and a fashion\nmodelling coach. Most informants were recruited during fashion events, with some\nof them recruiting further informants from their social networks. This chain-\nreferral sampling allowed for insights into the social network connecting these\nactors and provided access to people I would not otherwise have been able to\nreach. In terms of the selection, as far as possible I paid attention to factors\nlikely to influence informants' practices and experiences, such as gender, age,\nethnicity, nationality, city and position in the modelling field (commercial or\nhigh-end). However, variation in fashion models is limited due to existing conven-\ntions of gender, class, age and ethnicity, so the informants consist mainly of young,\ntall, slim, mostly white fashion models, the majority of them female (22 or 61%).\nInterviews lasted between one and two hours, were recorded with permission of the\ninformants, and mostly took place in restaurants and cafe\n\u00b4 s in the city centre.\nTo identify relevant themes, topics and issues, all interviews were transcribed,\ninductively coded, and studied through thematic and narrative analyses\nInvestigating fashion professionals' narratives on food enabled me to discern\n`the emotional landscape of desire, morality and expectations' they inhabit (Pugh,\nwere used to make inferences about their eating practices. The method of person-\ncentred ethnography (Hollan, 2001) proved to be particularly useful as it permits a\nfocus on people's practical involvement in the world and explains social practices\nand behaviour from the experiential perspective of acting, intending and attentive\nsubjects (Hollan, 2001: 55). This method enabled me to witness and apprehend\n(on several occasions) how fashion models deal with food in relation to their\nbodies. As a participant observer, I learned how models eat at different times\nand in various situations. I also learned about the rationale behind it, by simul-\ntaneously engaging in `food talk' with them. At a model's home, I engaged in\ncooking and eating supper with her. While going out to bars and clubs in\nWarsaw, Paris and Brussels, I engaged in drinking with models. Working as a\nstylist assistant, a director's assistant or as a model myself, I closely observed\nhow food was dealt with, or shunned, in back stages of fashion shows and shoots.\nObservations were written down in field reports and analysed thematically.\nComparing these different but mutually complementary sources resulted in com-\nprehensive, `thick descriptive' ethnographic narratives of models' eating practices,\ntheir food classifications and the institutional food system in which these practices\nand classifications make sense.\nGood, bad, dangerous and healthy foods\nFashion modelling is a physically, emotionally and personally demanding profes-\nized by high levels of implicit and explicit forms of discipline and control (Mears,\nspecific physical features that comply with institutional standards of tallness,\nyouthfulness, slenderness and \u00ad very often \u00ad whiteness as well (Entwistle and\naesthetic conventions: once under contract, they are disciplined to maintain or\nimprove their bodies through body work. While skin-color and body-length are\nfixed, body-size can be altered. When starting at an agency, models' body meas-\nurements are often explicitly assessed by means of a measure tape. As they are\nfrequently required to size down, young models quickly learn to turn their body\ninto an object that they rigorously monitor and work upon (Mears and Finlay,\nthe main and most crucial body practice fashion models engage in.\nProfessionals in fashion modelling believe that many, if not most, foodstuffs are\nobstructive to maintaining or attaining the required model-body. For both male\nand female fashion models, the greatest challenge for models is to apply the stand-\nard of slenderness, which takes on more extreme levels at the high-end of modelling\n(Van der Laan, 2015). Beginning models unavoidably deal with slenderness when\nthey enter the field. Agents, clients, designers and coaches, who uphold fashion\naesthetics, socialize models into their role of embodying them. A considerable part\nof learning how to be a model consists of becoming knowledgeable about good and\nsafe, bad and dangerous foods. Classifying foods into these institutionally relevant\ncategories is an important part of modelling.\nFocusing on these classifications, this section unravels the knowledges on food\nthat circulate in the field of fashion modelling. These knowledges sometimes\ncontradict each other and are not necessarily factual. I refer to them as food beliefs\nthat provide guidance in assessing models' eating practices in terms of what is\ngood. As such, food beliefs form the basis for moral judgements models make\nabout themselves and others, and other fashion professionals make about them (cf.\nAlthough the viewpoints of various informants are presented, I discuss the\nbeliefs of two informants in particular: Natasha, a female commercial model\nfrom Amsterdam, and Timothy, a French self-proclaimed model coach. They rep-\nresent two groups in the field with different tasks. Natasha is illustrative of models\nwho classify foods according to certain beliefs about their effects. Her classifica-\ntions of good and bad foods, as well as her eating practices, do not always corres-\npond with those of other models. But the fact that she classifies food, like Nahima\nfrom the introduction, is typical. By simultaneously discussing, preparing and\neating food together, I learned how beliefs, classifications and practices relate:\nNatasha's food beliefs result in categorical food classifications upon which she\nengages in specific eating practices. Model coach Timothy, on the other hand, is\nrepresentative of models' `socializers'. This professional group, consisting of\nagents, clients, nutritionists, coaches, but also stylists and designers, upholds and\nenforces bodily standards and fulfils a pedagogical task of influencing models'\nbehaviour towards their own bodies.\nI meet Natasha, a 19-year-old model, at a local fashion event in the city centre of\nAmsterdam. We subsequently get together several times to talk about her model-\nling career. After our second interview in a bistro, Natasha invites me to her home\nto cook dinner and eat together. I happily accept her invitation. In her small kit-\nchen we sort out the products she has bought and we discuss the foods we will eat.\nNatasha elaborates on the foodstuffs that make her put on weight and how she tries\nto avoid that. Like many female models, Natasha has collected information on\ncalories and physical effects of every foodstuff entering our conversation. This\nevening we prepare baked vegetables with spices and chicken. Our meal does not\ninclude carbohydrate loading foods like rice, potatoes, bread or pasta. Natasha\ntells me she never buys or prepares these kinds of food. During lunch, which\ntypically consists of sandwiches in the Netherlands, Natasha eats soup (without\ncroutons) or salad (without bread on the side). The majority of female models\navoid carbohydrates. These are generally thought of as detrimental to a model's\nbody. According to model coach Timothy \u00ad a former professional basketball player\nand much concerned with physical activity and metabolic rates \u00ad carbohydrates\nstock up as fat when they do not get burned. Moreover, Natasha adds, high-carb\nfoods are difficult to measure:\nAlthough pasta and bread are healthier than chocolate and cheese, you never cook\njust five pieces of pasta. You always eat a lot of it, always too much. If you start eating\npasta, you keep on eating, even though you don't need that amount of carbohydrates\nfor your body. That's how you gain weight. One piece of chocolate is satisfying. So in\nthe end, that's much better.\nNatasha and I cut up several ingredients and start cooking. She pours a small dash\nof olive oil in a frying pan and heats it up on the stove. She tells me she never uses\nbutter when preparing meals. During periods when she is extra attentive to her\nweight, she uses a shallow layer of water instead of oil to keep the food from\nburning. We bake 800 grams (two bags containing exactly 400 grams) of mixed,\npre-chopped vegetables together with the garlic and ginger which we have cut\nourselves. While I stir the vegetables, Natasha dry-grills pieces of seasoned chicken\nbreast. Natasha only eats `white meat' \u00ad predominantly chicken breast and white\nfish. Like most female models, she avoids red meat, charcuterie and pork. I am told\nthat these `coloured meats' contain a lot of fat and proteins. Proteins are not\nnecessarily seen as bad, because they are beneficial for generating muscle tissue.\nHowever, when models do not exercise their muscles, proteins are assumed to\nturn into fat. Coach Timothy notes that especially high-end male and female\nmodels should be cautious with eating red meat: these models mainly engage in\ncardiovascular workouts, because they require a slim and straight instead of\na muscular body. Female commercial models, who are valued for their slender\nbut slightly curved and toned shapes, are allowed to eat red meat only very\nrarely. Male commercial models, on the contrary, often embody a more hetero-\nnormative masculinity (Entwistle and Mears, 2013) that aesthetically translates\ninto a muscular, v-shaped body-type, with broad, well-defined shoulders and an\nabdominal six (or eight) pack. Since they train their muscles frequently, they are\nsupposed to benefit from feeding their bodies proteins by eating red meat. Timothy\nargues, however, that models who want to lose weight should avoid all kinds\nof meat and most types of fish. Interestingly, he classifies fish according to its\ncolour, as Natasha does for meat. They both assume that the whiter the meat,\nthe lesser the grease:\nBetter eat fish instead. But never eat salmon, it's very fat. It's not white fish anyway, so\nyou should avoid it. This goes for tuna too by the way. So sushi should be put aside as\nwell. If you have a real objective you must be strict like that. And go to the gym,\nmorning and night.\nTo give our meal some additional flavour, Natasha pours Japanese soy sauce over\nit. This is the only sauce she uses, because unlike others, it contains few calories, no\nfat and little sugar. According to Timothy, sauces are problematic and often spoil a\npotentially good meal. Here, the classification of good reflects an appreciation of\nlow-calorie foods:\nAt night my models eat steamed vegetables, and they can eat as many as they like. But\nthen there's the question of the sauce. People just put too much sauce on everything.\nDressings, with oil! It's catastrophic. Better put some herbs in your salad instead of\nsauce.\nBoth Natasha and Timothy use caloric value as an index of the food hierarchy\n(cf. Douglas, 1972: 64) and disapprove of foods with carbohydrates. They rank\nvegetables higher than any other foodstuff.\nDinner is cooked and Natasha and I start to eat. Along with the meal we drink\nwater with lemon squeezed into it, which is Natasha's favourite drink: `it's healthy,\nfree of calories and lemon stimulates the burning of fat'. Natasha never drinks\nsugary sodas, fruit juices or milk. This is contrary to other models who drink full-\nfat milk in their cafe\n\u00b4 lattes, usually as a stand-in for breakfast or lunch, during\ninterviews. Coach Timothy is sceptical about models consuming dairy, and any\nother fat-containing foodstuffs:\nModels should avoid drinking milk. Dairy makes you fat. Yoghurt is not bad obvi-\nously, but better use soy products instead. Eggs should also be avoided, the yolk is\nvery fat. It's a catastrophe to eat the yolk. If you only eat the white it's fine. No nuts,\nno almonds. It's all too fat. Better eat white fish instead of nuts.\nThe meal is finished, which is the moment I usually get cravings for sweet things.\nMy thoughts about cookies bring me to asking Natasha whether and when she eats\nsugary foods. She tells me that fruits are her primary source of good sugar. In the\nmorning she eats fresh fruit mixed with low-fat yoghurt, usually half an apple and a\nkiwi or some strawberries. Like Nahima, she does not drink fruit juices, because\nthey supposedly contain added, bad, processed sugars. Even when nothing has\nbeen added, the condensed nature of fruit juice \u00ad `imagine three apples, one\nbanana and eight strawberries in one drink!' \u00ad makes it a bomb of calories to\nNatasha.\nAlthough eating fruit is deemed better than drinking it, there are limits to how\nmuch fruit models can eat. Macy from Amsterdam tells me she sometimes has the\nmunchies and binges on a whole bag of apples: `It's very bad to do that, because\nyou eat way too much sugar' (Macy, 22, Amsterdam). In addition, not all kinds of\nfruits are allowed to be eaten by models. Coach Timothy notes:\n[Models should eat] no sugar. Very little fruit, except fruit containing lots of water,\nlike watermelon. Bananas are forbidden, because they contain most sugar and fat.\nApples are not bad, they're okay, but you shouldn't let yourself go with them either.\nThen, finally, there is the issue of timing. According to several models, fruits cannot\nbe eaten after a certain time of the day. High-end model Mirthe from Warsaw\nexplains:\nWe can eat fruits, but not every fruit, because fruits have a lot of sugar. We can eat\nwatermelon, but that's not there right now [in winter]. So we can eat apples. But you\ncan only eat fruits before three in the afternoon, because later in the day you have to\nburn all these calories, but you can't. (Mirthe, 20, Paris/Warsaw)\nThe issue of timing relates to beliefs about the body, and how it reacts to foods.\nFruit is classified according to calories and sugar level, but importantly, also by\nhow it is thought to interact with the human metabolism, which is believed to\nbecome slower as a day progresses. The timing of eating is also relevant with regard\nto immediate effects on the body's visible surface. Various female models refrain\nfrom eating the morning or evening prior to a photo shoot or runway show,\nbecause they require a flat belly when appearing in the spotlight. Especially\nwhen showing lingerie or swimwear, models fear a full stomach makes their belly\nlook bloated. Sometimes, not eating before a job is explicitly advised by clients:\nIn Japan . . . when you have the job they call you and say: `remember, don't eat break-\nfast!' Because your stomach will be blown. (Rita, 27, Warsaw)\nAlthough Natasha frowns upon models who `starve themselves and don't have a\nhealthy and regular diet', she too refrains from eating the morning prior to body-\nrevealing photo shoots. The day and evening before a job she eats, but abstains\nfrom foods that fill up her stomach too much. Rather than a large plate of vege-\ntables, she will eat something nutritious and small, like a piece of cheese or a small\nsandwich \u00ad foods she regularly avoids.\nThe way the body responds to different foods is seen as predictable, even cal-\nculable. For example, when Timothy formulates nutritional advice to models, he\nalso considers how much models exercise, as this affects the amount of carbohy-\ndrates models can eat: `if you want to eat bread and pasta, the gym should be your\nvery best friend.. . . When you do only a little bit of exercise every day, I guess you\nshouldn't [eat that]'. He seems to think of models' bodies as machines, of which the\ninput (eaten calories) and output (burned calories) can be precisely quantified\nNatasha speaks of her body not as a machine but as a learning organism that\ncan be purposefully sensitized about what it is enduring. During our dinner,\nNatasha eats in a concentrated manner, taking well-measured portions onto her\nfork and chewing meticulously. She finishes her plate calmly, almost systematically.\nShe explains the more you chew on food before swallowing, the better you digest it.\nMoreover, slow eating prevents overeating, because the body gets enough time to\nrealize it is being fed and becoming full. Through the practice of slow eating,\nNatasha makes her body `aware' of being filled with food.\nFinally, the body is believed to be in need of sanitizing. Some foodstuffs, but\nalso skin cosmetics and polluted air, are seen as contaminating the body. Fat, for\nexample, is dangerous for clogging the pores, in addition to its high caloric value.\nFor maintaining the clear and smooth skin that is required from fashion models,\nthe body should be cleaned through drinking lots of water and green tea. Herbal\ntea and water, Natasha says, are healthy for flushing toxins out of her body. Coach\nTimothy agrees: `Green tea is detoxing. It allows the body to expel stuff, so it's\ngood for the skin'.\nClassifying foods is a recurrent practice in the field of fashion modelling.\nImportantly, this not only results in categorizations of foods (see Table 1).\nThrough the practice of classification models are also positioned and position\nthemselves in relation to food: a `good model' knows what (not) to eat in order\nto maintain his or her model-body up to standards. Food categories are formulated\nin moral terms and express the institutionally entrenched aesthetic purpose of\nremaining or becoming thin. Therefore, calories especially are perceived as danger-\nous, and even immoral, as they potentially relate to fat. Hence, they are rarely\ndiscussed simply as a unit of energy. Accordingly, the standard of slenderness\nrenders other potential food categories, like tasty, satisfying or affordable,\nirrelevant.\nFrom external control to self-control\nBased upon their classifications models act upon food. However, models are often\nyoung and inexperienced when they enter the field and first have to learn how to\n`eat like a model'. This requires socialization, taken up by fashion professionals like\nagents, clients, coaches or nutritionists, who regulate or train models' attitudes\ntowards food. This renders something seemingly personal and mundane, like decid-\ning whether or not to eat a banana at lunch time, part of deliberate professional\ndecision-making. Modelling agents especially are inclined to regulate models' food-\nintake. However, some show themselves more involved than others. Maggie, the\nTable 1.

When models work abroad, some agents accompany them to restaurants,\nwhere they control what and how much food models eat:\nIn Italy they [the agencies] told me to eat sushi. Models have so much trouble over\nthere with all that pasta and pizza around. So they check on you, what you eat. The\nagencies take you out to dinner in the evening so they know what you order. (Rita, 27,\nWarsaw)\nThe external control of models' food-intake does not always happen sensibly.\nTalking with Mirthe from Warsaw, I notice she looks somewhat feeble. She\nexplains she has just finished a lingerie shoot, for which she abstained from\neating the previous evening. Unfortunately, she did not have the opportunity to\neat during or after the shoot, meaning she had not eaten for a full day. Mirthe\ndiscloses that, in the past, food has been kept away from her purposefully:\nThey give you food occasionally, like salad or a sandwich, but sometimes they say: `no\nyou can't eat, you're a model, shut up'. . . . When I was very young, 15, I was doing a\nshow here in Warsaw. They didn't give me one meal, from six a.m. to eight p.m. I only\ngot a small sandwich. Everyone was on water and cigarettes, which is kind of the diet\nbackstage. . . . I was going to the runway, but I was weak and I fainted. An ambulance\nbrought me to the hospital. One year later I was doing the same show and they gave\nme food, even chocolate! So they learned from it.\nSuch meticulous, intrusive management of models' eating is rare: most models tell\nme they are self-reliant in controlling their food-intake, because their agencies\nconsider it an individual affair. Offering models none or imprecise advice, their\nguidance often limits itself to up-close surveillance and regulation of hip, waist and\nchest circumventions by means of a measure tape. Models are simply told to eat\nless whenever they measure too many centimetres. Starting at an agency in Paris,\nfashion model Daphne heard she had to lose three centimetres from her hips: `I was\nlike, ``okay, how should I do that?'' He said: ``don't throw up and don't take\ndrugs''. That was about all the advice I got' (Daphne, 21, Amsterdam).\nAlthough the aesthetic result of models' eating practices \u00ad slenderness \u00ad is a\ncollective goal, paradoxically, striving to achieve it through controlled eating is not\nalways supported, let alone recognized, by professionals working with models.\nCoach Timothy critically notes:\nAll their agencies tell them is to withhold food from themselves, but they don't get into\nthe question of how to do that. I know girls that only eat white cheese. Morning, day\nand night. Only that. In the morning they add some granola, at night they throw in\nsome strawberries. End of story, good night. It's ridiculous. You have to eat varied.\nTo eat very little, but varied.\nTimothy is concerned about models `who do stupid things' to remain or become\nslender, like eating only one kind of foodstuff, such as white cheese or broccoli.\nAlthough Timothy deems this both unhealthy as well as impossible to keep up,\nsuch monotonous regimes enable models to precisely calculate their caloric intake:\nit is a way of staying in control. Inversely, eating varied is likely to cause insecurity,\nas losing count is felt as losing control. What makes matters worse, he claims, is the\nfact that fashion models generally live irregular lives, which makes eating regularly,\nhealthy and varied extra difficult:\nModels are on and off the airplane constantly, working in different countries. They\nexperience jetlag, miss out on sleep . . . and can't cook their own meals. When the\nmoney comes in they want to relax for a while. Of course, understandable. But\nthen they take a holiday and let themselves go. They eat, drink, spend their money.\nI say they'd better get back into the gym straight away and save up their money to\ninvest in a house or education. But instead they gain weight and once they want to get\nback to work, because they're out of money, they have to go on some crazy diet,\nbecause their sizes aren't right anymore.\nTimothy is obviously sceptical of the idea that models are able to `give themselves a\nbreak' from time to time, depicting this as a way of disturbing models' physical\nbalance. Conversely, Natasha believes she actually maintains balance by not deny-\ning herself pleasures of taste. She wants herself to stay sane and her profession to\nremain humane, which is why she allows herself a piece of chocolate or cheese every\nnow and then. Importantly, Natasha is speaking about a mental balance instead of\na physical one: `If you really never eat those things, you go crazy. I won't eat a plate\nof spaghetti or a chunk of white bread, but a little bit of sugar or fat at times is\nokay. It's all a matter of quantity'. According to Timothy however, in-betweens\npose models too big a challenge:\nTaking in-betweens, like a piece of chocolate, will make you think about chocolate.\nThe next morning you pass by the cupboard where you've stored the rest of the bar,\nand it will lure you. You'll think `well I took a piece yesterday and I didn't gain\nweight, so why couldn't I take another little piece today!' You have to be strong in\nyour mind, you see.\nIndeed, such `controlled decontrolling' might be the most challenging form of food-\ncontrol, as it requires the highest level of self-control (Elias and Dunning, 1986).\nAppetite, the desire to eat, is a compelling force (Mennell, 1996: 21). This goes for\nhunger even more.\nIn back-stages of shows and shoots, models are sometimes treated with sweets\nand snacks, by which their self-control is tested. In Paris, Amsterdam and Warsaw,\nI observed models surrounded with `bad foods': candies, cookies, crisps or cheese\nsandwiches \u00ad all things models try to avoid eating \u00ad while good foods, such as\nsoups or salads, were absent. To resist temptations of sugar and fat, some models\nbring their own food to the set. During Warsaw Fashion Weekend, several models\nwere nibbling on self-brought rice cakes and whole-wheat slices of bread, avoiding\nthe jars of sweets.\nAn often mentioned bad foodstuff that entices the appetite to the extent that\nmodels lose their self-control are crisps. Commercial model Lynn (19, Amsterdam)\nused to habitually eat crisps with her boyfriend. Each time she opened a bag she\ncould not bring herself to stop eating until it was empty. She gained weight, which\ngot her into trouble: `My agency deleted my pictures from their website. They told\nme they'd place them back only after I would lose at least three centimetres around\nmy hips'. Lynn's agency fully held her responsible for her added centimetres\n(cf. O'Neill and Silver, 2017: 121). Eventually, Lynn took hard measures to\nregain self-control: to refrain from eating crisps she started spending her evenings\nat a gym instead of with her boyfriend, with whom she broke up.\nFinally, some fashion professionals entirely repudiate the idea that eating is an\nimportant and complicated part of models' body work. An Amsterdam stylist\nclaims that `good models shouldn't need to mind what they eat. If they do, I tell\nthem to give it up, because they are simply not fit to be a model' (Dave, 44,\nAmsterdam). This narrative defines good models as uncontrolled eaters, and estab-\nlishes a norm of effortlessness. Yet, for most models eating good is a challenge.\nA significant food practice is therefore to not be straightforward about food.\nSeveral models demonstrate they are good models by emphasizing that modelling\ncomes natural to them, without making effort (cf. Holla, 2016). Other models avoid\ntalking about their own dealings with food, while being blunt about how other\nmodels deal with food in extreme and `wrong' ways. They tell second-hand stories\nabout crash dieting, binge-eating, vomiting, drinking vinegar, eating tissues or\nreplacing food with drugs. Chantal tells me that she `lived in a model house with\nthese girls who only ate apple compote. I was really the odd one out over there'\n(Chantal, 22, Amsterdam). Rita notes that: `there are some girls that have such\nfucked ideas. I had this roommate, she was drinking pure vinegar after a meal.\nBecause she heard it helped digest' (Rita, 27, Warsaw).\nWhile I am unsure whether all of these stories reflect actual practices, they surely\nserve models to draw symbolic boundaries between the self and others (Lamont,\n1992). In these narratives, it is always other models who are `out of control' or `try\ntoo hard' to become or remain slender. These symbolic boundaries clearly show\ntwo main moral imperatives on food in fashion modelling: models should eat in\nboth a controlled and effortless way.\nModels try to solve the moral paradox through alternatively framing their\neating practices. Even the ones with plain, austere nutritional regimes, like\nNahima from the introduction, normalize their eating practices, using the careless\nexpression of `watching my food'. They emphasize they do not diet, which is seen\nas a forced, unnatural and therefore illegitimate way of eating. By contrast,\nthrough watching their food models demonstrate they engage in a sane,\nhealthy and unforced way of eating, without losing track of what they put into\ntheir bodies.\nImportantly, the taboo of (overly) controlled eating, which spurs fashion models\nto demonstrate that they are effortless, seems to hold especially for female models.\nA possible explanation for the genderedness of this taboo is that it links to the\npersistent risk of institutional weight and body-size requirements to induce eating\nis perceived to be ultimately a feminine risk, this might explain why mostly female\nmodels go out of their way to demonstrate they do not obsess over food.\nThe moralities of control and effortlessness complicate eating as a professional\naesthetic practice. By disallowing openness on food as an important issue, and\ncreating a taboo about putting in effort, models are left by themselves in their\ntask to embody slender aesthetics. While perpetually caught up in body work for\naesthetic purposes, they are simultaneously concerned with concealing it. The per-\nception of modelling success as an individual responsibility pushes models toward\nAccordingly, models are held fully accountable for their bodies: any failure to\nconform to aesthetic standards is interpreted as an individual lack of discipline and\nself-control. This reinforces the winner-takes-all principle of fashion modelling\n(Mears, 2011). In the quest for success, the law of the strongest applies. Models\nwho are `out of control', such as Lynn, receive little mercy and irrevocably dis-\nappear from the stage. In turn, overly self-controlling models, who `try too hard'\nare also viewed as unable to make it in the long run. Finally, eating the right way\nis a three-fold challenge for fashion models: an aesthetic, moral as well as a\npersonal one.\nA gendered division of food?\nBeliefs on how the model-body reacts to food, and the rules on how it should be\ncontrolled, differ for male and female models, as their bodies are considered to\nreact somewhat differently to food. While fashion modelling mostly revolves\naround feminine looks, female model-bodies are perceived a jeopardy. Models\nand other professionals consider female bodies vulnerable to carbohydrates and\nfat. Hence, they are as dangerous as they are eminent. Conversely, male model-\nbodies are perceived more resistant to physiological infringements of food. As the\nmale model-body is believed to be less violable, practices of controlled eating are\nprone to be defined as feminine.\nHowever, the genderedness of food control intersects with the division between\nhigh and low aesthetics that exists in modelling, making it a `high-end concern' as\nwell (Mears, 2011; Van der Laan, 2015). The `sexual division of dieting' (Germov\nand Williams, 1996) only holds in commercial modelling, where female models\nwatch their food, but male models repetitively state they eat and drink whatever\nthey crave. Through this, they enact an appropriate heteronormative masculinity\n(Connell, 1995). Felix, for example, says: `I eat normally. Also bread, French fries\nand Coca Cola. As long as I go to the gym I'm okay' (Felix, 24, Amsterdam).\nInstead of rendering his body passive by withholding it from eating, Felix endows\nhimself an active role, by managing his body through exercise \u00ad a self-objectifying\npractice that compensates for uncontrolled eating and is gender-role confirming.\nConversely, high-end male models engage in controlled eating in rather similar\nways as female models. Jim, a high-end model working for luxury brands such as\nPrada and Jil Sander, watches his food to a considerable extent. I meet him in the\nhome of a befriended model, where they are planning to cook dinner together.\nThey agree on preparing carrot soup and a salad. While making the grocery list, he\nrequests the salad to be without meat and says he cannot drink wine along with\nthe meal, because: `I'm going back to Milan soon. I have to be strict with myself'\nThe contrast between male and female eating practices dissolves the further one\nmoves towards higher-ends of fashion modelling, where gender distinctions are less\npronounced and bodily aesthetic standards for both male and female models are\ncharacterized as androgen, at times non-sexual or even adolescent. Overly visible\nsigns of a body/self that is masculine or feminine are avoided: all high-end models\nare required to be thin and straight. Finally, food becomes more gender-neutral\ntowards the higher-ends of fashion modelling.\nDiscussion and conclusion\nThis paper investigated the relation between food, the body and morality in the\nfield of fashion modelling and found that the food beliefs that structure the aes-\nthetic labour of fashion models render `eating like a model' complicated and exten-\nsive. More than has been recognized in modelling studies so far, eating is a\ncontinuous and reflexive form of body work that is decidedly essential to\nmodels' aesthetic labour.\nFashion professionals classify different foods and ways of eating them as more\nor less obstructive to the embodiment of slenderness. Caloric food in particular is\nframed as dangerous (cf. Douglas, 2003) and needing to be controlled in different\nways. Nonetheless, controlled eating entails more than counting calories: it is about\neating a variety of good foods, in the right quantities, at the right time. Food is\nvalued for its low caloric value, but also because it is believed to stimulate diges-\ntion, to detoxify the body, or to burn body-fat. However, food is believed to have\ndifferent effects on male and female model-bodies, which results in gendered food\nrules. This genderedness intersects with an institutional division between high and\nlow aesthetics, which inclines high-end male models to control their food-intake\njust like female models.\nEating the right way is a three-fold challenge in fashion modelling: an aesthetic,\nmoral as well as a personal one. First, eating is geared explicitly at aesthetic\nprofessional purposes and is therefore a job requirement for fashion models.\nTheir decisions on whether, what, or how much to eat include a recurring differ-\nentiation between their selves as choosing subjects and their bodies as shapable and\ncontrollable objects (cf. Czerniawski, 2015). With every bite they (do not) take,\nmodels are prone to consider their professional status as aesthetic objects to be\ndisplayed: they are `permanent overseers of their own bodies' (Mears and Finlay,\nSecond, food beliefs include moral imperatives that further complicate good\neating for fashion models. By framing food-control as an individual responsibility\nand slenderness as an individual achievement, models are thrown back on their\nown capacities of self-control, and they are also held fully accountable when they\nfail to comply to slender aesthetics. Controlled eating ultimately renders models\npreoccupied with self-surveillance and self-objectification, and subjugated by agen-\ncies and clients. Food beliefs therefore reinforce power-inequalities between models\nand other professionals.\nAlong with the imperative of food control exists the idea that `truly good\nmodels' achieve aesthetic standards effortlessly. This creates a taboo around prac-\ntices of food-control which, paradoxically, de-legitimizes controlled eating. This\ndoes not result, however, in a casual attitude towards food, but rather renders\npractices concealed. Food is rarely not an issue for models, even \u00ad or especially \u00ad\nwhen food is absent or treated as a non-topic. However, the moral paradox of\ncontrol and effortlessness does result in normalizing narratives on food-control.\nEspecially female models normalize their sober eating practices by using the care-\nless expression of `watching my food'. The taboo of (overly) controlled eating is\npossibly explained by the persistent risk of eating disorders, caused by the indus-\ntry's weight and body-size requirements. As disordered eating is perceived to be\nultimately a feminine risk, this might explain why mostly female models go out of\ntheir way to demonstrate they do not obsess over food.\nThis analysis of model's food practices has implications for theories of aesthetic\nlabour and aesthetic capital, as well as studies of food. First, the importance of\nfood and eating practices stretches beyond fashion modelling, as it pertains to\naesthetic professions more generally. This paper empirically substantiates the\nthesis of Entwistle and Wissinger (2006) on the enduring and demanding nature\nof the aesthetic labour and adds that the centrality of food and eating in the work\nand life of aesthetic labourers is the primary cause for the personal and the pro-\nfessional, the physical and the emotional, to seep into each other to such a great\nextent. Second, the food system in fashion modelling can enhance interpretations\nof how people in society at large deal with food in relation to their bodies. Against\nthe backdrop of an increasing aesthetization of work and life (Featherstone, 1991),\nbeauty has become a quality that `pays' and hence a source of inequality\n(Hamermesh, 2011). As the ones who are not seen as attractive miss out and\nfind themselves disadvantaged, making sure the body is slender is an imperative\nthat exists well beyond aesthetic industries.\nFinally, looking at eating in a delineated institutional context potentially\nenriches understandings of contemporary foody cultures (cf. Cairns et al., 2010)\nthat consist of ethically-consuming, upper/middle-class urbanites that embrace\nfood-reflexive life-styles (cf. Guthman, 2003). Models are possibly a vanguard of\nsuch social developments. In fashion modelling, eating demarcates boundaries:\ncultural ones, based on gendered bodies and high-low aesthetics, and moral\nones, based on the seemingly conflicting norms of control and effortlessness. Just as\n`good eating models' are identified \u00ad by others and themselves \u00ad as good models (cf.\nHolla, 2016), contemporary foodies, slow-eaters, vegans, flexitarians and other\n(non-professional) reflexive eaters use food to morally position themselves vis-a\n` -\nvis others. There is a difference though. In contrast to these non-professional\nreflexive eaters, models are unequivocally held accountable for their eating: they\nmight lose their job over it.\n"
