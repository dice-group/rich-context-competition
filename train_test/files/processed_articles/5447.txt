However, the literature con-\ncentrates on finding average treatment effects (ATE), which\nassumes that all of the treated households get the same impact\nfrom program participation. Studies in other settings show\nthat treatment effects can vary widely, not only across sub-\ngroups but also along the distribution of outcomes (Bitler,\nThis evidence of varying treatment effects is not just an\neconometric curiosity; it also accords well with what may\ninterest policymakers. For example, finding that a credit pro-\ngram had much larger impacts for male borrowers would\nlikely prove influential if policymakers were interested in\nclosing gender gaps. Hence, a theme in the literature evaluat-\ning impacts of credit is to compare average treatment effects\nfor sub-groups defined by observable characteristics (e.g.,\nage, education, and gender). However, the similarly interest-\ning comparison of whether the impact is the same along the\noutcome distribution, such as for households with already\nhigh consumption versus those with low consumption, or\nalready high health care spending versus the low health care\nservice spenders, is rarely done. This sort of heterogeneity in\ntreatment effects can be studied using a quantile treatment\neffects (QTE) estimator.\nIn this article, we report QTE estimates of the impact that\naccess to credit has on the health care spending of poor\nhouseholds in peri-urban Vietnam. We used a survey\ndesigned by the authors and applied to a sample of poor\nhouseholds that are all under the urban poverty line.1 Hence,\nin typical approaches to studying heterogeneity in treatment\neffects, this sample would be one identifiable sub-group,\nwho would have an average treatment effect estimated and\nassumed to apply to all members of the group. Our estimated\nresults show that such an approach hides considerable\nwithin-group heterogeneity in the treatment effects.\nThe remainder of this note is organized as follows. The\nnext section describes the data collection and estimation\nframework. The empirical results are reported in Section 3,\nand the final section concludes.\nData and Analytical Framework\nA sample of 411 borrowing and non-borrowing households\nwas interviewed in early 2008 in the peri-urban District 9,\n1Vietnam National University, Hanoi, Vietnam\n2University of Waikato, Hamilton, New Zealand\nCorresponding Author:\nTuyen Quang Tran, University of Economics and Business, Vietnam\nEmail: tuyentq@vnu.edu.vn\nHeterogeneous Credit Impacts on Health\nCare Spending of the Poor in Peri-Urban\nAreas, Vietnam: Quantile Treatment\nEffect Estimation\nTinh Thanh Doan1,2, Gibson John2, and Tuyen Quang Tran1\n Keywords\ncredit, health-care budget share, quantile treatment effect\n2 SAGE Open\nHo Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Because our focus is on micro-\ncredit impacts on poor households, the sample was selected\nfrom a list of poor households whose initial income per cap-\nita was below the HCMC general poverty line of Vietnam\nDong (VND) 6 million (approximately US$1 per day). The\nhouseholds were successfully interviewed, accounting for\n26% of the total number of poor households in each of the\nselected wards in the district. The interviewed sample pro-\ntive for the poor group whose initial income per capita is\nbelow the poverty line at the survey time in the district but\nwill not be representative for Ho Chi Minh City nor for\nVietnam.\nThe survey was designed to collect data on household and\nindividual demographic\u00adeconomic variables, commune\ncharacteristics, household durable and fixed assets, child\nschooling and education expenditure, health care, food, non-\nfood, housing expenditure, and borrowing activities. I also\nutilized global positioning system (GPS) receivers to collect\ndata on locations of households and facilities to measure dis-\ntances from each household to facilities.\nThe surveyed areas are located in the most dynamic\nregion, Ho Chi Minh City, in Vietnam. The city is the biggest\neconomic\u00adfinancial center of the country; it accounted for\nof its gross domestic product (GDP). The city economy has\nrecently been growing at above 10% per annum.\nThe surveyed district is the 5th lowest population density\ndistrict and one of the peri-urban districts of HCMC. When it\nwas established in 1997, the district relied heavily on agri-\ncultural production, but its economic structure has changed\ndrastically due to current fast industrialization and urbaniza-\ntion. The average growth rate of industrial production and\nis heterogeneous. Some wards are very highly populated, for\nPhu A (TNPA; 6,546 people/km2), while others are relatively\nlow, for example, Long Phuoc (LP; 300 people/km2) and\nLong Truong (577 people/km2). The main economic activi-\nties of the district are non-farm economic activities such as\nindustrial production, construction, and services. For our\nsample, 72% of household heads are small traders, house-\nwives, casual workers, factory workers, and the jobless.\nWe use a quantile regression (QR) estimator, which exam-\nines the effects of the regressors on the dependent variable at\nvarious points on the conditional distribution of responses\n(e.g., at the 25th and 75th percentiles). The model specifies\nthe th - quantile (0 <  < 1) of conditional distribution of the\ndependent variable; given a set of covariates x\ni\n, and assume\nthat residual distributions of each quantile are normally dis-\ntributed, we have,\nQ y X X\n  \n \ni i i\n|\n( ) = + \u00d7 (1)\nwhere y\ni\nis the outcome of interest (the budget share for\nhealth care in this case) for household i, and x\ni\nis a set of\nexplanatory variables including an indicator for credit par-\nticipation and variables measuring the household head's sex,\nage, marital status, and education, along with household size,\nhousehold expenditure, initial income and assets, and loca-\ntion of the dwelling. The treatment variable of interest is\ncredit participation, which equals one if a household had\nreceived any loans in the 24 months prior to the survey and\nzero otherwise. A total of 304 households were borrowers,\nand 107 households were non-borrowers under this defini-\ntion. The estimator (Equation 1) is the solution to the follow-\ning minimization problem (see Cameron & Trivedi, 2009):\nQ y X\ny x y\ni i\ni\nn\ni\ni y x\ni\ni i\n \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n( ) = -\n\n \n\n= - + -\n( )\n=\n\n\n\nmin\nmin | | |\n:\ni\ni y x\ni\ni i\nx\n:\n|\n<\n -\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn other words, this is the solution to a problem where the sum\nof the weighted absolute value of the residuals is minimized.\nAs  is increased, the entire distribution of outcome y is traced,\nconditional on x\ni\n. We estimate \n\nfor a particular th quantile of\ndistribution rather than . If we estimate  for , then much\nmore weight is placed on prediction for observations with y \nx\ni.\n than for observations with y < x\ni\n. (i.e., 1 - ).\nWhen QR is adapted to investigate heterogeneity in pro-\ngram impacts, the QTE of Heckman, Smith, and Clements\nand Y\nbe the outcome of interest for\nthe treated (1) and comparison groups (0). F\n(y|x\ni\n) = Pr[Y\n\ny|x\ni\n] and F\n(y|x\ni\n) = Pr[Y\n y|x\ni\n] are the corresponding cumu-\nlative distribution functions of Y\nand Y\nconditional on x\ni\n. If\n denotes the quantile of each distribution, then y\n\n(T) = inf{y:\nF\nT\n(y|x)  }, T = 0, 1 (treatment status) where \"inf\" is the\nsmallest value of y\n\nthat meets the condition in the braces.\nFor example, y\n= inf{y: F\nT\ntile treatment effect at quantile th is defined as \n\n= y\n\n- y\n\n(T = 0), and the \n\nis the difference between the outcome\nof interest for the treatment and comparison groups at a par-\nticular th quantile. In other words, the QTE shows how the\ntreatment effect changes across specified percentiles of the\noutcome distribution.\nThe QTE relies on the rank-invariance assumption, that\nthe relative value (rank) of the potential outcome for a given\nhousehold would be the same under assignment to either\ntreatment or comparison group (Firpo, 2007). However,\nDoan et al. 3\nbecause outcomes for the same household may differ from\none distribution to another based on observable and unob-\nservable characteristics, bounds have to be computed for the\nQTE (Heckman et al., 1997). Even without rank invariance,\nthe QTE may still be meaningful as policymakers may be\ninterested in the marginal distributions of the potential out-\ncomes. In such cases, QTE is simply the difference between\nthe same quantile of the marginal distributions of outcomes\nfor the treated households and for comparison group\nhouseholds.\nHeterogeneity in the outcome variable may correspond\neither to variation across particular sub-groups (or cohorts)\nin the population that would generate a local average treat-\nment effect (LATE) or to impacts of unobservable character-\nistics (Angrist, 2004). In this article, we assume that we have\na homogeneous population, so there are no sub-groups that\nwould have the LATE (and for whom a particular instrumen-\ntal variable might bind while it does not bind for others), and\nthat the heterogeneity in the outcomes comes from the ran-\ndom errors. Because we assume it is unobservables rather\nthan local treatment effects causing the heterogeneity, we do\nnot necessarily need an instrumental variable estimator\n(which can be combined with the QTE to address bias from\nselection on unobservable characteristics (Abadie, Angrist,\n& Imbens, 2002)). If good instruments are available, the\nQTE with instrumental variables (IQTE) may be more pre-\ncise than the conventional IV estimator at the median (Abadie\net al., 2002) in addition to addressing the potential selection\nbias. However, in previous results with the same data used\nhere, no good instruments are identified (Doan, Gibson, &\nHolmes, 2014), so we rely on the assumption that the selec-\ntion into the treatment is based on observables.\nEmpirical results\nTable 1 presents unconditional differences in monthly aver-\nage health care expenditure (in 1,000 Vietnam Dong) and in\nthe health care budget share. At all points in the distribution\nof health care spending considered here, households who\nwere borrowers spent more on health than their non-borrow-\ning counterparts. The households that borrowed had similar\ninitial income and assets to the non-borrowers, but higher\ncurrent total monthly consumption (appendix). So, one pos-\nsible reason for higher health care spending might be that the\nsame budget share generates more spending for richer house-\nholds. However, in fact, that is not the case; the borrowing\nhouseholds also are devoting larger shares of their budgets to\nhealth at all points in the distribution.\nTo see whether the higher health care spending of borrow-\ners across the distribution persists when we condition on\nexplanatory variables, we estimate QTE at the 25th, 50th,\nand 75th percentiles (Table 2). The table also presents ordi-\nnary least squares (OLS) estimates in the final column of\neach panel. The explanatory variables used are listed in the\nappendix. Our basic specification includes location, house-\nhold size, and expenditure per capita in addition to the credit\nparticipation treatment variable, while an extended specifi-\ncation adds the gender, age, marital status, and education of\nthe household head, and pre-treatment values of income per\ncapita and assets.2\nIn both the basic and extended specifications, there is con-\nsiderable heterogeneity in the treatment effects of credit on\nthe health care budget share (Table 2). For households with\nhealth budget shares below the median, access to credit is\nassociated with significantly higher health care spending.\nTable 1.

The same pattern is observed when using the\nextended model specification. In neither case would these\neffects be apparent when using OLS.\nThus, it appears that access to credit increases the health\ncare budget share of households who had lower health care\nbudget shares prior to their credit participation. This positive\neffect of credit is hidden when estimating an average treat-\nment effect, although the sample is for a homogeneous group\nof urban households from one district who are all below the\npoverty line.\nThere also appears to be some heterogeneity in the effect\nof per capita household expenditure (used as a proxy for per-\nmanent income) on the health care budget share. The OLS\nestimates suggest that the health care budget share rises by\nabout three percentage points for every one log point increase\n(approximately two standard deviations) in per capita expen-\nditure. However, this hides an effect (which is statistically\nsignificant in the extended specification) of the budget shares\nfalling with higher expenditure at the 25th percentile.\nConclusion and Limitations\nTreatment effects can vary widely, not only across sub-groups\nbut also along the distribution of outcomes. In this note, we pro-\nvide an example where our sample is all under the urban\npoverty line and would typically be considered one identifiable\nsub-group, for which an average treatment effect would be esti-\nmated. Yet we find considerable heterogeneity in treatment\neffects within this seemingly homogeneous sample, which\nwould be hidden if we only reported an average treatment effect.\nSpecifically, although OLS estimates of ATE show no sig-\nnificant effect of credit participation on health care budget\nshares, the QTE estimates show that credit has positive\nimpacts on health care budget shares for households with\nlow levels of health care spending. From a policy point of\nview, this suggests that facilitating access to credit sources\nmay be a significant factor in improving health status of the\nurban poor, and the policy may work better if it is better\ndesigned targeting the right families who need the help most.\nLand loss (due to urbanization) may be an issue in fast\ngrowing/urbanizing areas in HCMC as well as in other big\ncities in Vietnam and where the capital market is less devel-\noped then informal sector has a role to play in which inter-\npersonal relationship or social capital may affect the access\nto credit. It may be appropriate to instrument the credit access\nby these factors in an IV model. This limitation opens up a\nvenue for future study. Furthermore, our study focuses on\nperi-urban areas of HCMC, the biggest city. However, the\nhouseholds in big cities may be different from those in\nsmaller cities as well as in other regions of the country where\nsocioeconomic conditions are fairly diversified. As a result,\nour results may not be representative of the whole country.\nDescriptive Statistics and t Values for Equal Means by Borrowing Status.\nVariables\nBorrowers Non-borrowers\nt Value\nVariable for basic specification\nLocation\nAdditional variable for extended specification\nNote.
