In\nglioma, vascular endothelial growth factor\n(VEGF) is upregulated by irradiation and\npromotes the motility of the glioma cell\nin vitro,3 indicating that cytokines secreted\nby irradiated tumour cells play a role in\nradioresistance.\nStromal cell-derived factor 1a (SDF-1a)\nis the only known ligand for chemokine\n(C\u00adX\u00adC motif) receptor 4 (cxcr4). In glioma\ncells, the SDF-1a promoter is activated 24 h\nafter exposure to 8 Gy radiation,4 and cxcr4\nis a key determinant of glioma progression.5\nIrradiation induces tumour satellite forma-\ntion by enhancing the glioma tropism of\nhaematopoietic progenitor cells to the\ntumour bulk, an effect mediated by SDF-\n1a.4 The role of tumour cells in SDF-1a/\ncxcr4-mediated radiotherapy resistance is\nunclear, however.\nHypoxia stimulates CXCR4 production\nby the activation of hypoxia-inducible factor\n(HIF)-1a in glioma cells,6 and SDF-1a has\nbeen shown to be co-localized with HIF-1a\nin glioma cells that surround areas of necro-\nsis.6 The aim of the present study was to use\nmicro RNA (miRNA) knockdown targeting\nHIF-1a to investigate the role of SDF-1a/\ncxcr4 signalling in radiosensitivity, in a\nmurine malignant glioma cell line.\nMaterials and methods\nCell culture\nThe murine malignant glioma cell line\nor control miRNA) was provided by the\nBrain Science Research Institute of\nShandong University, Shandong, China.\nCells were cultured at 37C in a humidiEed\n5% carbon dioxide atmosphere in\nDulbecco's modified Eagle's medium\n(DMEM; GIBCO, Invitrogen, Carlsbad,\nCA, USA) containing 10% fetal bovine\nstreptomycin.\nIrradiation\nExponentially growing cells were irradiated\nat room temperature with an X-ray dose\nenergy of 6 MV at a dose rate of 3.0 Gy/min\nAlto, CA, USA). Irradiation was delivered\nsolid water (bolus), with a source-to-surface\ntein were analysed at 24 h and 48 h after\nirradiation, respectively. Experiments were\nperformed in triplicate.\nReal-time RT\u00adPCR\nwith TRIzol\u00d5 reagent (Invitrogen), follow-\ning the manufacturer's instructions. RNA\nwas treated with DNase and purified with\nthe RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden,\nGermany). Purified RNA was eluted in\n30 ml of RNA storage solution (Ambion,\nAustin, TX, USA) and stored at \u00ad80C.\nTotal RNA was quantified by UV spectros-\nJapan) and cDNA synthesis was conducted\nusing the high-capacity cDNA archive kit\n(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA,\nUSA) according to the manufacturer's\ninstructions.\nLevels of cxcr4 mRNA were analysed via\nquantitative real-time reverse transcription\u00ad\npolymerase chain reaction (qRT\u00adPCR)\nDetection System (Applied Biosystems).\nPrimers were: cxcr4, forward 50-\nAG-30; Gapdh (internal control), forward\nCTTG-30. Reactions were conducted in a\nSYBRGreen\u00d5 real-time PCR master mix\n[Roche, Mannheim, Germany] and 0.6 ml\nof each primer). Cycling conditions included\na prevention of carry-over contamination\n60C for 45 s. For analysis, a threshold was\nset for the change in fluorescence at a point\nin the linear PCR amplification phase. Melt\ncurve analysis was performed to ensure a\nsingle product species. All experiments were\nperformed in triplicate for both target gene\nand internal control, and were repeated\nthree times, independently.\nWestern blotting\nWhole-cell extracts were prepared using lysis\n1 mM EDTA [pH 8.0] and protease inhibitor\ncocktail tablets [Roche Applied Science,\nIndianapolis, IN, USA]). Total protein\npolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and\ntransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes\n(Amersham, Little Chalfont, UK). After\nblocking in 5% nonfat skim milk in TBST\nperature, membranes were incubated with\ndilution, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and\ndilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa\nCruz, CA, USA) overnight at 4C. After\nwashing three times with TBST, membranes\nwere incubated with horseradish peroxidase-\nconjugated antirabbit immunoglobulin G\nBiotechnologies) for 1 h at 37C, then\nwashed three times with TBST. Proteins\nwere visualized using an ECL Plus kit\n(Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) followed\nby chemiluminescent detection using a Fuji\nStamford, CT, USA) system.\nStatistical analyses\nData were expressed as mean \u00c6 SD and\nbetween-group comparisons were made\nusing unpaired two-tailed Student's t test.\nStatistical analyses were performed using\nSPSS\u00d5 version 12.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,\nUSA) for Windows\u00d5. P-values <0.05 were\nconsidered statistically significant.\nResults\nIn malignant glioma cell line GL261, levels\nof cxcr4 protein at 48 h after irradiation\nwere visibly increased in a radiation dose-\ndependent manner (Figure 1).\nData regarding cxcr4 mRNA levels in\ndown cells at 24 h after 5 Gy irradiation are\nshown in Figure 2. Irradiation of both cell\ntypes resulted in a significant increase in\ncxcr4 mRNA levels compared with nonirra-\ndiated cells (P < 0.05 for both comparisons).\nDiscussion\nFindings of the present study indicate that\nirradiation enhances the expression of cxcr4\nin murine glioma cells in vitro. It has been\nshown that irradiation enhances the invasive\npotential of glioma cells via activation of the\nRho signalling pathway,7 as well as enhan-\ncing VEGF and matrix metalloproteinase\n(MMP) -2 secretion.8,9 In addition, glioma\nFigure 1.

GAPDH, glyceraldehyde\n3-phosphate dehydrogenase (internal control).\ncell mobility was enhanced by\nadding irradiated-conditioned medium to\nnonirradiated cells.3 We hypothesize that\nthe enhanced invasive ability of irradiated\nglioma cells is mediated both directly via\nglioma cells themselves and indirectly via the\nincreased expression of various mediators.\nHypoxia-inducible factor IF-1a is a key\nfactor in hypoxia-induced CXCR4 produc-\ntion.5 The CXCR4 receptor was found to be\nco-localized with HIF-1a in glioma cells\nsurrounding areas of necrosis, suggesting a\ncorrelation with HIF-1a.6 Hypoxia pro-\nmotes expansion and inhibits the differenti-\nation of human glioma-derived cancer stem\ncells through activation of HIF-1a.10 The\npresent study focused on the role of HIF-1a\nin irradiation-induced cxcr4 production.\nSilencing of HIF-1a by RNA interference\nattenuates glioma cell growth in vivo.11\nLow-dose irradiation was found to activate\nendothelial cell migration directly via SDF-\nIrradiation-stimulated upregulation of\ncxcr4 in glioma cells was not inhibited by\nHIF-1a knockdown in the present study,\nsuggesting that HIF-1a is not the key medi-\nator of irradiation induced SDF-1a/CXCR4\nsignalling.\nOur present study found that irradiation\ninduced cxcr4 expression. The SDF-1a/\nCXCR4 and VEGF/VEGFR pathways syn-\nergistically induce tumour neoangiogenesis\nand metastasis,13 and interrupting this\nsynergistic axis would be a more efficient\nantiangiogenesis strategy than inhibiting\nVEGF alone. Preclinical studies have indi-\ncated that the therapeutic effect of\nFigure 2.

New targets for\ncontrolling the invasiveness of irradiation-\ntreated glioma cells are required, thereby\nfacilitating a new strategy in the fight against\nradioresistance.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis project was supported by the National\nNatural Science Foundation of China (grant\nexcellent young and middle-aged scientists of\nand the Independent Innovation Project of Jinan\nReferences\n1.
