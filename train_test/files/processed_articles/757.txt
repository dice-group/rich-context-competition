Mclaughlin, PhD2,3\nPopular and political discourse in the United\nStates sometimes conceptualizes poverty as a trap\nfrom which escape is difficult, if not impossible. Pol-\nicy prescriptions inevitably center on efforts to im-\nprove the employability and employment prospects\nof those at the bottom, and to reduce their barriers\nto work. But what of the elderly poor? Work as a\nmeans to exit poverty is unrealistic, if not impossi-\nble for many older Americans. Do elderly people\never really leave poverty? If they do, what triggers\nthese exits from poverty? And, are the increases in\nincome associated with elders' exits from poverty\nlarge enough to meaningfully improve their stan-\ndard of living?\nWe use the 1988 wave of the Panel Study of In-\ncome Dynamics (PSID) to answer these questions\nabout whether and how older people exit poverty.\nWe provide descriptive information on elders'\npoverty exits, document the income changes asso-\nciated with these exits, and estimate multivariate\ndiscrete-time hazard models of exits from poverty\nto identify factors associated with these poverty\nThis is a revised version of a paper originally presented at a joint session\nof the annual meetings of the Rural Sociological Society and the American\nSociological Association, August, 1995, Washington, DC.

In these comparisons, we focus on dif-\nferences in poverty exits between metropolitan\n(metro) and nonmetropolitan (nonmetro) elders.\nPrior research has shown that nonmetro elders ex-\nperience a higher prevalence of poverty than metro\nMcLaughlin & Jensen, 1993) and that they are more\nlikely to become poor in a given year than metro el-\nders (McLaughlin & Jensen, 1995). We suspect that\nnonmetro elders will also have lower rates of exit\nfrom poverty once they have become poor. In the\nsections that follow, we outline possible explana-\ntions for elders exiting poverty and extend these ex-\nplanations to suggest why nonmetro elders would\nhave less chance of exiting poverty.\nWhat Explains Older People's Exits From Poverty?\nA popular image holds that old age is a time of\neconomic vulnerability and an increasing risk of\nsliding into poverty. Empirical evidence supports\nthis view. Among those aged 65 or older, the preva-\nlence of poverty and the probability of making a\ntransition into poverty both increase substantially\nevents such as divorce, widowhood, retirement, un-\nemployment, and disability often are proximate de-\nterminants of economic decline (Burkhauser &\nDuncan, 1991). Underlying background factors that\ncondition poverty risks among elders are readily\nderivable from theory (Glasgow, Holden, McLaugh-\nlin, & Rowles, 1993). Stated simply, those who are\nwell endowed with human capital and who enjoyed\nfavorable employment circumstances throughout\ntheir prime working years (as well as elderly per-\nsons married to such individuals) will be better po-\nsitioned to maintain their economic status into their\nlater years than those less fortunate (Campbell &\nHowever, because elderly people, especially\nthose in their seventies, eighties, and beyond, often\ncannot rely on labor force participation as a strategy\nto boost income, and because they otherwise have\nrelatively fixed income sources, proximate events\nand underlying circumstances that would presage\nmovements out of poverty are harder to identify.\nNonetheless, empirical evidence suggests there is\nsignificant movement out of poverty among elders.\nThe Retirement History Survey (RHS) interviewed\nviewed them at two-year intervals over the follow-\ning decade. Analyzing these longitudinal data,\nHolden, Burkhauser, and Myers (1986) found that in\n88% of once-poor intact couples were no longer in\npoverty six years after the beginning of a poverty\nspell. A poverty spell is a period of one or more\nconsecutive years during which an elderly person is\nspells had ended after one year. Thereafter, exit\nprobabilities dropped substantially, to 23 and 22%\nfor those who had spent two and three years in\npoverty, respectively. Coe further documents that\nwhile these duration-specific exit probabilities were\nsimilar to those of the non-elderly population, exit\nprobabilities from longer poverty spells were much\nlower for the elders than the non-elders. Studies\nlooking exclusively at poor widows, a particularly\nvulnerable group, also suggest substantial move-\nment out of poverty. Bound, Duncan, Laren, and\nPSID and established that at least 35% of poverty\nspells that began after an elderly woman became\nwidowed had ended within five years. Using months\nas discrete-time intervals, Dodge (1995) found in an\nanalysis of data from the Survey of Income and Pro-\ngram Participation (SIPP) that of the 736 widows who\npoverty within 21 months.\nThe simple point is that not only do poor elders\nexit poverty, they do so with significant frequency.\nTheoretical reasons for poverty exits can be found in\nthe array of current and background determinants of\nelderly people's economic status generally. As noted\nabove, economic vulnerability increases substantially\nwith age, suggesting a negative effect of age on the\nlikelihood of making a transition out of poverty. The\nability to work, which is highly related to age, should\nincrease the probability of exiting poverty. Earnings\nare the primary income source for those old people\nwho work (McLaughlin & Jensen, 1993). Elders who\nare married may have less difficulty exiting poverty\nthan widows and other unmarried elders. Marriage\nmight allow more flexible income maintenance\nstrategies. Moreover, poor widows in these cohorts\nseldom have access to a pension based on their own\nwork effort and often lose access to a spouse's pen-\nsion once the spouse dies. These widows rely on rel-\natively fixed and sometimes insufficient Social Secu-\nrity benefits. Empirical evidence supports the lower\npoverty exit probabilities for elders who are older,\nnot working, and widowed (Dodge, 1995; Holden et\nBackground factors are clearly important in deter-\nmining which elders experience poverty, but they\nalso may condition the chances of poverty exit once\nthey become poor. Those who have had steady em-\nployment in reasonably well paying jobs, perhaps\nwith pension and health insurance coverage, will be\nbetter able than others to escape poverty. Such\nworkers and their spouses also would tend to have\nhigher Social Security benefits (Himes & McLaughlin,\n1994), which means that less supplemental income\nmay be necessary to bring them out of poverty. Con-\nversely, those with spotty employment histories in\njobs offering low wages, little opportunity for up-\nward mobility, and no pension coverage will be at\nhigher risk of poverty throughout life. As such, they\nwould be less likely to have built the financial base\nneeded to move out of poverty in old age.\nThe Implications of Residence for Poverty Exits\nWe are particularly interested in the effects of\nresidence in nonmetro areas on the dynamics of\npoverty in old age. As noted above, there is ample\nevidence that nonmetro elders have a higher\npoverty prevalence, and have a higher risk of falling\ninto poverty than their metro counterparts (Glas-\nadvantage also will be manifest in lower probabili-\nties of poverty exit among nonmetro elders. This\nresidential difference may rest partly in well known\ndisadvantages in the employment backgrounds of\nnonmetro elders. Nonmetro jobs are more likely to\nbe marginal and to offer subpoverty-level wages\n(Lichter, Johnston, & McLaughlin, 1994; Seninger &\nSmeeding, 1981); they are more prone to be sea-\nsonal and unstable (Lucas, 1971; Tomaskovic-Devey,\n1987); and they have lower returns to education\n(McLaughlin & Perman, 1991), lower skill require-\nments, and fewer opportunities for advancement\nworkers are less likely to be unionized or to be cov-\nered by a pension plan (Erickson, 1981). Again, while\nthese disadvantages may place nonmetro elders at\ngreater risk of falling into poverty, they also may\nconspire to produce circumstances that make it\nmore difficult for nonmetro elders to exit poverty.\nMethods\nWe analyze data from the Panel Study of Income\nDynamics (PSID) which, since 1968, has been con-\nducted annually by the Survey Research Center at\nthe University of Michigan. With its roots in the War\non Poverty, the PSID contains a wide range of vari-\nables describing the social, demographic, and eco-\nnomic circumstances of U.S. families, as well as ret-\nrospective data on the employment histories of\nfamily heads and their spouses. As such, the PSID is\nuniquely well suited to study the changing socio-\neconomic circumstances of families in general and\nthe dynamic nature of poverty among elderly peo-\nple in particular. The original sample of about 5,000\nfamilies contained a nationally representative sub-\nincome families. When sample weights are applied,\nthe PSID provides a nationally representative reflec-\ntion of the nonimmigrant U.S. population (Becketti,\nGould, Lillard, & Welch, 1988). We analyze both the\nresponse and nonresponse files of the 1988 wave of\nthe PSID. For those respondents who, because of\ndeath or for other reasons, attrited from the sample,\nthe nonresponse file contains their data records up\nto the year when they dropped out of the study\n(Hill, 1992). Given the higher mortality rates of el-\nders, using the nonresponse file of the PSID pro-\nvides a complete picture of the circumstances of\nthe elderly population, not just those who survived\nFrom these PSID files we selected household\nheads who were aged 55 or more at any time be-\nFirst, we analyze poverty spells to document\nmetro/nonmetro differences in the rate at which el-\nders exit poverty. Second, to determine whether el-\nders ever really leave poverty, we provide a detailed\nanalysis of changes in income that correspond with\ntransitions out of poverty. Finally,.to provide further\nelaboration on residential differences in poverty\nexits, we estimate discrete-time hazard models of\ntransitions out of poverty. Predictors in these mod-\nels include current socioeconomic and demo-\ngraphic characteristics of household heads, as well\nas measures of the employment history of heads.\nTo measure poverty, the official U.S. Census Bu-\nreau definition is closely followed. Families or indi-\nviduals are defined as poor if their annual cash in-\ncome is less than a threshold needed to provide for\nbasic needs. These thresholds are three times the\ncost of a minimally adequate diet as set forth by the\nU.S. Department of Agriculture's economy food\nplan (Orshansky, 1965), and are adjusted for family\nsize and number of children present. They also are\nslightly lower for one- and two-person families with\nelderly heads, under the assumption that elders re-\nquire less income to maintain a minimal existence.\nThe PSID treatment of the income-to-needs ratio\ndoes not permit an exact replication of the U.S.\nCensus Bureau poverty definition, but the adjusted\nPSID income-to-needs ratios used here are highly\ncomparable to the official Census Bureau ratios. In\nthe following analysis, a poverty exit occurs when\nan individual's family income-to-needs ratio goes\nfrom being less than one in the year(s) prior to a\ngiven PSID, to being one or greater during that year.\nResidence in metro or nonmetro counties is deter-\nmined by the 1970 designation of metro counties. In\ngeneral, metro areas comprise a central county with\n(a) at least one city of 50,000 residents, or (b) a total in\nalso include any satellite counties that are tied eco-\nnomically to the central county. The use of the 1970\ndefinition overstates the number of nonmetro elders\nin later waves of the PSID by defining as nonmetro\nelders residing in nonmetro counties that grew and\nbecame classified as metropolitan after 1970. Resi-\ndence status for individuals can change from year to\nyear. Other variables are described as they enter the\nanalysis.\nResults\nResidence Differences in Poverty Exits\nCompared to metro elders, nonmetro elderly\npeople have a higher poverty prevalence (Glasgow,\n1988) and a greater risk of falling into poverty over\ntime (McLaughlin & Jensen, 1995). Our first step in\nthis study was to establish whether nonmetro el-\nders are similarly disadvantaged when it comes to\nescaping from poverty. The PSID data were first re-\nconfigured into a person-year file in which poor\nhousehold heads contribute one year of data (and\none record in the person-year file) for each year\nthey were in poverty and thus potentially able to\nexit poverty.\nWith this person-year file as the basis of our analy-\nsis, Table 1 shows metro/nonmetro differences in\nrates of exit from poverty conditioned on the num-\nber of years that elders were poor. Of the 738 non-\nhad escaped poverty after that first year. The corre-\nsponding exit rate for metro elders was slightly\nhigher (.394). The exit rates drop off substantially\nwith the number of years spent in poverty, especially\nTable 1.

At the ex-\ntreme, the annual rate of transition out of poverty\namong those nonmetro elders who had been in\nIn all but two of the poverty duration categories,\nthe rate of exit from poverty is higher in metro than\nnonmetro areas. Also, in nonmetro areas the sum of\nall observed poverty exits (497) as a percentage of\nthe sum of all person-years (2,243) suggests that,\nwithout considering the number of years in poverty,\n22.2% of poor nonmetro elders exit poverty in a\ngiven year. This compares to 25.4% among their\nmetro counterparts. In short, as expected, non-\nmetro elders appear to have a more difficult time\nexiting poverty once they become poor. To provide\ngraphic support of this finding, Figure 1 shows\nKaplan-Meier curves for survival in poverty. These\ncurves reflect the probability that an elder remains\nin poverty until time \"t,\" where t is the time in years\nsince the observed start of a poverty spell. The fig-\nYear of poverty spell\n, Metro , Nonmetro\nFigure 1. Probability of surviving in a poverty spell.\nure offers further evidence of a small but nonethe-\nless discernable disadvantage for nonmetro elders.\nFor example, while over 80% of metro elders escape\npoverty after six years in a poverty spell, only about\n75% of nonmetro elders are as fortunate.\nIncome Changes With Poverty Exits\nTable 1 and Figure 1 confirm that poor elders ap-\nparently move out of poverty with considerable fre-\nquency. Again, while this may be at odds with popu-\nlar perceptions of the nature of elderly poverty, it is\nentirely consistent with other studies (e.g., Coe,\n1988). However, the mere frequency of poverty exits\nsays nothing about how substantively meaningful\nthese exits are. After all, even a one dollar increase\nin annual income can, by definition, be enough to\nproduce a transition out of poverty.\nTable 2 sheds light on this question by showing\nmean annual income changes, in 1987 dollars, for\nthose person-years in which a transition out of\npoverty occurred. Broken down by years in poverty,\nand by metro/nonmetro residence, the table shows\nthe mean and median changes in total household in-\ncome; the mean change in income from pensions,\nearnings, interest and dividends, and social security;\nand the average absolute change in the income-to-\nneeds ratio. Transitions out of poverty in the first\nyear were brought about by a mean total household\nincome increase of $3,970. The distribution of these\nincreases is skewed to the right due to a minority\nof person-years in which tremendous income in-\ncreases were posted, so the median increases are\nuniformly less, for example, $2,520 for those exiting\npoverty after one year. To place this increase in per-\nspective, the poverty threshold for an elderly couple\npoor elderly couples had an income only one dollar\nbelow their poverty threshold, then giving them the\nmedian income increase of $2,520 would bring their\nold -- still \"near poor\" by most definitions.\nLooking across income types, poverty exits after\nonly one or two years in poverty are driven to a\nTable 2.

This pattern likely reflects the strategy\nwhereby elders liquidate assets to boost their in-\ncome, a scenario which is consistent with the sud-\nden drop in the annual increase from interest and\ndividend income for those who have been in\npoverty more than two years. The mean increase in\ntotal household income among those exiting\npoverty generally decreases as years-in-poverty in-\ncrease, as does the mean absolute change in the in-\ncome-to-needs ratio. Both patterns are consistent\nwith the prospect that those in poverty longer are\napt to be worse off, and thus less likely to rise much\nabove the poverty line when they do exit poverty.\nWhen broken down by residence, the data offer a\nconflicting picture as to whether the movements\nout of poverty are more substantial among metro\nelders, as theory might predict. The mean increase\nin total household income and in the income-to-\nneeds ratio suggests greater absolute improvement\nfor those nonmetro person-years in which an exit\noccurred. Conversely, the median increase in total\nhousehold income favors metro person-years. In\nsum, the data yield no clear picture of residential\ndifferences in the absolute economic improvement\nthat comes with an exit from poverty. Nonetheless,\nthe rather modest absolute increases in total house-\nhold income, and in the income-to-needs ratio, sug-\ngest that elders who exit poverty tend not to rise\nmuch above the poverty threshold.\nMultivariate Models of Poverty Exits\nTo provide insight into the determinants of pov-\nerty exits and into the lower likelihood of poverty\nexit among nonmetro elders, we use logistic regres-\nsion to estimate nested discrete-time event history\nmodels of transitions out of poverty. Model I in\nTable 3 is a base model that includes only nonmetro\nresidence and years in poverty (the coefficients for\nthe latter are not shown). The effect of living in a\nnonmetro area in the base model is negative, sug-\ngesting a lower probability of exiting poverty com-\npared with those living in metro areas, but it is not\nstatistically significant (p = .157).\nModel II adds selected sociodemographic and\nwork history characteristics of the family head. A\nnumber of the coefficients are as expected. Black\nhousehold heads and female heads are less likely to\nescape poverty, as are those who are never married\n(compared to those who are married), while those\nwith at least some college education are more likely\nto escape poverty. Except for the fact that heads\nwho had craft or operative occupations were more\nlikely to exit poverty, occupation has little effect.\nHeads of household with more full-time years of\nwork experience, and families in which the head\nand spouse (if present) worked more total hours in\nthe current year, were more likely to exit poverty.\nCompared to the base model, the effect of non-\nmetro residence remains negative but becomes sta-\ntistically significant in model II. This apparent sup-\npression effect is somewhat at odds with the fact\nthat nonmetro heads are c//sadvantaged with re-\nspect to some of the variables that are significant in\nmodel II. That is, nonmetro heads are more likely to\nbe never married and less likely to have some col-\nlege or more, which should depress their prospects\nfor poverty exit. (Controlling for these variables\nshould make the nonmetro effect less negative, not\nmore negative.) It is the case the nonmetro elders\nare less likely to be black and more likely to be mar-\nried, which could be contributing to the suppres-\nsion of the negative effect of nonmetro residence.\nTable 3.

In other words, if\nnonmetro heads had the same (low number of)\nyears of work experience and current labor supply\nas metro heads, their prospects for exiting poverty\nwould be even more dim.\nModel III adds a set of dummy variables indicat-\ning that various income types were received in the\ncurrent year. Poor elders who receive pension in-\ncome and interest and dividend income are more\nlikely to exit from poverty than those without any\nincome from these sources. Conversely, receipt of\nSupplemental Security Income (SSI) depresses the\nlikelihood of exiting poverty. The latter finding may\nseem ironic, when considering SSI targets low-in-\ncome elders, but is perfectly sensible in view of the\nfact that only the very poor tend to qualify, and ben-\nefit levels are relatively meager. When adding these\nvariables, the effect of nonmetro residence remains\nnegative and significant. Nonmetro, poor elders are\nless likely to exit poverty than metro elders who are\notherwise comparable.\nSummary and Discussion\nThe need for an analysis of elderly poverty may\nseem questionable when viewed against national-\nlevel trends showing declining poverty and improv-\ning economic well-being among older people over\nrecent decades. But this aggregate improvement\nmay mask both the transitory nature of elders' pov-\nerty and the economic vulnerability of certain de-\nmographic slices of the elderly population. Our\nanalysis of twenty years of longitudinal data from\nthe Panel Study of Income Dynamics corroborates a\nlimited number of other studies in showing consid-\nerable movement out of poverty among poor el-\nders. Close to 40% leave poverty after one year.\nHowever, the often modest increases in total annual\nincome and income-to-needs ratios suggests that\nmany of these exits may be the result of elders mov-\ning trivially above the poverty line.\nFrom a policy perspective, the fact that many el-\nderly people enter and exit poverty from year to\nyear is less important than whether there are sys-\ntematic differences between those at risk and those\nnot, and whether these differences are amenable to\npolicy intervention. Our multivariate analyses sug-\ngest that many of the factors that prevent poor el-\nders from exiting poverty -- such as being black,\nnever being married, or being less well educated --\nare predetermined in old age, and outside the con-\ntrol of policy makers. Indeed, their effect would\nseem to be the result of a cumulative stratification\nprocess that, over the life course, places people at\nhigher risk of poverty once they become old, or\nbetter able to exit poverty should they become\npoor (Crystal & Shea, 1990). Policy initiatives to help\nlevel the playing field and improve the lifelong em-\nployment prospects of younger people may help fu-\nture elderly cohorts, but will do little to ameliorate\nthe plight of today's poor elders.\nA couple of the determinants of the exits from\npoverty are more proximate and worthy of policy\nmakers' concern. First, those with greater labor sup-\nply were significantly more likely to exit poverty.\nEven among elders, then, work represents a way\nout. Policies to improve the supply of and demand\nfor the labor of able-bodied poor elderly people\ncan help them escape poverty. Second, for some,\nSupplemental Security Income (SSI) is one of the\nfew options for financial support. That those who\nreceive SSI are actually less likely to escape poverty,\nother things equal, suggests that this program is\nsimply inadequate to ameliorate elderly poverty. As\nindividual states wrestle with new policies and pro-\ngrams in the current era of block grants, policy mak-\ners need to recognize the special plight of poor el-\nders and the inadequate benefit levels of prevailing\nprograms.\nThis paper also was motivated by the particularly\nacute circumstances faced by many of today's rural\nelders. On many indicators, nonmetro residents\nsuffer greater economic hardship in old age than\ntheir metro counterparts. We were interested to see\nwhether that disadvantage also means they have a\nharder time exiting poverty. Our results consis-\ntently pointed toward a lower likelihood of poverty\nexit among nonmetro than metro elders. The mul-\ntivariate event history analysis verified the rural\ndisadvantage in poverty exits but offered limited ex-\nplanations for it. Indeed, when several sociodemo-\ngraphic and employment history characteristics of\nhousehold heads were included in the models, the\nnegative nonmetro effect became stronger and\nmore significant. This suppression effect reflects\nthe fact that nonmetro poor elders are more likely\nthan their metro counterparts to have a number of\ncharacteristics, such as being married, being white,\nand having more years of full-time work experience,\nthat make it easier to escape poverty. A challenge\nfor the future will be for researchers to provide firm\nexplanations for this rural disadvantage. Some in-\nsight in this regard might be gained by using alter-\nnative definitions of rural and urban. For example,\nthe broad metro/nonmetro distinction we employ\nhere uses counties as building blocks, and there-\nfore ignores the significant heterogeneity in rurality\nthat can exist within counties. To the extent that el-\nders follow national patterns by showing greater\nlevels of economic deprivation among those in\nsmall towns or the open country and far from large\nmetropolitan areas, an analysis of their circum-\nstances might uncover important clues to the rural\ndisadvantage in general.\nReferences\nBecketti, S., Could, W., Lillard, L, & Welch, F.
