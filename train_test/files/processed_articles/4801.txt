    "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nOPCs (oligodendrocyte precursor cells) express golli\nproteins which, through regulation of Ca2+ influx, appear\nto be important in OPC process extension/retraction and\nmigration. The aim of the present study was to examine\nfurther the role of golli in regulating OPC development. The\neffects of golli ablation and overexpression were examined\nin primary cultures of OPCs prepared from golli-KO\n(knockout) and JOE (golli J37-overexpressing) mice. In\nOPCs lacking golli, or overexpressing golli, differentiation\ninduced by growth factor withdrawal was impaired.\nProliferation analysis in the presence of PDGF (platelet-\nderived growth factor), revealed that golli enhanced the\nmitogen-stimulated proliferation of OPCs through activa-\ntion of SOCCs (store-operated Ca2+ channels). PDGF\ntreatment induced a biphasic increase in OPC intracellular\nCa2+, and golli specifically increased Ca2+ influx during the\nsecond SOCC-dependent phase that followed the initial\nrelease of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. This store-\noperated Ca2+ uptake appeared to be essential for cell\ndivision, since specific SOCC antagonists completely\nblocked the effects of PDGF and golli on OPC proliferation.\nAdditionally, in OPCs overexpressing golli, increased cell\ndeath was observed after mitogen withdrawal. This\nphenomenon could be prevented by exposure to VOCC\n(voltage-operated Ca2+ channel) blockers, indicating that\nthe effect of golli on cell death involved increased Ca2+\ninflux through VOCCs. The results showed a clear effect of\ngolli on OPC development and support a role for golli in\nmodulating multiple Ca2+-regulatory events through\nVOCCs and SOCCs. Our results also suggest that PDGF\nengagement of its receptor resulting in OPC proliferation\nproceeds through activation of SOCCs.\n",

These studies suggested a dual role of golli proteins in\nregulating activation of some immune cells as well as the\nearly stages of OPC migration and proliferation.\nCa2+ ions are regulators of numerous cellular processes,\nincluding survival, motility, apoptosis and differentiation\n(Berridge et al., 1998), and a growing amount of evidence\nsuggests a critical role for Ca2+ in controlling proliferative\nconstituents of myelin, but they appear to play a basic role in\nthe regulation of Ca2+ homoeostasis in immune cells and in\ndepolarization by high potassium (K+) activates VOCCs\n(voltage-operated Ca2+ channels), while depletion of intracel-\nlular Ca2+ stores triggers Ca2+ influx via SOCCs (store-operated\nCa2+ channels). Recent work has shown that changes in golli\nexpression alter the magnitude of voltage-sensitive Ca2+\ncurrents as well as SOCCs in OPCs, a finding that has\npotentially important consequences on multiple aspects of\nGolli proteins can modulate Ca2+ levels during a critical\nphase of oligodendrocyte development through an action on\nrates of cell migration and process extension and retraction,\npresumably post-mitotic events (Paez et al., 2007). We\nwondered whether golli could also influence earlier events\nin OPC biology, such as proliferation, through modulation of\nCa2+ influx. In the present study, we explored the relationship\nbetween golli, Ca2+ influx and OPC proliferation and survival.\nWe observed that the overexpression of golli promotes OPC\nproliferation through activation of SOCCs, but at the same\ntime golli increased apoptotic cell death mediated by Ca2+\ninflux through VOCCs. Interestingly, we found that golli were\nable to modulate the mitogenic effects of PDGF (platelet-\nderived growth factor), thus providing new insights into the\nrole of golli in the regulation of OPC development.\nAnimal experimentation\nAnimals were maintained by qualified staff in the UCLA\nVivarium. The use of these animals was governed by the\n`Principles for Use of Animals' and `Guide for the Care and Use\nof Laboratory Animals' from the Office for Protection from\nResearch Risks of the National Institutes of Health.\nTransgenic mice\nGolli-KO (knockout) mouse\nWe previously generated a golli-KO mouse in which the golli\nproducts of the Mbp gene were selectively ablated while\npermitting normal expression of the classic MBPs (Jacobs et\nal., 2005). Through non-brother\u00adsister crosses, a line was\ngenerated that is homozygous for the golli ablation on a\ncontrol line (KO control) was established that was also 50%\ngolli ablation. The golli-KO phenotype was observed before\nkeeping the lines separate and then was studied over at least\neight generations and remained stable.\nJOE (golli J37-overexpressing) mouse\nWe generated a transgenic mouse that overexpresses the golli\nJ37 isoform in oligodendrocytes under the control of a classic\nMbp promoter (Martin et al., 2007). In this transgenic mouse,\nthe J37 golli isoform is driven by a 1.9-kb region of the classic\nMbp promoter, thus directing overexpression of the protein\nspecifically to oligodendrocytes in the CNS (central nervous\nsystem) (Reyes et al., 2003). These mice are called JOE mice\nfor golli J37-overexpressing. A line was generated that is\nheterozygous for the MBP 1.9-J37 transgene on a back-\nC3H/He. A control line (JOE control) was established that was\nPrimary cultures of cortical oligodendrocytes\nEnriched oligodendrocytes were prepared as described by\nAmur-Umarjee et al. (1993). First, cerebral hemispheres from\n1-day-old mice were mechanically dissociated and were\nplated on poly-D-lysine-coated flasks in DMEM (Dulbecco's\nmodified Eagle's medium) and Ham's F12 (1:1, v/v) (Invitrogen\nLife Technologies), containing 100 mg/ml gentamycin and\nsupplemented with 4 mg/ml dextrose anhydrous, 3.75 mg/ml\nHepes buffer, 2.4 mg/ml sodium bicarbonate and 10% (v/v)\nFBS (fetal bovine serum) (Omega Scientific). After 24 h, the\nmedium was changed, and the cells were grown in DMEM/\nHam's F12 supplemented with 5 mg/ml insulin, 50 mg/ml\nhuman transferrin, 30 nM sodium selenite, 10 mM D-biotin,\n0.1% BSA (Sigma\u00adAldrich), 1% (v/v) horse serum and 1% (v/v)\nFBS. After 9 days, OPCs were purified from the mixed glial\nculture by the differential shaking and adhesion procedure of\nSuzumura et al. (1984) and were allowed to grow on poly-D-\nlysine-coated coverslips in defined culture medium (Agresti et\nfibroblast growth factor) (Peprotech). OPCs were kept in\nmitogens (PDGF and bFGF) for 2 days and then induced to\nexit from the cell cycle and differentiate by switching the\nis DMEM/Ham's F12 supplemented with 4.5 g/l D-glucose, 5\nmg/ml insulin, 50 mg/ml human transferrin, 30 nM sodium\n(tri-iodothyronine), 10 mM D-biotin, 10 nM\nhydrocortisone, 0.1% BSA, 1% (v/v) horse serum and 1% (v/v)\nPM Paez and others\n26 E 2009 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/)\nwhich permits unrestricted non-commerical use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nImmunocytochemistry\nCells were stained with antibodies against NG2 (nerve/glial\nantigen 2), O4 antigen, GC (galactocerebroside), MBP and\nphospho-histone H3 (Ser10) and examined by confocal\nmicroscopy. For MBP and phospho-histone H3 (Ser10)\nimmunostaining, the cells were rinsed briefly in PBS and\nfixed in 4% (w/v) buffered paraformaldehyde (pH 7.6) for 30\nmin at room temperature (20\u00b0C). After rinsing in PBS, the\nmin at room temperature and then processed for immuno-\ncytochemistry following the protocol as outlined by Reyes\nand Campagnoni (2002). Essentially, fixed cells were incu-\nbated in a blocking solution (5% goat serum in PBS) followed\nby an overnight incubation at 4\u00b0C with a polyclonal antibody\nUpstate Biotechnology). Staining with anti-NG2 (1:100;\nChemicon International), anti-(O4 antigen) (1:20) and anti-\nGC (1:20) was performed on live cells without permeabiliza-\ntion for 1 h at room temperature before fixation. Cells were\nthen incubated with the appropriate secondary antibodies\n(1:200; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), mounted on\nto slides with Aquamount (Lerner Laboratories), and fluor-\nescent images were obtained using a Olympus spinning-disc\nconfocal microscope. Nuclei were stained with the fluor-\ndetermine the total number of cells. Quantitative analysis of\nthe results was carried out by counting the antigen-positive\nfields, which resulted in counts of .2000 cells for each\nexperimental condition. Counts of antigen-positive cells were\nnormalized to the counts of total Hoechst 33342-positive\ncells for each condition.\nCell morphology assessment\nProcess formation of oligodendrocytes was evaluated by\nestimating the percentage of O4-positive cells having\nprocesses with a length which was equal to or longer than\nfour times the cell body diameter. This method has been used\npreviously for monitoring morphological changes in oligo-\ndendrocytes as well as other cell types (Yong et al., 1988,\n1991). To obtain the percentage of cells with long processes,\nfields were randomly chosen on oligodendrocyte-bearing\ncoverslips and all of the O4-positive cells were determined\n(,500 cells for each experimental condition), as well as the\nnumber of oligodendrocytes having processes four times the\nIncorporation of BrdU (bromodeoxyuridine)\nPulses of 10 mM BrdU (BD Pharmingen) were applied for 24 h\nand immunostained in order to determine the number of\npositive cells. The cells were fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformalde-\nhyde in PBS. After treatment with 6 M HCl and 1% (v/v)\nTriton X-100 to denature nuclear DNA, the cells were\nincubated in 0.1 M sodium borate (in PBS and 1% Triton X-\n100) for 10 min. Immunocytochemistry was carried out using\nan anti-BrdU antibody (1:1000; BD Pharmingen) and an anti-\nNG2 antibody (1:100; Chemicon International) with the\ncorresponding fluorescent secondary antibodies. The percent-\nage of BrdU-positive cells was estimated on the basis of the\ntotal number of NG2-positive cells.\nTc\n(cell-cycle time) analysis\nTo examine Tc\n, mixed glial culture of GFP (green fluorescent\nprotein)-labelled OPCs were used. These experiments were\nperformed using a double-transgenic mouse created by\nbreeding the golli-KO and JOE mice with a line expressing\nGFP under the control of the Plp (proteolipid protein)\npromoter (Mallon et al., 2002). Mixed glial cultures were\nprepared as described above (in the Primary cultures of\ncortical oligodendrocytes section). These cultures were\nincubated in a stage-top chamber with 5% CO2\nwhich was placed on the stage of a spinning-disc inverted\nconfocal microscope equipped with a motorized stage, an\natmosphere regulator and shutter control. Fluorescent field\nimages were obtained with a specific GFP filter at 6 min\nintervals. Individual clones of GFP-labelled OPCs (OPC,GFPs)\nwere monitored for a period of 48 h beginning at 2, 4 and 6\nDIV (days in vitro) before the shake-off. In these time-lapse\nexperiments, ,30 clones were analysed per experimental\ncondition.\nSlideBookTM 4.1 (Intelligent Imaging Innovations) was used\nin the analysis of videomicroscopic image sequences. The\nSlideBookTM software allows an investigator to cycle back and\nforth through the movie files frame-by-frame (minute-by-\nminute), facilitating the accurate determination of event\ntime. To quantitatively analyse the dynamics of cell division,\n120 cytokinetic events were randomly selected from movies\nat 2, 4 and 6 DIV. Cell proliferation was assessed by\ncalculating the average Tc\n(time between birth cytokinesis\nand division cytokinesis) in different OPC,GFP clones.\nTracking of cells was performed by visual observation of\nimage sequences as described above. In some cases, the cells\nwere semi-automatically followed in SlideBookTM by attach-\ning a number to the cell, which was propagated from frame\nto frame. Tracking was performed forwards and backwards in\ntime from each cytokinesis event identified to maximize the\nnumber of linearly related cytokineses identified.\nCell viability analysis\nA Trypan Blue exclusion assay was used to determine cell\nviability. Following different experimental treatments, OPCs\ngrown on coverslips for 1, 2, 3 and 4 DIV were incubated in\nmedium containing Trypan Blue (0.04% final concentration)\nfor 10 min at 37\u00b0C. Viable cells were counted in a total of six\nexperiments, four random fields, on triplicate coverslips.\nGolli enhances OPC proliferation and cell death\nE 2009 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/)\nwhich permits unrestricted non-commerical use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\ndiphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide] assay\nThe MTT survival assay was performed as described by\nMosmann (1983). The sterile solution of MTT (Molecular\nProbes) was added to all wells, and the microplate was\nincubated at 37\u00b0C for 45 min. The reaction was stopped by\naddition of SDS, and the product was quantified by\nCaspase 3 assay\nNucViewTM 488 caspase 3 substrate (Biotium), a novel cell\nmembrane-permeable fluorigenic caspase substrate designed\nfor detecting caspase 3 activity within live cells in real time,\nwas used in accordance with the manufacturer's recommen-\ndations. Briefly, OPC primary cultures were incubated in\nmedium containing NucViewTM 488 caspase 3 substrate (5 mM\nfinal concentration) in a stage-top chamber with 5% CO2\nat\n37\u00b0C, which was placed on the stage of a spinning-disc\ninverted confocal microscope. Fluorescent field images were\nobtained with a specific GFP filter at 6 min intervals for a\ntotal of 12 h. SlideBookTM 4.1 software was used to assess\napoptotic cell death by calculating the percentage of caspase\n3-positive cells in a total of five experiments on four random\nfields.\nCalcium imaging\nMethods were similar to those described previously (Colwell,\ncooled CCD (charge-coupled device) camera (Hamamatsu\nORCA-ER) was added to the Olympus spinning-disc confocal\nmicroscope to measure fluorescence. To load the dye into\ncells, the coverslips were washed in serum and Phenol Red-\nfree DMEM, and the cells were incubated for 45 min at 37\u00b0C\nin the same medium containing a final\nconcentration of 4 mM fura 2/AM (fura 2 acetoxymethyl\nProbes), then washed four times in DMEM and stored in\nDMEM for up to 1 h before being imaged (Paz Solda\n\u00b4n et al.,\n2003). Measurements of resting Ca2+ levels were made in\nserum-free HBSS (Hanks balanced salt solution) containing 2\nmM Ca2+, but no Mg2+. Other measurements were made in\nHBSS. Ca2+ influx and resting Ca2+ levels were measured on\nindividual cells, and the results were pooled from five\nseparate coverslips representing five separate cells prepara-\ntions for each condition. The fluorescence of fura 2 was\nmeans of a high-speed wavelength-switching device (Lambda\nDG-4; Sutter Instruments). SlideBookTM software was then\nused to select several `regions of interest' within the field\nfrom which measurements were taken. To minimize bleach-\ning, the intensity of excitation light and sampling frequency\nwas kept as low as possible. In these experiments, measure-\nments were normally made once every 2 s.\nCalibration of Ca2+ signals\nFree [Ca2+] was estimated from the ratio (R) of fluorescence\n)/(Rmax\n2R) (Grynkiewicz\nwas assumed to be 140 nM, whereas\nvalues for Rmin\nand Rmax\nwere all determined via calibration\nmethods. An in vitro method (fura 2 Ca2+ imaging calibration\nkit, Molecular Probes) was used to make estimated values.\nUsing this method, glass coverslips were filled with a high-\nEGTA) or a control solution without fura 2. Each solution also\ncontained a dilute suspension of 15 mm polystyrene micro-\nspheres to ensure uniform coverslip/slide separation and\nfacilitate microscope focusing. The fluorescence (F ) at 380\nnm excitation of the low-Ca2+ solution was imaged, and the\nexposure of the camera was adjusted to maximize the signal.\nThese camera settings were then fixed, and measurements\nsolutions.

Measurements of the percentage of\npositive cells (NG2, O4, GC, MBP, phospho-histone H3, BrdU,\nTrypan Blue and caspase 3) were carried out using Student's\npaired t test, in which P,0.05 was defined as statistically\nsignificant.\nRESULTS\nGolli stimulates OPC proliferation in the\npresence of mitogens\nImmediately after shake-off from mixed glial cultures, OPCs\nwere grown in the presence of PDGF-AA (10 ng/ml) and bFGF\n(10 ng/ml) for 48 h and then induced to exit the cell cycle and\nto differentiate by transferring the cells to a mitogen-free\nmedium (mN2) (Figure 1A) (Oh et al., 2003). To determine the\neffect of golli on OPC proliferation, we calculated the\npercentage of proliferating cells each day over a period of 4\nDIV. Since actively proliferating cells duplicate their DNA\ncontent, we labelled proliferating OPCs from golli-KO and JOE\nmice with the thymidine analogue BrdU. Pulses of 10 mM\nBrdU for 24 h were given at 0 h (immediately after shake-\nproliferating progenitors were identified by double immuno-\nfluorescence for BrdU and NG2, and the relative number of\nNG2-positive/BrdU-positive cells was quantified in each cell\nPM Paez and others\n28 E 2009 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/)\nwhich permits unrestricted non-commerical use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\npopulation (Figure 1B). In all cell populations, proliferation\ndeclined after transfer to mitogen-free medium at 3 and 4\nDIV, as expected, but during the proliferative period, cell\nproliferation was lower in the golli-KO populations and\nhigher in the JOE populations than in controls (Figure 1C). For\nexample, after 1 DIV, the average number of proliferating\ncells in the golli-KO population (27%) was significantly lower\nthan that of the genotype control group (41%, P,0.01)\n(Figure 1C). In similar experiments, the average percentage of\nproliferating OPCs in JOE cells was almost 30% higher than of\nthe genotype control cells (52 and 37% respectively,\nP,0.001) (Figure 1C). Golli overexpression did not interfere\nwith the ability of OPCs to exit the cell cycle after mitogen\ndeprivation, since, in JOE cultures, less than 10% of the cells\nincorporated BrdU at 4 DIV (Figure 1C). Neither did the\nabsence of golli modify the response of progenitor cells to\nmitogen withdrawal, since the percentage of NG2-positive/\nBrdU-positive cells was also quite low, ranging from 10 to\nAdditionally, we evaluated the total number of NG2-positive\ncells in golli-overexpressing cultures at 1 and 2 DIV.

The phosphorylation of\nhistone H3 at Ser28 occurs in chromosomes predominantly\nduring early mitosis and coincides with the initiation of\nmitotic chromosome condensation in various mammalian cell\nlines (Goto et al., 1999). After 1 and 2 DIV in the presence of\nmitogens, there were more H3-positive cells in the JOE cell\npopulation than in the JOE control cells (Figure 2), but 24 h\nafter mitogen withdrawal (3 DIV), no significant differences\nbetween groups were found (Figure 2B).\nAn increase in JOE OPC divisions and a decrease in golli-KO\ncell proliferation could be due to a change in cell-cycle\nkinetics. To explore this possibility, we measured the Tc\nof the\ngolli-KO, JOE and control cells by performing time-lapse\nimaging in mixed glial cultures using OPC,GFPs. The OPCs\nused in these experiments were obtained from double-\ntransgenic mice created by breeding the golli-KO and JOE\nmice with a line expressing GFP under the control of the Plp\npromoter (Mallon et al., 2002). In these mice, GFP expression\nprovides a convenient marker for OPCs in the imaging\nexperiments in mixed glial cultures. We imaged individual\nclones of OPC,GFPs in the presence of an astrocyte\nmonolayer, a known source of growth factors such as\nPDGF, bFGF and IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor 1) (Hicks\nand Franklin, 1999). These experiments were performed for a\nperiod of 48 h, beginning at 2, 4 and 6 DIV before the shake-\noff (Figure 3A). We denote days in vitro in experiments in the\nmixed cultures with the lower-case div. In these time-lapse\nexperiments, cell proliferation was assessed by calculating the\naverage Tc\nin different OPC,GFP clones. Tc\nwas defined as the\nperiod between when a cell was first generated by cytokinesis\nand when that cell subsequently divided, giving birth to two\ndaughter cells. The time at which cytokinesis occurred was\nconsidered to be the first appearance of a distinct border\nbetween two daughter cells in videomicroscopic image\nsequence (see the Materials and methods section). Examples\nof cytokinetic events in OPC,GFPs from golli-KO and JOE\nmice grown for 4 days on an astrocyte monolayer (4 div) are\nshown in Figure 3(B). At 2 div, control OPCs showed a Tc\nof\n,24 h, whereas the golli-KO cells showed a Tc\ncontrast, the Tc\nof JOE OPCs was decreased to ,18 h at 2 div\nThese results indicated by several independent measures\nthat golli promoted OPC proliferation in the presence of\ngrowth factors, i.e. an increase in the number of BrdU-\npositive cells, a decrease in the Tc\nand an increase in the\nnumber of cells in S-phase. This effect disappeared when\nPDGF and bFGF were removed from the culture medium,\nsuggesting that golli does not influence the ability of OPCs to\nexit from the cell cycle in response to mitogen deprivation.\nAfter mitogen withdrawal, cells overexpressing\ngolli are more sensitive to cell death\nThe effect of golli expression on OPC survival was examined\nusing the Trypan Blue exclusion assay and the MTT\nquantitative colorimetric method for cell viability. The results\nrevealed statistically significant differences in the percentage\nof Trypan Blue-positive (dead) cells between control and JOE\nOPCs. At both 3 and 4 DIV, JOE cultures showed a significant\nincrease in the number of Trypan Blue-positive cells\n(Figure 4A). Similar results were found using the MTT assay\nFigure 2 Effects of golli on histone H3 phosphorylation\nOPCs from JOE mouse were cultured as indicated in Figure 1(A).

Examples of\nsuch measurements are shown in Figure 5(A). Consistent with\nthe MTT and Trypan Blue results, the combined use of real-\ntime confocal microscopy and the caspase 3 indicator\nrevealed that JOE OPCs at 3 DIV displayed a significant\nincrease in the percentage of caspase 3-positive cells after 12\nh (Figure 5B). Parallel experiments with golli-KO compared\nwith control OPCs showed no increase in caspase labelling\n(Figure 5B).\nGolli expression plays a role in OPC\ndifferentiation\nThere is an obligate relationship between proliferation and\ndifferentiation, because cell-cycle exit is a prerequisite for\noligodendrocyte differentiation (Casaccia-Bonnefil and Liu,\n2003). The results described above clearly indicate that\nendogenous golli expression modulates OPC proliferation and\nsurvival. Since these two events are essential for OPC lineage\nprogression, we investigated further the effect of golli on\nOPC differentiation. Primary cultures of OPCs were kept in\nmitogens (PDGF and bFGF) for 2 DIV and then induced to exit\nthe cell cycle by switching the cells to a mitogen-free\nmedium (mN2). Under these conditions, there is a general\ndecline in early immunocytochemical markers, such as NG2,\nand an increase in intermediate (e.g. O4) and mature (e.g. GC,\nMBP) markers consistent with differentiation of the OPCs\n(Figure 6). Analysis of these markers showed that, in cells\nlacking golli, the number of cells positive for the most mature\noligodendrocyte markers, GC and MBP, was significantly\nlower than in their corresponding genotype controls\n(Figures 6C and 6D). OPCs from both control and golli-KO\nmice progressively acquired O4, GC and MBP immunoreacti-\nvity, but the percentage of golli-KO cells positive for these\nantigens was always lower than that found in control cells.\nAfter removal of growth factors (3 and 4 DIV), the number of\ncells positive for O4, GC and MBP increased by approx. 50% in\ncontrol cultures, whereas in the golli-KO OPCs, there was still\nno significant change in the number of GC-positive or MBP-\npositive cells over this period, suggesting a lag in the\ndifferentiation of OPCs in the absence of golli after mitogen\nwithdrawal. Consistent with this, we observed a significantly\ngreater decrease in the percentage of immature NG2-positive\ncells in control compared with golli-KO OPCs (Figure 6A). As\nshown in Figure 7, similar results were obtained in JOE OPCs.\nAfter 1 DIV, the number of cells expressing the intermediate\nmarker O4 increased significantly, and there was a steady\ndecline in the number of cells expressing the immature\nmarker NG2 in the control and JOE cells populations\n(Figures 7A and 7B). However, after removing the growth\nfactors from the culture medium, the increase in the number\nof O4-, GC- and MBP-positive cells was only seen in control\ncells (Figures 7B, 7C and 7D). These results suggested that\ndifferentiation of OPCs was sensitive to the levels of golli\nexpressed in the cells.\nAs expected, in all genotypes, the cells were mostly bipolar\nduring the first 2 DIV in the presence of PDGF and bFGF.\nHowever, removal of growth factors increased the morpho-\nlogical differentiation of the cells towards a more complex\ncell shape similar to that observed in post-mitotic more\nmature oligodendrocytes. As described by Jacobs et al. (2005),\nanalysis of the morphological complexity of oligodendrocytes\n(Sperber and McMorris, 2001) showed that, although the\ngolli-KO oligodendrocytes elaborated processes and mem-\nbrane sheets, these were not as extensive as those elaborated\nby control oligodendrocytes (Jacobs et al., 2005). In contrast,\nJOE OPCs were generally flattened and were roughly bipolar\nduring the first 2 DIV, but after growth factor withdrawal at 3\nand 4 DIV, they elaborated larger processes and membrane\nsheets (Figure 8A). The observed morphological differences\nwere confirmed by quantitative assessment of the percentage\nof OPCs with processes having lengths equal to or greater\nthan four times the mean cell body diameter of the OPC\npopulation (Figure 8B). During the first 2 DIV, JOE cells\nmeeting this criterion comprised approx. 20% of the\npopulation. But, after these cells were transferred to\ndifferentiation medium without growth factors, the propor-\ntion of JOE cells with large processes rose to ,60%\n(Figure 8B).\nFigure 4 Effect of golli on cell survival\nOPCs were cultured as indicated in Figure 1(A).

However,\nthe available data suggest that golli does not affect the\ngenetic programme leading to the establishment of the\ncomposition of myelin. These results are consistent with\nprevious studies on golli overexpression in transfected\noligodendrocyte cell lines (Reyes and Campagnoni, 2002).\nGolli increases the response of OPCs to PDGF\nPDGF is the most potent proliferative factor for OPCs, and the\neffect of golli on OPC proliferation occurs only in the\npresence of growth factors. Since golli modulation of PDGF\nmitotic activity could be a possible explanation for our\nresults, we decided to investigate further the effect of golli\non PDGF mitogenic action. OPC primary cultures were treated\nwith different concentrations of PDGF, in the presence of\nbFGF (10 ng/ml), for the first 24 h after plating. In order to\nexamine the ability of PDGF to induce proliferation of\ncontrol, golli-KO and JOE cells, the relative number of NG2-\npositive/BrdU-positive OPCs was quantified in each cell\npopulation. In Figure 9, the percentage of NG2-positive/\nBrdU-positive cells in golli-KO and JOE OPCs compared with\ngenotype control OPCs is plotted as a function of PDGF\nconcentration. At all concentrations of growth factor,\nproliferation of the golli-KO OPC population was significantly\nlower than controls. The average percentage of proliferating\nOPCs in the golli-KO population was found to be almost half\nof the golli-KO control cells at all PDGF concentrations tested\n(Figure 9). In contrast, proliferation of the JOE OPCs was\nsignificantly higher than genotype controls (Figure 9). At\nFigure 5 Golli overexpression can lead to increased death of OPCs\nOPCs were cultured as indicated in Figure 1(A).

It exerts its effect through\ninteraction with receptors bearing intrinsic tyrosine kinase\nactivity (Taniguchi, 1995). Ca2+ signals activated after\nmembrane receptor recruitment is one of the most conserved\nresponses triggered in the target cells in which PDGF exert a\nmitogenic activity (Fatatis and Miller, 1997). It was shown\npreviously that golli proteins play a key role in the regulation\nof Ca2+ homoeostasis in OPCs (Paez et al., 2007). For this\nreason, we examined the effect of PGDF on intracellular Ca2+\nlevels in control and JOE OPCs. PDGF (40 ng/ml) induced a\nbiphasic increase in OPC intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]int\n). The first\nphase consisted of a sharp peak characteristic of a large\ntransient increase in [Ca2+]int\n(transient phase) (Figure 10A),\nwhich was followed by a second phase of slowly declining\ninternal Ca2+ concentrations (sustained phase) (Figure 10A).\nThe amplitude of the first phase of [Ca2+]int\nincrease induced\nby PDGF in the JOE cells was not significantly different from\nthe first 2 min of the second (sustained) phase, [Ca2+]int\nwas\nsignificantly higher in JOE cells than in control cells\nAfter pre-incubation of the cells in the absence of external\nCa2+ the second (sustained) phase of increased internal Ca2+\nlevels disappeared (Figure 10C), but the first (transient)\npeak was unchanged. In contrast, treatment of the\ncells with thapsigargin (Tg) in Ca2+-free medium to deplete\nintracellular stores, suppressed the transient [Ca2+]int\nincrease\nas well as the sustained phase of higher internal Ca2+ levels\n(Figure 10D). These results indicated that the first (transient)\nincrease after PDGF treatment was mediated\nprimarily by Ca2+ release from intracellular stores and that\nthe sustained phase was mediated by extracellular Ca2+ influx\ninto the cells. To analyse the effect of golli on Ca2+ entry\ninduced by PDGF, a protocol was used that involved store\nFigure 6 Absence of golli delays OPC differentiation\nPure OPCs from control and golli-KO mice were cultured for 2 days (1 and 2 DIV) in defined culture media plus PDGF (10 ng/ml) and\nbFGF (10 ng/ml).

As shown in\nFigure 10(E), application of PDGF to the cells in Ca2+-free\nmedium evoked an initial rise in [Ca2+]int\nwhich was due to\nrelease from intracellular stores. After this increase in\nhad returned to baseline levels, Ca2+ was added to\nthe extracellular medium, resulting in an elevation in [Ca2+]int\ndue to influx across the plasma membrane. Re-exposure to\nCa2+-containing medium triggered a significantly larger\nincrease in the fura 2 signal in JOE cells in comparison with\nresponses in controls (Figures 10E and 10F). Interestingly,\nopposite effects were observed in golli-KO OPCs (Figures 10E\nWe then examined the Ca2+ channels responsible for the\nincrease in [Ca2+]int\nduring the sustained phase. The transient\nincreases in [Ca2+]int\nstimulated by PDGF, in both control and\nJOE cells, and the Ca2+ sustained phase were unaffected by\npre-treatment with 50 mM verapamil, a VOCC blocker\n(Figure 11A). However, in both control and JOE cells, 25 mM\n2-APB (2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate), a specific SOCC\ninhibitor, completely abolished the sustained phase in the\nincrease due to PDGF treatment (Figure 11B). This\nwas also manifest as a decrease in both the peak Ca2+ signal\nand integrated Ca2+ transient following Ca2+ re-addition\nstore-operated Ca2+ entry, exhibited a similar degree of\ninhibition upon Ca2+ influx following store depletion with\nPDGF (Figures 11C and 11D). Thus the first phase of [Ca2+]int\nincrease in OPCs after PDGF treatment was due to Ca2+\nrelease from intracellular Ca2+ stores, whereas the second\n(sustained) phase of [Ca2+]int\nincrease was due to extracel-\nlular Ca2+ influx through SOCCs located on the plasma\nmembrane.\nThese results indicate that golli may influence the effects\nof PDGF on OPCs by modulating Ca2+ influx through SOCCs.\nFurther evidence for this interpretation came from exposure\nof the cells to BrdU for 24 h in the presence of channel\nblockers to measure proliferation (Figure 11E). These experi-\nments revealed that pharmacological blockers of SOCCs\ninhibited the golli-enhanced proliferation of OPCs in the\npresence of PDGF, whereas there was no effect in the\npresence of the VOCC blocker verapamil. Additionally, these\nexperiments are the first to demonstrate that extracellular\nCa2+ uptake through SOCCs is an important component in the\nmechanism of PDGF on OPC proliferation.\nHigh VOCC activity induces apoptosis in JOE\nIn a second set of experiments, we explored the hypothesis\nthat the effect of golli on cell death could also be a\nconsequence of golli-dependent Ca2+ homoeostasis in OPCs.\nWe performed live imaging experiments to examine and\ncorrelate cell death with Ca2+ changes in OPC cultures.\nAddition of 20 mM K+ to the bathing medium, a manipulation\nthat affects [Ca2+]int\nby depolarizing the membrane potential\nand activating VOCCs, caused an increase of the percentage\nof caspase 3-positive cells (Figure 12A). These effects were\nmore marked in JOE OPCs (Figure 12A). A reduced effect\ncompared with controls was noted in golli-KO OPCs, which\nappeared to be more resistant to apoptosis than control cells\nafter high K+ treatment (Figure 12B). Importantly, differences\nin the percentage of caspase 3-positive cells between\ngenotypes were blocked by verapamil and were abolished in\nthe absence of Ca2+ (Figures 12A and 12B), confirming that\nCa2+ influx via VOCCs are directly involved in golli-mediated\nmodulation of OPC death. Similar results were found using\nthe MTT assay for live cells. After 3 DIV, as shown in\nFigure 4(B), OPC viability was higher in control cells than in\nthe JOE group, but here the differences in cell viability were\nabolished by the VOCC inhibitors verapamil and Cd2+, and the\nabsence of extracellular Ca2+ (Figure 12C).\nDISCUSSION\nOligodendrocytes and their functions are impaired by the\nselective ablation of golli proteins due to abnormalities in\nCa2+ uptake and hypomyelination (Jacobs et al., 2005).\nSimilarly, targeted overexpression of golli in oligodendrocytes\nalso impairs Ca2+ homoeostasis and myelination in vivo and\nOPCs isolated from golli-KO and JOE mice provide useful\nreagents for probing regulation of Ca2+ channels by the\ngolli proteins as well as the role of Ca2+ channels in OPC\nfunction.\nFigure 9 Golli enhances the proliferative effect of PDGF on OPCs\nPure OPC cultures from golli-KO and JOE mice were treated, during the first\n24 h after plating (1 DIV), with different concentrations of PDGF in the\npresence of bFGF (10 ng/ml).

The present study indicates that golli overexpression\nincreases the proliferation rate of OPCs as assessed by several\nparameters including a decrease in the Tc\n. In contrast, golli-\nKO OPCs proliferated less robustly and showed a significant\nincrease in the length of the cell cycle. Thus it is likely that\ngolli promotes enhanced proliferation of OPCs in the\npresence of mitogens. In this regard, Filipovic and Zecevic\n(2005) reported that LPS (lipopolysaccharide)-induced\ninflammation promoted OPC proliferation through secretion\nof golli proteins from activated microglia.\nThe differences we noted in cell proliferation in the two\ngenotypes are likely to be explained by changes in the cell\ncycle duration, since the length of Tc\ncould progressively\nFigure 10 Effect of golli on internal biphasic Ca2+ response to PDGF\n(A and B) Fura 2 ratio of Ca2+ response to 40 ng/ml PDGF in OPCs from control and JOE mice at 1 DIV.

Recently, Cuddon et al. (2008)\nreported that PDGF activates store-operated Ca2+ entry in\nneuronal precursor cells, a finding that supports our data\nindicating that store-operated Ca2+ uptake is an essential\ncomponent of the PDGF mitotic mechanism in OPCs.\nOverstimulation of VOCCs induces apoptosis in\nThe role of Ca2+ as a death trigger was discovered three\ndecades ago in myocytes subjected to ischaemic insults\n(Fleckenstein et al., 1974). Since then, numerous studies have\ndescribed that lethal influx of Ca2+ can occur in many cell\ntypes as a consequence of receptor overstimulation and\nexposure to cytotoxic agents (Orrenius et al., 2003).\nOligodendroglial cells, like neurons, are vulnerable to Ca2+\noverload resulting from dysregulation of ion channels or\npumps, which triggers either apoptotic or necrotic cell death.\nGlutamate- and K+-mediated Ca2+ influx has been reported\nto cause oligodendrocyte death and myelin disruption, and\nmay be implicated in multiple sclerosis and ischaemia. Other\nstudies have shown that Ca2+ ionophores cause retraction of\nmembrane sheets and necrosis in cultured oligodendrocytes\nand induction of vesicular demyelination in vivo (Schlaepfer,\nSustained Ca2+ increases that overwhelm extrusion and\nbuffering mechanisms in oligodendrocytes trigger apoptosis.\nExcessive Ca2+ uptake can activate the mitochondrial\npathway of apoptosis signalling. This requires permeabiliza-\ntion of the outer mitochondrial membrane and the release of\npro-apoptotic mitochondrial proteins such as cytochrome c.\nUltimately, the apoptotic cascade activates proteases such as\ncaspases and calpains, which cleave numerous substrates\nincluding key components of the Ca2+ signalling system such\nas the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (Paszty et al., 2002).\nIn the present study, we found increased apoptotic cell\ndeath in JOE cells under basal culture conditions and after\nhigh-K+ stimulation. JOE cell death could be prevented by the\nVOCC inhibitor verapamil, and disappeared in the absence of\nCa2+, confirming that mechanisms involving Ca2+ influx via\nVOCCs are related directly to the effect of increased golli\nlevels on OPC death. In contrast, opposite results were found\nin golli-KO cells; after high-K+ treatment, golli-KO OPCs were\nmore resistant to apoptotic death.\nTo date, the role of VOCCs in oligodendrocyte death\nremains unclear. Earlier studies in models of optic nerve or\nspinal cord white matter anoxia showed that VOCCs\nparticipate in CNS white matter hypoxic injury (Fern et al.,\nexamined the role of VOCCs in mediating post-traumatic\naxonal conduction abnormalities in an in vitro model. They\nshowed physiological and immunohistochemical evidence,\nsuggesting that traumatic spinal cord white matter injury is\nassociated with Ca2+ influx through VOCCs expressed on\nperiaxonal astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. These studies\nsupport the notion that a sustained rise in intracellular Ca2+\nthrough VOCCs is a potential trigger for OPC/oligodendrocyte\ncell death leading to subsequent deleterious consequences on\nmyelination.\nIn conclusion, the present study has shown that golli serves\nas a regulating molecule that modulates oligodendrocyte\nproliferation and death through two different classes of Ca2+\nchannels, SOCCs and VOCCs respectively. Golli action on cell\nproliferation seems to be mediated by Ca2+ influx initiated by\nthe growth factor PDGF. The present study has not only\nunderscored the importance of golli on OPC differentiation,\nbut also revealed separate Ca2+ signalling pathways by which\nOPC proliferation and death may be regulated.\nFUNDING\nThis work was supported by the National Institutes of Health\nPostdoctoral Fellowship from the National Multiple Sclerosis\nREFERENCES\nAgrawal SK, Nashmi R, Fehlings MG (2000) Role of L- and N-type calcium\nchannels in the pathophysiology of traumatic spinal cord white matter\nAgresti C, D'Urso D, Levi G (1996) Reversible inhibitory effects of interferon-c\nand tumour necrosis factor-a on oligodendroglial lineage cell prolifera-\nAmur-Umarjee S, Phan T, Campagnoni AT (1993) Myelin basic protein mRNA\ntranslocation in oligodendrocytes is inhibited by astrocytes in vitro.
