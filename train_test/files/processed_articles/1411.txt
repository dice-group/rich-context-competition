Although\nincreased total cholesterol raises the risk of cardiovascular\ndisease, a lower level of serum cholesterol is associated with\nan increased risk of noncardiovascular causes of mortality,\nincluding cancer and respiratory disease (1\u00ad4). Several stud-\nies found that reverse causality, whereby subclinical disease\ncauses cholesterol lowering, accounted for the apparent\ninverse relation between cholesterol and cancer risk (1,\n5\u00ad7). A remaining question is whether the association of\ncholesterol with other noncardiovascular outcomes, particu-\nlarly respiratory mortality, is causal.\nAn overview of 19 observational cohort studies reported\na 30\u00ad40 percent increase in the risk of noncardiovascular,\nnoncancer mortality among subjects with lower total cho-\nlesterol (<160 mg/dl) and an inverse relation of total choles-\nterol to respiratory disease mortality (4). The associations\nwere unchanged after deaths occurring early in the follow-\nup period were excluded and after adjustment for age, dia-\nstolic blood pressure, cigarette smoking, body adiposity, and\nalcohol intake. More recently, Iribarren et al. reported an\ninverse association of serum total cholesterol with chronic\nbronchitis and emphysema mortality (3). The associations\nwere somewhat inconsistent but remained after early deaths\nwere excluded and after adjustment for confounding factors.\nFrank et al. observed an inverse association between total\ncholesterol and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease mor-\ntality that persisted after eliminating the first 5 years of\nfollow-up. They found that the excess risk was limited to\nsubjects whose cholesterol levels were below about 160\nmg/dl, but they observed no relation of cholesterol to chronic\nobstructive pulmonary disease mortality over the rest of the\ncholesterol range (6). On the other hand, the prospective\nWhitehall Study found that the association of low cholesterol\nlevels with respiratory causes of death did not persist in\nadjusted analyses (8). However, inclusion of pulmonary func-\ntion (forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1\n)) as a con-\nfounding factor may compromise the validity of this analysis\nif the relation of cholesterol to the risk of respiratory disease\nmortality is mediated by pulmonary function.\nThe evidence from clinical trials is equivocal. Early\noverviews of clinical trials of cholesterol-lowering medication\n(4) reported higher noncardiovascular mortality at lower cho-\nlesterol levels (9). The associations were marginally statisti-\ncally significant, spread over several causes of death, and\nunrelated to the strength of the intervention, casting some\ndoubt on the likelihood of a causal relation (4). Two recent\nmeta-analyses reported no association of cholesterol-lowering\ntreatment with noncardiovascular outcomes (10, 11).\nLipids and Pulmonary Function 843\nThus, the relation of cholesterol to pulmonary outcomes\nis unclear. While previous studies examined respiratory\nmortality or hospitalization for respiratory disease, to the\nbest of our knowledge published studies have addressed nei-\nther the association of cholesterol with pulmonary function\nnor the possibly distinct effects of the lipid subfractions.\nUsing data from the Third National Health and Nutrition\n  (NHANES III), we investigated the\nassociation between lipids and pulmonary function, specifi-\ncally FEV1\n. Both high density lipoprotein (HDL) and low\ndensity lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol were considered inde-\npendently, as were their respective apolipoproteins (apo) A-\nI and B.\nStudy population\nNHANES III was conducted in the United States from\ndetails of the survey design and examination procedures\nhave been published by the National Center for Health\nStatistics (12). For this study, the sample was restricted to\nadult subjects aged 17 years, yielding an initial sample size\nData collection\nTrained interviewers administered a detailed socioeco-\nnomic and medical history questionnaire, including a com-\nplete smoking history (number of years of smoking, current\nnumber of cigarettes smoked per day, number of years since\nquitting, etc.). Further measurements were taken at mobile\nexamination centers, including medical examinations and\nblood sample collection.\nBoth serum total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol were\nmeasured throughout the duration of the survey\nlowing precipitation of the other lipoproteins (13). Both\nassays were performed by using a Hitachi 704 Analyzer\n(Boehringer Mannheim Diagnostics, Indianapolis,\nIndiana). LDL cholesterol was calculated by using the\nFriedewald equation: (LDL cholesterol)  total choles-\nterol \u00ad (HDL cholesterol) \u00ad triglyceride/5 (14). This calcu-\nlation is valid for only those subjects fasting 9 hours prior\nto blood collection, with serum triglyceride levels of 400\nmg/dl; thus, calculated LDL cholesterol levels are avail-\nable for a subgroup of the total sample. Apo A-I and B\nwere assayed by either radial immunodiffusion or rate\nimmunonephelometry (13, 15), and the results were\nadjusted according to the World Health Organization\u00ad\nInternational Federation of Clinical Chemistry method\n(13). Serum vitamin C was measured by high-performance\nliquid chromatography with electrochemical detection, and\nserum vitamin E (-tocopherol) and -carotene were mea-\nsured by isocratic high-performance liquid chromatogra-\nphy with detection at two different wavelengths (13).\nSerum selenium was measured by using atomic absorption\nspectrophotometry. C-reactive protein was quantified by\nusing latex-enhanced nephelometry (13) on a Behring\nNephelometer Analyzer System (Behring Diagnostics Inc.,\nSomerville, New Jersey), with a lower limit of detection of\nThe medical examination included spirometry assess-\nments that met the American Thoracic Society minimum\nspirometry recommendations (16).

Each eligible subject per-\nformed about five trials, and reproducibility was checked\naccording to the American Thoracic Society standards.\nwas recorded as the highest value from all acceptable\nmaneuvers.\nStatistical analysis\nFor all models, the dependent variable was FEV1\ndivided\nby height squared. For each lipoprotein component (serum\ntotal cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, apo B,\nand apo A-I), a series of regression models was considered.\nInitial models assessed the association of the lipoprotein\ncomponent with FEV1\n, adjusting for potential confounding\nfactors (age, race, sex, income, and cigarette smoking repre-\nsented by eight variables to fully characterize length of\nexposure and dose). Further models assessed mediating\nvariables and effect modification by considering, for exam-\nple, body mass index (weight in kilograms divided by height\nin meters squared), serum antioxidant nutrients, and C-\nreactive protein. Finally, the lipoprotein subfractions were\nincluded simultaneously in a single model to assess the\nindependence of their effects. Fasting status of the subject\nwas considered, and analyses of the subgroup that fasted 9\nhours were compared with analyses including all subjects.\nLimiting analyses to fasting subjects made no difference in\nthe regression results; thus, only those analyses that\nincluded all subjects are reported in this paper (with the\nexception of LDL cholesterol, which was calculated for fast-\ning subjects only).\nAll regression analyses were adjusted for the complex\nsurvey design by using the PROC SURVEYREG procedure\nin SAS software (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina).\nSample weights were generated in NHANES III to account\nfor oversampling in certain subgroups and for nonresponse.\nAs per National Center for Health Statistics instructions,\nspecific weight variables were used in each analysis: total\nsample weights were used in HDL cholesterol analyses,\nphase I sample weights were used in the apolipoprotein\nanalyses, and fasting sample weights were used in LDL cho-\nlesterol analyses (12). The weights were incorporated into\nall regression analyses by using the WEIGHT statement in\nSAS software.\nRESULTS\nThe initial sample for this analysis consisted of 18,162\nadults aged 17\u00ad90 years. Subjects were excluded from fur-\nther consideration if they had an unreliable FEV1\nmeasure-\nment (i.e., the second-largest FEV1\nreading not within 5\npercent or 100 ml, whichever was greater, of the largest\nreading), missing FEV1\ndata, or missing height data\n(total excluded  1,678). To address the possibility of reverse\ncausality (i.e., disease per se causes an altered cholesterol\nlevel), we excluded remaining subjects with a physician\ndiagnosis of prevalent respiratory disease (814 subjects\nreported chronic bronchitis only, and 381 reported some\ncombination). Subjects with cancer (all forms except non-\nmalignant skin cancer) were also excluded (some with res-\npiratory disease had cancer, and 467 reported cancer only),\nThe excluded subjects were similar to the final study sub-\njects regarding most variables considered (table 1).\nExcluded subjects were on average older, a finding not\nunexpected since one of the reasons for exclusion was\nprevalent disease. The differences between the two groups\nconcerning other variables were largely the result of the\nolder age and/or the disease status of excluded subjects.\nEach lipoprotein component was first considered in a sep-\narate model. The baseline models were adjusted for con-\nfounding variables that were not postulated to mediate the\nrelation between lipids and FEV1\n(table 2). Both HDL com-\nponents, HDL cholesterol and apo A-I, were positively asso-\nciated with FEV1\n. Both LDL components, LDL cholesterol\nand apo B, were inversely associated with FEV1\n, although\nthe association of LDL cholesterol was weak before serum\nantioxidants were considered. The association of total cho-\nlesterol reflected the association of the LDL components.\nGiven that the low- and high-density subfractions were\nassociated with FEV1\nin opposite directions, subsequent\nanalyses focused on the subfractions. The linearity of these\nassociations was assessed by adding square terms to the\nregression models. Only the LDL components showed sta-\ntistically significant nonlinearity, but the nonlinear compo-\nnent was weak, suggesting a slight attenuation of the inverse\nassociation at higher lipid levels.\nIn these data, serum antioxidants were positively associ-\nated with pulmonary function, as reported previously by Hu\nand Cassano (17). Serum antioxidants had strong positive\nassociations with LDL cholesterol and apo B (correlation\ncoefficients, 0.2\u00ad0.6) and weak positive associations with\nthe HDL components (correlation coefficients, 0.0\u00ad0.2).\nThus, the association of lipids with FEV1\nadjusted for\nantioxidants was an important consideration (table 2), par-\nticularly for the lipid-soluble antioxidants vitamin E and -\ncarotene. Adjusting the regression models for serum antiox-\nidants (vitamin E, -carotene, vitamin C, and selenium) had\nlittle or no effect on the coefficients for either HDL choles-\nterol or apo A-I but strengthened the association of the LDL\ncomponents with pulmonary function. The inverse associa-\ntion of LDL cholesterol was strengthened about threefold\nand the inverse association of apo B about twofold.\nNegative confounding by the antioxidants partly masked the\ninverse association of the LDL components with pulmonary\nfunction.\nFurther models tested for modification of the lipid-FEV1\nassociation by lipid-soluble antioxidants. Both vitamin E\nand -carotene were statistically significant effect modifiers\nof the apo B-FEV1\nassociation. For subjects whose log vita-\nmin E levels were one standard deviation below the mean, a\nTABLE 1.

Coefficients for apo B were similarly dif-\nferent across levels of -carotene. There was no evidence\nthat lipid-soluble antioxidants modified the association of\neither LDL cholesterol or the HDL components with FEV1\n.\nLifestyle factors, including alcohol intake, adiposity, and\nexercise, were also considered as confounding variables.\nAlcohol intake (assessed by questionnaire; answering yes or\nno to the following question: \"Did you drink on 12 or more\noccasions in the past year?\") was positively associated with\nand with slightly higher HDL cholesterol levels.\nAdjustment for alcohol intake attenuated the association of\nHDL cholesterol with FEV1\nby about 30 percent. Adjusting\neither physical activity (answering the following question-\nnaire query: \"Compared with most (men/women) your age,\nwould you say that you are more active, less active, or about\nthe same?\") or body mass index had little or no effect on the\nHDL cholesterol-FEV1\nassociation. In adjusted analyses,\nnone of the lifestyle variables had any effect on the associa-\ntion of LDL lipoprotein components with FEV1\n.\nThe possible differential association of lipids with FEV1\nacross demographic subgroups was considered, although\nthere was no strong a priori hypothesis for such effect mod-\nification. For men, there were slightly larger effects for all\nthe lipids, but, overall, the direction and approximate mag-\nnitude of the coefficients were the same across race and sex\ngroups, as confirmed in stratified analyses. Similarly, slight\ndifferences were found in the magnitude of the LDL choles-\nterol-FEV1\nand apo B-FEV1\nassociations across the age\nrange. The associations were strongest in the middle adult\nyears and were slightly weaker at younger and older ages.\nUndiagnosed disease may cause changes in the lipid pro-\nfile, contributing to reverse causality. C-reactive protein, an\nacute-phase reactant, was considered as a biologic marker of\nan underlying pathophysiologic process (table 2). C-reactive\nprotein was strongly negatively associated with FEV1\n(for a\nperson of height 1.7 m,   \u00ad66 ml for each milligram-per-\ndeciliter increase in log\ne\n-tranformed C-reactive protein (95\npercent confidence interval: \u00ad79, \u00ad55)). However, C-\nreactive protein had little or no relation to lipids (all corre-\nlation coefficients were <0.1), and adding C-reactive protein\nto the model had little or no effect on the lipoprotein-FEV1\nassociations. Underlying, but undiagnosed respiratory dis-\nease can be predicted by low FEV1\n(18); thus, further analy-\nses excluded subjects with the lowest pulmonary function\n(the lowest 5 percent of FEV1\npercent predicted, in which\nobserved FEV1\nis compared with what would be predicted\nbased on age, height, and sex (16)). Both the HDL choles-\nterol-FEV1\nand LDL cholesterol-FEV1\nassociations were\nonly slightly attenuated, and there was little or no change in\neither of the apolipoprotein coefficients.\nHDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol are inversely asso-\nciated (in these data, r  \u00ad0.14); therefore, further analyses\nconsidered the independence of their effects (table 3). When\nHDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were included in a\nsingle model, both retained their respective positive and\nnegative associations with FEV1\n. The apolipoproteins had\nlittle or no correlation in these data; consequently, inclusion\nof both apo A-I and apo B in a single model made little or\nno difference in their respective associations with FEV1\n.\nWe compared the full sample and the sample excluding\nthose subjects with low cholesterol (i.e., total cholesterol \nassociations were\nessentially unchanged, except that the effect size for LDL\ncholesterol was reduced by a third (p  0.2). In both groups,\nthe lipid-FEV1\nassociations were about the same across the\nage range (both age and age-squared interaction terms were\nincluded). For the low-density components, the association\nwas slightly larger nearer the mean age, but the direction of\nthe effect was unchanged in all models. Next, we considered\nthe low-cholesterol group separately because several past\nstudies have suggested an increased risk of adverse respira-\ntory outcomes in this region of the distribution (total cho-\nTABLE 2.

In each case, the\ndirection of the effect was reversed among older persons. In\nyoung and middle age, a lower apo B level was associated\nwith higher FEV1\n; however, at older ages, a lower apo B\nlevel was associated with lower FEV1\n. In young and middle-\nage subjects, a higher HDL cholesterol level was associated\nwith higher FEV1\n, but, in older subjects, a higher HDL cho-\nlesterol level was associated with lower FEV1\n. The pattern\nof results was similar for apo A-I. In simultaneous models\nconsidering both HDL cholesterol and apo B, the associa-\ntion of each variable was attenuated by about 25 percent.\nDISCUSSION\nPrior research has suggested an association between a low\nlevel of serum total cholesterol and an increased risk of non-\ncardiovascular mortality, particularly respiratory disease\nmortality (3, 4). If such a relation does indeed exist, it might\noperate through an association of serum lipids with pul-\nmonary function, given that FEV1\nis an excellent predictor\nof the risk of respiratory disease and respiratory disease\nmortality (19). In the NHANES III data, the total choles-\nterol-FEV1\nassociation paralleled the LDL findings: both\nwere inversely associated with FEV1\n(lower levels were\nassociated with better pulmonary function). Conversely, the\nHDL components were positively associated with FEV1\n(lower levels were associated with worse pulmonary func-\ntion). Findings were similar for both of the cholesterol and\napolipoprotein components, and the density subfractions\nwere independently associated with FEV1\n.\nAlthough the literature suggests an increased risk of all-\ncause and respiratory disease mortality with lower choles-\nterol levels, we found that associations with total cholesterol\nmay be misleading. The correlation of total cholesterol with\nLDL cholesterol was lower in the group with low choles-\nterol compared with the full sample (0.67 vs. 0.93), and the\ncorrelation of total cholesterol with HDL cholesterol was\nassociations also varied by age (for the HDL\ncholesterol\u00adtotal cholesterol association, r  0.20 in the\nyoung, low-cholesterol group vs. r  0.02 in the older, low-\ncholesterol group), suggesting that what is conveyed by total\ncholesterol differs by both age and average cholesterol level.\nMoreover, the lipid subfractions were differentially associ-\nated with FEV1\n, suggesting that total cholesterol is a poor\nsummary variable in any case.\nCould the differential associations of the lipid subfrac-\ntions with pulmonary function reflect an underlying differ-\nence in the biology? LDL may have an adverse effect by\ncontributing to endogenous oxidative burden and hence to\nthe pathophysiology of chronic obstructive pulmonary dis-\nease (20). In contrast, HDL may have a positive effect\nthrough its role in immune regulation. HDL has been shown\nto bind to bacterial endotoxin as well as to relieve inflam-\nmation (21, 22), suggesting a potential role for HDL in pre-\nventing lung tissue damage. Cholesterol also is a constituent\nof lung surfactant; however, the relation of surfactant prop-\nerties to FEV1\n, or the possibly distinct relations of the lipid\nsubfractions to surfactant, is unclear.\nWe stratified the sample by total cholesterol, since previ-\nous studies found an excess risk of noncardiovascular mor-\ntality primarily for persons whose total cholesterol levels\nwere <160 mg/dl. In the low-cholesterol group, there was\nheterogeneity by age: among young and middle-age persons\nwith low cholesterol, the findings were similar to those for\nthe total sample: higher LDL components were associated\nwith worse lung function, and higher HDL components\nwere associated with better lung function. However, for\nolder persons with low cholesterol, lower LDL components\nwere associated with worse lung function, a result consistent\nwith the finding that lower total cholesterol is associated\nwith a greater risk of respiratory disease (and, in this sub-\ngroup, total cholesterol had little or no correlation with HDL\ncomponents so would mainly reflect LDL components).\nThere may be additional heterogeneity among the subgroup\nof older persons with low total cholesterol, given that,\nfor some, levels may be stably low while for others they\nmay be acutely low and/or declining (23). If a biologic rela-\ntion underlies observations that lower cholesterol increases\nthe risk of respiratory outcomes, advancing our understand-\ning rests on further consideration of effect modification by\nage, lipid subfractions, and longitudinal patterns in lipid\nsubfractions.\nThese NHANES III findings may reflect a biologic\nprocess or may have resulted from reverse causality and/or\nconfounding not adequately addressed in this cross-\nsectional study. If preexisting disease that compromises pul-\nmonary function also affects serum cholesterol (23, 24), the\ndisease may induce the association of the lipid subfractions\n. Although this issue cannot be fully addressed in\nthis cross-sectional study, analyses excluding all prevalent\nTABLE 3.

The lipopro-\ntein components may be markers for some other aspect of diet\nor lifestyle that may affect both lung function and the levels\nof HDL and LDL. A series of models addressed known pre-\ndictors of both pulmonary function and lipid level to identify\nconfounding factors that might account for the associations\nwe observed. None of these models identified important\nsources of confounding, although some lifestyle variables\nwere poorly measured in these data (for example, alcohol\nintake); thus, residual confounding is indeed possible.\nConfounding may also occur if an underlying condition that\nled to pathologically high lipid levels might, through other\nmechanisms, affect pulmonary function. Excluding subjects\nwith clinically abnormal total cholesterol levels (defined as\neither the top 5 percent or higher than 220 mg/dl) had little or\nno effect on the reported associations. Since chronic inflam-\nmation has been shown to cause hypocholesterolemia in older\npeople (23), a proxy for inflammation (C-reactive protein)\nwas considered, but no changes were observed in any of the\nlipoprotein-FEV1\nassociations.\nAge significantly modified the association between LDL\ndeclines with age, while LDL cholesterol\nincreases with age up to late middle age, after which it\nplateaus and then declines. The LDL-FEV1\nassociation was\nstrongest in the age range in which both lung function and\nlipid levels are changing with age (in opposite directions,\nhence the inverse association). HDL components do not\nvary much by age, and no difference was found in the HDL-\nassociation by age. Further research should explore\nthis finding.\nIf the effect of lipoproteins on noncardiovascular mortal-\nity was due solely to cholesterol's correlation with antioxi-\ndants, as suggested in a recent review (1), then controlling\nfor four serum antioxidants known to affect lung function\nwould be expected to attenuate the association of FEV1\nwith\nthe lipoprotein components. The dramatic increase in the\nmagnitude of the LDL-FEV1\nassociation suggested that\nthere was in fact negative confounding by the serum antiox-\nidants. In cardiovascular disease, the mode of action of LDL\ninvolves oxidation of the LDL particle into a more potent\natherogenic agent (25), a process that can be reversed by\nantioxidants (26). We hypothesized that, at lower levels of\nantioxidants, there might be increased levels of oxidized\nLDL contributing to the overall levels of endogenous oxida-\ntive burden in the lung. Thus, we tested antioxidant-LDL\ninteractions and found that, at lower levels of both vitamin\nE and -carotene, the association of apo B with FEV1\nwas\nstrengthened, as hypothesized.\nFrom a measurement perspective, apo B is thought to\nhave less \"noise\" than LDL cholesterol as a measure of the\nLDL subfraction because of the variable density of LDL\ncholesterol on LDL particles (15). In addition, there may be\ndifferent levels of measurement error in the two constituents\ngiven that apo B was measured directly, while LDL choles-\nterol levels were calculated by using the Friedewald equa-\ntion (14). Similarly, HDL cholesterol may have less noise\nthan apo A-I as a measure of the HDL subfraction because\nof the dynamic exchange of apo A-I proteins between HDL\nparticles (15). In models that considered these lipoprotein\ncomponents simultaneously, apo B and HDL cholesterol\nretained strong, significant, independent associations with\npulmonary function, perhaps reflecting the measurement\nissues described above, although the degree of association\nbetween the particle components (LDL cholesterol and apo\ncludes a definitive conclusion. Subsequent research should\nconsider whether there may be distinct functional roles in\nlung tissue for the lipid versus protein component of the\nlipoproteins.\nA strength of this study is that it used data from a nation-\nally representative population sample with high-quality\nmeasurement (13, 27). An interesting finding is that the\nlipoprotein subfractions have differential associations with\npulmonary function. The fact that previous attempts to relate\nserum total cholesterol levels with respiratory outcomes\nwere inconsistent may be partly explained by the lack of\nconsideration given to the lipid subfractions. Because a sin-\ngle measurement of the lipid components contains noise\n(i.e., random error) relative to the usual, long-term average\nlevel, our findings may have been affected by regression\ndilution bias, and the true magnitude of these associations\nmay be larger.\nFurther research should consider how the range of popula-\ntion cholesterol levels affects the cholesterol-FEV\nassocia-\ntion (e.g., by studying a naturally low cholesterol population).\nSuch research should also shed light on whether chronically\nlower cholesterol levels are qualitatively different from\nacutely lowered cholesterol levels achieved through drug\ntreatment. Future studies should also investigate the time\ncourse of the cholesterol-FEV1\nrelation by using longitudinal\ndata (e.g., by studying changes in lipids in relation to the age-\nrelated decline in pulmonary function).\n"
