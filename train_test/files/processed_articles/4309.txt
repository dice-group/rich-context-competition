This\nstudy investigated how different variants of completion influence visual search for an occluded\ntarget object. In two experiments, participants searched for a target among distractors in displays\nthat either presented composite objects (notched shapes abutting an occluding square) or\ncorresponding simple objects. The results showed enhanced search performance when\ncomposite objects were interpreted in terms of a globally completed whole. This search benefit\nfor global completions was found to be dependent on the availability of a coherent, informative\nsimple-object context. Overall, these findings suggest that attentional guidance in visual search may\nbe based on a target ``template'' that represents a globally completed image of the occluded\n(target) object in accordance with prior experience.\n",

To overcome this\nlimitation and establish continuity, amodal completion has been described as a mechanism\nthat fills in missing perceptual information (Michotte, Thine\n` s, & Crabbe\nCorresponding author:\nSiyi Chen, Department Psychologie, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universita\n\u00a8t Mu\n\u00a8nchen,\nGermany.\nEmail: Siyi.Chen@psy.lmu.de\nCreative Commons CC BY: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License\n(http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) which permits any use, reproduction and distribution of the work without further\npermission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages (https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/\nopen-access-at-sage).\ni-Perception\njournals.sagepub.com/home/ipe\nObject integration across occlusions is usually ambiguous and may, for instance, involve local\nor global completion (R. J. Van Lier, Leeuwenberg, & Van der Helm, 1995). For example, as\nillustrated in Figure 1, a local completion constitutes a smooth continuation of the visible\ncontours of the background shape behind the occluding square (Kellman & Shipley, 1991).\nConversely, global completion emphasizes global relations of the occluded object, in\nparticular symmetry (Buffart, Leeuwenbert, & Restle, 1981). Another alternative might\nrepresent an occluded figure in terms of a ``mosaic,'' that is, without amodal completion.\nPrevious studies investigating amodal completion using visual search paradigms\ndemonstrated that, when observers are provided with sufficient time for encoding,\ndetection of a partially occluded target item relies on a completed object representation\ninstance, search for a notched target disk abutting an occluding square, in an array of\ncomplete distractor disks and squares, turned out to be relatively inefficient--suggesting\nthat the notched target is represented as a complete object, that is, as being rather similar\nto the distractors (Rauschenberger & Yantis, 2001; Rensink & Enns, 1998). Other studies\nshowed that distractors in a search display bias the interpretation of a given composite target\nfigure (Rauschenberger, Peterson, Mosca, & Bruno, 2004), indicating that a given\ninterpretation of an object depends on the context within which it is presented.\nHowever, in these studies, object completion usually results in an unambiguous\nFigure 1. Illustration of the experimental stimuli with their respective composite and simple versions\n(depicting global or local completion variants, or a corresponding mosaic interpretation).\nrepresentation (e.g., a circle completed behind a square), whereas in natural scenes, occluded\nobjects may be ambiguous and local and global processes may lead to qualitatively different\ninterpretations of the very same visual input (R. J. Van Lier, Van der Helm, & Leeuwenberg,\n1995). To address this issue of object ambiguity, this study investigated how different variants\nof completion influence visual search for a partially occluded target.\nOf note in this context, recent work has shown that visual working memory tends to\nrepresent occluded objects in terms of globally completed wholes, rather than local\ncompletions (Chen, Mu\n\u00a8 llner, Mu\nstimuli, see Figure 1). A benefit of global over local completions was also reported in\nstudies that used an implicit primed matching task (Sekuler, Palmer, & Flynn, 1994;\nR. Van Lier, 1999). Given this pattern of evidence, one might predict that visual search\nfor an occluded target among (occluded) distractors is likewise governed by global, but\nnot local, completions. This study was designed to test this hypothesis, by investigating\nhow various types of completion impact visual search performance. Observers were\nrequired to detect a target among distractors in displays that either presented composite\nobjects (notched shapes abutting an occluding square) or corresponding simple object\nvariants that would correspond to global, local, or mosaic interpretations of the composite\nobjects (see Figure 1). To effectively enforce a given interpretation of the composite objects,\nobservers were provided with a consistent context of simple-object displays among\nambiguous composite object displays (Chen et al., 2016)--so as to examine whether the\nvarious completion types would differentially affect visual search performance.\nExperiment 1\nMethod\nParticipants. Sixteen volunteers (six males, two left-handed) with normal or corrected-to-\nnormal vision participated in Experiment 1 (mean age \u00bc 20.94 years), either for payment\nof E8.00 per hour or for course credits. All observers were naive as to the purpose of the\nstudy and provided written informed consent. The experimental procedure was approved by\nthe ethics committee of the Department of Psychology, Ludwig-Maximilians-University,\nMunich.\nApparatus and stimuli. The experiment was controlled by a Windows 7 computer, running\nMatlab and Psychophysics Toolbox (Brainard, 1997). The stimuli were black line drawings\ncomposite and simple objects (see Figure 1), which was adapted from previous studies\ncomposite figure included a square (2.1 \u00c2 2.1) with a second shape positioned partly\noccluded next to the square (Figure 1, composite). Every simple figure was presented in\nthree variants, corresponding to three possible alternative interpretations of the composite\nobject: global completion, local completion, and mosaic (see Figure 1, simple). Global\ncompletions presented a symmetrical shape interpretation of the occluded object, whereas\na local completion was based on the smooth continuation of the visible parts of the occluded\nshape. A mosaic figure simply presented a 2D cutout outline shape identical to the visible\npart of the partly occluded figure. The widest aspect of each simple object touched the\nborders of a circular region with a radius of 2.4 of visual angle. For each search display,\nthree, five, or seven distinct objects from the same completion condition (with a given shape\nappearing up to three times in the same display) were presented randomly at nine positions\nChen et al. 3\nwithin a circular region subtending 12.4 of visual angle. Figure 2 shows two example search\ndisplays.\nProcedure and design. Each trial started with the presentation of a central fixation cross for\n500 ms. Next, participants were presented with a search display of simple or composite\nobjects until they responded. Their task was to search for a cross-shaped target (i.e., one\nof the items displayed in Figure 1(a)), and to indicate, by pressing the left/right mouse key,\nwhether the target was present/absent, respectively. The target was always a variant of the\ncross-shaped stimulus (Figure 1(a)), with the other three object types serving as the distractor\nshapes (Figure 1(b)\u00ad(d)). Observers were asked to respond as quickly and as accurately as\npossible. In case of an erroneous response, feedback was provided by presenting an\n``alerting'' sign (``\u00ad'') for 1,000 ms at the center of the screen. Trials were separated from\neach other by an interval of 500 ms.\nThe experiment was subdivided into three parts, with each part consistently displaying one\ntype of simple object shape representations--that is, global, local, or mosaic--in the search\ndisplays. Thus, in each part, half of the trials presented displays consisting of one particular\ntype of simple objects, which were presented randomly intermixed with the other half of trials\nthat displayed (ambiguous) search layouts of composite objects (see Figure 2). Thereby, we\nwere able to enforce a corresponding interpretation of the composite (occluded) objects\nwithin a given experimental part (Chen et al., 2016). The order of presentation of the three\nparts was randomized. Within each part, the different configuration (simple and composite),\nset size (three, five, or seven items) and target (present and absent) conditions were presented\nin randomized order across trials. There was one initial block of 12 practice trials, followed\nby 372 trials per part (yielding 1,116 experimental trials in total), with short breaks after every\nResults\nThe analysis of the error rates and reaction times (RTs) focused on target-present trials,\nfollowing previous search studies investigating amodal completion (Rauschenberger &\nYantis, 2001; Rauschenberger et al., 2004). Target-present trials were primarily analyzed\nFigure 2. Left: Example three-item search display with composite objects (target-present trial with the\nto-be detected target cross in the top-left corner of the display). Right: Example of a three-item display\npresenting simple, global completion objects (target-absent trial without a cross-shaped target).\nbecause they provide a match between the memory representations of the to-be-searched-for\ntarget with one of the objects present in the display. On target-absent trials, the decision when\nto terminate search when no target is found may add substantial variance to the response\ntimes (Chun & Wolfe, 1996), which is why these trials were discarded from the analyses\npresented here.\nErrors. The mean overall error rate was 3.2%. Errors were examined by means of a repeated-\nmeasures analysis of variance (ANOVA), with the factors object (simple and composite),\ninterpretation (global, local, or mosaic), and set size (three, five, and seven). This ANOVA\np\n\u00bc .52, and interpretation,\np\n\u00bc .31, and the Object \u00c2 Interpretation interaction was\np\n\u00bc .18. Error rates were overall comparable for\nsimple objects (2.5%, 2.3%, and 3.5% for global, local, and mosaic shapes, respectively,\nps > .12); for composite objects, by contrast, fewer errors were made with global (4.8%) than\nwith local (7.7%) and mosaic (7.7%) interpretations (ps < .02). No other significant effects\nwere obtained (ps > .28).\nReaction times. Outliers (\u00c62 SDs from the individual mean of each observer for each\ncompletion type) and error responses were excluded from the RT analysis (overall 4% of\nall trials).

In addition, the Object \u00c2 Interpretation interaction was\np\n\u00bc .43. For simple objects, the RTs were slowest for\nthe mosaic (585 ms), intermediate for the local (535 ms), and fastest for the global (506 ms;\nps < .03) interpretation. For composite objects, by contrast, RTs were faster for global\ndifference between local and mosaic interpretations (p \u00bc .59). Note that the relatively fast RTs\nfor the global interpretation in composite objects were nevertheless slower than the\ncorresponding RTs for simple global objects, t(15) \u00bc 9.17, p < .0001. Finally, there was also\np\n\u00bc .59, revealing a 25-ms increase in RTs\nfrom the smallest to the largest set size (ps < .018). No other effects were significant (ps > .12).\nDiscussion\nThe results of Experiment 1 demonstrate that simple-object search varied across the different\ninterpretations of the cross-shaped target, revealing relatively efficient search (in terms of the\nmean RTs) with global followed by local and mosaic object types. This indicates that search\nvaried as a function of the complexity of the objects' shape, with more complex shapes\nreducing the search efficiency (see, e.g., Conci, Mu\nfor composite objects, only search for the globally completed target afforded faster (and more\naccurate) responses compared to local- and mosaic-type objects (even though the perceptual\ninput was identical in all cases). However, search for a global interpretation of the composite\nobject was still less efficient than search for a simple global target, which potentially resulted\nfrom a perceptual difference between these two types of stimuli (e.g., due to the additional,\noccluding square in composite objects, see Figure 1(a)). Despite these perceptual differences,\nour results show that the context provided by trials presenting simple objects (in a given part\nof the experiment) engendered some form of ``priming'' that affected the interpretation of the\nwith previous findings in a working memory task (Chen et al., 2016, 2018), priming by the\nsimple-object context led to an increased search efficiency for the globally completed\n(composite) objects--indicating that the completion of a symmetrical global object can\nfacilitate search.\nExperiment 2\nExperiment 2 was performed to further test the above hypothesis that the simple-object\ncontext primed search for (globally completed) composite objects--by examining whether\ncompletion would be evident in composite objects even when no consistent context is\navailable. This was realized in Experiment 2 by presenting the various types of simple\nobjects within the same experimental part--separated from another part that presented\ncomposite object trials. If the interpretation of a given composite object is determined\nmainly by the context of simple objects prevailing throughout a block of trials (as\nsuggested by Experiment 1), then removing the informative context should eliminate any\nbenefit of completion for the composite objects in Experiment 2.\nMethod\nExperiment 2 was essentially identical to Experiment 1. A new group of 16 right-handed\nvolunteers (eight males, mean age \u00bc 27.06) was tested. All participants had normal or\ncorrected-to-normal vision and were naive concerning the purpose of the experiment.\nSimple and composite objects were presented in two separate experimental parts. In the\nsimple-object part, participants were asked to report the presence or absence of a cross-\nshaped target, which could be either the global, the local, or the mosaic ``interpretation''\nof the cross (Figure 1(a), simple) among other simple object distractors of the same\ncompletion type for a given trial (Figure 1(b)\u00ad(d), simple). Thus, this part of the\nexperiment presented one of the three possible target shapes, with the particular shape\nselected at random from one trial to the next. In the composite-object part, observers\nsearched for the composite cross (Figure 1(a), composite) among other composite\ndistractors (Figure 1(b)\u00ad(d), composite). Thus, for composite objects, no differentiation\nbetween global, local, and mosaic object types was possible; accordingly, the composite\nobject trials were collapsed into a single condition. The experiment started with one block\nof 18 practice trials (presenting either simple or composite search displays), followed by five\nexperimental blocks of 108 trials each within a given part, amounting to 1,116 trials in total\n(as in Experiment 1). Participants were presented with the simple- and composite-object parts\nin randomized order.\nResults\nErrors. The mean error rate was 2.4%. A repeated-measures ANOVA with the factors object\nand set size revealed no significant effects (ps > .05). A subsequent ANOVA performed only\non the simple objects also revealed no significant difference among the global, local, and\nmosaic interpretations (ps > .05).\nReaction times. Outliers and error responses were again excluded from the RT analysis (3% of\nall trials). Figure 3(b) presents the mean correct RTs as a function of set size, separately for\nthe composite (left panel) and simple objects (right panel). A repeated-measures ANOVA,\nwith the factors object and set size, revealed main effects of object, F(1, 15) \u00bc 5.29, p \u00bc .036,\np\np\n\u00bc .56, and a significant interaction, F(2,\np\n\u00bc .32. This effect pattern shows that search for the composite target\nwas less efficient than simple object search (mean search slopes of 16 and 8 ms/item,\nrespectively). Next, an ANOVA on the simple objects with the factors interpretation and\np\np\np\n\u00bc .19, to be significant. Search was less efficient for mosaic (16 ms/item) than for global\n(3 ms/item) and local (5 ms/item) simple object interpretations (ps < .02).\nAn additional analysis compared search for the composite object target to the various\ntypes of simple objects. This analysis revealed that composite object search was less efficient\nsearch; but search for composite objects was comparable to search for simple mosaic\nobjects, t(15) \u00bc .15, p \u00bc .89, indicating a relatively inefficient search for composite objects.\nFurther analyses compared the simple and composite object conditions between\nExperiments 1 and 2 (see Figure 3). First, for composite objects, the search slopes in\nExperiment 2 were comparable to the corresponding slopes for mosaic--9 ms/item;\ncomposite objects in Experiment 1, but they were higher than for the composite, global\nSecond, for simple objects, a mixed ANOVA revealed main effects of interpretation, F(2,\np\np\np\n\u00bc .15. Search was less\nChen et al. 7\nefficient for mosaic (13 ms/item) than for global (4 ms/item) and local (4 ms/item)\ninterpretations, but without revealing differences between the two experiments (ps > .2). In\nother words, searching for the various types of simple objects was overall comparable across\nthe two experiments.\nDiscussion\nThe results of Experiment 2 closely replicated the pattern of results for simple objects in\nExperiment 1, showing comparable variations in search across global, local, and mosaic\nobject interpretations. For composite objects, search was found to be comparable to\nsimple mosaic objects (but less efficient than for local or global simple objects). Moreover,\nthe search slopes for composite objects in Experiment 2 were also comparable to local and\nmosaic composite object interpretations in Experiment 1 but higher than the global\ncomposite interpretation. This pattern suggests that without simple-object priming, no\ncompletion occurs and search remains inefficient as a result (with search performance\nessentially being comparable to the uncompleted mosaic condition). The combined results\nof Experiments 1 and 2 thus indicate that a given consistent context can expedite search for\noccluded objects.\nGeneral Discussion\nThe present results show that visual search for composite objects can be facilitated by amodal\ncompletion. Experiment 1 revealed faster (and more accurate) search when a composite\nobject was interpreted as a globally completed whole, while search in physically identical\ndisplays was comparably more inefficient in blocks associated with an interpretation in terms of\na locally completed whole or for an uncompleted mosaic object. Importantly, this effect was\nobtained only when the simple-object context supported a coherent interpretation of the\ncomposite shapes (Experiment 1); without any such informative context, searching displays\nof composite objects was comparably inefficient to uncompleted mosaic objects (Experiment 2).\nA potential explanation to account for the advantage of global object completions appeals\nto the internal representation used to guide search, that is, some form of ``attentional\ntemplate''. Such templates are thought to hold target representations stored in visual\nworking memory, top-down biasing search to any objects in the visual array that match\nthe template (Desimone & Duncan, 1995; Humphreys & Mu\nperspective, our results would indicate that, given a predictive simple-object context, a\nglobally completed template representation is set up preferentially and this regular,\nsymmetric specification of the target then in turn expedites performance by directly\nguiding focal attention to the (partially matching) target object--which, as a result of the\ntop-down projection, is then actually interpreted or ``perceived'' as globally completed. This\nis consistent with previous findings that have established a link of object completion to\nworking memory processes (Chen et al., 2016, 2018) and suggests that some imagery\nprocess completes the missing, occluded information, thereby generating an effective,\nperceptually simple template (a global ``Gestalt'') that in turn expedites target detection.\nAlthough a symmetric global target representation facilitated search, representations of\nmosaic-type or locally completed targets were found not to be comparably efficient in\nproviding search guidance--likely because they are more difficult to construct and\nmaintain as a template in visual working memory.\nIt should also be noted that, in Experiment 2 (without consistent context), search\nfor composite objects was comparable in efficiency to search for the simple-object\nmosaic condition. This suggests that completion is not automatic but comes into play only\nwhen the context consistently enforces a given interpretation of the composite object (Chen\nrather than bottom-up grouping, might therefore determine the interpretation of an occluded\nobject (see also Conci & Mu\n\u00a8 ller, 2014)--the implication being that amodal completion, in\nfact, reflects a cognitive, rather than a perceptual, mechanism.\nOne potential limitation of this study is that an effect of completion was demonstrated\nwith a rather small stimulus set, namely, by comparing search performance for the various\ntypes of the cross-shaped target (Figure 1(a)). That is, the observed effects might be due to\nparticularities of this shape configuration--where the global object interpretation (of a\nsymmetric cross) is more familiar than the corresponding local and mosaic variants.\nOf note, however, we used the very same stimulus set in a previous study that employed\na change detection task (Chen et al., 2016). In these experiments, the target item (i.e., the\nitem that exhibited a to-be-detected change) varied from trial to trial, and the various\ntargets were also variable in terms of their familiarity. Nevertheless, a robust advantage\nfor the global interpretation was observed, suggesting that the current results based on\na single target shape do generalize to other shapes. Moreover, a study by Shen and\nReingold (2001) showed that more familiar search stimuli might even lead to a\nreduction of search performance (relative to an unfamiliar stimulus set). This again argues\nthat the observed benefit for the global interpretation is not simply attributable to object\nfamiliarity.\nIn summary, the present findings indicate that amodal completion operations may\nenhance search by providing, in particular, a symmetric global shape representation\n(template) to guide attention effectively to the target. However, global object completion\ndoes not rely on automatic integration processes but does instead critically depend on the\nsearch environment providing a coherent interpretational context--in line with the notion of\nan experience-dependent template that represents a completed search image of the occluded\n(target) object.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or\npublication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or\npublication of this article: This work was supported by project grants from the German Research\nFoundation (DFG; FOR 2293/1).
