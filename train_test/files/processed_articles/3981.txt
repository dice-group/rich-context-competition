    "abstract": "Abstract: Past research suggests that various courtship rituals, such as romantic kissing,\nmay convey useful mate quality information. Two studies were carried out to examine how\npurported romantic kissing abilities, as a potential cue to some form of mate information,\naffect appraisals of potential mating partners. In Experiment 1, 724 participants were\npresented with vignette descriptions of potential mating partners and were asked to rate\npartner desirability for various mating-related situations. The primary result of this\nexperiment was that purported kissing ability increased mate desirability in \"casual sex\"\nmating situations for women to a greater extent than for men. Experiment 2 repeated the\nsame procedure with another 178 participants, this time including visual information\nalongside vignette descriptions containing kissing-related information to examine the\nrelative effects of these two modalities. It was found that the presence of a picture\nalongside a descriptive vignette negated the effect of kissing-related information only when\nrating potential partners on attractiveness or desirability for further courtship, though not\nwhen evaluating partners for casual sex or long-term relationship scenarios. Visual\ninformation containing \"attractive\" photos of potential partners was also found to have a\ngreater effect on men's ratings of partner desirability than on women's ratings of partner\ndesirability. The results are discussed in light of romantic kissing's potential function of\nconveying important mate quality and desirability information, and its relative role in the\npresence of additional visual mate cues.\n",

In recent years, it has been found that humans display distinct aptitudes\nwhen it comes to evaluating the suitability of potential mating partners. The construct of\nRomantic kissing and mate desirability\n\"attractiveness,\" many aspects of which are cultural universals (Langlois et al., 2000;\nPerrett, May, and Yoshikawa, 1994; Singh, 1993), seems to be utilized heuristically to\nassess mate desirability and is purported to act as a proxy for a mate's underlying genetic\nfitness. Attractiveness (as rated subjectively by observers) has variously been found to\nsignal genetic health by virtue of fluctuating asymmetry (Grammer and Thornhill, 1994),\nmasculine/feminine physical dimorphism (Little, Burt, Penton-Voak, and Perrett, 2001),\nfemale waist-to-hip ratio (Pawlowski and Dunbar, 2005; Singh, 1993), voice quality\n(Collins and Missing, 2003), skin color (Stephen et al., 2012) and various olfactory cues\nSignals of mate quality, such as attractiveness, seem to be assessed in differing\nways by the two sexes due to the differing levels of minimal parental investment found\namong humans, with the greater reproductive burden placed squarely on the shoulders of\nwomen in the form of an extended period of gestation and lactation (Trivers, 1972).\nBecause of this difference, it appears that each sex has evolved behavioral predispositions\nthat place the greatest value on mate selection criteria that complement these different\nreproductive costs. It has been found that, compared to men, women undertake a more\nrigorous and discriminatory mate-selection process that places the highest value on both\ntraits signaling high genetic quality and parental investment potential. Men, on the other\nhand, tend to prioritize the pursuit of short-term mating partners, focusing almost\nexclusively on signs of genetic quality and fecundity, and displaying a willingness to\npursue a much broader spectrum of potential mates with lower levels of these traits (Buss\nBecause selecting a mate is often made within the context of a wider \"biological\nmarketplace\" of individuals who each compete for mating partners, it follows that each\nindividual must also consider their own \"mate value\" when formulating mating aspirations\n(Kavanagh, Robins, and Ellis, 2010; Noe and Hammerstein, 1994). Previous research has\nshown that attractiveness is generally considered to be the most desirable trait among\nwomen, is of considerable importance to men, and serves as a reliable surrogate measure\nfor an individual's mate value. Research in this field has demonstrated that attractive\nwomen show increased preferences for male masculinity and symmetry (putative good\ngene indicators), while also demanding higher standards of potential mating partners than\nless attractive females in areas such as resource acquisition potential and good parenting\nindicators (Little et al., 2001; Shackelford, Schmitt, and Buss, 2005; Todd, Penke, Fasolo,\nIt has been proposed that kissing, a near-ubiquitous custom among human cultures\n(Eibl-Eibesfeldt, 1972; Kirshenbaum, 2011), may play a significant role in the process of\nhuman mate assessment and relationship maintenance (Hughes, Harrison, and Gallup,\nhumans by facilitating olfactory assessment of various cues for genetic compatibility (see\nWedekind, Seebeck, Bettens, and Paepke, 1995), health (Durham, Malloy, and Hodges,\ncycle phase and fertility (Thornhill et al., 2003). Although limited kissing behaviors have\noccasionally been observed in our closest primate cousins, bonobos and chimpanzees (de\nWaal and Lanting, 1997; de Waal, 2000), these rarely occur in mate assessment situations.\nRomantic kissing and mate desirability\nRomantic kissing is also thought to play a secondary role in established relationships,\nhelping mediate the kinds of long-term pair-bonds that aid in the process of rearing\nAlthough it is unclear at this point exactly which of these mate assessment and\nretention functions romantic kissing might serve, it is almost certain that, like our other\nmate assessment competencies, it works primarily at a sub-conscious level (Buss and\nSchmitt, 1993). Just as individuals may decide that someone is attractive without being\naware that their appraisal is based on the fluctuating asymmetry that signals basal genetic\nfitness, it is likely that romantic partners evaluate a kissing situation, sensing that a\npotential partner is a \"good\" kisser for example, without being cognizant that this\nassessment may result from a sub-conscious appraisal of some variant of their genetic\nsuitability. Indeed, research into the differences between partner preferences and real-life\npartner choices seems to confirm that individuals sometimes lack self-awareness when it\ncomes to factors that influence their actual mate choice behavior (Eastwick and Finkel,\nRecent research into kissing behavior among college students has found interesting\ndifferences between men and women in their perceptions of the importance of kissing\nduring various courtship and mating situations. Using self-report measures, it was found\nthat men generally placed less emphasis on kissing than women, and that women placed\ngreater value on kissing during both the early stages of courtship, potentially as a mate\nassessment device, and in the later stages of a long-term relationship, possibly to maintain\nand monitor the pair-bonds that underlie such relationships (Hughes et al., 2007). More\nrecent evidence has also found that participants who are generally more sensitive to cues\nsignaling genetic quality, including women, high mate-value participants, and participants\nhigh in sociosexual orientation, placed greater importance on kissing in early stages of\nromantic relationships and were more likely to have their attraction to a potential mate\ninfluenced (either positively or negatively) by an initial kiss (Wlodarski and Dunbar,\n2013a). Attitudes towards kissing in romantic interactions have also been found to vary\nacross the menstrual cycle, with women in high conception risk cycle phases, who typically\nshow the greatest sensitivity to cues signaling fitness (Gangestad and Thornhill, 1998;\nHavlicek, Roberts, and Flegr, 2005; Little, Jones, and Burriss, 2007; Penton-Voak et al.,\n1999), stating that kissing was more important at initial relationship stages than women at\nlow conception risk cycle phases (Wlodarski and Dunbar, 2013b).\nThe aim of the present experiment was to determine whether romantic kissing-\nrelated information can affect the process of human mate assessment. It was hypothesized\nthat participants led to believe that a potential mating partner is a \"good kisser,\" a manifest\ncue potentially signaling a mate's underlying genetic quality/suitability, will find them\nmore attractive, will be more willing to pursue further courtship (i.e., a date) with them,\nwill be more interested in pursuing non-committal sex with them, and be more willing to\nconsider pursuing a long-term relationship with them. It was further hypothesized that\nalleged kissing abilities will have a greater influence on female partner preferences than on\nmale partner preferences, as they have been found to be the more selective sex when it\ncomes to utilizing signals of mate fitness. It is believed that individuals who are higher in\n\"mate value,\" as well as female participants, will generally be more discerning in their\nappraisals of potential romantic partners, less likely to find potential partners desirable, and\nRomantic kissing and mate desirability\nwill place a greater premium on kissing abilities.\nExperiment 1\nMethods\nParticipant recruitment\nAn online questionnaire was distributed to several public US- and UK-based online\npsychological testing repositories, as well as to colleges at the University of Oxford, to\nrecruit a convenience sample of participants. Participants were required to be over 18 years\nof age to complete the survey. No identifying personal data were collected, and participants\nwere informed that their responses were completely voluntary and anonymous. Participants\nprovided informed consent and were offered the chance to enter a prize draw for an online\nshopping voucher upon completion of the questionnaire. Although these data were\ncollected as part of a larger study on kissing, with results relating to kissing attitudes\npublished separately in Wlodarski and Dunbar (2013a), the results presented here on\nvignette ratings have never been published.\nIn total, 724 participants took the survey to completion, of whom 244 were male\n14.8% of men and 3.5% of women stated that they were either mostly or exclusively\nattracted to the same sex. The majority of the participants self-identified as being ethnically\nCaucasian (77.5%); 4.8% were Latino and 2.8% South Asian. The sample was mostly\nnationals. High school education was completed by 99.3% of participants, with 47.6%\nhaving attained a diploma or some college experience. Roughly half of the participants\n(54.6%) stated that they were in a relationship at the time of the survey.\nThe study was approved by Oxford University's Research Ethics Committee.\nQuestionnaire design\nParticipants were presented with descriptive vignettes of four different target\nindividuals of the sex they stated they were most attracted to, and were asked to answer\nseveral questions about each. The vignettes were developed to represent descriptions of\nvarious personality and relationship-history traits describing each hypothetical target\nindividual, who was also assigned a common English first name. Aspects of target\nindividual \"personalities\" were described using six to seven positive, as well as two to three\nnegative, adjectives made up of positive or negative antonyms (e.g.,\ntrustworthy/untrustworthy, warm/cold, intelligent/unintelligent), which previous research\nfound consistently rated as desirable or undesirable personality attributes (Anderson, 1968)\nand which have been used successfully in previous research to create descriptive vignettes\n(e.g., Fisak, Tantleff-Dunn, and Peterson, 2007). Negative descriptions were included\nbecause early pilot testing indicated that purely positive descriptions were less believable or\n\"realistic\" than mixed positive and negative descriptions. Several neutral descriptions of\npastimes and casual hobbies (such as running or cooking) were also included to improve\nauthenticity. The second half of each vignette consisted of a \"third-hand\" account\ndescribing the target individual's relationship and sexual competences and experience; for\nRomantic kissing and mate desirability\nexample, a description of how good their previous partner thought they were in bed, or\nwhether they \"enjoyed physical intimacy.\" One of the competencies described in all the\nvignettes was the target individual's kissing abilities, which acted as the independent\nvariable. The exact same four vignettes were presented to every participant, except that half\nof the participants were randomly assigned to see vignette 1 and 4 altered to say the target\nindividual was a \"good kisser\" and vignettes 2 and 3 altered to say the individual was a\n\"bad kisser,\" whereas the other half of the participants were presented with the same\nvignettes stating the opposite about their kissing abilities, with vignettes 1 and 4 describing\nthe target individual's kissing skills negatively and vignettes 2 and 3 describing them\npositively. The comparison of responses between participants seeing the same vignettes\ndescribe a target individual as either a \"bad\" or \"good\" kisser formed the primary\nindependent variable of interest (i.e., the kissing condition).\nAn example vignettes is included below:\nRob has been described by friends as pretty trustworthy and honest. One of his\nfavourite pastimes is cooking and staying in at home to read a good book. Though\nhe is not very sociable, and some people see him as downright unfriendly and\nrude, he is very intelligent and open to trying new experiences. When his personal\nrelationship skills were evaluated by his previous partners, they reported that Rob\ncould be quite romantic at times, that he was a good kisser, and can be a bit\nadventurous when it comes to love making. He is very respectful of others and\nwarm once you get to know him.\nUpon being presented with a vignette, each participant was asked four questions\nabout the person described in the vignette (target individual), including \"How `attractive'\ndo you find this person?\" \"How interested would you be in going on a date with this\nperson?\", \"How interested would you be in having a casual, one-off sexual encounter with\nthis person?\", and \"How interested would you be in pursuing a committed, long-term\nrelationship with this person?\" Responses were collected using a 5-point Likert-type scale\nranging from 1 (\"not at all\") to 5 (\"extremely\"). Participants in relationships were asked to\nimagine they were single for the purposes of answering these questions. Multivariate\nanalysis confirmed that there were no significant differences in mean answers to these four\nquestions between single participants and participants in a relationship, F(4, 719) = 1.87, p\nBecause self-ratings of attractiveness have previously been found to correlate highly\nwith both other-rated judgments of attractiveness and with behaviors related to mating\naspirations (Kavanagh et al., 2010; Roberts and Little, 2008), self-rated attractiveness was\nused as a proxy measure for real-world mate value. Participants were asked to answer the\nquestions \"How do you think other people would rate you on physical attractiveness?\" and\n\"How do you think other people would rate you on sexual attractiveness?\" on a 7-point\nLikert-type scale ranging from \"very low\" to \"very high.\" Mate value was estimated by\naveraging participant responses to these two questions, with this mean score then further\ngrand mean centered for inclusion in the MLM analyses as a covariate of interest. The\nsecond half of the questionnaire also asked various demographic questions about sex, age,\neducation, ethnicity and nationality.\nRomantic kissing and mate desirability\nStatistical analyses\nThe experiment involved asking every participant four questions about each of the\nfour vignettes they read, with the effects of purported kissing quality analyzed using\nmultilevel modelling techniques. Multilevel modelling was most appropriate in this context\nbecause it allowed interpretable aggregate ratings of attractiveness/mate-desirability despite\nmultiple measures being taken for each participant and the non-independence of these\nratings within each participant. Mixed Linear Models (MLM) were created to run these\nanalyses, with participant ratings of the different vignettes treated as random factors (with\nrandom slopes and intercepts) in each model. Each MLM model also had two predictor\nvariables included as fixed factors: kissing condition and participant sex. The predictor\nvariable of participants' mate value (as estimated by their self-rated attractiveness) was also\nincluded in each model as a fixed covariate. Each MLM included tests for the main fixed\neffects of every predictor variable, as well as two-way and three-way interactions between\nthe main predictor variable of interest (kissing condition) and the other two factors.\nAnswers to the rating questions for each target vignette were the level 1 units of analysis,\nwith participants acting as the level 2 units of analysis. The independent variable of\n\"kissing quality,\" that is whether each participant was rating a vignette describing someone\nas a \"bad\" or a \"good\" kisser, was a level 1 factor.\nAll analyses were carried out in SPSS (version 22.0, SPSS Inc., 2013). All\nsignificance values within each of the MLM models are automatically adjusted for multiple\ncomparisons by SPSS, and further adjustment between models was not deemed appropriate\nin this context as all the main analyses carried out in this paper were planned in advance,\nrather than being carried out as post-hoc analyses.\nResults\nEffects of purported kissing quality on ratings of attractiveness\nFor the question \"How attractive do you find this person?\", significant main effects\nwere found for kissing condition and sex, with no main effect for mate value and with no\nsignificant two-way or three-way interaction effects present (see Table 1).\nTable 1.

Post-hoc MLM analyses of the interaction effect suggested that\nalthough kissing had a significant effect on interest in casual sex amongst men (bad kisser:\nwomen this effect was more pronounced (bad kisser: M = 1.80, SE = 0.04; good kisser: M\nFigure 1.

Effect of kissing condition and sex on interest in pursuing a relationship\nDiscussion\nThe results of this experiment indicate that participants led to believe that someone\nwas a \"good kisser\" rated them as more attractive, and were more willing to go on a date\nwith them, to have casual sex with them, and to pursue a committed relationship with them\nthan if they were led to believe that the same individual was a \"bad kisser.\" Overall, men\nwere more likely to rate target individuals as attractive and were more willing to pursue a\ndate, casual sex, or a long-term relationship with them than women. The effect of kissing\nability on mate desirability was significantly more pronounced among women than among\nmen, but only when rating willingness to pursue a casual sex encounter. It was also found\nRomantic kissing and mate desirability\nthat participants high in mate value were less interested in a romantic relationship, but more\ninterested in casual sex, with a potential partner.\nThese findings support those of previous research that indicate kissing can play a\nrole in mate assessment, with purported kissing abilities of a potential partner affecting\ntheir attractiveness and desirability for different mating situations, including courtship,\ncasual sex, and long-term relationship contexts. On its own, this result may merely reflect\nthe fact that any domain general trait rated as \"good\" might positively affect overall mate\ndesirability. However, once this result is examined in light of its interaction with sex, the\nrole of kissing becomes more obvious. It was found that the positive impact of purported\n\"kissing quality\" on a participant's willingness to have casual sex with a potential partner\nwas significantly greater for women than it was for men, suggesting that women may be\nparticularly influenced by this factor. When examined in light of previous findings that\nwomen are the more selective sex during the mate assessment process, and are particularly\nattuned to, and discriminating about, cues signaling superior genetic fitness (Candolin,\nsuggestive of the conclusion that kissing may convey some mate quality information.\nThese findings support previous research on attitudes towards romantic kissing\nacross different stages of mate assessment. Experiments have suggested that women\ngenerally place greater importance on romantic kissing in most romantic partner\ninteractions and seem to do so because it serves both to convey information regarding mate\nquality and/or suitability, and to help in the mediation of established long-term attachment\nbonds (Hughes et al., 2007; Wlodarski and Dunbar, 2013a). Our data seem to confirm the\nuse of romantic kissing as a tool for initial mate assessment, by showing that women, more\nthan men, were significantly influenced by kissing quality in casual sex situations (where it\nmay convey genetic quality information). A similar trend can be seen in our data when it\ncame to assessing mates in long-term relationship contexts, with kissing quality seeming to\nhave a greater effect on women than men, suggesting that kissing may also be useful in\nlong-term relationship situations (where it can mediate pair-bonds). However, this trend did\nnot reach statistical significance levels (interaction effect p = .066), and therefore is only\nsuggestive at this point. These trends were not evident when merely judging general mate\nattractiveness or showing interest in pursuing a \"date,\" situations which have less\nimmediate fitness consequences than casual sex or a long-term relationship (either in the\nform of pregnancy resulting from casual sex, or the significant time and effort investments\nof a relationship). This suggests that kissing-acquired information may be particularly\npertinent for mating situations with immediate fitness outcomes, perhaps due to the fact\nthat romantic kissing is not without its risks, such as exposing relative strangers to\nnumerous potential infection hazards (Cowan et al., 2002; Schoch-Spana, 1992; Tully et\nThe current experiment also found that men were more likely across the board to\nfind descriptions of potential mating partners more attractive, were more willing to date\nthem, much more willing to have casual sex with them, and more willing to pursue a\nrelationship with them. This result is in line with previous observations that the smaller\nminimal parental investment burden shouldered by men favors short-term mating strategies\ninvolving the pursuit of a much broader range of potential mating partners (Buss and\nRomantic kissing and mate desirability\nmore discerning sex when it comes to partner choice was most clearly highlighted by their\nmuch lower willingness to pursue casual sexual encounters as compared to men, the one\nsituation that carries the highest immediate risk of incurring parental burden, and one that\nmight be considerably more onerous if choice of mating partner is poor.\nOur findings also demonstrate that mate value can play a role in the evaluation of\npotential romantic partners. Participants of higher mate value (i.e., those who rated\nthemselves as more attractive) were found to be less interested in pursuing a romantic\nrelationship with a potential partner, although they were more interested in pursuing casual\nsex. This variation in mate desirability among participants with differing mate values is\npartly explained by the theory that mate choice exists in the context of a wider \"biological\nmarketplace,\" where individuals who are in high demand, and are cognizant of the fact that\nthey are in high demand, can be generally more selective when choosing potential mates\n(Noe and Hammerstein, 1994; Pawlowski and Dunbar, 1999). In this case, high mate value\nindividuals were less likely to wish to pursue long-term relationships with any of the target\nindividuals described in the vignettes, perhaps because they can afford to be selective about\nwith whom they wish make such significant mating investments. Attractive men and\nwomen have been previously found to be more promiscuous in their mating strategies (i.e.,\npreferring casual sexual encounters to long-term relationship situations, with these\nstrategies potentially explaining why we found higher mate value to be associated with\ngreater interest in pursuing casual sex.\nExperiment 2\nBecause kissing is just one of many cues that are used when assessing the value of\npotential mates, it is likely that the effects of kissing might be affected by the presence of\nother mate cue information. Humans are a primarily visual species, and although past\nresearch suggests that there is multi-modal interplay between the senses when it comes to\nmate assessment, it is visual cues that are generally prioritized over our other senses\nthis, it seems likely that in the presence of both kissing-related informational cues and\ntraditional visual cues, visual cues may take precedence when it comes to making\nassessments about a potential mate. Furthermore, as research shows that men are\nneurologically more responsive to visual sexual stimuli than women (Hamann, Herman,\nNolan, and Wallen, 2004), sex differences may exist in the relative value placed on visual\ncues of attractiveness as compared to other cues, such as olfactory cues as assessed by\nromantic kissing. This suggests that the presence of visual cues may affect the impact of\nany mate quality cues inherent in kissing.\nTo examine the role of visual cues, a smaller sample of participants were presented\nwith the same kissing vignettes as in Experiment 1, but alongside visual mate information\n(i.e., a profile picture). It was predicted that kissing information would generally be less\neffective at influencing mate assessments when placed alongside visual mate information,\nwhich is the dominant sensory modality in humans. Furthermore, it was predicted that men\nwould be more influenced by the presence of visual cues than women, due to their greater\nreliance on visual mate information.\nRomantic kissing and mate desirability\nMethods\nParticipant recruitment was the same as for Experiment 1. A total of 178\nparticipants completed the survey with pictures present alongside each descriptive vignette,\nthe sample, 10.9% of men and 3.5% of women stated they were either mostly or\nexclusively attracted to the same sex. Participants predominantly self-identified as\nCaucasian (80.3%), with 4.5% identifying as South Asian and 3.4% as Latino. The sample\nwas mostly made up of British (51.7%), North American (26.4%), and Western European\n(5.6%) nationals. High school education was completed by 98.9% of participants, with\n44.4% having attained a diploma or some college experience. Slightly more than half of the\nparticipants (57.9%) stated that they were in a relationship at the time of the survey. A\nmultivariate test again showed that there were no significant differences between single\nparticipants and participants in a relationship on answers to questions about partner\nQuestionnaire design\nThe design of the questionnaire in this experiment was identical to that of\nExperiment 1, except that participants were also shown four different \"headshot\" images of\nhypothetical mating partners (target individuals), with one image paired with each of the\nfour vignettes. The images consisted of life-like composite photos (corrected to be\nindistinguishable from real photos) of faces that had been previously rated as either highly\nattractive (two photos) or unattractive (two photos) (Braun, Gr\u00fcndl, Marberger, and\nScherber, 2001; Jones et al., 2010). The design ensured that each participant viewed two\nvignettes with partners described as bad kissers, one vignette partnered with an attractive\nphoto and one with an unattractive photo, and two vignettes rating partners as good kissers,\none with an attractive photo and one with an unattractive photo.\nParticipants were again asked four questions about the target individual based on\ntheir vignette and photo: \"How `attractive' do you find this person?\", \"How interested\nwould you be in going on a date with this person?\", \"How interested would you be in\nhaving a casual, one-off sexual encounter with this person?\", and \"How interested would\nyou be in pursuing a committed, long-term relationship with this person?\" Responses were\ncollected using a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (\"not at all\") to 5 (\"extremely\").\nStatistical analyses\nThe same Mixed Linear Model analyses were carried out as in Experiment 1, with\nthe addition of \"partner attractiveness\" as a fixed factor, both as a main effect and as an\ninteraction effect with the other predictor variables in each model.\nResults\nEffects of purported kissing quality on ratings of attractiveness\nFor the question \"How attractive do you find this person?\", significant main effects\nwere found only for attractiveness of the picture presented, with no main effects for kissing\ncondition, sex, or mate value.

The interaction effect meant\nthat men were more willing to pursue a relationship with target individuals with attractive\nTable 8. Effects of purported kissing quality on willingness to pursue a long-term\nrelationship\ndf F p\nDiscussion\nThe results from Experiment 2 show that although the presence of visual\ninformation alongside a descriptive vignette eliminated the effect of \"good kissing\"\nabilities on ratings of partner attractiveness and interest in going on a date with that partner,\nthe presence of visual cues did not alter the positive effect of kissing quality information on\npartner desirability for casual sexual encounters or long-term relationships. Not\nsurprisingly, participants presented with attractive pictures of a hypothetical target partner\nrated them as more attractive, and were more willing to go on a date, pursue casual sex, or\na committed relationship with them. In all cases, however, this effect was moderated by\nsex, with attractive visual information having a much greater effect on men's ratings of\npartner desirability than on women's ratings.\nRomantic kissing and mate desirability\nFigure 3. Interaction effects of sex and picture attractiveness on ratings of partner\nattractiveness, willingness to go on a date, interest in casual sex, and interest in relationship\nFigure 3a. Attractiveness ratings Figure 3b. Interest in going on a date\nFigure 3c. Interest in casual sex Figure 3d. Interest in relationship\nThese findings highlight the conflicting roles that different mate cues might play in\nthe process of assessing and selecting a mate. That the presence of visual information\ninterferes with kissing-related mate information, though only in certain mate selection\nsituations, suggests there is a more complex interplay between these two cues than initially\nassumed. When it came to assessing potential mates on relatively innocuous mate\nassessment criteria, such as rating their attractiveness or going on a \"date,\" participants\nseemed to rely exclusively on visual information. However, when partners were assessed in\nlight of the potentially more \"costly\" mating situations of pursuing casual sex or a\nrelationship, where the consequences of poor mate choice are more immediate and severe,\nthen kissing-related information managed to significantly affect partner assessment even in\nthe presence of visual cues. This suggests that kissing might convey salient information\nabout a potential mate, either about their genetic fitness (compatibility) or their long-term\nrelationship potential, which is at least as important as information that can be garnered\nfrom visual cues. This finding mirrors past research suggesting a complex multi-modal cue\ninterplay whereby people take into account, and prioritize, certain cues depending on the\nmating context that they find themselves in (Foster, 2008; Kovacs et al., 2004; Saxton et\nResults from Experiment 2 also suggest that men and women react differently to\npicture attractiveness, with men rating potential partners much more positively on all\ncriteria in the presence of an attractive picture than women, suggesting that they are more\nRomantic kissing and mate desirability\ninfluenced by picture attractiveness than women. This finding is in line with a large body of\npast research that indicates men in general tend to prioritize cues of physical attractiveness\nand fecundity in potential partners more than women (Buss, 1989; Townsend and\nWassermann, 1998; Waynforth and Dunbar, 1995). Furthermore, men also show higher\nphysiological responses to visual sexual stimuli than women (Hamann et al., 2004), thus\nfurther explaining the greater influence of visual cues on mate decisions found in this\nexperiment. It is interesting to note that although visual cues still had some effect on female\nratings of attractiveness and willingness to pursue a date or casual sex, they did not affect\nfemale ratings of interest in pursuing a relationship. This is likely because women place\ngreater value than men on mate cues signaling potential, long-term parental investment\nmore difficult to assess from basic morphological visual information alone.\nLastly, when it came to mate value this experiment replicated some of the findings\nof Experiment 1, showing that high mate value participants were less likely to wish to\npursue a relationship with target individuals in the presence of a picture, while also being\nless likely to pursue casual sex with a \"good kisser\" target individual in the presence of an\nattractive picture. Furthermore, it was also found that high mate value participants rated\npotential partners as less attractive if they were also rated as a bad kisser. These results may\nagain demonstrate the increased levels of selectivity displayed by high mate value\nparticipants, who can afford to be more selective and thus may discount a greater\nproportion of potential mates as less desirable across multiple different mating situations.\nGeneral Discussion\nThe primary finding of this study is that purported kissing abilities can influence a\npotential mate's attractiveness and general desirability, particularly for women in casual\nsex situations. Whereas previous research on attitudes towards romantic kissing has been\nconducted using self-report attitude measures (i.e., Hughes et al., 2007; Wlodarski and\nDunbar, 2013a), this study is the first to use an experimental design in an attempt to\nmeasure whether romantic kissing conveys information that is actively utilized in the\nprocess of mate assessment. Although the findings presented here corroborate the notion\nthat kissing serves a functional role in mating situations, we can still only speculate at this\npoint as to the mechanisms by which kissing might carry out these functions. It is likely\nthat kissing works to affect initial mate assessment by bringing two individuals into close\nproximity so as to facilitate some kind of olfactory/gustatory assessment, since olfaction in\nmost mammals, as well as in humans, can play an important role in assessing potential\nmates (e.g., Penn and Potts, 1999; Wedekind et al., 1995). In established relationships, on\nthe other hand, the contact and physiological arousal initiated by continued romantic\nkissing is likely to also affect feelings of attachment between individuals over time,\ninfluencing the release of neuropeptides (including oxytocin and vasopressin), dopamine,\nand opioids, which have all been variously associated with human pair-bonding (de Boer,\nvan Buel, and Ter Horst, 2012). Future, more methodologically challenging research is\nneeded to help clarify which of these mechanisms is the most likely pathway by which\nkissing can affect mating interactions.\nThese studies are also the first to examine the relative roles of kissing-based and\nRomantic kissing and mate desirability\nclassical visual mate information. The vast majority of research into human mate selection\nhas focused on visual mate cues, perhaps justifiably so as vision dominates human\ninteraction with the world (Levin, 1993). However, these results suggest that other mate\ncues, such as the kinds of olfactory cues that might be assessed during romantic kissing,\nmay also play an important role in this involved process. As olfaction is an important and\nevolutionarily-conserved mode of mate assessment across mammal taxa (Clutton-Brock\nand McAuliffe, 2009), the possibility exists that this sense may be a more accurate form of\nmate assessment than visual senses, which have only recently evolved to become the\ndominant sense in humans. Furthermore, these results highlight the need to take into\naccount the type of mate assessment being made by an individual (i.e., merely rating\nattractiveness versus rating desirability for long-term relationships), as these differing\nmating interactions seem to be affected in divergent ways by different mate cue modalities.\n"
