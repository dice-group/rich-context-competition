Individual, social and political trauma constitute a triangle of traumatisation\nwhich was strategically employed by the Egyptian counter-revolutionary forces \u00ad primarily\nthe army and the leadership of the Muslim Brotherhood \u00ad to maintain their political and\neconomic power over and above the social, economic and political interests of others.\nThrough the destruction of physical bodies, the fragmentation and polarisation of social\nrelations and the violent closure of the newly emerged political public sphere, these actors\nactively repressed the potential for creative and revolutionary transformation. To better\nunderstand this multi-layered notion of trauma, we turn to Habermas' `colonisation of the\nlifeworld' thesis which offers a critical lens through which to examine the wider political\nand economic structures and context in which trauma occurred as well as its effects on the\npersonal, social and political realms. In doing so, we develop a novel conception of trauma\nthat acknowledges individual, social and political dimensions. We apply this conceptual\nframing to empirical narratives of trauma in Egypt's pre- and post-revolutionary phases,\nthus both developing a non-Western application of Habermas' framework and revealing\nethnographic accounts of the revolution by activists in Cairo.\n",

The revolution started on the National Celebration\nof the Police Day and was directed at the brutality of Mubarak's crony capitalist police\nstate that directly infringed on people's physical integrity and emotional wellbeing\n(Ismail, 2011, 2012). The mobilising potential of the revolution was, however, cut short\nand the revolutionary ideals of `bread, freedom and social justice'were violently crushed\nby counter-revolutionary actors seeking to maintain political and economic power. High\nlevels of violence penetrated into all aspects of Egyptian society and engendered exten-\nsive individual and collective trauma.\nBased on testimonial life-story research with 40 young Caireen activists, we argue\nthat trauma in Egypt entailed interconnected experiences of betrayal in the personal,\nsocial and political realms (also see Matthies-Boon, 2017). Advancing an intersubjective\nphenomenological and triadic account of trauma, we argue that individual, social and\npolitical trauma emerged as normative expectations were betrayed and crushed by coun-\nter-revolutionary actors in violent pursuit of their own strategic economic and political\ninterests. Activists experienced a personal psychological breakdown of their assumptive\nworld \u00ad that is, their generalised beliefs about self-worth, meaningful others and the\nbenevolence of the world (Janoff-Bulman, 1992) \u00ad due to grave physical violence, or the\nimmanent and persistent threat thereof, both in the pre- and post-revolutionary periods.\nSuch shattering of the assumptive world also atomised social relations as activists expe-\nrienced deep existential loneliness aggravated by social fragmentation, dehumanisation,\nalienation and anomie. Individual trauma was thus intimately connected to social trauma.\nWe argue that these experiences of individual and social traumatisation were neither\naccidental nor the inevitable outcome of the revolutionary uprising, but rather a purpose-\nful act, namely, the direct outcome of what we call political trauma, the violent betrayal\nof a collective (revolutionary) striving for an inclusive public sphere.1\nIn order to grasp this intricate triangle of traumatisation, we turn to J\u00fcrgen Habermas'\n`colonisation of the lifeworld' thesis, which offers a critical lens on the political and eco-\nnomic dynamics through which such multiplying of trauma occurs. This perspective ren-\nders trauma a systematic attempt to break communicative, social and political relations.\nTrauma in the Egyptian case should not solely be understood from either an individualist\npsychological perspective or a social point of view, but rather as being constituted by politi-\ncal power and its violent strategic pursuit of instrumental reason. The dominant institu-\ntional actors (primarily the army and the Muslim Brotherhood leadership) sought to\nmaintain and strengthen their own economic, political and administrative power at the cost\nof deliberative power and the transformation of others. They sought to break Egypt's diver-\ngent forms of social and political activism by continuously exerting violent exclusionary\nmeasures on the public realm through physical violence, dehumanisation, polarisation,\nIn what follows, we first outline a critique of trauma conceptualised solely as an indi-\nvidual or social experience. We then develop a Habermasian-influenced conception of\ntrauma as constituting a multi-level process of traumatic betrayal. We apply this concep-\ntual framing to empirical narratives of trauma in Egypt's pre- and post-revolutionary\nphases. Such a Habermasian conception of trauma (and its empirical application) is cru-\ncial to our political understanding of such grave individual and social traumatisation and\ncontributes both to trauma debates and Habermasian scholarship. Its significance for the\nlatter is not only the provision of a non-Western empirical application of a key theme in\nHabermas' theoretical framework but also its attention to how the violent destruction of\nthe lifeworld is emotionally experienced. Habermas' rationalist account overlooks such\nemotional dimensions of the colonisation of the lifeworld since his philosophical project\nprioritises a cognitivist intersubjective reconstruction of universal reason (Crossley,\n1998). Yet the emotional experience of the colonisation of the lifeworld through multi-\nlayered forms of traumatic betrayal is crucial for practical and theoretical insights into\npolitical participation and emancipation since such emotional experiences when left\nunaddressed may become expressed through political apathy, social alienation and per-\nsonal meaninglessness which are difficult yet crucial to overcome for political praxis\n(see Matthies-Boon, 2017). Our argument also contributes to the trauma literature which\nhas largely reduced trauma to either an individualised, psychologised event or a social\nphenomenon without sufficient political consideration of the dynamics of systemic and\ncalculative reason that colonise the communicative realms of the lifeworld.\nTrauma: Individual, social and political betrayal\nAHabermasian understanding of trauma differs from the most common understanding of\ntrauma as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which was first included in theAmerican\nPsychological Association's (APA) practitioners' manual, the Diagnostic and Statistical\nManual of Mental Disorders (DSM), in the 1980s after sustained lobbying by Vietnam\nWar veterans. According to the latest definition (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of\nMental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5)), trauma occurs due to confrontation with death\nor threat of death or serious injury or sexual violence and results in symptoms such as\nintrusions (including flashbacks, dreams and nightmares), avoidance behaviour, negative\nmoods (including anger, depression, guilt and mistrust), arousal and hyperactivity (con-\ncentration and sleeping problems) (APA, 2013). While Egyptian activists may indeed\nhave many of the `symptoms' listed in the manual (see Matthies-Boon, 2017), this con-\nception of trauma remains overly `Cartesian' as it focuses on individualist diagnostic\nsymptoms over and above wider social and political processes of meaning-making.\nMuch of the mainstream trauma studies literature that employs notions of PTSD \u00ad and\nthis somewhat ironically includes the post-structuralist works that arose during the 1990s\nHabermas would call a philosophy of the subject. It hence suffers from the limitations\ninherent in such a perspective, projecting onto history a universalist conception of trauma\nthat ignores the contextual variations in how people respond to violent experiences\nPTSD makes reference to self, others and world, it does so from a cognitivist intra-psy-\nchical perspective that takes the mind and its thoughts as the primary analytical unit. It\nthereby replaces philosophical questions of meaning with questions of cognitive brain\nscience (see Bracken, 2002; Hacking, 1995). Consequently, trauma becomes a faulty\nbrain-wiring process: a shocking event which overwhelms the cognitive capacities of the\nbrain (see Caruth, 1996) and which disturbs the `software'of the brain, whose `hardwire'\nis perceived as universal (Bracken, 2002: 34). The brain is incapable of processing it into\nnormal memory and hence stores it in raw memory, resulting in flashbacks and other\nsymptoms of intrusion (Caruth, 1996). This is not to dismiss neuroscientific insights per\nse, but rather to draw attention to the intersubjective processes of meaning-making that\nRonnie Janoff-Bulman (1992) emphasises the intersubjective dimensions of trauma\nfrom an intrapsychic perspective when she argues that trauma breaks the socially consti-\ntuted assumptive world, that the meanings accorded to the self, others and the world are\ndestroyed. She explains that, with only a few exceptions, we have been socialised from\nan early age into believing that the world around us is benevolent, that social relations are\nmeaningful and that the self is worthy through our interactions with `good enough' car-\negivers. These early encounters form the foundation of our generalised expectations in\nlife: they are the `basis of our subsequent interactions in and interpretations of the world'\n(Janoff-Bulman, 1992: 21, 39). They hence maintain a `shared symbolic world that pro-\nvides communal expectations about daily existence' (Janoff-Bulman, 1992: 17). Of\ncourse, rationally we know these assumptions to be delusional, yet emotionally we rely\non them to build and maintain a stable and predictable world that enables us to positively\nfunction on a daily basis. The assumptive world is not immune to change: usually, it is\ngradually modified as we journey through life. However, in trauma, the changes to our\nassumptive world are sudden, deep and fundamental, as our basic trust in our relations to\nothers, the world and self is betrayed. This shatters `the world' we live in: the external\nworld suddenly appears random, overwhelming and malevolent; social relations become\nrandom and meaningless; and our sense of self-worth is destroyed. The most basic\nassumptions of our life are exposed as a delusion, leading to existential loneliness, alien-\nTrauma fundamentally ruptures the continuity between past, present and future. It\ndisrupts the contiguity between the social stock of knowledge and one's own experi-\nences, breaking the interpretative horizon within which meaning is made and resulting\nnot only in depression, anxiety, rage and terror but also in `speechlessness' (Bracken,\nagree \u00ad our vocabulary is intertwined with the interpretative horizon in which meaning\nis intersubjectively constituted. Once this order breaks down in trauma, no common\ninterpretative horizon can be found, save perhaps with other trauma survivors. For\nthe language we speak is part of the social order, and when the order falls apart around our ears,\nso does the language. What we can say no longer makes sense; what we want to say we cannot.\nTrauma thus effectively places barriers within social relations as intersubjective recogni-\ntion of such experiences, and the possibility of its communalisation through emotionally\nactive and non-judgemental engagement is inhibited.\nAccording to this phenomenological understanding of trauma, first-level (individual)\nand second-level (social) trauma are located on a spectrum: while they may be treated as\nanalytically distinct, they are intimately connected (Matthies-Boon, 2017). Drawing an\nanalytical distinction between first- and second-level trauma is not intended to establish\na hierarchy, but rather reflects the development of trauma theory which expounds indi-\nvidual accounts prior to exploring social and collective trauma. While first-level theo-\nrists such as Janoff-Bulman provide a socially rooted understanding of the individual's\ninternal, psychological experience of trauma, theories of social trauma (Alexander, 2012;\nsocietal destruction. Piotr Sztompka insists that social trauma occurs when deep social\nchange paralyses the potential for collective agency, mobilisation and processes of social\nbecoming. It is expressed through a sense of cultural disorientation and a deep paralysing\ndistrust towards other people and institutions (Sztompka, 2004: 165). Such paralysis\noccurs due to the destruction of `the socially shared pool of ready-made templates for\nsymbolising, interpreting, framing and narrating the ongoing social praxis', and leads to\nsocial isolation and exclusion, social polarisation and the dehumanisation of others\n(Sztompka, 2000: 45). Not all radical social change is necessarily traumatic: only in\ninstances where the traumatising conditions of change persist, or are possibly aggra-\nvated, does a cycle of social destruction occur that breaks the cultural stock of knowl-\nedge, resulting in social disorientation and anomie marked by distrust, demonisation,\nuncertainty and social anxiety (Sztompka, 2004: 165). Social trauma, therefore, is fore-\nmost a socio-ontological breakdown and fragmentation of social relations and structures\nthat bind societies together. It is a process of social alienation, isolation and polarisation\nas avenues for communicative interactions are inhibited due to deep destructive social\nchange.\nThe social trauma occurring in repressive authoritarian societies (such as those across\nthe Middle East, including Egypt) occurs due to the restriction of communicative spaces\nand the strategic destruction of potential forms of social and collective flourishing. These\nrepressive structures are socially traumatic in that they entail a\nsevere disturbance of the relation of individuals and groups with the larger community that\ncontains them. It is not only that they cannot go out into the streets without fear, but that they\nfeel forsaken by those who had the duty to succor them: authorities and social institutions. (De\nSocial trauma thus entails a foundational betrayal of social trust and disturbance of com-\nmunicative relations, as a result of which people have `withdrawn into a protective enve-\nlope, a place of mute, aching loneliness, in which the traumatic experience is treated as a\nsolitary burden'(Erikson, 1995: 195). This conception is similar to what Marlies Glasius\n(2012), referring to post-revolutionary cases in Eastern Europe and Latin America, calls\natomisation, namely, the deliberate isolation of each individual `from all his peers\nTrauma as systemic colonisation and political betrayal\nWe argue that in such contexts, trauma is inherently political. Hence, the political dimen-\nsion forms the third level of the model of trauma we offer. We understand political trauma\nto encompass the betrayal of the normative expectation to be treated as equal and worthy\nparticipants in public dialogue through the violent pursuit of strategic action. A useful\nnotion within the trauma studies literature is the concept of continuous traumatic stress\n(CTS), developed by South African anti-apartheid activists, which highlights the ongo-\ning and structural traumatic betrayal by political institutions (Eagle and Kaminer, 2013;\nStraker, 2013). In doing so, CTS overcomes the `eventism' inherent in mainstream\ntrauma theory: trauma is not a single event or short series of shocking events, but rather\nemerges due to a system of continuous abuse and violence. In cases of CTS, `systems\ndesigned to create a sense of accountability and to minimise harm to citizens are inef-\nfectual or overstretched, at best, or corrupt or collusive with informal systems of power\nat worst' (Eagle and Kaminer, 2013: 9). In these contexts, it is not only direct physical\nviolence by an aggressor that is traumatic but also the fact that such violations are accom-\npanied by `resignation, collusion, nonretribution and licence for further violation at a\nsystemic level' (Eagle and Kaminer, 2013: 10). In such (authoritarian) contexts, there is\nno respite from the continuous threat of violence, and the culture of fear and suspicion\natomises people, while the main perpetrators remain immune from public accountability\ndue to a closed or severely restricted public sphere.\nWhile CTS effectively describes the effects of CTS, the underlying logic of why CTS\noccurs remains hidden from view. It is here that we explicitly turn to Habermas' theory\nof systemic colonisation that reveals the logic of instrumental reason that underpins the\nbetrayal of the social contract between people and government and deliberately harms\nindividual and social relations in the lifeworld. Trauma which occurs in such instances is\nnot the accidental result of political developments but derives from violence strategically\nand purposively employed by state institutions in order to maintain economic and politi-\ncal power and crush the communicative sphere of the lifeworld where individuals should\nbe able to engage in uncoerced political deliberation and decision-making. Such violent\nemployment of strategic rationality breaks individual assumptive worlds and shatters the\npossibility of social and political flourishing (the potential of which we saw during the\n25 January revolution). Habermas' colonisation theory offers a critical lens on these\ndynamics of power and its destructive impact on the lifeworld, which underpins our\nsense of self and social relations to others (Habermas, 1987).\nColonisation is a key concept in Habermas' theory that links two other central con-\ncepts of the `system' and the `lifeworld', `characterising the nature of the relationship\nbetween them in advanced capitalist (and for the most part Western) societies'(Edwards,\n2007: 112). The conflict Habermas identifies is over the `growth of the `system' (the\nstate and its associated bureaucratic power plus the economy and its associated money\nand market logic) and the ways in which it increasingly impinges upon everyday life\n(Edwards, 2007: 112). Habermas argues that the system operates according to calculative\ngoal-oriented instrumental reason, whereas the lifeworld is the realm where we come to\nunderstanding and is underpinned by communicative reason. The lifeworld entails the\ninterpretative horizon against which we come to an understanding of our own identity\n(the subjective world), of others and social norms (the intersubjective world) and of the\nexternal world (the objective world) (Habermas, 1987: 120). It comprises the taken-for-\ngranted background assumptions into which we have been socialised and orients us in\nour daily affairs. The lifeworld is constituted by an objective stock of cultural knowledge\n(or tradition), the sphere of social integration comprising institutionalised\nsocial memberships and the sphere of socialisation forming one's personal identity in\nintersubjective relations with others. Habermas' colonisation thesis explains that while\nthe system of economic power and political administration is grounded in the lifeworld,\nits steering mechanisms have increasingly become uncoupled from communicative vali-\ndation and intrude on the realms of culture, social integration and socialisation, leaving\na range of pathologies in its wake. Within the cultural sphere, it leads to a breakdown of\nmeaning as the taken-for-granted stock of knowledge is destroyed. Within the social\nsphere, it results in anomie: a breakdown of social bonds, a tearing of social identity and\na fragmentation of social values. In the personal sphere of socialisation, it destroys one's\nidentity, giving rise to mental illnesses, feelings of helplessness and alienation, as well as\nThe aim of Habermas' colonisation argument was to describe processes of alienation\nand reification within Western societies which, though violent, were perhaps less typi-\nfied by direct physical force than the Egyptian counter-revolution. Yet, as Gemma\nEdwards (2007) has argued, `colonization needs to be brought out of the realm of abstract\ntheory and made sense of in terms of actual issues and policies affective actual struggles'\n(2007: 113). Counterbalancing this tendency towards abstraction, we contend that colo-\nnisation is a productive lens for analysing the calculative and strategic logic underlying\nthe violent actions of repressive regimes such as Egypt's because what is at stake is the\nactive and deliberate closing down of communicative processes of (potential) validation\nthrough the violent pursuit of instrumental reason. By shedding light on this logic, the\ntheory of colonisation enables us to perceive the political dimension of the trauma expe-\nrienced by Egyptian activists and the disastrous effects of the violent destruction of the\npublic sphere on the interconnected personal, social and political realms. It enables us to\nunderstand the multi-layered nature of the trauma experienced as the counter-revolution-\nary forces violently betrayed the popular and deliberative aspirations for an inclusive\npublic political sphere articulated during the 25 January revolution. These hopes centred\naround socio-economic improvements, increased political freedoms and physical and\nmental integrity, as encapsulated by the call for `aish, hurriya, idala iqtemaya' (bread,\nfreedom and social justice), which are the primary conditions of being full participants in\ndialogue (see Fraser, 2010). Instead of striving towards an inclusive public sphere, the\ncounter-revolutionary actors destroyed these hopes through extreme physical violence,\nharsh social polarisation, repressive laws and exclusionary backhand deals that closed\npublic space and the potential for a transformed public sphere. They thus engaged in\nwhat Habermas calls concealed strategic action (1984: 333): they operated behind the\nbacks of other (revolutionary) actors, and their instrumental orientation towards their\nstrategic success was not open for deliberation by those affected. Their violent instru-\nmental pursuit of political power and neoliberal economic interests inflicted three levels\nof interconnected trauma \u00ad individual, social and political \u00ad which resulted in feelings of\nhelplessness, isolation, alienation, anomie and demoralisation.\nTracing trauma in Egypt\nIn what follows, we provide empirical insights into individual, social and political trauma\nas related by interviewees. Forty young Caireen activists between the age of 18 and\n2014. Through one of the author's close personal connections, participants were selected\nby snowball sampling and interviewed using a life-story testimonial approach (also see\nMatthies-Boon, 2017). The life-story approach was chosen because the personal narra-\ntive has analytical priority over any pre-determined interview questions, allowing for\nmultifaceted and contradictory reactions as the interviewee is free to elaborate on his or\nher experiences at length (Benezir, 2009). This approach enables the researcher to pay\nattention to subtle trauma markers such as silences, body movements, emotional expres-\nsions and change of tone (Benezir, 2009), which helps avoid re-traumatisation and ena-\nbles trauma-sensitive interviewing techniques (see Liamputtong, 2007). It should be\nnoted that interviewees were not selected on the basis of `having experienced trauma'but\nrather on being politically active in a broad sense, ranging from participation in protests\nand informal neighbourhood cooperatives to involvement in non-governmental organi-\nsations (NGOs) and political parties. The interviewees covered a range of political per-\nspectives (from Islamist \u00ad both Ikhwan and Salafist \u00ad to liberal and socialist) as well as\na range of religious perspectives (including practicing and non-practicing Muslims,\nCoptic and Evangelical Christians, agnostics and atheists). All interviews were\nanonymised using randomly assigned numbers and securely stored, notes were taken in\nDutch shorthand, and respondents were clearly instructed to avoid mentioning names,\nplaces and any other information that might identify them. The author conducting the\nfieldwork also explained that the interviews would be treated as confidential, and any\npart of the interview cited in publications would not identify individuals (Matthies-Boon,\nRespondents described multi-layered trauma during the rule of former President\nHosni Mubarak as well as during three distinct post-revolutionary phases: the interim\nrule of the Supreme Council ofArmed Forces (2011\u00ad2012) after the downfall of Mubarak\nin February 2011, the period under the elected Muslim Brotherhood President Mohammed\n(2013\u00ad2015; ongoing). Interviewees described how all these different regimes engaged\nin similar tactics of traumatisation: namely, the breaking of individual bodies and minds\nthrough physical violence, the destruction of social relations through atomisation and the\nclosing off of political space through demonisation, backhand deals and concealed politi-\ncal practice. In what follows, we demonstrate that these multiple forms of trauma were\nintegral to securing the regimes' pursuit of political and economic power.\nTrauma in Mubarak's Egypt\nRespondents narrated how they suffered at the hands of the brutal police state under\nMubarak. They relayed how the security apparatus would break individual bodies\nthrough torture, imprisonment and sexual assault with impunity. They noted the random-\nness with which ordinary citizens \u00ad including children \u00ad would be detained and how the\nsecurity services particularly abused citizens in the lower classes who lived in poorer\nneighbourhoods and did not have political connections that would protect them. Their\nnarratives closely correspond to Salwa Ismail's (2011, 2012) ethnographic studies on the\nsocial impacts of the Egyptian security state and illustrate the connection between\nindividual experiences of (the threat of) grave physical abuse and social fragmentation.\nNot only did (the threat of) physical violence at the hands of the state instil a fear that one\ncould be physically and mentally crushed at any moment, but fear and suspicion also\nspread throughout society as a result of the wide network of informers that might include\none's family, friends, teachers, local shop owners and microbus drivers (also see Ismail,\n2011, 2012). The constant threat inhibited any potential for a sense of social solidarity as\nit ensured that no one would get any `political ideas' that might threaten the regime's\npolitical and economic interests. In the words of this young man,\nthere was a lot of fear, and you cannot express yourself because you fear everyone around you.\nYou know that we have a very strong intelligence security and you are expecting all the time\nthat you speak that this guy or this woman is going to inform about you \u00ad and stuff like this. So\nwe were suspicious, we were all the time trying to be on the fence, not taking one side.\nKandil, 2012), although formed under the socialist regime of Abdel Nasser, the intensi-\nfication of the police security state was inherently tied to the neoliberalisation of the\nEgyptian economy (since the time of Anwar Sadat) and the need to repress any potential\nunrest resulting from growing socio-economic grievances. The security state was there-\nfore profoundly imbricated in the maintenance of Egypt's corrupt business-political elite\nand its socio-economic policies that forced individualised struggles for survival and frag-\nmented social relations. The majority of Egyptians were deprived of education and health\ncare, subjected to (terrible) informal employment opportunities and living in substandard\ninformal housing, including graveyard settlements such as the Cities of the Dead. As this\nperson remarked,\nUnder Mubarak's rule only 3 or maybe 4 cities in Egypt have been developed, whilst the rest of\nthe country has not seen any major investment by the government. People are left to rot and\nsurvive in the informal economic sectors. All Mubarak did was to secure his own people, and\nplay us out against one another. (Interview 38)\nRespondents explained how the harsh brutality of social deprivation and the daily\nstruggle for survival were not only individually traumatic in that it destroyed people's\nphysical and mental wellbeing but were also socially and politically traumatic in that it\nisolated people and destroyed the possibility of a political voice:\nWhat we were living in is not normal ... All the time I was feeling that I have no meaning to\nlive in this country, I have no role I mean. I did not belong to it. Things happen and my opinion\ndoes not matter to anyone. Whatever you think and whatever you believe, no one cares about\nit. It does not matter. Things just go as the security and the politicians want it to go. And for sure\nthis feeling makes you feel as if you are a foreigner in this country. Although you were born in\nthis country, you at the same time find yourself totally separated from it. You are not integrated\n[...] And if you would also consider that going to a police station for example, just entering a\npolice station, and you feel that you are accused and you are meaningless to the people, and you\nfeel that whatever you are, you can be humiliated. For me this is a kind of political violence.\nThe language of social alienation, as well as humiliation, despair, vulnerability and\nanger, abounds within these interviews. It became clear that the individual and social\ntraumas experienced were a direct consequence of the Mubarak regime's instrumental\ndesire to break the political potential of its subjects, as a result of which people retreated\nfrom the public sphere:\nbefore the revolution, you ... even did not dare to speak about politics. You only spoke about\npolitics like a meaningless thing for any people. You spoke about it as a meaningless thing for\nany people ... They would never express their true feelings about what is happening, just\naccepting what is happening, and they know what will happen and they know that the regime\nis much much stronger than them to change anything so when they spoke about politics it does\nnot really matter to them. They are not interested in expressing their own personal opinions or\nfight based on their beliefs, no not at all. [...]. Yaeny,2 people preferred to speak about football,\nabout private things, about the female and sex but not about politics in general. (Interview 32)\nThe structural injustices suffered under Mubarak's rule represent forms of traumatic\nbetrayal that were enacted on individual, social and political levels. These structural\ntraumas embody the definition of CTS, namely that those political actors that should\noffer protection from random, life-threatening, traumatic violence (i.e. the police, politi-\ncians and judiciary) were its main perpetrators in an atmosphere of systemic corruption,\nimmunity and unaccountability (Straker, 2013). Under this regime, any hope for political\nchange was violently crushed by the security services and their networks of informants.\nCoupled with a corrupt judiciary and political unaccountability, the result was a culture\nof fear that depoliticised Egypt's public and private spheres and ensured that the regime\nmaintained political and economic power.\nInterregnum: The revolutionary lifeworld\nSuch colonisation of the lifeworld is never completely able to crush the potential\nfor creative social becoming. In Egypt, the opportunity to rise up came in January\n2011, after the violent murder of Khaled Said,3 years of small-scale and heavily\nsecuritised protests by underground social movements and the Tunisian uprising.\nActivists relayed that while they initially hesitated to participate in demonstrations\nout of fear of the security services, they gradually overcame their feelings of fear\nand suspicion as the protests gained momentum. They explained how they were\ndrawn out of their isolation and into new forms of personal and political solidarity\nwith people around them. As this young man remarked, this new solidarity gave rise\nto a sense of hope:\nI had a very weird feeling I never felt this in my life. I had this massive gratitude for the\nEgyptian people, and I really appreciated how we can get together and protect each other\nagainst anything that might harm us ... At this phase I had a lot of faith in us, in the Egyptian\npeople ... That all that we want will be achieved, that people will not live in poverty anymore.\nPeople will not take police brutality anymore. That people will not take the marginalisation and\ninjustice anymore .... We would be a society that respects minorities, that respects everybody.\nWhile the days of the revolution experienced the violent response of the regime's\nCentral Security Forces (CSF), reaching its peak during the Battle of the Camels on 2\nFebruary 2011, for many the sense of social unity with those around them set this period\napart as they shared in a collective expression of the traumatic hardships faced. As this\nyoung person recalls,\nI was so high and yet I was so scared, I will never forget my feelings the first time I hear in the\nsquare people shouting `ishab urid isqat al nizam'. It was like all my inside was shaking. I was\nnot feeling like myself. It was so strong, so clear, so loud. Really felt that something new\nhappened. And yaeny, suddenly I did not see the same people. I was seeing a new Egypt.\nSuddenly I feel new hope coming. Suddenly I feel like ... a massive strength inside me, a\nmassive power, willing of change. During the 28th, I was violent during that day though. [...] I\ndid not have fear seeing other people been shot and have then been thrown with teargas and\nbullets around you. Seeing how they insist to continue. They want to go, they keep going and\nthey are so strong, just catching the tear gas and throwing it back to the police. I was one of\nthem, yaeny. I was totally with them. And I was feeling a huge anger inside me, a huge anger\ninside me. [...] it was not anger against the poor policeman or the poor soldier who did not\nunderstand anything but I was throwing my stone at all the depression I had suffered through\nmy life. Towards all, yaeny, all unappreciation, a lack of dignity. Yes ... (Interview 32)\nInterviewees particularly remarked how the 18 days opened a new collective and\ncommunicative space in which they openly and publicly discussed politics, even with\nthose who held very different views. They saw the possibility of the formation of an\ninclusive Egyptian public sphere where people related to each other equally regardless of\nsocial standing, economic background, religious beliefs or political orientation. An alter-\nnative lifeworld was thus created wherein each person was deemed valuable and equal\nparticipants in the fight against the regime. There was toleration of and respect for differ-\nences, the emergence of inclusive and horizontal communicative relations, and a sense\nof human dignity, as this young woman noted:\nYou see the Salafist person sit next to the most liberal person. You know, I don't know if that\nwould ever happen again. But it was very heart-warming. You see the poor classes with the\ncr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me and you see them sitting together enjoying a civil conversation and it was\nbeautiful and so simple .... I think we need to restore that, you know something that actually\nbrings us all together. You know, we need to attach to the human values. (Interview 10)\nInterviewees noted that this was the first time they felt that they belonged to their\ncountry and felt `Egyptian'. All the respondents look back on the 18 days of the revolu-\ntion as a period of happiness, communicative openness and hope as they saw a glimpse\nof a different future. They described the determination for change, the fearless and bodily\nexpression of anger and selflessness by those around them as overarching characteristics\nof the revolution, and how this renewed sense of identity, solidarity and political com-\nmunity derived from their collective desire to throw off the chains of political, social and\neconomic repression experienced under Mubarak. And so, while the regime's CSF still\nresponded violently \u00ad with extensive gunfire, knife attacks, setting tents ablaze and\nthrowing concrete blocks from the top of buildings onto protestors \u00ad the burden of trauma\nwas no longer individualised. A new communicative space had opened, albeit temporar-\nily, nurturing a different kind of lifeworld of connection, solidarity and equality, in which\npeople spoke truth to power.\nThe military's political and economic interests were threatened by the possible suc-\ncession of Mubarak by his son, Gamal Mubarak. As a result of Hosni Mubarak's coup-\nproofing tactics, the military's political influence had rapidly declined (see Kandil,\n2012). Their suggestions for ministerial appointments were increasingly ignored in\nfavour of a new crony capitalist business elite (Arafat, 2017). Gamal Mubarak was a\nleader of this new elite and was planning to further reduce the military's political power\nand its economic assets. The military held large swathes of industry and businesses\nacross Egyptian society for which it used conscripted labour. Not only was this free sup-\nply of labour under threat, there were also plans to sell off their assets to this new busi-\nness elite. Hence, `the military's alignment with the protesters [during the 18days] was\nmore likely linked to a desire for self-preservation and a fear of weakened influence or\npower than a matter of ethical responsibility' (Arafat, 2017: 53).\nCounter-revolution and the Supreme Council of Armed Forces' interim\nregime\nAs soon as the Supreme Council of Armed Forces (SCAF) took over, there was a con-\ncerted effort by the military regime to crush the potential of the collective uprising and\nmaintain its political and economic privileges. The regime understood that in order to\nrepress political potential, it had to break not only bodies but also the collective soli-\ndarity which had emerged through closing down the public political sphere and the (re)\nestablishment of fear. During this period, at least 12,000 civilians were sent to military\ntrials, protests and sit-ins were violently dispersed (resulting in many deaths and inju-\nries), protestors (male and female) were systematically tortured and raped by the army\nand the security services, journalists were arbitrarily arrested and children were\ndetained and tortured by army officers (Human Rights Watch, 2014). Moreover, the\nmilitary regime sought to polarise social relations and exclude protesters from the\nlegitimate public sphere by depicting them as thugs, prostitutes, foreign spies, crimi-\nnals and unruly thugs on state television. They (strategically) insisted that with the\nremoval of Mubarak the revolution was over and that it was time to reinstate `stability'\nand `security'.\nThe regime conducted notorious virginity trials during which they tested the virginity\nof detained female protestors so that `the military could not be charged with rape by these\nwomen and girls'. They also organised gang rapes by balatagiya (state hired thugs) and\nplain-clothed intelligence officers. Such sexual violence is a particularly effective tool\nfor closing down the public sphere, since it not only breaks an individual's sense of self\nand trust in social relations but also instils fear into others. As this young woman\ncommented,\nyou know that you are looking around you the whole time and you don't want to be the kind of\nnegative woman who would be like `ok I will stay at home until harassment ends'. I would not\ndo that but then it makes it really hard for you to be in that public space again. (Interview 28)\nSevere sexual violence was also systematically inflicted on men, who were raped in\ndetention by the military and the police. This young man was raped by the army during\nWe went to protest and it was the second time I was put in jail because of protest. The army ...\nget us under the bridge after they caught us, our eyes are covered, our hands are tied on our back\n... and ... eh ... yeany ... It was the first time that I was feeling ... [He sighs. There are tears in\nhis eyes] ... That someone can break me, I did not have this feeling before. I felt like I was\nnothing ... eh ... when we was with the prison of the army they electrocuted us, they burnt us,\nhit us under our feet, and I was one of the last people who received the beating ... yeany ...\nSome person, I did not meet him again, it was ... eh ... he ... do you know the sound of a\nwoman who is pregnant with a baby and gives birth and screams? He was screaming like her\n... because of ... some son of a bitch ... soldier ... was fucking him. So ... like ... him ...\n[breathing heavily and crying now] ... after the fourth day, or something like this, when they\nfound that we did not do nothing they let us free. But ... eh ... something inside of me was\nbroken. (Interview 12)\nThe socially alienating effect is particularly severe with male rape since it is highly\nstigmatised, underpinned by a popular belief that the one `receiving the rape' is passive\nand thus `feminised', whereas the active person remains masculine. Furthermore, within\nEgyptian law, only female vaginal rape by someone other than her husband counts as\nrape, and thus, such experiences cannot even be addressed within Egypt's legal system.4\nSuch experiences of sexual torture thus physically and psychologically break one's body\nand assumptive world, are socially traumatic in the creation of an (existentially lonely)\nstigmatised other and politically traumatic in that it destroys avenues for political\nmobilisation.\nSexual torture was one of a range of torture techniques used by the military on activ-\nists, including severe beatings with sticks and other sharp objects, burning by cigarettes,\nelectrocution (including genitalia) and stress positions. Interviewees relayed how after\ntheir torture their interpretative horizon had shifted to the extent that they could not relate\nto others around them anymore; they feared that they were radiating negativity towards\nothers and became preoccupied with their own individual death. Hence, we should thus\nunderstand that while torture is a series of violent acts inflicted on an individual's body\nand mind, it has socially traumatic consequences as it erodes a person's trust in their\nsocial relations. The purpose of torture is thus to strategically close down opportunities\nfor political and social transformation and, crucially, to individualise the traumatic bur-\nden of this political act.\nOne young man narrated his torture at the hands of the military in the Egyptian\nWhat happened is that they arrested about 200, about 20 girls and 180 men and tortured us in\nfront of the Egyptian museum outside the garden and the torturing takes about 5hours .... They\ntortured all of us but for me, the case was completely different. After 10minutes, they started\nsmashing my head on a column, then they take off my clothes except underwear and then tied\na rope on my leg and they pull me to inside the garden and they started the torturing by wooden\nsticks, metal sticks. Some officers jumping a lot on my back on my head, and in the end they\nelectrocuted me, they burnt me \u00ad and they cut my hair with broken glass. And during the\ntorturing they try and use words to break your spirit and to break you inside ... They have no\nmercy, they don't know this word. (Interview 37)\nHe explained that this experience stripped him of his political naivet\u00e9 as he was one\nof the first to see that the military were not the protectors of the revolution but rather\nwere driven only by their own political and economic interests.\nFor many respondents, this realisation came later during the Maspero Massacre of\nCoptic Christians at the hands of the army and following the secret handover deal\nbetween the army and the Muslim Brotherhood around the critical time of the Mohamed\nMahmoud street battles in November 2011. Here, activists realised that their trust in the\nmilitary was misplaced and they felt betrayed as the military engaged in concealed stra-\ntegic actions to secure their political position. As this person notes,\nat the very beginning we trusted the army, we said that the army has taken the right decisions, but\nunfortunately it turned out that maybe the army had bad intentions ... they responded violently to\nlegitimate demands from different groups within the society, including Christians, revolutionaries.\nThey were not keen on a real democratic transition. They were just keen on doing political deals\nwith the more stable group in the society, which is the Muslim Brotherhood. (Interview 7)\nThe November 2011 handover deal between the Muslim Brotherhood and the SCAF\ncentred on early parliamentary elections with presidential elections planned in June\n2012. It was as a result of this deal that the Muslim Brotherhood was able to emerge as\nthe main political party in the parliamentary elections of late 2011 and early 2012. In\nreturn, the military was allowed to safeguard its economic assets and forego parliamen-\ntary oversight of its budget. The military thus (temporarily) forfeited its formal political\npower to a political actor that would preserve its economic status quo. It also provided\nthe appearance of a `formal democratic transition' that satisfied key international actors\nsuch as the United States, International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank while\nensuring that new (and less established) political actors would not have sufficient space\nand time to organise and enter successfully into the formal public sphere. Examining this\ndeal through a Habermasian lens reveals not only that it set the trajectory of Egypt's post-\nrevolutionary developments by closing down `disorderly' communicative spaces but\nalso that there was a logic of instrumental reason at work which ensured that economic\nand political power was restored to repressive and authoritarian actors at the expense of\nthe rights and freedoms of citizens.\nSignificantly, this `formal democratic transition' came at the time of the 6-day\nMohamed Mahmoud street battle in which thousands of protestors fought the army and\nthe CSF leaving at least 40 people dead and more than 3000 injured. For interviewees,\nMohammed Mahmoud was one of the most shocking and traumatic clashes not only due\nto the high level of violence but also because revolutionary solidarity had become\nseverely fragmented. Many were angered at the painful abandonment by the Muslim\nBrotherhood leadership:\nI will never forget and tolerate what the Brotherhood did at that moment ... I can tolerate the\npolice as we expected this of them but never the Brotherhood ... they did not only remain silent\nthey incited against us ... the Brotherhood wasted a historical chance for this country to become\na real democratic country when they had their deals with the SCAF. (Interview 7)\nSuch critical voices also emerged among the youth wing of the Brotherhood, as this\nyoung Brotherhood remarked: `I felt that the revolution was being stolen. We gave the\npower of the revolution to the SCAF which was part of Mubarak ... I felt that the\nIslamists betrayed the movement' (Interview 2). The explicit reference to betrayal by a\nMuslim Brother of his own leadership is testament to the impact that such political\nactions had on individuals and on social relations.\nInterviewees felt betrayed not only by the Muslim Brotherhood but also by what they\ntermed the `Hizb al Kanaba', the non-participants prone to believe the military's tele-\nvised propaganda that depicted protestors as thugs, prostitutes and foreign spies. Due to\nthe historical fights against the British and Israeli colonisers, and the fact that the army is\nformed by layers from all levels of Egyptian society due to forced conscription, the mili-\ntary is a celebrated institution (Arafat, 2017:53) and so its calls for `stability' and `order'\nno longer fell on deaf ears. For many respondents, this set the stage for a re-individuali-\nsation of the traumatic burden as social bonds were ruptured.\nThe handover deal's rapid move towards elections during such a period of intense vio-\nlence along with the demonisation of other political actors by the SCAF represented a viola-\ntion of Habermasian principles of deliberation. It was an active attempt to violently close\ndown newly formed intersubjective communicative spaces in the public sphere. The combi-\nnation of direct physical force, social polarisation and political exclusion was experienced\nby activists as a fundamental betrayal of the revolution. As this young person recalled,\nWhen the elections started, my happiness stopped ... When people started to be political, and\nbe asked to go to the election box and make his choice, it was a very sad moment for me as the\npoliticians were trying to direct people. And they are using misusing words, misusing people's\nreligion and misusing people's dreams and misusing people's needs. (Interview 32)\nActivists narrated how politics became a fragmented terrain of manipulation and con-\ntestation as political actors ignored the demands of the people and sought to instrumen-\ntalise the public sphere for the purposes of securing and maintaining political and\neconomic power. The inability of alternative political voices to organise and unite within\nthis difficult political environment became particularly apparent not only during the par-\nliamentary elections but also during the later presidential elections in June 2012. During\nthe early presidential elections which were part of the handover deal, the absence of\nagreement and organisational capacity fragmented the revolutionary votes, leading to a\nrun-off between the Muslim Brotherhood candidate Mohammed Morsi and ex-NDP\n(National Democratic Party) member Ahmed Shafiq, both candidates belonging to the\npre-revolutionary neoliberal consensus. For many respondents, this was a watershed\nmoment, and one interviewee explained that it was `one of the worst days since January\n25'. Her experience illustrates ways in which the body becomes implicated in and sub-\nject to the structures of power and political betrayal:\nso I am sitting there writing and publishing and then sharing...and my blood pressure is like, it\nis rising very gradually .... And I am sitting there writing like crazy, like really fast really fast\nreally fast. And then my nose starts bleeding because my blood pressure is way too high, and I\nstart crying and became hysterical, and my mum came into the room and was like you okay?\nAnd I was like `What the fuck, I hate this country, I cannot believe they voted for Morsi and\nShafiq. I hate this country. The fuckers. I was really angry. Yeah, it was like a mixture of blood\ncoming out of my nose and like tears and like hysterical cries and it was probably the worst day\nduring the last three years. It was the worst day .... How could they choose these terrible\nterrible candidates? I was devastated. (Interview 30)\nViolence continued: President Morsi's rule and after\nDuring Morsi's rule, physical and mental violence persisted, while social polarisation\nand political exclusion rule further increased, even resulting in civilian violence in both\npublic and private spaces. The Muslim Brotherhood, it should be noted, is an established\nactor within the Egyptian political landscape so that despite its repression under Mubarak\nit was able to emerge as a solid economic actor. It became particularly influential in syn-\ndicates, universities and economic enterprise, leading to what some call `pious neoliber-\nalism' (Atia, 2013). Its leadership comprises large business networks and tycoons (such\nas Khairat el-Shater) that promising economic security to the military was also actively\nadvancing their own neoliberal economic agenda through deals with Qatari investors as\nwell as international institutions such as the IMF. Interviewees remarked that in pursuing\nneoliberal entrepreneurial economic policies under an Islamic veneer, the Brotherhood\nnot only failed to address the socio-economic inequalities underpinning the revolution\nbut also restricted public space. As this young activist remarked, `They wanted to ...\ndominate all positions in the state. They ... didn't really believe in pluralism ... They\ndidn't even believe in dialogue \u00ad a real national dialogue with the opposition' (Interview\n13). Revealing the logic of instrumental reason and strategic action at work, one inter-\nviewee said of the choice that the Muslim Brotherhood made when they came to power:\nThey basically understood that the Mubarak regime is still powerful, they still have a lot of\nmoney, and networks of power and circles of power. So instead of trying to unite, with like you\nknow the youth groups to try and dismantle the Mubarak regime, they decided to unite with the\nMubarak regime to dismantle the youth groups and the revolutionaries. (Interview 8)\nDuring the Brotherhood's rule, torture was no longer confined to police cells and mili-\ntary detention places but was carried out by Muslim Brother vigilantes in public spaces\nincluding mosques and street corners (Al Nadeem, 2013; Al-Aswany, 2013). This `nor-\nmalisation' of torture contributed to multiple levels of trauma through the shattering of\nexpectations of safety and security in the social and political public sphere. Reflecting\nthe traumatic betrayal embodied in these actions, one interviewee stated that it\nwas a bit of shock, because we were used to the policemen doing torture, the army doing torture\n... the politicians doing torture like military police also for intelligence or whatever but for\nnormal people like here in the streets torturing people who they think are thugs or whatever,\ndifferent from them, dehumanising people by other people is really shocking. (Interview 22)\nMany interviewees explained they became scared as the Brotherhood actively\nexcluded other political actors from the public sphere and issued laws which sought to\nimpose a particularly Islamist vision of identity without regard for internal Egyptian dif-\nferences. After Morsi issued a presidential degree in which he granted himself immunity\nfrom any legal challenge \u00ad thus closing the last avenue for public accountability \u00ad and\ncalled for a referendum on what many perceived to be an overly Islamist draft of a new\nconstitution, the presidential palace clashes broke out which lasted for 2\nrespondents, these clashes deepened their experience of social and political traumatisa-\ntion since civilians were no longer just fighting state security forces but each other as\nviolence took on sectarian forms:\nI'm always used to conflict and violence from the police, from the army, but what I saw around\nthe palace in December 2012 was traumatic, shocking, so ehm ... I mean I ... It is very hard to\nsee one of your friends, or those who used to be your friends...I won't say that they are shooting\nus or anything like that because very few of them were using weapons, but almost every one of\nthem was throwing stones, being violent with us ... so imagine that anyone of them could be\nyour friend, your neighbour, your brother even. And what made me more shocked that I ... I\nalways used to be a pacifist, peaceful ...After the Islamists were attacking us, I started attacking\nback, throwing stones back and I was shocked at my reaction afterwards. I went back home,\nwondering how I did that. (Interview 1)\nThese clashes were traumatic not only because of the level of violence but also\nbecause it tore Egyptian society apart. People who used to be friends, colleagues and\nfamily members now openly fought each other as relations were polarised along anti-\nand pro-Brotherhood lines. Many interviewees had at least one close family member or\nlong-standing friend who belonged to the `other'side and with whom they now fought or\nhad broken off relations. These tensions came to a head during the summer of 2013 when\nMorsi was deposed by the military after the Tamarod (Rebellion) campaign led by a\nNasserist and Old Regime (pro-military) alliance successfully mobilised large sections\nof Egyptian society to demonstrate on 30 June. It would be inaccurate, however, to inter-\npret this demonstration as the representation of a new inclusive public sphere. As one\nrespondent put it, it was the lack of idealism \u00ad or hope for substantive change \u00ad that set\nThey called against Morsi, they didn't call for anything. And January 25th for me is all about\ncalls for freedom, for all these ... chants that we had. So I fear that all our accomplishments are\nrolled back, already public space has been taken away from us. (Interview 17)\nIndeed, it turned out that these demonstrations had been largely coordinated and sup-\nported by the Egyptian security services who were keen on retaining their political inter-\nests as they had been dismayed by the \"Brotherhoodisation\" of Egyptian politics.\nEgypt's political public sphere was further compromised on 14August when the secu-\nrity services raided the Muslim Brotherhood sit-ins of Rabaa and Ennahda. During the\nviolent dispersal, the security services killed over 817 Muslim Brotherhood supporters,\nand many more were injured. The traumatic effects were apparent for all those who had\neither been present or who had lost family or friends during these massacres. For exam-\nple, one young woman narrated how the collected bodies inside the mosques were cov-\nered with blocks of ice as it was over 40\u00b0C, and she remains haunted by the vision and\nsmell of wading through a thick layer of blood mixed with ice water as she was trying to\nhelp relatives to find their loved ones. Another young man described how his cousin was\nparalysed as a result of his injuries but has not been able to get hospital treatment due to\nfear of his immediate arrest or immediate execution by security services. Others relayed\nhow they were nearly shot at Rabaa and lost relatives and friends as the gunfire sur-\nrounded them and how they feared they were going to die too. They explained how, in\nthe wake of the Rabaa massacre, heated arguments to the point of physical violence,\nsometimes even to the point of death, became pervasive inside homes and in public\nplaces. They narrated how they experienced existential loneliness and feelings of perva-\nsive violence and radical insecurity and how this led to depression and anxiety that cul-\nminated in their social isolation and political withdrawal from the public sphere (see\nThe Rabaa massacre was a decisive blow to the revolutionary lifeworld by the mili-\ntary and the Egyptian security services since it completed the counter-revolutionary\ncolonisation of the lifeworld. As El Sherif argued,\nThe army is expanding its economic empire, crowding out the public and private sectors. The\nmilitary has become an even more privileged economic actor. It is not taxed, it is not subject to\ncompetition, it [still] uses free conscript labor, and it monopolizes public land and other public\nresources \u00ad all with no public oversight. (El Sherif, 2017)\nAs one young activists pointed out, the fight changed into one `between two major dic-\ntatorships over power, not over the revolution and really changing what is happening'\n(Interview 32). Interviewees became depoliticised as the public sphere closed and they\nfelt stuck between the two authoritarian blocks of the military and the Brotherhood. The\nwords of one interviewee succinctly sum up our argument regarding the relationship\nbetween the failure of the revolution and the role of instrumental reason driving strategic\naction by the Muslim Brotherhood and the military:\nBecause the issue [is] that you still have a strong interested group, which is the deep state. Even\nafter Mubarak stepped down you have the military junta in power, you have Morsi. So having\nthe Brotherhood out of the system now doesn't mean that there is going to be more democracy.\nNo that's still the same, that's still the deep state, the military and the intelligence interest-\nnetwork. They want to dominate the political, social and economic scene again you know.\nConclusion\nTrauma is not limited to individually felt experiences of violence or to social ruptures\nconstituted through sudden, radical change. Rather, as the testimonies of Egyptian activ-\nists have demonstrated, trauma can be understood as a multi-layered, politically medi-\nated experience. Habermas' distinction between instrumental and communicative reason\nhelps make sense of the different yet interconnected layers of traumatisation in Egypt.\nHis corresponding recognition of instrumental and strategic action enabled an identifica-\ntion of the role played by political and economic forces in the experience of Egyptian\nactivists. In order to contain the revolutionary threat, counter-revolutionary state actors\nhad to `break the people' and their social embeddedness so as to preserve their political\nand economic interests. Thus, we argue that Habermas' systemic and social approaches\nare important for understanding trauma because they offer insights into the dynamics of\npower and their distorting impacts on the lifeworld as well as how these shaped traumatic\nbetrayals of normative expectations in the individual, social and political realms. By\nlocating trauma in interconnected spheres, we also hope to shed light on the lived experi-\nences of activists for activists, thereby providing tools through our analysis to make\nsense of the different layers of traumatisation in Egypt.\nNotes\n1. We employ Habermas' counterfactual term the public sphere as the realm of (institutional-\nised) public deliberation which in authoritarian contexts is limited, hampered and indeed\ndeformed due to its colonisation by repressive political actors in instrumental pursuit of politi-\ncal and economic power.\n2. Yaeny is an interjection common in spokenArabic, the meanings of which range from `I mean\n...' to `like' and `ehm'. We decided to maintain the original Arabic term as it provides insight\ninto the intonation of particular expressions and sentences to regional specialists.\n3. A young middle-class male who was beaten to death in an Internet caf\u00e9 in Alexandria and\nwhose pictures spread across social media arousing collective anger.\n4. As explained in Matthies-Boon (2017): Article 267 of Egypt's penal code criminalises vagi-\nnal penetration without consent but article 60 of the penal code overrides the application of\nthe penal code on those who committed a criminalised act out of `good intention', and the\nmarriage certificate provides sufficient proof in the Egyptian judicial system that the man did\nnot intend any harm to his wife. Rape is restricted to the penetration of female genitalia, since\nthis is the highest violation of `honour', and male anal penetration is merely a case of indecent\nassault, making male rape legally impossible (see Egypt Penal Code 1973; information also\nbased on personal communication with an anonymised Egyptian lawyer (19 January 2017))\nReferences\nAl-Aswany A (2013) Torture Reveals True Nature of Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood, Al Monitor,\nAl Nadeem (2013) Torture in Egypt during a year of Muslim Brotherhood rule.
