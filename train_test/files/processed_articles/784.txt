The authors examined factors associated with the food insecurity of elderly persons in the United\nStates and particularly how functional impairments were associated with food insecurity.\nMethods. Data were from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988\u00ad94) and the Nutri-\ntion Survey of the Elderly in New York State (1994). The authors used multiple logistic regression and a hierarchical lo-\ngistic regression analyses to examine how functional impairments as well as sociodemographic and economic factors\ncontributed to food insecurity in elderly persons.\nResults. Low income, low education, minority status, food assistance program participation, and social isolation\nwere significantly related with food insecurity. Functional impairments were significantly related with food insecurity\namong elderly persons even after those factors were controlled.\nDiscussion. Food security in elderly persons is associated with functional impairments, suggesting that food insecu-\nrity in elderly persons comprises not only limited food affordability, availability, and accessibility but also altered food\nuse. Food-insecure elderly persons experience multiple problems that prevent them from achieving nutritional well-being\nand seeking food assistance programs. Nutrition services should recognize and provide services to cover those needs.\nUNGER and food insecurity are a persistent problem\nin the United States (Alaimo, Briefel, Frongillo, & Ol-\nBickel, 1999; President's Task Force in Food Assistance,\nfood insecurity to poor nutritional and health status, as well\nas the ethical unacceptability of its presence within our soci-\nety, has drawn significant efforts to understand the nature,\nextent, and prevention of food insecurity in the past decade\nin the development of the first national food insecurity and\nhunger module in the Current Population Survey (CPS),\nwhich researchers designed to further understand and moni-\ntor food insecurity in the United States (Rose, 1999).\nOne gap in current understanding is the nature of food in-\nsecurity among elderly persons, whose number and propor-\ntion will dramatically increase through the 21st century.\nMost widely accepted definitions and measures of food in-\nsecurity in the United States are from research on younger\nadults and children. The concept of food insecurity is\nmainly focused on limited or uncertain food affordability,\naccessibility, and availability due to lack of resources. Pre-\nvious research showed that food insecurity is related to so-\nciodemographic and economic conditions that limit the\nhousehold resources available for food acquisition (Alaimo\nThe current concept of food insecurity has not taken into\naccount limited or uncertain food use, which has an impor-\ntant relevance in elderly persons because their functional im-\npairments and health problems alter ability to use food. Abil-\nity to use food is the ability to prepare, gain access to, and eat\nfood that is available in the household. Ability to use food is\nnot the only--but is an essential--component in maintaining\nadequate food use in elderly persons, which includes ways in\nwhich individuals prepare foods and combine foods into\ndishes, meals, and meal patterns (Quandt, Arcury, & Bell,\nAlthough accurate characterization of food-insecure el-\nderly persons has only recently begun, previous research\nfound that functional impairments, health problems, and lack\nof social support have significant relationships with food in-\nsecurity (Burt, 1993; Frongillo, Rauschenbach, Roe, & Wil-\nliamson, 1992; New York State Department of Health and\nWolfe, Olson, Kendall, & Frongillo, 1996). These studies\nsuggest that the concept of food insecurity in elderly persons\nmay include altered food use (i.e., inability to use food) due\nto functional impairments and health problems, as well as in-\nadequate availability, affordability, and accessibility of food.\nIn this study we examined factors associated with food\ninsecurity in elderly persons and particularly how factors re-\nlated to altered food use, as well as inadequate food afford-\nability, availability, and accessibility, contribute to food in-\nsecurity among U.S. elderly persons. We hypothesized that\nfunctional impairments were associated with food insecu-\nrity independent of other sociodemographic and economic\nfactors. We used multivariate analysis with nationally and\nstate representative samples from the Third National Health\nH\nand the Nutrition Survey of the Elderly in New York State\n(NSENY, 1994). The results will provide a better under-\nstanding of food insecurity among elderly persons, foster\ndiscussion for better measurement of food insecurity, and\nprovide information to improve nutrition services to reduce\nfood insecurity in elderly persons.\nMETHODS\nData and Study Sample\nNHANES III.--Elderly persons aged 60\u00ad90 years (N \n6,596) were sampled in NHANES III. The survey was de-\nsigned to obtain nationally representative information on\nhealth and nutritional status in the U.S. population. Specifi-\ncally, NHANES III included aged and very old persons and\nused a home examination to provide reliable estimates in\nolder persons for the first time (McDowell, Harris, &\nBriefel, 1991). More detailed information on the survey de-\nsign and operation is published elsewhere (U.S. Department\nof Health and Human Services, National Center for Health\nThe analytic sample included all individuals who had com-\nplete information on food insufficiency, health problems,\nphysical functioning, sociodemographic, and economic vari-\nables that are described below. Because of missing informa-\ntion on food insufficiency, 38 individuals were excluded.\nNSENY.--Data were taken from elderly persons aged\nmental survey to the NSENY. The NSENY was intended to\nobtain information to improve the effectiveness of services\nprovided by the Elderly Nutrition Program (ENP) in New\nYork State. New York State elderly persons have character-\nistics that mirror the heterogeneity of the U.S. population\n(Frongillo, Williamson, Roe, & Scholes, 1987). A strength\nof the NSENY is its inclusion of a wide range of data, such\nas sociodemographic characteristics, nutritional screening,\nfood insecurity, and functional impairment variables. More\ndetailed information of the survey design, operation, and\nquestionnaire has been published elsewhere (New York\nState Department of Health and Office for the Aging, 1996).\nThe analytic sample included all individuals who had com-\nplete information on food insecurity, nutritional risk, eligi-\nbility for a home-delivered meal program, and potential\ncontrolling variables that are described in the following sec-\ntions. Of the 484 elderly persons whose food insecurity data\nwere available, 406 had complete data and were included in\nthe final analysis.\nDependent Variable--Food Insecurity\nIn NHANES III, we used the family food insufficiency\nquestion to determine food insecurity status. The question\non family food insufficiency, defined as \"an inadequate\namount of food intake due to lack of resources,\" asked \"Do\nyou have enough food to eat, sometimes not enough to eat,\nor often not enough to eat?\" (Briefel & Woteki, 1992). An\nelderly person was classified as food insecure if he or she\nreported positively to \"sometimes or often did not get\nenough food to eat,\" a convention that has been adopted in\nother research on this topic. This question has undergone\ncognitive testing and it has been shown to be valid, and it\nhas also been demonstrated to be associated with food ex-\npenditures and reduced nutrient and food group intake,\nmostly in younger adults (Alaimo et al., 1998; Alaimo, Ol-\nOlson, Kendall, & Colmenares, 1997; Rose & Oliveira,\nIn NSENY, we used a three-item food insecurity mea-\nsurement to decide food insecurity status during the last 6\nmonths. Questions were, \"Do you have enough money to\nbuy the food you need most of the time?\" \"Have you\nskipped one or more meals because you had no food in the\nhouse or you thought that soon you might not have enough\nfood?\" \"Have you had to choose between buying food or\npaying bills or buying something else you needed?\" Content\nvalidity of the items was established by previous research in\nintensive pretests of the instruments in various rural and ur-\nban settings. These items were associated with low income,\nfood assistance program participation, race-ethnicity, and\nperson was classified as food insecure if he or she reported\naffirmative responses to at least one of the three items.\nIndependent Variables\nVariables found to be associated with food insecurity in\nprevious research (e.g., functional impairments, adverse health\nconditions, low income, minority status, low education, and\nfood assistance program participation) were considered as\npotential independent variables contributing to food insecu-\nered variables that might intervene in the relationships be-\ntween functional impairments and food insecurity, such as\nage and adverse health problems. Only variables that were\nknown to be reasonably associated with food insecurity and\nfunctional impairments, available in the data set, and dem-\nonstrated not to result in multicollinearity were chosen as\nindependent variables. Some variables were categorized for\nsimplicity of interpretation or because of restricted distribu-\ntions; in each case, models with either a continuous or cate-\ngorical version of a variable gave similar results.\nPhysical functioning.--Activities of daily living (ADL)\nand instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) have been\nthe most frequently assessed indicators of disability (Kovar\n& Lawton, 1994). NHANES III included four items on ADL\n(dressing, eating, getting in or out of bed, and transferring)\nand two items on nutrition-related IADL (preparing own\nmeals and managing money). NSENY included five items\non ADL (getting in or out of chair/bed, feeding self, getting\ndressed, taking bath/shower, and toileting) and five items on\nIADL (getting around by car, using public transportation,\ndoing light housework, managing money, and taking medi-\ncine). Physical functioning included three categories: no\nproblem (having no difficulty in ADL and IADL), IADL\nproblem (having at least one difficulty in the IADL), and\nADL problem (having at least one difficulty in the ADL).\nChronic disease.--Chronic disease variables were the\npresence of serious health problems (in NSENY) or at least\none of eight self-reported clinically diagnosed diseases that\nare highly prevalent and affect nutritional and health status\namong elderly persons (in NHANES III; arthritis, hyperten-\nsion, health failure, stroke, cataract, cancer, diabetes melli-\ntus, and emphysema). Of those with at least one chronic dis-\nease in NHANES III, about three quarters had either one or\ntwo diseases. Preliminary analysis showed that similar re-\nsults were obtained when we used a chronic disease variable\nas either categorical or continuous.\nSociodemographic and economic variables.--Age was\ndivided into three groups for comparison by decade:\nand older). Race-ethnicity was categorized into three groups\n(non-Hispanic White and others, non-Hispanic Black, and\nHispanic). A three-category indicator of living arrangement\nincluded living with spouse, living with others, and living\nalone. Educational status was broken down into two groups\n(high school graduate or less vs more than high school grad-\nuate). A continuous social support variable included infor-\nmation about how often respondents saw friends or relatives\nper week in NHANES III. A dichotomous social isolation\nvariable included information about whether respondents had\nany friends or relatives to see or talk with at least once each\nweek in NSENY. Location included two categories: metro\nor nonmetro in NHANES III, New York City or non\u00adNew\nYork City in NSENY. Poverty index ratio (PIR), computed\nas the midpoint of the observed family income category in\nhousehold interview divided by the poverty threshold, was\nNSENY. Food assistance program participation indicated\nwhether respondents currently participated in programs\navailable in their community. Programs for which informa-\ntion was available were the Food Stamp Program and ENP\nin NHANES III and ENP in NSENY. In addition, we con-\nstructed dichotomous variables to indicate gender and di-\netary change due to health problems.\nStatistical Analysis\nDescriptive statistics of study population by age and the\nprevalence of food insecurity by each of the independent\nvariables were analyzed. We used multiple logistic regres-\nsion analysis to assess the relationships between food inse-\ncurity and other factors. We used a hierarchical logistic\nregression analysis to test the relative contributions of five\nseparate groups of risk factors (physical functioning, health\nproblems, social supports, sociodemographic, and economic)\nfor food insecurity. Model fit was measured by area under\nthe receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve. The\nROC area is analogous to R2 and ranges between 0.5 and 1.0\n(Frongillo et al., 1992). We conducted the analysis by using\nthe SVY command in STATA (Statacorp, 1997), which\ntakes into account sample weights and the complex survey\neffect adjusting for oversampling, noncoverage, and nonre-\nsponse.\nRESULTS\nWeighted percentages and means for descriptive statistics\nof the study population by three age groups from two data\nsets are presented in Table 1. Of the study population in\nNHANES III, the average age was 70.8 years (SE  0.2),\nTable 1.

Estimates were calculated with NHANES III or NSENY sample weights.\naFor NHANES, less than or equal to 130%; for NSENY, less than or equal to 150%.\n11% were minority. The study sample from NSENY was\nsimilar: Mean age of the study sample was 67.7 years (SE \n20.9% were minority. Almost half of the NSENY respon-\nIADL). One third of them had a low income, less than or\nequal to 150% of PIR. Overall, younger old persons were\nmore likely to live with their spouse and to have higher edu-\ncation, income, and physical functioning than older and old-\nest old persons. Oldest old persons were more likely to be\nWhite, female, living alone, and participating in food assis-\ntance programs.\nTable 1 also shows the prevalence of food insecurity\namong elderly persons by sociodemographic, economic,\nphysical functioning, and health characteristics. Overall,\nmore than 1.7% of the older population in NHANES III\nwere food insecure. Food insecurity was not equally distrib-\nuted across race-ethnicity: Hispanic elderly persons had the\nhighest prevalence of food insecurity and non-Hispanic\nBlack persons were next highest. Poverty was related to the\nprevalence of food insecurity; persons with income less\nthan 50% of PIR had the highest prevalence of food insecu-\nrity. Food insecurity existed, however, even among the\n34.6% whose income was over poverty line. Food assis-\ntance program participants showed a higher prevalence of\nfood insecurity. Functional impairment, particularly ADL\nproblems, increased prevalence of food insecurity, com-\npared with those without physical functioning problems.\nSimilar results were shown in NSENY. The prevalence of\nfood insecurity was higher among low-income, minority,\nfunctionally impaired, and socially isolated elderly persons.\nMultiple logistic regression analysis showed that younger\nage, poverty, minority status, less education, and food assis-\ntance program participation were significantly associated\nwith food insecurity in NHANES III (Table 2). Similarly,\npoverty, minority status, living with others, and social isola-\ntion were significantly associated with food insecurity in\nNSENY. Even after we controlled for these significant fac-\ntors, elderly persons with ADL functional impairments had\nsignificantly increased odds of reporting food insecurity in\nbetween food insecurity and functional impairments was in-\ndependent of other sociodemographic and economic charac-\nteristics.\nA hierarchical logistic regression analysis showed the in-\ndependent effect of five groups of risk factors predicting\nfood insecurity (results not shown). The first model in-\ncluded the physical functioning group only, and the ROC was\nremaining four groups of variables were added in the order\nof health problems, social supports, sociodemographic, and\neconomic groups; the ROC areas were, respectively, 0.61,\nand 0.77 in NSENY. Thus, functional impairments and\nsociodemographic variables made particularly substantial\ncontributions to predicting food insecurity.\nDISCUSSION\nElderly persons possess nutritional and health character-\nistics distinct from people in other age groups, and the\nphenomenon of food insecurity is also distinct in this popu-\nlation. As with other age groups, sociodemographic and\neconomic factors, such as poverty, low education, race-eth-\nnicity, and food program participation, limit the resources\navailable for household food acquisition. Consistent with\nprevious research, older minorities were more likely to be at\nrisk of food insecurity than their nonminority counterparts.\nSpecial attention needs to be paid to older minorities, who\ncomprise a dramatically increasing proportion of elderly\npersons.\nFood insecurity results from more than the constraints of\nfinancial resources in elderly persons, however. Functional\nimpairments had a significant relation with food insecurity,\neven after we controlled for other significant factors. The\nimportance of functional impairments in predicting food in-\nsecurity suggests that the concept of altered food use should\nbe considered a part of food insecurity in elderly persons.\nThe significant risk factors for food insecurity tend to oc-\ncur simultaneously, putting subgroups of elderly persons at\nmuch higher risk of food insecurity. The prevalence of food\ninsecurity among elderly persons with functional impair-\nments in addition to being minority and poor increased from\nTable 2. Odds Ratios of Reporting Food Insecurity\nFrom Multiple Logistic Regression Models for\nIndependent Variable\nOdds\nRatio\nInterval\nOdds\nRatio\nInterval\nPoverty Index Ratio\nLiving in metro or\nFood assistance or\nHaving disease or serious\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey; NSENY  Nutrition Sur-\nvey of the Elderly in New York State; ADL  activities of daily living; IADL \ninstrumental activities of daily living; ENP  elderly nutrition program; NA \nnot applicable.\nThe negative effects of functional impairments on food\ninsecurity can be moderated by the quality and quantity of\nsocial supports elderly persons have, although there has\nbeen equivocal evidence on the buffering effect of social\nsupport for those elderly persons who have functional im-\npairments (Newsom & Schulz, 1996; Unger, McAvay, Bruce,\nBerkman, & Seeman, 1999). Functionally impaired elderly\npersons who have adequate social supports to prepare and\ncook may maintain adequate food use. Elderly persons who\nlive with a spouse or others may compensate for their al-\ntered food use problems compared with those living alone.\nIt is important to take into account social supports in under-\nstanding the effects of functional impairments on altered\nfood use and food insecurity. Moderating effects of social\nsupport on the negative effects of functional impairments on\nfood insecurity were not found in this study, however; there\nwere no significant interactions among these variables.\nThe potential underestimation of the prevalence of food\ninsecurity among elderly persons has been recognized be-\ncause of the possibility that elderly persons have different\nphysical and socioeconomic conditions, perceptions, atti-\ntudes, and experiences throughout their life toward food\nproblems (Wolfe et al., 1996). National surveys--including\nthe CPS that incorporated the first direct food insecurity and\nhunger module--showed that households headed by an el-\nderly person had lower rates of food insecurity than those of\nRose et al., 1998). Furthermore, the prevalence from na-\ntional surveys is usually lower than that of local studies\ndone exclusive for elderly persons (Burt, 1993; Frongillo et\nal., 1992; New York State Department of Health and Office\ntion for these findings is that the limited concepts and mea-\nsures used in these studies do not reflect the special charac-\nteristics of food insecurity in elderly persons.\nThese results suggest that altered ability to use food due\nto functional impairments, regardless of the availability of food\nand social supports in the household, has an independent\nrole in characterizing food insecurity among elderly per-\nsons. That is, functional impairments are related to the spe-\ncial nature of food insecurity among elderly persons. In\ncomparison with other age groups, food insecurity in elderly\npersons includes not only limited food affordability, avail-\nability, and accessibility, but also altered food use. Food-\ninsecure elderly persons are those who have multiple prob-\nlems that prevent them from achieving nutritional well-being.\nThey are more likely to participate in food assistance pro-\ngrams designed to ameliorate their problems than food-secure\nelderly persons. Therefore, nutrition programs should recog-\nnize and provide services to cover those needs.\n"
