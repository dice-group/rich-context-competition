However, the current status of the\ndietary quality of persons with heart failure has not\nbeen previously reported.\nOBJECTIVE: To describe sodium intake, patient factors\nassociated with sodium intake and overall dietary\nquality in a national sample of persons with heart\nfailure.\nDESIGN: Analysis of repeated cross-sectional probabil-\nity sample surveys using data from National Health and\nNutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) of 1999\u00ad\nPARTICIPANTS: The study sample consisted of 574\npersons with self-reported heart failure (mean age=\nMEASUREMENTS: Diet of each survey participant was\nassessed using single 24 hour recall. Dietary nutrients\nof interest included sodium, the mainstay of heart\nfailure dietary recommendations, and additionally po-\ntassium, calcium, magnesium, fish oils, saturated fat\nand fiber. Specific dietary goals were based on estab-\nlished guidelines.\nRESULTS: Mean sodium intake was 2,719 mg, with\nfactors associated with greater sodium intake included\nmale gender, lower education, lower income and no\nreported diagnosis of hypertension. Mean potassium\nintake was 2,367 mg/day, with no differences by type of\ndiuretic used or renal disease status. Adherence rates\nto established guidelines for other nutrients were 13%\nfor calcium, 10% for magnesium, 2% for fish oils, 13%\nfor saturated fat and 4% for fiber.\nCONCLUSIONS: Dietary quality of persons with self-\nreported heart failure was poor. Public health\napproaches and clinical dietary interventions are need-\ned for persons with this increasingly prevalent clinical\nsyndrome.\n\u00a9 Society of General Internal Medicine 2010\nT he article corresponding to this abstract was published in\nthe February 2010 issue of JGIM.
