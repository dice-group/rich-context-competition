Pain and its under-\ntreatment are widely reported in the\nmedical literature and media to be\nan international health crisis. The\nJoint Commission, a major hospital\nregulatory body in the USA, states\nthat 76 million Americans suffer\nfrom chronic, acute, or post-surgical\npain [1]. The Institute of Medicine\n(IOM), a non-governmental USA\nadvisory organisation, reported this\nnumber to be as high as 100 mil-\nlion adults [2], or nearly one in\nthree Americans. The financial cost\nreport Relieving Pain in America,\nranged between $560 billion and\nBrennan and colleagues describe a\nrecent `inflection point' in the\ninternational medical, legal, and\nethical worlds, in which the treat-\nment of pain, once long-ignored,\nbecame a fundamental human right\nciation for the Study of Pain (IASP)\nand the European Federation of\nIASP Chapters (EFIC) declared to\nthe European Parliament that\nchronic pain is a major healthcare\nproblem, a disease in itself, and\ncould affect 50% of people at any\npoint in time [4]. The World\nHealth Organization, long a propo-\nnent of treatment of acute and can-\ncer pain, backed a global day\nthe importance of treating chronic\npain as well [5].\nIn this editorial, we will explore\nboth the historical basis of the evo-\nlution of pain policy in the USA in\nthe last two decades and the devel-\nopment of an American public\nhealth crisis surrounding the wide-\nspread use and misuse of opioids.\nWe suggest that the American expe-\nrience in pain policy is a cautionary\ntale for Europe.\nPain becomes a vital sign\nin the USA\nsensus statements and regulatory\nmandates calling attention to the\nproblem of pain in all healthcare set-\nAgency for Healthcare Quality\nResearch (AHQR), a USA Govern-\nment quality-improvement agency,\nissued a two-part guideline declaring\nthat half of surgical patients, over 10\nmillion Americans, do not receive\nadequate post-surgical analgesia, and\nthat fears of addiction to opioids are\nlargely unfounded [6, 7]. The con-\ncept that addiction is rare in opioid-\nna\n\u00f5ve patients treated for acute pain\nwas supported exclusively by a brief\nNew England Journal of Medicine\nfour instances of iatrogenic drug\npatients treated with narcotics [8].\nThe AHQR guidelines were widely\ndisseminated in the media, even\ntrumpeted by the widely-read New\nYork Times as the birth of guideline-\ndriven healthcare [9]. The AHQR\ndocument made clear that pain man-\nAmerican Pain Society (APS), a lead-\ning multidisciplinary organisation\nthat exists to advance pain-related\nresearch, education, treatment and\nprofessional practice (see www.\namericanpainsociety.org), developed\na landmark consensus statement\nwith guidelines for a quality-\nimprovement approach towards the\ntreatment of acute and cancer pain\nlines [11] for the treatment of pain\nin the hospital setting. The consen-\nsus stated that pain intensity should\nbe recorded as a part of the patient's\npermanent medical record, \"such as\non the vital sign sheet\". The focus on\nanalgesic drugs is clear, though the\nstatement recognises the existence of\nnon-pharmacological measures to\ntreat pain [10]. However, no consen-\nsus statement, practice guideline, or\ncommittee report had the cultural\nand practical impact on the treat-\nment of pain in the USA that the\nJoint Commission on Accreditation\nof Health Care Organizations (JCA-\npain management standards for the\naccreditation of healthcare organisa-\ntions [1]. What were previously\nlabelled clinical guidelines and\nparameters effectively became prac-\ntice mandates that drove provider\nand hospital behaviours. The reach\nof JCAHO, now known as the Joint\nCommission, cannot be underesti-\nmated, as it is responsible for accred-\nhealthcare organisations to ensure\nthe `safest, highest-quality care' [12].\nThe Veteran's Health Administra-\ntion (VHA), the USA's largest inte-\ngrated health system, serving 8.3\nmillion military veterans (see www.\nva.gov/health/), became among the\nfirst major health organisations to\njoin the anti-pain movement. Con-\ntinuously documenting pain in the\nhope of heightening the awareness of\npain was the cornerstone of the\nmovement. The VHA adopted the\nenacted a national strategy to ensure\nthat pain is routinely assessed at all\npatient encounters, including in the\nambulatory setting, using a 0\u00ad10\nnumeric rating scale [13]. Govern-\nmental, non-governmental, and\npharmaceutical organisations [14]\ncampaigned vigorously for more\naggressive pain treatment on all\nfronts. Despite the noble intention to\nreduce pain-related suffering, these\ncultural and regulatory shifts have\nled to unintended consequences,\nespecially when the `fifth vital sign'\nconcept is rolled out to settings\nwhere the presentation is not acute.\nFinally, it is difficult to ignore the\ninfluence, even if subtle and when\nopenly declared, of potential finan-\ncial conflicts of interest, with spon-\nsorship and/or compensation by the\npharmaceutical industry of leading\nsocieties, clinicians and regulatory\nbodies involved with pain advocacy\nThe influence of\nAmerican pain policies on\nopioid prescriptions\nSocial policy, carried out in the form\nof a pain-centered mandate for\naccreditation of American healthcare\nfacilities, with influence from a vari-\nety of consensus and guidelines [6,\nthe quantity of opioids prescribed\nand consumed by Americans. These\npro-opioid policies were likely to\nhave been fuelled by the American\nhealth system's payment procedures\nthat link `patient experience' to\nreimbursement, a mechanism that\nhas been demonstrated to drive\noverprescribing and morbidity [17].\nThe rise in the number of pre-\nscriptions written for opioids in\nAmerica over the last decade has\nbeen nothing short of astounding.\nThe estimated number of prescrip-\ntions filled for opioid substances\nby 75.8 million grams, an increase\nsales corresponded to an increase in\nthe therapeutic use of opioids by\n296 mg per American, a change of\nless than 5% of the world's popula-\ntion, now consume 80% of the\nworld's opioids and 99% of the\nworld's hydrocodone [20].

A comprehensive review\nexploring the effectiveness of long-\nterm therapy for chronic, non-\ncancer pain highlights the extraordi-\nnary paucity of compelling data on\nlong-term opioid therapy [38]. In\nparticular, there is limited evidence\nto support significant improvements\nin functional status and quality of\nlife among opioid users [39].\nWhat can Europeans learn\nfrom the American\nexperience?\nThe literature on prescription opioid\nabuse in the European Union is\nnotably scarce; however, isolated\nreports of alarming incidences of\nprescription drug abuse within indi-\nvidual European Union countries are\nemerging [40]. The United Nation's\nInternational Narcotics Control\nBoard highlights the worldwide mis-\nuse of prescription drugs and pre-\ndicts that it will exceed illicit drug\npublished a World Drug Report out-\nlining a declining world market for\nillicit drugs but a worldwide increase\nin demand for prescription opioids\n[42]. A report by the European Mon-\nitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug\nAddiction presents similar concerns\nabout the misuse of synthetic opioids\n[43]. It is our opinion that America\nis an epicenter of a potentially\nemerging worldwide epidemic. The\nvertically integrated healthcare sys-\ntems of the UK and much of Europe\nare in unique positions to advocate\nfor effective and safe prescribing of\nopioids. Given that the evidence-\nbased benefits of opioid therapy are\nquite limited, best-practice\napproaches and formulary recom-\nmendations should focus on short-\nterm and limited use for acute and\nnon-palliative pain. Additionally, the\nNHS should mature its support for\nthe utilisation of non-opioid pain\ntherapies such as acupuncture, for\nwhich there is a growing evidence\nbase and public interest [44]. We\nsincerely hope that the UK and other\nEuropean countries are able to learn\nfrom the American experience and\navoid the same pitfalls.

Learning from the opioid epidemic in the USA\nDeaths from prescription opioids in\nthe USA have increased over the\nlast decade in parallel with an\nincrease in prescribing of opioids\nfor pain. In this issue of Anaesthe-\nsia, Kotecha and Sites chronicle the\nevolution of the opioid misuse `epi-\ndemic', clearly highlighting a regu-\nlatory pain management mandate,\nas well as aggressive \u00ad and some\nwould say questionable \u00ad marketing\npractices on the part of pharmaceu-\ntical companies as drivers of\nincreased prescribing of opioids [1].\nHowever, things may not be so\nsimple. The association between\nincreased prescribing and increased\nopioid-related harms is multifac-\neted, and these dynamics need fur-\nther exploration if the UK and\nothers are to learn from the experi-\nence of the USA. The situation in\nthe UK (where increased prescrib-\ning, to date, hasn't resulted in an\nexplosion of opioid-related deaths)\nshould prompt us to drill deeper\ninto the policies, structural elements\nof healthcare delivery, and cultural\naspects of licit and illicit drug use,\nthat contribute to opioid-related\nharms. It is also important to\nunderstand what is at stake, as\nefforts to address opioid misuse and\nopioid-related harms risk curtailing\naccess to necessary opioid treatment\nand stigmatisation of both patients\nwho use opioids and providers who\nprescribe them.\nControversial role for\nopioid analgesics in\npersistent pain\nThe rise in opioid prescribing in\nboth the USA and the UK is almost\nwholly attributable to an increase in\ntheir use for persistent non-cancer\npain [2]. Use of opioids for acute\npain and cancer-related pain at the\nend of life is established medical\npractice and has support from pub-\nlished evidence [3, 4]. By contrast,\nthe evidence for use of these drugs\nfor chronic, non-cancer pain, par-\nticularly for prolonged periods, is\nscarce in relation to both efficacy\nand safety, and epidemiologic stud-\nies have raised the concern that\ntheir use for persistent pain is asso-\nciated with poorer quality of life\n[5, 6]. Controversy abounds, and\nproviders and patients grapple with\nbasic questions: what are we treat-\ning? What are the goals of therapy?\nChronic pain is common and has\nbeen reported in 22% of patients sur-\nveyed across 14 different countries\n[7].
