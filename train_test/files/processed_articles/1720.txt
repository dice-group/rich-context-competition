We calculated gender- and race/ethnicity-specific cystatin C and creatinine ranges and conducted multivariable\nlinear regression analyses to assess factors that contribute to variability in cystatin C and creatinine levels.\nResults: Overall, the mean serum cystatin C level was 0.84 mg/L and was higher in male than female individuals and higher\nin non-Hispanic white versus non-Hispanic black and Mexican American individuals. The mean serum creatinine was 0.71\nmg/dl and was higher in male than in female individuals but lower in non-Hispanic white and Mexican American compared\nwith non-Hispanic black individuals. Unlike creatinine, which increases with age from 12 to 19 yr, cystatin C levels decrease,\nparticularly in female individuals. After adjustment for age, gender, and race/ethnicity, uric acid and blood urea nitrogen were\nsignificantly associated with cystatin C levels.\nConclusions: Serum cystatin C is significantly related to gender, age, race/ethnicity, uric acid, and blood urea nitrogen in\nadolescents.\nSerum creatinine is the most common marker of kidney\nfunction used in clinical practice. Nonetheless, the lim-\nitations of using serum creatinine as a kidney function\nmeasure are well documented (1,2). In particular, the produc-\ntion of creatinine is highly affected by dietary intake and mus-\ncle mass, which itself varies by age, height, gender, and race/\nethnicity. In children, the use of creatinine to assess kidney\nfunction is further complicated by changing muscle mass,\nwhich influences the circulating creatinine concentration (3) as\nchildren grow. Serum cystatin C, a product of an endogenous\n\"housekeeping\" gene thought to be produced at a constant rate,\nis a novel marker of kidney function that has been suggested to\nbe able to overcome some of the age and body size limitations\nof serum creatinine as a marker of kidney function (4,5). Cys-\ntatin C has been proposed by several groups and a recent\nmeta-analysis to be a more sensitive and specific marker of\nkidney function in both children and adults (6\u00ad9).\nLittle is known, however, about the normal ranges for cys-\ntatin C in a diverse, healthy pediatric population and which\nfactors contribute to variability in levels. Cystatin C levels are\nhighest within the first few days of life (presumably reflecting\nthe physiologic low GFR in newborns) but normalize by age 1\nand have been reported to remain constant throughout adult-\nhood up to age 50 (10). In the existing literature, proposed\nranges for the serum concentration of cystatin C in pediatric\npopulations are inconsistent, with several small, single-institu-\ntion, hospital- or clinic-based studies reporting reference ranges\nIn addition, reported cystatin C ranges are affected by use of\ndifferent cystatin C assays (4). These are important limitations\nto the use of cystatin C in routine assessment of kidney func-\ntion. Furthermore, some previous studies suggested that cysta-\ntin C levels are independent of gender, age, or body composi-\ntion (14\u00ad16), whereas others showed differences in cystatin C\nlevels according to demographic characteristics, adiposity, thy-\nroid function, and inflammation (17\u00ad20). It is unknown\nwhether factors such as gender, age, race, adiposity, thyroid\nfunction, and inflammation affect cystatin C levels in the nor-\nmal adolescent population.\nThe objective of this study was to establish the range of\ncystatin C levels in a nationally representative adolescent sam-\nPublished online ahead of print.

To accomplish this, we analyzed serum cystatin C and\nserum creatinine data from participants aged 12 to 19 yr in the\nThird National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES III). We directly contrast the associations between\ndemographic factors and serum cystatin C to the widely known\nassociations between age, gender, and race and serum creati-\nnine in adolescents.\nMaterials and Methods\nStudy Population\nNHANES III is a cross-sectional survey conducted between 1988 and\n1994 by the National Center for Health Statistics. NHANES III used a\ncomplex, multistage, clustered sampling design to provide nationally\nrepresentative data on the civilian, noninstitutionalized US population\n(21). As part of a National Institutes of Health\u00adfunded study, serum\ncystatin C was measured on all NHANES III participants who were\n60 yr old and had serum creatinine measured, as well as a 25%\nrandom sample of those aged 12 to 59 yr (22). The younger age group\nwas supplemented by sampling all individuals with high standard\nin female individuals). In this analysis, we analyzed data available from\nall NHANES III participants who were aged 12 to 19 yr and for whom\nindividuals, 10 of whom had high standard serum creatinine [nine male\nindividual and one female individual]).\nData Collection and Measurement\nSerum samples were stored at 70\u00b0C until 2006 when cystatin C was\nmeasured at the Cleveland Clinic Research Laboratory. Cystatin C was\nmeasured using the Dade Behring N Latex Cystatin C assay, which is\nan automated particle-enhanced immunonephelometric assay run on\nthe Dade Behring Nephelometer II (Dade Behring, Deerfield, IL). The\ninterassay coefficients of variation for the assay were 5.05 and 4.87% at\nmean concentrations of 0.97 and 1.90 mg/L, respectively. This assay is\ncurrently the most precise automated assay across the clinical concen-\ntration range (4).\nSerum creatinine was measured by the modified kinetic Jaffe reaction\nusing a Hitachi 737 analyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN).\nSerum creatinine values were calibrated to standard creatinine using an\nenzymatic creatinine assay traceable to liquid chromatography-isotope\ndilution gas chromatography mass spectrometry reference method at\nthe Cleveland Clinic Research Laboratory using the following equation:\nNHANES III serum creatinine (mg/dl)] (23\u00ad25).\nDetailed information regarding data collection in NHANES III has\nbeen published previously (26). Ethnicity was categorized as non-\nHispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican American, and other.\nEstimates for the last category are not presented because of small\nsample size and heterogeneity within this group (27). Measured weight\nand height were used to generate categories of underweight (5% body\nmass index [BMI] for age), normal weight (5 to 85% BMI for age), at risk\nfor overweight (85 to 95% BMI for age), and overweight (95% BMI for\nage) using gender-specific BMI-for-age growth percentiles (28). The\npercentage of body fat (%BF) and free fat mass (FFM) were calculated\nusing data obtained from bioelectric impedance analysis, gender, and\nweight (29). Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) was categorized (0.22,\n0.22 to 1.0, or 1 mg/dl) as normal, borderline elevated, or elevated\n(30). Tanner stage of pubic hair development was available only for\nmale and female individuals who were 8 to 18 yr of age and available\nfor 75.5% of the study population.\nStatistical Analysis\nFor accounting for the complex sampling design of NHANES III and\nfor generation of estimates that are representative of the US adolescent\npopulation aged 12 to 19 yr, all analysis were conducted using the Stata\nsvy commands (StataCorp release 10.0, College Station, TX), which\nincorporated the appropriate sampling weights for the cystatin C sub-\npopulation (22). For continuous variables, the mean  SEM is reported;\nfor categorical variables, we examined the proportion of individuals in\neach category. The adjusted Wald test was used to compare means. P \n0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nWe determined the distribution of serum cystatin C and creatinine in\nthe overall study population and generated age-, race-, and gender-\nspecific percentiles. We conducted univariable and multivariable linear\nregression analyses to evaluate factors influencing cystatin C and cre-\natinine levels. In multivariable modeling, biologically plausible vari-\nables, including gender, age, and race/ethnicity, as well as potential\ncorrelates previously described (16\u00ad19) as associated with serum cys-\ntatin C levels were maintained in the model when they were significant\nThe protocols for conducting this study were approved by the insti-\ntutional review boards of the National Center for Health Statistics and\nthe Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Informed con-\nsent was obtained from all participants during the survey.\nResults\nTable 1 shows the demographics of the sample and nation-\nally representative estimates of selected characteristics, overall\nand by gender for the 12- to 19-yr-old US population included\nin NHANES III. The study population represents a generally\nhealthy adolescent US population with 3% having self-re-\nported comorbidities such as hypertension or hyperlipidemia\nor laboratory evidence of inflammation with elevated CRP or\nwhite blood cell count. The distributions of serum cystatin C\nand standardized serum creatinine, stratified by gender, are\nshown in Figure 1. The distributions seem close to normally\ndistributed, but cystatin C has a narrower distribution than\nserum creatinine and creatinine is slightly more skewed toward\nhigher values. For both cystatin C and serum creatinine, the\noverall distribution is shifted to lower values for female com-\npared with male individuals.

CRP and\nBMI, reported to be associated with cystatin C levels in adults,\nwere not statistically significantly associated with cystatin C\nlevels in adolescents. Not surprising, cystatin C and creatinine\nwere moderately correlated (r  0.3036), because each repre-\nsents a measure of kidney function.

Female gender, lower age, and\nnon-Hispanic white and Mexican American race/ethnicity\nwere also associated with lower serum creatinine levels after\nadjustment. The fully adjusted model in Table 3 presents the\nclinical variables that remain significant sources of variation in\nserum levels of cystatin C or creatinine after adjustment for\ndemographic factors. In this analysis, the effect of gender on\ncreatinine and cystatin C is comparable, whereas creatinine\nincreases with age and cystatin C decreases slightly. Non-\nHispanic black individuals have lower cystatin C, whereas they\nhave higher serum creatinine as compared with non-Hispanic\nwhite individuals. Overall, the clinical variables included in the\nmultivariable analyses accounted for 30.9% of the variation in\nserum cystatin C and 46.2% of the variation in serum creatinine.\nAfter adjustment for demographic factors, CRP, hemoglobin,\nserum albumin, TSH, and BMI were no longer statistically\nsignificant sources of variation for cystatin C.\nDiscussion\nTo our knowledge, this study represents the first evaluation\nof the distribution of serum cystatin C and comparison with\nserum creatinine in a nationally representative adolescent pop-\nulation, including individuals of different race/ethnicities. The\nestimates from this investigation are representative of the civil-\nian, noninstitutionalized population of the United States aged\nlevels in adolescents have been conducted in relatively small,\nselected study populations or study populations limited to one\ninstitution or ethnicity (7,8,11\u00ad13). Thus, one of the largest\nadvantages to this study is the generalizability of the results,\npresenting the distribution of cystatin C levels in a diverse\npopulation of race and ethnicity from across the United States.\nIn this broad sample of US adolescents, contrary to reports of\ncystatin C levels' being independent of age and gender in\nadolescents, female gender, increasing age, and non-Hispanic\nblack and Mexican American race/ethnicity were significantly\nassociated with lower cystatin C levels after adjustment.\nEarlier reports provided conflicting evidence regarding\nwhether cystatin C levels vary by gender. Some investigators\nfound statistically significant differences between genders in\nadults (31\u00ad34), with men having higher cystatin C levels than\nwomen, whereas others did not (10,13). Even among those who\ndid find a statistically significant difference between serum\ncystatin C concentrations in men and women, some authors\nsuggested that the difference was small enough to justify a\nuniversal reference range. Only two studies suggested that\ngender-specific reference ranges might be appropriate (34,35).\nIn our study, male adolescents had on average 12.7% higher\nA\nSerum Cystatin C (mg/L)\nFrequency in U.S. Adolescent Population\nMale\nFemale\nB\nSerum Creatinine (mg/dL)\nFrequency in US Adolescent Population\nMale\nFemale\nFigure 1. Weighted frequency distribution of values of serum\ncystatin C (mg/L; A) and standardized serum creatinine (mg/\ndl; B) for male and female individuals, representative of US\nmean serum cystatin C level compared with female adoles-\ncents, and this difference was constant across race/ethnicity\ngroups. Creatinine showed a similar gender difference, with\nthe mean male serum creatinine levels 16.7% higher than those\nin female individuals. This result is consistent with other stud-\nies that examined creatinine levels in pediatric populations (36).\nConsidering that in US adolescents 12 to 19 yr old the effect of\ngender on cystatin C levels is nearly equivalent to the effect of\ngender on serum creatinine levels, it seems reasonable to con-\nclude that gender-specific cystatin C reference intervals may be\nappropriate in this population.\nIt is unclear why female individuals have lower cystatin C\nlevels than male individuals. Male and female individuals in\nthis population were similar in age and distribution of race/\nethnicity, and adjustment for these factors did not account for\nthe gender difference. Young male adults have had GFR re-\nlower cystatin levels in female individuals. Differences in cys-\ntatin C production rather than kidney function may also ac-\ncount for the lower serum cystatin C levels in girls. Higher\nextrarenal elimination, different hormonal variations, or factors\nthat are present in female individuals and interfere with the\ncystatin C assay may also account for the difference by gender.\nSerum cystatin C and creatinine levels also differed signifi-\nAge (years)\nSerum Cystatin C (mg/L) or\nSerum Creatinine (mg/dL)\nMean Cystatin C (male) Mean Creatinine (male)\nMean Cystatin C (female) Mean Creatinine (female)\nFigure 2.

The higher creatinine levels in non-\nHispanic black compared with non-Hispanic white individuals\nare well reported and are thought to be explained by racial\ndifferences in muscle mass (38); however, little information\nexists regarding cystatin C generation, extrarenal elimination,\nor potential assay interference by race/ethnicity. It is possible\nthat non-Hispanic black and Mexican American individuals\nhave underlying genetic factors that alter the physiologic pro-\nduction and/or elimination of cystatin C. It may also be that\nthis represents differences in physiologic GFR by race/ethnic-\nity.\nIn contrast to the positive correlation of age with serum\ncreatinine corresponding to adolescent maturation and increase\nin muscle mass, even within the relatively tight age range of 7\nyr in this study population, age was a modest but significant\nnegative predictor for serum cystatin C levels. This was espe-\ncially true in female individuals after the age of 12 and in male\nindividuals after the age of 14 yr. This contrasts to previous\nwork that concluded that cystatin C levels were independent of\nage in pediatric populations (11,14). Several authors noted an\nage-related rise in cystatin C levels after the age of 50 to 60 yr\n(15,32,39), which presumably reflects a decline of kidney func-\ntion. It is known that there are no changes in GFR during\nadolescent maturation (40); thus, in this population of generally\nhealthy adolescents aged 12 to 19 yr, the age-related variation\nin cystatin C levels is likely related to variation in cystatin\nproduction. It is interesting that these age-related changes in\ncystatin levels parallel peak height velocity, which also varies\nby gender (41) with girls reaching peak height velocity earlier\nin development (Tanner stage II) than boys (Tanner stage IV);\nthis correlates with our analysis that found that the highest\nmedian cystatin C level was in Tanner stage II for female\nindividuals and Tanner stage IV for male individuals. Perhaps\nthe variation in cystatin C levels is affected by growth and\nmetabolic demands in adolescents.\nAnother notable finding in this study was the independent\nassociation of higher uric acid with higher levels of cystatin C.\nOther authors noted an association between hyperuricemia and\nrenal disease, but most attributed the association to a simple\nclustering of hyperuricemia with other well-established cardio-\nvascular and renal risk factors (e.g., insulin resistance or type 2\ndiabetes, high BP, central obesity), and mild hyperuricemia is\ngenerally regarded as insignificant. In this large, generally\nhealthy population with overall normal uric acid levels and a\nlow prevalence of renal disease, it is unlikely that renal disease\nis responsible for this association. Serum uric acid has been\nreported to be correlated with the prevalence of the metabolic\nsyndrome, particularly abdominal obesity, in NHANES partic-\nipants (42). Although the association of uric acid with serum\ncystatin C levels has not been previously described, many other\ngroups have noted the effect of body composition (including\nBMI and %BF) on serum cystatin C levels (16). Although in our\nanalyses BMI and %BF were not statistically significantly asso-\nciated with serum cystatin C levels after adjustment for demo-\ngraphic factors, perhaps the association of uric acid with cys-\ntatin C is related to other anthropomorphic factors not\nmeasured in the NHANES III survey.\nOur study has several limitations, particularly its cross-sec-\ntional design and our retrospective use of the data; therefore,\nwe cannot assess longitudinal changes in cystatin C levels with\nage, height velocity, or changes in body habitus. In addition, a\nnumber of measures that are available for adults in NHANES\nIII are not measured in the adolescent age range, such as\ndual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scans to assess body compo-\nsition further. Serum samples were available only for individ-\nuals who were 12 yr of age; therefore, our results cannot be\ngeneralized to children who are younger than 12. In addition,\nformal GFR measurements are not performed in NHANES III;\ntherefore, we also cannot distinguish intrinsic renal factors\nfrom extrarenal causes of variation in cystatin C levels. Despite\nthese limitations, this is the largest nationally representative\nstudy of serum cystatin C levels in a pediatric population to\ndate, demonstrating previously unreported variation in cysta-\ntin C levels according to age, race, and gender in the 12- to 19-yr\nage group.\nConclusions\nOur study provides gender- and race/ethnicity-specific nor-\nmal values of cystatin C and creatinine for the general popula-\ntion of US adolescents aged 12 to 19 yr. We observed a clear\ngender difference in serum cystatin C levels with female indi-\nviduals having lower levels than male individuals. We con-\nclude that serum cystatin C, in conjunction with serum creati-\nnine, is a useful clinical tool for physicians in the routine\nassessment of renal function, particularly in the adolescent\npopulation, in which rapidly changing serum creatinine levels\nmay present a confusing clinical picture. Our study cannot\ndirectly address whether serum cystatin C is a better clinical\nmarker of kidney function compared with creatinine, because\nwe have no direct measures of GFR; however, in a comparison\nof the effects of age, gender, and race on cystatin C levels with\ncreatinine, gender and race have comparable magnitude effects\non cystatin C and creatinine, whereas age has a much smaller\neffect on cystatin C than on creatinine. Clinicians should bear in\nmind that the variation pattern in cystatin C levels is in many\nways opposite to creatinine; namely, that cystatin C levels\ndecrease slightly with age and are slightly lower in non-His-\npanic black compared with non-Hispanic white adolescents.\nThe tables herein present normal ranges for cystatin C in US\nadolescents as measured by the Dade Behring N Latex Cystatin\nC assay. Age-, race-, and gender-specific ranges for cystatin C\npresented here can be used as another tool for the clinician to\nassess kidney function in adolescents.\n"
