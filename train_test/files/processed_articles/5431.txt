Although\nseveral treatment methods have been devel-\noped,5 it is generally agreed that such\napproaches remain unsatisfactory.6\nMethods of noninvasive brain stimula-\ntion, such as transcranial direct current\nstimulation7 or repetitive transcranial mag-\nnetic stimulation (TMS),8 are promising\napproaches to treat visuospatial neglect.\nOne influential mechanism underlying\nthese noninvasive stimulation methods is\nbased on interhemispheric rivalry, or the\ncompetition model.9,10 A classic theta-burst\nstimulation (TBS) protocol, which is used to\ninduce long-term potentiation or long-term\ndepression in brain slices, can be adapted to\nTMS, where it rapidly produces a long-\nlasting effect on the motor cortex.11 In a\nsham-controlled study, 10 days of continu-\nous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) over the\nposterior parietal cortex (PPC) of the left\nhemisphere reduced visuospatial neglect for\nimprovement in the everyday behaviour of\npatients with visuospatial neglect for !3\nweeks, after two consecutive days of con-\ntinuous theta-burst stimulation.12\nHere, we used a modified version of a\ncTBS protocol that is known to be effective\nin inducing long-term depression and long-\nlasting changes in the excitability of\nthe stimulated cortex.11 By increasing the\nnumber of stimulation days and the number\nof trains per day over the left PPC in\npoststroke patients, we investigated whether\nthe efficacy of cTBS for visuospatial neg-\nlect rehabilitation could be enhanced.\nVisuospatial neglect was assessed with both\nthe star cancellation test (SCT) and the line\nbisection test (LBT).13 The SCT is con-\nsidered to be particularly sensitive for visuo-\nspatial neglect and is not subject to practice\neffects, therefore it is suitable for repeated\nmeasurements.14 The line bisection test,\nunlike the cancellation test, requires magni-\ntude estimates that are influenced by atten-\ntional bias. Furthermore, a combination of\nneglect tests, rather than a single neglect test,\nmight be more sensitive in detecting and\ndefining the presence of visuospatial\nPatients and methods\nPatients\nThis study enrolled consecutive right-\nhanded patients with right hemisphere\nstroke and visuospatial neglect, attending\nthe Department of Rehabilitation Medicine,\nXuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical\nPatients were randomly allocated to left\nPPC cTBS treatment or sham treatment,\nusing a computer-generated randomization\nschedule. Patients and therapists were\nblinded to the type of intervention. All\npatients received conventional rehabilitation\ntraining, based on visuospatial scanning, of\n30 min twice daily for 2 weeks. Patients were\nalso treated with programmes for motor\nrehabilitation when necessary.\nAll patients gave written informed con-\nsent for participation in the study.\nExperimental procedures were approved by\nthe local Ethics Committee and were under-\ntaken in accordance with the Declaration of\nHelsinki.\nInclusion/exclusion criteria\nThis study included patients with visuo-\nspatial neglect, with a history of a haemor-\nrhagic or ischaemic lesion in the right\nhemisphere, which was confirmed by\ncomputed tomography or magnetic reson-\nance imaging >2 weeks before the beginning\nof the study. The diagnosis of visuospatial\nneglect was based on the judgement of the\nclinician and on deficits in at least one out of\ntwo paper\u00adpencil tests.12 The applied paper\u00ad\npencil tests were the SCT and LBT. The cut-\noff score of SCT was 51 (i.e. four omissions\nwas defined as an impairment score).16 In\nthe LBT, patients were included if they\nscored a deviation !12% to the right of\ncentre.15 All patients had normal or cor-\nrected-to-normal acuity.\nExclusion criteria for this study were\nbased on the accepted safety guidelines for\nTMS, which included an assessment of the\nhistory of epilepsy, previous head trauma,\ndrug and alcohol abuse and psychiatric\ndisorders.17 Moreover, patients were\nexcluded for any of the following reasons:\nrecurrent stroke, obvious aphasia and com-\nmunication obstacles, family history of seiz-\nures, ever use of tricyclic antidepressants or\nantipsychotic drugs, in vivo diamagnetic\nmetal implants such as cardiac pacemakers\npatients with visual field defects\ndetected by the confrontation method were\nexcluded.\nContinuous theta-burst stimulation and\nsham protocols\nContinuous theta-burst stimulation and\nsham treatments were performed immedi-\nately before visuospatial scanning training.\nThe site of cTBS or sham stimulation was set\nover P5, according to the International 10/\n10 EEG system: this site overlies the left PPC\nin proximity of the intraparietal sulcus.18\nEach day, four trains of left PPC cTBS or\nsham stimulation were applied, with an\ninterval of 15 min. Treatment was given for\n14 consecutive days.\nContinuous theta-burst stimulation was\ndelivered using a Super Rapid 2 magnetic\nstimulator (Magstim, Whitland, UK) with\n2.0-Tesla maximum field strength, con-\nnected with a figure-of-eight coil (diameter\nof outside loop, 87 mm). For each train, a\nthree-pulse burst was delivered at 30 Hz and\nrepeated every 200 ms (i.e. 5 Hz; the fre-\nquency that mimics the theta wave of a\nspontaneous neural rhythm) for 40 s. 11 The\nstimulus intensity was 80% of the resting\nmotor threshold of the resting abductor\npollicis brevis muscles.19\nSham stimulation was delivered with the\nsame set up as cTBS but with the coil\nperpendicular to the patient's scalp, with\nonly one edge of the coil resting on the\nClinical evaluation of visuospatial neglect\nVisuospatial neglect was assessed with the\nSCT and LBT, which were administered by\nblinded raters (Y.Z., S.H. and R.Z) at three\ntime points: 1 h before starting the first\nsession of stimulation (baseline), at the end\nof stimulation (Post 1) and after a follow up\nof 4 weeks (Post 2).\nThe SCT consisted of an A4 sheet of\npaper on which there were 56 small stars\nrandomly interspersed with a variety of\ndistracts (52 large stars, 10 short words\nand 13 letters). The patients were instructed\nto cross out all of the small stars. The\npercentage of small stars not crossed out\nThe LBT consisted of a landscape-\noriented A4 sheet of paper on which there\nwere five horizontal lines distributed with\nequal vertical spacing. The line lengths (L)\nasked to mark the midpoint of each line. The\ndistance between the marked midpoint and\nthe corresponding true midpoint were mea-\nsured (R). A positive value indicated devi-\nation towards the right of the true midpoint,\nwhile a negative value indicated deviation\ntowards the left. The percentage severity of\nvisuospatial neglect was calculated as\nStatistical analyses\nData are presented as mean \u00c6 SD. SPSS\u00d5\nversion 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA)\nwas used to process the data. A repeated-\nmeasure analysis of variance (ANOVA) was\nperformed to calculate the differences in\nSCT score and LBT score, with group\n(cTBS versus Sham) as the between-subject\nmain factor and time (baseline versus Post 1\nversus Post 2) as the within-subject main\nfactor. The Greenhouse\u00adGeisser test was\nused to correct the P-value if the\nMauchly's test of sphericity was significant.\nIf a significant effect was observed, post hoc\ntests were carried out for multiple compari-\nsons (least significant difference or Student\u00ad\nNewman\u00adKeuls). For all statistical analyses,\na P-value < 0.05 was considered to be\nsignificant.\nResults\nTwenty-two right-handed patients with\nright hemisphere stroke and visuospatial\nneglect were enrolled in this study. Of\nthese, 11 were assigned to cTBS and 11 to\nsham treatment. One patient in each group\ndid not finish the follow-up testing and these\ntwo patients were excluded from the study.\nTherefore, each group included full data\nfrom 10 patients for analysis. The treatment\ngroups did not differ in sex, age or time\nbetween stroke onset and beginning of\ntesting (Table 1).\nThere were no significant differences\nbetween the groups in baseline SCT scores\n(mean \u00c6 SD for SCT scores in the two\n7.07%, in the cTBS and sham treatment\ngroups, respectively).

Two patients reported\na slight headache when they received the real\ncTBS stimulation.\nDiscussion\nThe present study findings showed that our\nmodified cTBS protocol, administered over\nthe unaffected PPC for 2 weeks, combined\nwith conventional rehabilitation training,\nreduced visuospatial neglect significantly.\nThe improvement persisted for !4 weeks\nafter the discontinuation of cTBS.\nFurthermore, for the LBT task, efficacy at\nthe end of 4 weeks' follow up was signifi-\ncantly better than at the end of 2 weeks'\nstimulation. No significant improvement\nwas observed with sham treatment com-\nbined with conventional rehabilitation ther-\napy. Our device was only able to deliver\n30-Hz magnetic pulses if we also wanted to\nadjust the output (stimulation intensity),\nwhich we did in the present study; hence,\nwe used a modified protocol. Furthermore,\n4\u00ad7-Hz rhythms are in the range of the theta\nband, according to electroencephalograph\nsystems.\nThe method of how to achieve powerful,\nlong-lasting and stable efficacy for\nvisuospatial neglect is still open to debate.\nOur observation of a reduction in visuo-\nspatial neglect after cTBS over the unaf-\nfected PPC is in line with other noninvasive\nbrain stimulation studies, which used single-\npulse TMS and paired TMS as a `virtual\ntranscranial direct current stimulation26 or\nleft PPC TBS in two sessions per day with an\ndays), which reduced hemispatial neglect for\nup to 2 weeks after treatment: behavioural\ninattention test scores improved by 16.3% at\nTable 1.

Cazzoli et al.12 applied more\ntrains per day (four trains), but for fewer\ndays (2 days): their results showed a 37%\nimprovement in everyday behaviour of\nhemispatial neglect patients for !3 weeks.\nIn the current study, we applied more trains\nper day (four trains) and more stimulation\ndays (14 consecutive days) and showed that\nthe efficacy of cTBS can be enhanced and\ncan persist for !4 weeks after discontinu-\nation of stimulation. The mean \u00c6 SD SCT\nscore in the cTBS group improved by\nno significant effect was observed in the\nsham group. Patients in the cTBS group\nmaintained their relatively stable beneficial\noutcome, or even kept improving, after\ndiscontinuation of stimulation. This finding\nsuggests that the approach applied in this\nstudy \u00ad four trains daily and 14 consecutive\ndays \u00ad might be particularly promising for\ntherapeutic application.\nIt has been suggested that the suppression\nof pathological hyperexcitability of the\nstructurally intact PPC, which also leads to\na reduced interhemispheric inhibition from\nthe unaffected towards the affected hemi-\nsphere, is an important mechanism resulting\nin visuospatial neglect remission.27 It is\nhighly possible that the build up of cumula-\ntive effects may account for the dispropor-\ntionately longer-lasting effect of repeated\ntrains of cTBS compared with a single train:\ncumulative effects can be achieved after a\nlong conditioning phase involving periodic\nstimulation sessions at intervals 24 h,\nwhich build up a lasting `memory' and\nresult in increased facilitation of subsequent\nstimulation effects.28 Another interpretation\nfor the long-lasting effect of cTBS considers\nconsolidation mechanisms, as proposed in\nthe cascade model of animals, where\nrepeated trains of TBS can extend the life-\ntime of plastic modifications in the human\nbrain. Similar to results in animal studies,\nFigure 1.

Asterisks indicate results that\nwere significant using post hoc tests: **P < 0.01.\nthe number of applied theta-burst trains\ndetermines the lifetime of changes in the\nneural network of the human brain.19 The\nlasting reduction in visuospatial neglect\nobserved in this study supports the idea\nthat one or more of these mechanisms is\nactive in the human brain.\nA strength of the present study is the\nblinding of the patients, therapists and the\ntest raters. Also, the stimulus intensity for\nthe sham stimulation was the same as for\ncTBS, and all patients had the same acoustic\nsensation during treatment. Notable limita-\ntions of the present study are that there was\nno stratification by patient age, lesion loca-\ntion or subtype of visuospatial neglect, all of\nwhich may influence the recovery of visuo-\nspatial neglect,12 therefore stratification stu-\ndies are needed. Further studies should also\ninvestigate whether the number of stimula-\ntion days or the number of trains per day has\nthe greater effect. In addition, we note that\nour study also excluded patients with visual\nfield defects, which may have resulted in\nless-impaired patients being included in the\ncohort. Whether the extent of visuospatial\nneglect in stroke patients affects the efficacy\nof cTBS should be considered in further\nstudies. Finally, further studies should\ninclude a control group.\nIn conclusion, the present study sup-\nports previous findings that multiple ses-\nsions of cTBS over the unaffected PPC,\ncombined with conventional rehabilitation\ntherapy, can lead to efficient and long-\nlasting improvement in visuospatial neg-\nlect. Compared with other studies,10,12 the\npresent study also found initial evidence\nthat efficacy of cTBS for visuospatial\nneglect may be enhanced and prolonged\nby increasing the number of stimulation\ndays and the number of trains per day.\nWe base this conclusion following com-\nparison of our findings with those from\nother published studies, and we note that\nthe efficacy of conventional rTMS or TBS\noften is considered to be short lasting.\n"
