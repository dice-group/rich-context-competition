Data were\nindependently extracted using a dedicated form. Mortality rates and neurological outcomes were\nrecorded for the overall population and for in-hospital and prehospital mild hypothermia\nsubgroups.\nResults: Seven articles were identified for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Mild hypothermia\ndemonstrated no significant beneficial effects in terms of overall mortality or neurological\noutcomes. In addition, no significant outcome differences were observed between the pre- and in-\nhospital subgroups.\nConclusions: On the basis of this limited data set, mild hypothermia does not improve mortality\nrates or neurological outcomes in patients with ROSC after cardiac arrest, regardless of the timing\nof the hypothermia. Larger trials need to be carried out to confirm these findings.\nJournal of International Medical Research\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav\nimr.sagepub.com\n*These authors contributed equally to this work.\n1Department of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care Unit,\nWannan Medical College, Yijishan Hospital, Wuhu, Anhui,\nChina\n2Department of Translational Medicine, Eastern Piedmont\nUniversity `A.

Since being advocated\nby a number of international resuscitation\nguidelines,4\u00ad6 therapeutic hypothermia\nafter ROSC has gained widespread use.\nIn 2012, a meta-analysis reported reduced\nin-hospital mortality rates after cardiac\narrest in adults with ROSC who presented\nwith nonshockable initial rhythms, and\nwho underwent hypothermia.7 More\nrecently, two large trials showed that nei-\nther the application nor the timing of onset\nof targeted controlled mild hypothermia\npatient outcomes.8,9 As new data bring\nnovel results, the benefits and risks of mild\nhypothermia remain uncertain in patients\nrecovering from cardiac arrest.\nThe aim of this meta-analysis was to\nsystematically review the literature, to ascer-\ntain differences firstly in mortality rates and\nsecondly in neurological outcomes, in\npatients after ROSC (regardless of the\narrest rhythm) who underwent targeted\ncontrolled mild hypothermia compared\nwith those who did not. In addition, mor-\ntality rates and neurological outcomes were\ninvestigated in those receiving mild hypo-\nthermia with different onset times (pre- or\nin-hospital) compared with patients not\nreceiving mild hypothermia.\nMaterials and methods\nSearch strategy\nOnline searches of the PubMed\u00d5, Elsevier,\nCochrane (Central) and Web of Science\ndatabases from inception until March 2014\nwere performed, using the following search\nkeywords and terms: (``therapeutic hypother-\nmia'' OR ``induced hypothermia'' OR\n``inducing hypothermia'' OR ``induce hypo-\nthermia'' OR ``resuscitation hypothermia''\nOR ``mild hypothermia'' OR ``moderate\nhypothermia'' OR ``resuscitative hypother-\nmia'' OR ``hypothermia treatment'') AND\n(``cardiac arrest'' OR ``heart arrest'' OR\n``cardiogenic shock'' OR ``cardiopulmonary\narrest'' OR ``arrest of the heart'' OR ``resus-\ncitation of the heart'' OR ``cardiorespiratory\narrest'') AND (``resuscitation'' OR ``cardio-\npulmonary resuscitation'' OR ``resuscitated''\nOR ``cardiac resuscitation''). The search was\nlimited to studies published in English.\nData screening and extraction\nCitation titles and abstracts were independ-\nently screened by two reviewers (T.Y. and\nF.L.). All randomized controlled clinical trials\nof any duration that compared mortality rates\nand neurological outcomes in human adult\npatients (aged> 18 years) with ROSC after\ncardiac arrest, who underwent therapeutic\ntargeted controlled mild hypothermia (32\u00ad\n34C) compared with those did not (patients\nwith normothermia or hypothermia other\nthan mild hypothermia), irrespective of the\npresenting rhythm, were identified. All poten-\ntially eligible papers were retrieved in full.\nThe references of all retrieved articles\nwere examined to identify further poten-\ntially eligible studies. Trial characteristics\nand outcomes were independently recorded\nby the two reviewers using a predesigned\ndata abstraction form. In cases of disagree-\nment, all the authors jointly reviewed the\narticle in question until a consensus was\nreached. Any duplicate papers were identi-\nfied and excluded from the meta-analysis.\nThe Jadad scale10 was used to assess the\nquality of the data reporting and random-\nization, concealed allocation and degree of\nblinding, and patient flow description. High-\nquality studies were defined by a score of !3.\nEndpoints\nThe primary endpoint was to investigate the\npotentially beneficial role of targeted con-\ntrolled mild hypothermia, in terms of mor-\ntality rates in patients with ROSC after\ncardiac arrest; cut-off points for mortality\nas defined within each study were used in the\nmeta-analysis. The secondary endpoints\nwere to determine whether hypothermia\ncan improve neurological outcomes in\npatients with ROSC after cardiac arrest\nand whether differences in either outcome\n(mortality or neurological) could be found\nin subgroups of patients receiving pre- or in-\nhospital mild hypothermia, compared with\npatients not receiving mild hypothermia.\nTo evaluate and compare neurological\noutcomes, the definition of a `good' neuro-\nlogical outcome used within each study was\nused in the meta-analysis. When the neuro-\nlogical outcome was evaluated using the\ncerebral performance category scale, values\nof 1\u00ad2 were considered to be a `good'\nneurological outcome, while values ! 3\nwere considered to be a `poor' outcome.\nStatistical analyses\nData related to mortality rates and neuro-\nlogical outcomes in the overall population\nand in the in-hospital and prehospital sub-\ngroups were extracted; a consecutive ana-\nlysis for subgroups was performed (filtered\naccording to the analysed variable).\nFor dichotomous outcomes, risk ratios\n(RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs)\nwere used to represent the effects of mild\nhypothermia on different outcomes. An RR\nof < 1 favoured the use of therapeutic mild\nhypothermia. Data were pooled only when\nadequate clinical and methodological simi-\nlarities were present between the studies.\nThe homogeneity assumption was\nassessed using the I2 value, which describes\nthe percentage of total variation across\nstudies that is due to heterogeneity rather\nthan chance. I2 was computed as\nCochran heterogeneity statistic and df is\nthe degrees of freedom. A value of 0%\nindicates no observed heterogeneity; larger\nvalues indicate increasing heterogeneity.\nWhenever I2 was >25% (i.e. heterogeneity\nwas found), random effects model results\nwere presented as the primary analysis.\nPublication bias was estimated using a\nfunnel plot. Parametric variables were pre-\nsented as mean \u00c6 SD; nonparametric vari-\nables were presented as the median and\ninterquartile range. Statistical analyses\nwere conducted using RevMan\u00d5 Review\nManager software, version 5.0 (Nordic\nCochrane Centre, The Cochrane\nCollaboration, Copenhagen, Denmark).\nA P-value < 0.05 was considered to indicate\nstatistical significance.\nResults\nA flowchart of the study selection is given in\nFigure 1.

The main findings were that mild\nhypothermia does not benefit patient\nmortality, regardless of the initiation time\n(pre- or in-hospital), and does not improve\nneurological outcomes after ROSC.\nSince the advent of CPR, technological\ndevelopment and research have introduced\ndistinct and novel ways of improving the\nmortality rates and neurological outcomes,\nin patients with cardiac arrest and ROSC.\nAlthough the use of defibrillators and the\nincreased number of individuals trained in\nCPR have improved survivorship,17\nFigure 3.

The guidelines indi-\ncate the knowledge gaps regarding the opti-\nmal temperature, treatment method, disease\nonset, treatment duration and rewarming\nrate; therefore, further investigation is\nrequired to determine the benefit of post-\ncardiac arrest therapeutic hypothermia after\nnonshockable and in-hospital cardiac arrest.\ntigating the role of hypothermia in patients\nwith ROSC after cardiac arrest were pub-\nlished. Kim and coworkers9 investigated\nwhether prehospital intravenous cooling\ncould improve mortality and neurological\noutcomes in 688 patients after resuscitation\nfrom cardiac arrest, with both shockable and\nnonshockable rhythms, compared with 671\npatients with in-hospital cooling only.\nHowever, this study was not included in the\npresent meta-analysis as both groups of\npatients received mild hypothermia. In\nanother study by Nielsen et al.,8 939 uncon-\nscious patients were randomized to receive\nnormo- or hypothermia after cardiac arrest\nresuscitation on hospital admission within\n240 min of ROSC. The vast majority of the\npatients presented with a shockable rhythm.\nIn both studies, the authors found no\nsignificant between-group differences in\nmortality or neurological function. These\nresults were also consistent in all the sub-\ngroups analysed.\nThe results of the present meta-analysis\nare consistent with the large study by Nielsen\net al.,8 showing no protective effects on\nmortality or neurological outcomes asso-\nciated with mild hypothermia. However,\nin the meta-analysis were from the study of\nNielsen et al.,8 it had greater statistical\nweight. Therefore, limitations of this single\nstudy should also be considered in the meta-\nanalysis; these included investigator aware-\nness of the treatments assigned to patients,\nuse of unknown sedatives and neuromuscu-\nlar blocking agents, methods of hypothermia\ninduction and goal threshold temperatures.\nIt cannot be excluded that possible rea-\nsons for the lack of benefits from hypother-\nmia are the large patient heterogeneity and\nconsiderable advances in patient care over\nthe last 10 years. The mortality rate was\n48% in the Hypothermia after Cardiac\nonly shockable presenting rhythm); how-\never, in the most recent trial by Kim et al.9 in\n2014, though not included in the present\nmeta-analysis, the overall mortality in a\nsimilar population was 36%. In addition,\nas Rittenberger and Callaway29 highlighted\nin their editorial, most studies prior to\nNielsen et al.8 were influenced by the fact\nthat the most common cause of death was\nabandonment of life support because of\nperceived poor neurological prognosis,\nwhich is not certain in the long term. A\nfurther limitation of the meta-analysis is a\npossible selection bias in the trials chosen\nbecause of the English-language restriction.\nIt should also be noted that the control\ngroups were quite heterogeneous in the\ntreatment they received: the control group\nin Nielsen et al.8 received controlled\ntemperature management targeted to\n36C, whereas other groups received no\ntemperature control (normothermia)11 or a\nmedian bladder temperature targeted to\nIn conclusion, according to data from\nseven randomized controlled trials reviewed\nin the present meta-analysis, the induction\nof mild hypothermia seems to have no role\nin reducing mortality rates or ameliorating\nlong-term neurological outcomes in patients\nwith ROSC after cardiac arrest, regardless\nof the timing of the initiation (pre- or in-\nhospital).\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis study was supported in part by the young\nand middle-aged scientific research funds of\nWannan Medical College, Wuhu, China (no.\nReferences\n1.
