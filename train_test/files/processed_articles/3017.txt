These associa-\ntions were not significantly influenced by the inclusion\nor exclusion of respondents with mania. Temporally pri-\nmary depression predicted a first onset of subsequentpanic\nattacks but not of panic disorder. Temporally primary\npanic attacks, with or without panic disorder and\nwhether or not the panic was persistent, predicted a\nfirst onset of subsequent major depression. The asso-\nciations between panic attack and depression were\nattenuated in models that controlled for prior trau-\nmatic life experiences and histories of other DSM-III-R\ndisorders.\nConclusions: Lifetime panic-depression comorbidity\ncharacterizes most community respondents with panic\ndisorder and a substantial few of those with major de-\npression. The absence of a dose-response relationship sug-\ngests that primary panic attack is a marker, rather than a\ncausal risk factor, of subsequent depression. Primary de-\npression, in comparison, appears to be a genuine risk fac-\ntor for secondary panic attacks. That primary depres-\nsion predicts panic attacks but not panic disorder suggests\nthat secondary panic is a severity marker of depression\nrather than a comorbid condition. These results are far\nfrom definitive because they are based on retrospective\nreports, lay-administered diagnostic interviews, and only\n1 survey.

In addition, co-\nmorbid panic-depression generally does\nnot aggregate separately from pure panic\nor pure depression in family studies.15-17\nAs a result, most cases of panic-depres-\nsion are thought to represent comorbid-\nity, whereas a smaller number might rep-\nThe following 3 logical possibilities\ncould explain this comorbidity: depres-\nsion is a causal risk factor for panic dis-\norder, panic disorder is a causal risk fac-\ntor for depression, or panic disorder and\nFrom the Department of Health\nCare Policy, Harvard Medical\nSchool, Boston, Mass\n(Dr Kessler and Ms Walters);\nthe Department of\nEpidemiology, University of\nNorth Carolina, Chapel Hill,\nand SmithKline Beecham\nPharmaceuticals, Philadelphia,\nPa (Dr Stang); the Department\nof Clinical Psychology, Max\nPlanck Institute of\nPsychiatry\u00adClinical Institute,\nMunich, Germany\n(Dr Wittchen); the World\nHealth Organization, Geneva,\nSwitzerland (Dr Ustun); and\nthe Department of Psychiatry\nand Behavioral Sciences,\nUniversity of Washington\nSchool of Medicine, Seattle\n(Dr Roy-Burne).\n\u00a91998 American Medical Association.

Persistent anxiety has\nbeen postulated20 to lead to an exhaustion response and\ndepression, a finding consistent with panic causing de-\npression. Furthermore, most anxious-depressed pa-\ntients report that their anxiety started at an earlier age\nthan their depression,21,22 suggesting a dose-response re-\nlationship between panic disorder and subsequent de-\npression.

If this is the case, the risk\nof depression after panic attacks or panic disorder should\nincrease with the duration of the panic. We would also\nexpect that only current panic, rather than a history of\nremitted panic, would predict a first onset of depres-\nsion. If, on the other hand, panic is merely a phase in a\ndistinct biologically determined panic-depressive disor-\nder, we would expect that the risk of a first episode of\ndepression is associated as strongly with a history of\npanic as with active panic and is not related to duration.\nNo previous epidemiological study has examined these\npatterns.\nWe also evaluate the possibility that panic-de-\npression comorbidity is due, at least in part, to common\ncauses. Several possibilities exist, including neurobio-\nlogical vulnerabilities,9 temperament,26 and stressful life\nexperiences.27 Epidemiological research has been most\nSUBJECTS\nThe NCS is a nationally representative household survey\nof persons aged 15 to 54 years along with a representative\nsample of students living in campus group housing.

The exceptions were mania35 and nonaffec-\ntive psychosis,36 neither of which was assessed with ac-\nceptable validity in the CIDI. Because separate clinical re-\nappraisal interviews were carried out for each diagnosis,\nno data are available on the CIDI's accuracy in discrimi-\nnating between unipolar and bipolar depression or be-\ntween depression and panic. Data on the validity of the dis-\ntinction between panic attacks and panic disorder are also\nnot available because the validity study focused on panic\nattacks only. The distinction between panic attacks with\nand without panic disorder was based on respondents re-\nporting 4 or more attacks in a single month or persistent\nworry for a month or longer about having another attack.\nThe absence of such data is a limitation of the results re-\nported in this article.\nThe World Health Organization field trials also found\ngood test-retest reliability--but only marginally accept-\nable validity compared with clinician assessments--of ret-\nrospective diagnostic age-at-onset reports in the CIDI.37 This\nis an important limitation because age-at-onset reports play\na central role in the analysis of temporal priorities. To im-\nprove the accuracy of these reports in the NCS, the stan-\ndard CIDI age-at-onset question, which simply asks re-\nspondents how old they were when they first had an episode\nof depression, a panic attack, or a cluster of 4 panic at-\ntacks in a single month, was elaborated into a series of 4\nmore-focused questions. For the first question, respon-\ndents were asked if they could \"clearly remember [empha-\nsis in original]\" the exact age when they had their first epi-\nsode, attack, or attack cluster. If they answered yes, that\nage was recorded. If they answered no, they were asked their\napproximate age at onset: \"about [emphasis in original] how\nold were you the first time?\" They were then asked for \"the\nearliest age you can clearly remember [emphasis in origi-\nnal]\" a particular episode or attack or attack cluster. The\nresponse was taken as an upper bound on the respon-\ndent's age at onset.\nNo data to assess the validity of the age-at-onset re-\nports based on this 4-question series were obtained in the\nNCS clinical reappraisal study. However, substantively im-\nplausible associations between the age at interview and the\nreported age at onset found in surveys that used the stan-\ndard CIDI age-at-onset question38 do not exist in the NCS,39\nindirectly arguing for improved validity.

Only ages of first\noccurrence, not of subsequent recurrences, were re-\ncorded, so the assessment of these experiences is incom-\nplete. Nonetheless, the available data provide a useful way\nof assessing the role of traumatic experiences in bringing\nabout panic-depression comorbidity.

Retrospective age-at-onset reports\nwere used to study temporal priorities between first on-\nsets of panic and of depression.

In this method, each year in\nthe life of each respondent up to and including the year of\nonset of the outcome disorder or the year of the interview,\nwhichever comes first, is treated as a separate observa-\ntional record. Logistic regression is used to predict a\ndichotomous measure of the onset of the outcome disor-\nder (coded 1 for the year of onset and 0 for prior years) in\nthis person-year file. When controls are introduced for\nage at the time of the observational record, the logistic\nregression coefficients can be interpreted as survival coef-\nficients in a model that allows nonproportional hazards.42\nThese coefficients can also be exponentiated to generate\nORs. The predictors can be either unrelated to time, such\nas sex or race, or time-varying, such as marital status or a\nhistory of other disorders as of the age of the observa-\ntional record.\nIn our use of this method, we estimated a separate se-\nries of discrete-time survival models to predict the life-\ntime first onset of 3 outcomes: panic attack, panic disor-\nder, and major depressive episode. In each model, we\nincluded controls for age in the person-year, age at inter-\nview, sex, and race. The predictors of primary interest were\ntime-varying measures of the prior onset and continua-\ntion of the other disorders. These were \"time-varying\" be-\ncause they were coded as not present for the observational\nrecords for a particular respondent up to the age at onset\nof the predictor disorder and then coded as present in sub-\nsequent observational records. We also created predictor\nvariables for time since the first onset of the predictor dis-\norder. Furthermore, we used respondent data about the age\nof recency of each disorder to create predictor variables.\nThis allowed us to distinguish between observational rec-\nords with a history of the predictor disorder that had ended\nat an earlier age and records with a history of the disorder\nthat had not ended.\nSignificance tests for individual ORs were computed\nusing the method of jackknife repeated replications43 to es-\ntimate SEs that adjusted for design effects introduced by\nclustering and weighting of observations.

Among the 157 respondents with lifetime panic\ndisorder and depression, with the age at onset of panic\ndisorder dated as the age of the first cluster of 4 attacks\nin a 4-week period or the first month of persistent worry\nabout having another attack, 75 (48.0%) reported that\nthe depression started at an earlier age than the panic dis-\norder, 48 (30.6%) said that the depression and panic dis-\norder started at the same age, and 34 (21.5%) said that\nthe panic disorder started at an earlier age than the first\ndepressive episode.\nWe began by using information about prior depression\nto predict the first onset of a panic attack (with or with-\nout panic disorder) and then carried out a parallel analy-\nsis to predict the first onset of panic disorder in the sub-\nsample of observational records for persons with a history\nof panic attacks. No evidence was found for an effect of\ndepression in predicting panic disorder after the onset\nof a first panic attack. Therefore, we focused further ef-\nforts on the prediction of a first panic attack. Two im-\nportant results emerged. First, the persistence of depres-\nsion is necessary to predict a panic attack. That is, people\nwho reported a history of temporally primary depres-\nsion but said that their last episode ended in, eg, year Y+5,\nhad a significantly elevated risk of a first onset of panic\nattack in the 5-year interval between Y (signifies year)\nand Y+5 but (assuming they did not have an onset in this\ninterval) no longer had an elevated risk beginning in year\nY+6. This implies that active depression rather than a his-\ntory of depression predicts a panic attack. Second, the\neffect of depression in predicting panic attack does not\nvary significantly with time since the first onset.\nThe parameter estimates in the final model are\nreported in the first column of Table 1 (referred to as\nmodel 1). The effects of depression are differentiated by\nthe time since onset. The OR for the first onset of\ndepression in the same year as respondents had their\nfirst panic attack is large (25.9), and the ORs for the\nfirst onset of panic attack in subsequent years are\nThe results for model 2 in Table 1 are the ORs for\nthe same predictor variables in a model that introduces\na control for mania. These results suggest that mania does\nnot play a major part in the association between depres-\nsion and a subsequent first onset of panic attack. As stated\npreviously, however, mania is not assessed with accept-\nable validity in the CIDI due to its substantial overdiag-\nnosing of the disorder.35 To address this problem, we rep-\nlicated model 1 after excluding respondents who were\nclassified by the CIDI as having a history of mania. The\nresults (not shown) were similar to those reported in Table\nThe results for model 3 are the ORs for the same pre-\ndictor variables in a model that introduces controls for\nmania and also for the 22 lifetime traumatic experiences\ndescribed earlier (see the \"Risk Factors\" subsection of the\n\"Subjects and Methods\" section). Each of the ORs is\nsmaller than those in model 2, which means that the ex-\nperiences considered here explain part of the associa-\ntion between temporally primary depression and a sub-\nsequent panic attack. We also estimated models that\ndistinguished the effects of traumatic life experiences that\noccurred before vs later than the first onset of depres-\nsion and included multiplicative interactions between de-\npression and the traumas. No more of these interactions\nwere significant than we would expect on the basis of\nchance.\nFinally, the results for model 4 are the ORs for\nthe same predictor variables in a model that includes\ncontrols for mania, the 22 traumatic experiences, and\nall other NCS or DSM-III-R disorders that occurred\nbefore the first onset of panic attack. This model con-\ntrols for such mediating processes as that linking pri-\nmary depression to secondary panic attacks through\naddiction. The cross-sectional OR is statistically sig-\nnificant but considerably smaller than in model 1,\nwhereas the time-lagged ORs are no longer statistically\nsignificant in panic with onset delays of 6 years or\nmore.

First, a strong relationship was found\nbetween the severity of primary depression, as indi-\ncated by the number of symptoms, and the odds of sub-\nsequent panic. Second, approximately half of respon-\ndents with depression followed by panic attack had at\nleast 1 other anxiety disorder before the depression. These\nearlier anxiety disorders are significant predictors of de-\npression and of panic attack after depression. No evi-\ndence was found for a significant interaction between de-\npression and prior anxiety in predicting panic attack.\nThird, a significant interaction was found between life\nstage and prior depression in predicting panic attack, with\nthe effect of depression increasing with age.\nParallel discrete-time survival models were used to study\nthe time-lagged relationship between temporally pri-\nmary panic and subsequent depression. The least com-\nplex models included controls plus separate time-\nvarying effects of panic attack (with or without panic\ndisorder) and panic disorder. The cross-sectional asso-\nciations involving panic attack and disorder were sig-\nnificant, as was the time-lagged association for panic at-\ntack. No significant time-lagged association was found\nfor panic disorder, however.\nMore detailed models were then estimated to ex-\nplore the effects of persistence and time since the first\nonset of panic attacks. Three important results emerged.\nFirst, the persistence of panic attacks is not necessary to\npredict the subsequent first onset of depression. For in-\nstance, people who reported a history of temporally pri-\nmary panic attack but said that their last attack was in\nyear Y+5 not only had a significantly elevated risk of a\nfirst episode of depression in the interval between Y and\nY+5 but (assuming that they did not have an onset in this\ninterval) they also had the same elevated risk beginning\nin year Y+6. This implies that it is a history of panic rather\nthan active panic that predicts a subsequent first onset\nof depression. Second, the time-lagged effect of panic at-\ntack does not vary with the time since the first onset.\nThird, no meaningful association was found between life\nstage and panic in predicting the subsequent first onset\nof depression.\nThe parameter estimates for the final model are re-\nported in the first column of Table 2 (referred to as model\n1). The OR for the first onset of depression in the same\nyear as a first panic attack is large (16.5), and the ORs\nfor the onset of depression in the same year as panic dis-\norder (3.1) and in the years after the onset of panic at-\ntack are smaller (between 2.8 and 4.8). Significance tests\nfor time trends found no evidence that the time-lagged\ncoefficients change significantly with the time since the\nonset.\nThe results for model 2 are the ORs for the same pre-\ndictor variables in a model that introduces controls for\nmania. The ORs are consistently lower than in model 1,\ndemonstrating that mania plays at least some role in the\nassociation between temporally primary panic and the\nsubsequent first onset of depression. When all persons\nwith mania according to the CIDI are excluded from the\nanalysis and model 1 is estimated in this restricted sample,\nresults (not shown) are similar to those shown in Table\nThe results for model 3 are the ORs for the same pre-\ndictor variables in a model that controls for mania and\nfor the 22 lifetime traumatic experiences described ear-\nlier. All of the ORs are somewhat smaller than in model\n2 but remain consistently significant at .05. More de-\ntailed analyses were carried out to distinguish the ef-\nfects of traumatic experiences before vs later than the first\nonset of panic attack and panic disorder and to examine\nmultiplicative interactions between panic and these ex-\nperiences, but no more of these interactions were sig-\nnificant than we would expect on the basis of chance.\nTable 2.

No significant interactions were found be-\ntween prior disorders and panic in predicting a subse-\nquent first onset of depression.\nCOMMENT\nWe note 3 important limitations of this study. First, the\nNCS is a cross-sectional survey. This means that all\ninferences about temporal ordering are based on retro-\nspective reports. Recall bias or sample selection bias\ncould distort estimated relationships. That results hold\nup in subsamples differing in age at onset argues indi-\nrectly against a strong effect of recall bias. A definitive\nevaluation will require replication in a prospective\nstudy. Second, the CIDI is a lay-administered diagnostic\ninterview that imperfectly captures the diagnostic dis-\ntinctions made by experienced clinicians. The evidence\nof consistency in the CIDI with independent clinical\ndiagnoses argues against a pervasive bias, but impreci-\nsion in distinguishing panic attack from panic disorder\nor panic from depression might play a part in the\nresults. Third, the CIDI focuses largely on lifetime dis-\norders. Consequently, we have been concerned here\nwith the temporal ordering of first onsets, with no focus\non the order of the onset of panic and depression in\nparticular episodes. There is no indication that tempo-\nral priority in a first onset will tell us much about tem-\nporal priority in episodes.\nIn the context of these limitations, the pattern of life-\ntime comorbidity reported is similar to that found in pre-\nvious epidemiological studies7,46 in showing depression\nin most of those with panic and panic in a substantial\nfew of those with depression. In addition, we find strong\nreciprocal predictive relationships between panic attack\nand depression. About half of respondents with lifetime\npanic-depression have at least 1 other prior anxiety dis-\norder. This means that panic-depression is often part of\na larger anxious-depression syndrome in which another\nanxiety disorder is temporally primary. This larger syn-\ndrome, which has not been examined in this report, war-\nrants detailed examination in future research.\nThe results regarding temporal priority between\npanic and depression might appear to be at odds with\nmost of the literature because previous studies21,22 have\nconsistently found that anxiety usually begins at an ear-\nlier age than depression among people with lifetime\ncomorbidity. The NCS data yield the same result when\nanxiety is analyzed in the aggregate, as it has been in\nmost previous epidemiological studies.47 This is because\nearly-onset phobias are the temporally primary disor-\nders in most patients with lifetime comorbid anxiety\nand depression. The situation is different for panic-\ndepression comorbidity both in the NCS and in the few\nother epidemiological surveys7,22,48 that have focused on\nthis particular type of anxiety-depression comorbidity.\nWhen we define the onset of panic as the age of the first\nattack, depression occurring before panic is only\nslightly less common than panic occurring before\ndepression. Furthermore, when we focus on the age at\nonset of a panic disorder rather than the age at onset of\na first panic attack, depression occurring before panic is\nmuch more common than panic occurring before\ndepression.\nAlthough the NCS results regarding temporal pri-\nority are consistent with previous research, they contra-\ndict the assumptions of earlier studies in 2 important ways.\nFirst, the temporal priority of anxiety before depression\nhas been previously interpreted as meaning that the tran-\nsition is stronger from pure anxiety than from pure de-\npression to anxious-depression.49,50 Our more subtle analy-\nsis shows that gross time-lagged effects are similar in\nmagnitude for temporally primary panic attack predict-\ning a subsequent first onset of depression and for tem-\nporally primary depression predicting a subsequent first\nonset of panic attack.\nSecond, the implicit assumption in all previous\nresearch on panic-depression comorbidity has been that\npanic disorder rather than panic attack is comorbid\nwith depression. We found the opposite to be true.\nBecause panic attacks are generally conceptualized as\nnonspecific severity markers, it is not clear that the\nassociation between panic attacks and depression\nshould be conceptualized as a comorbidity. As a result,\nthis finding, if it is replicated in independent data sets,\nwill require a fundamental rethinking of the meaning of\npanic-depression comorbidity. There is an important\nexception to the general finding that depression is\nrelated to panic attack but not panic disorder. A sig-\nnificant cross-sectional relationship exists between\npanic disorder and depression. This pattern character-\nizes nearly a third of respondents with the lifetime co-\noccurrence of panic disorder and major depression, and\nthese respondents conceivably represent a distinct\nsubtype.\nWhen we focus on the association between panic\nattacks and depression, important time-lagged asymme-\ntries emerge that raise questions about whether the un-\nderlying causes might differ depending on which is tem-\nporally primary. In the case of depression before panic\nattack, that the time-lagged relationship is no longer sig-\nnificant for patients with remitted depression is consis-\ntent with treatment studies that have failed to docu-\nment an association between remitted depression and the\nseverity of current panic attacks.51,52 This result, in con-\njunction with the relationship between the number of de-\npressive symptoms and the risk of a subsequent panic\nattack, suggests that secondary panic might be a sever-\nity marker of depression rather than a comorbid condi-\ntion. If this is true, it is not clear why there is no rela-\ntionship between the number of years of depression and\nthe risk of a subsequent panic attack. Further research\nneeds to determine whether this specification replicates\nin other data sets and, if so, to look for explanatory\nor mediating variables that might make sense of this\nphenomenon.\nThe situation is different for panic before depres-\nsion, where the data suggest that panic attack is a proxy\nfor some other underlying causal risk factor. This con-\nclusion is based on 3 observations indicating the\n\u00a91998 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.\nabsence of a dose-response relationship. The first is that\nrespondents with a history of panic attack have the\nsame elevated risk of subsequent depression whether\ntheir panic is remitted or active. It is possible to make\nsense of this while maintaining the view that panic\ncauses depression by suggesting that consequences of\npanic that persist after the attacks have ended, such as\navoidance, secondary agoraphobia, and secondary sub-\nstance abuse, lead to depression. This interpretation is\nalso consistent with the finding that the time-lagged\nassociations between a primary panic attack and subse-\nquent depression are statistically insignificant in model\n4 of Table 2, which controls for other disorders. It is\nmore difficult to offer a similar interpretation of the\nobservations that panic attack, but not panic disorder,\npredicts a subsequent first onset of depression and that\nthe duration of the primary panic attack is unrelated to\nthe risk of a subsequent first onset of depression. These\nresults are more consistent with the view that panic\nattack is a marker of some cluster of risk factors of both\npanic and depression. These results demonstrate that\nclinicians should be aware that their patients with a his-\ntory of panic attacks, whether or not the panic is active,\nare at risk of subsequent depression. More focused\nresearch, using longitudinal and family-genetic designs,\nis needed to sort out the causal pathways involved in\nthis risk to develop a rational strategy for preventing\nsubsequent depression.\nof Mental Health, Rockville, Md, with supplemental sup-\nport to grant MH46376 from the National Institute of Drug\nFoundation, New York, NY (Dr Kessler).
