    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: Frailty represents an increased vulnerability to external stressors due to decreased physiological\nreserve and dysfunction in multiple bodily systems. The relationship between frailty and mortality has been\nwell-documented in the literature. However, less is known about the predictive powers of frailty index and its\ncomponents on mortality when they are simultaneously present. This study aimed to examine the predictive\npowers of frailty index and its multiple components on mortality in a nationally representative sample of older\nadults in China.\nLongitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS). Frailty was measured using the cumulative deficit approach, and\nwas constructed from 38 health variables (39 deficits). We selected 8 major sets of components: activities of daily\nliving (ADL) (6 deficits), instrumental ADL (IADL) (8 deficits), functional limitations (5 deficits), overall cognitive\nfunctioning (1 deficit), chronic disease conditions (11 deficits), self-reported health (2 deficits), hearing and vision\nimpairment (2 deficits), and psychological distress (1 deficit). Survival analysis was used to examine the roles of the\nfrailty and its components in mortality.\nResults: Results showed that almost all the components of the frailty index (except chronic diseases) were significant\npredictors of mortality when examined individually. Among the components, ADL and IADL disabilities remained\nsignificant when considering all the components simultaneously. When the frailty and its components were\nsimultaneously analyzed, the frailty remained a robust predictor of mortality across the age and sex groups, while most\ncomponents lost their significance except ADL, IADL, and cognitive function components in some cases.\nConclusions: Frailty measured by cumulative deficits has a stronger predictive power on mortality than its all individual\ncomponents. ADL and IADL disability play a greater role in mortality than other components when considering all the\ncomponents of frailty.\n",

Frailty represents multifactorial vulnerability to\nexternal stressors due to decreased physiological reserve\nand dysregulation in multiple bodily systems [1, 3, 5\u00ad8].\nDespite the heated discussion on this topic, there is no\nconsensus regarding the measures of frailty [1, 3, 9].\nHowever, there are two widely used models to measure\nfrailty: one is the phenotype model and the other is the\nhealth deficit accumulation model. The former assesses\nfrailty using five specific manifest indicators, including\nunintentional weight loss, exhaustion, low physical ac-\ntivity, slowness, and weakness [1]. The latter measures\nfrailty using the proportion of present deficits to all\nthe possible health deficits in physical, functional, and\npsychosocial domains for a given person, or frailty\nindex [3, 7, 10]. Different from the phenotype model,\n* Correspondence: gudanan@yahoo.com\n2United Nations Population Division, Two UN Plaza, DC2-1910, New York, NY\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\n\u00a9 2016 The Author(s).

For instance, empirical research has shown that\nfrailty index predicts mortality in general older populations\nand even in centenarians, for both women and men [2, 6,\n10, 12], and in older adults from different cultural back-\nRegarding the variables used to construct frailty index,\nseveral criteria have to be met. The variables should cover\na range of health deficits, the prevalence of the overall def-\nicits should generally increase with age, and they should\nnot saturate too early [16]. So far, the following compo-\nnents have been commonly used to construct frailty index:\ncognitive impairment, chronic illness, disability in activ-\nities of daily living (ADL), disability in instrumental activ-\nities of daily living (IADL), functional limitation, self-rated\nhealth, chronic disease conditions, hearing and vision\nSome studies have also included biomarkers in the index\n[17, 18]. However, this cumulative deficit approach does\nnot necessarily require the same number or the same set\nof variables for construction of the index because the in-\ndexes could yield comparable results as long as the vari-\nable list includes the main health domains [4, 16, 19].\nOne advantage of frailty index is that it incorporates a\nvariety of health deficits whose individual contributions to\nhealth and mortality risks may be too small to be detect-\nable, and a combination of these deficits into a single\nindex could enhance its explanatory power [10, 20]. How-\never, some studies have also showed that the significance\nof some components clustered in a few major domains of\nthe frailty index in determining mortality is noticeable.\nFor instance, Gu found that when excluding eight IADL\ndisability items from the frailty index list that included 39\nfrailty items from a nationwide survey in China, the pre-\ndictive power of the frailty index from 31 remaining defi-\ncits on mortality was reduced, and that it was also the\ntrue for the case where a frailty index was generated from\nthe randomly selected half of the variables from the list of\nthirty-nine items. In all other cases, the reduced predictive\npower was small [19]. Theou and colleagues found that\nthe frailty index including disability and co-morbidity in-\ncreased its predictive power for mortality than the index ex-\ncluding disability and co-morbidity [20]. To the best of our\nknowledge, these studies are among the first that provided\nempirical evidence about comparisons of relative predictive\npower for mortality between the frailty index and its com-\nponents, which have improved our understanding about\nthe frailty index and its components in predicting subse-\nquent mortality at old ages.\nHowever, no studies have systematically examined the\npredictive power of the frailty index on mortality compared\nto that of its components in the literature. Researchers have\nargued that the frailty index is a \"macroscopic variable\" that\nrepresents general organism damage of an individual rather\nthan any specific health deficiency [3, 5]. Thus, despite the\nwell-established relationship between the frailty index and\nmortality, it remains largely unknown which component of\nthe frailty index is significantly associated with mortality\nand whether the frailty index still is a significant predictor\nof mortality in presence of its components, and vice versa.\nThe current study aims to address these research gaps.\nMore specifically, we aim to examine the specific associ-\nation between each component of the frailty index and\nmortality, and the association between the frailty index and\nmortality in a nationally representative sample of older\nadults in mainland China (hereafter China). Despite in-\ncreasing research on frailty in developed countries, it is\nunder-studied in developing countries, like China. Examin-\nation on frailty in Chinese older adults could better inform\nthe eldercare policy-making and interventions.\nMethods\nStudy sample\nthe Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey\n(CLHLS). The CLHLS was initiated in 1998, and is the\nfirst national longitudinal project to investigate the\ndeterminants of health and longevity of older adults in\nChina from a multidisciplinary perspective. One signifi-\ncant characteristics of the project is that it has the lar-\ngest sample of the oldest old so far from a developing\ncountry, which could enable a better understanding of\nhuman healthy longevity. The CLHLS was conducted\nthrough in-home interviews with extensive information\ncollected in half of the randomly selected cities/counties\nin 22 out of 31 provinces in China. The CLHLS aims to\ninterview all centenarians in the sampled cities/counties.\nAge of each centenarian was validated based on various\nsources whenever available, including birth certificate,\ngenealogical documents, household booklet, and ages of\ntheir children and siblings [21]. For each centenarian\ninterviewee, one nearby octogenarian and one nearby\nnonagenarian (living in either a community or an institu-\ntion) with pre-designated age and sex were randomly\ninterviewed; and for every three centenarians, four partici-\npants aged 65\u00ad79 (living in either a community or an in-\nstitution) were randomly chosen based on a random code\nassigned to the centenarian in the same cities/counties\nwhere centenarians were living at the time of survey. Each\nrespondent provided a written informed consent to indi-\ncate his/her willingness to participate in the CLHLS. The\ninformed consent was signed by the next-of-kin if the re-\nspondent was not able to write. The CLHLS has collected\ninformation on demographics, family and household charac-\nteristics, health behaviors and lifestyles, economic resources,\nself-rated health and life satisfaction, cognitive functioning,\nphysical examination, activities of daily living and instru-\nmental activities of daily living, and chronic illness. More de-\ntails about the sampling procedures and data collected can\nbe found elsewhere [21\u00ad23], thus not presented herein.\nwere lost to follow-up. A comparison between those lost\nto follow-up and those included in the analysis found that\nparticipants who were older, Han-ethnicity, living in the\nurban areas, financially independent, or frailer were more\nthose who were married and currently smoking were less\nlikely to be lost to follow-up (results available upon re-\nquest). The dates of death for deceased participants were\ncollected from various informants, such as next of kin, ne-\nighbors, neighborhood committees, and death certificate\nwhenever available. Systematical assessments for the ac-\ncuracy of age reporting, the randomness of attrition, the\nreliability, validity, and the consistency of numerous mea-\nsures of health outcomes and mortality of the CLHLS\nwere performed and the data quality was high [21\u00ad23].\nMeasurements\nFrailty index\nIn this study, frailty index was measured by the proportion\nof the number of health deficits presented to the total num-\nber of possible health deficits for a given person. The score\nrange of the index was from 0 to 1 in this study, with higher\nscores denoting higher level of frailty. The indicator included\n39 deficits from a total of 38 indicators encompassing self-\nrated health, cognitive functioning, ADL disability, IADL dis-\nability, functional limitations, hearing and vision impair-\nments, chronic disease conditions, serious illness measured\nby being hospitalized or bedridden, psychological distress,\nand so forth. If an individual experiences more than one ser-\nious illness in the past 2 years, an additional deficit score is\nassigned to this person [2, 5, 6]. These indicators are similar\nto those used in previous research [2, 6, 10, 15]. Following\nthe scoring method in the literature [2, 5, 6], each deficit was\ncoded as 1 when it was present, and 0 when it was absent.\nHowever, as noted below, we did not use the 0 ~ 1 range for\nthe index in regression models. Instead we used the number\nof deficits to measure the level of frailty of a given respond-\nent for the purpose to be consistent with its components.\nComponents of the frailty index\nWe have selected following 8 major sets of the components:\ncognitive functioning, chronic diseases, ADL disability, IADL\ndisability, functional limitations, self-rated health, hearing or\nvision impairment, and psychological distress, which have\nbeen frequently used in constructing frailty index in the lit-\ntioning was measured by a Chinese version of the Mini-\nMental State Examination (MMSE) with a total score of 30,\nand respondents with a score of 23 or lower were considered\nas cognitively impaired [21\u00ad23]. Chronic diseases were mea-\nsured by older adults' self-reports from a list of 11 illnesses\n(e.g., diabetes, heart disease, stroke, hypertension, cancer).\nADL disability and IADL disability were assessed by whether\na respondent needed any assistance in performing six basic\ndaily activities (e.g., bathing, dressing) and 8 activities that\nare important for independent living (e.g., cooking, shop-\nping), respectively. Functional limitations were measured by\nfive objective examinations, such as hand behind lower back,\nraising arms upright, standing from sitting a chair. Psycho-\nlogical distress was a single item used in constructing the\nfrailty index. We defined a respondent to experience psycho-\nlogical distress if he or she often/always felt fearful/anxious,\nlonely/isolated, or useless. Self-rated health was constructed\nby two items including current self-assessed global health\nand the health status of the respondent compared with one\nyear ago. Considering cerebrovascular and cardiovascular\ndiseases are leading cause of mortality in China [24], we also\ngenerated another component by separating stroke and\nheart diseases from the rest of chronic diseases and explored\ntheir role in predicting mortality. Thus, in the analyses, there\nwere nine sets of components in total.\nCovariates\nBased on previous literature [2, 5, 6, 10], we included the\nfollowing covariates to obtain more robust results: age,\nethnicity (Han vs. Non-Han), current urban/rural resi-\ndence (urban vs. rural), marital status (currently married\nvs. no), education (one or more years of education vs. no\nschooling), lifetime primary occupation (white-collar oc-\ncupation vs. all other occupations), economic independ-\nence (primary financial source from retirement wages or\nwork vs. other sources), economic status (family economic\nstatus is rich or very rich in local community vs. others),\nco-residence with family members (yes vs. no), and health\nbehaviors measured by current smoking (yes vs. no) and\nregular exercise (yes vs. no). Gender was not included as a\ncovariate since all the analyses were stratified by sex.\nAnalytical strategy\nFirst, we presented the sample descriptive statistics by age\nsex. Second, we examined the predictive powers of the frailty\nindex and each of its components on mortality by age\ngroups and sex. Four regression models were designed.\nModel I controlled for age and ethnicity. Model II further\ncontrolled for all the other covariates listed in Table 1. Model\nIII additionally controlled for all the other frailty compo-\nnents. Model IV added the frailty scores into Model II. To\nkeep consistent with its components and better understand\nthe association between the frailty and mortality in compari-\nson to associations between its components and mortality,\nwe used the number of cumulative deficits (ranging from 0\nto 39), rather than the frailty index (ranging from 0 to 1) to\nrepresent the level of frailty of a given individual.\nIn the analyses, we used the Weibull hazard regression\nmodels to examine the predictive powers of frailty scores\nand its components on mortality. Mortality risk was the\ndependent variable of the survival analysis in the study,\nwhich was indicated by survival status and the duration of\nexposure to death. The number of days from the date of the\nlength of survival time. Those who were lost to follow-up in\nanalyses due to their unknown survival status and survival\nlength, which leaves the total valid sample of 13,731. Previ-\nous research shows that excluding those lost to follow-up in-\ntroduced little bias in the estimates [6], and our alternative\napproach including those lost to follow-up based on a mul-\ntiple imputation yielded similar results (not shown). The\nmultiple imputation assumed that those lost to follow-up\nhad the same survival status and survival length from 2008/\nif individuals in the former group had the same demograph-\nics, socioeconomic status, family/social support, health be-\nhaviors, and health conditions as those in the latter group.\nWe also checked the collinearity among components\nand the variance inflation factors (VIF) were all less than\n2 when all components were presented in the model,\nwhich is below the criterion (VIF > =10) [25], indicating\nthat the collinearity problem is not a big issue in the\npresent study. The analyses were stratified by age and\nsex due to the well-established evidence on age and sex\nthe analyses were performed using Stata version 12.0.\nTotal Age groups Sexes\nNote (1) unweighted.

With respect to the covari-\nates, the majority of respondents were Han-ethnicity\n(93.4 %) and coresided with their family members\nlived in the urban areas, and 36.2 % attained 1+ year\neducation. About 23.5 % of the respondents reported fi-\nnancial independence, 13.2 % in a good economic status,\nexercise. We also observed gender differences, such that\nmen scored lower on the frailty index and almost all of\nits components than women, except for chronic diseases;\nthat is, men were in better health than women. In\naddition, men reported better social economic status,\nand had a higher proportion in smoking and doing regu-\nlar exercise than women. Figure 1 demonstrates the dis-\ntributions of the frailty index and its components by age\nand sex.\nTable 2 shows the hazard ratios of mortality from\nWeibull hazard models for the frailty and its compo-\nnents in men. Results (1st column) show that a higher\nscore of the frailty predicted a higher risk level of\nmortality across different age groups in Model I. For\ninstance, each additional deficit of the frailty increased\nthe odds of mortality by 5\u00ad10 %. In Model II, when\nadding other covariates, the mortality hazard ratios\nalmost had no change. With respect to the frailty index\ncomponents, results (columns 2 to 10) show that almost\nall the components significantly predicted a higher risk\nof mortality in all age groups with exceptions for chronic\ndiseases and heart diseases or stroke in Model I. For\nexample, each additional deficit in ADL disability, IADL\ndisability, functional limitations, self-rated poor health,\nand hearing and vision impairment increased the odds\n61 %, respectively. In Model II, these significant hazard\nratios were only slightly reduced when controlling for\nother covariates. In Model III, ADL disability and IADL\ndisability remained significant when adding all the other\ncomponents of the frailty index, while other components\nturned to be non-significant. In Model IV, when the\nfrailty was added into Model II (i.e., for each component\nFig. 1 Mean of the frailty index and average deficits of its components by age and sex\nmodel), the frailty remained significant across different\nage groups in all 9 sets of analyses for each of 9 compo-\nnents, whereas only the ADL disability and IADL disability\ncomponents were significant for certain age groups. In a\ntively associated with mortality.\nTable 3 shows the hazard ratios of mortality from Weibull\nhazard models for the frailty and its components in women,\nwith similar results as for men in Table 2. However, Table 3\nshows that there were stronger links between ADL disabil-\nity and cognitive impairment and mortality in women as\ncompared to those in men (see Models III and IV).\nDiscussion\nFrailty is an important concept in aging research and prac-\ntice, and it is a robust predictor of various health outcomes.\nHowever, less is known about the effects of the frailty index\nand its components on mortality among different older age\ngroups, especially in developing countries. This study ex-\ntended previous research and compared the predictive\npowers of the frailty index and its components on mortality\nin a nationally representative sample among different older\nage groups in China where mortality is relatively high and\nless resources are available to improve health for elderly\npopulation.\nWith respect to the predictive powers of frailty index\ncomponents on mortality, we found that most compo-\nnents (except for chronic diseases) significantly pre-\ndicted mortality when considered individually. These\nfindings are consistent with previous studies [26\u00ad33].\nThe possible reasons for the non-significant role of\nchronic diseases might be the underreport of the chronic\ndiseases, especially in rural areas of China, mainly due to\nunderdeveloped local health service system or older\nadults' poor health literacy [23]. Another possible reason\nis that we did not consider the severity of chronic dis-\neases, which is also an important factor for mortality\n[34]. Considering cerebrovacular and cardiovascular dis-\neases are leading causes of death in China [24], we ex-\namined the role of heart diseases or stroke in mortality,\nTable 2 Hazard ratios of 3-year mortality for frailty and its major selected frailty components by age group, CLHLS 2008/\nFrailty\nscores\nCognitive\nimpairment\nChronic\ndiseases\nHeart diseases\nor stroke\nADL\ndisability\nIADL\ndisability\nFunctional\nlimitations\nSelf-rated\npoor health\nHearing and vision\nimpairments\nPsychological\ndistress\nModel I set\nModel II set\nModel III set\nModel IV set\nNote.

(3)\nIn the case of heart diseases or stroke, the variable of the number of chronic diseases excluded these two types of diseases. In the cases of frailty and all other\nfrailty components, the variable \"heart diseases or stroke\" was excluded to avoid double control.

(5) *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p <0.001\nand the results were similar to those of chronic diseases\ncovering a wider range of illnesses. Future research is\nwarranted to shed light on this issue with more informa-\ntion on chronic diseases.\nWhen considering all the components simultaneously,\nonly ADL disability and IADL disability remained sig-\nnificant for both men and women, and cognitive im-\npairment remained significant for women, whereas\nother components were not significant. These findings\nsuggest that cognitive impairment (only for women),\nADL and IADL disability (for both men and women)\ncould partially explain the effects of other components\non mortality. In other words, other components play a\ntrivial role in determining mortality and will lose their\npredictivity when they are studied simultaneously with\nthese three components. The greater predictive power\nof ADL and IADL disabilities on mortality compared to\nother index components is in line with previous find-\nings [19, 20]. It is possible that ADL and IADL disabil-\nities play a more important role in mortality, and may\noverride the effects of other components, leading to\nnon-significance of other components [28]. Previous\nresearch shows that other components (except self-\nrated health) will likely cause ADL and IADL disabil-\nities, which makes ADL and IADL disabilities be more\nproximal predictors to mortality [27, 35]. These findings\nsuggest that some components may play a trivial role\nand lose its contribution to mortality when studied\nsimultaneously. The significant role of cognitive im-\npairment in predicting mortality in women indicates\ncognitive impairment is more lethal to women than to\nmen in relation to mortality. Literature has shown that\nwomen tend to have a higher prevalence of cognitive\nimpairment, disability, and chronic disease condition,\ndepression, yet low mortality risk [36], which may\ncause a greater association between cognitive impair-\nment and mortality in women than in men. Our finding\nis consistent with a recent study that found a greater attri-\nbution of cognitive impairment to mortality in women\nTable 3 Hazard ratios of 3-year mortality for frailty and its major selected frailty components by age group, CLHLS 2008/\nFrailty\nscores\nCognitive\nimpairment\nChronic\ndiseases\nHeart diseases\nor stroke\nADL\ndisability\nIADL\ndisability\nFunctional\nlimitations\nSelf-rated poor\nhealth\nHearing and vision\nPsychological\nModel I\nModel II\nModel III\nModel IV\nNote.

In the cases of frailty and all other\nfrailty components, the variable \"heart diseases or stroke\" was excluded to avoid double control. (4) anot applicable as frailty index was not included in Model III;\nIn addition to the examinations on frailty index com-\nponents, this study also shows that the frailty index\nremained a significant predictor of mortality across the\nage and sex groups when examining the frailty index\nonly, which corroborates previous studies [2, 5\u00ad7, 10,\n12\u00ad15]. We took a step further in the present study and\ncompared the relative predictive powers of the frailty\nindex and each of its components on mortality. We\nfound that the frailty index remained a robust predictor\nof mortality, whereas the effects of its components were\nless consistent. These results provided strong empirical\nevidence for the argument that frailty is more powerful\nin predicting mortality than its individual components\n[19, 20]. This also highlights the importance of using the\nfrailty index by accumulating different components into\na single index when examining the relationship between\nphysical health and mortality [10].\nSurprisingly, chronic diseases were found to be a pro-\ntective factor for mortality in both men and women when\nthe frailty index and covariates were simultaneously con-\ntrolled for. One possible reason might be due to the afore-\nmentioned underreport of the chronic diseases in older\nadults. Another speculation is that most people who\nreported to have chronic diseases got treated. Further-\nmore, older adults may change their unhealthy behaviors,\nor receive more social support and care from their family\nmembers when they were in illness, which might re-\nduce the adverse impact of chronic diseases on mortal-\nity [38, 39]. One study using data from a small local\narea in China obtained a similar association between\nchronic disease conditions and mortality [37].\nWhile stressing the advantages of the present research,\nits several limitations should be taken into account in\ninterpreting the results. First, about 17 % of the partici-\nnot at random, an alternative analysis that included\nthose lost to follow-up did not alter the conclusion.\nThus, our analysis would not bring a substantial bias in\nthe conclusion. Second, similar to other surveys on older\nadults, there was a proportion of missing values due to\nincreased age and declined cognitive abilities, proxies\nwere used to reduce non-response, which might intro-\nduce biases when there was inconsistency between proxy\nratings and those of the actual ratings of the partici-\npants. Further research is clearly warranted to shed light\non this issue. Third, the present study assumed that the\nassociations between each component and mortality and\nbetween the frailty index and mortality were linear.\nHowever, it is likely that the associations could be non-\nlinear, which deserves more research.\nOur study also identifies some future research direc-\ntions. For instance, this study only included variables in\nphysical, functional, and psychosocial domains, but not\nbiological or genetic domains. Recent research shows\nthat biomarkers (e.g., CRP, IL-6, TNF-alpha) are poten-\nwould be interesting to examine the relative predictive\npower of the biomarkers and frailty index on mortality.\nIn addition, given that ADL and IADL disabilities seem\nto play a greater role in mortality compared to other\ncomponents, the current construction of the frailty\nindex approach that assumes equal weight for each\ndeficit may deserve more research.\nConclusions\nAmong the various components of the frailty index, ADL\nand IADL disabilities are stronger predictors of mortality\nthan other components. Compared to its components, the\ncollectively constructed frailty index is a universally con-\nsistent and robust predictor of mortality across the age\nand sex groups, whereas the effects of its components are\nless consistent and less robust. The findings provide\nempirical evidence that frailty index that accumulates\nmild-effect deficits of each component whose individual\ncontribution to mortality might be too small, is a promis-\ning measure for global health of older adults.\nAbbreviations\nADL, activities of daily living; CLHLS, Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity\nSurvey; IADL, instrumental activities of daily living\n"
