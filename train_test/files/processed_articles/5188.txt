SWAT [special weapons and\ntactics]) are tasked with responding to the most critical situ-\nations, including incidents that require specialized skills and\nequipment beyond typical policing activities (Scanff &\nSWAT teams are activated in hostage and terrorist situations,\nactive shooter incidents (e.g., school shootings), and to cap-\nture dangerous criminals involved in drug and gang activities\namong many other high risk duties. SWAT officers are\ninvolved in long missions that often turn into high pressure\ncritical incidents that require life and death decisions to be\nmade extremely quickly. Some research indicates that due to\nselection criteria, police officers, and particularly, SWAT\nofficers may be generally more resilient than the average\ncivilian (Galatzer-Levy, Madan, Neylan, Henn-Haase, &\nMarmar, 2011). However, continuous exposure to chronic\nand severe stress and potential traumatic events, associated\nwith the unpredictability of the job, is associated with sig-\nnificant physiological reactivity (Gilmartin, 2002). Enhanced\nand prolonged physiological stress reactivity can, over time,\nnegatively affect the mental and physical health of officers\nare at elevated risk of mental health conditions such as\ndepression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), burnout,\nand substance abuse (Asmundson & Stapleton, 2008;Austin-\nKetch et al., 2012) and elevated risk of physical health\nconditions such as heart disease, gastrointestinal disorders,\nand diabetes and even early mortality (Violanti et al., 2005;\n1University of Toronto Mississauga, Ontario, Canada\n2Police University College, Tampere, Finland\n3Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nJudith P.

Arnetz3\n Keywords\npolice special forces, resilience promotion, critical incidents, physiological reactivity\n2 SAGE Open\nPhysical and mental health symptoms can affect occu-\npational performance. Covey and colleagues (2013) found\nthat police officers with symptoms of anxiety were more\nlikely to shoot inappropriately in simulated critical incidents.\nFurthermore, organizational policies that the officer cannot\ncontrol, shift work, and family stressors add to the burden of\nmultiple and cumulative operational stressors (Papazoglou,\n2013). Ultimately, the cumulative stress, health conditions,\nand burnout increase the risk of absenteeism, job dissatisfac-\ntion, and poor job performance (Conrad & Kellar-Guenther,\n1991). Given the marked risks of cumulative stress on the\nhealth and quality of life for the officer, and concern for pub-\nlic safety, researchers have begun to develop resilience-\nbuilding intervention programs to address stress-related\nproblems for patrol officers (Arnetz,Arble, Backman, Lynch,\n& Lublin, 2013; Arnetz, Nevedal, Lumley, Backman, &\nHowever, resilience interventions have not been applied to\nSWAT officers. In this article, we review two existing resil-\nience intervention programs designed for patrol officers\n2012) and detail the manner in which we combined these\nprograms and tested the feasibility of this combined program\nto address stress responses among SWAT officers.\nExisting Resilience Interventions for Patrol\nOfficers\nEmpirical evidence is clear that chronic and uncontrollable\nstressors confer the largest toll on physical and mental health\ntions targeting police stress were based on the premise that\nproviding officers with techniques to reduce the stressfulness\nof critical incidents and enhance the perception of predict-\nability and control would improve health and performance\net al., 1997). To test this theory, Backman and colleagues\ndesigned and conducted a 10-week randomized, controlled\nintervention that contained the following components: (a)\npsychoeducation regarding stress responses to critical inci-\ndents, (b) the use of guided imagery to facilitate officer expo-\nsure to critical incident stress while in a safe classroom\nenvironment, (c) the application of relaxation techniques to\nmanage stress reactions, (d) mental rehearsal of police best\npractices (i.e., tactical skills) during the imagery exposure,\nand (e) learning coping strategies to address the health effects\nof stress. This intervention strategy was applied to Swedish\nPolice officers as they completed their initial training (Arnetz\nSignificant and clinically relevant improvements were found\nat follow-up, specifically, enhanced problem-based coping\nskills, reductions in psychological distress, and improvements\nin physical health (i.e., reduced digestive distress, fewer\nsleep problems, and less exhaustion).\na stress reduction intervention based on the premise that\nreducing psychophysiological reactivity (i.e., cardiovascular\nand respiratory parameters) during critical incident scenarios\nwould improve health and performance outcomes for police\nand correction officers in the line of duty (McCraty et al.,\nincluded five training modules covering the following top-\nics: (a) psychoeducation about stress, risks to health, and job\nperformance; (b) instruction on a breathing technique to\nbe used during stressful situations to control physiological\nresponses to stress (e.g., to enhance physical and emotional\ncontrol during critical incidents); and (c) instruction about\ncommunication and coping strategies to be applied in the\nworkplace and at home. Prior to the training program, par-\nticipants took a number of health measures (i.e., sleep, stress\nhormones, heart rate variability, c-reactive protein, choles-\nterol, blood pressure, and glucose regulation) to indicate\nstress responsivity, risk for cardiovascular disease, and men-\ntal health symptoms (i.e., negative mood, depressive and\nanxiety symptoms, vitality). Researchers found improve-\nments in all health parameters before, during, and following\ncritical incidents and at long-term follow-up (McCraty et al.,\nemotion, vitality, reduced negative emotion and depressive\nsymptoms, and improved self-regulation in response to stress\nthe authors reported significant health savings to police orga-\nnizations in terms of a 14% reduction in annual health care\ncosts, which translated into a cost savings of $1,179 per\nemployee per year.\nGiven the significant positive outcomes of both the\nabove-mentioned resilience interventions for patrol officers,\nwe applied a combination of these programs to test the\nfeasibility of resilience programming for SWAT officers. To\nmaximize the benefits of both the Arnetz and colleagues\npsychosocial components of the Arnetz et al. (2013; Arnetz\net al., 2009) program were combined with the psychophysi-\nological techniques of the McCraty and colleagues (2009,\nThe Current Study\nOur prior work has demonstrated that, although highly\ntrained, SWAT officers are not immune to the stressors of the\njob and experience significant stress responses in training\nexercises and real-world missions (Andersen et al., 2015).\nWe extend prior literature by examining both the psychologi-\ncal and physiological responses to a resilience intervention\napplied to SWAT officers. We hypothesized that (a) SWAT\nteam officers would be actively engaged in the resilience\nAndersen et al. 3\npromotion training intervention delivered to them as part of\ntheir regular tactical training program and (b) officers would\nbe better able to control their physiological stress responses,\nas measured by heart rate and controlled respiration, over the\ncourse of the resilience training program as they learned\nand practiced the program techniques (controlled breathing\nand mental imagery in response to audio exposure to critical\nincidents).\nMethod\nParticipants\nParticipants (n = 18) were male SWAT team police officers\nFinland. Although we use the term SWAT for parsimony in\nthis article, the established name of the teams in Finland are\nknown as Special Response Teams (SRTs). There are both\nregional SRTs and federal SRTs in Finland. The participants\nin this article consisted of members of regional SRTs. The\naverage number of years of police service (M-regular ser-\nvice) was 9.75, and the number of years specifically served\nin the SWAT team (M-SWAT) was 6.67. This study was\napproved by the University of Toronto as well as the Finnish\nNational Police Research Board. All participants accepted\nour invitation to participate in the resilience intervention pro-\ngram and signed the ethics approved consent form.\nProcedure\nThe resilience training program was delivered to partici-\npants at the Police University College of Finland located in\nTampere, Finland, by licensed psychologists and an experi-\nenced SWAT trainer (who was trained in the techniques by\nthe study authors). Participants were completing a 5-day\ntactical training program that included both classroom and\nsimulated town critical incident scenarios (e.g., local train\nstation, bus and apartment searches and hostage situations).\nThe resilience intervention was conducted in the following\nmanner. On each of the 5 days, a 60-min resilience training\nsession was held, which included the psychoeducational and\nimagery components of the Arnetz and colleagues (2013;\nArnetz et al., 2009) intervention. Specifically, each session\nbegan with (a) a 10-min overview of the relevant topics of\nstress and stress management in policing; (b) the facilitators\nanswered any concerns or questions raised by the partici-\npants related to previous sessions' procedures; (c) the\npractice of the psychophysiological techniques outlined\nSpecifically, the psychophysiological intervention consists\nof focusing on positive emotion while engaging in con-\ntrolled breathing (5 s inhale and 5 s exhale) arising from the\nchest (Institute of HeartMath, 2014; McCraty & Atkinson,\n2012). (d) While engaging in controlled breathing, the offi-\ncers listened to critical incident scenarios on iPod devices.\nThe scenarios were developed by Arnetz and colleagues\nsented police incidents that were rated, by police officers\nand trainers with many years of experience, as the most\nstressful incidents that police typically encounter in the line\nof duty. Officers were instructed to imagine themselves\ninvolved in the critical incident and what actions they would\ntake. Scenarios were translated into Finnish and recorded\nby Finnish actors. Scenarios increased in severity over\nthe course of the 5 days, thus enhancing the potential for\nincreased stress responses: Day 1--car chase, Day 2--\narmed robbery, Day 3--crazed man, Day 4--domestic vio-\nlence, Day 5--murder scene. Each scenario had two\nrecordings: (a) a basic scenario that simply described a criti-\ncal incident from the perspective of the officer and was\ndeveloped to arouse physiological and emotional responses\nfrom the participants and (b) an advanced scenario that was\nthe same as the first but included the voice instructions of\nthe \"best practices\" from a trained police officer to aid the\nparticipant in knowing the correct action to take during such\na critical incident. The purpose of listening and imagining\noneself in a critical incident while in a controlled, non-\nstressful environment is to instill confidence and familiarity\ninto the police officer so that when they encounter such a\nstressor in the line of duty the incident is more predictable,\ncontrollable, and thus less threatening (Arnetz et al., 2013;\nArnetz et al., 2009). Between the basic and advanced com-\nponent of each scenario, participants received feedback\nfrom the SWAT trainer facilitator. Following the advanced\ncomponent of the scenario, the facilitators encouraged par-\nticipants to share their thoughts and feelings related to the\nsession's imagery and breathing techniques. At the end of\neach session, the psychologist facilitators debriefed partici-\npants. In addition, participants were given 15 extra minutes\nduring the evening to practice the psychophysiological\nbreathing technique.\nMeasures\nStress reactivity\nHeart rate.Participants were fitted with a chest-band\nmonitor (i.e., Zephyr Bioharness) to collect heart rate and\nrespiration parameters. The chest-band is non-invasive\nand fits next to the skin under clothing. This method of\nmeasurement has formally been used with police and cor-\nrectional officers (McCraty & Atkinson, 2012; McCraty\net al., 2009). Physiological signals were recorded (moment-\nby-moment) on the device and were reviewed and analyzed\nby the researchers at a later date. A person's heart rate rises\nas a result of autonomic nervous system activation during a\nstressful incident (Anderson, Litzenberger, & Plecas, 2002).\nA moderate, as opposed to extreme, increase in the heart rate\nduring a stressful situation indicates better adaptability and\nmore optimal mental and physical functioning during stress\n(Anderson et al., 2002; Vrijkotte, van Doornen, & de Geus,\n4 SAGE Open\n2000). We operationalized improvement in stress response\nphysiology as a participant's ability to reduce heart rate\narousal during the critical incident scenarios, indicating a\nmoderate versus high increase in heart rate over the course of\nthe 5-day intervention, even as the critical incident scenarios\nbecame increasingly more stressful. Two measures of heart\nrate stress reactivity were calculated. First, heart rate max\nmax\n) indicates the highest heart rate reached during the\ncritical incident scenario, and second measure is heart rate\naverage (HR\naverage\n), the average heart rate maintained during\nthe critical incident scenario.\nAchieving autonomic nervous system control.The psycho-\nphysiological technique, as outlined by McCraty and Toma-\nsino (2004), consists of controlled breathing (5 s inhale and\n5 s exhale) and has been shown to result in the increased\nsynchronization of the sympathetic and the parasympathetic\nnervous system. The resulting benefits include (a) reduced\nstress reactivity and basal level stress hormones (i.e., cor-\ntisol) and cardiovascular reactivity (Arnetz et al., 2009;\nMcCraty & Atkinson, 2012), and (b) control of autonomic\nnervous system activity does not allow for extreme anxiety or\npanic to occur, but instead the individual is able to maintain a\nmoderate level of arousal, which has been shown to be ideal\nfor logical thought and application of learned knowledge\n(Jamieson, Mendes, Blackstock & Schmader, 2010). To mea-\nsure the improvement in autonomic nervous system control,\nparticipants wore a pulse oximeter device attached to their\nearlobe. This device plugged into an iPod with an application\n(Inner Balance for iOS 30 Pin Sensor) for viewing the data\nin real time as it was collected and saved. The device mea-\nsures oxygen saturation in the blood calculated from pulse\nrate, heartbeat, and respiration. The Inner Balance software\nuses visual and auditory biofeedback that trains users how to\nmaintain a certain breathing rate to synchronize sympathetic\nand the parasympathetic nervous system activity (McCraty\n& Tomasino, 2004). The Inner Balance app provides infor-\nmation about user's ability to attain a synchronized state\n(i.e., coherence score) and ability to maintain this state (i.e.,\nachievement score) as measured by the amount of time spent\nin a coherent state. The Inner Balance application provides\na scale of the coherence score level (0.5 basic\u00adgood begin-\nner level, 1.0 good, 2.0 very good, 3.0+ excellent; Institute\nof HeartMath, 2014). Similarly, the achievement score refers\nto all coherence scores calculated every 5 s during a session\npoints per day is associated with stress hormone, cardiovas-\ncular and cognitive improvements (Institute of HeartMath,\nFocus Group--Group Feedback Session\nAfter the completion of the resilience training program,\nresearchers, SWAT team trainers, and SWAT team officers\n(participants) of the study had a focus group--feedback\nsession scheduled. The first and second authors of this article\nwere the group facilitators of the session. The aim of the\nfocus group was for researchers and SWAT team trainers to\nlisten to the feedback of the participants about the techniques\n(breathing and imagery) included in the resilience training\nprogram. Participants were encouraged by researchers to (a)\nshare their experiences in participating in the resilience pro-\nmotion program, (b) suggest possible changes about the sce-\nnarios presented in the daily sessions, (c) provide feedback\nabout the specific techniques applied over the resilience pro-\ngram, and (d) share with the group any additional general\ncomments or recommendations they had for similar future\nresilience research endeavors with SWAT teams. At the end\nof the focus group session, group facilitators administered a\nbrief five-question survey to be completed by the partici-\npants. The brief survey was developed on a Likert-type scale\n(1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree) and aimed to\nreceive participant's feedback on the effectiveness of the\ntraining in helping them reduce their stress levels. Some of\nthe questions included in the brief survey were as follows:\n\"Do you believe that this training helped you reduce your\nstress responses to critical incidents?\" \"Do you think that the\nbreathing technology used helped you to decrease your\nstress responses?\" \"Would you recommend the techniques\ninstructed over the training to be taught to other officers?\"\nResults\nStress Reactivity to Critical Incident Scenarios\nCardiovascular stress reactivity. T-test analyses revealed a\nreduction in average heart rate (HR\nmean\n) between Day 1\nmean\nmean\nt = 4.09; p < .001) during the period that the SWAT officers\nwere listening to critical incident scenarios (see Figure 1).\nThere were no significant differences in the maximum heart\nrate observed between Day 1 (HR\nmax\nmax\nAutonomic Nervous System Control\nControlled breathing. T-test analyses revealed an improve-\nment in achievement scores from the beginning of the train-\nences in coherence scores observed between the first (Day 1\nGroup Feedback\nDuring the focus group session, participants referred to the\nimportant role of the resilience promotion training program\nin helping them better manage stress. Officers also contrib-\nuted constructive comments about the adaptation of the\nprogram for training SWAT teams in the future. For instance,\nAndersen et al. 5\nthey mentioned that the delivery time of the resilience\nprogram was too brief and recommended a program that was\nlonger than five sessions. They also suggested that the sce-\nnarios be better tailored to the type of team maneuvers and\nweapons relevant to SWAT team's specific tasks. For\ninstance, they noted that they respond to the critical incidents\nas a group and they never respond to the incidents in dyads.\nResults from the brief surveys related to the SWAT team\nofficers' satisfaction in participating in the training were as\nfollows: Most of the participants (61.11%) were very or\nhighly satisfied with the stress reduction techniques. In terms\nof the technology used over the training sessions, most par-\nticipants (72.23%) reported that the devices used were very\nhelpful or highly helpful for them to facilitate their stress\nreduction processes. Similarly, the majority of the partici-\npants (72.22%) agreed or strongly agreed that the technology\nused over the training is capable of helping individuals\nmanage stress in their daily lives. In terms of knowledge\ndissemination, participants reported that they were confident\n(72.22%) or highly confident that they would recommend\nthe techniques of the resilience training program to their\npeers. Similarly, most of the participants stated that it is\nimportant (83.33%) or vitally important to provide this\nresilience training to their peers.\nDiscussion\nThe aims of this study were to (a) examine if a resilience\ntraining program was relevant and accepted by SWAT team\nofficers and (b) assess participants' physiological stress\nresponses (heart rate, controlled respiration) during the resil-\nience training sessions to note if there were improvements in\nstress responding over time. In accordance with the first aim,\nwe found that the SWAT officers were eager to participate in\nthe resilience promotion training program and they all com-\npleted the program. The officers reported learning, some of\nthem for the first time, about stress management and resil-\nience promotion techniques over the course of the program.\nThe officers reported benefits of the program, including self-\nreported reductions in stress physiology in reaction to the\nCar Chase Armed Robbery Crazed Man Domestic\nViolence\nMurder Scene\nHeartRate\nFigure 1. Heart rate mean (HR\nmean\n) over resilience training.\nCar Chase Armed Robbery Crazed Man Domestic\nViolence\nMurder Scene\nHeart Rate\nFigure 2. Heart rate maximum (HR\nmax\n) over resilience training.\n6 SAGE Open\nscenarios and believed this reduction in stress may improve\ntheir performance in the line of duty. Participants also\nreported that they felt that resilience training should be pro-\nvided to SWAT officers and would recommend the program\nfor their peers.\nIn accordance with the second aim of the study, our find-\nings revealed that participants were able to significantly\nreduce their physiological stress responses over the course of\ntraining. Specifically, reductions in cardiovascular arousal,\nas measured by average heart rate, and improved autonomic\nnervous system control, as measured by the achievement\nscores on the iPod devices, were observed. Participants sig-\nnificantly improved in their ability to engage in controlled\nrespiration (i.e., breathing; achievement scores) from the\nfirst session (Day 1) to the last session (Day 5) of training.\nThe findings from the coherence and achievement scores are\nin line with what we would expect trained athletes and highly\ntrained police officers to display. Specifically, participants'\ncoherence scores were high from the beginning of the train-\ning (good to very good coherence score = 1.8), not showing\na significant improvement over time. This means that SWAT\nofficers were already quickly able to achieve a state of auto-\nnomic nervous system control. They understood the tech-\nnique rapidly and were able to successfully maintain a\nbalance between sympathetic and parasympathetic control\nwhile sitting stationary. This finding is not surprising, given\nthat athletes and police trained in marksmanship (both of\nwhich apply to SWAT officers) are required to maintain high\nlevels of physical functioning and body control during\nfocused activities. However, what SWAT officers had not\nbeen taught before was the ability to maintain and improve\nautonomic nervous system control during highly stressful\nincidents with potential life threat. A moderate, as opposed to\nextreme, increase in physiological arousal during stressful\nsituations indicates better adaptability and more optimal\nmental and physical functioning during stress (Anderson\narousal is critical to the ability of a SWAT officer to think\nlogically during life and death situations and make decisions\nin line with their training (Covey et al., 2013). The SWAT\nofficers' achievement scores reflected their improvement in\nthe ability to achieve physiological control and maintain this\ncontrol even as the critical incidents became more graphic,\ncomplex, and stress arousing.\nA resilience promotion training program had never been\napplied to SWAT team police officers before this current\nstudy. However, we did not have to \"re-invent the wheel\"\nBackman and colleagues (1997) successfully applied a resil-\nience promotion training program to police recruits.\nTherefore, our main goal was to applyArnetz and colleagues'\n(1997) program to SWAT team police officers.\nDuring the focus group session, participants provided both\nresearchers and trainers with constructive feedback based on\ntheir experience with the SWAT team. More specifically, they\nsuggested that a resilience training program could be ought\nto include more than five sessions, as five sessions were\nconsidered a brief period of time for the participants to famil-\niarize themselves with the instructed techniques and begin\napplying these techniques effectively. For instance, Arnetz\nscheduled sessions for their resilience training with police\nrecruits. In this study, we only had five scheduled (60-min)\nsessions because the SWAT team's training program was\ninundated with numerous other activities (e.g., tactical\ntraining, defense tactics, shooting range), and the training\nwas scheduled to be completed within 5 business days.\nFurthermore, participants suggested that the audio-recorded\nscenarios needed to be better customized to the SWAT team\ntasks. For instance, some of the scenarios referred to a police\nofficer and his or her partner as opposed to the team-oriented\n(all platoon) mission of the SWAT. In addition, other sce-\nnarios (e.g., crazy man scenario) described officers patrol-\nling and their conversations with the \"crazy man.\"\nParticipants in this study reported that the SWAT team's mis-\nsion is to respond to a \"crazy man\" situation and instantly\narrest him, so that public safety would not be at risk. It is\ninteresting to note, however, that the largest physiological\nincreases (see Figure 2) were in response to the interaction\nwith an individual with a mental health condition. The find-\nings are in line with the self-reports from both patrol and\nSWAT officers that, typically, officers face the hardest time\naddressing mental health situations, for example, when to\nshoot or not. Also, the consequences of shooting a person\nwith a mental health disorder can be severe. Based on our\ncurrent findings, we recommend that additional imagery\ntime be spent addressing the concerns and challenges that\nofficers face in managing issues related to mental health and\npolicing. Relevant training is becoming particularly impor-\ntant in these times of increasing terrorist threat. SWAT mem-\nbers have to make quick decisions to place a suspect into a\nparticular category.\nImplications\nThis study reflects the first attempt to customize a stress\nresilience intervention to SWAT officers. The intervention\nwas developed from two evidence-based resilience programs\nfor patrol officers. The outcomes of the study indicate that\nthe application of a resilience promotion training program to\nSWAT officers is feasible, well received, and physiologically\nbeneficial. We include suggestions from SWAT officers to\nincrease the length and specificity of resilience program and\ntraining sessions to cover more SWAT-specific incidents and\nprovide greater time for practice of the techniques.\nFuture Directions\nResults suggest that an intervention to reduce stress responses\nof SWAT officers to critical incident scenarios works in a\nsimulated training setting. Translation of these findings to\nAndersen et al. 7\nreal-world occupational hazards is a recommended next step.\nA randomized controlled trial, testing the efficacy of resil-\nience training among SWAT in real-world settings, is the\nnext step for researchers to pursue.\n"
