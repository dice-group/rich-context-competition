Introduction\nThe number of uninsured population in the United States with access to healthcare services at\nreasonable costs has been a social and economic problem for their access to healthcare services with\nreasonable cost. Insufficient insurance coverage, rising healthcare cost and widening disparity in access\nto healthcare services have adversely affected the elderly population [1\u00ad4]. Today, healthcare costs are\ngenerating major problems for welfare states in the short-term and long-term. A major concern is the\naffordability of healthcare services. A growing number of Americans are delaying or forgoing care due\nto the financial burden associated with healthcare costs. This concern is compounded by rising healthcare\ncosts, which have led to an increase in medical bill payments from about 15% in 2003 to 19.4%\nin 2007 [2,5]. Increasing healthcare costs, for which payments include a significant share of\nout-of-pocket expenses, tend to result in people deferring needed healthcare treatment. The average\nyears, the average annual rate has slowed relative to the late 1990s and 2000s, but is still expected to\ngrow faster than national income. It is projected healthcare costs will continue to rise 8 percent to\n9 percent per year for the foreseeable future.\nDisparity in access to healthcare services, under the mixed private and public US healthcare programs,\nelevates inequality of health and health status among Americans [1,6]. Healthcare disparity is a concern\nfor everyone since it involves a large spread of demographics and a large share in the GDP of the US [7].\nImportant questions to consider are why have delayed healthcare and unmet healthcare needs been rising;\nand if financing healthcare is a major issue, what are the factors that can mitigate the burden. A key\nconcern is how healthcare financial burden will be distributed among the different socio-economic status.\nFinally, this study will explore how healthcare access disparity and health inequality are generated.\nVarious research literature supports that access disparities lead to unmet healthcare needs [8\u00ad11].\nThe healthcare disparity gap is a problem that the population will have to disentangle over the next\ndecade. Even though there has been an increase in the managed care system, which has significantly\nreduced the rate of increased healthcare costs; and there has been an improvement in patient-provider\nrelations, which is related to unmet needs; there is still concern about the disparity in access to healthcare\nservices [10,12\u00ad14]. There is an appealing and distinctive focus on unmet needs [9,10]. Mollborn et al. [9]\nexamined individuals' trust issues towards physicians. These individuals were ages eighteen years and\nolder, and who had regularly available healthcare providers. Cunningham and Hadley [10] differentiated\n\"delayed care\" and \"unmet needs\" and found individuals' trust was associated with improved probability\nof receiving met need care from healthcare providers. Both studies showed uninsured individuals\ncompared to privately insured individuals are more likely to have unmet medical needs. Neither study\nshowed a clear-cut difference regarding healthcare service accessibility, health disparity, and financial\nburden of healthcare among population.\nA focus of healthcare financing characteristics with the sample age groups reveals differences in\nMedicaid, Medicare, private insurance, and those uninsured. As healthcare costs rises, more of the\nincreasing costs are transferred to certain disadvantaged populations, and patients would have to spend\na considerable share of their healthcare costs out-of-pocket. Access disparity for unmet needs and\ndelayed care is relatively complex health policy measures. Studies may convincingly engage with\ndefined measures using concepts from a behavioral model. A study would require a comprehensive\nanalysis of the interfaces and interactions in the nexus of financial characteristics, cognitive aspects,\ndisparity, and inequality.\nIn order to fill the gap of precise health financial characteristics with individual behaviors, this study\nemploys three dimensions of behavioral measures in addition to socio-demographic factors with\ndifferent cognitive influences. The three behavioral measures are enabling, predisposing, and reinforcing\nfactors, which are used to determine the influence of health insurance and different cognitive\ncharacteristics on unmet needs and delayed healthcare for individuals sixty-five years or older with\nMedicare. There are three main objectives for this study. First is to shed light on the effects of behavioral\ncharacteristics on accessibility of healthcare services, i.e., unmet needs and delayed healthcare services after\nretirement. Delay in healthcare services is related to compliance with illness treatment, and unique\npreventive healthcare needs to avoid further health complications. A major goal of the behavioral model is\nto understand the characteristics of an individual's access to healthcare. Second, research conducted in this\nstudy will offer insight into different health insurance coverage regarding financing aspects: income, out-\nof-pocket medical costs, Medicare and Medicaid. Furthermore, health insurance includes managed care\n(HMO) and supplementary Medicare insurance. The public and private health insurance implications are\nessential to improve the health of the population. Third, this study underscores an improvement in patient\ntrust, patient satisfaction, and effective communication with healthcare providers. In addition, it will lead\nto a healthier population and decrease unmet needs and delayed care. This will improve the efficiency\nof delivering healthcare. Clearly this notion is what underlies the broad public uneasiness concerning\nthe health of the population, such as the quality of life as indicated by the absence of access disparity, and\nalso restrain in the rise of medical expenditures under the current complex healthcare system in\nthe United States.\n2. Brief Background\n2.1. Medicare Benefits\nMedicare benefits consist of two parts: hospital insurance plan, Part A and physician insurance plan,\nPart B. A person with hospital insurance protection (Part A) may have benefits paid on his/her behalf or,\nin certain cases, paid to him/her for covered healthcare services. Part B adds additional protection by\nproviding a basic hospital insurance plan and covering a substantial part of physician services in both\nhospital and nonhospital settings that include an emergency room or outpatient clinic, including\nsame-day surgery, ambulance services, and clinical laboratory. Parts A and B are provided automatically\nto a person aged 65 or over who is entitled to Social Security Retirement Benefits. The Medicare Part A\nis financed primarily through a mandatory payroll deduction. Part B is financed through premium\npayments and contributions from the general fund of the U.S. Treasury.\nBeginning in 2006, an additional plan, Part D, has provided subsidized access to prescription drugs\ninsurance coverage. Part D is financed primarily through premium payments and contributions from the\nTreasury general fund. Part D works differently from Medicare Part A and Part B, beginning with the\nfact that Part D is an optional plan. However, those eligible need to choose among plans offered by\nhealth insurance providers or other companies approved by Medicare. Any person who enrolls in\neither Medicare Part A or Medicare Part B is eligible to enroll in a Medicare Part D part. If qualified\nindividuals do not enroll in a plan when they first become eligible for Medicare, they might be subject\nto a Medicare-imposed late enrollment penalty.\n2.2. Supplemental Insurance for the Elderly\nThere are many types of private health insurance coverage that the elderly can purchase in order to\nfill the gaps that are not covered by Medicare. These types of private health insurance/coverage include:\nemployee or retiree coverage from employers and Medigap insurance from private insurance companies.\nThe supplemental insurance pays for parts or all of healthcare costs [15]. These types of private health\ninsurance coverage are known as \"supplemental insurance\", \"Medicare Supplemental\" or \"Medigap\"\ninsurance is a specific type of private insurance that is subject to federal and state laws. Medicare\nsupplemental insurance policies are sold by private insurance companies to Medicare beneficiaries in\norder to fill the \"gaps\" in the original Medicare coverage. There are ten standardized policies, labeled\nPlan A through Plan J that work in conjunction with the original Medicare plan. Each state decides which\nof the 10 policies can be sold in the state. Since Medicare does not cover all healthcare expenses,\nMedicare supplemental insurance is only sold as supplemental health insurance for Medicare recipients.\nUnlike Medicare, Medicare supplement insurance plan is not a federal program. However, health\ninsurance companies that provide Medicare supplemental insurance coverage are strictly regulated by\nboth the federal and state governments.\n2.3. Disparity in Health and Accessibility\nImproving health status is the central objective of policies designed in the United States today, as\nemphasized in Healthy People 2020. One of the growing debates in health policy and strategy wages\nover how to eliminate health disparities [16]. Policymakers often draw a distinction between access and\nutilization of healthcare services. In particular, the use of healthcare services are discussed in terms of\nthe distribution of healthcare services according to needs of individuals, which brings up the issue of\nHealthy People 2020 defines health disparity as the unequal burden in disease, morbidity and\nmortality rates experienced by socioeconomic status, race, national origin, and language as compared to\nthe dominant group. There are many reasons for health disparities in the United States. These include\nlack of access to affordable health insurance coverage, barriers to enrollment in public programs, and\npatient-provider relation. In addition low health literacy, which is associated with poverty, limited\neducation, and lack of affordable health insurance, is another important factor.\nHealth disparities are affected by at least two important factors: first, the individual's ability to\nproduce or maintain their health [20,21] and second, the degree of accessibility of healthcare services\nassociated with unmet needs and delayed care. With regard to the second aspect, which is the main focus\nof this study, unmet needs and delayed care depend on factors determined by an individual's choices as\nwell as choices that the individual cannot substantially influence [10,22]. Access to healthcare services,\nsuch as the relationship between a patient and his or her healthcare provider, is an important factor that\naffects individual health disparities [23]. Also, access costs in terms of financial and time costs are\nfactors that influence the amount of healthcare services used by the individual [1,24]. Like ease of access,\nchoosing to have private insurance cover costs of healthcare services is a controllable factor by the\nindividual but the choice of the public health system is not. Both types of health insurances influence the\ndegree of health disparity caused by unmet needs and delayed care. The accessibility of healthcare\nservices for an individual is defined as the availability of private and public health insurance [14,25],\nability to procure and use knowledge [26], and other socio-economic and demographic characteristics\nof the individual [11,27]. The differences in these factors widen the disparity in health among children\nunder the current U.S. healthcare system.\nThe questions posed in this study are: (1) Do public health programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid,\nplay an effective role in reducing unmet needs and delayed care? (2) How important is the difference of\nincome disparity and out-of-pocket costs in determining the choices made in unmet needs and delayed\ncare situations? (3) What are the influences of predisposing factors such as education, patient trust,\npatient satisfaction, and patient-provider communication on unmet needs and delayed care? In the\nremainder of this study, we will strive to provide answers and insights to these inquiries. Section 2\npresents the methodology: primary data source, and dependent variables regarding measures of unmet\nneeds and delayed care. The empirical framework includes theoretical based explanations for enabling,\nreinforcing, and predisposing behavioral factors to evaluate unmet needs and delayed care. In Section 3,\nwe present the empirical results, followed by the conclusion in Section 4.\n3.1. Primary Data Source\nWe used data from the 2003\u00ad2004 Community Tracking Study (CTS) Household Survey. The data\ncollection started in February 2003 and was completed in February 2004. The Household Survey\nand older, and represents the national civilian, non-institutionalized population who live in the United\nStates. Non-institutionalized population are individuals who are not in a institution (criminal, mental, or\nother types of facilities) or an active duty military personnel. The sample is clustered in 60 CTS sites:\n51 metropolitan areas and nine nonmetropolitan areas, which were randomly selected to form the core\nCTS and to be representative of the nation as a whole. The survey was administered by telephone, using\ncomputer-assisted telephone interviewing technology. Majority of respondents were selected through\nlist-assisted random-digit-dialing. The CTS Household Survey is the last data with a large sample\npopulation and was replaced by the Health Tracking Household Survey (HTHS) with the sample size of\n9 nonmetropolitan areas. The CTS Household Survey 2006 was created before the Medicare prescription\nprogram started in 2006. This study reveals the relationship between unmet prescription drugs, perceived\ndelay in healthcare, and unmet needed healthcare. In addition, it evaluates the effect of unmet\nprescription drug on health before the Medicare prescription program.\nThe Household Survey instruments covered a large variety of topics including: health insurance, use\nof health services, and satisfaction with care, health status, and certain demographic information.\nA family informant provided information on insurance coverage, health resource use, usual source of\ncare, and the general health status of all family members. The informant also provided information on\nfamily income, employment, earnings, employer-offered insurance plan, and race/ethnicity of all adult\nfamily members. Each adult in the family answered questions from a self-response module that covered\nthe issues of unmet needs, patient trust, satisfaction with physician choice, risky behaviors such as\nsmoking, and the last visit to a doctor.\n3.2. Dependent Variables: Measures of Delayed Healthcare and Unmet Needs\nIn this study, healthcare accessibility is divided into two dimensions: the general perceived delayed\nhealthcare and unmet healthcare needs. Capturing generally perceived delayed healthcare, the survey\nincluded the question, \"Was there any time during the past 12 months when you put off or postponed\ngetting medical care you though you needed?\" This study then evaluated the different influences of\nenabling, predisposing, and reinforcing factors on this perceived delay in care. The question about\ngenerally perceived unmet needs was \"During the past 12 months, was there any time when you didn't\nreceive the medical care you needed?\" However, the information does not provide any information on\nspecific illnesses or conditions. The respondent either recognizes the existence of a health problem or\nperceives needed care sometime in the near future. The same survey item is used to measure unmet\nneeds [10]. If the response is \"yes,\" this implies that the person did not get the medical care that he or\nshe needed (see Table 1 and Figure 1). It is measured by patient perceptions of disability, symptom, and\nTable 1. Definitions and Characteristics of Delayed Healthcare, and Unmet Needed\nHealthcare (aged 65 and over).\nDependent Variables and Definitions Objectives\nGenerally perceived delay in healthcare a\nWas there ever a time during the past 12 months when you put off or\npostponed getting medical care you thought you needed?\nEvaluate the different influences of enabling,\npredisposing, and reinforcing on generally\nperceived delayed care.\nGenerally perceived unmet needed healthcare a\nDuring the past 12 months, was there ever a time when you did not\nreceive the medical care you needed?\nEvaluate the different influences of enabling,\npredisposing, and reinforcing on generally\nperceived unmet medical needs.\nActual unmet needed healthcare a\nDuring the past 12 months, did you see a doctor to treat this problem\n(most recent health problem for which you did not receive or delayed\nreceiving medical care)?\nCompare different behavioral differences\nbetween generally perceived unmet needs and\nactual unmet needs.\nEvaluated delayed healthcare (adherence) a\nDid you see a specialist, get tests, or have a procedure or surgery (If\ncare was delayed, did you put off seeing a specialist or getting tested\nor getting the procedure or having the surgery)?\nExamine the effects of delayed care. Focus more\non physician assessments of symptoms and\ndiagnoses.\nNotes: The variable of \"evaluated delayed care\" consists of three types of healthcare services: specialist's\nservice, tests, and procedures or surgery. a: The symptom response module (SRM) was included in the Community\nTracking Study Household Survey, United States. The SRM for specific symptoms are 7 specific symptoms\nfor the serious category that are potentially life threatening if not treated, and 8 specific symptoms for the\nmorbid category that is not life threatening but can potentially have considerable impact on quality of life.\nFigure 1. Self-reported generally perceived delay in healthcare and generally perceived\nunmet needed healthcare: Individuals aged 65 or older in the Community Tracking Survey.\nPut off a medical care you\nthought you needed\nYes\nNo\nGenerally perceived\nunmet needed\nhealthcare\nNo\nYes\nGenerally perceived\ndelay in healthcare\nGet the needed\nmedical care\nIt is crucial to understand that unmet healthcare and delayed care needs are different concepts [9].\nIn our analysis, four dimensions of healthcare components were evaluated: generally perceived unmet\nneeds, generally perceived delayed healthcare, actual unmet needs, and evaluated delayed healthcare.\nFor generally perceived delayed care, the logical expectation is that self-perceived delayed care at least\nonce in the past twelve months is experienced by putting off the care as displayed in Table 1 and Figure 1.\nFor actual delayed care, a respondent did not receive care after the new occurrence of a specific\nsymptom. Evaluated delayed care is closely related to the kind and amount of treatment that will be\nprovided after a respondent has presented to a medical provider [22,28] as shown in Table 1. The\nrespondent has postponed receiving treatment from a specialist after obtaining a referral from a regular\ndoctor, put off taking a test in spite of the doctor's recommendation, or deferred having a\nprocedure/surgery in spite of a doctor's orders. Thus, the evaluated delayed care possibly captures some\naspect of adherence. The dimension represents the evaluated side of needs, focusing more on\nprofessional assessment of symptoms and diagnoses [28].\n3.3. Empirical Framework: PP Model\nThe line of research on health behavior and its policy implications originated from the\nPRECEDE-PROCEED model (PP model) [29\u00ad31]. This offers some concepts and analytical tools to\nhelp analyze access disparity and health inequality by using the U.S. Household Survey of the\nCommunity Tracking Study. The study applies the PP model to evaluate behavioral characteristics for\ndelayed care, unmet needs, and health inequality between Phases 2 and 4 (Figure 2). Phases 1\u00ad5 show\nthe assessment of the PP model in Figure 2. The focus of this study is to assess three categories of\ninfluential behavioral factors (enabling, predisposing, and reinforcing factors) by controlling\nsocio-demographic factors in Phase 4 and by evaluating their behavioral influences on delayed care and\nunmet needs in Phase 3. Phase 5, the policy assessment section, represents the assessment of health\npromotion, and government policy and regulation on healthcare financing and delivery.\nIndividual delayed healthcare and unmet needs healthcare can be attributed to the quantity and quality\nof physical and environmental domains, which can affect health inequality, as well as quality of life.\nEnabling factors include: access to healthcare services, availability of recourses, and referrals to\nappropriate healthcare providers, for example income, healthcare financing (out-of-pocket healthcare\ncosts, Medicare HMO, Medicare Supplementary Medical Insurance, and Medicaid), and available\nmethods of healthcare services [30]. Predisposing factors encourage active traits and include:\neducational level, knowledge, attitude, beliefs, perception, values, culture, etc. Attributable to\nknowledge by higher education, health illiteracy and skills in health information seeking, individuals\nknow how to evaluate quality of health and healthcare [30]. Reinforcing factors are comprised of the\ndifferent types of feedback, such as the rewards of a particular behavior change made by those in the\ntarget population, for example family, marital status, friend, teachers, etc [30].\nThe PP model offers some concepts and analytical tools that help analyze policy influences on\nbehavioral decisions (see bottom of Figure 2) by using influential factors in Phase 4 within the\nframework of the PP model. This study assumes that delayed care and unmet needs are measurable as a\nflow per unit of time because delayed care and unmet needs encompass heterogeneous needs, such as\nroutine, preventative physician care, specialty physician services, acute care, dental care, mental care,\nand health educational services.\nNote: See the adaptation of a model by Green and Kreuter [30].\nFigure 2. Application of PRECEDE-PROCEED Model to examine generally perceived\ndelay in health care and generally perceived unmet needed health care.\nThe study assumes that the health inequality in Phase 2 (Figure 2) is attributed to healthcare service\nuse behavior based on his or her delayed care (DELAY) and unmet needs (UNMET) in Phase 3. This is\ninfluenced by socio-demographic factors, as well as predisposing, reinforcing, and enabling factors in\nPhase 4. Individuals with delayed care and unmet needs are evaluated. A functional behavioral model in\nPhases 3 and 4 could be expressed as follows:\n= ( , , , ) + , (1)\n= ( , , , ) + , (2)\nEquations (1) and (2) represent the relationship between the health behavioral choice of individual\n\"i\" and a person with delayed care and unmet needs in Phases 3 in Figure 2. Factors will influence an\nindividual's delayed care, and DELAY is an unobserved error, generally assumed to satisfy E(DELAY|\nEN, PR, RE, SD) = 0. UNMET is an unobserved error, generally assumed to satisfy E(UNMET| EN,\nPR, RE, SD) = 0.\nBoth delayed healthcare (DELAY) and unmet healthcare needs (UNMET) consist of enabling (EN),\npredisposing (PR), reinforcing (RE), and socio-demographic factors (SD) that will influence healthcare\ndisparity of the elderly. The study incorporates the extended PP Model to observe health inequality and\nthe influential determinants.\nQuality-of-Life\nAssessment\nHealth\nAssessment\nBehavioral\nAssessment\nBehavioral\nFactors\nPolicy Assessment\nAccess disparity:\nGenerally perceived\ndelay in health care\nand generally\nperceived unmet\nneeded health care\nHealth\nInequality\nQuality of\nLife\nOutcome\nEvaluation\nImpact and\nAccessibility\nEvaluation\nImplementation and\nProcess Evaluation\nEnabling Factors\nPredisposing\nFactors\nReinforcing Factors\nHealth\nPromotion\nPolicy and\nRegulation\nIn our estimation, enabling factors include income, health insurance related aspects, price of\nhealthcare expenditures (out-of-pocket expenditures), usual source of care, and time related accessibility\nmeasures. This study analyzes a variety of health insurance aspects to fill the gap in literature. In order\nto capture coverage and managed care cost saving aspects, this study includes Medicare HMO, private\nhealth insurance with HMO, and Medicare Supplementary Medical Insurance [25,32,33]. In addition to\nthe price of healthcare services, an individual's income level affects the living standard which contributes\nto unmet needs and delayed care and, in turn, health outcome [34]. Low income, minority populations\nreceived less healthcare than the wealthier population, who has a higher probability of obtaining\nhealthcare when they need it [35]. Various components, as well as the amount of time invested in health\nservices by using usual source of care and time input for accessibility to healthcare services, also\ninfluences an individual's health status through enabling factors as seen in Table 1 [21].\nPredisposing factors are education as a substitute for knowledge, patient trust, patient satisfaction,\npatient-provider communication, and lifestyle risk. The educational level as knowledge is associated\nwith unmet needs and delayed care. Higher education levels affect health capital development and\nincrease efficiency in health status. Years of education represent health capital related to health knowledge,\nallowing individuals to make better behavioral decisions, which is related to educational attainment [36].\nAnother barrier to obtaining needed care without delay may be lack of knowledge of the importance of\nseeing a referred specialist, of getting the recommended test, or receiving proper procedure [37].\nThere has been a dramatic increase in the interest of measuring patients' trust in their physicians.\nTrust is a defining element in any interpersonal relationship and it is particularly central to the\npatient-provider relationship [38]. Any consideration of the patients' interpersonal trust in physicians\nmust take into account the general atmosphere in healthcare institutions. Although evidence shows that\nthe majority of patients continue to trust their physicians and health information, concern is growing\nover the rapid and far-reaching changes in the healthcare system, which have placed great pressure on\nthat trust and may undermine it [39]. The new concerns about patient trust has triggered a recognition\nthat there needs to be a better understanding of the role of trust in a patient-physician relationship and\nhealth information, and the relationship between trust and health outcomes.\nAn increasingly important role in the provision of clinical process and outcomes are related to patient\nsatisfaction through service improvements in nursing homes, hospitals, and clinics. The scope of patient\nsatisfaction includes physician's inpatient care, primary care services, patient-perceived nurse care,\nwaiting time for services at clinics, etc. [40]. Patient satisfaction not only depends on services from\nhealthcare providers but also varies by anxiety level of patient, mental status of patient, and geographic\nThe relationship between patients and their physicians is influenced by lack of cultural competence\nof physicians to improve communication with patients, lack of knowledge about procedural issues,\ninconsistencies of recommendation guidelines to patients, lack of physicians' encouragement of patients'\ninterest, lack of evidence for benefit from patients' health insurance coverage, and failure to call back\npatients for screening. These are all barriers that stem, in part, from the communication between patients\nand physicians [43,44], and inevitably hinder a patient's incentive to decrease unmet needs and delayed\ncare. Thus efforts to improve unmet/met needs and delayed care should focus at least in part on\nimproving patient-provider communication. The possible role of health communication between patients\nand physicians with unmet/met needs and delayed care has recently received greater attention. Health\ncommunication is the art and technique of informing, influencing, and motivating individual,\ninstitutional, and public audiences about important health issues. Quality oriented communication\nbetween patients and their physicians is related to patients' awareness of unmet needs and delayed care.\nA lack of communication between a patient and a healthcare provider can lead to serious problems (e.g.,\nchance of survival).\nIn socio-demographic factors, behavioral aspects of choosing unmet/met needs and delayed care in\nrelation to maintaining good health, use healthcare services which vary by the factors that include age,\ngender, race/ethnicity, and poverty level. In socio-demographic factors, an individual's health status\nbased on subjective health is included in a base specification without making a health index because of\nthe lack of ADL objective measurements [45,46]. Estimation is an alternative specification without a\nhealth status variable. An underlying factor in the discussion above implies that the estimated coefficient\non unmet needs and delayed care would be an upward biased estimate of the true impact of these\nvariables, assuming that individual health status variables are omitted. The results would be biased.\n4. Results\n4.1. Reliability of Estimation\nFor this empirical study, there are three issues of reliability of estimation: exogeneity/endogeneity,\nmulticollinearity, and heteroskedasticity in probit estimation. Health status of the elderly is included in\na base specification and educational level, i.e., health knowledge. This is seen as a factor that improves\nthe efficiency with which the elderly can produce better health. The income level of the elderly affects\nthe living standard, which contributes to the health of elderly. In addition, the correlation of educational\nattainment and income is generally positive. An elderly person with a higher education level is more\nlikely to raise health stock because of his/her health knowledge. Both variables are theoretically\nimportant to evaluate the elderly with delayed healthcare services and unmet healthcare needs.\nTherefore, there are multiple included endogenous variables in this empirical study.\nRegarding the issue of exogenity/endogeneity, the study used the Hausman Specification Test to\nexamine the endogeneity of this empirical model, and to examine delayed care, unmet needs, and health\nvariables. Under the null hypothesis, there is no simultaneity and correlation between, health variable\ni which an error term of DELAY Equation (1), and health variable and UNMET\ni which is an\nerror term of UNMET Equation (2) should be zero, asymptotically. The residual of health is included in\nthe structural form. The study used two instrument variables, body mass index (BMI) and subjective\nmental health in Table 2. Two of the residuals in the structural equation were not found to be statistically\nsignificant at the 10% level, the residual of health (t = -1.42) in the delay of healthcare regression, and\nthe residual of health unmet needs (t = 0.53) in the unmet needs regression. The results imply the health\nvariable for both regressions is exogenous.\nTable 2.

[46].\nThe hypothesis that both the coefficient on the health status and the coefficient on education are zero\nis an example of a joint hypothesis on the coefficients in the multiple regressions (1 and 2). The\nregressors are possibly multicollinear and linear relationship among some or all-explanatory variables\nof a regression model makes precise estimation difficult. The variance-inflation factor (vif) detects\nmulticollinearity by using condition indices. The variance-inflation factor (vif) for the general perceived\ndelayed healthcare range from 1.02 to 2.28 in Table 3, that of general perceived unmet needed healthcare\nranges from 1.02 to 2.28 in Table 4; evaluated subjective health for the elderly of general perceived\ndelayed healthcare ranges from 1.02 to 2.30 in Table 5; and evaluated subjective health for the elderly of\ngeneral perceived unmet needed healthcare ranges from 1.02 to 2.30 in Table 6. All vifs are less than 10.\nAs a rule of thumb, when analyzing standardized data, a VIF < 10 indicates a non-harmful collinearity\nTable 3.

Therefore, heteroskedasticity does not threaten the\ninternal validity of the multiple regression analysis with the definition of variables in Table 2 by using\nthe process of heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors. Evaluated subjective health status (ill health)\nwill lead to an increase in healthcare service utilization that is also related to a rise in healthcare\nexpenditures. Consequently, this leads to higher healthcare costs, financial problems, delayed healthcare\nand unmet needs. The elderly with delayed and unmet needs for healthcare may cause health status to\nweaken. The study of health behavior, by applying the extended PP Model, requires\nexogeneity/endogeneity tests for delayed care and unmet needs with health variables.\nTo determine whether the items in each factor could be used for probit regression, dimensionality and\nreliability (eigenvalue greater than one rule) and consistent estimate of reliability (Cronbach ): the\ninterrelated issues of dimensionality and reliability of responses to a scale, were performed.\nIn Tables 2\u00ad6, three items for patient distrust are referral, medical needs, and influence; those of patient\ndissatisfaction are healthcare, primary care doctor, and specialist; and those of patient-provider\nmiscommunication includes the key items of listening, explaining, and difficulty with communication\nor understanding. Using the item reduction method (i.e., factor analysis), the initial eigenvalues for all\nthree factors were greater than 1, and the eigenvalues dropped toward later components (from 1.453 to\npatient-provider miscommunication). This implies that there is a uni-dimension of these three factors.\nTo evaluate consistent estimate of reliability of the scale, Cronbach's coefficient alpha, based on\nstandardized items, was examined for each factor. Cronbach's coefficient alphas are items of patient\ndistrust ( = 0.453 with a poor estimate), items of patient dissatisfaction ( = 0.582 with a questionable\nlevel), and items of patient-provider miscommunication ( = 0.667 with an acceptable estimate).\n4.2. Regression Results: General Perceived Delayed Healthcare and Unmet Needed Healthcare\nThe results of regression for this study are: general perceived delayed healthcare (Table 3); general\nperceived unmet needs (Table 4); evaluated subject health of the elderly of the general perceived delayed\nhealthcare (Table 5); and evaluated subject health of the elderly of the unmet needed healthcare (Table 6).\nThe summary statistics and definitions of the variables used in this study are listed in Table 2. The results\nof these estimations show that the general perceived delayed healthcare and the general perceived unmet\nneeded healthcare are sensitive to unmet prescription drugs in Tables 3 and 4. The general perceived\ndelayed healthcare and the general perceived unmet needed healthcare are more likely increase as an\nincrease in unmet prescription medicines by older adults aged 65 and over. The results show that an\nincrease in the price of drug and out-of-pocket costs imposes a financial burden on prescription drug use\nof the elderly.\nFor enabling factors, as stated earlier, an increase in income is statistically significant and negatively\nassociated general perceived delayed healthcare and general perceived unmet needed healthcare in\nTables 3 and 4, while out-of-pocket medical costs have a higher probability of raising the general\nperceived delayed healthcare and the general perceived unmet needs. The aforementioned results reveal\nthat the financial burden of receiving healthcare services for those aged 65 and over would lead to the\ngeneral perceived delayed healthcare and the unmet needed healthcare.\nComparing healthcare financing the public programs, Medicare HMO, Medicare supplementary\nmedical insurance, and Medicaid indicates that there is no clear cut behavioral difference in regarding\nthe general perceived delayed healthcare and the general perceived unmet needed healthcare. Table 4\nshows that the Medicaid program is associated with an increased probability of the general perceived\nunmet needed healthcare. According to the definition and the questionnaire about a term \"put off\nreceiving healthcare care services\" in the Community Tracking Study Household Survey 2003\u00ad2004,\nthe items on the general perceived delayed healthcare are attributable to patient side of reasons, not the\nmotives from the healthcare service provider.\nTable 4.

Interestingly, both the variables of the general perceived delayed healthcare\nand unmet needed healthcare are positively associated with patient distrust. The coefficients of patient\ndistrust which consist of referral issues, medical needs, and influence of health insurance firms on\nphysician's decision making for services are more likely to perceive delayed healthcare and unmet\nneeded healthcare. The results of the distrust variables point out some interesting aspects of the\nbehavioral decisions made by the elderly. In predisposing factors, an increase in patient dissatisfaction\nwith healthcare services, which consist of healthcare in general, a choice of primary care, and choice of\nspecialists, tends to raise generally perceived delayed healthcare and generally perceived unmet needed\nhealthcare. However, the coefficients of patient-provider communication, which consists of a\nphysician's attitude toward listening efforts, clear explanation about illness situation and treatment, and\nundivided attention to communicate to the patients, do not show statistical significance and do not\npresent a clear cut association with delayed healthcare and unmet needed healthcare.\n4.3. Regression Results: Evaluated Subject Health for General Perceived Delayed Healthcare and\nUnmet Needed Healthcare\nThe results of Tables 5 and 6 report evaluated subject health, which is a composited scales of physical\nand mental health status, of the general perceived delayed healthcare or the general perceived unmet\nneeded healthcare age 65 and over. The coefficient of general perceived delayed healthcare with a\npositive sign in Table 5 shows that elderly persons, who face general perceived delayed healthcare,\nreduce their health status by 48.8% within the composited health scale between 2 and 10 as compared to\nelderly persons who do not have any problems of the general perceived delayed healthcare. The similar\ninterpretation is applied to the coefficient of general perceived unmet needed healthcare in Table 6 and\nits effect is higher among elderly persons with general perceived unmet needed healthcare by 59.6%\nthan elderly persons without any problems of unmet needed healthcare.\nThe elderly persons who are not able to afford prescription medicine are strongly associated with\nevaluated health status in both delayed and unmet needed healthcare. The elderly persons who do not\nget needed prescription medicines are predicted to raise the health of the general perceived delayed\nhealthcare by 44.2% and general perceived unmet needed healthcare by 49.2% more than the elderly\npersons who do not have those prescription problems. The large impact of the results imply that\nprescription drug coverage by Medicare is an important factor that influences the health of the elderly\nwho face the general perceived delayed healthcare or unmet needed healthcare.\nFor healthcare financing factors in Tables 5 and 6, a negative sign of income variable indicates that\nan increase in income of the elderly is associated with an increase in the health status of the elderly\namong the elderly who face general perceived healthcare or unmet needed healthcare (see the definition\nof factors in Table 2). A positive sign of poverty coefficients shows that an increase in poverty among\nthe elderly of general perceived delayed healthcare or unmet needed healthcare is associated with\nreduction of their evaluated subjected health status. A rise in out-of-pocket medical costs within the\nrange between 1 and 6 is also associated with the deterioration of evaluated subject health of the elderly\nwho face general perceived delayed healthcare or unmet needed healthcare by an 18.2% and an 18.4%\nrespectively.\nRegarding health insurance factors, coefficients of Medicare HMO indicate that the elderly under\nMedicare HMO are associated with a 12.1% reduction of bad evaluated subjective health of the general\nperceived delayed healthcare within the range between 2 and 10. Similarly, the Medicare HMO influence\non the evaluated subjective health of the elderly of the general perceived unmet needed healthcare is by\n13.2%. Compared to fee-for-service of the traditional health insurance, the provision of preventive\ncharacteristics by the HMO tends to raise better subjective health status of the elderly with general\nperceived delayed healthcare and unmet needed healthcare. Furthermore, the positive signs indicate that\nthe elderly with the Medicaid insurance are more likely to have weak adherence to have good evaluated\nsubjective health.\nTable 5.

A negative sign of education indicates a strong negative\ninfluence of a rise in educational level on an increase in better subjective health. All patient distrust,\npatient dissatisfaction, and patient-provider miscommunication are positive and raise both general\nperceived delayed healthcare and unmet needed healthcare. The delayed and unmet needed care\ndeteriorate health of the elderly.\n4.4. Concentration Curve: Access Disparity and Health Inequality\nFigures 3 and 4 show the concentration curves which emphasizes and measures health inequalities\nand identifies inequalities in health by using the concentration index. The index is negative when the\ncurve is above the equality line and positive when the curve is under the equality curve. The\nconcentration index is defined with reference to the concentration curve, which graphs on the x-axis the\ncumulative percentage of the population ranked by income beginning with the lowest, and on the\ny-axis the cumulative percentage of \"general perceived delayed healthcare,\" \"general perceived unmet\nneeded healthcare,\" or \"unmet needed prescription drug,\" corresponding to each cumulative percentage\nof the population of the income in Figure 3. Since all concentration indices take negative values in the\ntable of concentration index if there is access disparity, all concentration curves lies above the line of\nequality, indicating disproportionate concentration of delayed care, unmet needs, or unmet prescription\nare among the poor (low income) income population [50,51]. Figure 3 presents a concentration curve\nfor which the curve of unmet prescription is highest among three measures, and unmet prescription is\ndisproportionately large in the population among the poor. The degree to which unmet prescription,\ndelayed care, or unmet needs is more unequally distributed to the disadvantaged of low-income\npopulation in the elderly. Access disparity of healthcare services exists among the low-income population.\nFor Figure 4, the values of \"general perceived unmet needed healthcare\" and \"unmet prescription\ndrug\" in the table concentration index for health inequality are positive and their concentration curves\nlie below the line of equality. However, \"delayed care\" takes a negative value of the concentration index.\nThe sign indicates that the general perceived delay in healthcare rises as out-of-pocket increases among\nthe elderly. The unmet needed prescription drug is closer to the equality line than the general perceived\nunmet healthcare needs and the degree of index of the general perceived unmet needed healthcare is\nsmaller than that of the general perceived unmet needed healthcare. The general perceived unmet needed\nhealthcare is disproportionately large in the population among the high out-of-pocket costs.\nConcentration Index: Access Disparity (Income)\nAccessibility Concentration index Standard errors\nNotes: Concentration index: Concentration index using formula/covariance method.

Conclusions and Implications\nThis empirical study concludes unmet needs of prescription drugs for the elderly population have\npositive influence on the perceived delay in healthcare and perceived unmet needed healthcare. These\nfactors are disproportionally large in the population among the poor (low income) elderly. These three\nfactors raise evaluated ill health status, ranging between 45%~60% among the elderly population. Other\ninteresting findings are that out-of-pocket medical costs elevate perceived unmet needed healthcare and\ndelayed healthcare, and the high out-of-pocket costs raise disproportionally large perceived unmet\nneeded healthcare for elderly population. Our findings also offer insight into the patient-physician\nrelation mechanism. Patient's distrust and dissatisfaction increase perceived unmet needed healthcare\nand delay in healthcare. These two factors and patient-provider miscommunication together increase\nsubjective ill health status by about 26%. However, educational attainment of one additional year reduces\nsubjective ill health status by 7%.\nCumulative % of population ranked by Income\nCumulative % of Delayed care, Unmet\nneeds, or Unmet prescription\nDelayed\nUnmet\nprescription\nUnmet\nneeds\nConcentration Index: Access Disparity (Out of Pocket)\nAccessibility Concentration index Standard errors\nNotes: Concentration index: Concentration index using formula/covariance method.

Concentration curves--Access Disparity (Out of Pocket): Generally perceived\ndelay in healthcare (Delayed care), Generally perceived unmet needed health care (Unmet\nneeds), and Unmet needed prescription drug (Unmet prescription) by Out-of-pocket costs.\nPolicy makers need to address a diverse amount of issues to make the healthcare more affordable and\naccessible to reduce inequality of healthcare burden, which in turn lead to health disparity, under the\ncurrent system. This research reinforces and extends the findings of a previous study for issues\nconcerning health insurance, race, income and satisfaction [9]; and for health insurance and race related\naspects [10]. Unlike the results by Mollborn et al., [9] for educational variable, our study supports a\nhypothesis of educational attainment with better health status for the population aged 65 and over. This\nstudy is different since it focuses on understanding the behavioral choices and characteristics of the\nelderly population aged 65 years and over. In order to underline a more specific policy implication, the\nbehavioral model (the PRECEDE-PROCEED model) was used to comprehend some cognitive aspects,\nand provide a detailed construction of unmet needs and delayed healthcare. Most importantly, we\nincluded a prescription variable that previous studies did not employ.\nOur findings show a dimension of increase costs of prescription drug for the elderly in the general\nperceived delayed healthcare and the elderly in general perceived unmet needs. The results of our study\nclearly show some important aspects of referral issue and medical needs in distrust category for general\nCumulative % of population ranked by Out-of-pocket costs\nCumulative % of Delayed care,\nUnmet needs, or Unmet prescription\nDelayed\ncare\nUnmet\nneeds\nUnmet\nprescription\nperceived delayed healthcare and the general perceived unmet needed healthcare. Our detailed patient\nsatisfaction variables support the result of a single trust variable [9]. In addition, we employed mode\ndetail dissatisfaction measures; composite points by satisfaction with healthcare services, satisfaction\nwith a choice of primary care, and satisfaction with choice of specialists, and underlined the significance\nof behavioral aspects that the previous study by using a single satisfaction measure [9]. Our results are\ncongruent with the result by Hispanic and African American behavior of unmet needs and delayed\nhealthcare [10]. It is known that economic/financial aspects are debilitating factors for the elderly\npopulation falling in the group of delayed healthcare and unmet needed healthcare as a regular source of\ncare. In other words it implies, income and out-of-pocket medical costs are associated with the two\ncharacteristics. The income factor is inversely associated with access disparity and health inequality,\nwhereas, the out-of-pocket medical cost has a positive association, or a direct association, with the access\ndisparity and health inequality. Our study shows that lack of financial source of care is associated with\nan increase in unequally distributed services to the disadvantaged of population of the elderly. The\nvariable of education does not show a clear-cut importance of healthcare knowledge, which is relevant\nto Grossman's argument [21].\nWhat is the practical implication of our findings? The government's Medicaid health insurance is\nlimited to consumer medical care choice that is adversely associated with health and healthcare equality\nin accordance with our finding from generally perceived unmet needs. An increase in subjective health\nstatus with a variable of Medicare HMO partially explains the preventive care aspect to receive\nmeaningful healthcare services in consistent with subjective health of the elderly of the general perceived\ndelayed healthcare and unmet needed healthcare from our finding. Most importantly, medicine\nprescriptions are a well-known fact and the elderly take multi-prescription to prevent a decrease in health\ncapital from aging. The data for this study is from the Community Tracking Study Household Survey\ncurrent Medicare prescription program is not ideal one, we still need to do research about the influence\nof the current Medicare prescription program on the elderly population. When assessing Medicare\ninsurance coverage disparities in access based on unmet needs and delayed healthcare, there is little\nevidence the effectiveness of policy and healthcare and health disparity among disadvantaged\npopulation.\nIt is not difficult to explain why two of three measures produced the same results of positive influence\nof patient distrust and dissatisfaction on health of the elderly of the general perceived delayed healthcare\nand unmet needed healthcare. A recent rapid increase in medical costs associated with an increase in\naccess disparity causes health disparity among the elderly. Further study is strongly recommended to\nunderstand and to comprehend characteristic different behavioral choice about delayed healthcare and\nunmet needed healthcare for reducing health disparity, especially unequally distributed disadvantaged\nof income population in the elderly and delayed healthcare and unmet needed healthcare for decreasing\ndisproportionately large in the elderly among the high out-pocket costs.\nEndnote\n1: The concentration index is computed on individual (micro) data.
