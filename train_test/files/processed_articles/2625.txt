Lack of insurance\nwas particularly prevalent among released men,[4] who comprised 89% of all released prison-\nHealthcare coverage rates among released prisoners may be improving with the roll-out of\nthe Affordable Care Act (ACA).[6,7] The ACA provides several mechanisms to increase\nhealthcare coverage. Two primary mechanisms include tax credits to help middle-income per-\nsons purchase private insurance through the state or federal \"marketplaces\" and the expansion\nof Medicaid eligibility criteria. Whereas Medicaid traditionally served impoverished adults\nwho were aged, disabled, or had dependents, the ACA expanded criteria to provide coverage to\nlow-income adults regardless of disability or dependents.\nIn 2012 the US Supreme Court ruled that states were not bound to expand Medicaid under\nthe ACA.[8] In 2014, the first year of the ACA's prescribed Medicaid expansion, 27 states\nexpanded their eligibility criteria.[9] In these states, single adults (and families) with incomes\nequal to 138% of federal poverty level (FPL) or less were eligible to enroll in Medicaid. ACA\nsubsidies for private insurance were available for those between 139% and 400% FPL. In non-\nexpansion states, subsidies were available to those 101%-400% FPL, but Medicaid was not\nPrior to the Court's 2012 Medicaid ruling, Cuellar and Cheema projected that 57% of newly\nreleased US state prisoners could gain coverage under the ACA,[11] but these estimates\nassumed universal Medicaid expansion and did not account for enrollment in Medicare or\n\"traditional\" Medicaid (for the aged, disabled or those with dependents) for which automatic\nenrollment occurs in most states when qualifying for Social Security Administration (SSA)\nbenefits, e.g. \"Disability.\"\nWe therefore undertook the current study, which accounts for the 2014 landscape of state\nMedicaid expansion policies and SSA-mediated benefits, to project post-release healthcare cov-\nerage rates--and the coverage gap--for male state prisoners with chronic health problems. We\nspecifically focused on this population because of its large size, and because these inmates\nwould likely require healthcare following release but have traditionally had low rates of health-\ncare coverage in the community.\nMaterials and Methods\nData source\nOur analyses utilize data from the 2004 Survey of Inmates in State Correctional Facilities,\nwhich was conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau on behalf of the Bureau of Justice Statistics.\n[12] The survey was administered to a nationally representative sample of state prisoners using\nface-to-face interviews and included items assessing prisoners' health conditions, pre-incarcer-\nation Social Security Administration (SSA) benefits, income, and other socio-demographic\ncharacteristics. The data and codebook are available online (www.icpsr.umich.edu). We pro-\nvide the main survey items utilized in our analyses in the S1 Appendix.\nStudy population\nOur study population was composed of male state prisoners aged 18\u00ad64 years who reported a\nhistory of at least one of the 18 chronic health conditions assessed in the survey: hypertension,\ndiabetes, heart disease, stroke, asthma, kidney disease, arthritis, hepatitis, cirrhosis, cancer,\nhuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV), paralysis, depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress\ndisorder (PTSD), bipolar disorder, a psychotic disorder, or a personality disorder.\nReleased Prisoners' Healthcare Coverage\nrole in study design, data collection and analysis,\ndecision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.\nCompeting Interests: The authors have declared\nthat no competing interests exist.\nPrimary Analysis\nWe described the socio-demographic characteristics and prevalence of reported chronic health\nconditions among the study population. We then used the joint distributions of reported SSA\nbenefits, income, and health conditions to project the number of male prisoners with a chronic\ncondition who would be eligible for healthcare coverage at release. We estimated the number\nwith a history of SSA benefits in the month prior to incarceration and assumed that SSA-medi-\nated insurance could be resumed post-release. Among those without SSA benefits in the month\nprior to incarceration, we determined eligibility for Medicaid and tax credits by comparing\nprisoners' pre-incarceration annual income (i.e. projected from income the month prior to\nincarceration, adjusted for inflation using the US Bureau of Labor Statistics Employment Cost\nIndex[13]) to the 2014 Medicaid/tax credit FPL criteria described above. Sixteen percent were\nmissing income data. To impute missing income values, we jointly stratified prisoners by age\n(group), race, and education level, and assigned those with missing incomes the median\nincome value of prisoners within their same stratum who had non-missing data. For all and\neach chronic condition(s), we estimated the number of prisoners eligible for healthcare cover-\nage in Medicaid expansion and non-expansion states. We applied the sampling weights\nincluded in the dataset so that results would reflect the total population of adult, non-elderly\nUS male prisoners with a history of chronic medical condition. All analyses, including the sen-\nsitivity analyses described below, were conducted using SAS version 9.4 (Cary, North Caro-\nlina). Weighted population means and frequencies and corresponding 95% confidence\nintervals (CIs) were estimated using proc surveymeans and proc surveyfreq.\nSensitivity analyses\nReported income in the month prior to arrest was recorded using categorical responses (e.g.\nassume respondents' pre-incarceration monthly income was the mid-point value of the\nselected range (e.g. inmates reporting an income of $1\u00ad199 were assigned an income of $100).\nProjected income was estimated as the monthly income, multiplied by 12, and adjusted for\ninflation to 2014 dollars. We conducted two sets of sensitivity analyses to determine the num-\nber of prisoners in the coverage gap by assuming that respondents' true income was at the low-\nest and highest value of each selected category. Several studies suggest that prisoners may\nencounter a loss of earning or \"wage penalty\" following an incarceration. In line with the earlier\nanalysis by Cuellar and Cheema, we examined the effect of a 15% \"wage penalty,\" on our\nresults, which we applied to our \"low,\"\"mid-point\" and \"high\" analyses resulting in six esti-\nmates of the number of male state prisoners who would be within the coverage gap at release.\nThis study was deemed non-human subjects research by the Institutional Review Board of the\nUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\nResults\nBriefly, 60% were non-White, 11% were aged over 50 years, and 34% had neither completed\nhigh school nor earned a high school equivalency certificate (GED). The median annual pre-\nincarceration income, adjusted to 2014 dollars, was $18,531. Seven percent received SSA bene-\nfits in the month prior to incarceration, and prisoners with any chronic condition were nearly\nevenly distributed across expansion (51%) and non-expansion (49%) states (Table 1).\nIn Medicaid expansion and non-expansion states, 20% and 17% of prisoners, respectively,\nwere projected to earn 400% FPL and would thus not be eligible for Medicaid or tax credits,\nand about 7% of prisoners in expansion and non-expansion states had a history of SSA\nReleased Prisoners' Healthcare Coverage\nTable 1.

In non-expansion states, 54% qualified for tax credits, but\nsupport (Fig 1), placing them in the coverage gap.\nAmong the prisoners in the coverage gap, the ten most frequently reported conditions in\norder of descending frequency were hypertension (n = 27245), depression, arthritis, asthma,\nhepatitis, heart disease, bipolar, kidney disease, personality disorder, and anxiety disorder\nIn the primary analysis, prisoners in the coverage gap represented 11% of all prisoners in\nour target population (and 22% of those in non-expansion states).

In this analysis, we\naccounted for the 2014 landscape of Medicaid expansion policies and estimated healthcare cov-\nerage eligibility under the ACA among male state prisoners with chronic health conditions. We\nalso refined the estimates by accounting for inmates eligible for coverage under SSA benefits.\nOur primary analysis suggests that about sixty-nine thousand male prisoners with selected\nchronic conditions would be ineligible for healthcare coverage under the ACA because of states\nthat chose not to expand their Medicaid coverage to impoverished adults without disability or\ndependents. This population in the coverage gap represents 11% of all male prisoners aged 18\u00ad\n64 with selected chronic conditions, and based on our sensitivity analysis, the gap would not be\nexpected to be lower than 8% or higher than 16%. In the national context, these results suggest\nthat through Medicaid expansion or tax credits, the ACA can provide insurance to the majority\nof impoverished male prisoners with chronic health conditions in need of coverage.\nFig 1.

Clearly universal Medicaid expansion could further improve\ncoverage rates, but Medicaid expansion remains politically contentious. In the absence of uni-\nversal Medicaid expansion, an important point of access to healthcare coverage for those with\ndebilitating conditions is through SSA benefits (such as \"disability\"), which can result in Medi-\ncare or Medicaid enrollment. We found that among those with a chronic condition (in both\nexpansion and non-expansion states), only 7% had a history of SSA benefits in the month prior\nto arrest. These percentages likely underestimate the true proportion of prisoners who could\nqualify for SSA benefits if prisoners were evaluated thoroughly. The extent to which prison sys-\ntems currently facilitate enrollment in SSA benefits (i.e., assist with applications) in preparation\nfor prisoners' release is unclear, but data from our 2011\u00ad2012 survey suggest that SSA enroll-\nment assistance was uncommon.[14]\nFig 2. Sensitivity analysis projecting the number and percentage of male US state prisoners with a history of chronic medical conditions\nincarcerated in a Medicaid non-expansion state who will be in the \"coverage gap\"* at release. *In non-expansion states, subsidies are\navailable to those with incomes 101%-400% FPL, but Medicaid was not extended to those at or below 100% FPL, creating a \"coverage gap\" among\nimpoverished persons. **Respondents reported income by selecting one of several income categories (e.g. No income, $1\u00ad100, $200\u00ad400, etc.) for\nthe month prior to their incarceration. We estimated monthly income based on the lowest and highest value and their average (i.e. \"Mid-point\") in the\nselected category. All monthly estimates were multiplied by 12 to estimate annual income and adjusted for inflation to 2014 dollars. Estimates were\ncompared to 2014 ACA income guidelines to determine the percentage in the \"coverage gap.\" ***Some evidence suggests that released prisoners\nearn less than their pre-incarceration wages. As with an earlier study[11], we applied a 15% wage penalty to the Low, Middle, and High pre-\nincarceration income estimates to account for this wage reduction in determining the percentage of prisoners in the \"coverage gap.\"\nReleased Prisoners' Healthcare Coverage\nReleased prisoners in the coverage gap may be at increased risk for relying on emergency\ndepartments (ED) for routine care. In a retrospective cohort study in Rhode Island of over\n6,000 prisoners released over a two year period, at least 24% had one or more documented\nemergency department visits within the first year post-release.[15] ED use may be more com-\nmon among those with serious chronic conditions. In a Connecticut study of prisoners with\nHIV, 56% (85/151) had an ED visit in the first year post-release.[16] While neither of these\nstudies reported cost, existing evidence suggests that for ambulatory care sensitive conditions,\ncharges and payments for ED care are about two times those for outpatient care (for similar\nconditions and treatment),[17] suggesting that released prisoners in the coverage gap may have\nlittle choice when seeking care but to utilize high-cost health services.\nEven for released prisoners who establish healthcare coverage, challenges remain. Beyond\nissues common to prisoner re-entry (e.g. establishing employment, securing housing, and\naddressing substance use), those with Medicaid may face particular barriers to healthcare\naccess. Results from a 2013 survey conducted by the Department of Health and Human Ser-\nvices Office of Inspector General (OIG) in 32 states with Managed Care Organization (MCO)-\nfacilitated Medicaid, found that greater than half of providers listed by the MCO as participat-\ning in Medicaid could not be found at their listed location or were not accepting new patients;\namong providers who were accepting new patients, greater than 25% had wait times of one\nmonth or longer. The OIG concluded there were \"significant vulnerabilities in provider avail-\nability, which is a key indicator for access to care.\"[18]\nIn addition to issues of access, released prisoners who obtain healthcare coverage, regardless\nof the mechanism, may face discrimination in accessing care. For example, in a small but\nimportant study, Frank et al. found that 42% (73/172) of male parolees felt discriminated\nagainst in a health care setting because of their criminal record.[19] Such discrimination likely\ndecreases service use, but more research in this area is needed.\nTo address these problems of access and discrimination, the Transitions Clinic Network has\nbeen developed specifically for former prisoners. This network is based on the Transition\nClinic model, which includes healthcare delivered by providers experienced with criminal jus-\ntice-involved populations and a case manager with a personal history of incarceration who\ncoordinates resources and provides guidance in chronic disease management. In a 2007 ran-\ndomized trial of 200 recently released prisoners, half received care at a Transitions Clinic (TC)\nand half received an \"expedited primary care appointment at another safety net clinic.\" Investi-\ngators found that the rate of primary care use was similar across groups but there was less utili-\nzation of ED visits among the TC group.[20] Funded under a Centers for Medicare and\nMedicaid Services Innovation award, the TC network is providing care for Medicaid-eligible\nreleased prisoners and is now being evaluated for its ability to lower costs, improve access to\nhealthcare, and improve health. Results will be forthcoming.\nThe current analysis has several limitations and our estimates should be interpreted in the\nproper context--they provide a plausible set of estimates for healthcare coverage eligibility\namong state prisoners with chronic conditions residing in Medicaid expansion and non-expan-\nsion states. However, as with the Cuellar and Cheema study, these estimates are based on data\nfrom a 2004 survey. Although existing data suggests that the size of the prison population and\nlevel of morbidity has changed little over time,[1,21,22] joint data on prisoners' morbidity,\nincome/wealth, and health care eligibility were not available for 2014. Similarly, although the\nthe increase was sufficiently modest (~ 1% point) to not incorporate into our analysis. Addi-\ntionally, our estimates are based on prisoners' disclosure of health status and income, both of\nwhich may be biased by self-report. Nevertheless, our sensitivity analyses of reported income\nprovided plausible bounds for the effect of reported income on the number of prisoners in the\nReleased Prisoners' Healthcare Coverage\ncoverage gap. Another possible limitation is the probable under- and over-reporting of condi-\ntions. Although thorough, the 2004 survey questionnaire did not include all possible health\noutcomes, and we chose to focus our analysis on inmates with a history of health conditions\ngenerally considered to be chronic, as these inmates are likely to require healthcare following\nrelease. Further, we focused our analysis on men because men comprise the vast majority of\nstate prisoners and men and women have different patterns of health conditions, income, and\nhealthcare coverage. With these differences in mind, a similar set of analyses among women\nprisoners are planned for the future.\nWe note that items informing Medicaid and subsidy eligibility such as family situation and\nsentence length were addressed in the 2004 survey, but we found the survey items of insuffi-\ncient specificity to inform our analysis. Accordingly, our estimates are based on eligibility crite-\nria for individuals and not for parents/families, and our analysis assumes that all prisoners will\neventually be released. In fact, greater than 95% are released, most within 2\u00ad3 years.[22] Also, a\nfew non-expansion states have extended Medicaid coverage to populations outside of the ACA\nframework.[23] Typically these expansions cover relatively small populations with restricted\nbenefits as compared to full Medicaid expansion, and none are targeted at prisoners specifi-\ncally; accordingly, this information was not integrated into our analysis. Similarly, our analysis\ndoes not account for other sources of healthcare coverage such as hospital charity care.\nThe next Bureau of Justice Statistics nationally representative survey of prisoners to include\ninformation on health conditions, income, entitlements and healthcare coverage is scheduled\nfor administration in 2015\u00ad16; based on past BJS surveys, we anticipate that these data will not\nbe released until 2019 or later. Until that time, our data may represent the best national esti-\nmates for released prisoners' healthcare coverage eligibility.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, we estimate that about approximately 70,000 male prisoners with a history of\nchronic health problems fall within the healthcare coverage gap. Although existing research\nsuggests that those without coverage will have inadequate healthcare use and poor health,\nmore research is needed to delineate these effects. At the same time, future work should lever-\nage mechanisms to improve healthcare access and health for this marginalized population.\nAlthough healthcare reform remains a contentious issue, there is growing support across the\npolitical spectrum that more resources--including access to healthcare--are needed if prison-\ners are to successfully re-integrate themselves in the communities to which they return.\nDebates over healthcare reform should not impede this important work.\nSupporting Information\nS1 Appendix.
