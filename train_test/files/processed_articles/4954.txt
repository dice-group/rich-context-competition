It is possible to notice some discourses that revealed negative\nperceptions and rejection feelings incorporated by some Gypsies.They feel that they are treated like \"inferior\" persons and\nnot recognized by the whole society.\n",

It is important to realize how\nevents, motivations, and their effects occur, as well as the\ncontexts of occurrence. From our point of view, a more\ndynamic, interactionist and relational perspective is, thus,\ndefensible. The ethnic and national identity is built in a\nway and in a dialectic relation between the I (Us) and the\nOthers (Them), in which the individuals mobilize refer-\nences, symbols, and identitarian markers. Following\nferentiations between subjects as something inherent in\ninteraction have been taken into consideration. The relational\ncharacter between the Us and the Others is portrayed not\nonly in approximations and similarities but also in opposi-\ntions and partings. Following Poutignat and Streiff-Fernart's\n(1995) approach, ethnic identity is the result of a set of\nrepresentations that the interacting groups build whenever\nthey are brought face-to-face.\nThe option for this theme is due, to a great extent, to its\npresent situation in the context of the Portuguese society and\nalso because of the lack of national scientific materials\nregarding this subject and the selected group.\nWe chose to study the Gypsies for two main types of rea-\nsons: It is a group that contrasts and differentiates from the\nmajor society. Despite their condition as national citizens,\nthey constitute a group and an ethnic minority, also classified\nas an \"ill favored minority.\" As far as ethnicity in Portugal is\nconcerned, Gypsies suffer a bigger rejection, polarization\nand dissimilarity.\nSpecifying with more details the reasons for our choice, it\ncannot be denied that although the Gypsies have stayed in\nPortugal for ages, they still remain as an unknown and unrec-\nognized group. Nowadays, most Gypsies who live in national\n1Faculdade de Arquitectura, Lisboa, Portugal\nCorresponding Author:\nMaria Manuela Mendes, Faculdade de Arquitectura, Rua Prof. Cid dos\nEmail: mamendesster@gmail.com\nRepresentations About Discrimination\nPractices in the Education System Built\nby Gypsies (Ciganos) in the Lisbon\nMetropolitan Area (Portugal)\nMaria Manuela Mendes1\n Keywords\nGypsies, discrimination, education system, social representations, ethnicity, social and ethnic relations\n2 SAGE Open\nterritory are sedentary, although the socially broadcast image\nof the Gypsy lifestyle is that of an itinerant and nomadic life.\nEveryday and frequently we come across widespread\nmedia-coverage situations that show discrimination actions\ntoward this group; in Portugal, Gypsies are a group that\ncauses polemic and controversy. In the media and in peo-\nple's speech, Gypsies appear as a problematic group, as a\ngroup that lives within or on the margins of society. In what\nconcerns the cultural characteristics, the Gypsies seem to be\nconfigured in a position of high contrast in the context of the\nPortuguese society--through religious affiliation, use of\nown languages, a strong endogamy, and also through some\naspects that are part of their lifestyle, among which the inten-\nsity of the sociability and intraethnic solidarity (based on a\nstrong social organization, whose fundamental pillar is the\nfamily) stand out.\nIt is estimated that there are 12 million Gypsies in the\nworld, of which two thirds live in Europe. The biggest com-\nmunities are concentrated in Central European countries. In\n1999, a report produced by the Work Group for Equality and\nInsertion of Gypsies for the High Commissioner for\nImmigration and Ethnic Minorities tells about the existence of\n40,000 \"Portuguese citizens that might be considered gypsies\n. . . \" (Alto-Comissariado para a Imigra\u00e7\u00e3o e Minorias \u00c9tnicas\nIn what concerns the itinerary of empiric research and in\na perspective of thorough examination and approximation to\nthe \"real object,\" the documental analysis, the statistical\nanalysis, and the deep interview were mobilized from among\nthe main techniques. This research is based on a method-\nological strategy of investigation marked by a certain plural-\nism and flexibility, where we try to use the most suitable\ntechniques to each level and moment of analysis. It is\ninserted in the tradition of research known as constructiv-\nism, in which the main objective is to portray the multiple\nrealities built through a participated investigation (investiga-\ntion and participant subjects), in which we try to reach the\nmeanings and interpretations built by the subjects (Snape &\nSpencer, 2004). Language and speech being two of the main\nmediations through which the transmission of the social rep-\nresentation is operated, we are going to privilege, as analysis\nmaterial (central corpus), the testimonies got from the 40\ninterviews made to individuals belonging to the Gypsy group\n(with an average duration between 1 hr 30 min and 3 hr). The\nspatial scope of the present study is confined to all the munic-\nipalities that comprise Great Lisbon and Set\u00fabal Peninsula.2\nTherefore, either the space of residence, the workspace, or the\nspace of institutional intervention that directly or indirectly\nintervenes on the potential respondents will be selected as a\nstarting point; in other words, it is focused in the set of \"net-\nworks connection\" of the individual to the various circles of\nsocial inclusion. These various circles assume the interde-\npendence of these sectors and other spheres of functioning,\nwhich are referred to the circles of relationship in which the\nindividual is involved, such as care in public services, access\nto state resources (social, cultural, political, economic, etc.),\nthe working relationship, and even friendship. The informa-\ntion gathered provided a comparison of contexts, situations,\nexperiences, and representation paths, uncovering what is\ncommon standard and specific (singularities) to the group\nand what constitutes diversity. The selection of respondents\nseeks to combine and mix some criteria (sex, nationality,\nmarital exogamous and endogamous, and professional inser-\ntion in various sectors of activity), as the aim was to capture\na variety of situations and grasp contrasting situations, illus-\ntrative of Portuguese Gypsies sufficient and significant.\nThe Representations About the\n\"Lived\" and \"Felt\" Discrimination:\nWhat Is Being Discussed?\nThe analysis presented in this article is centered on the social\nrepresentation built by Gypsies and apprehended through\ntheir oral speeches. According to Jodelet (1994), to represent\nor to be represented constitutes an act of thought through\nwhich an individual relates himself to an object and inter-\nacts. The social representations elaborate themselves through\nand within the field of the communication relations and are,\nsimultaneously, a product and process of a mental activity,\nthrough which individuals and groups reconstitute the real,\ngiving it a specific significance (symbolic dimension).\nProcesses that derive from a social and psychic dynamic inter-\nvene in its production. They configure themselves as ways of\nsocial reconstruction of the reality and construct themselves in\nthe social interaction, \"conflicting and constituent\" (Windish,\nThis level of analysis allows a brief incursion in the sym-\nbolic domain, namely, through the analysis of the significa-\ntions that the actors confer to their practices (Verg\u00e8s, 2001).\nEvery representation is cognitive, as it presupposes knowl-\nedge to deal with the collected information. But this act of\nknowledge is activated through a practice and is influenced\nby the speech that circulates in society.\nThe social representations3 constitute a form of knowl-\nedge that allows the apprehension, evaluation, and explana-\ntion of the reality (Vala, 1986). One of the main functions of\nthe social representations is to familiarize the individuals\nwith what is strange, with the cultural categories as the basis:\nto allow to classify and to nominate people, situations, and\nobjects; to compare, explain, and objectivate behaviors.\nOn studying the social representations, our goal is to\nunderstand the way the individuals apprehend the involving\nworld, in an effort to understand it and solve their problems\n(existential, emotional, relational, etc.). Social sciences study\nhuman beings who think, elaborate questions, and try to find\nanswers, and thus (to be able) state that the individuals and\nthe groups move themselves in a context of a thinking soci-\nety, which they themselves produce through the communica-\ntions they establish (Oliveira & Amaral, 2007). In short, the\nsocial representations are performative, shared, and define a\ncertain social situation, working as a cognitive \"map,\" mak-\ning the social reality understandable, thus ordering the social\nrelations and each one's behaviors as regards the others\nThe production of speech tends to adjust to a situation of\npower-generating purposes, in line with the intentions of the\nsocial agent. This takes place in the language market, where\nthere are power relations and a set of power relations that\ntranscend the situation itself. The field of analysis in this\nstudy refers to contacts, cultures, and language groups; it is\nnoted that these interactions are carried out according to the\nrepresentations, stereotypes, and prejudices that the Gypsies\nbuild. The interactions between Gypsies and other groups and\ntheir environment occur within a \"structured social interac-\ntion.\" Social agents with their conversations or \"talks\" enter\ninto communication in a field in which social positions are\nobjectively structured. According to Bourdieu, \"the other\"\nthat comes into interaction with the \"I\" is part of a power\nrelation that reproduces the unequal distribution of power\nintermediated at the level of global society (Ortiz, 1983).\nThe representations produced by each other may be dis-\ntorted; some of the attributes of the object (human) may\nappear overvalued, others undervalued, others may even be\nsuppressed, yet with a constituent part of the object. In this\npreparation process, it is necessary to meet the specific social\nposition and status of each of the groups, which contributes\nto the specificity and distinctiveness of representations.\nBut our approach has focused on the representations on\ndiscrimination. Our attention will focus on phenomena des-\nignated by the French authors (Balibar, 1990; Guillaumin,\namong others) as institutional racism, which is based on\ntwo ways of functioning, indissociable between themselves:\nthe one of differentiation and the one of hierarchism. The\nformer derives from identitary, communitarian, or cultural\nreferences, expressing itself in the rejection and exclusion of\nthe Other, based on cultural difference (the cultural con-\ntrasts). The institutional racism does not necessarily refer to\nthe political-administrative organization but rather to social\npractices that reflect \"la marque du racisme\" [\"the brand of\nracism\"] and that may assume \"la forme de pratiques socials\nfloues, presque incertaines\" [\"the form of social fluid prac-\nthey assume diffuse, little visible, banal, subtle, dissimulated\nconfigurations; therefore, such practices are sometimes\ndevalued and not recognized by the victims themselves\nbecause they understand them as socially legitimate. The\nhierarchization is grounded on the inferiorization of the\nOther and it corresponds to social processes that aim at plac-\ning the Other in a position of the discriminated and of the\ndominated.\nKnowing about events more associated with institutional\nracism takes us to concentrate our sight on the way some\nsocial spaces work, such as the housing market, the labor\nmarket, school, police intervention, and so on. According to\nPhilippe Bataille (1999), the diffuse and banal practices that\nbecome socially legitimate are accepted as normal. The\nlegitimacy of attitudes and discriminatory practices is based\non an ideology whose grounds are negative representations,\nprejudices, and stereotypes regarding the Other.\nBoth types of discrimination are not exclusive categories.\nThey may coexist, and there are interconnections, though\nsubtle, between institutional racism and cultural racism.\nThis form of racism is grounded on the construction of the\ncultural difference, making difference essential, associating\nit with the construction of representations, prejudices, and\nstereotypes that condition social relations. The difference is\nimposed from the outside, invoking, for example, the ethnic,\nnational, or other origins, and that leads to treating the other\nin a different way. Referring to differentiation, Essed (1991)\ntalks about the objectification of the Other, that is, the atti-\ntude that consists in not recognizing legitimacy to someone\nconsidered inferior, uncivilized, emotional, or primitive.\nThus, the differences that separate the Other from the I (Us)\nare overvalued and exaggerated. Rather than verbalized, dif-\nferentiation is often felt, being rooted in the daily social rela-\ntionships, language, habits, thoughts, access conditions to\ninstitutions as well as state resources (Essed, 1991).\nThe objective is to analyze the representations of social\npractices and not the individuals, although this study is cen-\ntered on the daily experiences lived by the individuals, caught\nthrough the verbal constructions concerning their experi-\nences. We asked the interlocutors or narrators to situate those\nexperiences in the social context they are involved. The con-\ntext is a determining variable, taking into account the condi-\ntionings, the antecedents, and the consequences inherent to\nthe events reported by the interviewed. In this way, it makes\nsense to recall here the notion of \"everyday racism\" as it is\ndefined and used by Philomena Essed (1991). The author\nconsiders that racism is not strictly about the social struc-\ntures and ideologies but rather conceived \"as a process it is\nroutinely created and reinforced through everyday practices\"\n(Essed, 1991, p. 2). Thus, it is possible to conciliate the ideo-\nlogical and structured dimensions of racism and the cognitive\ncomponents, as well as everyday attitudes and experiences.\nThis form of manifestation \"is racism, but not all racism is\neveryday racism\" (Essed, 1991, p. 3), involving systematic,\nrecurrent, familiar, and banal social practices.4 Everyday rac-\nism is a multidimensional phenomenon, and its analysis\nimplies that conciliation between the two interactionist per-\nspectives with the microlocalized character and macro and\nstructuralist theories. Thus, we try to get to know and under-\nstand everyday experiences, exploring both experiential and\ncognitive dimension. The emotions experienced in these\nevents emerge in this analysis context as one more dimension\nof human experience, probably the less visible, less con-\ntrolled, or even known as built. Its interiority makes it diffi-\ncult for the externalization, namely, the verbalization and\napprehension in a research context.\n4 SAGE Open\nSince the end of the 1990s of the last century, the social\npsychologists have renewed their interest about the function\nof emotions while one of the critical components of the inter\ngroup attitudes. Philippe-Leyens et al. (2002) consider that the\nmost basic reaction toward strangers is emotional; in this way,\nthe contemporary theories of prejudice tend to transfer the\ncenter of analysis to its emotional dimensions. Thierry Devos\net al. (2002) also affirm that the effective answers concerning\nnational, ethnic, and religious groups are more consistent and\nreliable predications of attitudes of social distance.\nIn this context and starting from the presumption that the\ndiscrimination occurs in a situation of interaction, it is rele-\nvant to give an answer to several questions, such as, \"How\ndoes discrimination occur, namely in school context?\" \"Who\nare perpetrator agents and what are their motivations?\" But it\nis also important to have access to representations, behavior\nreactions, and emotions experienced by subjects.\nThe knowledge of events associated with institutional\nracism led us to refocus our gaze on the functioning of some\nsocial spaces, such as the housing market, the labor market,\nschool, and police intervention, among other areas. Here, in\nparticular, this analysis focuses on the perceptions and expe-\nriences of the interviewees who are in contact with the edu-\ncation system, which is very relevant given the existence of\nlow levels of schooling between the Gypsies in comparison\nwith the levels of schooling of the non-Gypsy Portuguese\nand other minority groups (immigrants and nonmigrant) that\ncoexist in Portuguese society.\nIn this analysis context, the focus is on narratives about\npersonal experiences or situations lived by people with\nwhom the narrators have affective proximity links, as well as\nthe representations and the emotions about some events.\nBrief Sociodemographic and School\nCharacterization of the Interviewed\nGypsies\nIt is important to characterize, though briefly, the Gypsy\ngroup that was analyzed, namely, the social and demographic\naspects and above all some aspects regarding their schooling,\nof the individuals, and their families.\nAmong the interviewees, the number of males (22 males\nto 18 females), as well as a considerably higher number of\nyouths--about two fourths are below 29 years old--is rela-\ntively higher. It is among these interviewees that the lowest\nlevels of schooling can be found: In a total of 40 interview-\nees, 11 of them had never attended school, 7 of whom cannot\nread or write. However, it is in this group that remain the\nones who have attended at least 1 of the 4 years of schooling.\nMore than a half of the interviewed Gypsies cannot read or\nwrite (7) or have only got basic reading and writing knowledge\n(16). This fact is very worrying mainly among women who\nhardly attend school beyond the first 4 years. None of them\nsucceeded in finishing the GCR (General Certificate of\nEducation), contrasting with men's situation where 3 managed\nto go beyond compulsory education; 2 of them even man-\naged to get a degree (Table 1).\nAmong the 40 Gypsy interviewees, 32 individuals attended\nschool when they were children, whereas the other 8 did not,\nmainly females (6 females vs. 2 males). Nevertheless, half of\nthese interviewees went back to school in adulthood. Once\nmore, we can notice that this group of interviewees is ill-\nfavored regarding the major Portuguese population, because\nin 2001, the illiteracy rate was about 9% (Ine-National\nGirls'nonpermission to attend school and their early leav-\ning are also due to representations and social opinions pro-\nduced, reproduced, and transmitted through several generations\nof Gypsies. They assume such a degree of coercion, which is\nstill difficult to contradict nowadays. The interviewees attri-\nbute these practices to the \"ideas of the older generation,\" to\n\"tradition,\" and to the fact that it is not a \"social practice\"\nwithin the group, as the presence of girls in school is likely\nto degenerate into withdrawal and deviation regarding the\ngroup. Therefore, it is necessary to avoid socializing with\nnon-Gypsies, mainly with boys.\nIn spite of being compulsory to attend the school system\nduring 9 years, this level is far from being accomplished,\nnamely by the Gypsy girls. Among the interviewees' chil-\ndren, there are 15 youths, 7 girls and 8 boys, between 13 and\n18 years of age, who are outside the school system. The dif-\nference between sexes is very evident in the precocity with\nwhich girls leave school, usually between 11 and 14 years,\nand mainly between 13 and 14 years; boys leave school a\nlittle later, as those who do not go to school are between 16\nand 18 years, which means that they quit school when they\nare 15 to 16 years old. It seems that, despite the Social\nInsertion Grant, namely, the insertion plan that is proposed to\nGypsy families, having generally had positive effects in\nwhat concerns the return to and the school attendance of\nchildren, youths, and even adults, its efficiency is still lim-\nited and with gaps.\nTable 1. Schooling Level According to Gender of the Interviewee\nGender \nEducation Male Female Total\nHigher education 2 -- 2\nAs far as children who still attend school are concerned,\nthere are huge discrepancies between the education level and\nthe child's youth or age. It must be pointed out that, despite\nthe progresses that have been achieved during the last years,\nthere are still children who are enrolled in the education sys-\ntem after the age of 6, and attending kindergarten is far from\nbeing usual in the Gypsy group.\nThe Gypsies' Representations in Contexts\nand Situations of Discrimination: The\nEducation System\nRegarding this subject, it is important to pay attention to the\npractices of negative discrimination, which can assume\nmerely manifestations, but they can turn into discriminatory\nbehaviors, as we will refer to later.\nDuring childhood, the experience of contact with school,\nwhich is above all one of the main institutions of socialization\nof the major society, is not always positively evaluated by the\ninterviewees. Alexandrino is 32 and recalls quite well the\ntime when he attended a primary school and when he \"felt a\nlittle discrimination\"; we could perceive that his school expe-\nrience was an emotional one and was marked by some per-\nsonal suffering. The tension and anguish inherent in the fact\nof considering himself different (for him and for the others)\nmay have contributed to his predisposition to victimization.\nLater, those marks vanished when at the age of 14 to 15 he\ncame back to the formal education system, this time in a pro-\nfessional course. Alexandrino recalls how he isolated himself\nfrom the others and could not build relations of friendship and\ncompanionship with the Other schoolfellows.\nBut I suffered because I remember having no friends\nat school, I didn't socialise, I even waited for school to\nfinish to play outside, I remember those situations till\nI got free from that ghost, I think I suffered a bit . . .\nbecause, you know, I felt I was being rejected, and\npeople might be treating me equally, but I saw it my\nown way and thought they were treating me differ-\nently, you know, it was that ghost until I got free, until\nI left school. (32 years old, 6 years of school, admin-\nistration, commerce, and services employee)\nIn spite of having only finished the 2nd year of primary\nschool, Monica still remembers the blameworthy way she\nwas treated by her schoolfellows and the troubled relation-\nships between them. The lack of hygiene and cleanliness is\nthe stigmatizing information that composes the stereotype of\nthe interviewee and that affects her as well as many other\nGypsy girls. The interviewee says,\nWhen we used to enter school, they would start saying\n\"Look at that Gypsy, the Gypsy is this, the Gypsy is\nthat . . . \" Sometimes the kids, during the school break,\nkept beating and provoking one another and calling\nnames \"you're a Gypsy, you've got lice, you're all\ndirty,\" it was always like that. (34 years old, services\nnonqualified worker)\nOther interviewees say that they were treated differently,\nalthough in a supposedly positive way. Marisa remembers\nbeing treated in a privileged way because she was the oppo-\nsite of the stereotype:\nWhen I was six, I remember my schoolteacher intro-\nduced me to the other teachers and said \"look at my\nlittle Gypsy girl, so beautiful she doesn't even seem\nlike a Gypsy.\" And do you know why? Because a\nGypsy is supposed to have lice and be dirty. If it isn't\nlike this, he isn't a Gypsy for sure. (29 years old, ninth\nform, administration, commerce, and services\nemployee)\nIn some schools, Gypsy children tend to be concentrated\nin the same class, despite their different ages, also because\nsome of them have strong family and affective relations and\ntherefore they do not want to be kept separated. Usually in\nthese situations, they have to socialize with younger children\nwho quickly top them in the school tasks. According to\nGamella (1996), this can make them feel a kind of inferiority\nand that will lower their personal and social self-esteem.\nSchool presumes that cultural and ethnic homogeneity will\nfacilitate learning skills.\nFor the interviewees, there is a kind of territorial cleavage\nbetween the metropolitan areas and urban zones and inland\nterritories and small geographic areas. As a matter of fact,\ndiscriminatory events and segregational practices occur in\nremote places in the inland country, and there are no records\nof such occurrences in urban areas. They are ways of pre-\nventing Gypsy children from socializing with non-Gypsies.\nThis may be considered negative, likely to influence nega-\ntively the future representations and relations between\nGypsies and the major society, thus emphasizing and rein-\nforcing segregation. Jo\u00e3o states, \"it is worse from that age\nonwards\" (45 years old, can read and write, nonqualified\nworker, looking for a job). Sara blames non-Gypsies because\n\"Gypsies don't mind socializing with non-Gypsies, these\nones are racist\" (68 years old, 4 years of primary school,\nnonqualified commerce worker). Gl\u00f3ria has six children, and\nthey have never experienced this type of practices. The inter-\nviewee blames the adults as \"children can't be guilty because\nadults are racist, you know\" (37 years old, can read and\nwrite, receives the Social Insertion Income [SII] and helps\nher husband in the fairs).\nJ\u00falio shows his anger for that type of actions as it dimin-\nishes the Gypsies' pride and self-esteem as a group.\n6 SAGE Open\nThe Gypsies are not welcome at school--that is dis-\ncrimination. For example, in a school there are 20\ngentlemen and 10 Gypsies and they don't want them\nthere. No wonder they are revolted. That explains why\nmany can't read, that happened many times . . . that's\nbad because Gypsies want to be part of society and\nthus they can't. People must help. That disgusts me,\nbecause you feel down, but that also makes you feel\nstrong. (33 years old, cannot read or write, administra-\ntion, commerce, and service worker, imprisoned)\nThe interviewees know through television or they have\nheard about conflicts in inland regions where non-Gypsy\nfamilies do not want \"to let their children join the\nGypsies . . . but that is outside the Lisbon area\" (Romana,\nGypsy, 34 years old, Portuguese, cannot read or write,\nhousewife). These behavioral reactions of Gypsy popula-\ntions are classified by Gypsies as racism. The populations\nthat reject the presence of Gypsy children in the schools\ncontradict themselves. For Rui, non-Gypsies tend to state,\n\"No, I'm not racist. I just don't want to have my children\ntogether with Gypsies. This happens because, as I've\nalready told you, we are, we the Gypsies, have been trying\nto integrate for a short time\" (32 years old, 7 school years,\nintermediate- and independent-level technician of com-\nmerce and services).\nThese situations, which cause conflicts between Gypsies\nand non-Gypsies, turn into accusations against Gypsy chil-\ndren with disruptive and unusual behaviors. Clara reveals\nthat she was \"shocked\" with what she saw on TV and won-\nders, \"how can there be people who are capable of doing\nsuch things?\" She still remembers the accusations against\nGypsy children: \"they even say they beat and took knives\nand so. People like these should be helped, otherwise, if\nnobody cares, they will go on\" (29 years old, Portuguese, can\nread and write, nonqualified commerce employee).\nThe manifestations of hostility are started by non-\nGypsies, and for the interviewees, such reactions demon-\nstrate rejection and distance from the major society.\nThe communication relations between family and school\nare sometimes troubled, namely, when conflict situations\nbetween children or eventually between children and auxiliary\nteaching staff occur. In these situations, the family intervenes\nto defend the attacked individual, as F\u00e1bio clearly reports:\nMy brother beat an African, he is 12, and the assistant,\nwho was African too, beat my brother or something\nlike that, he wore glasses, he bled in the teeth. Then\nmy grandma went there and my mother wasn't there,\nwe were not there, she went out in the morning and we\ndidn't find her. She defended her race. That was rac-\nism. (16 years old, attends a professional course)\nSome of the interviewees point out that the teaching\u00ad\nlearning process the child is subjected to at school is\ndifferent from the non-Gypsy one. David refers that there are\nteachers who, to get rid of some children, let them pass the\nyear, although they have not achieved the minimum\nobjectives:\nWhen they are fed up with those children . . . they\ncan't stand them anymore . . . they don't want to be\nwith them for another school year. Although the child\nrequires a bit more attention, they can't stand her\nbecause that's a naughty child. I think that a teacher\nmust be an expert in dominating, like psychologists.\n(37 years old, 4 years at primary school, unemployed,\nnonqualified worker, job seeker)\nSome people, like Cristiana, think that in some schools,\nthe teachers neglect the Gypsy child's learning process. The\nchild, who feels discriminated, consequently rejects school\n\"because teachers only teach non-Gypsies\" (43 years old, 9\nschool years, receiving SII, nonqualified commerce worker).\nLabeled as \"difficult children,\" disobedient to rules, aggres-\nsive, hyperactive, undisciplined, feeling rejected and unwel-\ncome, they may refuse going to school, feeling outside and\nfrustrated.\nDavid points out the difficulties experienced at school by\nchildren who live in poor slums labeled as dangerous and\nproblematic. At school, children are treated in a different\nway suffering the stigma of being aggressive and \"wild\" (37\nyears old, Portuguese, 4 years at primary school, unem-\nployed, nonqualified worker, job seeker).\nIt's becoming a relatively usual practice within the territo-\nrial context analyzed to enroll the children on a school as\nsoon as they are six. However, it is less common and almost\nrare to enroll them in nursery schools. At that age, the child\nand its own family are not prepared for schooling yet, because\nthe children are not used to being closed, nor even sitting for\na couple of hours; they have no rules associated with order,\nassiduity, and so on. Daniel, 38, graduate, has a life and\nschool course that can be still considered singular among\nPortuguese Gypsies. He thoroughly describes the main diffi-\nculties of adaptation of these children in school context:\nThen . . . those children getting used to stay there for\n6, 7 hours, isn't it? Almost running--they have that\nshort break--I must admit . . . not 6 hours, from 8 till\n13, isn't it? Around 5 hours with a short break. But\nthat's too long . . . too long for someone who never\n. . . who has never been used to . . . habits. Suddenly,\nyou're there closed--I can't say imprisoned, because\nit isn't, poor guy, it's not that bad, school isn't that bad\n. . . but I try to understand why they can't find motiva-\ntion. But that's not all. They are used to play in the\nslum.\nIn the Gypsy context, the strategies of socialization and\nthe type of education usually adopted by parents, which\nseem to be distant from what school preconizes, must be taken\ninto account. Regarding the socialization of these children, the\nrelational and affective dynamics assumes a particular impor-\ntance at intrafamily relationships and communitarian ones.\nAccording to J.-P. Li\u00e9geois (1987), \"a child's education is col-\nlective. It usually lives within three or four generations, and\nits socialisation takes place in this set which reinsures cohe-\nsion, coherence, continuity and safety\" (p. 61). Actually,\nsocialization is not unidimensional; there is always a game\nof multiple influences, thus being \"multidimensional and\nsystematic\" (Seabra, 1994, p. 30), as children's preparation\nlies on life experience basis.\nIt is also worth pointing out teachers' stereotypes regard-\ning Gypsy families, that cannot help being noticed by the\ninterviewees themselves. They are aware that, generally, par-\nents are considered hostile to school; the functioning codes\nand the language used by teachers and other school staff seem\ndistant and unintelligible. The noncommunication with\nschool is also related with family projects and family organi-\nzation; the importance of habitus, which integrates all the past\nsocial experiences and of ethnic capital. There is a feeling of\nbeing outside school, a telling of impotence regarding school,\nthere is actually a failure of knowledge and expectations.\nAmong the interviewees, the existence of a real lack of\nassistance and investment in preschooling of Gypsy children\nis evident. The lack of or scarce qualifications of parents, as\nwell as the rhythms that mark their economic activity, inter-\nfere in the lack of accompaniment of these children. However,\nparents show a protecting educational style and find that\ntheir children either in kindergarten or at school do not\ndeserve the same protection and attention of teachers, thus\ninternalizing exclusion feelings. In these contexts, external\nto the family and the group, children are not as protected as\nwithin the family (Seabra, 1994, p. 98). Nelson is a defender\nof Gypsy children's preschooling and says,\nThat should have been done 20 years ago. Because if\nit had been done 20 years ago, people would have\nmore time to do other things and kids would be\nbrought up in a different way. They might come back\nhome and behave differently, but something remains\nthere. (30 years old, Portuguese, 6 years of school,\nadministration, commerce, and services employee)\nThe objective conditions of existence have a great impact\non the school life of these children, as well as personal and\nfamily motivation. Going to school is still an obligation, not a\npriority. Jorge refers to the importance of school in the system\nof values of the Gypsy group:\nWhile the ordinary citizen is educated so that school\nmay be an essential thing in life, as a kid he's brought\nup at home, he goes to school because he is made to\nand when he finishes he'll go to the fairs, so school\nwon't be of any good. (47 years old, higher education,\nintellectual and scientific high-qualified worker)\nSchool is still seen by Gypsies as an institution of the\nmajor society (non-Gypsy), with which a relationship of sus-\npicion and fear is kept. According to Jorge, school is for\nGypsies a \"state entity that has lasted for centuries, and the\nstate has always served to keep us down, to push us, to beat us,\nit has served for nothing\" (47 years old, Portuguese, university\ndegree, intellectual and scientific high-qualified worker).\nBesides, the pedagogical procedures at school do not\nseem to coincide with the ones handled within the family.\nLearning based on real experiences is privileged, that is,\nknowledge is knowing how to know, knowing how to be,\nknowing how to do, and essentially doing to do. As Li\u00e9geois\n(1987) says, the pedagogical procedures \"take place in the\ncontext of real tasks and through the participation, not through\na verbal instruction, and as preparation for a future participa-\ntion\" (p. 63). The pedagogic contents are also very distinct, so\nthe same author points out that for Gypsies, the problems are\nessentially the daily ones, \"those of personal interaction, the\nlogical formal generalisations are unknown, not useful and\nreplaced by real and particular symbolisms that refer to shared\nIt is also worth saying that, due to the living conditions\nand the set of values of the ethnic Gypsy group, the early\ncontact of the child with books and school articles is not\nusual. The access to video is easy, as well as to Playstation\ngames, Gameboy, DVD, which can condition their learning\nin school context. Another kind of difficulties these children\nmay go through has to do with the lack of help when doing\nschoolwork. Filipe says, \"the family relatives are `old fash-\nioned,' they can't read or write\" (29 years old, Portuguese, 3\nschool years, nonqualified worker, imprisoned). However,\nthe difficulties and limitations regarding reading and writing\nare also evident as the children tend to write and speak hav-\ning as reference point the pronunciation used in the oral\ncommunication among Gypsies.\nThe logic of organization within the Gypsy group seems to\nbe far from the way the school institution is structured. Its life-\nstyle is based on the present, the immediate, the survival, and\nthe management of everyday life, valuing the results rather\nthan the processes. Owning a certain level of schooling is not\nimportant for the ethnic and relational capital of the individual\nwithin his in-group. Nevertheless, the "
