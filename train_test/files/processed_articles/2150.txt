    "abstract": "Abstract\nRecently, genetic association findings for nicotine dependence, smoking behavior, and smoking-related diseases converged\nto implicate the chromosome 15q25.1 region, which includes the CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4 cholinergic nicotinic receptor\nsubunit genes. In particular, association with the nonsynonymous CHRNA5 SNP rs16969968 and correlates has been\nreplicated in several independent studies. Extensive genotyping of this region has suggested additional statistically distinct\nsignals for nicotine dependence, tagged by rs578776 and rs588765. One goal of the Consortium for the Genetic Analysis of\nSmoking Phenotypes (CGASP) is to elucidate the associations among these markers and dichotomous smoking quantity\n(heavy versus light smoking), lung cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We performed a meta-\nanalysis across 34 datasets of European-ancestry subjects, including 38,617 smokers who were assessed for cigarettes-per-\n(mutually adjusted p-values,10235 and ,1028 respectively). Because the risk alleles at these loci are negatively correlated,\ntheir association with smoking is stronger in the joint model than when each SNP is analyzed alone. Rs578776 also\nassociation with COPD (p = 0.01); the other loci are not significantly associated with either lung cancer or COPD after\nadjusting for rs16969968. This study provides strong evidence that multiple statistically distinct loci in this region affect\nsmoking behavior. This study is also the first report of association between rs588765 (and correlates) and smoking that\nachieves genome-wide significance; these SNPs have previously been associated with mRNA levels of CHRNA5 in brain and\nlung tissue.\nCitation: Saccone NL, Culverhouse RC, Schwantes-An T-H, Cannon DS, Chen X, et al.

Lung\ncancer is the illness most identified with smoking, and its\nprevalence over time mirrors per capita tobacco consumption [1].\nThere has been a reduction in smoking in the United States, and\na concomitant decline in the incidence of lung cancer is\nbeginning to emerge. Nonetheless more people die from lung\ncancer each year than from any other cancer [2]. Chronic\nobstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), another serious lung\ndisease largely attributable to smoking, is also among the leading\ncauses of death.\nRecently, genetic findings for nicotine dependence and\nsmoking related diseases converged to implicate the chromosome\ncluster of cholinergic nicotinic receptor subunit genes. The\nnicotine dependence locus tagged by the single nucleotide\nreplicated for smoking related traits including cigarettes-per-day\nand heavy smoking [3\u00ad11], and has been reported as the most\nsignificant association genome-wide in very recent meta-analyses\n[12\u00ad14]. This locus has also been associated with risk for lung\ncancer and COPD in several genome-wide association studies\n(GWAS) [6,15\u00ad18]. This represents an exciting overlap of\ngenetic findings for nicotine dependence and smoking\nrelated diseases. Though different SNPs may be reported by\neach study, the high correlation between the associated SNPs\nthe same locus in European-ancestry populations. The SNP\nalpha5 receptor subunit protein and has been shown to affect\nreceptor function [19].\nExtensive genotyping of the CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4\nregion has provided potential evidence for at least two additional\ndistinct signals for nicotine dependence [4,7,8,20]. A second locus,\ntagged by rs578776, is associated with nicotine dependence and\nsmoking in several samples of European-ancestry, with the minor\nallele protective in the sense that it is elevated in controls; rs578776\npopulations (r2 = 0.24 in the HapMap CEU panel), though the\nlinkage disequilibrium (LD) coefficient |D'| is 1. A third\nimportant locus in this region is a group of highly correlated\n(or correlates) are studied together, three common haplotypes are\nobserved, each with distinct effects on risk [7,22]. There are hints\nthat other, less common variants (minor allele frequency\n(MAF)#5%) also contribute to nicotine dependence in this region,\nshown a relatively strong odds ratio of 0.73 in European-American\nsubjects [4].\nWith the support of the National Institute on Drug Abuse\n(NIDA), we formed the Consortium for the Genetic Analysis of\nSmoking Phenotypes (CGASP), which includes smoking, lung\ncancer, and COPD researchers, to enable the pursuit of several\nresearch goals. For this first analysis project we focused on the\nCHRNB4. Specifically, we focused on the four distinct loci\ndiscussed above, which have low correlation with each other\nand have demonstrated evidence for involvement in nicotine\ndependence. Analyses were undertaken to investigate two\nquestions: first, are there multiple statistically distinct genetic loci\nin this region that exert independent effects on smoking, and\nsecond, are similar patterns of genetic risk shared across smoking,\nlung cancer, and COPD.\nMethods\nEthics statement\nThis study was conducted according to the principles expressed\nin the Declaration of Helsinki and obtained informed consent from\nparticipants and approval from the appropriate institutional\nreview boards.\nSamples and study design\nAll subjects included in these meta-analyses were current or\nformer smokers of European ancestry. Results from 34 datasets,\nwhich include a total of 38,617 unrelated subjects who were\nassessed for cigarettes-per-day, contributed to the meta-analyses.\nEight of the datasets were drawn from family-based studies and\ncontributed only a subset of unrelated individuals to these analyses.\nTable 1 gives sample sizes and demographics of each participating\nstudy sample. Text S1 describes additional details for each dataset,\nincluding ascertainment criteria and genotyping methods, and\ndocuments that four datasets are also members of other consortia.\nAll datasets contributed to the analyses of smoking. A subset of\nthese 34 datasets also had information on lung cancer cases and\nlung-cancer-free smoker controls (6 datasets, N = 13,614 smokers)\nand/or COPD cases and COPD-free smoker controls (4 datasets,\nN = 6,182 smokers). The data for these traits are described in\nTable 2 and Table 3 respectively.\nTraits for analysis\nThe traits examined were smoking quantity, lung cancer, and\nCOPD. Two smoking traits were derived from measurements of\ncigarettes smoked per day (CPD): a 4-level categorical trait\ndichotomous trait contrasting subjects from the lowest smoking\ncategory (CPD#10: light-smoking ``controls'') to those in the two\nhighest categories combined (CPD.20: heavy smoking cases). The\ndichotomous trait of heavy versus light smoking was our primary\ntrait for analysis. For one study (NAG-Finland), which used\ndifferent boundaries to record CPD as detailed in the supplemen-\ntal material, the distribution of CPD was examined to harmonize\nAuthor Summary\nNicotine binds to cholinergic nicotinic receptors, which are\ncomposed of a variety of subunits. Genetic studies for\nsmoking behavior and smoking-related diseases have\nimplicated a genomic region that encodes the alpha5,\nalpha3, and beta4 subunits. We examined genetic data\nacross this region for over 38,000 smokers, a subset of\nwhich had been assessed for lung cancer or chronic\nobstructive pulmonary disease. We demonstrate strong\nevidence that there are at least two statistically indepen-\ndent loci in this region that affect risk for heavy smoking.\nOne of these loci represents a change in the protein\nstructure of the alpha5 subunit. This work is also the first to\nreport strong evidence of association between smoking\nand a group of genetic variants that are of biological\ninterest because of their links to expression of the alpha5\ncholinergic nicotinic receptor subunit gene. These advanc-\nes in understanding the genetic influences on smoking\nbehavior are important because of the profound public\nhealth burdens caused by smoking and nicotine addiction.\nIndependent Chromosome 15q25.1 Loci Affect Smoking\nthe phenotypes and select alternative boundaries. The numbers of\nsubjects in each smoking category, total and by study, are given in\nTable 1. Lung cancer and COPD were analyzed as dichotomous\ntraits. COPD cases were defined to have COPD as determined by\npost-bronchodilator spirometry as GOLD Stage II or worse\n(N = 1,719), or self-reported COPD, emphysema or chronic\nbronchitis.\nSNPs for analysis\nIn European-ancestry populations, each of the four loci of\ninterest can be represented by various highly correlated SNPs\n(SNPs having high r2 with each other). For each locus, we chose\ncorrelations between any two of these loci are r2,0.5 (Table S1).\nIn samples for which a given target SNP was not available, we\nchose a highly correlated proxy SNP based on r2 computed with\nHaploview [26] using downloaded HapMap CEU genotype data,\nRelease 23 [27]. Table S2 lists the proxy SNPs used and their r2\nwith the corresponding target SNPs. Figure S1 displays the SNPs\nfor each of the 4 loci in relation to the CHRNA5-CHRNA3-\nCHRNB4 cluster.\nTable 1.

The scripts were executed by each\nparticipating site, and the results returned to the coordinating\ngroup.\nIn each dataset, associations between the loci and the traits were\nevaluated using logistic regression. Our primary analysis model\ncoded genotypes additively as the number of copies of the minor\nallele according to the HapMap CEU reference population. This\nallele is referred to as the ``coded allele'' (C) and the major allele is\nreferred to as the ``reference allele'' (R). To confirm the\nappropriateness of the additive model, for each locus a 2 degree\nof freedom model including the additive term and a heterozygote\ndeviation term was evaluated. The analyses of the 4-level CPD\ntrait used generalized logistic regression to obtain separate effect\nestimates (beta coefficients) for each category with respect to the\nlowest smoking category as the referent. All these association\nanalyses included sex and age as covariates. In addition, lung\ncancer and COPD analyses included categorical cigarettes-per-day\nas an unordered covariate.\nAssociation results from each dataset, including the beta\ncoefficient and standard error, were provided to the coordinating\nteam. Meta-analysis was carried out using PLINK [29] to obtain\noverall summary odds ratios (ORs) and statistics. The R package\nrmeta [30] was used to verify results and create plots. There was\nno evidence of significant heterogeneity across datasets for these\nanalyses (minimum heterogeneity p = 0.21 for dichotomous CPD,\nnominally significant p was seen only for category 3 and locus 1\n(p = 0.007)). Because of varying study designs, ascertainment\nstrategies, and representative SNPs, we nevertheless report results\nfrom random effects meta-analyses.\nbeen shown to have functional effects on the resulting alpha5-\ncontaining receptor [19]. Therefore an important question is\nwhether the remaining loci demonstrate additional independent\neffects on disease risk. Although loci 2, 3 and 4 are not highly\ncorrespond to a low r2 if the alleles that tend to co-occur on the\nsame haplotype have very different allele frequencies. Previous\nresults in the COGEND data suggest that there may be\nindependent or synergistic effects on nicotine dependence between\nlocus 1 and locus 3 [4], and haplotype analyses in the Utah and\nLHS samples [7], and in the COGEND and CPS-II-CPD samples\n[22], also indicate effects of haplotypes containing loci 1, 2 and 3.\nTo test whether additional loci contribute to dichotomous\nincluded both locus 1 and each of the other loci in the logistic\nregression models adjusting for sex and age, with and without a\nSNP6SNP interaction term. For lung cancer and COPD the\nmodels also included categorical cigarettes-per-day as an unor-\ndered covariate. These results were then meta-analyzed as\ndescribed above. The SNP6SNP interaction term was never\nsignificant in the meta-analysis (p.0.3), so we report results from\nthe joint models without interactions.

For dichotomous smoking quantity we also tabulated\npair-wise joint genotype by case status counts for locus 1\ncontributing datasets that had both loci.\nMultiple test correction\nAcross the four target loci, multiple traits (4), the multiple\nmodels (additive and additive+heterozygote deviation), and the 2-\nSNP joint analyses (3 loci), our study was designed to perform\nfewer than 80 tests.

For each locus, frequencies are similar across studies and\nproxy SNPs, and similar to the frequencies in the HapMap CEU\nreference population.\nAll reported results are based on additive models.

In fact, when locus 1 is not\ntaken into account, the effect of locus 3 is potentially masked, and\nthe effect of the minor allele is in an opposite direction (protective\nversus risk).\nTo further examine these interesting results for locus 1 and locus\n3, we show the number of heavy and light smokers in each joint\ngenotype class, and corresponding odds ratios using the genotype\nthat is homozygous for both reference (major) alleles as the\nreference group (Table 6). The reference alleles (major in HapMap\nCEU) are labeled ``R'' and the coded alleles (minor in HapMap\nCEU) are labeled ``C''.\nThe first important observation is that there are very few\nsubjects in certain cells, namely the cells corresponding to RC/CC\nat locus 1/locus 3, CC/RC, and CC at both loci. This table\ntherefore reveals that the risk alleles at locus 1 (C) and locus 3 (C)\nare negatively correlated, and explains why the effect of rs588765\nreflects the high |D'| between the loci.\nThe second observation is that for the remaining, well\npopulated cells, the coded allele at locus 3 increases risk on the\nFigure 1.

Our results contribute important new insights\nabout genetic risk for these traits. In particular, we demonstrate\nstrong evidence that smoking behavior is influenced by multiple\ndistinct loci in this region, including two loci that are associated\nwith relevant biological effects in functional studies.\nFirst, our results show that locus 1, representing the CHRNA5\nhighly significant association with smoking behavior (OR = 1.33,\nTable 5.

The association evidence for both SNPs is strengthened in\nthe joint analysis, with a reversal of the direction of effect for locus\n3. This evidence of statistically independent association for locus 3\nwith smoking in our analysis is compelling given that these SNPs\nhave also been implicated in altered mRNA levels for CHRNA5 in\nbrain and lung tissue from European-ancestry subjects [21,22,24].\nThus, both statistical and functional evidence indicate that at least\none SNP correlated with CHRNA5 mRNA levels is involved in\nrisk, and highlight locus 3 as an important group of SNPs for\nfurther investigation.\ncorrelates) shows evidence for involvement in heavy/light\nsmoking.

Because of the low allele\nfrequency of this variant, the power to detect an effect is lower\nthan for the other three loci.\nThis meta-analysis therefore highlights locus 1, locus 2, and\nlocus 3, and indicates dependencies in their effects on risk for\nheavy smoking. Haplotypes based on these three loci have been\ndescribed [7,22] and are seen in HapMap CEU, where the\nTable 7.

Across all these\npublished studies, the high-risk haplotype carries the risk allele at\none haplotype carries that allele. Among the remaining haplo-\ntypes, a low risk haplotype is obtained when the minor allele at\nlocus 2 or the major allele at locus 3, or both, is paired with the\nTaken together, our meta-analysis results argue strongly for the\nexistence of at least two statistically distinct loci in this region that\naffect risk for heavy smoking. In particular, both locus 1 and locus\n3, which have known functional effects, are genome-wide\nsignificant in joint, mutually-adjusted analysis. The minor allele\nat locus 3 shifts from a marginally significant protective factor\nwhen considered alone to a robust risk factor when considered in\ncombination with locus 1. The statistical evidence and negatively\ncorrelated alleles at locus 1 and locus 3 are consistent with at least\ntwo mechanistic models: distinct effects of two loci where the\nminor allele at each locus increases risk across a constant\nbackground at the other locus, or a haplotype dose effect where\nalleles at the two loci act in concert on the same haplotype strand.\nIn the latter model, the minor-major and major-minor haplotypes\neach increase risk relative to the major-major haplotype, as can be\nseen in Table 6 once it is recognized that the rarity of the minor-\nminor haplotype implies that the double-heterozygote cell\nessentially represents the minor-major and major-minor diplotype.\nIt is also possible that multiple rare variants underlie these findings,\nas has been suggested in general for disease associations with\ncommon SNPs [33]. It remains possible that these associations\nwith locus 1, locus 2 and locus 3 are reflecting correlation with yet\nanother underlying, untyped variant that alone explains the\naltered biology leading to risk. However, biological involvement of\nmultiple loci appears more likely given that two of these loci\nrepresent two distinct, relevant functional consequences: namely,\nFigure 5.

Further\ninvestigation via resequencing, biological/functional assays, and\nanimal models is needed to dissect the causal biology that underlies\nthe statistical evidence.\nAn important open question is the degree to which the\nassociations between chr15q25 variants and lung cancer are due\nto their effects on smoking. When comparing smoking and lung\ncancer single-SNP results, the patterns of association (odds ratios\nand directions of effect) were similar across the loci studied. Locus\n1 is associated with lung cancer even when controlling for amount\npossible direct genetic effects of locus 1 on this cancer, at least in\nthe presence of smoking. However, CPD is not a sufficient proxy\nfor carcinogen exposure [34], and in never-smokers there is a lack\nof association between locus 1 and lung cancer [35\u00ad37], so it is\npossible that more refined adjustment for smoking will reduce or\nabolish this association.\nFor lung cancer, after controlling for categorical CPD and\neffects of locus 1, we were not able to definitively demonstrate\nassociation at either locus 2 or locus 3 after correction for multiple\ntests. For the mutually adjusted analysis of locus 1 and locus 3 for\nlung cancer, we observed the same change in the direction for the\nlocus 3 odds ratio that we observed in the joint-SNP analysis of\nsmoking. However, unlike what was seen for smoking, for lung\ncancer the magnitude (and significance) of the effects did not\nincrease. There are several possible reasons for this, including:\nchance, the smaller sample size for lung cancer, or qualitative\ndifferences in the relationship between these loci and smoking\nbehavior versus the relationship between these loci and lung\ncancer (after adjusting for smoking quantity). This highlights the\nchallenges posed when attempting to dissect the contributions of\nmultiple loci of modest effect on complex, correlated traits. Further\nstudies, and larger sample sizes, are needed.\nFor COPD, when controlling for cigarettes-per-day we did not\nfind evidence for association with any of the loci after correction for\nthan for smoking and lung cancer. The COPD analyses were based\non smaller samples than those available for CPD or for lung cancer.\nVery recently, three other large smoking genetics consortia\npublished their meta-analysis findings that confirm locus 1\nSNPs) as the locus most associated with smoking quantity,\ngenome-wide [12\u00ad14]. All three studies used linear regression to\ntest for association with either quantitative CPD value [14] or\nconsortia also report results from conditional analyses in which a\nlocus 1 SNP was included as a covariate, paralleling our joint\nanalyses.\nIn contrast to our novel finding in CGASP of genome-wide\nsignificance for locus 3 when analyzed jointly with locus 1, none of\nthe other consortia report strong evidence for locus 3 when paired\nwith locus 1. In the Oxford-GSK study [13], imputation using\n1000 Genomes data detected the most significant single-SNP\nTable 8.

They do not report on whether the evidence\nfor locus 1 and locus 3 strengthens in the joint analysis compared\nto single-SNP analysis, as we observed in the CGASP datasets.\nThey do note that there is no obvious residual association with a\nthird SNP after conditioning on either the pairing of locus 1\nwith the correlation and haplotype structure of these three loci\ndiscussed previously.\nIn the ENGAGE study [12], conditioning on the locus 1 SNP\nIn TAG [14], the conditional analyses indicated residual\ncance. These SNPs are each correlated with locus 2, and much less\nthat differences in samples, phenotype definitions, or analysis methods\nmay be contributing to the differences between our strong findings for\nlocus 3 and the three other consortium reports. To further understand\nthe genetic contributions in this region, more work is needed, and\nnot only statistical evidence but also biological evidence will be\nimportant.\nIn summary, our meta-analysis demonstrates significant, robust\nassociation of locus 1, representing the non-synonymous CHRNA5\nsmoking heaviness across very diverse datasets. Our study also\ndemonstrates strong evidence that at least one additional distinct\nlocus in this region affects risk for heavy smoking.

Our result also has implications for all\ngenetic association studies, as it illustrates that joint analysis of\nSNPs is an important tool for identifying genome-wide significant\neffects that, soberingly, may be obscured in single SNP analyses.\nOur study used multiple highly correlated SNPs to represent\neach of the 4 tested loci, depending on availability in each dataset,\nand all subjects were of European ancestry. Hence this study is not\ndesigned to determine which SNP(s), among the highly correlated\nSNPs for each locus, are most likely to be biologically involved.\nFuture work, involving large-scale meta-analysis of other popula-\ntions (e.g. Asian or African ancestry) to capitalize on LD\ndifferences between populations, comprehensive functional anno-\ntation of genetic variants, DNA re-sequencing and variant\ndiscovery, and functional and animal studies may help narrow\ndown these large sets of correlated SNPs to the most promising\ncausal alleles.\nSupporting Information\nFigure S1 The CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4 region containing\nrepresent each locus are drawn with dotted lines connecting them\nto each other.\nFigure S2 Forest plot for dichotomous CPD and locus 4.\nFigure S3 Forest plot for lung cancer and locus 4.\nTable S1 Correlation (r-squared) between the four target SNPs\nTable S2 Correlation (r-squared) between the target SNPs and\ntheir proxies (HapMap CEU Release 23).\nTable S3 Genotyped SNPs and overall allele frequencies, by\nsample dataset.\nText S1 Descriptions of contributing datasets.
