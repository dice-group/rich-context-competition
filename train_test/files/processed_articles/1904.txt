In the clinical setting, accurate identification of patients with renal insufficiency combined with routine\nABI measurement in this group would greatly enhance efforts to detect subclinical PAD.

We used ankle-brachial index (ABI) measure-\nments from the National Health and Nutrition Examination\nMethods\nData Sources\nSince the early 1960s, the National Center for Health Statistics\nhas conducted a series of cross-sectional national surveys of the\nnoninstitutionalized civilian population. In each survey, the\npopulation was sampled with a complex, stratified, multistage\nprobability cluster sampling design to provide data that are\nrepresentative of the overall United States population. Beginning\nin 1999, NHANES became a continuous survey, and NHANES\ninvolved collection of interview, examination, and laboratory\ndata. However, unlike prior surveys, the present survey included\na detailed lower-extremity examination that involved ABI mea-\nsurement, a noninvasive measure of lower-extremity atheroscle-\nestimate the prevalence and correlates of PAD as indicated by a\nlow ABI.

Persons with bilateral amputations\nor weighing more than 400 pounds were excluded. Supine systolic\npressure was measured in 1 arm (brachial artery) and both ankles\n(posterior tibial arteries). The ABI was calculated by dividing the\nmean systolic blood pressure in the arm by the mean systolic\nblood pressure in the respective ankle. For the purposes of this\nanalysis, the lowest ABI obtained for either leg was taken as the\nABI measurement for that patient.

A high prevalence in this group of other\nestablished cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes and\nhypertension, in addition to a high prevalence of existing\ncoronary artery and cerebrovascular disease, also contributes\nto the high unadjusted association of renal insufficiency with\nlow ABI. Several traditional cardiovascular risk factors, such\nas cholesterol and smoking, are no more prevalent among\npersons with renal insufficiency than among those with\nnormal renal function and thus do not appear to explain the\ncross-sectional association seen here between ABI and renal\ninsufficiency.\nThere are several possible explanations for the high ad-\njusted association of renal insufficiency with low ABI. One\npossibility is that renal insufficiency may be a marker for\nmore generalized atherosclerosis. In support of this, the\npresence of baseline cardiovascular disease is independently\nassociated with progression to end-stage renal disease among\npatients with chronic kidney disease.14 Alternatively, there\nmay be a causal association between renal insufficiency and\nprogression of lower-extremity atherosclerosis. Potential\npathophysiological mechanisms by which decreased CRCL\nitself might predispose to PAD include altered calcium-\nphosphorus, homocysteine, and lipoprotein(a) metabolism\nand alterations in inflammatory and coagulation pathways.9\nAccurate diagnosis of PAD is important. Low ABI is\nassociated with an increased risk of stroke, myocardial\ninfarction, and cardiovascular death, and PAD is known to\naffect lower-extremity function and quality of life.15 Several\nspecific interventions, such as exercise training16 and statin\ntherapy,17 are effective in reducing the functional limitation\nassociated with PAD. Unfortunately, in part owing to the lack\nof specific PAD symptomatology, clinician awareness of\nPAD in the primary care setting is notoriously low,15,18 which\ntranslates into missed opportunities to prescribe specific\ntherapy for PAD and to implement general cardiovascular\nrisk reduction measures for this high-risk group.18\nRelative to methods for detecting other forms of cardio-\nvascular disease (eg, cardiac stress testing), ABI measure-\nment is a simple, noninvasive procedure that can be per-\nformed easily in the outpatient setting.15 Routine ABI\nmeasurement could be used to identify patients with subclin-\nical PAD who might benefit from educational and therapeutic\ninterventions for PAD. Early identification of PAD before\nprogression to advanced ischemia may be particularly impor-\ntant in patients with renal insufficiency, given data showing\nthat patients with renal insufficiency who undergo lower-\nextremity bypass are more likely than those with normal renal\nfunction to present with gangrene and ischemic ulceration at\nthe time of surgery and to experience postoperative death and\ncardiovascular complications.19\nIn addition, because of the well-documented association of\nlow ABI with cardiovascular mortality, ABI measurement\ncould also help to target patients at highest risk for cardio-\nvascular death as candidates for secondary prevention efforts.\nThe present results show that self-reported history of coro-\nnary artery disease is an insensitive predictor of low ABI in\npatients with renal insufficiency. Thus, measurement of ABI\nTABLE 2. Logistic Regression Analyses for Association of ABI\n  (Defined as Estimated CRCL <60\nUnadjusted Model 1 Model 2\nModel 1 is adjusted for age, gender, and race. Model 2 is further adjusted\nfor comorbid conditions (including diabetes, indicators of diabetes severity,\nhistory of coronary artery disease, stroke, and hypertension), BMI, total\ncholesterol, diastolic and systolic blood pressures, and smoking history.\nhttp://circ.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\nin patients with renal insufficiency could contribute valuable\ninformation on cardiac risk beyond what is supplied by the\nmedical history alone.\nNHANES provides nationally representative data and\novercomes many problems of sampling bias, but the present\nfindings must be interpreted in the context of the study\ndesign. Specifically, it is unclear from these cross-sectional\ndata whether renal insufficiency is a true causal \"risk factor\"\nfor the development of PAD. Although renal insufficiency\ndoes appear to be associated with the future development of\nclaudication,20 further studies are needed to measure the\nassociation of baseline renal insufficiency with progression of\nPAD and future PAD events. A second concern is that the\npresent analysis may underestimate the prevalence of PAD in\npersons with renal insufficiency because of the high preva-\nlence of vascular calcification in this group, leading to falsely\nelevated ABIs. In this situation, a toe brachial index may be\na more accurate screening test for PAD. We are unable to\novercome this limitation because toe pressures were not\nConclusions\nPAD is remarkably common in persons with renal insuffi-\nciency, and there is an independent cross-sectional associa-\ntion between PAD and renal insufficiency. In the primary\ncare setting, the combination of accurate diagnosis of renal\ninsufficiency (either via measurement or estimation of CRCL\nor via estimation of glomerular filtration rate) and routine\nABI measurement in this group would facilitate more effi-\ncient identification of patients with subclinical PAD, a group\nmost likely to benefit from PAD-specific educational inter-\nventions and therapy and also from more general cardiovas-\ncular risk-reduction efforts.\n"
