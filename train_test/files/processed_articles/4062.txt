In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), a few studies\nhave also addressed the linkages between family structures\nand sexual debut (Babalola, 2004; Babalola, Tambashe, &\nDjamba, 2003; Kumi-Kyereme,Awusabo-Asare, Biddlecom,\nMaharaj, & Magnani, 2006). Empirically, studies in both\ndeveloped and SSA uncovered similar results: Youth who\nresided with two married biological parents reported later\nage at sexual initiation. The linkages between family envi-\nronment and premarital intercourse have practical policy\nimplications because early sexual initiation is often associ-\nated with the risks of contracting HIV/AIDS, sexually trans-\nmitted infections (STIs), and unwanted pregnancies. These\nrisks are drastically higher in SSA compared with any other\nregion around the world (Clark, 2004; Mensch, Grant, &\nBlanc, 2006; Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/\nAIDS [UNAIDS], 2011; Zaba, Pisani, Slaymaker, & Boerma,\nNotwithstanding this body of research, only few studies\nhave included in their analyses the potential influences of\nparent\u00adchild interactions (e.g., quality of parent\u00adchild rela-\ntionships, parent\u00adchild communication, and parental con-\ntrol). Yet, scholars suggested that family processes--referred\nto as parent\u00adchild interactions--may have a high explana-\ntory power (Wu & Thomson, 2001). Thus, ignoring family\nprocesses when studying the relationship between family\nenvironment and premarital intercourse may result in mis-\nleading conclusions. Furthermore, previous studies in SSA\ntypically relied on cross-sectional data and used theories that\nare not family-centered. Obviously, findings from those\nstudies are informative; however, they must be interpreted\nwith caution, in part because the context of first sex may\nhave changed in the meantime. Indeed, those studies\nexplained past events (e.g., sexual initiation) with current\nindividual, familial, and community characteristics. This\narticle contributes to existing literature in SSA by drawing\non a family-centered theoretical perspective and family ante-\ncedents to document the occurrence of premarital\nintercourse.

Findings indicated that the effects of fam-\nily environment (including family structures and parent\u00ad\nchild interactions) and parental marital status varied during\nchildhood and adolescence. In contrast, the effects of family\ninstability and changes were substantial regardless of the\ntiming of its occurrence.\nConceptual Framework\nPrevious research has focused on three main explanations of\nthe associations between family structures and sexual initia-\ntion, including early socialization, parental control/supervi-\nsion during adolescence, and family instability and changes.\nEach explanation explores different aspects of family influ-\nences on youth sexual behavior; however, they are not mutu-\nally exclusive. In fact, socialization may affect parental\ncontrol/supervision under certain circumstances. Likewise,\nfamily turbulences may impair socialization processes and\nparental control. We argue that those assumptions are rele-\nvant in SSA but are not yet fully examined. Likewise, we\nextend the literature from developed countries to account for\nspecific family traits in SSA. Polygyny is the most distin-\nguishing characteristic of African family structures\n(Kayongo-Male & Onyango, 1984); it is still prevalent\n(Westoff, 2003) and a normative marital system (van de\nWalle, 2006). As such, findings from studies on the relation-\nship between family environment and sexual debut that\noverlooked the role of polygyny may be inconclusive.\nFinally, we consider the intervening roles of parent\u00adchild\ninteractions to understand how family structures affect pre-\nmarital intercourse.\nSocialization\nThe theory of socialization emphasizes the role of parents as\nthe most influential socializing agents during early child-\nhood. For sociologists and child development theorists,\nappropriate behaviors are the core of child socialization.\nNorms and family values and parenting models are funda-\nmental in this theory holding that married two-parent homes\nare protective (Albrecht & Teachman, 2004; Wu & Thomson,\n2001). Researchers argued that youth from unmarried par-\nents often witness their parents' dating or cohabiting rela-\ntionships while learning to deal with their own romantic\nrelationships (Pearson, Muller, & Frisco, 2006). Hence, they\nwere more likely to experience early sexual initiation or\nreported higher rates of sexual activity. Robust empirical\nevidence is largely from developed countries (Albrecht &\nFew studies have documented the effects of family struc-\ntures on sexual behavior while taking into account the type\n(polygynous vs. monogamous) of union (Amoran, Onadeko,\nfrom polygynous families have higher rates of early sexual\ndebut. Nonetheless, the extent to which socializing mecha-\nnisms differ between monogamous and polygynous families\nremains unclear. The effects of polygyny on youth sexual\nbehavior may operate through the economic deprivation of\nfamily members. Polygynous families have greater needs\ndue to the larger number of people than monogamous fami-\nlies and consequently have fewer material and financial\nresources to support their children (Kuate Defo, 2004;\nMeekers & Calv\u00e8s, 1997). Economic hardship may explain\nwhy youth from polygynous families lack basic needs such\nas food, housing, or schooling fees, and therefore engage in\npremarital intercourse (Amoran et al., 2005; Slap et al.,\n2003). Economic deprivation that is higher among one-par-\nent families may also explain higher rates of early sexual\ndebut for youth raised in those families. Socialization theory\nalso emphasizes the negative effects of the father's absence\nduring childhood (East, Jackson, & O'Brien, 2006). The key\npoint is that role-model fathers provide help children to\ndevelop a healthy gender identity, appropriate sex-typed\nbehaviors, and a positive sexual self-image (Albrecht &\nTeachman, 2004). A lack of father's presence can translate\ninto adverse outcomes such as premarital intercourse\nIncreasingly, researchers included measures of parental\ninvolvement in their analyses of the effects of family struc-\nture. The quality of parent\u00adchild relationships and parent\u00ad\nchildcommunicationarecentraltosocialization.Parent\u00adchild\nrelationships encompass closeness and connectedness, the\ntype and level of support and security that parents provide to\ninternalization of parental values (strictness vs. permissive-\nness) about sexual attitudes and behaviors may be higher in\nsupportive two-parent families. Hence, youth who benefit\nfrom those family contexts likely refrain from early sexual\ninitiation. Although previous research from developed coun-\ntries reported mixed results, positive parent\u00adchild relation-\nships within two-parent families are often associated with\nlower rates of premarital intercourse (Regnerus & Luchies,\nCommunication is the main channel for parents to trans-\nmit knowledge and attitudes about sexuality. Good, open,\nand higher levels of parent\u00adchild communication are often\nassociated with lower rates of premarital intercourse (Dittus\n& Jaccard, 2000). In SSA, studies on the content, time, and\nfrequency of parent\u00adchild communication reported that par-\nents usually feel uncomfortable to talk about sex topics\n(Kouinche & Tagne, 1998). Empirically, associations\nbetween parent\u00adchild communication and premarital inter-\ncourse in SSA are inconclusive. Some researchers found a\nweak relationship (Karim et al., 2003; Kumi-Kyereme et al.,\nThe tempo of discussions about sex topics has sparked much\nTsala Dimbuene and Kuate Defo 3\ndebate: \"Should parents talk to children before or after they\nhave engaged in sexual activity?\" One might argue that talk-\ning to children before they engaged in sexual relationships\ncould prevent adverse reproductive health (RH) outcomes.\nThis issue is not well documented in SSA. Likely, the cross-\nsectional nature of the data has limited previous research to\ncapture the time order of parent\u00adchild communication and\nsexual initiation. In this article, we consider parent\u00adchild\ncommunication prior to sexual debut.\nSocial Control\nAccording to the social control theory, the so-called \"paren-\ntal supervision\" or \"monitoring during adolescence,\" young\npeople are naturally inclined toward deviance, but bonds to\nconventional society cause most individuals to refrain from\nsuch behaviors (Crockett, Bingham, Chopak, & Vicary,\n1996). Researchers argued that the probability of adoles-\ncents to engage in premarital intercourse is in large part due\nto the levels of parental supervision (DiClemente et al.,\n2003). The underlying assumption is that youth from two-\nparent families are more likely to report higher levels of\nparental supervision/monitoring than neither- or one-parent\nfamilies, thus providing youth with fewer opportunities to\nengaging in sexual activities (Albrecht & Teachman, 2004;\nBiddlecom, Awusabo-Asare, & Bankole, 2009; Kumi-\nDuring adolescence, the role of a second caregiver1\n(namely, the father) becomes particularly important when the\nmother's authority begins to compete with extrafamilial fac-\ntors, including peer influences and community opportunities.\nIn Western contexts, supervision is primarily a parental task;\nthe absence of one parent can be detrimental for youth. Where\npolygyny is rife like in African cultures, parental supervision\ncan be challenging even for two-parent families. Indeed, par-\nents like polygynous fathers may lack time to oversee the\nelevated number of children and homes. Therefore, only\nmothers are the primary supervisor similar to single-parent\nhouseholds in the Western context. Hence, a lack of authority\nand clear rules from mothers about sexual matters can be det-\nrimental for youth in polygynous and one-parent households.\nCompared with Western contexts, guidance and supervision\nof youth in SSA is a social and collective task in which par-\nents play the most important role (Verhoef, 2005). Finally,\nAfrican societies have different expectations for girls and\nboys about sexuality. Indeed, premarital sexuality is prohib-\nited for females but it is sometimes encouraged or not sanc-\ntioned for boys (Kuate Defo, 1998). Thus, the effects of\nparental control likely vary by gender and age.\nFamily Instability and Changes\nFrom the perspective of family instability and changes, early\nsexual initiation among youth is a function of family insta-\nbility and changes occurring after a divorce, remarriage, or\nparental death (Albrecht & Teachman, 2004; Cavanagh &\ndeveloped countries led researchers to focus primarily on the\nnegative effects of marital disruption on sexual onset\n(Amato, 1987). Single-parent households in SSA generally\nresulted from parental death. Parental death is a strong, trau-\nmatic, and stressful event that was found to correlate with\nnegative outcomes such as school dropouts (Case, Paxson,\nrisky sexual behavior (Thurman et al., 2006).\nFinally, some researchers conjectured that the three afore-\nmentioned perspectives can be viewed as complementary\nrather than competing (Wu & Thomson, 2001). For instance,\ndemographic events like divorce or parental death are also\nassociated with family instability and changes (Bicego,\nchanges lead to many stressful events for parents and chil-\ndren, and therefore may affect parent\u00adchild bonds. In fact,\nfrequent changes within family environment may decrease\nthe effectiveness of social control through a decrease of\nnumberandtypesofparentspresentinthehome.Emotionally,\npsychologically, and economically, new family environ-\nments require new adaptation. Hence, they can impede\nsocialization processes. Social control and socialization pro-\ncesses may be linked in many ways (Wu & Thomson, 2001).\nStrong social networks among parents in a neighborhood\nmay provide youth with great opportunities for a collective\nsocialization. For instance, most youth in Bandjoun know\nthat premarital intercourse is prohibited (Kouinche & Tagne,\n1998). Likewise, the quality of parent\u00adchild relationships\nleads to more effective control of children because when par-\nents provide a stable and warmth environment, children\nlikely internalize familial values and attitudes about sexual-\nity. In Bandjoun, parent\u00adchild relationships vary depending\non parents' gender. Fathers' relationships, especially for\ndaughters, are mostly vertical ones, whereas mother\u00adchild\nrelationships are rather horizontal and characterized by com-\npanionship, confidentiality, and flexibility with respect to the\nacceptance or rejection of normative behaviors (Ngom et al.,\n2003). In this context, fathers provide more disciplinary\nenvironments even though mothers may exercise more effec-\ntive control over children.\nHypotheses\nThe literature presented above leads to a number of relevant\nhypotheses in SSA. Overall, young people from two-parent\nmonogamous families will experience premarital sexual\nintercourse at a later age compared with those who resided\nin other types of families. From the socialization perspec-\ntive, higher quality of parent\u00adchild relationships and higher\nlevels of parent\u00adchild communication about sexuality topics\nare expected to correlate with lower rates of premarital inter-\ncourse. From the social control perspective, it is expected\nthat higher levels of parental supervision lead to a later\n4 SAGE Open\nsexual initiation. From the instability and change perspec-\ntive, we expect that youth who experienced family changes\nand/or parental death likely report premarital intercourse.\nSpecifically, socialization and social control hypotheses are\ntested here using family antecedents at childhood and ado-\nlescence, respectively. Instability and family change hypoth-\neses are tested with parental survival and an indicator of\nfamily structure change between childhood and adolescence.\nThe Study Setting\nCameroon is often referred to as a miniature Africa due to its\ngeographic, climatic, and ethnic diversity (more than 200\nethnic groups). There are three main ethnic groups in the\ncountry, two in the predominantly Christian southern part of\nthe country, and the other in the northern part. The Bamil\u00e9k\u00e9\nis the largest ethnic group in the country. The Bamil\u00e9k\u00e9 peo-\nple are a migration population which has contributed through\nits highest fertility nationally to the peopling of all regions of\nCameroon from West highlands region of their origin. The\nFang-B\u00e9ti is the second largest ethnic group; they live in the\nforested region in the Center, South, and Eastern regions. The\nFulani are about one third of the population and live in the\nNorthern part of the country. They are mostly Muslims and\nform a very homogeneous group in terms of religion and\nlifestyles. In contrast, our study setting (Bandjoun) is cultur-\nally homogeneous because people are mainly the Bamil\u00e9k\u00e9.\nPrevious studies reported that the Bamil\u00e9k\u00e9 have plenty of\nrules disapproving sexual immorality, including incest, adul-\ntery, and fornication (Bouwa, 2006). Polygyny is not uncom-\nmon among the Bamil\u00e9k\u00e9. As such, it is almost inconceivable\nfor a man to divorce his wife (or wives) for any motive.\nHence, the divorce rates are lower in this region compared\nwith national levels and trends (Kuate Defo, 1998).\nConsequently, extended families appear to be the predomi-\nnant pattern in Bandjoun; at the same time, nuclear families\nremain under the influences of extended families.\nIn cultures where the rules about sexual activity are strict,\nit is common that information about sexuality topics is\npassed on through cultural initiation rites precluding biologi-\ncal parents. In Bandjoun traditional societies, sexuality was\ntaught within homogeneous sex-specific groups organized to\nprepare youth for household chores and parental/societal\nresponsibilities. Parents were not the primary source of sex-\nual education. Nowadays, the increasing urbanization in the\ncountry brought many changes regarding initiation rites.\nThere is still evidence that initiation rites about sexuality do\nexist in Cameroon; however, they are less common. In spite\nof the changes occurring in traditional cultures, sexuality\nremains a taboo topic in Bandjoun. Consequently, the\nBamil\u00e9k\u00e9 feel discomfort and shame when talking about\nsexuality with children. Such parent\u00adchild interactions may\nimpede the potential for parents to act as sexual educators\nand help youth to overcome negative outcomes associated\nwith premarital intercourse.\nData and Method\nData were drawn from a random and representative sample\nals aged 10 years and older in the 75 localities forming the\nprefecture of Bandjoun (Kuate Defo, 2005). Each locality\nused probability samples in which all households have a\nnonzero chance of inclusion. When selected, all individuals\naged 10 years and more in the household were interviewed.\nA total of 4,950 respondents of both sexes were interviewed\nusing standard questionnaires. The present study used a sub-\nsample of 2,166 adolescents and young adults of both sexes,\ninformation on family histories at ages 6 and 12 representing\ntwo important transitions for youth in Cameroon. The pri-\nmary school starts at age 6. Age 12 represents the emerging\nadolescence and the transition from elementary to high\nschool. Methodologically, choosing these two markers lim-\nited recall biases inherent in retrospective surveys.\nMeasures\nDependentVariable\nTiming of premarital intercourse. The validity of respon-\ndents' self-reported age at first sex or the waiting time to\npremarital intercourse is debatable. Previous studies reported\nthat measurement of age at premarital intercourse is prob-\nlematic, especially for older youth (Mensch et al., 2006). A\nvast literature questioned the consistency and reliability of\nself-reported age at first sex in surveys from developing\ncountries (Hewett, Mensch, & Erulkar, 2004; Zaba et al.,\n2004). For instance, age at first sex varied with interview\nmodes. Likewise, underreporting is widespread among girls\n(Mensch et al., 2006). In SSA, the social context can under-\nmine the accuracy of self-reported age at first sex: For boys,\nhaving sex represents prestige among peers. In contrast, it is\nshameful for females to be sexually active because virginity\nis still valued.\nIn this article, age at premarital sex3 is measured by the\nrespondents' self-reported age at first sex with a partner of\nopposite gender (recorded in years). From an event history\nperspective, the occurrence of premarital intercourse at each\nage is defined as a single event and the nonoccurrence of first\nsexual initiation is defined as censoring in the last interval\n(e.g., young people who are not sexually experienced at the\ntime of interview but may experience transition to sexual ini-\ntiation in the future). In practice, the probability of sexual\ndebut in each interval of time (a year) is estimated using a\nbinary variable taking the values 1 if the premarital inter-\ncourse has occurred and 0 otherwise. Respondents were\nasked the questions, \"Have you ever had sexual intercourse?\"\nIf so, \"How old were you when you had first sexual inter-\ncourse?\" It was also possible to determine whether first sex-\nual intercourse occurred within or before marriage using the\nfollowing additional information about age at marriage:\nTsala Dimbuene and Kuate Defo 5\n\"Have you ever been married?\" and \"How old were you\nwhen you first got married?\"\nIndependentVariables\nFamily structure. Defining and/or measuring family struc-\nture is also a subject of debate. The resulting ambiguity in\nterminology and measurement has nurtured confusions about\nits effects on youth's sexual behaviors. Data about family\nstructure in SSA often used the variable/question \"Relation-\nship to household head\" collected in censuses and surveys.\nThis variable provides limited information to determine\nparental coresidence. To overcome these shortcomings,\nDemographic and Health Surveys (DHS) program intro-\nduced additional questions to capture whether the child lives\nin the same household with his or her biological parents. For-\ntunately, detailed information was available in CFHS-2002\nabout family members present in the household at each time.\nFamily structures here emphasize coresidence with biologi-\ncal parents. This approach differs from other aspects of fam-\nily structure such as household size, number of siblings, or\nthe number of generations within the household. The major\nrationale is that these aspects are more difficult to capture\ndue to recall biases. Family configurations at ages 6 and 12\nmay also be subject of recall problems; however, changes in\nfamily structure are not very common in semiurban areas in\nCameroon.\nA total of 10 dichotomous questions were asked to cap-\nture family structures at a given age t (ages 6 and 12) about\nmembers of a typical African family: \"With whom did you\nlive at [age t]?\" Responses included members of nuclear\nfamily (father, mother, brother/sister), extended family\n(cousins, uncle/aunt, grandfather/grandmother), nonrelatives\n(friend, playmate), and other situations (living in institution\nor alone). Only a few cases felt in items such as \"friend,\nplaymate, in institution, and alone.\" Therefore, they were\nexcluded. Six items were used to build five mutually exclu-\nsive categories of family structures: nuclear one-parent,\nextended one-parent, nuclear two-parent, extended two-par-\nent, and other relatives. This last category included brothers/\nsisters, uncles/aunts, and grandparents. Ideally, this group\nshould be divided into subgroups; however, analyses with\nsubgroups led to statistically unstable models. For similar\nreasons, one-parent families (mother-only and father-only)\nwere combined.\nParental marital status. Respondents were asked the fol-\nlowing question: \"What was the marital status of parents/\nguardians at age t?\" Responses included single, married\nmonogamous, cohabiting, married polygynous, separated,\ndivorced, and widowed. A new variable was created that\ndistinguishes young people who lived in monogamous and\npolygynous families, and other (single, separated/divorced,\nand widowed).\nFamily processes. Family processes (e.g., quality of par-\nent\u00adchild relationships, parent\u00adchild communication, and\nparental control) are complex and multidimensional con-\ncepts. They are important components of effective family\nenvironment; however, the context-specific instruments to\ncapture parent\u00adchild interactions are lacking in SSA. Thus,\nfindings should be interpreted with caution. For instance,\nparent\u00adchild relationships and parental control are measured\nwith a single item response. Although parent\u00adchild commu-\nnication about sex topics was measured using five yes/no\nitems, a Likert-type scale could provide a wider range of val-\nues between respondents. Family processes identified as\nmediators of the effects of family structures on premarital\nintercourse are described below.\nQuality of parent\u00adchild relationships at age t was cap-\ntured through the following question: \"How did you see the\nquality of your relationships with your parents/guardians at\nage t?\" Reponses ranged from 1 = very good to 5 = difficult/\nbad. They were reversely recorded in the analyses.\nParent\u00adchild communication was measured with five yes/\nno questions: \"Did you ever have conversations with your\nparents/guardians about puberty, sexual education, STIs and\nHIV/AIDS, pregnancies, and alcohols or drugs at age t?\"\nItems were summed; the scores ranged from 0 to 5, higher\nscores indicating higher levels of parent\u00adchild communica-\ntion (Cronbach's  = .86).\nParental control. This study used direct measures of paren-\ntal supervision at age t, indicating whether parents were\naware of youth whereabouts: \"Were your parents or guard-\nians controlling your leisure at age t?\" Responses ranged\nfrom 1 = a lot to 5 = not at all. Responses were reversed to\nobtain a gradient; higher scores correspond to higher levels\nof parental control.\nParental survival. The question \"What was the main reason\nwhy you weren't living with your biological parents at age\nt?\" measured parents' survival status. Responses included\nthe following: mother and father died, father died, mother\ndied, school, and other. This variable was coded 1 if at least\none parent deceased and 0 otherwise.\nEconomic deprivation is proxied with three variables.\nFirst, \"What was the lighting type that you were using in the\nhome at age t?\" Responses were electricity, lamp, candle,\nand other. This variable was coded 1 if the lighting mode\nwas electricity and 0 otherwise. Second, the presence of\nradio/television at home, \"Did you have a radio or a televi-\nsion at home at age t?\" coded 1 = yes and 0 = otherwise.\nThird, the educational attainment of parents/guardians was\nmeasured by the following question: \"What was the educa-\ntion level of your responsible at age t?\" Responses were\nrecorded 0 = none, 1 = primary, and 2 = high school or\nuniversity. These variables represent different aspects of\nsocioeconomic status (SES). Hence, they are introduced\nseparately in the estimations.\nOther variables associated with sexual onset include age\n(in years), gender (male vs. female), education (years com-\npleted), and place of residence (rural vs. urban).\n6 SAGE Open\nMethod\nBivariate and multivariate analyses were performed.\nKaplan\u00adMeier life tables were used to determine the median\nage at premarital intercourse. For multivariate analyses,\ndiscrete-time hazard models were used because the timing of\npremarital intercourse can be viewed as an age-dependent\nprocess. Using the person-age observation (in a person-year\nfile) as the unit of analysis, multivariate discrete-time mod-\nels with a logit transformation (Allison, 1984) were fitted to\ncapture the effects of key independent variables on the prob-\nability of premarital intercourse. The log odds of premarital\nintercourse can be parameterized with a general formulation\nas follows:\nLog ( p )= \n(ti\n)\n+  \u00d7 FS\n(ti\n)\n+  \u00d7 MS\n(ti\n)\n+  \u00d7 X\n(ti\n)\n+  \u00d7 Z,\nwhere p represents the risk of premarital intercourse at age t\ngiven that the individual i has not yet experienced a first sex\nbefore age t,  designs the effect of family structure (FS), \nis the effect of parental marital status (MS),  is a vector of\nparameters corresponding to covariates X that mediate the\neffects of family structure and parental marital status in each\nhypothesis,  is a vector of parameters of other covariates Z,\nand  represents the specific effect of being in a given age\ninterval.\nThe logit coefficients represent the effects that being in\nthe estimated variable category has on the odds of having a\npremarital intercourse relative to remaining virgin. This ana-\nlytic strategy is appropriate because the events occurred in\ndiscrete time intervals, and premarital intercourse was mea-\nsured in completed years. Specifically, Models 1 to 4 (Tables\n2 and 3) are performed to test the socialization and social\ncontrol hypotheses, respectively. Finally, parental survival\nand family changes were used to test instability and change\nhypotheses (Table 4). The indicator of family change is only\nincluded in models using variables at age 12.\nAnother methodological issue relies on the nature of data:\nAll individuals aged 10 years and above in the household\nwere interviewed in CFHS-2002; therefore, observations\nwere not independent. They are correlated because they\nshare the same characteristics within the household. It is\ntherefore necessary to account for this correlation so as to\nderive unbiased estimates of standard errors, p values, and\nconfidence intervals. The analyses controlled for the correla-\ntion of observations on youth for the same household by\nusing the appropriate options in STATA software (Cleves,\nwhen the cluster option is specified, it then corrects for the\nfact that youth within a household are not independent obser-\nvations. This yields robust standard errors, those obtained\nvia the Huber\u00adWhite sandwich estimator of variance.\nMoreover, should there exist intrahousehold correlation, the\nrobust standard errors are better indicators of the\nsample-to-sample variability of the parameter estimates and\ntherefore produce more accurate tests of the effects of the\nResults\nDescriptive Analysis\nTable 1 provides descriptive statistics of the sample for fam-\nily structure, parental marital status, family processes, and\ndemographic characteristics, and the median age at first\nsexual intercourse for categorical independent variables.\nOverall, 35% of young people had premarital intercourse.\nThe median age at premarital sex is 17.7 years. These figures\ndo not differ significantly from the national trends.According\nto the Cameroon Demographic and Health Survey (CDHS)-\nand 18 years. Findings in Table 1 also indicate that youth\nliving in two-parent families at age 12 significantly reported\nthe oldest age at first sexual intercourse (17.8 years), and\nthose who resided in extended one-parent families the\nyoungest (16.9 years). Likewise, youth in monogamous\nfamilies reported the oldest age at premarital intercourse\nyears) or other homes (17.3 years). Age at premarital inter-\ncourse does not vary as much by parental education (17.5-\n17.9 years). Youth who lived in homes with a radio/\ntelevision significantly reported younger age at first sex\n(17.5 vs. 18.3 years). Conversely, youth in electrified houses\nyears). There were significant differences in the age at pre-\nmarital intercourse with respect to parental survival: Orphans\nreported significantly younger age at sexual onset (17.5\nyears) than nonorphans (17.8 years). Change in family struc-\nture between ages 6 and 12 also shows significant differ-\nences. Youth who experienced family changes reported early\nage at premarital sex compared with sedentary respondents\n(16.8 vs. 17.6 years). In this sample, no gender differences\nwere observed about the age at premarital intercourse (17.9\nTable 1 also displays descriptive statistics of the sample.\nThe distribution of family structures at ages 6 and 12 indi-\ncates that one-parent families were marginal.

Although one might expect variations in terms of\nthe quality of parent\u00adchild relationships and parental control\nas children grew, results indicated only small changes\nbetween ages 6 and 12. Although a modest increase was\nobserved between ages 6 and 12, the levels of parent\u00adchild\ncommunication were expectedly low. Demographic charac-\nteristics show that the sample consisted of 57% of females,\nwith an average age of 17.3 years. Unlike African settings,\nnearly all respondents (99.9%) were enrolled in school at\nsome time of their life. As a result, the average years of edu-\ncation was high (M = 8.3, SD = 2.3). Urban residents repre-\nResults From the Multivariate Hazard Models\nMultivariate results are structured to follow our conceptual\nframework. To achieve these goals, Tables 2 and 3 present\nthe estimated coefficients of discrete-time logit models\nusing family background at ages 6 and 12 to test the social-\nization and social control hypotheses. Models 1 and 3 in\nTables 2 and 3 are the baselines for the two key independent\nvariables, namely, family structures and parental marital\nstatus. These models are extended to include family pro-\ncesses and control for demographic characteristics such as\ngender and age cohorts. Generally speaking, if we consider\nfindings from Tables 2 and 3, the odds of having premarital\nsex among youth aged 12 to 29 years at the time of the sur-\nvey increased monotonically with the length of exposure to\npremarital intercourse. Likewise, older youth (20-29 years)\nwere 1.45 times more likely to have premarital sex com-\nSocialization Hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, family\nstructure and processes during childhood are influential to\npremarital sex. Findings are summarized in Table 2.\nAlthough findings went in the expected direction, family\nstructures at age 6 showed only marginal effects on premari-\ntal sex (Model 1). Compared with two-parent families, living\nwith other relatives during childhood increased significantly\nby 36% the odds of having premarital sex. This effect\ndeclined slightly when all other variables were introduced in\nthe estimations (Model 2) but remained statistically signifi-\ncant at p < 5%. Of interest in this article are family processes\nrelated to socialization, including the quality of parent\u00adchild\nrelationships and parent\u00adchild communication at age 6.\nYouth who reported higher levels of the quality of parent\u00ad\nchild relationships were less likely to have premarital sex. In\nfact, an increase in the quality of parent\u00adchild relationships\ndecreased by 30% the odds of having premarital sex. Parent\u00ad\nchild communication about sexuality was not associated\nwith the risk of premarital intercourse, in part because of the\nlow levels of parent\u00adchild communication observed during\nchildhood. The article also considered three socioeconomic\nvariables, including parental education and two household\nassets (radio/television and electricity at home as the lighting\nmode at age 6). Overall, the socioeconomic variables are sig-\nnificantly associated with the risk of premarital sex. Youth\nfrom better-educated parents were significantly 1.223 times\nmore likely to report premarital sex. Likely, youth from\nhouseholds with a radio/television at age 6 were marginally\n1.195 times more likely to report early sexual debut.\nConsidering other family processes, especially parental con-\ntrol, findings show that youth who reported higher levels of\nparental control were less likely to have ever had premarital\nsex. Higher levels of parental control decreased by 34% the\nodds of having premarital sex.\nTurning to parental marital status at age 6 (Model 3, Table\n2), findings indicate youth from monogamous families at age\n6 were less likely to have premarital sex (odds ratio [OR] =\n0.682, p < 5%) whereas those living with other relatives\nwere significantly more likely to have premarital sex (OR =\n1.520, p < 1%) compared with those from polygynous fami-\nlies. After controlling for all other variables, these effects\nremained statistically significant (Model 4). Family social-\nization processes showed similar effects than those observed\nwhen family structure was the key independent variable.\nIndeed, the quality of parent\u00adchild relationships was signifi-\ncantly associated with lower rates of premarital sex (OR =\n0.64, p < 5%). Having a radio/television at home at age 6\nincreased marginally the odds of premarital sex. Finally,\nhigher levels of parental control were significantly associ-\nated with lower odds of premarital sex (OR = 0.624, p < 5%).\nSocial Control Hypothesis. This hypothesis emphasizes the\nfamily environment during adolescence measured by the\ntypes and number of parents at age 12. Results are reported\nin Table 3. From Model 1, findings indicate that living with\nother relatives significantly increased the risks of premarital\nintercourse (OR = 1.504, p < 1%). Other family structures\n(nuclear one-parent and extended two-parent families) also\nshowed marginal effects on premarital intercourse (ORs =\neffects declined slightly when family processes and demo-\ngraphic characteristics are included (Model 2) but they\nremained statistically significant.\nConsidering the effects of family processes in Model 2,\nfindings show that the quality of parent\u00adchild relationships\nwas significantly associated with lower rates of premarital\nsex (OR = 0.723, p < 5%). Parent\u00adchild communication at\nage 12 increased significantly the odds of premarital sex (OR\n= 1.315, p < 5%). Two variables of household SES (e.g.,\nparental education and having a radio/television at home at\nage 12) increased significantly the risk of premarital sex. In\nfact, youth from better-educated parents and households\nhaving a radio/television at home at age 12 were signifi-\ncantly more likely to report premarital intercourse (OR =\nTable 3.

This article is also interested in the parental con-\ntrol as a mechanism to oversee children to limit their oppor-\ntunities to initiate sexual debut. From Model 2, findings\nshow that parental control is significantly associated with\nlower rates of premarital sex (OR = 0.841, p < 5%).\nCompared with polygynous families (Model 3 in Table\n3), youth from monogamous families are significantly less\nlikely to report premarital intercourse (OR = 0.723, p < 5%)\nwhereas those who resided with other relatives are signifi-\ncantly more likely to initiate premarital sex (OR = 1.315, p <\n5%). When all variables are included in the estimations\n(Model 4), the effects diminished but showed modest media-\ntion. For instance, the effects of monogamous families\nnearly 10%. Family processes showed similar effects to\nthose observed in Model 2.\nInstability and Change in Family Structure Hypothesis. The key\nargument of this hypothesis is that the number of changes in\nfamily structures following divorce or remarriage and parental\ndeath can accelerate the entry into sexual initiation. Two mod-\nels were performed for each independent variable (e.g., paren-\ntal survival at age 6 or 12 and change in family structures).\nBaseline models (results not shown) are extended to control\nfor family processes during childhood or adolescence.\nFrom Model 1 in Table 4, orphanhood that occurred dur-\ning childhood is modestly associated with the odds of pre-\ndeath is theoretically a stressful event for children, findings\nshowed that losing parents during childhood has only weak\neffects on premarital intercourse. Stated differently, an early\nparental death leaves enough time to youth to adapt within\nthe new family environment, thus limiting its deleterious\neffects. Conversely, parental death during adolescence is\nmore influential (Model 2 in Table 4); it increased signifi-\ncantly by 22% the risks of premarital intercourse (OR =\n1.221, p < 5%). Finally, changes in family structures between\nages 6 and 12 significantly affect the timing of sexual initia-\ntion. Youth who moved at least once are more likely to report\npremarital intercourse (OR = 1.363, p < 1%). When parental\ndeath and changes in family structures are all included in the\nestimations and after controlling for other variables (Model\n4), the two variables still have significant effects on the rates\nof premarital intercourse (OR = 1.287, p < 5% and OR =\nDiscussion and Conclusion\nThis study has examined the effects of family environment\non the timing of premarital intercourse in Bandjoun (West\nCameroon). Although the article replicated findings about\nthe centrality of the family environment, the primary interest\nwas to further our understanding on the nature of family\ninfluences on youth sexual behavior in SSA. By using fam-\nily background prior to sexual initiation and a family-cen-\ntered perspective, this article made theoretical,\nmethodological, and empirical contributions in African\ncontexts. On a theoretical point, this article suggests that\nspecific family configurations such as polygyny in SSA need\nto be incorporated to account for cross-country differences\nof the effects of family structures on sexual initiation.\nMethodologically, not only did the article use appropriate\nmethods to highlight the effects of family environment but\nalso evidenced how prior family experiences affect the tim-\ning of premarital intercourse and how these effects are par-\ntially explained by the levels of parent\u00adchild interactions.\nSpecifically, the article revealed the changing nature and\nstrength of the effects of family environment early in life on\nsubsequent sexual behavior.\nFrom a socialization viewpoint, researchers argued that,\nunder normal circumstances, nuclear two-parent families\nduring childhood provide warmth, strong emotional and psy-\nchological support (Pearson et al., 2006), which thereafter\nleads to positive sociopsychological adjustment and appro-\npriate sexual behaviors. Findings indicated marginal effects\nof childhood family structures. Instead, we found strong and\nsignificant protective effects of the quality of parent\u00adchild\nrelationships. Because parent\u00adchild relationships are youth\nself-reported perceptions, data collected from parents and\nyouth may be more useful for policy makers and practitio-\nners working on RH interventions.\nParent\u00adchild communication, another key factor for early\nsocialization, was not associated with premarital intercourse\nduring childhood. This result is not fortuitous; descriptive\nTable 4.

In Models 1 and 2, parental survival\nat ages 6 and 12 are used as key independent variables, respectively.\nHence, family characteristics at ages 6 and 12 are controlled for, respec-\ntively. In Model 3, change in family structure (referred to as whether the\nfamily structure changed between ages 6 and 12) is the key independent\nvariable. In Model 4, both parental survival at age 12 and change in family\nstructure are utilized as key independent variables, controlling for family\ncharacteristics at age 12.\nresults showed low levels of parent\u00adchild communication.\nPossibly parents predicate that children are not ready to learn\nabout sexuality. Although youth identified family members\nas an important source of information about sexuality\n(Meekers & Ahmed, 2000), parents usually adopt fear tactics\nand warning messages about sexuality when talking to youth.\nSuch messages inadequately explain why and how youth can\nmanage sexual matters and sex-related adverse outcomes.\nBecause studies on the protective effects of family envi-\nronment in SSA are still rare, no definitive conclusions are\ndrawn here. Rather these findings can serve as the bench-\nmark for more in-depth research on family influences.\nIndeed, families per se are not protective or at risk. Greeff\nand Van Der Merwe (2004) identified additional criteria,\nwhich are not included in this study, to ensure family protec-\ntiveness (e.g., family cohesion, parental commitment, adapt-\nability, communication, spirituality, connectedness, time\ntogether, and efficacy).\nAnother intriguing finding was the positive effects of\nhousehold socioeconomic assets. Studies from developed\ncountries revealed the benefit of better-off homes. In con-\ntrast, findings in SSA are mixed. Studies have reported a\nnegative link between household wealth and sexual onset\n(Madise, Zulu, & Ciera, 2007) while others have found a\npositive relationship between SES and HIV prevalence in\nSSA(Djamba, 2003; Msisha, Kapiga, Earls, & Subramanian,\nited that girls from wealthier families likely receive lesser\npaternal attention. Men with more economic resources tend\nto invest searching for more female sexual mates while\ndevoting less time to children.\nWe suggest another explanation derived from youth social\nstatus and popularity. Higher parental SES provides youth\nwith higher social status and popularity among peers: they\nare well dressed, have more pocket money, and therefore\nthey are more attractive. As a result, they have more oppor-\ntunities for dating compared with their counterparts from\ndisadvantaged households. Because dating is generally\naccompanied with gifts and parties, ceteris paribus, youth\nfrom advantaged households are more likely to have money,\nto attend parties, and to make gifts. Taken together, this may\nincrease their risks of premarital intercourse. Likewise, girls\nfrom wealthier families can face more sexual pressure. In the\ncontext of poverty, family SES becomes an important selec-\ntion criterion because male youth expect gifts from females\nresiding in advantaged households. Conversely, female\nyouth from poor households are in needs and have nothing to\nshare. Therefore, at the same levels of beauty/attractiveness,\nfemale and male youth from wealthier families are favored.\nMonogamous families were associated with lower rates\nof sexual onset. A plausible explanation is that polygynous\nfamilies provide less appropriate environments for a positive\nyouth development that likely increases the risks of premari-\ntal intercourse. Data about family conflicts were not col-\nlected in this survey; however, previous research pointed to\nconflicts in polygynous families (Elbedour, Bart, & Hektner,\n2007). To augment our understanding of the effects of polyg-\nyny, we performed an ANOVA (results not shown). Youth\nfrom polygynous families significantly reported lower levels\nof quality of parent\u00adchild relationships and parent\u00adchild\ncommunication. Our findings are better conceptualized with\nthe quality of parent\u00adchild relationships. Poor quality of par-\nent\u00adchild relationships partly explains the higher rates of\npremarital intercourse in polygynous families.\nFrom a social control viewpoint, two main conclusions\nare drawn. First, youth from two-parent families signifi-\ncantly reported later age at premarital intercourse. These\nfindings are in line with previous research from developed\ndeveloping countries (Ngom et al., 2003). Second, youth\nwho resided in monogamous families at age 12 reported later\nage at premarital intercourse. In contrast, youth who lived\nwith other relatives were at higher risks of premarital inter-\ncourse. These findings stress the importance of biological\nparents regardless of the type of parental marital status.\nParental control is considered the main mechanism medi-\nating the effect of family structure on premarital intercourse.\nOn average, higher levels of parental control were signifi-\ncantly associated with lower risks of premarital intercourse,\nin line with previous research (DiClemente et al., 2003;\nKumi-Kyereme et al., 2007). To understand the extent to\nwhich parental control varies across family structures,\nANOVA was performed (results not shown). The levels of\nparental control were higher in monogamous families.\nAlthough our measures of parental control have some limita-\ntions and require more refinements, this article pointed to the\nimportance of equipping parents/guardians with appropriate\nparenting styles and strategies to improve parental guidance\nand control during adolescence.\nFrom a family instability and change viewpoint, paren-\ntal death and change in family structures were significantly\nassociated with premarital intercourse. We argue that par-\nent-like figures care about youth after parental death; how-\never, they cannot equally provide them with affection and\npsychological support as biological parents do. The links\nbetween orphanhood and premarital intercourse are proba-\nbly more complex. The economic and physical vulnerabil-\nity parental death brought may hasten sexual initiation\namong orphans. Finally, the positive effect of family\nchanges may be interpreted with changes in family pro-\ncesses. Youth who experienced changes in family struc-\ntures between ages 6 and 12 were likely exposed to different\nparenting styles that can influence early sexual debut. To\ntest this conjecture, family processes were regressed on\n\"changes in family structure\": Youth who experienced fam-\nily changes significantly reported low-quality levels of\nparent\u00adchild relationships and parental control. Therefore,\nthe modifications of family processes subsequent to\nchanges in family structures explain the significant effects\non premarital intercourse.\nTsala Dimbuene and Kuate Defo 13\nProgrammatically, family environment--defined as fam-\nily configurations and parent\u00adchild interactions--is an\nimportant factor that should not be ignored in activities tar-\ngeted at youth in SSA to delay sexual initiation and its\nadverse consequences, such as unwanted pregnancies and\nSTIs (World Health Organization [WHO], 2007). Lessons\nlearned from the past suggest that RH interventions carried\nout in SSA have inefficiently affected youth sexual behavior.\nIndeed, they have neglected or poorly integrated family\nenvironment in their design and implementation. Policy\nmakers and practitioners in RH need to work cooperatively\nwith parents and other adults in the home and community,\nirrespective of family structures, to enhance the quality of\nparent\u00adchild interactions that mediate the influences of fam-\nily structures on RH outcomes.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nNotes\n1. In many societies and sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) settings as\nwell, mothers are often the first caregiver of the children. The\nchanges that occurred in developed countries did not drasti-\ncally change the situation. Mothers still are the first caregiver\neven though fathers are more and more involved in household\nlife (e.g., chores, and child development and socialization). The\nincreasing share of female labor force participation explains at\nleast partly these changes: It substantially modified the division\nof labor in the household, at the same, increased the fathers'\ninvolvement in the child socialization. In African societies, the\nrole of fathers still is that of household's breadwinner. In this\ncase, mothers are often abandoned to care and fulfill house-\nhold's chores and child socialization. Therefore, the protective\neffect of two-parent in SSA may be very questionable.\n2. One might question the definition of youth utilized in this\narticle. Blum (2007) provided the reasons why defining the\nyouth's life span should be contextualized. In the setting\nunder study, young people remain under the control of other\nadults until marriage. In addition, including adolescents (12-\n19 years) and young adults (20-29 years) is justified because\nfamily structures at ages 6 and 12 still relevant for all youth,\neven those currently married.\n3. To determine whether first sex occurred before or within mar-\nriage (for youth currently married), we used available infor-\nmation about (a) age at first sex (in years) and (b) age at first\nmarriage. If first sex occurred within marriage for those cur-\nrently married, they were treated as censored and were coded\n0, which means that those individuals did not experience \"pre-\nmarital sexual activity.\" In other words, the act of marriage\nremoves individuals from the risk of premarital sex, and thus\nthey were censored and stopped to contributing person-years\nonce they marry, assuming they had not yet had sex.\nReferences\nAlbrecht, C., & Teachman, J.
