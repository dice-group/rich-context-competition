    "reduced_content": "William Weston\n# Springer Scienc +Business Media, LLC 2011\nThe core of the upper-middle class are college-educated,\nemployed, married couples with their children. Within this\nclass there are fractions that live somewhat different lives\nfrom one another. These families make a spectrum with\ncorporate managers at one end, intellectuals at the other,\nand professionals in the middle. Each of these groups has a\ndistinctive approach to work, which carries over into\ndifferences in how they lives their family lives.\nThe college class spreads across a spectrum of occupa-\ntions. It also produces a middle class layer and an upper-\nmiddle class layer. College-educated men and women tend\nto marry one another, and both are likely to have jobs.\nHusband and wife each approach their work in line with the\nnorms of each person's occupation. They also make a\ncommon family out of some combination of the class and\noccupational cultures that they join together.\nLayers and Fractions of the College Class\nThere is a solid line of studies of professionals that\ndistinguishes them from corporate managers and business\nexecutives. Eliot Freidson (1986) emphasizes the historical\nprocess by which professionals established a separate realm\nof power from merchants and manufacturers. Steven Brint\n(1994) follows Freidson, showing further how control of\nknowledge is key to what distinguishes professionals from\nother workers within various organizations and markets.\nAndrew Abbott (1988) argues that professions compete\nwith one another, as well as with business managers, to\nestablish their distinctive jurisdictions within a system of\nprofessions. Keith MacDonald (1995), in his overview of\nthe sociology of professions, puts the \"professionalizing\nproject\" at the core of what sociology knows about\nprofessions in relation to other occupations.\nPierre Bourdieu's work has been most fruitful in thinking\nabout the culture of different fractions of the same class stratum,\nas well as how the higher strata differ from the lower. In\nDistinction (1984) Bourdieu says that this high (\"dominant\")\nclass has more total capital than the classes below. Internally,\nthough, the various fractions differ in their mix of economic\ncapital (money) and cultural capital (knowledge or culture).\nThe \"dominant fraction of the dominant class,\" the monied\nend of this spectrum, consist of commercial and industrial\nemployers. The \"dominated fraction of the dominant class\" is\nexemplified by public-sector executives, engineers, private-\nsector executives below the top level, professions, secondary\nteachers, higher-education teachers, and artistic producers.\nMichele Lamont has made the most complex attempt to apply\nBourdieu's class fraction idea. In the monied fraction she\nlooks for the profit-related occupations in the private sector,\nboth among the salaried and the self-employed. In the cultured\nfraction she seeks cultural and social specialists within the\npublic, nonprofit, and private sectors, and people in what she\ncalls \"profit-related occupations\" in the public and non-profit\nversus monied class fractions in surveys of Yale and Wake\nForest alumni (Soares 2007 on Yale; unpublished data on\nWake Forest). He compared professionals and non-\nprofessionals among those in the top 10% of income in the\ntwo universities, then with a similarly constructed group in the\nNational Educational Longitudinal Survey.\nPrevious considerations of professions, or of the fractions of\nthe college-educated class, tend to compare just two categories,\nprofessionals and managers. Moreover, they tend to place the\ncollege educated in the middle and/or upper-middle class,\nwithout further considering the difference that might make.\nThe \"500 Families\" dataset lets us look a little more deeply\ninto these nuances of class layer and class fraction. We can\ncompare the middle class and upper-middle class. Moreover,\nwe can consider not just two ends of the spectrum of class\nW. Weston (*)\nCentre College,\ne-mail: beau.weston@centre.edu\ne\nfractions, but a third position in the middle. Using Bourdieu's\ncategories, managers and executives are clearly at the\neconomic capital pole of the capital-composition spectrum,\nwhile intellectuals are at the pole with more culture than\nmoney. Professionals fall in between. Professionals are those\nwho make a business out of applying knowledge.\nThe 500 Families dataset is an excellent tool to test whether\nmanagers and intellectuals form a spectrum, with professio-\nnals in the middle. Linda Waite and Barbara Schneider\ninterviewed 500 families with children from eight American\ntowns. The great majority were married, college-educated,\ndual-career couples with a kindergartener, a teenager, or both.\nThere were some single-mother families, and a few single-\nfather families, as well. This dataset is rich and nuanced\nenough to let us compare an upper-middle class layer with a\nmiddle class layer, with the few lower-middle class people in\nthe sample included for comparison. Each layer will be\ndivided into three class fractions, divided thus:\nThe occupations in each fraction, and the numbers of\nindividuals in each fraction, are as follows.\nUpper-Middle Class Fractions\nManagement: Executives and Managers (288\nindividuals)\nProfessions: Lawyers, Judges, Physicians, Archi-\nIntelligentsia: Writers, Artist, Professors, Scientists,\nand Social Scientists (95)\nMiddle Class Fractions\nBusiness Middle: Sales and Public Relations (65)\nParaprofessional: Nurses, Therapists, and Counselors\nKnowledge Middle: Sub-doctoral Scientists, Social\nScientists, Technicians, Teachers, Librarians, and\nLower-Middle Class Fractions:\nService, Clerical, and Manual Workers (116).\nThe gender breakdown of each of these categories is as\nfollows:\nThe overall study is skewed somewhat toward women,\nreflecting the difference between single mothers and single\nfathers in the sample. The Management and Intellectual\nfractions mirror the overall gender split. The Professions and\nBusiness Middle are significantly more male than the overall\ngroup of respondents, while the Knowledge Middle and\nLower Middle groups are skewed female. The Paraprofes-\nsional group of nurses, therapists, and counselors is over-\nwhelmingly female; there are only two men in this category.\nManagers, Professionals, Intellectuals\nThe 500 Families respondents were asked a series of questions\nabout why they work. Each question began \"How well does\neach of the statements below fit your views? I am currently\nworking in my main job for ...\". For each question they were\ngiven the options \"Not at all true, Somewhat true, True, and\nVery true.\" Only the percent answering \"Very true\" are\nreported below. I have bolded the top answer for each group.\nAll tables are significant at the .05 level.\nUpper\nmiddle class\nManagers Professionals Intellectuals\nMiddle Class Business\nMiddle\nParaprofessional Knowledge\nMiddle\nLower\nMiddle Class\nService, Clerical, and Manual\nMen Women\nBusiness Professions Intelligentsia Bus. middle Para-pro Know. middle Lower middle\nFor managers, the clear top motivation for work is \"the\nmoney.\" For intellectuals, by contrast, the overwhelming\ntop reason for work, chosen by more than half of the\nrespondents, is \"enjoy the task.\" Indeed, the intellectuals'\npreference for the sheer enjoyment of their work is the\nstrongest motive in the whole table.\nIntellectuals have a passion for the specific substance of\ntheir work; managers manage people who produce goods\nand services. Intellectuals get their identity from doing and\nbeing the task; managers get their identity from making a\nprofit or efficiency from any kind of task. Intellectuals get\nmore intrinsic motivation from the substance of the work;\nmanagers get less intrinsic motivation from the substance of\nthe work, so they get more extrinsic motivation from the\nrewards of the job. Business management and executive\nwork has to pay more than intellectual work does because\nthe work itself is less engaging.\nWhere, then, do we find the professionals? In between the\nmanagers and intellectuals, leaning toward the managers. The\nstrongest motive for professional work is \"the money,\" chosen\nas very true by 40.8%. A close second, though, is \"enjoy the\ntask,\" chosen by 39.5%. The core fact of the professional class\nculture is professionals turn knowledge into profit.\nThe middle class occupations are heavy on helping\nprofessions--half are nurses, therapists, counselors,\nteachers, librarians, or religious workers. Two thirds are\nmothers. It is not so surprising, therefore, that they put\n\"helping people\" as their top motivation. This is\nespecially true of the paraprofessionals, an overwhelm-\ningly female category. The knowledge middle fraction\nclearly are devoted to helping people (54.2% very true),\nbut choose enjoyment of their task a strong second\nThe one middle-class category that has more men than\nwomen, the business middle, have the strongest commit-\nment to money as their main motivation for work. The\nlower middle class works for the most utilitarian and\nextrinsic of reasons--the money, the benefits, and location\nclose to the kids. 70% of the people in this category are\nmothers, many of them single mothers.\nThe Class Culture of Families\nDo parents in different kinds of occupations approach\nfamily life differently?\nWe can start to see a difference when these working\nparents were asked \"Do you feel you have had a choice to\nstay home and not work for pay in order to raise your\nchildren?\"\nThe men overwhelmingly say no--85% or more among\nbusiness, business middle, lower middle, and professional\nmen. The men of the knowledge work column, though,\nstand out as different. 22.2% of knowledge middle men\nsaid yes to this question, and fully 30% of the intellectual\nmen answered yes as well. Clearly, fathers as a whole very\nstrongly feel they are supposed to work to support their\nfamilies. But the question is a little more flexible for men in\nthe knowledge jobs.\nWomen in this study are divided in half on this question\nof whether they had a choice to stay home with their\nchildren, with the professional women feeling most driven\nto work. Once again, though, the knowledge occupations\nstand out as more flexible when it comes to staying home\nwith the children. It is perhaps not surprising that 69.9% of\nthe women in the category that includes school teachers\nthink they have a choice to stay home with their kids--\ngreater flexibility is one of the reasons that such work has\nappealed strongly to women in the first place. It is more\nsurprising, though, that 3/4ths of the intellectual women\nalso feel they can stay home with their kids.\nThere is, of course, a difference between feeling that you\nhave a choice to stay home with your children, and actually\ndesiring to. 500 Families asked, therefore, this further\nquestion: \"If you were free to do any of the following,\nwould you prefer to...\n(N=842) Business Professions Intellectuals Bus. middle Para-pro Know. middle Lower middle\n(N=834) Business Professions Intellectuals Bus. middle Para-pro Know. middle Lower middle\nThis table is statistically significant. Interestingly, neither\ntable is significant controlling for sex. I think women like\npart-time jobs better in general. You can see that in the\nheavily female paraprofessionals. But staying home only\nseems attractive if it is for kids. Not working is not, in\nitself, an attractive option for the educated classes.\nThe working parents in this study are, not surprisingly,\ncommitted to the idea of working parents. Both men and\nwomen overwhelmingly (90%+) favor \"Employers being\nmore understanding of employees' dual roles as employees\nand parents.\" At the same time, they are not blind to the\npotential costs to kids of parents working. The upper-\nmiddle class men and women, who have invested the most\nin their careers, are the least likely to think there are major\ncosts to parents working. In response to the claim that\n\"Children who have parents working don't learn important\nvalues from parents,\" 14.2% of the lower middle class\nparents strongly disagree, about 23% of the middle class\nparents strongly disagree, but fully 31% of the upper\nmiddle class parents strongly disagree. Likewise, most\nparents in all classes allow that \"Children who have parents\nworking get into more trouble,\" but more than 40% of the\nupper middles disagree.\nThe intellectuals and knowledge middle class seem to have\nmore flexibility for family life. We saw this in whether they\nthought they could stay home with their children. We can also\nsee this difference when we compare who thinks about family\nat work, and who thinks about work at home. Few parents feel\nbad about leaving their kids when they go to work, but the\nbusiness middle women are most likely, at 27.2%, to report\nthat the often feel guilty. Likewise, more than a quarter of the\nbusiness women of the middle and upper-middle classes, as\nwell as the professional women, feel guilty that they don't\nspend more time with their families, whereas only about 9% of\nthe knowledge working women of both classes do. And\nwithin the middle class, only about half of the business and\nparaprofessional workers think their families are understand-\ning about the demands of their jobs, whereas nearly 3/4ths of\nthe knowledge workers report such understanding.\nThis is a fascinating pair of tables:\nAbout how often do you think about your children while\nat your job?\nWhen you are with your family, about how often do you\nthink about work?\nThe paraprofessionals are the most interesting column\nhere. That this bunch of moms is most likely to think of\ntheir families while at work is perhaps not so surprising.\nHowever, that none of them report thinking about work\nwhen with their families is surprising. Perhaps these jobs\nare appealing because you can leave the job at work.\nThe other standout fact from this table is how much the\nintellectuals think about work when they are at home. The more\npeople do knowledge-oriented work, the more their work is part\nof their round-the-clock identity. Cultural capital shapes who\nyou are; economic capital, by contrast, shapes what you have.\nHow Our Family Works\nMen and women in this study differ in the expected ways\non housework. The different occupations do not differ\nsystematically in shopping, cooking, cleaning, or laundry,\nexcept that intellectual men seem to spend a little more time\ncooking than other men do. This may also reflect the\ngreater flexibility of intellectuals' jobs.\nThe higher classes are less likely to have their teenagers\ndo housework, and more likely to hire help for these tasks.\nOne kind of hiring help that does show a class fraction\ndifference is in whether parents ever hire tutors. The great\nmajority of parents in all categories say they never hire\ntutors. However, a quarter of professional parents, and 30%\nof the business middle class, sometimes hire tutors for their\nchildren. Perhaps the professionals and business middle\nwant their kids to get good grades, but are less confident in\ntheir own abilities to teach their children themselves.\nThe upper-middle class husbands and wives seem to be\nhappiest with their relationship with one another, and the\nlower middles the least happy. I think this is mostly because\nthe upper middles communicate best with one another. The\nintellectuals seem to communicate best of all. The survey\n(N=803) Business Professions Intellectuals Bus. Middle Para-pro Know. middle Lower middle\n(N=803) Business Professions Intellectuals Bus. Middle Para-pro Know. Middle Lower Middle\nasked a series of questions of this form: \"Many people have\ndisagreements in their relationships. Please indicate below the\napproximate extent of agreement and disagreement between\nyou and your spouse/partner for each item on the following\nlist.\" The summary question in this series asked \"Overall, I am\nsatisfied with my relationship with my spouse/partner.\"\nIn the other questions leading up to this summary\nevaluation, intellectuals are the most pleased with the person-\nality characteristics and personal habits of their spouses. They\nare most likely to be happy about how they make decisions and\nresolve conflicts as a couple. And they are the happiest with\nhow they manage their leisure and spend time together. In\nhandling their duties are parents, intellectual men are second\nmost satisfied, after Business Middle men (the women did not\ndiffer significantly). The paraprofessional women are most\nlikely to agree that \"I have never regretted my relationship with\nmy partner, not even for moment,\" with the intellectuals falling\nin the middle. Perhaps intellectuals on principle want to be\nopen to every idea, so they are unwilling to affirm that they\nnever for a moment had regrets about any subject.\nWho Marries Whom?\nOne of the perennial puzzles of class and status research is\nfiguring out the social class of a married couple. Prior to the\n1970s the sociological convention was simply to treat the\nhusband's class markers--occupation, education, and\nincome--as establishing the family's social class. Since\nthe 1970s many more women have their own occupations\nand income outside the home, and sociology has been more\nattentive to the distinctive contributions of women to all\naspects of social life. Which has made it hard, indeed, to\nuse one simple measure of a couple's joint social class.\nMy rule of thumb, based on research, experience, and\ngeneral knowledge of sex roles, is that a couple's social class\nis primarily determined by his occupation and her education.\nA quarter of our 346 married couples share the same job\ngroup (that is, a manager married to a manager, a professional\nto a professional, etc.). They are distributed thus:\nWomen, as a rule, like to marry up--they tend to choose\nmen who are a little more than the women are in each\ncategory that affects resource provision--richer, with a\nhigher status job, more education, taller, older. For women\nwho are themselves high achievers, this is sometimes a\nchallenge. This table shows women who marry their class\nequivalents or higher.\nThe outstanding fact is that the great majority of\nwomen--2/3rds or more--in each occupational category\nmarry their class equivalents if they are in the highest\nclass, or marry up if they are not in the highest class.\nProfessional women are the most class-conserving: most\nof them marry other professionals, and more than 4/5th\nmarry someone within the upper-middle class. Intellec-\ntual women are not far behind. Female business\nexecutives marry a broader range of men than their\nprofessional and intellectual counterparts, but even 2/3rds\nof them marry within the upper-middle class.\nThe middle class and lower-middle class women, by\ncontrast, married up more than they married within their\nown class. The paraprofessionals and knowledge middle class\nmarried up at better than three times the rate that they married\nwithin the middle class. Indeed, these heavily female jobs\nseem designed to be the college-educated counterparts to the\ncareers of upper-middle class men. These jobs include nurses,\ntherapists, and counselors among the paraprofessionals, while\namong the mid-level knowledge workers they include\nscientists, social scientists, and technicians below the Ph.D.\nlevel, as well as teachers, librarians, and religious workers.\nNow compare the patterns of women's and men's\nmarriages. The first column of data comes from the table\n(N=415) Business Professions Intellectuals Bus. middle Para-pro Know. middle Lower middle\nWomen NS\nAs a proportion of all married couples:% (N)\nMarried women % Marrying\nsame occupation\n% Marrying\nsame class\n% Marrying\nsame class or\n+ (up% only)\nabove. It shows the proportion of women in each\noccupational fraction who marry men in the same occupa-\ntional fraction. The second column shows the comparable\nproportion of men who marry women in their same\noccupational fraction.\nThere are many more women than men in the parapro-\nfessional and knowledge middle categories. As we have\nseen, these women tend to marry up to upper-middle-class\nmen. There are more men than women in the professions\nand, to a lesser extent, the business middle categories.\nProfessional women marry professional men to a very high\nextent. The remainder of professional men mostly marry\nclass-equivalent women (61.3%), with the largest group\nmarrying business managers. Specifically, 18.6% of profes-\nsional men are married to female professionals. 34.0% are\nmarried to managers, and only 8.7% are married to\nintellectual women. Business middle men are also heavily\nmarried to business upper-middle women, with more than\n40% of these men marrying executives.\nVertical Inequalities vs. Horizontal Distinctions\nThe corporate managers and executives have the most\neconomic capital, while the intellectuals and culture producers\nhave the most cultural capital. They make a spectrum that runs\nacross the college-educated class in the United States today.\nThe professions occupy a midpoint in this spectrum, leaning\ntoward the managers. Intellectuals work with, think about, and\ntake their identity from the specific kinds of cultural\nknowledge they work with. Managers try to make a profit\nfrom the efficient management of any kind of cultural\nknowledge. Professionals make a profit from the efficient\nmanagement of a specific kind of cultural knowledge.\nThese differences among the three top fractions of the\ncollege-going class appear in how they approach family\nlife. Intellectuals tend to make marriages that are more\negalitarian, more flexible, invest more in their children's\neducation, and tend to take a more liberal view of social\nlife. Managers tend toward the other end of the spectrum on\nall these points. Professionals tend to be in the middle.\nStratification studies in sociology tend to treat the\ncollege-going class as all one stratum. We focus almost\nexclusively on vertical inequality. Yet the horizontal\ndistinctions within the same broad stratum are more\nimportant in shaping the actual lives of individuals and\nfamilies within the college class. While the spectrum is, in\nprinciple, a fluid range of differences, sociology can\nfruitfully map the distinctions within the college class by\nfocusing on the lives and families of managers, professio-\nnals, and intellectuals.\nFurther Reading\nAbbott, A. 1988.
