Women with polycystic ovary syndrome\ncan experience co-morbidities, including depressive symptoms. This research explores the experience of living with\npolycystic ovary syndrome and co-morbidities. Totally, 10 participants with polycystic ovary syndrome took part in\nSkypeTM interviews and analysed using thematic analysis. Four themes emerged from the data: change (to life plans and\nchanging nature of condition); support (healthcare professionals, education and relationships); co-morbidities (living with\nother conditions and depression, self-harm and suicidal ideation) and identity (feminine identity and us and them). The\nfindings highlight the need for screening of women with polycystic ovary syndrome for depressive disorders.\n",

Women with PCOS experience many\nsymptoms including hirsutism (Keegan et al., 2003), obe-\nsity, acne, alopecia and menstrual irregularities (Rasgon\net al., 2003). Women with PCOS can suffer from more than\none condition, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular\nbowel syndrome (IBS; Mathur et al., 2010) and thyroid dis-\net al., 2013). Women with PCOS are also at elevated risk of\ndeveloping depression (Bhattacharya and Jha, 2010) and\nanxiety (Laggari et al., 2009) disorders and have higher\nlevels of depression and psychological morbidity (Coffey\nfound that women with PCOS have a higher prevalence\n(31%) of mild or moderate depressive symptom levels\ncompared to a control group (17%). Relatedly, Deeks et al.\n(2011) report that women with PCOS have increased\nanxiety, depression and negative body image compared to\nwomen without PCOS. Furthermore, women with PCOS\nhave an impaired quality of life and an increased preva-\nlence of psychological morbidity (Ching et al., 2007).\nHowever, Elsenbruch et al. (2006) report that psychiatric\nillnesses in women with PCOS may go undetected. Thus,\nwomen with PCOS may experience co-morbidities that\nmay have a negative impact on their quality of life; how-\never, the majority of research in this area has been quantita-\ntive or has taken place in a clinical setting.\nQualitative research would aide our understanding of\nthe psychological impact of PCOS, and other conditions,\non quality of life. To date, few studies have explored PCOS\n`Everything's from the inside out with\nPCOS': Exploring women's experiences\nof living with polycystic ovary syndrome\nand co-morbidities through SkypeTM\ninterviews\nSophie Williams1, David Sheffield1 and Rebecca C Knibb1,2\n Keywords\nanxiety, depression, polycystic ovary syndrome, SkypeTM\n1University of Derby, UK\n2Aston University, UK\nCorresponding author:\nSophie Williams, Centre for Psychological Research, University of\nDerby, Kedleston Road, Derby DE22 1GB, UK.\nEmail: s.williams3@derby.ac.uk\nReport of empirical study\n2 Health Psychology Open \nfrom a qualitative perspective (Crete and Adamshick, 2011;\nMoreover, those studies excluded women with PCOS who\nexperienced co-morbidities; Moreira and Azevedo (2006)\nargue that incorporating qualitative approaches into PCOS\nstudies could contribute to our understanding of the impact\nof the disease. This study, therefore, aims to explore the\nimpact of PCOS on quality of life, through qualitative\nmethods. It is the first such study to explicitly include\nwomen with PCOS who may have other health conditions;\nthis is of particular importance given the high proportion of\nco-morbidities in women with PCOS.\nMethods\nOnline research methods\nWomen with PCOS are frequently socially isolated\n(Kitzinger and Willmott, 2002); therefore, the mode of data\ncollection needs careful consideration. Seymour (2001)\nsuggests that online data collection methods enable the\nresearcher to access inaccessible domains, such as hard to\nreach populations or socially isolated groups. Kraut et al.\n(2004) also argue that online research could make apparent\npsychological phenomena that do not exist in traditional\nsettings. Sullivan (2012) has proposed that there is poten-\ntial for data collection in social research through the use of\ntechnology such as SkypeTM and Google Hangout.\nAccordingly, online research may enable access to a\nsocially isolated population such as women with PCOS.\nDeakin and Wakefield (2013) suggest that online syn-\nchronous interviews using, for example, Skype are a use-\nful replacement of traditional face-to-face interviews.\nThey describe several advantages of using Skype to con-\nduct interviews including allowing more flexibility for the\nresearcher and participant, and being more cost and time\nefficient. Janghorban et al. (2014) argue that Skype offers\na useful alternative to face-to-face interviews and is suit-\nable for conducting individual interviews. Previous\nresearch using Skype has explored online health forums\n(Fan et al., 2013) and online psychiatric consultations\nthere was a high acceptability of online consultations via\nSkype in their participants. This suggests that Skype is a\nviable way to conduct online research. Accordingly, this\nstudy explored how women with PCOS perceive the\nimpact of the condition on their quality of life through\nonline Skype interviews.\nParticipants\nParticipants were recruited via the social networking web-\nsite, Facebook. A recruitment post was posted to different\nPCOS support groups available on Facebook after agree-\nment from the group moderator. The inclusion criteria for\nthis study were as follows: aged 18 and over, lived in the\nUK and suffered from symptoms of PCOS. Participants\nwere not required to have a co-morbidity to take part in the\nresearch. Totally, 10 participants agreed to participate and\nwere interviewed for 40\u00ad90minutes. Of these, nine partici-\npants spontaneously discussed suffering from co-morbidi-\nties, such as depression, IBS and hyperthyroidism, and\ntherefore just these nine were included in this analysis.\nParticipants' ages ranged between 20 and 41\nyears; three\nparticipants chose not to disclose their age.\nMaterials\nInterviews were conducted using Skype (voice call only)\nover the Internet. Skype is an online method of making free\nvideo or telephone calls; it also allows for individuals to\nsend text-based messages to one another for free of cost.\nThe interviews were recorded using Evaer computer soft-\nware (Evaer Technology, http://www.evaer.com/index.\nhtm). Interview questions were developed after a review of\nthe literature and included questions such as, `Could you\ndescribe a typical day living with PCOS?' and `Have you\nchanged the way you deal with your PCOS and its symp-\ntoms over time?'\nProcedure\nAfter participants had registered their interest in taking part\nin the study by email, they were sent an information sheet\nand a consent form by return email. They were informed\nthat they did not need to fill anything in but were advised to\nread both documents before deciding whether they wished\nto take part in the research, thus ensuring participants had\nsufficient time to consider the implications of taking part in\nthe research (The National Health Service Health Research\nAuthority (NHS HRA), n.d.). Participants who emailed to\nsay they would like to take part arranged an interview\nappointment with the researcher. At the time of the sched-\nuled interview, participants were called through Skype\n(Microsoft). The participant was then sent the statements of\nconsent from the consent form and asked to consent using\nthe text-based service provided by Skype. They were also\nreminded that their information would be stored confiden-\ntially and they had a right to withdraw. The researcher then\ninformed the participant that the Skype call was being\nrecorded.\nEthics\nResearch complied with The British Psychological\nSociety's (BPS, 2009) ethical guidelines and their guide-\nlines for Internet-mediated research (BPS, 2013) and ethi-\ncal approval was obtained from the Psychology Research\nEthics Committee at the University of Derby (Ethics\nWilliams et al. 3\nAnalysis\nThe online interviews were transcribed and then analysed\nusing an inductive thematic analysis (Braun and Clarke,\n2006). Thematic analysis is a method for identifying and\nreporting themes within the data, which organises and\ndescribes the data in detail (Braun and Clarke). To analyse\nthe data according to the six steps recommended by Braun\nand Clarke, the transcript was first read and re-read and\nthen initial codes were generated. Next, the initial codes\nwere sorted into potential themes. The themes were then\nreviewed, defined and named. Finally, the thematic analy-\nsis was written up. The final themes were reviewed by two\nother health psychology researchers to ensure all were in\nagreement, that the themes accurately represented the data\nand there was not too much overlap between themes (Braun\nand Clarke).\nFindings\nParticipants in this study experienced a variety of symp-\ntoms including hirsutism, obesity, acne and infertility. The\nparticipants also suffered from other conditions, both phys-\nical and psychological, in addition to their PCOS. Four\nmajor themes emerged from the data: change (to life plans\nand changing nature of condition); co-morbidities (living\nwith other conditions and depression, self-harm and sui-\ncidal ideation); support (healthcare professionals, educa-\ntion and relationships) and identity (feminine identity and\nus and them). All identifying details have been removed\nfrom the quotes and participants have been referred to by\npseudonyms throughout the analysis in order to ensure ano-\nnymity (BPS, 2010). Participants who chose not to disclose\ntheir age are denoted by AU.\nChange\nTo life plans\nSeveral participants described how PCOS had caused them to\nchange their life plans, particularly their plans to start a fam-\nily. In the quote below, Dawn discusses how having a large\nfamily was the `planned thing to do' and what they (her and\nher husband) `had planned to do'before they got married:\nwhen me and my husband first got together it was you know,\nmy husband's one of six, I'm one of five, it was the planned\nthing to do and that's what we had planned to do before we got\nmarried erm but it, it, did bother me for a long time, a very long\ntime actually, erm but I think the older I've gotten and the\nolder we've gotten the more, I think since I turned 30, it's\nbecome less of an issue, if you like because we've just, we've\ngot used to it. You know, when I turned 30 we'd been dealing\nwith it for nearly ten years. So I don't know if it's erm, it might\nhave impacted to start off with, but it's not, I don't, I used to\nlook at children and think yeah I'd love one. (Dawn, 36years)\nSimilarly, Julie (below) states that she had been `dream-\ning' about having a family for almost `30\nyears'. She dis-\ncusses, in the quote below, how the impact of PCOS on her\nfertility was `very hard to grasp' as it was something she\nhad `always wanted' from a young age. The quote illus-\ntrates how women with PCOS who plan or want a family\nmay have to change the plans they had for their life:\nI really found it very hard to grasp that the one thing that I'd\nalways wanted right from, well from being a little girl and\nplaying with, playing with dollies and that sort of thing. I\nalways knew I wanted children, even before I wanted a\nboyfriend. I knew that malarkey and always knew that I wanted\na family and so this thing that I've been sort of looking forward\nto and dreaming about for nearly the whole of my 30years was\nkind of like the, the rug pulled out from under my feet kind of\nthing a little bit and it was erm pretty horrible really. (Julie,\nIn contrast to Dawn and Julie, in the quote below Holly\ndescribes how she planned to have kids later in life after she\nhad established a career. Holly stresses that due to having\nPCOS she felt pressured by healthcare professionals to\nhave children `sooner, rather than later' and change the\n`plan' she had for her life:\nevery doctors tells me that I need to start thinking about having\nchildren sooner rather than later, that's quite a change erm\n`cause I'm an army wife so I travel around a lot which makes\nit hard to get jobs and kind of puts your career on the back foot\nso I was hoping to establish a career, a, a settled base and then\nhave children but I'm not sure how that's going to work out for\nme now. So yeah, I think I probably will have to change my\nplan slightly. (Holly, 25years)\nThe impact of PCOS on the ability to conceive for\nwomen with PCOS has been highlighted previously by\nSnyder (2006) who found that women with PCOS felt\nuncertain about their ability to become pregnant. Similarly,\nall the participants (n\n=\nexpressed their concerns on their ability to get pregnant\nand the impact of their PCOS on conception. This study,\nhowever, is the first to discuss the pressure women with\nPCOS feel to have children earlier in life than they may\nhave originally planned due to pressure from healthcare\nprofessionals.\nResearch exploring the fertility intentions following\ntesting for a BRCA1 gene mutation found that predictive\ngenetic testing for late-onset cancer susceptibility affects\nfamily planning decision-making (Smith et al., 2004).\ngenetic results could influence an individual's decisions\nregarding reproduction. As such, testing positive for a\nBRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation may be similar to that\nof PCOS when considering the impact a diagnosis could\nhave on the individual's life plans concerning children.\n4 Health Psychology Open \nHowever, further similarities cannot be assumed due to\nthe differences in the two conditions, specifically, while\nwomen with BRCA1/2 are faced with a choice that will\nimpact their life plans, women with PCOS experiencing\nfertility issues have this choice removed and as such, have\nno control about how their condition will impact their life\nplans.\nChanging nature of the condition\nSeveral participants describe the changing nature of their\nPCOS symptoms and their inability to predict how their\ncondition will change over their lifetime. Crete\nand Adamshick (2011) reported that women with PCOS\nwere frustrated due to dealing with the uncertainties\nof symptoms and diagnosis. Dawn states in the quote\nbelow that her PCOS symptoms have `got worse over the\nyears' demonstrating how the symptoms of PCOS are\nunstable:\nIt's definitely just got worse over the years. A lot worse erm I\nthink, I think from the age of 25 its suddenly started kicking\noff erm with you know having to start taking care of you know,\nthe hair issue and it just, as I said, it just seems to be getting\nworse. (Dawn, 36years)\nSimilarly, Holly discusses the changing nature of her\nmoods as a result of PCOS in the quote below. She\ndescribes how she feels she has `no control ... whatso-\never' and how she has taken medication to try and control\nthe symptoms:\nI think it's because it's, everything's from the inside out with\nPCOS. It's really hard to control anything that happens unless,\nunless you want to go on a contraceptive pill, which I don't. I\nthink that's probably the only way that you control it ... I have\nno control over it whatsoever. I can be feeling really good and\nreally happy and brilliant and then just get a whole load of\nspots and think and what is that about? It's really upsetting and\nI can feel really low and really depressed about it and my\nskin's looking great and I just don't understand it at all. It's\nhorrible. (Holly, 25years)\nHolly was not alone in describing changes she had\nmade to try and control her PCOS. Each participant\nreported trying different medications or symptom man-\nagement techniques to try and control or deal with their\nsymptoms, including hair removal and skin care routines.\nThis has been reported by several other studies (Crete\nPCOS may experience changes in their PCOS symptoms\nwith age, particularly in adolescence and later life.\nHealthcare professionals should be considerate of these\nchanges in presenting symptoms in women with PCOS\nand offer appropriate support and guidance.\nCo-morbidities\nLiving with other conditions\nSix of the participants (Holly, Tanya, Kay, Sharon, Emma\nand Dawn) discussed how they lived with other physical\nconditions as well as their PCOS. These conditions were\nvaried and include migraines, IBS, hypermobility syn-\ndrome, hypothyroidism, adrenal fatigue and fallopian tube\nobstruction.\nIn the quote below, Tanya describes how she has IBS as\nwell as PCOS. Interestingly, despite suffering from two\nchronic health conditions, Tanya states that she and her fam-\nily `don't really suffer from anything'. The quotes below\nsuggest that for Tanya, she identifies as being well, rather\nthan `poorly' even with her PCOS and IBS symptoms:\nWe've never really, we're not really like a poorly family. We\ndon't really suffer from anything. Mmm I do get a lot of colds,\nI always pick everything up. Oh and I do have a, I've actually\njust realised, a touch of IBS. (Tanya, AU)\nTo date, only one study has explored the prevalence of\nIBS in women with PCOS. Mathur et al. (2010) found that\nnot only were women with PCOS more likely to have IBS\nthan healthy controls, but that women with PCOS and IBS\nsymptoms were more likely to have a higher body mass\nindex (BMI) and body fat percentage compared to women\nwith PCOS but who did not suffer from IBS. In this study,\nonly Tanya reported experiencing symptoms of IBS; how-\never, this finding does demonstrate a need for further\nresearch exploring the prevalence, and experience of IBS in\nwomen with PCOS.\nTanya's experience contrasts with Kay who had several\nother conditions in addition to PCOS. In the quote below,\nKay discusses how she has asthma, eczema and hypermo-\nbility (hypermobility is a condition where people experi-\nence loose or supple joints that can often result in pain). She\nexplains that she has `quite a bad time with them', suggest-\ning she finds it difficult living with multiple morbidities:\nI have erm asthma, erm I have eczema and I also have\nhypermobility erm which is basically from the double\njointedness [sic] erm and I have a lot of problems with my\njoints, especially my knees erm and I have quite a bad time\nwith them. (Kay, AU)\nThe quotes above demonstrate how women with PCOS\nmay struggle to live with other debilitating conditions in\naddition to PCOS. Dawn describes that it was a `hell of a\nshock'and `devastating'to learn that she had an additional\nhealth issue to PCOS, suggesting that this was a traumatic\nexperience for her. This suggests that women with PCOS\nand a co-morbid condition may find it difficult to cope,\nparticularly at the time of diagnosis of the additional\ncondition:\nWilliams et al. 5\nit was quite a shock because it looks like one of my fallopian\ntubes stopped working as well. So I went in to perhaps go and\nhave erm IVF and I went and had a scan with a, well they inject\na dye into my tubes and erm one of them wouldn't even go up\nand it was a hell of a shock just to find out well one of your\ntubes is now not working at all and you're not producing erm\nthe eggs you need and erm all this all down to this, this\npolycystic ovary syndrome ... it was very devastating at the\ntime. (Dawn, 36years)\nDepression, self-harm and suicidal ideation\nSix participants (Dawn, Kay, Julie, Marie, Debbie and\nTanya) in this study reported suffering from depressive\nsymptoms including self-harm and suicidal ideation. This\nhas not previously been reported in any published qualita-\ntive research. Quantitative research has shown that women\nwith PCOS report more depressive symptoms (Himelein\nand Thatcher, 2006) and a higher prevalence of depression\ncontrols even after accounting for BMI and age (Deeks\net al., 2011), but findings from this study show that for\nsome women this may be particularly severe.\nThe relationship between PCOS and depression was\ndiscussed by Kay and Marie (below). Kay states that her\ndepression `is led from' her PCOS suggesting that rather\nthan her depression being a result of a biological cause,\nsuch as polycystic ovaries, Kay sees it as a result of living\nwith the symptoms of PCOS. Conversely, Marie states\nthat it is her PCOS that adds to her depression, suggesting\nthat she perceives this as a separate phenomenon. This\nsuggests that participants are not receiving adequate infor-\nmation regarding their conditions from their healthcare\nprofessional and may not get the best care for them (Percy\n`cause I don't, for me polycystic ovaries doesn't create my\ndepression, my depression is led from the aspects of polycystic\novaries. (Kay, AU)\nI wouldn't have thought the depression would impact the\nPCOS really but I suppose it could, I haven't really thought\nabout that but definitely having the PCOS adds to the\ndepression because of all the things you hate about yourself\nmakes it diff, harder. (Marie, 20years)\nMarie also admits that she has a history of self-harm.\nShe discusses how she still thinks about self-harming and\nthe impact PCOS and her depression have on one another;\nshe suggests it is `a cycle' between her depression and her\nthoughts about her PCOS:\nI don't think I deal with it very well because erm I have a\nhistory of self-harming which got quite bad at one point erm I\ndon't do it anymore but it's always still in my mind so when I\nhave a really bad day I always still think about doing it. Erm\nand when, if I'm depressed about PCOS my thoughts can sort\nof go round and round and switch between all the different\nthings that PCOS is doing and the depression is doing and it's\nall just a cycle really as when I do get really depressed it's hard\nto get back out of it. (Marie, 20years)\nTwo participants reported that they had or do self-harm\n(Dawn and Marie). Currently, there is no published research\nreporting incidences of self-harm in women with PCOS.\nDawn describes how she will self-harm when she gets `hor-\nmonal surges':\nI think I get an over, an overload of testosterone because my\nwhole attitude changes and it's really unpleasant for my\nhusband and my family when I go through this, I think, a\nhormonal surge ... I will self-harm when I get this. It's like I'm\nmore reckless, erm it's, it's, I become withdrawn and then I\nalmost become like dual personality. (Dawn, 36years)\nResearch by M\u00e5nsson et al. (2008) has found that sui-\ncide attempts were higher in women with PCOS than\nage-matched controls; lifetime suicide attempts were\nseven times more common for women with PCOS than\ncontrols. Suicidal ideation was briefly discussed by\nTanya (below); she describes how on `really, really blue\ndays' she would begin to think about `ending it' but that\nthinking of her family and the impact it would have on\nthem helps prevent her from following through with these\nthoughts:\nI had suffered some days where I was so depressed and so\ndown I wouldn't leave the house, some days I wouldn't go out\nto buy food because I was just so miserable and so fed up and\nthere are times that you, not that, you just have these really,\nreally blue days where you just think `Oh God, I'd love to just\nend, end it all as in, not, I'm finding it hard to explain it. I\nrealise by ending it you would obviously end your life but I\nfeel like if my body just stopped working. If I just shut my\nbody down and it will all stop and it will stop doing this and it\nwill stop doing that, but then obviously I just think to myself\nit's a selfish way of thinking. (Tanya, AU)\nSuicidal ideation is considered a serious psychiatric\nissue in patients diagnosed with chronic illnesses (Amer\nand Hamdan-Mansour, 2014); however, the way in which\nphysical illness increases the risk of suicidal behaviour is\nnot completely understood (O'Connor and Knock, 2014).\nWebb et al. (2012) suggest that the link between suicidal\nbehaviour and physical illness is attributable to depressive\nsymptomology; however, Scott et al. (2010) report that\nthe link remains even after controlling for mental disor-\nders. As such, more research is needed to explore these\nlinks within a population of women with PCOS. Moreover,\nCarpenter et al. (2000) found that obesity was associated\nwith an increased risk of depression and suicidal ideation\namong women in the United States. Similarly, Ekb\u00e4ck\n6 Health Psychology Open \net al. (2009) report that women in their study, who suf-\nfered from hirsutism, had also contemplated suicide as a\nway of escaping their condition. As obesity and hirsutism\nare common symptoms of PCOS (Cipkala-Gaffin et al.,\n2012), it is important for healthcare professionals to be\naware of this risk in women with PCOS.\nSupport\nHealthcare professionals\nEvery participant in this study conveyed `frustration' over\nthe support, or lack of support that they received from\nhealthcare professionals (Kitzinger and Willmott, 2002).\nSeveral women expressed having to `push'for tests to diag-\nnose their PCOS after they are presented to their doctors\nwith symptoms. This is illustrated by Dawn in the quote\nbelow who presented with symptoms of hirsutism and\ninfertility:\nI think I became a right pain in the butt to the, my doctors\nbecause I kept going on `I think something's not right', you\nknow, erm and obviously they just, they just kept fobbing\n(sic) me off. You know, `you'll grow out of it', erm and I\nthink it was, it was because I started getting erm like quite a\nheavy moustache on my top lip ... I couldn't fall pregnant\nafter six months that they actually put me through for a\nscan. Erm so, yeah so then I reckon yeah it's when they\nfound out that I had the little string of pearls going on.\nHolly also describes how her doctors made her feel like\nher symptoms were not real. She discusses how she saw\nseveral general practitioners (GPs) before she was able to\ntake the tests to diagnose PCOS:\nI saw a doctor and he said I'll treat you as if you have got\nPCOS but I'm not going to do any tests and, and this wasn't\ngood enough. So I went to another GP and she said `no\nabsolutely, let's do your tests' erm and it just strikes me that\ndoctor's, GPs especially just don't really know anything about\nPCOS. (Holly, 25years)\nSeveral participants described a similar experience of\nvisiting several GPs before getting what they perceived was\nappropriate care. This appears to be a common problem for\nwomen with PCOS (Crete and Adamshick, 2011; Snyder,\nhealthcare professionals need to be more supportive of\nwomen with PCOS particularly at the time of diagnosis,\nand that there is a need for them to recognise the impact of\nthis condition, and co-morbid conditions, on an individu-\nal's quality of life. Future research exploring these phe-\nnomena from a healthcare provider's perspective may help\nshed new light on this problem and how this may be\nimproved.\nEducation\nSeveral participants in this research resorted to researching\nand educating themselves about their condition due to a\nlack of information and support from their healthcare pro-\nfessionals. Dawn describes below how she felt when she\nwas diagnosed, and that she was left to research her condi-\ntion and educate herself about PCOS:\nIt's just like we've got this, this label of polycystic ovaries and but\nthere's not a lot of explanation and that was about, oh goodness\nme, that was about 15years ago and it was up to me to sort of like\ntry and research as much as I could on it. (Dawn, 36years)\nHolly also proactively researched her condition using\nbooks and the Internet (blogs) that allowed her to create her\n`own action plan' in order to be better able to manager her\ncondition. She explains that although there is `a wealth of\ninformation out there' this is not from healthcare profes-\nsionals but from women with PCOS who are `doing it\nthemselves':\nSo when I got the diagnosis it made me, you know, I could go\nout and read the books and read the blogs and come up with\nmy own action plan; which I did ... So it really does, there's\nsuch a wealth of information out there, but unfortunately it's\nnot from the medical erm industry, it's from people doing it\nthemselves, people who want to cure it naturally. (Holly,\nLater in the interview, Holly goes on to discuss that\ndoing her own research and trying new ways to manage her\nsymptoms can become `exhausting'. She also describes\nhow, if new methods do not work it can lead her to going\n`back down to that low place', suggesting that the trial and\nerror process of research can be taxing:\nI do lots of research and I think oh I'll try this. I'll try something\nnew and you kind of rally yourself to do new things and then\nyou realise it's not going to work, it's not working then you go\nback down to that low place and then you've got to rally\nyourself up again to try something else and it's just, it's quite\nexhausting just always, I don't know. (Holly, 25years)\nThese findings accord with Snyder's (2006) who found\nthat women with PCOS actively searched for answers with-\nout the help of a healthcare professional. Similarly, Crete and\nAdamshick (2011) found that participants in their study dis-\ncussed formally searching for answers through the use of\nonline resources and books, supporting the findings of this\nstudy that suggest that women with PCOS self-educate.\nRelationships\nSeveral participants found support and information from\nother women with PCOS by using online support groups.\nWilliams et al. 7\nHolly found support from women with PCOS online,\nclaiming that they have `more knowledge' than her family\nand are `more understanding'. The quote below demon-\nstrates how Holly's family was unable to `understand' her\ncondition in a way that other women with PCOS could,\neven though they were supportive. Thus, using online sup-\nport groups may help reduce feelings of loneliness or isola-\ntion in women with PCOS:\nI think erm these women have er more knowledge than my\nfamily about it and they're more understanding. My family are\nsupportive but they don't understand it at all. Even my sister\nwhose got PCOS, she has, she hasn't really got any symptoms\nother than a bit of excess hair. She's never even researched it\nbecause she doesn't feel she needs to but these women online,\nthey've done so much research and, and they're so supportive.\nThis concurs with Holbrey and Coulson (2013) who\nfound that participation in an online support group for\nwomen with PCOS can help women feel empowered, as it\nallows them to connect with other women with PCOS and\nenables them to access information and advice.\nIdentity\nFeminine identity\nSix participants (Tanya, Dawn, Emma,Anna, Julie and Kay)\ndiscussed their PCOS in relation to their identity as a\nwoman. Washington (2008) also found that for women with\nPCOS, the condition could have a negative impact on their\nself-concept including their self-image and their femininity.\nIn the quote below, Tanya describes how instead of feel-\ning `sexy' or `attractive', because of her PCOS she feels\nlike a `man'. She states that she feels `like a freak' because\nof her PCOS and its symptoms, suggesting she thinks she is\nabnormal because of her condition. Kitzinger and Willmott\n(2002) also found that their participants described them-\nselves as `freaks' because of the symptoms of their PCOS:\nI think, as a woman, you, you want to feel sexy. You want to\nfeel attractive to the opposite sex. I think when you have these\nproblems, you don't. You feel like a freak. You feel like a man.\n(Tanya, AUyears)\nA number of women talked about having masculine\nattributes due to symptoms of PCOS, threatening their\nidentity as a woman; women with PCOS can see them-\nselves as unfeminine, often using male language and termi-\nnology to refer to their PCOS and its symptoms (Williams\nI've got a very good sense of humour about it because\nsometimes I swear I'm just like one penis away from turning\ninto a guy. (Dawn, 36years)\nI'm waiting for the day when one of them is drunk and\nparticularly aggressive and mentions it erm and makes some\ncomment along the lines of bearded lady or God knows what\nthey'd do. (Emma, 25years)\nSimilarly, Washington (2008) describes how partici-\npants felt that PCOS negatively impacted on all areas\nthey associated with being a woman because of symp-\ntoms such as hirsutism, alopecia and infertility problems.\nSnyder (2006) found that women with PCOS felt that\ntheir symptoms impacted on their perception of them-\nselves as female and reported that women with PCOS\nwanted to be normal and look more feminine. Kitzinger\nand Willmott (2002) also found that women with PCOS\nfelt challenged in their perception of themselves as\nwomen because of their symptoms.\nUs and them\nSeveral participants discussed how they felt it was `unfair'\nthat they had PCOS compared to other women without\nPCOS. Tanya states that it is `really unfair' that she suffers\nfrom PCOS and `not' other `people', questioning `why' she\nhas the condition:\nI do wonder a lot, why me? Why, why did I have to it and not,\nand not people? I don't know anybody else whose got it er and\npart of me does feel like my bodies let me down and, and it's\nreally unfair. (Tanya, AU)\nSnyder (2006) found that women with PCOS identified\nthemselves as different to women without the condition.\nThe participants in this study made social comparisons that\ncould have a negative impact on the quality of life and\nadjustment to the condition (Dibb and Yardley, 2006). This\nis also demonstrated in the quote below by Debbie:\nI suppose you have to think more about things rather than\nwhen other people wouldn't really give, like other women and\nstuff probably wouldn't give thoughts to. (Debbie, AUyears)\nDiscussion\nThis research explored the impact of PCOS and co-morbid\nconditions on women who have PCOS and found four\nsuper ordinate themes: change (to life plans and changing\nnature of condition); co-morbidities (living with other con-\nditions and depression, self-harm and suicide); support\n(healthcare professionals, education and relationships) and\nidentity (feminine identity and us and them). The themes of\nsupport and identity have been discussed previously in the\nliterature (Kitzinger and Willmott, 2002). However, this\nresearch is the first to explicitly explore women's experi-\nences of living with PCOS and co-morbid conditions. Thus,\nthis research is the first to report how women with PCOS\n8 Health Psychology Open \nand co-morbid conditions perceive its impact on their life\nplans and how they manage their conditions.\nWhile quantitative research has described the preva-\nlence of depression in women with PCOS (Bhattacharya\nand Jha, 2010), this study is the first to report how women\nwith PCOS experience and live with this condition and\nother co-morbidities such as IBS. Over half of the partici-\npants in this study discussed depression, self-harm and/or\nsuicide; yet, there is little discussion of self-harm and sui-\ncide in the literature. Of the two studies that do exist, both\nexplore this using quantitative methodology and a clinical\ntherefore, they do not attempt to understand how women\nwith PCOS experience this. This suggests that the experi-\nence of living with PCOS and depression is under\nresearched. Healthcare professionals should be aware that\nwomen with PCOS are likely to report depressive symp-\ntoms, self-harm and suicide and therefore, offer them nec-\nessary and appropriate support. Further research should\nexplore the prevalence of self-harm in women with PCOS\nand aim to develop interventions to decrease depressive\nsymptoms in this population.\nThis study also highlights how women with PCOS may\nfeel under pressure to have children from healthcare pro-\nfessionals and the impact this can have on their life plans.\nThe experience of being pressured to conceive by health-\ncare professionals appears to be a unique phenomenon for\nwomen with PCOS; women who test positively for the\nBRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutation may also experience\na similar impact on their plans to have children (Smith\net al., 2004). However, for women with the BRCA1 and\nBRCA2 gene, this impact may be a choice of whether to\nhave children or not, for women with PCOS this choice\ncan be removed. Certainly, research suggests that infertile\nwomen report a poorer quality of life compared to con-\ntrols (Monga et al., 2004) and they experience similar\npsychological symptoms to those associated with cancer,\nhypertension and cardiac rehabilitation (Domar et al.,\n1993). Infertility can have a large negative impact on the\nwomen who experience it, without the perceived added\npressure to conceive from a healthcare professional that\nsome women with PCOS experience. Thus, research is\nneeded that explores the psychological impact that pres-\nsure from a healthcare professional to conceive may have\non women with PCOS.\nThe use of Skype interviews in this study meant partici-\npants, who described themselves as socially isolated, were\neasily able to take part, and the costs, including time and\nfinancial costs, were minimal to both the researcher and the\nparticipant. The online interviews may have allowed par-\nticipants to feel comfortable, as evidenced by participant's\nbehaviours, such as answering doors or watching their chil-\ndren, demonstrating minimal interference in their day-to-\nday lives. Nevertheless, while providing an important\naccount of women's experiences living with PCOS and co-\nmorbid conditions, there were a number of limitations with\nthis study. Indeed, it is possible that the presence of chil-\ndren may have had a negative impact on the participant's\nopenness and willingness to discuss their experiences with\nPCOS and any co-morbid conditions.\nUsing Skype was a viable method for data collection for\nthis study, but there were issues with the technology itself\n(Saumure and Given, 2010) in the form of noise interfer-\nence on calls which could have had a negative impact on\nthe interviews and resulted in missing information.\nParticipants in this study were self-selecting and all were\nrecruited through PCOS support groups on the social net-\nworking website Facebook. Therefore, it could be argued\nthat the women in this study were already seeking support\nfor their PCOS. It is unclear what, if any, support partici-\npants received for their co-morbidities from either PCOS\ngroups, or indeed other support groups on Facebook.\nParticipants were not required to have co-morbidities,\nnor were they asked to provide information on clinical\ndiagnoses of any conditions to take part. However, this\nresulted in the participants spontaneously discussing their\nco-morbidities, highlighting the importance of these to the\nparticipants. While previous studies have explored the\nprevalence of specific co-morbidities (including diabetes,\nhypertension, sleep apnoea, anxiety, depression) in a popu-\nlation of women with PCOS (Bethea and Nestler, 2008;\nSirmans et al., 2014), there is a need for further research\nwhich explores the prevalence and impact of clinically\ndiagnosed co-morbidities in women with PCOS in the\nUnited Kingdom, which is inclusive of the conditions men-\ntioned by participants in this study. It also highlights the\nneed for future studies with women with PCOS to be inclu-\nsive of co-morbid conditions.\nIn conclusion, this research has identified several new\nareas of importance for healthcare professionals and\nresearchers including occurrences of self-harm and suicidal\nideation in women with PCOS. Additionally, this study\nhighlights participants' experiences of living with co-, or\noften multiple morbidities as well as their PCOS and its\nassociated symptoms. It reports the apparent unique occur-\nrence of changing life plans due to the condition and conse-\nquently, with regard to family planning, the pressure placed\non individuals by healthcare professionals to conceive.\nFinally, it also highlights the need for appropriate support\nto be available for women with PCOS to help deal with the\npsychological and physical symptoms arising from their\ncondition(s).\n"
