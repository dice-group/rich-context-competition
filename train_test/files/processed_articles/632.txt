The prevalence of depressive symptoms and associated risk factors is described, using data from the\nHispanic EPESE, the first large, representative study of older Mexican Americans.\nMethods. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine the association between depressive symptoms and\nsociodemographics, chronic health conditions, disability, and cultural factors.\nResults. Using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies of Depression scale, 25.6% of the 2,823 subjects reported high\nsymptom levels. Rates among women (31.9%) and particularly men (17.3%) were higher than has been typically\nreported for older Mexican Americans and older adults in general. Consistent with previous studies of older adults,\ngender, lack of insurance, financial strain, chronic health conditions, and disability were found to be associated with\ndepressive symptoms. Several cultural factors were also associated with increased risk, including immigrant status,\nlevels of acculturation and assimilation, health locus of control, and recency of immigration. An interaction between\ngender and immigrant status was found such that, in relation to subjects born in the United States, female immigrants\nwere at significantly higher risk for depressive symptoms, whereas male immigrants were at lower risk.\nDiscussion. Our findings suggest that the increased prevalence can be attributed to higher rates of sociodemo-\ngraphic risk factors and functional disability, coupled with cultural factors and chronic medical conditions.\nDEPRESSION, considered one of the leading mental\nhealth problems among adults, is being viewed in-\ncreasingly as a biopsychosocial phenomenon (Leventhal &\nTomarken, 1987). From this perspective, risk factors in-\nclude social factors (such as gender, education, impoverish-\nment, marital status, and social isolation), psychological\nfactors (such as life stresses and bereavement), and biologi-\ncal factors (such as physical illness and disability), factors\nwhich have been consistently found to be associated with\npsychological distress, regardless of ethnicity or age (Kae-\nbler, Moul, & Farmer, 1995). The biopsychosocial approach\nis particularly appropriate, however, for the study of depres-\nsion among older adults. Surveys such as the Yale, Duke,\nand Iowa Established Populations for the Epidemiologic\nStudy of the Elderly (EPESE) have provided ample evi-\ndence of the influence of these risk factors on mental well-\nbeing (Berkman et al., 1986; Black, Goodwin, & Markides,\nWallace, 1985). Indeed, it has been postulated that much of\nthe increase in self-reported depressive symptoms among\nolder adults (Newman, 1989) can be attributed to the influ-\nence of these risk factors. As Blazer and colleagues pointed\nout, the major risk factors for depression do not seem to\ndiffer by age, but the distribution of these factors often dif-\nfers substantially across the adult age range: older adults\nare more likely to be women, to be impoverished, to live\nalone with fewer social contacts, and to be physically ill\nand disabled (Blazer, Burchett, Service, & George, 1991).\nDespite the general consensus regarding risk factors for\ndepression among older adults, the rates of depression\namong various ethnic groups of older adults appear to dif-\nfer considerably. Review of available mental health data\nindicates that among older community-dwelling non-His-\npanic Whites and African Americans, reported rates of de-\npressive symptoms are generally in the range from 9% to\nMurrell, Himmelfarb, & Wright, 1983; O'Hara, Kohout, &\nWallace, 1985). Inconsistencies exist, however, in epidemi-\nologic findings regarding psychological distress among\nolder Mexican Americans. Several investigators have re-\nported that the burden of psychological distress may be\ngreater among this subgroup of the population than among\nolder adults in general (Frerichs, Aneshensel, & Clark,\nEpidemiologic Studies of Depression scale, the Three Gen-\nerations Study of Mexican Americans reported the preva-\nlence rate of high levels of depressive symptoms to be 20%\namong older adults (Mendes de Leon & Markides, 1988).\nVega, Warheit, Buhl-Auth, and Meinhardt (1984) reported\nrates in the range of 16% to 18%. Similar rates have been\nreported by investigators employing other scales to mea-\nsure psychological distress (Kemp, Staples, & Lopez-Aque-\nres, 1987; Lopez-Aqueres, Kemp, Plopper, Staples, &\nIn contrast, other investigators have reported no elevated\nrisk for psychological distress among older Mexican Amer-\nicans. Rates of 12% to 13%, based on data from the His-\npanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (HHANES;\nGarcia & Marks, 1989; Moscicki, Locke, Rae, & Boyd,\n1989), for example, are more comparable to those reported\nfor older non-Hispanic Whites and African Americans.\nThese inconsistencies might be the result of limitations\nin study methodologies, including sample sizes under 200\nhave included very few individuals over age 65 (Frerichs et\nhave been limited in geographic area, such as only Califor-\nand which were not fully representative of the entire popu-\nlation of older Mexican Americans.\nAnother possible reason for these discrepancies concerns\nadditional risk factors that may influence the psychological\nwell-being of older Mexican Americans. Factors that could\nreduce the rate of depressive symptoms include not only\nlower rates of many chronic health conditions (e.g., stroke\nand hip fracture), but also the greater sense of familism,\nincreased social support, higher rates of marriage, and\ngreater reliance on religion evident in the Mexican Ameri-\ncan culture, in comparison to mainstream American culture\n(Paniagua, 1994). Conversely, cultural factors such as lan-\nguage, fatalism, and the stress associated with immigration\nand acculturation, in addition to the lack of health insurance\ncoverage experienced by many older Mexican Americans,\nmay act to increase the risk for depressive symptoms.\nThis article examines the extent of depressive symptoma-\ntology in older Mexican Americans, as well as demographic,\nsocial, cultural, and health-related correlates, using data\nfrom the Hispanic Established Populations for Epidemio-\nlogic Studies of the Elderly (Hispanic EPESE). This survey\nis the first large-scale population-based study that employs a\nrepresentative sample of older Mexican Americans from five\nof the southwestern United States. It was designed to assess\nthe physical health, mental health, and functional status of\nolder community-dwelling Mexican Americans. In this\nstudy, we address three specific hypotheses:\n1. The prevalence of depressive symptomatology reported\nby older Mexican Americans is substantially higher than\nthat reported by older non-Hispanic Whites and African\nAmericans;\n2. Additional risk factors specific to the Mexican American\nculture are associated with greater risk for depressive\nsymptoms among older Mexican Americans; and\n3. The combination of cultural risk factors and higher\nrates of standard risk factors accounts for the increase in\nreported depressive symptoms among older Mexican\nAmericans.\nicans are age 65 years or older, representing over 5% of the\nentire Mexican American population and the third largest\ngroup of minority elders in the United States (Bureau of the\nCensus, 1990). Adding to our understanding of psychologi-\ncal distress in this group of older adults is important, partic-\nularly in regards to the excess risk among women and im-\nmigrants. In addition, more research regarding the extent of\ndepression and the influences of cultural differences can\nlead not only to improvements in well-being and quality of\nlife for older Mexican Americans, but for all older adults.\nSample\n  is the latest in a series of panel sur-\nveys conducted in various portions of the United States\n(East Boston, New Haven, Iowa, and North Carolina) that\nwere designed to examine the health status of older com-\nmunity-dwelling adults. The initial wave of the Hispanic\norado, New Mexico, Arizona, and California. Area proba-\nbility sampling was employed to sample a total of 3,050\nMexican Americans aged 65 and older, a response rate of\napproximately 86%. In order to construct the sampling\nframe, all counties in the five-state area were ranked ac-\ncording to 1990 Census figures by number of Mexican\nAmericans aged 65 and older. Those counties that con-\ntained 90% of all older Mexican Americans were retained.\nWithin these listed counties, individual census tracts were\nthen similarly ranked and those tracts that included 90% of\nthe older Mexican Americans were listed. Three hundred\nprimary sampling units (PSUs) were then selected with\nprobabilities proportional to the number of older Mexican\nAmericans. Within each of these selected PSUs, all block\ngroups were listed and a cumulative total of households cal-\nculated. Blocks in each track were then selected as sam-\npling units by a random process, and a total of 175 house-\nholds within each sampling unit were screened. Eligible\nrespondents were identified based on reported age, self-\nidentification as a Mexican American, reported birthplace\n(Mexico or the U.S.), and a review of the ethnic back-\nground of an individual's parents and grandparents. Further\ndescription of the survey methods can be found in Markides\nAll interviews were conducted in person and took an av-\nerage of 1 hour 45 minutes to complete. Although inter-\nviews were conducted for a total of 3,050 individuals, the\nanalyses presented here reflect the reports of 2,823 individ-\nuals for whom complete depressive symptom data were\navailable (complete symptom data were not available for\n227 subjects for whom proxy interviews were conducted as\na result of their being too ill or cognitively impaired and 13\nindividuals who responded to less than 17 of the depressive\nitems). When weighted for the actual number of older Mex-\nican Americans in the five-state area, the sample represents\nMeasures\nThe study involved in-home interviews conducted either\nin Spanish or English, depending on the respondent's pref-\nerence. Questionnaire items included self-reports of so-\nciodemographic, cultural, and health-related measures. So-\nciodemographic measures included characteristics such as\nthe respondent's age (as of the most recent birthday), gen-\nder, years of education, whether he or she was currently\nemployed, current marital status, living arrangement (num-\nber of persons residing in the household), and whether he\nor she had a confidant (someone with whom to discuss his\nor her deepest problems). Subjects were categorized as be-\nreaved if they reported that a close friend or relative had\ndied in the year prior to interview. Respondents were also\nasked about health insurance coverage, including private\ninsurance, Medicare coverage (Parts A and B), Medicaid\ncoverage, Veterans' benefits, or if they had no coverage what-\nsoever. Financial strain was measured by asking respon-\ndents if they experienced a great deal, some, little, or no\ndifficulties in paying their monthly bills.\nCultural measures included immigrant status (based on\nreported place of birth) and recency of immigration (five or\nfewer years vs more than five years), as well as levels of\nacculturation and assimilation, which were measured using\na modified version of the Acculturation Scale developed by\nHazuda, Haffner, and Stern (1988). The measure of accul-\nturation consisted of 10 items assessing patterns of English\nand Spanish language use. Possible scores range from 3 to\n50, with lower scores indicative of lower acculturation. The\nmeasure of assimilation consisted of 3 items assessing\nfunctional integration into mainstream society. Possible\nscores range from 3 to 9, with lower scores indicative of\nlower assimilation. Health locus of control was assessed\nwith an item that asked respondents how much control they\nfelt they had over the general state of their health, through\ntheir own actions. This measure was employed as an indica-\ntor of fatalism as it pertains to health.\nHealth-related measures included a series of items in\nwhich the respondents were asked whether they had ever\nbeen told by a doctor that they had certain chronic condi-\ntions, including cardiac problems, stroke, cancer, diabetes,\ngall bladder disease, hip fracture, arthritis, or incontinence.\nIn addition, self-reported impairments in bathing, dressing,\ngrooming, eating, transferring from bed to chair, using a\ntoilet, and walking were measured with the Katz Activities\nof Daily Living scale (ADL; Katz, Ford, Moskowitz, Jack-\nson, & Jaffe, 1963). These items were scored dichoto-\nmously, according to whether the respondent reported need-\ning help to perform the activity. Scores were calculated\nrepresenting the number of chronic conditions and the num-\nber of ADL impairments reported by each respondent.\nPsychological distress was measured with the Center for\nEpidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), which\nwas specifically designed to help identify depressive symp-\ntoms in community surveys (Radloff, 1977). The scale con-\nsists of 20 items that ask how often specific symptoms were\nexperienced during the past week. Responses are scored on\na 4-point scale, with potential total scores ranging from\n0-60. A cut point of 16 or greater is typically used to distin-\nguish symptomatology in the clinical range (Boyd, Weiss-\nthough the scale does not provide a diagnosis of actual\nclinical depression, it has been shown to predict both cur-\nrent and future clinical depression (Roberts & Vernon,\nhas been the most widely used survey measure of psycho-\nlogical distress in studies of older adults and has been\nfound highly reliable and valid (Blazer, Hughes, & George,\nMissing values were computed for 13 individuals who\nhad three or fewer missing CES-D values by substituting\nthe average score of the remaining negative responses for a\nmissing negative item score, or the average score of the re-\nmaining positive responses for a missing positive item\nscore (Berkman et al., 1986). This method of substitution\nmade no change in the alpha coefficient of the scale (0.90).\nTwo measures were derived from the CES-D in this study,\na continuous measure based on the overall score and a\ndichotomous measure of caseness (indicative of high level\nof depressive symptomatology) based on the cutpoint of 16\nor more.\nAnalyses\nDifferences in the mean CES-D scores across indepen-\ndent variables were evaluated with Mest and analysis of\nvariance statistics. Chi-square analysis was employed to\nevaluate differences in the prevalence rates of high levels of\ndepressive symptomatology.\nOnce the bivariate relationships between the depressive\nsymptom measures and social, cultural, and health-related\ncharacteristics were examined, independent variables were\nentered into multiple regression models. Logistic regression\nemploying stepwise selection was used to model the di-\nchotomous measure of high levels of depressive symptoms\n(Glantz & Slinker, 1990; Kleinbaum, Kupper, & Muller,\n1988). Models included testing of interaction terms based\non the presence of significant main effects.\nAll analyses incorporated weighted data that were ad-\njusted for design effects in order to produce results that\nwere representative of the older Mexican American popula-\ntion in the five-state region. Confidence intervals were com-\nputed using SUDAAN (Shah, Barnwell, Hunt, & LaVange,\nRESULTS\nBivariate Results\nTable 1 presents the distribution of sociodemographic,\ncultural, and health-related characteristics for the total sam-\nple and, separately, by gender. About 57% of the respon-\ndents were women, a lower percentage than is often re-\nported with other older ethnic populations but which\nreflects the older Mexican American population. Two thirds\nWomen were more likely to be aged 75 and older than were\nmen. The level of education was low, with an average of\njust over five years of schooling; less than 11% graduated\nfrom high school. The vast majority (96.1%) was not cur-\nrently employed. Over 89% of the sample reported having\nsome type of medical insurance benefits. The older women\nwere less likely to have insurance coverage than the older\nmen, although the difference was significant only at the\ntrend level. Financial strain was common, with over half of\nTable 1.

About 22%\nlived alone, over 56% lived in two- or three-person house-\nholds, and about 22% lived in households of four or more\npeople. The older women were more likely to live alone\nthan the older men. More than 80% of both men and\nwomen reported having a confidant, and 18% reported hav-\ning had a close friend or relative die in the year prior to the\ninterview.\nSlightly more than half of the respondents had been born\nin the United States, 2.8% had immigrated in the past five\nyears, and 41.9% had immigrated more than five years ago,\nwith no significant differences between men and women.\nMore than half (55.3%) of the respondents reported low\nlevels of acculturation, and almost two thirds (63.5%) re-\nported low assimilation, with older women less likely than\nolder men to report moderate to high acculturation or as-\nsimilation. Regarding health locus of control, older women\nwere more likely to feel they had little control over their\nhealth, whereas older men were more likely to feel they had\na great deal of control.\nAbout 22% of the sample reported having no chronic\nconditions, 27% reported having one condition, and 51%\nreported having two or more conditions. The older women\nwere much more likely than the older men to report having\ntwo or more conditions and much less likely to report hav-\ning no conditions. About 12% of the sample reported need-\ning help with at least one ADL, with little gender variation.\nThe distributions of weighted CES-D scores and preva-\nlence rates for high levels of depressive symptomatology\nare presented in Table 2. The distribution of CES-D scores\nwas significantly skewed (Kolmogorov D = 0.15, p < .01),\nwith a greater proportion of respondents scoring in the\nlower range. The mean CES-D score for the entire sample\nwas 10.5 and the overall prevalence of high levels of\ndepressive symptoms was 25.6%. As noted in the table,\nhowever, these measures varied considerably by socio-\ndemographic, cultural, and health-related characteristics.\nFor example, older women had significantly higher mean\nCES-D scores than older men (12.2 vs 8.3) and almost\nCES-D scores and prevalence rates increased only slightly\nwith age and were significantly higher among the less edu-\ncated. No differences in either CES-D scores or prevalence\nrates were evident for employment status. However, re-\nspondents who reported no form of health insurance cover-\nage were at significantly higher risk for high levels of de-\npressive symptoms, as were respondents who reported\nfinancial strain.\nBoth scores and prevalence rates were significantly higher\namong those who had been married formerly (i.e., di-\nvorced, separated, or widowed) in comparison to those who\nwere currently married or who had never married. Those\nwho lived alone were at a slightly higher risk for high lev-\nels of depressive symptoms. Significantly lower scores and\nprevalence rates were reported by respondents who had a\nconfidant, and significantly higher scores and rates were re-\nTable 2.

Recent immigrants\nwere at particularly high risk, with an average CES-D score\nlow levels of acculturation had substantially higher CES-D\nscores and prevalence rates in relation to those with moder-\nate to high acculturation. Substantial differences in mean\nCES-D scores were not apparent for level of assimilation,\nbut those with low levels of assimilation had substantially\nhigher prevalence rates than those who were moderately or\nhighly assimilated. Substantial differences for both scores\nand prevalence rates were evident for health locus of con-\ntrol, with those feeling less control at significantly higher\nrisk than those feeling more control.\nBoth the mean CES-D scores and the prevalence rates in-\ncreased with the number of reported chronic conditions,\nwith those reporting two or more conditions at significantly\nhigher risk. Similarly, those respondents who reported any\nADL impairments had significantly higher mean CES-D\nscores and higher prevalence rates than those who reported\nno such impairments.\nMultivariate Results\nAn initial logistic regression indicated that female gen-\nder, no insurance coverage, financial strain, and recent im-\nmigration increased the risk for depressive symptoms, as\ndid the number of reported chronic conditions and having\nany ADL impairment. A lower risk was associated with\nhigher education, higher acculturation and assimilation, and\nfeeling greater control over health. With the above predic-\ntors in the equation, age, employment, marital status, living\narrangement, immigrant status, and language of interview\nwere no longer significant.\nImportantly, an interaction between gender and immi-\ngrant status was also found. In order to better understand\nthis phenomenon, we conducted analyses stratified by\ngender. The results of these regressions are presented in\nTable 3. As can be seen in the table, different models were\nderived for men and women. In both genders, financial\nstrain, the number of chronic conditions, and ADL impair-\nment increased the risk for high levels of depressive symp-\ntoms. The direction of the effects of education, no in-\nsurance coverage, low assimilation, and health locus of\ncontrol were the same for both genders, but were much\nstronger predictors among the older women, whereas not\nhaving a confidant and experiencing the death of a close\nfriend or relative were much stronger predictors among\nthe older men.\nInterestingly, nonrecent immigration (more than five\nyears prior to interview) was a stronger predictor in women\nthan in men, and the effects were in opposite directions. As\ncan be seen in Table 3, nonrecent immigrant women were\nat significantly higher risk for high levels of depressive\nsymptoms than women born in the United States (although\nnot as high as among recent immigrant women), whereas\nnonrecent immigrant men were at somewhat less risk than\nthose born in the United States. Individuals who had imrni-\nTable 3.

Prevalence rates\nfor high levels of depressive symptoms were 28.2 among\nthe women born in the U.S., 34.9 among the nonrecent im-\nmigrant women, and 56.6 among the recent immigrant\nwomen. Less dramatic differences were evident among\nolder men, with mean CES-D scores of 8.4 and 7.7 and\nthe U.S. and the nonrecent immigrant men. Among the re-\ncent immigrant men, the mean CES-D score of 15.6 and\nprevalence rate of 58.3 were comparable to those of recent\nimmigrant women.\nAs a result, we were particularly interested in any appar-\nent differences between immigrant and nonimmigrant\nwomen, regarding factors associated with depressive symp-\ntoms. Table 4 presents results of analyses stratified by im-\nmigrant status for the older women. Financial strain and\nchronic health conditions increased the risk for high symp-\ntom levels in both the immigrant and U.S.-born women.\nThe direction of the effects of education, lack of insurance\ncoverage, low assimilation, and ADL impairments were the\nsame for both groups of women, but lack of insurance cov-\nerage and ADL impairment were much stronger predictors\namong the older immigrant women, whereas education,\nlow assimilation, and health locus of control were stronger\npredictors among the U.S.-born women. As noted earlier,\nrecent immigrant women were at higher risk for high levels\nof depressive symptoms. Living arrangements were found\nto have opposite effects in the two groups: living alone was\nassociated with greater risk among the immigrant women\nand lower risk among women born in the United States.\nDISCUSSION\nPrevalence of Depressive Symptomatology\nThe prevalence of depressive symptoms was consider-\nably higher in this study than generally has been reported\nfor older adults in other studies. Table 5 presents the preva-\nlence rates reported in other studies that employed the\nCES-D among community-dwelling older adults.

The rates found in the present study are\nparticularly high, however, in regards to older Mexican\nAmerican men: our rate of 17.3% is considerably higher\nthan the 5.0% reported for older Mexican American men in\nthe Three Generations Study (Mendes de Leon & Markides,\n(Blazer et al., 1991). These differences are also evident in\nthe mean CES-D scores.\nStandard Risk Factors\nMany of the risk factors for depressive symptoms found in\nthe present study are consistent with those identified in previ-\nous studies of older adults, including older Mexican Ameri-\ncans. These include gender (Berkman et al., 1986; Blazer et\n(Callahan, Hui, Nienaber, Musick, & Tierney, 1994), finan-\ncial difficulties (Eaton & Kessler, 1981; Vega, Kolody, &\nWarheit, 1985), living arrangements, not having a confidant,\nand bereavement (Vega, Kolody, Valle, & Hough, 1986). As\nhas been reported for other groups of older adults (Blazer et\nal., 1991), we found no association between age and depres-\nsive symptoms, particularly when controlling for confound-\ning measures such as disability, financial stress, and isolation.\nOur findings regarding marital status were mixed. Simi-\nlar to several other studies (Berkman et al., 1986; Blazer et\nanalyses indicated that disrupted marital status was associ-\nated with greater risk for depressive symptoms in this sam-\nple of older Mexican Americans. In our multivariate analy-\nses, however, the influence of marital status disappeared.\nThis may in part be the result of the comparatively low\nrates of divorce and separation among Mexican Americans.\nHowever, it also suggests that, at least among older Mexi-\ncan Americans, widowhood may not have as strong an ef-\nfect on psychological well-being as has been postulated.\nEducation has been found to have an inverse relationship\nwith depressive symptoms among older adults, with those\nless educated at higher risk (Moscicki et al., 1989; Vega et\nal., 1984). The risk for depressive symptoms among older\nBlacks and Whites was found to be higher among women\nand among the less educated in the previous EPESE sur-\nal., 1985), as well as in other studies of older adults (Calla-\npresent study, a higher level of education was associated\nwith a significantly lower risk for depressive symptoms in\nbivariate analyses. In multivariate analyses, this influence\nremained significant among the older women with 12 or\nmore years of education, but disappeared among the older\nmen. This may be the result of generally very low levels of\neducation in this group of older Mexican Americans.\nCurrent employment has also generally been found to\nhave a protective effect (Mendes de Leon & Markides,\nsent study. This may be the result of so few of the older\nMexican Americans being currently employed.\nThe influence of chronic conditions and functional im-\npairment on psychological distress found in this sample of\nolder Mexican Americans is also consistent with that found\namong the older population in general (Berkman et al.,\nother studies of older Mexican Americans (Lewinsohn,\nHoberman, & Rosenbaum, 1988; Palinkas, Wingard, &\nCultural Risk Factors\nOur findings both support and contrast other reports re-\ngarding the influence of cultural factors on depressive\nsymptomatology. Our finding that low acculturation is asso-\nciated with higher risk for depressive symptoms is consis-\ntent with other literature (Griffin, 1983; Masten, Penland, &\nthat the stress of acculturation is a primary factor in adjust-\nment problems among immigrants. Several investigators\nhave found increased risk among respondents who con-\nducted interviews in Spanish (Garcia & Marks, 1989; Vega\net al., 1985). In the Hispanic HANES, however, Moscicki\net al. (1989) found no significant difference among Mexi-\ncan Americans according to language of interview, al-\nthough they did find higher rates of depression among those\nCubans and Puerto Ricans who responded in Spanish.\nOf particular note is our finding that immigrant women\nand recent immigrants of both genders are at greater risk\nfor depressive symptomatology than their U.S.-born coun-\nterparts. With the exception of recent immigrants, older\nimmigrant men were at lower risk than their U.S.-born\ncounterparts. In contrast, Moscicki et al. (1989) found non-\nimmigrants of both genders to report higher levels of psy-\nchological distress. Similarly, Golding and Burnam (1990)\nfound Mexican immigrants had lower depression scores\nthan Mexican Americans born in the United States.\nThese results indicate that somewhat different phenom-\nena are occurring in the older women and the older men.\nLack of insurance coverage, low levels of health locus of\ncontrol, and immigrant status had more deleterious effects\namong the older women. In contrast, recent immigration\nand bereavement had much stronger negative effects among\nthe older men, while having a confidant and nonrecent im-\nmigrant status had more protective effects. These findings\nindicate that migration selection, often cited as a reason for\nbetter physical health among immigrants (Moscicki et al.,\n1989), may have a less protective influence among women\nthan men. It may be that earlier immigrants, primarily men,\nimmigrated to the United States for employment opportuni-\nties, and thus were healthier. More recent immigrants, pri-\nmarily women, would be more likely to have immigrated to\nbe with adult children, and thus would be less likely to evi-\ndence any healthy immigrant effect. Similarly, older men\nwho had recently immigrated would be less likely to evi-\ndence a healthy immigrant effect.\nThe differences in immigration experiences suggested by\nour findings also help to identify the specific factors associ-\nated with increased risk for depressive symptoms among\nthe older women. We found that lack of insurance coverage\nand ADL impairment had particularly negative effects\namong the immigrant women, whereas they had little effect\namong the women born in the United States. Recent immi-\ngration also had a negative effect among the immigrant\nwomen. Health locus of control had a much stronger effect\namong the U.S.-born women, whereas having a confidant\nhad a more protective effect among the immigrant women.\nLiving alone decreased the risk among U.S.-born women,\nwhereas it increased the risk for immigrant women.\nThese findings suggest that the process of acculturation\nand assimilation may be more stressful for immigrant\nwomen than men. In addition to immigrating at later ages\nand for different reasons, immigrant women may be more\nlikely to be caught between two cultures. Two salient fea-\ntures of the Mexican American culture are familism,\nwherein the central core of life is the family, and \"marian-\nism,\" by which women are expected to be submissive,\ndocile, and sentimental, with specific role expectations\n(Paniagua, 1994). Traditionally, Mexican American women\nare the keepers of culture; they are expected to maintain\nfamily and cultural traditions, passing on practices to chil-\ndren and acting as the central force of family concerns.\nMen, in contrast, are often expected to do whatever is nec-\nessary to provide for the family. As a result, acculturation\nmay be more sanctioned for men than for women, or, at the\nvery least, there may be greater expectations for women to\nmaintain the traditional culture while functioning in the\nnew culture.\nAnother salient feature of Mexican American culture is\nfatalism, the belief that individuals cannot control or pre-\nvent adverse events if they are the will of God (Paniagua,\n1994). In the present study, we found a low sense of health\nlocus of control was associated with increased risk for de-\npressive symptoms, both in bivariate and multivariate anal-\nyses. This may, in part, be reflective of the effects of fatal-\nism in this cultural group, in that individuals who were\nmore fatalistic might have felt less control over their health\nthrough their own actions. It also may be related in part to\nthe predominantly low rates of acculturation seen in this\ngroup. Szapocznik and Kurtines (1980) postulated that\nthose who are underacculturated lack the necessary flexibil-\nity to cope with the psychological demands of cultural assim-\nilation. This may be the case especially among immigrant\nwomen and recent immigrants of both genders, individuals\nwho may be more poorly acculturated, more socially iso-\nlated, less educated, and more economically marginal than\ntheir counterparts who are better assimilated into main-\nstream American culture.\nImmigrants may suffer the effects of added stress from a\nvariety of sources. For example, it has been postulated that\nthe disruption of social support systems experienced by the\nimmigrants may be particularly stressful (Vega et al, 1986).\nIndeed, we found that among the immigrant women those\nwith greater household sizes were at less risk than those\nwho lived alone or with one other person. Another issue in-\nvolves the legal status of these individuals. Although we\ndid not assess legal status in the present study, we are aware\nthat many older Mexican Americans may be undocumented\naliens, which can add stress and insecurity to the already\ndifficult processes of immigration and assimilation.\nPossible Explanations for Increased Prevalence\nof Depressive Symptoms\nIn summary, the findings of the present study suggest a\nsubstantially elevated risk for depressive symptoms among\nolder Mexican Americans. Risk factors such as gender, lack\nof insurance coverage, financial strain, absence of a confi-\ndant, bereavement, number of chronic health conditions,\nand functional impairment were as predictive among this\ngroup as they are among older adults in general. It is not\nclear, however, if the elevated rates can be adequately ex-\nplained by these traditional risk factors. Indeed, evidence\ndoes not suggest that the sociodemographic risk factors\nfunction any differently in this group than in other groups\nof older adults. It is more likely that the elevated risks are\nrelated to a greater prevalence of these traditional risk fac-\ntors coupled with cultural factors. For example, part of the\nincreased risk found in the present study may be explained\nby the overall level of education of the older Mexican\nAmericans, which is lower compared with that of other\ngroups. Similarly, the greater proportions of older Mexican\nAmericans reporting a lack of insurance coverage and fi-\nnancial strain may also add to the increased prevalence. Im-\nmigrant status appears to be particularly influential among\nrecent immigrants and among older women. It does not ex-\nplain the higher rates reported by the older men, however.\nCan the higher rates of depression be explained in terms\nof chronic conditions and associated functional impair-\nment? Evidence indicates that older Mexican Americans\nmay have fewer chronic conditions than older non-Hispanic\nWhites or African Americans (Berkman et al., 1986; Ken-\nnedy et al., 1989) but higher rates of functional impairment\n(Markides et al., 1996). This suggests that the critical factor\nmay not be the number of medical conditions but, rather,\nthe nature of the conditions reported and their impact on the\nlives of those afflicted. A large portion of the variability\nmay be explained by examining the contributions of spe-\ncific chronic medical disorders that are associated more\ncommonly with depression, particularly those that are asso-\nciated strongly with functional declines. These include\narthritis, cancer, thyroid disease, stroke, diabetes, and car-\ndiovascular disease (Finch, Ramsay, & Katona, 1992; Gold-\nlarly prevalent among older Mexican Americans. For exam-\nple, research over the past decade has increasingly demon-\nstrated that adult-onset diabetes mellitus, a disease that is\nboth highly prevalent among Mexican Americans and asso-\nciated with substantial functional disabilities, is associated\nmore strongly with depression than many other chronic\nconditions, particularly among older adults (Gavard, Lust-\nman, & Clouse, 1993; Wing, Marcus, Blair, Epstein, &\nBurton, 1990). Weyerer, Hewer, Pfeifer-Kurdo, and Dilling\n(1989), for example, reported the prevalence of depression\nto be 27.3% among older diabetics, compared with a rate of\namong older adults suffering from other chronic diseases.\nAmong the 22% of respondents in the present study who\nreported a physician's diagnosis of diabetes, over 31% had\nhigh rates of depressive symptoms. This compares with\nabout 26% of those with other chronic conditions and about\n18% of those who reported having no chronic conditions.\nOur findings highlight both similarities and differences\nbetween older Mexican Americans and other ethnic groups\nof older adults in the United States. These findings are lim-\nited, however, in two important ways. First, although the\nmeasure of depressive symptoms used in this study, the\nCES-D, is the most frequently used measure of psychologi-\ncal distress in surveys of older community-dwelling adults,\nit is only moderately correlated with the clinical syndrome\nof depression (as delineated in the DSM-IV; American Psy-\nchiatric Association, 1994). Indeed, research has indicated\nthat, compared with clinical diagnostic measures, symptom\nscales may overestimate the prevalence of depression be-\ncause they include the sequelae of age-related physical dis-\norders and increased somatic symptoms, such as sleep\nor appetite disturbance (Berry, Storandt, & Coyne, 1984;\nevant for older Mexican Americans, who may be more\nlikely to express psychological problems with somatic\nsymptoms (Angel & Angel, 1995). Thus, it may not be ap-\npropriate to generalize the results for psychological distress\ninto depression as a clinical disorder. Further research is\nneeded to examine potential risk factors using a diagnosis\nof depressive disorder as the measure of outcome. Despite\nthis limitation, however, the present results are an important\naddition to the understanding of depression, albeit subsyn-\ndromal depression, among older adults, a phenomenon con-\nsidered common but poorly understood (Blazer et al., 1987;\nA more important limitation is that the data presented in\nthis article are cross-sectional and cannot adequately reflect\nlongitudinal relationships between physical illness or func-\ntional disabilities and depressive symptoms in older Mexi-\ncan Americans. An important question remains as to\nwhether depressive symptoms are the result of physical\nhealth problems, whether physical illness and disability are\nin part the result of psychological distress, or whether both\nprocesses are operating concurrently, as has been suggested\nThese limitations raise another important concern: Does\nthe elevated risk for depressive symptoms indicate an actual\nincrease in the prevalence of depression or does it reflect\nsome sociocultural differences not directly related to psy-\nchological distress? This has not been supported either by\nthe reports of clinicians or by studies that have employed\ndiagnostic criteria, such as the Diagnostic Interview Sched-\nule (DIS), which have suggested that the prevalence of de-\npression in older Mexican American adults is the same or\nless than that of other older Americans (Vernon & Roberts,\n1982). Data from the Hispanic HANES (Moscicki et al.,\n1989) indicate that older Mexican Americans have lower\nrates of major depression than other groups of older adults.\nSimilarly, data from the Epidemiologic Catchment Area\n(ECA; Karno et al., 1987) studies indicate no greater risk\nfor depression (as defined by the DIS) among older Mexi-\ncan Americans than among older African Americans or\nnon-Hispanic Whites.\nThe ECA data did, however, demonstrate that Mexican\nAmerican women over the age of 40 were at greater risk for\ndysthymia, a less severe yet more chronic depressive disor-\nder (Karno et al., 1987). Recent literature has also docu-\nmented an increased sociocultural acceptance among Mexi-\ncan Americans to express psychological stress through\nsomatic symptoms (Canino et al., 1992; Katon, Kleinman,\nthe increased prevalence of sociodemographic risk factors\nand the possible effects of the specific chronic medical con-\nditions most prevalent in this group, it appears likely that\nthe increased burden of psychological distress among older\nMexican Americans is real. We hope to better address these\nissues with longitudinal analyses of the second wave of\nHispanic EPESE data.\nThe findings of this study are important for a number of\nreasons. For clinicians and policy makers, our results iden-\ntify similarities and differences between older Mexican\nAmericans and older adults in general. Our findings of\nhigher rates of depressive symptoms among older Mexican\nAmericans have substantial implications for the detection\nand treatment of mental health in this population. More im-\nportantly, however, our findings illustrate the complexity of\ninfluences on both mental and physical health in older\nadults, many of which can be modified. Addressing this\ncomplexity benefits not only older Mexican Americans but\nsociety as a whole.\n"
