Dual health care\nsystem use (dual use) occurs when Veterans Health Administration (VA) enrollees also receive care from non-VA sources.\nMounting evidence suggests that dual use decreases efficiency and patient safety. This qualitative study used constructivist\ngrounded theory and content analysis to examine decision making among 25 Veterans with HF, for similarities and differences\nbetween all-VA users and dual users. In general, all-VA users praised specific VA providers, called services helpful, and\nexpressed positive capacity for managing HF. In addition, several Veterans who described inadvertent one-time non-VA\nhealth care utilization in emergent situations more closely mirrored all-VA users. By contrast, committed dual users more\noften reported unmet needs, nonresponse to VA requests, and faster services in non-VA facilities. However, a primary\ntrigger for dual use was VA telephone referral for escalating symptoms, instead of care coordination or primary/specialty\ncare problem-solving.\n",

For example, almost 20% of Medicare\npatients rehospitalized within 30 days after an HF hospital\nadmission are admitted to different facilities on their second\nstay.17 Thus, the decisions patients make regarding when and\nwhere to receive acute care for chronic conditions such as\nHF can have a significant impact on their subsequent health\ncare utilization and outcomes.\nWithin the Veteran Health Administration (VA), dual use\noccurs when patients receive care from multiple providers or\nhealth care facilities as well as the VA. Dual use is particu-\nlarly common in the VA health system where a majority of\nhospitalizations for cardiovascular disorders among older\nVeterans occur at non-VA facilities.18 Compared with\nVA-only users of acute care, Veterans with HF who were\ndual users had 15% higher adjusted rates of ED visits, 40%\n1Ralph H.

In addition, though there are a few studies of\ndual use of VA and non-VA health services by Veterans with\nHF, we could locate none from the Veteran's perspective.22\nAlthough a limited sample (n = 25), this exploratory, descrip-\ntive qualitative study compares the perspectives of Veterans\nwho used only VAcare, Veterans who described an unplanned\nuse of non-VA service in a single emergency, and Veterans\nwho identified as usual dual users. The patterns that appeared\nwithin the dual user group compared with the other 2 groups\nsuggest specific descriptive evidence for the design and test-\ning of future interventions, a potentially relevant pattern that\nmay contribute to more patient-centered HF interventions to\nimprove VA health services.\nMethods\nMost studies of dual use to date have analyzed secondary\ndata to establish patterns of health care utilization and to\nmeasure health care outcomes.23-28 However, much less is\nknown regarding the subjective factors leading Veterans to\nseek care across health care systems. To better understand\ncare seeking decisions among Veterans with HF and to\nexplore differences in decision making between single and\ndual system users, we conducted a qualitative study of\nVeterans with HF at 2 VA medical centers. This study drew\nfrom both conventional qualitative content analysis and con-\nstructivist grounded theory to explore perceived similarities\nand differences between Veterans who had single and dual\nuse of VA and non-VA services as broadly as possible.29,30\nRather than apply a preestablished theoretical framework,\ngrounded theory supplies a logic of data collection, constant\ncomparison of developing concepts, and reflective analysis\nthat generates an emerging framework in its final results.31\nSeparate coders applied the 2 primary qualitative methods\nand negotiated a consensus between content analysis and\ngrounded theory\u00adbased findings, using the computer-assisted\nqualitative content analysis program and Web-based corpus\nanalysis tool Wmatrix for triangulation.32\nStudy Data and Interpretation\nSelection of Participants\nVeteran subjects for this analysis were recruited from VA\nMedical Centers in the southern United States. Beginning in\nMay 2014, approved by the VA Central Institutional Review\nBoard (CIRB), we created a purposive sample of subjects\nidentified through 3 mechanisms: (1) review of existing\npatient registries of those previously receiving care for\nchronic HF, (2) review of inpatient census documents for\npatients hospitalized with HF, and (3) posting advertisements\nin patient care areas of our facilities. Potentially eligible\npatients lived in specific geographic regions, had a diagnosis\nof HF, and had received treatment within the preceding year.\nThey were mailed a letter of recruitment or approached in\ninpatient settings (after an introduction facilitated by clinical\nstaff). Individuals responding with interest to these recruit-\nment efforts were contacted by a study team member who\nscreened subjects for eligibility to participate by reviewing\nquestions related to inclusion/exclusion criteria. Subjects\nwith limited English proficiency or who were unable to pro-\nvide individual informed consent were excluded from par-\nticipation in semistructured interviews, as they would likely\nbe unable to complete study procedures. Subsequently, con-\nsenting participants were scheduled for interviews conducted\nin person or via telephone.\nSemistructured Interviews\nInterviews were developed using constructivist grounded\ntheory.30 After obtaining basic demographic information,\nopen-ended questions explored how Veterans perceived their\nheart condition, how they managed HF, what influenced their\ndecision to seek emergency assistance, and how they made\nthe choice to use VA- versus non-VA services, based on a\nstandard interview guide shown in Table 1. Two interviewers\nwith previous experience in qualitative studies conducted\nsemistructured interviews lasting 30 to 60 minutes, using\nprinciples of qualitative interviewing. Interviews were digi-\ntally recorded, transcribed, and entered into NVivo Version\nQualitative Analyses\nTwo coders planned parallel coding for the broadest per-\nspective possible, using separate approaches to coding in a\nfirst pass, and then negotiated and refined codes in a pro-\ncess of consensus coding.35 The first coder used classic\nqualitative content analysis to explore the text from a\nhealth services perspective by selecting codes deductively\nin response to the research question, pretesting codes on a\nfew transcribed interviews, applying the codes completely,\nand creating a case by case variable matrix from emerging\ncategories.36 Using a more inductive approach, the second\ncoder used constructivist grounded theory, reexamining\nlanguage for specific views, values, what actions were rep-\nresented, relationships implied, positions taken, and what\nTranscriptions were coded line by line, grouped into cat-\negories, and subsequently examined for emerging themes\nusing constant comparison. Veterans were initially sorted\ninto single- versus dual-users of services for purposes of\nanalysis. During analysis, it became evident that a sizable\nPope et al 3\nnumber of Veterans initially categorized as dual-users had\ninstead accessed non-VA services only during a critical inci-\ndent and then returned to acting as VA single-users for fol-\nlow-up care by preference.\nComputer-Assisted Qualitative Content Analysis\nAs an additional point of comparison for triangulation, a\nthird coder, an applied linguist, used an online linguistics-\nbased tool, Wmatrix, to compare computer-assisted qualita-\ntive content analysis and grounded theory findings of the\ntexts, with quantitative comparison of language patterns\nbetween the 2 sets of health service research coders. Wmatrix\nhelped identify significant conceptual themes, commonali-\nties, and differences suggested by word use as a complemen-\ntary analysis to the consensus reached by the initial content\nanalysis and grounded theory coding. Wmatrix tags every\nword in a text by its part of speech and also its semantic cat-\negory and measures their frequencies of use for compari-\nsons.32 In comparing language used by single- versus\ndual-users, Wmatrix provides a means to apply log-likeli-\nhood analysis to identify statistically significant keywords\nand key semantic fields (such as Time or Emotion). The\nidentification of significant keywords and semantic fields is\ncomplementary to the analysis of themes identified by con-\ntent analysis and grounded theory, refining their identifica-\ntion and reducing potential investigator bias.\nStudy Results\nSample Characteristics\nAs depicted in Table 2, our sample consisted of 25 predomi-\nnantly non-Hispanic black and non-Hispanic white male\nTable 1.

ED = emergency department; VA = Veterans Health Administration.\nTable 2. Subject Characteristics.\nCharacteristic Interview subjects\nGender, n (%)\nRace/ethnicity, n (%)\nAge range, n (%)\nDual use category\n Only Veterans Health\nAdministration Users\nVeterans aged 51 to 88 years. Nine subjects were only VA\nusers, six were committed dual users, and 10 were inadver-\ntent one-time dual users.\nFindings From Grounded Theory Analysis\nIn reviewing all interviews, we noticed that participants in all\ngroups exhibited low levels of engagement with their pri-\nmary care providers for problem solving, which can contrib-\nute to increased use of the ED for symptom management in\ngeneral and during the early stages of an exacerbation.\nSymptom escalation was often not perceived as recognized\nby Veterans. Self-management was clearly a concern, as\nshown in the patterns we identified for consistent only-VA\nusers, consistent dual users, and inadvertent one-time dual\nusers. This last category of Veterans, inadvertent dual users,\noften sought care in response to a critical incident. They\ndescribed being pressured by family or from a member of\ntheir social network to seek care at the closest available facil-\nity for rising symptoms, fear, or a feeling of being over-\nwhelmed. Several were taken to non-VA facilities by the\nemergency medical service they contacted for transportation.\nOften patients had not called VA Primary Care for consulta-\ntion about emerging symptoms, a consistent pattern across\nusers, but waited until the ED was the necessary choice.\nTable 3 exemplifies precipitating factors leading Veterans in\nall 3 categories to seek care.\nBoth the exclusively single users and inadvertent one-\ntime dual users had specific reasons for selecting VA care,\nkeyed to its perceived quality, as shown in Table 4. Although\noften concerned about delays with specialty care, they were\nless concerned about wait-time for general VA services.\nConsistent dual users who planned to remain in that cate-\ngory reported that they had their own insurance and did not\nfeel limited to either the VA or to the closest available medi-\ncal care. Like single and inadvertent one-time users, they\nwaited until escalating symptoms, such as lack of breath,\ncaused them to seek care, and displayed little personal\nagency, being content to go wherever an ambulance, family\nmember, or friend took them. They were more likely to cite\nlack of access to VA primary care and difficulty scheduling\nas main reasons for choosing non-VA care, keyed to frustra-\ntion with access to services, as shown in Table 4.\nFindings From Computer-Assisted Content\nAnalysis\nUsing Wmatrix for triangulation, semantic fields identified\nfor both single and dual users shared many similarities, as\nmembers of each group were being asked similar questions.\nIn both groups, word usage falls into identical conceptual or\nsemantic clusters keyed to identity in the interview questions.\nThese conceptual clusters included comparisons of hospitals\nand their staffs, listing of symptoms leading to hospitaliza-\ntion, reports on what clinicians had told them, descriptions\ncontrasting ease or difficulty in gaining admission to medical\ntreatment, listing of chronic conditions including HF, how the\nheart condition escalated, highlights in the Veteran's heart\ndisease story, and evaluation of the hospitals and their care.\nDual-users' words were significantly more likely to fall\ninto the category for Evaluation. To further examine the cat-\negory of Evaluation, we extracted the answers by all 25\nVeterans to the question, \"Can you describe the quality of\ncare you received\" and compared those against the full text\nof all of the interviews. That comparison underscored that\nspeakers were inclined to report what others said about their\ncondition, and had strong concerns about getting appoint-\nments and being seen in a timely fashion. For the 50 words\nidentified as semantically evaluative in the responses to\nQuality of Care, we noted that Okay was used to close a\nquestion-answer sequence, Well was used to open a topic or\nto signal slight hesitation before giving an opinion, but the\nother words characterized the quality of care as being of high\nvalue. Interestingly, Veterans who were dissatisfied with the\nVA did not use words such as Poor; instead, they launched\nimmediately into uninterrupted monologues on one of 3 con-\nceptual themes: the difficulty of obtaining appointments, of\ngetting clear answers, or being seen within a time they saw as\nreasonable. Overall, the theme of symptom escalation\nemerged as a precipitating factor that triggered ED use, yet\nhad a described trajectory open to intervention. However, the\nVeterans'statements suggest a lack of recognition or response\nearly in the symptom cycle.\nThe theme of symptom escalation emerged as a precipitat-\ning factor that triggered ED use (as seen in Table 3), yet had a\ndescribed trajectory open to earlier problem solving or inter-\nvention. However, the Veterans' statements suggest a lack of\nrecognition or willingness to respond early in the cycle.\nI started sweating at night, I mean, a whole lot of sweat. And I\ngot kind of skeptical, but then the sweating and then it started\nturning into that real bad feeling.\nThis typical example suggests a process that was noticed,\nreflected upon, escalated, but not acted upon until the final\n\"bad feeling,\" without primary care consultation. Another\ndimension of this decision-making process reflects a lack of\ncare coordination within the multiple services often needed\nfor persons with HF, reflected in this example in which the\nphysician in the primary care clinic goes unmentioned or\nmistakenly identified as one of many specialists.\nInterviewer: \"Did you go to your primary care doctor or\nheart specialist before or after your emergency depart-\nment visit?\"\nVeteran: \"Well, the emergency department, they admitted\nme into the hospital and then the heart specialist came\nby and determined that's what it was and that I didn't\nneed any special treatment or medication . . . Well, my\nprimary care doctor is in nephrology, so I very seldom\nPope et al 5\nsee him. I see him once a month maybe when he makes\nhis rounds up in the dialysis unit. Every decision I\nmake I make it on my own because I've really never\nbeen to see a heart specialist. You understand? You\nknow, they make appointments, they do an EKG and\nhe looks at it and that's it. As far as sitting down and\ntalking and explaining to me exactly what the problem\nis or what may have caused it, no, I never got that\ninformation.\"\nAnother theme that affected choice of care across the 3\ngroups was related to accessing care, especially through the\nVA Telephone Advice Program (TAP), the patient informa-\ntion service available at all VA medical centers 24 hours a\nday. Though committed dual users expressed some frustra-\ntion, study participants in the other 2 groups referred to TAP\nrarely.\nOthers portrayed that some VA telephone access had\nimproved.\nTable 4. Reasons for Choosing Care in Only-VA Users and Inadvertent One-Time Dual Users Versus Consistent Dual Users.\nTheme Representative quote\nVA-only and one-time dual users\n Quality overall: overall\nsatisfaction with quality of care\nThe doctor comes out there and she sees me and she knows I have an appointment. \"Come\non.\" Can I do that with anybody else? No. I'm very pleased with the service that I get for my\nheart . . . I would not change it for any other hospital.\n Quality as equity: perceived\nequity as part of quality of care\nWell, I mean, they go right to work on you. They just handle you very professionally. There's\nno color, creed or what have you. They handle you as a patient.\n Quality in decisions: decision\nto choose VA based on quality\nof care\nRight now the reason for my decision to come to the VA is because I just overall get better\nservice. When I come to the VA, I feel that if I'm in a detrimental situation, I'll be seen.\nGoing to the private emergency room, they don't get to you that quickly.\n Quality as information: better\ncommunication with often\nnamed providers and can echo\ndirectives or explanations\nThe heart specialist and my diabetic specialist, nurses and doctors and all them made me\nextremely aware over the last four years of what I had to be aware of, the symptoms and\nwhen I need to get in here to the doctor. Weight gain, fast weight gain is another symptom\nof retaining fluid around my heart.\n Quality as replacing insurance\nconcerns\nMoney. I couldn't afford the outside insurance. Me and my wife, we spend over $1000 a\nmonth, and I couldn't afford that . . .\nDual users\n Lack of access to primary care I'm tired. I use the emergency room for my primary care physician, but that's not right. That's\nthe only way I can get to see a doctor is go to the emergency room. You go down there and\nyou sit and somebody says, \"What are you in here for today?\"\nAnd the other thing is the TAP [Telephone Advice Program] number or the nurse? The help\nfor after hours? It doesn't matter what you say to them, when you're done they say, \"Go to\nthe emergency room.\"\n Scheduling problems I can't get an appointment. I had an appointment August 20th, believe it or not, made back in\nApril, I think. But August 20th, that's how far ahead I had to go. But then I got a call Friday\ncancelling that. I said, \"Where's he going to be?\" \"He's out of town.\" And she said, \"When\ndo you want to come back?\" I said, \"I do not give a damn. Send me a letter, whatever you\nwant to,\" and hung up.\nNote. VA = Veterans Health Administration.\nTable 3. Factors Precipitating Veterans' Decisions to Seek Heart Failure Care.\nThemes of decision making Representative quote\nSymptom escalation: sweating So after I started to have that real bad feeling and sweating because, I mean, I'd wake up soaking\nwet, and that's when I called the VA. From the sweating, and then when I got to feeling real bad,\nthey got an 800 number to call the nurse, and I called them and explained to them what's going on.\nSymptom escalation: breathing That's more or less I just couldn't breathe. I couldn't catch my breath. I was just sitting there in the\nbed and I went to go use the bathroom. I came and sat down on the bed. I just couldn't catch my\nbreath and I didn't know what was going on. That was when it first happened.\nSymptom escalation: choices\ndriven by providers\nI didn't decide. The doctor in California decided, sent me to a VA after they found out that I was\na Veteran. They decided to send me to a VA for better service and a cheaper service, and it was\ndone for me. I did not decide because I had no idea of ever being sick.\nNote. VA = Veterans Health Administration.\nThe other thing I'm finding is that it used to be you'd wait an\nhour or so on the phone to talk to somebody at the VA. You don't\nhave that wait period right now, which is a bit better. Nobody\nminds waiting 10 or 15 minutes, but you wait an hour, hour and\na half to talk to somebody, that's . . . a bit much.\nDiscussion\nIn this article, we have presented findings from a qualitative\nstudy of decision making regarding care seeking among\nVeterans with HF. By using complementary approaches to\nanalysis and interpretation, we identified key words, key\nthemes, and prevalent discourse patterns. Not surprisingly,\ndual users chose negative words (including taboo words) to\ndescribe their experience, keyed primarily to a lack of satis-\nfaction with delays in service, and resistance to being consis-\ntently sent to the ED when calling with a problem. They\napparently had impersonal relations with providers, tending\nnot to know their names. Feeling that quality of care was low,\nand having insurance of their own, they consistently chose\ncare outside the VA whenever it was available or as more\nconvenient geographically. Dual users were more likely to\ncriticize the VA Telephone Advice Program known as the\nTAP line for providing nurses who invariably sent them to\nemergency care and were highly dissatisfied with not getting\nwhat they saw as clear answers. Single users tended to have\nno private medical insurance, and though sometimes irritated\nby consistent delays in getting appointments and receiving\ncare, they felt that the care they received was well-worth it,\neven \"wonderful\" on occasion, primarily because of strong\nrelationships with providers, whom they named and enjoyed\nseeing. They largely felt that providers gave clear answers,\nsaw them as individual persons of importance, and were pre-\npared to provide care for them.\nMany of our findings echo key themes identified in other\nstudies of care seeking decisions in HF patients.37,38 Many of\nour patients described confusion in interpreting symptoms or\ntheir severity until emergent care was necessary, a finding\ndescribed previously.39-41 Separate reports also describe\navoidance-based coping, fear of hospitals, fear of being a\nburden, and depression as additional barriers to timely care\nseeking in HF.37,42 As modeled by only-VA users in our sam-\nple, healthy engagement in primary care has also been\ndescribed previously as a positive factor in promoting HF\nself-management.43 Although much of the qualitative litera-\nture to date focuses on factors associated with decisions to\nseek care and delays in care seeking, our study focused on\nthe slightly narrower question of choice of care setting.\nHowever, to the extent that dual use is a marker of increased\nneed for health care services, it is beneficial to better under-\nstand these discrete decisions.\nCounter to a priori expectations, we discovered that\npatients fell into 3 distinct groups rather than 2 groups. In\naddition to consistent dual-users and only-VA users, we\nobserved multiple patients to be inadvertent one-time dual\nusers. This third group typically responded to questions in\nthe same manner as the only-VA group but had exposure to\nnon-VA health care during times of acute HF exacerbation.\nThe implications of this health care utilization pattern are as\nyet unclear, as compared with the other 2 groups. Yet the\ninadvertent one-time dual users presented opportunities for\ncare coordination that could conceivably decrease avoidable\nED use, a potential hypothesis for testing. Most studies of\ndual health care system used to date that examine secondary\ndata have focused on categorical (yes/no) definitions of dual\nuse. Our qualitative observations indicate that there may be\nimportant experiential and motivational differences between\nconsistent dual users and inadvertent dual users, which could\nimpact outcomes of care as well as potential interventions.\nThis hypothesis will need further analysis and exploration\nusing quantitative methods.\nThis study should be interpreted in light of certain limita-\ntions. Grounded theory methods consist of systematic guide-\nlines for iteratively collecting and analyzing qualitative data\nto construct theories from interview data that are exploratory\nin nature.30 This study involved interviews from 25 predomi-\nnantly male Veterans from 2 VA medical centers. While our\nsample was adequate to achieve thematic saturation, extrapo-\nlation of our findings to other VA medical centers or to\nfemale Veterans should be done with caution. Other than\ngrouping patients based on their dual use status, we did not\nmake any attempts to assess clinical outcomes for patients in\nour sample. Thus, we cannot comment on the impact of dual\nuse or single system use on quality of care or outcomes for\nthese participants. Separately, our research team is also per-\nforming quantitative dual use analyses on a cohort of over 13\n000 Veterans with HF, and these analyses should comple-\nment our qualitative findings.19\nIn closing, this qualitative study sheds new light on fac-\ntors affecting decision making in Veterans with HF regarding\nthe VA system of health care. These findings are timely given\nthe Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act (VACA)\nand increased dual use among Veterans entitled.44 Further\nstudy regarding the implications of inadvertent dual system\nuse seems warranted. Future interventions to improve symp-\ntom recognition in HF, early and effective triage during exac-\nerbation, and effective primary care engagement may enable\ndecreased dual use in situations that may be less effective for\nVeterans as well as decrease preventable ED visits while\nmanaging HF.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This\nstudy was supported by VA Health Services Research and\nPope et al 7\nReferences\n1.
