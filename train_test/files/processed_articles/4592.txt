    "abstract": "Abstract\nObjective: The primary aim of this study was to determine the effect of age, femoral head\nmigration, and ambulatory status on radiographic outcomes after combined pelvic and femoral\nreconstruction in children with cerebral palsy. The secondary aim was to evaluate the fate of the\nopposite hip after unilateral reconstruction.\nMethods: A retrospective cohort study design of consecutive patients from 1995\u00ad2009 was used.\nThe records were screened for patients who underwent varus derotational osteotomy and\nmodified Dega osteotomy.\nResults: Eighty-five hips in 71 patients were included. The mean age was 8.4 \u00c6 3.2 years and the\nmean follow-up was 6.6 \u00c6 3.1 years. The final measures were a mean migration index of\nvalues were not correlated with age and the initial migration index. Nonambulatory status did not\nnegatively affect hip stability. Final measurements of the contralateral hips were similar to the\nreconstructed hips, and the cumulative incidence for later reconstruction was 5.67%.\nConclusions: Regardless of age, preoperative displacement, and ambulation, the combined\nprocedure provides durable radiographic improvement. In unilateral cases, there is a low risk of\nlater deterioration of the opposite side.\n",

There is less controversy regarding\nthe indications for lengthening of contracted\nadductor muscles and the iliopsoas tendon\nto relieve the deforming forces. The main\nindication for varus derotational osteotomy\n(VDRO) is a migration index (MI) greater\nsuggested that the ``golden age'' for inter-\nvention is between 4 and 8 years for minimal\nvarus remodelling and this has good poten-\ntial for acetabular remodelling.11 Later\nreports noted more recurrence of hip dis-\nplacement in patients aged younger than 4\nyears.12,13 Pelvic osteotomies have been\nadded to VDRO to address acetabular dys-\nplasia and resubluxation in a staged fash-\nion.14,15 Additionally, other authors have\nrecommended single-staged combined pro-\ncedures that include pelvic osteotomy with\nVDRO.9,16 Besides a younger age, several\nreports have indicated that a high initial\nmigration index and poor preoperative\nmobility are detrimental to the longevity of\ncorrection.17\u00ad19Moreover, recent studies\nsuggested a lower threshold for intervening\non the opposite side in this patient\nTherefore, this study aimed to evaluate\nradiographic parameters after VDRO com-\nbined with modified Dega osteotomy in\nchildren with cerebral palsy, taking into\naccount age, femoral head migration, and\nambulatory status. The secondary objective\nof this study was to examine progression of\nthe opposite hip after unilateral\nreconstruction.\nPatients and methods\nSelection of patients\nThe institutional review board of the\nResearch Institute of the McGill University\nHealth Centre approved the study (Study\nspective review of consecutive patients who\nunderwent a single-staged VDRO and mod-\nified Dega osteotomy at Montreal\nChildren's Hospital and Montreal Shriners\nThe inclusion criteria were hip displace-\nment due to cerebral palsy, combined single-\nstaged surgery, open triradiate cartilage,\nabsence of previous osseous intervention\naround the hip, and a minimum follow-up\nof 2 years.\nClinical parameters\nThe charts were reviewed for age, sex, side of\nsurgery, and the need for open reduction.\nWe also collected data related to the type of\ncerebral palsy, as well as GMFCS level.\nGMFCS levels II\u00adIII were called ambula-\ntory and levels IV and V were nonambula-\ntory. Postoperative adverse events were\nreviewed, as well as any additional surgical\ntreatments. For observation of the contra-\nlateral hip, we noted subsequent interven-\ntions and whether they were planned from\nthe beginning or whether the decision was\nmade later, based on radiographic progres-\nsion of the subluxation.\nRadiographic measurements\nPre- and postoperative supine frontal pelvic\nradiographs were reviewed for the standard\nMI as described by Reimers.8 Pelvic obli-\nquity (PO), which was the angle between the\nacetabular tear drops and the horizontal\nreference frame, was recorded from the\ninitial radiographs.23 Final radiographs\nwere examined for the MI, centre edge\nangle (CEA), Sharp's angle, PO, the\npresence of heterotopic ossification, and\navascular necrosis (AVN). We also applied\nthe Melbourne Cerebral Palsy Hip\nClassification System (MCPHCS) to the\nfinal follow-up radiographs. This system is\na reliable, six-grade, ordinal scale.24,25\nFor the opposite side, the preoperative,\npostoperative, and follow-up MI, as well as\nthe follow-up Sharp's angle and CEA, were\nrecorded. We also documented if the patient\nhad spinal instrumentation. All of the meas-\nurements were carried out by the first\nauthor.\nSurgical procedure\nThe indications for the combined procedure\nin this study were subluxation to the MI\ngreater than 40% to 50% in patients older\nthan 5 years of age, and a MI greater than\nindications were regardless of previous\ntreatments and ambulatory status. The sur-\ngical protocol was similar in all of the\npatients. First, the hip adductors and iliop-\nsoas tendons were released. Second, the hip\nwas assessed for reducibility. If concentric\nreduction was not possible, a standard\nanterior approach to the hip was used to\nperform open reduction and capsulorrha-\nphy. Third, VDRO was carried out through\na lateral approach. We avoided varus to\nneck\u00adshaft angles less than 100 and roughly\nestimated the amount of varus required by\nthe degree of hip abduction required for a\nconcentric reduction. The implant that was\nchosen for fixation of the VDRO was based\non the surgeon's preference. A modified\nDega osteotomy was performed as described\nby Mubarak et al.9 Moulds were taken for\nabduction brace measurements, and a hip\nspica was applied for approximately 6\nweeks, followed by physiotherapy and\nnight-time splinting. In unilateral cases, the\ncontralateral hip adductors and iliopsoas\nwere released if contracted.\nStatistical analysis\nNormality and equality of variances for\ncontinuous data were assessed graphically.\nCorrelations were performed by Pearson's\nmethod. Fisher's exact test was used for\ncount data. For parametric values, the\nindependent two-tailed t-test was used. For\nnonparametric variables, the Mann\u00ad\nWhitney\u00adWilcoxon test was applied. Two-\ntailed p values of < 0.05 were considered\nsignificant. We used R software for statis-\ntical analysis, version 3.3.1 (R Foundation\nfor Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).\nResults\nexcluded because of incomplete radio-\ngraphs. Therefore, a total of 71 patients\n(85 hips) were included in the analysis, with\ngirls. A total of 38 hips were on the right\nand 47 were on the left.

Although\npreoperative displacement was greater in\nnonambulatory patients, they did not have\na higher amount of subluxation compared\nwith ambulatory patients (Table 2).\nMoreover, PO did not improve, regardless\nof subsequent fusion of scoliosis to the pelvis\nand ambulatory status (Table 3). None of\nthe patients had instrumented fusion for\nscoliosis before the combined procedure. At\nthe final follow-up, MCPHCS was grade 1 in\nFigure 1.

In their\nstudy, the mean follow-up was 6.9 years.\nPelvic osteotomy was mostly a modified\nDega osteotomy, but Pemberton and Salter\nosteotomies were also used. A total of 31%\nof patients required subsequent surgery to\nmaintain reduction. A total of 95% of the\nhips remained reduced and there were no\nredislocations. Braatz et al.33 reported the\noutcomes after the combined procedure in\n72 hips in patients with cerebral palsy. In\ntheir study, at a mean follow-up of 7.7 years,\n89% of hips had an MI less than 30%, which\nis similar to a another previous report.29\nWe did not find a significant correlation\nbetween the patients' age and the final\nradiographic measurements. In a long-term\nstudy by Brunner et al.13 the minimum\nfollow-up was 11 years, and there were\nsmaller CEAs in patients with cerebral\npalsy who had femoral procedures before\nthe age of 4 years. The authors concluded\nthat femoral osteotomy alone did not main-\ntain sufficient acetabular coverage. The MI\nwas not measured in Brunner et al.'s13 study.\nAnother femoral reconstruction only cohort\nstudy was performed by Noonan et al.17,\nwith an average follow-up of 5.2 years.\nUsing the MI, the authors found less hip\nsubluxation in patients who were operated\non before 6 years old (18%) than in children\nwho were older (33%) at the time of recon-\nstruction. They also found a 28% overall\nrisk of later displacement. They concluded\nthat in older children, pelvic osteotomy\nshould be considered in addition to femoral\nvarus osteotomy and muscle balancing pro-\ncedures. Recently, Mallet et al.29 found no\ndifference during skeletal maturity after the\ncombined procedure between patients who\nwere younger and older than 8 years at the\ntime of reconstruction, which is similar to a\nfinding by Settecerri et al.19 Rutz et al.27 did\nnot find an association in a multivariate\nanalysis between age at the time of surgery\nand final MI in a long-term study of 168 hip\nreconstructions that included transiliac\nosteotomy.\nSeveral studies have found worse long-\nterm outcomes in patients with more pre-\npatients in these reports had pelvic osteo-\ntomies, and even fewer had modified Dega\nosteotomies. In our study, there was no\nassociation between the preoperative MI\nand later displacement, which is similar to\na previous report on the combined proced-\nstructed hips by Bayusentono et al.34,\nnonambulatory patients had more deterior-\nation in the MI, but only 80 hips in the\ncohort had pelvic osteotomy. Recently, in a\nstudy of 57 hips reconstructed with femoral\nand pelvic osteotomies, Reidy et al.35 did not\nfind a difference in the final MI between\nwalkers and non-walkers. In the present\nstudy, nonambulatory status was not asso-\nciated with poor radiographic results.\nAdditionally, there was no positive effect\non PO after the combined procedure. This\nfinding is similar to that by Abousamra\net al.36 who studied 12 unilateral hip dis-\nplacements treated with the combined pro-\ncedure in ambulatory children.\nTreatment of the opposite hip remains\ncontroversial. Carr and Gage warned\nagainst unilateral soft tissue hip surgery in\nnonambulatory patients with cerebral palsy\nbecause it may induce subluxation in the\ncontralateral hip.37 In another study, only\nnine of 35 untreated hips remained nondis-\nplaced after 4.2 years of follow-up.20 In a\nprevious study, only two of 48 nonoperated\nhips had femoral osteotomies for progres-\nsive subluxation.19 Canavese et al.21 found a\n44% risk of later bony reconstruction of\nwell-seated non-operated contralateral hips\nin patients with GMFCS levels III\u00adV when\nreviewed at skeletal maturity. In a study of\n35 unilateral hip reconstructions, Shukla\net al.38 noted progressive contralateral hip\nsubluxation in 17 patients, and it was less in\nhips that had soft tissue release. In our\nunilateral osseous reconstructions, spasticity\nin the contralateral hip was addressed sur-\ngically prior to or during the combined\nprocedure. We found that the incidence of\nsubsequent contralateral reconstruction\nThe probability of adverse events asso-\nciated with hip surgery in patients with\ncerebral palsy is high.39-41 More than half\nof the patients in our study had at least one\ncomplication. Root et al.42 showed that the\nrisk of AVN was 22.9% after routine\ncapsulotomy. A total of 10.6% of hips\ndeveloped AVN in our study, and this rate\nwas higher after open reduction. A total of\n9.7% of our patients indicated the presence\nof hip pain at the final follow-up, which is\nsimilar to a previous finding by Baraka\nThis study was retrospective with no\ncomparison group. Radiographic measure-\nments were used as a surrogate for import-\nant outcome measures. Ideally, accurate\nassessment of pain, function, and quality\nof life is preferred. In conclusion, the\ncombined procedure provides predictable\nradiographic results, regardless of age, pre-\noperative hip migration, and ambulatory\nstatus. In the unilateral combined pro-\ncedure, there is a low risk for future dis-\nplacement on the contralateral\nunreconstructed hip.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe Authors declare that there is no conflict of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial, or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
