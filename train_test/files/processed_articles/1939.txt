Using monozygotic and same sex dizygotic\ntwin pairs from the National Survey of Mid-Life\nDevelopment in the United States (MIDUS) we\nshow that positive affect is equally heritable among\nmate the heritability of positive affect after\ncontrolling for an exhaustive list of social and inter-\npersonal stressors, and we operationalize the\nresidual for positive affect as resilience. According\nto this specification, the heritability of resilience is\nhigher among men (h2 = .52) compared to women\n(h2 = .38). We show that self-acceptance is one of\nthe most important aspects of psychological func-\ntioning that accounts for the heritability of resilience\namong both men and women. However, compared\nto women, men appear to derive additional benefits\nfrom environmental mastery that may enable other-\nwise sex-neutral resilient tendencies to manifest.\nTwo individuals who have experienced comparable\nevents throughout most of their lives may respond\nvery differently to the same stressful life event such as\na divorce, loss of a job, or the death of a loved one.\nThose who successfully navigate these adversities and\nreport little to no adverse mental health consequences\nare often characterized as resilient. Resiliency is\nunderstood as a general, rather than domain specific,\norientation (Rutter, 2003), `implying a relative resis-\ntance to environmental risk experiences, or the\novercoming of stress or adversity' (Rutter, 2006, p. 1).\nPrevious research has identified several sources of\nresiliency with a particular emphasis on psychologi-\ncal, material, and social resources available to\nindividuals (Cicchetti & Rogosch, 1997). However,\nmore recent findings suggest that genetic factors are\nalso important for understanding individual differ-\nFor example, Caspi et al. (2003) show a strong asso-\nciation between the number of stressful life events\nthat adults have experienced and their subsequent risk\nof major depression. However, among those individu-\nals with two long alleles of a gene responsible for\nserotonin transmission (5-HTT) there is no clear\nassociation between chronic exposure to stressful life\nevents and poor mental health. That is, individuals\nwho are homozygous for this allele are particularly\nresilient to stressors that may otherwise lead to a\nmajor depressive episode.\nFew have examined the possibility that the genetic\neffects on resilience may be different for men and\nwomen. This is particularly relevant to the study of\ngene\u00adenvironment interactions because sex may con-\nstrain the genetic expression of resiliency among\nwomen, and it may enable this potential among men\n(Shanahan & Hofer, 2005). In their review of\ngene\u00adenvironment interaction studies, Shanahan and\nHofer (2005) argue that environments can `control\nphenotypes despite genetic propensities to the con-\ntrary' but they can also `help actualize genetic\nthe gene-environment interaction literature, the `envi-\nronment' is defined as narrowly as nutritional intake\n(Allen & Farell, 1996) and as broadly as birth cohorts\n(Kendler et al., 2000). And despite the fact men and\nwomen are socialized differently, engage in different\nroles in life, and have differential access to social and\nmaterial resources, sex is not typically considered as\nan `environmental' moderator within behavioral\ngenetic research (for exceptions see Walters, 2002).\nBecause of the distinct environments in which men\nand women (on average) are socialized, we argue that\nbiological sex, as a proxy for these different environ-\nments, enables genetically oriented resilience among\nmen and restricts these same genetic tendencies\namong women.

Women\nhave been shown to have lower self-confidence, lower\nself-esteem, and lower self-efficacy compared to men\nevaluated the efficacy of different psychological\nresources and active coping responses in mediating four\nrole-based stressors. They find that men are equipped\nwith more psychological resources (e.g., self-esteem and\nmastery) than women, concluding that in addition to\nother unmeasured factors, socialization better equips\nmen with effective psychological resources, buffering\nthem from the otherwise deleterious impact of stressors\non wellbeing.\nInterestingly, although previous work demonstrates\nsignificant sex differences in psychological wellbeing,\nthere is less evidence that these factors are differentially\nheritable. Kessler et al. (2004) assess six aspects of psy-\nchological wellbeing including autonomy, mastery,\npersonal growth, positive social relations, purpose in\nlife, and self-acceptance. These authors demonstrate a\nsizable heritable component for each of these factors,\nranging from .11 to .43, and there is very little evidence\nthat these factors are differentially heritable for men\nand women.1 The differential availability of these\nresources as a consequence of gendered experience,\nmay translate to other important aspects of mental\nhealth. That is, if there is a latent orientation toward\nresilience that has genetic underpinnings, then access to\npsychological resources, especially those related to\nsense of mastery, agency, and worth, may provide the\nrequisite foundation to enable resilience (Shanahan &\nHofer, 2005). Thus, sex may indirectly affect the struc-\nture of the genetic etiology of general resilience through\nthe provision of these gendered social psychological\nresources.\nIn this article we examine the possibility that\nresilience is a heritable trait among adults, and we\nlook for evidence of resilience above and beyond other\nindicators of psychological wellbeing. Further, most\nresilience research has focused on resiliency to child-\nhood stressors and has devoted scant attention to\nresiliency to environmental stressors during adult-\nhood. We build on this literature by including\nlife-stressors that are more germane to adult popula-\ntions, including problematic work environments or\ntroubled relationships with spouses or children, and\nwe examine the possibility that resilience is highly her-\nitable among men, but only weakly among women.\nMethods\nThis study makes use of data from the National\nSurvey of Midlife Development in the United States\nnationally representative survey designed to study the\neffects of midlife development on the self-reported\nphysical health, psychological wellbeing, and social\nconsciousness of adults aged 25 to 75. Data in the\nsurvey were collected through the use of a telephone\ninterview and a questionnaire mailed to nearly 7000\nrespondents. The MIDUS Twin Screening Project was\nused to identify 998 adult twin pairs to participate in\nthe study. After a screening of roughly 50,000 house-\nholds via a telephone interview, MIDUS interviewers\ncontacted the respondent who was then asked to\ncontact their twin to participate in the study.\nOf the 998 pairs, we used data from same sex\npairs with a determined zygosity. There were 367\npairs of monozygotic (MZ), and 352 pairs of dizygotic\n(DZ) twins included in the MIDUS study. We dropped\n263 pairs of opposite sex DZ twins and 16 pairs of\nundetermined zygosity. Because of the possibility of\npopulation stratification, we further dropped non-\nwhite pairs (n = 45) and pairs with missing race data\npairs where both twins are not missing on the positive\naffect measures, and impute missing values of covari-\nates for 78 pairs (a maximum of two imputations per\nperson), using the impute command in STATA 9\nMeasures\nResilience\nWe operationalize resilience as a positive affect despite\nchronic exposure to stressful life events. We use a pos-\nitive affect scale (Mroczek & Kolarz, 1998) created by\naveraging responses from six items. Respondents were\nasked `During the past 30 days, how much of the time\ndid you feel ... Cheerful? In good spirits? Extremely\nhappy? Calm and peaceful? Satisfied? Full of life?'\nResponses were coded on a scale of 1 (All the time) to\n5 (None of the time); the items were then standardized\nand summed, such that higher scores indicate better\nmood (Chronbach's alpha [] = .91). Descriptive sta-\ntistics for all variables used in the analyses are\npresented in Table 1.\nChronic and Acute Stressors\nRole-based stress is measured with three scales\ngauging the strain associated with one's spouse, chil-\ndren, and parents. These scales were constructed from\na checklist of ten problems experienced by the respon-\ndent in each respective role. The `yes' responses were\nsummed to yield possible scale scores between 0 and\n10, with higher scores indicating more strain. We used\nthe spousal strain scale to classify married or part-\nnered individuals into high strain and low strain\ncategories. Those in the 70th percentile (those with\ntwo or more strains) were classified as high strain. We\nalso coded those without a spouse or partner as either\nnever married or widowed/divorced/separated, using a\nset of dummy variables to model spousal strain and\nDownloaded from http:/www.cambridge.org/core.

Support for this perspective is evident in the\nfact that personality traits such as extraversion and\nneuroticism are consistently associated with happi-\nness, positive affect, and subjective well-being (Costa,\n1990). Accordingly, we define psychological function-\ning as traits that describe cognitive or behavioral\ndispositions to see oneself in a particular way. We\nposit that these resources condition one's response to\nstressors, and may partially explain resilience to stres-\nsors. We use the following six measures of positive\npsychological functioning : (a) positive relations with\nothers ( = .58); (b) self-acceptance ( = .59); (c)\nautonomy ( = .48); (d) personal growth ( = .55); (e)\nDownloaded from http:/www.cambridge.org/core.

Violations of these assumptions\ncan yield inaccurate heritability estimates. Others have\nfound violations of the equal environment assump-\ntion, but not the twin differentiation assumption,\nusing the same data (Kessler et al., 2004). To adjust\nfor these concerns, we included statistical controls for\nthree questions about the similarity of respondents'\nchildhood experiences; these questions assess how\noften twins were dressed alike, placed in the same\nclassrooms, and had the same playmates.\nResults\nDeFries-Fulker regression estimates are presented in\nTable 2. According to these estimates (Models 1 and\n3), positive affect is highly heritable, and there are no\nobservable differences in this estimate for men (h2 =\ncontrols for sociodemographic characteristics, social\nsupport mechanisms, and an exhaustive list of role\nstrains and social stressors. These controls signifi-\ncantly improved model fit for both men and women\nmen\nwomen\n= .39). Support derived from friends\nand family is strongly associated with positive affect\nand negative health status -- one of the most impor-\ntant stress factors in the current literature (Ensel &\nLin, 1991), and deleterious for both men and women.\nWe operationalize resilience as the change in the heri-\ntability estimate for positive affect with the inclusion\nof these controls. That is, those who report high posi-\ntive affect above and beyond this list of stressors and\nlife strains are operationalized as resilient.\nImportantly, the heritability estimate for women\ndecreases (h2 = .38), whereas the same estimate for\nmen only reduces slightly (h2 = .52).4 Thus, we find\nevidence that resilience is a heritable characteristic,\nbut more so among men compared to women.5\nAs discussed above, we expect the heritability of\nresilience to be moderated by psychosocial factors that\nfacilitate adjustment to psychological stressors, and we\nfurther anticipate the mediating role of psychological\nfunctioning to be different for men and women. The\nestimates presented in Tables 3 and 4 present a series of\nDF models in which controls for psychological func-\ntioning are included individually and we pay particular\nattention to changes in the heritability estimate. The\nfirst entry (model 1) of Table 3 is identical to model 2\nof Table 2, but we only present the quantitative genetic\nestimates to focus on the heritability estimate. Model 2\nof Table 3 includes a control for positive relations with\nothers. Among men, this control reduced the heritabil-\nity estimate from .51 to .48, corresponding to a 6%\nreduction in the estimate. The full array of covariates\nreduced the heritability estimate for resilience for men\nto 27%, and the effect was no longer statistically sig-\nnificant. Table 4 presents the same analysis among\nwomen, and tests of the mediator effects of psycholog-\nical resources are summarized in Table 5. Among men,\nenvironmental mastery ( = .52); and (f) purpose in\nStatistical Analysis\nWe use a DeFries-Fulker (DF) regression technique to\nestimate the relative contribution of genetic factors to\nthe demonstration of resilience (DeFries & Fulker,\n1985). The estimates from this model are used to cal-\nculate the proportion of variance for a particular trait\ndue to (1) genetic characteristics (broad sense heri-\ntability); (2) shared environment; and (3) unshared\nenvironment. In this model the value for the first twin\nof pair j (y\n) is modeled as a function of their co-\ntwin's score on that same attribute (y\n), a measure of\nzygosity (g\nj\n) coded .5 for MZ twins and 0 for DZ\ntwins, and an interaction between their sibling's score\nand their zygosity (g\nj\ny\n).3 The estimate for b3 is oper-\nationalized as the proportion of phenotypic variance\ndue to genetic factors (broad sense heritability). This\nestimate simply describes the degree of resemblance\namong twins as a function of their zygosity. Because\nthe original DF model was designed around a proband\ndesign, we use a double-entry structure and standard\nerrors are adjusted accordingly.\ny\n= b\n+ b\ny\n+ b\ng\nj\n+ b\ng\nj\ny\n+ e\nj\nThis model is particularly useful for our purposes\nbecause it allows for control variables in addition to\nthe three covariates included in model 1. Because we\nare interested in the heritability of resilience, we model\nsalutary affect, but also include an exhaustive list of\nchronic and lifetime stressors and social and demo-\ngraphic characteristics that are known correlates of\npositive affect. We operationalize the residual variance\nin positive mood -- that is, after adjusting for life\nstressors -- as resilience. Therefore, whereas the esti-\nmate for b3 in equation 1 describes the heritability of\npositive affect, the same estimate in equation 2 --\nafter controls for k stress-related or protective factors\n-- denotes the heritability of resilience.\ny\n= b\n+ b\ny\n+ b\ng\nj\n+ b\ng\nj\ny\n+\nk\nb\nk\nx\n+ e\nj\nThe heritability of resilience can be further decom-\nposed as a function of factors that are theoretically\nlinked to resilience. As described above, there are\nestablished aspects of psychological functioning that\nmay bear on an individual's resilience. Therefore, we\nestimate one final set of models in which we include\nan array of controls for psychological functioning. As\nwith the transition from equation 1 to equation 2, we\nare primarily concerned with changes in the heritabil-\nity estimate with the inclusion of these variables.\nBecause we hypothesize differential effects by sex, we\nestimate separate models for men and women.\nThe logic of quantitative genetic twin analysis\nassumes that MZ and DZ twins experience similar\nshared environments.

Although the heritability of resilience among\nmen remained statistically significant, this one item\nexplained nearly 40 per cent of the effect; this mediat-\ning effect was statistically significant.

Further, while this\nreduction was only marginally significant (p < .09),\ncontrols for self-acceptance reduced the heritability of\nresilience estimate among men by 33%. Taken together,\nthese two aspects of psychological wellbeing appear to\nbe largely responsible for the realization of genetic ten-\ndencies to be relatively resilient.\nAlthough the magnitude of the heritability estimate\nis notably smaller, similar analyses were performed for\nwomen and are presented in Table 4. As with men,\nthe full array of psychological resources reduced the\nheritability estimate to nonsignificance for women\n(h2 = .04). Most of this reduction appears to be\nlinked with one particular psychological resource,\nself-acceptance. This one control reduced the heri-\ntability estimate by over 70 per cent, and rendered the\nheritability of resilience statistically nonsignificant.\nThis was not the case for any of the single measures of\npsychological resources among men.\nDiscussion\nThe key finding of this article is that resilience, as\noperationalized here, is a heritable feature. More\nimportantly, the heritability of resilience is higher\namong men compared to women. Including controls\nfor psychological functioning reduced the heritability\nestimates for both men and women. This implies that\ngenetic factors -- mediated through more proximate\nmeasures of psychological functioning -- play an\nimportant role in heritable resilience to environmental\nstressors. Self-acceptance appears to be an important\nmechanism through which resilience manifests for\nboth men and women. While environmental mastery\nemerged as an important factor responsible for the\nheritability of resilience among men, this factor was\nsignificantly less important among women.\nThough sex may capture physiological differences,\nsuch as hormonal or sex-linked genetic differences,\nsex also confers different, broadly defined environ-\nments for men and women. Our findings are\nparticularly relevant to gene\u00adenvironment interaction\nstudies because they suggest that sex is an important\nenvironmental moderator of latent genetic factors\nthat contribute to salutary mental health. This point\nis made clear when one considers that the two mea-\nsures of psychological functioning that appear to\nunderlie the heritability of resilience (self-acceptance\nand environmental mastery) are themselves highly\nheritable, but they are not differentially heritable for\nmen and women. According to Kessler et al. (2004),\nthe heritability of self-acceptance and environmental\nmastery are .41 and .33, respectively. When these\nmodels were modified to allow a sex-specific esti-\nmate, the inclusion of this additional parameter\nestimate did not improve the overall model fit. Thus,\nthere is no evidence that either self-acceptance or\nenvironmental mastery is differentially heritable\namong men and women.\nDownloaded from http:/www.cambridge.org/core.

For example, Kendler et al.,\n(2001) show that, compared to men, women are no\nmore susceptible to stressful life events in general.\nHowever, they show clear differences in sensitivity to\nspecific life events including divorce, housing prob-\nlems, and relationship conflicts. Many of the strains\nand supports included in our models were interper-\nsonal in nature, assessing one's role as a spouse,\nparent, child, or employee; the relationship-oriented\nvariables witnessed the most differences among men\nand women. Further, the relationship strains only con-\nsider problems experienced by a spouse, child, parent\nor interpersonal relationships among friends and\nfamily. If women are more sensitive to the problems of\nfriends, these models may not specify these sources of\nstress, acting to make female twins more discordant\nand reducing heritability estimates for women.\nA second possibility is that women use different\ncoping strategies than men. Our analysis considers\npsychological functioning, but not repertoires of\ncoping strategies. A number of studies document dif-\nferences in the coping styles of men and women, with\nmany noting a more active style among men compared\nto women (Pearlin & Schooler, 1978; Nolen-\nHoeksema, 1987). Notably, active styles have been\nfound to be more protective against the ill-effects of\nstressors (Pearlin & Schooler, 1978). Nolen-Hoeksema\nThis is important because it suggests that the medi-\nating role of psychological functioning -- as a\ndeterminant of sex differences in the genetic effects of\nresilience -- is social rather than biological in origin.\nThat is, it appears as though men are better able to\n`cash in' on this genetically oriented resource.\nAccounting for this phenomenon goes beyond the\nscope of this paper, but it is likely that men have\ngreater opportunity to express resilience and are more\nlikely to be rewarded for exhibiting traditional signs\nof resilience. In other words, gender socialization may\ninteract with genetic factors to either diminish\nresilience for women, or help men to actualize some\ngenetic potential that confers resilience. We cannot\nestablish which of these two possibilities may be the\ncase. Genes only influence phenotypes within an envi-\nronment; to determine whether resilience is suppressed\nor actualized would require us to assume that some\nare socialized without clear gender roles, and this is a\ndifficult assumption to justify.\nOne explanation for the better prediction of a\nfemale's positive affect may be that women are social-\nized to be relationship-oriented, while men are\nsocialized to be independent. Under the `cost of\ncaring' hypothesis, women are thought to be more\nsensitive to the problems faced by their friends and\nfamily (Kessler & McLeod, 1984; Maciejewski et al.,\n2001). If this is this case, women may be less resilient\nDeFries-Fulker Regression Estimates Among Same-Sex MZ and DZ Male Twin Pairs: Psychological Functioning Mediators\nNote: ** p <.01, * p < .05, + p < .10.

Slowing of mortality rates at older ages in\nwhile controlling for psychological functioning is the\npossibility that women experience normative pressure\nto cope with stressors in a maladaptive manner.\nThere are important limitations that should be\nconsidered when interpreting these results. First,\nalthough we adjust for the nonlinear association with\nage, there is a wide range of ages in the study. This is\nimportant because of differential genetic effects across\nthe life course (Vaupel et al., 1998) but also because of\nclear cohort differences in genetic associations (Carey\nmate the heritability of tobacco use by comparing\nregular tobacco use among twin pairs raised together\nand those raised apart across the following three\nThey present a consistent estimate for men across\nbirth cohorts (h2 ~ .55), but they show that the esti-\nmate for women increases over time; the heritability\nfor the first cohort was zero, but increased to 21%,\nand peaked at 64% in the third cohort. Thus, by the\nthird cohort, there were no sex differences in the heri-\ntability of regular tobacco use. The authors argue that\nthe social restrictions on women's tobacco use have\nrelaxed significantly across these three cohorts, which\nmade it possible for genetic tendencies for tobacco use\nto manifest. With respect to our study, we are not able\nto differentiate between age, period, or cohort effects,\nand our results should be considered generalizable to\nthis adult population only. Second, our focus is on the\nparameter estimate for heritability, and we do not\nexplore sex differences in environmental factors in\nfurther detail. For example, shared environmental influ-\nences are indicated by the coefficients for the twin's\nscore (t2) in the models of Table 3. There appears to be\na shared environmental effect for women, but not men.\nThis shared environment may reflect the degree to\nwhich female twins grow up in traditional versus non-\ntraditional households. Again, given that the sample\nranges in age from 25 to 74, the significant coefficient\nfor shared environment in model 6 is noteworthy.\nDespite these limitations, this paper makes an impor-\ntant contribution because we position biological sex as\nan environmental moderator. This perspective is impor-\ntant because behavioral genetic studies often report sex\ndifferences in heritability, linkage, or associations, but do\nnot anticipate these differences with a priori hypotheses\nabout the presence or direction of these differences.\nGiven the long standing work in the social sciences\nregarding the role of sex in terms of identity, structure,\nand agency (Collins, 2000), in conjunction with consis-\ntent differences in heritability for men and women across\na wide range of different outcomes (Read et al., 2006),\nefforts should be made to develop a testable and general-\nizable theory regarding the role of sex in behavioral\ngenetic studies among humans.\n"
