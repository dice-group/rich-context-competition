Markides1-\n'Center on Aging, ^Department of Internal Medicine, and 'Department of Preventive Medicine and Community Health,\nUniversity of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston.\nBackground. Among the elderly population, the risk for psychological distress increases with the number of chronic\ndiseases and accompanying functional disability. The prevalence of chronic medical conditions and functional disabil-\nity varies substantially across ethnocultural groups, however. Using data from the Hispanic EPESE, we previously\nreported that among older Mexican Americans, the total number of chronic medical conditions and the presence of\nfunctional impairment are strong predictors of depressive symptoms.\nMethods. Using multiple regression, we examined the association between specific chronic diseases, individual\nfunctional disabilities, and depressive symptoms in this group of ethnic elders.\ndictive of high levels of depressive symptoms. Hip fracture, although recognized as having a substantial impact on\nfunctional status, was not found to be associated with depressive symptoms. History of stroke was not significantly\nassociated with depressive symptoms in bivariate or multivariate analyses, but history of stroke with residual speech\nproblems was predictive (OR = 2.16, 95% CI = 1.01-4.79). Among specific activities of daily living, only impaired\nproved to be predictive in multivariate analyses.\nConclusions. This constellation of chronic medical conditions and functional disabilities is very different from those\nreported to be associated with depressive symptoms in older non-Hispanic White and African Americans, and appears\nto comprise those conditions most associated with substantial physical impairment, pain, and discomfort.\nANUMBER of studies have found that, among elderly\npeople, the risk for depressive symptoms increases\nwith the number of chronic diseases (1-3). Using data from\nthe New Haven Established Population for the Epidemio-\nlogic Study of the Elderly (EPESE), for example, Berkman\net al. (4) found that the number of self-reported physical\nhealth conditions was predictive of high levels of depres-\nsive symptoms indicative of serious psychological distress.\nSimilar results have been found in both the Duke (5) and\nthe Iowa EPESE studies (6).\nThe risk of depression is greater when physical illness is\naccompanied by functional disability (7,8). Indeed, func-\ntional limitations are considered to be prime mediators of\nthe observed associations between severity of physical ill-\nness and depression in elders (3).\nWhereas several investigators have examined the associ-\nation between specific medical conditions and psychologi-\ncal well-being in elders (1,2,9-12), few studies have been\ndesigned to simultaneously examine the influence of multi-\nple chronic medical conditions on the psychological well-\nbeing of older adults using large, population-based sam-\nples. Specifically, in a study of older non-Hispanic Whites,\nPennix et al. (13) found that the risk for depressive symp-\ntoms was most strongly associated with arthritis, lung dis-\nease, stroke, cancer, and atherosclerosis. Among older\nAfrican Americans, Bazargan and Hamm-Baugh (14)\nfound that psychological distress was most strongly associ-\nated with kidney disease, vision problems, and circulation\nproblems, to the virtual exclusion of other conditions.\nLittle is known, however, concerning the influence of\nspecific and multiple chronic medical conditions on psy-\nchological distress among older Mexican Americans, who\nexperience higher rates of diabetes, obesity, and gallstone\ndisease, and lower rates of heart disease and cancer than\nAmericans in general (15,16). We have been examining the\nrelationship between depressive symptomatology and the\nnumber of chronic conditions using data from the Hispanic\nEPESE, the first large, representative study of older Mexi-\ncan Americans residing in the Southwestern United States.\nIn our first report (17), we found that about 22% of the\n2,823 respondents reported having no chronic conditions,\nwith some 25% reporting three or more conditions, and the\nremaining 53% reporting one or two chronic conditions.\nUsing a cutoff score of 16 on the Center for Epidemiologic\nStudies of Depression (CES-D) Scale (18), 25.6% of the\nsubjects reported high levels of depressive symptoms.\nBoth the mean CES-D score and the prevalence of high\nlevels of symptoms increased with the number of reported\nchronic conditions, with those reporting two or more condi-\ntions at significantly higher risk for high levels of depres-\nsive symptoms. Higher mean CES-D scores and rates of\nhigh levels of symptoms were also strongly associated with\nany functional disability, which was reported by about 12%\nof older Mexican Americans. Multivariate regression analy-\nses indicated that in addition to sociodemographic charac-\nteristics, functional disability and the number of chronic\nconditions were found to be among the strongest predictors\nof depressive symptoms. These findings suggest that the\nexcess risk for depressive symptoms may, in part, be attrib-\nutable to an increased prevalence of chronic medical condi-\ntions that are accompanied by substantial impairment in\nfunctional status.\nThe present study expands upon this earlier work to\nexamine the relationships among depressive symptomatol-\nogy, specific chronic diseases, and individual functional\nlimitations in older Mexican Americans, using the data\nfrom the Hispanic EPESE survey. The Hispanic EPESE is\nthe first large-scale study using a representative sample of\ncommunity-dwelling Mexican American elders from the\nSouthwest region of the United States. We hypothesized\nthat strong relationships between psychological distress,\nchronic medical conditions, and functional disability would\nbe evident among older Mexican Americans. We expected\ndifferences, however, regarding the specific conditions most\nstrongly associated with depressive symptoms in this\ngroup, in comparison with African American and non-His-\npanic White American elders.\nMETHODS\nSample\nEPESE survey was conducted in the five Southwestern\nstates of Texas, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, and Cali-\nfornia. Area probability sampling resulted in a sample of\nan 86% response rate) who agreed to complete in-home\nface-to-face interviews, either in Spanish or English. The\nanalyses presented here reflect the reports of 2,823 individ-\nuals who completed the questionnaire items pertaining to\ndepressive symptomatology, chronic physical health condi-\ntions, and functional health.\nMeasures\nDepressive symptomatology was measured with the Cen-\nter for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, which is\nthe most widely used survey measure of depressive symp-\ntomatology in studies of older adults. This scale has been\nfound to be highly reliable and valid when used with elders\n(19), and is predictive of both current and future clinical\ndepression (20). The scale consists of 20 items that ask how\noften specific symptoms were experienced during the past\nweek; responses are scored on a 4-point scale, with poten-\ntial total scores ranging from 0-60. Two measures were\nderived from the CES-D in this study, a continuous measure\nbased on the overall score and a dichotomous measure of\nhigh levels of depressive symptomatology, or caseness,\ndefined as a score of 16 or greater (21).\nChronic physical health conditions were assessed with a\nseries of items in which the respondents were asked if they\nhad ever been told by a doctor that they had adult onset\ndiabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, hypertension,\nstroke, cancer, gall bladder disease, hip fracture, or arthritis.\nRespondents were also asked about any other chronic con-\nditions that seriously affect their health, and substantial\nnumbers reported having urinary or bowel incontinence,\nstomach ulcers, asthma, or kidney disease.\nFunctional disability was measured with the Katz Activi-\nties of Daily Living scale [ADL; (22)]. The ADL items\nwere scored dichotomously, according to whether or not the\nrespondent reported needing help to perform the activity.\nHealth care service utilization measures included wheth-\ner or not the respondents reported being hospitalized over-\nnight and whether they had visited a physician more than\nonce during the 12 months prior to the interview.\nSociodemographic characteristics included the respon-\ndent's age (as of the most recent birthday), gender, years of\neducation, country of birth, and the language in which the\nrespondent chose to conduct the interview (Spanish or\nEnglish). Respondents were also asked the type of health\ninsurance coverage they had or if they had no coverage.\nAnalyses\nDifferences in the mean total CES-D scores and in the\ncaseness rates by sociodemographic characteristics, chronic\nhealth conditions, individual functional disabilities, and\nhealth-related characteristics were evaluated with r-test and\nanalysis of variance statistics. Independent variables found\nto be significantly associated with depressive symptoms\nwere then entered into multiple regression models. Ordi-\nnary least squares regression was employed to model the\ncontinuous measure of the CES-D score, and logistic re-\ngression was employed to model the dichotomous measure\nof caseness. All regression analyses included an examina-\ntion of interaction effects and an assessment of possible\nmulticollinearity among the independent variables. In order\nto produce results that were representative of older Mexican\nAmericans in the five Southwestern states, all analyses\nincorporated weighted data and adjusted for design effects.\nConfidence intervals were computed using the SUDAAN\nRESULTS\nBivariate Results\nThe sociodemographic and health-related characteristics\nof the sample used in this study have largely been described\nin earlier work, along with the distribution of mean CES-D\nscores and caseness rates (17). About 57% of the older\nMexican Americans were women and 67.6% were between\nthe ages of 65 and 74. The level of education was low, with\n81.2% reporting less than 9 years of schooling. Whereas\n44.5% of the respondents had been born outside the United\nStates, 72.8% preferred to conduct the interview in Spanish.\nHaving no medical insurance coverage was reported by\nrently married, and 78.2% lived in households of two or\nmore people. Less than one-fifth (18%) had been hospital-\nized during the past year, and 23.4% reported visiting a\nphysician more than once in the 12 months prior to the\ninterview.\nRespondents reported an average of 10.5 depressive\nsymptoms, with 25.6% reporting high levels of depressive\nsymptoms (based on a CES-D score of 16 or more). We\nreported that female gender, low levels of education, not\nbeing currently married, preferring to conduct the interview\nin Spanish, having no insurance coverage, the number of\nchronic diseases, and functional disability were associated\nwith higher mean CES-D scores and caseness rates (17).\nTable 1 presents the distribution of weighted CES-D\nscores and prevalence of caseness (CES-D score of 16 or\nmore) by specific self-reported chronic conditions and indi-\nvidual functional limitations. Almost all of the medical con-\nditions and all functional limitations were significantly\nassociated with both a higher mean number of depressive\nsymptoms and a higher prevalence of caseness. Interest-\ningly, no association between depressive symptoms and the\nreport of stroke was evident. We further examined the asso-\nciation among those stroke victims who reported having\nresidual problems, including upper extremity impairment,\nlower extremity impairment and residual speech problems\n(Table 2).\nMultivariate Results\nThe results of the ordinary least squares regression\nmodel predicting CES-D scores are presented in Table 3. In\nterms of specific chronic conditions, diabetes, cardiovascu-\nlar disease, stroke with residual speech problems, cancer,\narthritis, urinary incontinence, bowel incontinence, and kid-\nney disease were found to be predictive of CES-D scores.\nWith these conditions in the equation, other individual con-\nditions were no longer significant. Regarding individual\nfunctional limitations, only impaired ability to walk across\na room and to bathe were found predictive of CES-D\nscores. Being female, having little education, and having no\ninsurance coverage were also predictive of higher CES-D\nscores, as was having been hospitalized in the past year or\nhaving visited a physician more than once in the past year.\nAge and language of interview were not significant predic-\ntors in this model. In examining interaction effects between\nthe various independent variables, we found an interaction\nbetween gender and immigrant status, with female immi-\ngrants having a greater risk and male immigrants having a\nlower risk for higher CES-D scores.\nSimilar results were found with the logistic regression\nmodel predicting high levels of depressive symptoms. As\ncan be seen in Table 4, diabetes, stroke with residual speech\nproblems, arthritis, urinary incontinence, bowel inconti-\nnence, kidney disease, and stomach ulcers were found to be\npredictive of caseness. Cardiovascular disease and cancer,\nwhich were predictive of increased CES-D scores, were not\npredictive of caseness. Impaired ability to walk across a\nTable 1.

In bivariate analyses,\nsignificant associations were evident between depressive\nsymptoms and several specific medical conditions. Associa-\ntions with many of these conditions have been reported in\nstudies of older non-Hispanic Whites and African Ameri-\ncans, including diabetes (9), cardiovascular disease (1),\nhypertension (12,24), cancer (ll), arthritis (10), kidney dis-\nThe most noteworthy finding evident in the present\nstudy, however, is the particular constellation of specific\nchronic medical conditions found to be predictive of\ndepressive symptoms in multivariate analyses. This cluster\nincluded diabetes, stroke with residual speech problems,\narthritis, cancer, urinary and bowel incontinence, kidney\ndisease, and stomach ulcers. This constellation differs sub-\nstantially from those found predictive of psychological dis-\ntress in other studies that employed multivariate analyses.\nSpecifically, the cluster of conditions found predictive\namong older non-Hispanic Whites included arthritis, lung\ndisease, stroke, cancer, and peripheral atherosclerosis,\nwhereas cardiac disease, diabetes, and other conditions\nwere not as predictive (13). The cluster of conditions that\nwere predictive among older African Americans included\nkidney disease, vision problems, and circulation problems\nin arms and legs, whereas heart disease, hypertension, dia-\nbetes, arthritis, lung disease, stomach problems, and hear-\ning problems were not predictive (14). Certain of these con-\nditions, such as lung disease, were not reported at all by the\nolder Mexican Americans.\nThe presence of functional disability was also found to\nbe predictive of depressive symptoms in this population,\nconsistent with reported findings for other ethnic elderly\ngroups (4,5, i2). Our findings indicate, however, that among\nthis group of elders, the influence of functional loss on psy-\nchological distress appears to be limited to specific disabili-\nties: Only impaired ability to walk across a room or to\nbathe oneself proved predictive in multivariate analyses\nwhich controlled for the presence of the specific chronic\nconditions and functional disabilities. Furthermore, the\naddition of functional disabilities had very little effect on\nthe diseases found predictive of depressive symptoms.\nIndeed, the odds ratios for individual functional disabilities\ndecreased substantially from the bivariate to the multivari-\nate analyses, unlike the odds ratios for the individual\nchronic medical conditions. For example, the odds ratio for\nthe impaired abilities to dress and transfer decreased from\ntivariate analyses.\nWe were surprised to find that stroke and hip fracture,\nconditions generally recognized as having substantial func-\ntional consequences and often found associated with\ndepressive symptoms in the elderly (1,13,25), were not pre-\ndictive of psychological distress in older Mexican Ameri-\ncans, when controlling for the presence of other conditions.\nIndeed, only stroke accompanied by residual speech prob-\nlems proved predictive of depressive symptoms in this sam-\nple (Table 2). This difference may be explained, in part, by\nthe time passed since the diagnosis, as well as a lack of\nresidual problems. All but one of the reported diagnoses of\nstroke in our sample occurred more than one year prior to\nthe interview, and over 76% occurred more than two years\nearlier. In addition, over 40% of those who had suffered\nstrokes reported experiencing no residual problems. Simi-\nlarly, only one of the reported diagnoses of hip fracture\noccurred more than one year prior to the interview, and\nover 83% occurred more than two years earlier.\nSeveral investigators have proposed that the relationship\nbetween medical conditions and depressive symptoms may\ndiffer according to the nature of disease (1). It has also been\nsuggested that the association between depression and\nchronic illness may be mediated through reduced social\nfunctioning and inability to maintain self-sufficiency that\ncan result from restricted physical activity (2). In the case\nof stroke and hip fracture, it is possible that these older\nMexican Americans weje less disabled at the time of inter-\nview in comparison to other elderly groups. In addition,\nthey may be more likely to have recovered substantial phys-\nical and social functioning, as a result of a greater availabil-\nity of social support. Over 55% of this sample were cur-\nrently married, over 78% lived in households of two or\nmore people, over 82% reported having a confidant, and an\naverage of five living children were reported; these propor-\ntions are substantially higher than typically reported by\nsamples of older African Americans and non-Hispanic\nWhites (6,14,19). This increased availability of support\nmay help to speed recovery from conditions such as stroke\nor hip fracture, or lessen the loss of functioning.\nIt might also be argued that those individuals with stroke\nand hip fracture who suffered more severe functional\ndeficits could not participate in our survey. We did find sig-\nnificantly higher rates of both these conditions among our\nproxy respondents (who were excluded from the present\nanalyses) than among our regular interviews. However, we\nalso found significantly higher rates of diabetes, cardiovas-\ncular disease, and kidney disease among our proxy respon-\ndents, conditions which did prove predictive of depressive\nsymptoms in our analyses.\nIt has been postulated that activity restriction may exert\nits influence on psychological well-being by causing low-\nered perceptions of personal control and self-esteem (26) or\nby reducing social contact and support (3). Rodin and\nVoshart (27) also noted that fear, loss of self-esteem, nega-\ntive body image, and a sense of uncertainty, as well as nega-\ntive effects on employment status and interpersonal relation-\nships that may result from physical illness or decreased\nfunctioning, may increase the risk for depressive symptoms.\nThis may help to explain the substantially higher rates of\ndepressive symptoms found in the older Mexican Ameri-\ncans, in comparison to rates typically reported for older\nAfrican Americans and non-Hispanic Whites (4,5,6,17).\nSpecifically, part of the increased risk may be due to the\nhigher prevalence of the specific chronic health conditions\nthat are associated with substantial physical impairment in\nthis elderly group, such as diabetes, kidney disease, arthri-\ntis, and incontinence.\nIt could be argued that depressive symptoms may be the\nresult of biologic processes occurring as a direct result of\nthese conditions. In studies of diabetes, for example, an\nincrease in depressive symptoms has been found associated\nwith increased glycosolate hemoglobin Ai (28). However,\nthe increase in blood glucose concentrations appears to be\ndue to poor glucose control that results from depression\n(29), rather than a direct result of diabetes. Furthermore,\ndepression also appears to be associated with both in-\ncreased reporting of clinical symptoms in diabetics and an\nincreased perception of distress, suggesting a heightened\nsensitivity or vulnerability to the effects of the disease.\nSimilarly, the increased depression often found among\nindividuals who suffer from kidney disease, arthritis, and\nincontinence appears to be the result of decreased mobility\nand pain. Stomach ulcers also are associated with substantial\npain and discomfort. All these conditions can be character-\nized as chronic stressors causing reduced activity and lower\nself-esteem. Indeed, many of these conditions may be par-\nticularly associated with the activity limitations most associ-\nated with depressive symptoms: impaired ability to walk\nacross a room or to bathe oneself. This suggests that it may\nbe the consequences of these conditions rather than the con-\nditions per se that contribute to depression in older adults.\nSeveral authors have postulated that Mexican Americans\nmay be more likely to report depressive symptoms (particu-\nlarly somatic items) than non-Hispanics (30-32), thus\nbringing into question the validity of the higher symptom\nrates. In the present study, the somatic items in the CES-D\nwere no more frequently reported than in other groups of\nelders (33,34). An absence of positive emotional state, how-\never, as measured by the four positive affect items in the\nCES-D, was much more likely to be reported by these older\nMexican Americans than other depressive items, suggesting\nsome response bias. Although these items are often more\nfrequently reported by Mexican Americans (35), they are\nalso among the most frequently reported items and are\noften the items with the highest nonresponse rates among\nother ethnic groups (33,34). Factor analysis of the CES-D\ndata indicated that these well-being items form a clear fac-\ntor (36). Coupled with comparable response rates for these\nitems in other studies of older Mexican Americans (35),\nthis suggests that rather than response bias, symptoms such\nas hopelessness about the future, self-deprecation, unhappi-\nness, and lack of enjoyment are important aspects of psy-\nchological functioning for Mexican Americans. Parallel\nanalyses comparing the Hispanic EPESE data with data\nfrom the other EPESE studies may help to address both the\nhigher symptom rates and the differences in the associated\nchronic medical conditions found in this study.\nCertain limitations to the present study should be noted.\nFirst, the study employed cross-sectional data, precluding\nany assumptions concerning causality. We cannot say with\ncertainty that the specific conditions, or subsequent func-\ntional limitations, that are associated with depressive symp-\ntoms in this population are actual causes. Neither can we\nconclude that psychological distress exacerbates physical\nhealth conditions. Unlike Parkinson's disease and stroke,\nwhich have been found to have specific etiological links\nwith depression (37), the conditions most strongly associ-\nated with depressive symptoms in these older Mexican\nAmericans have generally not been established as etiologic\nfactors for depression, aside from that of general decline in\nhealth. Continued analysis of longitudinal data from subse-\nquent waves of the Hispanic EPESE will help to clarify\nsome of the causal relationships between these phenomena.\nA second limitation to the present study is its reliance\nonly on self-report of depressive symptomatology, not clini-\ncal diagnosis. Several studies have found that persons with\nhigh levels of self-reported depressive symptoms are at\nmuch greater risk for depression one or more years later,\nsuggesting that they reflect a long-term or recurring psy-\nchological distress (38). Data from the second wave of the\nHispanic EPESE should help to clarify this issue, as diag-\nnoses based on structured interview schedules (39) will be\navailable for both lifetime and 6-month prevalence of major\ndepression and dysthymia.\nDespite these limitations, the strength of this study lies in\nthe evidence it provides for the relationship of chronic\nhealth issues, functional disability, and psychological dis-\ntress among older Mexican Americans. It has been sug-\ngested that depressive symptoms may increase the risk of\nnoncompliance to medical treatment or may weaken the\nimmune system, thus increasing the risk for complications\nand greater severity of disease among individuals with\nchronic medical conditions (40,41), and increasing the risk\nfor mortality (42). More importantly, treatment of several\nconditions, such as diabetes, as well as reductions in func-\ntional disabilities, have been associated with improvements\nin depressive status (43). Increased awareness of the strong\nassociations between specific chronic conditions, functional\nimpairments, and depressive symptoms in older Mexican\nAmericans can help physicians and other clinicians better\naddress concomitant depression and physical illness, partic-\nularly illness that is accompanied by functional declines.\nBecause of the size and representative nature of our sam-\nple, these findings can be generalized to the older Mexican\nAmerican population residing throughout the Southwest.\nOur results indicate that a large proportion of older Mexi-\nlevels of depressive symptoms that are associated with two\nareas with the potential for intervention: physical health\nand functional disability. Beyond this minority group, the\npresent study adds to our understanding of the complex\ninterrelationships between physical, functional, and mental\nhealth in all older adults, indicating the strength of the role\nplayed by chronic conditions and functional limitations in\nthe relationship between physical and mental health.\nAddressing these interrelationships could extend the inde-\npendent survival of older Mexican Americans, as well as\nolder adults in general, by improving compliance, prevent-\ning excess mortality and morbidity, and improving the dis-\ntribution of health care services.\n"
