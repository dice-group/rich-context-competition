Multiple linear regression\nanalysis showed that all of the HCAHPS dimensions were significantly associated with overall satisfaction. Older female\npatients reported substantially more positive global evaluations than their male counterparts.

One common target group has been hospital-\nized patients for at least two reasons. First, admission to a\nhospital can be a traumatic and frustrating experience for\nmany individuals. Second, admission to a hospital can be\nassociated with high costs for the individual (Quintana etal.,\n2006). Patient satisfaction and experiences in the hospital\nsetting are considered a cornerstone in the evaluation of\nhealth care quality (Danielsen etal., 2010) and have assumed\nan even greater significance subsequent to the passage of the\nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) of\nlaw, the Hospital Value-Based Purchasing Program, financial\nincentives are associated with hospitals' performance on the\nHospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and\nSystems (HCAHPS) Survey (Elliott etal., 2012).

In most of these studies, a consistent and sig-\nnificant association was found between age and patient satis-\nfaction with older patients (age 65 and older), expressing\nhigher levels of satisfaction compared with younger patients\n1Western Kentucky University, Bowling Green, USA\n2University of Georgia, Athens, USA\n3Ascension Health, St. Louis, MO, USA\n4University of North Texas, Fort Worth, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nNeale R.

Kurz4\n Keywords\npatient satisfaction, patient experience, HCAHPS, hospitals, older adults\n2 SAGE Open\n(Peck, 2011). Few studies have examined samples exclu-\nsively involving older adults regarding their experiences\nwith care received during their hospital stay. However, mixed\nresults have emerged. Some meta-analyses on hospital\npatient satisfaction have not shown any gender differences\n(Sitzia & Wood, 1997), whereas other studies suggest that\ngender differences do appear (Foss & Hofoss, 2004).\nAge has consistently been found to be associated with\npatient satisfaction scores, with higher age correlated with\nhigher satisfaction scores (Foss & Hofoss, 2004). Among the\nolder hospitalized population, this gender difference could\nbe even more pronounced. Compared with younger patients,\nolder hospital patients have unique needs for the delivery of\ntheir care. This is mainly due to the inherent heterogeneity\nfound in this subgroup, the complex health status episodes\nexperiences and the misconceptions regarding health and ill-\nness that are prevalent in the elderly population (Carter,\nMcKenna, Martin, & Andrescn, 1989; Ekdahl, Andersson, &\nFriedrichsen, 2010). Although patient participation in the\nmedical decision-making process has been associated with\nhigher patient satisfaction ratings, research shows that older\npatients are more likely to assume a passive role in treatment\ndecisions (Breemhaar, Visser, & Kleijnen, 1990). This may\nbe due to the fact that older patients find it more difficult to\nprocess complex medical information and are also less likely\nto maintain their emotional equilibrium while receiving such\nHospital care involves inputs from a variety of different\nsources such as nursing staff, physicians, staff other than\nnurses, and \"hotel\" amenities such as patient's room. These\nattributes form the basis for patient-reported quality of care\nsurveys. It is unclear from the literature on HCAHPS which\nattributes are correlated most with patient satisfaction among\nhospitalized elderly patients. The primary objective of this\nstudy was to delineate the contribution of each of the six key\nindependent variables on overall hospital satisfaction among\nelderly patients. A secondary objective is to determine if\nthese specific care experiences differed between female and\nmale patients.\nMethod\nDesign, Data Source, and Setting\nThis cross-sectional study was conducted between July 1,\nwith care data from 70 hospitals that are members of the larg-\nest nonprofit health system in the United States. The 70 hos-\npitals are largely located in the Midwest, Southeast, South,\nNorthwest, and Northeast, and represent a wide range of hos-\npitals in size, services, and geography. Critical access, com-\nmunity, and tertiary hospitals are represented in the data set.\nand 40,000 affiliated and employed physicians. Their operat-\ning revenue was US$20.5 billion, and the total assets were\nData Collection Instrument\nThe data were collected by applying the HCAHPS Survey\ninstrument to record regular patient experience at each of the\nhospitals. HCAHPS was developed by the CMS in collabo-\nration with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality\n(AHRQ) to provide a standardized survey instrument for\nmeasuring patients' perspective on hospital experiences\n(Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, 2013). The\nHCAHPS Survey was the first national, standardized data-\nbase on patients' experiences in short-term, acute care hospi-\ntals (Kutney-Lee etal., 2009). HCAHPS data are collected\nthrough the CMS-prescribed data collection protocol and\ninclude the following eligibility criteria: one or more over-\nnight stays in the hospital, a nonpsychiatric principal diagno-\nsis, and alive when discharged (Elliott et\nHCAHPS also includes additional questions measuring\npatient perceptions about aspects of their experience thought\nto affect overall satisfaction and loyalty to the hospital pro-\nvider. The AHRQ had RAND Corporation, Harvard Medical\nSchool, and American Institutes for Research, together with\nWestat, carry out a rigorous, scientific process to develop\nand validate the HCAHPS instrument, and the results (psy-\nchometric properties including validity and reliability, cred-\nibility, usefulness, etc.) have been confirmed and published\nelsewhere (Goldstein, Farquhar, Crofton, Darby, & Garfinkel,\n2005; O'Malley, Zaslavsky, Elliott, Zaborski, & Cleary,\n2005). Data were collected through telephone interviews\nconducted on a constant and regular basis for each hospital.\nPatients discharged from one of the hospitals were randomly\nselected and contacted (generally within a week), and\nresponded directly to the survey vendor. The survey vendor\ncompiled the raw data and sent a data set to the health sys-\ntem's central office. Response rates vary by individual hospi-\ntal, but across all hospitals, the average response rate was\n40%. This high response rate was achieved through the mul-\ntiwave survey technique. This study analyzed only those\npatients who were 65 years of age or older. For further details\non HCAHPS Survey administration, see HCAHPS Quality\nAssurance Guidelines V5.0 (Centers for Medicare &\nHCAHPS Survey Measures\nThe HCAHPS Survey yields a series of measures of patients'\nhospital experience. Moreover, the survey includes stand-\nalone items and global measures. For the purpose of this\nstudy, we selected four composite measures of hospital expe-\nrience--Communication With Nurses, Communication With\nDoctors, Responsiveness of Hospital Staff, and\nCommunication About Medicines--each comprised of two\nor three individual survey questions. We also added two\nChumbler et al. 3\nstand-alone report items (Cleanliness of the Hospital\nEnvironment and Quietness of Hospital Environment). (See\nhttp://www.hcahpsonline.org for the entire survey instru-\nment as well as administration protocols) All of these items\nhave a standard set of response options: never, sometimes,\nusually, and always. The arithmetic mean of these items was\nused as a composite index for the independent variable.\nAdditional independent variables included demographic\ncharacteristics such as the patients' race, gender, age, educa-\ntional attainment, and self-perceived health. The race vari-\nable was classified as African American, Asian American,\nAmerican Indian/Alaska Native, and White. Age was classi-\nfied as an ordinal variable consisting of five categories: 65 to\n90 years or older. Similarly, educational attainment was cat-\negorized as an ordinal variable: completed eighth grade or\nless, completed some high school but did not graduate, grad-\nuated from high school or earned General Educational\nDevelopment (GED), completed some college or earned\n2-year degree, graduated from a 4-year college, and com-\npleted more than a 4-year college degree. Self-perceived\nhealth was measured by asking \"How would you rate your\noverall health?\" The response options were excellent, very\ngood, good, fair, and poor, and a larger value indicates\npoorer health.\nThe dependent variable, which was derived from the\nHCAHPS, included a single item asking respondents to rate\ntheir experience with an overall rating of the hospital with\nscores ranging from 0 (worst possible hospital) to 10 (best\npossible hospital). Similar to previous authors who have\nused HCAHPS, this item was linearly rescaled to a possible\nrange of 0 to 100 for comparability and ease of interpretation\nso that the transformed score y = 100 \u00d7 (x - a) / (b - a),\nwhere original score x was on a scale from a to b (Elliott\nStatistical Analysis\nDescriptive statistics for the respondents and single items\nand composite indices are presented in Table 1. Hierarchical\nlinear regression analysis was used to assess the independent\nassociations between the older patients' gender, the six\nHCAHPS dimensions (hospital experience measures), and\noverall patient satisfaction while considering potential hospi-\ntal-level nested effects. All six HCAHPS hospital experience\ndimensions and gender were entered simultaneously with the\ncontrol variables (age, race, self-perceived health, and edu-\ncation). Another Level 1 regression model consisted of two-\nway interaction terms. The interaction effects were analyzed\nby creating a product term for each independent variable\n(e.g., Communication With Nurses) and being female (with\nbeing male serving as the reference group) while controlling\nfor the same background variables. The different combining\nprocesses of patients with gender and each hospital experi-\nence scale were assessed with the significance levels of the\ncoefficients of the product terms. In all analyses, p < .05 was\nconsidered statistically significant. All statistical analyses\nwere performed using SPSS v. 22.\nResults\nThe descriptive statistics for the older patient characteristics\nare presented in Table 1. In brief, the majority of the older\npatient participants were female (58.7%). Most of the\npatients were White (90.3%). The largest proportion of\nerence to educational attainment, the most common category\nincluded those who earned a high school diploma or the\nequivalent (37.4%). Three in 10 of the respondents rated\ntheir health as \"fair to poor.\"\nThe descriptive results for the single items and composite\nindices are shown in Table 2. The reliability (Cronbach's\nalpha coefficients) of each of the composite indices is also\nshown in Table 2. Note that the numbers of responses vary\nbecause patients did not respond to all items. All survey\nitems in the HCAHPS's domains show positive patient\nTable 1.

To assess the nested effect of hospitals, intraclass cor-\nrelation coefficient (ICC) was obtained.\nvalue of 1.2% indicates that a small portion (1.2%) of the\ntotal variance occurs between hospitals, and thus, most of\nvariance occurs within hospitals.\nBeing an older female patient was associated with an 8.1-\npoint increase in overall satisfaction after adjusting for hos-\npital experiences, age, race, education, and self-rated health\nstatus. All six hospital experience indicators were signifi-\ncantly associated with overall satisfaction. For example,\nolder patients who reported more positive experiences with\ncommunicating with the doctors and with the nurses were\nassociated with an 8.8-point and an 8.4-point increase,\nrespectively, in overall satisfaction. Older patients who\nreported a more positive experience with the responsiveness\nof the hospital staff were associated with a 4.2-point increase\nin overall satisfaction. As compared with patients aged 65 to\nincrease in overall satisfaction.\nTable 3 also presents the statistically significant interac-\ntion terms from the model. For the older patients, a positive\nand statistically significant interaction effect was found for\nnursing care and being a female patient. In other words, for\nolder female patients, relationship with nurses was more\nimportant in their ratings of overall satisfaction, compared\nwith older male patients. Conversely, a negative and statisti-\ncally significant interaction effect was found for physician\ncare and being a female patient. That is, for older male\npatients, relationship with physicians was more important in\ntheir ratings of overall satisfaction than for older female\npatients. The two interaction terms (Responsiveness of\nHospital Staff Care \u00d7 Gender, Communication About\nMedicines\u00d7Gender,CleanlinessoftheHospitalEnvironment\n\u00d7 Gender, and Quietness of Hospital Environment \u00d7 Gender)\nwere not statistically significant.\nThe last column in Table 3 also shows the level of statisti-\ncal significance for gender and inpatient dimensions of care\nexperiences, and overall satisfaction. The statistically sig-\nnificant hospital-specific care experience correlates, in order\nof importance, were Communication With Doctors (p <\nResponsiveness of Hospital Staff (p < .0001), Cleanliness of\nthe Hospital Environment (p < .0001), Quietness of Hospital\nEnvironment (p < .0001), and Communication About\nMedicines (p < .0001). Overall, all of the variables accounted\nfor 47% of the variance in hospital rating.\nChumbler et al. 5\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we examined reports of patients' perceptions of\ntheir hospital experience, specifically among older (65 years\nand older) individuals. More specifically, this is one of the very\nfew studies that examined the relationship between six key hos-\npital attributes--Communication With Nurses, Communication\nWithDoctors,ResponsivenessofHospitalStaff,Communication\nAbout Medicines, Cleanliness of the Hospital Environment, and\nQuietness of Hospital Environment--and overall patient\nsatisfaction in a large, geographically dispersed U.S. sample of\nhospitalized elderly patients. Assessing patient satisfaction is\nsalient because it measures how hospitalized older patients feel\nabout the care they receive. Hospital experience and overall sat-\nisfaction was measured by HCAHPS, the first national, stan-\ndardized survey instrument and data collection methodology for\nassessing patients' perceptions of their hospital experience in\nthe United States (Goldstein et\ninvestigated if these specific care experiences differed between\nelderly female and male patients. Our findings indicate that all\nsix hospital experience measures were significantly associated\nwith overall satisfaction. However, all six were not equally\ninfluential. These findings further suggest that a one-size-fits-all\nstrategy to improve patient overall rating of the hospital would\nnot work well. The regression model in the present study\nexplained 47% of the variation in overall patient satisfaction.\nThis explanatory power is comparable with other studies that\nhave incorporated patient-reported experiences and sociodemo-\ngraphic variables as predictors (Bjertnaes, Sjetne, & Iversen,\nOverall, Communication With Doctors was the strongest\ncorrelate of overall satisfaction, with the second most influ-\nential being Communication With Nurses. These findings are\nsimilar to a Norwegian study of 63 hospitals in five health\nregions, which found that experiences with nursing services\nand experiences with doctor services were the most impor-\ntant predictors of patient satisfaction for hospitalized patients\n(Bjertnaes etal., 2012). Thus, the communication with pro-\nviders (both physicians and nurses) more than the other\ndomains is more important with overall satisfaction, a find-\ning consistent with other studies (Andersen, Rice, &\nKominski, 2001). Furthermore, older patients have a better\nexperience with their hospital care when the hospital envi-\nronment is both clean and quiet.\nWe also found that older female patients reported consid-\nerably greater overall satisfaction than their male counter-\nparts. This finding is contrary to a previous study with\nHCAHPS data, which found that female patients tended to\nreport worse experiences than men (Elliott etal., 2012). A\nplausible reason for the difference in the finding is that our\nstudy specifically examined patients 65 years or older,\nwhereas Elliott and colleagues (2012) used patients 18 years\nor older at time of admission. Moreover, our data were more\nThis study found that patients combined their attribute\nreactions differently depending on their gender. For older\nmale patients, Communication With Doctors was more influ-\nential in their ratings of overall satisfaction than for older\nfemale patients. This finding suggests that when a hospital\nadmits patients who are older men, the hospital needs to con-\nsider and maintain optimal communication by physicians.\nConversely, the present study found that for older female\npatients, Communication With Nurses was more influential\nin their ratings of overall satisfaction than for older male\nTable 3.

These findings are in contrast to some studies that\nfound that women report less positive interactions than men\nwith nurses but better interactions with physicians (Elliott\netal., 2012). The clear gender differences in our study under-\nscore the need for a gender-sensitive approach in the encoun-\nters between older male and female patients by physicians\nand nurses, respectively (Foss & Hofoss, 2004). The remain-\ning four other HCAHPS patient experience domains and\ngender interaction effects were not statistically significant.\nAmong the other independent variables, age and educa-\ntional attainment were found to be statistically significant.\nyears were found to report greater overall satisfaction than the\nreference age group of 65 to 69 years. In other words, patients\naged 75 to 84 years were more likely to rate their overall hos-\npital stay as positive compared with patients aged 65 to 69\nyears. In terms of educational attainment, greater educational\nattainment tended to be inversely associated with overall sat-\nisfaction. As compared with those with less than an eighth-\ngrade education, patients in the following groups had lower\nsatisfaction scores: high school (or equivalent), some college,\na 4-year college education, and more than a 4-year college\neducation. For instance, respondents with a 4-year college\neducation, the group with the strongest magnitude, were asso-\nciated with a 2.77-point decrease in overall satisfaction.\nStudy Limitations\nSome important caveats of the present study need to be men-\ntioned. First, the cross-sectional design of this study does not\ninform us about causation. Future research should use longitu-\ndinal designs that would better assess causality in addition to\nunmeasured variables. Second, our analysis was limited to a\ncertain number of hospitals that voluntarily submitted\nHCAHPS data during the time frame delineated in the study.\nIn other words, the hospitals used in the present study may not\nbe representative of all hospitals in terms of location and bed\nsize. As reported elsewhere (Lehrman etal., 2010), rural hos-\npitals with fewer than 100 beds and those in the Plains region\nwere underrepresented among hospitals that voluntarily par-\nticipated in the HCAHPS data reporting. Third, we were\nunable to control for the consumers' attitudes toward physi-\ncians and nurses before their hospital stay. Future research\nshould collect data that examine consumers' attitudes before\nand after their hospital stay. From a health plan perspective, an\nultimate outcome measure of patient satisfaction is whether or\nnot enrollees choose to switch plans (Cunningham & Kohn,\n2000). Future studies can use the patient satisfaction data as a\npredictor of plan switching in older hospitalized adults.\nFourth, the data available precluded us from considering\npatient loyalty (\"a personal commitment that contributes, or at\nleast can be expressed in terms of contributions, to the success\nand survival of a health care provider, either an individual prac-\ntitioner or an organization\"), an important variable linked to\noverall satisfaction (MacStravic, 1991, p. 61). Hospital loyalty,\nexpressed as intention to return to or recommend the hospital\nthey used most recently, is typically reported to be quite high.\nHowever, the intention to return to a hospital tends to fade with\ntime, subject to significant attrition in 3 to 6 months, and such a\ndecision differs between men and women (Fisk, Brown,\nCannizzaro, & Naftal, 1990). Future research should consider\nloyalty and, in particular, differences between men and women.\nFinally, our data precluded us from controlling for a series of\npatient health status characteristics. With the exception of self-\nrated health status, we were unable to control for other health-\nrelated variables of the patients, including number of admissions\nin the past year or so and length of stay in the hospital.\nImplications\nDespite these study limitations, our data have distinct value\nand offer some important implications. Our study is one of\nthe few that described older patient hospital experiences and\nsatisfaction with care by using a validated HCAHPS instru-\nment among a large U.S.-based private, not-for-profit hospi-\ntal system. Findings from our study have implications for\ntreating geriatric patients. Overall assessments of older\npatients in hospitals can be improved by assuring good com-\nmunication by nurses and doctors, as well as maintaining\nresponsiveness of staff to older patients' needs and ensuring\nclear communication by staff.\nIt is plausible that findings from this study may be attrib-\nuted to multiple factors found in the older adult patient popu-\nlation such as previous experiences with inpatient care, a\nrelatively low level of knowledge regarding medical issues,\nand a strong tendency to provide socially acceptable\nresponses to survey questionnaires. Some studies suggest\nthat the positive perception of health care quality in older\npatients could possibly stem from the fact that health care\nproviders are in reality more responsive to their needs result-\ning in a more patient-centric experience (Bjertnaes et\nal.,\n2012). Behavioral research has shown that older patients are\nless demanding and more prone to resigning themselves to\ntheir fate. Thus, lower expectations and higher acceptance of\ntheir condition may also influence overall satisfaction with\nhospital care among older adults.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAndersen, R.
