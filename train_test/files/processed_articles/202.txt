    "abstract": "ABSTRACT: This paper estimates the contribution of demographics to the\nMedicare financing dilemma. It suggests that delayed eligibility, by itself, cannot\nsolve this problem. Although there is uncertainty regarding each component of\ndemographic change, there is little hope that the future population distribution\nwill save the program without other, more painful, measures. Methods used in\nthe private sector, such as prefunding, have not been seriously applied to\nmedical insurance but might provide part of the solution for long-run solvency.\nMedicare reformers confront many serious prob-\nlems. One of the most worrisome is the role of demograph-\nics as the population ages. Population changes alone will\ndouble Medicare's financial burden relative to earnings in the next\nseventy-five years. The aging population eventually will include\nmany more beneficiaries and few workers to provide tax income to\npay for their benefits. The situation is somewhat worse in the\nUnited States than in other industrialized countries because the\npost\u00adWorld War II baby boom was more pronounced here. Persons\npopulation aging truly begins to pick up speed.\nPlaced in perspective, the projected future influence of popula-\ntion change on Medicare program costs over the next seventy-five\nyears is much less than the influence of price inflation has been over\nthe past thirty years. Nevertheless, population change will com-\npound the other problems.\nAlthough many analysts view population forecasts as reliable,\nconsiderable uncertainty exists about each component of popula-\ntion change: fertility, migration, and mortality. The respected de-\nmographer Nathan Keyfitz, after reviewing more than 1,000 popula-\ntion forecasts for a variety of countries, concluded that \"relatively\n\u00a9 1999The People-to-PeopleHealth Foundation,Inc.\nDavid McKusick is a senior actuary at the Actuarial Research Corporation in Columbia,\nMaryland, specializing in public-sector medical care financing.

A long-run forecast such as those prepared for the Medicare\ntrustees is a necessary part of ongoing vigilance, even though it is\nrecognized that the forecast must be revised as experience emerges.2\nDespite the uncertainty, the demographic problem alone clearly will\nrequire major changes in Medicare.\nMedicare And Demographics: The Basics\nFor funding purposes, the Medicare program is divided into Hospi-\ntal Insurance (HI, or Part A) and Supplementary Medical Insurance\n(SMI, or Part B). The former pays for inpatient hospital care, short-\nterm skilled nursing facility (SNF) services, acute home health care\nservices, and limited hospice care. The latter pays for physician\nservices including lab and x-ray, outpatient hospital care, ambula-\ntory surgical centers, some home health care, and other miscellane-\nous services such as ambulance and durable medical equipment.\nTwo major differences distinguish the two programs from the\nperspective of long-run financial soundness. HI is supported almost\nentirely from a payroll tax, which is paid into a trust fund, and\nbenefits are disbursed from that trust fund. The fund is small rela-\ntive to program commitments and serves primarily to allow tax\ncollections and program payments to be made without explicit an-\nnual appropriations of funds. This tax structure is established in law\ninto perpetuity. Each year the board of trustees of the HI program\npresents a forecast of the financial status of the fund, projected for\nseventy-five years into the future.3\nSMI is paid for by premiums charged to enrollees and payments\nfrom general tax revenue matching premiums at a ratio specified by\nlaw at roughly a three-to-one ratio. Premiums are promulgated by\nthe secretary of health and human services (HHS) annually, so it is\npossible to measure the financial future of the trust fund for only one\nyear at a time. This odd financial arrangement insulates the Part B\ntrust fund from the publicity that accompanies the periodic crises\nsuffered by the Part A trust fund when it is announced to be at the\nbrink of bankruptcy. The financial strain on the taxpayers, however,\nis not ameliorated by this short-run financing strategy. The services\ncovered by Part A (coincidentally, it appears) are more influenced by\nthe average age of enrollees than are the services covered by Part B.\nThat is, hospital, SNF, and home health costs rise more rapidly with\nage than do physician and outpatient costs, which dominate Part B.\nThe basic demographic problem facing Medicare is that Medicare\nBENEFICIARIES\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ J a n u a r y / F e b r u a r y 1 9 9 9\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

At about the same time, the population ages twenty\nto sixty-four, which has traditionally made up the tax-paying work-\nforce, is expected to decline from about 59 percent of the population\nto 55 percent during that time. The ratio of the population age\nsixty-five and older to the population ages twenty to sixty-four,\nsometimes called the elderly dependency ratio, is now about 20\nunder intermediate demographic assumptions.\nUntil recently, it was difficult to treat the demographics of the\nMedicare program very seriously because exploding program pay-\nments, due mostly to increases in the price of services, dominated\nthe growth rate. In the 1970s Medicare outlays increased fivefold\n(with a little boost from adding the disabled to Medicare rolls). In\nthe 1980s expenditures tripled.4 Under current projections, spend-\ning will more than double during the 1990s. Even the unprecedented\ngram enrollment to increase by only two-thirds.\nIn the past several years, however, Medicare cost increases result-\ning from nondemographic factors have moderated so that they grew\nonly 2\u00ad3 percent faster than wage increases in covered employ-\nment.5 Part of this is attributable to better control of unit costs\nfollowing the introduction of the prospective payment system (PPS)\nfor hospitals and limits on physician fees using volume performance\nstandards. The volume of hospital and physician services also has\ngrown more slowly, perhaps because of the specific actions of Con-\ngress or perhaps because of changes taking place in the broader\nhealth care market. With this slower growth in the price and vol-\nume of services per enrollee, the prospects for finding an acceptable\nsolution to the long-range financing problems are enhanced, and the\ndemographic component assumes a more significant role.\nIf the populations of beneficiaries and workers were to grow at\nthe same rate, volume and price of services per beneficiary could\ngrow at the same rate as wages per worker in covered employment\nwages in covered employment grew at an average annual rate of 4\npercent, while Medicare costs per capita grew at an average annual\nrate of 6 percent. This compares with an average annual increase in\nwages of 7 percent per worker in the 1970s, when Medicare costs per\nworking-age population is assumed to grow 0.5 percent annually,\nwhile the population age sixty-five and older is projected to grow 3\npercent. This excess growth of 2.5 percentage points would have to\nISSUES\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ V o l u m e 1 8 , N u m b e r 1\nM e d i c a r e B e n e f i c i a r i e s\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Since we are primarily interested in percentage\nchanges between years, the Medicare cost per capita and earnings\nfigures are shown in Exhibit 1 relative to the baseline year, 1998.\nUnder the intermediate set of demographic assumptions, the av-\nerage Medicare cost per person rises 35 percent between 1998 and\nsition also could have a positive effect on average earnings if the\npopulation became more concentrated in high-earnings age groups,\nthus helping to offset increased expenses. However, as the exhibit\nalso shows, the isolated effects of demographic changes on earnings\nare negative, thus compounding the problem.\nIn the second half of Exhibit 1, assuming a rise in the Medicare\neligibility age from sixty-five to seventy years, for years after 1998 all\nIsolated Effects Of Population Change And Change In Medicare Eligibility On Per\nCapita Medicare Expenses And Population Earnings, Percentage Change Over 1998\nLevels, Projections Under Three Cost Scenarios\nNo change in eligibility age Eligibility age raised to 70\nLow cost assumptions\nMedicare expenses per capita\nPopulation earnings per capita\nIntermediate cost assumptions\nMedicare expenses per capita\nPopulation earnings per capita\nHigh cost assumptions\nMedicare expenses per capita\nPopulation earnings per capita\nSOURCES: Author's calculations based on Social Security Administration population projections and Medicare program data.\nNOTE: Changes in this exhibit are relative to 1998 spending and earnings levels.\nBENEFICIARIES\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ J a n u a r y / F e b r u a r y 1 9 9 9\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Medicare expenses drop about 15\npercent, and earnings rise about 3 percent. The demographic lever-\nage of delaying Medicare eligibility is not large enough by itself to\nerase the deterioration in program solvency even if it is accompanied\nby increased workforce participation among the elderly.\nDeterminants Of Population Distribution\nThere are three determinants of population distribution by age and\nsex: mortality, fertility, and net migration. Of these, mortality is\nmost likely to influence Medicare's financial viability over the next\ntwenty-five years. Most of the population that will be eligible for\nbenefits in that period are living now, although a few young persons\ncould become eligible because of disability or end-stage renal dis-\nease. Net (legal) migration has been small in recent decades, and\nthere is no reason to anticipate major changes in the near future.\nMortality determines how many survive to eligibility and the lon-\ngevity of those who do. For the second and third twenty-five-year\nperiods of the forecast, mortality continues to play a major role, but\nfertility and migration have a potentially significant effect on the\nsize and age distribution of the labor force.\nn Mortality. Compared with other components of change in\nMedicare costs and income, mortality has shown remarkable pre-\ndictability over the past several decades; however, even this element\ncould vary enough to produce significantly different program out-\ncomes. Overall mortality in the U.S. population has declined a little\nover 1 percent annually during the twentieth century. However, the\ndecline has been erratic and even reversed during certain periods.\ncent annually.8 During the 1940s age-adjusted mortality rates de-\nclined more than 2 percent annually, but during the 1960s improve-\nment was only a little more than 0.5 percent annually. Age-adjusted\nmortality among women has recently increased.\nBoth the levels of mortality and improvement rates vary signifi-\ncantly among population subgroups. The differentials suggest to\nsome the possibility of improved mortality and longevity if the mor-\ntality rates of groups with poor experience can be brought into line\nwith those of the best groups. Women have lower age-adjusted\nmortality rates than men and have benefited more from mortality\nimprovements over the past century. That mortality differential\nseems to persist at all ages. Some believe that the differential is\ninnate, but others have conjectured that differences in lifestyle (es-\nISSUES\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ V o l u m e 1 8 , N u m b e r 1\nM e d i c a r e B e n e f i c i a r i e s\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

On the other hand,\nAsian Americans have age-adjusted mortality that is about 25 per-\ncent lower than that of whites. The differential between blacks and\nwhites has decreased over the past fifty years. This apparent re-\nsponse to public funding of health care for the elderly or poor has\nsuggested to some that the differences in death rates by race are not\ninnate but primarily attributable to socioeconomic conditions.10\nCross-national mortality comparisons also have been used in esti-\nmating the best mortality rates achievable by large populations,\ngiven current lifestyle practices. Japan now has the highest reported\nlife expectancy in the world and has shown dramatic improvement\nduring the past few decades. In 1960 Japan's life expectancy was just\nover sixty-five years. U.S. life expectancy was almost sixty-seven\nyears, and Sweden led among industrialized countries at a little over\nseventy-one years. By 1982 Japan's life expectancy exceeded sev-\nenty-four years, the United States was a little over seventy-one, and\nthe former leader Sweden had risen to a little over seventy-three\nyears. Life expectancy in Japan now exceeds eighty-one years, while\nU.S. life expectancy is about seventy-six years.11\nHow much difference do variations in mortality projections mat-\nter for the size of the Medicare enrollment in the future? In response\nto Census Bureau projections for a range of mortality improvements\nthat they consider too timid, Dennis Ahlburg and James Vaupel\nbaseline fixes the total fertility rate at 1.84 (approximately the rate\nimprovements in mortality from the 1990 level. Under this scenario\n2080, as low birthrates overcome the initial influence of the baby\nboom of the 1950s. Holding all other assumptions fixed, these ana-\npercent annually.

The popula-\ntion over age eighty-five increases from 1.3 percent of the population\nmigration schedules. The SSA's low mortality forecast projects\nabout 7.5 percent of the population over age eighty-five in 2073.\nClearly, some experts do not believe that the SSA's mortality fore-\ncasts make adequate allowance for improvements in mortality,\nwhich would create even greater problems than anticipated for all of\nthe social insurance programs. However, the future demographic\nscenarios being described by the SSA are the product of assump-\ntions about several components of demographic change. It is the\nbalance of these assumptions that determines whether the range of\nreasonable possibilities has been described.\nn Fertility.The fertility part of Medicare's emerging demographic\nproblem arises from the prolonged baby boom following World\nWar II followed by a sharp reduction in birthrates. In the longer\nterm, over the next seventy-five years, the projected continuation of\nlow birthrates compared with improved survival to old age would\nworsen the financial status of Medicare as now constituted. This is\nthe mirror image of the demographic bonus of the early decades of\nSocial Security, when births were high relative to longevity and\nprovided a labor force that grew relative to the number of retirees.\nTo place the fertility issue in some perspective, consider the U.S.\ntotal fertility rate during the past century. This rate is a summary\nmeasure of birthrates fora given year andrepresents the total number\nof children a hypothetical woman would have if she were to survive\nher childbearing years and experience the birthrates of that year at\neach age.13 A total fertility rate of 2.1 is considered replacement fertil-\nity, allowing for male babies outnumbering females and childhood\nmortality before those children reached childbearing years.14 The ac-\ntual number of births in the year depends on age-specific birthrates\nand the age distribution of women in the population.\nThe total fertility rate in 1920 was about 3.3 births per woman and\nremained there until 1940. The resulting small cohort of this period\nproduced slow growth in the Medicare population sixty-five years\ntotal fertility rate grew steadily through the years of World War II\nto about 2.4, jumped to about 3.0 immediately after the war, and\nISSUES\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ V o l u m e 1 8 , N u m b e r 1\nM e d i c a r e B e n e f i c i a r i e s\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

The impact of this baby boom\non the labor force appeared about 1965; its influence on Medicare\neligibility will show up shortly after 2010.\nThe total fertility rate declined steadily from 1959 to a low of\nmodest recovery to about 2.0 remains today. This relatively small\ncohort began entering the workforce a few years ago. These persons\nwould become eligible for Medicare as aged beneficiaries about\n2040, but currently projected low birthrates do not provide corre-\nsponding income relief from the labor force.\nThe experience of other developed countries provides some per-\nspective on the future of U.S. fertility. Among English-speaking\ncountries the evolution of the baby boom and bust was closely\nsynchronized, and all now have total fertility rates below the re-\nplacement rate.15 Most European countries followed similar patterns\nas the United States with similar timing, although the U.S. peak\nfertility was the highest. Many now have total fertility rates below\nthe U.S. rate.16 Fertility rates have continued to decline in most\nEuropean countries, and only the United States and Sweden have\nrebounded to near the replacement level.\nSeveral theories of fertility have been proposed to explain this\nhistory and perhaps predict the future. Economic theories have tried\nto reconcile the seeming inconsistencies between fertility rates and\neconomic factors. Generally, low-income families and low-income\ncountries have higher birthrates than do those with high incomes.\nEconomic growth generally has been associated with lower fertility\nrates. On the other hand, birthrates generally have moved in the\nsame direction as the economy during business cycles.\nOne resolution for industrialized societies, in which children are\ngenerally not income producers for the family, is the proposition\nthat children become more expensive as income rises both because\nthe expectations for their education and acculturation rise and be-\ncause the cost of parental time (especially the mother's) increases.17\nFrom this perspective, one would probably expect continued low\nfertility. The relatively small cohort now entering the workforce is\nunlikely to produce any excess labor, and social changes that took\nplace over the past few decades appear to predict continuing de-\nmand for women in the workplace.\nAn alternative scenario proposes that fertility is a function of\nrelative income of young men compared with that of their parents'\ncohort.18 When young men's earnings are high compared with their\nparents', they feel well off and have more children. Diane\nMacunovich has attributed part of the recovery of birthrates to near\nthe replacement level in the early 1990s to this phenomenon plus\nBENEFICIARIES\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ J a n u a r y / F e b r u a r y 1 9 9 9\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

It has been suggested that the rapid\ndecline in birthrates in the 1960s was associated with environ-\nmental concerns and that future fertility may respond to society's\nneeds to maintain itself.20\nHow does all of this relate to Medicare? The trustees' population\nforecast conveys an expectation of continued low fertility, perhaps\nreflecting the continuing very low rates in other industrialized\ncountries. The intermediate forecast of the 1998 trustees' reports is\nbased on an ultimate total fertility rate of 1.9 (reached by 2025). The\nhigh and low total fertility rates (corresponding to low and high\ncost) are 2.2 and 1.6, respectively. That is, the estimates of fertility\nconsidered by the trustees range from just above the replacement\nrate to well below it, resulting in an expectation of a small work-\nforce compared with the number of eligible Medicare beneficiaries.\nHealth Status, Retirement, And Medicare\nThere has been great interest in whether the declines in mortality\nmight also be accompanied by or even caused by improved health\nstatus. A contrary hypothesis is that mortality improvement has\noccurred among persons who are impaired and might have been\nexpected to die if they had not received the medical or other inter-\nventions that led to the decline in deaths.21\nThe current and future health status of the elderly population\ncould have a strong influence on Medicare program revenue and\noutlays. In addition to the contribution that health makes to the\nwelfare of an individual, better population health could improve\nMedicare's financial status by keeping taxpayers in the workforce\nlonger and by decreasing beneficiaries' demand for services.\nUsing the National Long-Term Care Surveys, Kenneth Manton\nand colleagues found declines in both disability and morbidity in\nthe noninstitutionalized Medicare population between 1982 and\narteriosclerosis by 5.0 percent, hypertension by 2.2 percent, and\ncirculatory problems by 3.8 percent. The proportion of the popula-\ntion that was disabled--defined as (1) being institutionalized, (2)\nfailing an activity of daily living (ADL), or (3) failing an instrumental\nactivity of daily living (IADL) function--fell from 24.5 percent in\nEileen Crimmins and colleagues also found declining disability\namong the elderly in the Longitudinal Survey on Aging and National\nISSUES\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ V o l u m e 1 8 , N u m b e r 1\nM e d i c a r e B e n e f i c i a r i e s\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

A decline of 0.71\npercent annually was reported for men ages sixty-five and sixty-six\nwho said that they were unable to work and 0.55 percent for men\nages sixty-seven to sixty-nine. Among women in these age groups,\nCould this pool of retirees contribute to Medicare's financial sal-\ncent of men and 50 percent of women were in the labor force at age\nfifty-five.25 By age sixty-five the rates had dropped to about 30 per-\ncent of men and 20 percent of women. By age sixty-nine 20 percent\nof men and 10 percent of women were still in the labor force. I have\nupdated those figures using the March 1997 Current Population\nSurvey (CPS) (Exhibit 2). About 85 percent of men and 70 percent\nof women age fifty-five said that they were in the workforce during\n1996. At age sixty-five there is a sharp drop in the proportion of men\nand women in the workforce (40 percent of men and 30 percent of\nwomen), and the proportion continues to decline.\nSome workers already are only marginally participating in Medi-\ncare because they are probably in good health with modest medical\nexpenses and because many have chosen their employer-sponsored\ninsurance as their primary coverage instead of Medicare. Other\nworkers are in jobs without medical insurance but might be able to\npurchase individual coverage if insurance laws allowed. Nonwork-\ners constitute a potentially large pool of persons who might be\nworking if their health permitted and if other considerations en-\ncouraged work or acquisition of private health insurance; this\npolicy-relevant finding deserves further attention.\nThe decision to retire obviously is not just a matter of health\ncreased more than 18 percent, while labor-force participation over\nage sixty-five plummeted. David Wise credits pensions and Social\nSecurity as the major contributors to the decision to retire.26 He\nconcludes that given the presence of a (defined-benefit) pension\nplan, persons in excellent or very good health are more likely to plan\nto work past age sixty-two, but in the absence of such a plan, health\nstatus makes little difference.

With or without retiree medical coverage, the existence of a\ndefined-benefit pension plan dominates the decision to retire early.\nDoes Medicare coverage encourage the sharp drop in employment\nat age sixty-five? Several studies have reported that the existence of\nemployer-sponsored health insurance for retirees is an incentive to\nretire prior to Medicare eligibility, but others have failed to find this\neffect.27 Robin Lumsdaine and colleagues report that those with re-\ntiree medical coverage, who presumably have no stronger incentive\nto postpone retirement to age sixty-five than do those without, are\nactually more likely to retire at exactly age sixty-five.28\nOn balance, it would seem unlikely that improved health status\nwill provide major relief to Medicare's financial problems. The evi-\ndence of a sustained trend toward improvement is lacking. There is\nample evidence that much of the older population wants to retire as\nsoon as it is economically feasible.\nMales Females\nAge in March\nPercent\nemployed\nPercent full\nyear full time Wages\nPercent\nemployed\nPercent full\nyear full time Wages\nSOURCE: March 1997 Current Population Survey.\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ V o l u m e 1 8 , N u m b e r 1\nM e d i c a r e B e n e f i c i a r i e s\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

None of these seems particularly likely. The\ncommonly prescribed fix of delaying retirement rates appears to\noffer at best minor relief. The population ages sixty-five to sixty-\nnine makes up about a quarter of Medicare enrollment; because\nthese persons are younger than average (and thus incur lower costs),\nremoving them from the program would bring savings of less than 15\npercent of program costs. Encouraging older persons to continue\nworking also does not help very much. Even if labor-force participa-\ntion rates at ages sixty-five to sixty-nine were to double, Medicare\nprogram income would increase less than 5 percent.\nFew good examples exist in the private sector on which to model\nMedicare financial reform. Prefunding (that is, accumulating assets\nduring one's active years for later use) is the traditional method for\nassuring fixed-dollar commitments such as death benefits and an-\nnuities. State laws, in fact, require prefunding for these private in-\nsurance products. But the Medicare trust funds retain no assets on\nbehalf of those who have paid taxes to support the present cohort of\nbeneficiaries. They serve only as temporary contingency reserves.\nSome individual medical insurance plans prefund for the ex-\npected rise in cost due to aging, but this has always been a trivial\npart of the inflation risk, which has been deemed intractable. With\nmedical costs increasing less rapidly in recent years, the inflation\nrisk starts to look more manageable, and the prospect of lessening\nthe demographic risk may be worth a second look.\nVarious forms of prefunding also are now under consideration for\nthe Social Security cash benefit programs. The most publicized of\nthe Social Security prefunding proposals would have the individual\ncontributor retain rights to the funds, but this is not a necessary part\nof the concept. To deal with the demographic risk, the age cohort of\ncontributors would retain \"rights\" to the assets. Nor is it necessary\nto prefund for the entire risk. In the cited case of individual medical\ninsurance, the policyholder group pays additional premiums in ad-\nvance to protect against premium increases later that are due to age,\nbut added premiums are charged later to account for medical infla-\ntion. In a public program the inflation risk could be divided between\nthe beneficiary and the taxpayers.\nPrefunding raises the awkward problem of a suitable prefunding\nvehicle. If prefunding merely results in purchasing government\nBENEFICIARIES\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ J a n u a r y / F e b r u a r y 1 9 9 9\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

One can certainly argue that public\ninvestment in infrastructure has a real payoff that enhances the\nnation's ability to meet its future social obligations, but current\naccounting of social insurance funds blurs any such connection and\nleads to the possibility of using presumably dedicated income for\ncurrent consumption.\nThe author thanks Alice Wade for her assistance and two reviewers for their\nextensive help.\nNOTES\n1.

For Medicare costs I divided the Part A and Part B combined cost for each sex\nin five-year age groups by the total (not just Medicare) population in that age\ngroup. This might be viewed as the premium that each age group has to pay to\nsupport Medicare beneficiaries in the group. The average of all of these rates,\nweighted by the population in each age/sex group, gives the average \"pre-\nmium\" that must be paid by each member of society to support the Medicare\nprogram. This would now be about $800 annually (Medicare benefits outlays\nfor 1998 are projected to be about $223 billion, with a total U.S. population of\nabout 280 million). The fixed age/sex-specific rates are then applied to the\nministration's population projections under the 1998 trustees' reports. For\nearnings I used the March 1997 Current Population Survey (CPS) to calculate\nearnings per person in the same age/sex groups as used for Medicare cost and\ncalculated average income per capita.\n8.
