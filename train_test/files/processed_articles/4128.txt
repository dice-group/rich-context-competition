The first experiment demonstrates that different patterns of breathing\ninfluence susceptibility to contagious yawning. When participants were not directed how\nto breathe or were instructed to breathe orally (inhaling and exhaling through their\nmouth), the incidence of contagious yawning in response to seeing videotapes of people\nyawning was about 48%. When instructed to breathe nasally (inhaling and exhaling\nthrough their nose), no participants exhibited contagious yawning.

In humans, yawning begins in utero by 20\nweeks gestation (Sherer, Smith, and Abramowicz, 1991) and continues throughout life.\nPeople typically close their eyes at the peak of a yawn, and a single yawn can last for as\nlong as 10 seconds (Daquin, Micallef, and Blin, 2001). Yawning is commonly\naccompanied by stretching and occurs most frequently before sleep and after waking\n(Provine, Hamernik, and Curchack, 1987). Yawning has long been associated with\nboredom and sleep. Under laboratory conditions subjects yawn more frequently after\nYawning as a Brain Cooling Mechanism\nwatching uninteresting color patterns than music videos (Provine and Hamernik, 1986).\nYawning is widespread and has been recorded in many vertebrates (Baenninger, 1987).\nIn some primates there is a special category of yawning that functions as a threat display\n(Hinde and Tinbergen, 1958; Tinbergen, 1952). Display yawns expose canine teeth, and\nunlike normal yawns the yawner keeps their eyes open during the yawning episode to\nmonitor the effect of the yawn on the target subject.\nYawning is under the central control of several neurotransmitters and\nneuropeptides including dopamine, excitatory amino acids, acetylcholine, serotonin,\nnitric oxide, adrenocorticotropic hormone-related peptides and oxytocin (Argiolas and\nMelis, 1998). Yawning can be drug-induced, and drugs are especially effective when\ninjections are made into the hypothalamus (Dourish and Cooper, 1990). Apomorphine\ninjections have been reported to produce drug-induced yawning along with penile\nerection in male mice (Melis, Argiolas, and Gessa, 1987).\nThere have been many attempts to identify the function(s) of yawning in humans\n(Smith, 1999). However, the adaptive/functional/biological significance of yawning has\nyet to be established (Provine, 2005). It has long been thought (and is still commonly\nmisconstrued) that the function of a yawn is to increase O2 levels in the blood. However,\nbreathing increased levels of oxygen or carbon dioxide do not affect yawning (Provine,\nYawning is contagious. Seeing, hearing, thinking or reading about yawning can\ntrigger yawns, and attempts to shield a yawn do not stop its contagion (Provine, 2005).\nUnder laboratory conditions, slightly less than half of college students yawn contagiously,\nand individual differences in susceptibility to contagious yawning have been shown to be\nrelated to differences in processing information about oneself (Platek, Critton, Myers, and\nGallup, 2003). Witnessing people yawn activates parts of the brain also associated with\nself-processing (Platek, Mohamed, and Gallup, 2005).\nHere we investigate the physiological significance of yawning in humans,\nspecifically whether yawning may function as a thermoregulatory mechanism. We\npropose that yawning serves to keep the brain in thermal homeostasis, and that yawning\nserves to maintain optimal mental efficiency. We believe that yawning serves as a\ncompensatory cooling mechanism when regulatory mechanisms fail to operate favorably.\nIn order to test this hypothesis, we conducted two separate experiments designed to\nindirectly manipulate brain temperature. Based on evidence supporting the selective\nbrain cooling model (du Boulay, Lawton, and Wallis, 2000; Mariak, White, Lewko,\nCabanac and Caputa, 1979), we choose to manipulate breathing conditions and forehead\ntemperature by noninvasive means. Nasal breathing (du Boulay, Lawton, and Wallis,\nhave been shown to be involved in the thermoregulation (cooling) of the brain.\nContagious yawning was used as a proxy for yawning in both these experiments\nfor two reasons. Contagious yawning is indistinguishable from spontaneous yawning\naside from the fact that the triggers differ, and contagious yawning can be manipulated\nunder laboratory conditions (e.g., Platek et al., 2003).\nExperiment 1: Breathing Manipulation\nYawning as a Brain Cooling Mechanism\nThe first experiment investigated whether different methods of breathing would\naffect the occurrence of contagious yawning, and was approved by the local Institutional\nReview Board. Breathing was the focus of this experiment because of its influence on\nMethods\nParticipants\nParticipants were 44 undergraduate students at the University of Albany. Twenty-\nseven participants were male and 17 were female, and all were eighteen to twenty-five\nyears of age.\nProcedure\nEach participant signed a consent form, and was asked to step into a room and sit\nby themselves in front of a computer screen. Each participant was then instructed to\neither inhale and exhale strictly orally, strictly nasally, strictly orally while wearing a\nnose plug, or allowed to breathe normally (i.e., not instructed how to breathe) during the\nexperiment. Eleven participants were randomly assigned to each of the four breathing\nconditions.\nParticipants were told to breathe in the manner instructed for a period of two\nminutes prior to and while watching a brief video tape lasting two minutes and fifty\nseconds. This same video was used in a previous contagious yawning study by Platek et\nal. (2003). The video consisted of 24 7-s digital videos of eight volunteers (four male,\nfour female), each depicting three separate conditions (neutral, laughing or yawning).\nThese videos were presented in random order on the computer screen to each participant\nusing Microsoft Media Player.\nEach participant was observed through a one-way mirror by a researcher who\nrecorded their yawns. At the conclusion of the video presentation, participants were\nasked whether they had yawned during the experiment. Two of the participants (one in\nthe oral group and one in the normal breathing group) who did not show detectable signs\nof a yawn, each reported yawning once. These self-reported instances of yawning were\nincluded in the data set.\nResults\nFigure 1 shows the distribution of yawning across all four groups. There were no\nyawns in the nasal breathing group. In all other groups, at least 45% of viewers yawned\nat least once. In the strictly oral breathing group (not the nose plug condition), 54% of\nviewers yawned at least once.\nThere were no significant effects of gender on yawning. Of the 16 yawners (9\nmale, seven female), six yawned several times (two male, four female). Multiple\nyawning occurred most frequently in the two oral breathing conditions. The average\nnumber of yawns per group ranged from three yawns per person in the oral group to 1.2\nyawns per person in the normal breathing group. Frequency of yawns between groups\nyawning in the oral and nasal breathing groups also differed significantly, 2(1) = 6.00,\nYawning as a Brain Cooling Mechanism\np<.02. Using a binomial test based on the frequency of contagious yawning (41.5%)\nreported by Platek et al. (2003), the absence of yawning in the nasal breathing group was\nBreathing Experiment\nOral Nose Plug Nasal Normal\nBreathing Condition\nNumber\nPeople who yawned\nTotal yawns\nFigure 1: Number of people out of eleven in each group who yawned and total number\nof yawns as a function of breathing condition.\nExperiment 2: Forehead Temperature Manipulation\nThe second experiment investigated whether forehead cooling had an impact on\nthe occurrence of contagious yawning. Forehead temperature was the focus of this\nexperiment because of its influence on brain temperature (Zenker and Kubik, 1996).\nParticipants\nParticipants consisted of an additional sample of 33 undergraduate students at the\nUniversity of Albany. Twenty participants were female and 13 were male, and all were\neighteen to twenty-five years of age.\nProcedure\nAfter each participant signed a consent form, they were asked to step into the\nsame room used in the previous experiment and were seated in front of the same\ncomputer screen. Each participant was then either instructed to hold a warm pack, a cold\npack, or a pack at room temperature to their forehead during this experiment, which\nlasted for the same length of time as the previous experiment (4 min, 50sec). Eleven\nparticipants were randomly assigned to each condition.\nYawning as a Brain Cooling Mechanism\nEach pack consisted of a hand towel folded over a few times and placed into a\nZiploc plastic bag. To influence the temperature of the hot and cold packs, the hand\ntowel was soaked in either warm water (46 oC) or cold water (4 oC) before being placed\ninto the plastic bag. Temperature of the water and packs was monitored using a digital\nthermometer. The hot and cold packs were all within one degree Celsius of the intended\ntemperature for every participant at the beginning of the testing procedure. The room\ntemperature condition was achieved by placing a separate, dry towel into the plastic bag.\nParticipants were instructed to hold the pack to their forehead for a period of two\nminutes prior to the video, and to continue holding the pack to their forehead for the\nduration of the video. The same video from the first study was shown to the participants\non a computer screen using Windows Media Player.\nEach participant was observed through a one-way mirror by a researcher who\nrecorded the incidence of yawning. Two of the participants (one in the cold pack group\nand one in the hot pack group) who did not show detectable signs of a yawn, each\nreported yawning once. These self-reported instances of yawning were included in\nsubsequent analyses.\nResults\nOnly one participant yawned in the cold pack group (see Figure 2), which was a\nself-reported but not independently verified instance. In the other two groups 41% of the\nparticipants yawned at least once. In the hot pack group, 36% of the participants yawned,\nwhile in the room temperature condition, 45% of the participants yawned. Eighteen\nyawns were recorded in the hot and room temperature groups while only one self-\nreported yawn was recorded in the cold condition.\nThere were no significant effects of gender on yawning. Of the 10 people who\nyawned, three yawned more than once (two male, one female). Figure 2 shows the\ndistribution of yawning across all three groups. Of the people who yawned, the average\nnumber of yawns ranged from 2.25 per person in the warm pack group to one yawn per\nperson in the cold pack group. The difference in number of yawns between groups was\noccurrence of contagious yawning, a binomial test applied to the number of people\nyawning in the cold pack group was also significant, p = .0199.\nYawning as a Brain Cooling Mechanism\nTemperature Experiment\nWarm Pack Cold Pack Room\nTemperature\nTemperature Condition\nNumber\nPeople who yawned\nTotal yawns\nFigure 2: Number of people who yawned and the total number of yawns as a function of\nforehead temperature condition.\nGeneral Discussion\nDifferent methods of breathing had a significant effect on the incidence of\ncontagious yawning. Nasal breathing antagonized contagious yawning, while\nparticipants in the other breathing conditions yawned around 48% of the time.\nManipulating forehead temperature also had a significant effect on the occurrence of\ncontagious yawning. A cold pack held to the forehead greatly reduced contagious\nyawning, while warm and room temperature packs had no effect.\nThe two conditions thought to promote brain cooling (nasal breathing and\nforehead cooling), practically eliminated contagious yawning. Only one out of a total of\n22 combined participants in the nasal breathing and forehead cooling conditions yawned,\nand that participant showed only one self-reported, but not independent verified instance\nof yawning. In the other conditions, 25 out of 55 participants yawned for a total of 51\nyawns.\nThe manipulations involved in the breathing experiment are related to those done\nin a study by Provine (1986), where participants were instructed to think about yawning\nwhile clenching their teeth. Clenched teeth yawns were rated as abnormal and less\nsatisfying, however clenching the teeth did not block yawns. Yawning still occurred as\noften as in baseline conditions and the duration of these yawns was not significantly\ndifferent. This suggests that it was not simply the immobilization of the jaw in the nasal\nbreathing group that eliminated yawning (even though the participants were not\ninstructed to close their mouths, they were instructed to inhale and exhale nasally).\nBased on evidence that clenching the teeth does not block yawning (Provine,\nYawning as a Brain Cooling Mechanism\n1986), we submit that it is the breathing manipulation (and the corresponding\nthermoregulation effects: see below) that alter the incidence in contagious yawning and\nnot the difference between an opened or closed jaw.\nBrain Cooling Model\nany physiological consequences that are concordant with those\noregulation has been strongly linked to structures of the hypothalamus\nhas been shown to increase\nathing antagonized yawning is consistent with the\nrmo\nYawning has m\nneeded for the regulation of brain temperature. The constriction and relaxation of facial\nmuscles during yawning increases facial blood flow and these changes alter cerebral\nblood flow (Zajonc, 1985). Yawning causes an overall increase in blood pressure\n(Arkenasy, 1996), arousal as measured by skin conductance (Greco and Baenninger,\n1991), and heart rate (Heusner, 1946); all of which promote increased blood flow during\nthe period immediately prior to yawning. Research by Cabanac and Brinnel (1985)\nshows that during hyperthermia (exercise-induced heat stress), blood flow is increased\nfrom the skin of the head into the cranial cavity, and this increase is essential for proper\ncooling of the brain. Similar physiological consequences occur during powerful\nstretching, and yawning is accompanied by stretching almost half the time (Provine,\nHamernik, and Curchack, 1987). This increase in blood flow and cerebral blood flow (as\na result of yawning) function like a radiator to produce alteration of temperature in the\nbrain. Likewise, the gaping of the mouth and deep inhalation of cool air taken into the\nlungs during a yawn can alter the temperature of the blood in the brain through\nconvection.\nTherm\n(Cooper, 2002). Some recent research using tissue slices pinpoints the complex circuits\nwithin the hypothalamus serving thermoregulation (Boulant, 1996). Interestingly,\nyawning also appears to be regulated by the hypothalamus. Yawning is under the control\nof many neurotransmitter and neuropeptides, and the interaction of these substances in\nthe nucleus of the hypothalamus can facilitate or inhibit yawning respectively (Argiolas\nand Melis, 1998). Dopamine is a common neurotransmitter that is released by the\nhypothalamus. When injected into the brain, dopamine agonists (compounds that\nactivate dopamine receptors) not only produce yawning (Collins, Witkin, Newman,\nSvensson, Cao, Grundt, and Woods, 2005), but have also been shown to increase heat\nAcute dopamine/norepinephrine reuptake inhibition\nboth brain and core temperature in rats (Hasegawa, Meeusen, Sarre, Diltoer, Piacentini,\nand Michotte, 2005). Prolonged sleep deprivation in rats also produces increases in brain\ntemperature (Everson, Smith, and Sokoloff, 1994). Interestingly, yawning is ordinarily\nassociated with being sleepy or tired, and a common symptom on many sleep deprivation\nchecklists is excessive yawning.\nThe fact that nasal bre\nthe regulatory hypothesis. Nasal breathing has been identified as one of the three\nputative mechanisms involved in cooling the brain. The vertebral venous plexus, which\nis located in the brainstem, is cooled by the vertebral artery as a result of nasal breathing\n(du Boulay, Lawton, and Wallis, 2000). Nasal breathing also cools other parts of the\nbrain, including the frontal cortex (Mariak et al., 1999). Nasal mucosal blood flow\ndecreases in response to skin cooling, increases in response to skin warming, and it rises\nin response to increases in core temperature (McIntosh, Zajonc, Vig, and Emerick, 1997).\nYawning as a Brain Cooling Mechanism\nWe suggest that the cerebral cooling stimulated by nasal breathing was strong enough to\ninhibit mechanisms that would normally trigger yawning.\nCooling the forehead simulates a combination of the other two mechanisms\nredictions of the Model\nis evidence we propose that yawning has a thermoregulatory\nlt mental\nwning should\ncknowledgment: The authors thank Jessica Wess for help reviewing the literature.\nthought to cool the brain, one being cooling of venous blood by the skin which in turn\ncools the arterial (carotid) blood supply to the brain. The other major brain cooling\nmechanism is the dissipation of heat through facial emissary veins (Zenker and Kubik,\ndensity of sweat glands on the forehead is three times that of the rest of the body\n(Cabanac, 1986) and under normal conditions, blood from the face and forehead would\nbe cooled by evaporation of sweat from the face and scalp.\nP\nOn the basis of th\nfunction, and that yawning evolved to promote/maintain mental efficiency by keeping\nbrain temperature in homeostasis. There are several other ways to test this model. For\ninstance, we predict that yawning should be influenced by variation in ambient\ntemperature. We predict that as ambient temperatures approach body temperature,\nyawning should diminish, and once temperature exceeds body temperature yawning\nshould stop. If yawning functions to regulate brain temperature, yawning above 37oC\nwould warm the brain and would be counterproductive unless the individual is in a\nhypothermic state. Conversely, when ambient temperature drops below a certain point,\nperhaps -10oC, yawning could produce a thermal shock by sending a wave of unusually\ncold blood to the brain. It follows that when people develop a fever, yawning should stop.\nThat is, when body temperatures exceed normal values, it may simulate conditions\nordinarily associated with an increase in ambient temperature above 37oC and activate\nmechanisms that inhibit yawning. This may be the reason the application of the warm\npack to the forehead in Experiment 2 failed to stimulate an increase in yawning.\nWe also predict yawning to increase when people are engaged in difficu\ntasks. Increased cortical metabolic activity associated with higher information processing\nloads would increase brain temperature and trigger compensatory yawning. It has been\nnoted that yawning occurs frequently in transition periods from inactivity to activity and\nvice versa (Baenninger, Binkley, and Baenninger, 1996; Provine, Hamernik, and\nCurchack, 1987), which is consistent with the idea that yawning plays a role in mental\nefficiency. It has also been argued that the contraction of facial muscles during a yawn\nforces blood through cerebral blood vessels to the brain, which may function to increase\nAccording to our hypothesis, rather than promoting sleep, ya\nantagonize sleep. It has been widely believed that yawning in the presence of others is\ndisrespectful and a sign of boredom (e.g., witness the fact that many people cover their\nmouths when they yawn). However, according to our account yawning more accurately\nreflects a mechanism that maintains attention. Likewise, when someone yawns in a\ngroup setting as evidence for diminished mental processing efficiency, contagious\nyawning may have evolved to promote the maintenance of vigilance.\nA\nYawning as a Brain Cooling Mechanism\neferences\nrgiolas, A., and Melis, M.R.
