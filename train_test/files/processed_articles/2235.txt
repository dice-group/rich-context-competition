However, the translation of research into clinical pre-\ndiction has been slow. Although several prognostic tools are\navailable (7\u00ad12), they are often resource intensive or require\ntrained assessors (7\u00ad11). Some focused on mortality (12).\nMoreover, previous research did not consider the dynamic\nnature of disability or competing events that alter the risk of\ndisability. In the era of health-care reform, identifying indi-\nviduals who are more likely to lose their ability to live inde-\npendently and utilize more resources is crucial to achieve\nmore appropriate care, cost control, and meaningful use of\nresources.\nThis study aimed to develop and validate a practical tool\nthat predicts 5-year risk of severe, persistent loss of indepen-\ndence in performing ADLs in a large representative cohort\nof community-dwelling older adults, using information that\ncan be easily obtained in a general practice setting.\nStudy population\nThis study used data from the Established Populations for\nEpidemiologic Studies of the Elderly (EPESE), a prospective\nAmerican Journal of Epidemiology\n\u00a9 The Author 2013.

The details of study design\nand conduct were described elsewhere (14\u00ad16). Participants\nup interviews for 6 years. Because additional interviews beyond\n6 years were conducted in selected cohorts with varying inter-\nvals, we used data up to the sixth annual follow-up. After\nexcluding 248 participants with missing data on more than\ndependence at baseline, 12,478 participants were included\nin this analysis. The institutional review boards at Beth Israel\nDeaconess Medical Center and Hebrew SeniorLife exempted\nthis study.\nDefinition of ADL dependence and other outcomes\nDisability in 7 ADLs was self-reported at baseline and\nsubsequent annual interviews, using the following question:\n\"Other than when you have been in a hospital, was there any\ntime in the past 12 months when you needed help from\nsome person or equipment to do . . . (each of the following\nactivities)?\" for walking across a small room, bathing or\nshower, personal grooming, dressing, eating, getting from a\nbed to a chair, or using the toilet. Whether the help was from\nanother person, equipment, or both was also asked: We con-\nsidered requiring personal assistance to define ADL depen-\ndence. The event of interest was severe, persistent ADL\ndependence, defined as requiring personal help in 3 ADLs\nfor at least 2 consecutive annual interviews or for 1 interview\nfollowed by death in the subsequent year to capture pro-\nlonged, severe disability status that is comparable to requir-\ning a significant amount of personal assistance or nursing\nhome care. Those who died during the follow-up without\nsevere, persistent ADL dependence were considered as hav-\ning experienced the competing event (refer to \"Statistical\nanalysis\" below). As our outcome was defined on the basis\nof ADL status in 2 consecutive annual interviews, the fifth\nyear was the last possible time in which the outcome could\noccur. Our definition of disability reduces misclassification\nfrom self-report and is more strongly associated with adverse\noutcomes and resource utilization than other definitions (e.g.,\nself-reported difficulty, impairment in any ADLs, or disability\nVital status was obtained through obituaries, hospitaliza-\ntion records, proxy interviews, and death certificates. Hos-\npitalizations during the past 12 months were self-reported\n(yes/no) for selected conditions (myocardial infarction,\nstroke, cancer, and fracture). Assuming that each condition\nwas associated with a distinct hospitalization, we summed\nthe number of hospitalizations for 5 years.\nPotential predictors\nWe chose 30 potential predictors of ADL disability that\nwere identified from literature and collected via question-\nnaire and in-person assessment in the EPESE (Web Table 1\navailable at http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/). Multiple response\ncategories for certain predictors were collapsed to ensure a\nsufficient number of events in each category, to improve\ninterpretability, and to reduce model complexity without\ncompromising model fit. Cognitive function was measured by\nusing the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (22), a\nvalidated instrument that comprises 10 questions on memory,\norientation, current events, and a mathematical task. Cog-\nnitive function was classified as \"normal\" if the number of\nerrors was 2; \"mild\" if 3 or 4; and \"moderate to severe\" if\n5 (22). A cutpoint of 3 errors corresponds to the Mini-\nMental Status Examination score of 23 (23). Because physical\nperformance was measured at the sixth annual examination\nin the EPESE cohort, we used self-reported physical func-\ntion obtained from questionnaires. These measures have been\nshown to be reproducible and validated against performance-\nStatistical analysis\nAll analyses were performed in Stata/SE 11.2 software\n(StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas). Two-sided P < 0.05\nwas considered statistically significant. The data set was ran-\navalidation cohort (1/3; n = 4,177). Characteristics were com-\npared between the 2 cohorts by using the t test or Wilcoxon\nrank-sum test for continuous variables and the Pearson 2\ntest for categorical variables.\nMissing data imputation. For those who had any interval\nmissing on the number of ADL dependencies (7.4%), we\nimputed the missing values with the last nonmissing values\nfor that individual carried forward. At baseline, 2.7% had\nmissing data on more than 5 predictors. We implemented\nmultivariable imputation that used all baseline variables, the\ntime-to-event variable, and outcome status.\nModel development. We used cause-specific propor-\ntional hazards regression to model the time to first occur-\nrence of severe, persistent ADL dependence as a function of\npredictors, while accounting for death without severe, per-\nsistent ADL dependence as a competing event that prevents\nthe occurrence of our outcome of interest (26\u00ad28). Because\nthe exact event dates were not available, we assumed that they\noccurred at the midpoint between the 2 interviews.\nIn selecting predictors, we initially fitted a model with all\n30 predictors in the derivation cohort, using severe, persis-\ntent ADL dependence as the outcome, and carried out back-\nward elimination to find a model with the minimal Schwarz\nBayesian Information Criterion (29). Because the propor-\ntional hazards assumption was violated for age categories,\nwe fitted age-stratified Cox models. Categorical variables were\nmodeled ordinally, if monotonic relationships existed and\nlikelihood ratio tests favored a more parsimonious model\nover the model with indicator terms. Any significant interac-\ntion terms among age, sex, and other predictors that resulted\nin a lower Bayesian Information Criterion were retained.\nModel performance. In the derivation and validation\ncohorts, calibration was assessed by calibration plots and the\ngoodness-of-fit 2 statistic (30). Discrimination was evalu-\nated by C statistics that were modified to the context of com-\npeting risk such that individuals who failed from competing\nevents remained in the risk set at all times (28).\nCalculation of risk score. To facilitate clinical applica-\ntion, we developed a scoring system by assigning a score to\neach predictor in proportion to its regression coefficient in\nour final model. We assessed a potential loss in discrimina-\ntion by comparing the C statistic from the risk score with\nthat from the model. According to the distribution of the risk\nscore in the derivation cohort, participants were classified\ninto tertiles of risk score: low (from 0 to 7); moderate (from\n8 to 15); and high (16). For each category, we calculated\nthe observed absolute risk of severe, persistent ADL depen-\ndence (event of interest) and death without severe, persistent\nADL dependence (competing event), as well as the risk of\nbeing free of both events in the derivation and validation\ncohorts. In secondary analyses, we estimated the 5-year risk\nof any or recurrent hospitalizations for selected conditions\n(myocardial infarction, stroke, cancer, and fracture), using\nPoisson regression with log follow-up time as the offset\nvariable.\nTable 1.

However, the\nmodel that included 8 predictors achieved the smallest Bayes-\nian Information Criterion (Table 2). Because the model was\nstratified by age because of violation of the proportional haz-\nards assumption, the association with age was not directly\nestimable from the model.

The age-specific risk tertiles and\ncorresponding risk of severe, persistent ADL dependence\n(Figure 2) are useful in assessing an individual's absolute\nrisk as well as relative risk compared with others of similar\nage. Forexample, aman aged 73 years whose risk score is over\n16 has 10.6% risk of developing severe, persistent ADL\ndependence in 5 years, which is approximately 3-fold higher\nthan the risk of an average person of his age and is as high as\nthat of an average person who is 10 years older.\nIn order to provide comprehensive prognostic information,\nwe summarized the 5-year risks of severe, persistent ADL\ndependence, death without severe persistent ADL dependence,\nand being alive without both events (Table 4). Those in\nthe upper tertile had higher risks of severe, persistent ADL\ndependence, as well as death without severe, persistent ADL\ndependence. The risk tertiles also predicted hospitalizations\nfor myocardial infarction, stroke, cancer, and fracture within\n5 years in a dose-dependent manner, particularly among\nyounger subgroups (Web Figure 2).\nDISCUSSION\nIn a representative population of nondisabled, community-\ndwelling, older adults, we developed and validated a simple\nrisk assessment model that predicted the 5-year risk of severe,\npersistent ADL dependence using age, 7 self-reported risk\nfactors, and cognitive function that can be easily obtained in a\ngeneral practice setting. This model provides the absolute risks\nof severe, persistent ADL dependence and death without ADL\ndependence that can be useful in personalized prognostica-\ntion and care planning. Although we recognize that the age\nof the data set (ADL data collected 20\u00ad25 years ago) is a\nmajor limitation for clinical use of our model for contempo-\nrary older adults, several features of our approach deserve\nmention and enhance future research on prediction of dis-\nability in older adults.\nComparison with existing models that predict disability\nSeveral frailty indices and validated risk assessment models\npredict ADL disability in community-dwelling older adults\n(Web Table 3). The amount and source of information needed\nfor risk calculation vary across the models. The frailty index\nSurvey-13 (35, 36) screened a wide range of potential predic-\ntors, whereas the Cardiovascular Health Study index (8), the\nStudy of Osteoporotic Fracture index (37, 38), and the Short\nPhysical Performance Battery (9, 39) mainly focused on phys-\nical performance with or without other predictors. Although\nvariations in outcome definitions and health status of study\npopulations do not allow a direct comparison among these\nCompared with existing models, our model has several\nstrengths. We estimated the absolute risk of severe, persistent\nADL dependence that is meaningful to clinicians, patients,\nand policy makers, in the presence of competing event.\nAlthough disability is a dynamic status, the severity and dura-\ntion of ADL disability have rarely been considered in previous\nresearch. In a cohort of community-dwelling older adults,\napproximately 80% of the newly disabled recovered indepen-\ndence within 12 months, and the recovery rate was lower as\nthe severity was higher (40). Self-reported dependence was\nmore closely linked to hospitalizations and resource use than\nself-reported difficulty (19). Dependence in 3 ADLs was\nassociated with an over 3-fold increase in institutionalization\nwithin 2\u00ad3 years (18). Thus, our model is likely to capture the\nmost impaired subgroup of this older population with a greater\nlikelihood of adverse health events that can affect quality of\nlife and drive health-care expenditure.\nIn building our model, we considered multiple biological\nand psychosocial risk factors of ADL disability to represent\nheterogeneous disabling processes in community-dwelling\nolder adults. Physical performance (e.g., gait speed) predicts\nADL disability, but it was not measured at the EPESE base-\nline. Biomarkers and imaging studies may provide additional\nprognostic information with incremental costs. Our objective\nwas to develop a model based on information that can be easily\nobtained without additional resources and costs in a busy prac-\ntice setting (e.g., interview and routine physical examination in\na clinic room) for a broader application. Our model showed C\nstatistics across subgroups that were similar to other resource-\nintensive models (Table 3 and Web Table 3).\nPotential implications for clinical care\nPhysicians often feel unsure about when and how to initi-\nate a discussion about advance care planning, particularly\nTable 3.

Routine use of a prognostic tool during a\nprimary care visit can offer an opportunity to discuss prog-\nnosis and advance care planning, regardless of the levels of\npredicted risk (42). Unlike existing prognostic indices based\non mortality (12), our model provides more comprehensive\nprognostic information on the risks of both severe disability\nand mortality within 5 years. At the individual level, clini-\ncians can use this information to prioritize competing health\nissues and reset the goals of preventive care and chronic\ndisease management. For high-risk adults, the focus should\nbe minimizing avoidable harms and maintaining quality of\nlife and function; for low-risk to moderate-risk adults, the\nfocus should be increasing life expectancy and preventing dis-\nability. Importantly, almost one third of adults aged 80 years\nor more are in the low-risk group. They should not be excluded\nfrom preventive care and aggressive chronic disease manage-\nment, based on age alone. At the health-care system level,\npractice-based interventions that target these individuals may\nreduce hospitalizations and health-care costs.\nLimitations\nOur study did not examine whether using a risk model\nleads to better clinical outcomes. Because our goal was to\npredict severe disability that was comparable to nursing\nFigure 2.

Thus, the\neffect estimates from our model (Table 2) cannot be inter-\npreted as the expected reduction in disability risk with modi-\nfication of predictors. Moreover, the discriminatory ability\nof our model was lower in older age. In older age, C statistics\nfrom the full model with all 30 predictors were almost the\nsame as those from our final model, suggesting that addi-\ntional self-reported information is unlikely to improve dis-\ncrimination. Further improvement by physical performance\nor biomarkers remains possible. Future studies should exam-\nine an incremental value of physical performance tests or\nbiomarkers, using our model as a referent model.\nThere is mixed evidence on how the disability patterns\nhave changed in older Americans during the past 2 decades\n(43, 44). The relations of socioeconomical (e.g., currently\nworking at a paying job) or biological risk factors (e.g., dia-\nbetes mellitus or stroke) with disability might have changed\nover time. Therefore, recalibration of absolute risk, as well\nas validation in a contemporary cohort, is necessary before\nwidespread application of our model. In addition, hospitali-\nzations were self-reported for selected conditions that accounted\nfor 16% of total hospitalizations among older Americans\nmethod for interval missing data on ADL dependence might\nhave underestimated the incidence of ADL dependence and\ndiscrimination of our risk model, if those who did not\nrespond to the interview had worsening disability.\nConclusions\nA practical risk assessment tool that uses routinely avail-\nable clinical information can predict severe, persistent disabil-\nity that has important implications for quality of life, resource\nutilization, and health-care expenditure. Future research should\nvalidate our model in an independent cohort, examine the addi-\ntional improvement in prediction by measurements of physical\nperformance and biomarkers, and evaluate clinical outcomes\nof a comprehensive program that incorporates our risk model.\n"
