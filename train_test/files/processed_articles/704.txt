Corey _________________\nPrologue: Most Americans believe that health care should be avail-\nable toall those who are sick or injured, regardless ofeconomic or\nother circumstances. At the same time, most Americans consider the\ncost ofmedical care as the most troubling dimension ofthe provision of\nthis service, and believe that cost constraints should be applied. Where\nto make such reductions without erasing the gains achieved inaccess\ntocare over the last several decades, or hurting the leastfortunate\namong us, isthe issue. Inthis lead essay, Howard Freeman and his\ncolleagues report signs of deterioration inaccess to medical carefor the\nnations poor, minorities, and uninsured. Their study isthe third study\nonaccess underwritten by The Robert WoodJohnson Foundation.\nThe two previous access studies, ironically, provoked substantially dif-\nferent reactions, stemming morefrom a change inthepolitical climate\nthanfrom thefindings themselves. At the time ofthefirst survey, 1976,\nnational health insurance (NHI) legislation was a live issue. Its advo\ncates were critical of the survey results because they showed many\nmore people with access tocare than NHI rhetoric suggested. Inthe\nmore constrained climate of 1982, the second survey provoked criti-\ncismfrom conservative quarters because ithighlighted the relatively\nsmall number ofpeople who lacked access to care. The lead author of\nthis most recent survey is a professor ofsociology at the University of\nCalifornia, Los Angeles (UCLA).

There were many press\naccounts at the time about the difficulties Americans experienced ob\ntaining medical care, but there was little timely and systematic informa\ntion about the overall magnitude of the problem, its distribution among\nvarious population groups, and changes over time. To acquire this\ninformation, the Johnson Foundation supported three independent\nindividuals were experiencing problems obtaining medical care.1These\nsurveys built on a research approach first implemented by the Commit\ntee on the Costs of Medical Care in the early 1930s, which was later\nextended and refined by Odin Anderson, Ronald Andersen, and their\ncolleagues at the University of Chicago.2\nThis paper highlights results from the recently completed 1986 survey\nof access to and use of health services.3 Six findings are of particular\nmedical care declined in terms of hospitalization and per capita physician\nvisits. (2) Access to physician care for individuals who were poor, black,\npoor health. (3) Hospitalizations have also declined for these disad\nvantaged groups, but the reduction is comparable to that experienced by\nthe entire population. However, the uninsured and black and Hispanic\nAmericans continue to receive less hospital care than might be appropri\nate given their higher rates of ill health. (4) Though much has been\nwritten about the overuse of medical care, this study found signs of\nunderuse of important health services among key population groups. (5)\nThe long-standing gap in receipt of medical care between rural and urban\nresidents appears to have been eliminated. (6) Most Americans continue\nto be highly satisfied with their physician and inpatient hospital care. In\naddition, emergency care, which was a source of some dissatisfaction in\nMethods\nData reported in this article come from two telephone surveys con\nEach respondent was interviewed for approximately twenty-five minutes\nabout various aspects of access to medical care: the availability of a\npersonal physician or usual source of care; the actual use of doctors,\nother health professionals, and hospitals; self-reports of health status;\nthe presence of serious health conditions; problems in paying for care;\nand the degree of satisfaction with the care received.

The\nfindings of this survey confirm, as others have concluded, that if house\nholds without telephones were added to those surveyed by telephone,\nthe findings would not be significantly different.4\ncontinental United States, 76 percent of those selected for interviews.5\nPeople with chronic and serious illnesses were oversampled; the study\ngroup was weighted, however, so that the findings represent the U.S.\npopulation. Proxy interviews with a parent were conducted in order to\nobtain information on children under age seventeen. Also in cases where\nthe respondent was too sick or otherwise unable to be interviewed, a\nproxy interview with another person in the household was completed.\nThe 1982 data are from the previous foundation-supported survey\nundertaken by Louis Harris and Associates in conjunction with the\nUniversity of Chicago.6 The study group consisted of approximately\npurposes of this analysis to be consistent with the procedures used for the\nhere and in previous publications from the study.\nThe average number of physician visits reported in these two surveys\ndiffers somewhat from those reported by the National Center for Health\nStatistics because telephone consultations are not counted as visits in our\ntwo surveys. Also, the interviewers in our surveys probed to gain in\nformation on all visits to specialists, including mental health profes\nsionals, in 1986, which is not usually done in other national surveys.\nDecline In The Use Of Medical Care\nacross all population groups. As illustrated in Exhibit 1, the percentage\nof Americans hospitalized one or more times in the year prior to the\nsurvey declined by 22 percent. One-third of Americans did not visit a\nphysician even once in the year prior to the survey, a major change since\n1982.

It should be noted, however, that mean physician\nvisit rates reported in the 1982 survey were higher than other studies\nundertaken that year, including the Health Interview Survey.7Hence, the\nsomewhat the actual decline in physician utilization.\nOver the past two decades, a larger proportion of Americans have\nreported having access to a regular source of care, usually a particular\nprivate physician.8Studies have suggested that patients may receive more\nappropriate and effective health care when they have a single source for\ncare--a place where there is some continuing knowledge of their health\nstatus and problems over time.9However, as Exhibit 1 shows, a larger\nsingle usual source of care (18 percent compared to 11 percent). Even\namong people who report having a usual source of care, there appears to\nbe more use of multiple physicians and settings. For example, of those\nwho had a particular personal physician in 1982, 95 percent reported\nseeing that doctor on their last visit. In 1986, only 79 percent went to their\nregular doctor on their last visit.\nThe surveys do not provide data that permit a full explanation of the\nreduced use of physician and hospital care. The changes are consistent,\nhowever, with a number of trends in health care nationally including\ngreater use of coinsurance and deductibles in private health insurance\nplans, increased out-of-pocket medical care costs, more widespread use of\nhospital preadmission screening, an increase in ambulatory surgery, and\nthe rapid growth of urgent care centers.\nDeteriorating Access For The Poor, Minorities, And Uninsured\nData on the number of visits people make to doctors' offices and\nhospitals do not tell us all we wish to know about the accessibility of\nhealth care in the United States. For example, visit rates tell us little\nabout the appropriateness of treatment received. Visit rates do provide\none window, however, on the accessibility of personal health services to\ndifferent groups in the country. Moreover, the usefulness of this measure\nof accessibility can be enhanced by taking into account individuals'\nrelative need for health care. The President's Commission for the Study\nof Ethical Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavioral Re\nsearch in its 1983 report recommended that adjustments be made for\nhealth status in all comparisons of physician utilization rates between\n0Earlier studies have shown that a person's self-assessment of\nhealth status is a reasonably sensitive indicator of actual need for medical\ncare, including the presence of chronic conditions and disabilities, the\nnumber of specific health problems and symptoms, sensory impairment\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 02, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

The gap is the percent difference between two groups using the\nmajority group as the standard against which the other is compared.\nLow-income Americans. The earliest access study, undertaken in\n1931, found that people with low incomes saw physicians 50 percent less\nfrequently than did those with higher incomes.1\n2This gap was of particu\nlar concern because of evidence that serious illness was more common\namong the poor. By the mid-1970s, after decades of gradual progress, this\ninequity in the frequency of use of physician services had been largely\neliminated. Indeed, individuals from lower income groups were actually\nseeing physicians slightly more often than those of higher incomes,\nwhich reflected their higher burden of illness.1\nparticularly for low-income groups who were in poorer health. The\nnation's low-income citizens received less physician care, on average, in\nshown in Exhibit 2, physician visit rates for low-income individuals in\npoorer health declined by 8 percent while visit rates for the nonpoor of\nsimilar health status increased by 42 percent. This widened a gap that\nhad all but disappeared. By 1986, the poor had 27 percent fewer\nphysician visits than did the nonpoor of the same health status. This\nsuggests a significant reversal in the longstanding trend toward greater\nequity in the accessibility of physician care.\nLow-income adults, particularly those under age sixty-five, have ex\nperienced marked declines in physician visits since 1982 (Exhibit 3).

By\n1986, poor and nonpoor adults under age sixty-five were seeing physi\ncians at roughly the same rates even though almost three times more of\nthe poor reported themselves in only fair or poor health. If poor and\nnonpoor adults had comparable access to physicians, we would expect\nthe poor to see physicians more often because a larger proportion are in\nill health. The same trends in access are noted for the elderly. Poor and\nnonpoor elderly saw physicians at the same rates in 1986 despite a higher\nproportion of poor elderly reporting themselves in ill health. Access to\nphysician care for poor children remained about the same over the\nperiod, but physician use rates for poor children do not reflect that more\npoor children than nonpoor children are in ill health.\nA number of changes in the organization and financing of hospital\nabout how these changes affected low-income Americans. The national\ndecline in hospital use mentioned earlier is reflected in a reduction of\nhospitalization among both poor and nonpoor Americans, as indicated\nin Exhibit 4.

Our data do not permit an assessment, however, of whether\nappropriate to their actual levels of need.\nAccess for minorities. An important measure of equity of access is the\nfrequency of the use of health services by minorities. Hispanics, on\naverage, see physicians at about the same rate as whites. For black\nAmericans, however, the 1986 survey portrays a picture of diminishing\naccess to medical care. As indicated in Exhibit 5, physician visit rates for\ndifference of 33 percent between physician visit rates of blacks and\nwhites in ill health, and about the same for those in good health. The\ngrowing gap in physician visits between blacks and whites is of particular\nconcern in view of the evidence recently assembled by the National\nInstitutes of Health showing that black Americans have a considerably\nhigher mortality rate than whites have.1\nAll ethnic groups were affected by the overall national decline in\nhospital use (Exhibit 6). However, the study shows that in both 1982 and\n1986 there were significant gaps in receipt of hospital care for Hispanics\ncompared to whites despite a greater proportion of Hispanics in ill\nhealth.

Health insurance continues to be an impor\ntant factor influencing access to medical care. The nation's uninsured\npopulation contains a somewhat larger share of people in fair or poor\nhealth than is found among those with health insurance. Thus, if there\nwere no economic barriers to care, the receipt of physician services and\nhospital care by the uninsured would be expected to exceed that received\nby the insured. As can be seen in Exhibit 7, the uninsured had fewer\nphysician visits and were less likely than the insured to be hospitalized in\n5The gap between the uninsured and the insured in\naverage number of physician visits widened substantially in 1986, sug\ngesting that the uninsured are experiencing greater difficulty obtaining\nphysician care. While the gap in receipt of hospital care narrowed over\nthe period, a 19 percent difference still remains between the uninsured\nuninsured were hospitalized than their higher burden of illness suggests\nmight be appropriate.\nThose surveyed were also asked if they had ever failed to obtain\nneeded medical care for economic reasons. The results, presented in\nExhibit 8, closely parallel the other findings. Of those interviewed, 6\npercent, representing approximately 13.5 million Americans, reported\nnot receiving medical care for financial reasons. An estimated 1 million\nindividuals actually tried to obtain needed care but did not receive it.\nThe majority of Americans experiencing these difficulties were poor,\nuninsured, or minorities.\nUnderuse Of Medical Care\nGrowing concerns about the nation's rising health care bill have led to\nan almost exclusive focus by public and private sector policymakers on\nhow to reduce the unnecessary overuse of costly health care.

The results from this study point to\nparticular problems of underuse across the country.\nExhibit 9 presents data providing measures of potential underuse of\nmedical care by different groups in the country. One in six Americans\nwho had an identifiable chronic and serious illness (such as cancer, heart\ndisease, diabetes, and stroke) did not see a physician even once during the\nyear. Many physicians would agree that patients with such illnesses\nshould be seen by a doctor at least annually.\nThe survey also asked respondents whether, over the past thirty days,\nthey had experienced one or more symptoms judged by a panel of\nphysicians to warrant care in most instances, and if so, whether they\nsought medical attention. These serious symptoms were adapted from an\ninstrument developed by the University of Chicago, and subsequently\nmodified for use in the Rand Health Insurance Experiment.1\n6O f those\nIndicators Of Potential Underuse Of Medical Care, 1986\nProblem U S .

These symptoms included\nbleeding, other than nosebleeds or menstrual periods, not caused by\naccidents; shortness of breath after light exercise; loss of consciousness,\nfainting, or passing out; chest pain when exercising; and weight loss of\nmore than ten pounds (except for dieting). The large proportion of\npeople who failed to visit or telephone a physician in the face of having\nthese symptoms is of concern.\nLikewise, the large proportion of pregnant women who did not seek\nprenatal care in the first three months of their pregnancy is troubling.\nInfant mortality has been reduced by half since 1960, but the rates of\ninfant death in the United States still exceed those of many other\ncomparable industrialized countries. A recent Institute of Medicine\nstudy concluded that early prenatal care leads to improved maternal and\ninfant outcomes.1\n7It is therefore of concern to find that one in seven\npregnant women surveyed in 1986 did not seek medical care early in their\npregnancy.\nThe study also found signs of underuse of medical care for persons\ndiagnosed as having hypertension. This disease is associated with two of\nthe nation's major killers--heart disease and stroke. Thus, it is of concern\nthat 20 percent of people with diagnosed hypertension surveyed in 1986\n--and almost one-third of blacks and Hispanics with this condition--did\nnot have their blood pressure checked at least once during the year.\nAmericans have traditionally underused dental services, and this\ntrend appears to have continued. Thirty-eight percent of all respondents\nhad not visited a dentist in a year; only half of low-income individuals\nreported a dental visit.\nThese data taken together suggest that a substantial number of Ameri\ncans may not be getting as much health care as they need. The reasons\nmay include social and cultural factors as well as financial barriers.\nHowever, the presence of signs of underuse among all segments of the\npopulation also suggests a lack of understanding of appropriate use of\nmedical care and a need for improved public education.\nOther Findings__________________________________________________\nImproved access for rural Americans. A positive finding in the 1986\nsurvey is that rural Americans, on average, appear to be receiving as\nmuch medical care as their urban counterparts, as indicated in Exhibit\n10. Closing the rural/urban gap in access to health services has been a\nnational goal for many years. That goal now appears to have been\nachieved. This is not to say, of course, that residents of some isolated\nrural communities do not still experience problems obtaining timely\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 02, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

The same is true for some inner-city residents.

Despite substantial disparities between\nvarious groups in their access to medical care, most Americans remain\nhighly satisfied with the care they receive from physicians and hospitals.\nEven the modest levels of dissatisfaction with emergency care found in\nConclusion\nThe results of the 1986 University of California, Los Angeles survey,\nthe largest supported by The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to date,\nare both surprising and disturbing. Many of the nation's forecasters in\nhealth have clearly not been on the mark. An aging population, a\ngrowing supply of physicians, and more and better medical technologies\nhave not, as predicted, led to significant increases in use of health care per\nperson. Rather, this study suggests that there has been a decline in visits\nto physicians and in the proportion of people hospitalized. This trend\ncuts across all groups within our country and is difficult to fully explain.\nSome will obviously associate this with the many changes now occurring\nType ofvisit Percent dissatisfied\nMost recent emergency visit 11% 5%\nMost recent physician visit 3 2\nMost recent hospitalization 4 4\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 02, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

There are, however, significant num\nbers of individuals who have serious and potentially life-threatening\nillnesses who do not appear to use health care appropriately. This may\nprove to be a problem requiring more public education or it may reflect\nunrecognized financial or professional barriers to care.\nOn the positive side, after many years of national attention to achiev\ning a more equitable geographic distribution of health resources, rural\nAmericans, on average, appear to be receiving as much medical care as\nurban residents. While some isolated rural communities clearly have\ncontinuing problems that should not be overlooked, we can take some\npride in knowing that medical care is reasonably accessible nationwide.\nAlso on a positive note, Americans continue to express a high level of\nsatisfaction with the medical care they receive.\nClearly, the most disturbing findings relate to the signs of deteriora\ntion in access to medical care for the nation's poor, minorities, and the\nuninsured. In particular, the poor and black Americans have experi\nenced a reversal of the gains in access to physician care made over the\nprevious two decades, moving us further from securing more equitable\naccess to care for all.\nThis study was supported by a grant from The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to the Institute for\nSocial Sciences Research, University of California, Los Angeles.
