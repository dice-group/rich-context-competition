We examine the relationship between living arrangements and multiple measures of physical, cognitive, and\nemotional functioning in late midlife.\nMethods. Using cross-sectional data from the Health and Retirement Study, we first assess the bivariate relationship be-\ntween living arrangements and functioning; we then take into account demographic characteristics and measures of household\nresources and demands.\nResults. Wefindevidence of differential functioning among individuals in various living arrangements. Married couples liv-\ning alone or with children show the highest levels of functioning, whereas single adults living in complex households show the\nlowest levels. Functional deficits for those in complex households are reduced but not eliminated when we take demographic\ncharacteristics and household resources and demands into account. We find few differences by gender and race/ethnicity in the\nrelationship between living arrangements and functioning.\nDiscussion. We show a pattern of poorer functioning among those in arguably the most demanding and least supportive\nhousehold environments. This points to a vulnerable andrisk-filledtransition from middle to old age for these persons. Because\nBlacks and Hispanics show lower levels of functioning than Whites and are more likely to live in complex households, they\nmay be particularly disadvantaged.\nTN middle through early older ages, people live in diverse fam-\n1. ily structures (Siegel, 1993). A large proportion of adults in\ntheir 50s and 60s are \"empty nesters,\" living only with their\nspouses. Others live with their children--some with their\nspouses and children, some with their children only, and some\nin complex households including their spouses, children, and\nother relatives. A sizeable minority of persons in this age group\nlives alone; a smaller minority lives with a cohabiting partner.\nFinally, a modest but significant number live without spouse or\nchildren in complex households. As in other stages of the life\ncourse, these patterns differ by race and ethnicity. Single-parent\nfamilies and multigenerational households are both more com-\nmon among older Blacks and Hispanics than among older\nWhites (Himes, Hogan, & Eggebeen, 1996).\nThe various household structures make very different de-\nmands on the adults in them and offer very different levels and\ntypes of resources. These differences may have implications for\nthe well-being of adults at the threshold of old age. Although\nmost middle-aged adults remain healthy and continue to func-\ntion at high levels, in late middle age some people begin to ex-\nperience functional limitations associated with aging (Jette,\n1996). Impaired functioning among those living indepen-\ndently--or those on whom others are dependent--points to an\nincreased risk of transition to disability and suggests a potential\nunmet need for support.\nIn this article, we consider the household as a specific and im-\nportant context in which functional limitations may create prob-\nlems for older adults. Using the Health and Retirement Study,\nwe examine the cross-sectional relationship between household\nstructure and levels of physical, emotional, and cognitive func-\ntioning for a group of adults poised to become young-old.\nBackground\nRecent conceptualizations of the disablement process have\ndefined functional capacity as an individual's inherent capability\nto perform fundamental physical, emotional, or mental actions\nThe notion of functional capacity is intended to separate generic,\nsituation-free actions, such as walking, lifting heavy objects,\nclimbing stairs, normal affect, and short-term memory from\nmore complex, situation-dependent activities, such as household\nmaintenance, cooking, or bathing (Verbrugge & Jette, 1994).\nFunctional limitations--restrictions in performing such fun-\ndamental actions--constitute a key step in the disablement pro-\ncess. In this perspective, disability reflects \"the expression of a\nfunctional limitation in a social context--the gap between a\nperson's capabilities and the demands of the environment\"\n(Pope & Tarlov, 1991, p.81). This view is similar to Lawton's\n(1982) notion of \"competence\" or physical, mental, and emo-\ntional capabilities of individuals, which combines with \"envi-\nronmental press\" to affect behavior. Other conceptions have\nalso highlighted the importance of the social and built environ-\nments in shaping the aging experience (Golant, 1984; Moos,\nEach of these frameworks suggests that the development of\nproblems with age, especially disability, is critically dependent\nupon the relationship between an individual's functional status and\nhis or her environment. Aging individuals live and act in many\noverlapping environments. Of these, the household presents the en-\nvironment that a person must negotiate on a daily basis to fulfill\nbasic needs. By household, we refer both to household composi-\ntion--the number and identity of persons in the household--and\nto the physical features of the dwelling (Burch & Matthews, 1987).\nThe centrality of the household follows from a number of its\nfeatures. First, the household is the repository of critical social\nroles--notjust self-care and household maintenance, but also\nroles such as spouse, parent, and grandparent (Verbrugge & Jette,\n1994). Second, the presence and types of others in the household\nnot only determines the roles a person expects and is expected to\nfill, but they also determine the particular task demands associ-\nated with a role and the potential for change in these obligations\nin the face of functional limitations. The tasks embodied in social\nroles make physical, cognitive, and emotional demands on role\nincumbents; however, others in the household may constitute a\nresource, taking over tasks that a functionally impaired individual\nis not able to do. Third, household others form the principal web\nof interactions for the aging person. The attitudes and motiva-\ntions of the person and the others surrounding him or her shape\nthe individual's response to functional limitations (Nagi, 1965).\nFinally, quite apart from the inhabitants of the household, the\ncharacteristics of the dwelling shape the residential environment\ncussed, the size of the dwelling, whether it has stairs, and the ex-\ntent to which it is suited for special needs define the demands that\nresidents face in accomplishing day-to-day tasks (Czaja, Weber,\nEach household type contains a distinct configuration of de-\nmands and resources. For example, being married brings the de-\nmands of the spousal role, but a member of a married couple\nmay rely on a spouse tofillin gaps left by functional limitations.\nThe particular closeness of marital relationships may make the\nadjustment especially successful. In contrast, although persons\nliving alone have no demands placed on them by others, they\nhave no one to compensate for any functional limitations. The\nperson living alone must fulfill all of the requirements of inde-\npendent living and lacks the instrumental and emotional support\nfrom others that might mitigate a functional limitation.\nA more complex case is presented by multigenerational house-\nholds. Coresidence with children, grandchildren, or others may\nbe a response to economic hardship or may reflect cultural tradi-\ntions that emphasize kin solidarity and intergenerational ties\n(Himes et al., 1996). Recent research suggests that intergenera-\ntional households are most often based on the needs of the\nyounger generations (Aquilino, 1990; Ward, Logan, & Spitze,\n1992). Thus although these households are often expected to be\nuniquely supportive, they may actually present special stresses\nand challenges to senior members with functional limitations.\nThe importance of extended household structures among minor-\nity individuals, especially those living in poverty, suggests that\nthis is a critical issue (Bengtson, Rosenthal, & Burton, 1996).\nResearch Questions\nOur aim is to examine the cross-sectional relationship be-\ntween living arrangements and functional limitations in a rela-\ntively youthful sample to assess the relevance of the household\nas a context for aging. We address four questions.\nFirst, do adults living in different types of households differ in\nlevels of physical, cognitive, and emotional functioning? Adults\nin their 50s and 60s live in a variety of households. Although\nmost are healthy, some show moderate to substantial deficits in\nfunctioning on some dimensions. Do those in the least support-\nive and/or most demanding types of households show higher\nlevels of functioning than those in other households? How do\nknown influences of household composition on health translate\ninto differences in functional status by living arrangement?\nSecond, to what extent are any deficits in functioning among\nmiddle-aged adults in certain living arrangements accounted for\nby their other characteristics? The likelihood of both functional\nlimitations and widowhood increase with age (U.S. Bureau of\nthe Census, 1996). Older men are substantially less likely than\nolder women to live alone and show lower prevalence of limita-\ntions (Siegel, 1993). Blacks are more likely than Whites to be\nsingle-adult heads of families and are more likely to have func-\ntional limitations (Schoenbaum & Waidman, 1997; U.S.\nBureau of the Census, 1996). We compare the association be-\ntween living arrangements and functioning before and after tak-\ning into account these demographic characteristics.\nThird, to what extent is the relationship between living ar-\nrangements and functioning attenuated or exacerbated when we\nconsider the resources available to the household and the de-\nmands made upon its members? Certain characteristics of indi-\nviduals represent the resources that they can use to ameliorate\nthe impact of functional limitations. Formal schooling has been\nshown to have strong, persistent, and positive effects on health\nand functioning (Ross & Wu, 1995). Income allows an individ-\nual to purchase equipment, services, and home alterations in the\nface of deficits in functioning (Smith, 1997). The physical char-\nacteristics of the dwelling may assist or further challenge a\nFourth, do differences in resources and demands exacerbate\nor ameliorate racial and ethnic differentials in living arrange-\nments and functioning? Blacks function at lower levels, on av-\nerage, than Whites (Schoenbaum & Waidman, 1997) and are\nalso more likely to live in complex and demanding households\n(U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1996). At the same time, Blacks\nhave lower household incomes (Smith, 1997) and lower levels\nof education than Whites (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1994).\nHispanic older adults are substantially more likely than others to\nlive with relatives (Burr & Mutchler, 1993) and to live in house-\nholds with more people (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1996).\nThey also have lower average levels of education and income\nthan White older adults (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1994). We\nassess whether these racial and ethnic differences multiply to in-\ncrease the potential impact of functional limitations.\nMETHODS\nData\nData for this analysis are drawn from Wave 1 of the Health\nand Retirement Study (HRS), a longitudinal survey of a nation-\nviews for the HRS are centered in the retirement period, years\nof transitions in labor supply, family structure, and health. The\nanalysis sample is comprised of White, Black, and Hispanic\nage-eligible respondents for whom information on family struc-\nture and household finances was available (N= 9,424).\nMeasures ofFunctioning\nWe report results for multiple measures of functioning, se-\nlected to represent the individual's situation-free capacity in\nthree domains: physical, cognitive, and emotional. In construct-\ning the measures, we followed Wallace and Herzog (1995).\nDefinitions and distributions of these variables are summarized\nin Table 1. All measures are coded so that higher values indi-\ncate better functioning.\nPhysical functioning.--We use two measures of physical\nfunctioning. The first, Self-Rated Health, is designed to capture\nrespondents' subjective assessments of their own medical and\nfunctional status. Respondents were asked to rate their health\non a 5-point scale from poor to excellent. Although we use Self-\nRated Health as a situation-free measure of physical capacity, it\nshould be kept in mind that respondents may take into account\nthe demands and supports of their environment when assessing\ntheir status. Second, the Mobility Index is calculated by sum-\nming responses to five items assessing difficulty with specific\nforms of ambulation, such as walking a block and climbing a\nflight of stairs. This measure directly assesses the individual's\ncapacity for physical mobility. If valid, our measures of physi-\ncal functioning must relate to other health measures in theoreti-\ncally meaningful ways. Wallace and Herzog (1995) show sig-\nnificant associations between Self-Rated Health and the\nMobility Index and strong associations between the Mobility\nIndex and the presence of eight key diseases. We calculated an\nalpha coefficient for the Mobility Index of .78, suggesting the\nscale is internally consistent.\nMissing values on the Mobility Index are due primarily to\nanswers that people \"don't do\" one or two components--walk\nseveral blocks and climb several sets of stairs. Analyses of these\ncases suggests that people do not perform these actions because\nthey are unable to do them, imparting a conservative bias to our\nanalysis by excluding persons with the most limitations.\nCognitive functioning.--The HRS includes three tests of\ncognitive functioning; we use all three. The Immediate Free\nRecall Test assesses ability to acquire new information and in-\nvolves recalling 20 nouns read by the interviewer. The score is\nsimply the number of words recalled. The Delayed Free Recall\nTest assesses ability to remember these nouns after several in-\ntervening survey questions. Again, the scores range from 0 to\n20. The Similarities Subtest, which taps abstract reasoning, is\nan abbreviated version of the Similarities Subtest of the\nWechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised. Seven pairs of\nwords were presented to the respondent with instructions to de-\nscribe how the words in each pair are alike. The resulting scores\nrange from 0 to 14. As expected, immediate and delayed recall\nare strongly correlated. All three measures are positively associ-\nated with respondents' reports of ability to think quickly and\ndifficulty remembering.\nApproximately 8% of cases have no information for\nImmediate and Delayed Recall, and 11% have no Similarities\nScore. The missing information is almost completely due to re-\nfusals and essentially falls into two groups: respondents who\nare missing on all three measures and respondents who are\nTable 1.

Those missing all three mea-\nsures are likely to be married men living with children or oth-\ners; those missing only the Similarities Score are more likely to\nbe Black, Hispanic, and of lower education.\nEmotionalfunctioning.--The HRS includes a short version\nof the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale,\nwhich has been used extensively for respondents across a range\nof ages. For each item on the scale, respondents answered in a\nrange of 1 to 4; the summary score is the average of the 11\nitems. We also use Self-Rated Emotional Health, scored on a 5-\npoint scale ranging from poor to excellent. Like Self-Rated\nHealth, these measures may reflect environmental influences so\nthey may be less pure measures of functional status. The\nDepression Scale shows an alpha coefficient of .84, indicating\nhigh internal consistency. Associations with Self-Rated\nEmotional Health and with presence of \"emotional, nervous, or\npsychiatric problems\" are substantial, supporting the concurrent\nvalidity of both the Depression Scale and Self-Rated Emotional\nMeasures ofLiving Arrangements\nWe distinguish six living arrangements: (a) married persons\nliving with their spouses only; (b) married persons living with\ntheir spouses and children only; (c) married persons living with\ntheir spouses and others; (d) unmarried persons living alone; (e)\nunmarried persons living with children only; and (f) unmarried\npersons living with others. We distinguished these arrange-\nments because we believe their incumbents face qualitatively\ndifferent demands and resources. The distribution of our re-\nspondents across living arrangements is shown in Table 1.\nThe category \"unmarried\" refers to current status and in-\ncludes all types of non-marriage--these respondents are sepa-\nrated, widowed, divorced, or never married. Due to the rarity of\ncohabitation in these cohorts, we did not have enough cohabit-\ning couples for separate analysis; the 240 cohabiting respon-\ndents are treated as married. Married couples or singles who are\nliving with others may also be living with children; we con-\nstructed our measures to distinguish households in which the\nrelationships were nuclear from those with relationships that\nare more complex. The vast majority of the \"others\" in these\ncomplicated households are lineal relatives who are one more\ngeneration removed (e.g., the parents or grandchildren of the\nHRS respondent). The category \"single with others\" includes a\nsubstantial proportion of persons who are living in someone\nelse's household. In the other categories nearly all households\nare headed by the HRS respondent or his or her spouse.\nMeasures ofCovariates\nDemographic characteristics.--Because functioning on\nsome dimensions declines with age (Siegel, 1993), we include\na measure of age within the 51-62-years-old age range included\nin the HRS. We also include the gender of the respondent, be-\ncause men and women tend to differ on functioning across di-\nmensions (Siegel, 1993). Finally, we include indicators of race\nand ethnicity to capture rather substantial group differences in\nhealth (Schoenbaum & Waidman, 1997). The distributions of\nthese and all other covariates are shown in Table 1.\nHousehold resources.--Both education and household in-\ncome act as resources that can be used to offset declines in\nfunctioning, by allowing one to alter the environment or adjust\nto difficulties (Ross & Wu, 1995). Home ownership reflects\neconomic assets in addition to household income (Smith,\n1997). Family and friends in the neighborhood, in addition to\nthose in the household, can act as sources of help and support\n(Logan & Spitze, 1996). We also include a measure of employ-\nment, which brings both resources and demands, as does the\nnumber of the respondent's children.\nHousehold demands.--We include several characteristics of\nthe dwelling to represent the demands that the residence places\nfirst measure indicates that the respondent did not live in a\nhouse, but in an apartment, mobile home, or other structure. The\nsecond variable is a crude indicator of the number of flights of\nstairs the respondent might have to climb. For respondents living\nin houses, this measure simply refers to the number of stories in\nthe house, not counting the basement. For those in apartments,\nthe measure indicated what floor the apartment was on. Third,\nwe include a dummy variable indicating whether residence had\nsix or more rooms. Because these three variables came from in-\nterviewer observation, they included a fair amount of missing\ndata, which we had no reason to believe was not random. We as-\nsigned values for the missing cases at random according to the\ndistribution of values among nonmissing cases and included\nvariables indicating these cases in the equation. To test the impli-\ncations of this procedure, we also ran models excluding cases\nmissing this information and found that our overall conclusions\nremained unchanged. The coefficients for characteristics of the\ndwelling either strengthened significantly or remained the same,\nsuggesting that our procedure had a conservative bias.\nThe final residential variable reflects the ease with which the\nrespondent reported that his or her dwelling could be altered to\naccommodate any limitations. Modifying the home is one strat-\negy functionally impaired individuals may use in order to \"age\nin place\" (Pynoos & Golant, 1996). We created a dummy vari-\nable showing whether the respondent thought his or her house\nwas very easy to alter or had already been altered.\nRESULTS\nTables 2,3, and 4 present the results of three ordinary least-\nsquares regressions for each of our seven measures of function-\ning. For each measure, the first column (Model 1) presents a\nmodel that contains only measures of living arrangements. The\nmodel in the second column (Model 2) adds key demographic\nvariables--age, sex, race, and Hispanic ethnicity. The final\nmodel (Model 3) adds an extensive series of measures of the re-\nsources available to the individual and the demands made upon\nhim or her. These three models correspond to our first three re-\nsearch questions; our fourth question, relating to racial and eth-\nnic differences, is addressed by both Models 2 and 3.\nLivingArrangements and Functioning\nThe basic models (Model 1) of all the measures of function-\ning tell a consistent story: married couples living alone or only\nwith children show the highest levels of functioning on all di-\nmensions. Couples living alone are the reference category in\nour analyses; the significant coefficients for the dummy vari-\nables representing alternative living arrangements are nearly all\nnegative, indicating that individuals in these other arrangements\nhave poorer functioning than individuals who are members of\nmarried couples living alone. However, on all dimensions but\none, married couples living only with their children are at least\nas advantaged as solo couples. In fact, on the Mobility Index,\nmarried couples with children appear to function somewhat\nbetter than solo couples.\nThe magnitudes of the differences between members of mar-\nried couples and persons in other arrangements differ by the\nparticular arrangements. Without exception, single adults living\nTable 2.

Moreover, the differences in function-\ning between married adults living alone and single adults living\nwith others are generally on the order of a half a point on 5-\npoint scales like Self-Rated Health, and a full point on scales\nlike Immediate and Delayed Recall, which range from 0 to 20.\nThus the deficits in functioning of single adults living with oth-\ners tend to be substantially larger than those of adults in any\nother riving arrangement.\nThese groups--married couples living with and without chil-\ndren and single adults living with others--anchor the high and\nlow ends, respectively, of the continuum of functioning across\nall dimensions. The groups in between--single adults living\nalone, single parents living with children, and married couples\nwho live with people other than their children--all fall in the\nmiddle on functioning, always significantly worse than married\ncouples alone or with children only, and always better than sin-\ngle adults living with others. But within this middle range, rela-\ntive positions shift across measures and dimensions.\nIn sum, respondents in what are likely to be the most support-\nive household structures--married couples with and without chil-\ndren--also show the highest levels of functioning, and those in\nthe potentially least supportive or most demanding household\nstructures--single adults living alone, living with children, or liv-\ning with others--show the lowest levels of functioning. Recall\nthat most of those in households with others live with their own\nparents, who would be quite aged, or with grandchildren. In either\ncase, these others are more likely to bring demands than resources.\nAdding Demographic Characteristics\nModel 2 adds basic demographic characteristics to Model 1. It\nshows that for all measures of functioning, holding constant basic\ndemographic characteristics reduces the deficits shown by those\nin unmarried or complex households. For example, in the model\nTable 3. Results From Regressions of Two Measures of Emotional Functioning on Living Arrangements and Covariates,\nIndependent Variable\nLiving Arrangements3\nCouple with children\nCouple with others\nSingle alone\nSingle with children\nSingle with others\nAge\nMale\nBlack\"\nHispanicb\nYears Education\nHousehold Income\nWorking\nDo Not Own Residence\nResidence Not a Housed\n2+ Stories in Residenced\n6+ Rooms in Residenced\nEasy to Alter Residence\nFamily Members in Neighborhood\nFriends in Neighborhood\nConstant\nN\nSelf-Rated Emotional Health\nDepression Index\n\"Reference category is married couples living alone.\n\"Reference category is Whites.\n'Reference category is no children.\ndIndicator for missing on this item not significant, p< = .05.\nof Self-Rated Health, the coefficient for \"couple with others\" in-\ncreases from -.293 to -.154 and the coefficient for \"single with\nothers\" falls from -.5% to -.384 with the addition of demographic\ncharacteristics. Clearly, some of the lower average levels of func-\ntioning among single adults living alone, with children only, or\nwith others stem from age, gender, race, or ethnicity. However, in\nalmost all cases, the coefficients that were significant in the basic\nmodel remain statistically significant with the addition of demo-\ngraphic characteristics, and we continue to see significantly lower\nlevels of functioning for persons in these households compared to\nmembers of married couples who live alone. The two exceptions\nboth appear for single adults living with children: taking account\nof demographic characteristics eliminates the previous functional\ndeficits for persons in this arrangement on the Mobility Index and\nthe Similarities Test Score.\nModel 2 also highlights the large differentials in functioning\nacross racial and ethnic groups. The coefficients for \"Black\"\nand \"Hispanic\" are quite large for all measures of functioning,\noften the largest or among the largest in the model. Thus, con-\nsistent with previous research, we find that Blacks and\nHispanics are disadvantaged with respect to physical, cognitive,\nand emotional functioning. The strongest effects of race and\nethnicity appear for the three measures of cognitive functioning\nand the smallest for the two measures of emotional functioning.\nAdding Household Resources and Demands\nIn Model 3, we add measures of household resources and de-\nmands to Model 2 to assess whether differential functioning by\nliving arrangement merely reflects these characteristics. The\nmodel shows somewhat smaller coefficients for living arrange-\nments than the previous models. But in virtually all cases, the\npattern observed in Model 1 remains: those living in unmarried\nor complex households show deficits in functioning compared\nwith members of married couples living alone or with children\nTable 4.

The exceptions include \"couple with others\" in the model\nof Similarities Score, and \"single alone\" in the model of\nImmediate Recall, both of which are no longer significantly dif-\nferent from members of married couples living alone. In several\ncases insignificant differences become significant in the more\ncomplex model, including \"couple with children\" for both mea-\nsures of emotional health, and Immediate Recall and \"single with\nchildren\" for the Mobility Index and Similarities Test Score.\nHowever, in this final model, we no longer observe that single\npersons living with others always have the poorest functioning.\nAlthough they are often the most disadvantaged, on some mea-\nsures single persons in other arrangements or couples in com-\nplex arrangements are the most functionally limited. Thus the\npattern has shifted somewhat, to a distinction between members\nof married couples with and without children and all others.\nIt is also evident from Model 3 that respondents with the most\npersonal resources also tend to show the highest levels of func-\ntioning. For instance, consistent with previous research, higher\neducation and greater income are associated with better func-\ntioning. Respondents who do not own their residences show sig-\nnificantly lower functioning on all measures, net of household\nincome. Well-educated and high-income individuals are the\nmost able to compensate for reduced functioning and thus avoid\nexperiencing disability, for example, by purchasing services or\nby altering the demands of their environment. Respondents who\nown their own homes both have larger assets and are more likely\nto be able to alter their environments. Current employment has a\nstrong positive association with functioning on all measures but\none (Similarities Test Score), probably because low functioning\nreduces the chances of employment.\nIn contrast to the importance of these personal resources,\nneighborhood resources in the form of either friends or family\nfail to show any relationship with functioning in slightly more\nthan half the models. Where significant effects appear, respon-\ndents with friends in the neighborhood tend to have higher lev-\nels of functioning, whereas those with family in the neighbor-\nhood tend to have lower levels of functioning.\nTurning to the physical demands of the household setting, re-\nspondents with relatively demanding settings (i.e., two or more\nstories and/or relatively large dwellings) tend to show higher\nlevels of functioning, perhaps because those with difficulties\nhave altered their living situations to meet their needs.\nAlternatively, this association may appear because respondents\nof higher socioeconomic status have both higher functioning\nand larger dwellings with more stories.\nFinally, Blacks still show significantly lower levels of func-\ntioning on the physical and cognitive dimensions, but not on the\nemotional dimension. Thus the physical and cognitive functional\ndeficits that Blacks experience are not accounted for by any of\nthe characteristics we have included in this model. In contrast, the\ndeficits in functioning that appeared for Hispanics in Model 2 are\nreduced in the most complete model and sometimes eliminated\n(for Self-Rated Physical Health and the Depression Index).\nInteractions by Gender and Race/Ethnicity\nWe reestimated Model 3 (results not shown; availablefromthe\ncorresponding author) with interactions between gender and liv-\ning arrangements to determine whether the association between\nfunctioning and household structure differed for men and\nwomen. These results suggest that, on balance, men and women\nin different types of living arrangements show quite similar levels\nof functioning. We found that of the 35 interactions we examined\nonly 7 were significant; all indicated higher functioning for men.\nFive of the 7 appeared for physical functioning and 2 for cogni-\ntive functioning. No other differences by gender appeared.\nWe also reestimated Model 3 (results not shown) allowing\ninteractions between living arrangements and race/ethnicity\nand, again, found few differences in the relationship with func-\ntioning. Of the 35 interactions we tested for Blacks, only 3 were\nsignificant and all appeared for Immediate Recall. Blacks living\nin married couple households with children, in married couple\nhouseholds with others, and unmarried Blacks living with oth-\ners showed lower scores than Whites in similar households.\nThe relationship between functioning and living arrange-\nments for Hispanics, however, shows some consistent and theo-\nretically interpretable patterns. Hispanic adults living in married\ncouple households with others--most often parents or grand-\nchildren--show higher levels of functioning across four of the\nseven measures, Self-Rated Health, Mobility Index, Depression\nScale, and Self-Rated Emotional Health, than Whites in similar\nhouseholds. These patterns are consistent with arguments that\nfor cultural reasons Hispanics value family closeness and inter-\ngenerational coresidence (Himes et al., 1996). We also found\nthat Hispanic adults living alone show worse scores on the\nDepression Scale and on the Similarities Score, perhaps be-\ncause this living arrangement is culturally devalued and indica-\ntive of greater distress among Hispanics man other groups.\nDISCUSSION\nIn this article, we have presented strong and consistent evi-\ndence of differential physical, emotional and cognitive function-\ning by living arrangement among adults in their 50s and early\n60s. Married couples living alone show the highest levels of\nfunctioning, with married couples living with children a very\nclose second. Single adults living in complex households show\nthe lowest levels of functioning on all dimensions. Deficits in\nfunctioning for persons in unmarried and complex households\nare reduced but not eliminated when we take demographic char-\nacteristics and household resources and demands into account.\nClearly, the patterns of functioning and living arrangements that\nwe observe in this cross section are the result of prior processes,\nincluding the impact of living arrangements on pathology, im-\npairments and functioning, and perhaps adjustments in house-\nhold structure to compensate for functional limitations.\nThese patterns point to vulnerabilities for some adults as they\nage and experience further declines in functioning. Generally,\nindividuals best equipped to deal with reductions in physical,\ncognitive, or emotional functioning have access to help from\nothers in the household, adequate resources, and a relatively\nmalleable and/or undemanding environment. However, we\nfound a definite pattern of poorer functioning among respon-\ndents who are arguably in the most demanding and least sup-\nportive household environments.\nIn addition, adults who are already functioning at less than\noptimal levels in late middle age are often disadvantaged in\nother ways. We see this especially for the Black and Hispanic\nadults in our sample. Both groups consistently function at lower\nlevels and are more likely to live in unmarried or complex\nhouseholds than Whites. They also tend to have lower house-\nhold incomes, fewer assets, and lower levels of education than\nWhites of the same age. Thus, Black and Hispanic older adults\nare likely to be disadvantaged in their levels of physical, emo-\ntional, and cognitive functioning, the demands and supports in\ntheir households, and the resources that they can bring to bear\non any problems that arise. From this perspective, it is mislead-\ning to say that, for example, Black older adults function at only\nslightly lower levels than Whites, once we take into account\ntheir education, income, family structure, and other factors. In\nfact, Black, and to a lesser extent, Hispanic adults suffer from a\ncombination of threats to their well-being that points to a vul-\nnerable andrisk-filledtransition from middle to old age.\nDisability, not death, is the principal consequence of chronic\nconditions and the principal concern of aging societies (Jette,\nizations suggest that disability ultimately results from the inter-\naction of the individual's functional capacity and the social and\nphysical environment that he or she encounters (Pope & Tarlov,\n1997). We have argued that the household is a particularly criti-\ncal environment for the development of disability, for it defines\nthe roles an individual expects to fill, the tasks associated with\nthese roles, interactions with others, and a built environment.\nBoth previous research and U.S. public policy have stressed the\nimportance of physical environment in shaping the experience\nof disability. Our results, which show a distinct patterning of\nliving arrangements and functional status, suggest that we\nshould look closely at the household as a key social context in\nwhich disability may be created or avoided.\nFuture research on the role of the household in the disable-\nment process will need to adopt a dynamic view, examining tran-\nsitions in functional status, household structure, and disability\novertime.This will require specifying more exactly how various\nhousehold types create or prevent disability. We have assumed\nand not examined differences across household structures in de-\nmands and supports to members. In addition, attention must be\npaid to intrahousehold processes of adjustment, as the internal\ndynamics of the household will certainly affect how members re-\nspond to functional limitations. It will be particularly important\nto examine these processes separately by race and ethnicity.\nClearly, such approaches also require moving beyond the\ntask batteries of Basic and Instrumental Activities of Daily\nLiving as indicators of disability. The emphasis in the disable-\nment process on the variety of human activities and the situa-\ntional and experienced nature of disability suggest a more sub-\njective notion of disability. This innovation will need to be\npaired with situation-free measures of functional status in order\nto assess rigorously the interaction of functional status and\nhousehold environment in the creation of disability.\nThe difficulties presented by systematically investigating the\nenvironmental creation of disability from functional limitations\nare inherent to relational definitions of disability (Verbrugge &\nJette, 1994). However, explicitly addressing the contextual cre-\nation of disability is not merely a semantic issue. Current ap-\nproaches to \"successful aging\" emphasize a holistic approach to\naging well, in particular maintaining health, physical, and cogni-\ntive functioning, and engagement with life (Rowe & Kahn, 1997).\nAssessing the ways in which personal functional status and envi-\nronmental characteristics shape individuals' ability to carry out\nusual roles is entirely consistent with this aim. Such knowledge\ncould have large theoretical and practical payoffs and help main-\ntain a high quality of life of future generations ofelders.\n"
