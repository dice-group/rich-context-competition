This\nstudy measured levels of adhesion molecules before and after levothyroxine therapy in patients\nwith subclinical hypothyroidism (SHO).\nMethods: Levels of soluble (s) intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, s vascular cell adhesion\nmolecule (sVCAM) VCAM-1 and sE-selectin were analysed in patients diagnosed with SHO, prior\nto administration of 50 mg/day levothyroxine orally for 3 months. Subsequently, levels of sICAM-1,\nsVCAM-1 and sE-selectin were reanalysed then compared with the pretreatment levels.\nResults: In 30 patients with SHO, levels of sICAM-1 were found to be significantly higher than\nthose in healthy controls, (P \u00bc 0.001). Post-treatment sICAM-1 levels were significantly lower than\npretreatment levels (P \u00bc 0.001). No significant differences were found in sVCAM-1 or sE-selectin\nlevels between healthy controls and patients with SHO before treatment, or between patients with\nSHO pre- and post-treatment.\nConclusions: Patients with SHO had significantly higher levels of sICAM-1 compared with\ncontrols. Levels became normal after treatment with levothyroxine. These findings emphasize the\nneed for levothyroxine therapy in cases of SHO to normalize sICAM-1 levels. Such treatment helps\nto prevent the future development of atherosclerosis or cancer.\n",

Those with clear SHO are\neither asymptomatic or demonstrate very\nfew clinical manifestations. The presence of\nthyroid autoantibodies is an important indi-\ncator for the development of SHO,5 with 20\u00ad\n30% of individuals with higher TSH levels\ntesting seropositive for thyroid antibodies.6\nAdhesion molecules are related to inflam-\nmatory processes including atherosclerosis,\nand may be linked with low grade inflam-\nmation during SHO.\nA small amount of intracellular adhesion\nmolecule (ICAM)-1 is expressed in endothe-\nlial cells. Stimulation of endothelial cells by\nmediators such as interleukin (IL)-1, tumour\nnecrosis factor (TNF)-a, interferon (IFN)-g\nand lipopolysaccharides (LPS) increases the\nexpression of ICAM.7 This increase in\nexpression is seen in cases of acute and\nchronic inflammation, and in the presence of\ntumour cells.8 As a consequence of such\nstimulation, ICAM starts to become appar-\nent on the cell surface after 2\u00ad4 h and\ncontinues to increase to a plateau level\nafter 12\u00ad16 h. If cytokines are present at\nthe same time, then ICAM will be expressed\nant for the migration of eosinophils,\nT-lymphocytes and neutrophils,9 and func-\ntion as important signals in interactions\nbetween antigen-presenting cells and\nT-cells. Proteolytic dissociation of the\nICAM-1 extracellular part produces its sol-\nuble (sICAM-1) form. The plasma level of\nthis form is a direct indicator of the amount\nof inflammation in disease states.8\nStimulation of cytokines such as IL-1,\nIL-4 and TNF-a produces expression of\nvascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1\non the surface of various cells 2\u00ad4 h later.\nIL-4 selectively induces expression of\nVCAM-1, and enables the accumulation of\neosinophils, which is mediated by very late\nantigen (VLA)-4.10 VCAM molecules main-\ntain migration and adhesion of leucocytes\non endothelial vessel walls. Both ICAM-\n1and VCAM-1 play vital roles in the\nprocesses of immune response and inflam-\nmation. VCAM-1 binds to its ligand VLA-4,\nand is found in all types of leucocytes\nexcluding neutrophils. The VCAM-1/VLA-\n4 pathway plays a key role in the pathogen-\nesis of various allergic, inflammatory and\nautoimmune diseases.10\nIn common with VCAM, E-selectin is\nnot found on nonstimulated endothelial\ncells. E-selectin expression increases in\nresponse to inflammatory stimulants such\nas IL-1, TNF-a or endotoxins (e.g. LPS).3 It\nappears on the surface of endothelial cells\nwithin 30 min of stimulation, and levels peak\nafter 2\u00ad4 h. Structurally, the first extracellu-\nlar domain of E-selectin contains lectin,\nwhile the second domain comprises an\nEGF-like domain. It also contains six add-\nitional cysteine-rich protein domains.5\nAntibodies directly effective on E-selectin\nprevent inflammation.11 The E-selectin\nreceptor ensures selective binding of neutro-\nphils, monocytes and eosinophils to the\nendothelium.\nThe aim of the present study was to\ndetermine the levels of adhesion molecules\nthat are thought to have a role in the\ndevelopment of morbidities (such as inflam-\nmation, malignancy, allergy and auto-\nimmune disease) in patients with SHO\nbefore levothyroxine therapy, and assess\nif any changes occurred in adhesion mol-\necule levels after 3 months' levothyroxine\ntreatment.\nPatients and methods\nPatients\nPatients attending the endocrinology out-\npatients' clinic at Izmir Bozyaka Training\nand Research Hospital, Bozyaka, Izmir,\nTurkey, between September 2009 and April\n2011 and diagnosed with SHO during tests\nfor investigation of fatigue or weight gain\nwere enrolled into this study. Criteria for\npatients to be included in the study were\nthyroid dysfunction as indicated by labora-\nthyroid-treatment nai\u00a8ve; no history of thy-\nroid surgery or radioactive iodine therapy.\nDetailed medical histories were obtained\nand physical examinations were performed\non patients meeting the study criteria.\nIn addition, healthy volunteers (selected\nfrom healthcare workers from Izmir\nBozyaka Research and Training Hospital\nand age and sex matched to patients) were\nincluded as a control group. Whole blood\ncount, biochemistry, thyroid function tests\nand levels of anti-T, anti-M, sE-selectin,\nsVCAM-1 and sICAM-1 values were\nmeasured.\nEthical consent for the study was received\nfrom the Izmir Bozyaka Research and\nTraining Hospital Ethics Committee (refer-\nence number 358), Bozyaka, Turkey and\nwritten informed consent was obtained from\nall participants.\nBlood measurements\nWhole-blood cell counts were made using 2-\nml venous blood samples drawn into\nethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid tubes, and\n(Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL,\nUSA).

In athero-\ngenesis, leucocytes are involved in the early\nphase of atherosclerosis and maintain their\nactivity during plaque formation, during\nwhich time sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1 first\nco-ordinate leucocyte adhesion, then their\ntransendothelial migration.1 Both sICAM-1\nand sVCAM-1 are transmembrane glyco-\nproteins that bind to b-integrins found on\nthe leucocyte surface. ICAM-1 is strongly\nupregulated by inflammatory cytokines in\nendothelial cells, fibroblasts, epithelial cells\nand multiple haemopoietic cells. Generally,\nin noninflammatory conditions, ICAM-1 is\nexpressed on the surface of very few cells\nthat might be important in the induction of\nthis adhesion molecule. Its role is the regu-\nlation of various intercellular interactions\nthat generate host immune responses.\nVCAM-1 is specific for mononuclear cells\nand functions as a ligand with an affinity for\nb 1 integrins, which are found in lympho-\ncytes and monocytes. As is the case for\nICAM-1, expression of VCAM-1 is modu-\nlated by many similar cytokines. However,\ndistribution of VCAM-1 is contained in the\nactivated endothelial cells in traumatized\nregions, and is more frequently observed in\nintimal layers of neovascular structures.\nDespite structural and functional similari-\nties between ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, differ-\nences in their distribution pattern in tissues,\ntheir receptor specificities and their\nresponses to haemodynamic forces are of\ncritical importance in the pathogenesis of\natherosclerosis.2 A study demonstrated that\nincreases in sICAM-1 levels might be pre-\ndictive for myocardial infarction and\nstroke.16 However, the same evaluation is\nnot valid for sVCAM-1.17 Investigators\nhave reported that endothelial activation\nFigure 3.

CAM\nare expressed on the surface of endothelial\ncells in response to various inflammatory\ncytokines, such as IL-1, TNF-a and IFN-g.\nIntracellular CAM-1 and VCAM-1 are two\nprototype members of the immunoglobulin\nsuperfamily that have important roles in the\naccumulation of focal leucocytes in the\nsubendothelial region.19 Increased plasma\nlevels of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 (and their\nsoluble molecules) are indicators of inflam-\nmation, and also seem to be risk factors for\nfurther development of vascular occlusion in\ncoronary artery disease.20 E-selectin, which\nis another member of the adhesion molecule\nfamily expressed on the surface of endothe-\nlial cells, enables the involvement of leuco-\ncytes in inflammatory processes during an\ninflammatory response.21\nAdhesion molecules play important roles\nin atherosclerosis and cancer. TNF-a is\nimportant in the onset of inflammation.22\nFunctions of the TNF-a signal pathway are\nmediated by nuclear factor-kB, which is also\nresponsible for the endothelial expression of\nadhesion molecules such as ICAM-1 and\nVCAM-1.21 Increased expression of\nICAM-1 may play an important role in the\nAlthough hypothyroidism has been reported\nto be responsible for an increased risk of\natherosclerotic heart disease, outcomes of\nprospective studies are inconclusive.26,27\nOne study revealed an association between\nSHO and atherosclerosis and myocardial\ninfarction in older women,26 and further\nstudies have claimed that levothyroxine\nreplacement therapy in those with manifest\nor SHO has improved atherosclerotic signs\nfollow-up study failed to find any correl-\nation between TSH levels and ischaemic\nAdhesion is important in the tumoural\ninvasion of endothelial cells, and this pro-\ncess is mediated by ICAM-1 and E-selec-\ntin.32,33 Generally, immune cells play a\ncrucial role in the suppression of tumour\nmetastases. ICAM-1 binds to lymphocytes\nto suppress immune cell functions, acting as\nan immunosuppressive substance. The cor-\nrelation between ICAM-1 molecules and\ncancer cells, and the increase in ICAM-1\nexpression from cancer cells that is related to\nprogression or metastases, have been used to\nsupport this view.34 The correlation between\nsoluble forms of adhesion molecules and\ntumour\u00adnode\u00admetastasis staging, and also\nbetween development of metastasis in gas-\ntric, colorectal and breast cancers has also\nThe aim of the present study was to\ndetermine the correlation between TSH\nlevels and sICAM-1, sVCAM-1 and\nE-selectin values in patients with SHO. In\npatients with SHO, pretreatment sICAM-1\nlevels were found to be significantly higher\nthan those found in healthy controls\nafter 3 months of levothyroxine therapy. In\nour study, the drop in sICAM-1 levels with\nlevothyroxine reflects the favourable effects\nof treatment. The administration of\nlevothyroxine therapy to those with SHO\ncould prevent atherosclerotic processes and\nrelated cardiovascular diseases, and possibly\nprevent the future development of malig-\nnancy. s-ICAM is an indicator of the\namount of inflammation in disease states;\nit is likely that levothyroxine use reduced the\nthyroid autoimmune process, as shown in\nour results through the post-treatment\nreduction in the sICAM-1 level.\nSeveral potential limitations of our study\nshould be addressed. First, the duration of\nour study was 3 months, which was very\nshort. Second, the pre-and post-treatment\nantibody titres should have been defined in\nall patients. Another possible limitation is\nthe fact that intima media thickness and\nhigh density lipoprotein/low density lipo-\nprotein ratios were not defined, as these\nwould provide further links to the role of\nadhesion molecules in the development\nof atherosclerosis and cancer. Future studies\nof longer duration, involving larger patient\npopulations in which carotid intima thick-\nnesses are assessed, are needed.\nDeclaration of conflicting of interest\nThe authors had no conflicts of interest to declare\nin relation to this article.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
