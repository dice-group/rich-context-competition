Human females can be\ncompletely certain that their children are their own even if they do not know the identity of\nthe father. Because of concealed ovulation, internal fertilization, and risk of female\ninfidelity, however, human males can never be completely certain of their paternity. Thus,\nthe problem of paternity certainty is hypothesized to be an adaptive problem for human\nfathers. According to kin selection theory, psychological adaptations may have evolved to\nregulate investment in kin according to the degree of genetic certainty. These adaptations\nare hypothesized to produce a differential in male and female investment psychology. The\nlogic of this psychology should extend to kin altruism of several types. Research on the\ndifferential investment patterns of aunts and uncles (Gaulin, McBurney, and Brakeman-\nhas been consistent with this prediction. The purpose of the present investigation is to test\npredictions about grandparental solicitude using a sample of undergraduates who report\nfour living grandparents.\nFor human grandparents parental uncertainty may be present in two generations of\ndescendents. Grandfathers, for example, cannot be completely certain of the paternity of\ntheir sons or daughters and paternal grandparents cannot be completely certain that their\nson's children are really their grandchildren. Maternal grandmothers, in contrast, are\ncompletely certain that their daughters are really their own and that their daughter's\nchildren are really their grandchildren. Thus, for grandparents, genetic relatedness may\nvary from completely certain to doubly uncertain. Again, kin selection theory predicts that\npsychological adaptations may have evolved to regulate the investment in grandchildren as\na function of genetic certainty. Smith (1988) predicted that investment should vary as a\nfunction of this certainty of relatedness: most for maternal grandmothers (MoMo; 0\nuncertain links), least for paternal grandfathers (FaFa; 2 uncertain links), and intermediate\nlevels for maternal grandfathers (MoFa; 1 uncertain link) and paternal grandmothers\n(FaMo; 1 uncertain link). Following Daly and Wilson's (1980) \"discriminative parental\nsolicitude,\" Euler and Weitzel (1996) termed this differential investment \"discriminative\ngrandparental solicitude.\"\nWhen grandparents are directly questioned about the discriminative care directed to\ngrandchildren their self-investment statements often suggest impartiality and equality of\ncare (Fischer, 1983; Thomas, 1989). Grandparents may not be inclined to declare, or may\nnot be aware of, differential favoritism (for exceptions to this tendency, see Michalski and\nShackelford, 2005; Pollet, Nettle, and Nelissen, 2006). Self-descriptive statements about\nreceived solicitude, however, seem to be less influenced by such social desirability effects.\nConsequently, research has typically focused on the recipients of discriminative care--the\ngrandchildren. Hoffman (1979-80) asked undergraduate females, with at least one living\ngrandparent, to report on the frequency of contact with, and their perceived closeness to,\neach living grandparent. These grandchildren reported greater interactions with and being\nemotionally closer to their maternal grandparents (one shared uncertain link) than paternal\ngrandparents (three possible uncertain links). Hartshorne and Manaster (1982) assessed the\namount of contact between adult grandchildren and each living grandparent at three time\nperiods: now, while in high school, and when home full time. Consistent with the\nuncertainty hypothesis, grandchildren had the most contact with MoMo (no uncertain links)\nGrandparental solicitude\nand the least contact with FaFa (2 possible uncertain links); contact with FaMo and MoFa\nwas intermediate (1 uncertain link). Euler and Weitzel (1996) had German adults rate (on a\nseven-point scale) how much each biological grandparent had cared for them up until the\nage of seven. Once again, the grandparent with the greatest degree of genetic certainty\n(MoMo) invested the most, whereas the grandparent with the least degree of genetic\ncertainty (FaFa) invested the least. Salmon (1999) asked Canadian undergraduates to report\nthe frequencies of contact per annum (visits and phone calls) with their maternal and\npaternal grandparents. These grandchildren reported more frequent contact with maternal\ngrandparents (one shared uncertain link) than paternal grandparents (three possible\nuncertain links). In a study by Pashos (2000), Greek and German adults estimated (on a\nseven-point scale) how much each grandparent had cared for them until the age of 7. Urban\nGreek and German ratings were generally consistent with the ordinal rankings found in\nprior studies. Finally, Laham, Gonsalkorale, and von Hippel (2005) replicated the\ndifferential grandparental investment effect in a sample of Australian psychology students.\nRespondents rated their emotional closeness to each of the biological grandparents they\ncould remember on a 0-100 \"feelings thermometer.\" As predicted, respondents reported\ngreater emotional closeness to their MoMo, followed by the MoFa, then the FaMo, and\nfinally the FaFa. While these studies are notable in their consistency in documenting the\nsolicitude effect, they share the significant limitation that not all grandparents were living at\nthe time of the self-report.\nRecently, Laham, Gonsalkorale, and von Hippel (2005) have hypothesized that the\ntwo grandparent types with one uncertain link each will show an investment differential\nunder certain circumstances. Specifically, MoFa will invest more in their grandchildren\nrelative to FaMo because some FaMo will have genetically more certain outlets available to\nthem. If cousins are available through the father's sisters, a FaMo will have investment\noutlets that are more certain than her investment outlet with her son. Consequently, she\nmay invest in her daughter's children more heavily than her son's children. In contrast, a\nMoFa will not have a more certain outlet for his investment even if cousins are available\nthrough the mother's sisters. Thus, the \"preferential investment hypothesis\" predicts that\nthe preference for the MoFa should be significant only when there are cousins through the\nfather's sisters. In a test of this hypothesis, respondents were asked to report how many\nbiological aunts and uncles they had on both sides of the family and how many biological\nchildren each of these relatives have. As predicted by the preferential investment\nhypothesis, MoFa were rated more highly than FaMo only when FaMo had grandchildren\nvia their daughters.\nThe purpose of the present investigation was to test the hypotheses of discriminative\ngrandparental solicitude and preferential investment using a sample of undergraduates who\nreport four living grandparents. Extant tests of grandparental solicitude have relied either\non retrospective reports of grandparental relationships from a given point in childhood or\non reports of current relationships with at least one living grandparent. Reports of the\nformer type return to a period in the respondent's life when all grandparents are more likely\nto be alive, and hence, differential solicitude can be assessed. This report strategy cannot\nassess current investment behavior or current emotional closeness and may suffer from\nretrospective distortion (e.g., second-hand descriptions of grandparents). Reports of the\nlatter type allow the assessment of current investment behavior and emotional closeness but\nsuffer from differential grandparent mortality, making assessment of differential solicitude\nGrandparental solicitude\nquestionable. In one study, for example, approximately 60% of MoMo were still living at\nsome degree of differential investment should be evident despite differential mortality, an\nunconfounded test of this effect requires living grandparents in each category. To date, no\nstudy has tested the differential solicitude effect while insisting on four living grandparents.\nBy restricting our sample to grandchildren with four living biological grandparents, we\ncould assess differential investment and preferential investment by directly examining the\ntwo-way exchange of various investment behaviors between grandchild and grandparent\ntype. In addition to a \"feelings thermometer\" rating, we asked respondents to indicate the\nnumber of telephone calls made, letters written, gifts given, etc. These behaviors should\nalso reflect the closeness of the grandchild and grandparent dyad and may be less prone to\nresponse bias and/or retrospective distortion. We tested the following predictions: (a)\nreported investment behavior and rated closeness between grandchildren and grandparents\nwill vary as a function of the number of uncertain links between grandparents and\ngrandchildren and (b) the investment of MoFa will be greater than the investment of FaMo\nonly when there are cousins through the father's sisters.\nMaterials and Methods\nRespondents\n1.15) from a Midwestern liberal arts college were approached opportunistically at their\nplace of residence and asked to complete a series of questionnaires about their relatives.\nOnly students who reported having four living biological grandparents were asked to\ncomplete the questionnaires. Upon completion of the questionnaires the students received a\nredeemable delicatessen coupon.\nProcedure\nThe questionnaire packet consisted of a participant data sheet and four\nquestionnaires. The data sheet required that respondents list the names of their grandparents\nby relationship (e.g., Paternal grandfather's name (your father's father): list name here) and\ntheir respective place of residence. The data sheet also required that respondents list\npaternal and maternal aunts and uncles and their respective number of biological children.\nFollowing the completion of the data sheet, respondents were asked to complete a\none page questionnaire about each of their four living grandparents. Each questionnaire\nconsisted of 12 questions (see Table 1) pertaining to the grandparent listed at the top of the\npage. Eleven of the questions asked the respondent to report on the frequency of a behavior\ndirected to a grandparent (over the last year) or the frequency of a behavior received from a\ngrandparent (over the last year). One question asked the respondent to report their degree of\nemotional closeness (on a 0-100 scale) to the grandparent in question. The presentation of\nthe grandparent questionnaires within a packet was counterbalanced.\nGrandparental solicitude\nResults\nTransformation of raw scores\nA preliminary screen of the distributions of the raw scores from each question\nrevealed significant skew. Questions 1 through 11 were positively skewed and question 12\nwas negatively skewed. Following transformation procedures suggested by Tabachnick and\nFidell (2001), raw scores were transformed to achieve closer approximations to normality.\nA value of 1 was added to each score on questions 1 through 11 to remove zero as a value.\nQuestions 1 through 11 were then re-expressed using a logarithmic transformation. On\nquestion 12 each score was subtracted from a constant (largest possible value + 1) and then\nre-expressed using a logarithmic transformation. These transformations achieved closer\napproximations to normality.\nDifferential solicitude by number of uncertain links\nMeans and standard errors for each grandparent by question (before transformation)\nare presented in Figure 1. A series of repeated-measures ANOVAs (on transformed scores)\nconfirmed that investment behavior and rated closeness between grandchildren and\ngrandparents varied as a function of the number of uncertain links (see Table 1 for\ntransformed means and standard errors). There was a significant effect of grandparent type\non all 12 questions. A significant linear trend was confirmed for 10 of these 12 measures.\nAs predicted, grandchildren reported the greatest contact and the highest level of rated\ncloseness with MoMo (0 uncertain links) and lowest level of contact and the lowest rated\ncloseness with FaFa (2 uncertain links). As predicted, MoFa (1 uncertain link) and FaMo\n(1 uncertain link) were intermediate on all of the measures. Although MoFa were rated\nhigher on some measures and FaMo on others, planned comparisons of adjacent group\nmeans showed that MoFa and FaMo were significantly different on only question 6\ntransformation, there was a significant effect for grandparent type on only 9 of the 12\nquestions. The presence of a significant linear trend was confirmed for 8 of the 9 measures.\nDistance between each grandparent and reporting grandchild\nThe residential distance between grandparent and grandchild has been considered a\npotential confounding variable by previous researchers (Euler and Wietzel, 1996; Pashos,\n2000). For example, the distance between grandparent and grandchild might affect the\nfrequency of visits to and from grandparents. To assess the influence of this potential\nconfound, we calculated the distance in miles between the residential cities of the\nrespondent and each of their four grandparents using the web-based Geobytes City\nDistance Tool. This tool calculates distance \"as the crow flies\" using the longitude and\nlatitude of each city. The four distances were then entered as covariates into a series of\none-way repeated-measures ANCOVAs (on transformed scores). Distance as a covariate\nwas significant only on items 7 (visited grandparent), 8 (grandparent visited), and 11 (give\na gift). Nevertheless, the covariate-adjusted means for these three items were virtually\nidentical to the means reported in Table 1 above. Consequently, distance does not seem to\naffect the patterns of differential solicitude assessed in this study.\nGrandparental solicitude\nFigure 1.

A series of 2 (MoFa vs. FaMo) by\n2 (no cousins vs. cousins) repeated-measures ANOVAs was performed on each investment\nquestion. Transformed means and standard errors for MoFa and FaMo as a function of\ncousins by the father's sisters and interaction F statistics are presented in Table 2. The\npredicted interaction for question 1 (called grandparent) was significant. Contrary to\npredictions, however, simple effects analysis revealed that MoFa scores were not\nsignificantly higher than FaMo scores when FaMo have grandchildren via their daughters,\n= -1.60, p > .05. The predicted interaction for question 2 (grandparent called) was\nsignificant. Contrary to predictions, simple effects analysis revealed that FaMo scores were\nsignificantly higher than MoFa scores when FaMo have grandchildren via their daughters,\n= -2.60, p < .05. The predicted interaction for question 7 (visited grandparent) was\nsignificant. Simple effects analysis revealed that MoFa scores were not significantly\ndifferent from FaMo scores when FaMo have grandchildren via their daughters, t102\np > .05. The predicted interaction for question 8 (grandparent visited) was significant.\nOnce again, simple effects analysis revealed that MoFa scores were not significantly\ndifferent from FaMo scores when FaMo have grandchildren via their daughters, t102\n=\n-1.48, p > .05. The predicted interaction for question 10 (received gift) was significant.\nGrandparental solicitude\nConsistent with prior analyses, the simple effects analysis revealed that MoFa scores were\nnot significantly different from FaMo scores when FaMo have grandchildren via their\n= -.84, p > .05. Finally, the predicted interaction for question 12 (rated\ncloseness) was significant. Contrary to predictions, simple effects analysis revealed that\nMoFa scores were not significantly different from FaMo scores when FaMo have\ngrandchildren via their daughters, t102\n= .91, p > .05. The predicted interactions for\nquestions 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, and 11 were not significant. A parallel set of analyses was conducted\non the data before transformation. Without the transformation, the predicted interactions for\nsignificant interaction, simple effects analysis revealed that MoFa scores were not\nsignificantly higher than FaMo scores when FaMo have grandchildren via their daughters.\nDiscussion\nThe present study replicates and extends the work on discriminative grandparental\nsolicitude by assessing multiple acts of investment behavior and emotional closeness with\nfour living grandparents. By restricting our sample of grandchildren to those who report\nfour living grandparents, we could ask respondents to report actual behaviors received from\nor directed to living grandparents. In addition to these direct behavioral measures, we also\nemployed the single-item rating of emotional closeness used in prior investigations.\nGrandparental solicitude\nConsistent with the predictions of Smith (1988), there was a significant inverse linear trend\nbetween reported acts of solicitude and degree of parental uncertainty. Grandchildren\nreported the greatest contact and the highest level of rated closeness with MoMo (0\nuncertain links) and lowest level of contact and the lowest rated closeness with FaFa (2\nuncertain links). As expected, MoFa (1 uncertain link) and FaMo (1 uncertain link) were\nrated as intermediate and were not reliably different. Moreover, the discriminative\nsolicitude effect was present on both behaviors received from grandparents and directed to\ngrandparents. MoMo were more likely to write, give gifts, visit, send money, and call than\nFaFa. MoMo were also more likely to receive a gift, receive a call, and receive a visit than\nthe FaFa. Our findings are consistent with prior investigations based on retrospective\nreports from childhood and contemporaneous reports of investment behavior with a subset\nof living grandparents. To our knowledge, this is the first study testing differential\ngrandparental investment that has required all four grandparents to be alive at the time of\nthe assessment.\nDifferential grandparental solicitude has also been studied by decomposing the four\ngrandparent types into their two constituent components; namely, sex of grandparent and\nside of family. This approach to grandparental altruism treats sex of grandparent and side\nof family as independent effects and implies different underlying causal mechanisms for\neach effect. A number of researchers have approached differential grandparental\ninvestment from this perspective and reported both main effects and interactions (Hoffman,\naffect sex of grandparent and side of family (as independent effects) differently, the\npresence of the reliable linear relationship between grandparent types requires that\nstatements about main effects be carefully qualified. For example, as Euler and Weitzel\n(1996) correctly note, grandmotherly solicitude does not apply to both grandmothers\nequally but is more pronounced in the maternal grandmother. As our study confirms, the\ndifferentiation of all grandparent types yields the predicted linear function of solicitude on\nmost of the variables we examined. Jeon and Buss (2007) have recently extended this same\nlogic to the study of differential altruism among cousins.\nWe also tested the preferential investment hypothesis using multiple measures of\ninvestment and closeness with four living grandparents. Laham, Gonsalkorale, and von\nHippel (2005) proposed that FaMo will invest less in their son's grandchildren when they\nalso have grandchildren through their daughters. Under these circumstances, MoFa should\nmake a greater investment in their grandchildren relative to FaMo. Contrary to the\npredictions of the preferential investment hypothesis, grandchildren did not rate the MoFa\nconsistently higher on the direct behavioral indices or on closeness when more certain\ninvestment outlets were available to the FaMo. For grandparents who each have one\nuncertain link, the presence of more certain investment outlets does not seem to affect the\ncalculus of their investment. While these findings call into question the preferential\ninvestment hypothesis, the findings are nevertheless consistent with the hypothesis of\ndifferential grandparental solicitude.\nIn the human species parental certainty is asymmetrical; consequently, both parental\nand grandparental solicitude should be discriminating. On both direct measures of\ninvestment and rated closeness with four living grandparents, we found that grandparental\nsolicitude varied predictably as a function of parental certainty. Although we found no\nsupport for the preferential investment hypothesis when all four grandparents were alive,\nGrandparental solicitude\nother moderator variables have been identified (for a review of these moderator variables\nsee Euler and Michalski, 2007) and should be tested using this design. Future studies\nshould also replicate the solicitude effect in diverse cultures using different direct measures\nof investment appropriate to the particular culture. The actual investment behaviors\nreceived from or directed to grandparents will likely show great cross-cultural variability\nbut should, nevertheless, reveal the calculus of differential investment. Finally, future\nstudies should employ this design to document the differential investment effect with\nmultiple siblings from the same family. Presumably, the age of the grandchild as well as\ntheir genetic certainty will affect grandparental investment. Although important questions\nremain, our findings add to a growing body of evidence demonstrating the robust nature of\nthe differential grandparental solicitude effect.\n"
