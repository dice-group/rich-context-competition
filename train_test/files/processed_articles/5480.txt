    "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nThe Notch pathway is a highly conserved signaling system\nessential for modulating neurogenesis and promoting astro-\ngenesis. Similarly, the cAMP signaling cascade can promote\nastrocytic commitment in several cell culture models, such\nas the C6 glioma cell line. These cells have the capacity\nto differentiate into oligodendrocytes or astrocytes, char-\nacteristics that allow their use as a glial progenitor model.\nIn this context, we explore here the plausible involvement\nof cAMP in Notch-dependent signal transactions. The ex-\nposure of C6 cells to a non-hydrolysable cAMP analogue\nresulted in a sustained augmentation of Notch activity, as\ndetected by nuclear translocation of its intracellular domain\nportion (NICD) and transcriptional activity. The cAMP ef-\nfect is mediated through the activation of the -secretase\ncomplex, responsible for Notch cleavage and is sensitive to\ninhibitors of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, PKA. As\nexpected, Notch cleavage and nuclear translocation resulted\nin the up-regulation of the mRNA levels of one of its target\ngenes, the transcription factor Hair and enhancer of split\n5. Moreover, the glutamate uptake activity, as well as the\nexpression of astrocytic markers such as glial fibrillary acidic\nprotein, S100 protein and GLAST was also enhanced in\ncAMP-exposed cells. Our results clearly suggest that during\nthe process of C6 astrocytic differentiation, cAMP activates\nthe PKA/-secretase/NICD/RBPJ pathway and Notch1 ex-\npression, leading to transcriptional activation of the genes\nresponsible for glial progenitor cell fate decision.\nr r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r\n1 To whom correspondence should be addressed (email ebayghen@cinvestav.mx).\nAbbreviations: ADAM, a disintegrin and metalloprotease; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; CNS, central nervous system; CRE, cAMP-response element; CREB,\ncAMP-responsive element binding protein; dbcAMP, dibutyryl-cAMP; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase;\nGFAP, glial fibrillary acid protein; IL-6, interleukin-6; JAK, Janus kinase; NICD, Notch1 intracellular domain; NPC, neuronal progenitor cell; NSC, neural stem cell; PAC1, PACAP\n(pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide) ligand/type 1 receptor; PACAP, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide; PKA, protein kinase A; RBPJ,\nrecombinant binding protein for immunoglobulin  region; RT\u00adqPCR, reverse transcription\u00adquantitative PCR; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription.\nC 2013 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Licence (CC-BY)\n(http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) which permits unrestricted use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\n",

Astrocyte differentiation is regulated by dif-\nferent extracellular stimuli. Among these, the BMP (bone\nmorphogenic protein), IL-6 (interleukin-6) and neuropep-\ntide PAC1 [PACAP (pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating\npolypeptide) ligand/type 1 receptor] systems have been char-\nDuring development, alterations in the ratio of neurons\nto glia may severely perturb neuronal function. The sem-\ninal observation that neurons are generated prior to glia,\nsuggests that newly generated neurons signal to NPCs (neu-\nronal progenitor cells) to regulate their cellular fate (Tem-\nple, 2001). The molecular basis of this signaling has not\nbeen completely described, although an interplay between\nthe extracellular cues and intracellular mechanisms in which\ncell\u00adcell interactions occurs is expected. In fact, embryonic\nNPCs generate neurons only when they are cultured on\ntop of embryonic cortical slices, in contrast with an en-\nhanced gliogenesis if cells are plated upon adult cortical\nC. Angulo-Rojo and others\nslices, clearly suggesting that secreted NPC factors regu-\nlate the switch from neurogenesis to astrocyte production\n(Morrow et al., 2001). More recently, the involvement of\nmembers of the IL-6 cytokine family has been described\nas promoters of astrocytic differentiation. Specifically, CT-\n1 (cardiotropin-1) induces glia commitment in mouse NPCs\nvia the JAK (Janus kinase)/STAT (signal transducer and ac-\ntivator of transcription) pathway (Barnabe-Heider et al.,\nNotch1 is a member of a conserved family of transmem-\nbrane receptors that participate in cell fate decision during\ndevelopment. Notch family members, are activated by the\nDelta-like and Jagged ligands. Upon ligand binding, Notch1\nundergoes a concerted action of the proteolytic enzymes\nADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease)/TACE [TNF (tumor\nnecrosis factor)-converting enzyme]/-secretase that ulti-\nmately release the NICD (Notch1 intracellular domain). The\nNICD is translocated into the nucleus transforming the CBF1\n[RBPJ (recombinant binding protein for immunoglobulin\n region)]/Su(H)/LAG1(CSL) repressor complex into an acti-\nvator that induces the transcription of a variety of genes.\nThese include the family of transcription factors Hes and\nHey, known to play a critical role in pro-neural gene re-\npression (Kopan and Ilagan, 2009). In this context, a role\nfor Notch signaling in the NPC-mediated switch to glio-\ngenesis has been suggested (Namihira et al., 2009). NICD\nup-regulates NFI (nuclear factor I), a member of the CCAAT\nbox element-binding family of transcription factors. Sev-\neral lines of evidence indicate that active Notch signaling\nblocks neurogenesis while promoting astrogenesis. Whether\nNotch is a permissive or an instructive pathway is not clear\nat this moment (Stockhausen et al., 2010). The cAMP signal-\ning cascade has long been known to be critically involved in\ntranscriptional regulation. The CREB (cAMP-responsive ele-\nment binding protein) is one of the most studied transcription\nfactors that participate in CNS differentiation (Merz et al.,\n2011). PACAP, as noted above, is a known glial promoting\nagent that exerts its activity through G-protein-coupled re-\nceptors, leading to an increase in cAMP levels and resulting\nin an augmentation of the expression of astrocytic genes,\nsuch as the intermediate filament GFAP (glial fibrillary acid\nprotein) (Tatsuno et al., 1996). Nestin, another intermedi-\nate filament, is transiently expressed in neuroepithelial stem\ncells of the developing CNS and has been regarded as a useful\nmarker for glial developing cells due to its down-regulation\ncorrelating with differentiation into astrocytes, oligodendro-\ncytes or neurons (Lendahl et al., 1990; Hendrickson et al.,\nThe glioblastoma-derived C6 cell line is morphologically\nsimilar to glial precursors and expresses low GFAP levels (re-\nviewed in Grobben et al., 2002). The treatment of these cells\nwith dbcAMP (dibutyryl-cAMP) results in a change in their\nmorphology and the subsequent expression of the astrocytic\nmarkers S100 and GFAP, and an increase in [3H]D-aspartate\nAll these observations prompted us to analyze the plau-\nsible cAMP/Notch1 interplay during astrocytic differentia-\ntion. To this end, C6 cells were differentiated by dbcAMP\ntreatment, and the expression of GFAP, S100 and the Na+ -\ndependent glutamate/aspartate transporter (GLAST) was in-\nvestigated. We were able to establish that cAMP effects\nare mediated through PKA (protein kinase A) and that the\nNICD/RBPJ pathway regulates GFAP, S100, Notch1 and\nGLAST expression, supporting the idea that Notch1 acts as a\npermissive pathway in gliogenesis.\nReagents\ndbcAMP, H89 and Forskolin were all obtained from Sigma\u00ad\nAldrich.

First,\nby immunostaining with an antibody directed against the\nC-terminal end of Notch1 that was used to locate the nu-\nclear and cytoplasmic protein and to image its co-localization\nwith a nuclear marker, RNA pol II. As depicted in Figure 1(A),\nafter 24 h of dbcAMP exposure (750 M), nuclear staining\nfor Notch was increased (merged images). To test whether\nPKA activation leads to NICD nuclear translocation, we took\nadvantage of the PKA inhibitor H89, noticing a clear block-\nage in nuclear translocation and also in the global Notch1\nexpression (Figure 1A).\nNuclear Notch signal was also quantified after treatment\nby recording co-localization ratios (see the Materials and\nmethods section) for anti-Notch1-stained cells when nuclei\nwere counterstained with DAPI. We did notice a 2-fold in-\ncrease in the nuclear signal (histogram in 1B). In line with\nthe results obtained in Figure 1(A), H89 blocks NICD nuclear\ntranslocation, meaning that the dbcAMP effect was com-\npletely abrogated. As expected, -secretase inhibition using\nDAPT also decreased NICD nuclear translocation by 50% in\ncomparison with dbcAMP-treated cells (Figure 1B).\nAs a second approach, cleaved NICD was located (im-\nmunostained) using a specific antibody that recognizes\nVal1744, only detectable when NICD has been released by\nthe action of -secretase. The cleaved form of Notch1 is\nlocated in the nuclei of C6 cells after 24 h of dbcAMP ex-\nposure (750 M). Note that the same pathway (PKA and -\nsecretase), is responsible for this localization (Figure 2A). The\nnuclear NICD observed in Figure 2(A), clearly comes from the\nspecific cut induced after treatment, as Western blot analysis\nusing nuclear extracts from dbcAMP-treated cells demon-\nstrate an enhanced signal that matches with the decrease in\nthe NICD cytoplasm detection (Figure 2B). Again, blockage\nof the PKA pathway avoids the appearance of nuclear NICD.\nInterestingly, a total disappearance from the nuclei is again\nclearly evident when both inhibitors are used, suggesting a\ncross-talk between PKA activation and the NICD cleavage\nthat leads to NICD nuclear translocation. In this scenario,\nDAPT blocks all signal (Figure 2C).\nCross-talk between PKA activation and\nNICD/RBPJ-dependent transcription\nNICD/RBPJ-dependent transcription in dbcAMP-treated\ncells was determined using a reporter system directed by four\nRBPJ-responsive elements (p4xwtCBF1Luc). As a positive\ncontrol, C6 cells were co-transfected using the RBPJ reporter\nFigure 1 dbcAMP-PKA activation precedes NICD nuclear translocation in\nC6 cells were treated with dbcAMP (750 M); where indicated, the PKA in-\nhibitor H89 (10 M) or the -secretase inhibitor DAPT (40 M) were added\n30 min before dbcAMP; 24 h after treatment, cultures were processed for\nimmunostaining.

As\nexpected, the 4xwtCBF1Luc vector activity, dependent on\nRBPJ activation by NICD, showed a 6-fold increase in lu-\nciferase activity (Figure 3A).

Forskolin, an established adenylate cy-\nclase activator, augmented the NICD/RBPJ-dependent tran-\nserved with dbcAMP. Co-treatment with forskolin and H89\nwas used as a positive control. The increase in NICD/RBPJk-\ndependent transcription observed with dbcAMP was signif-\nicantly decreased (40%) when -secretase was inhibited\n(P < 0.05) (Figure 3B). Additionally, PKA/CREB activation\nwas evaluated with a CAT reporter plasmid directed by five\nCREB-responsive elements in dbcAMP-treated cells. The re-\nsults shown in Figure 3(C) depict a 6-fold increase in CREB-\nA consequence of CREB activation is PEN-2 up-regulation,\nas was previously demonstrated (Wang et al., 2006). PEN-2\nexpression was determined measuring mRNA and protein lev-\nels under dbcAMP treatment. Under these conditions, PEN-\n2 protein and mRNA levels were increased, reaching max-\nimum by the second day after treatment (Figures 3D and\n3E). The latter effect on mRNA levels was blocked when the\nPKA inhibitor was added (Figure 3D).

In our hands, the differentiation\nmarkers GFAP and S100 mRNA levels also reached their\nmaximum by the first and second day after treatment, re-\nspectively (Figure 5A). Interestingly, GFAP mRNA expression\ndecreased during the following days of treatment, whereas\nS100 levels remained fairly stable. Nevertheless, the expres-\nsion of both markers was always above basal levels shown\nby non-treated controls (followed and harvested at the same\ntime/conditions in each case, see Figure legend). Similar to\nGFAP mRNA expression, GLAST mRNA showed an increase\nafter the first day of treatment that gradually declined\nthroughout the differentiation period. Accordingly, GLAST\nfunction detected through [3H]D-aspartate uptake was also\nincreased (Figure 5B). Interestingly, while GLAST mRNA levels\ndecreased after day 1, the [3H]D-aspartate uptake activity in-\ncreased during the differentiation program (Figure 5B). Mor-\nphological changes were also present with dbcAMP (750 M)\ntreatment. A bipolar to stellate-like phenotype was observed\nfrom the first day of treatment. The cell body decreased grad-\nually and reached its minimum at day seven; conversely, the\nlength of cell elongations was also gradually augmented (Fig-\nure 5C). Additionally, a progressive disappearance of nestin,\nthe intermediate filament marker for neural precursor cells\nwas also noticed (data not shown).\nTo confirm that PKA signaling is upstream of the Notch\npathway signaling in astrocytic differentiation of C6 cells,\nGLAST function ([3H]D-aspartate uptake) and GFAP transcrip-\ntion were challenged with H89 and DAPT inhibitors and both\nwere effectively blocked (Figure 6). We then decided to ex-\nplore the effects of H89 and DAPT directly on the activity\nof the GFAP promoter. As expected, dbcAMP increased GFAP\npromoter transcription by 2-fold; however, this effect was di-\nminished upon PKA or Notch receptor blockage by 50% and\n100%, respectively, suggesting that PKA-mediated effects\nare partly dependent on Notch-1. To test this interpretation,\ncells were pre-exposed to DAPT and H89 at the same time.\nCo-transfection assays were performed with 1.25 g of 4xwtCBF1Luc or 4xmtCBF1Luc and 3.75 g of NICD expressing vector (pFCDN1\nand the pEF1a-BOS empty vector used as controls). (B) At 24 h after transfection with 0.5 g of 4xwtCBF1Luc vector, cultures were\ntreated with dbcAMP (750 M) or forskolin (FSK, PKA inductor, indicated concentrations) for another 24 h; inhibitors were added 30 min\nbefore dbcAMP or FSK. (C) C6 cells were transfected with 2 g of pCRE-CAT reporter construct, and 24 h after transfection treated with\ndbcAMP or FSK (as indicated) for another 24 h. In all cases, data are shown as relative to the activities in the non-treated (NT) control\nor the control co-transfected with the empty vector.

A fine tuning of the ratio of\nneurons to glia cells is needed for the proper development\nof the neuronal circuits (Chenn, 2009). An established role\nfor PACAP in gliogenesis is well documented; under physio-\nlogical conditions increased cAMP levels regulate GFAP gene\nexpression (Tatsuno et al., 1996). Furthermore, it has been re-\nported that PAC1 activation initiates morphological changes\nrepresented as process elongation in NPCs. Interestingly, in\nthis system, the IP3\n(inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate)/PKC (protein\nkinase C) pathway, rather than the cAMP/PKA cascade is\ninvolved in the induction of an astrocyte-like morphology\nIn the C6 cell model system, increasing cAMP levels ac-\ntivates PKA, stimulates IL-6 production, and consequently\nincreases GFAP transcription via a PKA-CREB and JAK-STAT3\nsignaling cascade (Takanaga et al., 2004). Notch signaling is\nanother key pathway implicated in astrogenesis (de la Pompa\nthis in mind, we decided to test whether these two signal-\ning systems overlap in C6 differentiation. To our surprise,\nwe found that the non-hydrolysable cAMP analog, dbcAMP,\ntriggers Notch signaling in a PKA-dependent manner. Al-\nthough undifferentiated C6 cells express Notch ligands (data\nnot shown), a barely detectable Notch activity is present in\nthese cells independently of their confluence. In sharp con-\ntrast, dbcAMP exposure leads to an efficient NICD nuclear\ntranslocation and NICD/RBPJ-dependent transcription. Thus\nfar, NICD/RBPJk has been known to be activated only by the\nreceptor\u00adligand interaction (Blaumueller et al., 1997). How-\never, during vascular development, increased cAMP levels\nlead to Notch pathway activation to induce arterial endothe-\nlial cells from vascular progenitors (Yurugi-Kobayashi et al.,\nOur results suggest that C6 cells are useful for the study of\nastrocyte differentiation. The exposure of C6 cell monolayers\nto dbcAMP induces astrocytic morphological changes and\nthe expression of the astrocytic markers GFAP, S100\nand GLAST (Figure 5). A concomitant increase in [3H]D-\naspartate uptake and a down-regulation of nestin expression\n(data not shown), an accepted marker for NSCs (neural stem\ncells) or glial progenitors (Mignone et al., 2004), confirms the\nrole of dbcAMP in astrocyte differentiation (Tatsuno et al.,\nand GFAP were also used as astrocytic markers because radial\nglia or adult NSCs do not express S100, and oligodendro-\ncytes do not express GFAP (Hachem et al. 2005; Cahoy et al.\n2008).

Angulo-Rojo and others\nFigure 8 Current model\ncAMP/PKA/CREB and NICD/RBPJ signaling regulate the expression of the astrocytic marker GFAP and the Notch pathway components\n(Notch1 receptor and Hes5 transcription factor) during astrocytic differentiation of C6 cells.\nIt is important to mention that PKA activation was neces-\nsary for Notch pathway activation (Figures 2\u00ad4). At this stage,\nthe obvious question of the mechanism involved in cAMP-\nNotch activation arose. In this context, it is known that Notch\nreceptor cleavage is regulated by the -secretase complex,\nand that this activity is regulated by auto-proteolysis of pre-\nsenilin (the catalytic subunit) initiated by PEN-2 assembly\nPEN-2 regulation, and thus -secretase assembly, depends on\nthe CREB transcription factor (Wang et al., 2006) providing a\nclue for the interpretation of the present results. During C6\nexposure to dbcAMP, PEN-2 is transcriptionally up-regulated\nvia CREB (Figure 3). PEN-2 might be the link between PKA and\nthe Notch pathway, since this component is fundamental in\npresenilin activation in the -secretase complex (Takeo et al.,\n2012). Accordingly, PEN-2 mRNA levels under dbcAMP treat-\nment increase by the first day of treatment, reaching a maxi-\nmum by day 2 (Figures 3D and 3E), therefore it is quite possi-\nble that PKA augments presinilin-1 levels in our system as has\nDuring embryonic development, Hes1 is expressed in the\nearly stages of neuroepithelial cell differentiation to pre-\nvent precocious neurogenesis. In contrast, Hes5 is expressed\nin the late stages, exactly when radial glia undergo the so-\ncalled astrocytic conversion (reviewed in Ohtsuka et al., 1999;\nestingly, in the C6 cell culture system, the cAMP-triggered\nNotch pathway results in Hes5, but not Hes1, expression\n(data not shown). Through the analysis of Hes5 expression,\nwe confirmed that PKA is upstream of Notch activation and\ncapable of regulating Hes5 expression, most likely to block\npro-neuronal gene expression in glial progenitors.\nThe involvement of PKA in C6 astrocytic differentiation\nwas demonstrated by its participation in the regulation of\nGFAP and Notch1 receptor genes; both directly, through\nCREB activation, and indirectly, through Notch receptor\ncleavage and then NICD/RBPJ activation. Independent\nstudies have demonstrated that CREB and NICD/RBPJ regu-\nlate GFAP expression, Ge and co-workers have demonstrated\nthat both STAT3 [activated by a LIF (leukemia inhibitory\n374 C 2013 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Licence (CC-BY) (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) which permits unrestricted use, distribution\nand reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nPKA-mediated Notch activation\nfactor)-JAK stimulus] and NICD/RBPJ are independent path-\nways that regulate GFAP expression (Ge et al., 2002). Our\nresults demonstrate that the NICD/RBPJ complex and CREB\nco-operate to regulate GFAP expression. It is quite possible\nthat CREB and NICD/RBPJ enhance transcription through\nthe recruiting of chromatin-remodeling factors. A plausible\nexplanation would be the recruitment of NICD by interac-\ntion with the phosphorylated form of CREB, and consequent\nbinding of the co-activator p300 (HAT). Such a mechanism\nhas indeed been described for the regulation of granzyme B\nexpression in CD8+ T lymphocytes (Maekawa et al., 2008).\nConsidering that, once activated, the Notch1 receptor sig-\nnals only once, it can be stated that this pathway strictly\ndepends on receptor availability. In fact, the mechanisms\nof transcriptional regulation of the Notch1 receptor during\nneurogenesis and gliogenesis have been suggested (Aguirre\ning that in C6 cells, dbcAMP regulates Notch1 expression\nat the transcriptional level (Figure 7). Furthermore, the in-\ncrease in Notch1 by PKA activity suggests the establishment\nof a positive-feedback loop that could complement our un-\nderstanding of the neurogenesis/gliogenesis switch in the\ndevelopment of the CNS.
