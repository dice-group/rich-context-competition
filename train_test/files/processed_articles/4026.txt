On the other hand, spectral shape cues generated by the head and pinnae play important roles\nin localizing acoustic objects along the vertical plane (elevation) (Blauert, 1970, 1997; Hofman & van\n*Corresponding author.\nEffects of head movement and proprioceptive feedback in\ntraining of sound localization\nAytekin, Moss, and Simon (2008) pointed out in a review article that sound localization is not only\na purely acoustic phenomenon. It is actually a combination of multisensory information processing,\nexperience-dependent plasticity, and movement. Here, we investigated the effects of head movement\nand proprioceptive feedback on the improvement of sound localization.\nWhen we listen to a sound, we sometimes move our head, consciously or unconsciously, to local-\nize it (Wallach, 1939). A listener's head movements are known to be important for the identification of\nthe sound direction of incidence. For example, Thurlow and Runge (1967) revealed that a blindfolded\nperson's head rotation is especially effective at reducing horizontal localization error for both high-\nfrequency and low-frequency noise, as well as click stimuli. In addition, Perrett and Noble (1997)\ndemonstrated that a moving auditory system generates information that can indicate sound sources\npositions, even when the movement does not result in the listener facing the source. More recently,\nresults of sound localization experiments using an acoustical telepresence robot demonstrated that\nhead movement improves horizontal-plane sound localization performance even when the shape of the\ndummy head differs from that of the user's head (Toshima, Aoki, & Hirahara, 2008).\nSimilar findings related to the benefits of head movements have also been observed in animal\nexperiments. For example, Populin (2006) reported that monkeys were able to localize sounds more\naccurately and with less variation when they were allowed free head movement, compared with the\nresults obtained when using a head restraint. Furthermore, Tollin, Populin, Moore, Ruhland, and Yin\n(2005) investigated the sound localization performance of cats that had been trained to indicate the\nlocation of auditory and visual targets via eye position, using operant conditioning with restrained and\nunrestrained head movements. Results revealed that sound localization performance was substantially\nworse in the head-restrained condition relative to that in the head-unrestrained condition (Tollin et al.,\n2005). Consequently, these findings suggest that a listener's head movements are a crucially important\nmethod used for achieving correct sound localization. Furthermore, these findings underscore that\nbinaural time and level disparity cues from a listener's head movements are important for accurate\nhorizontal sound localization.\nWhen learning to localize sounds accurately, we might obtain positional and spatial information\nnot only from active head movements but also from sensory feedback (such as vision, audition, or\nproprioception). Perceptual learning refers to performance changes brought about through practice\nor experience, which improves an organism's ability to respond to its environment (Goldstone, 1998;\nHawkey, Amitay, & Moore, 2004). It is possible that perceptual learning is similar in several respects\nto procedural learning, but procedural learning refers to an improvement in performance at a task aris-\ning from learning its response demands (Hawkey et al., 2004). King (1999) pointed out that previous\nstudies of sound localization conducted on both humans and animals provide evidence for perceptual\nlearning, i.e., improved performance with practice. In this review article, King (1999) reported that the\nplasticity of auditory localization in adults can result from changes in the activity patterns of sensory\ninputs or as a consequence of behavioral training, such as perceptual learning.\nIn fact, several studies have demonstrated that visual systems can train and calibrate the acoustic\nlocalization process by providing accurate spatial feedback. For instance, Hofman, van Riswick, and\nvan Opstal (1998) investigated spatial calibration in the adult human auditory system. Their study\nassessed the accuracy of sound localization in four adult subjects who had custom molds fitted into\ntheir conchae for up to 6 weeks. Subjects received no specific localization training during this period.\nResults demonstrated that localization of sound elevation was dramatically degraded immediately\nafter the modification, but accurate performance was steadily reacquired thereafter. In addition, results\nrevealed that learning the new spectral cues did not interfere with the neural representation of the\noriginal cues because subjects were able to localize sounds with both normal and modified ears. These\nfindings indicated that the adult human auditory system can adjust considerably well in response to\naltered spectral cues after several weeks of passive adaptation. Afterward, they considered the adap-\ntive capability of the human auditory localization system to be contingent on the availability of a suf-\nficiently rich set of spectral cues, as well as on visual feedback related to actual performance in daily\nMore recent studies have specifically examined the effects of active feedback on adaptation of the\nauditory system. For example, Zahorik, Bangayan, Sundareswaran, Wang, and Tam (2006) attempted\nto determine if controlled multimodal feedback related to the correct sound source location engenders\nrapid improvements in sound localization accuracy, presumably through a process of perceptual rec-\nalibration, when spectral cues are inappropriate. In this study, they examined the efficacy of a sound\nProprioceptive feedback in training of sound localization 255\nlocalization training procedure that provided listeners with auditory, visual, and proprioceptive/ves-\ntibular feedback related to the correct sound source position. Spectral cues were modified through the\nuse of a virtual auditory display that used non-individualized head-related transfer functions (HRTFs)\ninstead of the ear-mold manipulation used by Hofman et al. (1998). Results demonstrated that a brief\nperceptual training procedure (two 30-min sessions) that provides listeners with auditory, visual, and\nproprioceptive feedback related to true target locations can improve the localization accuracy for stim-\nulus conditions in which a mismatch in spectral cues to the source direction exists. Additionally, they\nreported that training improvements appear to last for at least four months (Zahorik et al., 2006).\nThese findings from results of previous studies suggest that sound localization learning with accu-\nrate feedback plays an important role in perceptual recalibration of the human auditory system. How-\never, few studies have examined the effects of a listener's proprioceptive feedback on the improvement\nof sound localization accuracy. For instance, Blum, Katz, and Warusfel (2004) reported that providing\nproprioceptive information to blindfolded listeners with normal vision can facilitate recalibration to\naltered spectral cues effectively. Furthermore, Parseihian & Katz (2012) revealed that rapid perceptual\nadaptation to non-individual HRTF through an audio proprioceptive and vestibular feedback is pos-\nsible. In this study, they found that participants using non-individualized HRTFs can cut down locali-\nzation errors in elevation by 10\u00b0 after three 12-min sessions of perceptual adaptation. These findings\nindicate that proprioceptive feedback has beneficial effects on sound localization training. However, it\nremains unclear whether restrictions to the listener's head movement have any impact on the proprio-\nceptive feedback effects on sound localization improvement.\nTherefore, this study investigated the separate and combined effects of both head movement and\nproprioceptive feedback during sound localization training on the accuracy of sound localization after-\nward. The findings of this study might provide some insight into how varied auditory cues and prop-\nrioceptive information contribute to perceptual motor learning.\nParticipants\nThirty-two listeners (16 women and 16 men) participated in this experiment. All participants were\nundergraduate or graduate students of Tohoku University (mean age 5 22.06 years, SD 5 1.50). They\nwere na\u00efve to the purpose of the experiment. All participants reported normal hearing and normal\nor corrected-to-normal vision. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant before\nparticipation in the study.\nApparatus and stimuli\nAll tasks were conducted in a soundproof room with a speaker array comprising 36 loudspeakers posi-\nplane) and elevated to 0\u00b0, 30\u00b0 on the speaker array with a 1.2-m radius. The speaker array frame\nwas covered with sound-absorbing material. The blindfolded participant sat on a chair placed in the\ncenter of the speaker array. The experimenter adjusted the chair height; the participant's ear level was\npositioned at 140-cm elevation (0\u00b0 on the speaker array).\nThe target sound consisted of an AM triangle wave (200 Hz) modulated with a 25-Hz sinusoidal\nenvelope, with a sampling frequency of 32 kHz. The A-weighted sound pressure level (A-weighted\nSPL) of each stimulus was adjusted to 70 dB at the center of the head. The duration of the stimulus was\none second. The target stimulus was delivered through a randomly selected loudspeaker.\nThe background sound was presented to the participant using four loudspeakers that were spaced\nequally outside of the speaker array during the tasks. We used background noise with the intention of\nmasking any noise that might derive from the experimenter. The experimenter checked and recorded\nthe participants' performance near the speaker array to prevent blindfolded participants from falling\noff the chair. The background sound was pink noise. The noise level was maintained at 60 dB at the\ncenter of the head.\nHonda et al. (2007) investigated human sound localization performance using the same speaker\narray system. In their study, participants showed that the average correct rate for initial sound localiza-\ntion tasks was 47% using the same sounds (Honda et al., 2007). This result demonstrates that the sound\nlocalization tasks were neither unreasoningly difficult nor trivial. For this reason, we decided to use the\nsame loudspeaker array as used by Honda et al. (2007).\nProcedure\nAll participants performed all tasks blindfolded. They performed the sound localization task on the\nfirst day (pre-test) and were asked to do the same task 10 days later (post-test), after five practice ses-\nsions. A schematic illustration of the experimental design is presented in Figure 1.\nIn the pre-test, a short rehearsal was conducted for the participants to adapt to the blindfold and the\nexperiment procedure. The pre-test consisted of 72 trials.After the pre-test, all participants were divided\ninto two groups, with restricted or unrestricted head movement for sound localization practice. Both\ngroups were further divided into two subgroups. A feedback group performed sound localization train-\ning with accurate proprioceptive feedback for five days within a 10-day period. Meanwhile, a control\ngroup conducted the training without feedback. During the training phases, all participants were asked\nto conduct 36 trials of a sound localization task. Finally, a post-test was conducted to evaluate changes\nin the sound localization performance of the participants. The post-test consisted of 72 trials. In all cases,\nparticipants were informed that the target sound was delivered through a randomly selected loudspeaker.\nAll participants were asked to enter the loudspeaker array and maintain the head at a specific\nposition (facing a loudspeaker positioned at an azimuth angle of 0\u00b0 and elevation of 0\u00b0) before the\ntarget sound onset. The participants in the unrestricted head movement groups were allowed to change\ntheir head posture freely after the target sound onset. In contrast, the participants in the restricted head\nmovement groups were asked not to move the head even after the target sound onset. In all tasks, the\nparticipants were asked to identify the active loudspeaker position by touching it with a rod (100 cm\nlong, 60 g) after the sound offset. The experimenter asked each participant to pinpoint another direc-\ntion when they localized a position between the loudspeakers (e.g., speaker array frame).\nDuring the training phase, the feedback group was informed orally whether their sound localiza-\ntion was correct or incorrect at each trial. Furthermore, an experimenter led their mislocated rod to\nthe correct loudspeaker position when their localization was inaccurate. In contrast, the control group\nreceived no feedback during the training phases. The experimenter, who was near the loudspeakers,\nconfirmed that all the participants followed the instructions related to head movement during each\ntrial. In this study, we conducted all tasks for the unrestricted head movement condition first. After-\nward, we carried out all tasks for the restricted head movement groups.\nIn this study, all participants showed average sound localization performance during the pre-test (see\nthe Appendix). To obtain an insight into the overall effects of head movement and proprioceptive\nFigure 1. Schematic illustration of the experimental design used.

In the training phases, participants were divided into two groups of either restricted or unrestricted head\nmovement. In addition, both groups were further divided into two subgroups. The training group performed\nsound localization training with accurate proprioceptive feedback for five days within a 10-day period; the control\ngroup did the training without feedback.

Furthermore, the pre-test\nresults showed that the restricted head movement condition group had better sound localization than\nthe unrestricted head movement group had.\n4 Discussion\nThis study investigated the effects of head movement and proprioceptive feedback during training in\nthe improvement of sound localization. Particularly, we examined the effects of feedback under condi-\ntions in which the participant's head movements were restricted or unrestricted during sound locali-\nzation training. Previous studies mainly examined whether visual feedback might aid in the training\nand calibration of acoustic localization processes (e.g., Hofman et al., 1998). Results of recent studies\nsuggest that proprioceptive feedback has beneficial effects on sound localization training (Blum et al.,\n2004; Parseihian & Katz, 2012). In this study, participants showed average sound localization ability\nFigure 3.

We anticipate that sound localization drills to improve the par-\nticipant's sound localization skills can be more effective with the addition of proprioceptive feedback.\nDuring the training phases, the sound localization accuracy of the participants improved signifi-\ncantly. Particularly, a significant improvement of sound localization accuracy was observed for the\nfeedback group. This result demonstrates that proprioceptive feedback can boost the effects of sound\nlocalization training. Results of previous studies suggested that proprioceptive feedback has beneficial\neffects on sound localization training (Blum et al., 2004; Parseihian & Katz, 2012). Our study showed\nthat the feedback group exhibited slightly smaller angular errors in the vertical plane than those of the\ncontrol group. Consequently, the results from this study are consistent with those reported in previous\nTest phase results demonstrated that the participants' sound localization performances were\nimproved significantly after sound localization training. Our results from the test phase revealed that\n(1) sound localization training with unrestricted head movement decreased the actual angular errors in\nthe vertical and horizontal planes, and that (2) training with the proprioceptive feedback contributed\nto improvement of the sound localization accuracy and decreased the vertical angular error. Results of\nsound localization training under head movement are in agreement with those obtained by Honda et al.\n(2007), who investigated the effects of training with a virtual auditory game on sound localization per-\nformance. An important finding among our results is that significant differences between the feedback\nand control groups were found despite equal test phases for all groups, with unrestricted head move-\nment and no feedback. Previous reports have described that head movements during sound localiza-\ntion tasks are effective to increase the localization accuracy (e.g., Populin, 2006; Thurlow & Runge,\n1967). A new result of our study shows that head movement during training is important to enhance its\nsubsequent effects on sound localization. This is particularly the case for horizontal sound localization.\nFurthermore, our results indicate that head movement and accurate proprioceptive feedback dur-\ning training might mutually contribute to different effects on sound localization learning: head move-\nment might be related to the improvement of horizontal sound localization, although proprioceptive\nfeedback might be associated with the enhancement of vertical sound localization. van Wanrooij &\nvan Opstal (2005) pointed out that human sound localization relies primarily on the processing of bin-\naural differences in sound levels and arrival times for locations in the horizontal plane, and of spectral\nshape cues generated by the head and pinnae for positions in the vertical plane. One interpretation of\nthe results is that the participants in the unrestricted head movement groups might learn how to use\nthe information of binaural difference in sound level and arrival time by actively moving their heads.\nAfterward, they can determine sound positions in the horizontal plane with greater accuracy. The posi-\ntive effect of head movement on horizontal sound localizations is consistent with the results reported\nby Thurlow & Runge (1967). Sound localization in the vertical plane is generally believed to be more\ndifficult than that in the horizontal plane. Our results suggest that proprioceptive feedback might be\nuseful in the processing of spectral information. Therefore, the use of feedback during training engen-\nders an increase in the performance of vertical sound localization afterward.\nHowever, in the results obtained in this study do not conclusively associate proprioceptive feed-\nback with the listeners' performance during vertical sound localization. For example, our findings\ndiffer from the results described by Zahorik et al. (2006), who showed no clear decrease in elevation\nlocalization error during the course of adaptation. One possible explanation for the differences in our\nresults might be the type of multimodal feedback. Zahorik et al. (2006) provided listeners with audi-\ntory, visual, and proprioceptive feedback as to the correct sound source position. In contrast, our study,\nas well as that of Parseihian & Katz (2012), mainly used proprioceptive feedback of auditory spatial\ninformation. Blum et al. (2004) reported that proprioceptive feedback can facilitate sound localization\nlearning effectively. Therefore, it is important to investigate the multimodal feedback effects on sound\nlocalization training further. For example, the feedback group of our study was informed orally that\ntheir sound localization was either correct or incorrect. Furthermore, the experimenter led their mis-\nlocated rod to the correct loudspeaker position when their localization was inaccurate. In contrast, the\ncontrol group received no feedback during training phases. To observe proprioceptive feedback effects\nmore precisely, it might be better to prepare an additional control group that is informed only whether\ntheir sound localization is correct or not.\nFurthermore, we observed an unexpected difference in sound localization performance between\nrestricted and unrestricted head movement conditions during the pre-test. This result suggests that\nthe restricted head movement condition group (mean correct rate was 56%) presented better sound\nProprioceptive feedback in training of sound localization 261\nlocalization than the unrestricted head movement condition group (44%). This observation is likely to\nbe the result of using a between-subject design; however, it is difficult to confirm that presupposition.\nFuture studies must assess those effects of head movement during training for sound localization.\nAlthough further research must be undertaken, results of our study suggest that proprioceptive\nfeedback (i.e. change of participants' body posture when the experimenter provided the feedback)\nmight have led to increased performance of vertical sound localization. Particularly, some reports have\ndescribed that the short-term deprivation of vision can improve sound localization in the horizontal\nplane. For example, Abel and Shelly Paik (2004) reported that both sighted and blindfolded listeners\nshowed improved horizontal sound localization with practice, with the blindfolded group exhibiting\nthis to a greater degree. However, few studies have examined the effects of short-term vision depriva-\ntion on vertical plane sound localization. Lewald (2002) reported that vision might be used to accu-\nrately calibrate the relation between the vertical coordinates of auditory space and the body position.\nTherefore, it is important to explore the relation between visual information and vertical plane sound\nlocalization.\nThe results of this study have some limitations. First, we did not conduct a follow-up test to\nevaluate the persistence of localization accuracy improvements resulting from the training procedure.\nTherefore, it remains unclear how long the observed effects of sound localization training persist.\nFor example, Zahorik et al. (2006) reported that the training improvements appear to last at least\nfour months. Future studies are necessary to examine the persistence effects of head movement and\nproprioceptive feedback in sound localization training. Second, we only measured sound localization\nperformance under a blindfolded condition. Lewald (2007) reported that sighted participants showed\nmore accurate sound localization after a short-term of light deprivation (90 min). Future studies call\nfor the investigation of whether the phenomena observed in this study differ between blindfolded and\nsighted conditions. Third, in our study, it remains unclear whether similar results might be obtained\nusing different types of sounds. Particularly the target sound in this study might be considered non-\nstandard because it was chosen in accordance with Honda et al. (2007), where the simulated sound of a\nbee was used in a game. Therefore, future studies must be undertaken to clarify whether more general\nsound also causes the same effects. Finally, we did not record how many times participants were asked\nto localize another appropriate loudspeaker position when the participant pointed to a position between\nthe loudspeakers. This parameter might be important for additional understanding of the effects of\nhead movement and proprioceptive feedback in the training for sound localization.\nDespite these points of uncertainty, our results show that proprioceptive feedback has beneficial\neffects on training for sound localization irrespective of whether the listener's head movements are\nrestricted or not. Furthermore, our findings suggest that unrestricted head movement and propriocep-\ntive feedback during the sound localization training can engender enhanced perceptual motor learning\nand can enable better use by listeners of proprioceptive information and of varied auditory cues from\nhead movement.\n"
