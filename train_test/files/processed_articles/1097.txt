A fully structured questionnaire, administered by trained lay inter-\nviewers, screened for the life-time prevalence of problem and Pathological Gam-\nbling. Per DSM-IV definitions, anyone meeting five or more of 10 itemized\ncriteria was considered a pathological gambler. We analyzed these criteria\namong all gamblers who met one or more criteria (n = 399).\nFindings Most gamblers who met only one or two criteria reported `chasing\ntheir losses'. At subclinical levels (three to four criteria), gamblers also reported\nelevated rates of gambling-related fantasy: lying, gambling to escape and pre-\noccupation. Pathological gamblers with five to seven criteria reported marked\nelevations of loss of control, withdrawal symptoms and tolerance (internalizing\ndimensions of dependence); risking their social relationships and needing to be\nbailed out financially (externalizing dimensions). Most of the highest-level\npathological gamblers (eight to 10 criteria) reported committing illegal acts to\nsupport gambling.\nConclusion Dependence in a biobehavioral sense appears to be a hallmark of\nPathological Gambling, but it marks only one threshold in a qualitative hierar-\nchy of disorders beginning with a common subclinical behavior, `chasing'. Epi-\ndemiological assessments and future DSM revisions might consider explicit\nrecognition of a problem gambling disorder, identifying people presenting\nsome cognitive symptoms of Pathological Gambling but not clear signs of\ndependence. Pathological gamblers in turn appear to have two distinct levels of\nseverity.\n",

The current\nDSM requires that an individual meet five or more of 10\ndefining criteria for a diagnosis of `Pathological Gam-\nbling'. According to the manual's text, the essential\nfeature of this disorder is `persistent and recurrent\nmaladaptive gambling behavior...that disrupts personal,\nAlthough there is general debate concerning the diag-\nnostic approach taken by the DSM (Clark, Watson & Rey-\nwidespread acceptance of the DSM-IV gambling defini-\ntions and criteria by researchers and clinicians in many\ncountries where legalized gambling exists [e.g. England\n(Volberg et al. 2001), New Zealand (Abbott & Volberg\n2000) and the United States (National Research Council\ndebate continues as to whether gambling disorders com-\nprise a single, sharply distinguished pathological entity or\nlie on a continuum, with no symptoms and florid Patho-\nlogical Gambling as its respective endpoints (Blaszczynski\n2002). Some researchers have suggested that these dif-\nfering measurement models may serve different purposes\nand are conceptually compatible with each other (Clark,\nsuggests a third possibility, which is that gambling prob-\nlems comprise a hierarchy of logically related but quali-\ntatively different disorders--an extension within a single\ndiagnostic entity of an idea currently applied by some\nauthors to broader classes of disorders (Watson 1999;\nInvestigations of gambling behavior and symptoms\nmay shed useful light on these three positions. This paper\ndescribes the results of one such investigation: an analysis\nof how the individual criteria designated by DSM-IV dis-\ntribute across two randomly drawn samples of adults in\nthe United States, from individuals reporting a single cri-\nterion to those presenting the full suite of 10. We exam-\nined these distributions using a simple taxonomy of\ngamblers, exploring the association of individual criteria\nrelative to their distribution.\nMETHODS\nParticipants\nThis analysis used data from selected participants in two\nUS Gambling Impact and Behavior Study (GIBS) (Ger-\nstein et al. 1999). These surveys were, respectively, a tele-\nphone survey of household residents and an in-person\nsurvey of gambling facility patrons (restricted to US resi-\ndents). The telephone survey was based on a national\nrandom sample of US residential telephone numbers.This\nsurvey was designed to represent proportionately all\nadult household residents at every level of gambling\nbehavior (including non-gamblers). Structured 30-\nminute interviews were completed with a total of 2417\nadults, including 44 interviews using a Spanish transla-\ntion of the questionnaire. Households were called and\nscreened initially to roster the current residents 18 years\nand older and then randomly select one adult per house-\nhold.The screening completion rate was 75.3% of house-\nholds, and the interview rate among eligible respondents\nThe patron survey was designed specifically to capture\nlarge numbers of frequent and particularly problem and\npathological gamblers efficiently, relative to their preva-\nlence in the household population. It sampled gamblers\nrandomly but proportionally to their frequency of enter-\ning commercial gambling venues, and thus did not sam-\nple current non-gamblers (who comprised less than 1%\nof thefacilitypatronsversus32%of householdresidents).\nTwenty-minute interviews (a subset of questions from\nthe telephone survey instrument) were completed by 530\nadults from a stratified sample of 21 gaming facilities in\neight states, including resort-style casinos in Nevada and\nNew Jersey; `riverboat' casinos in the Midwest and South;\ntribal casinos in the North and West; racetracks in East-\nern, Midwestern and Western states; and lottery ticket\noutlets in the West and Midwest, stratified by neighbor-\nhood income level.The distribution of the total interviews\nwas proportional to the annual gaming receipts of these\nfacility types, which comprised the most frequently vis-\nited gambling venues, according to the telephone survey\nresults and other sources (e.g. Christensen Cummings\nInterview teams at each facility followed rigorous\nsampling rules to select and recruit (`intercept') respon-\ndents at random entries/exits or main internal traffic cor-\nridors during staggered daytime and evening shifts. The\ninterview completion rate across all venues was 50.0%, a\nrate comparable to random telephone surveys and much\nhigher than usually achieved in intercept surveys. All the\nfield procedures and related methodological details of the\nsurveys were reviewed extensively by independent\nresearch experts and reported in detail in the GIBS report\n(Gerstein et al. 1999).
