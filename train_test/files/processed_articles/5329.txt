Despite the emergence\nof a diverse corpus of heterodox economics (Colander, 2000), this highly simplified\nmicroeconomic conception remains central to demand theory (Stiglitz and Walsh,\n2006). Taste is acknowledged as being foundational for consumer behaviour but is\nrelegated to the field of culture, which is considered to be an exogenous variable\nactors, are conceived as having predetermined similar tastes. This assumption of\npredetermined and similar taste is a crucial assumption to comprehend mass sales\nof products.\nTaste, being a driver of consumption, is often used interchangeably with pref-\nconceptual distinctions, this array of concepts raises the question of whether they\nall are culturally determined. Arguably, preferences, wants and needs are not neces-\nsarily the same thing, nor are they solely biologically determined. Food, for exam-\nple, is considered to be a basic biological need. However, what is eaten, when and\nhow it occurs, at what time and with whom are culturally shaped and a matter of\ntaste (Warde, 1997). Consequently, the way a need is fulfilled (e.g. food) varies\nacross cultures. In addition, taste is conceptually different from preference, since\nthe latter expresses an individual ranking of commodities, while taste is a cultural\n(collective) force that requires no comparison.\nThe issue of taste becomes more troubling when we leave the national realm and\nconsider diaspora markets that consist of culturally related ethnic communities.\nHowever, several authors point out that diaspora communities become hybrid\ncommunities for several reasons \u00ad for example, they may adapt to new circum-\nThis implies that diaspora communities may differ significantly from each other.\nDespite these differences, a common ethnic taste is foundational for the diaspora\nmarket but cannot be taken for granted because of hybridity. Many authors sug-\ngest that tastes internationally converge through global acculturation (Aizenman\noften these studies report little more than actual purchases and preferences,\nwhich are taken as a reflection of international taste convergence. Although this\nZukin and Maguire, 2004), none of the mentioned studies address how taste simi-\nlarity in diaspora markets is engendered. The pressing question therefore is how to\naccount for the similarity in ethnic taste in diaspora markets.\nThis article centres on taste as a crucial driver of consumer behaviour and\naddresses the issue of how ethnic tastes in hybridized diaspora communities are\nmaintained. The most common answer to this question refers to glocalization,\nwhich is briefly described as the adoption (modification) of global elements in\nthe local culture. The article argues that the glocalization of taste occurs through\nconsumer practices, but the concept of practices has been found difficult to apply,\n2 Journal of Consumer Culture 0(0)\nas there is no unified definition of it. Accordingly, each time the question of `taste\nfor what?' may be asked. Taste for dresses is something quite different, for example,\nthan the taste for food \u00ad and so are the related practices. The concept of taste is\ntherefore specific, as are the operationalized consumer practices. Put differently,\ntaste appears to be a fuzzy concept that must be specified in each case in order to\ndisclose its concrete meaning (Haack, 1996). Consequently, the article specifies that\ntaste is shaped, maintained and expressed in and through consumer practices that\nneed to display cultural scripts and institutional regularities in the lived culture of\nthe ethnic community. Furthermore, the ethnic lived culture is differentiated from\nthe concepts of `everyday ethnicity', `cultural norm images' and `invention of trad-\nition', detailing the home culture, the community culture and the celebration of\ntraditions, respectively, to highlight how script-driven institutional practices sus-\ntain diaspora-related taste. Acknowledging that the specific mode of glocalization\nvaries across diaspora communities, this article elucidates the argument with a case\nstudy by Dutch Hindustanis. The article claims that despite being a case study, the\nmaintenance of taste applies to all communities that constitute the Indian diaspora\nmarket.\nThe theoretical relevance of this article includes an extension of the concept of\ntaste from the national realm to hybrid diaspora markets, an issue that is rarely\naddressed. The application and specification of the concept of consumer practices\nelucidate how ethnic taste in diaspora communities is maintained. Furthermore,\nthe article argues that although community activities are specific, it is insufficiently\nunderscored that ethnic consumer practices need to be institutional and specific to\ncultural scripts. In connecting the concept of taste with consumer practices, the\narticle not only contributes to the concept of practices but also elucidates how\nglocalization occurs, thus, producing similarity of ethnic taste.\nIn the next section, I discuss the concepts of taste and practice in the lived\nculture to account for glocalization. The cultural homophily rendered is critical\nfor the operation of the diaspora markets, as it shapes similarities in cultural prac-\ntices that sustain and express taste. Section Research population and data collec-\ntion outlines the researched community, the research strategy and the collection of\ndata. Section Practices of taste describes the adoption and usage of the Indian\nculture in the Netherlands, specifically the home culture, the community (public)\nculture and the celebration of tradition, thus, elucidating how cultural scripts\nmaterialize in institutional practices that shape, maintain and express taste. The\nlast section underscores that diaspora markets are bonded by ethnic taste and\nsuggests some wider theoretical implications.\nPractice and taste maintenance\nIn most literature, the concept of taste remains implicit or poorly defined. The\neconomic literature does not distinguish between taste and preference (Aizenman\ntive is that of rankings, which are disclosed by actual shopping behaviour and\nGowricharn 3\ncalled revealed preferences. One exception is Becker, who argues that taste or\npreference depends on personal capital (including personal experiences that affect\ncurrent and future utilities) and social capital (past action by peers). This is a\ndubious representation of the cultural determination of taste, as it remains\nrestricted to individuals and leaves out collective activities (see also Sassatelli,\nwho, after reviewing the economic literature on cultural transmission, collect\nmostly microeconomic variables to account for cultural heterogeneity. From\ntheir perspective too, the individual predominates, while the study fails to account\nfor the cultural nature of taste.\nIn sociology, the issue of taste is similarly treated. Bourdieu (1984), one of the\nvery few to define taste, refers to it as follows:\n. . . the propensity and capacity to appropriate (materially or symbolically) a given\nclass of classified, classifying objects or practices, is the generative formula of life\nstyle, a unitary set of distinctive preferences which express the same expressive inten-\ntion in the specific logic of each of the symbolic sub-spaces, furniture, clothing, lan-\nIn his view, taste is the product of class and power relations, an ingredient of the\ncultural capital of the middle class and a way to maintain distinctions and class\nhegemony. Taste in the Bordieuan sense has less to do with market behaviour. In\nanother work, Bourdieu (2005) argues that markets are constructed by the\nstate along with the symbolic meaning attached by the consumer, whose taste is\nprimarily a class feature rather than foundational of market behaviour.\nAlthough many sociological accounts acknowledge that the operation of mar-\nkets depends on cultural forces, they do not deal explicitly with the consumer\nperspective is offered in the sociology of consumption, specifically the strong ten-\nsumption is guided by exchange values, use values and identity values. As a con-\nsequence, purchasing commodities is not the same as using them, since exchange,\nuse and identity formation or maintenance are separate activities (Warde, 2015).\nAs taste is expressed by use values that serve to express identity, these elements are\nclosely related.\nArguably, the bulk of these studies presume that taste varies across classes and\nsubcultures, while basically sharing the same taste. When applied to multicultural\nsocieties, this basic uniformity runs counter to limitations, as the tastes of disparate\nethnic (minority) groups are different. This is a serious limitation, since it glosses\nover the possibility that taste may be specific across ethnic groups in multicultural\nsocieties. One notable exception is Warde (1997), who refers to a cultural variation,\nincluding ethnic groups, but does not elaborate on it. The sheer presence of an\nethnic specific taste warrants the concept of `ethnic taste'. Viewed from the\n4 Journal of Consumer Culture 0(0)\nperspective of ethnic taste, some commodities are just intended to satisfy instru-\nmental needs, like cars or household appliances, although they may contain elem-\nents of taste when it comes to brand and design (Warde, 2015; Zukin and Maguire,\nmusic, beauty and physical appearance, are expressions of collective (ethnic)\ntaste, even though they may display variations according to education, class pos-\nition, acculturation and individual appreciation.\nEthnic taste implies purchasing and using commodities and services that sustain\nthe ethnic identity. For this reason, the consumer behaviour needs to be part of the\nlived culture. The concept of lived culture is described by Schutz and Luckmann\n(1974) as `. . . that province of reality which the wide-awake and normal adult\nsimply takes for granted in the attitude of common sense' (pp. 3\u00ad4). It is a natural\nworld that is obvious to its participants until further notice; it is shared and\nintersubjective. Gowricharn (2012) juxtaposes this concept of the lived world\nwith the Habermassian idea of the `system world'. The latter is formal, abstract\nand public and comprises a large number of systems and institutions that broadly\nstructure public life. In contrast, lived culture is concrete and private. It consists of\ndaily routinized habits, including those of an ethnic, creolized and assimilated\nnature.\nThe lived culture consists of disparate activities that are denoted with `practices'.\nThe concept of practices has several applications and meanings. Useful reviews of\nthe concept are provided by Feldman and Orlikowski (2011), Rasche and Chia\nactions that are consequential for the reproduction of social life, the rejection of\ndualism as a way of theorizing and relations that are mutually constitutive.\nReckwitz (2002) argues that practice theory aims to fill the gap between structure\nand agency and transcends a number of dualities in the social sciences, such as\nthose between mind and body or action and reflection. He describes practice theory\nas a theory that `invites us to regard agents as carriers of routinized, oversubjective\ncomplexes of bodily movements, of forms of interpreting, knowing how and want-\nedly probes the concept of practice. Acknowledging that consumption is subject to\nambivalence, consisting of purchasing and of using up, Warde (2005) explains that\nconsumption is not in itself a practice but a moment in almost every practice. This\nmakes the individual an intersection of many practices. Warde (2005) summarizes\n`practice as consumption' as comprising interconnected forms of bodily and mental\nactivities, `things' and their use, understanding, know how, states of emotion and\nmotivational knowledge. Practice concerns doing things, as well as its representa-\ntion. From this perspective, taste is shaped, maintained and expressed in and\nthrough consumption practices.\nThe consumption practices need to be part of the ethnic lived world to meet the\nrequirement of routine behaviour. This combined regularity and cultural specificity\nGowricharn 5\nof the practices imply cultural scripts. Scripts presume that social behaviour is\nscripted. Often the script behaviour is unconscious and restricted to an event.\nThe literature distinguishes between cognitive scripts, social scripts, cultural scripts\nand shopping scripts. Erasmus et al. (2002) advocate the application of the script\nconcept in consumer research because `it could shed light on consumers' expect-\nations, proactive planning as well as situational decision making processes and\nbehaviour'. They refer to scripts in general terms as `a sequence of goal directed\nactions that are causally and temporally ordered and includes the relevant people,\nobjects and locations'. However, their discussion of the operation of scripts is\nembedded in an individual learning perspective. Although the script literature\noffers the concept of cultural scripts to articulate specific cultural norms, values\net al., 2015), the focus is on behaviour and neglects the use of objects and their\nidentity function.\nThe relevant consumer practices can be found both at the micro- and at the\nmeso-level. Religion and music are cases in point. They are typical activities con-\nducted in households and enabled by institutions in the community. For example,\nprofessing a religion or listening to music may refer to practices conducted at\nhome, but they presuppose churches, temples and mosques or radio stations broad-\ncasting music. Another example specific to ethnic minorities consists of the prep-\naration of ethnic food, which is conditional on shops selling the required ethnic\ngoods (Mankekar, 2002). Households, temples, radio stations and `ethnic shops'\nare (ethnic) institutions. Typical of institutions, they enforce, internalize, routinize\nand transmit, becoming sediment of the cultural history of the community (Berger\nand Luckmann, 1966). These ethnic institutions, such as cinemas and festivals, are\nlocated outside households. The relevant practices that elucidate taste are, thus,\nlocated both inside and outside households and are critical for opportunities pro-\nvided by institutions. This extra-individual dimension implies that the concept of\npractice should be extended to the participation in communal institutions of the\nInstitutions do not disclose the ethnic specificity of the behaviour. For that, `cultural\nscripts' provide a useful specification (Barley and Tolbert 1997). Scripted behaviour is\nculturally specific and needs to be institutionalized to capture the ethnic nature of the\npractice. By linking the concept of institutions with cultural scripts, it is possible to\ncapture concrete activities in the ethnic lived culture as consumer practices sustaining\ntaste. Put differently: The consumer practices underscoring taste maintenance are\ninstitutionally embedded and subject to cultural scripts.\nNote that taste, along with the subsequent cultural scripts and institutionalized\npractices, also changes, mostly due to demographic changes, increased welfare\nlevels and acculturation. Consequently, a change in ethnic taste can occur as a\nresult of an increase in ethnic salience, creolizing or assimilation and may produce\nthree outcomes: the salience, blurring or maintenance of ethnic features (Cornell\nand Hartmann, 2007). All three outcomes may occur simultaneously in one ethnic\ncommunity. Since my focus is on the maintenance of tastes, which presupposes the\n6 Journal of Consumer Culture 0(0)\nethnification of diaspora communities, it rules out diverging tendencies of creol-\nization and assimilation.\nThe concept of diaspora requires some specification, especially regarding the\nIndian experience. Indian communities consist of migrants originating from differ-\nent regions, characterized by many languages, religions and local traditions.\nMoreover, they have migrated to different destinations in several epochs.\nDepending on their resources and the response of the host society, their mode of\nintegration has also differed, specifically due to unequal degrees of ethnification,\ncreolization and assimilation. Present-day diaspora communities comprise several\nParekh et al., 2003). This hybridity of the Indian diaspora communities highlights\nthat taste and related practices have been evolving through time. Nevertheless, they\nhave performed as markets for Indian products. One example is Bollywood, which\nrepresents a `fictive culture', eagerly consumed by diaspora communities, as well as\nby non-Indian communities such as those in the Middle East, black Africa and\nEastern Europe. Within the Indian diaspora communities, Bollywood has an\nRao, 2010). Their market function is only comprehensible if these communities\nshare similarity in taste.\nThe similarity is engendered by glocalization, which connects the global and the\nlocal, referring to the absorption of global cultural elements by local cultures. Often\nreferred to examples of glocalization include the worldwide ubiquity of\nMacDonalds and Coca-Cola. Robertson (2012), outlining the micro-marketing\norigins of the concept, argues that there is no contradiction between the global\nand the local; rather, globalization has been involved in the creation of `home',\n`locality' and `community'. In his view, the global should not be juxtaposed against\nthe local, since the former presupposes the linking of many localities: without the\nlocal there would be no global, and the global always has local origins. In this\ncontext, a crucial difference should be pointed out between the globalization ema-\nnating from the United States and Europe and that originating from the Indian\nsubcontinent. While the former is based on the Western economic, political and\nmilitary supremacy, the latter is restricted to its diaspora communities and based\non cultural and historical affinity. Consequently, the globalization of Indian culture\ncomprises highly specific items, including Bollywood, religion, diaspora tourism\nand the search for roots.\nAs with acculturation, elements from the globalizing culture are selectively\nadopted and adjusted to local practices and uses. This is not a new phenomenon;\nmany scholars point out this selective incorporation. Examples include Douglas\n(1982), who advocates the selectivity of adopted elements in acculturation, and\nHall (1980), who accentuates the encoding and decoding performed by the actors\ninvolved. Adopting Indian commodities signals, for example, home possessions,\ncultural identity, a feeling of home and relations with co-ethnics (Gowricharn,\npresupposes some entanglement of the global culture in the local community\nGowricharn 7\n(Kraidy, 2002). However, the role of the actors in the maintenance of taste in\nhomes and communities, as well as how localities are shaped and how they are\nconnected with the diaspora, is rarely addressed. The concept of institutional prac-\ntices as embedded in ethnic scripts elucidates this process.\nWarde (1997) argues that consumption `can no longer be encapsulated in the\nquestion ``who buys what?'' but must become one of ``who obtains what services\n(and goods), under what conditions are those goods delivered and to what use they\nare put?''' (p. 19). Indian ethnic communities obtain their commodities and services\nthrough three major channels: via the normal global market, including internet\nshopping; via diaspora tourism and gifts; and from downloading commodities\nfrom the Internet. In the first case, entrepreneurs are involved in the importing\nand exporting of commodities or offer their services in the local diaspora market\n(Mankekar, 2002). In the second case, members of diaspora communities visit\nIndia, often for several reasons, including purchasing commodities for personal\nuse and for giving (Gowricharn, 2017). The third channel consists of the (often\nunpaid) acquisition of Indian goods through the Internet, especially downloading\n(Bollywood) movies, songs and gadgets (Elahi, 2014).\nThe sustenance of a common taste is manifested in behaviour that fits the\ncultural scripts of the ethnic community and is institutionalized in practices in\nthe lived culture. Since the concept of lived culture is too broad to focus on, it is\nconveniently broken down into the home culture, the community culture and the\ncelebration of traditions. The home culture is a proxy for daily routines in everyday\nlife as far as these comprise daily family life; the community culture refers to the life\nin the ethnic community, especially the participation in ethnic institutional activ-\nities; and the celebration of traditions, some of which are invented, are recurring\nrare events. Each category of practices is sustained by its specific institutions, which\ncannot be taken for granted, since ethnification is not an inexorable outcome. All\nthe practices in the lived culture have been inherited and affected by ethnification\nand assimilation (Hennion, 2007). Section `Practices of taste' outlines the practices\nin the lived culture of the diaspora community, which have been foundational for\nthe demand exerted by consumers of Indian products.\nResearch population and data collection\nThe research population consists of Dutch Hindustanis, descendants of indentured\ntation colony, to replace freed black slaves. Most of these immigrants originated\nfrom the north-eastern part of India. During the run-up to constitutional inde-\npendence in 1975, they migrated on a large scale to the Netherlands, mainly in fear\nof race riots. In the Netherlands, they regrouped themselves ethnically with major\nsettlements in The Hague, Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Utrecht. At present, the\nreputation for being a successful integrated ethnic minority, especially the second\ngeneration. An increasing part is assimilating, as expressed in mixed marriage and\n8 Journal of Consumer Culture 0(0)\nthe rise of Western lifestyles; another category combines Surinamese and Dutch\nHindustani culture with Indian culture; while the third category concentrates on\nthe Indian heritage (Choenni, 2014). Consequently, the idea of a homeland in the\ndiaspora is ambiguous: for most Hindustanis, Suriname, the Netherlands and India\nperform the function of a homeland (cf. Brubaker, 2005).\nIn the Netherlands, three important preconditions emerged that account for the\ncloser relation between the Dutch Hindustanis and India. The first is the rise of the\nInternet. This enables instant, detailed and almost complete overviews of the com-\nmodities offered by the Indian market. The second is the consumption of\nBollywood movies and related products, such as dresses and music. This gave\nrise to a section of cultural entrepreneurs in the major Dutch cities selling Indian\ncommodities. The third is the increasing diaspora tourism to India. In the 1990s,\nthis tourism consisted predominantly of a search for family roots; later, religious\nmotives gained relevance along with the desire to visit movie locations\nIt should be pointed out that although Dutch Hindustanis are part of the\nIndian diaspora, they represent a specific segment within the Caribbean People\nof Indian Origin (PIOs), one that does not share the British colonial history\nand lacks the obvious command of Hindi or English. Consequently, this popula-\ntion is at a large distance from India compared with the English-speaking\nPIO's and the non-resident Indians (NRIs) in Anglo-Western societies.\nGowricharn (2009) argues that despite the larger distance, India has become a\n`source culture' from which Dutch Hindustanis obtain culture through tourism\nand the Internet, notably downloading movies and music, practising dancing\nstyles and engaging in online shopping. Similar activities are reported in later\nThe data for this research were obtained from participation in the community\nfor over three decades. As a member of the community and a university profes-\nsor, and having lived for over 40 years in the Netherlands, I have often been\ninvited to cultural happenings, including cultural shows, feasts, ceremonies and\ncelebrations, and to participate in Hindustani television and radio programmes\nto deliver public lecturers about the Hindustani community and Dutch ethnic\nminorities. This participation has included visiting families, friends and other\npeople who appreciated my visit because of my social status, watching\nBollywood movies in people's homes and in cinemas, watching changing house\ndecoration, visiting India, discussing diaspora tourism with community members\n(including tour operators), listening to Hindustani radio and watching\nHindustani television, attending community celebrations like Milan (the equivalent\nis called Kumb Mela in Britain), Diwali and Holi and attending religious ceremo-\nnies. In the course of my participation, I saw the community growing demograph-\nically, changing culturally and shifting in orientation from Suriname to India.\nThese activities were participatory, but they were also engaging and part of the\ndebate within the Hindustani community about values such as liberty, respect and\nethnic identity.\nGowricharn 9\nRiemer (1977) calls this type of `fieldwork' opportunistic research. He pleads for\nresearchers to use this knowledge at hand and to use familiar situations or events to\ntheir advantage. Social scientists are insiders in many communities and have\naccess to an enormous stock of first-hand knowledge that is often neglected.\nOpportunistic research comes closest to participant observation and data collection\nin focus groups. However, the type of research and data collection exceeds the\nnormal routine of participant observation. Opportunistic research usually covers\na long time span and enables changes to be discerned in the community. Moreover,\nit offers the opportunity to cross-check data numerous times and to discuss the\nfindings with key informants and participants. While the absence of recorded data\ncompels one to rely on memory (and may trick the observer), the participation over\na long period and discussion about the observations with community members\noffer repeated opportunities to `cross-check' data and preclude or minimize distor-\ntion in their representation.\nOpportunistic research also resembles self-ethnography, in which the researcher\nis an active and equal participant (Alvesson, 2003). The researcher lives in the\nnatural setting and uses the experiences, knowledge and access to empirical mater-\nial for research purposes. The intention is to draw attention to what takes place\naround oneself rather than putting oneself and one's experiences at the centre.\nSelf-ethnography is different from auto-ethnography, in which authors relate\ntheir personal experience to the culture. Both types of research suggest that data\nare collected for research purposes, while opportunistic research is an ex post\n`strategy'. Because of its highly informal and casual nature, opportunistic research\ndiscloses a reality that is less unveiled by a formal research design (Priore, 2006).\nConsequently, opportunistic research, albeit a rare and ex post strategy to obtain\nand structure data, is a highly reliable method of data collection. The repeated\nobservation and discussion for over three decades are considered a key advantage\nof the employed methodology.\nThe focus on Dutch Hindustanis does not mean that the whole community is\ninvolved in the consumption of Indian commodities. The community displays an\ninternal variation that ranges from families and individuals who are oriented\ntowards India to those who are seemingly totally assimilated. The latter category\nis not part of the diaspora market. The part consuming Indian commodities is not\nrestricted to PIOs in the Netherlands. Hindustani PIOs in Suriname, Guyana and\nTrinidad, Mauritius and Fiji are all involved in the Indian diaspora in the same\nmanner as Dutch Hindustanis (Jayaram, 2011; Kaur and Sinha, 2005; Parekh et al.,\n2003). While the communities are spatially segmented and hybrid, their taste is\nsimilar enough to constitute a diaspora market.\nPractices of taste\nThe argument so far states that taste in the (Indian) diaspora is sustained by\ninstitutionalized consumer practices that are subject to cultural scripts and part\nof the lived culture of the diaspora community. Recall Warde's (2015) conception\nthat consumer practices comprise interconnected forms of bodily and mental activ-\nities, `things' and their use, understanding, know how, states of emotion, motiv-\national knowledge and doing things, as well as their representation. In this section,\nthese practices are highlighted in three domains, namely the home culture, the\ncommunity culture and the celebration of traditions, all of which are enabled by\ncommunal institutions.\nHome culture\nThe home culture comprises the routines at home and the activities within the\nfamily and close circles. The part of the home culture that is connected with the\ntaste of the Indian diaspora represents a kind of `everyday ethnicity'. Colombo\n(2015) refers to a similar but broader concept as `everyday multiculturalism' that\nhighlights how differences are produced. Similar to everyday multiculturalism com-\nprising ethnic institutions, networks, traditions, behavioural norms, moral values,\ncustoms and so on, the home culture is embedded in a wider ethnic environment.\nThe home culture specifically includes how members of the ethnic community\nconsciously and unconsciously spend their time in the reproduction of their\nethnic life at home. This culture of Dutch Hindustanis is inherited from the past,\nadjusted in and through migration, absorbs culture from the host society and\nethnifies due to new cultural flows from India. The home culture comprises the\n`natural taste', since it is taken for granted and considered pivotal for the ethnic\nidentity. Since the concept is still very broad, as it includes the total material and\nimmaterial culture of Hindustani households, I select some aspects of food, home\nrecreation and home possessions to highlight practices in the ethnic home culture.\nThe food of the Dutch Hindustanis is recognizably Indian, with typical elements\nsuch as dal, roti, the standard use of curry, pepper, the rejection of beef and several\nvegetables familiar to Indians. Dutch youngsters consider these foodstuffs to be\ncharacteristic of their identity (Gowricharn, 2009). As about 60% of the population\nprofess Hinduism (Choenni, 2014) at most religious feasts, such as weddings,\nmasses (katha and hawan) and Diwali (the light feast), standard meals consist of\nvegetarian Indian food. Since males rarely prepare food and hardly assist women in\nthese activities, women often lament, `It is so much work. I cannot prepare all the\ndishes while having a fulltime job'. One generation ago, these women could count\non the support of relatives and friends, but the increase of female labour partici-\npation and individualization has diminished this support. Consequently, a new\npractice in the food scene is to order Indian dishes from take-away restaurants.\nThis is not to say that no other dishes are served. A recent trend on heydays,\nespecially when many people are invited, is to serve less labour-intensive meals,\nsuch as nasi and bami, originally dishes from the Javanese in Suriname. This\nhappens mostly at non-religious celebrations, but increasingly these dishes are\nserved at weddings.\nOther aspects that are typical of the home culture are Indian (Bollywood) music\nand the enjoyment of Indian movies. In the Netherlands, the daily `Indian'\nentertainment of the Hindustani community is taken care of by radio. Local radio\nstations, which are concentrated in the major Dutch cities and agglomerations,\nbroadcast in Hindi (often alternated with Dutch and a Surinamese variant of\nBhojpuri, called Sarnami Hindustani) and play Indian music around the clock\ndaily. First-generation Hindustanis (male and female), referring to movies where\na song was played, often say when hearing the song again that `This song was acted\nin film Kangan by Mala Sinha. She was so beautiful then'. Nationwide stations are\nRadio Amor, Radio Ujala and the online Sunrise Radio, which are subject to\ncompetition from YouTube. Women are generally more comfortable listening to\nthe radio while working.\nWith the advent of the cable and television channel Zee TV, Indian television\nhas gained increased traction with Dutch Hindustani families. In some cities, such\nas The Hague, this `Indian facility' is offered by several Dutch companies. Indian\nTV broadcasts Bollywood movies, talk shows, singing contests and documentaries\non movie stars. In a similar manner to the radio, it is common to have the TV on at\nhome while working. Listening to the radio is often an individual act, while families\ntend to view Bollywood movies or talk shows. In addition to television, a major\nDutch cinema chain, Pathe\n\u00b4 , regularly offers Bollywood movies to the public.\nVisiting Pathe\n\u00b4 has become a highly popular activity for young and old people\nalike. It has become part of the going out scene. Thanks to the combination of\nmusic, television and cinema, the Hindustani ethnic culture is highly condensed in\nmany homes.\nHome decorations of Indian origin are a key element in the houses of many\nHindustanis. The volume and the composition of such decorations vary depending\non the degree of identification with Indian culture. They also signify what the\noccupiers consider to be a pleasant home or indicate how `Indian' they are.\nHome decorations are obtained on visits to India or received as presents from\nfamily members or friends (Gowricharn, 2017). They usually include small religious\nstatues and pictures, musical instruments, photographs of visits to India, souvenirs,\nmusic CDs, DVDs, incense and tapestries. Many Hindustanis take pride in these\nartefacts from India, but they gradually become familiar to visitors: `I recognise\nthis, you have bought this in Mumbai. It is nice'. These Indian artefacts are increas-\ningly used to shape one's identity in a modified, lived culture, similar to how Indian\nemigrants to the United States may take possessions home possessions with them\nto recreate a culturally familiar environment (Mehta and Belk, 1991). Together\nwith practices around food, music and movies, they reflect a shared taste in dias-\npora communities.\nCommunity culture\nThe community culture is the culture outside the home. It represents people's\nactivities when they present themselves to their co-ethnics in community happen-\nings. Some activities outside the home are recurrent, notably weekend pastimes,\nfamily celebrations such as weddings and dance parties, and community festivals\nsuch as the organization of beauty contests and annual religious festivals (Choenni,\n2014). A less frequent occurrence comprises events such as public appearances from\nvisiting Bollywood movie stars, which are part of community life. On all these\noccasions, Hindustanis often dress up, sometimes wearing Indian dresses, and\nuse Indian cosmetics and many other symbols displaying Indian culture. On\nthese occasions, people want to look good, respectable and representative. When\nHindustanis go out, Indian aesthetics predominates.\nTo capture the aspects of Indian aesthetics, I employ the concept of norm\nimages. These are ideal conceptions of man that are present in every culture. The\nconcept of norm images originates in a study on the choice of marriage partners\nrelying on bodily features, notably skin colour. Hoetink (1967), the progenitor of\nthe concept, terms these ideal images `somatic norm images' and emphasizes that\nthey reflect both aesthetics and socio-economic position. In much later work, and\nbuilding on Hoetink, Gowricharn (1992, 2002) extends the concept of the cultural\nnorm image to capture aspects of somatics, aesthetics, morals and community\nculture. Somatic, cultural, moral and aesthetic norm images are intertwined but\nchange over time, although some elements may remain recognizable over a long\nperiod. Indian aesthetic norm images in the lived culture of the Hindustani com-\nmunity are easily identified in beauty, dresses and fashion.\nThe major tastemaker, when it comes to Indian beauty, is Bollywood. This\nindustry conveys the Indian aesthetics, for example, the desired somatic features\nof a beautiful woman or handsome man. Regarding skin colour, the phenotypes\ndisplay small variations: women are supposed to be light-skinned, while males are\nsometimes allowed to be somewhat darker. A few generations ago, the body shape\nof most actresses could easily have been described as chubby; today they are more\nin line with Western images of beauty. Bodily features are underscored by fashion.\nFor women, this is a matter of daily routine, especially concerning body care and\nthe use of cosmetics, including the daily use of kadjer to underline the eyes, oil and\nother cosmetics, based on Ayurveda principles. Indian costumes, such as the sari\nfor women and sherwani for men, are only worn on special occasions. If these\ndresses are liked, it is quite common to ask, `Where did you buy it?' In many cases,\nthe explanations include a story about visiting Mumbai or Delhi (Gowricharn,\n2017). The aesthetic norm images underlying the consumption of these commod-\nities are advertised by the community radio, television and new social media, while\nlocal firms offer them in the major Dutch cities.\nIn addition to these items, aesthetics is characterized by sound, specifically\nmusic and songs, as well as the associated dancing. Songs and music are easily\nincorporated into the community, since ethnic radio and TV stations broadcast\nthem regularly. At celebrations, it is customary to have a musical band playing.\nA large proportion of this music is Bollywood. The qualification of `beautiful'\nsongs or music depends, to some extent, on the lyrics and is sometimes\nlimited to the memory and language of a generation. The frequent playing of\n`beautiful old songs' socializes the younger generation in the Hindustani repertoire\nof songs.\nThe invention of traditions\nTraditions are a regular recurrent activity that is inherited. A variation of the\ndescription is the idea of `the invention of tradition' (Hobsbawm and Ranger,\n1983), which was developed in the context of nationalism and refers to the reacti-\nvation or invention of practices to mobilize people politically. Concepts such as the\ninvention of ethnicity (Conzen et al., 1992) and symbolic boundaries (Lamont and\nFournier, 1992) similarly refer to this fabrication of `cultural substance'. The\n`invention' of tradition, ethnicity and symbolic boundaries shapes the group iden-\ntity. Because of the preponderance of India in the diaspora, traditions are copied\nfrom it rather than invented. What, for reasons of convenience, is labelled\n`invention' here is an adjustment or incorporation of `new traditions' into the\ncommunity. It is a process of ethnification, although the meanings ascribed to\nthe adopted elements may vary with the people involved (Burke, 2009).\nDutch Hindustanis have been subjected to processes of ethnification. As in\nSuriname, they have always been aware that they are part of an ancient civilization\nthat is now worldwide (Choenni, 2014). They took pride in the increasing inter-\nnational recognition of India as a regional superpower after the 1980s. Especially\nIndia's economic development, its political and military power and the increasing\npopularity of Bollywood in the West are hugely gratifying for Dutch Hindustanis.\nIn this alignment, Indian cultural items are modified, reactivated and in many cases\n`imitated'. Older traditions have been retained and adjusted to the new environ-\nments. There are a few examples that illustrate this process of cultural `invention'.\nPractices include the increasing use of the tika, a red mark on the forehead of\nwomen, and the sindhoor, a red line along the middle of the head that symbolizes\nwomen's married status. It has been widely observed that these symbols are\nincreasingly being used by the younger generation of Dutch Hindustani women.\nAlso borrowed from Bollywood is Raksha Bandhan, the ritual underscoring of the\nrelationship between sisters and brothers. A similarly imitated item is the wedding\nscene, including the lavish decoration of one's house. The similarity in terms of the\ndesign, the specific type of electric lamps, the wedding outfit and the colours is\nstriking. Quite often, celebrations of rich people become the talk in the community\nand on the radio because of the demonstrated richness and resemblance with the\nBollywood scene. People are often impressed by these features: `It was so beautiful,\nmost of the stuff was obtained from India, exactly like in Bollywood movies'. The\norganization of annual beauty contests, as in other diaspora communities, is\nanother type of imitation. This practice is inspired by some Bollywood actresses\nwho happened to take part in international beauty pageants and the organization\nof beauty contests elsewhere in the Indian diaspora (Mani, 2006).\nThe practices also reflect the growing popularity of the 9-day religious festival\nNavratan, celebrated by Dutch Hindustanis twice a year. This event is most likely\npicked up by Hindustani pilgrims to India. Annual festivals, such as holi phagwa,\ndiwali and nawratan, are firmly entrenched as community celebrations.\nCelebrations of these community feasts are annually broadcast nationwide by\nthe Organization Hindu Media and by community radio. These religious activities,\nas well as those in the field of yoga, are supported by the Internet and Indian gurus.\nIn some pious families, a greater number of religious festivities are observed.\nRelated festivals, aimed at the production of ethnicity, have been reported for\nIndians in the United States (Sukhla, 1997).\nAnother practice that is enjoying increasing popularity is weekend festivals,\nwhich mainly feature dancing with appearances from community music bands.\nSince 2016, a highly successful festivity called `Bollywood weekender' has been\norganized in the national CenterParcs. Here, families can spend a long weekend\nenjoying Bollywood movies, songs, dances, Indian food and several workshops\n(http://www.bollywoodweekender.nl/). A variation of this activity is special singing\nfestivals, in which several singers from the Indian diaspora take part. These festi-\nvals are especially common on heydays. In the summer, they are supplemented by\nfestivals featuring the showing of a range of Bollywood movies, dancing and other\nactivities, especially in The Hague. These events culminate around 4 June, which\ncommemorates the arrival of the first British Indians in Suriname. They are part of\ncommunity life, especially for young people. The agenda is widely broadcast via\nHindustani radio, websites and social media (Elahi, 2014).\nConclusion\nThe issue of taste is under-researched across the social sciences. The scant attention\nthat it receives focuses on individual preferences or class culture, assuming a basic-\nally uniform cultural taste. Consequently, it remains unclear how hybridizing dias-\npora communities come to share a common taste. The shaping is accounted for by\nthe concept of glocalization, but this concept does not reveal how the dissemination\nof global culture affects local tastes.\nThe article employs the concept of practice as a theoretical lens to look at taste\nmaintenance in diaspora communities. Although useful, it found the concept\nabstract and adjusted it to capture ethnic scripted and institutionalized behaviour.\nIt argues that the similarity of taste is forged by institutionalized practices subjected\nto the cultural scripts of the diaspora community. The article reveals the linkages\nbetween glocalization and script-framed institutionalized practices by focusing on\nthe home culture, the community culture and the imitation of tradition. The prac-\ntices sustaining the diaspora taste are part of the lived culture and theoretically\ncaptured as everyday ethnicity, cultural norm images and the imitation of tradition.\nWithout these activities and use values, ethnic identity and the taste for Indian\nproducts would evaporate. This account of the sustenance of taste in diaspora\nmarkets applies largely to all Indian diaspora communities since the adoption of\nIndian home culture, specifically taste as shaped by Bollywood, tourism and\nInternet, is condensed in institutional practices within the community and charac-\nteristic of all Indian diaspora communities. With some modifications, the theoret-\nical framework of this article, specifically the institutionalization of home culture in\nscripted behaviour, can be of assistance to other diaspora communities when\naccounting for taste maintenance by means of practices.\nMore generally, the theoretical concepts applied in this research were meant to\naccount for similarity of tastes in a hybrid diaspora. However, in an age of migra-\ntion and diversification of cultures, national cultures increasingly consist of hybrid\nconstellations, notably of consumer practices. This hybridity is not restricted to\nimmigrants and their descendants as focused on in this article but includes all\n(sub)cultures in the national realm \u00ad of which most are also subjected to glocaliza-\ntion. Viewing national consumer practices from the angle of glocalization, scripted\ninstitutionalized behaviour and lived culture reveals how taste is maintained even\nwhen it is modified by surrounding hybridity. Therefore, the central concepts\nemployed in this research may be a fruitful perspective to account for national\nconsumer cultures as well.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author received no financial support for the research, authorship and/or publication of\nthis article.\nReferences\nAizenman J and Brooks E (2005) Globalization and Taste Convergence: The Case of Wine\nand Beer.
