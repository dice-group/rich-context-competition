    "abstract": "Abstract\nIn this article we investigate the impact of social media readership to the editorial profile of newspapers. We analyze tweets\ncontaining links to news articles from eight of the largest national newspapers in the United States, United Kingdom, Spain,\nBrazil, and Germany. The data collection follows the first two weeks of October 2012 and includes 2,842,699 tweets\nwith links to news articles. Twitter-shortened links were resolved using a three-pass routine and assigned to 1 of the 21\nnewspaper sections. We found the concentration of links to news articles posted by top users to be lower than reported in\nthe literature and the strategy of relaying headlines on Twitter via automatic news aggregators (feeds) to be inefficient. The\nresults of this investigation show which sections of a newspaper are the most and least read by readers in different parts of\nthe world, with German readers placing greater emphasis on Politics and Economy; Brazilians on Sports and Arts; Spaniards\non Local and National news; Britons and Americans on Opinion and World news. We also found that German and Spanish\nreaders are more likely to read multiple national newspapers, while British readers more often resort to foreign sources of\nnews. The results confirm that feedback to news items from a large user base is pivotal for the replication of content and that\nnewspapers and news items can be clustered according to the editorial profile and principles of newsworthiness inherited\nfrom legacy media. The results of this investigation shed light onto the networked architecture of journalism that increasingly\ndepends on readership agency.\n",

Readers populated social media with recommenda-\ntions and suggestions for news articles, offering a view into\naudience agency and giving newsmakers an opportunity to\nunderstand how readers react to news articles. Social net-\nworking sites allowed readers to engage with each other and\nshare stories. News sites introduced widgets, small applica-\ntions that can be installed into websites to link back to news\noutlet content. Social bookmarking tools empowered users to\nrate news content and amplified their preferences for indi-\nvidual stories.\nDuring this period, news outlets turned to social network-\ning sites to compete in a fast-changing media landscape.\nTraditional newspapers developed strategies and experi-\nmented with paywall models to monetize the circulation of\nnews articles. Following the Wall Street Journal, The New\nYork Times and German publisher Axel Springer AG intro-\nduced a metered paywall for their websites of daily national\nnewspapers. British News International protected the content\nof The Times and The Sunday Times behind an \"iron-curtain,\"\nand a number of Brazilian newspapers implemented metered\npaywalls to access the newspapers' content.\nThese attempts to monetize news followed market-based\nstrategies to capture attention on social networks. A number\nof news outlets appointed social media editors and integrated\nprint and digital operations. The evolving landscape of news\ndelivery compelled organizations to invest in Research and\nDevelopment and to investigate innovative business solu-\ntions beyond the industry domain. In this period, a number of\nnews outlets--notably The Guardian, The New York Times,\nUSA Today, and National Public Radio (NPR)--deployed\npublicly available Application Programming Interfaces\n(API) that allow users to programmatically access data using\nconfigurable parameters (Aitamurto & Lewis, 2013).\nTwitter increasingly became a channel for breaking news\nstories (Ovide, 2009) and was associated with the diffusion\n1University of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil\n2Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil\nCorresponding Author:\nMarco Toledo Bastos, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, Av.

As social media became a central\nchannel for the distribution of news articles across the\nInternet, Twitter co-founder Biz Stone announced the com-\npany's ambition to create a \"Twitter News Service\" for major\nnews organizations (Bastos, Travitzki, & Puschmann, 2012;\nCowan, 2010). The announcement was in line with a series\nof modifications to emphasize Twitter's news and informa-\ntion-network strategy, and followed early attempts to build a\nnews processing system that could harness the platform's\npotential for real-time news propagation (Sankaranarayanan,\nSamet, Teitler, Lieberman, & Sperling, 2009).\nIn this paper, we investigate how circulation and classifi-\ncation of news are impacted by the growing use of social\nnetworks to distribute news articles. Although online news\nhas grown rapidly to become a major source of news in\nWestern countries (Pew Research Center, 2012; Reuters\nInstitute for the Study of Journalism [RISJ], 2013), research\nfocusing on online news is largely informed by the rationale\nset by print media and seldom evaluates the impact of social\nmedia to the building blocks of newsmaking. We expect the\nresults of this investigation to shed light onto the production\nof news that evolved into a live scheme of news reporting.\nWe will show how the relative distribution of news articles\nper section changes across countries and why the difference\nbetween broadsheet and tabloid newspapers created by leg-\nacy media organizations is still appropriate.\nPrevious Work\nThe key factors governing the newsworthiness of informa-\ntion have changed considerably since Otto Groth (1928)\ndescribed the newspaper qualifications and article attributes\nerning newsworthiness. Tunstall (1971) commented that\nbecause Galtung and Ruge's dataset was restricted to the\ncoverage of international crises, the authors ignored day-to-\nday coverage of lesser, domestic and mundane news. Seizing\non Galtung and Ruge's seminal work, journalism research\nhave periodically revisited the principles of newsworthiness.\nShoemaker and Reese (1996) offered a historical overview\nof the theory of newsworthiness and established that the pro-\ncess of selecting which events are covered by media depended\nnot only on the topic, but also on the presentation of the topic\nand the available information.\nThe reevaluation of Galtung and Ruge's research on the\nfactors' driving newsworthiness led to a general consensus\nthat the context of print media is one of increasing editorial\nemphasis on entertainment (Franklin, 1997). Harcup and\nO'Neill (2001) commented on Franklin's work and pointed\nout that no contemporary set of news values can be complete\nwithout the entertainment factor. The authors offered a\nrevised version of Galtung and Ruge's original set of factors\ninto what Harcup and O'Neill called Newspaper Agenda.\nThe criteria that govern newsworthiness became an impor-\ntant item on the agenda of journalism research and a number\nof empirical studies examined the predictability of news cov-\nerage in western industrialized (Kepplinger & Ehmig, 2006;\nPritchard & Hughes, 1997) and developing countries\nThe organization of news items according to sections is a\nlegacy from print media that is subject to change due to audi-\nence interference on newsroom decisions. Print newspapers\nhave traditionally operated with preprint templates dedicated\nto the news sections of the paper. These preprinted sections\nwere often mass-produced and stacked in suitable storage\nareas prior to the offset printing of current news (Fernandez-\n(2011) commented that the distribution of items per section\nhave changed from mid-20th-century news reporting,\nfocused on political and socioeconomic issues, to infotain-\nment news covering celebrities' personal lives and showbiz\nevents. But despite the substantial literature on online news\nas a source of information, and on news sections on print\npress, research focusing on the effects of audience agency on\nthe distribution of items per section is still forthcoming.\nThe early literature on digital news was mostly focused\non investigating whether information retrieval was more\nefficient in digital platforms, thereby allowing for a relative\nincrease in user's information consumption and news reten-\ntion. In the late nineties, a group of Scandinavian researchers\nvisited three news organizations over a period of 3 years. The\nresearchers investigated structural changes in the production\nof news due to digital platforms and reported differences that\nset news websites apart from print media (Eriksen &\nIhlstrom, 2000). Still according to this early research, news\nwebsites focus on hard news and foster the continuous\nstreaming of news similar to live reporting. During the same\nperiod, Dimitrova, Connolly-Ahern, Williams, Kaid, and\nReid (2003) looked at how online newspapers used hyper-\nlinks to refer readers to outside websites and suggested that\nthe gatekeeping role of online editors had remained strong.\nThere is also a sizable literature on the impact of online\nnews to print newspapers. Filistrucchi, Fiesolana, and\nDomenico (2005) investigated the effect of websites of daily\nnewspapers in Italy and reported a negative impact on sales of\nlocal newspapers. George (2008) studied the effects of the\nInternet to the audience of traditional American newspapers\nand found evidence that the Internet attracts younger and edu-\ncated individuals away from daily newspapers and the oppo-\nsite effect (higher newspaper circulation) among African\nAmericans and Hispanics. Gentzkow (2007) analyzed the\nWashington, D.C., market with a model that evaluates com-\nplement consumption instead of competition between exist-\ning products. Gentzkow found that print and online\nnewspapers are strong complements, even though online\nnewspaper reduced print readership by 27,000 per day.\nResearch focused on readership of news sections across\ndifferent media platforms is relatively scarce. D'Haenens,\nBastos and Zago 3\nJankowski, and Heuvelman (2004) investigated the varia-\ntions in readership between digital and print versions of two\nDutch newspapers and reported no significant differences in\nthe consumption of news in print and online platforms.\nHowever, the researchers noted a significant difference in the\namount of time spent reading each news sections in print and\nonline newspapers and found that more time was spent read-\ning the online versions of the newspapers across all news\nsections, except for sports and local news, and that online\nreaders recall more international news and less sports than\nreaders of the print version. The research also found a much\nhigher volume of local news and a higher volume of news\narticles overall in the print edition of the newspapers.\nQuandt (2008) compared the overall distribution of arti-\ncles per news sections on online news websites with patterns\nfrom content analyses of press and TV coverage (Shoemaker\n& Cohen, 2012). The researcher found a similar pattern\nacross the news ecosystem, with emphasis on national poli-\ntics and economy, followed by human-interest stories, inter-\nnational politics, crimes, sport, and culture. The investigation\nreported that online journalism--perhaps contrary to expec-\ntation--was fairly conventional in regard to the distribution\nof news items per news section (or topic categories).\nAlthough the researchers found striking similarities between\nwebsites inside a country, they also reported remarkable dif-\nferences from country to country.\nStill according to Quandt (2008), German websites fea-\ntured less national politics and more economy, sports, and\nculture; British websites featured an average number of\nitems about politics, but far more human-interest stories and\n\"social affairs\" in comparison with websites in other coun-\ntries; French websites featured a high number of world news,\nbut mostly focused on politics, with 60% of Le Monde's\narticles and 50% of Figaro's news articles being classified as\npolitics; U.S. websites presented a high volume of news arti-\ncles on crime-related stories and a higher-than-average vol-\nume of political news articles, with about 50% of the content\nbeing classified as politics; Russian websites covered mostly\npolitics, economy, and crime. The results indicated that news\nwebsites were not nearly as international as the researcher\nexpected, with content being limited by the traditional,\nnational, and linguistic interests of the readers.\nRecent studies have addressed the newspapers' audience\nbeyond the paradigm of production associated with unidirec-\ntional information. Aitamurto and Lewis (2013) investigated\nthe impact of open APIs at four news organizations and\nreported the change in news consumption habits as audi-\nences become more fragmented and accustomed to gathering\nnews from several sources rather than a single destination\nthe research on online news production and described a pre-\nvailing preference for theoretical and methodological pro-\nposals that evolved from theAmerican literature on the topic,\nand also commented on the scarce availability of research\nthat considered events taking place in other parts of the\nworld. The researchers advocate the need for investigations\nthat look at phenomena across different locales.\nAs newsrooms become more dependent on networking\ntechnology, and as journalists increasingly use social media\nto reach the public (RISJ, 2013), researchers have started to\ninvestigate the impact of social media to the news ecosys-\ntem. Hong (2012) examined the relationship between news\norganizations' adoption of social media and online reader-\nship and reported a positive correlation between newspapers'\nadoption of social media and increase in online readership.\nMessner, Linke, and Eford (2011) used content analysis to\ninvestigate the adoption of Twitter by American news outlets\nand reported that news organizations failed to use Twitter as\na community-building tool. Common to these recent studies\nis the focus on social media agency, with readers engaging in\ninstantaneous responses to articles or events and imposing\nchallenges to the scholarly division between studies of pro-\nduction and consumption tied to the unidirectional informa-\ntion architecture.\nObjectives\nIn this article, we investigate how major print newspapers\nperform in social media across five countries, taking into\nconsideration audience agency and the integration of multi-\nple media ecosystems. We investigate how the distribution of\nnews articles changes across countries and whether tradi-\ntional models of print media endure in social networks. We\nhypothesized that the editorial profile of print newspapers is\nreflected on social media and can be confirmed using cluster\nanalysis of the relative volume of news articles covering\nPolitics, Economy, Sports, Opinion, and National or World\nnews. We also expect the clustering algorithms to identify\nnewspapers dedicated to hard news stories and papers com-\nmitted to soft news topics, particularly Entertainment, Crime,\nSports, Lifestyle, Celebrities, and events triggered by the\npublic's curiosity.\nRecent studies have explored the correlation between the\ndistribution of news articles per section streamed on Twitter\nand the distribution of articles per section published on qual-\nity papers (Bastos, in press). The results indicated that Twitter\nis the only social network to present a statistically significant\ncorrelation with the distribution of news items per sections\non The Guardian and The New York Times (r = .89 and .68,\nrespectively, p < .001). Based on these recent findings, we\nexpect the diversity of links to news articles that appeared on\nTwitter stream to be a good predictor of the editorial profile\nof online newspapers.\nAlthough we cannot determine the consistency of the cri-\nteria used to assign items to news sections across news out-\nlets, this can be partially controlled for by analyzing only\nquality papers that rely on a more uniform baseline of news\neditors'decisions. For that reason, we have excluded popular\ntabloids from this research and focused on quality papers\nwith editorial styles that encompass the extremes of the\n4 SAGE Open\nbroadsheet/tabloid spectrum. The terms broadsheets and tab-\nloids stem from paper format--the earlier being printed on\nA1 paper and the later in variations of the smallerA3 paper--\nbut have been adopted to refer to editorial decisions that\ndefine newspapers' journalism standards, setting quality\npress (broadsheets) apart from popular press (tabloids). We\nexpect the analysis of the data to indicate whether social\nmedia users interact with content in a way that validates the\ndivision between broadsheet and tabloids perceived in print\nnewspapers.\nBroadsheet papers use investigative approaches to news\nthat emphasize in-depth coverage and a sober tone in articles\nand editorials, with smaller headlines and fewer pictures that\nare expected in high-quality journalism (Preston, 2004).\nWhile broadsheet newspapers emphasize hard news cover-\nage, fact-checking and research based on a timeline in which\nthe story unfolds, tabloid newspapers present on average\nlesser detailed articles, often directed by marketing depart-\nments and heavily influenced by demographic appeal and\naudience share. According to Andersen (2003), tabloid read-\nership is on average younger and less educated. The detailed\ncoverage of political issues offered by broadsheets also\nresults in a readership more interested in politics and more\nlikely to be well informed.\nThe rationale of this study is to assess the editorial profile\nof online newspapers in the face of social media feedback to\nnews items. The editorial profile of newspapers is defined by\nthe emphasis news outlets place on specific topics. The edi-\ntorial profile of newspapers Wall Street Journal, Financial\nTimes, Financial Times Deutschland, and Valor Econ\u00f4mico\nare defined by a strong emphasis on business and economic\nnews, while Los Angeles Times--likely due to the location of\nthe newspaper's headquarters in the Los Angeles--presents\na higher-than-average occurrence of infotainment news and\na special emphasis on the American film industry. A similar\nprevalence of soft news content is found on newspapers New\nYork Post and New York Daily News, while newspapers The\nNew York Times, The Guardian, and The Independent present\na higher-than-average emphasis on hard news topics, partic-\nularly Politics, Economy, and World news.\nData\nForty Newspapers Spanning Five Countries\nWe monitored tweets containing links to news articles from\neight of the largest national newspapers in the United\nStates, United Kingdom, Spain, Brazil, and Germany. The\nGreenwich Mean Time [GMT]) to Sunday, October 14,\nlection. News outlets were selected based on the circulation\nof print newspapers in Germany (Informationsgemeinschaft\nzur Feststellung der Verbreitung von Werbetr\u00e4gern e.V.,\n2012), Spain (Oficina de Justificaci\u00f3n de la Difusi\u00f3n\n[CirculationAudit Bureau; OJD], 2012), Brazil (Associa\u00e7\u00e3o\nNacional de Jornais, 2011), the United Kingdom (Audit\nBureau of Circulations [ABC], 2012), and the United States\nThe data were retrieved using the software yourTwapper-\nKeeper (O'Brien, 2010) that connects to Twitter streaming\nAPI and allows for keyword monitoring. The dataset includes\nare retweet-messages.\nFor the purposes of this investigation, we only analyzed\nnational newspapers and excluded magazines and tabloid-\njournalism newspapers. Therefore, the dataset does not\ninclude British tabloids Daily Mirror, Daily Mail, and The\nSun; German tabloid Bild; Spanish news outlets Qu\u00e9!;\nAmerican tabloids The Globe and National Enquirer; and\nBrazilian newspapers Super Not\u00edcia, Extra, and Correio do\nPovo. It does not include the magazines The Economist, Der\nSpiegel, Focus, Veja, Newsweek, and The New Yorker. British\nnewspapers The Sunday Telegraph and The Independent on\nSunday were not included because they lack a dedicated\nInternet website and depended on their sister papers to relay\nnews articles on the Internet.\nAlthough on average more readers read tabloids than\nbroadsheets (Murphy, 2003), tabloid newspapers like Bild,\nThe Sun, and Enquirer were not included in this study due to\nthe editorial styles not conforming to the principles of quality\npress that we investigate in this article. Moreover, the signifi-\ncantly higher circulation of tabloids can skew the dataset and\nstrongly affect the analysis of national newspapers. London-\nbased newspaper Daily Express, though arguably a tabloid-\nnewspaper, was selected to fill the position of the eighth\nnational newspaper in the United Kingdom due to the circu-\nlation figures similar to national quality papers. Table 1\nshows all news outlets investigated in this study.\nData Cleaning and Processing\nWe removed spam messages from the dataset and tabulated\nthe data according to the attention share (sheer number of\nlinks) received by each news outlet and the overall volume of\nlinks per country. The processed data shows the circulation\nof highly retweeted and mentioned messages, the relative\noccurrence of overlapping users, and the concentration of\nlinks to news articles posted by top users. About one third of\nthe dataset (35%) includes links to American news outlets,\nwhile Spanish newspapers account for more than a quarter\n(28%) and British newspapers for about a fifth (19%) of the\ndataset. The remaining fifth of the dataset includes Brazilian\n(14%) and German (4%) news outlets. Figure 1 shows the\ndistribution of links to news outlets in the United States,\nBastos and Zago 5\nUnited Kingdom, Spain, Brazil, and Germany during the 14\ndays of data collection.\nNews Articles Timeline\nVisualizing the longitudinal distribution of news articles\nthrough the day is challenging because of the multiple time\nzones in the United States and Brazil and the different time\nzones in the United Kingdom, Spain, and Germany. Time\nzones were adjusted to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)+0\n(GMT), using Eastern Standard Time (EST) zone as refer-\nence for news articles from the United States, Bras\u00edlia for\nBrazil, and the official times for the United Kingdom, Spain,\nand Germany. Figure 2 shows the timeline of news articles\nthrough the day and indicates an abrupt peak of American\nlinks to news articles as early as 05:00 followed by subse-\nnews articles in other countries follow a similar pattern, yet\nthe peak is not as accentuated as observed in the United\nStates. Links to news articles of Spanish newspapers present\na slightly different pattern, increasing steadily from 06:00 to\ndue to Spaniards routine of slowing down for lunch around\nTwitter Clients\nThe processed data indicate which Twitter client was used to\npost links to news articles, thus allowing for the identifica-\ntion of news articles being actively distributed by users or by\nautomatic applications. We found that twitterfeed, a utility\nthat allows the feeding of content from website Rich Site\nSummary (RSS) feeds to Twitter; HootSuite, a social media\nmanagement system for brand management; and dlvr.it, an\napplication that automatically delivers content to paid media\nchannels, were responsible on average for 25% of all links to\nnews articles. The remaining 75% is mainly distributed\nacross Twitter website (19%), Tweet Button (12%), Twitter\nfor iPhone (9%), and Twitter for Android (7%). The data are\nconsistent with previous reports (Sysomos, 2009) that found\nfewer than half of tweets being posted using the web user\ninterface, and that most users used third-party applications.\nFigure 3 shows the distribution of Twitter clients per\ncountry.\nDue to the high diversity of clients operating within the\nTwitter system--as of July 2011, Twitter's ecosystem com-\nprised over one million applications, services, and clients\n(Twitter, 2011)--We manually coded Twitter services, cli-\nents, and applications into four groups according to user's\nusage: desktop, mobile, feeds, and managers. These groups\nTable 1.

Percentage of links to news articles of American, British, Spanish, Brazilian, and German news outlets.\n6 SAGE Open\nindicate whether links were distributed by active users or\ngenerated by automatic updates. The first group includes\ndesktop applications and web services that depend on user's\ninput to feed Twitter's microblogging service via desktop\nsoftware or Internet browsers. The second group also requires\nuser's input and includes news articles posted using mobile\nplatforms, including tablets and mobile phones.\nThe third group contains news items relayed automati-\ncally by bots or news feed, so that content is frequently\nupdated and distributed on Twitter from the publisher's web-\nsite. The last group refers to social media management plat-\nforms, which integrate a number of social networks and\nprovide elementary analytics. Social media optimization\n(SMO) services that aim at increasing the awareness of a\nproduct, brand, or event, such as SocialFlow and dlvr.it, were\nsplit between the third (feeds) and the fourth (managers)\ngroups depending on the company's business model.\nFigure 4 shows the distribution of Twitter clients used to\npost news articles across countries and the distribution of\nTwitter clients per country. Even though Desktop (39%),\nMobile (34%), and Feeds (25%) are the predominant source\nof news articles across the dataset, Figure 4 shows a signifi-\ncant variance across countries. Countries with a large num-\nber of highly active users, such as the United States, United\nKingdom, and Spain present a much higher percentage of\nlinks to news articles from mobile platforms, while countries\nwith fewer highly active users present a lower incidence of\nmobile platforms and a much higher percentage of items\nautomatically relayed by news aggregators (news feeds) and\nbots.\nFigure 2.

Distribution of Twitter clients used to post links to news articles per country.\nBastos and Zago 7\nMethod\nSingletons\nWe analyzed the data to understand how news items are\nreleased on Twitter and the prevailing news sections in each\ncountry. We relied on the classification of Twitter clients to\ninvestigate the relationship between the diversity of Twitter\nclients and the replication of news articles on Twitter. We\nidentified the news outlets that resorted to Twitter as a mere\nbroadcasting channel and the outlets that relied on Twitter to\nengage with their audiences by calculating the percentage of\nmessages with links to news article that did not generate any\nconversation by means of RT, AT, or replication of the link to\nthe news article. We called these messages singletons, as\nthey refer to a set of messages with exactly one element (rep-\nlication = 0). We compared the percentage of singletons with\nthe percentage of messages relayed automatically by bots or\nnews aggregators (feeds).\nResolving Twitter Links\nLinks shared on Twitter are automatically shortened to the\nlinks before classifying news articles into news sections.\nTwitter links were expanded using a three-pass routine to\nresolve nested shortened URLs (i.e., previously shortened\nbit.ly URLs that are again shortened by the t.co URL wrap-\nper) and to retrieve the target URLs. After resolving the\naddresses, we removed links that returned error, spam, or\nsweepstakes (promotional offers).\nHard-paywalled links allow minimal to no access to con-\ntent without paid subscription, and most of the links pointed\nto British newspapers The Times and The Sunday Times, and\nto American news outlet The Wall Street Journal. Articles\nfrom news outlets that have adopted \"hard paywalls\"\namounted to 20,655 news links that could not be classified\nand were thus removed from the dataset. We also removed\nlinks that failed to be replicated or that pointed to newspa-\npers' Picture of the Day, as the varied content could not be\nclassified into any newspaper section. Tables 2 and 3 show\nthe process of converting Twitter raw data with tweet and\nparsed shortened URL into a table with resolved URLs and\nthe section of the news articles.\nAssigning News Sections\nNews articles with web URL link format that did not include\nthe news section of articles impose further challenges to the\nanalysis. American newspaper The Wall Street Journal,\nGerman newspaper die Tageszeitung, British The Sunday\nTimes, and Spanish daily newspapers El Correo, El Periodico,\nand La Raz\u00f3n adopted domain structures that frequently lack\nthe section of the news article. In these cases, we performed\na customized search with regular expression matching to\nidentify the newspaper sections. Blogs affiliated with media\noutlets also posed challenges to the classification and\nrequired customized regular expressions given the wide vari-\nety of domain structure observed, but the final processed\ndata also include blog posts from journalists affiliated to the\ninvestigated newspapers.\nEl Pa\u00eds popular special section \"Vi\u00f1etas,\" commentator\narticles, and open-editorials were grouped in the section\nOpinion, which also includes editorials and newspapers' col-\numnist articles. A number of German newspapers have a spe-\ncial section on bicycles, particularly Die Zeit, and these news\narticles were grouped in the section Cars because they refer\nto bicycles as a means of transport. Articles on parenting\nwere classified in the Lifestyle section, elections in the\nPolitics group, obituaries in Local News, Career in Jobs,\nTravel advice in Tourism, and Videogames in Entertainment\n(not in Technology). Table 4 shows a column with news sec-\ntions across countries and the most common labeled news\nFigure 4. Twitter clients used to release news article per country (left) and overall ratio of Twitter clients (right).\n8 SAGE Open\nsections in each country (sample from a bag-of-words with\nsified into one of the following 21 news sections: Arts, Cars,\nCrime, Economy, Education, Entertainment, Environment,\nFashion, Health, Jobs, Lifestyle, Local news, National news,\nWorld news, Opinion, Politics, Science, Sports, Technology,\nTourism, and Weather. Our method of classification success-\nfully resolved, identified, and assigned news sections to\nthus successfully classifying 68% of the news articles. The\nprocessed data offers an interesting and novel overview of\nnews articles that circulated on the Twittersphere during the\nperiod under investigation.\nClustering Analysis\nWe exploited our prior knowledge of the properties of the\ndataset and used the \"elbow\" method (percentage of variance\nexplained as a function of the number of clusters) to deter-\nmine the appropriate value of k. We found the optimal\nrelationship between newspapers, and 2 clusters over\ntions. We applied a standard clustering algorithm (k-means)\nusing Euclidean distance on the frequency of news sections\nper newspaper. We also calculated the hierarchic clustering\nby transforming the affiliation matrix into a distance matrix\nbetween newspapers and news sections. The first clustering\nanalysis was performed using a matrix of pairwise dissimi-\nlarities (1-similarity) between newspapers, and the second\nclustering analysis was performed on a matrix of pairwise\ndissimilarities between news sections.\nThe aim of the clustering analysis is to evaluate whether\nuser's preference for news sections and news outlets reflects\nthe perceived editorial decisions made by newspapers and\nnewspersons that separate newspapers into broadsheets and\ntabloids--the first group including news outlets with focus\non hard news, and the later including newspapers that focus\non infotainment and soft news events. The second clustering\nanalysis on a matrix of news sections was performed to eval-\nuate whether the online distribution of news articles is\nTable 3.

The results of these analy-\nses are presented in the next section.\nResults\nReadership\nWe found that the number of links to news articles from AT\nvaries little across news outlets of different countries (X =\n0.3%), but the number of links to news articles from retweet-\nmessages (RT) varies considerably (X = 7%), being signifi-\ncantly higher in Spanish news outlets (44%) and significantly\nlower in German newspapers (24%). We also found that the\nproportion of retweeted news articles in American, British,\nand Brazilian news outlets is fairly equal (X = 1%). Figure\n5 shows the number of links to news articles from tweets, RT,\nand AT for each of the 40 news outlets investigated in this\nstudy.\nWe found statistical significant correlations between the\nvolume of tweets, retweets, and the number of connections\nbetween users that relayed a news article link. Leading news-\npapers within their respective countries presented statistically\nsignificant correlations between retweets and tweets (r = .92,\np < .001) and between retweets and network topology (r = .92\nand r = .89, respectively, p < .001), particularly the news out-\nlets The New York Times and Washington Post in the United\nStates, The Guardian and Daily Telegraph in the United\nKingdom, El Pa\u00eds and El Mundo in Spain, Estado de S.Paulo\nand Folha de S.Paulo in Brazil, and Die Welt and Frankfurter\nAllgemeine Zeitung in Germany.\nWe examined the concentration of links to news articles\nposted by top users and found that on average 5% of users\nare responsible for 50% of links to news articles across the\nfive countries, being as high as 62% in Brazil and as low as\n46% in the United Kingdom. Table 5 shows that on average\n50% of all URL links to news articles are posted by just 5%\nof users, but our results are at odds with the importance of\ntop users found in previous studies on the distribution of\nURL links. Wu, Hofman, Mason, and Watts (2011) reported\nthat less than 0.05% of Twitter users attracted almost 50% of\nall attention within Twitter, while our results indicate that\n0.05% of Twitter users posted on average only 10% of URL\nlinks to news articles and significantly less in highly active\ncountries like the United States and the United Kingdom.\nThe results also present a point of departure from previous\ninvestigations that identified the importance of gatekeeping\nin online newspapers (Dimitrova et al., 2003) and confirm\nthe influence of a large community of least-active users\n(Bastos, Raimundo, & Travitzki, 2013) that posted one fifth\nof the links to news articles that circulated on Twitter in the\nperiod.\nTable 6 shows the overlapping of users (shared reader-\nship) across different countries and within the same country.\nThese figures refer to users that posted links to more than one\nnews outlet within the same country, in the\nTable 4.

The table shows high cross-readership\nwithin Germany and Spain and low cross-readership within\nthe United States, United Kingdom, and Brazil. These fig-\nures refer to the percentage of users that read and post links\nto more than one news outlet in the country and indicate that\nGerman and Spanish users read on average more different\nnewspapers than their counterparts in Brazil, United\nKingdom, and United States.\nThe table also shows that British users read a higher-than-\naverage volume of news articles from foreign countries,\nlikely due to the remarkably high cross-readership between\nAmerican and British readers (40,368 users distributed links\nto American and British newspapers). The table also shows\nthat Spanish and Brazilian readers are the least likely to read\nand distribute links to news articles of foreign countries.\nPerhaps\nsurprisingly, British readers are more likely to read and\ndistribute content to supplementary newspapers outside the\ncountry than read and distribute links to additional British\nnewspapers.\nWe compared the percentage of links to news articles per\nnewspaper on Twitter with the newspapers' market share in\nprint circulation, which was calculated based solely on the\nset of eight newspapers in each country. Table 7 shows the\ncountrywise differences between the percentage of printed\nnewspapers' circulation and the percentage of news articles\non Twitter. We highlighted in red the figures of news outlets\nFigure 5. Number of links to news articles from tweets, retweets and mention-messages per news outlet.\nTable 5. Participation of Top Users in the Distribution of Links to News Articles Per Country.\nThe United States The United Kingdom Spain Brazil Germany Total\nexperiencing a decline in the circulation of news links on\nTwitter relative to the figures of print newspapers. Sixty per-\ncent of the newspapers investigated in this study are experi-\nencing a decline in the readership share in comparison with\ntheir print circulation.\nUSA Today, Daily Express, Zero Hora, and Die Zeit are\nthe news outlets that registered the highest losses, while Los\nAngeles Times, The Guardian, The Independent, El Pa\u00eds,\nEstado de S.Paulo, and Die Welt present a higher share in the\nvolume of links to news articles on Twitter relative to the\ncirculation of their printed newspapers. In Spain, even\nthough the fluctuation is lower-than-average compared with\nother countries, we found that only El Pa\u00eds and ABC news\noutlets presented an increase in the ratio between the circula-\ntion of printed newspapers and the diffusion of news articles\non Twitter.\nBroadcasting Singletons\nNewsoutletswithhighlevelsofengagementonTwittersphere,\nsuch as The Times, El Pa\u00eds, El Mundo, Estado de S.Paulo,\nO Globo, Washington Post, and Wall Street Journal consis-\ntently reported lower number of singletons and lower per-\ncentage of messages relayed by automatic aggregators\n(feeds). Based on this finding, we tested the hypothesis that\nnews outlets that have most of their content posted via auto-\nmatic feeds, using tools that link content from website RSS\nfeeds to Twitter, are bound to generate low levels of interac-\ntion regardless of the volume of messages posted on Twitter.\nThe results confirmed the hypothesis, showing a two-tier\nstructure of highly interactive news outlets, with lower than\naverage number of singletons and low number of tweets\nposted via RSS feeds, and a group of highly active, but not\nhighly interactive group of news outlets, which resort to\nTwitter as another channel to rely content irrespective to\nfeedback from users.\nWe found a significant correlation between news articles\nrelayed by automatic feeds and news articles that failed to\nengage the audiences at the national level and with respect to\neach news outlet. We performed a statistical correlation anal-\nysis on the two variables and found that the proportion of\nsingleton have a significant correlation with the proportion\nof tweets relayed by automatic feeds (r = .78, p < .001). We\nhave not found any further positive significant correlation\nwith the remaining Twitter clients used to post messages.\nMobile and Desktop platforms presented negative correla-\ntions with the number of singletons (r = \u00ad.64 and r = \u00ad.56,\nrespectively, p < .001), and social media management plat-\nforms did not present significant results (r = .24, p < .001).\nWe conducted a t-test of statistical significance to compare\nthe percentage of tweets posted from news feeds and the per-\ncentage of singletons on each news outlet. The results of the\nt-test within 40 newspapers rejected the null hypothesis of\nunequal variances, indicating symmetrical variances and\npositive correlation between tweets posted from news feeds\nand singletons--that is, tweets that did not generate any con-\nBased on these results, we fitted a linear regression model\nbetween the percentage of tweets posted from news feeds\nand the percentage of singletons on each news outlet. Even\nwithout removing outliers, the results of the linear regression\nreported a Multiple R of .78 with R Square of .61 and\nAdjusted R Square of .60 (p < .001), thus indicating that\nnews articles released on Twitter by automatic feeds tend to\ngenerate little to no reaction and are unlikely to be read.\nFigure 6 shows the percentage of singletons and the percent-\nage of tweets posted from news feeds with the fitted linear\nregression model. Figure 7 shows the percentage of repli-\ncated news articles and the percentage of tweets posted from\ndesktop Twitter clients with the fitted linear regression\nmodel.\nThe results indicate a linear relationship between news\narticles posted from news feeds and news articles that are not\nreplicated. Conversely, there is a linear relationship between\nnews articles posted from desktop Twitter clients and mes-\nsages that are replicated. The results indicate that the news\noutlets' strategy of automatically broadcasting their content\nto social media is not effective, as the links to news articles\nare not replicated and likely remain ignored. On the other\nhand, news articles posted from Twitter desktop clients pres-\nent a linear relationship with message replication, therefore\nsuggesting that news articles actively posted and commented\nTable 7.

American newspapers\npresent a lower-than-average volume of articles about Arts,\nEconomy, and Local news, and a higher-than-average vol-\nume of news articles covering Entertainment, Fashion,\nOpinion, National, and World news. Links to news articles\nfrom British newspapers are more often Opinion,\nEnvironment, Education, Lifestyle, and World news pieces,\nand less often about Politics, Local, and National news.\nSpanish news articles present a higher-than-average inci-\ndence of Local and National news and a lower-than-average\nincidence of news articles on Politics and Sports.\nLinks to Brazilian news articles proportionally empha-\nsize Sports, Arts, Education, Technology, and National\nnews, but also present a lower-than-average volume of news\narticles about Economy, Opinion, and World news. German\nnews outlets present a much higher-than-average volume of\nnews articles about Economy and Politics and much lower-\nthan-average volume of news articles about Entertainment,\nOpinion, and National news. Figures 8 shows the absolute\nnumber of news articles per section across countries and\nFigure 9 shows the normalized (relative) performance of\neach news section per country.\nFigure 6. Tweets posted from news feeds with percentage of nonreplicated and replicated tweets.\nBroadsheets Versus Tabloids\nWe investigated whether the separation between broadsheet\nand tabloids used in print newspapers is consistent with the\ncontent distributed online. Although we have focused on\nquality newspapers, the editorial styles of news outlets inves-\ntigated in this study present a variation that encompasses the\nbroadsheet and tabloid spectrum. We confirmed the hypoth-\nesis that newspapers can be grouped by cluster algorithms\nbased on the relative volume of news articles covering hard\nand soft news topics, and the groups classified by the cluster-\ning analysis are consistent with the perceived editorial style\nof the news outlets.\nThe results revealed a clear division between news out-\nlets that emphasize infotainment news and news outlets that\ncover hard news stories. The clustering analysis with\nk-means algorithm reported four clusters comprehending\ntered papers with a large volume of soft news items, includ-\ning Los Angeles Times, New York Daily News, New York\nPost, Chicago Sun-Times, USA Today, The Sunday Times, El\nCorreo, La Vanguardia, Estado de S.Paulo, Jornal do\nCommercio, and Zero Hora. Group 2 clustered most German\nnewspapers and includes The Washington Post, Evening\nStandard, El Peri\u00f3dico, Folha de S.Paulo, Valor Econ\u00f4mico,\nFrankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Frankfurter Rundschau,\nFinancial Times Deutschland, S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, Die\nTagesspiegel, Die Welt, and Die Zeit.\nGroup 3 includes local news outlets or newspapers with a\nlarger-than-average volume of local news, including Daily\nExpress, ABC, La Raz\u00f3n, La Voz de Galicia, and Correio\nBraziliense. Group 4 includes the leading newspapers in\nmost countries and also clustered news outlets with an edito-\nrial emphasis on high journalism standards. This last group\nFigure 8.

Except for German newspaper\ndie Tageszeitung and Brazilian newspaper Estado de Minas,\nthe news outlets clustered in Group 4 are leading newspapers\nwithin their respective countries and present a higher-than-\naverage volume of hard news articles. Figure 10 shows the 40\nnewspapers clustered into four groups according to the rela-\ntive distribution of news articles per news section.\nThe results from the hierarchical clustering based on\nsquared Euclidean distances between the 40 news outlets\nreturned a dendrogram that clustered newspapers with high\nvolume of news articles dedicated to hard-news stories, such\nas Politics, Opinion, Local, National, and World news. The\ncenter of the dendrogram includes a much larger group of\nnewspapers that also covered hard-news topics, but which also\npresented a higher volume of soft-news material. Figure 11\nshows a circular dendrogram that clusters liberal news outlets\nThe Guardian and The New York Times, and proceeds includ-\ning newspapers with similar editorial profile, including The\nIndependent, Washington Post, and die Tageszeitung. The sub-\nsequent clusters include leading British newspapers The Times\nand Daily Telegraph, followed by leading Spanish and\nBrazilian newspapers El Pa\u00eds and O Globo.\nNot surprisingly, Figure 11 shows business-oriented news\noutlets Financial Times and The Wall Street Journal clus-\ntered together (based on k-means and hierarchical clustering)\non the left part of Figure 11, and also Valor Econ\u00f4mico and\nFinancial Times Deutschland on the top of the circle. German\nleading newspapers Die Zeit, S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, and\nFrankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung are also clustered together\non the top left of the ring. As expected, newspapers with a\nhigh volume of infotainment and soft news content clustered\ntogether at the lower-left portion of the circle, including\nnews outlets New York Post, Los Angeles Times, New York\nDaily News, and Chicago Sun-Times. Daily Express, which\nas previously mentioned presents a sensibly different edito-\nrial style, but also newspapers with lower-than-average cir-\nculation like Estado de Minas, Correio Braziliense, and\nLa Raz\u00f3n, fail to cluster with other newspapers and appear at\nthe end of the circle.\nHard and Soft News\nWe also performed a clustering analysis based on squared\nEuclidean distances between the 21 news sections. We\nexpected the relative distance between news sections to be\nconsistent with the newsworthiness criteria that classify\nnews articles into hard and soft news. The cluster analysis\nwith k-means algorithm revealed a clear separation between\nhard and soft news topics without the need for any hand cod-\ning. The cluster analysis returned the two groups shown in\nFigure 12. The first group contains six sections and it clus-\ntered the hard news topics Economy, Opinion, Politics, and\nLocal, National, and World news. The second group clus-\ntered 15 soft news sections, including Arts, Cars, Crime,\nEducation, Entertainment, Environment, Fashion, Health,\nJobs, Lifestyle, Science, Sports, Technology, Tourism, and\nWeather.\nWe also simulated the relationship between newspapers\nand news sections as a bipartite predator\u00adprey network with\ntwo trophic levels (Figure 13). The lower level of the plot\nshows the most tweeted sections in increasing order of\nimportance across countries, with Politics, National, World,\nand Economy as the most popular sections among Twitter\nFigure 10. Newspapers clustered (dissimilarity measure based\non Euclidean distance) into four groups according to the relative\ndistribution of news articles per news section. Ordination axes\nindicate the total variation in the dataset.\nusers in the five countries, followed by Sports, Local news,\nOpinion pieces, Entertainment, and Arts. The upper level\nindicates the predominance of news sections per country.\nGerman newspapers present a higher-than-average volume\nof news articles focusing on Politics and Economy; Brazilian\nnewspapers emphasize Sports and Politics; Spanish newspa-\npers show a significant volume of articles on Local and\nNational news, and American newspapers include a much\nhigher-than-average volume of messages on Entertainment.\nFigure 14 draws a food web as a grid using a matrix of\nnews sections and newspapers. It shows three groups of\nnewspapers. The group on the right includes leading newspa-\npers within their respective countries, with a higher volume\nof hard news articles but also a considerable volume of arti-\ncles across the range of news sections. The group on the left\nincludes papers that emphasize soft news topics, and again\nwe observe the same news outlets clustered with the k-means\nalgorithm: Los Angeles Times, New York Daily News, New\nYork Post, Chicago Sun-Times, USA Today, The Sunday\nTimes, El Correo, La Vanguardia, Estado de S.Paulo, Jornal\ndo Commercio, and Zero Hora. The group in the middle\nincludes most of the German news outlets that presented a\nhigher-than-average volume of news articles on Politics and\nEconomy, but also an overall low volume of news items\naltogether.\nConclusion\nThe results reported in this paper indicate that the ecosystem\nof newsmaking is going through considerable changes.\nAudiences now have the opportunity to express their agency,\nnot only as readers of texts but also as a fundamental piece\nthat decides which news articles are replicated and which\nnews sections gets the most attention across social network-\ning sites. This investigation sheds light into the transformed\narchitecture of journalism that increasingly relies on the par-\nticipation of audiences (Mitchelstein & Boczkowski, 2009)\nand on the integration of multiple media ecosystems. We\nhave shown how the distribution of news articles and sec-\ntions change across countries and whether traditional models\nfrom print media endure in social networks.\nThe leading newspapers in their respective countries per-\nformed better than average on Twitter, particularly El Pa\u00eds in\nSpain, The New York Times in the United States, Estado de\nS.Paulo in Brazil, S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung in Germany, and\nDaily Telegraph in the United Kingdom. We established that\nthe overall strategy of news outlets to relay links to news\narticles on Twitter via website feeds is inefficient, as most\nlinks remain singletons and likely unread. We also found that\nnews articles tweeted using mobile and desktop platforms\nare much more likely to be replicated, and that countries with\na larger volume of news articles also present a larger volume\nof mobile platform usage, though not necessarily a larger\nuser base. These results confirm that feedback to news items\nfrom a large user base is pivotal for the replication of the\ncontent across social networks.\nWhile most newspapers investigated in this study pre-\nsented a decline in the readership share in comparison with\ntheir print circulation, the results also show that German and\nSpanish readers are more likely to read multiple national\nnewspapers, and that British readers are more likely to resort\nto foreign sources of news than their counterparts in Brazil,\nUnited Kingdom, and United States. Contrary to previous\nresearch, we found the concentration of links to news articles\nposted by top users to be fairly low, as around a fifth of the\nlinks to news articles that circulated on Twitter in the period\nwere posted by a large community of least-active users. The\nresults also show that news readership on Twitter replicates\nthe editorial profile of print publications, as new outlets are\nclearly grouped according to their editorial profile. The dif-\nferences between broadsheet and tabloid inherited from leg-\nacy media remain relatively unchanged in terms of content\nshared on Twitter.\nConsistent with previous research (Quandt, 2008), we\nfound that different national cultures place different weights\non news sections. Perhaps confirming and conflicting with\nthe perceived stereotypes of nationalities reported in public\nopinion research (Prothro, 1954; Reigrotski & Anderson,\n1959), German readers placed greater emphasis on Politics\nand Economy; Brazilians on Sports and Arts; Spaniards on\nLocal and National news; Britons and Americans on Opinion\nand World news. On the other hand, and perhaps further\naccentuating positive and negative cultural stereotypes\nreported in social psychology literature (Cuddy et al., 2009;\nplaced less emphasis on Economy and Arts; Britons on\nPolitics and Local news; Spaniards on Sports and Politics;\nBrazilians on Opinion items and World news; and Germans\non National and World news.\nFigure 12. Clustering of news sections across newspapers with\nordination axes indicating the total variation found in the dataset.\nCluster 1 includes hard news stories while Cluster 2 groups soft\nnews items.\nFinally, the methodology and the results presented in\nthis paper are only possible due to the recent availability\nof social network data. Twitter in particular and social net-\nworks in general provide avenues for quantitative research\nat unprecedented scales. The understanding of which\nnews sections of newspapers are the most and least read\nby readers in different parts of the world was until recently\nvery restricted due to scanty data. Social media data not\nonly allowed for this novel approach, but also likely\nchanged the circulation and access to news items. We\nexpect the availability of social network to data to support\nnew lines of research inquiry and novel research methods\ndesigned to explore the networked architecture of online\njournalism.\nFigure 13.
