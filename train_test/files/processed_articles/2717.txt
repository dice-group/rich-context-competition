The current study exam-\nines the degree to which differences in sleep between black/\nAfrican American (AA) and white/European American (EA) adults\nexplain racial differences in cardiometabolic (CMB) disease risk.\nTotal sleep time and sleep efficiency (percent of time in bed\nasleep) were assessed via seven nights of wrist actigraphy among\n426 participants in the Midlife in the United States Study (31% AA;\na composite of seven biomarkers [blood pressure, waist circumfer-\nence, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c\n), insulin resistance, triglycerides,\nHDL cholesterol (HDL-C), and C-reactive protein]. Covariates in-\ncluded sociodemographic characteristics and relevant health behav-\niors. Results indicated that AAs relative to EAs obtained less sleep\nCMB risk was explained by sleep time and sleep efficiency, respec-\ntively. In models stratified by sex, race was indirectly associated\nwith CMB risk via sleep time and efficiency only among females\n(explaining 33% and 65% of the race difference, respectively). In-\ndirect effects were robust to alternative model specifications that\nexcluded participants with diabetes or heart disease. Consideration\nof sleep determinants and sleep health is therefore needed in\nefforts to reduce racial differences in CMB disease.\nhealth disparities | race | sleep | cardiometabolic disease | health behaviors\nBlack/African American adults (AAs) have disproportionately\nhigh rates of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases com-\npared with white/European American (EAs), including elevated\nhypertension, diabetes, and stroke prevalence (1, 2). The re-\nduction of these racial health disparities has become a pillar of the\nUnited States' national health strategy (3, 4). However, given the\ncomplexity of risk exposures at multiple levels and numerous\npotential mechanisms (5, 6), the underlying reasons for AA\u00adEA\nhealth differences are not well understood. For example, differ-\nences in health behaviors related to cardiometabolic (CMB) dis-\nease risk--namely, diet, physical activity, and smoking--have been\nconsidered as behavioral pathways through which AAs experience\ngreater health risk, but adjusting for these behaviors leaves a\nsubstantial racial gap in CMB conditions unexplained (6\u00ad8).\nThree recent review papers have proposed that differences in\nsleep patterns are one further behavioral mediator of the un-\nequal cardiovascular disease and diabetes burden between AA\nand EA adults (9\u00ad11). Race differences are apparent across\nseveral sleep parameters even after adjusting for socioeconomic\ncharacteristics, so that AAs are more likely to sleep for an in-\nsufficient duration and to experience fragmented sleep relative\nto EAs (12, 13). In turn, sleep problems are risk factors for\ncoronary heart disease, stroke, hypertension, and diabetes and\npredispose to more abdominal adiposity and low-grade systemic\ninflammation (14\u00ad19). Despite the expanding literature, few\nstudies have examined sleep as a mediator of AA\u00adEA differ-\nences in CMB diseases. Specifically, to our knowledge, sleep has\nbeen considered as a mediator of racial differences only in blood\npressure (16, 20, 21), and therefore additional research is needed\nto examine CMB dysregulation more widely.\nTherefore the primary aim of the current study was to test the\ndegree to which differences in habitual sleep explain racial dif-\nferences in CMB disease risk. Data were derived from 426 AA\nand EA adults from the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS)\nstudy who participated in a sleep substudy. Total sleep time and\nsleep efficiency (i.e., the percentage of the time in bed spent\nsleeping) were measured over seven nights using actigraphy--a\nwatch-like activity monitor that has good correspondence with\npolysomnography (22). CMB risk was measured as a composite of\nideal, borderline high, and high (coded as 0, 1, and 2, respectively)\nlevels of waist circumference, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c\n), insulin\nresistance [homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance\n(HOMA-IR)], blood pressure, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol (HDL-\nC), and C-reactive protein (CRP) (Table 1) (23\u00ad25). CMB risk scores\nwere averaged across the biomarkers so that total scores ranged\nfrom 0 to 2. Additional models were fit to examine whether as-\nsociations between sleep and CMB risk varied by demographic\nfactors (race, sex, and age) and, given that AA\u00adEA differences in\nobesity and diabetes are larger for females than for males (26, 27),\nwhether mediation of racial differences in CMB risk varied by sex.\nTo reduce the likelihood of reverse causality, we also tested study\nhypotheses among participants without heart disease or diabetes.\nResults\nSample descriptive statistics are listed by race in Table 2. Race\ndifferences were identified in several of the sociodemographics,\nhealth behaviors, and CMB markers. Notably, AAs obtained nearly\n40 fewer minutes of sleep and had 10% lower sleep efficiency than\nSignificance\nLarge differences in cardiovascular disease and diabetes\nprevalence exist between African American and European\nAmerican adults. The US federal government has committed\nto reducing racial disparities in health; however, the precise\nmechanisms are not well understood. Sleep is one potential\nbehavioral explanation for current racial differences in car-\ndiometabolic conditions. We show that more than one-half\nof racial differences in cardiometabolic risk can be explained\nby sleep patterns--namely, less total sleep and lower sleep\nefficiency among African American than European American\nadults. Sleep is a malleable health behavior that is linked with\ncharacteristics of the social and physical environment and could\nbe an effective target in national efforts to reduce racial\nhealth disparities.\nAuthor contributions: D.S.C., T.E.F.-R., M.E.-S., M.R.C., and C.D.R. designed research; D.S.C.\nand C.D.R. performed research; D.S.C. and T.E.F.-R. analyzed data; and D.S.C., T.E.F.-R.,\nM.E.-S., M.R.C., and C.D.R. wrote the paper.\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.\nThis article is a PNAS Direct Submission.

Further, AAs relative to EAs had significantly larger\nwaist circumference, higher diastolic blood pressure, HbA1c\n,\nHOMA-IR, and CRP levels but had a more favorable lipid\nprofile (lower triglycerides and higher HDL-C). In total, AAs had\na higher unadjusted CMB risk than EAs including higher risk\nscores for four of the individual CMB risk scores.\nRacial Differences in Sleep and CMB Risk. After adjusting for soci-\nodemographic characteristics, AAs obtained less sleep per night\nhad lower sleep efficiency (B = -10.14 percentage points, SE =\nlent to an effect size of 0.63 and 0.95 SD units, respectively.\nSee Table 3 for parameter estimates for Models 1\u00ad4. In Model\n1, AAs had elevated CMB risk relative to EAs (B = 0.15, 95% CI:\n0.05, 0.26) after adjusting for sociodemographics, a difference\nequivalent to 0.32 SD units. When CMB risk was further adjusted\nfor diet, exercise, cigarette smoker status, and depressive symp-\ntoms (Model 2), the racial gap in CMB risk was attenuated by\nSleep Indicators Explain Differences in CMB Risk. Total sleep time\nand sleep efficiency were added separately as predictors of CMB\nrisk in Models 3 and 4, respectively. We found that shorter sleep\ntime was significantly associated with greater CMB risk (B =\neffect of race on CMB risk via sleep time was detected (B = 0.05,\nwhich was no longer significant. Nonlinear associations between\nsleep time and CMB risk were also tested using sleep time\nsquared, but results indicated no significant association (P = 0.60).\nIn Model 4, lower sleep efficiency was associated with greater\ndifferences in CMB risk were found to operate partly through\nthat the racial gap in CMB risk was reduced by 58% and was\nnonsignificant. When sleep variables were simultaneously tested\nas mediators, the race estimate in CMB risk was similar to Model\n2), but neither of the indirect effects (sleep time: B = 0.03, 95%\nwas significant, likely because of multicollinearity.\nWe also examined race, age, and sex as moderators of the link\nbetween sleep and CMB risk (see Table S1 for full results). No\nevidence of moderation by racial group or age was found for either\nof the sleep indicators. In contrast, sex moderated associations\nbetween both sleep indicators and CMB risk (sleep time: P = 0.005;\nefficiency: P = <0.001), indicating that the link between sleep and\nCMB risk was stronger for females than for males.\nSex-Stratified Models. Models 1\u00ad4 were also fit in sex-stratified\nsubsamples. Because the sample of AA males was small, analyses\nin the male subsample were exploratory and are described in\nSupporting Information. AA females obtained 0.75 h less sleep\nand had 9.1% lower sleep efficiency than EA females (Ps <\n0.001). Differences in CMB risk were also substantial, so that,\nafter adjusting for demographics, AA females had 0.52 SD units\nAs depicted in Models 2\u00ad4 of Table S2, health behaviors, sleep\ntime, and sleep efficiency were tested as explanations for differential\nCMB risk between AA and EA females.

Antihypertensives were\nincluded as a predictor of systolic and diastolic blood pressure,\nand lipid-lowering medications were included as a predictor of\ntriglycerides and HDL-C levels. Results are shown in Table S3.\nIn summary, relative to EAs, AAs had larger waist circumfer-\nence, greater HbA1c\n, HOMA-IR, and CRP (and higher HDL-C\nand lower triglycerides, which are not discussed further). The race\nestimate for each of respective biomarkers was attenuated by 24,\n14, 23, and 13%, respectively, when adjusting for sleep time, and\nficiency. Sex-stratified models also showed that racial health dif-\nferences and the explanatory role of sleep were driven by the\nfemale subsample (see Table S4). In particular, relative to EA\nwomen, AA women had larger waist circumference and greater\nsystolic and diastolic blood pressure, HbA1c\n, HOMA-IR, and\n19, 30, and 22%, respectively, when adjusting for sleep efficiency.\nDiscussion\nReducing racial/ethnic health disparities is highlighted as one of\nthe four overarching goals in Healthy People 2020 (3). Given that\n40% of the gap in premature mortality between AAs and EAs\n(and more than 50% of the gap between AA and EA females)\nstems from cardiovascular and metabolic conditions, improving\nthe CMB health of AAs is an important step toward greater\nhealth equity (28). Sleep represents one potential intervention\npoint (9, 10), but the relative influence of sleep on racial dif-\nferences in CMB conditions is largely unknown. In a sample of\nmiddle-aged and older adults, we find support for the notion that\ndifferences in habitual sleep contribute to the unequal burden of\nCMB disease risk. In particular, after adjusting for sociodemo-\ngraphics and health behaviors, sleep time and sleep efficiency\naccounted for 41% and 58% of the AA\u00adEA gap in CMB risk\nscores, respectively. Path analysis allowed for the simultaneous\nconsideration of the sleep mediator and CMB outcome--each of\nwhich was adjusted for sociodemographics--and a formal test of\nmediation.\nThese findings are consistent with previous investigations of\nsleep as a mediator of race differences in blood pressure (16, 21,\n29). Specifically, using data from the Coronary Artery Risk\nDevelopment in Young Adults Study, actigraph-assessed sleep\ntime mediated AA\u00adEA differences in diastolic blood pressure\nchange over a 5-y period (16). In a population-based cohort in\nChicago, actigraph-assessed sleep maintenance, but not sleep\nduration, was associated with hypertension and explained 11%\nof the AA\u00adEA difference in prevalence (29). Another study of\nmiddle-aged adults in the Southeast reported that lower sleep\nquality explained, in part, differences between AAs and EAs in\nnocturnal blood pressure dipping (21). In contrast, a study using\ndata from the male subsample of the Boston Area Community\nHealth Survey did not find evidence of short sleep duration\n(5 h) to be a mediator of racial disparities in 5-y self-reported\nhypertension incidence (20), but analyses were tested only for\nmales and were limited by a dichotomous self-report sleep-\nduration variable. Thus, extant evidence suggests that sleep\nproblems contribute to racial differences in hypertension; this\nstudy adds evidence regarding their influence on racial differ-\nences in the risk for CMB disease more broadly.\nWhen examining findings by biological sex, sleep indicators\nwere associated with CMB risk among females but not males\n(see Table S5 for results among male sample), and sleep also\nexplained a substantial portion of the race differences in CMB\nrisk among females. The sex moderation of the sleep\u00adhealth\nassociation is consistent with prior research documenting in-\nsufficient sleep as a risk factor for larger waist circumference,\nhypertension, and elevated inflammatory markers among fe-\nmales but not among males (30\u00ad32). However, given the small\nsample of AA males, the current dataset was able to offer only\npreliminary support for sex differences in the extent to which\nsleep explained racial differences in CMB risk. Additional re-\nsearch is needed to determine whether differences in sleep lead\nto elevated CMB morbidity among AA males relative to EA\nmales, and, if so, to elucidate the mechanisms underlying sex\ndifferences in associations between sleep and physical health.\nExamining individual biomarkers, we also found broad sup-\nport for the role of sleep as an explanation of CMB risk. Spe-\ncifically, relative to EAs, AA females had greater dysregulation\nin each of the six expected CMB markers, and these differences\nwere attenuated by 8\u00ad29% when adjusting for sleep time and by\n19\u00ad30% when adjusting for sleep efficiency. These findings are\nconsistent with one study that tested associations between sleep\nand allostatic load (indexed by seven physiologic systems). When\nTable 3.

Specifically, sleep has been ro-\nbustly associated with exposure to social stress (34). Moreover,\nhousehold and area-level socioeconomic conditions and experi-\nences of discrimination help explain a portion of racial sleep\ndifferences (35, 36). Insufficient sleep therefore represents a\nplausible biobehavioral pathway through which disproportionate\nexposure to social and economic adversity leads to diverging\nhealth trajectories between AAs and EAs. Future studies will\nneed to integrate research on stress exposure and sleep as they\nrelate to a broad variety of racial and socioeconomic inequities in\nhealth and well-being. Furthermore, initiatives to reduce racial\nhealth disparities will need to consider the costs and benefits of\nvarying points of intervention (e.g., upstream social determi-\nnants vs. sleep). Evidence-based sleep interventions could target\nAA communities and, if successful, could serve to reduce dis-\nparities in physical health, socioeconomic factors, and well-being\nThe use of sleep actigraphy is one strength of the present\nstudy. One recent review found that AA\u00adEA differences in sleep\ntime were larger when assessed objectively relative to self-reports\n(13), so that objective assessments may be key in research on\nracial sleep differences. Racial differences in the bias of sleep\nself-reports has also been documented, leading to an un-\nderestimation of differences (39). Further, findings considering\nracial differences in the association between sleep and CMB\noutcomes vary by the sleep assessment methodology. Namely,\nsome research has shown that self-reported short duration is\nassociated with blood pressure and diabetes to a larger degree\namong AAs than among EAs (19, 40), whereas one study and the\npresent research found no racial differences in the link between\nactigraph-assessed sleep duration and cardiovascular markers\n(16). Polysomnography is also vital because it measures sleep\narchitecture and has an advantage over actigraphy in detecting\nwakefulness (41). However, actigraphy is a more feasible means\nof measuring multiple nights of sleep and has significant cost\nadvantages that are important in epidemiologic studies.\nAn additional strength of this study relates to our conceptu-\nalization of CMB risk and the utilization of several key bio-\nmarkers that predict subsequent cardiovascular and metabolic\ndisease. One advantage of multisystem indexes of dysregulation\nis that the biological pathways from risk factors to disease may\nvary across individuals (42). Although other multisystem indexes\nhave included a broader range of biomarkers relevant to aging,\nour focus was on the biomarkers of CMB risk because of their\nrelevance to racial disparities in premature mortality and the\nestablished associations between sleep and many of the individ-\nual biomarkers. Further description of the strengths of our CMB\nrisk index is found in Supporting Information.\nSeveral study limitations are also important to note. Analyses\nused cross-sectional data, and therefore no conclusions could be\ndrawn about temporal ordering. In particular, low sleep efficiency\nand insufficient sleep may result from health conditions, particu-\nlarly among older adults (43). However, when participants with\nheart disease or diabetes were excluded, racial differences in CMB\nrisk continued to be explained by sleep time and sleep efficiency.\nMoving forward, longitudinal data will be critical to demonstrate\nthe long-term effects of habitual sleep problems.\nThe possibility of residual confounding, resulting from im-\nprecise controls and lack of consideration of all third-variable\nexplanations, also needs to be acknowledged. Specifically, although\nwe adjusted for coarse indicators of diet and physical activity, de-\ntailed measures are needed to remove their influence on sleep fully.\nSimilarly, in addition to controlling for education and income,\nsubsequent research must elucidate the interdependence of a broad\nvariety of socioeconomic factors and sleep as they relate to racial\ndifferences in health. Two additional analyses also were conducted\nto reduce the possibility of age and sleep disorders as confounding\nvariables; these analyses are described in Supporting Information\nand are discussed here only briefly. First, given that normative\nchanges in sleep and CMB functioning occur with aging, we tested\nand found no evidence of age as a moderator of the link between\nsleep and CMB risk. Second, we excluded participants with chronic\nsleep problems and found an identical pattern of results.\nGeneralizability is limited because the EA subsample was\nprimarily from the Midwest and the AA subsample was from\nMilwaukee. Milwaukee suffers from hypersegregation (extreme\nsegregation across several indicators) and adverse economic\nconditions (44), so that racial differences in heath could be larger\nthan would be found in other contexts. Nonetheless, the majority\nof AAs in the Midwest reside in industrial cities that are segre-\ngated and have been adversely affected by changes in the\neconomy resulting in the loss of manufacturing jobs (45). Thus,\nthe sample offers an important context to consider sleep as a\nbehavioral pathway through which an historically disadvantaged\nracial group may develop elevated CMB disease risk.\nConclusions\nThe results from the present study highlight the importance of\neliminating racial differences in sleep as part of efforts to reduce\nracial health disparities. Importantly, sleep is a malleable be-\nhavior that can be improved through behavioral and educational\ninterventions to influence physical health (38). Further, despite\nlimited information regarding nonclinical samples, sleep in-\nterventions have been shown to be cost-effective (37, 46).\nThus, recent public health initiatives that include monitoring\nsleep behaviors and society-wide messaging about adequate\nsleep duration and sleep hygiene represent important progress\nMethods\nParticipants. Data for the analyses were derived from a sleep substudy that\nwas part of the second wave of the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS II)\nStudy (49). MIDUS began in 1995 as a nationally representative survey of\nmore than 7,000 noninstitutionalized adults. Approximately 75% of surviv-\ning respondents of the first wave participated in MIDUS II, 9\u00ad10 y later. As\npart of this new data collection, a subsample of respondents participated in\nclinic-based (overnight) biomarker data collection at one of three sites (Los\nAngeles; Madison, WI; and Washington, DC). Details of the biomarker\nsample and measures are provided elsewhere (49). Data are publicly avail-\nable at https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/studies/29282. To increase\nthe participation of AAs in biomarker data collection, a new oversample from\nMilwaukee (n = 592) was also recruited. MIDUS staff made travel arrange-\nments and covered travel-related costs to ensure maximum participation in\nthis portion of the study.\nWe included only participants from the Madison, WI site, which drew\nprimarily on respondents from the Midwest region and Milwaukee, because\nthey were invited to participate in a home-based week-long sleep substudy. A\ntotal of 441 adults (83% of the Madison biomarker sample) participated.\nBecause of our focus on AA and EA adults, 15 individuals categorized as\nother racial/ethnic groups were excluded. Data collection was approved\nby the University of Wisconsin-Madison Institutional Review Board, and all\nparticipants provided written, informed consent.\nMeasures.\nCMB risk. Cardiovascular and diabetes risk can be quantified from markers of\nabdominal adiposity, dyslipidemia, glucose metabolism, blood pressure, and\nsystemic inflammation (50\u00ad52). These risk markers also cluster together to\nindicate a general state of CMB dysregulation. For the present study, CMB\ndisease risk was indexed using clinical or recommended risk cut points for\nseven biomarkers: waist circumference, HOMA-IR, HbA1c\n, blood pressure,\nCRP, triglycerides, and low HDL levels. This measure of CMB risk includes\nindicators of metabolic syndrome and two additional biomarkers (HOMA-IR\nand CRP) that add incremental validity in the prediction of cardiovascular\ndisease (50, 53). Ideal (coded 0), borderline high (coded 1), and high (coded\n2) levels for each marker were selected primarily based on recommendations\nfrom the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III\n(NCEP ATP III) and the American Heart Association (AHA) (23\u00ad25). Scores\n(0\u00ad2) for each of the seven biomarkers were averaged to create an overall\nindex of CMB risk. Detailed descriptions of blood collection and processing\nprocedures and information about biomarker assays and other assessments\nhave been reported previously (54) and are reviewed briefly below. A\nfurther description of the advantages of our CMB risk index is given in\nSupporting Information.\nWaist circumference. Waist circumference at the minimal girth was mea-\nsured by trained nurses according to a standardized protocol (32). Waist\ncircumference risk categories were chosen according to AHA guidelines (25).\nBlood pressure. Blood pressure was measured in triplicate according to\nstandardized procedures, and the second and third measurements were\naveraged (54). Prehypertension and hypertension were coded if either sys-\ntolic or diastolic blood pressure levels met Joint National Committee on\nPrevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure\n(JNC-VII) criteria (23). The use of antihypertensives was also coded as hy-\npertension (i.e., given a value of 2).\nGlucose metabolism. Fasting blood samples were collected in the morning\nof the second day of the laboratory visit. Glucose was assessed using an\nenzymatic assay, performed on an automated analyzer (Roche Modular\nAnalytics P), and insulin was measured using a two-site sandwich immu-\nnoassay using direct chemiluminescent technology on a Siemens ADVIA\nCentaur analyzer (54). Insulin resistance was computed using the original\nhomeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA1-IR) equation:\nHOMA1-IR = fasting glucose (mmol/L) \u00d7 fasting insulin (mU/L)/22.5 (55).\nThe HOMA1-IR is an acceptable method for considering between-group\ndifferences and relative change in insulin resistance but not absolute levels\nof insulin resistance, because the original HOMA model was calibrated on\nassays that were no longer in use at the time of the study (56). Recom-\nmendations for clinical cut points for HOMA-IR are also varied (57), and\ntherefore insulin resistance tertiles were used to indicate risk levels. Pre-\ndiabetes/diabetes was indexed using HbA1c\n, a measure of blood glucose over\nthe past few months, according to recommended cutoffs (58). HbA1c\nwas mea-\nsured from whole-blood samples using a Cobas Integra analyzer (Roche\nTriglycerides and HDL-C. Concentrations of triglycerides and HDL-C were\nmeasured using a Cobas Integra analyzer (Roche Diagnostics) (54). The use of\nlipid-modifying medications was coded as high levels of triglycerides (high-\nrisk category).\nCRP. CRP levels were measured using a high-sensitivity assay performed on\na BN II nephelometer (Dade Behring) (54). Borderline and high CRP levels\nwere coded according to previous recommendations (59).\nSleep minutes and sleep efficiency. Sleep characteristics were measured using\nwrist actigraphy and sleep logs. Detailed procedures relating to the collection\nand processing of actigraphy data are available at www.midus.wisc.edu/midus2/\nproject4/ and are summarized herein. At the biomarker visit participants re-\nceived a Mini-Mitter Actiwatch-64 activity monitor (Respironics, Inc.) that\nwas to be worn continuously for 7 d and nights. Physical activity counts were\ncollected in 30-s epochs during the week-long period, and periods of\nintended sleep were then demarcated in the actigraphy data using bedtimes\nand rise times reported on sleep logs. Epochs were scored as wake or sleep\nusing Actiware Software (version 5.0) (Respironics, Inc.) based on a medium\nTotal sleep time was measured as the number of minutes coded as asleep\nbetween sleep onset and rise time, and sleep efficiency was measured as the\npercentage of epochs coded as asleep from bedtime to rise time. All par-\nticipants had at least three nights of actigraphy data, with nearly all (96%)\nhaving at least six nights. In the present analyses, daily sleep parameters were\naveraged across all nights of available data to compute sleep-related out-\ncomes; total sleep time and sleep efficiency showed high internal consistency\n( = 0.85 and  = 0.91, respectively). Sleep time and sleep efficiency were\nstrongly correlated (r = 0.62) and therefore were initially considered sepa-\nrately in mediation analyses. Actigraph-assessed sleep time and sleep effi-\nciency show good correspondence with polysomnography in community\nsamples and with the device used in the present study (22, 60).\nSociodemographic covariates. Biological sex, age (in years), and relationship\nstatus (married or cohabiting = 1, otherwise = 0) were included as de-\nmographic covariates. Total household income was measured using several\nitems assessing wages, pension, social security, and government assistance\nfor all household members. The participant's educational attainment was\ncoded into dummy variables representing high school degree or less (ref-\nerence category), some college attendance, and a 4-y college degree or\ngreater. All models were adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics.\nMental health and health behaviors. Depressive symptoms were assessed\nusing the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, a widely used\nand well-validated measure (61). One item measuring restless sleep was\nremoved from the computation of the total score to reduce conflation be-\ntween sleep and depression, and the revised scale had high reliability ( =\n0.89). Habits relating to physical activity, diet, and cigarette smoking were\nalso assessed (36, 62). Physical activity was reported on nightly sleep logs by\nthe answer to the question \"How many minutes of moderate or vigorous\nexercise did you get today?\" The average of all available reports across the\n7 d was used. Despite this single item being a coarse indicator of physical\nactivity, the short recall and repeated measurements are considerable\nstrengths that improve the validity of the item (63). Fast-food consumption\nwas selected as an index of a putative unhealthy dietary habit (64) and was\ncoded in three dummy variables: no consumption (referent), less than once\nper week, and once a week or more. The frequency of fast-food consump-\ntion is positively associated with high-fat, high-sugar diets and is inversely\nassociated with the intake of whole grains, fruits and vegetables, and fiber\n(64). Single-item reports of the frequency of fast-food consumption also\ncorrespond closely with typical fast-food items measured using detailed\nmonth-long diet histories (64). Smoker status was coded as a dummy vari-\nable representing current smoking activity.\nPrevious heart disease. Participants reported if a doctor had previously\nsuspected or confirmed a \"heart trouble\" and recalled the diagnosis, broadly\ncategorized as myocardial infarction, angina, valve disease, hole in heart,\nblocked artery, arrhythmia, heart murmur, or heart failure.\nAnalysis Plan. Descriptive statistics were examined by race, and unadjusted\ndifferences between AAs and EAs were tested using independent-samples\nt tests and 2 tests. Linear regression and path models were used to test\nstudy hypotheses. An initial regression model estimated racial differences in\ntotal sleep time and sleep efficiency, adjusting for sex, age, relationship\nstatus, education, and household income. A series of regression models\nthen was estimated to examine racial differences in CMB risk and the role of\nsleep indicators as mediating variables. In Model 1, differences in CMB dis-\nease risk between AAs and EAs were estimated after adjusting for socio-\ndemographics. Model 2 then added health behaviors and mental health--\nspecifically, diet, physical activity, cigarette smoking, and depression--as\nadditional covariates. Two additional models were fit in which total sleep\ntime (Model 3) and sleep efficiency (Model 4) were added, in turn, as pre-\ndictors of CMB risk. Mediation was tested in path models in which each sleep\nindicator was simultaneously modeled as a mediator predicted by race (and\nsociodemographics) and as a predictor of CMB risk. The indirect effect of\nrace on CMB risk via each sleep indicator was estimated using the product of\ncoefficients method with bias-corrected confidence intervals (65), and the\nproportion of the race difference in CMB risk explained was calculated to\nindicate the effect size. Modeling indirect effects using path models is a\nwidely used test of mediation that allows simultaneous controls on both the\nmediator and outcome variable. Further, indirect effects are easily inter-\npreted--the estimate is in the units of the direct effect (in our case, the\nindirect effect indicates the absolute value of the racial gap in CMB risk\nexplained by the sleep mediator). Study hypotheses were tested using Mplus\n7.11 (66). Missing data were handled using full information maximum like-\nlihood, a common estimation technique that uses all available data and al-\nlows a consistent sample size across models. Only 2.6% of participants had\nmissing data for physical activity, and all other covariates had less than 1%\nmissing data.\nA few sensitivity analyses were also conducted. Given that some studies\nhave shown associations between short sleep duration and CMB risk to vary\nby demographic factors (19, 40), race, age, and sex were tested as moder-\nators of the link between sleep and CMB risk. The series of models described\nabove was also fit among samples that were stratified by sex to determine if\nmediation findings were present for both male and female subsamples. In\naddition, because both short and long sleep duration are correlates of\nnegative health outcomes, each of which is more common among AAs (12),\nlinear and nonlinear associations between sleep minutes and CMB risk were\nestimated (i.e., sleep minutes squared was included as predictor). Further-\nmore, to reduce the likelihood of reverse causality, we fit models in which\nwe excluded participants with heart disease or diabetes. Last, mediation\nmodels were fit among participants who reported no experience of chronic\nsleeping problems.\n"
