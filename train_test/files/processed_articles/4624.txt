Theories of embodiment and\nlived experience conceptualize the individual with RA as an\nactive agent who routinely makes sense of themselves and\ntheir condition within the context of their everyday lives\n(Burr, 2003). This engagement with the subjective disrupts\nthe \"objective medical gaze\" and repositions the individual\nas a key \"player\" in the meaningful renegotiation of \"who\nthey are\" and \"what they do\"(Christiansen, 1999; G.\nWilliams, 1984). Within this framing, the individual with RA\nis no longer subsumed by the physical impairment (Goodley,\nDrawing on disability studies and its intersections with\npostmodernism, allied health professionals and social\nresearchers influenced by this philosophical shift have reori-\nented their practice from an understanding of the body as\nimpaired, to that of the body as \"irreducible to impairment\"\n(Hall, 2011, p. 1). This critical understanding challenges the\nfocus on the \"disabled body\" and instead (re)presents dis-\nability as \"the space from which to think through a host of\npolitical, theoretical and practical issues that are relevant to\nperson-centered approach in which the client's voice and\nexperience is privileged (Alsaker & Josephsson, 2003;\nMacDonald, 2008). The emphasis on the \"client's\" voice\nresonates with postmodernism's valuing of both \"situated\"\nvital to personal empowerment. This situated knowing is\nalso, as MacDonald (2008) suggests, integral to the collec-\ntive empowerment of people living with chronic illnesses\nsuch as RA and the understandings of the broader commu-\nnity; the \"experiences/stories of people with (dis)Abilities\nand sufferers of chronic pain need to be welcomed into the\ndiscourse on chronic pain, a discourse that has been predom-\ninately occupied by biomedicine\" (p. 138).\nWithin this broader framing, allied health professionals\nrelinquish traditional concepts of adaptation and adjustment\nwhich draw on normative assumptions of disability and ability.\nWithin a multifaceted understanding of RA, the professional\u00ad\nclient relationship is informed by and \"adapted to the everyday\nrealities of individual's lives\" (Plach, Stevens, & Moss, 2004,\np. 138).

However, as consumer research consistently reports, spe-\ncialist wait times in combination with the short duration of\nappointments mean that \"there was never the time to talk about\nanything other than the physical symptoms\" (Brand, Claydon-\nreport, \"Important topics that caused anxiety, such as the long-\nterm impact of RA and prognosis, were reported to be inade-\nquately discussed\" (p. 79).\nEngaging with the theory and practice of these under-\nstandings within the context of this study allows for a new\nexploration of the everyday negotiations and adaptations of\neight women living with early-diagnosed RA. The women's\naccounts provide a nuanced understanding of RA and its dis-\nruptive effects within their physical, emotional, and social\nlives. The emphasis on \"normalcy,\" the impact of uncer-\ntainty, the focus on the body, and the contentions relating to\nadaption and adaptation provide examples of the multifac-\neted approach taken by the women to remake themselves. In\ndescribing these processes, the women narrate their social\nand emotional experiences of \"adapting\" to RA, their nego-\ntiations of the negative thoughts threatening to overwhelm,\nand the energy required to \"keep positive.\" The women's\naccounts are also a reminder of the deeply felt impacts of RA\nmaking it a \"less `liveable' condition\" than other chronic ill-\nLiterature Review\nClinical Description\nRA is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting 0.5% to 1.0%\nof adults in developed countries and is three times more fre-\nquent in women than men (Scott, Wolfe, & Huizinga, 2010).\nPrevalence rises with age and is highest in women older than\n65 years, suggesting hormonal factors could play a role\n(Scott et\n(Neovius, Simard, Askling, & ARTIS Study Group, 2011).\nPatients are diagnosed across all ages and the mean inci-\ndence ages vary between 56 and 58 years (Thyberg,\nDahlstr\u00f6m, Bj\u00f6rk, Arvidsson, & Thyberg, 2012; Verstappen\n& Symmons, 2011). The introduction and use of pharmaco-\nlogical treatments in the early stages of the condition in com-\nbination with new biological drugs have led to reduced\ndisease activity and less disability (Scott etal., 2010; Sverker\netal., 2015). However, RA is still associated with disabilities\nand reduced quality of life (S\u00f6derlin, Lindroth, & Jacobsson,\n2010). Women in particular are identified as experiencing\nhigher disease activity and pain and more difficulties in per-\nforming daily activities than their male counterparts\n(Ahistrand, Bjork, Thyberg, Borsbo, & Falkmer, 2012;\nChronic Illness as Disruption\nIn his research exploring people's experiences of RA, Bury\n(1982) makes the following statement: \"My contention is\nthat illness, and especially chronic illness, is precisely that\nkind of experience where the structures of everyday life and\nthe forms of knowledge which underpin them are disrupted\"\n(p. 169). This notion of disruption is emphasized in Scambler\nand Scambler (2010) who interpreted chronic illnesses as\n\"assaults on the lifeworld.\" As an assault, chronic illness is a\njarring intrusion within the context of people's private and\npublic lives, it is uninvited and unwelcome (Nyman & Lund,\n2007). The presumed assumptions that assist in directing\neveryday life to ensure that it is predictable and certain are no\nlonger appropriate, relevant, or useful (S. Williams, 2000).\nThe tacit knowledge that allowed mastery within the every-\nday life is suddenly irrelevant and meaningless (Bury, 1982;\nS. Williams, 2000). Activities, roles, and functions that struc-\ntured everyday life and shaped people's perceptions of them-\nselves and their relationships with others were in disarray\n(Iaquinta & Larrabee, 2004). The disruption to the perfor-\nmance of activities done routinely could engender feelings of\nanger, fear, frustration, self-consciousness, and depression\n(Alsaker & Josephsson, 2003). While such emotions can be\n\"healthy\" within processes of renegotiation, longer term\nexperiences are generally detrimental to the person's self-\nconcept and relationships with others (Iaquinta & Larrabee,\nUncertainty\nUncertainty and unpredictability are common features in the\nexperience of chronic conditions such as RA. While uncer-\ntainty is often referred to in the context of the physiological\nmanifestations of RA, its definition and implications are far\nwider. As is documented across the research literature on\nRA, uncertainty plays a key role in shaping a person's every-\nday understandings and experiences (Bury, 1982; Flurey\net\nal., 2014; L\u00f6\u00f6f, Johansson, Henriksson, Lindblad, &\nprovides an introduction to the uncertain realities of people\nliving with RA. Wiener's research linked uncertainty to\nsocial and psychological well-being and described the psy-\ncho-social strategies people adopted \"when uncertainty is\nexaggerated beyond the usual level of toleration\" (p. 97).\nWiener locates uncertainty as inherent within the physiologi-\ncal impacts brought on by RA, including flares, and the\nBarns et al. 3\ngeneral interruption/disruption to everyday life. Coventry,\nDickens, and Todd (2014) also highlight the pervasiveness of\nuncertainty in the RA experience describing their research\nparticipants as living \"in a perpetual state of uncertainty\"\nful mediator of people's constructions of an embodied self.\nUncertainty could engender a range of emotional and psy-\nchological responses including feelings of fear, dread, and\nfrustration (Coventry etal., 2014); anger and helplessness\n(L\u00f6\u00f6f etal., 2014); and outcomes of depression and anxiety\n(Flurey etal., 2014). For Wiener's participants (and as is rec-\nognized in more recent research), a return to \"normal\" life\nand functioning underpins the strategies they developed and\nadopted; \"success\" is achieved when a person feels they can\n\"tolerate\" the uncertainty and unpredictability of RA on any\nparticular day or hour.\nBodily Experience\nWithin disability studies, \"the body\" has been and continues\nto be constructed and reconstructed according to shifts in dis-\ncourse and power. Goodley's (2012) overview of disability\nstudies draws attention to the \"role\" of the body within con-\nceptualizations of impairment and disability. Traditional\nframings of the body as a site of impairment were challenged\nby sociological analyses in which \"having an impaired body\nseparation between the biological (physical) and the social\nwas problematized by people whose lived experience of\nimpairment--the physical and/or biological constraints--\nshaped and informed the meanings they made of themselves\ncates of feminist disability studies supported the notion that\nthe \"impaired body had been neglected\" (Crow, 1996;\nof impairment moved from \"specific forms, functions and\nbehaviours\" to an engagement with corporeality and the\n\"intricate relation between bodies and selves\" (Garland-\nnist disability activists including Inckle (2014) engage with\nthe notion of \"disabled embodiment\": \"a dynamic, lived\nposition that intersects mind, body, emotion, social, self and\nother, and operationalises new and challenging forms of rep-\nresentation and articulation\" (p. 389). Both corporeality and\nembodiment speak to the complex realities of many women\nliving with chronic illness such as RA, whose social and\nemotional well-being alongside their personal and public\nselves are routinely shaped by the physicality of their condi-\ntion (Ahistrand etal., 2012; Dubouloz, Laporte, Hall, Ashe,\nThe notions of embodiment and corporeality also\nacknowledge the body as gendered. For feminist disability\nadvocates, this facilitates the \"interrogation\" of patriarchal\nscripts of femininity and in particular, constructions of the\n\"ideal female body\" (Inckle, 2014). As is clearly identified\nwithin feminist disability studies, women with a disability\nare not immune to these dominant constructions and the\nbroader discourse relating to what Garland-Thomson (2005)\ndescribes as the \"politics of appearance\" (p. 1559). The rigid\ndescriptions of how and what women \"should be\" reinforce\nthe traditional binaries between the normal/abnormal, abled/\ndisabled, and desirable/undesirable. As Peuravaara (2013)\nexplains, \"Conceptions of bodily normality constantly exist\nas a `measuring stick' . . . as a woman . . . you are never `free\nfrom' images of bodily normality\" (p. 412). As Shildrick\nthe idealized female body, nor is it considered as constitutive\nof an active sexual subjectivity. Within these interpretations,\nthe disfiguring and disabling effects brought on by RA posi-\ntion women as the \"Other\" both in terms of femininity and\nsexual agency (Plach et\nOpportunities for Transformation\nOpportunities for renegotiating relationships with others or\nlearning different ways of performing activities can provide\nspaces for people with RA to \"assess and expand their con-\nstruction of themselves and their illness and . . . search for\ndiscovery of other ways of \"being in the world\" can be\nepiphanic leading to what G. Williams (1984) describes as a\nprocess of \"narrative reconstruction.\" This process of re-sto-\nrying can be empowering and emancipatory, providing alter-\nnate understandings of self and the roles assumed in private\nand public life (Plach et\nal.'s\n(2004) re-storying is an example of the type of transforma-\ntive learning, possible for people experiencing chronic ill-\nness. Similar to Carel's (2007) theorization of RA as\ntransformative, it is proposed that the disruptive nature of\nRA within people's everyday performance of activities and\ntasks can be mediated by a \"transformative\" shift in the per-\nson's meanings, values, and knowledge. Through a process\nof critical reflection, involving the deconstruction and recon-\nstruction of previous life stories, a new identity can be\nformed allowing the person to achieve the balance necessary\nfor maintaining health and well-being (Carel, 2007; Dubouloz\netal., 2004). It is important, however, to recognize that such\ntransformations and reconstructions occur within a broader\npolitical and social context.\nNegotiating Assumptions Within the Social\nContext\nThe bodily experience or corporeality of RA intersects with\ndominant constructions of disability (Thomas, 2007). While\ncontemporary understandings of disability have challenged\nboth the primacy and authority of medicalized discourses,\ndeficit-oriented subjectivities continue to be imposed upon\npeople living with chronic illness (Goodley, 2012; Snyder &\n4 SAGE Open\nratives \"manufactured by charities, science and popular cul-\nture\" through which disability is defined as a \"personal\ntragedy, biological deficiency and psychical trauma\" (p. 3).\nWithin these scripts, the person becomes and/or is consumed\nby the physical; meaningful engagement with the broader\nsocial, economic, political, and cultural context is discounted.\nAccording to Goodley, such narratives \"dis-locate disabled\npeople\" (italics in original) both in materialist and cultural\nterms (p. 3). Snyder and Mitchell (2006) agree, identifying\n\"social erasure\" as a possible outcome of these public narra-\ntives; \"disabled citizens are forced to exchange their liberty\nfor necessary (and unnecessary) social supports\" (p. 19).\nThomas (2007) concurs, describing the social exclusion and\nrestrictive citizenship produced through the dominant narra-\ntive as \"a form of social oppression involving the social\nimposition of restrictions on people with impairments and\nthe socially engendered undermining of psycho-emotional\nwell-being\" (p. 73).\nNegotiating the Everyday\nTraditional understandings of adaptation emphasize the per-\nson's capacity to function and perform activities and roles\nwithin their everyday lives (Reinseth & Espnes, 2007).\nNegotiating the challenges of living with RA can be a physi-\ncally and emotionally exhausting process whereby function-\ning and performance can become measures of personal\ndefeat and bodily deficit. Kelly and Field (1996) describe the\nimpact of such traditional interventions in their narrative\nresearch with people experiencing fibromyalgia: \"The symp-\ntoms have taken over the person's life creating a problem-\nsaturated life story in which other elements of the life are\nignored\" (p. 266).According to research by Schulman-Green\net\nal. (2012), narrow conceptualizations of adaptation are\nproblematic in their focus on the functional and physical\naspects of people's experiences, marginalizing the \"impor-\ntance of emotional and existential processes, such as recon-\nciling emotions and deriving meaning from the illness\nexperience\" (p. 137). Thus, adaptation becomes a process\nwhich facilitates people's capacities to respond meaningfully\nto challenges and achieve a state of well-being through their\neveryday activities.\nTheoretical Framings, Methodology,\nand Methods\nThis research sought to explore women's experiences of\nliving with RA, with a particular focus on their engage-\nment with everyday activities and roles. In undertaking\nthis exploration, the researchers adopted a qualitative\nmethodology and postmodern framings relating to subjec-\ntivity and context. As a condition that predominantly\naffects women the researchers were cognizant of the inter-\nsections between gendered subjectivities and everyday\npractices (Olesen, 2011). The focus on understanding the\nsubjective experiences of women with RA resonates with\nthe postmodern framing of the person as an active meaning\nmaker who, through their interactions with others, rou-\ntinely construct and reconstruct understandings of their\nself(ves) and their realities (Burr, 2003). These under-\nstandings are fluid and dynamic, responsive to new infor-\nmation and environments. This impermanency produces\nthe capacity for change: a poignant factor in this study of\nwomen whose everyday lives demanded ongoing change\n(Lempp, Scott, & Kingsley, 2006). In exploring women's\nlived experiences of RA, the findings of this research con-\ntribute to the broader shift in research by documenting the\nexperiences of the \"viewpoint of `insiders' who live with\nRA day in and day out over decades of their lives\" (Plach\net\nresearchers attempt \"to make sense of, or to interpret, phe-\nnomena in terms of the meanings people bring to them\"\nSetting\nThe eight women who participated in this research were\nrecruited from the prospective multicenter research project\nEarly Interventions in RA (Swedish acronym TIRA). The\nTIRA project aimed to establish clinical routines for early\nRA diagnosis and early multiprofessional interventions. A\ndatabase for research was also established (Thyberg etal.,\nSelection in the broader TIRA-1 cohort was based on gen-\nder (being female), age, living with RA, and, for practical\nreasons, resident in Link\u00f6ping, Sweden. For this research\nproject, a purposive sampling framework was used to iden-\ntify potential participants: women who were under the age\nof 40 years and living with a diagnosis of RA. From the\nTIRA client records, 13 women were identified as potential\nparticipants for the study. An introductory letter that\nincluded participant information was mailed to each of the\npotential participants. A follow-up phone call was made 1\nweek later by the researchers with the aim of responding to\nany questions the potential participants might have and to\nascertain participation. Of the 13 women invited to partici-\npate, three women declined citing reasons of being \"too\nbusy\" and two were \"not having any symptoms.\" Eight\nwomen agreed to participate in the research. While aware\nthat eight participants was a small sample, a larger sample\nwould have required recruiting women from the middle-\nage bracket and changing the aim of the study. The local\nethics committees of all the participating units in Link\u00f6ping,\nV\u00e4stervik, and Norrk\u00f6ping approved the studies prior to\ndata collection and ethics approval was given (Approval\nnumber 96035), and each of the participants gave their\nwritten informed consent. The interviews were performed\nduring the women's 5- and 7-year follow-ups in the TIRA\nstudy.\nBarns et al. 5\nIntroducing the Participants\nThe eight women interviewed for this research were aged\nidentifies each participant by pseudonym (used in the find-\nings and discussion), alongside her age, employment status,\nand family context. All the women were employed full-time,\nwith one woman on maternity leave. Six of the women iden-\ntified that they had partners. At the time of the research, one\nwoman was pregnant and the remaining seven women had\nchildren aged from babies to teenagers. In the clinical\nappointment prior to the interview, the women completed a\ndisability assessment using the Swedish version of the Health\nAssessment Questionnaire (HAQ) and a pain assessment\nusing the Visual Analogue Scale. The women reported low to\nmoderate scores for both disability and pain.\nData Collection\nIn keeping with the qualitative methodology framing the\nresearch, semistructured interviews were undertaken with\neight participants. Constructed as conversations between the\ninterviewer and participant, the in-depth interviews focused\non exploring the meanings and knowledges made by women\nwith RA as they negotiated their everyday lives (Fontana,\n2001). The use of a conversational approach to interviewing\nenables us to \" . . . know other people, get to learn about their\nexperiences, feelings, hopes and the world they live in\"\n(Kvale, 1996, p. 5). An interview guide (see Table 2) consist-\ning of open-ended questions was developed, drawing on the\nliterature relating to the lived experience of RA and in keep-\ning with the aims of the study. Through this process, two\ngroups of questions were developed as a guide for the inter-\nviews: (a) the meanings women make of their experiences of\nliving with RA and (b) the ways women negotiated the\neveryday realities of living with RA. With an emphasis on\nensuring that the women felt safe and at ease, the interviews\nwere conducted at either the woman's home or the rheuma-\ntology clinic, and at a time that was convenient to each par-\nticipant. The interviews were between 35 and 80 min duration\nand were audiotaped.\nInterpreting the Interviews\nInformed by the postmodern emphasis on \"many ways of\nknowing\" (Denzin & Lincoln, 2005), data analysis was\nundertaken by the interviewer-as-researcher through a pro-\ncess that \"emphasises descriptive nuances, differences and\nwere transcribed verbatim and each interview was subject to\nseveral close readings before any formal interpretation com-\nmenced. These readings facilitated an immersion in the inter-\nview data and, as Green et\ndetailed examination of what is said and stimulates a process\nwhere one begins to `incubate' ideas about the possibilities\nof analysis\" (p. 547). After these initial readings, each inter-\nview was subject to a process which Ely, Vinz, Downing, and\n\"words, sentences or paragraphs containing aspects related\nto each other through their content and context\" (Graneheim\negorized according to their descriptive content and formed\ninto themes, overall understandings of a particular issue,\nidea, or experience.

During analysis of the units,\nthemes and categories emerging from the material were dis-\ncussed by two other members of the research team as a means\nof increasing the credibility and trustworthiness of the mate-\nrial (Graneheim & Lundman, 2004).

Direct\nquotes are a way of reaffirming the relationship between the\nparticipants' stories and the interpretations offered in this\narticle.\nFindings\n\"Being Normal\"\nThe unpredictability of chronic conditions such as RA was\ndescribed by the women in this research as one of the more\ndifficult and frustrating aspects of their experiences. The\ncontinuum of physical symptoms from periods of remission\nto the intense pain and incapacity of flares were a persistent\nreminder of their disability and a barrier to \"being normal.\"\nThe seeming randomness of symptoms and the onset of\nflares could make it difficult, if not impossible, for the\nwomen to participate in the routines of daily life. As one\nwomen lamented, the \"normal\" tasks she performed in car-\ning for her family, such as doing the laundry, cleaning the\nhouse, making dinner and taking care of the children after\nwork, were now both time-consuming and an inefficient use\nof her time and energy; \"you have to slow down all activities.\nIf you had been well, it would have been possible to speed it\nup\" (Kristina) to get things done on time. Plans made ahead\nof time could be made redundant by the onset of pain or\nfatigue. Similarly, for some of the women, the sudden onset\nof symptoms had meant the disappearance of spontaneity\nfrom their lives. In this context, the desire for normalcy, for\n\"being normal,\" was identified by some women as both a\n\"wish\" and a strategy for negotiating the impacts of RA.\nWhile the notion of \"normal\" is contested within the\nbroad landscape of disability studies, the women's descrip-\ntions of \"normal\" can be interpreted as a metaphor for a time\nand space before RA. For some of the women, \"being nor-\nmal\" was related to having control within their daily lives,\nthe capacity to \"do what everyone else does\" (Ingrid), and to\nreturn to \"business as usual\" (Monika). Normal was about\nbeing able to engage with activities and roles previously\ntaken for granted, from going to the gym and exercising like\nother patrons to managing the same assignments as col-\nleagues in the workplace.\nFrom listening to the women's accounts, it was clear that\n\"being normal\" was easier to achieve during periods free\nfrom pain and joint stiffness, when the impacts of the condi-\ntion were minimized. During these times, it was possible to\nengage in everyday activities, roles, and tasks both within the\nhome and at work, without the need for adaptations, such as,\nthe use of assistive aids or supports. Achieving normalcy on\na longer term basis however required a more comprehensive\nstrategy of adjustment. This involved engaging with acces-\nsibility and assistive aids and the ongoing evaluation of the\nmeanings and values of particular activities and roles.\nAdaptions for \"Being Normal\"\nFor many of the women, \"being normal\" required that they\nlearn to minimize the impacts of RA in their everyday lives.\nKey to this was the issue of adaptation. Perhaps because of\nits centrality, adaptation proved to be a contentious and com-\nplex process, embedded within the women's broader under-\nstandings of what it means to be \"normal\" and how \"normal\"\ncould be achieved. While each of the women had made some\nadaptations to the activities and tasks they performed in their\ndaily lives, the type and form of adaptation made was shaped\nby the meanings the women made about RA as a physical,\nemotional, and social experience. Adaptations could also be\ntime specific, adopted within a particular context such as a\nflare and then abandoned after the flare had subsided. These\ntemporary adaptations were key strategies in some of the\nwomen's negotiations of RA, facilitating a return to the \"nor-\nmal\" as soon as was practicable.\nAdaptations that could easily be incorporated into a cur-\nrent routine were regarded as positive: The women provided\nexamples of lifting an item using two hands instead of one,\nplacing heavier objects on a lower shelf in the kitchen, and\nperforming labor-intensive tasks in stages. Seven of the\nwomen identified using disease-modifying anti-rheumatic\ndrugs (DMARDS) as part of their adaptation to RA. These\nmedications are identified as \"key therapeutic agents, reduce\nsynovitis and systemic inflammation and improve function\"\nthe women related to prevention strategies, such as minimiz-\ning the impact of particular activities on the body. While\nacknowledging prevention as an important strategy, one\nwoman described how difficult it was to think about preven-\ntion or as she states, \"sparing my body\" in pain free times;\nThe occupational therapist I met told me to avoid carrying heavy\nbags and to take the trolley when shopping for groceries, but I'm\nthe kind of person that takes a basket and fills it up so much that\nI (can) barely manage to carry it and then, at that point, I think\nit's better for me to use a trolley instead, to save my hands. I try\nto remember her advice but, I want to do it myself and I'm too\nstubborn in that situation, I think. I don't think that much about\nsparing my body. (Monika)\nSome adaptations identified by the women were less tan-\ngible and involved the reshaping of household roles and\nresponsibilities for family members, friends, and/or work col-\nleagues where these parties had been informed. This was par-\nticularly evident in the women's accounts of flare where\nfamily and friends provided practical support in performing\neveryday tasks. In some instances, the need for adaptation led\nBarns et al. 7\nto role changes within the family, with partners, children, and/\nor a parent taking on domestic activities. One woman describes\ncalling on her mother in negotiating care for her baby;\nWhen my first (child) was a baby was the worst time because\nmy partner worked nights so my mum had to come home to\nchange (nappies) at night and things like that. (Anna)\nAmbivalence About Adaptation\nFor some women, adaptation represented a life regulated by\ntheir disability and a threat to \"being normal\" and how they\nconceptualized themselves. These women were ambivalent\nabout their engagement with assistive aids and adaptation\nmore broadly. A number of women described being prepared\nto negotiate pain and discomfort rather than adapt. One wom-\nan's desire to be a \"real mum\" shaped her attitude toward\nadaptation. For this woman, adapting to RA challenged the\nauthenticity of her role as \"mum\"; \"I want to be a real mum. I\nput that before adaption to the disease\" (Brigitta). Another\nwoman described the \"informed choice\" she made in continu-\ning to ski despite knowing the consequences: \"I do what I\nthink is fun . . . I go skiing a lot . . . I know it (RA) will get\nworse in the evenings. I know I will get more pain\" (Mikaela).\nFor some of the women, assistive aids were a symbol of\ntheir disability, an unwelcome reminder of the disabling\nimpacts of RA and their decreasing physical capacity. While\nusing assistive aids in the workplace, one woman described\nher reluctance to use domestic aids, such as a cheese slicer,\nwhich she identified as reinforcing her \"impairment\" and\nthreatening her efforts to be \"normal\":\nIn my job I have pencils with a rough grip, but other things feel, no\ncheese slicers and things make you feel so handicapped, whereas\nin fact you want to try to live as normally as possible. (Kristina)\nSome of the women also identified the risks involved\nwith adaptation. Changes to activities including the way in\nwhich they were performed could change the meaning of the\nactivity and its significance. One woman describes her pre-\nvious participation in taekwondo and aerobics, intensely\nphysical sports which she can no longer undertake. While\nemphasizing the importance of exercise as a way of mediat-\ning her RA, the new activities she had adopted were less\nmeaningful;\nIt is good to exercise when you've got rheumatism. You should\nexercise every day. You can do activities like walking, cycling,\nswimming, but in fact I really find them boring. (Brigitta)\nWho Am I?\nIn their discussions of RA as a lived experience, the women\nreflected on how the physical experiences had shaped their\nunderstandings of \"self\" and of \"self in relation to others.\"\nFor some of the women, their experience of RA had pro-\nfoundly altered their sense of self, as one woman comments,\n\"I'm no longer the kind of person I once was and want to be\"\n(Brigitta). This powerful statement suggests a clear line being\nmade between a pre- and post-RA self, possibly extending to\na future self. Other women used specific adjectives to identify\nthe personal impact of RA, describing themselves as \"more\nnegative\" (Eva), \"boring\" (Brigitta), \"more sulky\" (Maria),\nand \"more bad tempered\" (Kristina). The use of \"more\" in the\nabove phrases again reflects the notion of a pre- and post-RA\nself, with the experience of RA exacerbating their pre-RA\nresponses. Some women described themselves as having\nbecome \"introverted and retiring\" (Brigitta). One woman\ndescribed herself as more negative and sulky, a way of being\nwhich influenced the experiences of other family members:\nYou become more, get a more negative attitude [toward activity]\nyou think it's kind of boring and that also influences everyday\nlife, and other family members also think it's hard, boring.\nMaybe you become more sulky, so to speak, you think it`s a pain\nand then the others also get affected. (Maria)\nThe Body as Self\nThe physicality of RA, the pain, stiffness, and the swelling of\njoints was described by some of the women as shifting the\nbody from the margins of self-concept to the fore. This was\nexpressed in a number of different ways, with some women\nidentifying an emotional distance between themselves and\ntheir bodies particularly during flares. One woman described\nthis separation in terms of \"not belonging with the disease\"\n(Brigitta) and expressed feeling \"like another person in flare\nups.\" Other women spoke of feeling consumed by their bod-\nies. One woman described \"thinking about (her body) all the\ntime,\" especially during physical activities such as walking\nor vacuum cleaning:\nYes I think a lot about my body, for example when I vacuum\nclean. That is almost one of the worst things or when I go for a\nwalk or something, all the time I'm thinking about my arms. I feel\nthat I always worry about it. I think about it all the time. (Maria)\nCreating a Positive Self\nBesides these difficulties, some of the women described pos-\nitive shifts in not only how they understood themselves but\nalso how they engaged with and made sense of others in the\nworld. One woman felt she had become a \"stronger person,\"\nwho \"knew how to handle difficult situations and no longer\ncomplained about minor things\" (Eva). Another woman\nidentified having developed greater empathy for people. For\nthis woman, the experience of RA had broadened her aware-\nness and understanding of other people's experiences:\nActually you become hardy in another way, and then it's easier\nto understand other people too. Maybe they don't understand\n8 SAGE Open\nme, but it becomes easier to feel empathy for others when you\nare feeling bad yourself sometimes. (Anna)\nFor one woman, the use of supports such as assistive aids had\nallowed her to gain control in her everyday life. Instead of per-\nmanently adapting to an activity, this woman would use physi-\ncal aids and ask others for help when she decided she wanted\nsupport. For this woman, RA was not all-defining, rather as\nshe asserts, \"the disease has had to adapt to me a bit\" (Mikaela).\nEmotional Fallout\nThe emotional journeys recounted by the women in this\nresearch highlight the subjective and inherently personal\nimpacts of RA. Feelings of anger, sadness, and frustration\nwere recounted by the women as they negotiated the emo-\ntional fallout from their experiences of living with RA. As\none woman explained, \"Sometimes it was easy to think neg-\native thoughts,\" to question \"why me? This is unfair\"\n(Maria). The women also spoke of their capacity to renegoti-\nate the position of RA in their understandings of self. One\nwoman referred to this capacity as \"putting the problem\nbehind me\" a way of sidelining the impacts. While acknowl-\nedging the difficulties of this process, one woman was ada-\nmant about the need to \"think positive thoughts and try to\nfind possibilities instead of dwelling on the problems\"\n(Anna). Drawing on a similar strategy, another woman spoke\nof her need to keep both her emotional and physical life in\nbalance so that the \"condition did not take over.\"\nSome of the women spoke of coming to terms with their\nexperiences, accepting the circumstances and increasing\ntheir awareness of the possibilities of a life with RA. Some\nwomen also spoke of the importance of learning to be honest\nwith themselves within this process of acceptance: honest\nabout their capacities, about \"lowering demands and setting\nup realistic goals.\" One woman describes as follows:\nYou have to admit to yourself that you can't manage all this, that\nyou can't put too many demands on yourself because then you\njust feel worse. No, my mental adjustment has been to set up\nrealistic goals that I know can be reached, and not say I want to\ndo this and that and then never do it. (Ingrid)\nThis notion of \"learning to live with RA\" referred to the\nconstant evaluation of everyday life, not only in terms of the\ntangible but also about what was meaningful and valuable\nfor each of the women. For many of the women, sharing their\ndiagnosis and the experience of RA with family and/or\nfriends was fraught with competing emotions. Reluctance to\ntalk with family and/or friends about RA was explained by a\ndesire to maintain independence and autonomy, fear of being\ncast in the \"sick role,\" and of not being believed or under-\nstood. For one woman, this reluctance was heightened by her\nexperience of being \"treated with suspicion\" by her work\ncolleagues when she was not able to perform an activity:\n\"That is what is most sad, that people . . . that this is a disease\nthat no one can see and so they don't believe you\" (Anna).\nDiscussion\nRe-Storying the Self and Others\nContemporary explorations of the lived experience of\nchronic conditions such as RA highlight the ways in which\npeople re-author their lives in the context of disability, creat-\ning new ways of understanding themselves and their rela-\ntionships with others (Reeve, Loyd-Williams, Payne,\n& Dowrick, 2010; Rice, Chandler, Harrison, Liddiard, &\nFerrari, 2015; Sanderson, Calnan, Morris, Richards, &\nresearch, each of the women identified moments which\nreflect aspects of Bury's (1982) concept of \"biographical dis-\nruption.\" The lived experience of RA, the fluctuations in\nphysical and emotional capacities, had undermined the\nauthority of the taken for granted assumptions and explana-\ntory frameworks they relied on for a sense of \"self in the\nThe disruption was personal, affecting their understandings\nof self, the meanings they made of the roles, and activities\nand tasks they performed in their immediate and broader\ncontexts. Dubouloz etal.'s (2004) research focusing on the\nmeaning constructions of people with RA reported similar\nfindings, with participants describing experiences of being\n\"redefined by illness\" and an overwhelming sense \"they\ncould not control the illness but were controlled by it\"\ndence suggesting that the unpredictability of RA can create a\nspace of suspense in which people experience an ever-present\nfear of \"getting stuck\" (p. 174). Personal identity and self-\nconcept which had once been stable were now in flux, frag-\nmented, and disjointed; meanings of self in the world were\nsubject to the uncertainty of the condition. There was an\nexpressed desire to return to the known self, \"the person they\nused to be.\" Such sentiments echo with Plach etal.'s (2004)\nresearch with women living with RA, who described them-\nselves as \"out of synch with who they had been . . . [and] . . .\nwith who they had thought they would become in the future\"\nThe concept of biographical disruption although impor-\ntant is not without critique and a closer reading of the wom-\nen's accounts highlights the need for more complex and\nnuanced understandings of living with RA and its \"disrup-\ntive\" effects within everyday life (Reeve et\nContemporary conceptualizations of the self as an embodied\nand active agent challenge the notion of disruption as all-\nconsuming and permanent (S. Williams, 2003), reflecting\nSanderson etal.'s (2011) proposition that \"biographical dis-\nruption may form only one part of a person's multilayered\nThe postmodern understanding of self were fluid and\ndynamic, embedded in context, offers an alternate account to\nthe coherent and stable self, evident within biographical dis-\nruption (Carel, 2007).

Williams, 2000). These negotiations were not\nonly practical in their focus but also often entailed a funda-\nmental rethinking of meanings made and values held.\nSanderson etal. (2011) describe this re-framing of self as a\nform of narrative reconstruction, a process of creating \"points\nof reference between the (changed) body, self and society,\nreconstructing the past so that it has meaning or purpose for\nthe present\" (p. 619). The process is dynamic and open,\nallowing for \"the weaving of \"new symptoms, new knowl-\nedge of the condition, and new reactions from others into the\nSimilarly, contemporary conceptualizations of chronic ill-\nness as an embodied or corporeal experience challenge the\n\"over-emphasis on a cognitive view of the self\" within bio-\nThe relegation of the body to the margins is at odds with the\nlived experience of RA (Reeve etal., 2010; S. Williams &\nBendelow, 1998). The physicality of RA, the fluctuating\nperiods of flare and remission alongside the everyday experi-\nence of joint stiffness and pain means that the body cannot be\nignored or made to \"dis-appear\" (Flurey et\nchanging and unpredictable body \"appropriated\" by RA;\n\"the biological body behaves oddly; it exhibits strange symp-\ntoms and becomes unpredictable. The transparent silent\nfunction of the biological body is gone\" (p. 99). Many of the\nwomen within this research shared their struggles of negoti-\nating their \"different\" bodies, and recalled their efforts, to\ndevelop new and alternate methods for performing the \"nor-\nmal\" routines of everyday life. Adaptations informed by both\nphysical and emotional considerations were developed by\nthe women in an effort to recreate meaningful interactions\nand engagements with everyday life (S. Williams, 2000).\nThese practices reflect Coventry etal.'s (2014) concept of a\n\"bodily consciousness,\" a way of knowing and being that is\nable to respond to and priorities \"the embodied and emo-\ntional work invested in living with illness\" (p. 109).\nNegotiating Normal\nIn recent years, the language of \"normal\" and \"normalcy\"\nwithin disability discourses has been rejected, replaced by\nthe language of ability and capacity (Goodley, 2012). Yet,\nwithin the women's stories of living with RA, one of the key\nthemes arising was their desire to \"be\" or \"remain normal.\"\nDiscussions of the \"normal\" have a long history in the litera-\nture on chronic conditions. In general terms, \"normal\"\ndescribes a life with some certainty and predictability, where\npain and disability do not override participation in the activi-\nties of everyday life (Wiener, 1975, p. 98). For the women in\nthis research, the desire to be \"normal\" was related to a time\nand space before diagnosis, before RA. Wiener's (1975)\ninteractionist research from the mid-1970s identifies the\n\"normal\" as part of people's experiences of RA. In this early\nresearch, Wiener described everyday life for people living\nwith RA as \"a nightmare race . . . a constant competition\"\nbetween two competing domains: the physiological impacts\nof RA and the activities needing to be performed as part of\n\"normal\" everyday life. Uncertainty was generated from not\nknowing which domain would dominate and in what ways\n(Wiener, 1975). Two decades later, Whitley, Beck, and\nthe \"normal\" and the \"certain.\" The \"normal\" was a space\nthat could be controlled, that was certain, stable, and predict-\nable while allowing for positive spontaneity (Whitley etal.,\n1999). For many of the women in this research, the \"normal\"\nwas a space in which the everyday routines, tasks, activities,\nand interactions with others could occur with minimal inter-\nruption from the impacts of RA. Minimal interruption\nencompassed the absence of or reduction in pain and disabil-\nity or the capacity to \"cover-up\" or \"keep out\" the impacts of\nnormal.\"\nAdapting to Adaptations?\nRA as a disruption \"forced\" the women to consider adjust-\nment, including what type of adaptation might be made and\nthe implications, personal and social, of any such changes.\nSince the early 1990s, research focusing on the lived experi-\nence of chronic conditions, such as RA, have produced stage\nmodels of adaptation (Neill, 2002; Walker, Jackson, &\nLittlejohn, 2004). These frameworks share a common focus\non sequential stages of acceptance, adjustment, and nor-\nmalcy (Neill, 2002). While such frameworks can be useful in\nproviding a trajectory \"mud map\" Schulman-Green et\nal.\n(2012) point to the focus on the physical and practical to the\nneglect of the subjective in these models of adaptation. Other\napproaches can \"overemphasise the cheerful, existentially\ntransformative\" elements of adaptation, minimizing the\n\"mundane and ordinary features such as pain, mobility\nimpairment, anxiety or dependency\" (Thorne & Paterson,\nand experiences of adaptation, accounts which speak to the\n\"messiness\" of living with and \"adapting to\" RA (Schulman-\nGreen etal., 2012). Physical, social, and emotional adaptions\nwere made within the many spaces the women occupied and\ninvolved the embodied negotiation of the structural and rela-\ntional dimensions of everyday life (Moss, 1997).\nIt is clear from the women's accounts that there was no\none view of adaptation or one adaptive solution that could be\nused across all contexts. For some women, assistive aids and\nother adaptations facilitated their participation in the every-\nday activities integral to the performance of \"being normal.\"\nFor these women, achieving \"normal\" included a readjusted\nunderstanding of particular roles and activities, and a recon-\nstructed self which embraced adaptations (Sanderson etal.,\n2011). Adaptation was not a presumed practice. As some of\nthe women reported, not all adaptations were considered to\nbe either feasible or desirable. Adaptations could be costly;\npotential loss of independence increased feelings of being\nhandicapped [sic] and further alienation from self were iden-\ntified as potential barriers and/or deterrents. Adaptations\ncould also be experienced as detrimental to self-concept, a\nreminder of the \"dysfunctioning\" or \"deviant\" body\nchoose and to control is paramount in any decision relating\nto adaptation (Lindsay, MacGregor, & Fry, 2014). For some\nwomen, bearing the physical pain associated with a particu-\nlar activity was preferable to RA imposing constraints and\nforcing adaptations. For these women, choosing to minimize\nor ignore the impact of RA can be described as a form of pas-\nsive coping (Whitley etal., 1999). Rather than a negative\nresponse, Whitley etal. (1999) identify the utility of passive\ncoping: a means by which people can continue to engage\nwith an activity despite the associated disabilities. According\nto Whitley et\nal., passive coping is actually an adaptive\nmechanism, providing another means for people with chronic\nconditions to \"maintain a degree of normalcy\" (p. 91)\nWithout ignoring the physical difficulties and emotional\nstruggles which can accompany processes of adaptation,\nCarel (2007) highlights the potential for empowerment and a\nrenewed sense of autonomy: \"Being able to improvise and\ncreate new ways of compensating for a lost capacity demon-\nstrates the plasticity of behaviour and the human capacity to\nadjust to change\" (p. 104). For one woman, being \"realistic\"\nabout her physical capacity allowed her to \"lower expecta-\ntions\" and as a result, decrease the emotional fallout associ-\nated with not being able to achieve set goals. Adaptation in\nthis sense can facilitate what Lindsay etal. (2014) describe\nas \"a sense of existential power, a power to care for the self\"\nThe Body\nWhether feeling removed or separate from her body or con-\nsumed by it, each of the women in this research described the\ncentrality of the body within their everyday lives (Ahistrand\nthe body is the site of pain and disability--it is both object\nand subject, a biological body and a lived body (Peuravaara,\n2013), and it can be experienced as both distant and immedi-\nate (Carel, 2007). Everyday activities from house work to\nshopping were now disrupted by the inconvenience of \"the\ndrew attention to the body with the pain experienced as \"a\nform of `bodily alienation' or `betrayal'\" (S. Williams, 2000,\np. 43). For some of the women, the need for adaptations in\ntheir everyday lives had led to a new focus on the body, as\nthough recognizing its presence for the first time (Plach etal.,\nembodied self as occurring within the context of the noncom-\npliant body, when \"the individual becomes acutely aware of\nthe discrepancy between body and self\" (p. 249). Even in\ntimes relatively free from pain, the prevention strategies and\n\"body awareness\" regimes required a continued focus on the\nbody (Ahistrand etal., 2012). It is clear that within the con-\ntext of RA the taken for granted status of the body, its previ-\nous role as a silently functioning entity (Carel, 2007, p. 99)\nhad shifted to a new focus on the \"bodily states not usually\nThe female body with RA is an important feature of femi-\nnist contributions to disability studies (Crow, 1996; Moss,\nnant presence of body in women's understandings and expe-\nriences of chronic conditions such as RA is related to their\ndomestic roles, and the positioning of household tasks and\nactivities in their everyday lives (Moss, 1997). In terms of\nnarrative reconstruction, the lived experience of RA had not\nonly interrupted the individual woman but also the woman as\nmother, wife/partner. The capacity to perform these ascribed\nroles was important to how the women understood them-\nselves and their position in society more broadly (Moss,\nstudy with young women who have RA: \"As a disease that\ndisproportionately affects women, RA bears on a number of\nsex-related issues, including reproductive physiology, child-\nbearing and childrearing, social behaviour, and quality of\nlife\" (p. 846). However, as some of the women describe,\nsuch roles are flexible and can be redefined and reshaped.\nDrawing on family for support and reorganizing household\nresponsibilities and resources can facilitate the achievement\nof activities while confirming meaningful constructions of\nself (Prodinger, Shaw, Stamm, & Laliberte Rudman, 2014).\nThese negotiations resonate with Moss' (1997) research\nwhich focused on the complex negotiations undertaken by\nolder women with RA as they engaged with the household\nenvironment, the domestic structures, and the broader social\nrelations within their everyday lives. Moss identifies the\nactive role assumed by these women, demonstrating how\nthey negotiate \"space in their home environments, both\nphysically and socially, via continually (re)assessing, (re)\nshaping, and (re)structuring those negotiated spaces\"\nStrengths and Limitations\nAs with all research, there are areas for development as well as\ndirections for future inquiry. Similar to other studies which\ndraw participants from a \"clinically captive\" population, it is\nlikely that women not accessing health services may have dif-\nferent understandings and experiences of RA. It is also recog-\nnized that participant numbers were low and from a\ngeographically limited area. While qualitative research is not\nnumber driven, a larger number of participants would have\nprovided further a more in-depth account of the topic. Many of\nthe findings in this research resonate with and confirm the\nresults of other qualitative studies of women's experiences of\nRA. The strength of this research, while providing confirma-\ntion for previous studies, is the commentary provided by the\nwomen on the \"emotional fallout\" of RA. This issue is not\nwell covered in the research literature with the focus tending\nto be on the adaptations people make and the processes under-\ntaken.As is identified in the literature (Carel, 2007; Schulman-\nGreen etal., 2012), there remains a lack of research engaging\nwith the emotional and subjective experiences of people with\nchronic conditions such as RA. Further research utilizing vari-\nous qualitative methods (in-depth interviews, narrative jour-\nnals, focus groups) could document the experience of women\nwith RA, across a period of time and contexts (work, study,\n\"stay-at-home mothers\"). The information gathered would\ncontribute to the descriptive data on RA as a lived experience.\nThe focus on identifying the ways in which women engage\nwith and negotiate RA as an emotional-social-physical experi-\nence across time and within a diversity of places is particularly\nimportant given the current reorienting of Western health and\nwelfare systems. As governments seek to reduce income sup-\nport costs (disability pensions/allowances) and look to the\npublic and private sectors for employment opportunities for\npeople with disabilities, it is critical that any such policy and\npractice is based on grounded evidence.\nConclusion\nBury's (1982) depiction of RA as a biographical disruption\nprovides a useful framing for understanding the lived experi-\nences of eight women whose accounts of living with RA have\nbeen presented in this research. The disruption to their roles as\nmothers and wives/partners, the new focus on the body and the\ntensions relating to adaptation facilitated a re-authoring of the\nself. A significant feature of the disruptions engendered\nthrough RA was the emphasis the women gave to achieving\n\"normalcy\" within their everyday lives. At times, when the\npain was minimal, living as \"normal\" was easier it was possi-\nble, even momentarily, to forget that RAwas part of their lives.\nDuring flares, \"being normal\" was difficult and at times\nimpossible. The challenges associated with flare ups were par-\nticularly difficult to negotiate, bringing to the fore questions of\npersonal identity and expectations. Engagement with adap-\ntions, such as the use of assistive aids, was contentious and\ncould be understood as empowering or disabling. Whatever\nthe decision made, what was important for each of the women\nwas \"maintaining a sense of value and meaning in life, in spite\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAhlstrand, I., Bj\u00f6rk, M., Thyberg, I., B\u00f6rsbo, B., & Falkmer, T.\n(2012).
