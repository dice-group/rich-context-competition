    "abstract": "Abstract\nSocial exclusion refers to the processes by means of which individuals and groups of people have limited rights and opportunities\nto become fully integrated into society. In Spain, several social and legal developments have taken place. However, they\nhave not necessarily resulted in real social advancement and equality for transsexual people. This discriminatory situation\nis organized within a structural and legal framework, which does not satisfy the particular needs of transsexual people. This\nreality, coupled with social intersubjectivity and a predominance of ignorance and negativity (both of which are directed by\na dominant gender), requires a global strategy to address its structural, cultural, and intersubjective dimensions. A global\nstrategy of this sort should originate from a participative perspective. By using a variety of methods, this article deals with the\nabove issues, as well as the social factors and problems that limit the empowerment and social inclusion of this collective in\na heterocentric society that is increasingly plural and diverse.\n",

Social exclusion is\ndefined as the denial or unfulfillment of civil, political, and\nsocial rights of the citizens, paying special attention to the\nmechanisms and effects of the discriminatory social practices\nas a reflection of individual experiences (Room, 1995). The\nEuropean Union (1993) defines social exclusion as the inability\nto enjoy social rights with no help (because of the individual's\nlimited self-esteem), to face the individual's own duties,\nbecause of the risk of being set aside as an assisted individual\nand being stigmatized in the cities and neighborhood where he\nor she lives. Some years later, the concept is extended to include\nall the different social spheres, relating it to the equality of\nopportunities and referring to all the people who are not allowed\nto benefit from the vital opportunities of a society. From our\npoint of view, social exclusion is a process of gradual distanc-\ning from a situation of social integration, which structural\nmechanisms prevent social groups that are different from the\nheterocentric dominant position from actively taking part in the\neconomic, social, political, and cultural spheres of a society.\nThis concept includes three key aspects that can explain\nwhat it is to be outside or inside the society:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Structural origin. Social structure, inequalities, and\nsocial disruption result in the difficulty in gaining\naccess to the market society and to the different social\nspheres that prevent transsexual people from having a\nhigh quality of life and social welfare.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Multidimensional character. There are many sectors\nor dimensions that can affect social exclusion, such as\npolitical, social, economic, cultural, and health fac-\ntors, which feed back into each other and hinder the\ninclusion.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Nature of the process. It is a continuum. It is a process\nthat begins with a situation of vulnerability and may\nincrease over time. In this specific case, social exclu-\nsion can result from a previous situation of vulnerabil-\nity. Nonetheless, there is a Copernican shift when the\nperson decides to have a new identity, either a male or\nfemale transsexual identity. This process begins with\na social exclusion, and it usually results in the most\nabsolute social marginalization due to prejudices,\nsocial rejection, and the lack of opportunities and\nsocial expectations.\n1University of Malaga, Spain\n2Service gay, bisexual and transgender Community of Madrid, Spain\nCorresponding Author:\nLuis Miguel Rond\u00f3n Garc\u00eda, University of Malaga, Ampliaci\u00f3n Campus\nEmail: madgrana1@gmail.com\nImpact of Social Exclusion in Transsexual\nPeople in Spain From an Intersectional\nand Gender Perspective\nLuis Miguel Rond\u00f3n Garc\u00eda1 and Dolores Martin Romero2\n Keywords\nstigma, transsexuality, social exclusion, empowerment, transgender, intersectionality, social intersubjectivity.\n2 SAGE Open\nAccording to the aforementioned concepts and from this\npoint of view, the main objectives of this study are\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 To show the relationship between social factors and\nsocial situation of transsexual people in a heterocen-\ntric society that prevents their integration in equality\nconditions;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 To analyze the ways of social exclusion and the effects\non social inequality of transsexual people;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 To identify stigma and intersectionality as elements\nassociated with the empowerment of these people.\nSocial Exclusion Based on Gender and\nSexual Identity\nWe can add an extra factor of social inclusion to the poverty\nsituation or social inequality in people with male or female\nsexual identity. Sexual identity is a relatively nonvisible\nstigma, which is hidden to avoid rejection and social exclu-\nsion. The lack of a specific socialization and the limited\nsocial and familiar affiliation results in a series of categories\nof social exclusion in those homosexual, bisexual, and trans-\nsexual people who do not achieve the category of subjects.\nThese factors can be seen in the social recognition as citizens\nwho enjoy equal rights. Therefore, the experiences lived by\nthese people must be analyzed by taking into account their\ncomplex relationships with other social-structural character-\nistics. To improve their social status and achieve equality, a\nseries of actions is required to allow the inclusion of trans-\nsexual people in the society as subjects of law to build a new\ninclusive citizenship, free from differences.\nIn a heterocentric society, the social and cultural construc-\ntion of social rules from a privileged position of heterosexu-\nality may result in a cultural structure that is degrading and\nunfair in terms of sexual differences (Fraser, 1997). Social\nexclusion of homosexual, bisexual, and transsexual people\nhighlights more and more questions and problems faced by\nthese vulnerable and disadvantaged collectives. In the spe-\ncific case of the transsexual group, it is a multidimensional\nand dynamic process in which different associated exclusive\nfactors can cause an obvious social disadvantage compared\nwith the rest of the society or the heterosexual dominant\ngroup. These barriers are shown in social, family relations,\nand in exclusive social institutions, all of which prevent their\neffective involvement in social and cultural life (Pattnaik &\nThe aforementioned direct discrimination usually over-\nlaps the legal discrimination suffered by those members of\nminority social groups, which can be shown indirectly as\nsocial barriers that prevent this social group from a complete\nsocial emancipation. Legal discrimination is more tangible\nthan social discrimination, as it is easier to identify, and\ntherefore to fight against legal grievances, than the decoding\nof the mechanisms that are often hidden behind cultural and\nsocial rules of daily practice (Tak\u00e1cs, Mocsonaki, & T\u00f2h,\n2008). Legal questions, such as the full recognition of the\ngender identity, marriage, adoption, and inheritance rights,\nor the irregular situation in the case of immigrant transsexual\npeople facing expulsion, can be decisive factors that limit\nsocial inclusion. Legal recognition of the identity is basic for\nthese people to join society in conditions of equality and to\nbe recognized as full and active citizens. It is true that, in the\ncase of Spain, the law has had a pedagogical effect, recogniz-\ning some values, such as the plurality of family models, the\nright to the difference, privatization of the affective relation-\nships, and the overcoming of some sanctioning social rules\nas its own. However, there is a long way to go to build and\nrealize the importance of the invisible and symbolic aspects.\nTogether with these social factors, we have to take into\naccount others, which are shown in the casual attribution of the\nsocial perceptions and in the discourse analysis. That is the\ncase of the impact of the stigma and the exclusion from\nthe health system. Sexual and gender minority groups usu-\nally have to face different mental and physical problems,\nwhich are referred as minority stress, with a high psychologi-\ncal impact on the position of disadvantage suffered by these\npeople, either in a high level, such as the unequal treatment\nin legal or economic institutions, or in the stigma that is\nshown in daily interactions and microaggressions (Meyer,\n2003). Many types of stigma and exclusion within some\nsocial and economic environments, which can affect health,\nmight be perpetuated by the tension suffered by minorities as\na result of the imposition of the majority. Together with this\npsychological stress, we also found an economic discrimina-\ntion due to their low income. We also have to take into\naccount that there is a lack of opportunities in a working\nsociety that is homogeneous and exclusive, resulting in a\nprecarious job limited to marginal occupations with little rec-\nognition and no social affiliation.\nWe have also to mention the social discrimination and\nfamily rejection that affect mental and emotional health of\nthese groups, reducing the potential of endogenous resources.\nThe fear of being stigmatized by society and the resultant\nstress could be reduced by the social protection and shelter\nprovided by the family. Few of these individuals start a fam-\nily from their different models, and, in the case of our sub-\njects involved in the study, they either have scarce or a\ndifficult relationship with their families. In other cases, trans-\nsexual people may also have problems to defend their place\nor role in the family, to inherit what is legally theirs, or to\nexpress their wishes from puberty, either due to fear or social\npressure. There is also a weak socialization due to the fact\nthat the family socialized in roles that may be different from\nthe identity of the transsexual subject. There is no other\nsocial model of reference or pattern to learn how to live in a\nsociety according to one's sexual identity, regardless the\nphysical condition of the genre role adopted at birth.\nThe mentioned facts constitute a process of social exclu-\nsion from outside to inside. When these subjects assume their\nmarginal status and internalize the different position granted\nRond\u00f3nGarc\u00eda 3\nby the dominant society, through stigmas, it, in turn, implies\nself-exclusion. Society establishes several means to catego-\nrize people as well as features that are considered as ordinary\nand normal for the members of those categories. This allows\nus to categorize a stranger at first sight because of his or her\nappearance and to tell which his or her features and social\nidentities are. The stigma is a deeply discrediting feature and\nimplies a double perspective: the one of the discredited per-\nson, whose difference is known or is immediately obvious\n(when the physical appearance or the body anthropology of\nthe transsexual person shows ambiguous signs or a different\nappearance), and the one of the discreditable person, whose\ndifference is not known nor immediately detected, and it is\npurely symbolic. It is the moment when the rules and social\nexpectations play a role (Goffman, 1998).\nThe same features are found in every case: A subject who\ncould have been easily accepted in an ordinary social inter-\nchange has a feature that leads us to move away from him or\nher when we meet him or her. This subject has a stigma, an\nundesirable difference that we have not predicted. Goffman\nrefers as normal to those subjects who do not negatively\nmove away from particular expectations, from what is\nexpected from them. Normal subjects, that is, the heterosex-\nual collective, consider that the person who has a stigma is\nnot completely human and, according to this perception, they\npractice different types of discrimination: We build some\narguments and ideas to explain his or her inferiority and pro-\nvide a detailed account of the danger posed by this person.\nThe stigma implies a social process of two roles in which\nthe subject is involved, at least in some contexts and some\nstages of life. The normal subject and the stigmatized sub-\njects are not people, they are perspectives. Long-lasting fea-\ntures can turn a certain subject into a stereotype, and he or\nshe can play this stigmatized role in almost every social situ-\nation he or she has to face. So, it will be considered as normal\nto refer to him or her as stigmatized. Nevertheless, these fea-\ntures do not determine the nature of the roles considered as\nnormal or stigmatized, but the frequency with which the sub-\njects play one or the other. This process makes the transsex-\nual person reproduce the patterns and expectations that\nsociety anticipates from him or her and face some psycho-\nlogical or symbolic social barriers that can lead him to a seg-\nregated transsexual lifestyle and limit his or her chances of\nsocial promotion and advance, as he or she assumes this\nsymbolic label as normal.\nSocial Intersubjectivity\nAccording to Foucault (2009), there must be a harmony\nbetween the field and the habitus so that there can be a social\norder, which depends mainly on the agents' will to respect\nand follow the dominant regulations and the imposed rules.\nThen, the habitus reproduces the rules, but, at the same time,\nit can change them, transform them, as it has this innovating\ncharacter. In this dialectical relationship, the symbolic\ncapital plays an important role. The symbolic violence is the\nmechanism of social reproduction par excellence, which is\nkept because people need to be recognized and reinforce\ntheir social identities (Foucault, 2009). This violence is\nshown in the invisibility, in the factors that generate social\nexclusion, when different people are not admitted in a job\noffer or in a social circle. Therefore, it is very difficult to\ndetect and report, as it is indirect and less visible.\nAs an alternative to this symbolic and social violence,\nButler (1991) deals with the deconstruction of the oppressive\npower relationships, which can be perceived in the language\nand in the discourse practice, to show the essentialist cate-\ngory with regard to the identity and gender. He focuses on\nthe deconstruction of the heteronormativity imposed by the\nheterosexuality and considered as natural, essential, and\nmoral, devaluing other options of sexuality (Moon, 2008).\nThis model is reproduced from the social and human interac-\ntions, in the language, and operates in our thoughts and social\nlife (Livingstone, 2010). These discourses dominate our\nthoughts and interactions, establishing a dichotomy of gen-\nder, between men and women, male and female, in a binary\nway.\nThe social construction that defines heterosexual identity\nas the normal identity creates a stigma that implies a self-\nexclusion process of the transsexual people and social barri-\ners within the social, political, educational, and working\nenvironments. As a result of this, a disaffiliation within these\nenvironments is produced, reducing transsexual people to a\nsecond-class citizenship status and limiting their chances to\nbe socially included. We are socialized and used to accepting\nheteronormativity, to allowing and justifying the potential\noppression toward different options, behaviors, and attitudes.\nIt is a cognitive heuristic concept that identifies what is not\nheterosexual as deviated or intelligible (Butler, 1991;\nQueer theory deals with the deconstruction of oppressive\npower relationships that are perceived in the language as nor-\nmalizing trends of resistance of the liberation movements,\ntogether with the discourse practices. This theory also tries to\nshow the nonsense of the essentialist categories of sexual and\ngender identity. Namaste (2000) holds that sexual minorities\nhave different interests of gender, and that transgender people\nand their experiences have been put aside. He also provides a\ncritical frame to identify normative processes of categoriza-\ntion and identities, paying special attention to the ways of\nhuman differentiation. Excluding policies and practices, and\nthe denial of their existence in the institutions results in invis-\nibility of these transgender people when they have to face\neveryday practices that are reduced to the categories of men\nand women. These practices also deny the possibility of other\noptions that, if considered as positive, can enrich the plural\nand heterogeneous society that has loomed in this century.\nFull integration will not be possible without the abolition of\ntranssexual subjectivities, which are still evident in our soci-\nety, minds, and institutions. These patterns are followed when\n4 SAGE Open\ntransphobia and genderism are considered as a conviction or\nbelief that men and women are the only normal expression of\nIntersectionality\nThis concept was analyzed by Williams in 1995. This author\nsuggests that the structure of dominance hinders the attempts\nof resistance. He also explains how social and cultural differ-\nences according to the gender can challenge the dominant\nhegemonic model. It is a complex system of multiple and\nsimultaneous oppression structures, which explains the speci-\nficities of sexism as a result of the dynamic intersection\nbetween gender, sex, ethnic group, and social class. This study\nhas also analyzed the specificity of transsexual immigrant\nwomen, because of the important flow of Latin American\nimmigrant women to Spain in the last 20 years. In Spain, with\nthe regulatory processes and the improvement of the civil\nrights, the right of gender identity was regulated by the Spanish\nchange of the Civil Registry entry related to a person's sex and\nallows to change the person's sexual identity with a previous\nmedical or psychological report. Transsexuality has also been\ncategorized as a possible cause to apply for political asylum.A\ngreat number of people from the Southern Cone and the\nCaribbean came to Spain searching for human rights and a\ndecent life. In these cases, cultural differentiation of gender in\ntheir places of origin comes up against the gender construction\nof the dominant society and the historical, social, and cultural\nconstruction of the gender identity in Spain. Moreover, we can\nalso add the concept of social class as another element of\nexclusion, as the options and possibilities of social insertion\ndiffer in middle or high class people, with a better socioeco-\nnomic status. That is, the combination of gender, ethnic group,\nand social class converges as an atomized vector leading to\nsocial exclusion. We also have to take into account the dialec-\ntic between gender and interculturality as an independent\nbinomial when analyzing social exclusion.\nTogether with all the above mentioned facts, multiple\nadditional mechanisms of gender discrimination and hetero-\nsexism, such as age, situation, and social status, also con-\nverge. On many occasions, these women are not only\ndiscriminated due to their transsexual condition, but they are\nalso stigmatized and despised because they belong to a lower\nstatus, are poor, or have a marginal job. Thus, discrimination\nis related not only to gender but also to social classes.\nIntersectional subordination often results from a discrimi-\nnating factor which, when interacting with other existing\noppression mechanisms, creates a new dimension of disem-\npowerment. This analysis reveals the need for a global\napproach to the structural and political aspects, and the role\nof public institutions in avoiding the perpetuation of these\nintersections and the resulting social barriers.\non the critical discussion on the feminist frames, which have\nnot recognized the importance of the class, sexual, and gen-\nder discrimination within the different studies on patriarchy.\nThere has been a quick advance in certain aspects related to\nequality, but with regard to identities and differences this\nadvance has been slower.\nPurdie-Vaughns and Eibach (2008) go back to the concept\nof intersectionality, mentioning an interactive model that is\nshown in policies, social practices, stereotypes, and stigmas.\nAccording to this, social stigma of transsexuality results in a\ntwo-tailed exclusion. On one hand, society does not establish\npolicies of inclusion, employment, or integration because of\ntheir different condition or the invisibility represented by\nthese groups for the public institutions. On the other hand,\nthe stigma makes these people assume the label of different\nor excluded, reproducing the sociocultural stereotypes and\npatterns determined by the society, such as working in jobs\nrelated to beauty or sex (vertical segregation) and having a\nlifestyle according to these social stereotypes and expecta-\ntions. It is the so-called \"pink glass ceiling.\"\nThe distinction between the additive and intersectional\napproach has been studied by Spelman (1988) and Hancock\nuseful theoretical frameworks on the complexity of the inter-\nsectionality with regard to identity discourses and construc-\ntions. They show that people with social identities considered\nas inferior by hegemonic power systems experience these\nmultiple identities as a whole, spreading into all the social\nspheres and going along with them through all their different\nevolution stages, from the beginning of their young age to\ntheir maturity or adult age, thus gradually reducing their\nchances and potentialities.\nThe described circumstances show the necessity to review\nthe Western gender perspective in the approach of transsex-\nual women from different cultural origins, overcoming the\nso-called feminist mainstream and recognizing that the\nfemale subject is not a homogeneous category. It is basic to\ndevelop a gender approach, including social, cultural, and\nethnic differences and allowing the analysis of the roles, rela-\ntionships, and identities of men and women from their own\nlogical point of views. It is also necessary to encourage the\ninternal dialogue on women's right, exploring the intercon-\nnections between individual and collective rights (Cobar,\nMethod\nThis study is funded by the Junta de Andaluc\u00eda (Regional\nGovernment of Andalusia, Spain) and the University of\nMalaga (Spain) as a teaching innovation project. It was car-\nhas worked using a plural and mixed methodology, that is,\nquantitatively and qualitatively.\nThe quantitative method consists of a statistical, descrip-\ntive, and inferential analysis using SPSS Statistics, Version\n22. A transversal design has been carried out using\nRond\u00f3nGarc\u00eda 5\nquestionnaires addressed to both male and female users of the\nServicio de Atenci\u00f3n a Personas Homosexuales, Bisexuales y\nTransexuales de la Comunidad de Madrid (attention service\nfor homosexual, bisexual, and transsexual people of the\nregion of Madrid, Spain) and the Federaci\u00f3n Estatal Espa\u00f1ola\nde Lesbianas, Gays, Bisexuales y Transexuales (Spanish fed-\neration of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transsexual people).\nThis questionnaire measures the level of agreement of the\nsubjects on the proposed factors generating exclusion, with a\ndichotomous scale and multiple choices.\nParticipants were randomly selected among the people\nwho got in touch with those institutions, which provided us\nwith a list. We also used the so-called snowball sampling\ntechnique, which consists of recruiting new subjects\n(recruited by existing study subjects). Participation was vol-\nuntary and anonymous. Data were collected from September\nThe triangle interviewing technique was chosen for the\nqualitative method. Ten triangle interviews were carried out.\nPurposeful questions were agreed together with the techni-\ncians and experts of the institutions involved in the study and\nwith specialists in the field. The length of each triangle inter-\nview ranged from 1 hr to 1.5 hr. Atlas.ti software was used.\nThe analysis of the content of the interviews organizes the\ninformation taking into account several dimensions: social\nstatus of the collective, factors generating social exclusion,\nand the role of the socialization agents and institutions\nPopulation and Sampling\nThere are few studies in the world that have approached\ntranssexuality estimation. Nevertheless, those few ones show\nthat there is a higher prevalence of male\u00adfemale transsexual\nIn most of the countries in which this prevalence has been\nstudied, there is an incidence of transsexuality that varies\nthis estimation is higher inAustralia and Singapore. In Spain,\naccording to the incidence data consulted, there are 67 new\ncases each year.\nThere are no official statistics that provide the number of\ntranssexual people. This is the reason why we have turned to\nthose Spanish institutions working in this field at a national\nlevel. Those data can show some kind of bias of the sample,\ngiven than almost 50% of those people are provided by\nsocial organizations of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transsex-\nual people and by the Spanish federation of gay, lesbian, and\ntranssexual people, and are users or participants of these\norganizations (first source). Another consulted source was\nan official agency, the Servicio de Atenci\u00f3n a Personas\nHomosexuales, Bisexuales y Transexuales de la Comunidad\nde Madrid (attention service for homosexual, bisexual, and\ntranssexual people of the Region of Madrid, Spain).\nMain studies and sources agree that the number of trans-\nto the Fundaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola para la identidad de g\u00e9nero\n(Spanish foundation for the gender identity), the scientific\n(25.6%) were male. With regard to the origin or ethnic group,\nwhom 84% were living in Madrid and Barcelona and came\nmainly from Latin America (Equator, Brazil, Colombia,\nArgentina, Venezuela, Peru, Costa Rica, Mexico, Panama,\nand Dominican Republic), although there were also people\nfrom Egypt, Nigeria, and Kuwait, which are the most oppres-\nsive countries with transsexual people.\nParticipants\nMost of the participants live in a situation of social exclu-\nsion. Their socioeconomic level is medium-low, with low\nincomes (one out of three living below the poverty thresh-\nold), and almost 50% of them have engaged in prostitution\nsome time. In a global population, the unemployment rate is\naround 35%. According to the estimations of the Federaci\u00f3n\nEstatal de Lesbianas, Gais, Transexuales y Bisexuales, this\nrate could be up to 70% in the case of transsexual, homo-\nsexual, and bisexual people.\nResults\nThe results of the quantitative method will be analyzed in the\nfirst place, and then, this information will be completed with\nthe data collected with the qualitative method, so that the\nreasons for social exclusion of transsexual people could be\nmore thoroughly explained.\nFrom the quantitative data, we can conclude by means of\nthe analysis of the sociodemographic variables that trans-\nsexual people are young, with a high percentage of immi-\nfemale. With regard to age, 25.4% are younger than 18 years,\nolder than 46 years. One out of five (20.5%) is immigrant,\nmainly from Latin America (Peru, Equator, Argentina,\nVenezuela, and Brazil).\nAs a result of the descriptive statistics, we have catego-\nrized social conflicts that most often occur related to gender\nidentity and which act as the factor generating social\nexclusion.\nFirst of all, in the variables related to conflicts, we found\nthat almost nine out of 10 people (88%) suffer social con-\nflicts because of their identity, both during childhood and\npuberty, and in the adult age, when they decide to change\ntheir gender. In the access to social institutions and social\nlife, 33.7% have been victims of social discrimination.\nFurthermore, 19.3% have specific conflicts as they get out of\nthe closet to a new gender identity and break the social rules\nand the heteronormativity model, with a higher impact than\n6 SAGE Open\nthe homosexual option. We have to add that 26.5% suffer\nconflicts when socially interacting and participating in the\ncommunity. Scores obtained in the above mentioned con-\nflicts are shown in Table 1.\nSecond, in the variables related to social environment, we\ndescribe social situation and social problems suffered by this\ngroup. We have to take into account that, although some of\nthese problems and situations are common in the rest of the\npopulation, due to the specificities and vulnerabilities of\ntranssexual people, transactions of these factors have a\nhigher impact and intensity in this particular case, given their\nsocial fragility, social and family disaffiliation, and the lack\nof social and labor opportunities. Also, 22.9% have interper-\nsonal and familiar problems with their family of origin and\nthe primary groups of reference, and 19.3% state they have\ndifficulties of social integration when facing different social\nenvironments, such as employment, education, political par-\nticipation, and so forth. Very few of these people have a part-\nner or start a family from different models (2.7%), and 19.3%\nhave conflicts within their own family. To family problems,\nwe have to add the previous ones suffered before founding\ntheir own family, taking into account that 8.1% state to be\nrejected or not accepted by their families because of their\ntranssexual condition. Furthermore, 1.7% have suffered epi-\nsodes of gender and familiar violence with their current or\nformer partners. That is, we can confirm that there are family\nconflicts previous to the current situation, and subsequently,\nonce they have started a family or their own unity of\nhabitation.\nThe unemployment rate is high (22.7%). In the current\ncontext of economic crisis, perspectives are limited for trans-\nsexual people, even more difficult than for the rest of the\npopulation, taking into account that job opportunities are\nvertically segregated and reduced to marginal jobs or jobs\nrelated to beauty or sexual exploitation. Mobbing rate is also\nhigh. Of the male and female interviewees, 7.2% have suf-\nfered mobbing due to their identity. Scores obtained accord-\ning to the social status of the transsexual people are shown in\nTo the social status, we have to add specific health prob-\nlems resulting from the problems and social situation, which\nhave been described. Social problems can result in health\nproblems, if we take into account that 8.4% suffer psychic\ndisorders due to the emotional and psychosocial impact of\nthe gender change and the identity crisis suffered by many of\nthese people. There are also cases of gender dysphoria.\nBecause of their disability, 3.2% have functional social\nneeds, and 1.1% suffer problems of drug addiction; 7.3%\nhave other health problems. All of this leads us to take into\naccount this high psychosocial and mental impact apart from\nthe social exclusion and inequality suffered by transsexual\npeople in our society, and to consider this health situation as\na factor generating social exclusion.\nFor the inferential statistics, in the differences detected\nwith the chi-square statistic, we have found that there is a\nstatistical significance in the correlation of the following\nvariables: conflicts of identity, discrimination, social prob-\nlems, mobbing, and socialization.\nThe statistical tests show the incidence of the specific\nsocial factors that limit social inclusion of transsexual people\nbecause of their identity. Nevertheless, other descriptive and\nadescriptive factors, such as the age, the type of family, and\ngetting out of the closet, are not statistically significant. So,\nwe can conclude that the mere fact of belonging to a male or\nfemale identity different from the dominant heterocentric\nmodel implies a specific social difficulty, which results in\ndiscrimination, different social problems, and difficulties to\naccess to the different spheres, which define socialization\nenvironments.\nIn the specific case of immigrant people, the chi-square\ntest has provided some additional significant results in the\nfollowing variables: age, unemployment, familiar conflict,\nand discrimination. According to the tests that have been car-\nried out, there is an added factor of exclusion or social spe-\ncific problem in immigrant transsexual people, as we have\nalready mentioned in our initial hypotheses. Apart from the\nabove mentioned social exclusion factors, we have to add\nsocial problems of social discrimination due to their trans-\nsexual and immigrant condition: unemployment (which\nseverely affects) and different familiar conflicts. Age is also\nrelated to social exclusion in immigrant people. From an\nintersectorial perspective, we can state that social status, gen-\nder, and ethnic group represent a complex system of simulta-\nneous structures that lead to social exclusion, just because of\nbeing transsexual and immigrant, that is, different.\nFrom the qualitative data, we have found in the triangle\ninterviews some explanations regarding how these factors\ngenerating social exclusion occur. These are the following:\nTable 1. Types of Social Conflicts Suffered by Transsexual\nPeople.\nTypes of conflicts Percentage\nConflicts of identity 88\nConflicts suffered when getting out of the closet 19.3\nSocial discrimination because of identity 33.7\nSocial and community conflicts 26.5\nTable 2.

The\nemployment is unstable and jobs are vertically segre-\ngated within the field of beauty, domestic care ser-\nvices, and marginal jobs. The level of education and\ntraining is low. Immigrant women survive thanks to\ncharity and prostitution. In the case of male transsexu-\nals, jobs are more normalized, but in any case, unem-\nployment is very high. \"Nobody is going to hire me in\na shopping center as a shop assistant or secretary if\nthey know that I am transsexual\" said Subject 1. \"As I\nam immigrant and also transsexual, the only option I\nhave found in Spain is prostitution\" said Subject 5.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Social groups and networks. In the collective imagi-\nnation, there are some stereotypes and stigmas related\nto transsexuality, which hinder their access to social\ngroups and networks. Social affiliation and participa-\ntion is limited, reduced to groups made up of trans-\nsexual people. In the case of immigrant transsexual\npeople, they usually socialize with Latin American\npeople. These primary groups are the main social link\nand support they have. \"People look at me in the\nstreet. If I am seated next to heterosexual person in a\npub or public place, we are the center of attention,\"\nsaid Subject 8.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Family. Few of them found their own families in spite\nof the legalization of same-sex marriages. We can talk\nabout familiar estrangement in general and specific\ndifficulties to start their own family. \"Men look for a\nheterosexual woman to get married\" said Subject 4.\n\"Men only want me for sex, but not for something\nelse, not for introducing me to their families\" said\nSubject 9. In the case of immigrant women, their fam-\nilies living in their origin places do not know their\nnew orientation. \"I have not said anything to my fam-\nily about my new life in Spain. They would not under-\nstand it\" said Subject 6. Sometimes they are rejected\nby their families and they have difficult relationships,\nwithout taking part in family events or rites.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Social discrimination. Discrimination is worse in\nhomosexual people, as they radically break with the\ndominant heterocentric model, with a higher impact\nthan in other options. According to the subjects' state-\nments, they have been rejected because of their exces-\nsive femininity (female transsexual) and masculinity\n(male transsexual) when they were children or teenag-\ners. Once they have changed their identity in the adult\nage, they feel more rejection than when they presented\nthemselves in society as homosexual. \"Many times,\nwhen I go to public institutions to do some paperwork,\nI dress as a man to look like a very feminine gay,\ninstead of a transsexual woman because they treat me\nbetter with more respect,\" said Subject 10. \"When I\nbecame transsexual, I thought that discrimination\nwould end. I did not think it was going to be worse,\"\nsaid Subject 7.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Cultural environment. If we understand gender as a\nconstruct with a historic, social, and cultural origin,\nwe can find some differences of understanding gender\nin immigrant people. In the interviews, female trans-\nsexual people often talked as if they were men, and\nthey called themselves gays. \"In my country there is a\ngay or a man, transsexuality is not understood,\" said\nSubject 6. We also find differences in the processes of\nsocial inclusion of male and female transsexual peo-\nple, as female ones have more difficulties because of\nthe cultural construction of gender and social inequal-\nity socially built around the female symbols.\nFigure 1 shows the factors generating social exclusion in\ntranssexual people according to the information collected in\nthe triangle interviews:\nConclusion\nSocial exclusion of transsexual people has some specific\ncharacteristics. It is articulated within a structural and regula-\ntory framework in which the social intersubjectivity and the\nconstruction of the dominant gender in the heterocentric\nsociety represent an added element of exclusion. The lack of\nspecific socialization and reference models, and social and\nfamiliar disaffiliation, results in a situation of evident social\ninequality, which hinders the mechanisms to reach the recog-\nnition as citizens enjoying equal rights. It is a multidimen-\nsional and dynamic process where several social, economic,\nfamily, and employment factors and community participa-\ntion converge. All of this can cause a social disadvantage\nSocial\ngroups and\nnetworks\nEconomic and\nemployment\nsegregation\nSocial\ndiscrimination\nFamily\nestrangement\nand\ndisaffiliation\nFigure 1. Factors generating social exclusion in transsexual\npeople.\nSource. Author's own construction.\n8 SAGE Open\nwith regard to the rest of the people who belong to the domi-\nnant heterosexual model. These barriers have a social, cul-\ntural, and, also, symbolic origin. Transsexual people fight\nagainst the social exclusion and inequality. This fight is\ngoing to be a long battle, and it is not only a question of legal\nrights and equality but also a question of equity and human\nAs social exclusion is not only structural but also sym-\nbolic, it is a process, which in a long term, can result in social\nmarginalization. Vertical and horizontal segregation, diffi-\nculties to get a job, reducing the possibilities of transsexual\npeople to unstable jobs or to prostitution, implies worse\nsocial conditions, social discrimination, and hinders their\nsocial mobility and to be fully included in the society.\nThe subjective experiences of the people involved in the\nstudy show complex stories, with tensions between the soci-\nety and the intersubjectivity (Ali, 2014). Those elements rep-\nresent an argument to criticize the dominant hegemonic\nmodel and the policies of social and gender inclusion. The\npostmodern theory needs to delve into these questions from\nthe perspective of the queer theory, allowing to build the dis-\ncourses of the difference in an equality position, where there\nare different regulatory models in which everybody can fill,\nbeyond the binary classification of man and woman.\nThere are a lot of models of identity, sexual orientation,\nand differences according to the gender, and each one needs\nto be approached from their differences and specificities,\nunderstanding this diversity as a positive and unifying ele-\nment in a plural and heterogeneous society. It is necessarily a\nsocial and politic empowerment of transsexual people,\nbreaking the traditional heteronormative hegemony of gen-\nder, from a perspective that perceives those people as active\nsubjects, as a part of the society, because the intersectorial\nsubordination is a factor of oppression and discrimination.\nThe above mentioned circumstances clearly show the need to\nreview the Western perspective of gender, in the approach to\ntranssexual people, incorporating social, cultural, and ethnic\ndifferences from the plurality of approaches and views.\nThe stigma built around transsexual people is a discredit-\ning feature that establishes some differences regarding what\nis considered as normal, from the privileged and normalized\nposition of heterosexuality, which stigmatize transsexual\npeople, compared with other social groups. It is an interac-\ntive model, evident in policies, social practices, and stereo-\ntypes, which involves the invisibility or denial of the\ntranssexual collective and its reduction to a marginal group\nor to second-class citizens. Moreover, many transsexual peo-\nple assume this label, which results in their self-exclusion.\nThere is another additional element of exclusion regarding\nimmigrant transsexual people who stand for a third of the\nglobal population. Regulatory development and advances in\nthe last 10 years have not been translated into equal rights and\nhave not had the desired pedagogical effects. As for immi-\ngrant people, there is a social and differential construction of\nthe gender and there are also some specific factors of social\nexclusion that can result in social marginalization with the\nlack of access to the social resources due to their irregular\nstatus. Immigrants and transsexual people suffer a significant\nsocial discrimination, unemployment, and the lack of\nresources and social protection. So, to the exclusion because\nof their condition of transsexual, we have to add the condition\nof immigrant, as they belong to a disadvantaged social class.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAli, R.
