    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis exploratory study investigated child sleep in a sample of maltreated children living in foster care and examined its\nassociations with placement conditions and history of maltreatment. Participants included 25 foster children and their foster\ncaregiver. Children were on average 60.24 months of age (SD = 18.70). Foster mothers completed questionnaires assessing\nparenting stress and quality of child sleep while maltreatment/placement history was retrieved from children Child Protection\nServices (CPS) records. Shorter nocturnal sleep duration and parasomnias were related to placement at a younger age. The\nnon-restorative sleep index was significantly related to time spent in the foster home and parenting stress and marginally\nrelated to number of placements and sexual abuse and neglect. Poor sleep was associated with past experience of sexual\nabuse and neglect and parenting stress. No relationships were found between sleep characteristics and past experiences of\nphysical abuse or type of foster family. These findings provide an opportunity to uncover how foster children experiences\nare related to sleep disturbances.\n",

However, information about foster children\nquality of sleep is sparse. Given that foster children have\nexperienced chaotic and inconsistent care prior to placement,\nthey may be particularly frightened at night and not view\nfoster caregivers as sources of regulation of fears (Tininenko,\nFisher, Bruce, & Pears, 2010). In particular, there is a need to\nidentify sleep habits of young foster children and determine\nhow experiences of maltreatment and placement conditions\nmight be related to sleep quality and disruptions.\nSleep Disorders in Young Children\nSleep disorders are highly prevalent in children, as shown in\nepidemiologic studies indicating that up to 50% of children\nexperience a sleep problem (Carter, Hathaway, & Lettieri,\n2014). The most prevalent sleep disorders in children are\nbehavioral insomnia and parasomnias. The former is mostly\ncharacterized by bedtime resistance, frequent nighttime\nawakening, and/or an inability to sleep alone, whereas the\nlatter are characterized by awakenings from deep sleep, such\nas sleepwalking, bruxism, enuresis, sleep terrors, and night-\nmares (American Academy of Sleep Medicine [AASM],\nMultiple factors related to individual and relational char-\nacteristics are associated with child sleep (Touchette, Petit,\nTremblay, & Montplaisir, 2009). For instance, sleep distur-\nbances are linked to child internalizing and externalizing dis-\norders (Gregory & Sadeh, 2012) and to greater psychological\ndistress in mothers (Martin, Hiscock, Hardy, Davey, & Wake,\n2007). Low quality of mother-child interactions and stressful\nfamily life events are associated with poor sleep in non-\nclinical samples (B\u00e9langer, Bernier, Paquet, Simard, &\n1Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada\n2CIUSSS du Nord-de-l'\u00cele-de-Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada\n3Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, Canada\n4Centre de recherche Jeunes en difficult\u00e9, CIUSSS du Centre-Sud-de-l'\u00cele-\nde-Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada\n5McGill University, Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada\n6Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada\nCorresponding Author:\nKarine Dubois-Comtois, Department of Psychology, Universit\u00e9 du\nQu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, C.P. 500, Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada\nEmail: karine.dubois-comtois@uqtr.ca\nPoor Quality of Sleep in Foster Children\nRelates to Maltreatment and Placement\nConditions\nKarine Dubois-Comtois1,2, Chantal Cyr3,4,\nMarie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Pennestri2,5, and Roger Godbout2,6\n Keywords\ncriminology, experimental psychology, sociology\n2 SAGE Open\neconomic status is also associated with poorer sleep, includ-\ning sleep-onset difficulties (Petit, Paquet, Touchette, &\nMontplaisir, 2010). Taken together, these studies suggest that\nsleep is sensitive to not only child or parent characteristics but\nalso to the exposition of adverse environmental conditions.\nSleep Characteristics of Children in\nFoster Care\nChildren placed in foster care face an alarming combination\nof risk conditions, including experiences of early maltreat-\nment and separations from their primary caregivers, which\ncan result in emotional and behavioral disturbances (Villodas,\nLitrownik, Newton, & Davis, 2016). Yet, to our knowledge,\nonly one study has specifically assessed sleep of young fos-\nter children. In this study, sleeping behavior was assessed\nusing sleep actigraphy and parent-report measures among\ngroups of children (3-7 years of age) living in foster care or\ncommunity settings (Tininenko et al., 2010). Results showed\nthat foster children have greater difficulty initiating sleep\nthan community children. However, children living in treat-\nment foster care (receiving preventive intervention address-\ning socio-emotional needs) had a longer sleep duration than\nthose living in regular foster care or in a low-income com-\nmunity. Sleep duration did not differ between children in\nregular foster care and those of the community. Overall, this\nstudy suggests that parental status and placement type relates\nto child sleep characteristics. However, it did not assess fos-\nter children's living conditions that could be affecting sleep,\nsuch as placement conditions and past experiences of mal-\ntreatment. Moreover, no information related to parasomnias\nwas reported.\nStudies assessing the impact of maltreatment on quality of\nchild sleep are very limited. Whereas one study has found\nthat sexually abused children (mean age 5.9 years) had more\nsleep problems as reported by parents (e.g., being overtired,\nsleeping less or more than most children, and having trouble\nsleeping) than the comparison group (Dubowitz, Black,\nHarrington, & Verschoore, 1993), another showed that expe-\nriences of physical abuse but not sexual abuse were related to\npoor quality of sleep in children (7-14 years of age) as\nassessed by actigraphy (Sadeh et al., 1995). Finally, prepu-\nbertal abused children were twice as active at night as control\nand depressed children and had prolonged sleep latency and\ndecreased sleep efficiency (Glod, Teicher, Hartman, &\nHarakal, 1997). No study has yet confirmed the hypothesis\nthat neglect should impact on child sleep.\nThe present exploratory study is the first report on multi-\nple indicators of sleep, including sleep difficulties and para-\nsomnias, in a sample of young children placed in foster care\nafter being exposed to parental maltreatment. The investiga-\ntion of child history of maltreatment is an opportunity to\nuncover how these life experiences can relate to child sleep.\nThe tested hypothesis was that past experiences of abuse and\nplacement-related risk conditions, including foster caregiver\npsychological distress, would be related to poor quality of\nchild sleep.\nMethod\nParticipants\nTwenty-eight foster mothers and children (19 boys) were\nrecruited through Child Protection Services (CPS) in a small\nurban community in the province of Qu\u00e9bec (Canada) to par-\nticipate in a study evaluating the efficacy of a home-visiting\nrelationship-based intervention program. CPS agencies were\nasked to refer foster families who (a) were fostering a child\nbetween 36 and 84 months of age, (b) had been fostering the\nchild for at least 2 months, and (c) were engaged in long-\nterm foster care or in an eventual adoption. Only children\nwith severe organic developmental problems (e.g., cerebral\npalsy) were excluded from the study. Identification of fami-\nlies was accomplished through liaison with an employee of\nthe CPS who had legal access to family records. Between the\ninitial contact with foster mothers and the assessment, three\nchildren were removed from their foster family. Therefore,\nthe final sample included 25 dyads.\nChildren were on average 60.24 months of age (SD =\n57 years). All participants were Caucasian. Thirty-six per-\ncent of foster families had an income below Can$40,000,\nearned Can$75,000 or more. Mean income in Canada was\nCan$78,500 at the time of data collection, and the poverty\nInstitut de la statistique, 2012). Eighty-four percent of foster\nfamilies were composed of two parents (84% in the Canadian\npopulation), and 60% of foster mothers had completed a\npostsecondary education level (73.2% of woman in the\nCanadian population).\nMeasures and Procedure\nCPS employees initially approached eligible families and\nobtained their consent to transfer personal information to a\nresearch assistant. Those who accepted were contacted by a\nresearch assistant and received information about the\nresearch purposes. Prior to data collection, written consent\nwas obtained from foster and biological mothers who con-\nsented to their own and their child participation. The protocol\nwas approved by the Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Trois-Rivi\u00e8res's\nresearch ethics committee. Participating families completed\ninitial measures during a 1-hr laboratory visit in which foster\nmothers filled different questionnaires including child sleep.\nQuality of foster child's sleep. Foster caregivers were asked to\ncomplete Your Child Sleep, a questionnaire that was used in\na preschool sample of adopted children (Tessier, Larose,\nDubois-Comtois et al. 3\nMoss, Nadeau, & Tarabulsy, 2005). This questionnaire pro-\nvided information on total sleep time at night and during the\nday and on different child sleep characteristics that were\nrated by foster mothers on a 0 to 3 Likert-type scale (never/\nrarely, sometimes, most of the time, always). Three theoreti-\ncally driven indexes of sleep were computed by summing the\nscore (0-3) for each behavior/symptom included in the\nindexes: (a) the non-restorative sleep index includes difficul-\nties waking-up in the morning, sleepiness after final morning\nawakening, tiredness during the day, and falling asleep dur-\ning the day; (b) the poor sleep index includes having diffi-\nculty falling asleep, difficulty getting back to sleep following\nan awakening, and being anxious at night/afraid of darkness;\n(c) the parasomnia index includes body rocking, sleep brux-\nism, enuresis, bad dreams/nightmares, night terrors, and\nirregular breathing during sleep (see International Classifica-\ntion of Sleep Disorders\u00adThird Edition [ICSD-3]; AASM,\nParenting Stress Index (PSI\u00adShort Form). Foster mothers com-\npleted the 36-item PSI\u00adShort Form, a maternal self-report\nmeasure focusing on sources of perceived stress related to\nthe parental role (Abidin, 1995). Items are rated on a 0 to 5\nLikert-type scale and are summed to generate three scales:\nparental distress, parent-child dysfunctional interaction, and\ndifficult child. The PSI shows excellent internal consistency\nand convergent validity with respect to prenatal stress, other\nindices of postnatal stress, and the quality of parent-infant\ninteractions (Abidin, 1995). Good internal consistency was\nfound for the three scales in the current study (Cronbach's\nHistory of maltreatment and placement conditions. This infor-\nmation was retrieved from each child CPS record and\nincluded reasons for initial placement (i.e., substantiated\nabuse and/or neglect), age at initial placement, and total\nnumber of placements. Age at the time of placement in the\ncurrent foster family, type of foster home, and characteristics\nof the foster home (income, marital status, number of chil-\ndren) were obtained from foster mothers who completed a\nsociodemographic questionnaire. Type of foster home\nincluded regular non-kin foster care (placed with unknown\nadults), kinship foster care (placed with relatives), and fos-\nter-to-adopt families (placed to potentially be adopted).\nTable 1 presents characteristics of placement conditions and\nhistory of maltreatment.\nStatistical Analyses\nData manipulation and analysis was performed using the\nSPSS (Version 21.0.0.1; SPSS windows). Pearson correla-\ntion analyses were undertaken to evaluate associations\nbetween child sleep, history of maltreatment/placements,\nand foster mother parental stress. Given that all children\nin our sample were exposed to neglect, analyses on\nmaltreatment were only performed on physical and sexual\nabuse. According to Cohen, Cohen, West, and Aiken\n(2003), effect sizes, which provide a better interpretation\nof the results weight are preferred to statistical signifi-\ncance tests and are as follows: r  .1 represents a small\neffect size; r  .3 represents a medium effect size, and r \n.5 represents a large effect size. Marginal results (ps > .05\nto large effect sizes were reported.\nResults\nSleep Characteristics of Foster Children\nTable 2 presents the proportions of sleep conditions (habits\nand disturbances) in our sample. Proportions of participants\nhaving specific sleep conditions occurring sometimes to\nalways vary from 8% to 54%. Mean nocturnal sleep dura-\nincluding daytime sleep, was 11.22 hr. Scores on the\nindexes were normally distributed and suggest that in aver-\nage, children in our sample did not present high levels of\nsleep problems.\nANOVAs revealed no significant differences in sleep\n(duration and indexes) as a function of child gender, marital\nstatus, or income. Correlations revealed no significant asso-\nciations between sleep (duration and indexes) and foster\nmother age, or number of children in the foster family. Child\nage was significantly related to the parasomnia index,\nr = .53, p < .01, and marginally related to total sleep duration,\nr = -.36, p < .10, but unrelated to the other sleep variables.\nTo account for the impact of age on child sleep, subsequent\nanalyses were covaried with age.\nTable 1.

Several significant and marginally\nsignificant associations (medium to large effect sizes) were\nfound between sleep variables and maltreatment and place-\nment conditions.\nCorrelation analyses showed that the parasomnia index\nscores were significantly related to total sleep duration (r =\n-.45, p < .05) and marginally related to poor sleep index\nscores (r = .37, p < .10) but were not associated with the non-\nrestorative index scores. The non-restorative and poor sleep\nindexes were marginally interrelated (r = .36, p < 10) but\nwere not associated with sleep duration.\nShorter nocturnal sleep duration was related to earlier\nplacement and longer stay in the foster family (marginal), r =\n(nocturnal or over a 24-hr period) was not related to other\nplacement conditions or to history of abuse. Greater non-\nrestorative sleep index scores were significantly related to\ntime spent in the foster family (r = .44, p < .05) and two of the\nparental stress scales (maternal distress: r = .47, p < .05; dif-\nficult child: r = .56, p < .01), and marginally related to number\nof placements and sexual abuse, r = .41, p < .10. Higher\nscores on the poor sleep index were associated with past\nexperiences of sexual abuse (r = .50, p < .05) and with greater\nparenting stress (caregiver distress: r = .39, p < .10; difficult\nchild: r = .47, p < .05; dysfunctional interactions:\nr = .47, p < .05). Higher parasomnias index scores were\nrelated to earlier placement (r = -.42, p < .05) but unrelated to\nother placement conditions. Foster children sleep (duration\nand indexes) was not significantly related to past experiences\nof physical abuse and neglect or to type of foster family.\nPast experiences of physical abuse were marginally\nrelated to experiences of sexual abuse (r = .35, p < .10) and\nto children seen as being more difficult (r = .37, p < .10). Past\nexperiences of sexual abuse were also related to greater par-\nenting stress pertaining to child difficulty and dysfunctional\ninteractions, r = -.42, p < .05. Longer stay in the actual foster\nfamily was related to earlier initial placement (r = -.54, p <\n.01), and time spent in the foster home was associated with\nfoster parent distress (r = .55, p < .01).\nDiscussion\nThis exploratory study is the first to describe the association\nbetween history of maltreatment and caregivers reports of\nparenting stress and sleep quality and parasomnias of young\nchildren placed in foster families. Foster children in our\nstudy had a mean total sleep duration of 11.22 hr and a mean\nnocturnal sleep duration of 10.32 hr, which is more than what\nTable 2.

These results could suggest that after being placed in\na safe and stable environment, previously neglected children\npresent with adequate sleep duration. To that effect, it was\nshown in Tininenko et al. (2010) study that children living\nwith foster caregivers who received a preventive interven-\ntion addressing child socio-emotional needs had a longer\nsleep duration than children living in a regular foster family.\nIn our study with children living in a non-treatment foster\nfamily, shorter nocturnal sleep duration was related to earlier\nplacement and longer stay in the foster family. It is possible\nthat children exposed at an earlier age to very problematic\nhome environments have more difficulty to recoup sleep\nduration. Information about placement age was not available\nin Tininenko et al. (2010) study but earlier placements could\npossibly account for their sample's shorter nocturnal sleep\nduration. These results support the association between an\ninsecure and inconsistent environment and sleep disruption.\nOur results showed that greater non-restorative sleep\nindex scores were marginally related to more placements.\nChildren with multiple placements experienced more insta-\nbility and relationship disruptions, factors that have been\nassociated with anxiety (Taussig, 2002) and sleep disruptions\n(El-Sheikh, Buckhalt, Mize, & Acebo, 2006). In our study,\nhigher scores on the non-restorative sleep index were signifi-\ncantly related to foster mothers' distress and children diffi-\ncult behaviors. Because of its impact on behavioral regulation\nand control, inadequate amounts of sleep may affect chil-\ndren's behavioral and social adjustment during the day and\nvice versa (Touchette et al., 2009). It has been shown that\nchildren with disrupted sleep schedules had less positive and\nmore negative adjustment in preschool, even after consider-\ning the roles of family stress and parenting practices (Bates,\nViken, Alexander, Beyers, & Stockton, 2002). Not only does\nchildren's sleep disruption being related to their adaptation\nbut it is also associated with their parents' functioning.\nMothers of children who had significant sleep disruptions\nreported more parenting stress and caregiving overload\n(Meltzer & Mindell, 2007), similar to results found in our\nstudy.\nFindings of the current study also indicate that foster chil-\ndren showing higher scores on the non-restorative sleep and\npoor sleep indexes were more likely to have experienced\nsexual abuse. The latter association is quite impressive con-\nsidering its large effect size. Observed behaviors related to\nthe poor sleep index can be associated with inappropriate\nsleep associations in children or to inadequate limit setting\nby the caregiver. Given that nighttime and darkness may be\ndirectly associated with experiences of abuse (Sadeh, 1996),\nit is not surprising that foster children who were sexually\nabused show more anxiety and difficult behaviors around\nbedtime and during the night. Foster mothers of sexually\nabused children reported having more dysfunctional\ninteractions with them and described them has being more\ndifficult in general, which is consistent with findings of other\nstudies (Taylor & Brook, 1986). Because child abuse and\nneglect increases risk of developing posttraumatic stress dis-\norder (PTSD) and trauma symptoms in childhood (Milot,\n\u00c9thier, St-Laurent, & Provost, 2010), it is possible that sexu-\nally abused and neglected children in our sample are more\nlikely to experience emotional and behavioral disturbances\nboth during the day and the night because of such\nvulnerability.\nFoster children showing greater scores on the poor sleep\nindex were also more likely to have dysfunctional interac-\ntions and to show difficult behaviors, which is consistent\nwith findings from children living with their biological par-\nTaken all together, these studies show that sleep is sensitive\nto family context. Conversely, children's poor sleep may also\nimpede on the foster mother-child relationship. For these\nfamilies, fostering a child with difficulties falling asleep or\nwho is demanding because of sleep anxiety constitutes an\nadditional burden.\nIn our study, the parasomnia index was related to earlier\nplacements, suggesting, for these children, an earlier exposi-\ntion to pathogen family environments (e.g., domestic vio-\nlence, neglect, abuse). It is noteworthy that these children\nwere exposed at a younger stage of development to maltreat-\nment, a condition that is known to affect brain development\n(Cicchetti & Toth, 2005). One could hypothesize that the\nassociations found in the present study between sleep and\nplacement age or time spent in the foster home may be\nexplained by child age. Because age was included as a\ncovariate, the variance pertaining to child age was excluded\nfrom the equation, suggesting that placement age and time\nspent in the foster home have a unique influence on sleep.\nLimitations\nThis study has several limitations that are important to note.\nFirst, the assessment of child sleep relied on foster mother\nreport. Given that foster mothers may underestimate children\nsleep disturbances (Tikotzky & Sadeh, 2001), further studies\nshould include objective measures of sleep. Second, because\nof the cross-sectional nature of our data, the directionality of\nour findings is subject to debate. Third, the relatively small\nnumber of participants affected statistical power. It will be\nimportant to replicate the study findings on a larger sample\nand to follow children over a period of time to assess change\nin foster children sleep.\nConclusion\nThe current exploratory study sheds light on sleep quality\nand habits of young children placed in foster care after being\nexposed to child maltreatment. Age at initial placement,\nnumber of placements, past experiences of sexual abuse and\n6 SAGE Open\nneglect, and foster caregiver's level of parenting stress were\nall associated with poor quality of sleep. The significance of\nour findings is strengthened by the medium to large effect\nsizes, indicating statistical robustness despite the small sam-\nple size. Considering the impact of sleep disturbances on\nmultiple aspects of development, sleep disturbances could\nexacerbate developmental problems in foster children.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research and/or authorship of this article: This was not an\nindustry-supported study.
