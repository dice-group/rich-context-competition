    "abstract": "Abstract\nCompulsory voting is known to produce a relatively weak match between voters' ballot choices and their\npreferences. We theorize that this link, in part, exists because compelled voters are relatively unlikely to seek out\npolitical information during an election campaign, even after differences in political sophistication across compelled\nand voluntary voters are taken into account. To test our expectations, we use a simulation of an Australian election,\nthrough which we track participants' information searches. Our findings show that those who do not turn out\nvoluntarily under Australia's compulsory voting law tend to spend less time seeking out political information, and\nthey engage with less information. While differences in political sophistication between those who feel compelled\nto vote and those who do not account for a portion of this pattern, feeling compelled also has an independent\neffect on information seeking. This suggests that the negative relationship between compulsory voting and the\n\"quality\" of votes is partly due to the fact that those who are compelled to turn out expend less effort when\ndeciding how to cast their ballots.\n",

Do these compelled voters fail to cast\nwell-reasoned ballots strictly due to their relative lack of\npolitical sophistication, or do these choices reflect a lack\nof meaningful engagement?\nWe engage with these questions, theorizing that the link\nbetween compulsory voting and low-quality vote choices is\nmechanized by both voter sophistication levels and deci-\nsion-making processes. We expect that those who feel com-\npelled to vote expend systematically less effort when\nformulating their vote choices, as compared to those who\nturn out voluntarily, even after we take into account political\nsophistication.\nWe test our expectations with an election simulation, in\nwhich we track the behavior of a representative sample of\nabout 2000 Australians. Our findings show that those who\nreport being compelled by Australia's mandatory voting\nlaw tend to spend less time seeking out political informa-\ntion, and they engage with fewer pieces of information.\nWhile differences in political sophistication among com-\npelled and non-compelled voters account for a portion of\nthis pattern, feeling compelled also has an independent\neffect on the character of voters' information searches.\nFinally, using an experimental manipulation reported in\nthe supplementary material, we find no evidence that the\navailability of a simple heuristic, polling information,\nCompulsory voting and voter\ninformation seeking\nShane P.

Ironing out sophistication-based cleavages\nin turnout can accentuate these same disparities in the vot-\ning population. This is consequential because those with-\nout substantial knowledge about politics are least able to\nuse political information in a way that allows them to cast\nmeaningful ballots (Zaller, 1992), and unsophisticated vot-\ners are less likely to select the party that best matches their\npreferences (Lau et al., 2008). Such patterns suggest that\nlow-quality vote choices will be relatively common where\nturnout is mandatory, a pattern found in many extant stud-\nies (e.g., Dassonneville et al., Hooghe and Miller, 2017;\nTheory and hypotheses\nWe seek to understand how compulsory voting weakens the\nmatch between voters' choices and their preferences. For\nus, much of this link is due to differences in the decision-\nmaking processes of voluntary and compelled voters. Any\nsuch differences should matter for the quality of vote\nchoices, as individuals who expend little effort arriving at\ntheir decisions are less likely to cast votes that are well-\nmatched with their preferences (Lau and Redlawsk, 1997;\nWhen individuals are forced into a behavior, their motiva-\ntion for engagement lessens (Deci, 1975), and coercion and\npunishment are linked to defiance, lower levels of cognitive\nengagement, and less interest in one's tasks (e.g., Sherman,\nfound to magnify and entrench resentment of the democratic\nthat compulsory voting increases invalid voting (e.g., Katz\nand Levin, forthcoming; Power and Garand, 2007; Singh,\n2017) reinforces the notion that those who are compelled to\nparticipate in elections are less motivated to formulate a\nmeaningful vote. This leads to our first hypothesis:\nHypothesis 1: Relative to voluntary voters, those who\nfeel compelled to vote are less likely to seek out political\ninformation.\nIndividuals who vote because of external coercion are\nmore likely to be politically unsophisticated (Dassonneville\npolitically unsophisticated individuals are less likely to\nengage with politically relevant information (Lau and\nRedlawsk, 2006). This suggests that at least part of compul-\nsory voting's effect on information seeking is driven by\npolitical sophistication.\nHowever, compulsory voting's production of defiance\ntoward, and resentment of, the democratic system likely less-\nens political information seeking in the voting population\nindependent of sophistication. That is, those who are nega-\ntively oriented toward the democratic system, even if politi-\ncally sophisticated, are unlikely to engage with campaign\ninformation. Moreover, compulsory voting brings to the vot-\ning booth individuals who prefer fringe, outsider, or anti-\nsystem parties or candidates (B\u00e9langer, 2004; Carreras,\nnon-mainstream options are not necessarily less politically\nsophisticated, they will have little desire to learn about the\ncompetitors to their preferred parties or candidates. Thus,\nwhile one's level of political sophistication likely drives\nsome of the hypothesized negative link between voter com-\npulsion and information seeking, voter compulsion should\nalso have an effect independent of sophistication. This leads\nto our second hypothesis:\nHypothesis 2: The effects of feeling compelled to vote\non information seeking are partially driven by political\nsophistication.\nThe election simulation\nTo test our hypotheses, we simulated an Australian fed-\neral election in April of 2016.2 Participants were pre-\nsented with links to information on the actual issue\npositions of Australia's four main political parties (as\nconveyed on official websites). They were able to access\nparty platforms and positions with respect to five policy\ndomains by clicking on the links. Unbeknownst to the\nparticipants, we recorded the amount of time they spent\ngathering information and each link they accessed. This\nallows us to create two separate measures of information\nseeking: the amount of time spent seeking information;\nand the number of information links accessed. Figure 1\nprovides a screen capture of the election simulation, and\nFigure 2 illustrates the distributions of the two measures\nof information seeking, which are used below as our\ndependent variables.\nTo populate our studies, we hired Survey Sampling\nInternational, a private international firm that specializes in\nonline sampling. Random sampling was performed within\nstrata for age, education, gender, and household income to\nhelp ensure the sample was reflective of the population in\naccordance with these characteristics. 2220 Australian par-\nticipants completed the simulation. We obtained approval\nfrom the Research Ethics Board of Wilfrid Laurier\nUniversity in Ontario, Canada, before beginning our study,\nSingh and Roy 3\nand all participants gave informed consent before proceed-\ning to our simulation.\nMeasuring feelings of compulsion and\npolitical sophistication\nOur primary independent variable is feelings of compulsion\nto vote. All eligible voters are legally required to vote in\nAustralia,3 which means that we cannot compare voters\nsubject to compulsory and voluntary rules. However, we\nare able to gain leverage on the extent to which one feels\ncompelled to vote with a well-established counterfactual\napproach. To determine the extent to which an individual\nturns out to vote against his or her own volition, we asked\ntwo questions as part of a survey that preceded the election\nsimulation. The first asked: \"In federal elections, are you\ncertain to vote, likely, unlikely, or certain not to vote?\" The\nsecond asked: \"If voting were no longer mandatory in\nAustralia, would you be certain to vote, likely, unlikely, or\ncertain not to vote in the next federal election?\"\nAs a first step, we retain only the participants who\nreported being likely or certain to vote under Australia's\ncompulsory voting law. We then classify those who would\nalso certainly vote under voluntary voting as \"Voluntary\nVoters,\"thosewhowouldlikelyvoteas\"SlightlyCompelled\nVoters,\" those who would be unlikely to vote as \"Moderately\nFigure 1. A screen capture of the election simulation.\nFigure 2. The distributions of the dependent variables.\nNote: both variables gathered by tracking the behavior of participants in the election simulation.\n4 Research and Politics \nCompelled Voters,\" and those who would certainly not vote\nunder voluntary voting as \"Strongly Compelled Voters.\"4\nA host of extant studies of compulsory voting use this\ntype of counterfactual approach (e.g., B\u00e9langer, 2004;\nHellwig and McAllister, 2016; Hooghe and Pelleriaux,\ncussion of its strengths. They also note, however, that the\ncounterfactual approach may suffer from the effects of\nsocial desirability bias. Those who are willing to take part\nin an election study may also be hesitant to express a pref-\nerence for abstention (Jackman, 1999). This would suggest\nthat our counterfactual measurement strategy understates\nany differences between \"voluntary\" and \"compelled\" vot-\ners. Such social desirability effects would make it harder\nfor us to find support for our hypotheses.\nWe measured political sophistication in the pre-simula-\ntion survey. Scholars often consider individuals to be politi-\ncally sophisticated if they both have political knowledge\nand are willing to put that knowledge to use (see Fiske\nsophistication to consist not only of existing political\nknowledge, but also of political interest. We gauged politi-\ncal interest using scores on a self-reported 0\u00ad10 scale,5 and\nwe measured political knowledge as the number of correct\nanswers in a series of four trivia-type questions.6 To create\nour sophistication measure, we standardized both measures\nto zero mean and unit variance and summed them.\nResults\nOur first hypothesis puts forth that voters who feel com-\npelled to the polls are less likely to seek out political infor-\nmation than voluntary voters. To test this, we regress our\ntwo dependent variables, the number of minutes spent gath-\nering information and the number of information links\naccessed, on voter compulsion. In the model with the num-\nber of minutes spent as the dependent variable, we use lin-\near regression,7 and we use negative binomial regression in\nthe model in which the number of information links\naccessed is the dependent variable.8 We use dummy varia-\nbles for each category of voter compulsion as covariates,\nand we exclude \"Voluntary Voters\" as the reference cate-\ngory. Data on each of our variables were available for 1917\nparticipants.\nThe top panels of Figures 3 and 4 illustrate the results\nof the regressions, which provide support for our first\nhypothesis. In each graph, it is clear that feeling com-\npelled decreases political information seeking. For exam-\nple, the results shown in the top panel of Figure 3 show\nthat \"Slightly Compelled Voters\" are expected to spend\nabout 18 fewer seconds gathering information than those\nwho turn out voluntarily, \"Moderately Compelled Voters\"\nFigure 3. Time spent gathering political information and voter compulsion.\nNote: estimates are from two separate linear regressions, and the horizontal lines represent 90% confidence intervals. The horizontal axis depicts\nthe difference in expected number of minutes a participant spent gathering information during the election simulation, relative to those who vote\nvoluntarily. The independent variable, which appears on the vertical axis, is a categorical measure of the extent to which a participant feels com-\npelled by Australia's compulsory voting law to participate in elections. The regression depicted in the bottom panel includes a control for political\nsophistication, which is measured as an index of political interest and knowledge. Numerical results of the regression models depicted in Figure 3\nare provided in Appendix E in the supplementary material.\nSingh and Roy 5\nspend an average of about 26 fewer seconds gathering\ninformation, and \"Strongly Compelled Voters\" spend\nabout 45 fewer seconds gathering information, on aver-\nage. The results shown in the top panel of Figure 4 depict\na very similar pattern with regard to the expected number\nof information links accessed. \"Slightly Compelled\nVoters\" are expected to click on about 0.57 fewer links\nthan those who turn out voluntarily, \"Moderately\nCompelled Voters\" click an average of about 1.05 fewer\nlinks, and \"Strongly Compelled Voters\" click about 1.70\nfewer links, on average. Both plots demonstrate that the\neffect of compulsion on information acquisition is pro-\ngressively larger among those who feel more compelled\nby the mandatory voting law, a pattern that is unlikely to\ncome about purely due to chance.9\nOur second hypothesis puts forth that, while voter\ncompulsion has an independent effect on information\nseeking, political sophistication drives only part of this\nlink. There is a straightforward empirical implication of\nthis expectation: adding a control for political sophistica-\ntion to models predicting information seeking as a func-\ntion of voter compulsion should decrease the magnitude\nof the coefficients on the covariates that capture feelings\nof compulsion. To test this, we re-estimate the models\ndepicted in the top panels of Figures 3 and 4, with our\nmeasure of political sophistication added to the right-hand\nside of the regression equations.\nResults are depicted in the bottom panels of Figures 3\nand 4. Starting with Figure 3, it is apparent that the effect\nof each category of compulsion on the expected number of\nminutes a participant spent gathering information is\nsmaller once political sophistication is taken into account.\nHowever, each effect is still statistically different from\nzero, which indicates that voter compulsion also has an\neffect independent of sophistication. The pattern in Figure\n4, in which the dependent variable is the number of infor-\nmation links accessed, is similar. The effect of each cate-\ngory of compulsion on the expected number of links\naccessed by a participant attenuates once political sophis-\ntication is accounted for. In fact, the effects of being\n\"Slightly Compelled\" and \"Moderately Compelled,\" rela-\ntive to voting voluntarily, are not distinguishable from zero\nwith sophistication taken into account. However, \"Strongly\nCompelled Voters\" are still expected to access fewer links\nthan those who turned out by their own volition, even once\nwe account for political sophistication. These patterns pro-\nvide support for Hypothesis 2.\nWe posit above that the link from feeling compelled to\ninformation seeking is only partially driven by political\nsophistication because, while compulsory voting increases\nparticipation among the less politically sophisticated, it\nalso induces defiance and resentment of the democratic\nsystem, and it brings to the voting booth individuals who\nprefer fringe, outsider, or anti-system parties or candidates.\nFigure 4. The amount of political information gathered and voter compulsion.\nNote: estimates are from two separate negative binomial regressions, and the horizontal lines represent 90% confidence intervals. The horizontal\naxis depicts the difference in expected number of information links accessed by a participant during the election simulation, relative to those who\nvote voluntarily. The independent variable, which appears on the vertical axis, is a categorical measure of the extent to which a participant feels\ncompelled by Australia's compulsory voting law to participate in elections. The regression depicted in the bottom panel includes a control for politi-\ncal sophistication, which is measured as an index of political interest and knowledge. Numerical results of the regression models depicted in Figure 4\nare provided in Appendix E in the supplementary material.\n6 Research and Politics \nWe find empirical support for these proposed mechanisms\nin tests detailed in Appendix A in the supplementary\nmaterial.\nWe also account for the possibility that the estimated\neffects of the categories of compulsion depicted in the bot-\ntom panels of Figures 3 and 4 may not be completely\nwashed of political sophistication; while we argue that\nthere are factors associated with being compelled that\ndecrease information acquisition independent of sophisti-\ncation, these may in fact themselves be due to a lack of\npolitical sophistication. To estimate the unique effects of\nfeelings of compulsion with this possibility taken into\naccount, we use inverse probability weighting to simulate a\nscenario in which individuals are randomly \"treated\" with\ncompelled voting. Results, shown in Appendix B, are simi-\nlar to those depicted in the bottom panels of Figures 3 and\n4, which bolsters our argument that a portion of compul-\nsion's effect on information seeking is unrelated to political\nsophistication.\nFinally, we explore the role of heuristics in the rela-\ntionship between feelings of compulsion and informa-\ntion seeking. Within our simulation, we conducted an\nexperiment in which we randomly treated participants\nwith the availability of polling information. We found no\nevidence that access to polling results conditions the size\nof the differences in information acquisition between\nvoters who feel compelled and those who do not. The\neffects of voter compulsion on both types of information\nseeking were not consistently larger in magnitude for\ntreated individuals, and they were never statistically dif-\nferent from the effects calculated among those in the\ncontrol group. We elaborate on our experimental design\nand consider potential reasons for these non-findings in\nAppendix C.\nConclusion\nOur findings bring to light a mechanism driving the com-\nmonly uncovered link between compulsory voting and\nvotes that are poorly representative of preferences (e.g.,\nout because of external coercion spend less time and effort\nformulating their choices. This link exists in part because\nvoters who feel compelled are less sophisticated politically,\nbut feelings of compulsion also independently diminish the\ninformation search.\nTo be sure, as we study the effects of compulsory vot-\ning within a single country that uses compulsory voting,\nwe have not shown that information levels are generally\nlower in countries where turning out is mandatory. A\nnumber of studies report evidence of a positive link\nbetween compulsory voting and political knowledge in\nthe population (e.g., Sheppard, 2015; Shineman, forth-\ncoming), others suggest that this relationship is stronger\nin, or exclusive to, certain subgroups (e.g., Carreras,\ntle or no evidence of any such link (e.g., de Leon and\nWhile our findings show that those who feel cajoled into\nvoting in a compulsory system are less likely to seek out\ninformation than those who participate voluntarily, they\ndo not necessarily indicate that voters in compulsory sys-\ntems are less politically informed than their counterparts\nin voluntary systems. The scholarly debate over this\npotential link persists.\n"
