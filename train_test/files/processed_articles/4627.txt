The University Hospital for Active\nTreatment, ``Dr Georgi Stranski'', which is\nlocated in the city of Pleven, is the main\nhealthcare centre in the Northwest region of\nBulgaria. The population in this region\n7.2% of the population of Bulgaria. The\nlatest data released by the World Health\nOrganization show that cardiovascular dis-\nease is the leading cause of death world-\nwide.1 Data from the National Statistical\nInstitute shows a similar trend for Bulgaria.2\ncaused by diseases of the cardiovascular\nsystem. In the emergency aid system, analy-\nsis of epidemiological indicators is one of the\nessential tools for process management.1,2,3\nOutpatient and inpatient mortality have\nstudies on the causes of death in EDs in\nBulgaria using data from autopsy reports\nand the definite cause of death.\nAim: This study aimed to identify the\ndemographic patterns of mortality, the time\nspent before death in the ED, and the causes\nof fatal outcomes in an ED in Bulgaria.\nMethods: We performed a 5-year retro-\nJanuary, 2016 of all non-traumatic deaths in\nthe ED of the University Hospital for Active\nTreatment in Pleven. To extract the neces-\nsary information, we used the registers in the\nhospital information system, outpatient\njournals, outpatient sheets, consultation\nsheets, and autopsy reports. From these,\nwe collected information on the demographic\nindicators, causes of death, and the length of\ntime from a patient's admission in the ED\nuntil death. To analyse the data, we performed\ndescriptive, variational, and graphical analysis\nmethods, as well as tests for identifying\ndependencies using MS Excel (Data Analysis\nTool Pack) and SPSS software products.\nOutcomes and discussion\nED of the University Hospital ``Dr. Georgi\nStranski'' in Pleven (Figure 1). Among\nthese, 381 of them died, despite conducting\nresuscitation. The mortality rate was 2.4/\nIn 350 deaths, an autopsy was performed,\nand then each case was discussed at a clinical\nmeeting in the ED to eliminate errors and\noptimize the protocols of behaviour. No\nautopsy was performed in only 31 people at\nthe insistence of relatives.\nIn the 350 people who died and had an\nautopsycarriedout,distributionbysexshowed\na prevalence of men. According to admission\nrecords, more than 2/3 of the patients were\nbrought to the ED by Emergency Medical Aid\nCentre (EMAC) teams.\nA total of 139 people died of acute\nmyocardial infarction (AMI). AMI was the\nmost common cause of sudden death in the\nED and represented 39.7% of the total\nmortality in this department.\nThe mortality rate of AMI ranged from\n20 to 35 deaths per year or approximately\nthree per month (Figure 3). The average age\nof people who died from AMI was 73.1\nyears, with a male prevalence. The number\nof people brought to the ED by the EMAC\nteam was almost twice that of those who\nsought help themselves. The average stay of\nthese patients in the resuscitation area was\nafter staying in the ED for shorter than 1 h\nand 28 who were brought by EMAC teams\nwere in a state of clinical death.\nCompared with the total mortality in the\ndepartment there was a direct correlation\n(p=1). The number of deaths due to AMI\nwas constant (35%39% of deaths in the ED)\nin each year of the 5-year period ( figure 3.)\nThe second leading cause of death in\nthe 350 people who were autopsied was\npulmonary embolism (PE). A total of 44\nFigure 1. Comparison between the persons examined and the deaths in the Emergency Department for\nthe period 2011\u00ad2015. The chart shows clearly that the annual increase in the number of examinations\ncorrelate with the number of deaths. The two lines \u00ad of those examined and those who died are almost\nidentical.\nFigure 2. Graphic presentation of the main cause of death in autopsy reports of patients in the study period.\n(12.6%) people died because of PE during\nthe study period (Figures 2 and 4).\nPatients with PE were mainly brought\nto the ED by EMAC teams (n \u00bc 34). Ten\npatients with PE sought help by their own\nmeans.\nUnlike patients who died from AMI, in\npatients with PE, there was no significant\ndifference in the distribution of sex. A total\nof 52% of patients with PE were men. The\naverage age of patients who died from PE\nwas 71 years. The youngest patient with PE\nFigure 3. Comparison between the number of deaths from AMI and total mortality in the Emergency\nDepartment during the study period.\nFigure 4. Comparison between the number of deaths from PE and total mortality in the Emergency\nDepartment during the study period.\nwas 37 years old and the oldest was 92 years.\nThe average stay in the resuscitation area\nto the ED was less than 1 h, and 20 of them\nwere brought in a state of clinical death with\nimmediate initiation of cardiopulmonary\nresuscitation. In analysis of the autopsy\nreports and outpatient sheets, we observed\nthat the teams in the ED suspected PE\nfor only 14 deaths. In the other patients,\nthe clinical diagnosis (observation) was dif-\nferent (Table 2).\nThis finding suggested that there is\nan ineffective mechanism for recognizing\nthe symptoms of the second most common\ncause of death in the ED. Non-use of some\nTable 2. Clinical diagnosis (before autopsy) of death from PE.\nShock PE AMI Pneumonia Stroke AHF Other\nTable 1.

These\ndata are similar to data from other\nstudies that investigated the causes of\nCommunity-acquired pneumonia\n(Figure 5) was the third most common\nTable 3.

Comparison of the number of deaths from community-acquired pneumonia and total mortality in\nthe Emergency Department during the study period.\ncause of death in the ED in our study.\nDespite all efforts, acute respiratory failure\nthat occurred due to an inflammatory lung\ndisease was the cause of death of 38 people\nover the 5-year period, or nearly 10% of all\ndeaths in the ED.\nThe mortality rate of patients with\ncommunity-acquired pneumonia ranged\nbetween 5 and 9 people per year, and the\naverage age of death was 67.3 years. There was\na high prevalence of male sex in these patients,\ncomprising 29 men and only nine women. The\naverage stay of a patient in the resuscitation\narea until the time of death was 2:18h.\nAmong the main causes of mortality,\n7.4% of the deaths in the ED were due to\nadvanced carcinomas (Table 4). A lack of\ncomprehensive care for patients with cancer\nin Bulgaria forces the relatives of these\npatients to seek help in the ED.\nDuring the 5-year study period, 40 people\ndied of acute diseases of the gastrointestinal\ntract, comprising 11% of the total mortality.\nThe most common cause of this mortality\nwas GI bleeding in 24 patients. The average\nage of these patients was 70.4 years, with a\nfemale prevalence (58%). The average stay\nin the resuscitation area was 1:34 h.\ndue to other causes.\nAortic dissection, ischaemic and haemor-\nrhagic stroke, and sepsis were relatively\nsimilar in prevalence, with 10 to 16 cases in\nthe 5-year study period.\nThe least common causes of death in the\nED were frostbite in one patient (man, 75\nyears old) who died in 2011, and cardiac\ntamponade in one patient (woman, 83 years\npicture of cardiogenic shock.\nTable 5.

The Canadian\nEmergency Ultrasound Society recom-\nmends that all emergency physicians\ntake a course in emergency ultrasound.\nTo obtain a certificate, they are\nrequired to perform at least 50 scans\nin each of the following four cate-\ngories: the heart, to exclude pericardial\ntamponade; the aorta, to measure its\ndiameter to exclude aneurysm/dissec-\ntion; the abdomen, to detect freely\nflowing liquid; and the uterus, to\nexclude ectopic pregnancy.\n(7) One of the main causes of mortality is\noncological pathology. A lack of com-\nprehensive care for patients with cancer\nin Bulgaria forces the relatives of these\npatients to seek help in the ED where\nthey die.\n(8) Discussing cases at clinical meetings\nin the ED, and comparing the clinical\nand pathological-anatomical diagnosis\ncontribute to eliminating errors and\noptimizing the protocols of behaviour.\nFunding\nThis study was supported by a grant from the\nMedical University \u00ad Pleven, grand number is\nReferences\n1.
