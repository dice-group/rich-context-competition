It demonstrates the variety of actors, settings and the variable\nneed for knowing collaboration between co-offenders in frauds of\ndifferent types. It explores what is known about those involved in\nthe organization of some forms of frauds; how they find both\nco-offenders and victims in face-to-face and remote settings; and\nthe barriers to growth of the `fraud business'. It concludes that the\nglobalization of crime is part of contingent relationships between\nsettings, with their rich and varied opportunities (reflecting patterns\nof business, consumer and investment activities), the variable\nabilities of would-be perpetrators to recognize and act on those\nopportunities (the `crime scripts' perspective), and their interactions\nwith controls (including, but not restricted to, law enforcement).\nConstructs of `organized crime' are becoming less obsessed with the\nstructure of groups than with what people need from the largely\nillicit and largely licit worlds before they commit fraud. Although\nsome frauds are committed by generic transnational `organized\ncrime' networks, others are merely mobile small groups or\nindividuals who can transplant techniques wherever they go; and\nothers still commit very large one-off frauds without a need for\nlong-term or any involvement in `organized crime'.\n",

But the relative (in)access-\nibility of fraud networks to outsiders is also a factor, since frauds (and other\ncrimes) differ in the way that they are open for marketing, and in the inter-\naction between the parties. In this article, we examine the settings for\nfrauds, which both frames and reflects networks, in the context of fraud\nopportunities and of a victim-centric typology (Table 1, adapted from Levi\nand Burrows, 2008). This demonstrates the variety of actors, settings and\n(less clearly) need for collaboration in frauds of different types. In the\nprocess, we explore what is known about those involved in the organiza-\ntion of frauds, though the space available (as well as our knowledge) con-\nstrains the number of fraud types that can be discussed.\nOrganizing frauds\nTwo important themes in analysing the extent to which crimes are loosely or\ntightly organized are (1) the ease with which willing criminals find the\nco-offenders necessary or helpful for any given set of offences; and (2) the\nbreaking down of the elements of criminal organization into its component\nparts (i.e. what is termed `script analysis'3 by Cornish, 1994; Cornish and\nClarke, 2002). These themes also reflect the tension (in this article and more\ngenerally--see Levi, 2007) between writing about the personnel involved in\nfrauds (the networks) and what it takes to commit frauds (the scripts). It is\nhelpful to think of the tasks that need to be performed to commit serious\nfrauds (and other crimes) and the range of places where they need to be and\nare performed. (For all the talk about `the' globalization of `crime', some of\nthese tasks are as easily accomplished at a local or regional level as they are\ntransnationally, at least in some jurisdictions.) A higher level `script analysis'\nof crime for gain might look like the following, with more specific frauds\nhaving their own `scripts' and variable necessities to find co-offenders.\nWhen analysing the dynamics of particular crimes and/or criminal careers,\nthese procedural elements can be broken down further into much more con-\ncrete steps and the relationships between their criminal participants analysed\nical efforts). These steps are not necessarily sequential: for example, we may\nsee a financial crime4 opportunity only when we meet accountants or lawyers\nwho are able to facilitate it, or we may already have in place all the steps as\npart of our ongoing `criminal enterprise'. Criminal finance, some or all crim-\ninal personnel or the `tools of crime' (from non-transparent companies to\ncredit cards) may come from or go to another country, constituting `trans-\nnational' crimes; or else remain within one country, constituting `national'\nCriminology & Criminal Justice 8(4)\nLevi\u00ad\u00adOrganized fraud and organizing frauds 391\nTable 1.

The coun-\nterfeiting of intellectual property counts as fraud only if the vendor represents it as being the\ngenuine manufacturer's product (or, arguably, if the purchaser believes it to be genuine).\nOtherwise it may be a loss of the manufacturer's property rights, but no-one is defrauded: the\nmanufacturer loses principally if the purchaser would have bought the legitimate product at\nthe price offered for it, but also if there is collateral damage to the product's reputation.\ncrimes.5 In the case of fraud, offenders may start with differential access to\nlocal, national or international resources, but the exploitation of inter-state\nand international regulatory and criminal justice asymmetries--e.g. different\nlevels of enforcement in the states or countries in which the fraudsters oper-\nate--represents a positive advantage for fraud compared with most other\ncrimes. In this article, I shall seek to combine the scripts with a brief analysis\nof the sorts of networks involved in them.\nApplying the sort of script found in Box 1, would-be fraudsters have to\nfind `marks' to target with their schemes,6 and develop techniques for get-\nting them to part with their money voluntarily: the hallmark of fraud. Some\nsuch offences occur (at least in part) face to face; others are done remotely;\nwhile others still may start technologically (with a letter or an e-mail) and\nend with some interpersonal contact. Let us take as an example of the lat-\nter `419 frauds', so called after section 419 of the Nigerian criminal code.\nThere are few e-mail users who have never encountered scam e-mails--\nwhich usually arrive from a yahoo or hotmail address--offering them vast\nwealth if only they will help their previously unacquainted banker/relative\nCriminology & Criminal Justice 8(4)\n1. See a situation as a `financial crime opportunity'\n2. Obtain whatever finance is needed for the crime\n3. Find people willing and able to offend (if necessary for the crimes\ncontemplated) and who are controllable and reliable\n4. Obtain any equipment/data needed to offend\n5. Carry out offences in domestic and/or overseas locations with or\nwithout physical presence in jurisdiction(s). This will usually involve\nmanipulating--with varied degrees of complexity, technology and\ninterpersonal communication skills--victims' perceptions of `what is\nhappening'\n6. Minimize immediate enforcement/operational risks. Especially if\nplanning to repeat frauds, neutralize law enforcement by technical\nskill, by corruption, and/or by legal arbitrage, using legal obstacles to\nenforcement operations and prosecutions which vary between States\n7. Convert, where necessary (e.g. where goods rather than money are\nobtained on credit), products of crime into money or other usable\nassets\n8. Find people and places willing to store proceeds (and perhaps trans-\nmit and conceal their origin)\n9. Decide which jurisdiction(s) offers the optimal balance between\nsocial/physical comfort and the risk of asset forfeiture/criminal justice\nsanctions. Indifference in any one State or sub-state arena may suf-\nfice to neutralize an investigation, and staffing inadequacies as well\nas corruption may be the cause of official inaction.\nBox 1. The process of fraud and other crimes for gain\nLevi\u00ad\u00adOrganized fraud and organizing frauds 393\nof a deceased corrupt dictator put their `dormant account' or `unknown to\nthe authorities but at risk' money into their own account for 25\u00ad40 per cent\nof the `take' (usually $25 billion). Some data can be harvested for `identity\nfraud' but the victim is often persuaded to pay `advance fees' to remove\nblockages in the funds transfers, and may even be lured to Nigeria or some\nother country to pay out more. One of the ironies is that Nigerians are\nutilizing their stereotype of corruption in order to make the proposition\nmore plausible to their intended `marks'. Such propositions used to be made\nby letter (sometimes using counterfeit stamps to reduce operating costs) but\nare now more often made by e-mail, which is almost free. By contrast, other\nfrauds such as lottery scams may have quite elaborate and convincing\npaperwork delivered by bulk mail, often from Spain: although the authori-\nties may be able to identify such scam letters prior to delivery, legal prohib-\nitions on interference with the mail (plus commercial interests insofar as\nthey are paid by the distributors) prevent them from stopping distribution\nunless the stamps themselves are counterfeit. Such lottery scams (whether\nby mail or e-mail) seldom involve interpersonal contact.\nWe can see from the Box 1 process map (or `script') one important dif-\nference between frauds and most traditional crimes that have victims: at the\ntime when the offence is committed (which, in contrast with other property\noffences, may happen undetected continuously over years), the fraudster\ncan be but does not normally need to be in the same place or even the same\ncontinent as the victims or their property. However, few frauds need to be\nexecuted on an international basis, and some fraudsters (like gangsters)\nhave their domestic geographic comfort zones, even to the level of the shops\nin which they prefer to use stolen cards and those they avoid (Levi,\n2003[p1]). It is quicker for a credit card fraudster or telemarketer to get a\ntrain from London to Paris than from London to Liverpool, and that can\nbe important when the rate of fraud upon a stolen or counterfeited card is\ntime-critical. Rising fuel costs notwithstanding, it is easy and relatively\ncheap to fly to many parts of the world, even if one is buying the ticket with\na genuine credit card or cash (which may be the proceeds of past crimes).\nHowever in many other cases, speed of action is unimportant because there\nis a long elapsed time between the commission of fraud and its detection by\nthe victim or by a third party: the latter includes American Express, Visa or\nMasterCard (for payment card frauds); Dun and Bradstreet or Experian\n(for personal and commercial credit frauds); and the UK Financial Services\nAuthority, Office of Fair Trading and other regulators (for investment\nfrauds, `market abuse' and consumer scams). Choice of offender or victim\nlocation is determined by other factors (such as the large number of rela-\ntively wealthy but still anxious elderly people in Florida or the south-east of\nEngland). In the larger cases, professional intermediaries and bank accounts\nare necessary components in presenting a plausible front and in obtaining\nand laundering the funds; in others, cash may be wired via money service\nbureaux (like Western Union) or by `underground banking' (Passas, 2005)\nto foreign or sometimes domestic locations.\nWhat is different about frauds compared with other crimes? First, as\nresearchers since Cressey (1955) have shown, most professionals are\nalready in a position to commit major frauds such as embezzlement by\nvirtue of their legitimate jobs. (One may add to Cressey's rather individual-\noriented approach that few finance directors and CEOs will have their\n`instructions to pay' questioned by subordinates: so they too do not need\nactive conspirators--merely that the ciphers they have appointed follow\norders.) Second, whether as (i) individuals and/or as (ii) corporate actors,\nthey are less likely to be suspected as being `out of place'--as Felson (2002,\n2006) might put it, their camouflage is already there--both as transactors\nin the business deal and as movers of illicit funds after the fact. The latter\nis connected to the third point, which is that most (but not all) frauds\nobtain money in electronic form, and therefore have less need to deposit\nand transfer large cash sums, which more readily arouse suspicions among\nthe ever-larger number of bodies (not just banks and building societies but\nalso now antique dealers, car dealers, estate agents, and jewellers), who\nhave a criminal law obligation to report to a Financial Intelligence Unit\n(SOCA in the UK) `suspicious transactions'.7 The imagery of cash and drugs\ntrafficking still predominates in the anti-money laundering arena, despite\nthe expansion of the legal mandate to include all crimes. (See further, Levi\nOne more point is noteworthy. There is a temptation--especially in work\non `organized crime'--to see the stages above as being part of a conscious\nplan: a preconceived strategy of deception (thus replicating the process of\n`case construction' by police and prosecutors when preparing for court).\nHowever this can be a mistake. In The Phantom Capitalists (Levi, 2008a,\noriginally 1981), I suggested the utility of looking at bankruptcy and other\nfrauds in terms of a threefold typology:\n(1) pre-planned frauds, in which the business scheme is set up from the start as\na way of defrauding victims (businesses, public sector and/or individuals)\n(2) intermediate frauds, in which people started out obeying the law but con-\nsciously turned to fraud later; and\n(3) slippery-slope frauds, in which deceptions spiralled, often in the context of\ntrying--however absurdly and over-optimistically--to rescue an insolvent\nbusiness or set of businesses that in reality had no hope of repaying its\ndebts in the future.\nIn short, motivation to defraud can be heterogeneous rather than a sin-\ngle phenomenon; and (where physical identification is not an issue) planned\nfraudsters have an interest in pretending to be slippery-slopers or honest-\nbut-unlucky, to minimize the chances of prosecution, conviction and impris-\nonment, thus reversing prosecutors' case constructions. As with Cressey's\nembezzlers, existing business people have comparatively little problem in\norganizing funds transfers out of the company and/or bankruptcy fraud\n(although the disposal of large amounts of goods very quickly may be\ndifficult--one may need an apparently legitimate or large scale illegitimate\nCriminology & Criminal Justice 8(4)\ntrader to perform a brokerage role in disposal).8 Once people are willing to\nrisk whatever ethical and social sanctions might be expected,9 the key prac-\ntical problem is organizing the escape from criminal sanctions and proceeds\nof crime recovery by creditors or state. These measures may involve willing\ncollaborators and/or innocent third parties, or a combination (including the\ncoalition of the willing pretending to be innocent and often remaining\nunchallenged). People can use corporations or professions as a means to\nattain fraudulent ends, and can do so either at the start (pre-planned fraud)\nor as an afterthought in a changed situation. The corporations can be sub-\nstantive and real or mere fronts or shells for the perpetration of fraud. But\npeople can also commit frauds against companies and the government as\noutsiders or from more junior positions. An example follows:\nJagmeet Channa, a charity volunteer from a middle-class family and with no\nprevious criminal convictions, who had been employed at HSBC headquar-\nters first on a short term contract 10 months earlier, was sentenced to nine\nyears in prison for attempting to steal \u00a372 million from HSBC in April 2008.\nOne Friday, Channa authorized two seemingly straightforward transactions\nin transfers to accounts at Barclays in Manchester and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale in\nCasablanca, using passwords stolen from colleagues. Transcripts of tele-\nphone calls made from his HSBC landline that evening reveal a series of calls\ninforming several people that the fraud was a triumph. Attempts to uncover\ntheir identities proved fruitless because they were using pay-as-you-go hand-\nsets, which were not already being monitored. Just after lunchtime on the\nSunday, Channa's plan fell apart. Banking security officials in Malaysia had\nnoted a double transaction, prompting `cause for concern'. Channa had used\na global financial holding account where vast amounts are paid in and then\nremoved. At the close of daily trading, the account should register zero, but\nChanna had inexplicably forgotten to change it and his holding account was\nshowing a massive debt. It was an elementary error that, if Channa had\navoided it, might have allowed him to pull off his record-breaking crime.10\nChanna's decision to execute the crime on a Friday had compounded his mis-\ntake. With trading frozen over weekends, security officials find it much eas-\nier to detect anomalies. Had Channa committed the fraud during the\nworking week, his scam might have remained undetected for long enough to\nallow his partners to empty the \u00a372m from the accounts in Manchester and\nMorocco. The \u00a372m was frozen and returned to HSBC.\n(Summarized from The Observer and other UK newspapers 13 July 2008\nand from the author's interviews with bankers 2008.)\nIt is not currently known whether Channa was `planted' at HSBC or was\ntargeted by others after his arrival, but--were it not for the evidence of his\nphone calls to conspirators--it might have been possible for him to carry\nout all these things alone or with one or two conspirators rather than as a\ncomponent of an ongoing `organized crime group'. As I write, the other\ncrime involvements--if any--of the other parties are unknown. (The sort of\nanalysis conducted by Morselli and Roy, 2008, depends on long-term\nLevi\u00ad\u00adOrganized fraud and organizing frauds 395\nsurveillance of the networks of people already suspected of serious crime.)\nThis emphasizes the point that fraud permits a variety of offender organ-\nizational permutations.\nAs for the persistence of crime techniques over time, those businesses\nthey needed larger orders to supply their expanding `mail order' trade,\nwould now do the same on the basis that they have a booming internet-\nbased sales business, especially prior to Christmas (Levi, 2008a). In the era\nof the credit card, dishonest merchants might pass large quantities of\n(i) fake or (ii) genuine (but on stolen card) transactions through their com-\nmercial accounts, claim (as is normal with traders) advance reimbursement\nfrom merchant acquirer card companies, and then disappear before the\ncard issuer, merchant acquirer or cardholder realizes there has been a fraud\nat all.11 Looking more at individual `purchasers' than businesses, payment\ncards were rare during the 1970s, but fraudsters can now use credit card\nnumbers skimmed from unsuspecting cardholders to order hundreds of\ncomputers on the net from different suppliers, have them delivered to `drop\naddresses' in the UK or the US, and then forwarded to addresses elsewhere\nfor resale: all of this before the cardholder or card issuer becomes aware\nthere is anything wrong. (The limited availability of such `drops' serves as\na brake on the exploitation of these and other `identity fraud' opportun-\nities.) This and other cyberfraud techniques reflect a comparative criminal\nadvantage arising from the combination of high technological skills and\nhigh motivation because of poor opportunities in their home countries.\nThere are also large-scale credit card and loan `bust outs' using people's\nown and stolen identities to obtain goods and money.\nThe illustrations above show that behaviour of victims-to-be and `cap-\nable guardians' has to be considered as part of the organization of crime.\nSome suppliers of goods on credit simply make assumptions about credit-\nworthiness without asking for references (or are satisfied by references from\nmembers of the credit applicant's family who had no plausible business\ndealings with the firm). They may check out the companies on\ntelephone/trade directories such as yell.com or BT and, if they are there,\nmay assume the entries reflect genuine trading, not realizing that they too\nmay have been `fixed'. If the fraudsters--as companies or as individuals--\nare buying electronic goods, the sales pressures on telecoms and computer\nfirms are extreme, especially in a global next-day service culture, and the\nrewards for salespeople are often based on what they sell, irrespective of\nwhether or not it is paid for, though some companies do claw back com-\nmission on fraudulent sales, which may act as a brake on enthusiasm or\nwilful blindness. Creditors in highly competitive industries are reluctant to\nshare their fraud losses with other firms and are afraid publicity may make\nthem more attractive to other fraudsters (author interviews with com-\npanies): whether the latter fear is reasonable is unverified. Sharing informa-\ntion anonymously via third parties such as trade reference agencies\nrepresents one route to learning from experience. These third parties might\nCriminology & Criminal Justice 8(4)\nbe viewed as `capable guardians', but what they may see or construct out\nof their partly automated analytical methods are suspicions of fraud rather\nthan undisputed crimes they have witnessed.\nAt the individual level, prior to the 1960s (as now in faith and other close\ncommunities), credit was seen more as a personal trust than as an imper-\nsonal risk judgement made by professionals. This is one reason some fraud-\nsters target religious affinity groups, because the approach for investment is\nthen seen as coming from a friend rather than a stranger, where trust norms\nmay not apply (or not to the same extent). Often today, the granting\n(or refusal) of credit to individuals is driven largely by reports from agencies\nsuch as Experian and Equifax (internationally) and--in the UK--Callcredit.\nThese reports incorporate large amounts of prior credit behaviour, as well\nas county court judgements and bankruptcy/Individual Voluntary\nAgreement records. To these are added financial institutions' proprietary\ncredit scoring--statistical analysis of aggregate data on past loan experi-\nences (`goods' and `bads')--and the `risk appetite' of the lenders, which in\nthe decade before the `credit crunch' in 2007 was high, due to the relative\ncheapness of money and the need to find outlets for funds held on deposit\nif they were to make a profit.\nThe role of criminal justice in the control of first party credit fraud--\nwhere borrowers themselves commit fraud rather than have others steal\ntheir details or their cards--is relatively unimportant. Unless the bad\ndebtors change their names and evade indirect identification, credit refer-\nence agencies can still incapacitate future credit opportunities, irrespective\nof whether people have been convicted, discharged from bankruptcy or\nindeed have avoided going `bust'. Electronic footprints on individual adults\nare quite pervasive (especially in the UK and North America, far less so in\nAsia, Africa and Eastern Europe), and attempts to sidestep these controls on\nidentity thefts and cloning are a key battleground against fraud today. Licit\nand illicit migration flows generate particular difficulties and asymmetries\nin the validation of credit histories. For example. the birth registers and\nother personal identifiers are absent from centralized records in many\nAfrican and Asian countries, so cannot readily be checked, and certainly\nnot electronically. Many of the features of late modernity upon which `iden-\ntity validation' rests are not uniformly available.\nFraud networks: between the opportunity and the\ncriminal act\nTremblay (1993) argued that the likelihood of crime commission is a func-\ntion of co-offender accessibility and suitability, and Felson (2003) stressed\nthat offender convergence settings `help likely co-offenders discover one\nanother in the context of their routine activities. Such settings provide an\nongoing structure for criminal co-operation, even as participants change.\nThis makes possible a local process of accomplice regeneration, leading to\nLevi\u00ad\u00adOrganized fraud and organizing frauds 397\nsustainable criminal behaviour'. Morselli and Roy (2008) note that both\nscript analysis and social embeddedness emphasize purposive social action,\nbut differ inasmuch as the social embeddedness perspective places the social\nnetwork as the force driving such action, whereas, following Cornish and\nClarke (2002: 53), the script approach maintains that `the shape of criminal\norganization emerges from the requirements of crime commission', the net-\nwork being only one of these requirements. The evidence does not enable us\nto determine whether context or existing networks drive organization.\nMorselli and Roy argue (p. 77) that the `main objective of a network analy-\nsis of crime scripts ... should be to untangle how some participants con-\ntribute in varying degrees to keeping the inherent channels of a [crime]script\nin place' (see p. 83 in their work for a car ringing `script').\nA priori, it would appear that different skill sets and statuses will be\nneeded for different fraud offences, and the barriers to entry depend on the\nstarting point of any given individual or network in relation to the practical\nopportunity and criminal justice obstacles confronting them.12 In most\ncountries of the world, a distinction is made between `laissez faire' opportun-\nities to set up and work in commerce13 and some restrictions applied to\npeople who want to open or work in the financial services sector, largely on\nthe grounds that the latter can directly steal funds from the public. It is\nimportant to understand such restrictions in a global context rather than the\ntraditional nation-state perspective of regulation and criminal justice: Nick\nLeeson (1997) was refused a licence by the predecessor of the Financial\nServices Authority because he had failed to declare to it a county court\njudgement against him on a debt; but Barings gave him a job in the far less\ncontrolled atmosphere of Singapore, where--though it is very doubtful he\nstarted out with that intent or with a concrete fraudulent plan--he was able\nto conduct trades that brought down the entire bank. One possibility for\n`underworld' offenders is to obtain co-operation from or to put pressure on\npeople in respectable positions in order to use them as tools of fraud (see the\nChanna example earlier, but also people in much more senior positions).\nOnce they have committed one offence (or legal act that would be seen as\nhighly disreputable), they may find blackmail makes exit difficult. Some\nfrauds can be perpetrated most readily by licensed securities dealers, and\npersons who are part of or suspected of being connected to a conventional\n`organized crime group' would have great difficulty passing the examin-\nations and the `fit and proper person' test for admission. (This would also\nrequire substantial elapsed time to acquire the knowledge, and a longer\n`investment' than is normal.) Therefore, one port of entry is to `do a deal'\nwith existing brokers, as the younger members of New York Mafia families\ndid with some Russian American brokers during the 1990s, against the\nadvice of their elders, who thought it too dangerous to move outside `the\nfamily', whom they could control via ties of mutual obligation (Diih,\n2005).14 Such intergenerational tensions are part of the response to declin-\ning market position for traditional `organized crime', eroded as it was by the\nundercover infiltration and electronic surveillance, followed by prosecutions\nCriminology & Criminal Justice 8(4)\nunder the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organization (RICO) legislation.\nThey chose Russian American brokers because they judged that people of\nthat background were more likely than others to find an approach from `the\nMob' attractive: an example of the irony that a `bad reputation' can bring in\nbusiness opportunities.\nTo illuminate such issues, we must first consider what sorts of networks\nare needed for different offences, and the extent to which their contacts and\nskill sets enable them to commit a variety of fraud (and non-fraud offences).\nFor price-fixing cartels, for example, what is needed is an ability to pose as\na legitimate bidder (which will usually require them to have experience in a\nrelevant area of business) and trust between `repeat players' that if they\noverbid for contracts, the winner this time will overbid later to enable them\nto win. This is easier within a homogeneous elite--the `good old boys'\n(a term that originated in the Southern States of the US)--than among com-\nparative strangers, but such elites can be transnational businesspeople as\nwell as locals. (See Harding, 2007, for a contemporary review.) In more\ncompetitive markets, the alternative may be corruption of the contract-\ngiver, perhaps even at the specification stage where the `spec' can be devised\nin order to give one party an inbuilt advantage. Cartels use their own cor-\nporate and individual identities for contracts (though not necessarily for the\nsecret meetings that precede the bids) and would seldom need any false cor-\nporate fronts for money laundering purposes since no illicit money changes\nhands; but bribe-payers might need some false or genuine trading fronts in\norder to channel payments to the corrupt public official or private sector\nbeneficiary.\nSometimes what is needed for the accomplishment of fraud is compliant\npeople who do not ask critical questions: this was the case with Nick\nLeeson and Barings Bank, where as a leading trader, Leeson was sur-\nrounded by Singaporean subordinates and colleagues who were passive and\nwith British superiors who understood little about trading and were content\nto take the results he fed them that fed their own large bonuses (Leeson,\n1997). Some corporate fraudsters--such as the late Robert Maxwell and\nthe chiefs of Enron--appoint staff on much higher than normal market\nsalaries to ensure their loyalty or wilful blindness when facing alternative\nemployment on much lower salaries. The circle of conspirators at Enron\nwas larger, but for the main part, they had bankers and lawyers who con-\nstructed large numbers of offshore Special Purpose Vehicles, and bright,\nwell paid staff whose jobs would have been imperilled by asking critical\nquestions. Rogue trader Jerome Kerviel of French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale\nmay have had an occasional accomplice (as is alleged in 2008), but man-\naged to rack up trading losses of billions in 2007 without the aid of an\n`organized crime group', taking advantage of weaknesses in supervision\nwhich required the resignation of senior management. All of the above\nshould be borne in mind when thinking about fraud and organized net-\nworks: there may be no need for conscious co-conspirators, depending on\nthe chain of authority within large corporate or governmental settings and\nLevi\u00ad\u00adOrganized fraud and organizing frauds 399\ntheir competence. What some offenders are able to do is simply deploy the\nrange of global corporate mechanisms available in a free enterprise society\nwhere there are (perhaps tautologically) insufficient `capable guardians' to\nstop them misusing the disguises offered by the corporate form or the\nauthority and power of a corporate role. Let us take as an example the\nflattering obituaries around the globe.\nRobert Vesco\nA high school dropout from Detroit, Vesco lied about his age to get a job\non a car assembly line. In 1965, Vesco hustled control of a small, failing\nNew Jersey valve-making company in return for a five-year $50,000 IOU.\nA year later he swapped its assets for control of a defunct stock market-\nlisted company he renamed International Controls Corporation, which rose\nin the 1960s Wall Street boom. Exploiting heavy borrowing and creative\naccounting, Vesco used ICC shares to buy bigger companies. But he had to\nkeep doing deals to pay interest and boost the share price. By the age of 30,\nMr. Vesco was a millionaire.\nHe later became involved in a Swiss-based mutual fund company,\nInvestment Overseas Services (I.O.S.), run by a swindler called Bernie\nCornfeld (Raw et al., 1971). When I.O.S. ran into trouble, Mr. Vesco\noffered to rescue the company and was embraced by investors terrified of\nlosing their savings. He bought I.O.S. in 1970 for less than $5 million, gain-\ning control of an estimated $400 million in funds. The accounting at the\ncompany had been so chaotic that Vesco was able to plunder its holdings at\nwill. After numerous complaints, the US Securities and Exchange\nCommission charged him and others in a civil suit with stealing more than\n$224 million. But he had already fled, first to the Bahamas and then to\nCosta Rica. There, he established a close friendship with President Jos\u00e9\nFigueres, ploughing some $11 million into his adopted country, especially\ninto a company founded by Figueres, who passed a law to guarantee Vesco\nwould not be extradited. He also befriended a nephew of President Nixon,\nand gave $200,000 to the Nixon campaign (which allegedly helped fund the\nWatergate burglary) in the hope that the president would help quash the\ninvestigation against him. Eventually, a scandal following one of his high-\ntech brainstorms--a factory to make machine guns, which included\nPresident Figueres's son as a partner--led to his flight to the Bahamas,\nwhere he invested in the then Prime Minister. He was welcomed in Antigua\nand Nicaragua, before Cuba finally accepted him for `humanitarian' rea-\nsons: of course there was no extradition from there to the US. Vesco even-\ntually upset the Castro government with a scheme to produce a wonder\ndrug that supposedly cured cancer, AIDS, arthritis and even the common\ncold. He was jailed for 13 years for defrauding a state-run biotechnology\nlaboratory run by Fidel Castro's nephew, Antonio Fraga Castro. If we\nexamine this remarkable life--and the lives of other transcontinental\nCriminology & Criminal Justice 8(4)\ntools of Vesco's trade--and his network--were his charisma, accountants\nand lawyers willing to create legal entities to serve his interests (especially\nin a period before money-laundering legislation imposed greater due dili-\ngence requirements on them), a level of wealth that enabled others to `party'\nat his expense, and his ability to hone in on corruptible people who could\noffer him protection from other governments and creditors pursuing him\nthrough the civil courts.\nEnron\nIn the last year at Enron Global Finance group, managers were sometimes\nhanded a list of Enron assets and instructed to go out and sell some to the\nSpecial Purpose Vehicles. A manager would pick something, from a plant to\nstock to a piece of a start-up company, then discuss the deal with a team of\ninternal lawyers and auditors. A bank or other investor lent money to the\nnewly created company to finance the purchase. The new company, in turn,\npaid the money to Enron. The use of an intermediary was to make the loan\nbelong to the new company, not Enron, and thus not to count as a debt on\nEnron's financial statement.\nInstead, it counted as income to Enron when the new company passed\non the proceeds.\nLess debt and more income assured Enron would keep its high credit rat-\ning (making borrowing cheaper) and would keep the stock price up.\nTop graduate school employees told the Houston Chronicle (20 January\n2002)[p3] there were many uses for the vehicles they considered legitimate,\nsuch as bringing in outside partners to share the risks of a particular venture:\nbut there was little question, especially toward the end, that many had no real\n`business purpose' other than improving financial appearances. Say the asset\nwas 100 shares of IBM stock. Enron would divide each share into two parts,\none called a `control interest' and one called an `economic interest'. Then it\nwould sell the economic interest to a newly created Special Purpose Vehicle. The\nasset was rarely as simple as 100 shares of another company's stock. So Enron\nhad to put a value on it. Because there was no real outside buyer, it decided the\nprice itself and had that number approved by its auditor, Arthur Andersen.\nThe deal was placed with a bank, insurance company or other major lender,\nwhich put up 97 per cent of the money. Sometimes the promise of Enron stock\nwould be put up to guarantee the loan, although Enron stockholders were\nnever told of the risk that their shares could be diluted if such new shares had\nto be issued. To qualify as `independent' from Enron for accounting purposes,\na Special Purpose Vehicle had to be owned by someone else. So an outside\nentity would be brought in to make the required investment, perhaps a tiny\npercentage of the SPV's total start-up cash, sometimes illicitly lent by Enron\nitself. An employee told the Houston Chronicle (20 January 2002):\nEnron no longer owned the economic interest in the asset, but it did own\ncontrol over it. In the sales contract with the vehicle, Enron promised always\nto act in the interest of the SPV. Lawyers and auditors said all this was OK.\nLevi\u00ad\u00adOrganized fraud and organizing frauds 401\nAs the asset made money for the SPV--if it did, and many didn't--it made\nprincipal and interest payments to the lender and issued dividends to the out-\nside equity partners, just like in a normal company.\nEnron got to report the proceeds of the sale of the asset as earnings. It had\nto repay the loan ... but the debt didn't show up on Enron's financial\nstatements.\n`Investors don't like to hear you say, \"Oh, I was wrong.\" So you start hav-\ning a yard sale to boost CFO (cash flow from operations) and net income,'\nthe employee said.\nAs the Enron indictments showed, there were plenty of accountants,\nbankers and lawyers as well as some senior management willing to partici-\npate in criminal or marginal operations. But they had nothing to do with\nany criminal subcultures as conventionally defined. Likewise, the many\nworks on the savings and loans `failures' (Black, 2005; Calavita and\nworks rather than socio-economically marginal firms (Shapiro, 1984),\nwhereas there is no logical reason why both sets (plus `full-time criminals')\ncannot be involved in frauds and money laundering.\nIdentity frauds and telemarketing scams\nBy contrast with notable criminal and `close to the wind' entrepreneurs\noperating under their own personal names discussed above (though some-\ntimes using many corporate and trust vehicles), other frauds may depend on\nfalse identities--wholly fictitious or `borrowed' from real people--either for\ntheir commission or for the laundering process. Thus a senior executive or\njunior in the finance department might create a company or individual to\nreceive payments, otherwise resting on their ability to make transfers with-\nout question: how elaborate the rest of the process is depends on how anx-\nious they are to avoid suspicion and conviction. If the aim is to flee, then\nthey may need false identities and that would usually involve others who\ncan supply them consciously. If the aim is to stay and deceive, then it may\ninvolve others able to create a smokescreen of activities.\nPeople other than insiders selling financial products need to find targets\nto approach and develop persuasive methods of getting them to part with\nfunds. One way of doing so is to pretend to be someone else who is credit-\nworthy. In the past, a simple method was to steal someone's credit card and\n(in the absence of photos on cards) look sufficiently plausible that a nor-\nmally ill-motivated (in)capable guardian (in routine activities terminology)\nsuch as a shop assistant would sell goods to them or--a stiffer but still pos-\nsible test--give them money at a bank counter. When Chip and PIN was\nintroduced, this became much harder in the UK and in some terminals over-\nseas, and the locus of fraud shifted to technological efforts to capture both,\nor to the use of cards and duplicate cards abroad, with UK-issued card\nCriminology & Criminal Justice 8(4)\nstable or falling over the previous six years.15 Chip and PIN necessitated a\nchange in the organization of fraud to greater internationalization of con-\nspirators: electronic details copied from cards (a particular speciality of Sri\nLankans working in UK petrol stations) could be sent to confederates\nabroad.16 Though this had happened before, it accelerated as a result of the\nimprovement of protection against fraud on lost and stolen cards (Levi,\n2008b). Likewise, the cruder forms of bankruptcy fraud in which new com-\npanies were created by people using false names and paid for the first few\norders before accelerating credit massively, selling the goods off and disap-\npearing, were frustrated by enhancements in commercial credit control and\npattern analysis, necessitating either wider transnational frauds or `less\norganized' frauds in the sense of fewer scammers operating in tandem (Levi,\n2008a). A key point here is the interaction between changes in the technol-\nogy and organization of crime prevention and changes in the levels and\norganization of fraud. (See McIntosh, 1971; for an influential early exercise\nalong these lines.) Alternatively, `identity thieves' can try to bypass the con-\ntrol systems by applying for new credit facilities in the names of their vic-\ntims, using a variety of techniques to get around the change of address\n(easier in highly mobile societies like the US) or even diverting the victim's\nfor an interesting research study of identity theft: a more heterogeneous\nterm than the phrase might suggest.)\nMuch of the `criminal (auto)biography' literature is devoted to individual\ncon artists whose lives--though highly entertaining (if one is not a victim)\nand glamorous (if one is wedded, as they mostly are, to the culture of\nconsumption)--are not embedded in crime networks to any significant extent\ningly endless biographies and ghosted autobiographies of the Kray brothers\nand their entourage focus on the violence and extortion rather than the frauds\nthat helped sustain their London `empire' in the 1960s. This applies also to\nthe Jake Arnott fictional trilogy, where even The Long Firm--which from the\ntitle should be about bankruptcy frauds (Levi, 2008a)--is almost all about\nsex and violence. The main fraud work that focuses us on networks is David\nThere, the assistant grifters were drawn from the world of (white) profes-\nsional thieves about whom Sutherland (1937) wrote, while the principals\nwere specialist confidence men. Maurer describes evocatively the way in\nwhich the fraudsters set up their `marks' (targets) in both short and long cons,\nand the sometimes elaborate storefronts they used for their scams (as seen in\nthe movie The Sting, which was based on the book).\nThe contemporary equivalents of these are telemarketing fraudsters:\n`boiler room' operators, who in one recent case (author interview with\npolice) worked in a room with a tape continuously playing in the back-\nground to simulate a busy stock brokerage; and the `419' advance fee fraud-\nsters who may hire or `borrow' rooms when they know the legitimate users\nLevi\u00ad\u00adOrganized fraud and organizing frauds 403\nare away to use as props in their stings. In some investment scams involv-\ning wines and spirits, or ostriches, the operators do have some real prod-\nucts on show, but vastly fewer than those `purchased' by the victims.\nHow do they find their targets? This can be through random dialling of\ntelephone directory entries; through share registers of public companies;\nthrough perusal of advertisements in personal columns, articles about\nwealthy people in the media; and through the use/purchase of existing\n`sucker lists' (which, except for serial fraudsters reusing their old lists, is the\nonly method that would require contact with other offenders). Shover et al.\n(2003) note that fraudulent firms employ sales agents who work from\n`lead', or `mooch', lists purchased from any of dozens of businesses that\ncompile and sell information on consumer behaviour and preferences. My\ninterviews with investigators in several countries (2008) suggest that\nexchanges of `mooch lists' are extensive and rapid--once someone has sub-\nscribed to one lottery or other product by internet, post or telephone, they\nsoon experience allied scam `offers' from other fraudsters, suggesting that\nthere is a sufficiently broad scope for fraudsters to be non-competitive.\nHoltfreter et al. (2008) conducted an interesting study in Florida to exam-\nine whether low self-control was related to consumer fraud victimization.\nThey distinguished between the targeting and actual victimization of the\npublic and demonstrated that male consumers had a higher risk of being tar-\ngeted (as in a previous case study of Ponzi investment fraud by Trahan et al.,\n2005), noting that since it is difficult for outsiders to judge whether people\nthey do not know will engage in risky behaviour, demographic correlates or\ntargeting are difficult to specify. They showed that fraud victimization was\nnot a random event because, although the net may be cast at random, the\nfinancial behaviour of consumers was key. Traditional indicators of victim-\nization such as going to bars at night were unrelated to fraud targeting and\nfraud victimization risk. So reducing financial risk-taking specifically might\nreduce the extent to which people with low self-control might become vic-\ntims of fraud, though it would not have an impact on other forms of vic-\nPerpetrators choose potential victims based on obvious indicators of vulner-\nability .... Financial risk-taking ... is not an easily recognizable manifestation\nof low self-control that fraudsters can observe and use to target potential vic-\ntims. On the other hand, the routine activities of consumers such as remote\npurchasing methods, are detected more easily by perpetrators of fraud.\nThis leads to targeting of people irrespective of their levels of self-control.\nHow are telemarketing fraudsters organized? Some fraudulent telemar-\nketing organizations consist of two or three persons who operate in a com-\nmunity for only a few days or weeks before moving on. These `rip and tear'\noperators depend on the months-long lapse between the time they begin\noperating and the time law enforcement and consumer protection agencies\nbecome aware of and target them. Somewhat larger `boiler rooms' feature\nCriminology & Criminal Justice 8(4)\nextensive telephone banks and large numbers of sales agents. Larger\ntelemarketing operations commonly take on the characteristics of formal\norganizations, with hierarchies, a division of labour, graduated pay and\nadvancement opportunities. Those who are ill-suited to cold call selling or\nwho develop moral qualms simply leave the business.\nIn terms of `scripts', if they wanted to commit a `boiler room' fraud with-\nout being licensed, then all they would need is an office, a good telephone\nsystem and salespeople willing and able to persuade `punters' to buy shares\nfor more than they were worth. Unlike the cons described by Maurer--\nwhich are pure artifices and therefore must hire willing conspirators--the\ninvestment scams can hire junior personnel through advertisements and\nagencies who may be quite ignorant of the true rationale of the business.\nOnly the originators may be active criminals. Some telephone salespeople\nmay be experienced multi-scam participants (Stevenson, 1998; Shover et al.,\nness of commission-based income-generators: the sort of people responsible\nnot just for telemarketing frauds but for financial services industry `mis-\nselling' when working for major banks and insurance firms, leading to pay-\nments of hundreds of millions of pounds in compensation by the\ncompanies.17 Some of those interviewed by Shover et al. (2003) had previ-\nous sales experience before beginning the work, but most did not: they either\nresponded to ads in the newspaper or were recruited by acquaintances who\nboasted about the money they were making. Many were not succeeding at\nconventional careers, and telemarketing came along at a time when they\nneeded to show that they could make something of themselves. They\nbelieved they were outstanding salespersons, who could sell over the tele-\nphone despite resistance from those they contacted; and they got a `high'\nfrom crime commission). These salespeople are unlikely to come from the\n`general criminal classes' but rather from people with persuasive skills (some\nof whom may be `shaken out' from financial services firms in recession),\nrecruited by advertisement and via agencies, and incentivized by high com-\nmission and low basic pay. Such generic persuasion techniques are discussed\nShover et al. (2003) state that the sales agent generally works from a\nscript that lays out successful sales approaches and responses. Promising\ncontacts are turned over to a `closer', a more experienced and better-paid\nsales agent. The hierarchy of the firms and the routine of turning prospects\nover to more experienced closers explain why victims typically report con-\ntact with multiple salespersons.\nWhat factors influence the choice of venue for boiler rooms and their\nmodus operandi? From UK cases examined, boiler rooms are commonly\nbased abroad (e.g. in Spain, where police interest is low), never seek author-\nization by the Financial Services Authority (FSA)--which is a legal require-\nment to sell securities in the UK--and use high pressure sales and telephone\nLevi\u00ad\u00adOrganized fraud and organizing frauds 405\ntechniques (author interviews with UK officials and police). One more\nsophisticated technique is to approach a small UK company not listed on\nthe Stock Exchange and propose to raise capital by selling \u00a3100,000 worth\nof shares in that company on their behalf. Of this \u00a3100,000, the boiler\nroom would agree to take 60 per cent as its fee, leaving the small company\nwith \u00a340,000 capital. In reality, the boiler room will `cold call' UK investors\nto sell the shares at up to 100 per cent over the agreed price, take their fee\nand vanish. The small companies involved may become liable to refund\ninvestors the full price paid for their shares. There are several variations on\nthe method of committing the crime:\n\u00b7 complete con, where there are no shares in existence;\n\u00b7 different instruments used--stock, currency options (and even bull sperm);\n\u00b7 restricted (e.g. US `Regulation S'), worthless or over-priced shares;\n\u00b7 purported involvement in raising capital for companies;\n\u00b7 market manipulation where there are shares in existence and a (limited)\nmarket;\n\u00b7 deceptive share promotion via bulletin boards.\nIf the fraudsters have sufficient nerve, they can seek to become regulated\nin one EU country and obtain a `passport' to operate in another under EU\nsingle market regulations, using that as a base for fraud and making it dif-\nficult for local regulators to intervene to close them down. In all of these\ncases, what the boiler room is really selling is deceptive and worthless\nexpectations.\nThe growth in cross-border consumer fraud operations can be illustrated\nby data from the US. (No equivalent data are yet available for the UK.)\nDuring the calendar year 2007, the US multi-agency Consumer Sentinel\n(which acts as a one-stop shop for complaints) received over 835,000\ncomplaints were cross-border fraud-related, down as a percentage (rather\nthan as a number) from 23 per cent in 2006, reflecting the growth in fraud\ncomplaints rather than the number of cross-border cases.18\nForeign Money Offers was the leading product/service category in US con-\nsumers' cross-border complaints (12%), followed by Prizes/Sweepstakes/Gifts\n(11%), Shop-at-Home/Catalogue Sales (8%), Lotteries/Lottery Ticket Buying\nClubs (7%), and Internet Auction (5%). Internet-related complaints com-\nprised 59 per cent (50,907) of the total cross-border fraud complaints\nbution of complaints (which includes reports from Australian, British and\nCanadian authorities), table 2 below tracks changes over time (Federal Trade\nAlthough complaints about overseas businesses may not reflect nation-\nality of the perpetrators, it may also illuminate to consider the amounts of\nCriminology & Criminal Justice 8(4)\nfrom which should be deducted business costs to fraudsters. These may be\nfairly modest, even assuming they pay for their communications.\nIn a longer work it would be possible to draw parallels, in terms of the\ndynamics between setting and criminal act, in relation to a broader range\nof identity and other frauds: for example, application frauds and insurance\nfrauds. If we take mortgage frauds, for example, fraud typically takes two\nforms: customers lying about their own means--i.e., exaggerating their\nincome--and/or falsifying documents, such as creating fake payslips that\nshow they earn an amount large enough to justify the mortgage they need,\neven if it is a multiple of their real income. This can be done simply by print-\ning fake payslips, if necessary on a colour printer. Self-certificated mort-\ngages (at higher interest rates) were allowed to cater for the increasing\nnumber of self-employed persons who could not produce genuine pay slips.\n(They might also include their `off the books' income!) One incentive for\nmortgage introducers is that they are paid commission; one incentive for\nlenders is that they have sales targets to hit and performance bonuses to get,\nand non-payment usually comes much later. In some cases, the borrower is\ntold there is no way they are going to get the mortgage they want with their\nincome, and that they should leave that part of the mortgage application\nform blank. After they have gone, the broker inserts the false income. In the\nUS particularly, there have been widespread scandals relating to commis-\nsion-hungry brokers lying to purchasers about the affordability of mort-\ngages, which they discover only when the initial low rates expire. In other\ncases, the would-be purchaser colludes with the broker. In other cases still,\nthe broker (or lawyer) purchases the properties for themselves as beneficial\nowner, using the names and real or fictitious income details of clients. In a\nrising market, where there is demand (for example from students) for rental\nproperties, fraudulent purchasers see little downside risk. In some cases,\nLevi\u00ad\u00adOrganized fraud and organizing frauds 407\nTable 2.

To some extent those chosen for this association reflect\nthose groups law enforcement and intelligence agencies have access to, and\nare self-justifying in `intelligence-led policing'.19 Many national and reli-\ngious groups have occupied places in the demonology of crime, but in the\nparticular case of fraud, the two most common demons are Jews and\nNigerians. Ichheiser (1944), reviewing the social psychology of anti-\nSemitism, argued that\n`Gangsters' and `swindlers' may be considered ... as two personified symbols\nof ... fundamental forms of danger in social life .... Especially, in times like\nour own, characterized by deep economic insecurities, ideological confusion,\nfluidity and impenetrability of intricate social processes, by propaganda,\nadvertising, adulteration of goods, the man in the street feels himself far\nmore deeply threatened by those rather `invisible' social dangers than by\novert coercion and violence. And he is getting more and more suspicious that\nthose invisible processes by which he is threatened are intentionally, and for\nsomeone's advantage, manipulated by some kind of swindlers `behind the\nscenes.' Consequently the swindler ... becomes the main symbol of the pre-\ndominant fear.\nThere is no need here to review the history of imagery that associated Jews\nwith swindling, but it remains a much more restrained sub-text in the post-\nHitler period, which understandably generates caution in its treatment in\nCriminology & Criminal Justice 8(4)\nTable 3. Fraud complaints and amount paid by US consumers against companies located in\nCY Total Complaints Percentage Amount Average Median\nno. of reporting of complaints paid amount amount\ncomplaints amount reporting reported paid paid\npaid amount paid\ncriminological and media circles. I have made a decision here to include this\naspect of `the supply of fraudsters' to fraud networks because it is a popu-\nlar financial services industry and law enforcement theme. Analysis of pros-\necution cases cannot but reflect any criteria that underlie the reporting,\ninvestigation and prosecution processes, and so factors in the above that\nprotect social elites (such as those involved in Enron or in price-fixing car-\ntels) might lead to their under-representation compared with social out-\nsiders. Likewise, negative social stereotypes (for example about who\n`dangerous criminals' are) that affected these processes will lead to over-\nrepresentation.\nThe analysis of white-collar offenders in the US Federal courts by\nthat two thirds had no previous convictions but of those who had, only one\nin five had previously been convicted of white-collar crime. The ethnicity of\noffenders varies by offence type: anti-trust and securities offenders were 99\nper cent white; but around a quarter of credit card fraud, mail fraud and\nbank embezzlers were non-white. Jews were significantly over-represented\namong securities offenders (though not compared with their numbers in the\ngeneral securities industry); but not among other white-collar offences.\nAlthough the research on this issue has not been intensive, by inspection\nsimilar remarks might be made about the UK in the initial years of the\nSerious Fraud Office, but not subsequently. Thus all four convicted (but\nnone of those acquitted) in the Guinness case (Levi, 1991) were Jewish in\norigin (though CEO Ernest Saunders had converted to Christianity).\nHowever overall, neither Jews nor Asians nor any other religious, ethnic or\nnational group are significantly over-represented in UK SFO cases, taking\naccount of their numbers in the corporate and financial services industries.\nOf course one needs no `racial' theories about these connections, for they\nare often relationships of propinquity and mutual trust. By volume, most\nfraudsters are blue-collar rather than white-collar in background (Weisburd\noffenders (for example `identity fraudsters') are disproportionately black or\nHispanic (Copes and Vieraitis, 2007). This merely reflects the fact that\nsome types of fraud can be accomplished by `ordinary' offenders, and there\nis a ready supply of willing offenders from poorer communities who would\ncommit fraud if they had the technical and social skills required and the\nconfidence to engage in such crimes. Whether many such persons would\nhave the verbal skills to commit securities frauds--even `boiler room' and\nsuchlike that do not require formal qualifications--is more doubtful, but\npayment card and social security frauds are relatively low-skilled.\nDiscussions about `fraud' with bankers in many parts of the world\nimmediately throw up the word `Nigerians' (author interviews; see also\ninternational Diasporas have become a common focus of risk discourses,\nand Nigerians represent a nationality whose Diasporas--whether in Nigeria\nitself or in Australia, Ghana, Ireland, the Netherlands, North America,\nLevi\u00ad\u00adOrganized fraud and organizing frauds 409\nRussia, South Africa or the UK (to mention only some countries where\nNigerian fraud networks have been observed)--are more visibly active than\nmore likely than others to be involved in such frauds, and they tend to be\nloose confederations rather than a tight hierarchy of offenders. He notes (pp.\n22\u00ad23) that fraudsters buy respectability and even adoration if they chan-\nnel some of their money back to their impoverished home towns. As\nMertonian strain theory might lead us to expect, locals recognize what they\nhave gained while displaying little interest in how they have obtained it. The\nexplanations for heavy involvement in financial crime of Igbo people from\nthe country's east include\n(1) The social and economic marginalization (and exclusion from government\n(2) Policing is particularly poor there and in Lagos and Delta state, which are\nalso rich sources of financial crime.\n(3) The east has the kind of entrepreneurial commercial centres around which\nthis type of crime will tend to be found. In Northern Nigeria, by contrast,\nthere is a much smaller private sector and more government-based corrup-\ntion. In Yorubaland in the west, scams are often linked directly to the\naccounting, banking and legal professions, which traditionally attract\nmany Yoruba.\nOne might add that from the point of view of the Nigerian people them-\nselves, these 419 frauds are far less harmful than the networks of corruption\nand patronage among military and civilian leaders who--especially but far\nfrom exclusively under military dictatorships--have stolen billions of dollars of\nincome from the Nigerian oil production and from contracts, and who have\nconverted these funds for their own use: the so-called `curse of oil'. Between the\nBritish police and the Nigerian Economic and Financial Crime Commission\nduring the time of President Obasanjo,20 four Nigerian state governors were\ncharged with money laundering and/or fraud. But the 419s and other `advance\nfee' scams--called because people, once hooked, usually become trapped into\npaying fees to advance the payment of `their' money--are the `outward-facing'\nside of Nigerian fraud and involve losses to Westerners.\nMore generally in cybercrimes for gain (including payment card fraud),\nthough there are plenty of indigenous fraudsters in the UK and the US,\nEastern Europeans have developed a reputation for technical skill and\ncross-border operations. There is nothing exclusive about these national-\nities, but in identified American and British cases (which are only partly the\nproduct of what law enforcement choose to pursue), Lithuanians,\nRumanians and Russians predominate in such forms of fraud, though\nBrazilians are playing an increasing role. Rumanians also have played a\nsignificant role in the use in the UK of technical devices on ATMs (such as\nthe Lebanese Loop--first developed by Lebanese crime groups and now in\ndecline due to technical prevention improvements) to capture payment card\nCriminology & Criminal Justice 8(4)\nPINs. However it is less obvious what the analytical value is of such ethnic\nand national identifiers, which unintentionally scapegoat large classes of\nindividuals who may be largely innocent of involvement in crime.\nTrahan et al. (2005) link fraud victim behaviour to `the American\ndream', applying interestingly the more general criminological analysis of\nMessner and Rosenfeld (2001). Yet it is not obvious how specific to\nAmerica this dream (or nightmare) is. Where people have some IT educa-\ntion and intelligence but few legitimate opportunities in their home areas,\nthey often seek opportunities elsewhere. Especially given legal migration\nand employment controls (supplemented perhaps by discrimination)--or\nfewer good jobs available for anyone in their place of emigration than they\nexpected--they may be tempted by offers from others seeking co-offenders\nor they may develop their own fraud schemes. This was what drove the emi-\ngration of (non-Jewish) Germans to London in the mid-19th century,\nwhereupon some of them turned to bankruptcy fraud, often against\nGerman companies (Levi, 2008a). Thus it is unsurprising that irrespective\nof any prejudices among social control agencies, we get clusters of offenders\nwith similar backgrounds: colour, language (which also shelters from\nsurveillance), and geography (people sharing ethnicities, nationality and\nreligion often live close to each other) all contribute.\nConclusion\nGlobalization of crime is part of contingent relationships between settings,\nwith their rich and varied opportunities (reflecting patterns of business,\nconsumer and investment activities), the abilities of would-be perpetrators\nto recognize and act on those opportunities (the `crime scripts' perspective),\nand their interactions with controls, including law enforcement (touched\nonly lightly upon here). Constructs of `organized crime' should be (and are\nbecoming) less obsessed with the structure of groups than with what\npeople need from the largely illicit and largely licit worlds to go about the\nbusiness of fraud. In other words, analysis of `organized-ness' is becoming\ndecentred and re-understood as much in terms of the settings in which\noffending and its precursors can take place as in terms of the acts\nthemselves.\nSuch observations or claims about the contested and shifting nature of\nanalysis over time complicate the already difficult question of whether\nfraud `itself' has changed over the years. It seems reasonable to reflect on\ntwo `historical' questions:\n(1) In what respects has fraudulent activity changed, in terms of the sorts of\ntechniques and organization that are or can be used, in relation to the\nefforts made (intentionally or not) to prevent frauds? And\n(2) In what respects has the world of fraud changed and what would the sort\nof people with the sort of skill sets/networks who committed frauds in the\nLevi\u00ad\u00adOrganized fraud and organizing frauds 411\nIn relation to the first question, although the basic techniques used by\nfraudsters in the 1960s are still available today, especially against those\ninvestors and trade creditors who make only modest enquiries, the profes-\nsionalization of investor protection and credit management in the UK, as\nwell as consumer media interest, makes the commission of such frauds\nharder. E-commerce, the growth of lightweight, high value electronic prod-\nucts, and the technology of rapid delivery anywhere in the world have cut\ndown decision times and opened up domestic and foreign markets to fraud-\nsters within and outside the UK. At the high end of insolvency frauds, it\nseems doubtful whether the more skilful abuses of insolvency by those who,\nfor example, establish beneficially owned corporate fronts offshore and\nthen create artificial debts to them which enable them to vote in friendly\nliquidators or administrators, are any harder to commit or are any more likely\nto be punished today than they were 30 years ago. Formal social control--\nthe police and criminal courts--has not been particularly interested in\nfrauds other than the more visibly harmful `widows and orphans' cases.\nThere has been a growth in `civil recovery' regimes, applying financial\ninvestigation and asset forfeiture (irrespective of criminal conviction) to\nsupplement the post-conviction confiscation remedies that have replaced\nthe Criminal Bankruptcy Orders. However even if they have substantial\nconfiscatable savings rather than (as did the high-spending long-firm fraud-\nsters interviewed by Levi, 2008 and the telemarketers interviewed by\nShover et al., 2003, for example) spending `their' proceeds as they went\nalong, few fraudsters are high profile career criminals of a seriousness level\nthat would interest the Serious and Organised Crime Agency. This question\nis connected to the second.\nWhat forms of fraud constitute a `rational choice' depends on the confi-\ndence, skills and contact set of any given individual offenders. The presence\nor absence of `crime networks' known to and trusted by the willing offender\nmakes a difference to `crime capacitation': an issue often neglected in indi-\nvidualized explanations of involvement in crime. Choice of crime type\nmight also be affected by age. Those offenders who were in their 50s and\nover might not be attracted towards the technological challenges of cyber-\nactivities, and--except via close encounters on porn sites, in night clubs, or\nin prisons--the age gap might apply to co-criminality as it does to other\nfeatures of contemporary life. So today's new generation fraudsters might\ngravitate towards more `techie' forms of fraud, whereas if they were in late\ncareer, it might seem too risky to adapt in unfamiliar territory unless they\ncould find someone younger to collaborate with. This is a general propos-\nition about the relationship between age and risk-taking/innovation. Some\nfraudsters display a remarkable aptitude for creativity and constant testing\nout of commercial systems and private individuals for signs of weakness.\nThis focus on `criminal transferable skills'--the set of aptitudes including\nsocial networking individual/sets of offenders have--concentrates our\nattention on offender creativity, energy and social networking skills in find-\ning co-offenders (or `turning' non-offenders into co-offenders) and in\nCriminology & Criminal Justice 8(4)\nadapting techniques: many offenders (and non-offenders) lack one or all of\nthese qualities.\nObjectively, there are far more opportunities for disintermediated crime\nin late modernity than in the post-war decades. With only modest sophisti-\ncation, the internet and social constructions of what is normal have made\nit easier for foreign natural and legal persons to defraud consumers and\nsuppliers, for example via counterfeited or cloned payment cards.\nFraudsters could be involved in the theft of personal data from garbage\n(`bin raiding') or by hacking into data storage facilities; or account manipu-\nlation by insiders, whether in call centres or elsewhere. (The offshoring of\ncall centres led to periodic media alarm stories about blackmail and cor-\nruption in India: but it is nonsensical to think that this cannot happen in the\nUK, with badly paid staff and high turnover ratios. Indeed, there may be\ntougher regimes in Indian call centres--staff searches and prohibitions on\nmobile phones in the premises--than might be allowed in the UK.) Rings of\nstaged accidents with claims for hard-to-falsify personal injuries would be\nwithin the skill set of some (once they worked out what to do), as would\norganized benefit fraud and--especially--the sale of counterfeit products,\nwhose quality digital technology has done so much to improve, despite the\nbest efforts of the anti-counterfeiting coalitions. For the more adventurous,\nscams can involve some currently fashionable musical or sporting events, or\na social cause such as `renewable energy'. One may expect some future\nscams involving carbon trading. The underlying concepts were available to\ninvestors at the time of the South Sea Bubble, but some investors in each\nsubsequent generation and/or country have to learn the lessons for them-\nselves. Arguably, as evidenced by declining savings ratios and the willing-\nness to borrow against the legal security of homes in the UK and elsewhere,\nthere has been a step change in people's expectations of steady state or ris-\ning affluence, and resistance to personal financial decline. When times get\nhard as they have done in the period 2007-09, people may take more risks\nto avoid downward socio-economic mobility, and this offers opportunities\nto fraudsters. At a policy level, this means that a focus on `regulating' rather\nthan `eliminating' frauds is sensible: what constitutes an acceptable level of\nfraud may depend on who the victims are, how much they can afford to\nlose, and the collateral damage caused.\nNotes\n1 Professor of Criminology, Cardiff University.

Does the mere fact that money is trans-\nferred overseas or credit cards are used fraudulently overseas make them\nlevel 3 crimes?\n6 In some cases, they may encounter people (or companies) they consider to\nbe potential suckers and then develop ways of fleecing them. There is a\nflexibility here that is poorly captured in the term `organized crime'.\n7 Rather than `suspicious activities' or `suspicious transactions', as is the offi-\ncial terminology, I consider it more analytically accurate to term them sus-\npected transactions. Electronic transfers create a clearer audit trail if and\nwhen identified and followed than do cash movements.\n8 I interviewed one offender who would have had difficulty in disposing of a\ntruckload of yoghurt, had he not been arrested before he dealt with the\ndilemma. One 19th century fraudster obtained from Germany a gross (144)\nof artificial glass eyes which he was unable to sell and in the end, he had to\ndispose of for the price of the postage it cost to obtain them (Levi, 2008a).\n9 The sanctions would have to be significant in terms of their own values in\nthe `communities' (if any) they inhabit. Cultural variations in legitimacy\ncan be quite broad.\n10 This echoes other practical failures in the fraud attempts of others, like taking\ntoo long a lunch break and therefore not being in the office when the bank\nrang to verify that the \u00a325 million transfer request to a new account was\nintentional. These also give willing future offenders some useful tips to avoid!\n11 Unless the purchases on `borrowed' card data are picked up by the sophis-\nticated electronic systems that model customer transaction patterns and\ncontact customers proactively if there are transactions that do not fit their\nprofiles.\n12 The longer and more intensive an investigation, the more likely it is that\nsurveillance will generate an accurate model of interactions between play-\ners in the network. Morselli and Roy correctly argue that when combined\nwith an understanding of the roles that are hard to substitute, Social\nNetwork Analysis gives a better idea of the impact of enforcement inter-\nventions against central players. Sometimes one only learns impact after the\noperation/arrests, and in my view, one key question is whether in practice\ninvestigations do continue to test the disruptive effects: this might be hard\nto justify both legally (in terms of criteria for surveillance authorization)\nand financially (given severe constraints on police finances \u00ad someone has\nto be paid to listen, and this is especially expensive in foreign languages).\nBoundary assessments for determining the limits of social networks may be\nharder in fraud than in some other networks.\nCriminology & Criminal Justice 8(4)\n13 Though in some European countries, for example, people with criminal\nrecords are not allowed to become company directors.\n14 This is not a recent issue. Lefkowitz (1963: 51) notes: `In recent years, per-\nsons with criminal records have attempted by various guises to infiltrate the\nsecurities market, posing major problems for governmental regulatory\nagencies in the securities field. New York State has attempted by statute to\neliminate persons with felony convictions from engaging in the securities\nbusiness. Another problem in New York was high-pressure \"boiler room\"\noperations. A New York statute now requires registration of securities\nsalesmen, in an effort to alleviate that problem. The gangster element has\nfound it increasingly difficult to conduct business in New York under these\nenactments.'\n`card not present' frauds in England and Wales, a rise of 58 per cent by vol-\nshopping increased tenfold to \u00a334 billion. So the rise in fraud was modest\ncompared with the growth in this form of consumer behaviour.\n16 Hence some connection between payment card fraud and the financing of\nthe Tamil Tigers (LTTE): but what proportion even of Sri Lankan card\nfraud went to finance terrorism rather than to sustain impoverished people\nor make some foreigners wealthy remains unknown--another example\nof the loose conceptualization of the link between organized crime and\nterrorism.\n17 The distinction between mis-selling and fraud can be a fine one at times. The\nUK Financial Services Authority has set out criteria for judging mis-selling\n(http://www.fsa.gov.uk/pages/Library/Communication/PR/2003/052.shtml),\nstating `it is the suitability of the recommendation for the consumer, not the\ninvestment performance of the product that matters. As long as suitability\nwas established at the time of sale, and the required explanation of risk\nmade, then consumer dissatisfaction about investment returns achieved\ngives no basis for an allegation of mis-selling. Investment performance may\nbe relevant in assessing redress due where mis-selling is shown to have\noccurred.'\n18 A fraud complaint is `cross-border' if: (1) a US consumer complained about\na company located in Canada or another foreign country; (2) a Canadian\nconsumer complained about a company located in the US or another for-\neign country; or (3) a consumer from a foreign country (e.g. the UK or\nAustralia) complained about a company located in the US or Canada.\nCompany location is based on addresses reported by the complaining\nconsumers and, thus, likely understates the number of cross-border com-\nplaints. In some instances the company address provided by the consumer\nactually may be a mail drop in the consumer's country rather than the\nphysical location of the company in a foreign country, and in other cases,\nthe consumer does not know whether the location is in the US or abroad.\n19 `There is a well-justified fear that raids [by the UK Borders and\nImmigration Agency] have focused on ethnic minority businesses. The list\nprovided on the Home Office website shows that 95% of those targeted\nLevi\u00ad\u00adOrganized fraud and organizing frauds 415\nhave been Indian, Bangladeshi, Chinese, Vietnamese and Turkish-run.' Such\nbusinesses are the easiest `low hanging fruit' to fulfil organizational targets,\ncompared with other workers in the hotel and food picking/production trades.\n(http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/jul/16/humanrights.immi\ngrationpolicy.)\n20 After Obasanjo's departure from office, the head and then the acting head\nof the EFCC were replaced in 2008, suggesting to some the view of the new\nregime that they had become over-active in combating elites. Action against\n419 fraudsters was more acceptable, since these were not usually connected\nto government elites (interviews with police and other officials, 2008).\nDespite the reputational damage 419 frauds and governmental corruption\nwere causing to Nigeria, it seems unlikely that much of this policing activ-\nity in Nigeria would have taken place had the country not been `black-\nlisted' by the Financial Action Task Force for inadequate anti-money\nlaundering processes.\nReferences\nAning; Kwesi (2007) `Are there Emerging West African Criminal Networks?\nBlack, William (2005) The Best Way to Rob a Bank is to Own One.
