Szinovacz1 and Adam Davey2\n1Glennan Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology, Eastern Virginia Medical School, Norfolk.\n2Polisher Research Institute, North Wales, Pennsylvania.\nWith hypotheses derived from a life course perspective in conjunction with life event stress and role theories, we\nexamine whether a spouse's employment and length of retirement affect a person's postretirement depressive\nsymptoms and whether such effects differ by gender. Analyses use pooled data from Waves 1\u00ad4 of the Health and\nRetirement Survey, using a subsample of married individuals who either remained continuously employed over\ntime or completely retired since the Wave 1 interviews (N = 2,695). Recently retired men seem to be negatively\naffected by their spouses' continuous employment when compared with men whose wives were continuously not\nemployed. In contrast, spouses' joint retirement has a beneficial influence on both recently retired and longer-\nretired men. However, for recently retired men, the positive effect of wives' retirement seems to be contingent on\nspouses' enjoyment of joint activities. Among women, effects of spouses' employment occur only among very\nrecently retired wives (0\u00ad6 months). These wives report more depressive symptoms if their spouses were already\nnonemployed prior to wives' retirement. These results demonstrate the complexity of retirement adaptation\nprocesses and suggest that marital context plays an important role in retirement well-being.\nINCREASES in the labor force participation of middle-aged\nwives imply that, for many spouses, retirement has become\na ``couple event'' (Szinovacz & Ekerdt, 1995). Dual-earner\ncouples organize and experience the retirement transition not\nonly in terms of their own but also in regard to their spouse's\nretirement. Although several earlier studies have addressed the\nquestion of how selected couple retirement patterns influence\npostretirement marital quality or well-being, many of these\nstudies were limited because of their reliance on small or\nnonrepresentative samples such as data from retirees of specific\nuse of retrospective or cross-sectional data (Lee & Shehan,\nmen's retirement (Myers & Booth, 1996). We revisit this topic\nby using longitudinal data from the Health and Retirement\nSurvey (HRS; Juster & Suzman, 1995) and a theoretical\nframework that integrates assumptions from the life course\nperspective with assumptions pertaining to phases of re-\ntirement, gender role ideology, and marital context.\nTheoretical Framework\nEarlier studies on postretirement well-being focused either on\nretirees' activities and roles or on selected resources such as\nhealth, finances, or marital status (for reviews see Atchley,\n1998). In contrast, the theoretical framework informing our\napproach relies foremost on the life course perspective.\nAccording to life course theory, an understanding of life course\ntransitions such as retirement requires consideration of context,\nlinked life spheres, and timing, trajectories, and pathways\n(Settersten, 2003). Life transitions are contextually embedded;\nthat is, adaptation to life transitions not only depends on the\noccurrence of the transition per se but also on the specific\ncontexts under which the transition takes place. In the case of\nretirement, the most important contexts include former work\nroles and work history, health, finances, and marital status\n(Bosse\n\u00b4, Aldwin, Levenson, & Workman-Daniels, 1991; Cala-\nSzinovacz, 1989). Furthermore, the experience of life transitions\nis contingent on developments in other life spheres (linked\nlives). We focus on the marital relationship and especially on\nspouses' employment and retirement. The concepts of timing,\ntrajectories, and pathways refer to development within and\nacross life spheres. Timing of life events is important in regard\nto cultural norms and personal expectations; that is, off-time\nevents tend to undermine well-being (Hagestad, 1990).\nTrajectories refer to development within a life sphere such as\nthe work or retirement career. Specific work career trajectories\n(e.g., those ensuring adequate pension coverage and thus\nsufficient postretirement income; see O'Rand & Henretta,\n1999) may enhance retirement well-being, whereas others may\nhinder it (e.g., unstable work patterns; see Marshall, Clarke, &\nBallantyne, 2001). Pathways refer to the combination of\ntrajectories from different life spheres and the timing of life\ntransitions in relation to each other. For example, spouses may\nenter retirement jointly or separately. In addition to its emphasis\non contexts, linked lives, and transitions, the life course\nperspective pays tribute to the gendered nature of life\nexperiences. Consistent evidence suggests that spouses experi-\nence the marital relationship differently--Bernard (1973)\nspeaks of a ``his and her'' marriage. Whereas evidence\nconcerning gender differences in postretirement well-being is\nindicate that both retirement contexts and retirement meanings\nJournal of Gerontology: PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCES Copyright 2004 by The Gerontological Society of America\nAlthough the life course perspective provides a general\nframework for assessing effects of life transitions on well-being,\nit does not provide specific hypotheses about the influences of\ncontexts, trajectories, or pathways. We thus rely on selected\nconcepts and assumptions from other theories for hypothesis\ndevelopment. These include assumptions about phases of\nretirement adaptation, gender role ideology, and marital quality.\nRetirement phases. --Adaptation to life transitions may vary\nover time. Atchley (1976) first suggested five phases of\nretirement adaptation--honeymoon, disenchantment, reorienta-\ntion, stability, and termination. Although the length of these\nphases may vary considerably, our analyses focus on retirement\nover one wave of the HRS, typically a period of 2 years, and\nthus are likely to reflect only the honeymoon and disenchant-\nment phases (for a discussion of the HRS, see the Methods\nsection). Some research provides support for a honeymoon\nphase, that is, an initial euphoric reaction to retirement, followed\nby some decline in well-being (Ekerdt, Bosse\nRichardson & Kilty, 1995), but other studies failed to sustain\nthis pattern, especially for women (Kim & Moen, 2002;\nRichardson & Kilty, 1995). If retirement phases do indeed\nexist, short-term retirees should report fewer depressive\nsymptoms than longer-term retirees. However, this effect may\nbe contingent on marital context, especially spouses' employ-\nment and marital quality.\nGender role ideology and retirement patterns of couples. --\nPrevious research has shown that spouses strive toward joint\nretirement (Allmendinger, Bru\n\u00a8ckner, & Bru\nman, Mitchell, Wister, & Gutman, 2000) and that continued\nemployment of the wife after the husband's retirement is\nassociated with reduced postretirement well-being (Moen et al.,\nSchaffer, 2000). It has been argued that this timing pattern\nundermines the husband's status as the main provider and\nreduces his power in the marital relationship (Davey &\n& Harpster, 1993), both conditions that apparently hinder\nretirement adjustment. The disenchantment associated with the\nretired husband\u00ademployed wife pattern seems more pronounced\namong husbands. In light of the negative effect of the wife's\ncontinued employment on the husband's postretirement well-\nbeing, husbands in this situation are unlikely to experience\na retirement honeymoon. We thus expect a retirement honey-\nmoon effect, as reflected by relatively lower levels of depressive\nsymptoms, for husbands whose wives were already not\nemployed at baseline (Hypothesis 1a) or retired during the\nsame time span as their husbands (Hypothesis 1b).\nGiven that many couples aim for joint retirement, we expect\nwives to benefit from this retirement pattern as do husbands.\nLittle is known about retirement adjustment of spouses after the\nwives' retirement, especially if the husbands continue to work.\nIn contrast to the nonnormative character of husbands'\nretirement prior to their wives, this retirement pattern is\nconsistent with the traditional provider role. Some research\nsuggests that the retirement of wives prior to that of their\nhusbands may profit husbands but not the wives themselves\n(Szinovacz & Schaffer, 2000), but other evidence indicates that\nhusbands' and wives' adjustment to retirement is linked (Haug,\nBelgrave, & Jones, 1992). The positive impact of the retirement\nof wives prior to that of their husbands on postretirement well-\nbeing may reflect a resolution of disagreements surrounding\nwives' employment or a reduction in stress associated with\nemployed wives' overload problems. We thus predict a re-\ntirement honeymoon, as reflected by relatively lower levels of\ndepressive symptoms, for recently retired wives who retired\njointly with their spouses (Hypothesis 2a) or whose husbands\ncontinued to work (Hypothesis 2b).\nLife event stress and marital quality. --The disruption in\nlifestyle and daily routines caused by life transitions has been\nKessler, Price, & Wortman, 1985; Pearlin, Lieberman,\nMenaghan, & Mullan, 1981). However, the extent of stress,\nand indeed whether stress occurs at all, is contingent on se-\nlected characteristics of the transition (Burke, 1991; Thoits,\nanalyses is the insight that the stress associated with life\ntransitions depends on the salience of life spheres. Exits from\nsalient spheres are more stressful, whereas availability of\nalternative salient life spheres reduces stress. Indeed, studies\nindicate that being married and having a high-quality marriage\ncontribute to postretirement well-being (Atchley, 1992; Cala-\nReitzes, Mutran, & Fernandez, 1996), whereas marital prob-\nlems enhance perceptions of retirement-related hassles (Bosse\n\u00b4\net al., 1991). Implementation of a couple-oriented postretire-\nment lifestyle most likely requires that spouses enjoy joint\nendeavors. Such endeavors are bound to intensify the salience\nof the marital relationship and have been found to be\nparticularly important for postretirement marriages (Dorfman,\nthus expect the aforementioned hypothesized relationships to be\ncontingent on couples' enjoyment of joint activities. Specifi-\ncally, the predicted honeymoon effect after joint retirement or\na wife's retirement prior to her husband's is expected to be\nstronger among couples enjoying joint activities than among\nthose who do not enjoy joint activities (Hypothesis 3).\nMETHODS\nSample\nIn our analyses we use data from the HRS, which was\nlaunched in 1992. The HRS is a longitudinal survey of\nhouseholds (the interviewed are the primary respondent and his\nor her spouse) that is conducted biannually. The data are in the\nconsists of main respondents aged 51\u00ad61 years at Wave 1 and\ntheir spouses, regardless of the spouses' age (N \u00bc 12,652\nrespondents; 7,702 households). Selection of households was\nbased on a multistage area probability design with oversamples\nfor minorities and persons residing in Florida. The response rate\nwas more than 80% (for further details see Heeringa &\nThe selection of the subsample for our analyses is guided by\nthe assumption that divergent preretirement contexts influence\npostretirement well-being. From this perspective it is more\nimportant to restrict variability in the baseline population than to\nattain full generalizability of results. For the subsample used in\nour analyses, we first identified all HRS individuals aged 40 or\nolder (the main respondents or their spouses) from couples with\nat least one age-eligible partner (i.e., age 51\u00ad61) who were\nemployed 10 hr or more at baseline and did not define\nthemselves as retirees. From this subsample we then selected\npersons who were either continuously employed throughout all\nfour waves or who self-defined as ``completely retired'' at\nWaves 2, 3, or 4 and had left the labor force (the HRS retirement\nmeasures are discussed in the paragraphs that follow). The\nexclusion of Time 1 nonemployed or retired persons was\nnecessary because we would lack baseline data for this\npopulation. We also excluded individuals working fewer than\n10 hr at Time 1. This population may be underemployed or\nalready in postretirement bridge jobs. Because our analyses\nfocus on spouses' employment status and retirement, we further\nrestricted the sample to persons who were married at baseline\nand reported no change in marital status or partners at Time 2,\nyielding a final subsample of 2,904 individuals. We lost an\nadditional 122 persons whose partners did not participate in the\nsurveys, and we lost some respondents (varying by analysis but\nfewer than 100) because there were missing values we could\nnot impute. The final sample consists of 2,695 respondents,\nidentifying these subsamples, we added information from\nspouses to each individual's file through the matching of\nrecords by household and partner identification. It should be\nnoted that current retirees in the HRS tend to have retired early\n(i.e., before 62\u00ad65 years of age). Thus, our data may not be\ngeneralizable to those retiring in their mid to late 60s.\nThe analyses pool persons who retired between Waves 1 and\n2, Waves 2 and 3, and Waves 3 and 4. Such pooling is\nnecessary to achieve a sufficient number of cases for our\ncomplex analyses. It also creates a sample basis that addresses\nsimilar retirement transitions for all respondents, namely the\ntransition from work to full-time retirement within the past 2\nyears. We recognize that many individuals do not follow this\nretirement path; they retire gradually. In line with our aim to\nexplore clearly identifiable transition patterns (in the sense of\nWeberian ideal types), we focus on the full retirement pattern,\nwhich is also the most common in our sample. In each case, the\nearlier wave data serve as baseline and the later wave data as\nbasis for the construction of change and outcome variables. For\ncontinuously employed workers, we randomly assigned\nrespondents to waves to achieve relatively equal representation\nof waves in the analyses. We also controlled for wave to further\nexclude potential cohort or period effects. In the remainder of\nthe article, we refer to the baseline data as Time 1 and the\noutcome wave as Time 2.\nLosses of data caused by attrition or missing responses can\nbias results. We dealt with both issues. We adjusted for\na potential attrition bias through weights that account for sample\nselection and nonparticipation biases as well as attrition. The\nHRS provides multistage sampling weights that correct for\nsample selection and nonresponse biases but do not account for\nattrition. To adjust for attrition, we estimated a logistic\nregression equation that predicted being in Wave 3. This used\ngender, race, marital status, various health measures (drinking,\nsmoking, body mass index, self-rated health, depression, and\nlimitations in activities of daily living, or ADLs), occupation,\nincome, assets, pension, job satisfaction, point of origin\n(foreign), social contacts with neighbors, proxy interview, and\nparticipation in the Wave 2 interview as independent variables.\nThe equation used the multistage sampling weights in the\nestimation of standard errors. From this equation we calculated\nthe probability of being in Waves 2, 3, or 4 for each respondent.\nWe then multiplied the inverse of this probability by the sam-\npling weight to arrive at a final weight that includes the\nprobability of being in the sample and being in all waves. The\nattrition weight is normalized so that weighted ns in the overall\nsample correspond to observed ns.\nImputation of missing values is recommended especially for\nlongitudinal studies (Little & Rubin, 1989) to allow general-\nizations from the original sample. Except for missing values on\nthe employment or retirement variables used to select our\nsubsample, we used multiple imputations to correct for\nselective nonresponse. These imputations provide valid stan-\ndard errors for all model parameter estimates (Davey, 2001;\ndraws were made using a standard noninformative prior and\nimputing every 2,000 iterations to construct five complete data\nsets. We analyzed each imputed data set separately, and we\nthen pooled results to arrive at final estimates of parameters and\ntheir standard errors. Note that some variables were already\nimputed in the HRS or the data set distributed by RAND (e.g.,\nfinancial information). Where available, we used the HRS or\nRAND imputations.\nMeasures\nThe main dependent variable is depressive symptoms. We\nmeasured depressive symptoms with selected items from the\nCenter for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D) scale\n(see Radloff, 1977). The items, wording, and scaling of\nmeasures from the CES-D scale differed between the first wave\nof the HRS and subsequent waves, and this is discussed\nextensively elsewhere (Steffeck, 2000). A random subsample of\n808 individuals received both measures (the original Wave 1\nmeasure and the new Wave 2 measure) at Wave 2. For Wave 1\n(a\u00bc.80) and for the Wave 2 subsample receiving both measures\n(a\u00bc.81), the original CES-D categories were 0\u00bcrarely or none\nof the time, 1 \u00bc some of the time, 2 \u00bc most of the time, and 3 \u00bc\nall or almost all of the time. For subsequent waves, responses\nwere coded as yes (1) or no (0) in response to the item stem\n``Much of the time during the past week you felt . . ..''\nTo achieve comparable measures between the first and\nsubsequent waves, we used the following procedure. Beginning\nwith the eight comparable domains (felt depressed, everything\nwas an effort, sleep was restless, felt happy, felt lonely, enjoyed\nlife, felt sad, couldn't get going), we reverse coded positively\nworded items, and we summed the eight items according to their\noriginal coding. From these scales, we next estimated a re-\ngression equation to predict Wave 2 scale scores (a \u00bc .85) from\nWave 2 scores on the module version, and from self-rated\nhealth, relative health (compared with a year ago), emotional\nhealth, limitations in activities of daily living, race (Black; other\nminority; White as reference category), age, age squared, and\ngender. The resulting regression equation predicted 71% of the\nvariance in Wave 2 scale scores. We then used this equation to\nestimate Wave 1 rescaled scores. In order to allow for\nuncertainty in these estimates, we added a normally distributed\nrandom variate with a mean of 0 and variance equal to the mean\nsquare error from the Time 2 equation to all estimates. To verify\nthat estimated rescaled scores behaved in a similar fashion to\nthe newly scaled Wave 2 scores, we compared correlation\ncoefficients between Wave 1 (original scale) scores and esti-\nmated Wave 1 rescaled scores with the correlation coefficients\nbetween Wave 2 module scores and Wave 2 scores. The\nformer correlation coefficient was .82 and the latter was .83.\nClearly, then, the behavior of our rescaled version of the Wave 1\nCES-D scale was highly consistent with what was observed with\nthe Wave 2 data.\nThe independent variables for the analyses are retirement,\nlength of retirement, spouse's employment or retirement status\nat Times 1 and 2, and spouse's enjoyment of joint activities.\nDefinitions of retirement can be ambivalent and often vary\nacross studies. In the HRS, several indicators of retirement are\navailable (Gustman & Steinmeier, 1995). We use a combination\nof labor force status (based on answers to this question: Are you\ndoing any work for pay at the present time? Yes or no) and the\nrespondent's self-definition as retiree (derived from answers\nto this question: Do you consider yourself partly retired,\ncompletely retired, or not retired at all?). Answer categories\nfor this question reflect the three retirement statuses implied in\nthe question (partly, completely, or not retired). For our\nanalyses, retirees are those who had worked 10 hr or more for\npay in the previous wave, stopped working between waves, and\nconsidered themselves as completely retired at Time 2. Persons\ndefined as continuous employees worked throughout all four\nwaves considered here and self-defined as ``not at all retired.''\nWe defined length of retirement as the time since the\nrespondent stopped working. We dichotomized this variable\ninto those who were retired up to 1 year at Time 2 and those\nretired more than 1 year. Because the length of retirement phases\nis not clear, we also subdivided the first group into those retired\nup to 6 months and those retired 7\u00ad12 months. Subdivision of\nthose retired over 1 year is not possible because of the smaller\nnumber of cases in this subgroup. We created dummy variables\nfor retirement status and length of retirement. Continuously\nemployed persons serve as reference in the analyses.\nFor spouses we rely exclusively on employment status (any\npay for work). We labeled spouses who did not work during\nboth waves as ``not employed,'' those who worked at Time 1 but\nhad stopped working by Time 2 as ``retirees,'' and those who\nworked at Time 2 as ``employed.'' The distribution of couples\nby respondent's own and spouse's employment status is shown\nin Table 1. The sample selection of persons aged 51 to 61\nat Wave 1 leads to a relatively young sample so that most\nindividuals remain continuously employed. Men are somewhat\nmore likely than women to have nonemployed spouses, whereas\nthe proportion of respondents whose spouses retired is slightly\nhigher for women. In line with earlier research, there is\na pronounced association between respondent's and spouse's\nOur other main independent variable is enjoyment of joint\nactivities with the spouse. We use respondents' answers to this\nquestion: Generally speaking, would you say that the time you\nspend together with your (husband, wife, or partner) is extremely\nenjoyable, very enjoyable, somewhat enjoyable, or not too\nenjoyable? Because most respondents answered positively, we\ncreated a dummy variable that distinguishes respondents who\nfind time with their spouse ``extremely enjoyable'' from all\nothers.\nControls\nPostretirement well-being has been linked to numerous\npredictors. We attempted to include variables that have been\nshown most consistently to influence postretirement well-being\nin the analyses, provided data were available. The first set of\ncontrols consisted of demographic background variables,\nnamely, age and race (all analyses were performed separately\nby gender). Race was entered in the form of three dummy\nvariables, that is, Black, Hispanic, and other race (Whites serve\nas reference).\nOur hypotheses refer to change in depressive symptoms after\nretirement. It is, therefore, essential that we control for\npreretirement psychological distress. We include depressive\nsymptoms at Time 1, as well as whether respondents ever had\npsychiatric problems measured at baseline.\nForemost among other predictors of postretirement well-\nbeing are health and economic situation (Bosse\nhealth we use four indicators, namely self-rated health and\nlimitations in ADLs, both measured at baseline, as well as\nchanges in these indicators between waves. We measured self-\nrated health with a single item: Would you say your health\nis. . .? Answer categories ranged from poor (1) to excellent (5).\nWe assessed limitations in ADLs across a variety of domains,\n16 of which were consistent across waves and were performed\nby sufficient numbers of participants to be useful. These\ndomains were as follows: walk several blocks; walk one block;\nwalk across a room; sit for about 2 hr; get up from a chair after\nsitting for long periods; get in and out of bed without help;\nTable 1. Distribution of Couples' Employment\u00adRetirement Patterns (Weighted Percentages)\nMen Women\nRespondent (%)\nSpouse\nRetired\nBetween\nWaves\nSpouse\nEmployed\nSpouse\nContinuously\nNot\nEmployed n\nSpouse\nRetired\nBetween\nWaves\nSpouse\nEmployed\nSpouse\nContinuously\nNot\nEmployed n\nclimb several flights of stairs without resting; climb one flight\nof stairs without resting; lift or carry weights over 10 lb; stoop,\nkneel, or crouch; pick up a dime from a table; bathe or shower\nwithout help; reach or extend your arms above shoulder level;\npush or pull large objects such as a living room chair; eat\nwithout help; and dress without help) However, there were\nsome differences in item scaling across waves. To ensure\ncomparability, we recoded items to 1 if the individual reported\nhaving any difficulty with the tasks, 0 if he or she did not, and\nmissing if the individual reported that he or she did not perform\na task. We then used the mean number of ADLs (multiplied by\n16 to retain the original scaling) in subsequent analyses. The\nfinal score could thus range from 0 to 16. The coefficient alpha\nassessed changes in health with simple change scores, that is,\nthe difference between Time1 and Time 2 scores. In the case of\nself-rated health, positive change scores indicate an increase in\nself-rated health. For limitations in ADLs, positive change\nscores reflect increases in limitations.\nWe used two measures to capture financial status--couples'\nincome and net worth. The former variable includes income of\nboth spouses from all income sources. Net worth reflects\ncouples' assets minus their debts. We rely on RAND imputed\nincome data, which are comparable over waves. In addition, we\ncomputed changes in assets and income between waves.\nPreliminary analyses revealed that asset changes and income\nhad no influence on results, and these variables were dropped in\nthe final models. We retained assets at baseline and change in\nincome between waves. We logged all income measures to\nadjust for skewed distributions.\nThe other socioeconomic status variable included in the\nanalyses was education (coded in years). We also considered\ncurrent or last occupation, but this variable had no effect on\nresults and was dropped from the final models. We further\nincluded selected job characteristics. Respondents were asked\nwhether their jobs required lots of physical effort; lifting heavy\nloads; stooping, kneeling, or crouching; good eyesight; intense\nconcentration; or skill in dealing with people. Answer\ncategories for these items ranged from 4 (almost all of the\ntime) to 1 (none or almost none of the time). A second item\nbattery referred to job difficulty (my job requires me to do\nmore difficult things than it used to; my job involves a lot of\nstress). Answers could range from 4 (strongly agree) to 1\n(strongly disagree). On the basis of factor analyses (available\nfrom A. Davey), we created three job characteristic variables:\nstress (job more difficult, job involves stress; a for the full\nsample ranges from .93 to .95 over the four waves);\nconcentration (job requires intense concentration, requires\npeople skills, requires good eyesight; a ranges from .96 to\n.98); and physical effort (physical effort, lifting, stooping; a\nranges from .93 to .94). Items for each subscale were summed.\nConcentration had little effect on results and was dropped from\nthe final models.\nAs postretirement well-being may be linked to individuals'\nwork commitment, we also included indicators for this concept,\nnamely, number of years in the current or last job (this is the\nbest work history variable available in the HRS) and perception\nof the importance of work. We derived the latter variable from\nthe question concerning whether individuals considered work\nmostly important as a source of income or whether they valued\ntheir work in itself; we coded it as 1\u00bconly income important, 2\n\u00bc both important, and 3 \u00bc work itself important.\nAnother important predictor of postretirement well-being is\nwhether retirement is perceived as voluntary (Hardy &\nQuadagno, 1995). Interviewers asked retirees whether retire-\nment ``was something you wanted to do or something you felt\nyou were forced into?'' The answer categories were as follows:\nwanted to, forced into, and part wanted, part forced. Because the\nlast category was not implied in the question, relatively few\nindividuals chose that answer. We thus created one dummy\nvariable in which those reporting exclusive ``forced'' retirement\nwere coded as 1 and the other two groups were coded as 0.\nThe final set of controls refers to marital characteristics and\nfamily and friend relations. For marital characteristics, we\nincluded length of marriage (in years, based on RAND\ncomputations) as well as spouse's limitations in ADLs and\nchange in spouse's ADLs over time. The latter two variables\nwere coded the same way as those for respondents. The family\u00ad\nfriend variables included whether respondents had grand-\nchildren (own or spouse's; 1 \u00bc yes and 0 \u00bc no), as well as an\nindex of social integration based on responses (1 \u00bc yes and 0 \u00bc\nno) to questions concerning whether respondents had children\nor stepchildren living within 10 miles, whether they had other\nrelatives in the neighborhood, and whether they had friends in\nthe neighborhood. The social integration index summed scores\nover these three variables and could range from 0 to 3. We\nmeasured the family\u00adfriend variables at Time 2. For length of\nmarriage we used the baseline wave. Means and standard\ndeviations of all variables are shown in Tables 2 and 3.\nAnalyses\nOur analyses are based on ordinary least squares (OLS)\nregressions adjusted for complex survey design (Stata, 2003),\nwith standard errors based on 1,000 bootstrapped samples to\nadjust for heteroscedasticity (Efron & Tibshirani, 1986). We\nalso considered alternative statistical models including Poisson\nregression with overdispersion and zero inflation, and interval\nresults as the OLS models, which we present here for ease of\ninterpretation.\nThe analyses were set up to test the hypotheses separately for\nmen and women. In Table 2 we present results for men who\nretired or remained continuously employed (reference) with\nspecific wife employment status categories as predictors,\nwhereas in Table 3 we show findings for women who either\nretired or remained continuously employed (reference) with\nhusbands' employment status categories as predictors. To test\nspecific hypotheses pertaining to spousal employment status, we\ndesigned models with divergent spouse employment status\ncategories as reference categories. In each case, we first\nestimated baseline models that included all predictor and control\nvariables without any interaction terms. Model 1a (in Tables 2\nand 3) uses ``spouse continuously not employed'' as the\nreference group, and Model 1b uses ``spouse employed'' as\nthe reference group; they are otherwise identical. To each of\nthese models, we next added the interaction terms for Own\nretirement 3 Spouse's employment status in order to test\nHypotheses 1a and 1b and 2a and 2b, again using ``spouse\ncontinuously not employed'' and ``spouse employed'' as the\nTable 2.

Finally, we\nincluded the interaction between Own retirement 3 Spouse's\nemployment 3 Enjoyment of joint activities. Tests for multi-\ncollinearity suggested that this was not a problem for our\nanalyses (mean variance inflation was ,2.00 for all analyses\nexcluding the interaction terms).\nRESULTS\nThe subsamples used for our analyses, as well as the\nestimated models, are geared to test the hypothesized relation-\nships. Although results pertaining to other predictors of\npostretirement depressive symptoms may be of interest, we\nconsequently focus our discussion exclusively on effects of\nretirement, length of retirement, spouse's employment status,\nand enjoyment of activities with the spouse. However, the full\nmodels including all covariates are shown in Tables 2 and 3\nalong with the relevant interaction effects. Preliminary analyses\nindicated that the effects of men's retirement were similar for 0\u00ad\n6 and 7\u00ad12 months postretirement, whereas those for women\nwere different for these periods. We consequently present\nmodels for men that distinguish solely between recent (1 year)\nand longer-term (.\n1 year) retirees (Table 2), whereas the\nanalyses for women refer to three separate postretirement\n1 year; see Table 3).\nAll analyses control for depressive symptoms at Time 1. The\nresults thus reflect depressive symptoms at Time 2 net of Time 1\nsymptoms. To ease interpretation of results, we also present the\nsignificant interaction effects in figures that were derived from\nthe Tables and are adjusted for mean levels on all covariates.\nOur initial analyses, for which we presented no hypotheses,\nindicated that none of the independent variables (length of\nretirement, spouse's employment status, and enjoyment of joint\nactivities) exerted a significant main effect on men's depressive\nsymptoms at Time 2 (Table 2, Models 1a and 1b). For women\n(Table 3, Model 1b) we find a negative effect of spouse's\nretirement; this suggests that women, regardless of their own\nemployment status, reported fewer depressive symptoms if their\nspouse retired than if he continued working.\nNext, we tested our study hypotheses. For men we\nhypothesized fewer depressive symptoms at Time 2 if they\nwere recently retired and their wives were either continuously\nnot working (Hypothesis 1a) or retired between waves\n(Hypothesis 1b). To test the first hypothesis (the hypothesized\ncoefficients are set in boldface in the tables), we contrasted\nrecently retired husbands whose wives were continuously\nnonworking (reference) with those whose wives remained\nemployed (Table 2, Model 2a). The finding supports the\nhypothesis. As shown in Figure 1 (first two bars for recent\nretirees), recently retired men reported more depressive\nsymptoms when their spouses worked (b \u00bc .90, p , .01) than\nwhen their spouses were continuously not employed (reference).\nNo similar effect of spouse's employment shows for long-term\nretired husbands (b \u00bc \u00c0.10, ns in Model 2a; first two bars for\nlong-term retired men in Figure 1).\nHypothesis 1b pertains to the effect of joint retirement on\nhusbands' depressive symptoms. We tested this hypothesis by\ncontrasting recently retired husbands whose wives remained\nemployed (reference) and those whose wives retired (see Model\n2b in Table 2). The results again confirm the hypothesis.\nRecently retired men whose wives retired report significantly\nfewer depressive symptoms (b \u00bc \u00c0.71, p , .05; see last two\nbars for recently retired men in Figure 1) than those whose\nwives remained employed (reference). In this case, however,\nthe effect for longer-term retired men is similar although it only\napproaches significance (b \u00bc \u00c0.67, p , .10; last two bars for\nlong-term retired men in Figure 1).\nIn addition to the hypothesized effects, the data also revealed\nthat longer-retired men whose spouses retired between waves\nreported significantly fewer depressive symptoms than longer-\nretired husbands whose wives were continuously not employed\n(Model 2a, b \u00bc\u00c0.76, p ,. 05, first and last bar for long-term\nretired men in Figure 1).\nThus, in line with Hypotheses 1a and 1b, recently retired men\nseem to be negatively affected by their spouses' continued\nemployment as compared with husbands whose wives were\nalready nonworking prior to the husband's retirement or retired\njointly with him. The longer-term effects of spouse's\nemployment status seem to depend on whether the wife was\ncontinuously nonemployed during the husband's retirement\ntransition or retired during the same period. Longer-retired men\nfare particularly well if they retired jointly with their spouses\nbut less well if their wives either remain employed or were\nalready nonworking prior to the husband's retirement.\nAmong women, effects of the spouse's employment or\nretirement generally seem more short lived than among men;\nthat is, differences by spouse's employment status occurred\nforemost among women retired 6 months or less. Our\nhypotheses for wives (2a and 2b) predict that short-term retired\nwives will report fewer depressive symptoms if they either\nretired jointly with their husbands (2a) or if their husbands\ncontinued to work (2b). To test these hypotheses, we first\ncontrasted women retirees whose husbands had retired with\nthose whose husbands were continuously not employed (Table\n3, Model 2a). The data provide support for Hypothesis 2a. Very\nrecently retired women (within 6 months) whose spouses retired\nbetween waves had significantly fewer depressive symptoms\nthan women whose husbands were continuously not employed\n(Table 3, Model 2a, b\u00bc\u00c0.97, p , .05; see first and third bars for\nrecently retired women in Figure 2). To test Hypothesis 2b, we\ncontrasted recent women retirees whose spouses were contin-\nuously employed with those whose spouses were continuously\nFigure 1. Men's depressive symptoms at Time 2, by own\nemployment\u00adretirement, length of retirement, and spouse's employ-\nment\u00adretirement.\nnot employed. The data again support the hypothesis. Recently\nretired women whose husbands remained employed reported\nsignificantly fewer depressive symptoms than those whose\nhusbands were continuously not employed (Table 3, Model 2a,\nb\u00bc\u00c01.09, p , .01; see first and second bars for recently retired\nwomen in Figure 2). In contrast to the findings for men (but in\nline with our hypotheses), very recent women retirees whose\nhusbands retired jointly with them do not differ from those\nwhose husbands remained employed (b \u00bc .11, ns in Table 3,\nModel 2b; second and third bars for recently retired women in\nFigure 2). These data confirm a honeymoon effect especially for\nrecently retired women who either retired before or jointly with\ntheir spouses, consistent with Hypotheses 2a and 2b. We find no\nsignificant effects of spouses' employment status for women\nretired 7 months or more.\nWe further hypothesized (Hypothesis 3) that the effects of\njoint retirement or wife's retirement prior to her husband's\nwould be strongest when spouses enjoyed their time together. In\norder to test this third hypothesis, we added a three-way\ninteraction between own length of retirement, spouse's\nemployment status, and enjoyment of joint activities. Our\nassumption was supported only for recently retired men who\nretired jointly with their wives. Recently retired men whose\nwives retired between waves and who enjoy joint activities\nreported significantly fewer depressive symptoms than recent\nmale retirees with retired spouses who derive less satisfaction\nfrom joint endeavors (see Table 2, Model 3a, and last two bars in\nFigure 3). Because none of these effects were significant for\nwomen, they are not included in Table 3.\nDISCUSSION\nInformed by a life course approach in conjunction with\nselected assumptions about retirement phases, gender role\nideology, and marital context, the preceding analyses tested\nwhether length of retirement, spouse's employment status, and\nenjoyment of joint activities influence postretirement depressive\nsymptoms.\nGenerally, our research supports a life course approach to\nretirement adaptation and indicates that the retirement experi-\nence is quite heterogeneous and contingent on the specific\ncontexts under which retirement occurs. Furthermore, the\ninfluence of such contexts may change over time or, in the\ncase of couples, encourage retirement of the partner. This\nheterogeneity of retirement experiences raises questions about\nearlier studies that only assess the direct effect of retirement\non well-being and ignore contingencies of the retirement\nHoward, 1997). Such research will tend to show little influence\nof retirement on well-being as positive and negative experi-\nences are averaged and thus provide few insights to guide\nretirement preparation and planning. Indeed, our data offer little\nsupport for a general effect of length of retirement on well-\nbeing, precisely because responses to retirement (including the\nexperience of a honeymoon) seem to be dependent on selected\nretirement contexts. Furthermore, if a retirement honeymoon\nperiod exists at all, it is not clear, as Atchley (1976) pointed out,\nhow long this phase lasts. Our results suggest that the\nhoneymoon may last longer among men than among women.\nTrue tests of retirement phases probably also require more\nfrequent interviews over time, as the analyses of Richardson\nand Kilty (1995) suggest as well. If, as our data show,\nvariability in the retirement experience is particularly pro-\nnounced in the immediate aftermath of retirement, then study\ndesigns with a relatively long time span between waves (i.e.,\ngreater than 6 months) may not capture such variation.\nRather than supporting a general honeymoon effect, the\nresults offer some support for the hypothesis that length of\nretirement and spouse's employment status interact in their\ninfluences on postretirement well-being. Recently retired\nhusbands report somewhat higher depressive symptoms if their\nwives continue to work outside the home. This finding is\nconsistent with earlier evidence (Moen et al., 2001; Myers &\nthat wives' continued employment runs counter to traditional\ngender role ideology and may therefore undermine retired\nhusbands' perceived status in the marriage. Other mechanisms\nthat may contribute to adjustment problems among recently\nretired husbands with still employed wives include conflicts\nsurrounding the division of household labor and the specific\nreasons for husbands' retirement prior to their wives. Although\nFigure 2. Women's depressive symptoms at Time 2, by own\nemployment\u00adretirement, length of retirement, and spouse's employ-\nment\u00adretirement.\nFigure 3. Short-term retired men's depressive symptoms at Time 2,\nby spouse's employment retirement, and enjoyment of joint activities\nwith spouse.\nretired husbands may take over some of their still-employed\nwives' housework, their wives still tend to carry the main\nresponsibility for household work (Szinovacz, 2000). Although\nwives may accept such inequity in the division of household\nlabor as long as their husbands are employed, they may no\nlonger accept it after husbands' retirement, leading to marital\nconflicts that are reflected in husbands' depressive symptoms. In\naddition, as one anonymous reviewer suggested, recently retired\nhusbands with employed wives may feel lonely and bored at\nhome until they develop postretirement activities and friend-\nships. It is also conceivable that husbands who retire prior to\ntheir wives do so as a result of adverse circumstances such as\nunemployment or poor health. Although we control for\n``forced'' retirement and health in the analyses, these controls\nmay not capture the full range of adverse retirement circum-\nstances. Clearly, more detailed data are needed to understand the\nprecise mechanisms leading to the negative influence of wives'\nemployment on their retired husbands' postretirement well-\nbeing.\nThe negative effect of wives' continued employment seems to\npersist over time, though it is somewhat weaker and only\napproaches significance for longer-retired men. Couples may\nresolve potential conflicts that arise from this arrangement and\nthus reduce its negative influence. Furthermore, retired hus-\nbands who are most troubled by their wives' employment may\nsucceed in persuading their wives to retire. Other research has\nshown that retired husbands whose wives are still employed\nexert pressure on their wives to retire as well (Skirboll &\nwould imply that couples remaining in the single-retired\nhusband status for some time are self-selected; that is, they\nunderrepresent couples in which husbands are particularly\nopposed to wives' continued employment.\nWe further find that husbands whose wives also retired\nbetween waves are quite happy in retirement. The positive\neffect of wives' retirement is particularly pronounced among\nlonger-retired husbands. This finding suggests that husbands'\nretirement honeymoon may be triggered by their wives in\nconjunction with or after their own retirement. Perhaps\nhusbands who initially opposed their wives' continued\nemployment are particularly happy in the aftermath of their\nwives' retirement.\nAs expected, the positive effect of both spouses' retirement\non husbands' well-being is limited to couples who enjoy joint\nactivities. Though hardly surprising, this finding once again\ndemonstrates the contextual nature of retirement adaptation\nprocesses. It also confirms earlier research showing the\nimportance of high marital quality and joint leisure activities\nfor retirees' well-being (Bosse\nsubsides over time. This suggests, on the one hand, that spouses\nwho do not enjoy joint activities are able to establish\nsatisfactory life routines after some time, but this seems to\ntake them longer than couples who favor joint endeavors. On\nthe other hand, the euphoria associated with joint retirement\nactivities among couples enjoying such endeavors may also be\ncurtailed over time. It might be difficult to maintain high\ninvolvement in particularly enjoyable joint activities such as\ntravel over long time periods. Couples may then be disap-\npointed that high expectations for joint retirement leisure are no\nlonger met, and such unmet expectations have been linked to\nreduced postretirement well-being (Vinick & Ekerdt, 1992).\nIt is notable that we do not find a similar interaction with\nenjoyment of joint activities for wives. Two explanations for\nthis result come to mind. First, wives are often responsible for\nplanning couples' postretirement activities and thus may be\nable to gear the couple's retirement endeavors into those\npursuits they themselves enjoy. In this case, couples' previous\nenjoyment of joint activities would have little influence on\nwives postretirement well-being. Second, husbands more than\nwives depend on the spouse for friendships and other social\nsupports (Huyck, 1995). Thus, wives whose marriages provide\nfew outlets for joint activities may be better able than husbands\nto find alternative social arrangements. Such arrangements\nseem to have a similar protective function against high\npostretirement depressive symptoms as joint spouse endeavors.\nA husband's retirement into a marriage in which the wife\nhas not been employed for some time has quite different\nramifications for his well-being than joint retirement. Under\nthis scenario, husbands show relatively few depressive\nsymptoms in the short term, but they report more depressive\nsymptoms after 1 year of retirement. This seems to suggest that\nafter a brief honeymoon, husbands whose wives were not\nemployed face some adjustment problems. On the basis of\nprevious research, we suggest that interference and insufficient\ndistance problems could be responsible for this finding. Wives\nof retired husbands sometimes feel that their husbands are\n``underfoot'' and impinge on their realm (Ekerdt & Vinick,\nsaying ``I married him for better or for worse but not for lunch''\nexemplifies such impingement (Vinick & Ekerdt, 1991b).\nWives with retired husbands may also complain about\ncurtailment of their privacy and the need to plan retirement\nactivities for their husbands (Gilford, 1986; Niederfranke,\n1991). Women who retired well before their husbands (or who\nare housewives) are most likely to have established household\nroutines and a lifestyle that incorporated their working\nhusbands' consistent absence from the home. These couples\nmay have problems finding the right balance of distance and\ntogetherness (Caradec, 1994), and wives' dissatisfaction with\ntheir husbands' impingement may undermine both spouses'\nwell-being (linked lives). It is also possible that separate\nretirements are more typical for less happily married spouses\nwho would then lack another salient life sphere after retirement.\nThe results for wives show more variability in postretirement\ndepressive symptoms over short time periods of 6 months or\nless. These recently retired wives report fewer depressive\nsymptoms either if they retired jointly with their husbands or if\ntheir husbands remain employed, relative to wives whose\nhusbands had already exited the labor force. This result\nsupports a joint retirement honeymoon experience, but in the\ncase of wives this experience seems to be quite short lived.\nWives whose husbands stopped working before the wife retired\ntend to report more depressive symptoms. This couple\nretirement pattern is most likely to induce husbands to exert\npressure on their wives to retire as well (Skirboll & Silverman,\ncontrol over their retirement decision and eventually undermine\npostretirement well-being. It is also conceivable that this\nretirement pattern occurs most commonly among couples in\nwhich the husbands were unable to remain in the labor force\n(displaced or disabled men). As already noted, our controls for\nhusbands' ADLs may be insufficient to capture all negative\neffects deriving from husbands' unemployment or disability.\nFurther analyses differentiating more clearly among truly\nretired and displaced or disabled husbands may shed more light\non this issue.\nTaken together, the results from this study support\na theoretical framework that combines the life course approach\nwith selected assumptions from other perspectives. They\ndemonstrate that it is often not the retirement transition per se\nthat influences postretirement well-being but rather the specific\ncircumstances or contexts under which retirement occurs or that\nclosely follow retirement. Our analyses demonstrate such\ncontextual effects for spouses' employment and marital quality.\nAlthough several of the hypotheses derived from our theoretical\nframework were supported by the data, large data sets such as\nthe HRS rarely include the detailed information necessary for\nunambiguous interpretations. Thus, more research (perhaps\nwith qualitative data) is needed to definitively explain the\nobserved trends.\nOur data further suggest that postretirement well-being is not\nstatic. This process-oriented view of retirement adaptation is\nconsistent with an assumption of retirement phases. However,\nsuch phases may be defined not only by time but also by\ncontextual changes. Because our data are restricted to two time\npoints, conclusions pertaining to postretirement changes in\nterms of length of retirement or the relative timing of spouses'\nretirement are tentative. Data comparing retirees over several\nwaves are needed to address retirement adaptation processes\nover time. Use of later waves of the HRS should offer such an\nopportunity. Furthermore, the first four waves of the HRS are\nrestricted to mostly younger and often early (exit before age 62\nor age 65) retirees. Consequently, our findings can only be\ngeneralized to this group, and couples retiring later may indeed\nhave different retirement experiences. Once again, later waves\nof the HRS can be used to explore this possibility.\nAnother limitation of our research pertains to the measure of\nmarital quality (enjoy time together) and number of cases. The\nmarital quality measures included in the HRS are quite basic\nand highly skewed. Given that interaction effects such as those\ntested here require quite large samples, especially to test effects\nfor more marginal groups (e.g., long-married spouses who do\nnot enjoy time together), we may very well have found stronger\neffects of this variable had we not recoded the data. However,\nthis would have led to extremely low cell counts and unstable\nresults. Once more HRS respondents have made the retirement\ntransition, it should become possible to explore postretirement\nexperiences among such marginal groups.\nDespite these caveats, our results lend themselves to some\nsuggestions for couples, policy makers, and practitioners.\nCouples need to plan not only for their postretirement finances\nbut also for their postretirement lifestyle. The current problems\nassociated with the wife's continued employment after the\nhusband's retirement or with husbands who pressure employed\nwives to retire may become less pronounced as less gender-role\ntraditional cohorts approach retirement. Nevertheless, careful\nplanning may help couples to achieve retirement timing patterns\nthat accommodate both spouses. Not only spouses' own actions\nbut retirement policies and programs that support couples' needs\nare essential to further postretirement well-being. Because\nhusbands are typically somewhat older than their wives, current\nSocial Security benefit regulations (and many pension plans)\nreinforce a retirement pattern in which husbands retire first.\nCouples tend to respond by some adjustments in retirement age\n(Szinovacz, 2002), which can lead to benefit reductions\nespecially for wives. Proposals that emphasize a life course\nperspective of labor force attachments and leaves would be more\nin line with retiring (and younger) couples' needs.\nSimilarly, couples need to learn, perhaps through retirement\npreparation programs or in more extreme cases marital therapy,\nhow to develop mutually enjoyable endeavors and how to find\nthe best distance in their postretirement relationship. To be\nmore useful to couples, retirement preparation programs require\nsome changes. The nearly exclusive emphasis on financial\nissues may distract couples from other potential retirement\nproblems. Couples would benefit more from these programs\nwere they to adopt a broader and research-based perspective.\nOur research demonstrates the validity of the life course\nperspective and the importance of marital context for post-\nretirement well-being: How well spouses fare in retirement is\ncontingent on spouses' employment status as well as marital\nquality. They also show that her and his retirement experiences\nare indeed different. It is only by capturing such complexities\nthat we will gain full understanding of retirement adaptation\nprocesses.\n"
