Introduction\nThe U.S. criminal justice system is said to be in a period of \"mass imprisonment\" that\nEqually important and frequently commented on is the fact that the current U.S. prison population\nis overwhelmingly, disproportionately black. Whereas the incarcerated population is now over 50%\nblack, the U.S. population itself is somewhat less than 13% black. Thus, the racial composition of\nprisoners is a defining characteristic of the current mass imprisonment period, with many scholars\nasserting that the United States' incarceration problem is at its core a racial issue [2,5,6].\nExtreme racial disproportionality in the U.S. prison population has not always been the case.\nRather, the proportion of the incarcerated population that is black actually grew over much if not all of\nthe 20th century. In 1926, only 21% of the individuals sentenced to state or federal prison were black,\nbut by the 1990s the comparable figure was over 50% [7]. This dramatic increase in the incarceration\nof African Americans occurred during a period that witnessed considerable improvements in their\nsocial and economic status, including gains in income, occupational position, and education [8\u00ad10].\nThis paper presents analyses aimed at explaining the dramatic increase in the racial difference in\nincarceration (hereafter referred to as RDI) between 1940 and 1980. We begin with a simple accounting\nmodel based on Cohen and Canela-Cacho [11] that breaks the national trend into changes in population,\narrests, and sentencing. About one-third of the increase in the RDI over this period is due to greater\nblack population growth relative to whites. The remaining increase in RDI can be attributed mostly to\ndifferential changes in arrest rates between 1940 and 1960 and to differential changes in sentencing\nIn order to further analyze the influences of various factors on white trends in incarceration,\nblack trends in incarceration, and the trend in the RDI, we then model state-level variation in\nincarceration by race between 1940 and 1980. This model suggests that differential population increase,\nmigration from low to high incarceration states, and increasing incarceration rates in states that\nexperienced population growth and net in-migration together account for about 67 percent of the\nFinally, in order to further understand racial changes in incarceration, we model black and white\nincarceration rates over time using state fixed effects and time-varying state characteristics by race,\nincluding demographic and economic composition, population growth, migration, urbanization,\npolitical context, and segregation. Accounting for demographic and economic composition of the\nblack and white populations in 1940 actually increases the RDI in that year substantially, as the RDI\nwould have been even larger had whites not been much better off than blacks on those dimensions.\nBetween 1940 and 1980 the RDI increases in large part because the relevant characteristics of whites\nimproved more than those of blacks over this period. In fact, controlling for these changes in the\ndemographic and economic characteristics of the two populations actually reverses the residual\ntrend in RDI from increasing to decreasing. In other words, had blacks' demographic and economic\ncharacteristics improved as rapidly as whites' throughout the period, the RDI would have declined\nsignificantly. Migration, population growth, and urbanization variables explain some of the gap\npolitical context further reduces the RDI in 1940 slightly and plays a minor role in flattening the trend\nonly a small portion of the remaining trend. A set of Blinder-Oaxaca type decomposition exercises\npinpoints more precisely the sources and timing of these changes.\nWe begin by describing racial differences in incarceration in the 20th century and the explanations\nin the literature that have been offered for this trend. We motivate our analysis by arguing that although\nthe United States experienced considerable population growth, migration, and urbanization during\nthe 1940\u00ad1980 period, all of which varied by race, these factors have not been previously considered as\nexplanations for changes in incarceration rates. Our analysis proceeds in three parts. We conclude by\nsummarizing the results and discussing their implications.\n2. Racial Differences in Incarceration in the 20th Century\nFigure 1 reports trends in incarceration by race between 1923 and 2000. The topmost line shows\nthe racial composition of inmates in federal and state prisons and local jails from 1923 to 2000,\nbased on decennial census data from 1940 to 2000 and a special survey of correctional institutions\nconducted by the Census Bureau in 1923 [12]. The proportion of inmates who were black appears to\nbe relatively constant or slightly declining between 1923 and 1940 (though caution should be exercised\nin interpreting this trend since it is based on only two time points and we know little about the quality\ninmates who were black actually declined slightly during the 1990s.1 The remaining two lines show the\nblack and white incarceration rates. These show the now well-documented increase in incarceration\nafter 1980, which affected blacks much more dramatically. However, it is striking that the RDI increased\nbetween 1940 and 1980 despite relatively flat incarceration rates for both racial groups. In the remainder\nof the paper we focus on the period between 1940 and 1980, the period prior to the impact of the\npolicy changes related to the \"war on drugs\" and determinant sentencing that have been the focus of\nprevious research. The question this paper addresses is, what factors might account for the changes in\ntwo lines show the black and white incarceration rates. These show the now well-documented\nincrease in incarceration after 1980, which affected blacks much more dramatically. However, it is\nstriking that the RDI increased between 1940 and 1980 despite relatively flat incarceration rates for\nboth racial groups. In the remainder of the paper we focus on the period between 1940 and 1980, the\nperiod prior to the impact of the policy changes related to the \"war on drugs\" and determinant\nsentencing that have been the focus of previous research. The question this paper addresses is, what\nfactors might account for the changes in the racial difference in incarceration between 1940 and\nFigure 1. Incarceration in prisons and jails, by race.\nIn the remainder of this section, we discuss existing scholarship on race and the criminal justice\nsystem that provides possible explanations for the rise in the RDI between 1940 and 1980. We discuss\nexplanations that are specific to the 1940\u00ad1980 historical period, the focus of this study, and\nexplanations that have been offered for the increasing RDI in later periods. It is important to\nconsider whether explanations developed to account for the more recent rise in the RDI might also\naccount for the rise during the 1940\u00ad1980 period. The explanations we discuss generally center\nconceptually on either (a) the economic and demographic causes of changes in crime rates or (b) the\npunitiveness of the criminal justice system. While it is important to distinguish such processes\nconceptually, key social changes over our period of interest, such as the northern migration and\nurbanization of the black population, are thought to be related to both types of processes.\n2.1. Economic and Demographic Change\nWe begin with economic and demographic changes that might have impacted incarceration\nrates through their impact on crime rates. One of the most significant demographic changes in the\nmiddle of the 20th century was the \"Second Great Migration\" of blacks from the rural and urban\nSouth to the urban North, a process that accompanied the continued transformation of the economy\nfrom agriculture to manufacturing, particularly in the period after World War II [13]. Between the\n1930s and 1960s much of the black population moved north and into urban areas. Jaynes and\nWilliams [10] have speculated that long-term increases in black incarceration rates in this century are\nand 11.0% in 2000. These numbers presumably almost entirely reflect the increasing numbers of\nHispanic/Latino inmates beginning in the 1970s. Trends are comparable if we use the ratio of black to white\ninmates. In 2000, the black count is those reporting black alone as their race and the white count is those\nreporting white alone.\nFigure 1. Incarceration in prisons and jails, by race.\nIn the remainder of this section, we discuss existing scholarship on race and the criminal justice\nsystem that provides possible explanations for the rise in the RDI between 1940 and 1980. We discuss\nexplanations that are specific to the 1940\u00ad1980 historical period, the focus of this study, and explanations\nthat have been offered for the increasing RDI in later periods. It is important to consider whether\nexplanations developed to account for the more recent rise in the RDI might also account for the rise\nduring the 1940\u00ad1980 period. The explanations we discuss generally center conceptually on either\n(a) the economic and demographic causes of changes in crime rates or (b) the punitiveness of the\ncriminal justice system. While it is important to distinguish such processes conceptually, key social\nchanges over our period of interest, such as the northern migration and urbanization of the black\npopulation, are thought to be related to both types of processes.\n2.1. Economic and Demographic Change\nWe begin with economic and demographic changes that might have impacted incarceration rates\nthrough their impact on crime rates. One of the most significant demographic changes in the middle\nof the 20th century was the \"Second Great Migration\" of blacks from the rural and urban South to\nthe urban North, a process that accompanied the continued transformation of the economy from\n1 The top line of Figure 1 contains the number of black inmates divided by the total number of inmates of any race.\nThe proportion of inmates who were neither black nor white increased steadily after 1970. While only 2.2% of inmates were\npresumably almost entirely reflect the increasing numbers of Hispanic/Latino inmates beginning in the 1970s. Trends are\ncomparable if we use the ratio of black to white inmates. In 2000, the black count is those reporting black alone as their race\nand the white count is those reporting white alone.\nagriculture to manufacturing, particularly in the period after World War II [13]. Between the 1930s and\n1960s much of the black population moved north and into urban areas. Jaynes and Williams [10] have\nspeculated that long-term increases in black incarceration rates in this century are due to the effects\nof the Great Depression and the social dislocation caused by World War II, as well as the subsequent\nurbanization of blacks with the decline of Southern agriculture. Urban areas have consistently had\nhigher crime rates [14,15], and during much of the 20th century the racial differential in incarceration\nhas been considerably larger in the North than in the South, although that difference declined in the\nlater part of the century [16\u00ad20]. As a result, the migration of blacks off the farm to cities in the North\nand South may have substantially contributed to increases in the overall RDI.\nEconomic changes that have disadvantaged blacks may also play a role in changes in the RDI.\nDuster has argued that economic changes particularly impacted black youth, resulting in increased\ncontact with the criminal justice system [21]. During much of the period in which we are interested,\nyouth unemployment rates rose considerably, in great part because of declines in agricultural\nemployment [22], in part because of increases in school enrollment and military enlistment [23], and in\npart due to declines in manufacturing in inner cities [24]. Manufacturing employment, which provides\nrelatively high wages for low-skilled work, is negatively associated with crime [25]. Yet many studies\nhave examined the effects of unemployment on crime rates with mixed findings [15,26\u00ad29]. In addition,\nrate of incarceration of blacks in the North is positively associated with unemployment rates and\nnegatively associated with manufacturing output.\nSeveral other demographic changes during the 20th century should also be considered.\nThe migration of blacks from the South to the urban North was also accompanied by an increase in\nracial segregation, as blacks were restricted to ghetto neighborhoods in northern cities by government\npolicies and white violence [30]. As Massey and Denton [30] argue, segregation coupled with higher\npoverty rates among blacks concentrates blacks in poor neighborhoods, potentially increasing crime\nin black communities [25,31\u00ad34]. To the extent that racial segregation concentrates poor blacks,\nand concentrated disadvantage leads to lower social control, segregation may increase crime among\nblacks [35\u00ad38]. The geographic concentration of blacks may also change the character of policing\nin black communities to focus on arrest rather than crime prevention or hide the consequences of\nincreased incarceration from whites.\nWithin-race income inequality is another possible explanation. Even as the economic and social\nstatus of the average black individual has increased, income and educational inequality has grown\nwithin both the black and white populations [10,39]. According to Wilson [24], the growth of the black\nmiddle class and their exit from inner-city communities weakened the institutional foundations of those\ncommunities, leading to a decline in social organization and social control in ghetto neighborhoods.\nLaFree and Drass [40] show that changes in intra-racial income inequality predict changes in arrest\nrates for robbery, burglary, and homicide among both blacks and whites between 1957 and 1990 and\nthat increased education among blacks is associated with higher black arrest rates, but only during\nperiods of rising inequality.2\nFinally, the number of single-parent households increased over most if not all of this period,\ngrowing up in single-parent households are more likely to be involved in crime. In fact, a number of\nstudies have demonstrated the strong effects of single-parent households on crime rates, especially for\njuveniles [26,37,45,46], making this an important possible cause of increases in the racial differential\nin imprisonment.\n2 Jacobs and Helms [41] and Jacobs and Kleban [42] find that overall economic inequality is associated with greater overall\nincarceration rates. Jacobs and Richardson [43] find that higher overall economic inequality is also associated with higher\nhomicide rates.\n2.2. Race, Politics, and the Punitiveness of the Criminal Justice System\nAnother strand of the literature focuses on the enduring link in American political culture between\nblackness and criminality, as well as the longstanding practice of using the criminal justice system as a\ntool for the social control of blacks and their labor [47\u00ad49]. For example, there is a branch of literature\nthat examines incarceration rates in the South after the Civil War, when imprisonment replaced slavery\nboth as a mechanism of social control and as a way of recreating a captive labor force through the use\nof chain gangs (Hawkins [17] and Sabol [19] provide short reviews of this research). The punitiveness\nof the criminal justice should be examined both with regard to arrest and with regard to sentencing,\nas Sabol [19] demonstrates that at the state level changes in the relative arrest rates cannot fully explain\nchanges in the racial differential in incarceration.\nThe dominant account in this literature views the increasing punitiveness of the criminal justice\nsystem as a backlash against black gains that stemmed from the Civil Rights movement and white fears\nfollowing the urban unrest of the 1960s. Such fears were fomented and capitalized upon by Republican\npoliticians such as Barry Goldwater and Richard Nixon, who ushered in an era of \"Law and Order\"\npolitics [4,6,47,48,50]. These political actors, drawing upon the longstanding association between race\nand crime in American political culture, reframed urban unrest by linking it to violent crime and racial\nthreat more generally in a move to separate middle and working class whites from the Democratic\nparty coalition [51].\nA recent wave of political science research adds two important modifications to this dominant\naccount. One modification is that violent crime rose dramatically between the mid-1960s and mid-1970s,\nand as a result middle and working class blacks were also supportive of a more punitive criminal\njustice system [51\u00ad53]. This links the political story to the above discussion of within-race inequality.\nThe second modification is that the institutional and cultural roots of the expansion of the criminal\njustice system were developed before the era of Law and Order politics. The 1968 Safe Streets and\nCrime Control Act established the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration, which provided\nresources for the expansion of the criminal justice bureaucracy and the state capacity to punish,\ndeveloped a constituency of professionalized criminal justice actors with a stake in crime control policy\nand punishment, and cemented federal-state interconnections around crime policy that would be\nnecessary for the implementation of federal policies at the state and local levels [49,54]. Moreover,\nMurakawa argues that the cultural roots of a more punitive criminal justice system were fomented by\nboth \"race liberals\" and \"race conservatives\", with race liberals viewing a stronger, more professional\ncriminal justice system as necessary to defend blacks from white violence and discrimination, and race\nconservatives viewing the criminal justice system as a protection against violence by blacks and a\nbulwark against the Civil Rights movement [49].\nEmpirical research attempting to link these shifts in political context to changes in the criminal\njustice system has focused on two processes. Most of this research concentrates on the period after 1970\nand the rise of Law and Order politics. One focus is discrimination within the criminal justice system.\nBlumstein [55,56] and Tonry [6] describe the considerable increase in the relative rate of drug arrests\nand subsequent changes in imprisonment for nonwhites since the mid-1970s. Sampson and Laub [57],\nFeeley and Simon [58], and Tonry [6] have all argued that the \"War on Drugs\" has become a \"War on\nthe Black Underclass\", resulting in increasingly racially discriminatory practices by the judicial system.\nJencks [59] and Sampson and Laub [57] show that during the 1980s the racial differential in serious\nshowing increases in racial differential relative to changes in the racial differential in crime.3\n3 The question of racial discrimination is a complicated one. At times researchers have argued that the criminal justice system\nis more lenient in its treatment of blacks because the victims of crimes committed by blacks are typically black (see Mann [15]\nfor a discussion of the extensive literature on capital punishment related to this issue). At other times researchers have\nargued that there is discrimination in the form of more severe treatment of blacks. There is also evidence that other forms of\ndiscrimination have lessened or at least remained the same over the last several decades [10].\nA second and related focus is changes in policy, particularly greater likelihood of sentencing\nJacobs and his colleagues have argued that the rise of law-and-order politics by the Republican\nparty has contributed to increased incarceration of minorities, showing that Republican strength\nis related to state variation in black incarceration rates and local variation in racial differences in\nof capital punishment [67] and support for liberal policies [68]. Incarceration rates for minorities and\npolice strength are both higher in states or cities with more minorities [2,41,63\u00ad65,69]. However, Stucky,\nHeimer, and Lang's [70] finding that the relationship between partisan politics and incarceration\ndepends on the degree of electoral competition suggests that political context may not necessarily\nhave the same effects in all time periods. We know of no research that has directly examined these\nrelationships in earlier periods.\nIn sum, existing research suggests a number of factors that might account for the increase in\nthe RDI between 1940 and 1980, including population growth, migration, urbanization, segregation,\nemployment, age composition, within-race inequality, single parenthood, education, and political\ncontext. The analyses that follow investigate racial differences in incarceration between 1940 and 1980,\nexamining these factors. Although our primary interest is in demographic factors, particularly urbanization\nand migration, we consider other factors as well because they are possible complementary explanations.\n3. Data and Methods\nOur analysis is divided into three parts, each building upon the next. The first analyzes national\ndata on trends in population size, arrests, and sentencing by race. The second uses state-level data\nto decompose the change in the RDI into components due to changes in population size, migration\nbetween states, and changes in state incarceration rates. The third, also employing state-level data over\ntime, examines specific hypotheses about the predictors of black and white incarceration rates and\nwhether such predictors can account for the trend in the RDI using Poisson regression. We discuss the\ndata and methodology for each in turn.\n3.1. Part I: A National Accounting Model\nWe first present an ideal model, and then discuss the model we can actually estimate with the data\nat hand as well as its limitations. Ideally, imprisonment should be analyzed as a multistage process of\nwhich incarceration is the final outcome. First (in most cases, presumably), a crime must be committed.\nA person then is at risk of being arrested, and finally may be sentenced to serve time. To approximate\nthis process, we propose a simple accounting model containing the following quantities:\nX = number of people in the population,\nrc = crime rate,\nra = rate of arrest for a crime,\nrs = rate at which individuals arrested for a crime are sentenced (convicted),\nrp = rate of imprisonment of those sentenced,\nC = number of crimes committed,\nA = number of arrests,\nS = number of people sentenced to prison,\nP = number of prisoners in a given year.\nFinally, define: rac \" rarc, rsac \" rsrarc, etc. Then:\nC \" rcX (1)\nA \" raC \" racX (2)\nS \" rs A \" rsaC \" rsacX (3)\nP \" rpS \" rps A \" rpsaC \" rpsacX (4)\nWe can think of this model as applying to an entire population and the overall crime rate, or we\ncan think of it as applying to specific subpopulations and/or particular crimes. In addition, \"sentence\"\nto prison can be understood as broadly capturing any entry into prison, whether for new sentences or\nviolations of probation or parole. In other words, by sentencing we mean both front-end and back-end\nsentencing. Sentence length is also implicitly included in the sentencing component of the model\n(see also footnote 5 below). Obviously, it would be desirable to break sentencing as we have defined it\ninto its constituent parts, but the data needed to do so do not, as far as we know, exist.\nThe model needs to pertain to a specific period of time. Here we assume that the period is\none year. There are then three aspects of this model that are potentially unrealistic simplifications.\nFirst, individuals may commit more than one crime each year, as some individuals surely do, and they\nmay be arrested more than one time, as some individuals surely are. The model, however, assumes\nthat committing a crime, being arrested for the crime, and being sentenced all take place in a given year.\nIf year-to-year changes in these rates are small, as we would generally expect, this poses no problem.\nA second simplification in this model is that if an individual is in prison for part of the year, during that\ntime s/he does not have the same potential for committing crimes and being arrested. Thus the model\ndoes not take into account the potential incapacitation effects of imprisonment. For simplification, we\nwill also assume that there is a linear relationship between the number of individuals sentenced to\nprison in a given year, S, and the number of individuals in prison, P.4\nThe advantage of this accounting model is that it can be used to decompose the different\ncomponents of change in the overall number of individuals in prison. Equation (4) above implies:\nXrcrarsrp \" P (5)\nThe number of people in prison, P, is the product of the number of people in the population, X,\ntimes the crime rate, rc, times the arrest rate, ra, times the sentencing rate, rs, times the imprisonment\nrate, rp. In accounting for change, it is natural to think about how different factors affect the different\nrates in this model. In order to simplify our decomposition it is useful to put Equation (5) in log form\nso that we have an additive instead of multiplicative equation, giving us:\nlnX ` lnrc ` lnra ` lnrs ` lnrp \" lnP (6)\nWe can think of changes as potentially acting on any one of the five components to produce\nchange in ln P. Similarly, we can decompose the racial difference in ln P into differences in the above\nfive components, and we can break down the changes in the racial difference in ln P into changes in\nthe racial differences in each of the five components. Below we do this using national data.\nUnfortunately, existing data do not allow for measurement of all the components of the model,\nnecessitating some simplifications that lead to limitations of the analysis. We have measures of neither\n4 In reality, the number of people in prison at any time is a function of the number of prisoners admitted in prior years and\ntheir actual sentence lengths. Specifically, if we let St be the number of people sentenced in year t, Pt be the number of people\nin prison at time t, and rpi\nt\u00b4i\nbe the proportion of the individuals who have prison terms greater than i years which start in\nyear t-i, then (assuming that prison terms are in yearly increments) the number of individuals in prison at time t is:\nPt \"\nt\n\u00ff\nrpi\nt\u00b4i\nSt\u00b4i\n(A continuous time version of this equation can be constructed using integrals.) Incorporating this correctly into the model\nis nontrivial. In addition, the data needed to calculate the terms in this formula are only available for the most recent time\nperiods. Our model is an approximation that assumes the distribution of prison terms is stationary. If the distribution of\nprison terms is stationary, then rp will be equal to the reciprocal of the mean length of prison term.\nthe crime rate, rc, nor the imprisonment rate given sentencing, rp, by race for the entire time period.\nTherefore, we drop ln rc from the model and measure the arrest rate, ra', as the rate of arrest among\nthe population (rather than among those who have committed crimes). This means that changes in\n\"arrest\" in the results presented below incorporate both changes in criminal behavior and changes in\nthe law enforcement response to that behavior. We also drop ln rp from the model, assuming that rp = 1,\nper our discussion in footnote 5. This means that the sentencing component captures only sentencing\nto prison and not all determinations of guilt (convictions). The final model is thus:\nlnX ` lnra ` lnrs \" lnP (7)\nor equivalently:\nXrars \" P (8)\nIn words, the number of people in the population times the population arrest rate times the rate\nat which people arrested are sentenced to prison equals the number of people in prison.\nNational data on population and federal and state prison inmates by race come from published\nCensus Bureau sources for each census year. Data on prison admissions by race come from the Bureau\nof Justice Statistics [7], and data on arrests by race from the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports. We include\narrests for Part I Index Crimes (murder, non-negligent manslaughter, rape, robbery, aggravated assault,\nburglary, larceny, auto theft, and arson) plus drug crimes. The raw data and intermediate calculations\non which the analysis below is based are provided in Appendix A, Tables A1 and A2.\nThe UCR data are imperfect in three ways. First, not all police agencies report arrests to the FBI.\nWe inflate arrest counts using data on the proportion of the total U.S. population living in reporting\nareas in the applicable year. We are unable to calculate separate inflation factors by race. Second,\nin 1940 and 1950, arrests by race are based on fingerprint cards submitted to the FBI and therefore\nlikely understate the total number of arrests. Since we focus on the most serious crimes, the degree of\nunderstatement may be small. These problems will affect our main results only if they vary significantly\nby race. The standard solution to underreporting in UCR data (using only homicides, which are least\nsubject to underreporting) is not appropriate here, since we are working with all Part I index crimes\nand rates of arrests and sentences to prison are likely to be different for homicides as compared to\nall Part I crimes. Third, arrests are only reported to the FBI when three conditions are met: when at\nleast one person is arrested, charged, and prosecuted for an offense. This means that arrests leading to\ndropped charges or dismissals are not recorded in the data, understating arrests. This will be a problem\nif rates of dropped charges or dismissals vary by race and/or time, but the degree to which this is the\ncase is unclear. See Lynch and Addington [71] for a more detailed discussion of the weaknesses of\nthe UCR data.\n3.2. Part II: Decomposing State-Level Variation in Incarceration Rates\nTo further understand the sources of changes in the RDI, we use state-level data from the 1940\nthrough 1980 censuses to model variation in prison populations by race using Poisson regression [72].\nIn Poisson regression, one moves between counts and rates by including the log of the number of\nindividuals at risk (the exposure) as an independent variable in the rate equation with its coefficient\nconstrained to one (so called \"normalization\"). Specifically, we model the incarceration rate of\nthe population:\nP{X \" f pZbq (9)\nwhere Z is a vector of characteristics for an area, b is a vector of parameters to be estimated measuring\nthe relation between each characteristic, and f is some function. Since P/X is a rate, it is natural to\nassume that it is linear in the logs, that is5:\nOur unit of analysis in this model is the race by state combination in each census year 1940\u00ad1980.\nWe use data from the 39 states that contained the vast majority of the black population between 1940\nand 1980. Excluded states include Alaska, Hawaii, Maine, Montana, New Hampshire, North Dakota,\nSouth Dakota, Utah, Vermont, and Wyoming. In these states, published census reports of number\nof inmates are not broken down by race in many of the years in our data, and because there are\nso few blacks in these states, estimates of state level variables for blacks from sample microdata\n(used in Part III below) have substantial measurement error or are impossible to calculate. We also\nexclude Washington, D.C. because of incomplete political data and its hybrid local/federal justice\nsystem. Excluding these states and D.C. leads to the loss of between one and two percent of the black\npopulation and between one and 2.5 percent of black inmates across all years. Because our analyses\nweight using the state population for each race, the dropped observations if included would have\nlittle effect on our estimates. Weighting by the state population for each race also ensures that the\ndecomposition reflects national-level changes in the RDI and corresponds to the national accounting\nmodel in Part I.\nOur goal in this analysis is to decompose changes over time in the racial difference in incarceration\ninto components associated with demographic processes related to migration and population growth\nat the state level. We begin in this section with a simple Poisson regression model of the number of\ninmates (I) by state (s) by time (t) by race (b):\nln pIstbq \" ln pPopstbq ` a ` b1B ` b2T ` b3S ` b4 pB ^ Tq ` b5 pS ^ Bq ` b6 pS ^ Tq ` e (11)\nwhere:\nIstb = number of inmates in state s at time t of race b\nPopstb = population in state s at time t of race b\nB = black dummy (1 for blacks, 0 for whites)\nT = set of time dummies\nS = set of state dummies\nB ^ T = set of race by time interaction dummies\nS ^ B = set of state by race interaction dummies\nS ^ T = set of state by time interaction dummies\nThis model is almost fully saturated, and we can think of the error term as representing the\nmissing B ^ T ^ S interaction. Note that ln pPopstbq is the \"exposure\" in Poisson regression and its\ncoefficient is constrained to 1.\nWe use estimates from this model in conjunction with state by race population weighted means\nfor the variables to decompose trends over time in white incarceration and black incarceration.\nWe then subtract these race-specific decompositions to reveal the components of the racial difference\nin incarceration over the time period. The procedure is as follows:\n(1) Estimate the model to generate the coefficients a and b1 through b6.\n(2) Calculate population-weighted means for each variable in each year for each race.\n5 This amounts to examining changing in ln X and ln rcasp in the accounting model in Part I (Section 3.1).\n(3) For each race and year combination, calculate the components of the overall predicted value from\nthe model using the estimated coefficients from step 1 and the means from step 2. The contribution\nof the various components will be a function of both their changes over time (captured by the\nmeans) and their impact on incarceration (captured by the coefficients).\n(4) Separately by race, subtract the components across years to decompose trends in white\nincarceration over time and black incarceration over time. Here we compare adjacent census\nyears with one another and, in order to examine the entire period, compare 1940 to 1980.\n(5) Subtract the components of the black trends from the components of the white trends in order to\ndecompose changes in RDI into its component parts.\nThe weighting of the means in Step 2 is critical because it allows differences in the population\ndistribution across races, states, and years to influence the total contribution of the components derived\nfrom the dummy variables and interactions. Note that this procedure is similar to a Blinder-Oaxaca\ndecomposition [73,74], which decomposes differences between groups or time periods into differences\ndue to differences in mean characteristics (so called \"endowments\") and differences in effects of\nthose characteristics by group (coefficients). The most well-known applications of the Blinder-Oaxaca\ndecomposition are to labor market discrimination by race and gender, in which differences in mean\nwages by race or gender are decomposed into differences in group characteristics (e.g., education,\nwork experience) and differences in \"returns\" to those characteristics, with differences in returns being\ninterpreted as evidence of discrimination. The decomposition here is more complex because it involves\nboth race and time (for multiple time periods), but the intuition is similar. We are decomposing\nthe racial and temporal differences in means in incarceration into components due to the changing\ncharacteristics of each group at each time point (here the size of each group and where members of\neach group live) and the effects of those characteristics (differences in incarceration rates by race in\ndifferent states).\nEach term on the right side in the equation makes a different type of contribution to the decomposition.\nWe explain this in detail to ensure that the reader will understand the results reported below.\nln pPopstbq Captures changes in the relative size of black as opposed to white population.\na Does not appear in decomposition (constant is subtracted out).\nb1B Does not appear in decomposition (common race effect over time is subtracted out).\nb2T Does not appear in decomposition (common time effects across race are subtracted out).\nb3S Captures the influence of population increases (presumably through migration) in states\nwith higher incarceration rates.\nb4 pB ^ Tq Captures the remaining trends in the racial difference in incarceration, which we seek to\nexplain in this study.\nb5 pS ^ Bq Captures the influence of black population increases in states that disproportionately\nincarcerate blacks.\nb6 pS ^ Tq Captures the influence of population change in states with changing incarceration rates\nover time.\n3.3. Part III: Modeling Incarceration Rates Using State Characteristics\nFinally, we model state-by-race-by-time-specific incarceration levels--our basic dependent\nvariable--using state-level characteristics that measure the processes suggested by the theories\noutlined above. The goal is to provide specific tests of hypotheses about predictors of black and\nwhite incarceration rates and to examine the extent to which these predictors can account for the\nchange in the RDI. These analyses also provide an additional test of the role of demographic processes\nsuch as migration and the accompanying urbanization and segregation that occurred throughout the\nperiod of interest by measuring those processes directly.\nTable 1 describes the measurement of our state characteristic variables that operationalize these\ntheories. Most state characteristics come from published census bureau reports and from census\nmicrodata aggregated to the state level by race and year [75]. Political data were generated from\nICPSR's Candidate Name and Constituency Totals dataset [76]. Segregation measures come from data\nassembled by Jacob Vigdor [77].\nTable 1.

Source: Decennial Census [75] unless otherwise noted.\nWe operationalize general economic wellbeing among those most likely to be incarcerated as\nwage income at the 25th percentile of the wage income distribution of employed males 16 years\nand older (in thousands of 1990 dollars). Female-headed families are measured by the proportion\nof mothers with children under 18 without a husband present in the household. Unemployment is\nmeasured as the unemployment rate for males 16 years and older. Education levels are operationalized\nas the proportion of people 18 years old and over who have graduated from high school. Changes\nin the age structure of the population are operationalized as the percentage of all individuals who\nare between the ages of 16 and 29, the age group most likely to be incarcerated. Within-race income\ninequality is measured as the inter-quartile range of wage income among employed males age 16 and\nRacial population change is measured by the percentage of the total state population that is\nblack and the percentage change in the black population. Migration is captured by the proportion\nof the population that was born in a different census region than the state [13]. Urbanization is\noperationalized as the proportion living in metro areas. Closely connected to urbanization and\nmigration is the shift away from farm work, which is measured by the proportion of male workers in\nagricultural occupations, and the rise of manufacturing employment, captured by the proportion of\nmale workers in manufacturing industries.\nPolitical context is measured using an indicator of whether the current governor is a Republican and\nusing the proportion of votes going to the Republican candidate in the most recent presidential election.\nNormally residential segregation by race is measured at the level of the city or metropolitan\narea rather than the state. To construct state-level measures, we take the mean of the segregation\nmeasures for all of the cities or metropolitan areas in the state, weighted by the black population of each\ncity/metropolitan area. As our measure of segregation, we use the dissimilarity index. This measure,\na widely used segregation measure, can be understood as the proportion of the black population that\nwould have to move neighborhoods (either census tracts or city wards, depending on the year) in\norder to make all of the neighborhoods have the same proportion black as the proportion black in\nthe city/metropolitan area overall (see Cutler, Glaeser, and Vigdor [77] for more information on the\nsegregation data). Some states in some years have no cities or metropolitan areas with segregation\nmeasures, particularly in 1950. For such observations, we impute a segregation value using multiple\nimputation by chained equations (Royston's \"ice\" command in Stata) predicting the missing value\nusing segregation measures from other years as well as percentage urban, percentage black, and black\npopulation change for the current year and census region and division dummies. In the regression\nmodels, we also include a dummy variable for whether a segregation value was imputed.6\nWe use these variables to model the count of the number of inmates in each state-year-race\ncombination, again using a Poisson model. Because some state characteristics operate differently\nfor blacks and whites, we estimate models separately by race. The \"exposure\" is again the\npopulation size, and we weight both black and white regressions by the mean proportion of the\ntotal U.S. black population in the state between 1940 and 1980. This prevents up-weighting later\nyears (when populations are larger) and ensures that both black and white regressions weight\nstates equivalently. We include state fixed effects, which remove all race-specific time invariant\ndifferences in incarceration rates across states, focusing our analysis on within-state changes over\ntime. Finally, we mean center all variables by subtracting the black mean. Thus the constant and year\ndummies capture the mean log incarceration rates with state characteristics held at the mean values\nexperienced by the typical black resident. This allows for comparisons of the constant and dummies\nacross black and white regressions and across models with different independent variables.\n4. Results\n4.1.

Here the difference in incarceration\nrates is clearly evident, and we see the familiar increase over time in the racial difference in incarceration.\nThe increase appears to be relatively steady throughout the time period, with a somewhat slower\nincrease during the 1950s. The population-adjusted line increases less steeply than the unadjusted line,\nindicating that the growth in the black population relative to the white population explains some of\nthe increase in RDI. Calculations indicate that adjusting for population accounts for 32% of the original\n6 In developing this parsimonious set of state characteristics, we considered a large number of alternative measures.\nThese included age-specific unemployment rates, full- and part-time employment rates, percentage college graduates\nand percentage middle school graduates, median age and more specific population age categories, weekly rather than\nannual wages, the black/white population ratio, percentage born in another census division, percent of the population\nliving in cities of various population sizes, employment in the agricultural industry rather than agricultural occupations,\npercent of votes for the Republican gubernatorial candidate, dissimilarity index weighted by total city/metro population,\nand the isolation index.

These differences in sentencing could reflect a number of factors, including\ndiscrimination, racial differences in types of offense, or racial differences in individuals' accumulated\ncriminal records.\n4.2. Part II: Decomposing State-Level Variation in Incarceration Rates\nModel 1 in Table 2 shows the basic trend to be decomposed. It predicts inmates using only time\ndummies, the black dummy, and the black by time dummies, and can be thought of as a simple display\nof the mean of the log of the number of inmates for blacks and whites over time.9 The first column\ndisplays results representing the constant and the time trend with 1940 as the base year and is the\ntime trend for whites. The third column displays the results from the black dummy and black by\ntime interaction terms, the focus of our analysis. The trend in the racial difference in incarceration is\nclearly evident. As expected, the racial difference in the log of the number of individuals incarcerated\ncoefficients for blacks, calculating by summing the first and third columns.\nTable 2. Poisson regression models of inmates.\n1--Baseline Model 2--Residualized Time Trends\nWhites Blacks Blacks\u00adWhites Whites Blacks Blacks\u00adWhites\nNotes: Model 2 also includes State Dummies, State ^ Black Dummies, State ^ Time Dummies, and ln(pop)\nterm (with coefficient constrained to 1); Both models weighted by Pop.\n9 Because we have population rather than sample data and therefore there is no sampling error, we are not concerned with\nstandard errors in this analysis.\nModel 2 in Table 2 shows analogous estimates from the full model described above. Coefficients\nfor the individual state, state by time, and race by time dummies are omitted for space reasons.\nComparing the rightmost columns for each of the two models shows that accounting for population\nincrease and for migration has greatly reduced the time trend in the racial difference in incarceration,\nTable 3 shows the decomposition of white trends by decade and, in the rightmost column, for the\nentire period 1940 to 1980. For each time period, the total trend is decomposed into components\ncontributing to an increase in incarceration over time and those contributing to a decrease over time,\nwith components contributing to the decrease indicated by shaded cells. For each period, the raw\nvalues in the difference in ln(inmates) metric are to the left, and percentages of the total increase or\ndecrease are on the right. The three total rows near the bottom of the table show that during the 1940s\nand 1960s, components leading to a decrease in incarceration among whites were larger than those\nleading to an increase, resulting in an overall decrease during those two decades and a slight overall\ndecrease over the entire period, 1940\u00ad1980. The magnitudes of the overall increases in incarceration\nIncreasing population pushes white incarceration numbers higher in all decades, but had an\nover half of the 1940 to 1980 increase in white incarceration. As captured by the state dummies,\npopulation increases in states with higher incarceration rates, most likely due to migration rather\nthan differential birth rates, also consistently increase white incarceration over time, contributing to\nabout 13 percent of the overall increase from 1940 to 1980. Finally, as captured by the state by time\ndummies, population change in states with changing incarceration rates has differing impacts in each\ndecade. For example, an increase in the population of a state with increasing incarceration rates would,\nceteris paribus, lead to an increase in incarceration. Similarly, a decrease in the population of a state\nwith decreasing incarceration rates would also lead to an increase in incarceration. This component\nand 1970s. Throughout the entire period, the net impact of a decrease in the population in states with\ndecreasing incarceration rates is positive and accounts for about 32 percent of the overall increase in\nwhite incarceration. The time dummies capture the overall time trend for each period not accounted\nfor by the other components. Their relatively large magnitudes, especially in the individual decades,\nsuggest that adding other variables to the model is necessary to fully understand the time trend in\nwhite incarceration.\nTable 4 performs the same decomposition for black incarceration. The bottom section of the table\nshows a similar temporal story for black incarceration as for white incarceration, except that the net\nand 1970s are larger for blacks. This leads to an overall increase in black incarceration between 1940\nand 1980. Slightly over half of this increase occurred during the 1970s, with the remainder occurring\nAs among whites, national population increase plays an important role in the increase in\nincarceration among blacks in all time periods. In these data, for blacks, it accounts for a little over a\nthird of the overall increase between 1940 and 1980. As captured by the state dummies, population\nchange in states with different incarceration rates pushed black incarceration rates down between 1940\nand 1970 and pushed them up in the 1970s, presumably as blacks moved to lower-incarceration states\nin the first period and higher incarceration states in the second. However, the magnitudes of these\neffects are relatively small. As captured by the black by state dummies, black population growth in\nstates with higher black incarceration rates increased black incarceration in all decades but the 1970s,\nof the overall increase in black incarceration from 1940 to 1980. Finally, state by time dummies capture\nthe changes in black incarceration due to changes in population in states with changing incarceration\nrates. These changes pushed black incarceration upward throughout the period, as blacks moved to\nstates whose incarceration rates were increasing and away from states where they were decreasing.\nin black incarceration. Again, the relatively large contributions of the time dummies and black by\ntime dummies in many periods suggest that additional variables are necessary to understand black\nincarceration trends. Understanding why incarceration rates increased in states where blacks moved\nalso requires examining additional variables, as we do in Part III.\nTable 5 differences the components of the black and white trends in order to decompose the\ntime trend in the racial difference in incarceration. The bottom section of the table indicates that the\nracial difference in incarceration increased in all years, though not evenly. The 1950s account for\nalmost one-third of the change, and the 1970s account for over one-third. As indicated by the ln(Pop)\nrow, differential national population increase pushed up the racial difference in incarceration in all\ndecades except the 1940s and accounted for about one-fifth of the overall increase between 1940 and\n1980.10 Differential population change in states with higher overall incarceration rates lowers the\nracial difference in all years, though its effects are largest in the 1940s and 1950s and moderate in the\n1960s. Black population increase in states where black incarceration rates are disproportionately higher\nthan those of whites increases the differential in all periods except the 1970s, contributing to about\n22 percent of the overall increase in the racial differential between 1940 and 1980. In other words,\nthe white population increased faster in states with overall higher incarceration rates throughout the\nperiod, lowering the RDI, but black population increase in states with higher black incarceration rates\nthroughout the period increased the RDI. Finally, differential movement to states with increasing\nincarceration rates over time also contributes about one-fifth of the overall increase between 1940\nIn other words, the black population increases more in states whose incarceration rates were rising,\nincreasing the RDI.\n10 The accounting exercise in Part I finds that differential population change accounted for about one-third of RDI. We suspect\nthis difference is due to the differing coverage of the two analyses. The analysis in Part I uses national data, whereas this\nanalysis uses state-level data for 39 states. Because the black population in the excluded states is negligible, the main\ndifference is the excluded white population.\nTable 3.

Part III: Modeling Incarceration Rates Using State Characteristics\nThe two descriptive decomposition analyses above provide information on the proximate causes\nof changes in the RDI, but more detailed explanations of specific causes are needed to understand\nthe patterns revealed. For example, how can we understand the role of black population increases\nin states with rising black incarceration rates? In addition, the remaining importance of the black by\ntime dummies in the decomposition of the black-white incarceration differential, about one-third of\nthe total between 1940 and 1990, still needs to be explained. As such, social processes in addition to\nthe changing geographic location of whites and blacks by state should also be taken into account in\nunderstanding the trend.\nWe begin by examining how various state characteristics that are hypothesized above to affect\nincarceration rates changed over time between 1940 and 1980. State means by race and time, weighted\nby the proportion of the black population that resides in each state in each year, are provided in\nAppendix B, Table B1. Here we describe a number of trends in the state characteristics that are worthy\nof note. Some of these show improvement in the situation of blacks relative to that of whites and some\nof these show declines.\n, The gap in wage income at the 25th percentile of the wage distribution became wider until 1970\nand then began to close.11\n, The proportion of single mothers increased among both blacks and whites but increased more\namong blacks.\n, The racial gap in the unemployment rate held relatively steady through 1970 and then increased\n, Though education increased among blacks throughout the period, blacks lost ground relative to\n, The proportion of blacks and whites in the peak crime ages was fairly similar throughout the period.\n, Wage inequality increased among both blacks and whites, and blacks had consistently lower\nwithin group inequality throughout the period.\nWe also note the following shifts related to population growth, migration, and urbanization,\nwhich are consistent with prior research [13]:\n, The proportion of the state that was black where the typical black lived declined as the black\npopulation moved north and west.\n, The likelihood of living in a state where black population change was high increased.\n, The proportion of blacks born outside their current region of residence increased.\n, Both blacks and whites urbanized, though blacks slightly more so than whites.\n, Agricultural employment fell.\n, Manufacturing employment increased, at least through 1970.\n, Blacks and whites came to live in states that increasingly voted Republican and increasingly had\nRepublican governors.\n, Racial segregation increased slightly through 1970 and then declined somewhat during the 1970s.\nWe now turn to Poisson models similar to those above except that here we include only year\ndummies and add state characteristics. For each pair of regressions, we display the coefficients from\nthe black and white models and the differences between the models in the constant and the year\ndummy coefficients. The differences in the year dummies can be interpreted as the remaining time\n11 In interpreting these trends, it is important to keep in mind that states are weighted by their proportion of the total U.S.\nblack population in the state in each year. As such, both the black and white means of any characteristic represent the state\nmean experienced by the typical black person in a particular census year.\ntrend in the racial difference in the incarceration rate once the state characteristics included in the\nmodel are held constant at their black mean. The difference in the constant can be interpreted as\nthe remaining racial difference in incarceration in the omitted year, 1940. Results are presented in\nTable 6.12 Rather than show one preferred model, we build up a series of models that progressively add\nexplanatory variables. This procedure allows us to see how much more of the RDI can be explained\nby the added variables, providing information about their importance relative to other possible\nexplanatory variables. Figure 3 shows the implied trends in the racial difference in log incarceration\nrates based on the models in Table 6.\nThe regressions in column (1) of Table 6 contain only the exposure, the constant, and the time\ndummies, which display the now-familiar racial difference in incarceration in 1940 that grows over\ntime. The trend is displayed in Figure 3 with the thick solid line with the diamonds. Model (2) adds\nthree demographic and economic characteristics, percentage single mothers, wage income at the 25th\npercentile, and the percentage of the population aged 16\u00ad29. Holding constant these characteristics\nincreases the racial differential in 1940, as blacks were relatively disadvantaged compared to whites\non these dimensions in that year (recall that since the independent variables are black-mean centered\nin both the white and black models, the white constant now reflects the mean incarceration rate for\nwhites in 1940 were the mean characteristics of whites set to those of blacks). Entering these variables\nindividually into the model suggests that controlling for the single parenthood variable is responsible\nfor almost all of the increase in the 1940 racial gap in incarceration (models not shown). Holding\nconstant these characteristics also accounts for almost all the trend in racial difference in incarceration\nin the 1940s, all of the trend in the 1950s, and a small fraction of the trend thereafter. The remaining\ntrend in the racial difference in incarceration is displayed graphically in Figure 3 in the thick solid line\nwith the circles.\ndifference in incarceration in the omitted year, 1940. Results are presented in Table 6.12 Rather than\nshow one preferred model, we build up a series of models that progressively add explanatory\nvariables. This procedure allows us to see how much more of the RDI can be explained by the added\nvariables, providing information about their importance relative to other possible explanatory\nvariables. Figure 3 shows the implied trends in the racial difference in log incarceration rates based\non the models in Table 6.\nThe regressions in column (1) of Table 6 contain only the exposure, the constant, and the time\ndummies, which display the now-familiar racial difference in incarceration in 1940 that grows over\ntime. The trend is displayed in Figure 3 with the thick solid line with the diamonds. Model (2) adds\nthree demographic and economic characteristics, percentage single mothers, wage income at the\n25th percentile, and the percentage of the population aged 16\u00ad29. Holding constant these\ncharacteristics increases the racial differential in 1940, as blacks were relatively disadvantaged\ncompared to whites on these dimensions in that year (recall that since the independent variables are\nblack-mean centered in both the white and black models, the white constant now reflects the mean\nincarceration rate for whites in 1940 were the mean characteristics of whites set to those of blacks).\nEntering these variables individually into the model suggests that controlling for the single\nparenthood variable is responsible for almost all of the increase in the 1940 racial gap in\nincarceration (models not shown). Holding constant these characteristics also accounts for almost all\nthe trend in racial difference in incarceration in the 1940s, all of the trend in the 1950s, and a small\nfraction of the trend thereafter. The remaining trend in the racial difference in incarceration is\ndisplayed graphically in Figure 3 in the thick solid line with the circles.\nFigure 3.

Holding constant these characteristics explains some of the racial\ndifference in 1940, but more importantly also shifts the trend from an increasing racial difference over\ntime to a decreasing one, reflecting the fact that over time blacks' status relative to that of whites' fell\non these demographic and economic characteristics. This downward trend is displayed in Figure 3 in\nthe thin solid line with the squares. Judging from the large decreases in the AIC and BIC values from\nModel 1 to Model 2 to Model 3, the demographic and economic characteristics improved the fit of the\nmodels considerably.\nIn most cases the demographic and economic characteristic variables operate in the expected\ndirection. Higher unemployment and a greater share of the population in the crime-prone age range\nof 16\u00ad29 are associated with higher incarceration, while higher levels of education are associated with\nlower incarceration. Yet not all variables operate the same for blacks and whites, and not all operate in\nthe expected direction. This is due to controlling for the other variables and to the state fixed effects\ndummies. Among blacks, greater within-race wage inequality is associated with higher incarceration,\nbut among whites it is associated with lower incarceration. This pattern persists across all of the\nmodels, even when other variables are controlled (and is also evident in models that do not include\nany other state characteristics--models not shown). This pattern in consistent with Wilson's arguments\nabout the concentration of poverty among blacks that accompanied the growth of the black middle\nclass the associated rise in inequality among blacks.\nAmong blacks, higher wage income at the 25th percentile is associated with higher imprisonment,\nbut among whites it is associated with lower imprisonment. These income effects become more\nconsistent in direction and shrink as other variables are added in later models, suggesting that failing\nto account for other factors such as migration and urbanization may be driving the unexpected\nwage income results in Model 3. The percentage of single mothers shows a strong and consistently\nnegative association with both black and white incarceration rates. Bivariate analyses reveal that\nthis unexpected relationship is a product of the state fixed effects in the model (models not shown).\nIntuitively, this means that once all cross-state variation is removed, there is a negative relationship\nbetween single motherhood and incarceration within-states over time.\nModel 4 adds the Population Growth, Migration, and Urbanization variables to the model.\nThese variables considerably reduce the base level racial difference in incarceration reflected in the\nconstant as well as the trend between 1960 and 1980. This is also clear from Figure 3, which shows\nthe remaining trend from Model 4 with the dotted line with the triangles. The large decreases in the\nBIC and AIC statistics also indicate the importance of these variables for model fit. Moreover, all of\nthe individual variables show associations with incarceration in the expected directions. Percentage\nblack and black population growth both increase black incarceration but decrease white incarceration.\nMigration (percentage born in another region) and urbanization increase incarceration among both\nblacks and whites, while agricultural employment is associated with lower levels of incarceration\namong both blacks and whites. Manufacturing employment is associated with higher levels of\nincarceration among blacks but not whites. Glancing ahead to Models 5 and 6, we see that these results\nare robust to further controls for political context and segregation. Together, these results suggest that\nprocesses of black population growth, urbanization, and migration played important roles in the trend\nModel 5 adds the political context variables to the model. The constant and year coefficients\nin Table 6 and the trend line in Figure 3 (which shows the remaining trend from Model 5 in the\ndot-dash line with circles) both reveal that these variables further account for some of the baseline\noperate in the expected direction, with more Republican influence associated with greater incarceration,\nbut this effect is stronger among whites. Indeed, the AIC and BIC statistics actually increase from\nModel 4 to Model 5 for blacks, suggesting that the political variables are adding little explanatory\npower to the black model. The white models, however, show decreases in the AIC and BIC, as we\nwould expect based on the large coefficients on the political variables in Model 5. These results suggest\nthat the political factors identified in previous research as explaining black incarceration in more recent\nyears are less important in the period we study.\nModel 6 adds the segregation measure, which is positively associated with incarceration for both\nblacks and whites, although not surprisingly the association is considerably larger for blacks than\nwhites. Adding this measure to the model further explains the baseline difference in 1940 and further\nexplains the trends over time, particularly between 1950 and 1960, when migration of blacks from the\nSouth to the urban North greatly increased racial segregation. This is clear from the constant and year\ncoefficients in the model and from the resulting trend line in Figure 3, which shows the remaining\ntrend from Model 6 with the dashed line with asterisks. The BIC and AIC statistics for both the black\nand the white models also suggest that this variable has improved the fit of the model. Note however,\nthat there is still a large racial difference, particularly at baseline, that remains unexplained by the full\narray of variables in Model 6. We have not fully explained the baseline racial difference in incarceration.\nAdditional research is necessary to fully understand the racial differences in incarceration in the\nThe above discussion has focused on the coefficients in the models and the residual time trends.\nIt does not explicitly consider the trends in the mean characteristics of blacks and whites. An alternative\nway to interpret the models in Table 6 is to decompose the trends in racial differences into those that are\ndue to differences in the mean characteristics of blacks and whites and those that are due to differences\nin the coefficients between blacks and whites. This decomposition will allow us to examine the\nrelative importance of specific variables in driving the changes in the racial difference in incarceration\ntaking into account both the changes in the characteristics over time and the association between the\nvariables and incarceration by racial group. Juhn, Murphy, and Pierce [80] generalize the cross-sectional\nBlinder-Oaxaca decomposition to two periods (see also Makepeace et al. [81]). Because we estimate\nonly one model pooled across years for each group, we focus here on the trends attributable to changes\nin the black means and trends attributable to racial differences in changes in mean characteristics.13\nTable 7 shows the decomposition for the entire period from 1940 to 1980 using the race-specific\nmeans from those years (Appendix B provides cross-sectional Blinder-Oaxaca decompositions for\ndecomposition in Table 7, separately by decade). Table 7 shows the total raw contribution of each\nvariable and the percentage of the total raw racial trend for which it accounts. The bottom three rows\nof the table show the sum of the trends captured by the model, the trend that remains unexplained\n(identical to the B-W 1980 dummy in Model 6 of Table 6), and the resulting sum, which represents the\nraw trend in the racial difference once race-specific state fixed effects are removed. When interpreting\nthe results of the decompositions, it is important to remember that the results are dependent on the\nspecification of the regression models. For example, if one variable in the model is endogenous to\nanother, the decomposition will attribute the effects to the endogenous variable. This might occur, for\nexample, with the political variables. If election of a Republican governor is a response to an increasing\nblack population, some of the effect of increasing black population will be attributed to the Republican\ngovernor variable.\n13 Juhn et al. [80] develop a decomposition based on two groups each with separate regressions in each of two time periods.\nBecause we estimate one equation for each racial group that pools all time periods, coefficients are implicitly constrained to\nbe equal within groups across time periods. This means that changes in coefficients are removed from the decomposition,\nand we focus only on changes in the characteristics of blacks and differential changes by race in mean group characteristics.\nTable 7. Trends in racial difference in ln(incarceration rate) attributable to changes in mean characteristics.\nRaw Contribution Column Percentage\nNote: From decomposition based on Model 6 of Table 6. Positive values of raw contribution refer to increase in\nblack incarceration relative to white incarceration.\nNote first that we have more than explained the trend in the racial difference in incarceration\n(the unexplained trend is negative and the sum of the attributable trend is over 100%), which was also\nevident from Figure 3 (recall that the trend line switched from upward to downward). We see from\nTable 5 which variables explain the increase in the racial difference in incarceration and which explain\nany countervailing effects that contributed to decreases in the racial difference in incarceration.14\nMost of the contribution comes from demographic and economic characteristics and the migration and\nurbanization variables. Although segregation plays a major role in the 1940 and 1980 cross-sectional\ndecompositions (see Appendix B, Table B2), the small contribution of segregation to the trend in the\nracial difference in incarceration is due to its relatively small change over the period. Political context\nalso appears to play only a minor role in the trend, with its effects concentrated in the 1960s\n(see Appendix B Table B3 for decade specific results). The small contribution of the political context\nvariables is due to their relatively small coefficients. Overall, the changes in the demographic and\neconomic characteristics serve to increase the racial difference in incarceration over time, though this\neffect seems concentrated in the 1950s. It also masks multiple countervailing forces. The bulk of the\nincrease in incarceration is attributable to rising wage inequality among blacks relative to whites,\nparticularly in the 1950s and 1960s, and rising rates of single parenthood among blacks relative to\nwhites, particularly in the 1960s and 1970s. Growth in wages among blacks pushed racial differences\n14 Note that for variables that are not race specific (percentage black, black pop change, and the political and segregation\nvariables), the changes in white and black means between 1940 and 1980 will be identical, so by definition there is no trend\nattributable to racial differences in the changes in these means.\namong blacks, particularly in the 1970s.\nOverall, the migration and urbanization variables contributed to a decline in the racial difference\nin incarceration, but again this masks considerable variation by specific variables and across time.\nPercentage black, percentage in manufacturing, and percentage in agriculture drove the downward\ntrend, while percentage born in another region and, to a much lesser extent, black population\nchange and percentage urban, drove the upward trend. The contribution of percentage black is\nthroughout the period (recall that the models are weighted by mean proportion black in the state across\nyears, so this indicates a dispersal of the black population), and percentage black is positively associated\nwith black incarceration and negatively associated with white incarceration. Agricultural employment,\nwhich is negatively associated with incarceration for both blacks and whites, declined drastically\nthroughout the period in both groups, but because blacks started with a greater concentration in the\nagricultural sector, the change was larger for blacks. These effects are concentrated somewhat in the\nbut increased among blacks in the 1960s and 1970s while decreasing among whites in those decades.\nThese trends, coupled with a positive association with incarceration among blacks and a negative\nassociation with incarceration among whites meant that changes in manufacturing employment fueled\nPercentage born in another region increased the racial difference in incarceration in the 1950s and\n1960s, and to a small extent in the 1970s. During these periods, this measure of migration was much\nhigher for blacks than whites, a difference that was exaggerated by the larger positive association with\nincarceration among blacks than whites. Differential changes in urbanization decreased the racial\ndifference in incarceration in the 1950s but increased the racial difference during the 1960s, for a slight\nnet upward impact over the whole period.\n5. Conclusions\nThe racial difference in incarceration rose dramatically from 1940 to 2000, though the increase\nappears concentrated in the period between 1940 and 1980. Despite increases in the percentage\nof federal and state prisoners who were black between 1940 and 1970 that were as large or larger\nthan those after 1970, most research on the racial difference in incarceration has focused on the later\nperiod. The bulk of this research has focused on explanations involving discrimination, racial threat,\nthe war on drugs, and political factors. This paper extends the literature on the racial difference in\nincarceration by (1) examining an earlier and longer time span, the entire period between 1940 and\n1980, and by (2) focusing on additional explanatory factors, particularly the roles of population growth,\nmigration between states, and urbanization. We presented three different analyses that approach the\nracial difference in incarceration between 1940 and 1980 from three different angles. All three indicate\nthe importance of demographic processes.\nThe accounting model in Part I shows that increases in the black population, black arrest rates and\nblack sentencing rates relative to those of whites account for the bulk of the increase in the RDI between\n1940 and 1980. Differential population growth accounts for one third of the trend in RDI. The remaining\nincrease in RDI can be attributed mostly to differential changes in population arrest rates between\nracial differences in sentencing are more important leading up to the prison boom, while racial\ndifferences in arrests are more important prior to the prison boom. However, in any particular year,\ndifferences in black and white arrest rates account for the vast majority of the cross-sectional racial\ndifference in incarceration, net of population. We remind the reader that due to data limitations for\nthe historical period covered by our research, arrest rates reflect both the probability of committing a\nserious crime and the probability of being arrested for it, and \"sentencing\" captures being sentenced\nto prison for a crime, entry into prison for a parole or probation violation, and lengths of prison terms.\nFurther research is necessary to separate crime rates from arrests per crime and to separate front-end\nsentencing and sentence length from back-end sentencing due to parole and probation violations in\nthis period. We also remind the reader of the limitations of the UCR data used to measure arrest, which\nmay not fully capture all arrests. In particular, if arrests among blacks are overstated relative to arrests\namong whites, then the importance of arrests will be overstated in each period and the importance of\nsentencing will be understated. Conversely, if arrests among blacks are understated relative to arrests\namong whites, then the importance of arrests will be overstated and the importance of sentencing will\nbe understated.\nOur decomposition of state variation in black and white incarceration rates between 1940 and 1980\nin Part II highlights the importance of population change. A rate of population growth greater among\nblacks than whites in the states where the vast majority of blacks lived accounts for about one-fifth\nof the increase in the RDI between 1940 and 1980. This analysis also indicates the importance of\ndifferential population growth by race in states with different rates of incarceration. These differences\nin population growth by race, which we believe are mostly due to differential migration between states\nby race, increased the RDI because they increased the relative proportion of the black population in\nstates with higher incarceration rates for blacks and in states with increasing incarceration rates over\ntime. Differential population increase among blacks in states with higher black incarceration rates\naccounts for about one-fifth of the RDI, and differential population growth in states with increasing\nincarceration rates accounts for about one-quarter of RDI. The remaining one-third of the increase in\nRDI is unexplained by this decomposition.\nOur state characteristics model and decomposition in Part III reveal perhaps our most surprising\nfinding: had the demographic and economic characteristics of blacks been the same as those of\nwhites, the racial difference in incarceration would have been even greater during this period and\nthe trend in the racial difference between 1940 and 1980 would have been downward instead of\nupward. In other words, holding constant demographic and economic characteristics increased the\ncross-sectional racial difference in incarceration in each year. This was driven by differences in income\nlevels, single parenthood, and the proportion of the population in the prime age for criminal activity\n(ages 16\u00ad29), variables on which whites were significantly more advantaged compared to blacks\nthroughout the period. Larger increases in single parenthood among blacks played a particularly\nstrong role. Controlling for further demographic and economic characteristics also reverses the\nresidual trend in the racial difference in incarceration from upward to downward. This was driven by\nunemployment, education, and within-race wage inequality, all of which changed more for whites\nthan blacks during this period.\nOur state characteristics analyses also indicate the importance of migration, population growth,\nand urbanization in understanding racial differences in incarceration, as these variables are strongly\nassociated with within-state variation in incarceration rates for both blacks and whites and account\ndisproportionately moved from the South to the North and West and to cities relative to whites,\nand black employment in manufacturing increased while black employment in agriculture decreased\nrelative to whites. As a result, the black population spread throughout more of the country, and there\nwas considerable black population change throughout the period. The typical black individual in\n1980 lived in a state that was less black than the typical black individual in 1940. Overall, changes\nin percentage black, percentage in manufacturing, and percentage in agriculture drove the RDI\ndownward, while changes in percentage born in another region and, to a much lesser extent, black\npopulation change and percentage urban, drove the RDI upward. Segregation, although important for\nunderstanding point-in-time racial differences in incarceration, varies too little over time to explain\nmore than a trivial portion of the trend in the RDI.\nOur results indicate that political context plays only a minor role in explaining changes in the\nracial difference in incarceration between 1940 and 1980. Note that this result is entirely consistent\nwith the prior literature by Jacobs and others that focuses on the more recent period. That literature\nargues that the rise of a \"law and order\" politics laced with racial undertones in the post-Nixon\nperiod drove more punitive criminal justice policy led by Republicans. Because we find few effects of\nRepublican strength on the incarceration of blacks in earlier decades, our analysis is consistent with\nthe approximate timing of the political shift emphasized in prior research.\nOverall, our analyses suggest a very different set of explanations for changes in the racial\ndifferences in incarceration for the period between 1940 and 1980 than for the more recent period,\nfor which the literature has emphasized changes in political power and political processes that led\nto harsher treatment of blacks by the criminal justice system. The period after World War II was one\nof considerable social, economic, and demographic change for both blacks and whites, particularly\nwith regard to migration and urbanization. Our analysis shows how these changes are linked to\nvariation over time in the racial difference in incarceration. Our emphasis on population growth in our\nfirst two analyses highlights the importance of considering population counts in addition to rates of\nincarceration. Indeed, the common practice of measuring racial inequality in incarceration with the\nproportion of the inmate population that is black obscures the role of racial differences in population\ngrowth in the RDI.\nThe analyses in this paper describe the relative importance of different processes in understanding\nracial differences in incarceration during the post-war period. However, our analysis is largely\ndescriptive, and strong causal claims await more detailed analyses of specific causes and their effects.\nAs such our analysis serves as a guide for areas of further inquiry rather than a definitive account of\nthe social, economic, and political processes that have generated changes in incarceration. For example,\nthe importance of the growth of wage inequality in our third analysis suggests one area for additional\nresearch. Further unpacking such historical processes will require a consideration of processes driving\nboth criminal behavior and the responses of the criminal justice system to that behavior as well as\nconsidering more carefully than we are able to do here how various forces are linked to one another.\nFor instance, some of the economic and demographic changes we have emphasized (e.g., single\nmotherhood) may well in part be products of other changes (e.g., segregation and urbanization).\nSimilarly, our analysis is not well positioned to make strong distinctions between migration effects\nand the effects of any racial threat that the increased presence of blacks in Northern cities may have\nproduced. More detailed analyses of trends in specific decades should also consider additional factors\nthat influence the population at risk of incarceration or criminal activity such as rates of juvenile\ndetention, military enlistments and the draft, deaths from drug overdoses, the de-institutionalization\nof the mentally ill, and executions.\n"
