A notable exception is recent work by\nBollen, Noble, and Adair [5], which demonstrates a latent variable approach to modeling favor-\nable fetal growth conditions (FFGC). FFGC are not directly observable or measurable, which\nimplies that they are latent. It is this latent variable that is the force behind the fetal origins\nhypothesis. Given the potentially large impact of this improved measurement and modeling\napproach, the current study examines whether the FFGC latent variable model replicates and\ngeneralizes to a different country and time period.\nThe fetal origins hypothesis [1], suggests that favorable (or unfavorable) fetal growth condi-\ntions have life-long health consequences for outcomes such as adult blood pressure [6, 7] and\ndiabetes risk [8]. Favorable fetal growth conditions (FFGC) is an abstract variable that encom-\npasses all of the environmental, genetic, and epigenetic factors that program prenatal develop-\nment. It is FFGC that is hypothesized to affect adult health outcomes. However, little time has\nbeen devoted to testing whether FFGC exist. Until now, empirical analyses have tended to use\nbirth weight as a proxy for fetal conditions, assuming rather than testing the plausibility of a\nFFGC latent variable. The use of a single observed measure as a proxy variable is problematic,\nas this approach assumes that birth weight is a perfectly reliable indicator of fetal conditions,\nthus ignoring any possible measurement error. In their original analyses, Bollen et al. [5]\nimprove upon this technique by explicitly testing whether FFGC can be modeled as a latent\nvariable, an approach that appropriately accounts for measurement error in each observed\nindicator. A key result from their analyses is that a model with a FFGC latent variable mediat-\ning the effects of maternal characteristics on birth outcomes (Fig 1b and S1 Table) fits better\nthan a model without it (Fig 1a). Full details on the model specification and variables are in the\noriginal publication, but an important characteristic of the model is that birth weight, birth\nlength, and gestational age are indicators of latent FFGC and that most maternal characteristics\naffect these by influencing FFGC. These results are an important first step in providing evi-\ndence for the existence of FFGC.\nHowever, there are reasons to be cautious when interpreting these findings on their own.\nBollen et al.'s [5] sample was drawn from a metropolitan region of the Philippines (Cebu). In\nthe interest of applying this model to future studies on the fetal origins hypothesis, it is next\nimportant to test whether birth weight, birth length, and gestational age function similarly as\nindicators of FFGC in different populations. The current study tests whether there is evidence\nof a FFGC latent variable in a sample of mother-infant dyads drawn from two different states,\nNorth Carolina and Pennsylvania. While many variables are the same across the Cebu and the\nUS samples, important differences include the industrialization status (developing versus\ndeveloped), culture (Asian versus Western), the source of maternal and infant data (prospec-\ntive measurement versus retrospective report; Table 1), and the decade in which the births\noccurred (1980s versus 2000s). Due to these differences in population, time period, and vari-\nables, the results reported here represent a rigorous test of the FFGC model, as we are assessing\nthe degree to which Bollen et al.'s [5] results both replicate and generalize while adding infor-\nmation on the treatment of FFGC as a latent variable in these different contexts.\nA key question is how we will know whether we have replicated or not. Our approach\nreflects the idea that there are degrees of replicability. In the context of FFGC, a fundamental\naspect of replicating is to test whether a model using FFGC as a latent variable fits as well or\nbetter than one without it, as it did for the Cebu data. A second level of replication is whether\nthe signs and significance of the primary coefficients are the same across these different sam-\nples. Finally, the highest level of replication tests whether the most important coefficients are of\nthe same magnitude across studies. To the degree that we find evidence of replicability and gen-\neralization, we will accumulate evidence that either supports or opposes the plausibility of a\nFavorable Fetal Growth Conditions Replication\nfunding from the National Institute on Drug Abuse\n(https://www.nichd.nih.gov).

Specifically, three\ncounties in eastern North Carolina (NC) and three counties in central Pennsylvania (PA) were\nchosen as representing the Black South and Appalachia, respectively. While full recruitment\nand enrollment details have been documented elsewhere [10], trained research assistants had\ncontact with all women who gave birth in the selected counties between September 2003 and\nTable 1.

Similarly, maternal\nweight is reported here in pounds and kilograms, although maternal weight in pounds was used in all analyses.\nFavorable Fetal Growth Conditions Replication\nSeptember 2004 (N = 5471). Families were excluded if they did not live in the selected counties,\nspoke a primary language other than English in the home, or intended to move out of the area\nin the next three years. These criteria may have resulted in the exclusion of some high-risk fam-\nilies. Of those families eligible to participate, 68% consented, and of these, 58% were invited to\nparticipate.\nComplex sampling methods utilizing population weight and stratification variables yielded\na representative sample of 1,292 families. The current analyses include 1,199 infants in NC\n(N = 705) and PA (N = 494) where the biological mother was the primary caregiver at 2\nmonths of age. An additional 15 cases in NC and 8 cases in PA were excluded after being iden-\ntified as multivariate outliers, using a Mahalanobis distance measure. Another 1 case was\nexcluded in NC because the mother's reported height was more than 5 standard deviations\nbelow the mean.\nAll data on maternal traits and infant birth measures were collected via maternal report at a\nhome visit when infants were 2 months of age. The Institutional Review Board at the University\nof North Carolina at Chapel Hill approved all data collection activities. Written consent was\nobtained from primary caregivers at the beginning of the home visit. Data from the Family Life\nProject may be accessed via the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research\nMother's Traits\nTrained research assistants conducted structured interviews with mothers at the two month\nhome visit. Mothers reported on their height in feet and inches (MOMHT) as well as their pre-\npregnancy weight in pounds (MOMWT). MOMHT was converted to centimeters. Mothers'\nheight and pre-pregnancy weight were chosen as our indices of maternal nutritional stores, as\nthey were the closest comparable variables to the measures of maternal arm muscle (AMA)\nand arm fat (AFA) in the Cebu data (S1 Table). Pre-pregnancy weight was chosen, as opposed\nto pregnancy weight, because the latter measure is potentially confounded with infant birth\nweight.\nMothers also reported the frequency and number of cigarettes they smoked during each tri-\nmester of pregnancy. Smoker status was dichotomized into smokers and non-smokers (SMOK-\nERS), consistent with Bollen et al. [5]. Based on mothers' self-reported age in years, we created\ngroups of women < 20 years of age (YOUNGER) or > 35 years of age (OLDER). For these\ndichotomous variables, the referent category was women aged 20\u00ad35 years of age. Finally, par-\nity was dichotomized as first pregnancy or not (FIRSTPRG). These four dichotomous variables\n(SMOKERS, YOUNGER, OLDER, FIRST) were identical in the Cebu and NC/PA samples.\nFinally, mothers self-reported their primary race as either White or African-American. We\ndichotomized this variable to represent whether women were African-American (AA) or not,\nwhere White women served as the reference group.\nBirth Measures\nAt the two month home visit, mothers were asked to recall their infant's birth weight (BW) in\npounds and ounces, as well as birth length (BL) in inches. Weight was converted into grams\nand length was converted into centimeters. To aid model convergence, birth weight was\ndivided by 100 in all analyses. Mothers were also asked to recall their infant's due date and\nbirth date. Using these two dates, we calculated infant gestational age (GA) in weeks. All three\nbirth outcomes were retained as continuous variables. To reduce skewness and kurtosis, and to\nremain consistent with the measure of GA in Bollen et al. [5], we used the natural log of GA in\nFavorable Fetal Growth Conditions Replication\nour analyses. Infant sex was dichotomized (GIRL), with male infants serving as the reference\ngroup.\nUnlike in the Cebu data, we had only one measure each for BW, BL, and GA in NC/PA.\nTherefore, whereas in Cebu we could treat BW, BL, and GA as latent variables with multiple\nindicators (Fig 1), in the following models, they will be manifest, or directly observed, variables\n(Fig 2). Table 1 provides a comparison of descriptive statistics for all maternal and child char-\nacteristics included in analyses in the NC/PA and the Cebu samples.\nModels\nA central goal of the current investigation is to test whether BW, BL, and GA are indicators of a\ncommon latent variable we call FFGC, as concluded in Bollen et al. [5] or whether they are\nthree distinct outcomes with distinct predictors. If we conclude that a model with a latent\nFFGC variable fits the data better than a direct-effects only model, then we will move to stricter\ntests of replication, which includes comparison of signs and significance patterns of coefficients\nin Cebu and NC/PA, as well as an examination of the magnitude of the factor loadings across\nsamples. Because of the strikingly different contexts of the two samples, we will also explore\ntheoretical and empirical modifications that result in improved model fit, using the NC sample.\nFinally, we will replicate any modifications using the PA sample, to test whether these addi-\ntional paths are robust to changes in sample characteristics.\nModel 1: Direct Effects Model. Our first model allows each predictor variable to have a\ndirect effect on BW, BL, and GA (Fig 2a). Unlike in the Cebu sample, the NC/PA sample has\nonly one indicator of each birth outcome; thus they are treated as manifest, rather than latent\nvariables, and are indicated by rectangles as opposed to ovals. All other observed variables\nand are allowed to correlate with one another, as indicated by the long bar with the short\narrows connecting them. In addition, the set of exogenous observed variables directly influence\nBW, BL, and GA, as indicated by single-headed arrows. The errors of BW, BL, and GA are also\nallowed to correlate, to indicate that there is a residual association among them when the\nimpact of maternal variables and GIRL are accounted for.\nModel 2: FFGC Latent Variable Model. Our second model contains a latent variable\n(FFGC) that mediates the effect of maternal characteristics on the three birth outcomes (Fig\n2b). The existence of the latent variable in this model implies that there is an unobserved vari-\nable comprised of the genetic, environmental, and epigenetic conditions that program fetal\ngrowth, and which gives rise to our observed measures of BW, BL, and GA. The single-headed\narrows from FFGC to BW, BL, and GA indicate that if FFGC increases, we would expect all\nthree birth outcomes to increase; if FFGC decreases, then all birth outcomes would decrease.\nTo assign a scale to the latent variable, the path from FFGC to BW is set to 1. Like in Bollen\net al. [5], GIRL does not have an effect on FFGC; rather, it directly exerts its influence on BW,\nBL, and GA. Additionally, MOMHT has an effect on FFGC as well as a direct effect on BL,\ngiven the likely direct genetic relationship between a woman's height and the length of her\nbaby at birth.\nThis model, which is more parsimonious than Model 1, does not allow for correlated errors\namong BW, BL, and GA; this specification hypothesizes that the association between them is\nexplained by their common dependence on the FFGC latent variable and that there is no resid-\nual relationship among the three birth outcomes after we account for FFGC. Like in Model 1,\nall exogenous variables are allowed to correlate, with the exception of GIRL.\nModel 3: Modified FFGC Latent Variable Model. Using the NC data, we explored theo-\nretical and empirical modifications to Model 2. Theoretical modifications were made based on\nFavorable Fetal Growth Conditions Replication\nthe different contexts of births in the US, as opposed to in Cebu. The main theoretically modifi-\ncation explored was the addition of maternal race; while the NC/PA sample included both\nEuropean American and African American women, the Cebu sample did not. As African\nAmerican race is associated with higher rates of low birthweight and preterm births in the US\n[12], we tested whether including African American race (AA) as an additional predictor of\nFig 2. Structural Equation Models from NC/PA Analyses. Structural equation model depicting (a) direct-effects only model (Model 1) and (b) favorable\nfetal growth conditions (FFGC) latent variable model (Model 2) for NC/PA. BW = birth weight; BL = birth length, GA = gestational age; GIRL = newborn is a\ngirl; MOMWT = mother's pre-pregnancy weight; MOHT = mother's height; SMOKERS = mother smoked during pregnancy; FIRSTPRG = newborn was\nfirstborn; YOUNGER = mother was <20 years old when pregnant; older = mother was >35 years old when pregnant.\nFavorable Fetal Growth Conditions Replication\nbirth outcomes improved model fit. AA was allowed to directly influence BW, BL, and GA,\ninstead of having indirect effects via FFGC, because of a lack of theory suggesting why women\nof AA race would have poorer fetal growth conditions overall.\nEmpirical modifications were also explored, using modification indices (MI) provided by\nstatistical software (Mplus) [13]. While all MI with values above 10 were requested, we only\nconsidered modifications that were theoretically justifiable. Although MI are a useful tool\nfor detecting omitted paths, they are also data driven, and must be used with caution [14,\n15]. Therefore, any empirical modifications were evaluated carefully to ensure that they\nwere substantively plausible. The only plausible path suggested by this method was the\naddition of a direct path from FIRST to GA (Fig 3), which is consistent with the finding\nthat primiparous women in the U.S. are more likely to carry their infants past their due date\nAs an additional test of the robustness of the added paths in the model for NC, we re-ran\nModel 3 using the PA sample. Because the data from PA are independent from the NC data,\nthis strategy allows us to assess the generalizability of the NC modifications. If the modified\nmodel shows similar fit in the PA sample, we next plan to compare the estimates from NC and\nPA using a multiple group analysis to quantify the extent of agreement between the two sam-\nples. Finally, we will interpret the coefficients from the best fitting model, first comparing the\npatterns of signs and significance of model parameters, and finally testing the statistical equiva-\nlence of key model parameters across NC/PA and Cebu.\nResults\nAll models were estimated in Mplus [13] using full-information, robust maximum likelihood\n(MLR) as our estimator. MLR was chosen because it is distributionally robust, allowing for pos-\nsible non-normality in the errors of the model. The scaled chi-square test statistic that results\nfrom MLR cannot be used for chi-square difference testing in the normal manner. Therefore,\nan adjusted calculation was used when comparing nested models in future analyses [17]. Our\nFig 3. Modified Structural Equation Model from NC/PA Analyses.

In addition, we have a relatively small proportion of data\nmissing (Table 1).\nDescriptive statistics for Cebu, NC, and PA are presented in Table 1. Babies in the NC and\nPA samples tended to have higher BW than those in Cebu, but mean values of BL and GA were\nwithin sampling fluctuation of one another across the samples. Turning towards mother's\ncharacteristics, mothers in the US tended to be taller, and were more likely to smoke, compared\nto their counterparts in Cebu. Finally, mothers in NC were much more likely to be African\nAmerican compared to mothers in PA (48% versus 3%). It was not possible to compare mean\nlevels of maternal nutritional stores across the two samples, since different variables were used\nin Cebu and NC/PA (AMA, AFA, MOMWT).\nOur first model comparison addressed whether a model with a mediating FFGC latent vari-\nable fit the data better than a model with mother's characteristics directly influencing birth out-\ncomes. Fig 1a and 1b present Model 1 and Model 2 in Cebu, while Fig 2a and 2b present Model\n1 and Model 2 in NC/PA. For this first comparison, we attempted to keep our model as similar\nto the Cebu analyses as possible. Table 2 contains comparisons of overall model fit statistics for\nCebu, NC, and PA. Like in Bollen et al. [5], we report the MLR chi-square test statistic with its\ncorresponding degrees of freedom (df) and p-value, as well as the IFI, [1-RMSEA], and BIC. A\nnon-significant chi-square, a value of IFI and [1-RMSEA] close to 1, and a large, negative BIC\nvalue all indicate good model fit.\nTurning to the overall fit statistics for Model 1 and Model 2, several points are apparent. As\nopposed to the Cebu sample, which had multiple indicators of BW and GA, NC/PA had only\none indicator each for BW, BL, and GA. As a result, Model 1 is fully saturated in both NC and\nPA, which means that all available degrees of freedom are used up. All other fit statistics are\ninapplicable as well, since they are derived from calculations that are based on degrees of free-\ndom. Because a saturated model imposes no restrictions on the data, the model-estimated\nparameters will perfectly reproduce the covariance matrix of the data. However, this seemingly\nperfect fit to the data is true for any saturated model and tells us nothing about the overall fit.\nIn contrast to Model 1, Model 2 is overidentified, with 11 degrees of freedom with which to\njudge the fit of the model. In both the NC and PA samples, we obtain statistically significant\nTable 2. Global Fit Measures for Structural Equation Models from NC/PA Analyses.\nTest Statistic df p-value IFI (1-RMSEA) BIC\nThe notation NC/PA is used to denote model results from the multiple group analysis.\nFavorable Fetal Growth Conditions Replication\nchi-square test statistics, which is typical in moderate to large sample sizes (N = 689 and\nN = 486 in NC and PA, respectively). Both our IFI and our [1-RMSEA] values are below their\nideal fit of 1. However, both models have negative BIC values. According to the Jeffreys-Raftery\nguidelines [18], a BIC value that is negative and larger in magnitude than 10 suggests strong\nevidence in support of the model, compared to a saturated model. Using this guideline, Model\n2 provides good fit to the data in both the NC and PA samples, which have BICs of -13 and\nGiven the mixed evidence provided by the overall fit statistics, we next consider modifica-\ntions to Model 2. As discussed previously, the first modification we considered was the addition\nof a direct path from AA to BW, BL, and GA, consistent with the notion that AA women are at\nhigher risk of low birthweight and premature births. Next, an examination of the empirical\nmodifications suggested that we allow a direct path from FIRST to GA. Model 3 was estimated\nwith these two modifications, first in NC, and then in PA, as a check of robustness (Fig 3).\nFit statistics for Model 3 are presented in Table 2. The addition of these paths improved\nmodel fit in NC. Although the chi-square test statistic is still significant, both the IFI and\n[1-RMSEA] are closer to their ideal fit of 1. Additionally, the BIC for Model 3 is even more neg-\n-.001), as well as the path from FIRST to GA ( = .015) are also all significant at p < .05, indi-\ncating that the modifications were empirically justified.\nIn order to verify that the additions made to Model 3 were robust, we replicated our findings\nusing the PA sample. Since the PA sample was not used to estimate the empirical modifica-\ntions, it served as an independent check of the effect of the added paths. As seen in Table 2,\nModel 3 also fit the PA data better than Model 2. However, in PA, only the added paths from\nAA to BW ( = -1.726) and FIRST to GA ( = .006) were significant at p < .05. It is worth not-\ning that the proportion of AA women in PA was small (3%) as compared to in NC, where AA\nwomen made up almost half the sample (46%). The small proportion of AA women in PA\nlikely contributed to larger standard errors, leading to the different patterns of significance\nbetween NC and PA.\nFinally, we conducted a multiple group analysis to simultaneously fit Model 3 to the NC\nand PA samples. By testing a series of increasingly restrictive models, we are able to assess the\nequality of the parameters across groups, which give us a further test of the robustness of\nModel 3. If the relationship between our variables is truly the same in both samples, then set-\nting our factor loadings, intercepts, and coefficients to be equal should not result in a significant\ndecrement in model fit. Table 3 shows the chi-square change resulting from imposing increas-\ning equality constraints on the NC and PA models. Setting the factor loadings and intercepts of\nBL and GA to be equal, as well as the paths from each maternal characteristic to FFGC, does\nnot result in a significant decrement in model fit. However, forcing the direct effects of AA,\nTable 3. Chi-Squared Difference Testing of Multiple Groups Models.\nBecause MLR was selected as the model estimator, chi-square difference testing could not be done in the\nusual manner. For more information on chi-square difference testing for MLR, see Satorra and Bentler [17].\nFavorable Fetal Growth Conditions Replication\nFIRST, and GIRL on BW, BL, and GA to be equal does significantly worsen model fit. Given\nthe differential patterns of significance for the effects of AA on each birth outcome in NC and\nPA, it is not surprising that imposing this equality constraint significantly worsens model fit.\nHowever, the equality of factor loadings, intercepts, and coefficients on FFGC between the\ngroups provides evidence that Model 3 fits both samples adequately well.\nComplete fit statistics for the multiple group models are presented in Table 2. Although our\nchi-square test statistic is significant, all other fit statistics (IFI, [1-RMSEA], BIC) indicate good\nmodel fit. Moving to interpreting the coefficients of the model, we first examined the patterns\nof signs and significance for our parameters (see Table 4). In our model, like in Cebu, indices of\nmaternal nutritional stores (AMA, AFA, and MOHT in Cebu; MOWT and MOHT in NC/PA)\npositively predicted FFGC, while SMOKERS negatively predicted FFGC. However, our mea-\nsures of parity (FIRSTPRG) and maternal age (YOUNGER, OLDER) did not significantly pre-\ndict FFGC, as they did in Cebu. Together, our set of covariates explained 8% of the variance in\nFFGC in NC and 11% of the variance in PA, compared to 11% of the variance in Cebu.\nAs our final, strictest check of replication, we tested whether the factor loadings of BL and\nGA from these analyses (Table 5) were statistically equivalent to those obtained in the Cebu\nanalyses. Because the NC/PA and Cebu samples are independent, it was appropriate to use a z-\ntest to calculate the difference in coefficients between the two models, as well as the significance\nof the obtained z statistic [19]. For GA, the estimated factor loading of .005 was not signifi-\ncantly different than the Cebu factor loading of .004 (z = .196, p > .05). For BL, the estimated\nTable 4.

Although the coefficients are set to be\nequal across NC and PA, the multiple group analysis results in separate R2 values for each group. AMA\nwas not measured in NC/PA. AFA was measured in cm2 in Cebu, but only MOMWT in pounds was\nmeasured in NC/PA.\nFavorable Fetal Growth Conditions Replication\n< .05). Put into context, this finding means that for a 1 unit difference in FFGC we would\nexpect a .50 cm difference in birth length in the NC/PA sample and a .35 cm difference in the\nCebu sample. Whether this difference is substantively important remains to be determined, but\nit is a difference which if replicated in future studies would demand further investigation.\nSensitivity Analyses\nLike in Bollen et al. [5], we tested alternative model specifications to assess whether they had a\nsuperior fit. We first tested a model that included GA, rather than FFGC, as a mediator\nbetween mother's characteristics and BW and BL. This model fit the data poorly. We also\nattempted to model a latent GA variable by setting the reliability of its one indicator (measured\nGA) to various values (e.g. 0.1, 0.3, 0.5). However, a model with latent GA as a mediator would\nnot converge. Finally, we attempted to estimate a model that included both a FFGC latent vari-\nable and a direct path from GA to BW and BL; this model similarly would not converge. There-\nfore, we concluded that a model with FFGC as a latent variable was the most parsimonious and\nplausible alternative to the direct effects only model.\nBecause of the stratified sampling design of the Family Life Project, stratification and weight\nvalues were assigned to each case in the NC/PA data. While our models were originally esti-\nmated without these variables, we re-estimated Model 3 in both NC and PA accounting for\nstratification and weight, and found our substantive conclusions unchanged. We also re-ran\nour final analyses including all cases that were previously excluded as outliers. Although model\nfit decreased with the inclusion of these unusual cases, all substantive conclusions remained\nthe same.\nDiscussion\nThe goal of the current investigation was to test whether Bollen et al.'s [5] FFGC model, a\nnovel approach to studying the fetal origins hypothesis, replicated and generalized to a new\nsample of infants born in the United States. In doing so, we demonstrated a graded approach\nto reproducibility, by describing and then proceeding through a series of increasingly strict\ntests of replication. Based on this series of tests, we conclude that the results first gleaned from\nTable 5. Factor Loadings for FFGC Indicators.\nCebu NC/PA\n[N/A] [N/A]\nFor NC/PA, the factor loadings, along with their 95% confidence intervals (in brackets), are taken from the multiple group analysis. Although the factor\nloadings are set to be equal across NC and PA, the multiple group analysis results in separate R2 values for each group.\n*Model resulted in small negative error variance estimate which was set to zero.\nFavorable Fetal Growth Conditions Replication\na sample of Filipino infants do generalize to a sample of predominantly low-income American\ninfants. Several theoretically-justifiable modifications were made in our analyses in order to\nimprove model fit, but these modifications were small in number and did not lead to dramatic\nchanges in other model parameters (e.g. factor loadings). Importantly, the final model, includ-\ning all modifications, fit the data equally well in the two states that we tested (North Carolina\nand Pennsylvania), which suggests that these findings may be robust to variations in sampling\ncharacteristics.\nOur substantive conclusion on the generalizability of the FFGC approach is promising for\nfuture research on the fetal origins hypothesis, as a latent FFGC variable provides a metric with\nwhich to quantify the various environmental, genetic, and epigenetic influences on prenatal\ndevelopment that may program later human health. As opposed to the heretofore popular\nmethod of using birth weight as a proxy for prenatal conditions, the FFGC approach is unbur-\ndened by measurement error and allows researchers to take advantage of three commonly\navailable birth outcomes. Importantly, the current replication demonstrates the feasibility of\nmodeling FFGC when only one measure each of BW, BL, and GA are available, as well as when\nthese birth outcomes are reported by mothers retrospectively during the early postpartum\nperiod. Although there may be concerns about the accuracy of maternal report of these vari-\nables, previous work has shown no significant differences between hospital records and mater-\nnal report of BW and BL [20]. In addition, treating these variables as indicators of FFGC\npermits random measurement error to enter the error term for each indicator. The versatility\nof the FFGC latent modeling approach is promising, as it suggests that modeling FFGC may be\nappropriate under a wide range of methodological scenarios.\nThe current study also contributes to the methodological literature by proposing and\nmodeling a series of increasingly rigorous tests of replication. Our first step was to examine\nwhether our substantive conclusions were consistent with those of Bollen et al. [5], which\nfound that a model with a latent FFGC variable fit the data better than a model without it. By\ncomparing fit statistics from Model 1 and Model 2, we confirmed that Model 2 provided a bet-\nter fit to our data, and thus there was evidence for a FFGC latent variable. Next, we examined\nthe signs and significance of crucial coefficients in our model. Because a central goal was to test\nwhether the relationship between FFGC and its indicators functioned similarly across the two\nsamples, we focused on comparing the factor loadings for BW, BL, and GA. Although the coef-\nficient on BW was set to 1 to scale the latent variable, we found that the freely estimated factor\nloadings for BL and GA were both positive, significant, and similar in magnitude to the results\nfrom Cebu. Our final, strictest test of replication was to test the equality of the factor loadings\non BL and GA across the two samples. We found that we could not reject the null hypothesis\nthat the factor loadings for GA were equal in NC/PA and Cebu, while this was not true for\nthose for BL. This high, but not perfect level of agreement between the two studies indicates a\nrelatively strong replication success. In light of our success, we encourage researchers to con-\ntinue to test the generalizability of the FFGC model. If the FFGC model works similarly well in\ndiverse samples, we will accumulate evidence for the existence of a FFGC latent variable, as\nwell as for the fetal origins hypothesis.\nAs a rule, science is concerned with conducting robust and reliable research. While recent\nyears have seen a growing recognition of the importance of replication studies as well as a more\nreceptive environment to encouraging their publication [21, 22, 23], the quantity and quality of\npublished replication attempts remain low [24]. Contributing to this quandary is a lack of\naccepted guidelines on what constitutes a successful replication. We are hopeful that future\nresearch will adopt a graded approach to replication, as modeled in the current analyses. This\nattention to robustness is especially important for research on the fetal origins hypothesis,\ngiven its possible lifelong implications for human health and development.\nFavorable Fetal Growth Conditions Replication\nIn sum, the current study confirms the existence of a latent variable representing favorable\nfetal growth conditions which underlies the relationship between maternal characteristics and\nchild birth outcomes. However, the current study does not address whether this latent variable\npredicts adult health outcomes, as would be predicted by the fetal origins hypothesis. Future\nresearch should aim not only to confirm the existence of the FFGC latent variable among\ndiverse populations, but also to test the relationship between FFGC and adult risk of metabolic\nor cardiovascular disease.\nSupporting Information\nS1 Table.
