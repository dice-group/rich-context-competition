Whereas most research on social networking focuses on main-\nstream, corporate SNSs such as Twitter and Facebook, this essay is a contribution to\nscholarship on alternatives to such mainstream sites (e.g. Lovink and Rasch, 2013). My\nCorresponding author:\nRobert W Gehl, Department of Communication, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, USA.\nEmail: robert.gehl@utah.edu\nArticle\ncentral claim is that any viable social networking alternative will be an experiment with\nboth freedom and power. In other words, just as mainstream SNSs are marked by both\npower (in the form of surveillance, algorithmic regulation of user activities, and architec-\ntural constraints) and freedom (in the form of user-led production, political organization,\nand new forms of online sociality), so too will any alternative. To be an alternative, the\nspecific mix of power/freedom in any social media alternative must be different from\nmainstream SNSs. This specificity needs to be analyzed empirically and then conceptu-\nalized. I argue that the DWSN is an experiment in power/freedom, an attempt to trace,\ndeploy, and overcome the historical conditions in which it finds itself. These conditions\ninclude the generic constraints and affordances of social networking. Moreover, since the\nDWSN exists on the dark web, these conditions also include the ideological constraints\nand affordances of public perceptions of the dark web. The DWSN negotiates both of\nthese historical threads.\nThis article is organized as follows. First, I offer a brief note on doing ethnography on\nthe dark web, looking to a previous study for methodological guidance. I then explore the\ndominant media ideologies of the \"dark web\" in order to do two things: (1) lay out part\nof the historical and popular context the DWSN finds itself in and (2) find categorical\nlenses with which to look at the DWSN. Most journalistic work on the dark web presents\nit as composed of illicit activities in need of policing. Yet, this dominant conception is\ncomplicated by a secondary conception of the dark web as a site of radical freedom of\nspeech. I will next use this double-bind to tease out how the DWSN functions within a\ntension between freedom and power. Finally, I theorize the specific mix of power/free-\ndom found on the DWSN, arguing that the DWSN is engaged in experiments with ano-\nnymity and infrastructure. Ultimately, I hope to answer several questions: how does\nsocial networking on the dark web work? What does this tell us about contemporary\nSNSs, anonymity, and privacy? In what new ways do power and freedom intersect in an\nSNS that exists solely on the dark web?\nDark web ethnographic method\nBecause this is an ethnography of a dark web SNS, there were several methodological\nchallenges. The dark web is different from the \"clear web\" in important ways. The\ndark web is part of the Internet that cannot be accessed by mainstream software.1 It\nincludes hidden sites that end in \".onion\" or \".i2p\" or other Top-Level Domain names\nonly available through modified browsers or special software. Accessing I2P sites\nrequires a special routing program. Accessing non-mainstream Top-Level Domains\nthrough OpenNIC requires the user to change the DNS server addresses on his or her\nrouter. Accessing .onion sites requires Tor (for a tutorial on Tor and .onions, see\nMoreover, those who run dark websites that end in .onion are able to hide their identi-\nties and locations from most, if not all, Internet users (Dingledine et al., 2004). In most\ncases, a visitor to a .onion site will not know the identity of the host, nor will the host\nknow the identity of the visitor. This is very different from the mainstream Internet,\nwhere sites are often associated with a company or location (e.g. google.com is associ-\nated with the company headquartered in Mountain View, CA), and visitors are often\nidentified and monitored through sundry tracking technologies such as cookies, account\nregistrations, Flash cookies, IP addresses, and geolocation.\nAlthough these technical conditions are challenging for ethnography, they are not\nunique in the ethnographic literature. In doing a participant observation of the DWSN, I\nfollowed the example of anthropologist Tom Boellstorff's (2008) ethnography of Second\nLife. Boellstorff takes Second Life on its own terms; he avoids linking Second Life ava-\ntars to their \"real-world\" counterparts in order to focus on day-to-day life in that virtual\nworld. He treats Second Life as its own space, with its own rules and culture, rather than\nas articulated with the \"real world\" outside of the virtual. This is a methodological choice\nof Boellstorff's (Winnick, 2008), as opposed to the work of, for example, danah boyd (in\npress), who studies social media users both online and offline.\nFor me, however, I have no choice but to study the DWSN on its own terms. I cannot\nlink DWSN avatars to their flesh-and-blood counterparts even if I wanted to. This is for\nthe technical reasons I mention above, but also due to the culture of the DWSN.According\nto the DWSN privacy policy, \"In order to protect everyone's privacy, you have to protect\nyourself. You can do this by not giving out any personal information. No personal emails.\nNo real names. No specific location information.\" Due to this, I did not seek to learn any\npersonal information from DWSN members (including name, age, gender, location).\nMoreover, due to an agreement I made with the members of the DWSN that I spoke to,\nall user pseudonyms have been made into new pseudonyms (i.e. \"an admin\" and \"a\nmember\"). I did receive an exemption for this study from my university's Institutional\nReview Board (IRB). Most of this material is taken from public parts of the DWSN\n(\"public\" insofar as they are accessible with Tor and a DWSN account), with some mate-\nrial drawn from one-on-one interviews conducted through private messaging. These\ninterviews were preceded with informed consent notices. In all cases, in keeping with my\nuniversity's IRB standards, I offered to reveal my identity to those I interviewed, but (in\nkeeping with the strictly anonymous character of the DWSN) my identity was refused.\nHowever, I also provided a draft of this essay to the DWSN administrators I spoke to and\nhave revised according to their feedback (call it another round of blind peer review).\nThus, just as Boellstorff did with Second Life, I focused on how DWSN members\ninteract within the site and how the site is structured. In this sense, I paid attention to the\ngovernance and interaction dynamics of the site in much the same manner as Geert\nLovink's (2003) analyses of the Amsterdam Digital City and nettime (but without any\noffline contact with DWSN members). That is, I engaged in participant observation,\nfocusing on the intersection between site architecture (Davis, 2010; Star, 1999) and\nmember actions in the vein of digital ethnography as explicated by Gabriella Coleman\n(2010), paying attention to \"various frames of analysis, ... history, and the local contexts\nand lived experiences of digital media\" (p. 488).\nPower/freedom: lenses to see in the dark (web)\nAlthough the strict anonymity of the DWSN narrowed the scope of my work (in that I\ncould not talk to DWSN members offline), an ethnography of any SNS must also be\nfocused. Despite being less accessible than \"clear web\" SNSs such as Facebook or\nTwitter, the DWSN has shown evidence of growth since its founding in 2013. During my\nobservation of the site over a period of 10months, the DWSN's number of accounts grew\nthousands of micro-blog posts. Although these are not numbers on the scale of Facebook\nor Twitter, they are impressive, given that finding the DWSN is not a simple matter of\nGoogling for it. More to the point, it would be impossible to observe or speak with thou-\nsands of people.\nTo focus my study, I sought lenses (or \"categories,\" as Koopman and Matza (2013)\nwould call them) with which to illuminate activities on the DWSN. The two I use are\npower and freedom. These lenses, I should stress, are not free-floating concepts that I\nwill simply grab from a theoretician and then \"apply\" to the DWSN. These lenses come\nfrom the context in which the DWSN emerges: the \"media ideology\" (Gershon, 2010) of\nthe dark web, specifically as this ideology appears in journalistic coverage. This cover-\nage forms part of the historical context the DWSN finds itself operating in, and thus,\njournalists' articulation of \"power\" and \"freedom\" informs the experiments with power/\nfreedom I explore in the DWSN below.\nI see two main threads in news reporting about the dark web, with one dominant and\nthe other less dominant but quite prevalent. First, there is the conception of the dark web\nas entirely composed of illegal or taboo activities and in need of policing. Second, there\nis the idea that the dark web can preserve a valued liberal freedom: freedom of speech.\nThus, what appears in this media ideology is a \"reciprocal and incompatible\" (Foucault,\nThe popular media coverage of the dark web is redolent of moral panics that have been\nassociated with Internet culture over the past 35years, such as the panic about computer\nhackers and phone phreaks in 1980s (resulting in the arrest of many young computer\nusers); the US Congress' Communications Decency Act of 1996, brought on by a moral\npanic about pornography on the Web; and the US Congress Deleting Online PredatorsAct\nof 2006, inspired by moral panics over pedophiles on Myspace. Especially since the\nmedia coverage of the Silk Road drug market bust and the Freedom Hosting child pornog-\nraphy (CP) bust, both in 2013 (Borland, 2013), the dark web is currently inspiring similar\npanics centering on fears of CP, the drug and gun trade, and killers for hire.\nOne Sun headline is a series of adjectives that bind the dark web with CP: \"Child sex\ndark web targeted\" (Wooding, 2013).Areporter for The Age notes the dark web is \"where\npornographic images to satisfy the most depraved tastes can be downloaded\" (Ormsby,\n2012). The dark web is \"a hub for black markets that sell or distribute drugs\" (Pagliery,\n2014). Gizmodo profiled the dark web gun store The Armory, asking \"Could a band of\nanonymous weapon mongers prepare me and 19 imaginary compatriots for illegal war-\nfare? If you've got a spare million or so, looks like the answer is yes\" (Biddle, 2012). The\nDaily Mail calls Tor a \"seething matrix of encrypted websites\" where one could hire\nhitmen for US$10,000. \"So for those looking to bump off a difficult acquaintance, all\nthey have to do is enter the Deep Web--known also as the `Dark Web'or the `Undernet'--\nand search `hitman for hire'\" (Mail Online, 2013). Implicit throughout this coverage is a\ncall for more policing of the dark web (e.g. Biddle, 2012; Bingham, 2013; Gillespie,\nDespite this dominant idea of the dark web as only useful to pedophiles, assassins,\nand junkies, recently more Internet users have started to use Tor and even hidden .onion\nsites (see Figure 1). This rise has been attributed in part to Edward Snowden's revelations\nabout National Security Agency (NSA) and General Communication Headquarters\n(GCHQ) surveillance of the Internet (Borland, 2013). For privacy purposes, this is a\npositive development; more Tor users means more traffic and thus more obfuscation of\nuser identities (Dingledine et al., 2004). This ties in with a secondary thread in popular\ncoverage of the dark web: its affordances for journalists, activists, and whistleblowers\nwho want to speak freely, despite state monitoring of the Internet. Many of the above-\ncited stories note that anonymizing software such as Tor can benefit anyone who wants\nto dissociate speech from identity, including political dissidents (e.g. Pagliery, 2014). As\nNational Public Radio reported,\nTor's executive director is working with victims of domestic abuse who need to communicate\nwithout being tracked by their abusers. Tor is also used by Chinese dissidents who can't access\nsites like Twitter. And it became a valuable tool during the Arab Spring. (Rath, 2014)\nWired reports, \"While not a perfect means of anonymity, [Tor] has become widely\nused by journalists communicating with sources, human rights activists, and dissi-\ndents in war-torn areas such as Syria\" (Borland, 2013). As this secondary thread in the\nmedia ideology holds, Tor and hidden .onion sites can be used for free speech, a lib-\neral ideal.\nThus, this media ideology portrays the the dark web as a place of excessive freedom\n(due to anonymity), which is in need of forms of power2 to contain that excess. However,\nthis ideology also posits a limit to power in the form of the liberal right to free speech.\nsince been attributed to a Ukrainian botnet. However, after the spike, usage has clearly gone\nup. This is attributed to the Snowden revelations about the NSA.\nNSA: National Security Agency; Tor: The Onion Router.\nPower and freedom are overdetermined here, and the devil is in the details as to what is\nprotected speech and what is in need of policing. Admittedly, this reciprocal and incom-\npatible power/freedom assemblage presented in journalistic coverage of the dark web is\nsomewhat simplistic, but of course journalism can powerfully shape other discursive\narenas (e.g. policymaking). Drawing on Wendy Chun's (2006) work on power and free-\ndom on and through the Internet, the journalistic coverage of the dark web allows us to\nsee how this reciprocal incompatible power/freedom relationship is extramedial to the\ndark web itself, representing it for curious people, causing the dark web to \"exist within\nthe public's imagination before\" use of the dark web can become \"a regular public prac-\ntice\" (p. 23). Such coverage constitutes a historical a priori to many users'confrontations\nwith the dark web--myself included--and it has shaped and no doubt will continue to\nshape uses of the dark web. Here, following the examples of Chun and Foucault, I want\nto pick up these journalists' power/freedom lenses with an eye toward empirically find-\ning and then conceptualizing specific, concrete forms of power/freedom I observed in the\nDWSN, a very particular use of the dark web. I turn to that observation next.\nThree practices on the DWSN\nThe DWSN should be readily recognized as an SNS: it allows for individual accounts,\nwith customizable member pages, connections through \"friending,\" social praise in the\nform of \"liking,\" and a Twitter-like micro-blogging system, among other features. As an\nSNS, there are generic and architectural constraints and affordances built into the soft-\nware, and these are used by administrators and members to shape the site's culture. Like\nother SNSs, the DWSN has terms of service (TOS) and a privacy policy. These are\nenforced in a variety of ways, including through discussion and through technical meas-\nures like deleting of posts or member accounts. Finally, there are cultural norms that are\nexpressed by both members and administrators as they communicate in the site.\nAll of these elements contribute to the DWSN's particular assemblage of reciprocal\nincompatible tensions of power/freedom. I illustrate this with three specific DWSN prac-\ntices: the anonymous/social networking, the prohibition against CP, and the productive\naspects of techno-elitism.\nAnonymous/social networking\nIt is notable that the popular press coverage of the dark web explored above does not\ndiscuss SNSs. SNSs, it appears, are outside the media ideology of the dark web. For\njournalists covering the dark web, the idea of dark web users engaging in social network-\ning in the generic forms we now recognize--for example, friending, following, liking,\nposting--seems to be unimaginable. That is, there is no articulation of \"social network-\ning\" with either illicit activities or liberal free speech on the dark web.\nThis tells us something about the current social mediascape. Contemporary social\nnetworking, especially Facebook, is now associated with the use of real-world identities\nand is (perhaps because of this) considered to be a safe and acceptable online practice.\nFacebook specifically has been quite successful in fostering a culture of \"real-world\nidentities,\" but it did so in the face of a culture of anonymity and pseudonymity that was\nprevalent on the Web from 1990 on. We can contrast Facebook, which was initially only\nopen to those with a Harvard email address, with its mid-2000s rival Myspace, which\nallowed anyone with an email account to sign up. During their mid-2000s rivalry,\nFacebook grew as Myspace was mired in moral panics about fake accounts, pedophiles,\nand cyberbullying (Marwick, 2008). In contrast, Facebook users were vetted first by\ntheir university email accounts and later by their real-world social networks, and thus,\nFacebook was seen as \"safer\" for users (boyd, 2007) as well as advertisers (Gehl, 2012).\nThis practice is continued to this day, as Facebook requires new users to verify their\nidentity with a mobile phone account or a government-issued ID.\nThe DWSN is more redolent of social networking before Facebook, that is, social\nnetworking with pseudonyms. In fact, Facebook's aggressive mapping of real-world\nidentities is part of the problem that the DWSN seeks to address. As the DWSN creator\nputs it, \"[DWSN] was born in an impulse, I was deeply upset about facebook sharing/\nselling my personal data and with the general lack of privacy on the clear web.\" Whereas\nsocial networking prior to Facebook left it up to users to decide whether or not they\nwanted to use their \"real-world\" identities, Facebook's culture of real-world identities\nhas made it extremely attractive to marketers who seek precision in their targeted adver-\ntising (Gehl, 2014). Moreover, users of Facebook have done the work of mapping their\n\"social graphs,\" which allows governments to easily trace dissident and criminal net-\nIn contrast, the DWSN privacy policy (excerpted above) asks that members reveal no\npersonal information about themselves. Although this cultural norm helps produce the\npossibilities of anonymous speech, it comes with a price: members must adhere to the\npolicy. Here, anonymity is not springing from liberal freedom, but is rather a cultural and\ntechnical requirement of the site itself. A key text in the DWSN mythology, Mentor's\n\"Hacker Manifesto,\" illustrates this. Part of the \"Manifesto\" addresses identity:\nThis is our world now ... the world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the baud ....\nWe exist without skin color, without nationality, without religious bias ... and you call us\ncriminals .... Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. My crime is that of judging\npeople by what they say and think, not what they look like.\nA copy of the \"Manifesto\" was posted to DWSN in April 2014 by a DWSN admin. In\na discussion we had a few months later about identity on DWSN, this same admin cited\nthe \"Manifesto\" and said,\nTell me who you ARE not WHO you are. [DWSN] isn't all about anonymity, it's about soul.\nIt's about putting a piece of yourself out there for the world to see that you otherwise would\nhave been too hesitant to allow others to witness in a traditional setting.\nThis admin calls for disembodied communication dissociated from putatively super-\nficial markers such as race or gender, evidenced by the idea of an essential \"soul\" that\nemerges through discourse. This is a longstanding ideal of the Internet, perhaps best\nillustrated by John Parry Barlow's (1996) \"Declaration of the Independence of\nCyberspace\" (and best challenged, it should be noted, by the work of Lisa Nakamura\nDuring my time on the site, I have seen this policy reinforced largely through discus-\nsion. For example, an admin told me that if anyone does sign up for the DWSN with a\nreal-world identity,\nWe immediately contact them and help them understand their mistakes as fast as possible. We\ndo not step in and change the account details, we're not nannies, we respect the idea that\nsomeone could do it purposefully but we step in to make sure the user knows what they are\ndoing.\nI have not seen anyone removed from the site for revealing personal information, but\nI also have not seen anyone reveal real-world names or email accounts. To do so would\nbe, to use that administrator's term, a \"mistake.\"\nMoreover, this administrative enforcement appears to have affected the daily culture\nof the site. When one member used the DWSN blog to ask to meet others in theAmerican\nMidwest in order to coordinate culture jams against various corporations, another mem-\nber--not an admin--replied, \"People spend time in Onionland because they are doing\nthings that they want to keep hidden. Saying where they live, even a general area like the\nAmerican Midwest, is rather counter to the point.\" After that, the original poster stopped\ndiscussing the American Midwest dark web networking idea. Here, the practice of not\nrevealing personal information (i.e. one's physical location) is enforced through mem-\nber-to-member discussion.\nHowever, recent research has shown that online pseudonyms are very important to\npeople who use them and that in fact much of the \"real-world\" identity of a user is mani-\nfested in an online persona (e.g. Gatson, 2011). Although the culture of the DWSN is\npremised on no personal information being revealed, thus freeing the member from tell-\ning others \"WHO [they] are\" as the admin I spoke to put it, the structure of social net-\nworking (with a stable, individual account, use of avatars, text-based self-descriptions,\nand accumulation of friends and accolades such as \"likes\") can mean that members\ninvest much of their time--and thus their sense of self--into their DWSN pseudonyms,\nthus expressing \"who [they] ARE.\"\nThis is important to emphasize: To engage in a practice of total anonymous freedom\nthrough the DWSN, one would have to create a new account every time one used the site,\ntaking care never to link statements one makes to a coherent pseudonym. This is possible\nbut is discouraged through the technical interfaces of the site as well as perceptions of\nhow to \"do\" social networking. One does not use a fake account every time; one builds\nsidering member home pages on the DWSN, which feature textual descriptions of the\nmember, avatars, and collections of \"widgets\" that the members can customize. It is also\nillustrated when members leave the site: often other members ask, \"Where did X go?\"\nThus, although there is freedom in anonymity (a freedom enforced through policy and\npractice), there is also the cultural and technical constraints and affordances of social\nnetworking that mitigate against or delimit total anonymity. Anonymous/social network-\ning is thus reciprocal and incompatible.\nReturning to the dominant media ideology of the dark web, delinking real-world iden-\ntity and online activity should immediately bring to mind the most common narrative\nabout anonymous online speech: that it is hateful, bent only toward the satisfaction of\ntaboo or illegal desires. In this narrative, by (re)making social networking anonymous on\nthe dark web, the DWSN should only be populated by terrorists and child pornographers,\ndark manifestations of liberal conceptions of freedom. However, here we can see another\npower/freedom tension play out, illustrated best by the problem of CP, a tension that adds\nanother layer to the anonymous/social networking tension I have just laid out.\nSurveillance in the DWSN: freedom from CP\nCommercial activities (such as the trade of weapons and drugs) are not allowed on the\nDWSN, contradicting the popular conception of the dark web explored above. But above\nall, the site's biggest prohibition is against CP. According to an admin, child pornogra-\nphers \"are a problem on the dark/deep and we do not welcome them here .... CP is the true\nblack sheep of the dark/deep communities.\" Another admin vowed, \"I'll chase and ban all\nCP material.\" This is no easy task. To enforce this policy, administrators must constantly\nmonitor the site; there are no technological solutions (such as filtering algorithms). An\nadmin told me, \"The tried and true way is for diligent admins to delete any user practicing\nthis taboo immediately.\" However, this work gets reinforced as the culture of the site is\ndefined in part as not allowing child pornographers: \"Through this basic social filter we\nend up with a user base that primarily see the child pornographers as a problem as well\nand contributes to keeping an eye out for any potential abuses.\" Every page has a \"Report\nThis\" button, and members are encouraged to use it if they see site violations.\nIndeed, in my time on the DWSN, I have seen no evidence of CP or anything that\nmight be defined as pornographic for that matter. I did witness one member asking for\npictures of, specifically, 15-year-olds, but that member's post and account were deleted\nwithin a matter of minutes. Another asked for \"kitty porn,\" perhaps as a way to defeat a\npotential filter against the phrase \"kiddie porn\"; that account, too, was deleted quickly.\nThe DWSN's reputation as virulently anti-CP gets reflected in how it appears on the all-\nimportant link indexes of .onion sites--it is one of the few hidden SNSs listed by \"No\nCP\" indexes.\nThis is not to say that CP does not exist on the DWSN. It appears as a topic of political\nand ethical discussion. Many on the DWSN have discussed what to do about CP and\npedophiles. The consensus, at least from my observation, is that heavy-handed laws and\nmoral panics would do no good. The goals of the DWSN, which seem to be held by many\nmembers, are to maintain the technical and cultural capacities for anonymity and use the\nfreedom associated with anonymous speech to challenge state and corporate power. As\nstates propose or pass laws against CP, DWSN members often debate them. One example\noccurred after the BBC reported that downloading \"child abuse manuals\" was going to\nbe made illegal in the United Kingdom, on a par with downloading manuals on how to\nbe a terrorist (BBC News, 2014). DWSN members and administrators--many of whom\nwho had in other places professed hatred of child pornographers--debated this move by\nthe UK government. One member asked,\nWhat happens if someone is coerced into downloading such a manual, naively (e.g. tell them\nit's a crack for a video game, etc), then reported (anonymously of course) to the cops? What\nhappens if someone genuinely accidentally downloads such a manual? What happens if\nsomeone's machine is compromised, then their HD filled with such manuals?\nAnother added,\nThe annoying thing about this kind of law to me is it's pure gesture. This is going to do fuck all\nto stop children being sexually abused. Society's attitude toward pedophilia is very much\nbrushing it under the carpet--making it more illegal, and never actually addressing the problem\nof pedophilia as a mental illness.\nAnd another,\nI really hate CP and I think it should be fought [relentlessly;] however knowledge should never\nbe illegal. First ban those manuals, then something else, then another thing then etc. and in the\nend only one book is legal in the country. That's the point.\nThus, although CP is banned on the DWSN, although members and administrators\nreadily scour the site to remove any such material, members are vehemently against\nstates banning the acquisition of CP-related materials. Notably, in the first quote, the\nmember of this anonymous social network decried the use of anonymity to report an\nunwitting offender of this proposed law.\nThis is a complex mix of power/freedom, anonymity, and accountability, a mixture\nthat is dangerous, where the right policy, technical infrastructure, and practice to deal\nwith the serious problem of CP are never quite clear, but the consequences of laws and\nprohibitions can have devastating effects on populations. The DWSN, by banning CP\nand yet decrying that ban when states do it, is attempting to negotiate these incompatible\nand reciprocal practices.\nTechno-elitism as community building\nThe apparent contradiction between residents of a DWSN decrying a state-based ban on\nCP while upholding their own ban within the architecture of their social network points\nus to another power/freedom tension: the productive aspects of techno-elitism. Many of\nthe members of the DWSN use visible markers to show their technical proficiency: they\ndiscuss coding, hacking, and running pirate radio stations. This is redolent of the long-\nstanding hacker culture of \"do it yourself,\" which extends to governance: We do not need\na clumsy state to regulate us; we can do it ourselves with superior information technolo-\ngies (again, see Barlow's \"Declaration\" for a key text in this vein).\nThis techno-elitism appears in discourses about who is a proper DWSN member and\nwho is not. Certainly, signing up for the DWSN is free, and within a few minutes, one\ncan build a full profile and begin interacting with other members. On the face of it, the\nDWSN is very open and easy to use. However, given the fact that the site is hidden only\nto Tor users and moreover only to those who find the site (usually through .onion direc-\ntories--themselves not always easy to find), technical knowledge is needed to join the\nDWSN. This technical knowledge is seen as a sort of \"admissions test\" one must pass\nbefore being seen as competent in helping build the DWSN community.\nA discussion I had with an admin about the lack of popular media coverage of the\nDWSN reveals this techno-elitism. The admin I spoke to likened DWSN to a \"corner\ncafe,\" a semi-private space that only locals know about. \"Now one day you walk into\nyour perfect corner of heaven to find some douchebag TV cooking show host standing in\nthere with half a dozen cameras and a production team,\" the admin asks me to imagine.\n\"Now your quiet little spot has been broadcast to every corner of the known globe.\" This\nwould broadcast the cafe to people \"too incompetent/lazy [to] find a place like it for\nthemselves,\" effectively \"watering down\" the cafe. In this analogy, of course, DWSN is\nthe cafe, and \"douchebag TV cooking show\" is \"clear web\" coverage of the site, which\nwould attract too many users who were previously incapable of using Tor to find DWSN.\nToo many such \"incompetent/lazy\" people on the DWSN would harm the site's culture.\nAs a member theorized, if the site becomes popular, \"Ignorant users [would] flock to the\nDWSN and shitposting starts trending. The idyllic laid back administration system\nproves not enough and the site needs major structural changes to accommodate such a\nuser base.\" Instead, both the admin and member argue for the site to remain hidden to\nanyone without the skills to use Tor and navigate hidden services. \"Those with eyes to\nsee can find us,\" the admin commented in a micro-blog post.3\nThis is illustrated well by the reaction to two \"clear web\" intrusions into DWSN. First\nwas the discovery, early in the site's history, that Google was indexing DWSN, meaning\nthat anyone doing a Google search could see content from the DWSN, even without a\nTor-equipped browser. A DWSN admin called for a vote on whether to allow Google to\ncontinue indexing the site. Although the admin called for a vote, the admin somewhat\nshaped the discussion by noting, \"even if [DWSN]'s objective is to provide a non-gov-\nernment, non-profit, anonymous dark web social network for citizens worldwide to share\nfruitful ideas, the fact that we can be seen [on Google search results] kinda sucks.\" Many\nusers weighed in on the matter, arguing that Google should not be able to index anything\non the DWSN. One member argued,\nI am here because I don't want to contribute to the likes of google and facebook. Allowing\nmajor entities to index the content here ... will continue to have a significant chilling effect on\nwhat users will feel safe sharing here. Yes, [DWSN] is a \"social network\" but that doesn't mean\nwe shouldn't value user privacy above all else ...\nAnother member, who is also an administrator of another .onion site, noted,\nThere is also the theory that \"The teacher will appear when the student is ready.\" [New\nmembers] might make it to [DWSN] by google search but accessing the URLvia TOR [requires]\neffort and in my opinion [is] the admission test.\nIn other words, having Google make any content from the DWSN appear on the\n\"clear web\" would make it too easy for novice users to discover the site. Installing Tor\nand finding the site's unique URL were presented as \"admission tests.\"\nA similar discussion occurred later when members posted to the site's micro-blogging\nfeed (a 140-character feed similar to Twitter) that Wikipedia had an entry about the site.\nThe Wikipedia entry, however, was subject to deletion because there are very few sources\nto cite to prove the notability of the DWSN. Perhaps because the Wikipedia page was\nlikely to be deleted, the discussion about it was somewhat more ambivalent than the\nGoogle discussion. One admin noted that the DWSN \"is a living thing now, let's see\nwhat happens:),\" implying that some \"clear web\" coverage might be tolerable. Another\nadmin, however, bluntly stated \"I'd prefer it just be deleted and disappear.\" A member\nexpressed both views:\ni'm only here [since] a few days, need to find my way a bit and I think a bit more users to make\n[the DWSN] more \"alive\" would be cool ... but with more coverage on the clearnet, who\nknows what kind of people start visiting.\nLater, the Wikipedia entry was deleted, and one member quipped, \"Awww. Maybe I\nshould run over there and give [DWSN] a great writeup. NOT!\"\nThese moments, probably more than anything else, illustrate how the DWSN admin-\nistrators and members are experimenting with the incompatible and reciprocal power/\nfreedom relationship. Through techno-elitism--that is, through the desire to keep the site\nhidden to those with the technological \"eyes to see\"--DWSN members and administra-\ntors establish a power relationship between themselves and those on the clear web: We\nare technical elites, and you are hapless clearwebbers caught in the nets of the NSA.\nMoreover, the site is biased toward English. As one admin informed members,\nAll [DWSN] texts will be in English as a primary and sole language. This means website text,\npolicies, and notices sent by website admins, etc will always be in English. Other languages are\nwelcomed and tolerated but they will not become official (or used by site staff) languages. Of\ncourse user created groups are welcome to use their own languages but [DWSN] was, is and\nwill be a primarily English language site for the foreseeable future.\nThese practices--of being \"in the know\" and English-only policies--can be extremely\nexclusive and thus undermine the claims to \"freedom\" that permeate the site. After all, if\nNSA spying and Facebook surveillance are as terrible as many on the DWSN say they\nare, why not seek to get as many Internet users off the \"clear web\" and onto the dark\nweb? Why not make the site accessible to non-English speakers?\nHowever, such techno-elitism is not simply exclusive; it is productive. Maintaining\nthe DWSN as a small community can aid in the shaping of the site culture as described\nabove, allowing the administrators to police a smaller community for CP and other unde-\nsired practices and allowing the overall culture of the site to develop slowly over time.\nRequiring technical ability--the ability to install and use Tor, to find the site, and to sign\nup for an SNS without divulging personal details--is disciplinary, an encoding of par-\nticular actions and habits in potential site members, helping to produce the very subjects\nthat the administrators want to enroll in the site. Similarly, making English an official\nlanguage of the site excludes many people, but it is also the case that translating all site\nmaterials into other languages would likely require a massive amount of labor that the\nsmall number of administrators could not provide, distracting them from the work of\ncultivating the site.\nThese acts of power are productive and allow for particular forms of freedom. After\npassing those tests and agreeing to those cultural and technical constraints, users are free\nto pursue many topics of discussion. There are groups discussing the continuing crises in\nUkraine (in both Ukrainian and English), discussing protesting the Brazilian govern-\nment's handling of the World Cup (with entries mainly in Portuguese), and discussing\nSpanish electoral politics (with entries mainly in Spanish). There are, unsurprisingly,\ngroups dedicated to the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, information security, setting up and run-\nning .onion and.i2p sites, hacking (both in the \"black hat\" cracking sense and the \"white\nhat\" security research sense), filesharing, and drugs (although the sale of drugs on the\nsite is forbidden per the TOS prohibition on commercial activity). But there are also\ngroups for feminists, philosophers (although, seemingly, not feminist philosophers),\narchaeologists, labor rights activists, and news junkies. In other words, the DWSN is like\nmany online gathering places: It is a teeming mix of many interests.\nConclusion: DWSN as an experiment with power/freedom\nWhat do we make of these power/freedom tensions on the DWSN? As Foucault argues\nin \"What is Enlightenment?,\" critique \"is a historical investigation into the events that\nhave led us to constitute ourselves and to recognize ourselves as subjects of what we are\ndoing, thinking, saying\" (Foucault, 1984: 45). Moreover, he argues, such critique must\nbe about experimenting with such historically imposed limitations. The members and\nadministrators of the DWSN are doing this critical work--tracing, deploying, and\nworking against both the historical limits of mainstream social networking and the his-\ntorical limits of the media ideology of the dark web. They know the dark web is seen in\npopular culture as only used by drug traders and child pornographers. They also know\nthat mainstream social media--a \"safe\" space on the clear web--presents the problems\nof surveillance and the commodification of personal data. To experiment with both\nhistorical conditions, the DWSN is reverse engineering (Gehl, 2014) the functionality\nand cultural practices of sites such as Facebook and Twitter and porting these functions\nonto the dark web.\nThe DWSN is building a dark web space that is productive in two senses. First is the\n\"be the media\" sense of mainstream social media sites: the now-classic narrative about\nsocial media is that the user is in control and that all of us are \"produsers\" making our\nown culture through digital creativity (e.g. Bruns, 2008). However, the DWSN is also\nbringing software- and culturally developed social media restrictions to the dark web. In\nother words, it is porting in the standards of social media sites such as Facebook and\nTwitter: centralization, surveillance, prohibitions on actions, and the channeling user\nactivity to algorithmic and interface-driven ends. Both of these interact in the heteroge-\nneous assemblage, that is, the DWSN.\nThis brings me to the DWSN's specific assemblage of power/freedom. I am mindful\nof Foucault's (2008: 186) call to specify and concretize categories such as power and\nfreedom, echoed by Coleman's (2010) call to \"localize\" and specify digital media (p.\n489). Both Foucault and Coleman recommend empirical methods (i.e. genealogy, eth-\nnography) to trace contexts and assemblages and avoid narrowing of any object qua\nuniversalizing it (see also Koopman, 2013).\nIn this vein, I would offer that the specific, concrete power/freedom practices of the\nDWSN center on practices of anonymity and infrastructure. Although at first glance\nanonymity might simply appear to be a form of freedom and infrastructure simply a form\nof power, they are reciprocal and incompatible in that each contains elements of each.\nThat is, there are moments we can speak of \"anonymity-power\": for example, the disci-\nplinary admonitions to be anonymous on the DWSN, as well as the advantages of using\na pseudonym to administer a site. We can also speak of \"infrastructural-freedom\": the\nmix of the infrastructure of existing .onion hidden services as well as open-source social\nmedia software packages to allow for a complex form of dark web communication and\nsocial expression that cannot exist on the \"clear web.\" Moreover, this form of infrastruc-\nture-freedom is available to all who learn how to navigate it; it is a freedom that comes\nfrom the technical skill needed to find the DWSN.\nWe can of course speak of anonymity-freedom: the use of anonymous communication\nto explore ideas that are marginalized in more mainstream contexts, including proverbial\n\"third rail\" issues like suicide, violent political change, or pedophilia. As one DWSN\nmember told me, if \"I want to talk about things illegal in my country or report some\nabuse I can without fear of retaliation. This is it. Nothing exceptional.\" And we can speak\nof infrastructure-power: after all, the administrators can delete posts or accounts with\nrelative impunity due to the centralization of the DWSN (I have witnessed this many\ntimes).\nI see the DWSN as an experiment with power and freedom through anonymity and\ninfrastructure, an experiment of going beyond historically imposed limits. In terms of\nsocial networking, the anonymous elements of the DWSN are a far cry from what we\nnow would recognize as mainstream social media, which involves real-world identities\nincreasingly linked to consumer preferences and noopolitical control (Gehl, 2013).\nRather, the DWSN is not-for-profit and thus is not interested in producing its members\nas niche audiences to be sold to marketers. Moreover, the DWSN appears to be--\nalthough I cannot ever say for certain--virulently dedicated to protecting members\nagainst law enforcement and state power, something that cannot be said of Facebook,\nwhich after all has patented a means to hand user data over to governments (United\nAdditionally, the DWSN is also dedicated to fighting the dominant conception of the\ndark web as a place that only the vilest among us want to be. Rather than fleeing the ever-\nsupervised, ever-controlled Internet to some hidden, carefree corner where total anony-\nmous freedom takes control, the DWSN shapes internal discourses in order to develop\nitself as (as its About page puts it) \"a safe and moderated environment for the productive\nexchange of information.\" This is not a free-for-all, but neither is it a space where every-\nthing is controlled and thus happy (as Facebook seemingly wants to be).\nThe point is power and freedom always operate on one another. To challenge surveil-\nlance power as found in corporate social media and in state surveillance agencies and to\nchallenge the ideology of an anything-goes dark web, the DWSN deploys an assemblage\nof anonymity and infrastructure to create an experimental \"space-time\" beyond the his-\ntorical conditions it finds itself in (Deleuze, 1995: 172). Power and freedom \"must be\ndeployed simultaneously so that we can work within the internal tensions of their rela-\ntionships\" (Koopman, 2013: 169). To transform one, we have to transform the other in\nexperiments. Such \"experimental freedom perhaps does not make for good cinema on\nthe blockbuster model. But it does make, and may make further, for good practices of\nfreedom\" (Koopman, 2013: 174). The quiet, hidden, clear web-leery DWSN is just such\nan experiment, one that its members and administrators are always tinkering with--\nsometimes well, sometimes poorly, and never with guarantees. As Wendy Chun (2006)\nargues in Control and Freedom, \"From our position of vulnerability, we must seize a\nfreedom that always moves beyond our control, that carries with it no guarantees but\nrather constantly engenders decisions to be made and actions to perform\" (p. 30).\n"
