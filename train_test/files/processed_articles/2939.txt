Under asymmetric or concentrated bank\nborrowing we understand the situation when firms predominately borrow from one\nrelationship lender and parallel borrow smaller amounts from multiple arm's-length\nlenders. The German financial system with its Hausbank notion presents itself an ideal\nenvironment to study creditor concentration since many firms borrow not only from their\nHausbank but also seek funding, to a varying degree, from other banks.\nAlthough there is an evidence of the asymmetry in borrowing only a few recent papers\nmodel creditor concentration (Elsas, Heinemann and Tyrell (2004), Guiso and Minetti\nliterature by empirically investigating the degree of creditor concentration of German firms.\nIn this paper (i) we suggest concentration as a more detailed measure of bank-firm\nrelationships; (ii) we study the impact of firm and market characteristics and the\ncharacteristics of the relationship lender on our measures of creditor concentration; (iii) we\nstudy the impact of the financing decisions of the relationship lender on the lending\nbehavior of other banks.\nTo investigate these issues we use a comprehensive dataset collected by the Deutsche\nBundesbank. The dataset is a matched bank-firm level dataset with 16,713 firm-bank-year\nobservations consisting of three sources: the German credit register (MiMik), firm balance\nsheets (Jalys/Ustan) and bank balance sheets (BAKIS), for a period of eleven years between\nOur findings suggest that firm, bank and market characteristics are important\ndeterminants of the degree of the concentration in financing.

Smaller firms and less leveraged firms have a higher concentration in their\nborrowing as well. Additionally, the degree of creditor concentration is positively related to\nthe regional market concentration of bank lending.\nMoreover, we find that the characteristics of the relationship lender have an influence on\nthe degree of creditor concentration. Concentration increases with the increase in the\nprofitability of the relationship lender. This finding confirms Detragiache, Garella and\nFinally, we find that financing decision of the relationship lender is positively correlated\nwith the lending behavior of other banks. Other banks tend to extend their lending with the\nincrease in the exposure of the relationship lender. This tendency appears to be stronger if\nthe relationship bank is a public sector bank rather than a private bank. However, there are\nalso some limits to this tendency, set by the size and by the capital of the other banks.\nOur results suggest that those firms that are low in quality and have illiquid assets per se\nwill be most affected by the distress of the relationship bank if the relationship bank is not\nable to continue financing. According to our findings these firms, however, have a lower\ndegree of concentration in their borrowing and tend to increase their borrowing from other\nbanks.\nNicht technische Zusammenfassung\nIn diesem Papier wird die Gl\u00e4ubigerkonzentration deutscher Unternehmen untersucht,\nwobei die Analyse der Asymmetrie bei der Kreditaufnahme im Vordergrund steht.

Introduction\nMultiple banking is an important economic phenomenon. There is cross-country evidence\nthat many firms establish relationships with multiple banks. Houston and James (1996), for\nexample, show that more than 60 percent of listed US firms have multiple bank\nrelationships. And Ongena and Smith (2000), analyzing bank relationships in 20 European\ncountries, show that only less than fifteen percent of the firms borrow from a single bank\nand that the average number of bank relationships is greater than five. Even small firms that\nwould benefit most from relationship lending, borrow from multiple banks (Guiso and\nMany studies focus on the optimal number of creditors, the determinants and the impact\nof multiple bank relationships. One key explanation for observing multiple bank\nrelationships is that it reduces the hold-up problem of relationship lending (Rajan, 1992 and\nvon Thadden, 1992). But multiple banking can lead to coordination failure in case of\nand Scharfstein (1996) show that multiple bank lending lowers the liquidation value of the\nfirm and only the firms of the highest credit quality tend to borrow from multiple creditors.\n* We are grateful to Franklin Allen, Elena Carletti, Tsung-kang Chen, Ben Craig, Hans Degryse, Oliver\nEntrop, Charles Goodhart, Jan P.

T\u00fcmer-Alkan\ngratefully acknowledges financial support from the ECGTN. The opinions expressed in this paper are those of\nthe authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Deutsche Bundesbank or their staff.\nBris and Welch (2005), on the other hand, argue that higher quality firms choose fewer\ncreditors signaling their confidence of not going bankrupt given that concentration\nenhances their creditors' bargaining power.\nOther studies emphasize the banks' perspective as well when exploring the optimal\nnumber of relationships. Detragiache, Garella and Guiso (2000), for example, explain how\nmultiple relationships arise from the firms' need for diversification of bank liquidity risk.\nCarletti (2004) explores how the number of bank relationships affects banks' monitoring\nincentives, and Carletti, Cerasi and Daltung (2005) analyze banks' incentives to finance a\nfirm jointly with other banks when they have limited lending abilities and monitoring is\nimportant.\nHowever, most of the literature addressing multiple banking assumes equal financing\nshares (in contrast, a large proportion of the literature deals with majority versus minority\nequity holders). However, unequal, asymmetric or concentrated bank borrowing is\nwidespread, as firms often borrow extensively from one relationship lender and smaller\namounts from multiple arm's-length lenders. Petersen and Rajan (1994), for example,\nexamine lending relationships of US firms and report that the degree of concentration in\nborrowing decreases in firm size.\nCreditor concentration may play a pivotal role in balancing the hold-up problem of\nrelationship lending with the coordination failure of multiple bank lending but only a few\nrecent papers model creditor concentration. Elsas, Heinemann and Tyrell (2004) analyze\nthe optimal debt structure for multiple but asymmetric bank financing. They emphasize the\nrole of the relationship lender in mitigating the coordination problem. They show that firms\nwith low expected cash flows or with assets of lower liquidation value prefer asymmetric\nfinancing. And Guiso and Minetti (2004) argue that banks prevent unsound firms from\ndefaulting for the purpose of seizing their assets during the restructuring process. As a\nresult, firms with more valuable and redeployable assets tend to spread their borrowing\nmore unevenly to prevent this kind of behavior by the relationship lender during\nrestructuring because, with higher asymmetry, less informed banks would have no\namong others).\nWe contribute to this emerging literature by empirically investigating the degree of\ncreditor concentration of German firms. Our analysis of creditor concentration is not only\nmotivated by recent unpublished theoretical work but also by unexplored implications in\nrecently published theoretical papers. The diversification argument in Detragiache, Garella\nand Guiso (2000), for example, also explains creditor concentration. Firms that choose\nsingle relationship banking in their model can just as easily borrow from non-relationship\nbanks if their relationship bank has liquidity problems.\nThe German financial system presents itself as an ideal environment to study creditor\nconcentration. Many firms borrow not only from their Hausbank but also seek funding, to a\nvarying degree, from multiple other banks (see Elsas and Krahnen, 1998). A comprehensive\ndataset collected by the Deutsche Bundesbank over a long period of time allows us to\ndynamically investigate creditor concentration. The dataset is a matched bank-firm level\ndataset consisting of three sources: The German credit register, firm balance sheets and\nbank balance sheets, for a period of eleven years between 1993 and 2003. This unique\ndataset allows us to observe individual lender shares and to analyze the pervasive presence\nof creditor concentration in Germany.\nWe first construct alternative measures of creditor concentration originally designed to\nmeasure market concentration. We then study the impact of firm and bank characteristics\non our measures of creditor concentration. In particular, we focus on the characteristics of\nthe relationship lender, which we identify as the bank with the largest financing share.\nFinally, controlling for firm and bank characteristics, we explore the impact of the largest\nexposure on the size of the other exposures.\nWe comprehensively document that creditor concentration is a pervasive phenomenon.\nConsequently, relationship lending seems important, not only for the small firms but also\nfor the larger firms in our sample. We further find that higher quality firms and firms with\nmore redeployable assets concentrate their borrowing. The degree of creditor concentration\nis also positively related to the regional market concentration of bank lending, confirming\nthat many firms are geographically limited in their funding choices.\nThe characteristics of the relationship lender have an influence on the degree of creditor\nconcentration as well. Concentration increases when the relationship lender is more\nprofitable, for example. An increase in financing provided by the relationship lender further\ncoincides with increases in financing provided by the other lenders. The other lenders seem\nto align their credit decisions with those of the relationship lender but only within the limits\nset by their own size and without tying up their funds in capital. Overall, our results\nindicate the importance of firm, bank and market characteristics in determining the\nconcentration of financing.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we present selected\ntheoretical models dealing with the issue of multiple banking, explore their implications for\nasymmetric financing and review recent other work modeling creditor concentration. In\nSection III, we describe the data and the methodology. We present the main estimation\nresults in Section IV, followed by a series of robustness tests in Section V. Section VI\nconcludes our findings.\nII. Literature Review\nA. Number of Relationships\nA growing theoretical literature addresses the issue of the optimal number of creditors.\nModels explaining the existence of multiple credit relationships differ in their timing (see\nFigure 1), mechanisms, outcomes and relevance for the asymmetry question. In this section,\nwe compare the mechanisms and the different outcomes of recent theoretical models (Table\n1 summarizes this discussion).\nBolton and Scharfstein (1996) explore the impact of the debt structure on the\nrenegotiation that may take place in the case of firm default. The optimal debt structure,\nthey argue, balances the benefits and costs of multiple banking. Multiple bank relationships\ndiscourage managers from strategically defaulting on a loan. But, when default is caused by\nliquidity problems, as in Hart and Moore (1989) and Bolton and Scharfstein (1990),\nmultiple lending is costly since it reduces the expected liquidation value of assets. Bolton\nand Scharfstein (1996) further explain how the optimal debt structure depends on firm\ncharacteristics. Firms with low default risk and asset complementarity should borrow from\ntwo creditors. However, when outside buyers highly value the assets, it is more attractive\nfor firms to borrow from one creditor to maximize the liquidation value.\nBris and Welch (2005) argue that due to free-riding and coordination problems dispersed\ncreditors face difficulties collecting their claims during bankruptcy. A firm that opts for\nmultiple creditors ex ante assumes a better bargaining position in the case of financial\ndistress ex post. As a result, according to Bris and Welch, higher quality firms can signal\ntheir confidence of not going bankrupt by selecting only a few creditors.\nFirms may also seek to diversify bank liquidity risk by engaging multiple financiers.\nAccording to Detragiache, Garella and Guiso (2000), for example, establishing multiple\nrelationships reduces the risk of early liquidation of a project (if liquidity shocks across\nbanks are imperfectly correlated). Their model predicts that multiple banking is more likely\nwhen banks are less fragile (but adverse selection is more severe), judicial enforcement is\ninefficient and the investment projects of the firm are not very profitable. Once in the\nmultiple banking region, the optimal number of relationship banks increases with bank\nfragility, the efficiency of enforcement and the profitability of the projects.\nThe three models discussed so far may also provide an insight into asymmetric\nfinancing. Bolton and Scharfstein (1996) and Bris and Welch (2005) both emphasize the\ncoordination problems arising with multiple creditors. An increase in the asymmetry in the\nfinancing shares makes coordination easier by either decreasing the likelihood of\nliquidation or by signaling firm quality. Detragiache, Garella and Guiso (2000) already note\nasymmetry in their single banking region. When adverse selection is mild, firms opt for\nsingle relationship banking as they can easily borrow from non-relationship banks if a\nliquidity shock affects their relationship bank. However, under the multiple banking\nregime, the model has no implications with respect to the financing shares.\nB. Asymmetry in Borrowing\nSchuele (2006) tackle the issue of asymmetric bank financing. Elsas, Heinemann and Tyrell\n(2004), for example, examine the optimal debt structure and find that especially firms\ncharacterized by high asset specificity (a high expected loss given default from the banks'\nperspective or a lower liquidation value) and firms with low expected cash flows prefer\nasymmetric financing. With efficient coordination, expected firm profits decrease in the\nsize of the financing share of the relationship lender that collects all of the benefits.\nHowever, the presence of the relationship lender may still be beneficial for the firm since it\nallows for continuation in more states of the world. As a result, the expected profits of the\nmany arm's-length lenders actually increase in the financing share of the relationship lender\nas it is more likely that these small credits will be repaid. The authors also analyze the\nrelationship between the liquidation value of the firm and the share of the relationship\nlender. They infer a non-linear relationship.\nGuiso and Minetti (2004) investigate how the informational advantage of a relationship\nlender would affect the reorganization process of a firm in distress. They show that the\noptimal allocation of information by the firm across multiple banks is related to the\nredeployability of the firm's assets and its restructuring costs. A relationship lender can\neasily recognize both the value of the firm's assets and the quality of a project. However,\nthe relationship lender may use this greater restructuring ability opportunistically to extract\nrents during reorganization. Thus banks may decide to continue bad projects if firms have\nmore valuable and more redeployable assets. Firms with this type of assets may prefer a\nhigher asymmetry in allocating their information rights across creditors to prevent such\nopportunistic behavior. They argue that as the degree of asymmetry increases, smaller\ncreditors would have fewer incentives to continue a project since the relationship lender\nwould get all of the benefits. Guiso and Minetti (2004) test their predictions on a sample of\nUS firms and report a negative impact of the share of illiquid assets on the degree of\ncreditor concentration.\nBannier (2005) models the reasons as to why asymmetric bank financing exists. Her\nmodel predicts that the higher information precision obtained by a relationship lender leads\nto a lower probability of an inefficient credit withdrawal for firms with low expected cash\nflows. While, for firms with high expected cash flows, the opposite holds true and\nasymmetric financing still results in fewer inefficient credit decisions compared to\nfinancing by a single lender and by multiple lenders with equal shares. Bannier (2006)\ninvestigates asymmetric financing and optimal firm policy. The degree of asymmetry\nenables the firm to signal its willingness to abstain from strategically defaulting,\neliminating the risk of inefficient credit withdrawal.\nSchuele (2006) examines how a relationship bank can lend in forbearance and, by its\nability to signal, play a coordinating role for the other creditors. The roll-over decision of a\nrelationship bank will be positively related to its financing share and inversely related to the\nvalue of collateral.1\nCoordination problems are not an issue in the case of bankruptcy when lenders are\nforced to cooperate. German banks coordinate successfully by forming creditor pools when\nthe firm is in distress (Brunner and Krahnen, 2001). Consequently, theoretical arguments\nexplaining the role of the relationship lender under multiple and asymmetric borrowing\nneed to be adjusted to fit this scenario. However, for the refinancing stage, coordination\nproblems and the role of the large lender remain highly relevant. Coordination problems\nmay also be an issue in syndicated loans; Sufi (2007), for example, investigates how\ninformation asymmetry influences loan syndicate structure. In contrast, we focus on\ncreditor concentration at firm level.\nIII. Data and Methodology\nA. Data Sources\nWe employ a unique matched bank-firm level dataset that contains annual information from\n1993 to 2003. The data combines three databases, i.e. the credit register (MiMik), the\n1 In other models that analyze the certification role of intermediaries, the quality of the creditor's information\nis guaranteed by the size of its own investment in the firm. Jean-Baptiste (2005), for example, argues that\nthis investment could serve as a credible signal as long as the price of the loan is taken into account while\nTakeda and Takeda (2006) analyze how the refinancing decision of a large lender affects other lenders'\nand the firm's behavior. This approach is in line with the model by Biais and Gollier (1997) where trade\ncredit with its informational content has an impact on the credit decisions of banks.\nbalance sheet data for the firms (Jalys/Ustan) and the balance sheet data for the banks\n(BAKIS2). These data sources make it possible to observe individual lender shares of\nGerman banks at firm level and to combine this information with firm and bank-specific\nbalance sheet information.\n1. Credit Register\nThe Deutsche Bundesbank's credit register (MiMik) is the main data source for the\nindividual exposures of German banks to firms. The data contains information on large\nexposures of 1.5 million Euros (formerly 3 million DM) and above. German banks are\nrequired to report their exposures exceeding this reporting threshold to the Deutsche\nBundesbank on a quarterly basis.3 Therefore, exposures to small and medium-sized firms\nmight be underrepresented in this database. However, if the sum of the exposures to firms\nin a borrower unit exceeds the threshold of 1.5 million Euros, the individual exposure to a\nfirm in that borrower unit is reported, even if it is a small exposure. This reporting partly\nabates the bias in the credit register towards medium and large-sized firms.\nThe data in the credit register is not consolidated.4 Bank exposures to firms in the credit\nregister are defined fairly broadly, e.g. they include not only corporate loans but also\ncorporate bonds.5 In the credit register we are able to distinguish between on-balance sheet\n2 BAKIS is the BAKred Information System. The German Federal Banking Supervisory Office\n(Bundesaufsichtsamt f\u00fcr das Kreditwesen (BAKred)) is one of the three supervisory agencies that merged\nin 2002 to form the current national supervisor, the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority\n(Bundesanstalt f\u00fcr Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht).\n3 For a more detailed definition, see Section 14 of the Banking Act (Deutsche Bundesbank, 2001). If\nexposures of 1.5 million Euros or above existed during the reporting period but are partly or fully repaid,\nthe remaining exposure is reported even if the amount is zero. We take the actual amounts of the exposures\ninto consideration.\n4 The consolidation of the data implies that the inter-office positions between a head institution and its\ndomestic subsidiaries are netted out and the positions are allocated to a single corporate banking group\n(Konzern).\n5 For a more detailed definition of the bank exposures, see Section 19 of the Banking Act (Deutsche\nBundesbank, 2001). The following items are deemed not to be bank exposures: shares in other enterprises\nand securities in the trading portfolio.\nand off-balance sheet items.6 We choose to use only on-balance sheet positions since the\ninclusion of off-balance sheet exposures leads to an overstatement of the actual exposures\ndue to guarantees provided by banks to the other banks. The credit register also contains\ninformation on firm identity, location, industry, legal form and the date of bankruptcy (if\napplicable).\n2. Firm and Bank Balance Sheet Data\nWe also use Jalys/Ustan and BAKIS to construct firm and bank-specific variables.\nJalys/Ustan contains annual financial statement information for many German firms.7 For\n2003, for example, the dataset contains records on 9,977 firms. The credit register is\nmatched with the firm-specific data from Jalys/Ustan first. After matching, our sample\nThe dataset is finally matched with BAKIS. BAKIS contains bank financial statements as\nwell as information on the banking groups for all German banks. For 2003, for example, the\ndataset contains records on 2,265 banks. After matching, the sample consists of an average\n6 For example, lease receivables, mortgage loans, publicly guaranteed loans, and inter-bank loans (with a\nresidual maturity of up to one year) are listed separately under on-balance sheet activities. Off-balance\nsheet items include derivatives (other than written option positions), guarantees assumed to cover these and\nother off-balance sheet transactions (Deutsche Bundesbank, 1998).\n7 There are four balance sheet types in Jalys/Ustan: opening balance sheet (Er\u00f6ffnungsbilanz), main balance\nsheet (Rumpfbilanz), tax balance sheet (Steuerbilanz) and commercial balance sheet (Handelsbilanz).\nHowever, our matched dataset consists mainly of firms with either a tax balance sheet (2/3rds of the\nsample) or a commercial balance sheet. Considering possible reporting differences among balance sheet\ntypes, we re-estimate our specifications including only firms with a tax balance sheet as a robustness\ncheck. The results remain unchanged.\n8 See the Appendix for a more detailed description of the matching process.\n9 In our study, we include all banking groups in Germany. During the time period, many bank mergers took\nplace. See the Appendix for a detailed description of the treatment of bank mergers.\nB. Measuring Concentration of Borrowing\nWe analyze concentration of borrowing at firm level using alternative measures originally\ndesigned to measure market concentration. Concentration in an industry can be measured in\na variety of ways. Bikker and Haaf (2000) compare ten different concentration measures.\nThe Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) is one of the most frequently used indices to\nmeasure market concentration and it often serves as a benchmark. The HHI captures the\nentire distribution of shares. For our application, the HHI is defined as:\n,\nn\njt ijt\ni\n=\nwhere sijt\nequals Loanijt\ndivided by Total Loansjt\n, and where Loanijt\nequals the amount of\ncredit granted by bank i to firm j in year t and Total Loansjt\nis the total amount of credit\nobtained by firm j in year t. The index is sometimes criticized because it attaches greater\nweight to larger shares as each share is used as its own weight.\nHannan (1997) studies whether the HHI can adequately account for both market share\ninequality and the number of banks in the industry. He decomposes the HHI into two terms:\n( / ) (1/ ),\njt jt jt jt\nwhere Vjt\nis the share of inequality divided by the number of banks and 1/Njt\nis the\ninverse of the number of banks. His decomposition is relevant for our study because we\nexplore the asymmetry in financing. As in Hannan (1997), we subtract the inverse of the\nnumber of banks, 1/Njt\n, from the HHI to obtain Vjt\n, which we label the Share of\nInequality Index (SII).10 We estimate all models both with an HHI and an SII.\n10 One important difference is that the HHI is the dependent variable in our model.\nHorvath (1970) suggests a comprehensive measure of concentration, which reflects both\nrelative dispersion and absolute magnitude. The Comprehensive Industrial Concentration\nIndex (CCI) is defined as:\nn\njt jt ijt ijt\ni\nCCI s s s\n=\n= + + -\nThe index is computed as the sum of the proportional share of the leading bank (largest\nexposure) and the total of the squares of the other banks' shares, weighted by a multiplier\nthat reflects the shares of the remaining part. The CCI weighs the squared share of smaller\nexposures by (2 )\nijt\ns\n- . Therefore, compared with the HHI, the CCI is more sensitive to the\nchanges in the smaller shares and, possibly, more suitable for measuring concentration in\ncartel markets (Stordal, 2004). Given the presence of concentrated borrowing in the\nGerman financial system, we also employ the CCI as an alternative measure.\nFinally, we also calculate a simple linear concentration measure. We take the sum of the\nthree largest borrowing shares to compute the concentration of a firm to its three largest\ncreditors, CR3:\njt ijt\ni\nCR s\n=\n= \u00a6\nFigure 2 presents the time variation in our concentration measures. All measures are\nrelatively stable over the sample period, except for the decrease in the last year. A sharp\ndecrease in the number of firms in the sample in 2003 may be partly responsible, a\nselection issue we address in the robustness section.\nC. Addressing the Effects of the Reporting Threshold\nThe existence of a reporting threshold of 1.5 million Euros potentially introduces a bias in\nthe sample. Using HHI as the concentration measure helps us to deal with the bias since it\nputs less weight on the smaller financing shares that are more likely to be below the\nthreshold. Still, the index is possibly consistently overestimated for small firms for which\nlarger shares are also unobserved.\nWe deal with this threshold issue in two ways. First, we simply exclude all small firms\nin robustness checks. Second, and in order to deal with the effects of the reporting threshold\nmore systematically, we calculate the HHI using two opposite assumptions about the\ncomposition of the unobserved part of the loans in the credit register. The amount of the\nunobserved part of the loans for a particular firm is defined as the difference between the\nTotal Loansjt\n, taken from the firm's balance sheet, and the sum of loan exposures, Loanijt\n,\ntaken from the credit register. Under the first assumption, the unobserved part of loans is\nconcentrated in one bank as long as it is not above 1.5 million Euros (because otherwise it\nwould have been observed in the credit register):\n( / ) [( ) / ].\nn n\njt ijt jt jt ijt jt\ni i\nHHI Loan Total Loans Total Loans Loan Total Loans\n= =\n= + -\nBut if the unobserved part of loans is above 1.5 million Euros, the amount will be\ndistributed among banks. The first bank gets assigned up to 1.499 million Euros, which is\nthe maximum loan amount that is potentially unobservable; the second bank gets assigned\nthe remaining part up to 1.499 million Euros; and so on. This procedure makes our\ncalculations more precise. Formally, we define the HHI as:\nn k\njt ijt jt jt\ni i\nn\njt ijt jt jt\ni\nHHI Loan Total Loans Total Loans\nTotal Loans Loan k Total Loans\n= =\n=\n= +\n- +\n\u00a6 \u00a6\n\u00a6\nwhere kjt\nis the integer number obtained by dividing the unobserved part of the loans by\n1.499. We use both measures alternatively in our estimations and compare the results.\nUnder the second assumption, the rest of the loans is diversified across an infinite\nnumber of banks. As a result, the remaining terms in the HHI equal zero:\nn\njt ijt jt\ni\nHHI Loan Total Loans\n=\n= +\nWe first estimate the regression models under the more realistic assumption that the\nunobserved part of loans is concentrated, then re-estimate all models under the assumption\nthat the unobserved part is diversified among an infinite number of banks.11\nTables 2 and 3 present the structure of the relationships based on the two assumptions.\nNumber of creditors, share of firms with a single bank or multiple banks and share of loans\nare first reported using the available data in the credit register. The figures imply that more\nthan half of German firms borrow from a single bank. However, due to the reporting\nthreshold, a considerable part of the loan exposures, around 30 percent in the case of the\nsingle bank, are not observable in the database. Assuming that the unobserved loans are\nconcentrated in one bank with a maximum tolerable amount of 1.499 million Euros, we\nfind that the share of firms with a single bank is thirteen percent instead of 55 percent.\nMoreover, as Table 3 shows, the average number of relationships increases from 2.14 to\n3.97 when we assume the unobserved part of loans is concentrated.\nD. Description of Explanatory Variables\nWe explain the degree of concentration with firm, bank and market-specific variables. The\ndefinition and measurement of the variables is summarized in Table 4. Empirical studies\nthat investigate firm characteristics as the determinants of relationship lending typically\nfocus on size, age, profitability/cash flow and financial leverage (e.g. Detragiache, Garella\nSize is an important factor in determining the borrowing behavior of a firm. We measure\nsize as the log of Total Assets of the firm. It is argued that smaller firms benefit more from\n11 We also randomize over the two assumptions and re-estimate all models featuring the HHI and CCI. The\nresults remain virtually unchanged.\nrelationship banking due to their informational opaqueness. In addition, ownership structure\nmight be related to the informational opaqueness as well (Volpin, 2001). However, we do\nnot have information about ownership concentration in our data. To proxy for ownership\nstructure, we include a dummy variable identifying the legal form of the enterprise\n(corporation or partnership).\nFor profitability, we use Return on Assets (ROA). Financial Leverage, computed as\nFinancial Debt to Total Assets of the firm, shows the dependence of the company on bank\ndebt. It is used as a proxy for the riskiness of the company as well. Probability of Default is\na proxy for the quality of the firm.12 To measure asset specificity, we use the Share of\nIlliquid Assets (i.e., Intangibles plus Fixed Assets to Total Assets).13\nWe are also interested in exploring whether regional characteristics play a role in\ndetermining the concentration of firms in their creditors. Therefore, we control for banks'\nconcentration in the region where the firm is located. We measure regional lender\nconcentration using the HHI of the loans in that particular region. We do not control for\nfirms' access to other sources of financing such as bonds. The sample firms are rather bank\ndependent in their financing and the share of bonds is negligible in the data with a mean\nvalue of 0.002. Table 5 summarizes the descriptive statistics for all explanatory variables.\nDetragiache, Garella and Guiso (2000) argue that firms may diversify bank liquidity risk\nby establishing multiple relationships. By including bank characteristics such as size and\n12 Probability of Default (PD) is calculated in Krueger, Stoetzel and Trueck (2005) who explain ratings using\nbalance sheet variables. Their predicted Z-Score is transformed to calculate the PD variable: PD=eZ/(1+eZ).\nSince the PD is an estimated variable, it is necessary to adjust the standard errors when including it as an\nexplanatory variable (as we use standard errors that are robust to heteroskedasticity, we need not be\nconcerned about such an adjustment).\n13 Intangible assets reported on the balance sheet in Germany contain only the purchased intangible assets,\nsuch as patents. We exclude the intangible assets from the Share of Illiquid Assets and re-estimate all\nspecifications. Results remain unchanged. Fixed assets may capture the impact of collateral on the degree\nof informational asymmetry. Since information on collateral is not available in the data, we exclude \"land\"\nand \"buildings\", which are commonly used as collateral, and re-estimate our model. Alternatively, we use\n\"cash\" instead of fixed assets to measure liquidity. All results remain virtually unchanged. We also note\nthat our sample consists of relatively large firms that are typically under less pressure to post collateral.\nfragility, we explore the impact of bank characteristics on the firms' choice of multiple\nbanking as well as the degree of concentration in borrowing. We basically investigate the\nimpact of the characteristics of the relationship lender, identified as the lender with the\nlargest share in financing. In empirical work, several proxies are used to distinguish\nbetween relationship lenders and transactional lenders. These are the length of relationship\nbetween the firm and the bank, loan categories (Detragiache, Garella and Guiso, 2000) and\nsurvey responses by banks if they consider themselves to be the Hausbank of their\nborrowers (Elsas and Krahnen, 1998). Since we do not have access to this type of\ninformation, we take the largest financing share as a proxy for relationship lending. Elsas,\nHeinemann and Tyrell (2004) and Guiso and Minetti (2004) also use shares as a proxy for\nrelationship lending. Moreover, Elsas (2005) finds evidence (using credit files of a few\nlarge German banks) of a strong connection between the share of financing and the\nprobability of being the relationship lender. We further investigate the stability of\nrelationship lending defined using the largest share of a firm. For fourteen percent of firm-\nyear observations, firms change their relationship lender compared to the previous year.\nThis suggests our relationship definition is likely to be conservative as the hazard rate is\nhigh compared to other estimates in the literature (Ongena and Smith, 2001; Farinha and\nWe further focus on the impact of the largest exposure on other exposures. We expect a\nrelationship between the size of the largest exposure and the size and characteristics of the\nother exposures. In Elsas, Heinemann and Tyrell (2004), the expected profits of small\nlenders increase in the exposure of the largest lender. This might imply a positive\nrelationship between the largest exposure and the sizes of the other bank exposures.\nMoreover, Bannier (2005) argues that the behavior of a relationship lender is observable to\nthe other banks and coordinates their actions. And in Schuele (2006) and Takeda and\nTakeda (2006), the relationship bank also influences the transactional lenders through its\nrefinancing decisions. On the other hand, the ability of the relationship lender to extract\nrents could increase in its financing share implying that the largest lender will get all of the\nbenefits and smaller lenders would not be willing to participate further in lending. Hence\nwhether and how the size of the largest exposure affects the other bank exposures remains\nan empirical question that we will also address in the next section.\nIV. Results\nA. Explaining Creditor Concentration\nWe first explore the determinants of creditor concentration.\n+ ,\njt k jtk n jtn\nk n\njt t ijt\nDegree of Asymmetry Firm Bank\nRegional Concentration z\n  \n  \n= =\n= + +\n+ +\n\u00a6 \u00a6\nwhere Degree of Asymmetryjt\ncaptures the degree of asymmetry for firm j at time t,\nwhich is measured by the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), the Comprehensive\nIndustrial Concentration Index (CCI), the Share of Inequality Index (SII) and the three bank\nConcentration Ratio (CR3), respectively. Firmjt\ncaptures firm-specific characteristics.\nBankjt\ndenotes the characteristics of the largest lender (the largest lender is defined as a\nlender with the largest share of financing). The error term is given by\nijt i j ijt\n   \n= + + ,\nwhere\ni\n and\nj\n are bank and firm-specific fixed effects and\nijt\n is a disturbance term\nwith\nijt\niid \n . Moreover, we add a set of year dummy variables,\nt\nz , in order to\ncapture omitted macroeconomic developments.\nPrevious studies often model the firm's decision process in two steps: first, the firm\ndecides whether or not to take one or multiple creditors, then the firm decides how many\nbanks or how concentrated it wants to borrow conditional on being in the multiple banking\nregion (Detragiache, Garella and Guiso,, 2000 and Guiso and Minetti, 2004). We leave the\ntwo-stage empirical specification reflecting this two-step decision process to the robustness\nsection. In this section, we take the creditor concentration as continuous, varying between 0\nand 1, where 1 presents the choice of one single creditor.\nTable 6 presents the main results under the assumption that the unobserved part is\nconcentrated (see 3.2.1, Equation 5). Panel A includes only firm-specific variables. In the\nfirst two columns we take the number of banks the firm borrows from as the dependent\nvariable. This helps us to see which factors increase the number of banks that firms choose\nto borrow from and whether these factors are different from the ones that affect the degree\nof concentration. The other columns explain our alternative measures for concentration.\nThe F-Test and the Breusch-Pagan-Test both indicate panel estimation techniques are to be\npreferred. Because the Hausman-Test rejects random effects in multiple specifications, we\nopt to report the results from the fixed effects models.\nProbability of Default and Financial Debt alternatively act as a proxy for the quality of\nthe firm and these variables are included in different specifications to avoid\nmulticollinearity. Probability of Default is positively related to the number of banks (Log\nN) and significantly negative in all other specifications, indicating that firms with a higher\nprobability of default are expected to have a higher number of banks and a lower degree of\ncreditor concentration. The magnitude of the coefficient is economically relevant as well\nsince an increase from 0.01 to 0.05 is estimated to decrease the HHI by 0.09 and the SII by\n0.06. Such an increase in Probability of Default is not unrealistic when considering the size\nof the standard deviation of 0.01 for the entire sample. In fact, it is even more plausible for\nyears with low economic growth. This finding is in line with the Bris and Welch (2005)\nmodel in which high quality firms want more concentrated credit (but it seemingly\ncontradicts the arguments by Guiso and Minetti (2004) that the quality of the firm may not\nbe related to the degree of concentration). The magnitude of the coefficient when\nexplaining the degree of concentration is the highest for the specification with the HHI as\nthe dependent variable. This implies that for larger shares in financing, a change in\nProbability of Default matters more, since HHI attaches greater weight to larger shares.\nThe size of the firm has a positive (negative) impact on the number (concentration).\nThus, larger firms not only tend to diversify their creditors, they also spread their borrowing\nmore evenly. This impact seems to originate in the asymmetry, not only in the number of\nbanks, since we also estimate that the model with alternative concentration measures is less\naffected by the number of banks, and we find this impact to be robust.\nIlliquid Assets, our proxy for the redeployability of assets, is inversely related to the\nconcentration measures in most of the specifications, a result also found by Guiso and\nMinetti (2004). Financial Debt is also positively (inversely) related to the number of banks\n(degree of concentration). The higher the bank indebtedness, the lower the degree of\nconcentration might be given the need for an increased number of creditors. On the other\nhand, Financial Debt is often used as a proxy for risk as well. In this respect, the result does\nnot contradict the finding for the Probability of Default. Profitability of the firm (ROA) is\nnot significantly related to creditor concentration but it is to the Log N. For the dummy\nvariable indicating the legal form of the firm, irrespective of whether it is a corporation or a\npartnership, we do not find strong evidence that corporations differ systematically from\npartnerships with regard to concentration of borrowing.\nIn Panel B, we include the characteristics of the relationship lender, which is defined as\nthe bank with the largest financing share. The coefficients of the firm-specific variables do\nnot differ from the ones in Panel A. The ROA of the relationship lender is significantly\nrelated to the dependent variable (except in the specification explaining SII). This finding is\nalso in line with the predictions in Detragiache, Garella and Guiso (2000) concerning the\nliquidity problems of the relationship lender. The results imply that a one-percentage point\nincrease in the earnings of the relationship lender is expected to increase the HHI by 1.91\npercentage points. The negative and insignificant coefficient for Capital Adequacy is\npositive and significant when explaining the SII. The finding of a positive relationship is\nconsistent with the literature on the market discipline of banks imposed from the\nborrowers' side.14 However, the impact of the coefficient needs further investigation since\nwe do not find the same result for other concentration measures. Moreover, it is positively\nrelated to Log N as well. The size of the relationship bank and Risk Provisions do not have\nan impact on the degree of concentration.\nWe also include dummies denoting the ownership structure of the bank, i.e. Public\nSector Banks, Cooperative Sector and Other Banks (banks with special functions) taking\nCommercial Banks as the reference group. We find that only the coefficient of Other Banks\nis positively significant when explaining Log N and the SII, implying that if the relationship\nlender belongs to the group of Other Banks rather than being a commercial bank, both the\nnumber of banks and the degree of concentration is higher. Moreover, we find that the\nregional concentration of banks, HHI Region, is positively related to the firm's\nconcentration of borrowing but it does not have an impact on the number of banks the firm\nTo summarize, risky, illiquid, large and leveraged firms that are located in a region with\nfiercer banking competition and that are engaged with an unprofitable relationship bank,\n14 In Allen, Carletti and Marquez (2005) capital acts as a commitment device to monitor borrowers. Kim,\nChristiansen and Vale (2005) find that banks avoid losses as a strategic variable to soften competition.\nBillett, Flannery and Garfinkel (2005) explore the effect of lenders' credit ratings on the borrowing firms'\nequity returns and find evidence for a positive relationship.\n15 Alternatively, we use the (Log) Number of Lenders present in a region to measure regional concentration\nbut do not report the results here. The estimated coefficient on this variable is negative but statistically\ninsignificant. All other explanatory variables remain unchanged.\nspread their borrowing more evenly between multiple lenders. Overall, we find these results\nin line with predictions in Bris and Welch (2005) and Detragiache, Garella and Guiso\n(2000). We also find that similar factors affect both `the number of banks' and `the degree\nof concentration'. The main difference is that asset redeployability and regional\nconcentration have no impact on the number of banks but a relatively strong and robust\nimpact on creditor concentration.\nB. Role of the Relationship Lender\nNext we analyze the impact of the size of the largest exposure on the sizes of other\nexposures. Thus, our specification takes the form of:\n*\nM\nijt jt m jtm\nm\nN\nn ijtn jt\nn\nM\nm jt\nm\nBank Exposure Largest Exposure Largest Lender\nBank Regional Concentration\nLargest Exposure Largest\n  \n \n\n=\n=\n=\n= + +\n+ +\n+\n\u00a6\n\u00a6\n\u00a6\n*\n*\n,\njtm\nN\nn jt ijtn\nn\nn jt jt\nK\nk jtk t ijt\nk\nLender\nLargest Exposure Bank\nLargest Exposure Regional Concentration\nFirm z\n\n\n  \n=\n=\n+\n+\n+ + +\n\u00a6\n\u00a6\nwhere Bank Exposureijt\ndenotes bank lending of all banks in the sample except of the\nbank with the largest exposure (these banks are, therefore, called the \"other lenders\") and\nLargest Exposurejt\ncaptures the exposure of the largest lender to a firm j at time t. We\nassume simultaneity for the credit decisions of the relationship lender and the other lenders\nlending behavior of the other lenders may be influenced by their own characteristics (e.g.\nbank size, bank fragility), by the size of the loan extended by the relationship lender to the\nfirm, by the characteristics of the relationship lender and by the firm characteristics. We\ntake the absolute values of exposures since the total exposures to a firm measured as\nfinancing shares in percentages total one.\nTable 7 reports the estimation results for the impact of the Largest Exposure on the\nOther Exposures. Equation (8) is also estimated with fixed effects estimation techniques.\nThe cross-sectional unit in these estimations is the loan exposure, including information on\nboth firm and bank-level dimensions. The first specification, where we control for the\ncharacteristics of the relationship lender and other lenders, indicates that a 10 percent\nincrease in the Largest Exposure is expected to increase Other Exposures by 5.7 percent.\nHence the other lenders seem to align their credit decisions with those of the relationship\nlender. Other variables do not seem to matter for the financing decisions of other banks.\nNext we include interaction terms of the Largest Exposure with the bank and market\ncharacteristics. The last specification includes firm characteristics as well. Surprisingly, we\nfind that the coefficient of the Largest Exposure becomes negative and significant in the\nsecond specification. However, the total impact of the variable is still significantly positive\nwhen taking the interaction terms into account. The results also show that if the relationship\nlender is a public bank, this has a positive impact on the size of other exposures when\ncompared to the case when the relationship lender is a commercial bank.\nThe interaction term with the (Log) Assets of other lenders has a positive coefficient\nthroughout the rest of the specifications. In other words, smaller banks tend to adjust their\ncredit decision with the financing decision of the relationship lender as long as their size\nallows them to extend more credit. In addition, the interaction term of the Largest Exposure\nwith Capital Adequacy is negatively significant, possibly implying that as the other lenders\ntie up their funds in capital their willingness to extend credit decreases. The interaction with\nHHI Region is negatively related to the dependent variable but significant only at the ten\npercent level and in one specification.\nThe size of the firm ((Log) Assets) is positively related to the size of the Other\nExposures as expected. Probability of Default is positively related to the dependent\nvariable: as predicted by Bris and Welch (2005), low quality firms do not concentrate their\nborrowing as concentration may decrease their bargaining power in case of default.16 The\ndummy variable for the legal form of the firm has a significantly negative coefficient,\nimplying that if the firm is a corporation (rather than a partnership) other lenders will tend\nto lower their financing shares. We do not include the alternative set of firm-specific\nvariables, such as financial leverage, in order to avoid a potential endogeneity problem for\nthis specification since firm financial leverage might be affected by the changes in other\nlenders' exposures.\nAs explained before, we identify the relationship lender by the size of the financing\nshare. Considering the presence of observations where the percentage of the largest share is\nlow, we re-estimate Equation 8 by excluding the observations where the share of financing\nis below 20 percent and 30 percent respectively. The results are virtually unchanged.\nSummarizing, the financing decision of a relationship lender is positively correlated with\nthe lending behavior of other banks. However, other banks seem more inclined to extend\ncredit the larger the exposure of the relationship lender, which is a public sector bank rather\nthan a commercial bank; this is particularly the case if the other banks are not small or do\nnot have to tie up additional funds in capital. Distressed, large or leveraged firms borrow\nmore from the other banks.\n16 Following the model by Bris and Welch (2005), we also analyze the impact of firm quality on loan interest\nrates for firms with a single lender. Since interest rate information is not available, we compute this\nvariable as interest rate expenses divided by financial debt of a firm minus average yields on debt\nsecurities. We do not find any relation between Probability of Default and interest rates, possibly because\nof the imprecise measurement of the loan rates.\nV. Robustness\nA. Unobserved Credit is Granted by Many Banks\nTo check the robustness of our results we compute the degree of concentration assuming\nthat the unobserved part of credit is diversified among an infinite number of banks (see\n3.2.1, Equation 6). We measure the degree of concentration by the Herfindahl-Hirschman\nIndex (HHI) and by the Comprehensive Industrial Concentration Index (CCI)\nTable 8 presents similar specifications as in Table 6 for the newly defined concentration\nmeasures. The bottom-line is that changing the assumption about the unobserved part of\ncredit does not substantially affect our estimation results. The signs and statistical\nsignificance for Probability of Default, Illiquid Assets and Financial Debt remain virtually\nunchanged. We note, however, that the coefficient on the size of the firm variable is not\nsignificant in Panel A. In addition, ROA Firm becomes positively significant.\nThe outcomes of Panel B, including bank and market-specific variables, deviate slightly\nfrom Table 6 as well. The findings for ROA Bank, Other Banks dummy as ownership type\nand HHI Region are parallel to the results of Table 6. On the other hand, the parameter for\nCapital Adequacy becomes negative and significant, a result which was not observed\npreviously.\nThe bias in the degree of concentration introduced by the reporting threshold of 1.5\nmillion Euros is possibly more pronounced for smaller firms. As an additional robustness\ncheck, we exclude the firms with a total asset value lower than five million Euros and re-\nestimate the model (but choose not to tabulate these results). As expected, the results are\n17 Remember that the SII is computed by decomposing the HHI and taking out 1/Njt\n. Since the number of\nbanks is assumed to be infinite here, 1/Njt\nequals zero and the HHI equals the SII.\ncloser to our earlier findings. ROA Firm is no longer significant, and Capital Adequacy\nBank has a smaller coefficient and lower significance level. The significance of other\ncoefficients is unchanged and even stronger for firm-specific variables. Moreover, there is\nan increase in the magnitudes of those parameters.\nB. Sample Selection\nBefore the introduction of the euro, firms issuing commercial bills were required to report\ntheir balance sheets to the Deutsche Bundesbank. Only firms with solid creditworthiness\nwere allowed to issue commercial bills. Since our data includes only firms that issued paper\nand reported to the Deutsche Bundesbank, a selection bias may be present in our estimates.\nTo assess the average quality of the firms in our sample, we compare the mean value of\nthe probability of default in our sample with the values reported in Dietsch and Petey\n(2004). They investigate stationary default probabilities for French and German small and\nmedium-sized enterprises (SMEs) from 1997 to 2001. The average PDs in both countries\nare in general much lower for large businesses. For instance, the average default probability\nfor SMEs with turnover between one and seven million Euros equals 0.79% in their study,\nwhile for SMEs with turnover between seven and 40 million Euros the average default\nprobability is only 0.14%. Our sample consists of even larger firms and the mean value of\nour probability of default equals 0.60%. Consequently, it seems unlikely that only high\nquality firms are present in our sample.\nWe further consider the fact that the number of the firms decreases over time owing to\nthe regulatory changes related to the introduction of the euro. Starting in 1999, commercial\nbills lost their importance as securities and the number of firms reporting to the Deutsche\nBundesbank decreased commensurately. We re-estimate our model ending the sample in\n1999. The unreported results are very similar for all firm-specific variables though not for\nbank profitability and regional concentration.\nC. Two- Stage Estimation\nIn this subsection, we follow the methodology by Detragiache, Garella and Guiso (2000)\nand Guiso and Minetti (2004) by applying a two-stage estimation. The first and third\ncolumns in both panels of Table 9 present the results for the first-stage probit estimating the\nprobability of multiple banking. The other columns tabulate the coefficients on the\ndeterminants of the degree of concentration measured by the Share of Inequality Index (SII)\nconditional on being in the multiple bank region. As the identification variable, we choose\nthe Legal Form Firm, a variable that was insignificant in the concentration estimations\nusing the share inequality from the previous subsection. Moreover, given previous work,\nwe do not have a strong reason to argue that the legal form of a firm should affect the\nasymmetry in bank financing. In the second stage, we also include the Mills ratio obtained\nfrom the first stage to correct for any selection bias.\nThe signs and statistical significance for most of the parameters in the second stage\nremain unchanged from Table 6. Illiquid Assets is not statistically significant when\nexplaining the degree of concentration in Panel B. But as the first specifications of both\npanels show, Illiquid Assets is positively and significantly related to the probability of\nmultiple banking. This result is in line with predictions in Bolton and Scharfstein (1996)\nand Guiso and Minetti (2004). When including the characteristics of the bank with the\nlargest share, bank profitability appears to be insignificant in both stages, contradicting\nprevious results. The probability of multiple banking decreases with the share of risk\nprovisions of banks, as predicted by Detragiache, Garella and Guiso (2000) who show that\nthe probability of multiple banking decreases in bank fragility. However, there is little\nevidence for a relationship between Risk Provisions and the SII. Interestingly, the dummy\nfor Other Banks is positively related to both probability of multiple banking and the degree\nof concentration.\nTo summarize, large and leveraged firms and firms with less liquid assets prefer multiple\nbanking. Asset liquidity, however, does not have a strong impact on the degree of\nconcentration. Risky, large and leveraged firms with a relationship lender that is a\ncommercial bank choose to have lower degree of concentration in borrowing.\nD. Other Robustness Tests\nAs an alternative linear measure for the degree of concentration, we also employ the largest\nshare of financing. We find three differences to the main results.18 Firstly, the size of the\nfirm is no longer significant. Second, the ROA of the firm positively determines the share\nof financing. Thirdly, Capital Adequacy of the bank with the largest share is negatively\nrelated to the dependent variable.19 These findings suggest that firm size matters for the\nsmaller shares of financing but that firm profitability and capital adequacy of the large\nlender do not.\nOne may argue about the direction of causality between some bank-specific variables,\nsuch as Capital Adequacy and the degree of asymmetry. When a bank extends credit, this\ndefinitely has an impact on its capital ratio. Considering the possibility of an endogeneity\nproblem, we re-estimate our regressions by excluding this variable. The results confirm our\nprevious findings. As an alternative specification, we also include lagged bank-specific\nvariables. The results remain mainly unchanged except for Illiquid Assets.\n18 We choose not to tabulate any further results. All estimation results in the robustness section are available\nupon request.\n19 These findings are similar to the results reported in Section V.A. However, recall that those results are\ncloser to the main results when we exclude smaller firms.\nNext, we control for the industry affiliation of our sample firms. We choose not to\ninclude industry affiliation in our main specifications because we lack strong theoretical\njustification for doing so and because our measure is potentially noisy and incomplete. We\nfind that our results are not driven by industry affiliation since our previous findings are\nrobust to the inclusion of industry dummies.\nVI. Conclusion\nMotivated by seminal and more recent theoretical work, we investigate the determinants of\ncreditor concentration for a unique and comprehensive sample of German firms. We focus\non the degree of creditor concentration, i.e. the degree of asymmetry in the borrowing by\nfirms from different banks. We use alternative measures of asymmetry and conduct a\nvariety of other robustness exercises.\nWe contribute to the literature by documenting that creditor concentration is widespread\nand potentially also important for large firms. Firm quality and asset redeployability is\npositively related to the degree of concentration. The degree of creditor concentration\nincreases with the increase in the profitability of the lender with the largest financing share\nand with the increase in the regional market concentration of bank lending. Other `smaller'\nlenders align their credit decisions with those of the relationship lender to the extent that\ntheir size and their capital allow them to do so. Therefore, other banks tend to extend their\nlending with the increase in the exposure of the relationship lender. This tendency appears\nto be stronger if the relationship bank is a public sector bank rather than a commercial bank.\nOverall our study confirms hypotheses in Detragiache, Garella and Guiso (2000) and\nBris and Welch (2005) about the positive relationship between firm quality and creditor\nconcentration. Profitability of the relationship lender and the size of the other lenders also\nplay an important role. More theoretical and empirical work on creditor concentration\nseems warranted. As direction for further research the question of interest is whether firms\nadjust their creditor concentration in response to exogenous shocks. Bank mergers in the\nbanking industry can be considered as an exogenous shock for firms since after bank\nmergers the creditor concentration automatically deviates from its original level. Therefore,\nit will be interesting to investigate whether firms adjust their concentration after bank\nmergers towards its optimal level which depends on their firm specific characteristics.\nReferences\nAllen, F., E.

The number of observations is 7,699 firm-years. The first column reports the number of banks and the\nsecond column the share of firms having relations with that particular number of banks. The following\ncolumns report the share of loans taken by each bank ordered by size. Due to the reporting threshold in the\ncredit register, a considerable part of relationships cannot be observed in the sample. Panel A presents the\nrelationships observable in the credit register where the total share of loans is below 1. Panel B presents the\nstructure that is computed under the assumption that the unobserved part of the loans is concentrated in one\nbank with a maximum tolerable amount of 1.499 million Euros.

There are\ndifferent ways to handle bank mergers. We could exclude the banks that were involved in\nmergers, however, this procedure would lead to a considerable loss of information.\nAlternatively, we can consider the merged bank to be one institution during the entire time\nperiod. In this case, we need to aggregate the merging banks into one institution before the\nactual merger takes place. However, data breaks in this procedure are unavoidable since the\naggregated data before the merger and the data of the merged bank mostly do not\ncorrespond well.\nGiven the difficulties involved in the aforementioned approaches, we choose to separate\nthe pre-merger banks from the merged bank. In the end, we have three banks, which are\ntreated independently. We repeat this procedure as often as a merger takes place. Each time\na newly merged bank receives a new identification number, we drop the target banks in that\nyear (or quarter). Our procedure has obvious drawbacks if one uses dynamic panel\nestimation techniques.\nB Details on the Matching Process of Two Databases and Data Adjustments\nThe data in the credit register have been primarily gathered for regulatory purposes and\nsome double counting may occur. We eliminate those double-counted exposures from the\nsample. For example, we do not include borrower units since they report the sum of the\nexposures of the firms that belong to that unit.20 Moreover, actual exposures are double\ncounted when partners of civil-law associations with joint partnerships or with limited\npersonal liability (Gesellschaften des b\u00fcrgerlichen Rechts, GbR) are jointly accountable for\n20 The borrower unit consists of different borrower firms. The term is defined in \u00a719 (2) of the Banking Act.\nthe losses. In that case, the exposure of the GbR is reflected in the position of each partner\nwith the same amount or with the amount corresponding to the liability limit of each\npartner.21 We also exclude double-counted exposures reported in partners' shares.\nWe match the information on the firm exposures from the credit register with the\ninformation on the firm balance sheets from the Jalys/Ustan database. In order to carry out\nthe matching we use firm-specific information in the credit register and in the Jalys/Ustan.\nFirm identity, location, industry and legal form allow us to match conservatively. Both\ndatabases cover the entire time period available.22 We can identify 3,433 matches and,\nusing these matches, we merge the data from the credit register with the data from the\nJalys/Ustan. The data in the credit register are available on a quarterly basis, and the data\nfrom the Jalys/Ustan are available on a monthly basis where the balance sheet disclosure\noccurs once a year in a particular month of that year. The majority of the firms report their\nbalance sheets at the end of the year. To avoid the problem of time mismatches for firms\nthat have different balance sheet periods, we match the quarterly data from the credit\nregister with the last month of each quarter of firm data from the Jalys/Ustan.\nAdditionally, we make some data adjustments. We compute a coverage ratio between\nthe two databases and exclude observations with a coverage ratio above 120 percent.23 The\ncoverage ratio is calculated as follows:\nn\njt ijt jt\ni\nCoverage Ratio Loans Financial Firm Liabilities\n=\n= \u00a6 , (A1)\n21 For more detailed information on the civil-law associations and the liability limits, see Deutsche\n22 The data in the credit register are available for 1993 onwards and the data in the Jalys/Ustan from 1989\nonwards.\n23 The aim is to exclude the observations with a coverage ratio above 100 percent to eliminate data recording\nerrors. However, we choose a tolerance level of 120 percent and correct the data for the degree of\nasymmetry measure.\nwhere\njt jt jt\nFinancial Firm Liabilities Credits Bond\n= + . Table A1 provides an overview\nof the distribution of the coverage ratio.\nTable A1: Coverage Ratio\nCoverage\nRatio\nTable A2: Number of Firms in The Dataset With Data Adjustments\nDataset after correction for borrower units and GbR partners\nAfter correction for coverage ratio above 120 per cent\nTable A2 presents the distribution of the number of firms over the years in the sample\nincluding the process of data adjustment. The number of firms diminishes over time with\nthe introduction of the euro. Before the introduction of the euro, firms issuing commercial\nbills were required to report their balance sheets to the Deutsche Bundesbank since only\nfirms with a solid creditworthiness were allowed to issue these commercial bills. With the\nintroduction of the euro, commercial bills lost their importance as securities and the number\nof firms reporting to the Deutsche Bundesbank decreased commensurately.\nThe following Discussion Papers have been published since 2006:\nSeries 1: Economic Studies\novernight rate, the ECB's policy rate and the Dieter Nautz\nterm spread Christian J.
