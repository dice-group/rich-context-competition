    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis study investigates the role of the intracellular adenosine transporter equilibrative nucleoside transporter 3 (ENT3) in\nstimulated release of the gliotransmitter adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from astrocytes. Within the past 20 years, our\nunderstanding of the importance of astrocytic handling of adenosine, its phosphorylation to ATP, and release of astrocytic\nATP as an important transmitter has become greatly expanded. A recent demonstration that the mainly intracellular nucleo-\nside transporter ENT3 shows much higher expression in freshly isolated astrocytes than in a corresponding neuronal\npreparation leads to the suggestion that it was important for the synthesis of gliotransmitter ATP from adenosine. This\nwould be consistent with a previously noted delay in transmitter release of ATP in astrocytes but not in neurons. The present\nstudy has confirmed and quantitated stimulated ATP release in response to glutamate, adenosine, or an elevated K\u00fe con-\ncentration from well-differentiated astrocyte cultures, measured by a luciferin\u00adluciferase reaction. It showed that the\nstimulated ATP release was abolished by downregulation of ENT3 with small interfering RNA (siRNA), regardless of the\nstimulus. The concept that transmitter ATP in mature astrocytes is synthesized directly from adenosine prior to release is\nsupported by the postnatal development of the expression of the vesicular transporter SLC17A9 in astrocytes. In neurons,\nthis transporter carries ATP into synaptic vesicles, but in astrocytes, its expression is pronounced only in immature cells and\nshows a rapid decline during the first 3 postnatal weeks so that it has almost disappeared at the end of the third week in well-\ndifferentiated astrocytes, where its role has probably been taken over by ENT3.\n",

Adenosine is present in the extracellular space\nand can be accumulated through an equilibrative nucleo-\nside transporter (ENT) or concentrative (CNT) nucleo-\nside transporter (Li, Gu, Hertz, & Peng, 2013; Parkinson\net al., 2011). In cultured astrocytes (but not neurons), it is\npredominantly metabolized to adenosine monophosphate\n(AMP) by adenosine kinase, and further via adenosine\ndiphosphate (ADP) to ATP (Matz & Hertz, 1989). In\nadult brain, adenosine kinase is also almost selectively\nlocalized in astrocytes (Studer et al., 2006), with one of\nits two splice variant, the short form, in the cytosol\n(Boison, 2013). We have recently shown in cells freshly\nobtained from the mouse brain that mRNA for the\nmainly intracellular nucleoside transporter equilibrative\ndetermined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain\nreaction (RT-PCR), is greatly enriched in astrocytes\nwhen compared with neurons. ENT3 gene expression\nhas also previously been identified in freshly isolated\nastrocytes by microarray techniques (Cahoy et al., 2008;\nDoyle et al., 2008), and we have demonstrated its expres-\nsion in cultured astrocytes by RT-PCR (Li et al., 2013).\nThese observations lead to the suggestion that it might\ncarry adenosine to vesicles involved in the synthesis of\ntransmitter ATP, which in that case would be synthesized\nlocally (Li et al., 2013). To obtain further information\nwhether this might be the case, we have in the present\nstudy compared glutamate, adenosine, and K\u00fe effects on\nastrocyte cultures with downregulated ENT3 due to small\ninterfering RNA (siRNA) treatment with those in ENT-\nexpressing astrocytes that had been treated with the other\nreagents needed for downregulation with siRNA, but\nwithout the ENT3 siRNA itself and were regarded as\nnormal controls. In normal astrocyte cultures, each of\nthese stimuli cause a large increase in ATP release\n(Xu et al., 2014). Furthermore, as the vesicular trans-\nporter SLC17A9 which transports ATP itself into neur-\nonal synaptic vesicles (Larsson et al., 2012) has\nbeen demonstrated in cultured astrocytes of unknown\nage and differentiation (Oya et al., 2013), we have\nexamined the postnatal development of the expression\nof this transporter in our well-differentiated astrocyte\ncultures.\nMaterials and Methods\nReagents\nChemicals for the preparation of medium and most other\nchemicals, including adenosine (9 -b-D-ribofuranosylade-\nnine), glutamate (L-2-aminopentanedioic acid), and the\nbeta-gamma-dibromomethylene ATP), were purchased\nfrom Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA).\nDeoxyribonucleotide triphosphates were obtained from\nTaKaRa Biotechnology (Dalian, China). Opti-MEMI\nand Oligofectamine used for preparation of cells with\ndownregulated ENT3 due to treatment with siRNA\nagainst this transporter were purchased from Invitrogen\n(Carlsbad, CA, USA). Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa\nENLITEN ATP Assay System Bioluminescence\nDetection Kit was purchased from Promega (Madison,\nWI, USA). Primers for ENT3, SLC17A, and TATA box-\nbinding protein (TBP) were synthesized by Sangon Co.,\nLtd. (Shanghai, China).\nCell Culture\nPrimary cultures of astrocytes were prepared from the\nneopallia of the cerebral hemispheres as previously\ndescribed (Juurlink & Hertz, 1992) with minor modifica-\nDulbecco's Minimum Essential Medium (DMEM) with\n7.5 mM glucose (to allow some decline between feedings),\nthe 5.4 mM K\u00fe traditionally used in our cultures, and\n20% serum, which was gradually reduced to 10% after\nthe age of 1 week during the culturing period. After the\nage of 2 weeks, 0.25 mM dibutyryl cyclic AMP\n(dBcAMP) was included in the medium. Such cultures\nare highly enriched in astrocytes (>95% purity of glial\nfibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]) and glutamine synthe-\ntase-expressing astrocytes (Hertz, Juurlink, & Szuchet,\n1985). The addition of dBcAMP at this specific stage of\nculturing is a crucial component of our culture prepar-\nation. Thus, expression of many astrocytic genes known\nto exist in adult astrocytes in the brain, for example,\naralar (Lovatt et al., 2007), shows a large increase after\nit has been added to the culturing medium (Li, Hertz, &\nTreatment With ENT3 siRNA\nTo allow incorporation of siRNAs into astrocytes,\n3-week-old astrocyte cultures were incubated in\nDulbecco's medium without serum for 24 hr on the day\nbefore transfection. Transfection solution contained 2 ml\nof Oligofectamine, 40 ml of Opti-MEMI, and 2.5 ml of\nsiRNA (666 ng) and was added to the cultures for\n8 hr. Cultures treated in this manner are indicated as\nsiRNA(\u00fe). To control for possible effects of\nOligofectamine or Opti-MEMI, they were compared\nwith siRNA(\u00c0) control cultures, which had been treated\nwith transfection solution in a similar manner, but with-\nout siRNA addition. After this treatment, 87.5 ml of\nDMEM with 37.5 ml of serum was added to the cultures.\nThe expression of mRNA of ENT3 was measured by RT-\nPCR 3 days after transfection.\n2 ASN Neuro\nReverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction\nFor the determination of mRNA expression of ENT3 and\nSLC17A9 by RT-PCR of their mRNA expression, a cell\nsuspension was prepared by discarding the culture\nmedium, adding Trizol to cultures on ice and scraping\nthe cells off the culture dish. In our hands, the classical\nRT-PCR gives similar results as real-time RT-PCR, and\nthe results are more directly visible (Peng et al., 2013). The\nRNA pellet was precipitated with isopropyl alcohol,\nwashed with 75% ethyl alcohol, and dissolved in 10 ml\nsterile, distilled water, and an aliquot was used for deter-\nmination of the amount of RNA. One microgram of RNA\nextract was used for RT, which was initiated by 5-min\nincubation at 65C of RNA extract with Random\nHexamer at a final concentration of 12.5 ng/l and deoxyr-\nibonucleotide triphosphates at a final concentration of\n0.5 mM. The mixture was rapidly chilled on ice and briefly\nspun, and 4 ml of 5 \u00c2 First-Strand Buffer, 2 ml of 0.1 M\ndithiothreitol, and 1 ml of RNaseOUT Recombinant\nRNase Inhibitor (40 U/ml) were added. After the mixture\nSuperscript II was added, and the incubation at 42C con-\ntinued for another 50 min. Subsequently, the reaction was\ninactivated by heating to 70C for 15 min, and the mixture\nwas chilled and briefly centrifuged.\nPCR amplification was performed in a Robocycler\nthermocycler with 5 mg of complementary DNA, 0.2 mM\nof sense or antisense nucleotides, and 0.375 U of Taq poly-\nmerase (TaKaRa Biotechnology). The forward primer for\nits reverse primer was 50TCACTGGATGCTGCCA\nand its reverse primer was 50AAGGATCTCTCGCT\nkeeping gene, and its forward and reverse primers, respect-\nTCATAGCTACTGAACTG (El Marjou, Montalescot,\nBuzyn, & Geny, 2000). Initially, the template was dena-\ntured by heating to 94C for 2 min, followed by 35 ampli-\nEach cycle consisted of three periods, the first for 45 s at\nThe PCR products were separated by 1.5% agarose gel\nelectrophoresis and captured by FluorChem 5500 (Alpha\nInnotech, San Leandro, CA, USA). Ratios between\nscanned ENT3 mRNA or SLC17A9 and TBP were deter-\nmined and averaged.\nLuciferin\u00adLuciferase ATP Assay\nFor the determination of the extracellular ATP, a luci-\nferin\u00adluciferase assay (ENLITEN ATP Assay System\nBioluminescence Detection Kit, Promega) and a\nTECAN infinite M200 Microplate Analyzer (Lausanne,\nSwitzerland) were used to record relative light units\n(RLU) as described by Liu, Sabirov, and Okada (2008).\nAs previously described (Xu et al., 2014), the assay was\nperformed during 60 min in DMEM without serum or pH\nwas present in all experiments. Then, the medium was\nrapidly cooled to room temperature for the ATP assay\nand mixed with a 100 -ml aliquot of luciferin\u00adluciferase\nreagent dissolved in dilution buffer provided with the\nassay kit, and chemiluminescence values (RLU) were rec-\norded as an indication of ATP content. Even in the\nabsence of any known ATP, considerable relative high\nRLU readings were caused by the medium or tissue.\nThis appeared larger than the previously measured\n2014), perhaps reflecting some effects of the reagents\nother than siRNA itself with which the cells had been\ntreated.\nStatistics\nThe statistical values of the differences between individual\ngroups were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance\nfollowed by Fisher's least significant difference test. The\nlevel of significance was set at p < .05.\nResults\nFigure 1(a) shows blots of two experiments in which\nmRNA for the ENT3 gene was determined together\nwith mRNA for TATA-box protein, used as a house-\nkeeping gene. In both experiments, the determination\nwas made (a) in cultures that had undergone the whole\nprocedure required for ENT3 downregulation by siRNA\n3 days earlier [siRNA(\u00fe)] and (b) in cultures that had\nbeen exposed to the drugs used in association with\nsiRNA treatment (Opti-MEMI and Oligofectamine) but\nnot the siRNA itself [siRNA(\u00c0)]. The figure shows a mas-\nsive ENT3 downregulation in siRNA(\u00fe) cultures but not\nin the cultures where the siRNA was omitted during the\ntreatment. TBP is only slightly affected (siRNA(\u00c0) cul-\ntures). Figure 1(b) shows the scanned ratios between\nENT3 and TBP mRNA expression and confirms the\nvery considerable downregulation of the ENT3 gene by\nthe siRNA treatment.\nThe ENT3 downregulation did not affect ATP release\nunder control conditions (Figure 2), but it abolished the\nresponse to glutamate (Figure 2(A)), adenosine\n(Figure 2(B)), and 45 mM K\u00fe (Figure 2(C)). The control\nvalues in these cultures, where even the controls had been\ntreated with the other chemicals used during the siRNA\ntreatment, seemed larger than previously determined (Xu\net al., 2014), either reflecting larger unstimulated release\nSong et al. 3\nor a higher blank value, and the stimulatory effects were\nperhaps smaller. However, the conclusion that only the\ncultures that had not received siRNA responded to stimu-\nlation is not affected by these possible changes.\nA rapid developmental decrease in the expression of\nmRNA of the vesicular ATP transporter SLC17A9 which\nin neurons transports ATP into synaptic vesicle is shown\nin Figure 3. In very immature astrocytes, its expression is\npronounced, but in well-differentiated astrocytes, it has\nalmost disappeared at the time the adenosine kinase is\nknown to have shifted its expression from neurons to\nDiscussion\nThe previous demonstration of the much more pro-\nnounced expression of ENT3, the only mainly intracellu-\nlar nucleoside transporter (Baldwin et al., 2005), in\nastrocytes than in neurons (Li et al., 2013), leads to the\nhypothesis that the astrocytic release of transmitter ATP\nmay originate from a vesicular ATP pool generated in\nsitu from adenosine. This concept is supported by the\npresent finding that downregulation of ENT3 abolishes\nstimulated release of ATP. In contrast, neuronal trans-\nmitter release of ATP is dependent upon an intracellular\nATP transporter (Larsson et al., 2012). A similar trans-\nporter has recently been demonstrated in cultured astro-\ncytes of unknown age and in C-6 cells, an astrocytic\ntumor cell line (Oya et al., 2013). However, it was asso-\nciated only with lysosomes and not with other intracellu-\nlar organelles containing ATP. Moreover, the age and\ndifferentiation of the astrocytic cultures are important\nas reflected by the virtual disappearance of the expression\nof this transporter in 3-week-old well-differentiated cul-\ntures shown in Figure 3. Another relevant example of\ndifferences in poorly and well-differentiated astrocyte cul-\ntures is the high rate of adenosine phosphorylation\nreported by Matz and Hertz (1989) in cultures similar\nto those used in the present study, but not by\nParkinson, Ferguson, Zamzow, and Xiong (2006) in pre-\nsumably less differentiated cultures. It may, however,\nappear against the present conclusion of adenosine trans-\nport into vesicles and intravesicular formation of ATP\nthat Coco et al. (2003) in an article on astrocytes reported\nthat bafilomycin A1\n(an inhibitor of vacuolar type H\u00fe-\nATPase [V-ATPase] involved in vesicular uptake)\nimpaired ATP storage and release, but it should be\nTBP\nsiRNA(-) siRNA(-) siRNA(+)\nsiRNA(+)\nRatio of ENT3/TBP\nsiRNA(-) siRNA(-) siRNA(+)\nsiRNA(+)\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 1. mRNA expression of ENT3 in astrocyte cultures sup-\nposed to show downregulated ENT3 expression following treat-\nment for 3 days with transfection solution with siRNA against\nENT3 [siRNA(\u00fe)], compared with cells from the same culture\nbatch treated with transfection solution alone without siRNA\nagainst ENT3 [siRNA(\u00c0)]. mRNA expression was quantitated by\nRT-PCR as ratios between ENT3 and TBP, used as a housekeeping\ngene.

That\nmature astrocytes, in contrast to both neurons and chro-\nmaffin cells, are unable to use ATP imported by\nSLC17A9 for stimulated release is in support of their\nuse of ENT3 for uptake of adenosine which is subse-\nquently converted to ATP in the vesicles.

(2007) and\nSummary\nGlutamate, adenosine, or high K\u00fe stimulation of release\nof gliotransmitter ATP is abolished by downregulation of\nadenosine transporter ENT3, probably due to the inhib-\nition of adenosine uptake in vesicles.\nAuthor Contributions\nLH designed experiments.
