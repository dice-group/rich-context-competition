This claim as to 80% of data produc-\ntions being spatial in nature however predates the Big\nData present; it was first made by Antenucci in 1989.\nTo say that data is and has always already been spatial\nis therefore neither novel nor original. What, then, is it\nthat is being made actual in spatial Big Data? This is\nthe subject of the papers assembled here. This special\ntheme arose from a series of sessions on ``Spatial Big\nData and Everyday Life'' organized at the Association\nof American Geographers (AAG) annual conference in\nChicago in 2015. There were two questions which moti-\nvated us: what difference does it make to conceptualize\na specifically spatial Big Data as opposed to Big Data\nper se; and second, how does spatial Big Data play out,\nand with what effects, at the level of the everyday? Each\nof the papers advances unique responses to these ques-\ntions, approaching spatial Big Data through multiple\nepistemological and theoretical lenses that offer up\ndiverse interpretations of the spatiality of Big Data\nand its everydayness.\nAs a colloquial designator, ``everyday'' has connota-\ntions of ordinary, quotidian, and frequent. As articu-\nlated by Taylor et al. (2014), data has become entirely\nordinary and expected presences in the spaces and prac-\ntices of everyday life. Certainly, data has always been\nproduced in places, by actors--both human and other\nthan human--occupying those spaces. Many Big Data\nproductions and attendant analytics regimes have their\nprecursors in identifiably spatial/geographical ante-\ncedents. For example, location-based advertising, pre-\nmised on the aggregation of individual spatial histories,\nreal-time locations, and past consumptive behaviors,\nemerged from geodemographic information systems\n(GDIS), which coupled geodemographic analytics to\ninterfaces of geographic information systems (Dalton\nand Thatcher, 2015). GDIS' themselves grew out\nof what Bouk (2015) refers to as ``massifying'' data\npractices of the 20th century, particularly those of\nmass marketing. Yet the ``routine, taken-for granted''\npresence of geocoded and geolocatable content (data)\n1University of Auckland, New Zealand\n2University of Kentucky, USA\nCorresponding author:\nAgnieszka Leszczynski, School of Environment, University of Auckland,\nEmail: agnieszka.leszczynski@auckland.ac.nz\nBig Data & Society\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.com/journalsPermissions.nav\nbds.sagepub.com\nCreative Commons Non Commercial CC-BY-NC: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-\nNonCommercial 3.0 License (http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/) which permits non-commercial use, reproduction\nand distribution of the work without further permission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages\n(https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).\n``in homes, neighborhoods and communities'' (Dyck,\ncall ``the street''--is entirely unprecedented by previous\nsocio-technical geographic information technology\nassemblages, genres of techno-cultural productions, or\npraxes. From the scale of the city (Graham, 2013) to\nthat of the street (Taylor et al., 2014) and increasingly\nreaching into the intimate spaces of the home\n(Speed and Luger, 2014), our physical, emotional, and\nimagined landscapes, as well as our experiences of these\nspaces, are constituted, augmented, and mediated by\nOur understanding of the spatial everyday is accord-\ningly further informed by Berlant's (2011) observation\nthat the present is not an object, but a ``mediated\naffect.'' Importantly for Berlant, the everyday is also\na series of ways of addressing anxieties, not as crises\nthat create radical breaks, but as intensifications of\nalready existing situations, what she calls ``crisis ordin-\nariness,'' wherein: ``[c]risis is not exceptional to history\nof consciousness but [is] a process embedded in the\nordinary that unfolds in stories about navigating\nwhat's overwhelming'' (10).\nIn this sense, we advance spatial Big Data as an\nintensification of two related anxieties: (i) anxieties\naround data itself (what we term ``data anxieties''),\nand (ii) anxieties latent in subjective individuation and\nthe governance of subjects.\nEveryday anxieties\nThe rise of spatial Big Data is intimately bound up with\ntwinned anxieties around data: that of data being insuf-\nficient for tasks at hand, while simultaneously being\nover-sufficient). Kate Crawford (2014) discusses this\nin terms of the double fear of not being abstracted\ninto data flows and consequently being ``left out'' of\nalgorithmic socio-spatial sorting praxes which increas-\ningly structure access to life opportunities, and that\nassociated with the consequences of actually being\nabstracted into and algorithmically reassembled\nacross data flows in ways that are overly revealing of\nthe personal details of our most intimate selves. The\npublic disclosures of the extensive data-driven surveil-\nlance practices of the securities agencies--many of\nwhich involve the capture, interception, and aggrega-\ntion of specifically locational information about individ-\nuals--have engendered societal ``anxieties of control''\nwhereby individuals wish to direct and maintain the\nintegrity of flows of their personal locational data at\nthe level of devices, applications, and platforms, but\noverwhelmingly feel that any attempts to do so are\neffectively futile (Leszczynski, 2015a).\nAt the same time, Big Data, spatial and otherwise, is\nimplicated within new modes of subject formation and\nsubjectivity that allow for nascent data practices of\nassembling and disassembling subjects, as well as tar-\ngeting individuals within data-driven practices of sur-\nveillance (Tufekci, 2014) and location-based advertising\n(Dalton and Thatcher, 2015). Accordingly, a second\ncircuit of intensification may be identified around the\ntargeting and governance of subjects. Building on\nFoucault (2008), spatial Big Data it is created ``at the\ninterface of governors and governed . . . an element of\ntransactional reality in the history of governmental\ntechnologies, a transactional reality which seems\nto . . . be absolutely correlative to the form of govern-\nmental technology we call liberalism'' (297).\nSubjects come to be individuated as data such that\nthey may be governed in new ways through individual\nmodes of subjective targeting (Amoore, 2011), but not\ngoverned too much such that data effects forms of\n``soft'' rather than overt control (see Sadowski and\nPasquale, 2015). Importantly, the data of govern-\nance--behaviors, negotiations, tactics, deals, computa-\ntions, interactions with subjects and other lively\nobjects--is transactions (of behavior, negotiation, com-\nputation, interaction, etc.) rather than simply attributes\nat locations (geotags). Spatial Big Data is a representa-\ntional solution to capturing these interactions for a wide\nvariety of purposes in a (neo)liberal market, through\nthe capture of subjects and subjectivities as derivatives\nand data doubles (Amoore, 2011) that allow for new\nmodes of highly targeted and individualized geosurveil-\nlance practices. Its biggest challenge may be in entering\nprecisely that sphere of the ``thinking-feeling'' subject\nrather than just the ``signifying-subjectifying'' one\nIn other words, there is an anxiety around spatial\nBig Data being able to cope with affects, which neces-\nsitate an expansion of the limited interpretation of the\n``spatial'' in spatial Big Data' as geographical referents\n(coordinates, metadata, address, content) that may be\nattached to data events, or which are somehow intrinsic\nto data productions and flows (Crampton et al., 2013;\nShelton, 2016). The papers that comprise this special\ntheme do so by going not only ``beyond the geotag,''\nbut also beyond the narrow engagement of easily avail-\nable social media content as a source of spatial Big\nData for analysis, mapping, methodological innov-\nation, and theoretical engagement.\nBeyond the geotag, beyond\nsocial media data\nWe do not mean to suggest that the now pervasive\ngeocoding of content is not significant. Indeed, it\nimportantly constitutes new sources of data previously\nunavailable for the identification and analysis of vari-\nous kinds of socio-spatial processes, such as daytime\n2 Big Data & Society\nracial segregation in American cities (Shelton et al.,\n2015). Nevertheless, a fixation on ``the geotag'' engen-\nders a fetishization of data that is mapped or mappable,\nbetraying an implicit commitment to a spatial ontology\nunderwritten by a ``Cartesian ideal of space as divorced\nfrom social relations'' that engenders an ``over-privile-\ng[ing of] the single latitude/longitude coordinate pair''\nundergird falsely universal claims about the world\nand the people who inhabit it drawn on the basis of\nwhat is non-representative data generated piecemeal by\nindividuals who represent both selective and self-\nselecting populations. Given that small percentages of\nindividuals in any one country are Twitter users, and\nonly 1% of Tweets are natively geocoded, geocoded\nTweets are not, for example, valid or meaningful\nproxies of global mobility patterns, contra for example\nHawelka et al. (2014). Elsewhere, animated ectoplasm\nmaps of trending topics on Twitter--such as those men-\ntioning racialized police brutality culminating in police\nshooting of Michael Brown and subsequent organized\nactivities in Ferguson, MI--promote an understanding\nof these events as ``novel and fleeting'' rather than as\nthe gradual outcomes of social inequalities and disaf-\nfections rooted in the historical legacies and historical\ngeographies of racial segregation and Jim Crow in the\nerously argue, we must accordingly go ``beyond the\ngeotag'' and attendant ``burger cartographies''1 by\nbeing attuned to and accounting for the social,\npolitical, economic, and cultural contexts of spatial\nBig Data production, circulation, capture, assembly,\nanalysis, and visualization (see also boyd and\nheuristic that may serve as a framework for a nuanced\nengagement of geocoded social media content. They\nencourage scholars and researchers to ``go beyond'' (i)\nthe ``x,y'' of data that is natively spatial, by, for exam-\nple, identifying locations of retweets; (ii) the spatialities\nof the present, by examining the space\u00adtimes of data\ndiffusion; (iii) the proximate, by being attuned to the\nrelationalities of data productions and flows; (iv) the\nhuman, by including content generated by the other\nthan human, namely bots; and (v) user-generated\ndata, by contextualizing, reading, and analyzing these\nproductions against ancillary data sources (such as\ncensus data). Shelton (2016) expounds on this by advo-\ncating for a relational approach to geotagged social\nmedia data. At the most basic level, this does not\ninvolve changing the way that such data is mapped\n(represented) per se but instead emphasizes how geo-\ncoded spatial media content is collected and filtered by,\nfor example, normalizing the selection of tweets relating\nto a particular topic by tweet density (all Twitter activ-\nity). More complex methodologies are available, such\nas calculating the confidence interval of an odds ratio,\nwhich give greater weight to locations characterized by\nheightened levels of Twitter activity which also experi-\nence greater relative degrees of tweeting about a par-\nticular topic (for examples of this approach, see\nWhile these entreaties for going ``beyond the geotag''\nprovide robust methodological imperatives for\ntranscending superficial fetishization of locational\ncoordinate pairs, they themselves nevertheless over-\nemphasize (geocoded) social media data. In the same\nways that ``the geotag'' represents a limited facet of\nsocial content, geocoded social media data is likewise\nan instance of, but not sufficient for, the assemblage of\ndata productions, presences, and practices that consti-\ntute and fall within the rubric of ``spatial Big Data.'' In\nconvening this special theme on spatial Big Data, we\nstrive to go beyond not only the geotag, but also the\nfixation on social media content. The contributions\nbrought together here do precisely this by engaging\nand interpreting the spatiality of (spatial) Big Data in\nnuanced through variegated ways.\nThatcher calls for attention to be given to the sub-\njects producing spatial Big Data through quotidian\nengagements with location-aware and -enabled mobile\ndevices as an object of research and scholarly attention.\nAs he rightly argues, too often emphasis has been given\nto the content productions themselves (e.g., natively\ngeocoded Tweets) rather than the subjectivities and\nsubject positionalities of the individuals actively (and\nat other times passively) generating spatial Big Data.\nThis importantly signals imperatives for research\nwhich, because they are methodologically and empiric-\nally far more challenging to address, remain open: how\nare individuals contending and reconciling with the rea-\nlities of living in a (spatial) Big Data present? (Couldry\nunpack the nature of the ``experience of Big Data''\n(Crawford, 2014) demands engagement with subjects\nand subjectivities as of course there is no such thing\nas universal experience; all experience is contingent on\nsubject positionality. African-American communities,\nfor instance, have long been subject to extensive\nregimes and practices of historical dataveillance that\nhave reified and shaped material subjectivities and\neveryday lives along racial lines (Browne, 2015).\nIt is precisely to this question of what data mean to\nordinary people on the street that Wilmott speaks to in\nher ethnography of embodied spatial experiences of\nlocative media in the historical and geographical con-\ntexts of Sydney and Hong Kong. She presents multiple\nnarratives that capture the ways in which Big Data is\nnot only something that is located in space (has a\nLeszczynski and Crampton 3\nspatiality or geography), but something that simultan-\neously actively locates. The quotidian experience of\nspatial Big Data is thus always one of being located;\nor, alternatively, of the anxieties of not being located or\nof being unable to locate oneself in space, of intimately\nexperiencing one's subjective erasure from the map-\nbased interface, as recounted by an Aborigine interview\nsubject in Sydney who identified the instrumentalist\nrepresentation of space to be incongruous with\nAborigine identity, claims to, senses of, and experiences\nof place. The subjective experience of being located is\nfurthermore often one that is incomplete, an incom-\npleteness that is rendered acute when spatial Big Data\nfails to accurately or effectively situate the subject in\nspace.\nBig Data, in other words, is neither total nor totali-\nzing--it is, as per Straube, not a ``singular formation.''\nStraube resists the reducibility of complex Big Data\ninfrastructures to a monolithic phenomenon or entity\nthrough the model of the stack by tracing the ``spatial\nlife'' of the version control system Git. As defined by\nStraube, the stack is ``a natively technical framework to\nthink conceptually about the various layers of proto-\ncols, code, and data formats involves in the functioning\nof'' digital networked data infrastructures. It provides a\nmeans for unpacking the ways in which data infrastruc-\ntures are defined by and implicate particular spatialities\n(as well as temporalities), which Straube approaches\nthrough the introduction of the concept of ``topology,''\nor hierarchical relationships between layered ``stacks''\nin the infrastructure. This captures the ways in which\nprotocols are layered over top of each other in the\nstack, for example, such that rendering a web page\n(retrieving and reifying data) is made possible by verti-\ncally translating between complementary, hierarchically\nlinked (and in the case of internet protocols, independ-\nent) components of software in particular sequence or\norder.\nBig Data infrastructures enact their own spatialities,\nbut they are simultaneously inflected by the geograph-\nical specificities of the sociocultural contexts of their\nproduction. In his contribution, Cockayne examines\nthe ways in which the valuing of social media data is\ninformed by the spatial exceptionalism of California's\nSilicon Valley/Bay Area startup culture, in which early\nstage technology firms (startups) compete social capital\n(users, adoption) as a basis for securing economic cap-\nital in an attention economy. He argues that in addition\nto functioning as systems for accumulation (venture\ninvestment, profit), social media platforms and attend-\nant data productions simultaneously function as sys-\ntems for securing, appropriating, and circulating user\nattention: adoption of platforms, generation of ``likes,''\nretweets, Instagram comments. This affective value is\nclosely related to economic value, wherein\nmonetization of platforms through advertising/promo-\ntion or monetary windfalls to startup founders through\nbuyouts/acquisitions is dependent on active and numer-\nous membership and user base.\nEmphasizing economic value over affective value,\nAlvarez Leo\n\u00b4 n examines the ways in which spatial Big\nData--or geoinformation--is being progressively\nintimately incorporated into the digital economy\nthrough the rubric of ``property regimes,'' which he\nuses to describe the ways in which actors are working\nto stake ownership claims over spatial content as a\nmeans of extracting value (profit) from these data pro-\nductions. Using the example of Google Street View,\nAlvarez Leon demonstrates the ways in which the inte-\ngration of Street View imagery and perspectivalism into\nthe broader Google search product through the transfer\nand appropriation of rights to and from users (use of\nAPI keys; capture of their presence on the street) con-\nstitutes perhaps the ``most thorough and expansive\ncommodification of geographic information ever\nattempted.'' The exchange of personal data (capture\nof one's presence on the street in Street View imagery)\nfor the utility value of the interface (fine resolution spa-\ntial data at the level of the street; precise navigational\nfunctionality) implicates precisely the twin anxieties of\nspatial data (insufficient; overly sufficient) described\nabove.\nConclusion\nHere, we have advanced an engagement with spatial\nBig Data beyond the geotag and beyond content pro-\nductions sourced from social media platforms by bring-\ning together a series of interventions that take up and\ninterpret the ``spatial'' in spatial Big Data in variegated\nand nuanced ways, approaching phenomena of spatial\nBig Data and their everydayness via different epistemo-\nlogical and methodological approaches. As a quotidian,\npervasive presence in the spaces and practices of every-\nday life, Big Data is both located, and something that\nlocates. Infrastructures, for instance, extend their own\nspatialities (as well as temporalities; Straube). The com-\nmodification of geographic information is both a\nresponse to and simultaneously fuels neoliberal polit-\nical economic imperatives and the anxieties of monetiz-\ning and generating profit from networked platforms\nand services.\nThe everyday experience of data is increasingly one\nof being located in space; or at times, it is one of con-\nspicuously not being located and of experiencing and\ncontending with the anxieties of the failure of the\nincompleteness of Big Data that arise in instances\nwhere one cannot be placed (or actively place oneself)\nin space (Wilmott). Data is inflected by and bears the\ntraces of the geographical specificities and neoliberal\n4 Big Data & Society\neffects of the sites of their production, in ways\nthat implicate new modes of governing subjects, and\nthe modes by which subjects govern themselves\n(Cockayne, 2016). In other words, these very Big\nData productions are intimately bound up with subject-\nivity and subject formation (Thatcher) and the twinned\nanxieties of spatial Big Data (not enough, and too\nmuch data; individuated subjectivities which engender\nnew modes of data-driven governance, but not too\nmuch governance).\n"
