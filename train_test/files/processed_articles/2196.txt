The percentage of overweight\nchildren age 6\u00ad11 has more than doubled and the percentage of\noverweight adolescents age 12\u00ad19 has more than tripled since late\nadolescents ages 12 to 19 were overweight or at risk for overweight [2].\nSince the dramatic increase in average weight and obesity has\noccurred in genetically stable populations, the weight gains can be\nattributed to environmental factors related to calorie intake and/or\nphysical activity. Indeed, poor dietary choices and health behaviors\nsuch as skipping breakfast, a diet low in fruits and vegetables, eating at\nfast food restaurants and consuming calorie-dense snacks, all of which\nare associated with a risk of abnormal weight-gain and adiposity\namong children and adolescents, have been on the rise [3\u00ad6].\nChildren's consumption of calories from fast food is estimated to\nbreakfast consumption by children ages 8 to 10 and adolescents\ndeclined by 9% and 13%, respectively [8]. Furthermore, while the\naverage size of a snack and the caloric energy per snack have\nfrequency of snacking among children increased significantly [9].\nIn light of evidence that sedentary behaviors such as watching\nTV/video are associated with obesity [10\u00ad13], researchers have\nargued that the lack of opportunity to engage in physical activity in\nschools and the growing availability of more sedentary alternatives\nas opposed to traditional sports-related leisure pursuits may have\ncontributed to the rising prevalence of overweight among children\nand adolescents. While surveys of adolescents, beginning in the\n1990s, have suggested little or no decrease in the level of physical\nexercise across those cohorts and a relatively stable level of\nsedentary activities [14\u00ad16], the long-term trends in how\nadolescents use time and their level of physical activity is unclear\nbecause of the lack of comparable data.\nSocial interactions may also have contributed to the rapid rise in\nobesity [17,18]. Although it is difficult to talk about causality, a\nnumber of observational studies have used data on the social\nnetworks of adults to document a positive correlation between\nadults' weight and the average weight of their peers [18]. Several\nstudies reached similar results in terms of adolescents' weight and\nthe weight of their peers [19\u00ad22]. However, the nature of the social\ninteractions that cause the apparent spread of obesity in social\nnetworks is not well understood. Burke and Heiland [17] considered\nthe possibility of interactions on weight through social weight norms\nand showed how an increase in the reference group's average\nweight can result in additional calorie consumption and weight gain.\nIndividuals' lifestyle choices may also be directly influenced by peer\nbehavior. For example, as regular exercise and sports become more\npopular in an individual's social network, the chances that the\nindividual also engages in these pastimes increases, perhaps because\nof interest stimulated by the peer involvement in this activity or\nsocial pressures to conform to the group behavior.\nIn addition to the evidence supporting social interaction on\nweight, peer influences have been found in various health-related\nbehaviors, ranging from smoking [23,24], alcohol use [25], other\nhealth risky behaviors [26,27], to health care utilization and\npreventative care [28]. To date, much of the attention to the social\ntransmission of weight-related behaviors among children and\nadolescents has been on eating disorders [29\u00ad31]. A notable\nexception is the study by Fletcher [32], who analyzed peer effects\non adolescents' time spent watching TV.\nHowever, estimates of the relationship between social networks\nand health behaviors have been viewed with skepticism, largely from\nthe failure to address the issues of peer selection and environmental\nconfounders [19,20,27]. Peer selection implies that the correlation in\nbehavior could be attributed to the similarity among individuals,\nwhereas peer influence implies that the correlation is due to the peer\nbehavior itself. Disentangling the peer influence from spurious\nunobserved factors associated with peer selection is important if we\nare to accurately estimate the relationship between the behaviors of\nthe individual and that of their peers. Thus, if there are common\nunderlying attributes of individuals within a peer group that drive\nbehavior more than peer influence itself, policies aimed at taking\nadvantage of peer influence may not realize the desired effects\ndisagreement in the literature as to how to adjust for peer selection\nand choice of the methodology to account for this in most cases is\ndriven by the data set that is being utilized in the study [27]. We\nelaborate further on this point in the Statistical Analyses section when\nwe discuss our attempt to account for peer selection.\nEnvironmental confounders, on the other hand, refer to factors\nthat might be common to all adolescents living in the same\nenvironment, or community-specific factors influencing the\noutcome of all individuals in the same reference group. These\neffects, when unmeasured, can lead us to incorrectly attribute\nsocial network effects in individual outcomes when none might\nexist. For example, a higher concentration of fast-food restaurants\nor scare public recreational facilities in a neighborhood could\nsimultaneously affect the eating pattern or exercise habits of all\nindividuals in networks within the community. Thus, caution\nshould be exercised in attributing causality to correlations in\noutcomes between friends when environmental confounders are\nnot adequately accounted for.\nThe present research provides a comprehensive investigation of\nthe relationship between peer and individual weight-related\nbehaviors among adolescents. We consider seven previously un-\nexamined behaviors related to physical activity and diet (energy\nexpenditure and intake): regular physical exercise, participation in\na sport, eating breakfast, eating at fast food restaurants, consuming\nfive servings of fruits/vegetable daily, calorie-dense snacking, and\nsix or fewer hours of nightly sleep. In addition, we analyze whether\nthere are interaction effects in TV viewing in networks of close\nfriends, which complements Fletcher's [32] study of TV viewing\nbehavior among schoolmates. The current study builds on\nprevious research supporting peer effects related to obesity in\ngeneral by looking at specific behaviors that may be responsible for\nthe spread of obesity in social networks. We hypothesize that\nbehaviors that are easily observable by other adolescents are better\ncandidates for peer interaction effects. Hence, individual sleep\nhabits and breakfast consumption, which are not directly\nobservable by peers, should be less likely to be influenced by the\nrespective peer behaviors than participation in sports, exercise, or\neating at fast food restaurants, which are activities that directly\nbenefit from peer participation.\nMaterials and Methods\nData Source\nThe data for this study are drawn from the National Longitudinal\nSurvey of Adolescent Health (henceforth ``Add Health''). Add\nHealth surveyed adolescents in grades 7 to 12 in 132 schools\nnationwide in the U.S. Beginning with an in-school questionnaire\nadministered to a nationally representative sample of students in\na series of in-home interviews of respondents approximately one\nA unique feature of Add Health is that the first two waves\ntions of their closest friends. Since these friends were also surveyed,\npeer measures of weight-related behaviors can be constructed from\nactual responses. We also employ parental information from the\nparent questionnaire administered in the in-home survey in the\nfirst wave. (A full description of the sample design, data and\ndocumentation is available at www.cpc.unc.edu/addhealth.)\nThe samples in this study are drawn primarily from the wave II\nnominated friend. Where possible, we link data from the first and\nsecond wave of the in-home survey (not all respondents were\ninterviewed in both waves, and some nominated friends were not\nsurveyed).Our analysis is based on samples of 3,898 adolescents\nand their peers. The average number of nominated friends per\nindividual is 2.54, and approximately 85% of the friends are from\nthe same school as the respondent. Detailed summary statistics on\nadolescent and peer weight-related behaviors for our analysis are\nin Table 1, while Table 2 reports the corresponding descriptive\nstatistics for the control variables. The measures that we\nadolescents interviewed in 1996 are noted in the tables.\nMeasures\nDependent Variables. We consider eight weight-related\nbehaviors: (i) Exercise \u00ad a binary variable indicating whether the\nrespondent reported exercising three or more times during the past\nseven days; (ii) Sports \u00ad a binary variable indicating whether the\nindividual reported playing an active sport such as baseball, softball,\nsoccer, swimming or football; (iii) Hours of television/video viewing\n- the weekly hours of television viewing, including watching videos\nand playing video games; (iv) Sleep six hours or less \u00ad a binary\nvariable indicating whether the individual usually gets six or fewer\nhours of nightly sleep; (v) Breakfast \u00ad a binary variable indicating\nwhether the individual usually eats breakfast on weekday mornings;\n(vi) Fast food \u00ad the number of days in the past week the adolescent\nate in a fast food restaurant such as McDonald's, Taco Bell, or KFC;\n(vii) Five Servings of Fruits or Vegetables \u00ad a binary variable\nindicating whether the adolescent had at least five servings of fruits\nor vegetables the previous day; (viii) Calorie-dense Snack \u00ad a binary\nvariable indicating whether the adolescent consumed calorie-dense\nsnacks (doughnuts, sweet rolls, muffins, pastries, cookies, brownies/\npie, etc.) the previous day.\nWeight-Related Behavior among Adolescents\nIndependent Variables. The members of a social network\nare identified based on the set of close friends nominated by the\nrespondent. For each adolescent we constructed measures of the\npercentages of his or her friends who exercise, play sports, get six or\nfewer hours of sleep, and regularly have breakfast, and measures of\ntheir average reported hours of television viewing and average\nnumber of days of eating in a fast food restaurant. We examine the\nrobustness of the link between peer and individual behaviors to\nvarious controls, including demographic characteristics of the\nindividual (age, gender, education and race) and whether the\nadolescent had been taught about the problems related to being\noverweight or underweight in school. In addition, using the data\nfrom the parent survey, we employed controls for a number of\nparental characteristics, including whether the adolescent lives with\nboth biological parents, the parents' level of education, whether\nboth parents work full time, family income, whether the parents\nchose their residence because of the school district and how old the\nadolescent was when they first moved into the district. Other\nparental measures considered are whether the parent plays an active\nsport (in the exercise and sport models), whether the parent allows\nthe adolescent to decide how much television to watch (in the hours\nof television model), whether the parent allows the adolescent to\ndecide when to go to bed (in the sleep model), and whether the\nparent allows the adolescent to decide what to eat (in the eating\nbehaviors models). Hereafter, we refer to the latter indicators as\nparental weight-related activities. Finally, we use information on\nindividuals' current and past BMIs, along with the current and past\naverage BMIs of the peer group. We also estimated our models with\nBMI percentiles and BMI z-scores and the results were consistent\nwith the ones reported here. We report the results with BMI to be\nconsistent with the previous literature and to make our results\ncomparable to them [18].\nEthics Statement\nWe are registered and approved users of the Add Health\ndataset. As a part of the process for acquiring the data we\nunderwent IRB review and received approval from the Institu-\ntional Review Board of the University of Toledo (2007). We are in\nno way using human or animal subjects directly (we are analyzing\npre-existing data), thus written consent was not necessary. We\nhave successfully completed our training on human subjects\nresearch review as well as HIPAA.\nStatistical Analyses\nWe estimate linear regression and probit models for adolescents'\nweight-related behaviors. In our most comprehensive model, the\npropensity to participate in weight-related behaviors by individual\ni in school s during time t, is given by\nYist\n\nY\nYjst\nXist\nWist\nz\n\nW\nWjst\n\nW\nzcs\nzeist\nwhere Yist and \nY\nYjst refer to the individual's participation in\nweight-related activities and peer group outcomes, respectively,\nmeasured in 1996.

We\nmeasure the role of peer influence on the individual's weight-\nrelated behaviors, b1\nby estimating relatively parsimonious models\nand then consider models with an increasingly large set of controls\nto assess the robustness of the estimated peer effects.\nIdentifying social network effects in observational data is not\nwithout its challenges. First, there is the concern about confounding\nresulting from non-random selection of friends. Second, unobserved\ncharacteristics in the shared environment that affect all individuals in\nthe social network may also cause environmental confounding.\nThese confounding factors, if unaccounted for, can cause correla-\ntions suggestive of social network effects when none are present. We\naddress this problem by estimating models that control for a large set\nof individual- and family-level factors, as well as school-level fixed\neffects, which capture unobserved characteristics common to\nadolescents from the same school and any other unmeasured\nschool-specific influences. For example, schools will differ in the\nproximity to fast food restaurants, a well documented determinant of\nstudents' poor nutrition and overweight [33], as well as in the\navailability of vending machines, meal plans, and opportunities to\nexpend energy (built environment, exercise facilities, etc.).\nIn addition to models with standard individual- and family-level\ncontrols (demographics, parents' education, etc.), we estimate models\nthat control for individuals' and their peers' current (1996) and\nprevious (1994) BMIs in order to control for the selection of friends\nbased on weight status [18,19,34]. Peer BMI may proxy for the\ngroup's weight norm [17] and directly influence adolescents' exercise\nand food choices. We also utilize data on whether the family moved\nrecently and whether the neighborhood was selected for the school\ndistrict. Accounting for parental location preferences may further\nreduce the bias from non-random selection of friends [22,27].\nAs mentioned earlier, there is no consensus in the literature as to\nthe most appropriate methodology to account for non-random\npeer selection. Some studies have argued for using a measure of\nsocial network at a more exogenous level, such as the\nneighborhood or school level [27]. However, a problem with this\napproach is that social networks at such aggregated levels might\nnot be relevant, i.e., these might not be the networks that influence\nindividual behaviors [27]. Another suggested approach is to\naccount for parental location preferences along with school-level\nfixed effects and controls for certain outcomes that might be\ndriving the selection [18,27]. For example, in the obesity and peer\neffects literature [18], individuals and their peers' lagged and\ncontemporaneous body weights have been used to account for\npeer selection that might be driven by body weights. In another\nliterature that focuses on risky health behaviors among adolescents\nsuch as drinking and drug use [27], peer selection was accounted\nfor by controlling for parental location preferences and school-\nlevel fixed effects. The rationale is that for adolescents it is\nprimarily the parents' location decision that determines with\nwhom their children associate. To the extent that this is true,\nunobserved environmental confounders and factors that might\ndrive residential location preferences can account for peer\nselection.\nOur empirical strategy is a combination of these approaches.\nSpecifically, we include individual and their peers' BMI to account\nfor peer selection based on body weight, while acknowledging that\nbody weight is not the only factor driving friendship selection. In\naddition, our controls for school-level fixed effects and parental\nlocation preferences attempt to account for that possibility that\nparents' location decisions affect peer selection.\nResults\nThe estimates of the peer effects from various models without\nschool-level fixed effects are shown in Table 3, and the estimates\nwith school-level fixed effects are reported in Table 4. For the\nbinary outcomes, we report marginal effects estimated from probit\nmodels at the mean values of the independent variables. The hours\nof television viewing and the number of days eating in a fast food\nrestaurant are treated as continuous variables, and the corre-\nsponding estimates are based on linear regression models.\nColumn 1 of Table 3 presents estimates from our baseline\nmodel, which controls only for the adolescents' demographics.\nComparison of the results from the baseline model to models that\ncontrol for individual- and family-level factors allows us to\ninvestigate the robustness of the estimated network effects. In\nparticular, the model in column 2 also controls for parental\ncharacteristics (including parental education and income and\nwhether the individual lives with both biological parents). In\ncolumn 3, a measure for whether the adolescent was taught about\nthe problems related to being overweight or underweight in school\nis added, together with other parental measures, including whether\nthe current residential location was chosen because of the school\ndistrict, how old the respondent was when he/she moved to the\ncurrent location, and indicators for parental activities. The model\nin column 4 adds the individuals' own lagged BMIs, and models in\ncolumns 5\u00ad7 also include peers' lagged BMIs, peers' contempo-\nraneous BMIs and individuals' own contemporaneous BMIs. We\nreport only the estimated peer effects in Tables 3 and 4, and we\nreport the full sets of estimates based on the most comprehensive\nmodels (column 7) in Tables 5 and 6. (The estimates from models\nwithout school-level fixed effects are in Table 5, and the estimates\nfrom models with school-level fixed effects are in Table 6.)\nThe estimates from the baseline model, which includes only peer\nand demographic variables (see column 1 of Table 3), suggest that\nhaving friends who are more engaged in weight-related behaviors is\nassociated with an increase in individuals' participation in these\nactivities. This result holds for all weight-related behaviors except\nfor sleeping six or fewer hours. The effects are sizeable across\nbehaviors, with peer influence having the greatest effect on\nparticipation in a sport and eating at fast food restaurants. After\nfamily-level information is added, the estimates in columns 2 and 3\ndecrease in magnitude slightly. The greatest change in the\nmagnitudes occurs in model 5, where we add peers' lagged BMIs\nto account for the selection of friends. The estimated coefficients\nchange little after peers' contemporaneous BMIs and individuals'\nown contemporaneous BMIs are included in columns 6 and 7,\nrespectively. In the most comprehensive model in Table 3\n(column 7), we find positive and statistically significant associations\nfor all behaviors except for getting six or fewer hours of sleep.\nThe fact that the estimates of the peer influence change in\nmagnitude across different model specifications is consistent with\nthe idea that there are confounding factors that can bias the effect\nof peers on individuals' behaviors. However, we cannot rule out\nthat even the most comprehensive model in Table 3, model 7,\noverstates the peer effects because of other confounding factors for\nwhich we do not account. In an attempt to minimize the bias\nfurther, we re-estimate all models in Table 3 with school-level\nfixed effects. The corresponding estimates in Table 4 suggest that\nonly exercise, sports, and eating at fast food restaurants have\nconsistently positive and significant social network effects after\naccounting for unmeasured school-specific influences. The esti-\nmated effects in Table 4 are smaller than those in Table 3,\nsuggesting that the unmeasured heterogeneity across schools\nintroduces upward bias in the peer effects estimates.\nWeight-Related Behavior among Adolescents\nThe results from our most comprehensive model, Model 7, in\nTable 4 suggest that, on average, a 10 percentage points increase\nin the proportion of friends who exercise is associated with a 0.79\npercentage points (p = 0.025) greater likelihood that the individual\nexercises. The effect of a same-size increase in the proportion of\nfriends who participate in an active sport is a 1.84 percent points\n(p,0.001) greater likelihood that the individual participates in an\nactive sport. A one-day increase in the average number of\nweekdays friends eat at fast food restaurants is associated with a\nin a fast food restaurant. The estimated peer effects associated with\nthese three activities change little across specifications, as shown in\nTable 4. We find no evidence that hours of TV viewing, sleeping\nsix or fewer hours, eating breakfast, eating five servings of fruits/\nTable 4.

It is also\nimportant to note that the weight-related behaviors were not\nsignificantly associated with the BMI (Table 6); this could\npotentially be due to unobserved heterogeneity (e.g. genetic\ncorrelated.\nAs a further robustness check of our estimates we performed a\nsensitivity analysis by restricting the sample to only those with\nTable 5.

Utilizing a longitudinal research\ndesign and a representative sample from the Add Health, we\nexamine the influence of peer behaviors on adolescents'\nengagement in eight weight-related behaviors. We find significant\npeer effects for pursuing an active sport, regular exercise, and the\nfrequency of eating in fast food restaurants, suggesting that an\nindividual is more likely to engage in these behaviors if his or her\nfriends do.\nWe find no consistent evidence in support of peer effects on TV\nviewing, sleeping six or less hours, or on eating breakfast, calorie-\ndense snacks, or five servings of fruits and vegetables. Adolescents\nengage in these activities primarily in their parents' homes, which\nlimits both the extent to which these behaviors are self-directed by\nthe adolescent as well as how observable they are to friends; this is\nespecially true for hours of sleep and breakfast consumption. In\naddition, we find that the association between friends' average TV\nviewing and that of the individual declines considerably and\nbecomes statistically insignificant after accounting for unobserved\nfactors at the school level. A similar result is obtained for unhealthy\nsnack food consumption, another activity where peer influences\nare plausible. Our findings for TV viewing complement Fletcher\n[32], who documented a sizable association between school-level\nand individual-level TV viewing. We find weaker and statistically\ninsignificant associations after accounting for school-level unob-\nserved heterogeneity. While the estimates are not directly\ncomparable across studies since we use close friends as reference\ngroup rather than all schoolmates, our results cast doubt on the\npresence of peer effects on TV viewing.\nOur study contributes to the emerging literature on the\npotential mechanisms by which obesity may spread within social\nnetworks [17\u00ad22]. It also has significant implications for\nunderstanding the influence of person-specific behaviors that are\nrelated to obesity in adolescence, a time when individuals become\nvulnerable to weight gain and peer influence. Determining the\nweight-related behaviors most salient to peer influence has direct\npolicy implications by suggesting the behaviors within social\nnetworks that should be the focus of interventions.\nOur findings indicate that any policy intervention that alters the\nweight-related behavior of an individual who is embedded in a\nsocial network might also have an indirect effect on the behavior of\nuntreated adolescents who are in the same social network [35]. It\nmay be fruitful to complement traditional weight reduction\ninterventions with strategies that focus on harnessing peer support\nto modify behaviors and, especially among adolescents, strategies\nthat target norms regarding sports, exercise, and eating fast food.\nGiven that these behavioral norms will tend to differ across groups,\nthe effectiveness of an intervention will likely be enhanced by\ntaking into account the particular peer environment. By reducing\ncalories from fast food and increasing physical activity levels\namong adolescents, such interventions may help reverse current\ntrends in adolescent obesity. Finally, the findings of our study are\nconsistent with the idea that changing physical activity and food\nnorms has contributed to the spread of obesity. However, this\nconsistency does not rule out weight norms as additional channel\n[17,18]. Also, to the extent that these results reflect peer selection,\n(i.e. the observed associations might themselves be a product of\npeer selection) they might be of limited use as policy levers aimed\nat encouraging healthy body weights.\nSeveral limitations of our research warrant elaboration. Even\nafter accounting for common unobserved influences at the school\nlevel, the relationships that we found to be significant may be\ndriven in part by the correlated effects within smaller groups. This\nis a concern since the individual selects his or her friends, who will\ntend to be similar to the individual. Although we utilize both\nlagged and contemporaneous measure of body weight along with\nschool-level fixed effects and parental location preferences, it is\nlikely that selection could be conditioned on other unobserved\ncharacteristics, such as degree of risk aversion. If common\nattributes and environmental factors that influence adolescents'\nweight-related behaviors are not captured by our individual- and\nfamily-level controls or by the school-level fixed effects, the\nestimates presented here may overstate the influence of friend\nnetworks. In that regard, future studies should investigate further\nhow friendship ties are formed. For example, future research could\nexamine whether friendship ties are more likely to form between\nindividuals with similar observable traits after controlling for\ndemographics and environmental confounders [36]. On a similar\nnote it might also be worthwhile to examine whether the spread of\none behavior in social networks (e.g. fast-food consumption) might\ninfluence the spread of another (e.g. unhealthy snacking). This\nwould be similar to the Mednick et al. [37] study which found that\nthe spread of sleep patterns in social networks also have an impact\non marijuana consumption in the social networks. In addition,\nfuture study should look into whether peer effects in obesity\noperate via pathways other than the ones examined here, for\nexample, economic insecurity [38]. Another potential limitation of\nthe current study is our reliance on self-reported behaviors.\nHowever, to the extent that the measurement error in the peer\ngroup activities is classical, the estimated magnitudes of the peer\neffects will be conservative.\n"
