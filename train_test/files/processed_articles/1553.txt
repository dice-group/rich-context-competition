Whether these new therapies have had demonstrable impact on mortality on a\npopulation-wide scale has not been evaluated. This study describes the age-specific and\nsex-specific mortality rates from PBC and PSC in the United States between 1980 and 1998,\nbased on the Multiple Cause of Death files. Age-specific and sex- specific mortality rates from\nPBC and PSC were calculated. The multivariable Poisson model was used to evaluate\ntemporal changes in mortality rates. In 1998, the total age-adjusted and sex-adjusted PBC-\nmortality significantly decreased over time in women younger than 65 years, and in men of\nall age groups, whereas in older women this number increased over time. PSC-related\nmortality remained essentially stable, except in men 65 years of age or older. Conclusion:\nSince the early 1980s, significant changes in mortality from PBC have occurred. The most\nnoticeable change was an increase in the age of death, which indicates prolongation of\nsurvival. These changes may be attributable to liver transplantation or ursodeoxycholic acid.\nIn contrast, mortality from PSC remained largely unchanged, highlighting the need for more\nPrimary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) and primary scleros-\ning cholangitis (PSC) are chronic cholestatic disor-\nders of the liver. PBC is characterized histologically\nby portal inflammation and immune-mediated destruc-\ntion of the intrahepatic bile ducts and serologically by the\npresence of antimitochondrial antibodies.1 PSC is charac-\nterized by progressive destruction of intrahepatic and ex-\ntrahepatic bile ducts.2\nPBC is a disease that affects primarily women, in a 9:1\nratio. The median age of diagnosis is 50 years (range,\nUnited States, Kim et al.4 reported an incidence of PBC of\nthat there would be 47,000 prevalent cases of PBC in the\nUS white population and that approximately 3,500 new\ncases would be diagnosed each year.4 The overall median\nsurvival ranges between 10 and 15 years, with disease\nprogression being more likely in patients with symptom-\natic disease, even though asymptomatic patients still have\na lower overall median survival compared with an age-\nmatched and sex-matched healthy population.1,3 In a\nstudy by Prince et al.,5 only one-third of the deaths in\nasymptomatic patients with PBC were liver related. Sev-\neral reports demonstrate an increased risk of hepatocellu-\nlar carcinoma in patients with PBC; however, the crude\nfrequency of hepatocellular carcinoma is still low at 0.7%\nAlthough the incidence of PBC in the United States\nhas not changed for the past 20 years,4 at least 2 therapeu-\ntic modalities have been shown to be effective in treating\npatients with PBC. These include orthotopic liver trans-\nplantation (OLT) and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA).\nLiver transplantation, shown to improve survival of pa-\ntients with end-stage liver disease from PBC,9 has been\nused widely in PBC patients since the mid-1980s.

However, such impact on PBC-related mortal-\nity has not been evaluated on a population-wide scale.\nPSC affects men more commonly than women, and\nthe median age of diagnosis is approximately 40 years.\nThe median survival is 12 years from diagnosis. Its asso-\nciation with inflammatory bowel disease is well known.2\nIn a US population-based study, the estimated overall\nage-adjusted and sex- adjusted incidence of PSC was 0.90\nmen and 6.3 women). In this study, the estimated 10-year\nsurvival of patients with PSC was 65%, compared with an\nexpected survival of 94%.12 Cholangiocarcinoma is the\nmost feared complication and occurs in 7%-15% of pa-\ntients with PSC, with an annual incidence of 0.5% to 1%.\nLiver transplantation has achieved overall excellent\noutcomes, including long-term survival and improve-\nment in quality of life in patients with advanced PSC.13\nHowever, PSC tends to recur in the allograft, which\nsometimes leads to graft failure, retransplantation, or\ndeath.14 Furthermore, no medical treatment has been\nshown effective in slowing disease progression or time to\nliver transplantation in patients with PSC.15 In practice,\nhowever, UDCA may be being used off label, although its\nefficacy in patients with PSC has not been demonstrat-\nIn this study, we used detailed death certificate data to\ndescribe the age-specific mortality rates from PBC and\nPSC in the United States between the years of 1980 and\n1998 and to evaluate their time trends. The comparison\nbetween PBC and PSC provides helpful insight into the\nimpact of advances in therapy for these diseases over time.\nPatients and Methods\nData Source. Data on mortality were obtained from\nthe Multiple Cause of Death files, which comprise all\ndeath certificates issued in the United States (approxi-\nmately 2 million annually). Data on all calendar years\nCenter for Health Statistics (Hyattsville, MD). Available\ndata elements included age (in 5-year increments), sex,\nrace (white, African, and other), and place of birth and\ndeath, and all listed (immediate, contributing, and under-\nlying) causes of death on the death certificate.\nbecause the diagnostic coding system used for the data was\nconsistent during the period; the coding system was\nchanged to the International Classification of Diseases\nCase Ascertainment. The Multiple Causes of Death\nfiles used the International Classification of Diseases 9th\nversion (ICD-9) for diagnostic coding. Death records\nwith a PBC diagnosis was identified with the code 5716\n(biliary cirrhosis), whereas the code 5761 (sclerosing\ncholangitis) was used for PSC deaths. We considered a\ndeath PBC-related or PSC-related if either diagnosis was\nlisted as the \"underlying\" or \"immediate\" cause of death\nor \"underlying/immediate\" cause of death was cirrhosis,\nportal hypertension and its complications (esophageal\nvarices, ascites, hepatorenal syndrome, hepatic coma),\nhepatocellular carcinoma/cholangiocarcinoma, acute\nliver failure, or unspecified disorder of liver, and PBC or\nPSC was also listed as a contributing cause of death.\nRecords in which PBC or PSC was listed but the imme-\ndiate or underlying cause of death was not liver related\nwere thought to represent deaths in which PBC or PSC\nwas incidental and did not contribute to the death.\nData Analysis. Data from the Multiple Cause of\nDeath file were analyzed using SAS version 8.2 (SAS In-\nstitute Inc., Cary, NC). Mortality rates, namely incidence\nrates of deaths, attributable to PBC or PSC were calcu-\nlated, considering the entire population of the United\nStates to be at risk. Denominator age-specific, sex-spe-\ncific, and race-specific person-years were based on the\n2000 census. For the estimation of data variability, we\nassumed that, given a fixed number of person-years, the\nnumber of cases would follow a Poisson distribution,\nwhich allowed the estimation of standard errors and the\ncalculation of 95% confidence intervals for the mortality\nrates. Because there were only a small number of dece-\ndents of nonwhite race, all races were combined in the\nestimation of mortality rates and subsequent analyses.\nAlso, only those deaths in which the age was 20 years or\nolder were included in the analysis.\nThe impact of age, sex, and calendar year was examined\nusing the generalized linear model assuming a Poisson\nerror structure. In the Poisson analysis modeling, both\nPBC-related death and PSC-related death, the natural log\nof the national population for a given age/sex combina-\ntion was used as an offset. Thus, all models are age-ad-\njusted and sex-adjusted to the national population.\nInteractions among these variables were examined to de-\nfine whether there were differences in the temporal trend\nin incidence rates of PBC-related and PSC-related death\nacross sex.\nResults\nof potential PBC-related deaths were found in the Multi-\ndefinition of PBC-related death and were included in the\nAmericans accounted for 4.5%; others, which included\nAsian, Pacific Islander, Native American, and Alaskan, for\nA total of 23,985 records of potential PSC-related\ndeaths were found in the Multiple Cause of Death file,\ndeath and were included in the analysis.

PBC mortality in\nmen did not show a consistent pattern, in part because of\nthe fewer number of deaths. Figure 2 displays the same\ninformation for PSC mortality. Mortality attributable to\nPSC also increased with age. There did not seem to be any\nlongitudinal pattern to PSC mortality in men or women.\nTrend in mortality is further analyzed in Figs. 3 and 4,\nwhich show mortality rates by calendar year.

In men 40 to 64\nyears of age, the PBC death rate decreased from 0.1 per\nrates also decreased in men of the other age groups.\nWith regard to PSC, Fig. 4 shows that the death rate in\nmen older than 65 years of age decreased over time from\nmen of the other age groups, PSC mortality did not\nchange over time. In women, there was no discernible\ntrend in PSC mortality.\nThese findings were formally examined in Poisson re-\ngression models, shown in Tables 2 (PBC) and 3 (PSC).\nThe mortality rate ratio (MRR) calculation showed that\nPBC mortality in women increased with age. For exam-\nple, PBC mortality in women older than 65 years was\nMRR  0.024). With regard to a time trend, in women\nolder than 65 years of age, each decade in calendar year\nwas associated with a 29% increase in PBC mortality,\nwhereas in younger women, the mortality rate decreased\nby approximately half (MRR  0.53). In men, as in\nwomen, PBC mortality increased with age. PBC mortal-\nity in men showed a significant reduction over time, re-\ngardless of their age, although the decrease was more\nMortality attributable to PSC also increased signifi-\ncantly with age in both men and women. Overall, there\nwas much less noticeable calendar year effect in PSC mor-\ntality. The model did show that the PSC mortality de-\ncreased significantly in women between 40 and 64 years of\nage and men older than 65 years. However, the effect size\nDiscussion\nSeveral epidemiological factors may contribute to\nchanges in mortality rates of a given disease. First, if the\ndisease incidence changes, morbidity and mortality sec-\nondary to the disease will be affected accordingly. In the\ncase of PBC and PSC, there is no firm evidence that their\nincidence has changed over time.4,12 Second, if there is a\nshift in disease severity affecting the case fatality rate, mor-\ntality rates in the population may change, even if the\nincidence remains the same. Third, similarly, if there is\neffective treatment that alters survival of patients, it may\nalter mortality rates. In the case of cholestatic liver dis-\neases, therapeutic modalities that may have affected mor-\ntality rates on the population level include liver\ntransplantation and UDCA.\nLiver transplantation has been widely used since the\nmid-1980s, and it has been shown to be an effective treat-\nment for end-stage liver disease caused by both PBC and\nPSC, with excellent outcomes reported. Survival after\nliver transplantation for PBC are on the order of 85%-\nand for PSC, reported 1-year and 5-year survival rates are\nUDCA has been shown in randomized controlled tri-\nals to delay disease progression and to improve survival\nfree of liver transplantation in patients with PBC, espe-\ncially for those started on treatment while early-stage dis-\nstudied for the treatment of PSC; however, no effect on\ndelaying disease progression or the need for liver trans-\nplantation has been shown,25 and further studies are on-\nFig. 2.

The mortality\nchange observed in the mid-1980s is probably attribut-\nable to the more widespread use of liver transplantation.\nThe stronger effect noted in younger women may be ex-\nplained by the fact that younger patients are more likely to\nundergo liver transplantation. One may speculate that the\nincreased mortality observed in older women could rep-\nresent an effect of UDCA on delaying disease progression;\nhowever, because disease progresses at an older age, these\npatients may be less likely to benefit from liver transplan-\ntation. However, UDCA's effect might be more readily\ndetermined in a future study that looks at similar rates in\nthe decade after its approval and more widespread use\nInterpretation of data on PSC is more difficult than\nthat for PBC. In spite of the significant P-values in the\nPoisson models, inspection of Figs. 3 and 4 shows that the\ncurves for PSC are largely flat over time. The less pro-\nnounced time trend on PSC-related mortality may repre-\nsent the lack of medical treatment that is able to impact on\ndisease progression. Another possible explanation is the\nfact that the death certificate data for sclerosing cholangi-\ntis include an unknown proportion of non-PSC cases.\nPotential scenarios of secondary sclerosing cholangitis\nthat may be included in the data are cases of bile duct\ncomplications after surgery of the gallbladder or bile ducts\nand those of cholangiocarcinoma occurring in non-PSC\npatients. Because of the rapid adoption of laparoscopic\nFig. 3. Time trend in PBC-related mortality. PBC, primary biliary cirrhosis.\nFig. 4. Time trend in PSC-related mortality. PSC, primary sclerosing cholangitis.\nan increased incidence of secondary sclerosing cholangi-\ntis, which may in part explain the high proportion of\nPSC-related deaths in women, not in keeping with the\nmale preponderance of the disease. Mortality from those\npatients may have obscured a reduction in mortality in\npatients with PSC, for example, secondary to OLT. Con-\nversely, cholangiocarcinoma occurring in older patients\nwithout PSC may have been erroneously classified as PSC\nin the past, which may occur less frequently as diagnostic\naccuracy improves over time. This may have produced a\ntrend in the reduction of mortality in the older age group.\nOne may note a noticeable discrepancy between the\nestimated number of incident cases (for example, 3,500\nnew PBC cases per year among white Americans4) versus\nthe number of deaths reported here (for example, 470\nPBC deaths per year on average). There may be several\nexplanations for this gap between the incidence and mor-\ntality for PBC and PSC. First, there are patients with\nasymptomatic disease that remains undiagnosed at the\ntime of death. The frequency with which this occurs may\nnot be estimated based on currently available data. Sec-\nond, it is well known that even patients with symptomatic\nPBC do not die of liver-related causes. According to\nPrince et al.,5 31% and 57% of deaths in PBC patients are\nliver related in asymptomatic and symptomatic patients,\n(67%) in subjects with a PBC diagnosis were determined\nto be liver related. Clearly, not all patients with PBC die of\nit, and death certificates of decedents who had PBC but\ndid not die of it may lack the PBC diagnosis. Third, the\nOlmsted County population from which the estimates for\nPBC and PSC incidence was derived was predominantly\nof Scandinavian descent, the geographic area with the\nhighest reported incidence of PBC.26 Finally, the death\ncertificate data entail inaccuracies, and relevant deaths\nmay have been omitted or misclassified.27 As pointed out\nearlier, this bias is likely greater for PSC deaths. In sum-\nmary, the impression that the death rate for PBC/PSC\nappears to be only a fraction of their estimated incidence\nis likely a result of several factors, including lack of diag-\nnosis, deaths of causes unrelated to their liver disease, and\ngeographic heterogeneity of the US population. It is likely\nthat there is some underestimation in our data (that is,\ndeath certificate diagnosis) of the true mortality of liver-\nrelated causes with diagnosed PBC and PSC. The magni-\ntude of this underestimation remains unknown, and it\nrepresents the main limitation of this study. However, it\nmust be pointed out that the main focus of the study is the\ntime trend in mortality, not necessarily the absolute num-\nber of deaths. Thus, as long as this underestimation re-\nmains consistent over time, we believe that our\nobservation about the trend is valid.\nThe trend in the population-wide outcome of PBC\nand PSC observed in this study was recently corroborated\nTable 2.

First,\nsimilar to our observation, there was a statistically signif-\nicant decrease in the number of patients wait-listed for\nPBC over time, whereas no such trend was seen with PSC.\nSecond, the average number of patients wait-listed for\nyear, respectively. These numbers are similar to the num-\nber of deaths observed in this study, which indicate that\nour death certificate data are unlikely to be inaccurate by\na large measure.\nIn conclusion, over a nearly 2-decade period, signifi-\ncant changes in mortality were observed, the most pro-\nnounced of which was the decreased mortality observed in\nyounger women (65 years old) with PBC. We postulate\nthat these trends are attributable to advances in the treat-\nment of cholestatic liver diseases with the advent of OLT\nand UDCA for the treatment of PBC. In contrast, the\nincreased mortality in older women with PBC points to\nthe fact that those treatment modalities are not curative.\nMortality trends in PSC in general are less discernible,\nwhich may indicate lack of effective treatment options for\npatients with PSC.\nReferences\n1.
