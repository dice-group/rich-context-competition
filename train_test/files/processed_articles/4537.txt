In\nlow-flow anaesthesia, the alveolar concen-\ntration of inhaled anaesthetics changes very\nslowly; therefore, after their administration\nis terminated, their concentration decreases\nonly gradually. The consumption of inhaled\nanaesthetics could theoretically be reduced\nby stopping their administration at a calcu-\nlated point before the end of the surgery,\nwith the patient remaining under anaesthe-\nsia. The aim of the present study was to\ninvestigate the emergence time after the\ntermination of desflurane using different\nfresh gas flow rates.\nPatients and methods\nPatients\nPatients aged 18\u00ad64 years and classified as\nAmerican Society of Anesthesiologists class\nI or II, scheduled to undergo elective surgery\nunder general anaesthesia using desflurane\nin the Department of Anaesthesia and Pain\nMedicine, Hanyang University School\nHospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea,\nrecruited to the study. Exclusion criteria\nincluded cardiovascular disease with a left\nventricular ejection fraction of <40%, sur-\ngery time of >5 h, pregnancy or lactation,\ntonsillectomy, nasal surgery, dental surgery,\nsurgery in a prone or lateral position, heart\nsurgery and lung surgery.\nThe methods and aims of the study were\nexplained to the patients, all of whom\nprovided written informed consent. The\nstudy protocol was approved by the\nInstitutional Review Board of Hanyang\nUniversity Seoul Hospital (approval\na public trial registry at the Clinical\nResearch Information Service (http://cris.\nGeneral anaesthesia conditions\nAll patients fasted and did not take any\nanalgesics or sedatives for 12 h before sur-\ngery. In the operating room, the patient's\nvital signs were monitored using electrocar-\ndiography, a noninvasive blood pressure\nmonitor and pulse oximetry. The patient's\nlevel of consciousness was monitored using a\nbispectral index (BIS) sensor attached to the\nforehead and connected to a BIS monitor\n(2000A, Aspect Medical Systems, Norwood,\nAnaesthesia was induced by an intraven-\nous injection of propofol (1.5 mg/kg), fol-\nlowed by rocuronium (0.6 mg/kg) to\nfacilitate intubation and remifentanil\n(0.25 mg/kg) as an analgesic. During the\noperation, anaesthesia was maintained with\ndesflurane in oxygen (inspiratory fraction 0.5\nat a flow rate of 2 l/min) in the presence of\nremifentanil, using a Dra\n\u00a8 ger Cato anaes-\nthetic machine (Dra\n\u00a8 ger, Lubeck, Germany).\nDesflurane administration was maintained to\ngive an end-tidal concentration of 5\u00ad6 vol%\nuntil termination of inhaled anaesthesia.\nThe infusion of remifentanil was adjusted\nfor eachpatient during the operation, depend-\ning on their vital signs and BIS values.\nEmergence conditions\nApproximately 20 min before the termin-\nation of desflurane administration, pyri-\ndostigmine and glycopyrrolate were\nadministered to reverse muscle relaxation,\nindicated by a train of four !90% (mea-\nsured using MiniStim\u00d5, Life-Tech, TX,\nUSA). Remifentanil was maintained at\n0.05 mg/kg per min until the patient gained\nconsciousness and responded to verbal com-\nmands. Desflurane administration was ter-\nminated at the end of the surgery.\nPatients were randomly assigned, using a\ncomputerized randomization program, to\nreceive fresh gas flow rates of 100%\noxygen after discontinuation of desflurane\nof 2 l/min (group D2), 4 l/min (group D4) or\n6 l/min (group D6). One anaesthetist woke\nthe patients after surgery, while a second\nanaesthetist simultaneously recorded all\nemergence-related data.\nIf no spontaneous ventilation was\nobserved at the termination of desflurane\nadministration, the ventilator was switched\nto synchronised intermittent mandatory\nventilation mode. If spontaneous ventilation\nwas present, manually assisted ventilation\nwas performed, keeping pace with the spon-\ntaneous ventilation. The partial pressure of\nend-tidal carbon dioxide was maintained at\nwas provided until the patient opened their\neyes or moved. Once the patient had\nresponded to a verbal command, the admin-\nistration of remifentanil was terminated.\nDeep breathing with 100% oxygen\n(6 l/min) was then administered to patients\nin all three groups. After suction of the\nendotracheal secretions, the endotracheal\ntube was removed. The patient was moni-\ntored for excessive agitation during emer-\ngence and recovery (for up to 60 min),\nindicated by an inability to communicate\nor the need for medication or restraints due\nto overexcitement.\nMonitoring during emergence\nPatients were asked to open their eyes 3 min\nand 6 min after the termination of desflurane\nand every 1 min after that. The time to eye\nopening, time to spontaneous movement\nand time to extubation (emergence time)\nwere recorded. The end-tidal desflurane\nconcentration and BIS were also recorded\nat each of these time points. From the end of\ndesflurane administration until the endotra-\ncheal tube was removed, mean arterial\npressure and heart rate were recorded\nevery 3 min, then at 1 min after extubation.\nThe patient's memory of the surgery was\ntested by verbal questioning 30 min after\ntransfer to a recovery room and then 24 h\nafter surgery.\nStatistical analyses\nIn a pilot study of 35 patients (unpublished\ndata), times to extubation were 17.4 \u00c6\ngroups D2, D4 and D6, respectively; extuba-\ntion times were significantly longer in group\n(P \u00bc 0.025), but there was no significant\ndifference between groups D4 and D6. In\norder to detect a 1-min difference between the\ngroups at a 5% level of significance and 80%\npower, at least 33 patients would be required\nin each group. To allow for dropouts, a\ngroup size of 35 patients was chosen.\nData were reported as either the\nmean \u00c6 SD or n. Fisher's exact test was\nused to analyse differences according to sex.\nThe three groups were compared via one-\nway analysis of variance followed by a post-\nhoc Dunnett's test for multiple comparisons.\nPearson's correlation analysis was per-\nformed to assess relationships between the\ndemographic variables and emergence time\n(time to extubation). A P-value <0.05 was\nconsidered to be statistically significant. All\nstatistical analysis were performed using\nSAS software version 9.2 (SAS Institute,\nCary, NC, USA).\nResults\nA total of 105 patients were included in the\nstudy, with 35 in each of the three groups.\nThere were no significant differences\nbetween the groups in terms of sex, age,\nheight, weight, body mass index, duration of\nsurgery or duration of anaesthesia (Table 1).\nTime to eye opening, time to spontaneous\nmovement and time to extubation were\nsignificantly longer in group D2 than\n(Table 2).

These results suggest that it is possible\nto predict emergence time based on fresh gas\nflow rate following desflurane anaesthesia.\nAs expected, the time to extubation\nincreased with decreasing fresh gas flow\nrate; with a low gas flow rate the proportion\nof inhaled anaesthetic in the patient's body\nand the anaesthetic circuit that is discharged\nthrough the vacuum pump system is small\nduring emergence, and the patient's\nrebreathing rate will be increased. As a\nresult, the anaesthetic concentration will\ndecline very gradually. Therefore, if desflur-\nane administration is terminated at a pre-\ndetermined time before the end of surgery, a\nlow-flow rate can be continued until\nemergence.\nContrary to expectations, there were no\nstatistically significant differences in time to\neye opening, time to spontaneous movement\nor time to extubation between groups D4\nand D6. Likewise, no significant difference\nwas detected between end-tidal desflurane\nconcentrations measured at these times\n(except at time to spontaneous movement).\nThis could be because fresh gas flow rates of\n4 l/min or above matched the minute venti-\nlation very closely, such that little or no gas\nwas reused in the system.11 Therefore, it is\nlikely that a rate of 4 l/min is sufficient to\nwake patients. As oxygen and anaesthetic\ngases are expensive, increasing the flow rate\nto more than 5 l/min may not be economical,\nespecially if it is unlikely to improve\noutcomes.\nIn group D2, the end-tidal desflurane\nconcentration was significantly higher than\nthat of the other groups at eye opening,\nspontaneous movement and extubation.\nBecause the BIS values did not differ between\nthe low-flow group and the other treatment\ngroups, inadequate emergence did not seem\nto occur. All the end-tidal desflurane con-\ncentrations were lower at these timepoints\nthan the minimum alveolar concentrations\nat which an anaesthetized patient responds\nappropriately to spoken commands reported\nby Song et al.12 and Chortkoff et al.13 This is\nlikely to be due to the effect of remifentanil,\nas opioids can reduce minimum alveolar\nconcentration values via interaction with\nBecause the administration of inhaled\nanaesthetic should be terminated early in\nclinical applications, there was concern\nabout whether patients would be more\naware than would usually be expected.\nHowever, none of the patients reported\nhaving any memory of the surgery.\nAs the anaesthetic concentration\ndecreased slowly in the low-flow group\nduring emergence, the difference in concen-\ntration between the brain and the lungs was\nsmall. Because the rates of emergence agita-\ntion, and of increased mean arterial pressure\nand heart rate, are likely to be lower than in\nTable 5. Pearson correlation analysis between\ntime to extubation and other variables following\ndesflurane anaesthesia (n \u00bc 105).\nParameter Coefficient\nStatistical\nsignificance\nNS, not statistically significant (P ! 0.05).\nhigh-flow groups, a more stable and smooth\nemergence was originally expected in the\nlow-flow group. However, in the present\nstudy there was no particular advantage in\nterms of emergence agitation, mean arterial\npressure or heart rate in the low-flow group,\npossibly because remifentanil was also used.\nIn the present study, body weight and the\nassociated characteristic of body mass index\nwere both significantly correlated with time\nto extubation, whereas age, sex and height\nwere not. However, since patients aged\n! 65 years were excluded from the study,\nthese results cannot be generalised to those\nin this age group.\nThe lowest fresh gas flow rate used in the\npresent study was 2 l/min. However, it may\nbe necessary to study emergence at even\nlower flow rates. The results of the present\nstudy allow prediction of the emergence time\nwith fresh gas flow rates of 2, 4 or 6 l/min, a\nmean end-tidal desflurane concentration of\n5.4 vol% at the termination of desflurane\nadministration for an approximately 3-h\nsurgical procedure using desflurane and\nremifentanil. Many factors can affect the\nrecovery pattern.17\u00ad22 The rate of recovery is\nfaster with desflurane anaesthesia than with\nsevoflurane, and is faster with sevoflurane\nanaesthesia than with isoflurane.\nFurthermore, it is also delayed with a pro-\nlonged operation time, lower fresh gas flow\nrate and higher fraction of inhalation anaes-\nthetic. Thus, adjustments will be required\naccording to the individual situation. The\ndevelopment of devices for automatically\ncontrolling the end-tidal inhalation anaes-\nthetic concentration has allowed the main-\ntenance of the targeted end-tidal volatile\nanaesthetic concentration at a low fresh gas\nflow with small amounts of inhalation\nanaesthetic.23,24 If this strategy is used\nduring the emergence period, patients can\nbe awakened more comfortably and cost\neffectively, compared with other strategies.\nThe findings of the present study failed to\nclarify the economic benefits of a rate of 2 l/\nmin during emergence. While the economic\nbenefits of low flow rates have been reported\npreviously,1,2,4,6 they are extremely difficult\nto estimate during the emergence phase\nalone. Using the computer simulation pro-\ngram Gas Man\u00d5 version 4.2 (http://\nwww.gasmanweb.com/software.html), with\na low fresh gas flow of 2 l/min during surgery\nand emergence and an end-tidal desflurane\nconcentration of 5.4 vol% (patient body\nweight 60 kg), about 1 l of desflurane can\nbe saved compared with a high flow rate of\n6 l/min, giving a cost saving of $1.6 at a\nanaesthesia is maintained at 4 l/min, about\n1.9 l of delivered desflurane can be saved,\nresulting in a cost saving of $3.2. The savings\nin terms of cost and volume of inhalation\nagent used are small, and the cost of anaes-\nthesia is much lower than the cost of\nsurgery, suggesting that, if only emergence\nwas considered, the economic benefits\nwould be minor. However, even if the\neconomic benefit in each individual patient\nis small, the cumulative savings could be\nlarge.\nIn conclusion, it is possible to use a low-\nflow technique during the emergence period\nas well as the maintenance period without\ndelaying recovery if the inhaled anaesthetic\nis stopped at a predicted time before the end\nof surgery. This may help to reduce anaes-\nthetic consumption, with potential global\nenvironmental and economic benefits.\nFurther clinical trials to investigate low-\nflow rates during emergence are warranted.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial, or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
