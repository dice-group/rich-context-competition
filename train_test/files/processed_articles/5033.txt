Participants\nreceived a \"toolkit\" containing six self-care tools. Trained lay self-care \"coaches\" negotiated a contact schedule of up to\nweekly contacts. Study outcomes were levels of completion of the self-care tool and the coach contacts at the 2-month\nfollow-up. Coaches reported the number of completed contacts. In all, 57 of 63 participants completed the 2-month follow-\nup. Of these, 67% completed at least 1 tool; the mean number of coach contacts was 5.7 (SD = 2.4) of a possible 9 contacts\n(63% adherence). Higher disease comorbidity and lower initial depression severity independently predicted better tool\nadherence. Findings suggest that people with chronic physical illnesses can achieve acceptable levels of adherence to a\ndepression self-care intervention similar to those reported for other populations.\n",

Among people\nwith depression, the presence of a chronic physical illness is\nassociated with an increased duration of depressive episodes\nity and work absences (Stein, Cox, Afifi, Belik, & Sareen,\n2006), functional decline (Schmitz, Wang, Malla, & Lesage,\n2011), increased use of health care services (Himelhoch,\nUn\u00fctzer et al., 1997), greater disease morbidity (Saz &\nLow intensity psychosocial interventions, rather than\nmedications, are recommended for adults with a non-severe\ndepression and comorbid chronic physical illness (National\nCollaborating Center for Mental Health, 2009). However,\naccess to publicly funded psychologists is scarce in many\nlocations, and wait-lists are long (Lacoursi\u00e8re, 2011; Payne\n& Myhr, 2010). Individual supported (guided) self-care or\ncomputerized self-care treatments based on principles of\ncognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) are recommended as a\nfeasible alternative to traditional individual therapy (National\nCollaborating Center for Mental Health, 2009). Supported\nself-care interventions appear to be effective in treating\ndepression (Gellatly et al., 2007), although most research has\nnot been conducted in people with chronic physical illnesses.\nLess is known about the extent to which participants adhere\nto these largely self-administered treatments.\nBetter adherence to a range of treatments is associated with\nimproved health outcomes (DiMatteo, Giordani, Lepper, &\nis defined as the degree to which a \"person's behavior--taking\nmedication,followingadiet,and/orexecutinglifestylechanges,\ncorresponds with agreed recommendations from a health care\n1St. Mary's Research Centre, Montreal, Quebec, Canada\n2McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada\n3St. Mary's Hospital Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada\n4University of Quebec at Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada\nCorresponding Author:\nJane McCusker, St. Mary's Research Centre, McGill University, Hayes\nEmail: Jane.McCusker@mcgill.ca\nAdherence to a Telephone-Supported\nDepression Self-Care Intervention for\nAdults With Chronic Physical Illnesses\nRussell Simco1, Jane McCusker1,2, Maida Sewitch2, Martin G.

In a recent systematic review of\nadherence of supported self-care interventions for depression\nstudies reviewed, 22 (55%) reported any measure of adher-\nence: 18 reported the percentage of participants completing the\nentire self-care tool (M = 66%, SD = 17); 13 studies reported\nthe amount of self-care tool completed by the average partici-\nthe frequency of contacts with the self-care guide/case man-\nager. Notably, just one of these studies involved a population\nwith chronic physical illness as defined in the present study.\nAlthough adherence to various medical and psychological\ninterventions is often associated with participant characteris-\ntics--for example, illness severity, socioeconomic status, and\nsocial support (DiMatteo, 2004; DiMatteo, Haskard, &\nWilliams, 2007)--only three studies evaluated the participant\ncharacteristics associated with better adherence. Information\non predictors of adherence to self-care interventions may help\nto target people most likely to benefit from this type of inter-\nvention, as well as those who may require additional support.\nWe conducted a feasibility study of a telephone-supported\ndepression self-care intervention among adults aged 40 and\nabove with one or more of six high-impact chronic physical\nillnesses (McCusker et al., 2012). The intervention had two\nmain components: a toolkit of paper and audiovisual tools,\nand weekly telephone support from a trained lay self-care\ncoach. Specific objectives of the present study were (a) to\nassess patient adherence at 2 months to use of the self-care\ntools and coach contacts and (b) to determine predictors of\nadherence to these intervention components.\nMethod\nThe study was an open, uncontrolled trial, conducted during\nRecruitment/Inclusion Criteria\nRecruitment methods have been described previously\n(McCusker, et al., 2012). Participants were recruited through\nfamily physicians' offices within a manageable travel dis-\ntance from the study site. Participants were eligible if they\nwere aged 40 or more, diagnosed with one or more of six\ntargeted high-impact chronic physical illnesses (arthritis,\nhypertension, diabetes, heart disease, chronic obstructive\npulmonary disease, and asthma; Broemeling et al., 2008) at\nleast 6 months prior to recruitment, and had at least mild\ndepressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire\u00ad9\nWilliams, 1999). Patients were excluded if they were sui-\ncidal, were receiving counseling or help at least once a month\nfor a mental health problem from any health professional\nother than their family doctor, were unable to read in either\nEnglish or French, were more than mildly cognitively\nimpaired (Blessed Orientation Memory and Concentration\nTest score of 10), or had a physical impairment that would\nprevent the patient from participating in a self-care interven-\ntion (e.g., visual impairment). Short initial screening forms\nwere distributed to patients by their family doctors or office\nstaff to ascertain age, presence of a chronic illness, and pos-\nsible depression assessed by the PHQ-2 (Kroenke, Spitzer, &\nWilliams, 2003). Initially eligible participants were then con-\ntacted by the study research assistant by telephone to confirm\nstudy eligibility and invite them to provide written consent.\nFamily doctors of participating patients were instructed to\ncontinue with usual care.\nIntervention\nA multi-disciplinary team of investigators designed and\nconducted the intervention, which comprised two compo-\nnents: providing patients a toolkit of self-care tools and\ntelephone-based coaching. The tools were classified into\nthree categories: (a) informational tools that provided infor-\nmation on causes, symptoms, and available treatments for\ndepression (e.g., information brochure); (b) cognitive-\nbehavioral tools that included exercises for behavioral acti-\nvation, cognitive restructuring, problem solving, and/or\nmood monitoring (e.g., mood-monitoring logbook); and (c)\ncombined tools that included both informational and cogni-\ntive-behavioral elements (e.g., comprehensive antidepres-\nsant skills workbook).\nSix tools comprised the toolkit and were available in\nEnglish or French. They included (a) an information brochure\ndescribing causes, symptoms, and treatments for depression\n(informational tool); (b) a DVD film titled \"Finding a way out\nof depression\" using patient and health care professional testi-\nmonials to describe causes, symptoms, and treatments for\ndepression (informational tool; Maher, 2001); (c) a mood-\nmonitoring logbook providing instructions and charts for daily\nmood monitoring (cognitive-behavioral tool); (d) an antide-\npressant skills workbook describing causes and symptoms of\ndepression, providing techniques, exercises, and worksheets\nfor behavioral activation, recognition of depressive thoughts,\nand problem solving (informational/cognitive-behavioral;\nBilsker & Paterson, 2010); (e) an action plan in booklet form,\nbased on material in the antidepressant skills workbook, to\nencourage behavioral activation in five general areas related to\nself-care for depressive symptoms and chronic illness, includ-\ning goal-setting techniques and action plan charts (cognitive-\nbehavioral tool; Bilsker & Paterson, 2010); and (f) Internet\ntools for English-speaking participants, specifically a website,\ne-couch (developed by the Australian National University), to\npermit creation of a confidential account, completion of an\nextensive interactive informational component on symptoms\nand causes of depression, and access to modules on interper-\nsonal therapy, physical activity, CBT, and problem solving.\nWorksheets were provided and stored online (informational/\ncognitive-behavioral; Australian National University, 2009).\nAn informational French-language site was provided as an\nSimco et al. 3\nalternative, as e-couch was only available in English (Briffault\nThe role of the coach was to support the participants in\nusing the self-care tools by encouraging them to try different\ntools and facilitating their practical application. Coaches\nwere instructed to not engage in active therapy (e.g., making\npersonal/behavior change recommendations, linking behav-\nior with mood changes, etc.). Two lay coaches (A and B)\nwere trained using a standardized training manual and super-\nvised by the study psychiatrist (author MGC) and psycholo-\ngist (author KLL). The coaches offered weekly telephone\ncontacts with each participant for the first 3 months and once\nper month for the second 3 months. Schedules for each sub-\nsequent contact were re-confirmed at the end of each call.\nFor each scheduled contact, a window period of 5 days was\ndesignated during which the coach could make a limited\nnumber (3 to 5) of attempts to reach the participant. If unsuc-\ncessful, that week's contact was skipped, and the following\nweek's contact was resumed at the regular time negotiated by\nthe coach and the participant. We audio-recorded all the con-\ntacts and randomly reviewed a sample to assess the fidelity\nof the intervention and to provide feedback to the coaches.\nEthical Issues\nWritten informed consent was received from all participants.\nParticipants who became severely depressed after enrollment\n(PHQ-9 score of 20 or higher) were not withdrawn from the\nstudy but referred to their family doctor for follow-up.\nParticipants who disclosed suicidal plans after enrollment\nwere withdrawn from the study and referred for appropriate\nfollow-up. The study protocol and consent procedures were\napproved by the St. Mary's Hospital Research Ethics\nCommittee.\nPotential Predictor Variables\nSociodemographics.Questions were adapted from Statistics\nCanada's (2004) Canadian Community Health Survey Cycle\n3.1: Educational attainment was a binary variable indicating\nhaving obtained at least a bachelor's degree. Total household\nincome in the previous year, before taxes, in Canadian dol-\ntics Canada, 2004). Marital status was classified as married/\ncohabiting versus other.\nPhysical health.Comorbidity was measured using the\nself-reported Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). For the\nanalysis, scores 3 were combined as the same category\n(Deyo, Cherkin, & Ciol, 1992; Katz, Chang, Sangha, Fos-\nsel, & Bates, 1996). Physical health status and functioning\nwere measured by the 12-Item Short-Form (SF-12) Physi-\ncal Component Summary score (Ware, Kosinski, & Keller,\nMental health.Depression severity and possible depres-\nsion diagnoses (major, minor) were assessed with the PHQ-9\n(Spitzer, Williams, & Kroenke, 2010). Two anxiety disorders\n(panic, other) were assessed using the Primary Care Evalua-\ntion of Mental Disorders diagnostic tool (Spitzer et al., 2010).\nCognitive impairment was measured using the short Blessed\nOrientation\u00adMemory\u00adConcentration score (Katzman et al.,\n1983). Mental health status and functioning were measured\nby the SF-12 Mental Component Summary (Ware et al.,\nHealth behavior.Physical activity was measured using\nGodin's Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (Godin &\nShepard, 1997). Social network was assessed using Lubben's\nSocial Network Scale (Lubben et al., 2006). Activation was\ncalculated using the Patient Activation Measure (Hibbard,\nStockard, Mahoney, & Tusler, 2004). Adherence to medical\nrecommendations was determined by the General Adherence\nAdherence Outcomes\nSelf-care tool adherence.Self-reported tool adherence was\nassessed in a telephone interview by a research assistant, 2\nmonths after the baseline interview. Completion of each tool\nwas recorded on a Likert-type scale 0--none, 1--very little,\n2--less than half, 3--more than half, 4--most, 5--all.\nAdherence to the mood-monitoring notebook was assessed\nas total number of days during the previous 2 months using a\nsimilar Likert-type scale.\nA three-level composite ordinal outcome was created\nprior to data analysis to describe overall tool adherence. The\nrationale behind the measure was that \"high adherence\"\nwould constitute significant use of both informational and\ncognitive-behavioral tool content. Participants with high\nadherence therefore completed either most to all (i.e., scores\nof 4 or 5 on the Likert-type scale) of either a combined infor-\nmational/cognitive-behavioral tool (the workbook or\ne-couch) or most to all (i.e., scores of 4 or 5 on the Likert-\ntype scale) of both an informational tool (information bro-\nchure or film) and a cognitive-behavioral tool (action plan or\nmood monitoring). Participants with moderate adherence\ncompleted most to all (i.e., scores of 4 or 5 on the Likert-type\nscale) of either an informational or cognitive-behavioral tool.\nPatients with low adherence completed less than most to all\n(i.e., scores of 0 to 3 on the Likert-type scale) of all tools.\nCoach contacts. Coaches recorded weekly contacts in the\ncoach log book. The number of coach contacts completed\nat 2 months was categorized prior to data analysis to cre-\nate an ordinal outcome indicating progressive adherence to\nthe coach contacts schedule. Categories were high (7-9),\nBecause coach characteristics may have affected partici-\npants' willingness to receive weekly phone contacts, we\n4 SAGE Open\nanalyzed a series of dichotomous \"yes\" or \"no\" questions\nevaluating the coaching intervention as (a) too often, (b) too\nlong, (c) about the right amount, (d) helpful, (e) intrusive, (f)\nsupportive, and (g) bothersome. In addition, participants\nwere asked, \"Was (coach) helpful in\" (a) introducing you to\nthe tools, (b) helping you select the tools, (c) helping you set\ngoals, or (d) helping you select community resources.\nStatistical Analysis\nTo assess the impact of patient characteristics on tool and\ncoach adherence, we used ordered logistic regression with a\nthree-level outcome for each kind of adherence correspond-\ning to increasing degrees of adherence; we tested for propor-\ntionality of odds ratio for both outcomes (Hosmer &\nLemeshow, 2000). All patient variables were pre-screened\nby fitting univariate ordinal logistic regressions (Hosmer &\nLemeshow, 2000); only variables with a p value of .25 or less\nwere retained for use in multivariate model building.\nThe model for each outcome was constructed by stepwise\nselection with backward elimination (Hosmer & Lemeshow,\n2000). The proportional odds assumptions were tested in the\nfinal models using the likelihood ratio test and also the Brant\nimputation was used to handle missing predictors (Graham\nAll analyses were conducted using Stata 11 (StataCorp,\nResults\nThe recruitment flowchart is shown in Figure 1.Atotal of 254\npatients completed the initial screening questionnaire, of\nwhom 165 (65%) completed the telephone screening. Of the\n165 who completed the second screening questionnaire, 98\nwere eligible and provided verbal consent. Of the 63 fully\nconsenting participants, 57 (90%) responded to the 2-month\nquestionnaire. Participant characteristics indicate an older,\nmostly female, and sicker sample--as the physical and men-\ntal health status scores were below age-adjusted Canadian\nnational averages, and comorbidity scores were high (Table 1;\nSelf-reported completion rates of each tool are shown in\nTable 2. Viewing the DVD film had the highest completion\n(51%) and the Internet tool the lowest (3.5%; Table 2).\nFigure 1. Study sample flow diagram.\nSimco et al. 5\nSixty-seven percent (38) of the participants completed all of\nat least one tool; 21 of those 38 participants completed all of\n1 or more behavioral tools (mood-monitoring logbook,\naction plan, workbook, e-couch). Of the remaining 19, 17\nstarted but did not complete any tool, and 2 did not start any\ntool. Tool adherence was classified as high for 42% of the\nparticipants and low for 23%. Mean (SD) coach contacts\ncompleted was 5.7 (2.4) out of a maximum possible of 9\n(63.3%). Adherence to coach contacts was classified as high\nfor 42% and low for 18% of the participants. The correlation\nbetween the ordinal self-care tool adherence variable and\ntotal number of completed coach contacts was r = .36.\nFollowing univariate screening, four variables were\nincluded in the stepwise selection procedure for prediction of\nthe ordinal tool adherence outcome: sex, social networks,\ncomorbidity, and depression severity. Table 3 presents cumu-\nlative odds ratios representing the odds of being in a higher\nadherence category compared with a lower category.\nStatistically significant predictors of higher adherence in the\nmultivariate model were higher comorbidity and lower\nseverity of depression symptoms. A 1-point increase in\ncomorbidity score (capped at 3) was associated with a 1.67-\nfold increase in the odds of higher adherence. A 1-point\nincrease in depression severity score was associated with an\n11% decrease in the odds of higher adherence.\nFive variables (comorbidity, minor and major depression\ndiagnosis, assigned coach, and physical activity) were\nincluded in the stepwise selection for prediction of the ordi-\nnal coach adherence outcome: Assigned coach, minor and\nmajor depression diagnosis, and physical activity were\nincluded in the final model, presented in Table 4. Only\nassigned coach was a statistically significant predictor in the\nmultivariate model: Participants assigned coach B had 4.5-\nfold increase in odds of higher adherence (p = .001). Means\n(SDs) of completed coach contacts for CoachesAand B were\nAlthough evaluations of patient perceptions of the two\ncoaches revealed no significant differences, trends suggested\nthat Coach B was perceived to be more helpful with intro-\nducing the tools (100% vs. 93%), helping participants set\ngoals (87% vs. 68%), and referring participants to commu-\nnity resources (68% vs. 36%) compared with Coach A.\nHowever, Coach B was also rated as more intrusive (20% vs.\naudiotaped recordings provided complementary informa-\ntion, indicating that although both coaches adhered to the\ncoaching guidelines, Coach B was generally more enthusias-\ntic than Coach A and gave liberal praise to the participants.\nDiscussion\nUsing an open, uncontrolled intervention study design, we\ninvestigated adherence to a telephone-supported self-care\ndepression intervention in persons aged 40 and above\nrecruited from primary care practices with depressive symp-\ntoms and comorbid chronic physical illnesses. Overall, 67%\nof the participants reported completion of at least one tool,\nand mean completion of coach contacts was 63%. Lower ini-\ntial depression scores and higher comorbidity scores were\npredictors of better self-care tool adherence. Patient charac-\nteristics did not predict adherence to coach calls. Moreover,\nas the number of coach calls differed between the two\ncoaches, coaching style may be important in mediating\npatient use of the support component of the intervention.\nSixty-seven percent of the participants completed at least\none entire tool in the toolkit, which was similar to the mean\ncompletion of 66% found in our systematic review of self-\ncare interventions for depression or anxiety (Simco, et al.,\n2014) and somewhat higher than the median percent comple-\ntion of 56 reported in a systematic review of 36 studies of\ncomputerized CBT interventions (Waller & Gilbody, 2009).\nWe cannot compare the low completion rate of our comput-\nerized CBT tool directly to the results of the latter study,\nbecause we presented participants with multiple tools, and\nthey could select the tool(s) that most appealed to them.\nCompletion of individual tools ranged from a high of 51%\nfor the DVD film and a low of 3.5% for the Internet tool,\nsuggesting low acceptability to the latter in this population.\nThe composite tool adherence outcome suggests that,\nglobally, the self-care intervention was acceptable, with 77%\nof the participants included in the moderate-to-high adher-\nence categories. Two predictors of better tool adherence\nTable 1.

Greater physical comorbidity may increase\nmotivation to engage in self-care. However, greater severity\nof depressive symptoms is associated with lower motivation.\nTo our knowledge, no previous study has reported data on\nadherence to the self-care coach component of self-care\ninterventions. Eighty-two percent of the participants com-\npleted a third or more of possible coach contacts; 42%\ncompleted two thirds to all of possible contacts, indicating\nthe acceptability of the coaching intervention was limited\nand coach-dependent. Importantly, however, there was only\na modest correlation between tool adherence and the number\nof coach calls, and no differences in tool adherence between\nthe two coaches. Our data on patient perceptions of the\ncoaches suggest that differences in coaching style may have\naffected the relationship developed between the coach and\nthe patient (Dobkin, Sita, & Sewitch, 2006; Sewitch et al.,\n2004). Further research is needed on the characteristics of\ncoaches that improve intervention adherence. Notably, we\nTable 3.

Further research is also needed on whether the provi-\nsion of coach support increases adherence to and outcomes\nof self-care interventions for depression, and on the optimal\nnumber of coach contacts needed.\nLimitations\nSelf-reported adherence was assessed retrospectively and\nwas subject to recall and social desirability biases, which\nlikely overestimated tool adherence. However, self-report is\nunavoidable when using non-electronic self-care tools. For\ntools requiring mood or activity logging, reporting the num-\nber of entries made might have improved accuracy. We did\nnot collect data on why participants chose to use or not use a\ngiven tool. Small sample size and the resulting low statistical\npower limited the number of variables that could be entered\ninto the prediction models (Hosmer & Lemeshow, 2000).\nThe highly selected patient sample may also limit the gener-\nalizability of our findings.\nImplications\nOur findings on adherence to both the self-care tool and\ncoach components of our intervention are promising for the\nuse of this intervention in the targeted population. Further\nresearch on depression self-care interventions is required to\nconfirm our findings in larger patient samples of adults with\ndepressive symptoms and chronic physical illnesses. We rec-\nommend that adherence to both the self-care coach and self-\ncare tool components be reported in future studies.Additional\nareas for future research include examining the contributions\nof the two intervention components to patient outcomes and\nthe characteristics of coaches associated with better interven-\ntion adherence and outcomes. We have an ongoing random-\nized trial that aims to compare a supported versus an\nunsupported depression self-care intervention (McCusker,\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research and/or authorship of this article: This work was\nsupported by the Fonds de la Recherche du Qu\u00e9bec\u00adSant\u00e9 (FRQS)\nported by a Chercheur Boursier Junior 1 from the FRQS and the\nMinist\u00e8re de la Sant\u00e9 et des Services sociaux du Qu\u00e9bec.
