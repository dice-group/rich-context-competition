It is hypothesized that economic and social features of urban neighborhoods may further\naccount for these differences. The authors conducted a household survey of 8,782 adults residing in 343\nChicago, Illinois, neighborhoods to assess mean levels of perceived social support and used US Census data to\nestimate neighborhood economic disadvantage. Data on birth weight and maternal risk factors were gathered\nAmerican mothers were found to be, on average, 297 g lighter than those born to White mothers. After adjustment\nfor individual-level risk factors, this difference was reduced to 154 g. For African-American mothers only, mean\nbirth weight decreased significantly as the neighborhood level of economic disadvantage increased. For White\nmothers only, a significant positive association was found between perceived levels of neighborhood social\nsupport and infant birth weight. Adding these neighborhood-level predictors to the model reduced the adjusted\nWhite versus African-American difference in birth weight to 124 g. Results support the hypothesis that\nneighborhood-level factors are significantly associated with infant birth weight.\nbirth weight; poverty; risk factors; social environment; socioeconomic factors\nAbbreviation: PHDCN, Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods.\nIn the United States, infants born to African-American\nwomen are, on average, almost 300 g lighter and more than\ntwice as likely to be low birth weight than are infants of\nWhite women (1).

Lower birth weights have been reported to be\nassociated with contextual-level factors including higher\nneighborhood educational and income levels (5, 6, 11),\nhigher median rent (5), and higher rates of violent crime (3).\nHowever, to our knowledge, all such multilevel epidemio-\nlogic investigations to date have relied on census and admin-\nistrative data (crime rates, per capita health expenditures). It\nhas also been hypothesized that social processes not fully\nreflected in such administrative data also vary between\nneighborhoods and may contribute to the racial gap in birth\noutcomes (5). Supporting this hypothesis are findings that\ncohesive social networks, trust, and reciprocal exchanges\namong residents are associated with lower rates of mortality\n(12) and morbidity (13). Finally, epidemiologic evidence\nindicates that, during pregnancy, social support from a\npartner, family member, and others appears to improve fetal\ngrowth (14, 15); neighborhood factors may contribute to\nsuch support.\nWe hypothesized that economic and social features of\nurban neighborhoods, in particular material disadvantage\nand residents' perceptions of the level of cohesion and\nsupport in their neighborhood, are related to the birth weight\nof infants from those neighborhoods. We reasoned that there\nmay be several processes through which such neighborhood-\nlevel factors translate into improved birth outcomes for\npregnant women, including access to medical care, proper\nnutrition, promotion of desirable health behaviors, and stress\nreduction.\nNeighborhood measures\nNeighborhood-level data for the city of Chicago, Illinois,\nwere gathered in 1995 as part of the Project on Human\nDevelopment in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN) (16).\nPHDCN was a large-scale interdisciplinary study designed\nto provide new information about the role of neighborhood-,\nfamily-, and individual-level factors in the development of\nsocial functioning, mental health, and physical health status\n(16). PHDCN combined a neighborhood-level study of the\nentire city of Chicago and intensive investigation of 80\nrandomly selected neighborhoods, along with a longitudinal\ncohort study of approximately 6,000 families. The consider-\nable socioeconomic, racial, and ethnic diversity of the popu-\nlation was a major reason that Chicago was selected as the\nstudy site. By applying a spatial definition of \"neighbor-\nhood\"--a collection of people and institutions occupying a\nsubsection of a larger community--we combined all 847\ncensus tracts in Chicago to create 343 ecologically mean-\ningful and homogeneous \"neighborhood clusters\" by using\ngeographic boundaries and knowledge of traditional\nChicago neighborhoods. Following a cluster analysis in\nwhich the census tract was the unit of analysis, we used\neither single, large tracts or combined contiguous census\ntracts that were comparable in terms of racial/ethnic compo-\nsition, household income, educational levels, and housing\ndensity to identify neighborhood clusters that each included\napproximately 8,000 residents. These neighborhood clusters\nwere generated, in part, to provide adequate sample sizes for\nthe cohort-study component of PHDCN, which is not the\nfocus of this paper. Here, we refer to neighborhood clusters\nas \"neighborhoods,\" keeping in mind that other operational\ndefinitions might also have been used; neighborhood clus-\nters are comparable to large census tracts.\nWe conducted a multistage probability household survey\nof all neighborhood clusters. For 263 of the clusters, nine\ncensus blocks were selected with a probability proportional\nto population size; three dwelling units were selected at\nrandom within each block, and an adult respondent (aged 18\nyears or older) was randomly selected within each of approx-\nimately 20 households. The remaining 80 neighborhood\nclusters were oversampled (approximately 50 respondents\nper neighborhood cluster) for more intensive study by using\na simple random sample of census blocks and dwelling units\nwithin blocks. The overall survey response rate was 75\npercent.\nConsistent with prior work with these data (17), we\nderived a neighborhood-level measure of \"neighborhood\nsupport\" (17, 18). Respondents were asked how strongly\nthey agreed (on a five-point scale) with 10 statements such\nas, \"This is a close-knit neighborhood\" and \"People do\nfavors for each other\" (details provided in table 1). Resi-\ndents' responses within neighborhood cluster were averaged\nto construct the neighborhood cluster\u00adlevel measure. This\nscale has high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha, 0.82).\nBecause neighborhood-level poverty and other indicators of\neconomic disadvantage have been associated with both\nlower levels of social cohesion (17\u00ad19) and birth outcomes\n(5, 6), we sought a neighborhood cluster\u00adlevel index of\neconomic disadvantage as a potential confounder in the rela-\ntion between neighborhood support and birth weight. Using\ndata from the 1990 US Census, we derived an aggregate\nmeasure of neighborhood economic disadvantage, calcu-\nlated for each neighborhood cluster as the first principal\ncomponent of the proportion of residents 1) living below the\npoverty line, 2) on public assistance, and 3) unemployed.\nBoth neighborhood cluster\u00adlevel scales (neighborhood\nsupport and economic disadvantage) were standardized\n(mean, 0; standard deviation, 1). Racial/ethnic composition\n(i.e., proportion African American) was determined by the\nproportion of births to African-American women in each\nneighborhood cluster.\nBirth outcomes\nicate files supplied by the Chicago Department of Public\nHealth. Multiple births and those for which data were\nmissing on birth weight or maternal risk factors were\nexcluded from the analysis, as were births from the one\nneighborhood cluster for which we did not have census data.\nFurthermore, our analyses included only those births to\nmothers whose race was recorded as being either White (not\nHispanic) or African American.\nBirth Weight of Urban Infants 3\nAnalytic approach\nWe estimated a set of four hierarchical linear regression\nmodels (20, 21). Unmeasured neighborhood influences on\nbirth outcomes were represented by a pair of random effects,\none for White mothers and one for African-American\nmothers (22\u00ad25). This approach 1) avoids the assumption\nthat the processes affecting birth outcomes are the same for\nWhite and African-American mothers, 2) permits estimation\nof how much variation in birth outcomes lies between and\nwithin neighborhoods for White and African-American\nmothers, and 3) adjusts standard errors to take into account\nthe clustered nature of the sample.\nWe estimated models that controlled for individual-level\ncharacteristics and behaviors (infant's gender, prenatal care,\nmaternal age, mother's marital status, maternal smoking,\nmaternal education, and parity) before testing for associa-\ntions between neighborhood characteristics and birth weight.\nExploratory analysis demonstrated that maternal age was\ncurvilinearly related to birth weight and could be modeled as\na quadratic function of age (thus, our models included terms\nfor maternal age and the square of age) and that the number\nof cigarettes smoked per day during pregnancy and the\nnumber of years of maternal education were linearly associ-\nated with birth weight. Both parity and prenatal care were\nmodeled as dichotomous variables, indicating primiparity\n(first birth) and receipt of any prenatal care, respectively.\nModel 1 included only the estimated White and African-\nAmerican neighborhood-mean birth weights, which\nprovided estimates of the variance in birth weight observed\nbetween and within neighborhood clusters and the correla-\ntion between African-American and White neighborhood-\nmean birth weights across neighborhoods. Model 2 added all\nindividual maternal risk factors and infant gender. To this\nmodel, we added the racial/ethnic composition (proportion\nAfrican American) of the neighborhood and economic\ndisadvantage (model 3). Finally, we added neighborhood\nsupport to the model (model 4). We also conducted several\ngeneral linear hypothesis tests (20) to assess whether the\njoint effect of a group of predictors could be differentiated\nfrom zero and whether White versus African-American birth\nweights differed.\nAll hierarchical models presented were estimated by\nrestricted maximum likelihood using Hierarchical Linear\nand Nonlinear Modeling (HLM) software (26). All other\nstatistics presented in this paper were estimated by using\nSYSTAT (27) and Statistical Analysis System (SAS) (28)\nsoftware.\nRESULTS\npercent), no valid birth weight was available.

The vast differences\nin the social circumstances in which African-American and\nWhite pregnant women live and the great degree of racial\nsegregation were evident (table 3). More than 85 percent of\nbirths to African-American women occurred in only 135 (39\npercent) of Chicago's 343 neighborhoods. Mean birth\nweights decreased and low birth weight proportions\nincreased in neighborhoods in which more African-\nAmerican births occurred. For neighborhoods in which most\n(>90 percent) births were to African-American women, the\naverage proportion of adults living below the federal poverty\nlevel was 31.2 percent, five times greater than for the\nmajority White birth (>90 percent) neighborhoods (6.2\npercent). This situation was further reflected in the values of\nthe composite index of economic disadvantage; there was\nlittle overlap in the economic levels of majority African-\nAmerican and majority White birth neighborhoods.\nResidents' perceptions of neighborhood support also\nvaried considerably across neighborhoods. Residents in\nneighborhoods in which mostly White births occurred\nreported a mean value of neighborhood support of 0.63, indi-\ncating above-average cohesion, trust, and supportive interac-\ntions among neighbors. The mean values for the majority\nAfrican-American birth neighborhoods were one standard\ndeviation lower than those for the White birth neighbor-\nhoods. Unlike economic status, levels of neighborhood\nsupport reported in majority African-American neighbor-\nhoods overlapped considerably with the levels in majority\nWhite neighborhoods.\nModel 1 (table 4) represented birth outcomes as a function\nof means for African-American and White mothers plus a\npair of random effects for each neighborhood. The estimated\nneighborhood-mean birth weight for infants born to White\nmothers (3,376 g) was greater than the neighborhood-mean\nbirth weight for infants of African-American mothers (3,103\nbirth weights between neighborhoods was statistically\nsignificant for both African-American and White mothers (p\n< 0.0005 for both), although the proportion of variance\nbetween neighborhoods was small (0.57 percent for African-\nAmerican mothers and 0.93 percent for White mothers).\nThere was an association between African-American and\nWhite birth weights such that neighborhoods manifesting\ngreater birth weights for White mothers also tended to show\ngreater birth weights for African-American mothers (r =\nModel 2 included individual-level maternal characteristics\nand infant gender only. Educational level, receipt of prenatal\ncare, being married, and giving birth to a male baby were\npositively associated with birth weight, while primiparity\n(first birth) and smoking predicted lower birth weight. The\ndirection of these effects was similar for White and African-\nAmerican mothers, although, in all instances except for the\ngender of the baby, African-American and White coeffi-\ncients were significantly different from one another.\nMaternal age is the one case in which we found a significant\n(negative) effect for African-American mothers and no\nsignificant effect for White mothers. When we held constant\nall explanatory variables at their grand means, the expected\nbirth weight for White mothers (3,497 g) remained greater\nthan for African-American mothers (3,343 g); the difference\nTABLE 2.

Controlling for\neconomic disadvantage alone accounted for most of the\nbetween-neighborhood variance in birth weight estimated in\nmodel 2. Specifically, economic disadvantage accounted for\n80.8 percent of the between-neighborhood variance for\nAfrican-American mothers and 76.3 percent for White\nmothers.\nModel 4 added neighborhood social support as an explan-\natory variable. The estimated association was significantly\npositive for White but not for African-American mothers.\nFor Whites, an increase of one standard deviation in neigh-\nborhood social support was associated with a 17.5-g higher\nmean birth weight. For African-American mothers, the\ncorresponding coefficient (\u00ad4.7) was nonsignificant. These\ntwo coefficients were statistically significantly different\nfrom each other (p < 0.0005). For Whites, controlling for\nneighborhood social support in addition to neighborhood\neconomic disadvantage explained 90.9 percent of the\nbetween-neighborhood variance estimated in model 2. Anal-\nyses conducted for infants born to White mothers only indi-\ncated that infants in neighborhoods in the top tertile of\nsupport had statistically elevated birth weights compared\nwith those in low- or medium-support neighborhoods. In\ncontrast, infants born in those neighborhoods reported as\nleast supportive had mean birth weights similar to those in\nmedium-support neighborhoods.\nDISCUSSION\nFor White mothers only, results indicate a positive associ-\nation between levels of neighborhood support and the birth\nweights of infants born in these neighborhoods. This associ-\nation was independent of the level of economic disadvantage\nof the neighborhood, racial/ethnic composition, and several\nestablished individual-level risk factors. The reports of\nneighborhood support did not come from the pregnant\nwomen themselves. We did not seek to test the hypothesis\nthat level of perceived support reported by individual preg-\nnant women is associated with higher birth weight of their\ninfants. The current results support a more distal mechanism,\nnamely, that the level of support reported by a representative\nsample of residents enhances birth weight throughout the\nneighborhood. Neighborhood support may serve as a health-\npromoting factor, with positive effects accruing when some\nthreshold is surpassed. In our data, this threshold was not\narbitrary; the turning point corresponded with a value on the\nscale of neighborhood support (top tertile) for which resi-\ndents were more likely than not to state that they trusted and\ninteracted with their neighbors.\nFor predominantly African-American neighborhoods, we\nfound no association between levels of neighborhood\nsupport and infant birth weight. Because social cohesion and\ninteractions among neighbors are not perceived equally by\nall residents of a neighborhood, we calculated estimates of\nneighborhood support based on reports from African-\nAmerican respondents only. Again, no association was\nfound between perceived neighborhood support and the birth\nweight of African-American infants. However, we found a\nsignificant effect of level of economic disadvantage on the\nbirth weight of African-American infants only. As unem-\nployment, poverty, and public assistance levels increased,\nthe mean birth weight of African-American infants\ndecreased.\nThe lack of association between neighborhood support and\nbirth weight for African-American infants may, in part, be\nattributable to the level of residential segregation and the\nsocial climate in Chicago and other US cities. Although\nmany births to African-American women occur in neighbor-\nhoods that, overall, are reported to be highly supportive, few\nneighborhoods are perceived as such by their African-\nAmerican residents. Our data did not permit an adequate test\nof whether African-American mothers would accrue the\nsame benefit in birth weight associated with higher levels of\nneighborhood support that was demonstrated for White\nmothers because there were few African-American mothers\nliving in neighborhoods perceived as supportive by their\nAfrican-American neighbors. In settings of economic disad-\nvantage, opportunities to generate or sustain social support at\nthe neighborhood level may be constrained. In more advan-\ntaged neighborhoods, African-American mothers may expe-\nrience real or perceived discrimination that serves to distance\nthem from the generally favorable social climate experi-\nenced by Whites.\nWhile the total proportion of the variation in infant birth\nweight at the neighborhood level was small compared with\nthe variation between individual infants, the role of neigh-\nborhood characteristics is still of public health significance.\nThe six established individual risk factors included in these\nanalyses (such as maternal age, education, smoking during\npregnancy, and receipt of prenatal care) accounted for only\n5.3 percent of the variance in individual birth weights. In\ncontrast, the three neighborhood variables (racial/ethnic\ncomposition, economic disadvantage, and neighborhood\nsupport) accounted for more than 80 percent of the variance\nin birth weight between neighborhoods. The proportion of\nvariance in birth weights between neighborhoods was small\npercent for White mothers) but statistically significant, and\nwe could account for this variation. Second, these neighbor-\nhood-level factors impact the mean birth weight of hundreds\nof pregnant women per neighborhood. Small neighborhood\neffects such as those noted may have large population\nimpacts.\nSeveral of the individual-level maternal risk factors we\ncontrolled for, such as maternal smoking and lack of prenatal\ncare, may be consequences of lower neighborhood support.\nFor instance, neighborhoods with higher levels of cohesion\nand interpersonal interaction may encourage mothers to seek\nprenatal care or to stop smoking during pregnancy. If so,\nthen our decision to include these as individual-level factors\nwould underestimate the amount of variation in birth weight\nthat could be attributed to neighborhood factors. A limitation\nof the current investigation was the lack of individual-level\ndata on mothers' perceived social support and detailed infor-\nmation on socioeconomic status (beyond marital status and\nBirth Weight of Urban Infants 7\neducational level). White mothers in higher support neigh-\nborhoods may perceive and receive greater social support\nthemselves, accounting for the noted association between\nneighborhood support and birth weight. Similarly, the lower\nsocioeconomic opportunities of African-American women,\nrather than the level of economic disadvantage of their\nneighborhoods, might account for this association among the\nAfrican-American sample. Ideally, future investigations of\nneighborhood influences on birth weight will address this\nlimitation.\nThe current analysis draws on and contributes to previous\nliterature demonstrating an association between neighbor-\nhood-level social processes and health outcomes. Our\nmeasure of \"neighborhood support\" is conceptually related\nto constructs of social capital (12, 29), cohesion (30), and\ncollective efficacy (17). These constructs all reflect social\nprocesses that may operate within a neighborhood or other\ncollective context to the benefit of residents. While prior\ninvestigations have examined sociodemographic, composi-\ntional, and other structural features of neighborhoods, this is\nthe first known to examine such perceived social processes\nat the neighborhood level in relation to birth outcomes. We\ndid not attempt to differentiate between the impact of\nspecific forms of neighborhood support (for example, instru-\nmental vs. emotional support, perceived vs. received\nsupport) that have been identified in individual-level studies\n(15); such work may warrant future investigation.\nNeighborhood support, as broadly conceived, could\noperate through several mechanisms to improve infant birth\nweight. First, it may foster a local climate of encouragement,\ninformation, and tangible aid that contributes to maternal\nhealth and fetal growth (31, 32). For example, social support\nhas been consistently associated with reduced cigarette\nSecond, social network researchers have argued that\ncommunity ties may provide positive reference groups and\nexert pressures to conform to health-promoting normative\nstandards (35\u00ad37). Neighborhood support could thus result\nin improved utilization of and compliance with medical care\nas well as positive health-care behaviors during pregnancy.\nFinally, partial but inconsistent evidence exists that high-\nquality social support may also directly affect intrauterine\ngrowth by dampening adverse hormonal and immunologic\nThese results add to the growing evidence that commu-\nnity-wide social processes have positive effects on the health\nand well-being of residents. Taken together, the growing\nevidence of the health benefits of neighborhood cohesion,\nsupport, and engagement suggests this as an area of potential\nimpact for public health policy and practice.\n"
