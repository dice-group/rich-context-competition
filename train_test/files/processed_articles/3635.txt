    "abstract": "Abstract\nHydrogen sulfide (H2\nS) has been reported to exacerbate stroke outcome in experimental models. Cystathionine b-synthase\n(CBS) has been implicated as the predominant H2\nS-producing enzyme in central nervous system. When SH-SY5Y cells were\ntransfected to overexpress CBS, these cells were able to synthesize H2\nS when exposed to high levels of enzyme substrates\nbut not substrate concentrations that may reflect normal physiological conditions. At the same time, these cells demon-\nstrated exacerbated cell death when subjected to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) together with high substrate\nconcentrations, indicating that H2\nS production has a detrimental effect on cell survival. This effect could be abolished by CBS\ninhibition. The same effect was observed with primary astrocytes exposed to OGD and high substrates or sodium hydro-\nsulfide. In addition, CBS was upregulated and activated by truncation in primary astrocytes subjected to OGD. When rats\nwere subjected to permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion, CBS activation was also observed. These results imply that in\nacute ischemic conditions, CBS is upregulated and activated by truncation causing an increased production of H2\nS, which\nexacerbate the ischemic injuries. Therefore, CBS inhibition may be a viable approach to stroke treatment.\n",

Similarly, high\nplasma Cys levels on admission before treatment also\ncorrelated significantly with poor clinical outcome\nassessed at 3 months post stroke (Wong et al., 2006).\nThese findings implicated a clinical relevance of Hcy\nand Cys in ischemic stroke outcome. In addition, Cys is\na substrate for g-glutamylcysteine synthetase, which cata-\nlyzes the first reaction in the biosynthesis of glutathione\n(GSH), a major cellular antioxidant known to protect\ncells from oxidative damage mainly through the action\nof GSH peroxidase (Cohen and Hochstein, 1963; Meister\nand Anderson, 1983). This reaction is ATP dependent\nand therefore GSH will be depleted following ATP deple-\ntion. This may contribute to an increase in Cys level\nunder ischemic conditions.\nIn animal studies, Qu et al. (2006) reported that H2\nS\nwas increased in the cerebral cortex at 24 hr after perman-\nent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO), a rat\nstroke model. The H2\nS level was further increased by\nCys administration. Pretreatment with Cys increased\nthe infarct volume following pMCAO, while the inhib-\nition of H2\nS synthesis by CBS inhibitors reduced infarct\nvolume. Moreover, sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS, an H2\nS\ndonor) could mimic the effects of Cys pretreatment.\nThese results suggested that in ischemia, H2\nS production\nincreases through increased availability of Cys and\nincreased H2\nS worsens ischemic injuries, based on both\nhistological and functional assessments (Qu et al., 2006).\nTherefore, suppression of H2\nS production via the inhib-\nition of CBS activity may be an attractive approach to\nimprove stroke outcome during the acute phase of ische-\nmic stroke. However, inhibition studies were performed\nusing nonselective inhibitors of CBS (Asimakopoulou\net al., 2013). An often used inhibitor, aminooxyacetic\nacid (AOAA) also inhibits cystathioine g-lyase (CSE)\nand other enzymes like g-aminobutyric acid (GABA)\ntransaminase (Loscher, 1981). Furthermore, the possibil-\nity of pleiotropic effects of these inhibitors in influencing\nstroke outcome cannot be entirely ruled out.\nIn order to further establish if the overproduction of\nendogenous H2\nS leads to enhanced cell death under ische-\nmic conditions, we overexpressed CBS in undifferentiated\nneuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Enhanced cell death was\nobserved when the cells were subjected to oxygen and\nglucose deprivation (OGD) in the presence of Cys and\nHcy. The same was then observed in primary astrocytes\nalbeit to a lesser extent. In addition, we found that OGD\nrapidly increased the expression of CBS in primary astro-\ncytes and in rat brains subjected to pMCAO. Hence, we\nprovide evidence that upregulation of CBS expression\nexacerbates the outcome of stroke most likely through\nincreased H2\nS production.\nMethods\nEthics Statement\nAll animal experimental procedures in this study\nwere approved by the Institutional Animal Care\nand Use Committee of the National University of\nSingapore.\nCell Culture\nNeuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line was obtained from\nAmerican Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Cell were\nmaintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium\n(DMEM)/F12 (Gibco, Invitrogen, USA) containing\n10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco, Invitrogen, USA)\nand 1% penicillin\u00adstreptomycin (Gibco, Invitrogen,\nUSA) at 37 C and incubated in a humidified atmosphere\n.\nPrimary Culture of Rat Cortical Astrocyte\nPrimary astrocyte cultures were prepared from the\ncerebral cortices of 1- to 2-day old Sprague-Dawley\nrat pups as described previously (Lu et al., 2008)\nwith minor modifications. Briefly, the cerebral cortices\nwere harvested and digested with 0.25% trypsin (Gibco,\nInvitrogen, USA) at 37 C. The cells were seeded onto\npoly-L-lysine-coated flask with DMEM/F12 (Gibco,\nInvitrogen, USA) medium supplemented with 10%\nFBS (Gibco, Invitrogen, USA) and 1% penicillin\u00ad\nstreptomycin (Gibco, Invitrogen, USA). The cultures\nwere maintained at 37 C in a humidified atmosphere\n. Culture medium was replaced\n72 hr later and changed medium twice weekly\nthereafter. At 10 to 12 days, the confluent cultures\nwere shaken overnight to minimize microglia contam-\nination.

First-strand cDNA was\nsynthesized from total RNA using the RevertAid H\nMinus First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Fermentas/\nThermo Scientific). CBS coding region was isolated by\npolymerase chain reaction (PCR) from the cDNA using\nPrimeStar GXL DNA Polymerase (Clontech) with a SalI\nsite-containing forward (50 CGCGTCGACCATG\nCCTTCAGGGACATCC 30) and BamHI site-containing\nprimers.

Lentivirus particles were\nharvested from cell culture supernatant according to\nthe protocol of Deiseroth Lab (http://www.stanford.\nedu/group/dlab/resources/lvprotocol.pdf). Lentivirus\nharboring the CBS expression constructs was used to\ntransduce undifferentiated SH-SY5Y cells. Prior to\ntransduction, cells were cultured to 90% confluence.\nConcentrated virus particle was added to cell culture\nmedium containing 8 lg/ml of Polybrene (Sigma\nAldrich). Where long-term expression of transgene\nwas needed, antibiotic selection was applied by\nadding Blasticidin S (Invitrogen) at a final concentra-\ntion of 10 lg/ml to the medium. Expression of trans-\ngene was visualized by EGFP fluorescence.\nOxygen and Glucose Deprivation\nOGD was achieved by incubating the SH-SY5Y cells with\nand without CBS overexpression in glucose-free DMEM\nwith 1% streptomycin/penicillin in a hypoxia chamber\ndified incubator. OGD for primary cortical astrocyte\nculture was achieved by incubating the primary astrocytes\nin glucose-free DMEM with 1% streptomycin/penicillin\nin a hypoxia chamber (5% CO2\nat 37 C in a humidified incubator. For NaHS treatment,\nprimary astrocytes were seeded onto 96-well plate over-\nnight.

(2006). Briefly, cells were homogenized in\ncontaining varying concentrations of Cys and Hcy\n(total volume 0.5 ml). Blank was done by omitting the\nsubstrates. After incubation for 90 min at 37 C, zinc acet-\nate (1%, 0.25 ml) was added into the reaction mixture\nfollowed by tricholoracetic acid (10%, 0.25 ml). After\np-phenylenediamine sulfate (20 mmol/L prepared in 7.2\nnatant. Absorbance at 670 nm was measured using a\nmicroplate reader (Sunrise; TECAN) 20 min later.\nAbsorbance was converted to H2\nS concentration through\na standard curve obtained by using NaHS as the\nstandard.\npMCAO Model\npMCAO was performed according to Tamura et al.\n(1981). Animals were housed under diurnal lighting con-\nditions and fed standard rat chow and water ad libitum.\nCerebral ischemia was induced by permanent occlusion\nof the left middle cerebral artery (MCA) using a subtem-\nporal approach. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (6 to 8 weeks\nold) were anesthetized with ketamine (75 mg/kg, intraper-\nitoneally; Parnell Laboratories Pty Ltd, Alexandria,\nNSW, Australia) and xylazine (10 mg/kg, intraperitone-\nally; Troy Laboratories Pty Ltd, Smithfield, NSW,\nAustralia). The MCA was exposed through a subtem-\nporal craniectomy and cauterized from the point prox-\nimal to its origin to the points where it intersects the\ninferior cerebral vein. During the procedure, rat body\ntemperature was maintained at 37 C until recovery\nfrom anesthesia. For infarct volume assessments, rats\nwere decapitated at 8 or 24 hr after the pMCAO proced-\nure as described above. Whole brains were cut into 2 mm\ncoronal sections and immediately stained with 2% 2,3,5-\ntriphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC; Sigma Chemical\nCo.). Infarct volumes in the cortex, striatum, and whole\nhemisphere were measured using the Scion imaging soft-\nware (Frederick, MD, USA), and correction for brain\nedema was performed using the contralateral hemisphere\nas control. Infarct volumes are presented as the percent-\nage of the total volume of the brain region/hemisphere.\nWestern Blot\nBrains tissues from sham-operated control and pMCAO\n(3 to72 hr) rats were lysed by RIPA buffer (Cell Signaling)\nsupplemented with protease inhibitor and phosphatase\ninhibitor cocktail (Roche, Mannheim, Germany).\nChan et al. 3\nSH-SY5Y cells and primary cortical astrocytes were lysed\nby CST buffer (Cell Signaling) supplemented with prote-\nase inhibitor and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Roche,\nManheim, Germany). Total protein was determined by\nBradford protein assay (Biorad, CA, USA). Proteins were\nseparated by 10% SDS/PAGE, transferred onto a poly-\nvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Amersham\nBiosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK), and then blocked\nwith 10% nonfat milk. The membrane was then incu-\nbated with antibodies against CBS, or b-actin (Cell\nSignaling Technologies, Beverly, MA, USA) at 4 C over-\nnight, then washed and incubated in HRP-conjugated\nanti-rabbit or mouse IgG at room temperature for 1 hr.\nVisualization was carried out using Luminata Forte or\nCrescendo western HRP substrate (Millipore\nCorporation, Billercia, MA, USA), and the chemilumin-\nescence signals were detected using UVIchemi (UVItec,\nCambridge, UK).\nImmunofluorescence for Brain Slices\nRats were anaesthetized and perfused with 0.1 mol/L\nphosphate buffer saline followed by 4% paraformalde-\nhyde through the heart. Brains were removed and\nimmersed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 C.\nParaformaldehyde-fixed brains were then cryoprotected\nuntil use. Coronal sections (30 lm) were made using a\ncryostat and mounted on glass slides (Matsunami,\nJapan). Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubating\nthe section in 5% goat serum for 1 hr at room tempera-\nture. Antibodies against CBS (1:200) was used and incu-\nbated at 4 C overnight. Sections were then rinsed and\nincubated with Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit\n(Molecular probes, USA) secondary antibody for 1 hr\nat room temperature. Fluorescent-labeled sections were\nmounted using ProLong gold antifade reagent (Life tech-\nnologies, USA).

Fluorescent images were captured\nusing QImaging (Canada), and images captured were\nprocessed by Image Pro insight (QImaging, Canada).\nStatistical Analysis\nAll comparisons were performed by one-way analysis of\nvariance (ANOVA) followed by post hoc analysis with\nBonferroni correction or by two-tailed independent t test\nusing IBM SPSS Statistics 19. Data are expressed as\nmean\u00c6SEM. Statistical significance is reached when\nResults\nCBS Overexpression in SH-SY5Y Cells\nUnder normal conditions, SH-SY5Y cells express CBS at\na very low level. However, they can be efficiently trans-\nduced with lentiviral vector to overexpress CBS together\nwith EGFP, a fluorescent reporter. Results shown in\nFigure 1 confirmed that these transduced cells strongly\nexpress both EGFP and CBS (Figure 1(a) and 1(b)). The\nfull-length 63 kDa isoform was detected by Western blot\nbut not the truncated 45-kDa isoform (Figure 1(b)), indi-\ncating that the truncation mechanism may not be in place\nin these cells. When CBS substrates (Cys \u00fe Hcy) were\nadded to cell homogenates, H2\nS was produced in a con-\ncentration-dependent manner (Figure 1(c)). These results\nindicate that the CBS artificially overexpressed in these\ncells are fully functional. As 0.1 mM Cys \u00fe 0.01 mM Hcy\nare reportedly close to physiological concentrations\ncentrations were used as the low substrate condition and\na 10-fold increase as the high substrate condition in sub-\nsequent experiments.\nEffects of H2\nS Production on Cell Viability\nCBS-overexpressing (CBSOE) cells did not show any\ndifference in cell viability on exposure to high or low\nsubstrate concentrations when compared with control\ncells as shown by the MTT assay (Figure 2(a)).\nHowever, when cells are subjected to OGD, cell death\nincreased markedly regardless of substrate conditions.\nIn the absence or presence of low substrates, cell viability\nfell to about 30% to 40 % in both cell types whether or\nnot CBS was overexpressed. In the presence of high sub-\nstrates, cell viability was about 30% in the control cells\nbut about 5% in the CBSOE cells, indicating a significant\n4 ASN Neuro\nincrease in cell death. When LDH release was measured\nunder the same conditions, the results were entirely con-\nsistent with the MTT assay results (Figure 2(b)).\nThe enhanced cell death observed in CBSOE cells\nwhen exposed to high substrate condition was attenuated\nconcentration in a concentration-dependent manner by\nthe addition of AOAA, a nonselective CBS inhibitor,\nimmediately after the addition of substrates\n(Figures 2(c) and (d)). At 0.5 mM of AOAA, complete\nreversal was achieved in the MTT assay, while only par-\ntial reversal was observed in LDH release assay. These\ndata strongly support the notion that elevated production\nS in cells subjected to high substrate conditions\nenhanced cell death when the cells were subjected\nto OGD.\nWe next examined the effects of OGD in primary rat\nastrocytes under different substrate conditions.\nConsistent with the findings in CBSOE SH-SY5Y cells,\nprimary astrocytes subjected to OGD under high concen-\ntrations of Cys \u00fe Hcy showed cell viability of about 64%\nby MTT assay, a significant decrease from about 77% in\ncells not exposed to substrates (Figure 3(a)). This is\nsupported by a threefold increase in LDH release\n(Figure 3(b)). A small but significant increase in LDH\nrelease was also observed in control cells exposed to the\nhigh substrate condition without OGD, as opposed to no\neffects observed by MTT assay. This may be due to tox-\nicity attributable to Cys directly (Janaky et al., 2000) or\nindirectly (Nath and Salahudeen, 1993). To see if these\neffects could be mediated by H2\nS, we added NaHS at\n300 mM and observed a significant decrease in cell viabil-\nity in primary astrocytes when subjected to OGD\n(Figures 3(c) and (d)).\nUpregulation of CBS Expression and Infarct Volume\nFollowing Ischemic Insults\nCBS expression in primary astrocytes was found to\nincrease rapidly in rat brains within 30 min after the\nonset of OGD and remained high for at least 3 hr\n(Figure 4). However, unlike CBSOE SY-SH5Y cells,\nWestern blot results demonstrated the presence of both\nthe full-length and truncated isoforms (63 and 45 kDa,\nrespectively) of CBS.\nThe cortex and striatum are the most affected regions\nfollowing pMCAO in rats (Liu et al., 2009). Western blot\nanalysis revealed that the truncated but not the full-\nlength CBS was markedly upregulated (about twofold)\nFigure 1.

It was observed that the infarct\nvolume in the striatum was significantly larger at 24 hr\nthan that at 8 hr (27% vs. 12%). In contrast, the infarct\nvolume in the cortex as well as the whole affected hemi-\nsphere was not significantly different between the two\nFigure 2.

This shows that the ischemic inju-\nries continued to develop significantly between 8 and\n24 hr post-pMCAO in the striatum but not in the\ncortex. Therefore, the peaking of CBS expression in the\nstriatum at 24 hr may appear to be associated with the\nextent of ischemic injury.\nDiscussion\nS can be produced in the body by three key enzymes,\nnamely CBS, CSE, and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtrans-\nferase (3-MST, in combination with cysteine aminotrans-\nferase; Kashfi and Olson, 2013). CSE is expressed\npredominantly in the cardiovascular system (Zhao\nbrain and therefore generally accepted as a minor player,\nif at all, in H2\nS production in the brain (Abe and Kimura,\n1996). 3-MST is widely present in the brain, but its\nphysiological relevance is not clearly understood.\nHowever, in a recent study, Zhao et al. (2013) reported\nthat 3-MST was downregulated in both the cortex and\nstriatum following pMCAO, hence mitigating its role in\nincreased production of H2\nS under ischemic conditions\n(Zhao et al., 2013). Therefore, the focus is on CBS as the\npredominant enzyme responsible for H2\nS production in\nthe brain.\nThe native CBS enzyme is a tetramer consisting of four\nsubunits of 63 kDa (551 amino acids). This subunit can\nbe cleaved in its C-terminal region at Arg413 to yield\na 45-kDa subunit that lacks the regulatory domain.\nFigure 3. Comparison of endogenously produced and exogenous H2\nS.

In primary astrocytes subjected to OGD, the\nexpression of the 63-kDa CBS was clearly upregulated\n(Figure 4(b)), and the truncated form increased within\n30 min. Similarly, the truncated form also increased in\nboth the cortex and striatum within 24 hr post-pMCAO\n(Figures 5 and 6). These observations demonstrated that\nCBS responds very rapidly to ischemic insults. In contrast\nto primary astrocytes, the full-length 63-kDa CBS in the\ncortex and striatum remained unchanged following\npMCAO as shown by Western blotting (Figures 5(a)\nand 6(a)). This difference may be caused by the high\nbasal expression in the cortex and striatum as opposed\nto very low basal level of CBS expression in the primary\nastrocytes. However, the increased level of the 45-kDa\nCBS implies an upregulation of the expression of the\n63-kDa CBS. This is supported by the observed increase\nin immunostaining for CBS (Figures 5(c) and 6(c)).\nTherefore, it appears that increased CBS expression and\nactivation may underlie the increased production of H2\nS\nin ischemia (Qu et al., 2006). The mechanism that trig-\ngers the activation by cleavage remains to be elucidated.\nHowever, it has been reported that tumor necrosis factor-\na (TNF-a) induced CBS cleavage in HepG2 cells (Zou\nand Banerjee, 2003). This could be examined further as\ninflammatory cytokines such as TNF-a were found to be\nincreased under ischemic conditions (Zhou et al., 2013).\nIt is possible that increased CBS truncation causes a cor-\nresponding increase in the expression of the full-length\nenzyme by a positive feedback mechanism. It is noted\nthat the truncated form was not detected in the SH-\nSY5Y CBSOE cells, indicating that cleavage of CBS\ndoes not occur or occurs only at very low level\n(Figure 1(b)) in cells that do not endogeneously express\nCBS, perhaps due to the lack of the truncation mechan-\nism. These cells can serve as a model to investigate the\nfactors that induce cleavage and thus activation of CBS.\nHyperhomocysteinemia is an independent risk factor\nfor stroke (Perry et al., 1995). In addition, Hcy is\nFigure 4. Effects of OGD on CBS expression in primary cultures of cortical astrocytes.

In\nanimal studies, Cys has been reported to increase in\nanimal ischemic model, and Cys administration also\nincreases the ischemic damage after stroke (Slivka and\nevidence to suggest that in acute stroke, CBS activation\nis accompanied by a high availability of substrates for\nS production, which is most efficiently produced by\nb-replacement reaction where Cys condenses with Hcy\nto produce H2\nTaken together, it may be concluded that the acute ische-\nmic conditions are conducive for markedly elevated pro-\nduction of H2\nS. We mimicked such conditions by\noverexpressing CBS in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells\nand observed a massive increase in H2\nS production\nwhen the overexpressing cells were exposed to high sub-\nstrate conditions but not substrate concentrations that\nmay reflect normal physiological conditions (Singh\nCys can be neurotoxic to cells at high concentrations\net al., 2010), the high concentrations used in these experi-\nments were clearly nontoxic as no effects on cell viability\nwere observed in both control or CBSOE cells. In add-\nition, we had similarly overexpressed CBS in HEK293\ncells, which are originated from the kidney. The same\nresults were obtained in these cells as in the CBSOE\nSH-SY5Y cells (data not presented), indicating that the\nFigure 5. CBS expression in the cerebral cortex after pMCAO.

It is known to inhibit cytochrome c oxidase, car-\nbonic anhydrase, monoamine oxidase, cholinesterase,\nand Na\u00fe/K\u00fe-ATPase (Szabo, 2007); as well as to potenti-\nate glutamate excitotoxicity (Cheung et al., 2007; Chen\net al., 2011). Using mature mouse cortical neurons\nexpressing functional glutamate receptors, Cheung\net al. (2007) reported that glutamate-induced cell death\nwas exacerbated by the addition of NaHS. They further\nreported that NaHS at concentrations < 200 mM induced\napoptosis, while at concentrations > 200 mM, necrosis\nwas induced. In contrast, Kimura and Kimura (2004)\nreported that H2\nS at 100 mM concentration reversed cell\ndeath in immature mouse cortical neuron treated with\nfindings suggest that H2\nS may have neuroprotective\neffects at lower range of concentrations but become cyto-\ntoxic at a higher range of concentrations (Dorman et al.,\n2002). In our experiments, we did not observe any pro-\ntective effects under the low substrate conditions (Figures\n2 and 3). This may be due to the low concentrations of\nS that we used in our experiments or the selectivity of\nS protective effect for excitotoxic but not ischemic\ninsults.\nFigure 6.

However, such glutamate\naccumulation is more unlikely in vitro, so excitotoxicity\nis likely less important (Wang et al., 2002). OGD causes\nenergy depletion in cells, thus interrupting ATP-depen-\ndent processes notably the Na\u00fe/K\u00fe-ATPase and eventu-\nally disruption of ion gradients across the cellular\nmembrane. This causes cell membrane depolarization\nleading to Ca2\u00fe overload (Wang et al., 2002) and cell\ndeath by necrosis and apoptosis (Orrenius et al., 1994;\nKristian et al., 1998), involving the generation of free\nradicals (Abramov et al., 2007), mitochondrial or endo-\nplasmic reticulum dysfunction (Kristian et al., 1998,) and\ncaspase activation (Chong et al., 2012). Interestingly, the\ntruncated CBS has also been reported to be able to gen-\nerate superoxide radicals as it has reduction potential\nsimilar to other hemethiolate proteins such as chloroper-\noxidase, cytochrome P450, and nitric oxide synthase\n(Carballal et al., 2008). We are currently investigating\nS may interact with the cell death mechanisms\nfollowing OGD using the CBSOE cells.\nS has also been reported to be cytoprotective\n(Calvert et al., 2010) under various other conditions.\nFirst, NaHS was reported to protect primary cortical\nneurons (Kimura and Kimura, 2004), primary microglia\n(Hu et al., 2007), and primary astrocytes (Lu et al.,\n2008). In these studies, glutamate, lipopolysaccharide,\nand hydrogen peroxide (H2\n), respectively, were used\nto induce cell injuries. In cultured cell lines, NaHS is\nreportedly protective against cell damage induced\nYin et al., 2009). In the in vivo setting, protective effects\nhas been reported against global cerebral ischemia (Ren\nThese may indicate differences between ischemic models\nwith and without reperfusion. Overall, it appears that the\neffects of H2\nS in ischemia may vary according to prevail-\ning conditions, mechanism of the injury-inducing agent,\nand concentrations of H2\nS. To our knowledge, no pro-\ntective effects have been reported against OGD in in vitro\nstudies. Much work is needed to provide further\nunderstanding.\nWhile it has been reported previously that administra-\ntion of NaHS worsened stroke outcome in animal studies\n(Qu et al., 2006), we have further provided strong evi-\ndence that endogenously produced H2\nS could enhance\ncell death under ischemic conditions. Therefore, the pre-\nsent results may support the idea that CBS is a viable\ntherapeutic target, and CBS inhibition may hold promise\nas a treatment of ischemic stroke. However, currently\navailable CBS inhibitors lack selectivity and are therefore\nnot suitable for in vivo investigations. More selective CBS\ninhibitors will be needed for further progress.\nSummary\nCystathionine b-synthase (CBS) is the predominant\nenzyme responsible for the increased hydrogen sulfide\nS) production under ischemic conditions. High H2\nS\nlevels leads to enhanced cell death both in vitro and in\nvivo. CBS may be a potential therapeutic target for the\ntreatment of stroke.\nFigure 7.
