    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe use of behavioral techniques in college teaching has declined during the past three decades.The purpose of this study was\nto compare a behaviorally based grading approach with a traditional point-based system. A total of 40 college freshmen were\nrandomly assigned to aTraditionally Graded or Contract Graded Introductory Psychology course. Contract graded students\nwere one third as likely to fail or withdraw, 3 times more likely to earn an A grade, and were more likely to perceive a high\ndegree of control over their grade.These findings support use of a contract grading system in the contemporary college\nclassroom.\n",

Bryan Saville and his colleagues identified four pos-\nsible factors contributing to this declining use of behavior\nprinciples, including (a) an instructor's resistance to change,\n(b) incompatibility between program requirements and the\nacademic calendar, (c) the increased workload required by\nsome behavioral systems, and (d) lower confidence in the\nsuccess of behavioral systems following misuse or misap-\nplication. Perhaps in response to these criticisms, researchers\nhave started looking for ways to incorporate variations on\nbehavioral principles to today's classroom. Among these\nvariations is contract grading.\nContract grading is a system in which students determine\nand specify at the beginning of a class the grade they would\nlike to earn, from a set of instructor-defined parameters.\nAlthough there are a myriad of ways to implement contract\ngrading, in general, the following components are employed:\n(a) assignments are graded pass or fail; (b) a mastery crite-\nrion (often between 80% and 100%) is determined by the\ninstructor, and meeting this criterion is required to obtain a\npassing grade; (c) students are provided multiple attempts to\nearn a passing grade for each assignment; and (d) students\nchoose from a variety of assignments.\nThe use of contract grading is supported by wide-ranging\nbenefits. Students may be better able to monitor their prog-\nress, feel they have a greater role in their learning, and are\nmore likely to perceive primary control over their grade\nPolczynski & Shirland, 1977). As such, contract graded stu-\ndents may be more motivated to perform well. In addition,\nwhen assignments are graded pass or fail, emphasis is placed\non mastery of the material, as opposed to gaining a partial\nunderstanding of the material. And, despite its novelty, stu-\ndents may also prefer contract grading to traditional points-\nbased grading systems (Bunn Hiller & Hietapelto, 2001;\nAmong the few studies used to compare the effects of con-\ntract grading and traditional grading approaches, the data sup-\nport using contract grading or its components (see Johnston &\nSemb, 1974). Despite these promising findings, contract grad-\ning appears to be rarely used in classrooms today. In addition,\nrelative to the 1970s, many professors employ technologies not\npreviously available, such as computer-based lecture presenta-\ntions and use of online course management systems. More\nimportant, however, is the impact technological changes, in\ngeneral, occurring over the past decades (e.g., computers, cel-\nlular phones) have had on college students. For example, stu-\ndents today were born after widespread adoption of the Internet\nand are accustomed to receiving information and communica-\ntions immediately via text messaging and Internet phones.\nBecause of these technological and resulting cultural changes,\n1Western Illinois University, Macomb, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nDana F.

In particular, the question\nremains, \"Is contract grading, as a teaching technology, as effec-\ntive and applicable in today's classrooms, and today's students,\nas it was 40 years ago?\" To that end, the purpose of this research\nis to evaluate and compare contract grading and traditional\npoints-based grading systems on course performance and pref-\nerences among college freshmen in a contemporary classroom.\nMethod\nParticipants and Setting\nParticipants were 16 male and 24 female college freshmen\nattending a rural, state university. Participants were enrolled\nin the survey course, \"Introduction to Psychology,\" which\nwas also designated a First Year Experience (FYE) course.\nThe FYE program is designed to ease students' transition\nfrom high school to college and to increase retention\nbetween the freshmen and sophomore years. FYE courses\nhave small class sizes and in addition to the required cur-\nriculum, emphasis is placed on learning outside of the class-\nroom through service and cocurricular events. All students\nattending their freshmen year were required to register for at\nleast one designated FYE course.\nContract Grading Components\nand Course Materials\nEach of the common components of contract grading were\nutilized: (a) assignments were graded pass or fail, (b) a mas-\ntery criterion of 85% was required to earn a passing grade,\n(c) students were allowed up to two submissions to earn a\npassing grade for each assignment, and (d) students choose\nfrom a variety of assignments.\nCourse assignments included writing selections, activi-\nties, and exams. Each writing selection equaled approxi-\nmately three pages of text and required students to engage in\nsome task and then write about their experiences (e.g., create\nand present a poster describing a published research study).\nActivity selections included in-class activities as well as par-\nticipating in university events or psychology-related research\noutside of class. Four of the exams covered three chapters of\nmaterial each and consisted of matching, fill-in-the-blank,\nmultiple-choice, short-answer, and essay questions. The fifth\nand final exam was cumulative over the semester and con-\nsisted of matching and multiple-choice questions.\nRequirements for each grade were explained on the grade\ncontract (see appendix). Students identified the grade they\nwanted to contract for and then selected the writing and activ-\nity assignments they would complete to accomplish this goal.\nThe appropriate criterion for passing exams was marked, and\nstudent and instructor signed the contract.\nMeasures\nStudent retention and course grades were recorded as pri-\nmary dependent variables. As both these variables were\nbased on the official university roster at the beginning of the\nsemester, these dependent variables were available for all 40\nstudents involved in the study.\nSecondary measures came from three self-report ques-\ntionnaires designed to evaluate the course, instructor effec-\ntiveness, and student perceptions of their own effort. For the\nfirst questionnaire, students were asked to \"grade\" their\ninstructor (A, B, C, D, or F) on 9 items, such as \"Grade the\ninstructor's ability to provide a challenging course,\" and\n\"Grade the clearness of the course requirements and grading\nprocedures.\" The second questionnaire (23 items) asked\nstudents to rate the frequency of specific behaviors by the\ninstructor or student as it pertained to the course (response\nscale ranged from 1 = hardly ever to 5 = almost always).\nExample items include, \"The instructor clearly defined stu-\ndents' responsibilities,\" and \"I worked hard for the grades I\nreceived in this class.\" For the third questionnaire, students\nalso rated their agreement with 12 statements about the\ncourse format and content (response scale ranged from 1 =\ndisagree strongly to 5 = agree strongly), such as \"I enjoyed\nthe format of the course\" and \"The overall workload for this\ncourse was too much.\"\nAn additional outcome measure was taken from the aver-\nage response to a self-report question regarding students'\nperceived control over their grade: \"On a scale from 1 (not at\nall in control) to 10 (almost entirely in control), how much\ncontrol do you believe you personally had over your grade in\nthis class?\"\nProcedure\nAt the outset of the semester, the instructor randomly assigned\nstudents enrolled in one course section to the Contract\nGrading Group (n = 20) and those enrolled in the other section\nto the Traditional Grading Group (n = 20). Both sections were\ntaught by the same instructor, who at the time had 6 years of\ncollege teaching experience. With the exception of the con-\ntract grading elements (including the ability to resubmit an\nassignment), all of the lectures, writing and activity assign-\nments,andexamswereidenticalinbothsections.Requirements\nfor each grade were determined such that any grade was\ncomparable between sections (i.e., an A in the contract grad-\ning course was comparable with an A in the traditional grad-\ning course).\nThe grading structures were described in the syllabus cor-\nresponding to each section and reviewed in class during the\n1st week of the semester. Students in the Contract Grading\nGroup submitted a signed contract during the 1st week of\nclass and, if necessary, were allowed to modify their contract\nduring Week 10 of the semester. Students in the Traditional\nGrading Group received points for each assignment, and\nLindemann and Harbke 3\ngrades were based on the percentage of total points earned\nstudents in the Contract Grading Group were based on the\nnumber of writing assignments, activities, and exams that\nreceived a passing grade (see appendix). When a writing or\nactivity submission did not receive a passing grade, the stu-\ndent was informed of what changes were needed, and one\nresubmission was allowed to reach the mastery criterion. For\nexams, students who did not pass the first attempt viewed\ntheir graded exam for 10 min and were allowed a second\nattempt 2 days later to reach the mastery criterion (i.e., 80%\ncorrect responses). All assignments were graded by a gradu-\nate teaching assistant, who was blind to the manipulation.\nDuring the penultimate week of the semester, students\nwere asked to complete the three self-report measures and\nthe perceived control item by a graduate student who was\nblind to the study and manipulation. To complete these self-\nreport measures, students needed to be still enrolled in the\ncourse and present in class on the day they were adminis-\ntered. As such, self-report data were available from a total of\n28 students, with 15 contract grading (75% of initial enroll-\nment) and 13 traditional grading students (65% of initial\nenrollment) completing these measures. Responses to the\nself-report measures were anonymous and the instructor was\nnot present during administration. Aggregate mean scores\nfor each self-report measure as well as inspection of repre-\nsentative items from the student and instructor behavior\nmeasure and the course format and content measure were\nused to compare student opinions and experiences at the end\nof the semester.\nResults and Discussion\nThe purpose of this research is to evaluate and compare\ncontract grading and traditional points-based grading sys-\ntems on course performance and preferences among college\nfreshmen in a contemporary classroom. Categorical data for\nboth groups were summarized with percentages and com-\npared between groups using the relative risk (RR) ratio.\nStudents in the Contract Grading Group (60%) were 3 times\nmore likely than those in the Traditional Grading Group\nContract Grading students (15%) were one third as likely\ncourse withdrawal or failing grades than Traditional Grading\nFor the nine-item teaching evaluation for which students\n\"graded\" the instructor's performance and the course, the\naverage grade was approximately one half of a letter grade\nhigher for the contract grading class (M = 3.61 on a 4-point\nscale) than for the traditional grading class, M = 3.21.\nQuantitative data were summarized with group means and\ncompared using independent-samples t tests. Students in the\nContract Grading Group consistently rated the instructor's\nand their behaviors toward the course more favorably. All 23\nbehaviors described on the first questionnaire received higher\naverage endorsements by the Contract Grading Group than\nthe Traditional Grading Group. And, averaged across the 23\nitems, this difference amounted to a mean rating that was 1.45\nstandard deviations higher for the Contract Grading Group\n(M = 4.51, SD = 0.58) than for the Traditional Grading Group\nof Figure 1 displays the mean ratings for six representative\nitemsandanaggregatescorefortheentirescale.Representative\nbehavior items were selected based with emphasis on likely\nareas of both similarity and differences between the Contract\nGrading and Traditional Grading Groups. As both groups\nreceived the same exams, for instance, little differences were\nexpected to the item \"Course exams related to the material\";\nin contrast, larger differences were expected for items related\nto clarity of expectations (e.g., \"Student responsibilities\nclearly defined\" or \"Class and assignments clearly orga-\nnized\"). The average item-total correlation, using Fisher's\n(1921) r-to-z conversion, for the six representative items were\nhigher (mean interitem r = .82, range = .28-.93) than those for\nitems that were not selected (mean r = .67, range = .04-.91).\nA similar pattern emerged for the 12 statements regard-\ning the course format and content (see bottom half of\nFigure 1) where the average difference was nearly one\nstandard deviation (d = 0.97) higher for Contract Grading\nFigure 1 also includes scores for six representative format\nand content items. As before, representative items were\nselected based on likely sources of difference between the\nContract Grading and Traditional Grading Groups, and the\naverage item-total correlations, following Fisher's (1921)\nr-to-z conversions, were higher among the representative\nitems (mean r = .79, range = .50-.90) than nonrepresentative\nWhen asked about the extent to which they felt in control\nover their grades, 67% of students in the Contract Grading\nGroup reported a 9 or 10 (the maximum on the response\nscale was 10, \"almost entirely in control\") compared with\nonly 23% of those in the Traditional Grading Group, RR =\nrange of the scale, however, the mean ratings were similar\nfor both groups (Contract Grading: M = 8.5, SD = 2.18;\n0.67, p = .51. Inspection of the response distributions for\nboth groups revealed that, although the majority of Contract\nGrading students indicated a maximum or near maximum\namount of control of their grades, two contract grading stu-\ndents (13%) indicated less control (i.e., 3 or 4) than any of\nthe traditional grading students, for which a response of 6\nwas the lowest.\nTo summarize briefly, students in the Contract Grading\nGroup were one third as likely to fail or withdraw, 3 times more\nlikely to earn an A grade, and, in general, were more likely to\n4 SAGE Open\nFigure 1.

In addition,\nthose in the Contract Grading Group consistently rated their\neffort, the course, and the instructor more favorably.\nThese findings indicate that contract grading is applicable\nto and effective in a contemporary college classroom, among\ntoday's college students. In addition, contract grading was\nimplemented with few changes to the preexisting material.\nThe methodology employed allows a direct comparison\nbetween contract grading and traditional points-based grad-\ning systems. The nature of contract grading required\nLindemann and Harbke 5\nvariation in key course and evaluation components (e.g.,\nstudent selection of assignments). Most notably, contract\ngrading permitted multiple attempts to achieve the mastery\ncriterion on assignments. Although this presents a funda-\nmental methodological confound, the reliance on mastery\ngrading criteria is a key feature of contract grading, and\none-shot assessments are ubiquitous in traditional grading\napproaches. As such, for the purposes of this evaluation, we\nelected to implement both grading systems as they are most\ntypically employed in the classroom (i.e., mastery grading\nwith multiple attempts for contract grading students and\nsingle-shot assessments for traditional grading students).\nThe findings as described above should be viewed in consid-\neration of this methodological limitation.\nThe use of both grading systems during the same semes-\nter introduces a possible alternative explanation for the\npresent findings. It is possible that traditional grading\nstudents became aware that contract grading students\nwere able to select their own assignments, held to a mas-\ntery criterion, and were permitted to resubmit course\nassignments, including retaking exams. Awareness of the\nevaluation differences between course sections may have\ndemoralized those students assigned to the Traditional\nGrading Group and manifested in reduced motivation and\neffort toward the course, course assignments, or in their\nevaluation of the course on the self-report measures. As\nassignment to the Contract or Traditional Grading Groups\nwas determined by course section and the instructor did\nnot share the details of the other grading system with the\nstudents, methodological efforts were employed to mini-\nmize this and other forms of participant reactivity.\nMoreover, as FYE courses maintain small class sizes, the\n40 students from the present evaluation represent a small\nproportion of the total introductory psychology enrollment\nthat semester (<5%). Because of the low proportion of\ntotal introductory psychology students who were enrolled\nin the contract grading section (<2.5%), it is unlikely,\nalbeit still possible, that contract grading students shared\nthe details of their grading system with the other 2.5% of\nstudents who were assigned to the Traditional Grading\nGroup in this evaluation. Despite some inherent differ-\nences between the evaluation components of the contract\ngrading and tradition grading systems, it should be noted\nthat instructor, graduate student grader, class day, course\nmaterials, assignments and exams, and college year were\nall held constant.\nThese findings echo those from previous contract grad-\ning studies. For example, consistent with Kirschenbaum\nand Wetter Riechmann (1975), higher course evaluation\nscores were reported by participants in the contract grad-\ning course. And, consistent with past research on perfor-\nmance criteria (see Johnston & O'Neill, 1973; Semb,\n1974), participants in the Contract Grading Group earned\nhigher grades than those in the Traditional Grading Group;\nas such, the contract grading students appeared to have\nmatched their performance with the higher criteria for\nearning a passing grade on each assignment (i.e., 85%).\nContract graded students in this study also self-reported\ngreater perceived control over their own grade, which fol-\nlows a myriad of studies (Grau, 1999; Kirschenbaum &\nsecondary measures (i.e., self-report measures related to the\ncourse, instructor, and student effort) were summarized\nwith averages for brevity in the analyses. Nonetheless,\nsome key differences found in the literature between\ntraditional and contract grading are evident from com-\nparing responses to the individual items described in\nFigure 1. For example, contract grading students indi-\ncated higher ratings for working hard for their grade,\nenjoying the course format, and for enhancing indepen-\ndent thinking. In addition, other items, not displayed in\nFigure 1, show a similar pattern as depicted by the aggre-\ngate score.\nThe outcome measures for the current comparison were\nlimited to course grades and retention, students'self-reported\nperceived control over their grades, and course and teacher\nevaluations. There are a variety of potentially interesting\ndependent variables suitable for future research. One exam-\nple is student effort, perhaps operationalized as time spent\npreparing for exams.Although there is evidence that contract\ngrading may in fact increase motivation and effort (e.g.,\nBunn Hiller & Hietapelto, 2001), in the present study, some\nstudents in the Contract Grading Group may have prepared\nless for the first attempt on each exam knowing that they\ncould repeat the exam a couple of days later. Although the\nmajority of contract grading students perceived more control\nover their grade than their counterparts in the Traditional\nGrading Group, this perception was not universal. In fact,\ntwo contract grading students reported less control than any\nof the traditional grading students. This difference suggests\nimportant differences in individual student's reactions to and\nexperiences with contract grading. As such, analysis of the\nindividual differences in the effect of contract grading and its\nimpact on individual student performance is needed to fur-\nther explore this. The benefits of contract grading among\nupper division students should also be explored, as it is pos-\nsible that contract grading is even more beneficial among\nolder students, given the growth that often occurs during col-\nlege. And, a meta-analysis of research on contract grading,\nwhich has not yet been done, may draw much-needed atten-\ntion to the effectiveness of this and other alternative grading\nprocedures.\nIn conclusion, the authors encourage faculty to consider\nincorporating contract grading into their college courses.\nBased on the present study, contract grading systems may\nlead to higher grades, increased sense of control, and more\npositive experiences with the course from the student's\nperspective.\n6 SAGE Open\nAppendix\nIntroductory Psychology Grade Contract\nName: ______________________________________ Student ID#: _______________________\nPlease circle the grade you would like to earn in this class: A B C D F\nIf you want to earn an A: Pass 4 exams (80% or higher), 3 writing selections, and 3 activity selections.\nIf you want to earn a B: Pass 4 exams (80% or higher), 2 writing selections, and 3 activity selections.\nIf you want to earn a C: Pass 4 exams (75% or higher), 1 writing selection, and 3 activity selections.\nIf you want to earn a D: Pass 4 exams (75% or higher), 1 writing selection, and 2 activity selections.\nIf you want to earn a F: Fail to meet the minimum criteria for a passing (D) grade.\nWriting Selections\n(choose 3 for an A, choose 2 for a B,\nchoose 1 for a C or D; please check\nthe box next to your choices)\nAssignments Completed\n(Only list assignments submitted on-time and\nreceiving a passing grade)\nCheck\nWhen\nDone\n Complete 3 \"Applying Psychology\"\nreaction papers (1 page per\nreaction paper)\n________ ________ ________ \n Complete 3 \"Applying Psychology\"\nreaction papers (1 page per\nreaction paper)\n________ ________ ________ \n Complete a poster presentation\nof a psychology research study\n(done with a partner)\n______________________________ \n Design and describe a psychology\nstudy\n(3 page paper)\n______________________________ \nActivity Selections\n(choose 3 for an A, B, or C, or choose\n2 for a D;\nplease check the box next to your\nchoices)\nAssignments Completed(Only list assignments\nsubmitted on-time and receiving a passing\ngrade)\nCheck\nWhen\nDone\n Complete 10 in-class activities _____ _____ _____ _____ __________ _____\n_____ _____ _____\n\n Make a 10-min in-class presentation\n(done as a pair or small group)\n_______________________________ \n Attend two out-of-class FirstYear\nExperience events\n_______________ _______________ \n Complete 4 research experience\ncredits\n______ ______ ______ ______ \nExams (Circle each exam meeting the\nSigned by: ______________________________ ________________________________\n(Student) (Instructor)\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to\nthe research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nLindemann and Harbke 7\nReferences\nBunn Hiller, T., & Hietapelto, A.
