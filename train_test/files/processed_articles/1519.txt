Introduction\nCigarette smoke inhaled by a smoker contains more than 4,000 chemicals [1], and second hand\nsmoke (SHS) is qualitatively similar [1]. Metals in tobacco smoke are of public health concern because\nof their potential toxicity and carcinogenicity [2]. Some are linked to adverse health outcomes such as\ncardiovascular and renal disease and impaired lung function among smokers [3-7]. Because the dose of\ntoxic chemicals received by a smoker is an important factor in the harm caused by tobacco, analysis of\nthe National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) exposure data suggests promising\ncandidate chemicals for determining whether reductions of certain toxic constituents in cigarettes and\ncigarette smoke translate into reductions in active and passive smokers' exposure to these substances.\nPrevention of tobacco use and SHS exposure remains a critically important public health priority.\nThe Surgeon General recently concluded that there is no safe level of SHS exposure [1,8]. Although\nsignificant progress has been made to reduce SHS exposure, nearly half (46.4%) of U.S. nonsmokers\nremain exposed [9].\nThe NHANES is a vital source of population-level exposure data for environmental pollutants,\nincluding tobacco smoke. Population-level data is important to assess the magnitude of various\nexposures and the impact of laws and policies aimed at tobacco use and SHS exposure [2,10]. All 12\nof the metals in this study (antimony (Sb), barium (Ba), beryllium (Be), cadmium (Cd), cesium (Cs),\ncobalt (Co), lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), molybdenum (Mo), platinum (Pt), thallium (Tl), and\ntungsten (W)) have been reported in tobacco smoke [11,12]. Some metals, such as cadmium and lead,\nare widely recognized for their toxicity and tendency to accumulate in the body [13,14]. While noting\nthat no one threshold for all adverse effects from lead exposure has been demonstrated, and that the\navailable evidence has important limitations including the small number of studies of peak blood lead\nlevels below 10 \u00b5g/dL in children never known to have a blood lead level exceeding 10 \u00b5g/dL, the\nCDC has concluded that the data demonstrates that no level of lead in a child's blood can be specified\nas safe [15,16]. Other metals, such as cobalt, have beneficial or harmful effects, depending on the level\nThis study examined levels of urinary metals among cigarette smoke exposed and not exposed\nNHANES participants. Unlike previous studies that focused on a select few metals [5,6], we included\n12 metals to provide population-level, baseline exposure data for a large number of potentially toxic\nmetals. We analyzed urine data because, while influenced by pharmacokinetics, urine measurements\nare a useful noninvasive approach in biomonitoring research of exposures to metals and other\nenvironmental pollutants [18-21]. The findings from this study contribute to the limited information\navailable regarding exposure to potentially toxic metals in tobacco smoke. By analyzing data for both\nactive and passive smokers, we provide information to strengthen public health messages regarding\nquitting smoking, to increase awareness of the dangers of SHS exposure, and the need for strategies to\nfurther reduce SHS exposure.\n2. Results and Discussion\nThe unweighted sample by demographic characteristic is presented for all metals (Table 1).\nApproximately equal numbers of males and females are present among participants and most were\nabove the poverty threshold.\nTable 1.

Mexican American nonsmokers did not have an increase in urine lead across the exposure\ngroups.\nAcross all levels of smoke exposure, non-Hispanic blacks (nonsmokers p < 0.001; nonsmokerslow\nunadjusted lead levels than non-Hispanic whites. After adjusting for creatinine content, some\ndifferences remained among Mexican American nonsmokers (p < 0.001), nonsmokerslow\nAdjusted and unadjusted lead levels in male smokers were higher than in male nonsmokers\n(p < 0.001). In female smokers, only the unadjusted level was higher than nonsmokers (p < 0.001). In\ngeneral, unadjusted levels were significantly lower in females than males. Female nonsmokers,\nhowever, had significantly higher adjusted levels than male nonsmokers (p < 0.001).\nWhen considering poverty status, adjusted and unadjusted lead levels of smokers above the poverty\nthreshold were higher than levels in nonsmokers (p < 0.001). Nonsmokerslow\nabove the poverty\nthreshold had higher urine lead levels than nonsmokers above the poverty threshold (adjusted; p < 0.05\nand unadjusted p < 0.01). For smokers below the poverty threshold, only the unadjusted urine lead\nlevel was higher than the level in nonsmokers (p < 0.05). Nonsmokers below the poverty threshold did\nnot have an increase in urine lead across the exposure groups.\nOur findings show that some metals are increased (e.g., cadmium and lead, and antimony and\nbarium [unadjusted]) in smokers, while others are lower (e.g., mercury, beryllium, cesium, cobalt,\nmolybdenum, platinum, and thallium [adjusted]) or unchanged (tungsten). In general, metals are\nabsorbed in the lung, tend to persist in the body with half-lives of years to decades, and most are\nexcreted through the kidneys and gastrointestinal tract [22]. So it is plausible that nontrivial exposures\nwill be detectable in urine. Consequently, our findings of lower or unchanged urine levels suggest that,\nfor the general population, cigarette smoke is not a major environmental source of exposure to\nmercury, beryllium, cesium, cobalt, molybdenum, platinum, thallium, or tungsten.\nLead and cadmium are emphasized because of their well established toxicity and tendency to\naccumulate in the body [13,14]. It is therefore particularly noteworthy that the highest lead levels were\namong nonsmokershigh\n6\u00ad12 years, the youngest in our study population. It may be that the youth-adult\ndisparity in SHS exposure, which has increased since the early 1990s [9], is contributing to children's\nlead levels. This hypothesis is supported by others' observations of high blood lead levels in children\nof smoking parents [3]. It has been suggested that smoking's contribution to lead levels has become\nincreasingly relevant as gasoline lead emissions have declined [3]. We found that, with few exceptions,\nadult nonsmokershigh\nand smokers had similarly high lead levels. Thus, while other potential sources of\nlead exposure were not assessed, our findings suggest that SHS exposure may be sufficient to produce\na measurable, dose-dependent increase in lead levels. We also observed that only SHS-exposed\nnonsmokers above the poverty threshold had elevated urine lead. This suggests that tobacco smoke is\nan important source of lead exposure for those with higher household income and raises questions\nabout other environmental exposures, across income and socioeconomic levels. Future studies of SHS-\nexposed children should be designed to address the possible contribution of early childhood\nenvironmental exposures to lead.\nWe also observed high barium and antimony in smokers compared to nonsmokers. As with\ncadmium and lead, barium and antimony are present in cigarette smoke [11,12]. Animal studies\nindicate that inhaled barium is primarily excreted in the feces [23]. In contrast, cadmium and absorbed\nlead are eliminated primarily in the urine [13,24]. Although only unadjusted barium was significantly\nelevated, the finding raises mechanistic considerations. For example, the amount of barium received by\na smoker may exceed the normal renal capacity for tubular reabsorption through common competitive\ntranscellular pathways [25] when exposure occurs in the presence of other divalent metals (e.g.,\ncadmium). Kidney effects are the most sensitive endpoint following chronic barium exposure in\nlaboratory animals [26] and one possible area of research is to investigate barium as a direct renal\ntoxicant in smokers. Cadmium and lead are renal toxicants in humans and cadmium urine\nconcentrations increase after kidney damage [25,27]. Renal tubular toxicity and low bone density are\nreported at urine cadmium levels as low as 1 \u00b5g/g [21,28]. Cadmium levels among older smokers in\nour study approach this level. Consequently, elevated urine barium among smokers may reflect\ndecreased tubular reabsorption in a kidney damaged by exposure to cadmium or other metals.\nAntimony is excreted in the urine and feces [29]. Occupational and animal studies have reported\nrespiratory and cardiovascular effects from inhalation of antimony compounds [29]. A recent study\nreported a sharp increase in risk of peripheral artery disease in individuals with low urine antimony\nlevels below 0.1 \u00b5g/L and a persistent elevated risk above 0.1 \u00b5g/L compared with those with urine\nantimony at the limit of detection [7]. In our study, unadjusted urine antimony levels increased across\nexposure groups with smokers having the highest level of 0.13 \u00b5g/L. Oxidative stress is proposed to\nplay a role in the toxicity and carcinogenicity of some metals (including cadmium, lead, and antimony)\nin tobacco smoke [30].\nThere are inverse relations between smoking and levels of important nutrients, independent of\ndietary intake [31]. We observed that smokers had significantly lower cobalt and molybdenum\n(adjusted) than nonsmokers. Our findings are similar to those reported for current vs. former or never\nsmokers [32]. While human cobalt deficiencies have not been reported, cobalt is a component of\nand smoking interferes with absorption of vitamin B12\nfor oxidoreductases such as xanthine oxidase [33]. Molybdenum-deficient soil has been considered a\npossible factor in regions with high rates of esophageal cancer [34,35]. An area of possible research is\nthe relation between smoking, reduced levels of essential elements, and smoking-related morbidities\nand co-morbidities. Additional research is needed to determine if smokers have reduced cobalt and\nmolybdenum due to dietary deficiencies or independent of other potentially confounding variables.\nOur study is subject to several possible limitations. First, because our nonsmoker definition\nconsisted of those that reported not smoking in the last five days, the upper ranges of SHS-exposed\nnonsmokers may include recent quitters and it is also possible that SHS-exposed nonsmokers included\nmisidentified occasional smokers whose cotinine levels can overlap with SHS-exposed\nnonsmokers [36]. Dual characterization of nonsmoker status by self-report and serum cotinine\neliminated nonsmokers with cotinine > 10 ng/mL. If the cotinine measurement condition is omitted\nfrom our nonsmoker definition, the estimated number of nonsmokers would increase by only 1%.\nOther potential confounders not considered in our analyses are dietary sources of metals, hobbies\ninvolving metals, lead paint in the home, urban residence, or occupation. Information on some of these\npotential confounders (e.g., hobbies involving metals) is not available for the NHANES population.\nCompared with workers in some industries, however, the prevalence of elevated exposures to metals\nsuch as lead, cadmium, or antimony in the general population is low and occupational exposure in the\nNHANES population is expected to be rare [7]. Consequently, an assumption in our study is that while\nthese potential confounders may differentially impact population groups--in particular those of lower\nsocioeconomic status--for lead, the impact is likely minimal given the few variations observed in\ncomparisons of those above and below the poverty threshold. Confounding from other potential\nsources of metal exposure should be carefully addressed in studies concerned with causality.\nThe representative nature of the data was an important strength as this enables some generalizability\nof the results. For example, we observed higher adjusted cadmium for females for all exposure groups\nand, like others [21], also higher levels in females in the overall sample. Additionally, including 6\nyears of data, including the over-sampling of Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic blacks, allowed\nadequate power for race/ethnicity comparisons. We found racial/ethnic differences in cadmium and\nlead. For example, non-Hispanic white nonsmokerslow\nhad higher adjusted cadmium than did non-\nHispanic blacks or Mexican Americans. Also, nonsmoking Mexican Americans with no or low SHS\nexposure had higher lead than non-Hispanic whites. Non-Hispanic blacks had the highest unadjusted\nlead in the overall sample, amongst nonsmokershigh\n, and smokers. After adjustment, the differences\nwere no longer significant. This observation may be explained by the significantly greater creatinine\nconcentrations among non-Hispanic blacks than non-Hispanic whites or Mexican Americans [37].\nAdjusting for creatinine content resulted in differences across exposure groups becoming significant\nfor 6 metals: mercury, beryllium, cesium, cobalt, platinum, and thallium. Presenting both adjusted and\nunadjusted concentrations illustrates the importance of considering the appropriateness of creatinine\ncorrection based on the study population and the research questions.\nBlood lead measurements are preferred to evaluate lead exposure [21]. Thus, a second limitation of\nthe study is that urine lead measurements are more variable than blood levels [21]. It is possible that\nblood lead with less intra-individual variability may show different patterns in smoke-exposed\nindividuals. In contrast, urine cadmium is a more reliable measure of chronic cadmium exposure than\nblood cadmium [7].\nAlthough our study addresses 12 metals previously reported in tobacco smoke, it is not an\nexhaustive analysis of all metals in tobacco smoke. Data for several toxicologically-important\nchemicals (e.g., chromium, nickel, and arsenic) are not available for all waves of NHANES data in this\nstudy. Additionally, NHANES urine metals data are not available for children younger than 6 years.\nFinally, the study does not consider co-morbidities such as decreased renal function.\nFor some metals (e.g., mercury and thallium), our data suggest that tobacco smoke is not a\nsignificant source of exposure because levels were higher among nonsmokers than smokers.\nCounterfeit cigarettes can contain higher levels of toxic metals (e.g., cadmium, lead, and thallium) than\nlegal cigarettes [38]. Consequently, consumption of counterfeit cigarettes or cigarettes with tobacco\ngrown in sludge amended soil may exacerbate the problem [39].\n3. Experimental Section\nAll data were obtained from the NHANES series conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention's (CDC's) National Center for Health Statistics (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm).\nNHANES is representative of civilian, noninstitutionalized residents of the United States 2 months or\nanalysis file was limited to respondents who completed the health examination component of the\nsurvey, those with serum cotinine, urine creatinine, and the urine metals antimony, barium, beryllium,\ncadmium, cesium, cobalt, lead, mercury, molybdenum, platinum, thallium, and tungsten\nmeasurements, and those that responded to tobacco questions. Urine metals were measured for\nparticipants 6 years or older. The tobacco questions were asked of respondents 12 years or older.\nThe final analysis file contained 6,312 respondents with the laboratory measurements, smoker or\nnonsmoker status based on responses to the tobacco questions and serum cotinine levels (further\ndescribed below), and a valid (nonzero) weight variable. The development of the analysis file is\npresented in Figure 1.\nFigure 1. Analytic sample.\nRespondents 12 years or older who answered No to the question, During the past 5 days, did you\nuse any product containing nicotine including cigarettes, pipes, cigars, chewing tobacco, snuff,\nnicotine patches, nicotine gum, or any other product containing nicotine were considered nontobacco\nusers. Any participant younger than 12 years was considered a nontobacco user, but was excluded if\ntheir cotinine was  10 ng/ml because nonsmokers in NHANES have been defined by others [40] as\npersons with serum cotinine < 10 ng/mL. Self-reported nontobacco users 12 years or older with a\ncotinine measurement  10 ng/mL were also excluded from the analyses. A nonsmoker was defined as\na self-reported nontobacco user with a cotinine measurement < 10 ng/mL. Nineteen self-reported\nnonsmokers in the final analytic sample had cotinine levels above 10 ng/mL and were excluded.\nSmokers were defined as respondents 12 years or older whose only direct source of nicotine\nexposure was cigarettes. Smokers were those who answered Yes to the question, During the past 5\ndays, did you use any product containing nicotine including cigarettes, pipes, cigars, chewing tobacco,\nsnuff, nicotine patches, nicotine gum, or any other product containing nicotine and did not use non-\ncigarette sources of nicotine as indicated by answering No to additional questions asking if they\nsmoked pipes, cigars, used chewing tobacco, snuff or other nicotine products in the past 5 days.\nSmokers that used other non-cigarette sources of nicotine were excluded.\nFor cotinine levels below the level of detection, we used an estimated value of 0.035 ng/mL (i.e.,\nlevel of detection, 0.050 ng/mL, divided by the square root of 2) when calculating geometric mean\nurine levels following procedures outlined in previous research [41]. Due to the highly skewed nature\nof cotinine levels in the study population [40], the geometric mean of cotinine, 0.256 ng/mL, was\nchosen as the cutoff point to define low and high SHS exposures. Exposure was categorized into four\nlevels: self-identified, unexposed nonsmokers (nonsmokers) -- nonsmokers with\ncotinine  0.035 ng/mL; nonsmokers with low SHS exposure (nonsmokerslow\n) -- nonsmokers with\ncotinine > 0.035 ng/mL and  0.256 ng/mL; nonsmokers with high SHS exposure (nonsmokershigh\n) --\nParticipants with lab\nmeasures AND\ntobacco questions or\nParticipants without\nlab measures OR\ntobacco questions:\nParticipants age 6\nAND with health\nParticipants without\ncotinine measure for\nParticipants with\ncotinine measure\nOR nonsmokers:\nParticipants whose\nself-reports are\ninconsistent with\ncotinine cut point (10\nParticipants categorized\nParticipants categorized\nNHANES participants\nParticipants age < 6\nOR without health\nnonsmokers with cotinine > 0.256 ng/mL and  10 ng/mL; and smokers--self-identified cigarette\nsmokers with cotinine > 10 ng/mL. 146 self-reported smokers in the final analytic sample had cotinine\nlevels below 10 ng/mL.\nParticipants who described themselves as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and\nMexican American were assessed and findings for these racial/ethnic subgroups are presented.\nOther race/ethnicity, were included in total population estimates but were not presented due to the\nsmall number of participants in this category.

The poverty threshold was used as an indicator of socioeconomic status (SES). As reported in\nprevious NHANES research [42], poverty is a useful indicator of SES because, unlike other indicators\nof SES like education or occupation, it provides a comparable measure of SES across a broad range of\nages.\nBiological samples (blood and urine) were collected during a standardized physical examination\nconducted in a mobile examination center (MEC) and stored cold or frozen until laboratory analyses\nwere conducted. Serum cotinine was measured by a high-performance liquid\nchromatography/atmospheric-pressure ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) method that\nhas been described previously [43]. Urine metals were measured by inductively coupled plasma-mass\nspectrometry as described previously [44]. Urine creatinine was measured using an automated\ncolorimetric determination based on a modified Jaffe reaction [37]. Further descriptions of sample\ncollection and laboratory methods for cotinine, creatinine, and the metals are available at:\nhttp://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm. Two sets of urine metal measures were created. One is the metal\nconcentration adjusted for the creatinine content of the urine (\u00b5g/g creatinine) (adjusted). Creatinine\ncorrection adjusts for urine dilution and is typically performed with spot urine samples [37]. The other\nis the unadjusted urine metal concentration (\u00b5g/L) (unadjusted). Creatinine correction is commonly\nused in homogeneous populations; however, multiple demographic groups, such as in this study,\ncorrected for molybdenum oxide interference. The correction resulted in corrected values less than\nzero being assigned a value of zero (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/frequency/\nlab06hm_doc.pdf). There were 49 cases with zero values in the final analytic sample. All zero values\nwere set to missing in the analysis file to insure proper generation of the geometric mean.\nWe calculated estimates using the sub-sampling weights to represent nonsmokers  6 years and\n16\u00ad49 years. Starting in 2003, urine mercury was measured for males and females  6 years. For\nconsistency across all 3 waves of data, the mercury analysis only included data for females\nSampling weights provide population estimates that adjust for unequal probabilities of selection and\naccount for nonresponses. The weights were post-stratified to the U.S. population as estimated by the\nCensus Bureau. For use with multi-wave data, we calculated analytic survey weight following the\nNHANES documentation provided on their website. Specifically, this involved taking 2/3 of the\nanalyses, we used SAS (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) and SUDAAN (Research Triangle Institute,\nResearch Triangle Park, NC)--a program that adjusts for complex sample design when variance\nestimates are calculated.\nEstimates for the geometric mean, with 95% confidence intervals, were calculated by demographic\ncharacteristic and for each exposure level. A linear regression analysis was then used to identify metals\nwhose geometric mean is significantly different between the exposure groups, with log transformations\nof adjusted or unadjusted metal concentrations as the dependent variable and exposure group as the\nindependent variable. If an overall difference was significant between the groups, t-tests were\nperformed to identify the specific difference(s) for exposure group pairs. T-test comparisons for\nparticipants 12 years or older were nonsmoker vs. nonsmokerlow\n, nonsmokerlow\nvs. nonsmokerhigh\n,\nnonsmokerhigh\nvs. smoker and nonsmoker vs. smoker. For children 6\u00ad11 years, t-test comparisons\nwere nonsmoker vs. nonsmokerlow\n, nonsmokerlow\nvs. nonsmokerhigh\n and nonsmoker vs.\nnonsmokerhigh\n. Additional analyses were performed to examine differences in cadmium or lead levels\nacross race/ethnicity and between genders. The comparison reference group for race/ethnicity is non-\nHispanic white and for gender is male. Bonferroni correction was used to control the type I errors on\nmultiple comparisons.\n4. Conclusions\nThe U.S. Surgeon General's recent declaration of no risk-free level of SHS exposure [1]\nunderscores the importance of characterizing active and passive exposures to harmful tobacco smoke\nconstituents. Some chemicals, notably cadmium and lead, will accumulate in the body. Our findings\nshow SHS-exposed children, a population particularly vulnerable to the toxic effects of lead at low\nlevels of exposure [15,16] have higher levels of urine lead than children without SHS exposure. Urine\nlead levels respond rapidly to changes in body lead and increase with increasing lead exposure [46]\nand our findings suggest the need for confirmatory study of blood lead levels among SHS exposed\nyouth. Older smokers in our study had cadmium levels high enough to raise concerns that they are at\nrisk for cadmium-related toxicity. Thus, our findings indicate that active and passive smoking should\nbe considered in future investigations to ascertain the role of metals in the disease process. This\nfinding is especially relevant for some minorities and socio-economically disadvantaged groups [47].\n"
