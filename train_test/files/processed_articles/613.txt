There\nis no systematic method to determine the accuracy of a criminal\nconviction; if there were, these errors would not occur in the first\nplace. As a result, very few false convictions are ever discovered,\nand those that are discovered are not representative of the group\nas a whole. In the United States, however, a high proportion of\nfalse convictions that do come to light and produce exonerations\nare concentrated among the tiny minority of cases in which\ndefendants are sentenced to death. This makes it possible to use\ndata on death row exonerations to estimate the overall rate of\nfalse conviction among death sentences. The high rate of exoner-\nation among death-sentenced defendants appears to be driven by\nthe threat of execution, but most death-sentenced defendants are\nremoved from death row and resentenced to life imprisonment,\nafter which the likelihood of exoneration drops sharply. We use\nsurvival analysis to model this effect, and estimate that if all\ndeath-sentenced defendants remained under sentence of death\nindefinitely, at least 4.1% would be exonerated. We conclude that\nthis is a conservative estimate of the proportion of false conviction\namong death sentences in the United States.\ncapital punishment | criminal justice | wrongful conviction\nIn the past few decades a surge of hundreds of exonerations\nof innocent criminal defendants has drawn attention to the\nproblem of erroneous conviction, and led to a spate of reforms in\ncriminal investigation and adjudication (1\u00ad3). All the same, the\nmost basic empirical question about false convictions remains\nunanswered: How common are these miscarriages of justice?\nFalse convictions, by definition, are unobserved when they\noccur: If we know that a defendant is innocent, he is not con-\nvicted in the first place. They are also extremely difficult to de-\ntect after the fact. As a result, the great majority of innocent\ndefendants remain undetected. The rate of such errors is often\ndescribed as a \"dark figure\" (4)--an important measure of the\nperformance of the criminal justice system that is not merely\nunknown but unknowable.\nHowever, there is no shortage of lawyers and judges who as-\nsert confidently that the number of false convictions is negligible.\nJudge Learned Hand said so in 1923: \"Our [criminal] procedure\nhas always been haunted by the ghost of the innocent man\nAntonin Scalia wrote in a concurring opinion in the Supreme\nCourt that American criminal convictions have an \"error rate of\n[0].027 percent--or, to put it another way, a success rate of\nfact, the claim is silly. Scalia's ratio is derived by taking the\nnumber of known exonerations at the time, which were limited\nalmost entirely to a small subset of murder and rape cases, using\nit as a measure of all false convictions (known and unknown),\nand dividing it by the number of all felony convictions for all\ncrimes, from drug possession and burglary to car theft and in-\ncome tax evasion.\nTo actually estimate the proportion of erroneous convictions\nwe need a well-defined group of criminal convictions within\nwhich we identify all mistaken convictions, or at least most. It is\nhard to imagine how that could be done for criminal convictions\ngenerally, but it might be possible for capital murder.\nThe rate of exonerations among death sentences in the United\nStates is far higher than for any other category of criminal con-\nvictions. Death sentences represent less than one-tenth of 1% of\nprison sentences in the United States (7), but they accounted for\nabout 12% of known exonerations of innocent defendants from\nA major reason for this extraordinary exoneration rate is that far\nmore attention and resources are devoted to death penalty cases\nthan to other criminal prosecutions, before and after conviction.\nThe vast majority of criminal convictions are not candidates\nfor exoneration because no one makes any effort to reconsider\nthe guilt of the defendants. Approximately 95% of felony con-\nvictions in the United States are based on negotiated pleas of\nguilty (plea bargains) that are entered in routine proceedings at\nwhich no evidence is presented. Few are ever subject to any re-\nview whatsoever. Most convicted defendants are never repre-\nsented by an attorney after conviction, and the appeals that\ndo take place are usually perfunctory and unrelated to guilt\nor innocence.\nDeath sentences are different. Almost all are based on con-\nvictions after jury trial, and even the handful of capital defend-\nants who plead guilty are then subject to trial-like-sentencing\nhearings, usually before juries. All death sentences are reviewed\non appeal; almost all are reviewed repeatedly. With few excep-\ntions, capital defendants have lawyers as long as they remain on\ndeath row. Everyone, from the first officer on the scene of\na potentially capital crime to the Chief Justice of the United\nStates, takes capital cases more seriously than other criminal\nprosecutions--and knows that everybody else will do so as well.\nAnd everyone from defense lawyers to innocence projects to\ngovernors and state and federal judges is likely to be particularly\ncareful to avoid the execution of innocent defendants.\nThis extraordinary difference in resources and attention gen-\nerates two related effects. (i) Advocates for a defendant are\nmuch more likely to pursue any plausible postconviction claim of\ninnocence if the defendant is under sentence of death. (ii) Courts\nSignificance\nThe rate of erroneous conviction of innocent criminal defend-\nants is often described as not merely unknown but unknow-\nable. We use survival analysis to model this effect, and estimate\nthat if all death-sentenced defendants remained under sentence\nof death indefinitely at least 4.1% would be exonerated. We\nconclude that this is a conservative estimate of the proportion of\nfalse conviction among death sentences in the United States.\nAuthor contributions: S.R.G. and B.O. designed research; S.R.G. and B.O. performed\nresearch; C.H. and E.H.K. analyzed data; and S.R.G. and B.O. wrote the paper.\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.\n*This Direct Submission article had a prearranged editor.\nFreely available online through the PNAS open access option.\n1To whom correspondence may be addressed.

If\nso, we can use capital exonerations as a basis for estimating a\nlower bound for the false conviction rate among death sentences.\nSince 1973, when the first death penalty laws now in effect\nin the United States were enacted (8), 143 death-sentenced\ndefendants have been exonerated, from 1 to 33 y after conviction\n(mean = 10.1 y) (9). In a previous study we found that 2.3% of all\nestimated that had biological samples been available for testing\nin all cases, 3.3% of defendants sentenced to death between 1982\nand 1989 for murders that included rape would have been ex-\nonerated by DNA evidence through February 2006. That esti-\nmate, however, is based on a small number of exonerations (n =\n11) (10). Both studies were limited to convictions that occurred\n15 y or more before the study date, and so include a high pro-\nportion of all exonerations that will ever occur in the relevant\ngroups. Nonetheless both studies underestimate the false con-\nviction rate for death-sentenced defendants because they do not\nreflect exonerations that occur after the study period, and do not\ninclude false convictions that are never detected at all.\nCapital defendants who are removed from death row but not\nexonerated--typically because their sentences are reduced to life\nimprisonment--no longer receive the extraordinary level of at-\ntention that is devoted to death row inmates. (This applies as\nwell to those who are executed or die on death row from other\ncauses.) If they are in fact innocent, they are much less likely to\nbe exonerated than if they had remained on death row. As a re-\nsult, the proportion of death-sentenced inmates who are exon-\nerated understates the rate of false convictions among death\nsentences because the intensive search for possible errors is\nlargely abandoned once the threat of execution is removed.\nIn other words, the engine that produces an exoneration rate\nthat is a plausible proxy for the rate of false conviction among\ndeath-sentenced prisoners is the process of reinvestigation and\nreconsideration under threat of execution. Over time, most\ndeath-sentenced inmates are removed from death row and\nresentenced to life in prison--at which point their chances of\nexoneration appear to drop back to the background rate for all\nmurders, or close to it. Thus, we will get a better estimate of the\nrate of false capital convictions if are able to estimate \"what the\nrate of capital exonerations would be if all death sentences were\nsubject for an indefinite period to the level of scrutiny that\napplies to those facing the prospect of execution\" (7). This study\ndoes just that.\nCurrent Study\nData. We examine exonerations among defendants sentenced to\ndeath from the beginning of the \"modern\" death penalty in the\nUnited States in 1973, after the Supreme Court invalidated all\nprior death sentencing laws (11), through the end of 2004. Our\ndata come from two sources. (i) Death sentences since 1973 are\ntracked by the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) of the De-\npartment of Justice, which maintains data on the current status\nof all death-sentenced defendants in that period (12). We know\nthat 7,482 defendants were sentenced to death in the United\nwhen (if ever) each defendant was removed from death row by\nexecution, death by other means, or legal action by courts or\nexecutive officials. (ii) The Death Penalty Information Center\nmaintains a list of defendants who were sentenced to death in the\nUnited States and exonerated since the beginning of 1973 (13),\nand exonerated by legal proceedings that began before the end\nof 2004. We collected additional data on these cases from public\nrecords and media sources, expanding on the dataset used by\nGross and O'Brien (7). We were able to match on several key\nvariables 108 of the 117 death sentence exonerations in this\nperiod to specific cases in the BJS database to produce the da-\ntabase we analyzed.\nTable 1 displays the status of the 7,482 death-sentenced\ndefendants we studied as of December 31, 2004, the final day of\nour study period. On that date, 12.6% of these defendants had\nbeen executed, 1.6% were exonerated, 4% died of suicide or\nnatural causes while on death row, 46.1% remained on death\nrow, and 35.8% were removed from death row but remained in\nprison after their capital sentences or the underlying convictions\nwere reversed or modified.\nTable 1 is a snapshot of the status of these defendants at the\nend of the study period. (It would look quite different if it dis-\nplayed the status of death-sentenced defendants at the end of\nmate the rate of exoneration because exonerations are a function\nof time. Many of the defendants on death row at the end of 2004\nhad only been there for a year or two, far less than the mean of\n10.1 y from conviction to exoneration for all capital exonerations\nOver time, many of those who remained on death row at the\nend of 2004 will be removed (or already have been); most will\nend up with sentences of life imprisonment. If the pattern for\nof prisoners sentenced to death will have the judgments against\nthem overturned. The majority will remain in prison for life (14,\n15), but some will be exonerated and released.\nThreat of Execution. A central variable of interest is whether an\nexoneration took place while the defendant was still under\nthreat of execution (for detailed information, see SI Materials and\nProportion of all cases Time on death row, y Time to release, y\nStatus as of December 31, 2004 Percent (n) Mean (SD) Mean (SD)\nNA, not applicable.\n*The defendant was exonerated by legal proceedings that were initiated before the end of 2004 and while the defendant was under\nsentence of death.\nThe defendant was exonerated by legal proceedings that were initiated before the end of 2004 but after the defendant was no longer\nunder sentence of death. Data from the Death Penalty Information Center (9) and the BJS of the US Department of Justice (12).\nMethods, section 1). The status of the defendant as under threat\nis obvious when a defendant is exonerated and released directly\nfrom death row. On the other side, a defendant is clearly not\nunder threat of execution when the exoneration is the product of\na process that began years after removal from death row.\nIn other cases, determining the threat status of the defendant\nat the time of exoneration is more demanding. We identify\ndefendants who were under threat of execution to focus on\nexonerations that benefited from the extraordinary levels of ef-\nfort and scrutiny that are applied to defendants who might be put\nto death. Many defendants who leave death row might be sent\nback. Hence the under-threat-of-execution category includes\ndefendants who were removed from death row but remained\neligible for resentencing to death, and in whose cases the pros-\necution was actively pursuing a new death sentence or consid-\nering whether to do so. For example, Ronald Williamson was\nsentenced to death in Oklahoma in 1988, and awarded a new\ntrial in 1997 because of constitutionally inadequate representa-\ntion by his trial lawyer (16). He was exonerated by DNA testing\n2 y later, in 1999, while awaiting a retrial at which he might have\nbeen sentenced to death again. His exoneration was under threat\nof execution.\nWe also count an exoneration as under threat if the process\nthat ultimately led to the exoneration began while the defendant\nwas on death row, even if the final decision to release the de-\nfendant was made after he left death row. This sort of delay is\ncommon for defendants who are removed from death row when\ntheir convictions are reversed by reviewing courts but not re-\nleased until months or years later when the prosecution decides\nto dismiss the charges. In some cases the process is more elab-\norate. For instance, John Thompson was sentenced to death in\nnewly discovered evidence, but received only a reduction in his\nsentence to life imprisonment. Thompson successfully appealed\nthe denial of a new trial and was acquitted in 2003. Thus, al-\nthough his death sentence was vacated 2 y before his acquittal,\nwe treat him as exonerated under threat of execution because the\nlegal proceedings that led to exoneration began while he was on\ndeath row and ran to their conclusion two years later.\nWe define an exoneration under threat of execution as an\nexoneration that is the result of legal proceedings that were\ninitiated while the defendant was on death row. The date we\nassign to an exoneration is the date of removal from death row,\nthe last date on which the exoneration can be initiated and still\ncount as under threat, not the date on which the process was\ncompleted. Using these criteria, we determined that 107 of the\nunder threat of execution, and 10 exonerations were not under\nthat threat. The significance of this classification is apparent\nfrom Table 1. Of defendants sentenced to death since 1973,\nfrom this group even though these prisoners were, by definition,\nat a later stage of their imprisonment than those who remained\non death row. (Except for those who are exonerated--and a very\nsmall group who are resentenced to lesser penalties and even-\ntually released--all prisoners who are sentenced to death do\nultimately die in prison. They all start out on death row, some\nstay there until death by execution by other means, and the rest\neventually are moved to the general prison population where\nthey remain until they die.)\nOur estimate of the rate of false convictions among death-\nsentenced defendants is based on the hypothesis that death-\nsentenced prisoners who remain under threat of execution are\nfar more likely to be exonerated than those who remain in prison\nbut no longer face that threat. We use a Cox proportional haz-\nards model with a time-dependent covariate to test that hypoth-\nesis. We find, consistent with expectations, that death-sentenced\ndefendants who are no longer under threat of execution had\na rate of exoneration approximately one eighth of that for\nand Methods, section 3).\nAnalysis. Our task is to estimate the cumulative probability over\ntime of the event of interest, exoneration, in the population of\ndeath-sentenced defendants who remain under threat of execu-\ntion. The temporal measure (t) is time from conviction. Esti-\nmating this probability is complicated by the structure of the\nOn Death Row\nRemoved from Death Row\nby legal Proceedings\nDied on Death Row\nbut not Executed\nExecuted\nFig. 1.

The black line represents the total num-\nber of all death-sentenced defendants by time from\nconviction and the gray line the number of defend-\nants who remained on death row (DR) and were\ntherefore available for exoneration under threat of\nexecution by time from conviction. The three areas\nbetween the black and gray lines display the dis-\npositions of those defendants who were removed\nfrom death row over the time period by mode of\nremoval: execution, suicide or death from natural\ncauses, and legal proceedings (court orders or exec-\nutive clemency). A minority of defendants who were\nremoved from death by legal proceedings were ex-\nonerated. The plus symbols mark exonerations by\ndate measured in time from conviction. The 10 blue\nplus symbols (on the black line) mark exonerations\nthat were not under threat of execution by the date\nof the completion of the exoneration.

(i) Individual defendants joined this\npopulation across a 32-y period. Their duration in the study\nperiod varied from 1 to 32 y. (ii) All death-sentenced defendants\nbegan, at conviction, under threat of execution, but for most that\nthreat, and their membership in the population of interest,\nended within several years, usually because they were resen-\ntenced to life imprisonment. The net effect is that the number of\ndefendants under threat of execution is a decreasing function of\ntime from conviction, ranging from n = 7,482 at t = 0 y to n = 0 at\nTo estimate this cumulative probability, we use survival anal-\nysis. This technique has been used in a related context, to esti-\nmate the rate of all reversals of death sentences in the United\nStates (15). It is most commonly used, however, to evaluate the\nefficacy of medical treatments when not all patients experience\nthe outcome of interest. The issue we address is analogous, but\nthe analogy is counterintuitive.\nWe use survival analysis to assess the prospects of members of\na population that is subject to a special risk. In the usual medical\ncontext, the condition that defines the population is a pathology\nsuch as Lyme disease or diabetes; for our study the defining\ncondition is \"death sentence.\" As a result of this condition, every\nmember of this population is subject to the risk of a terminal\nevent that might remove him from the group that has survived\nwith this condition. In biomedical survival studies, that terminal\nevent that is studied is death from the pathology in question; for\nour study it is exoneration. This is a counterintuitive equivalence:\nFor our purposes, remaining in prison following a death sentence\ncounts as \"survival;\" and exoneration, which removes the subject\nfrom prison, is analogous to \"death\" in the common context in\nwhich survival analysis is used.\nSurvival analysis is often used to evaluate the efficacy of\na medical treatment that may reduce mortality from a pathology.\nIn this study the \"treatment\" that lowers the probability of the\nterminal event of interest (exoneration) is removal of the threat\nof execution. (This too is a counterintuitive analogy. Exonerating\nan innocent defendant is, of course, a good thing for that de-\nfendant, but removal from death row is equivalent to a treatment\nthat reduces the \"risk\" of exoneration.) Our focus, however, is\nnot on the treated group (those removed from death row) but on\nthose who remain untreated (defendants who remain under\nthreat of execution and therefore at high risk of exoneration).\nIn this study, as in medical research, subjects may be removed\nfrom the population of interest by means other than the terminal\nevent at issue. In survival analysis of a disease, the usual means of\nexit by other means are death from a different cause or discon-\ntinuation of participation in the study. In our study, all deaths\nafter capital sentencing (by execution, suicide, or natural causes)\nremove the person from the population that is subject to the risk\nof execution. However, most removals from the population by\nmeans other than exoneration are by legal action that reduces\nthe defendant's sentence to life in prison and thereby eliminates\nthe threat of execution.\nA primary difficulty in estimating the cumulative probability of\nexoneration is that some defendants were censored, i.e., they did\nnot have an opportunity to be exonerated under threat of exe-\ncution during the study period. Some defendants were removed\nfrom that threat during the study period but would have been\nexonerated had they remained under threat; others, who were\nsentenced to death relatively recently, remained under threat\nand had not been exonerated at the end of the study period but\nwould have been exonerated at some later point if the study\nperiod were extended. As a result, a simple proportion of ex-\nonerated defendants to all defendants is a biased estimate of the\ncumulative probability of exoneration.\nWe therefore use the Kaplan\u00adMeier estimator to calculate the\ncumulative probability of exoneration under threat of execution\nfor death-sentenced defendants, by time from conviction through\n2004. This estimator takes account of the censoring of observa-\ntions caused by recency of incarceration on death row, death\nfrom suicide or natural causes, or other removals from the threat\nof execution. The Kaplan\u00adMeier survival function estimates the\nprobability of being event-free (remaining on death row) up to\na given length of time from conviction. Its complement (1 minus\nthe estimator) estimates the cumulative incidence of the event\n(exoneration) up to the given length of time from conviction.\nUnlike a simple proportion, the Kaplan\u00adMeier estimator is un-\nbiased in the presence of independent censoring (see further\ndiscussions in Sensitivity Analysis), and is completely nonparametric;\nit can be viewed as a censored data analog of the empirical dis-\ntribution function. (17, 18) (SI Materials and Methods, section 2).\nAs Fig. 2 shows, the cumulative probability of exoneration for\ndeath-sentenced defendants who remained under threat of exe-\n2.8\u00ad5.2%). [We replicated the Kaplan\u00adMeier estimate of the\ncumulative probability of exoneration under threat of execution\nusing the Fleming\u00adHarrington estimator. Both results are virtu-\nally indistinguishable (SI Materials and Methods, section 3).]\nThis 4.1% estimate may approach the underlying rate of false\nconvictions because it reflects the cumulative effect of a process\nthat is uniquely efficient at detecting such errors. To rely on this\nestimate, however, two additional steps are necessary.\nSensitivity analysis. An important assumption for the validity of the\nKaplan\u00adMeier estimator is that censoring events that remove\nsubjects from consideration are statistically independent of the\ntime to the event of interest if the subjects had not been re-\nmoved. In this context, that assumption is plausible with respect\nto censoring by recency of conviction and by death from suicide\nor natural causes while under threat of execution. On the other\nhand, there are strong reasons to believe that both execution and\nremoval from death row by legal procedures without exoneration\nare not independent of time-to-exoneration. Because the as-\nsumption of independence may be violated, sensitivity analysis is\nnecessary.\nSpecifically, (i) 13% of death-sentenced inmates were re-\ncuted defendants may have been innocent, and, although none\nhas been exonerated after execution (9), they might have been\nexonerated if they had remained alive and on death row. How-\never, we expect that the proportion of innocent defendants is\nTime Since Conviction in Years\nCumulative Probability of Exoneration\nK-M Estimates\n95% Confidence Intervals\nFig. 2. Kaplan\u00adMeier (K-M) estimate of the cumulative rate of exoneration\n(solid line) and 95% confidence interval (dashed line) under threat of exe-\ncution for defendants sentenced to death in the United States from 1973\nthrough 2004 by time from conviction to removal from death row. Exon-\neration under threat of execution is defined as exoneration that resulted\nfrom legal proceedings that were initiated before the end of 2004 and while\nthe defendant was under sentence of death.\nlower among those who are executed than among those who\nremain on death row (7) (SI Materials and Methods, section 4).\nThe threat of execution is the engine that drives the process of\nexonerating innocent death row prisoners, and it is likely that this\nprocess becomes more painstaking as inmates approach their\nexecution dates. This concern about executing innocent defend-\nants also drives a second bias: (ii) It increases the proportion of\ninnocent defendants among the 36% of death row inmates who\nwere removed from death row and resentenced to prison but not\nplicitly recognize that it is appropriate to take the possibility of\ninnocence into account in deciding whether to reverse a convic-\ntion for procedural error or commute a death sentence to life\nimprisonment, and a wealth of anecdotal evidence suggests that\nthis practice is widespread (SI Materials and Methods, section 4).\nAs a result, those who are resentenced to punishments less than\ndeath are more likely to be innocent than those who remain on\ndeath row.\nIn short, we believe that (i) executed defendants are less likely\nto have been exonerated if they had remained on death row than\nthose who in fact remained on death row, and (ii) defendants\nwho were removed from death row but remained in prison are\nmore likely to have been exonerated if they had remained under\nthreat of execution.\nThese two biases are not equivalent in magnitude. Nearly\nthree times as many unexonerated death-sentenced defendants\na modest increase in the proportion of innocent defendants\namong death-sentenced prisoners resentenced to life imprison-\nment, compared with those who remain on death row, would\nmore than offset a complete absence of innocent defendants\namong those who are executed.\nWe use competing risks methodology (18), along with explicit\nassumptions about the counterfactual probability of exoneration\nfor those who were executed or resentenced to prison, to develop\na sensitivity analysis for the Kaplan\u00adMeier estimate of the cu-\nmulative exoneration rate. First, we estimate the cumulative\nincidence of exoneration subject to the competing risks of ex-\necution and resentencing by 21.4 y after conviction, on the as-\nsumption that censoring by recency, suicide, or natural death\nwas independent of these three event processes. The estimates\nof the probabilities of removal from risk of exoneration by\nexoneration under threat of execution, by execution itself, or by\nsentenced to death had an estimated 2.2% chance of being\nexonerated while under threat of execution by 21.4 y after\nconviction, assuming those executed or resentenced had zero\nchance of being exonerated (i.e., allowing for the competing\nrisks of execution and resentencing) (SI Materials and Methods,\nsection 3).\nConsider instead the assumption that, had they remained on\ndeath row, (i) those who were executed would have had zero\nchance of exoneration, and (ii) those who were resentenced\nwould have had twice the chance of exoneration as the entire\npopulation of defendants sentenced to death. This yields the\nfollowing estimate of the cumulative probability of exoneration,\nhad those who were exonerated or resentenced instead remained\nUsing the Delta method, the confidence interval for this estimate\nis 3.41\u00ad5.28%, assuming that the cumulative incidences of ex-\noneration and resentencing have zero covariance.\nA zero probability of exoneration for executed defendants had\nthey remained on death row is necessarily, for the purposes of\nthis estimate, a conservative assumption. We believe that the\nassumed probability of exoneration for those who were removed\nfrom death row and resentenced to prison, twice the mean for\nthe population, is reasonable. We conclude that the Kaplan\u00ad\nMeier estimate we obtained is conservative. Indeed the same\nresult we would obtain if we assume that the probability\nof exoneration for those resentenced to prison, had they\nremained on death row, is equal to or greater than 1.77 times\nEstimating false convictions from exonerations. Because there is no\ngeneral method to accurately determine innocence in a criminal\ncase, we use a proxy, exoneration: an official determination that\na convicted defendant is no longer legally culpable for the crime\nfor which he was condemned. There will be misclassifications.\nSome exonerated defendants are guilty of the crimes for which\nthey were sentenced to death. We expect that such errors are\nrare, given the high barriers the American legal system imposes\non convicted defendants in persuading authorities to reconsider\ntheir guilt (1\u00ad3, 7) (SI Materials and Methods, section 4). To date,\none such case has come to light, and has been reclassified (19).\nMonte Carlo simulations reveal that the effect of such mis-\nclassifications on the cumulative rate of exoneration is linear: If\n10% of exonerated defendants were in fact guilty, the mean\ncumulative rate of innocence for death-sentenced defendants\n(95% confidence interval of 2.8\u00ad3.7%) (SI Materials and Meth-\nods, section 3).\nOn the other side, some innocent defendants who remained\non death row for more than 21.4 y but were not exonerated are\nmisclassified as guilty. Some may still be exonerated; some may\nbe executed; and most will likely die in prison, on death row or\noff, of natural causes or suicide. In the absence of better data we\nassume that the probability of a legal campaign to exonerate any\nprisoner under threat of death who has a plausible innocence\nclaim is 1, and we assume that the probability of success for an\ninnocent prisoner who remains under such threat for at least\n21.4 y is also 1. These are necessarily conservative assumptions.\nTo the extent that these probabilities are in fact less than 1, our\nestimate will understate the actual rate of false convictions.\nThe distribution of possible misclassifications is asymmetrical:\n216 defendants remained on death row longer than 21.4 y, whereas\nonly 107 were exonerated under threat of execution. Unless the\nprocess of death row exoneration is assumed to be unrealistically\nthorough, it is likely that the number of innocent death-sentenced\ndefendants misclassified as guilty exceeds the number of guilty\ndefendants exonerated under threat of execution and misclassified\nas innocent. [The proxy we use (the exoneration rate) is also im-\nportant in its own right: It is a direct measure of the rate of death\nsentencing of defendants later determined to be legally not guilty.]\nTaken together, the sensitivity analysis and the likely net\neffects of misclassification both point in the same direction and\nsuggest that our 4.1% estimate of the rate of false conviction\namong death-sentenced defendants is conservative.\nDiscussion\nWe present a conservative estimate of the proportion of erro-\nneous convictions of defendants sentenced to death in the\nfinding; there are no other reliable estimates of the rate of false\nconviction in any context. The main source of potential bias is\nthe accuracy of our classification of cases as true or false con-\nvictions. On that issue it is likely that we have an undercount,\nthat there are more innocent death row defendants who have not\nbeen identified and exonerated than guilty ones who have been\nexonerated in error.\nThe most charged question in this area is different: How many\ninnocent defendants have been put to death (6)? We cannot\nestimate that number directly but we believe it is comparatively\nA reviewer of an earlier draft suggested an alternative analytic approach. The suggested\napproach postulates a campaign process that gives some but not all death-sentenced\ndefendants the opportunity to be exonerated. Identification of the false conviction rate\nis then based on independence assumptions between innocence and removal from\ndeath row. With more complete data of the sort required for the best realization of\nthis insightful approach, we believe that it would offer a particularly valuable supple-\nment, and test of the robustness, of our findings and conclusions.\nlow. If the rate were the same as our estimate for false death\nsentences, the number of innocents executed in the United\nStates in the past 35 y would be more than 50 (20). We do not\nbelieve that has happened. Our data and the experience of\npractitioners in the field both indicate that the criminal justice\nsystem goes to far greater lengths to avoid executing innocent\ndefendants than to prevent them from remaining in prison in-\ndefinitely. One way to do so is to disproportionately reverse\ndeath sentences in capital cases in which the accuracy of the\ndefendants' convictions is in doubt and to resentence them to life\nimprisonment, a practice that makes our estimate of the rate of\nerror conservative. However, no process of removing potentially\ninnocent defendants from the execution queue can be foolproof.\nWith an error rate at trial over 4%, it is all but certain that\nIt is possible that the death-sentencing rate of innocent\ndefendants has changed over time. No specific evidence points in\nthat direction, but the number and the distribution of death\nsentences have changed dramatically in the past 15 y (22). One\nchange, however, is unlikely to have much impact: the advent of\nDNA identification technology. DNA evidence is useful pri-\nmarily in rape rather than homicide investigations. Only 13% of\npostconviction DNA testing (13), so the availability of pre-\nconviction testing will have at most a modest effect on that rate.\nUnfortunately, we cannot generalize from our findings on\ndeath sentences to the rate of false convictions in any broader\ncategory of crime. Capital prosecutions, and to a lesser extent\nmurder cases in general, are handled very differently from other\ncriminal cases. There are theoretical reasons to believe that the\nrate of false conviction may be higher for murders in general,\nand for capital murders in particular, than for other felony\nconvictions, primarily because the authorities are more likely to\npursue difficult cases with weak evidence of guilt if one or more\npeople have been killed (23). However, there are no data that\nconfirm or refute this hypothesis.\nWe do know that the rate of error among death sentences is\nfar greater than Justice Scalia's reassuring 0.027% (6). That\nmuch is apparent directly from the number of death row exon-\nerations that have already occurred. Our research adds the\ndisturbing news that most innocent defendants who have been\nsentenced to death have not been exonerated, and many--\nincluding the great majority of those who have been resen-\ntenced to life in prison--probably never will be.\nThis is only part of a disturbing picture. Fewer than half of all\ndefendants who are convicted of capital murder are ever sen-\ntenced to death in the first place (e.g., 49.1% in Missouri as in\nas in ref. 26). Sentencing juries, like other participants in the\nprocess, worry about the execution of innocent defendants.\nInterviews with jurors who participated in capital sentencing\nproceedings indicate that lingering doubts about the defendant's\nguilt is the strongest available predictor of a sentence of life\nimprisonment rather than death (27). It follows that the rate of\ninnocence must be higher for convicted capital defendants who\nare not sentenced to death than for those who are. The net result\nis that the great majority of innocent defendants who are con-\nvicted of capital murder in the United States are neither exe-\ncuted nor exonerated. They are sentenced, or resentenced to\nprison for life, and then forgotten.\n"
