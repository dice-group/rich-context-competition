He concludes\nthat the primary role of the media is to facilitate information\nexchange among policy promoters, policy makers, and the\npublic. He argues that this indirect approach is necessary\nbecause there is too much information and not enough mech-\nanisms to prioritize it for policy analysis. Similarly, Bennett's\nstudy of media and public policy found that stories become\nnews as media outlets personalize individual subjects outside\ntheir social contexts and fragment details from general pat-\nterns (Macaulay, Friedman, & Mertz, 2007). Although media\ncoverage of U.S. higher education institutions has shown\ngreat variation, it predictably demonstrates a combination of\nKingdon's information exchange with Bennett's personaliza-\ntion and fragmentation.\nAlthough this media coverage has occurred in public\nview, two sets of forces have been at work behind the scenes.\nFirst is the U.S. government, including the U.S. Senate, the\nU.S. Department of Education (USDE), and the U.S.\nGovernment Accountability Office (GAO). Second is the\nfor-profit institutions themselves. This case study explores\none fundamental question: How did these forces drive dra-\nmatic media coverage shifts in the first 2 years of the Obama\nadministration?\nMethod\nThe methodology for this case study was a two-phase, tex-\ntual analysis of media coverage concerning for-profit higher\neducation companies. The first phase built on a relevant\nquery of the Lexus Nexus academic database, which returned\n2010.3 The author coded each of these stories as positive,\nneutral, and negative. Figure 1 provides typical examples.\nThe second phase was a software text analysis using Tropes\nversion 7.2.4 The Tropes program provides an objective mech-\nanism to code content of news stories. Using electronic ver-\nsions of news articles, which were grouped by category,\nTropes determined the frequency of terms and the concentra-\ntion of connections among the terms.5 The output was a series\nof graphs depicting the action orientation of terms on one axis\nand the concentration of connections among terms on the\nother.6 The author used this output to generate a summary of\nthe key themes from each category of news articles.7\nBecause of data limitations within Tropes, the author\neliminated some news articles from the text analysis. If the\nfull set of articles in a category was too large, the author\nremoved the shortest article and continued until the collec-\ntion met Tropes limitations. Across all categories, the Tropes\nanalysis covered 78.8% of the articles (weighted by\nword count), with a minimum of 71.0% and a maximum of\n91.7%.

In July\n2009, President Obama placed a spotlight on higher educa-\ntion when he announced a national goal for America to have\nthe highest proportion of college graduates in the world by\neducation was not a popular topic in news coverage, hence,\nfor-profits were not in the news very much. Figure 2 shows\na very light frequency of stories about for-profits from\nhappened in May 2010 to capture the attention of news out-\nlets across the United States. The frequency of stories\nincreased to virtually constant coverage each week. The\nintensity of stories increased as well, with many weeks gar-\nnering mentions of for-profits on an almost daily basis.\nThese developments raise the question of what happened.\nHow did the topic of for-profits rise from virtually no cover-\nage in November 2008 to nearly nonstop coverage by\nCalm Before the Storm\nFigure 3 provides some perspective on what might be termed\ncalm before the storm. This figure zooms in to the period from\ncoverage balanced negative with neutral-to-positive stories\nCode Example 1 Headline Example 2 Headline Example 3 Headline\nPositive For-Profit Colleges Change\nHigher Education's\nLandscape\nFor-Profit Colleges Teach\nLesson in Cost vs. Value\nFor-profit model serves\nstudents and faculty\nNeutral For-Profit Colleges Find New\nMarket Niche\nFor-Profits Spend Heavily to\nFend Off New Rule\nFor-profit colleges face new\nrules in Florida\nNegative For-profit colleges drawing\nlow-income students haul in\naid\nFor-profi t, for shame For-profit college debt brings\nother burdens\nFigure 1. Examples of news story coding\nNumber of Stories\nPosive and Neutral Stories Negave Stories\nGramling 3\nthroughout this period. There is one exception, which occurred\njust after Thanksgiving 2009. News writers in the compact\ncity of Durham, NC, and the tiny town of Brattleboro, VT,\nagreed that a significant number of low-income students were\nusing Pell Grant dollars to attend for-profits. However, a\nwriter in Grand Rapids, MI, noted simply that for-profits were\ngrowing in their area. Perhaps it was the somewhat neutral\ntone in this article that stamped out widespread consensus. At\nany rate, negative messages about for-profits did not reverber-\nate nationwide.\nThe Tropes text analysis provided similar findings. Profit\nwas the most commonly used term in both negative and\nneutral-to-positive stories. Similarly, both featured education\nas a concentrated theme. Although negative stories placed\nconcentrated emphasis on student loans, neutral-to-positive\nstories focused on the money for-profits spend to deliver\neducation. Finally, negative stories often mentioned the per-\ncentage of low-income students who did not complete\nschool. This theme was absent from neutral-to-positive sto-\nries, which instead positioned for-profits as providing a ser-\nvice to students.\nAll-Out War\nAll of this changed in May 2010. Figure 4 outlines three\ndistinct phases of news coverage, which the author describes\nas recriminations, resistance, and recalcitrance. These\nphases suggest an all-out war in the press. On one side were\nthe for-profits. On the other hand were the U.S. Senate, the\nUSDE, and the GAO.\nRecriminations\nOn May 6, 2010, the Philadelphia Inquirer published a\nlengthy, 2,100-word article titled \"For-Profit Colleges Leave\nMany Students in Debt.\" This article featured the story of a\n21-year-old student at a Philadelphia for-profit who left\nschool about halfway through her bachelor's program. For\nher efforts, this student faced US$100,000 in debt with a job\nat a delivery service that paid only US$8 per hour--and no\ndegree. The school had explained that she could expect to\nincur about US$75,000 in debt during her studies. Still, she\nsecured private loans that helped contribute to her debt. This\narticle even provided the school's point of view: It serves a\nchallenging population of students who have struggled with\ncollege before, it walks through loans and debt as part of\nstudent orientations, and it has a number of support systems\nto help struggling students. Still, this article succinctly\narticulated the battle lines of what would become an all-out\nwar as follows: \"Advocates say the schools help low-\nincome, less-prepared students fulfill their dreams. Critics\ncontend they prey on low-performing students and load\nthem with untenable debt\" (Synder, 2010).\nAlthough this article characterized advocates as helping\nlow-income students, no news outlet would pick up on this\ntheme for several months. The immediate aftermath of the\nInquirer story was that news outlets in Dayton, Atlanta, and\nKansas City repeated the critics' perspective that for-profits\nwere predators taking advantage of low-performing students.\nKingdon's (2003) information exchange appeared to be at\nwork, raising awareness of this critical viewpoint.\nNumber of Stories\nPosive and Neutral Stories Negave Stories\n4 SAGE Open\nAs if on cue, the U.S. Senate Committee on Health,\nEducation, Labor and Pensions (HELP) held a hearing on\nFederal Investment in For-Profit Education\" (U.S. Senate,\n2010a). This hearing sounded the usual critical theme of for-\nprofits as predators, and it featured unflattering testimony\nfrom a representative from the USDE. This hearing triggered\nthree negative news stories that same day. It also triggered\nthe solitary neutral story during this entire period of recrimi-\nnations. The same New York Times writer who wrote a\nsharply critical story on June 24, 2010, titled \"Battle Lines\nDrawn Over For-Profit Colleges\" wrote a shorter, neutral\narticle that same day, explaining that \"For-Profit Colleges\nFind New Market Niche.\" The niche in this article is a mem-\norandum of understanding with the California community\ncollege system. This agreement allowed students who could\nfind an available course at the community college to take\nthat same course online at a for-profit university. Though the\narticle was neutral, the author noted that \"[a]t the academic\nsenate's spring meeting, faculty members voted to urge the\nchancellor to withdraw from the memorandum of under-\nstanding\" (Lewin, 2010). The battle lines in this war had\nbecome very clear.\nSimilar recriminations continued from late June through\nearly August 2010, with negative stories in Dayton and Tulsa.\nThere was also a damaging article in the Los Angeles Times\nfor Taxpayers.\" As if building on this sentiment, the U.S.\nSenate HELP Committee arranged a follow-up hearing on\nhearing was the publication of a GAO report titled \"For-Profit\nColleges: Undercover Testing Finds Colleges Encouraged\nFraud and Engaged in Deceptive and Questionable Marketing\nPractices.\" This report revealed videotapes from undercover\ninvestigators who visited 15 for-profits across the United\nStates. In its written report, the GAO \"found that 4 colleges\nencouraged fraudulent practices and that all 15 made decep-\ntive or otherwise questionable statements to GAO's under-\ncover applicants.\" (U.S. Senate, 2010b) But the videotapes\nwere very damaging, leading the New York Times to declare\nNumber of Stories\nPosive and Neutral Stories Negave Stories\nRecriminaons\nResistance\nRecalcitrance\nGramling 5\n\"For-Profit Colleges Mislead, Report Finds\" and the Christian\nScience Monitor to exclaim \"For-profit colleges hit with\nclaims of fraud, aggressive recruiting\"--both on the day of\nthe hearing.\nA Tropes analysis confirms the dynamic at work in this\nphase. For neutral-to-positive stories, college was the pri-\nmary actor, and the most common expression was the memo-\nrandum of understanding with the California community\ncollege system. Conversely, negative stories featured com-\npany as the primary actor and mentioned the term profit most\noften. In addition, students choosing to attend for-profits\nappeared prominently in neutral-to-positive stories. But\nthese stories ignored a theme that negative stories spot-\nlighted--the impact of student loans.\nResistance\nThe August 4, 2010, U.S. Senate HELP Committee hearing\nappears to have been a last straw for the for-profit higher\neducation industry. To this point, for-profits appeared\nstunned by the constant assaults and the one-sided portrayals\nof their schools and students in the press. As illustrated in\nFigure 4, the period of recriminations featured 15 negative\nstories about for-profits--the equivalent of one per week. In\naddition, even the one neutral story during this period said\nnothing about the advocate position in this war--that for-\nprofits help low-income and less-prepared students. The tide\nwas clearly about to change, as this war entered a period of\nresistance.\nThe first salvo came predictably from the Washington\nPost. This company owns Kaplan University, one of the\nnation's largest for-profits. The Washington Post issued a\nnews-oriented article on August 17, 2010, titled \"For-Profit\nHigher-Education Providers Resist Regulatory Action.\"As\nthe Post entered the fray, for-profits generally understood the\nimportance of sounding a note of opposition to the\nPhiladelphia Inquirer's May story. Though they did not find\na sympathetic audience with the Inquirer, they were success-\nful in placing a story in the cross-state rival Pittsburgh Post-\nGazette titled \"For-Profit Schools Say Loan Data Doesn't\nTell Whole Story\" in the Business section on August 17,\n2010. The USDE gave some ground in the war by allowing\nan interview for this article:\n\"What we know is that there are many for-profit schools\nthat are doing a great job of educating students, and we\nknow there are some bad actors who have been perpe-\ntrating fraud and deceit,\" said Justin Hamilton, an edu-\ncation department spokesman, in a telephone interview.\nIt would seem that the Philadelphia Inquirer was exposed.\nIn preparing its story, this news outlet stressed an individu-\nal's sad story about student loan debt while omitting the full\ncontext. This is what Bennett described as the media practice\nof personalization.\nFor-profits finally found their voice as an advocate for\nlow-income, less-prepared students. They successfully\nearned neutral coverage from the New York Times national\ndesk and even placed two positive editorials in this outlet.\nPerhaps more important, they saw positive news-desk cover-\nage during this period from the Denver Post, the Miami\nHerald, the Florida Times-Union of Jacksonville, and the\nUSA Today. In all, there were nine positive and eight neutral\nstories about for-profits in the period of resistance.\nFurthermore, although negative news remained constant at\nabout one story per week, neutral-to-positive stories outnum-\nbered negative ones for the first time. This trend continued\nTropes analysis confirms a dramatic shift in the content of\nneutral-to-positive and negative stories during this phase.\nBoth mentioned profit most often. But neutral-to-positive sto-\nries sounded broad themes across for-profit locations nation-\nwide, whereas negative stories centered on a single location.\nSpecifically, neutral-to-positive stories mentioned political\ncontributions to Democrats as the most prominent actor. The\nmost highly concentrated topic in these stories was the USDE\nand its release of trial, 3-year cohort default rates. However,\nnegative stories mentioned recruiting activities by a single\nUtah for-profit as the most prominent actor and also as the\nmost highly concentrated topic. In addition, while negative\nstories emphasized money as the broadest unifying theme,\nneutral-to-positive stories stressed employment outcomes.\nRecalcitrance\nFor-profits may have felt justified in taking a break from this\nwar. President Obama characterized the November 2010\nelections, in which Republicans took control of the House of\nRepresentatives and seriously eroded the Democratic major-\nity in the Senate, as a \"shellacking (MacNeil/Lehrer\nProductions, 2010).\" The momentum of news coverage\nacross the country had achieved a near equilibrium. But\nrather than conceding defeat, critics of for-profits appeared\nas determined as ever. The first signal of recalcitrance was\nReview titled \"For-Profit Schools Called Subprime\nOpportunity.\" This was the most incendiary language used\nto date by either side of this war.\nThis language is also typical of what Bennett described as\nfragmentation. The Pittsburgh Tribune Review provided iso-\nlated facts about student lending outside their social context.\nBy late 2010, the United States was in the throes of a chal-\nlenging recession. It is widely understood that demand for\nhigher education, especially among for-profits, tends to\nincrease in a recession and decrease in a recovery.8 Yet the\ncoverage in this article did not account for the industry's\ncountercyclical nature in its analysis.\n6 SAGE Open\nThis period just as easily could be called \"the battle of\nPittsburgh.\" It is interesting that the Philadelphia Inquirer\nhad been largely silent since the May 2010 story that started\nthe war. This was no coincidence; by Thanksgiving 2010, the\nInquirer was knee-deep in covering two city commission\nscandals. One was a Philadelphia Deputy City Commissioner\nwho resigned after 27 years because of city charter violations\n(Brennan, 2010). The other was a Montgomery County so-\ncalled \"breakfastgate\" scandal, where commissioners appar-\nently met illegally outside commission meetings (Roebuck,\nries during this period came from Pittsburgh in either the\nTribune Review or the Post-Gazette.\nBut if this was a battle, it was not hotly contested. Nearly\ntwo thirds of the stories during this period was negative, and\nfour of the five Pittsburgh press stories were negative as\nwell. To be sure, the New York Times and the USA Today\nposted no stories about for-profits. In addition, perhaps most\ntelling, there were no hearings, investigations, or public\nstatements by the U.S. Senate, the USDE, or the GAO.\nBy this phase, the Tropes analysis reflects a clear dichot-\nomy between neutral-to-positive and negative stories. Profit\nwas the only commonality, as it was the most frequently used\nterm across all stories. College was the primary actor in\nneutral-to-positive articles, whereas companies and profits\nheld this position for negative stories. In addition, for the\nfirst time, the two categories had directly opposed portrayals\nof students and schools. Students received concentrated\nfocus in neutral-to-positive articles, with schools connecting\nto a number of underlying concepts. The reverse was true in\nnegative stories, where schools took center stage with stu-\ndents as the broadly connected notion.\nFigure 5.

Tropes output of text analysis for the recriminations period\nNote: Dashed circles are the author's, highlighting points of emphasis in this article.\nRetractions and Retreats\nJanuary 2011 saw renewed interest in for-profits. But this\ntime, the war had taken a different turn with the publication\nof two pivotal articles. First was the Village Voice retraction\nof a negative article it published on January 5, 2011, titled\n\"For-Profit Blues: The Explosion of For-Profit `Proprietary'\nColleges, Some NYC Teachers Charge, Is Leaving Too\nMany Low-Income Students Without Degrees--and With a\nPile of Debt.\" The Voice confirmed that the writer fabricated\nhis sources (Stoeffel, 2011). In one instance, he fabricated a\nstudent who supposedly left a for-profit college with a great\ndeal of debt but without a degree. In a more troubling\ninstance, he fabricated a GAO spokesperson who suppos-\nedly confirmed some of the details. This retraction under-\nmined the GAO's position in this war and gave for-profits\nsignificant ammunition to raise questions about the motives\nof critical news coverage.\nA second pivotal article was the Chicago Tribune's\nNegative Federal Report: Coalition Sues Education\nDepartment Over Claims Industry Uses Deceptive Practices.\"\nThe federal lawsuit alleges that the GAO has not responded\nto a Freedom of Information Act request concerning its\nAugust 2010 report. That report featured prominently in the\nrecriminations stage mentioned above. This article is pivotal\nbecause it made national news of GAO revisions to its\nAugust 2010 report. This revision actually took place on\npress. The revisions suggest that the undercover investiga-\ntion videos did not tell the whole story (Yerak, 2010). In a\nsense, the GAO had to retreat from its prior position. This\nmarked the second story in less than 1 week that undermined\nthe GAO and its damaging report on for-profits.\nThe first 2 weeks of 2011 saw for-profit critics forced into\na retraction and a retreat. This dynamic has persisted through\n8 SAGE Open\nApril 2011, with for-profit critics defending their prior posi-\ntions and proponents placing a large spotlight on every\nreversal. Still, no voices have emerged to suggest common\nground between empowering lower-income and less-pre-\npared students to pursue their dreams while also protecting\nlow-performing students from predatory practices.\nConclusion\nThe Philadelphia Inquirer touched off an all-out war\nbetween for-profit institutions of higher education and U.S.\ngovernment forces determined to control them. In a sense,\nthis war is symptomatic of the great divide in the U.S. soci-\nety between conservative and progressive thought.\nConservatives are willing to give people a chance to suc-\nceed, though they seem less sympathetic to the plight of\nthose who fail. In the language of this war, they support for-\nprofits and their mission of providing a chance of success for\nlower-income, less-prepared students. However, they lack\nsuggestions for how to address the debt load borne by those\nwho do not succeed.\nHowever, progressives trust government nonprofit entities\nmuch more than private for-profits of any kind--including\nand especially higher education institutions. In the language of\nthis war, they desire to protect low-performing students from\nfor-profit predators at any and all costs. But they lack perspec-\ntives on enabling students to make their own choices about\nwhere and whether to pursue college education.\nNeither side of this war has maintained the upper hand\nsince it began in May 2010. It would seem that the war will\ncontinue as long as conservatives and progressives fail to\nfind common ground that places decision making in the\nhands of students while establishing effective quality control\nof for-profits. This will give the news media plenty to cover,\nas it facilitates information exchange, on one hand, while it\nemploys personalization and fragmentation, on the other.\nFigure 7.
